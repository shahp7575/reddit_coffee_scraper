My preferred mode of holiday travel to visit my family is by car rather than air. This preference is not rooted in aviophobia but rather in the pragmatic consideration of cargo capacity, control, etc. The ability to transport a greater volume of personal belongings, gifts, and other necessary items significantly outweighs the marginal time savings offered by air travel. Plus, I have this thing where I can't drive for super long stretches at a time, so breaking up the trip is a must.

This morning I decided to burn one of the candles I purchased from Lohn as part of my first order with the company.  Lohn's Panettone did not disappoint.  I knew this was going to be a special treat because I was impressed with them from opening the shipping box.  Nice cold throw, and now a soft but strong hot throw and it has only been lit for about 45minutes.

What is appealing to me about this candle is how different it is from other traditional Christmas candles that fall into one of the woodsy, mullled wine, gingerbread categories.  The websites description is spot on, ""Warm candied bread. Crisp citrus zest, richly sweet dried fruits, and deep amber rum warmed through with cozy vanilla and spicy ginger.""

Talking about my face my weight how I look how no one would love me because “I’m a stupid fat fuckin cow” (word for word verbatim) so now I tell everyone I don’t like to be called out I don’t care if it’s joking or not but if I ask you to stop it then please stop it, when people don’t stop I just leave or disassociate til it’s time for me to leave said family thing or whatever. I told everyone that they remind me of my biological family who I hate (hate is a strong word but it’s the only one that explains how I feel about this) and that I don’t like it I don’t care if they like it I don’t care if it’s a “African American” thing to do that’s that just how African American families operate and that I don’t need to be so sensitive about it.

1hj8n8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hj8n8t/was_it_assault/,Was it assault?,"Hi everyone, I wanted to get your opinion on this situation. Preface: I want you guys to know I went out with this guy at least five times after this and he would stay the night at my house and we would have lots of sex, and go snowboarding, but we really didn’t get along.



OK, so let’s rewind to our first date. He knew I was sober from alcohol for 20 days but I didn’t want to go to a coffee shop cause that’s not my style so we met at the alchemist brewery. Crushed two head toppers and then took it to Picasso where we had a b eer and a shot. My friend was the bartender. I guess I was being super loud. I look like my sister and everyone thought I was her and they were like why Shelby so loud tonight. Anyways, we get back into my truck do the kiss after the end of the day and then I’m like wow I am too drunk to drive. Don’t judge me guys cause I had three beers and a shot over five hours but was still fucking drunk. I decided I didn’t want to leave my truck the hour away so the guy offered to follow me home even though he had to be at the airport in Boston by 5 AM. He follows me home and we start making out on the couch and then I decided I was too drunk and wanted to go lay down in my bed and I was like yeah you can come cuddle with me. I said when we are downstairs on the couch that I didn’t wanna have sex several time and he said I Know. We’re up in my bed making out spooning. I’m just in my underwear and all of a sudden he pulls my underwear to the side and shoves his dick inside of me with no condom. I’m super drunk and haven’t been laid in a while so I’m like hell yeah but then take him out of me and go. What the hell dude I’m not even on birth control And he goes. It’s OK. I don’t sleep with a lot of girls and then I don’t really remember what happened and then he left. I definitely ended up throwing up right after he left and in the morning. Which I let him know on FaceTime. The next day he FaceTime me five times from the airport to let me know about his trip and to tell me that he really likes me and asked me not to date anybody else until he gets back from his work trip. 

I agree and when he comes back, we start hanging out, but there’s a bunch of red flags. Now that I have spent a week, not talking to this guy recalibrated my sobriety and mulled over the situation. I feel that our first date ended in something similar to  assault...  I continued to see the guy and sleep with the guy after this and I think I’ve just been accustomed to this shitty behavior, is this date rape? Am I overreacting? Should I mention to the guy what he did and why it was assulty or just let sleeping dogs lie?? Thanks for the advice Reddit dating is hard… ",1,1734783133.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Karan, twenty and perpetually fueled by instant coffee, navigated the chaotic hallways of his college hostel. Books clutched to his chest, he was a typical second-year engineering student, until he stumbled into Dr. Rajeev Sharma’s introductory thermodynamics lecture. Rajeev, a junior lecturer with a thoughtful gaze and a knack for explaining complex concepts with disarming simplicity, was instantly captivating.

It wasn't Rajeev's impressive knowledge alone that drew Karan in. There was a warmth in his voice, a gentle humour that surfaced during lectures, making even the most daunting equations seem approachable. Karan found himself lingering after class, asking questions, the genuine curiosity masking a deeper fascination. Rajeev, in turn, responded with patience, occasionally sharing anecdotes about his own college days, a hint of a shared past bridging their student-teacher divide.

The college became their unintentional cupid. Late nights studying in the library saw them occasionally share a table, the silence punctuated by soft whispers about coursework that slowly morphed into discussions about music, movies, and dreams. The campus cafeteria became another familiar meeting ground, the shared tables a stage for shy smiles and stolen glances over lukewarm coffee.

Slowly, subtly, the initial admiration blossomed into something more profound. Karan found himself looking forward to Rajeev's lectures with an eagerness that surprised him. Rajeev, too, seemed to enjoy their interactions, his easygoing demeanor softening further in Karan's presence. The unspoken understanding between them grew, a delicate bloom nurtured in the heart of their bustling college world.

    We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.
    Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to The Hive.
    Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey!
    That girl was hot.
    She's my cousin!
    She is?
    Yes, we're all cousins.
    Right. You're right.
    At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence.
    These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.
    What do you think he makes?
    Not enough.
    Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.
    What does that do?
    Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.
    Saves us millions.
    Can anyone work on the Krelman?
    Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones.
    But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.
    But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.
    The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.
    What's the difference?
    You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.
    So you'll just work us to death?
    We'll sure try.
    Wow! That blew my mind!
    ""What's the difference?""
    How can you say that?
    One job forever?
    That's an insane choice to have to make.
    I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.
    But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?
    Why would you question anything? We're bees.
    We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.
    You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?
    Like what? Give me one example.
    I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.
    Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.
    Wait a second. Check it out.
    Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
    Wow.
    I've never seen them this close.
    They know what it's like outside The Hive.
    Yeah, but some don't come back.
    Hey, Jocks!
    Hi, Jocks!
    You guys did great!
    You're monsters!
    You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
    I wonder where they were.
    I don't know.
    Their day's not planned.
    Outside The Hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.
    You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.
    Right.
    Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.
    It's just a status symbol.
    Bees make too much of it.
    Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.
    Those ladies?
    Aren't they our cousins too?
    Distant. Distant.
    Look at these two.
    Couple of Hive Harrys.
    Let's have fun with them.
    It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.
    Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!
    He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!
    Oh, my!
    I never thought I'd knock him out.
    What were you doing during this?
    Trying to alert the authorities.
    I can autograph that.
    A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?
    Yeah. Gusty.
    We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.
    Six miles, huh?
    Barry!
    A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.
    Maybe I am.
    You are not!
    We're going 0900 at J-Gate.
    What do you think, buzzy-boy?
    Are you bee enough?
    I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.
    Hey, Honex!
    Dad, you surprised me.
    You decide what you're interested in?
    Well, there's a lot of choices.
    But you only get one.
    Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?
    Son, let me tell you about stirring.
    You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.
    You get yourself into a rhythm.
    It's a beautiful thing.
    You know, Dad, the more I think about it,
    maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.
    You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?
    That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.
    Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!
    Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
    I'm not trying to be funny.
    You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
    You're gonna be a stirrer?
    No one's listening to me!
    Wait till you see the sticks I have.
    I could say anything right now.
    I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
    Let's open some honey and celebrate!
    Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!
    I'm so proud.
    We're starting work today!
    Today's the day.
    Come on! All the good jobs will be gone.
    Yeah, right.
    Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...
    Is it still available?
    Hang on. Two left!
    One of them's yours! Congratulations!
    Step to the side.
    What'd you get?
    Picking crud out. Stellar!
    Wow!
    Couple of newbies?
    Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
    Make your choice.
    You want to go first?
    No, you go.
    Oh, my. What's available?
    Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.
    Any chance of getting the Krelman?
    Sure, you're on.
    I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
    Wax monkey's always open.
    The Krelman opened up again.
    What happened?
    A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.
    Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.
    Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!
    Oh, this is so hard!
    Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler.
    Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?
    Barry!
    All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...
    What happened to you?
    Where are you?
    I'm going out.
    Out? Out where?
    Out there.
    Oh, no!
    I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.
    You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?
    Another call coming in.
    If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today.
    Hey, guys.
    Look at that.
    Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
    Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
    It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.
    Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
    Sign here, here. Just initial that.
    Thank you.
    OK.
    You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.
    So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.
    Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.
    Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!
    That's awful.
    And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!
     All right, launch positions!
    Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!
    Black and yellow!
    Hello!
    You ready for this, hot shot?
    Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.
    Wind, check.
    Antennae, check.
    Nectar pack, check.
    Wings, check.
    Stinger, check.
    Scared out of my shorts, check.
    OK, ladies,
    let's move it out!
    Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers!
    All of you, drain those flowers!
    Wow! I'm out!
    I can't believe I'm out!
    So blue.
    I feel so fast and free!
    Box kite!
    Wow!
    Flowers!
    This is Blue Leader, We have roses visual.
    Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.
    Roses!
    30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.
    Stand to the side, kid.
    It's got a bit of a kick.
    That is one nectar collector!
    Ever see pollination up close?
    No, sir.
    I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one.
    See that? It's a little bit of magic.
    That's amazing. Why do we do that?
    That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.
    Cool.
    I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow, Could be daisies, Don't we need those?
    Copy that visual.
    Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.
    Say again? You're reporting a moving flower?
    Affirmative.
    That was on the line!
    This is the coolest. What is it?
    I don't know, but I'm loving this color.
    It smells good.
    Not like a flower, but I like it.
    Yeah, fuzzy.
    Chemical-y.
    Careful, guys. It's a little grabby.
    My sweet lord of bees!
    Candy-brain, get off there!
    Problem!
    Guys!
    This could be bad.
    Affirmative.
    Very close.
    Gonna hurt.
    Mama's little boy.
    You are way out of position, rookie!
    Coming in at you like a missile!
    Help me!
    I don't think these are flowers.
    Should we tell him?
    I think he knows.
    What is this?!
    Match point!
    You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it!
    Yowser!
    Gross.
    There's a bee in the car!
    Do something!
    I'm driving!
    Hi, bee.
    He's back here!
    He's going to sting me!
    Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!
    He blinked!
    Spray him, Granny!
    What are you doing?!
    Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.
    I gotta get home.
    Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain.
    Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!
    Ken, could you close the window please?
    Ken, could you close the window please?
    Check out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out.
    Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.
    What was that?
    Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes!
    That is diabolical.
    It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.
    What's number one? Star Wars?
    Nah, I don't go for that... kind of stuff.
    No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.
    When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.
    There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.
    I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.
    I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.
    Wait! Stop! Bee!
    Stand back. These are winter boots.
    Wait!
    Don't kill him!
    You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me!
    Why does his life have less value than yours?
    Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?
    I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.
    My brochure!
    There you go, little guy.
    I'm not scared of him.It's an allergic thing.
     Put that on your resume brochure.
    My whole face could puff up.
    Make it one of your special skills.
    Knocking someone out is also a special skill.
    Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.
    Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
    Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.
    You could put carob chips on there.
    Bye.
    Supposed to be less calories.
    Bye.
    I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something.
    All right, here it goes.
    Nah.
    What would I say?
    I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human.
    I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to.
    Oh, I can't do it. Come on!
    No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't.
    How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good.
    Here she comes! Speak, you fool!
    Hi!
    I'm sorry. You're talking.
    Yes, I know.
    You're talking!
    I'm so sorry.
    No, it's OK. It's fine.
    I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed.
    Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting.
    This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee!
    I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me.
    And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised.
    That was a little weird. I'm talking with a bee.
    Yeah.
    I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me!
    I just want to say I'm grateful.
    I'll leave now.
    Wait! How did you learn to do that?
    What?
    The talking thing.
    Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up.
    That's very funny.
    Yeah.
    Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with.
    Anyway... Can I... get you something?
    Like what?
    I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Coffee?
    I don't want to put you out.
    It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.
    It's just coffee.
    I hate to impose.
    Don't be ridiculous!
    Actually, I would love a cup.
    Hey, you want rum cake?
    I shouldn't.
    Have some.
    No, I can't.
    Come on!
    I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.
    Where?
    These stripes don't help.
    You look great!
    I don't know if you know anything about fashion.
    Are you all right?
    No.
    He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison.
    He finally gets there.
    He runs up the steps into the church.
    The wedding is on.
    And he says, ""Watermelon?
    I thought you said Guatemalan.
    Why would I marry a watermelon?""
    Is that a bee joke?
    That's the kind of stuff we do.
    Yeah, different.
    So, what are you gonna do, Barry?
    About work? I don't know.
    I want to do my part for The Hive, but I can't do it the way they want.
    I know how you feel.
    You do?
    Sure.
    My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.
    Really?
    My only interest is flowers.
    Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan.
    Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it?
    You're in Sheep Meadow!
    Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!
    No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once.
    Why do girls put rings on their toes?
    Why not?
    It's like putting a hat on your knee.
    Maybe I'll try that.
    You all right, ma'am?
    Oh, yeah. Fine.
    Just having two cups of coffee!
    Anyway, this has been great.
    Thanks for the coffee.
    Yeah, it's no trouble.
    Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life.
    Are you...?
    Can I take a piece of this with me?
    Sure! Here, have a crumb.
    Thanks!
    Yeah.
    All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not.
    OK, Barry.
    And thank you so much again... for before.
    Oh, that? That was nothing.
    Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...
    This can't possibly work.
    He's all set to go.
    We may as well try it.
    OK, Dave, pull the chute.
    Sounds amazing.
    It was amazing!
    It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life.
    Humans! I can't believe you were with humans!
    Giant, scary humans!
    What were they like?
    Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.
    They eat crazy giant things.
    They drive crazy.
    Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
    Some of them. But some of them don't.
    How'd you get back?
    Poodle.
    You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see.
    You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal.
    Well...
    Well?
    Well, I met someone.
    You did? Was she Bee-ish?
    A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
    No, no, no, not a wasp.
    Spider?
    I'm not attracted to spiders.
    I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face.
    So who is she?
    She's... human.
    No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law.
    Her name's Vanessa.
    Oh, boy.
    She's so nice. And she's a florist!
    Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!
    We're not dating.
    You're flying outside The Hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite!
    She saved my life! And she understands me.
    This is over!
    Eat this.
    This is not over! What was that?
    They call it a crumb.
    It was so stingin' stripey!
    And that's not what they eat.
    That's what falls off what they eat!
    You know what a Cinnabon is?
    No.
    It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up...
    Sit down!
    ...really hot!
    Listen to me!
    We are not them! We're us.
    There's us and there's them!
    Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning?
    There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me!
    You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee!
    Thinking bee.
    Thinking bee.
    Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
    There he is. He's in the pool.
    You know what your problem is, Barry?
    I gotta start thinking bee?
    How much longer will this go on?
    It's been three days! Why aren't you working?
    I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about.
    What life? You have no life!
    You have no job. You're barely a bee!
    Would it kill you to make a little honey?
    Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you.
    Martin, would you talk to him?
    Barry, I'm talking to you!
    You coming?
    Got everything?
    All set!
    Go ahead. I'll catch up.
    Don't be too long.
    Watch this!
    Vanessa!
    We're still here.
    I told you not to yell at him.
    He doesn't respond to yelling!
    Then why yell at me?
    Because you don't listen!
    I'm not listening to this.
    Sorry, I've gotta go.
    Where are you going?
    I'm meeting a friend.
    A girl? Is this why you can't decide?
    Bye.
    I just hope she's Bee-ish.
    They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena?
    To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream!
    Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering.
    A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events?
    No. All right, I've got one.
    How come you don't fly everywhere?
    It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster.
    Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
    All right, your turn.
    TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane!
    You don't have that?
    We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease.
    Oh, my.
    Dumb bees!
    You must want to sting all those jerks.
    We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us.
    So you have to watch your temper.
    Very carefully.
    You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust.
    Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?
    Yeah.
    What is wrong with you?!
    It's a bug.
    He's not bothering anybody.
    Get out of here, you creep!
    What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?
    Yeah, it was. How did you know?
    It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.
    You've really got that down to a science.
    I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
    I'll bet.
    What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this?
    How did this get here? cute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select?
    Is he that actor?
    I never heard of him.
    Why is this here?
    For people. We eat it.
    You don't have enough food of your own?
    Well, yes.
    How do you get it?
    Bees make it.
    I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it!
    There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing!
    It's organic.
    It's our-ganic!
    It's just honey, Barry.
    Just what?!
    Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing!
    You've taken our homes, schools,hospitals! This is all we have!
    And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this.
    I'm getting to the bottom of all of this!
    Hey, Hector. You almost done?
    Almost.
    He is here. I sense it.
    Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around.
    You're busted, box boy!
    I knew I heard something.
    So you can talk!
    I can talk. And now you'll start talking!
    Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier?
    I don't understand.
    I thought we were friends.
    The last thing we want to do is upset bees!
    You're too late! It's ours now!
    You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword!
    You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio!
    Where is the honey coming from? Tell me where!
    Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!
    Crazy person!
    What horrible thing has happened here?
    These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now
    they're on the road to nowhere!
    Just keep still.
    What? You're not dead?
    Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed?
    To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here.
    I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off!
    I'm going to Tacoma.
    And you?
    He really is dead.
    All right.
    Uh-oh!
    What is that?!
    Oh, no!
    A wiper! Triple blade!
    Triple blade?
    Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!
    Why does everything have
    to be so doggone clean?!
    How much do you people need to see?!
    Open your eyes!
    Stick your head out the window!
    From NPR News in Washington,
    I'm Carl Kasell.
    But don't kill no more bugs!
    Bee!
    Moose blood guy!!
    You hear something?
    Like what?
    Like tiny screaming.
    Turn off the radio.
    Whassup, bee boy?
    Hey, Blood.
    Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see.
    Wow!
    I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it. I mean, that honey's ours.
    Bees hang tight. We're all jammed in.
    It's a close community.
    Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own.
    What if you get in trouble?
    You a mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack!
    At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls.
    Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly. Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.
    You got to be kidding me!
    Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee!
    Hey, guys!
    Mooseblood!
    I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
    Did you bring your crazy straw?
    We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit.
    What is this place?
    A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead.
    They are pinheads!
    Pinhead.
    Check out the new smoker.
    Oh, sweet. That's the one you want. The Thomas 3000!
    Smoker?
    Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar. A couple breaths of this knocks them right out.
    They make the honey, and we make the money.
    ""They make the honey, and we make the money""?
    Oh, my!
    What's going on? Are you OK?
    Yeah. It doesn't last too long.
    Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls?
    Our queen was moved here. We had no choice.
    This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes! That's a drag queen!
    What is this?
    Oh, no!
    There's hundreds of them!
    Bee honey.
    Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale!
    This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something.
    Oh, Barry, stop.
    Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor.
    Do these look like rumors?
    That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos. How did you get mixed up in this?
    He's been talking to humans.
    What? Talking to humans?!
    He has a human girlfriend. And they make out!
    Make out? Barry!
    We do not.
    You wish you could.
    Whose side are you on?
    The bees!
    I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night.
    Barry, this is what you want to do with your life?
    I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees!
    Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked
    your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop.
    I remember that.
    What right do they have to our honey?
    We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!
    Even if it's true, what can one bee do?
    Sting them where it really hurts.
    In the face! The eye!
    That would hurt.
    No.
    Up the nose? That's a killer.
    There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters.
    Hive at Five, The Hive's only full-hour action news source.
    No more bee beards!
    With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk. Weather with Storm Stinger. Sports with Buzz Larvi. And Jeanette Chung.
    Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.
    And I'm Jeanette Ohung.
    A tri-county bee, Barry Benson, intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally!
    Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book, classy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon.
    Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.
    Did you ever think, ""I'm a kid from The Hive. I can't do this""?
    Bees have never been afraid to change the world.
    What about Bee Oolumbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?
    Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.
    We were thinking of stickball or candy stores.
    How old are you?
    The bee community is supporting you in this case, which will be the trial of the bee century.
    You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too.
    It's a common name. Next week...
    He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots...
    Next week...
    Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em.
    Bear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live.
    Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish.
    In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness!
    It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.
    Honey, her backhand's a joke!
    I'm not gonna take advantage of that?
    Quiet, please.
    Actual work going on here.
    Is that that same bee?
    Yes, it is!
    I'm helping him sue the human race.
    Hello.
    Hello, bee.
    This is Ken.
    Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.
    Why does he talk again?
    Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working.
    But it's our yogurt night!
    Bye-bye.
    Why is yogurt night so difficult?!
    You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours!
    Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help.
    Frosting...
    How many sugars?
    Just one. I try not to use the competition.
    So why are you helping me?
    Bees have good qualities. And it takes my mind off the shop. Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now.
    Those are great, if you're three.
    And artificial flowers.
    Oh, those just get me psychotic!
    Yeah, me too.
    Bent stingers, pointless pollination.
    Bees must hate those fake things!
    Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done.
    Maybe this could make up for it a little bit.
    This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
    I guess.
    You sure you want to go through with it?
    Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say, ""Honey, I'm home,"" without paying a royalty!
    It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan, where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak.
    What have we gotten into here, Barry?
    It's pretty big, isn't it?
    I can't believe how many humans don't work during the day.
    You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers?
    Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade.
    What's the matter?
    I don't know, I just got a chill.
    Well, if it isn't the bee team.
    You boys work on this?
    All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding.
    All right. Case number 4475,
    Superior Court of New York,
    Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry is now in session.
    Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively?
    A privilege.
    Mr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world?
    I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed.
    Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please.
    Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us.
    If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean.
    I would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches!
    Talking bee!
    How do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry?
    They could be using laser beams! Robotics! Ventriloquism! Cloning! For all we know, he could be on steroids!
    Mr. Benson?
    Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here. I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty important to me. It's important to all bees. We invented it! We make it. And we protect it with our lives.
    Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys!
    I'm hoping that, after this is all over, you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have but everything we are!
    I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice!
    Call your first witness.
    So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have.
    I suppose so.
    I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron!
    Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms.
    Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term.
    I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you?
    No.
    I couldn't hear you.
    No.
    No. Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey.
    They're very lovable creatures. Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.
    You mean like this?
    Bears kill bees!
    How'd you like his head crashing through your living room?! Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows! OK, that's enough. Take him away.
    So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me. Where have I heard it before?
    I was with a band called The Police.
    But you've never been a police officer, have you?
    No, I haven't.
    No, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example of bee culture casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance-about stage name.
    Oh, please.
    Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting? Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting. Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!
    That's not his real name?! You idiots!
    Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005.
    Thank you. Thank you.
    I see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow.
    I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?
    Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you? Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir?
    Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now!
    This isn't a goodfella.
    This is a badfella!
    Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?!
    Order in this court!
    You're all thinking it!
    Order! Order, I say!
    Say it!
    Mr. Liotta, please sit down!
    I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that. I think the jury's on our side.
    Are we doing everything right, legally?
    I'm a florist.
    Right. Well, here's to a great team.
    To a great team!
    Well, hello.
    Ken!
    Hello.
    I didn't think you were coming.
    No, I was just late I tried to call, but... the battery.
    I didn't want all this to go to waste,
    so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.
    Oh, that was lucky.
    There's a little left. I could heat it up.
    Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.
    So I hear you're quite a tennis player. I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby.

There's no point in debating that definition (the public's views - not as incompatibilist as you may think, see Ed Nahmias - are irrelevant to arrive at the truth anyway, because most would also define morality as magic rules from God but we can and should discuss morality without reference to God without apology).

This point becomes even more concrete when you define free will as 'could've done otherwise', that is, even though you agree I can choose tea or coffee, I should instead focus on the fact that in one particular instance I can only select one.

What's a possible rational theory on *how* my choices are supposed to manifest in this universe then? Should I be able to drink both tea or coffee at the exact same time in order to demonstrate free will? Or should the laws of physics bend depending on my selection of tea over coffee? This is *literally* defining free will as magic.

You cannot setup the test for free will as impossible magic. No one can jump 100 feet high, nor select both tea or coffee in the exact same instance. This proves nothing about the actual abilities humans have.

Here's at least one starting point against this absolute thinking: science itself does not arrive at any truths (including about the abilities of living things including humans) by getting fixated on that one particular instance of something. Nothing follows from this thinking (not even a good argument against free will). Probabilistic thinking is entirely built-in in any good epistemology, including in science and the way free will skeptics live their own lives.",0,1734782345.0,freewill,2,0.5,False
1hj8g0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/coloranalysis/comments/1hj8g0h/furniture_wood_tones_for_a_summer_palette/,Furniture Wood Tones for A Summer Palette ,"I'm a true summer (HoC Dark Brown Summer) and I want to decorate my house in my palette, but I'm struggling to find inspiration online and especially with what wood tone(s) to go with. I want to keep the wood tone as consistent as I can and add color via paint, linens, art, decorations, etc. I don't want white or gray furniture, I want to get wooden, unpainted items like for the dining and coffee tables, night stands, etc. I move a lot, so I'm not considering cabinets or floors or any of that right now because it changes.   
I was typed almost a year ago and have definitely struggled with accessories because I always opted for black shoes or bags and sometimes camel brown/tan, but neither of those look good AT ALL. Taupe is recommended most for summers, but cool taupe shoes and matching purses are surprisingly so hard to find?? Since I have the most contrast of the summer sub-seasons, I've found that a sort of dusty dark/chocolatey brown is easiest to find in nice items like leather bags and shoes and it's still subtler than black or warm browns.   
So all this to say, I was thinking of going with dark-ish dusty brown furniture in ""walnut"" shades, but that also seems to be a pain to find and match kind of like taupe accessories. I was also concerning natural wood, but a lot of it isn't protected or super sturdy. I have a couple mid-century style pieces made from teak and acacia and I adore them, but are those shades too warm for a summer palette? It's ""medium toned"" wood and I see those key words mentioned a lot in summer palette descriptions, so could it work if I used summer colors all around or am I reaching and need to find a better fit? Yes, I know I can do whatever I want, but I genuinely adore my palette and I need to get furniture anyway, so I want to take the time to create a home that harmonizes with me. I'd love to hear what you all think about the summer palette in general and if you've incorporated it into your home, as well as any other seasons who have done so.

They had me at 105% and I was holding my phone up in front of my face with my right hand to play a game on it, and the pulses were making my right hand twitch like I had Parkisons or something. I told the tech, she adjusted the placement and lowered me to 100%. The twitching was better but still there. It only happened when I held my phone up in my right hand. Maybe that's why? I held it up like that during my first 4 sessions and don't think I noticed the twitching before but maybe I just didn't care/notice because I hasn't seizure risk at that point, so yesterday I was just looking for off-feeling things.

Oh, then the machine shut off 9 minutes in. She comes in the room and says sometimes it doesn't get a good connection with females because of our hair. So that made me worry too ... like did it really shut off for that? She restarted it and finished the remaining 9 minutes.

Was really tired after yesterday's session again just like on Monday through Wednesday. On Thursdays session I felt okay after. But tired bad after yesterday's.

I just feel like I'm gonna be one of the unlucky ones who seize. I have no history of seizures, but I don't sleep well, I'm always an anxious wreck, and I'm exhausted physically and mentally, I'm an0rexic. Only med I take is Klonopin. I have a cup of coffee around 8am, take my Klonopin around 10am, and then my sessions are at 12. 

Was the twitching yesterday just cause of holding my phone in my right hand in front of my face? My arm wasn't twitching, just my hand.

My boyfriend ""30M"" is addicted to gaming and neglects all of his obligations. Any advice?","My boyfriend ""30M"" of six and a half years is addicted to gaming. He games from 8 to 14 hours daily no matter what other obligations he has. He is 30 years old and he managed to get his degree this year, after 10 years of being in college (He almost dropped out a few years ago). He never had an actual jod all these years but during the last four years he is trying to become a professional gamer/streamer with no success. (The money he makes so far are not enough to buy him even just his daily coffee). I (""30F"") work for 70 hours a week and I pay the rent and all the bills. (We live together for the last 8 months). Previously he used to live with his parents. I said to him I would hapilly pay the bills and the rent on my own for now as long as he tries to find a job and helps me with the housework. He cannot cook anything, not even boil an egg so the deal was that I would do the cooking and he would do the dishes. I come back from work in the afternoon and I find him sleeping and the used dishes from the last two days remain unwashed. Needless to say that I do everything else. He only does the dishes every two days and takes the rubbish out. I feel so angry and betrayed. Although he has very few job options because he is a 30 year old man with no previous experience, he has so many high standards: He doesn't want to work for too many hours (he would prefer a part time job), he idealy wants to work from home, he wouldn't do a job for very ""little"" money or a physically demanding job. (He refused two job offers because he found them physically demanding and because he wouldn't have enough time to game if he accepted). And this is not even my worst problem. The worst thing is he spends too little time with me. We barely communicate, we rarely have sex, we rarely watch a movie together and we almost never go out together. We never go to bed on the same time because he games all night long. (I go to bed at 01:00 and wake up at 08:00, he goes to bed at 06:00 and wakes up at 14:00) Sometimes he even makes loud noises while gaming during the night and wakes me up. I feel that he doesn't respect me. I am tired, I have to go to work the next morning and he still doesn't care. I have become so angry lately and I have said some nasty things to him, but it is so difficult for me. I feel depressed. And last but not least, he even accused me that because of me he has even less viewers on his streaming channel because he can't ""rage"" while streaming during the night and he is less fun to watch.
I love him and I would like to help him. But I don't think he actually wants my help. Any advice?

But, for some reason I just got the the desire to look at his phone, and see if he is really that faithful. He always tells me if someone hit on him or if someone messagef him, but I just had to look. 

After checking his phone it was mostly nothing, rxcept one message exchange.

A girl, waitress, from our friends coffee shop answered his WA story and told him that she was thinking of calling him to go get coffee and he answered next week since he is on a trip and winked emoji.

So I randomly asked him if he knew thia girl, I lied that I saw her on IG, and he fully lied and said no, then started coming up with stories how he remembered she works in the coffee shop bla bla. I was completely devastated and now I keep thinking they had something.

But how can I say where I saw their message exchange, also there were no other messages just those few and they were archived on WA. 

A day later I took his phone again and saw that he deleted her nunber but kept those messages and there were no calls made to her number, which makes me think he doesnt even know the messages are archived (maybe he didnt archive them on purpose).

I have no idea what to do now, my trust in him is completely shaken and I need advice, if any of you were in a similar situation. 

P.S. I wasnt fully correct in the relationship either, his best friend used to message me in a suggestive way but I never reciprocated but also havent told him so I dont ruin their relationship. But I never cheated on him virtually or in person.

Also his phone is always available and I have his phone password so this makes me think wtf is he doing.

A few months ago, I faced a frustrating issue: trying to sync my Outlook and Google Calendars (among others) seamlessly. I searched for solutions, but all the available tools were either too expensive or didn’t work quite right. So, I decided to build a solution for myself. I ended up creating a free tool that allows you to link and sync multiple calendars, including Outlook and Google, or even the same account across different platforms.

I made it free for everyone to use!

[https://calendary-sync.vercel.app/](https://calendary-sync.vercel.app/)

as someone from a third-world country, I know how hard it is to find affordable solutions to these everyday problems. So I built this tool to help others who might be facing the same issues I did – without having to pay for expensive subscriptions.

Now that it’s live, it works like a charm, and I’m proud of what I’ve built. If you find the tool useful and would like to support me in return (just a coffee to keep me coding), you can leave a small tip if you'd like. It would mean the world to me, and help me continue improving the tool.",0,1734780403.0,Outlook,1,0.5,False

Get good education on little money, get a good job and have friends around me that are like family, even though I do not have parents and have childhood PTSD.

About our situation, I've been with my husband (M44, ADHD/autism) since I was 19 and escaping an abusive household. He let me live with him and because of his help I could heal a bit and get my life together.
We also have have a kid together (4 yo). Our situation over the years is that I work full-time in a god paying job and he is stay at home parent, but our kid does go to daycare.

My husband has always had terrible temper with shouting and blaming and stomping around, smashing doors. He has hit me before which led to me almost leaving him and him getting adhd diagnosis (which he now uses to explain everything that he does wrong). 

A whole year he has done great with maybe 4 anger outbursts, but last night he woke me up at 3 am that het has spent the last hours awake and in anxiety because our couch delivery is now two weeks later and on top of that I didn't tell him I was going to go drink coffee with a friend.

He yelled at me, woke our child, basically a big tantrum calling me ungrateful bitch. Because of my history of abuse I was very scared. He said that I was in the wrong because he needed help and a conversation and I wasn't willing to do that at that moment. So he blamed me for all,I told him he needed a therapist and if something was vital then ofcourse I would get up and talk but this was not something that couldn't wait until morning.

So he left to walk and I got scared and had my baby by that time sleeping with me in bed so I closed the door and put a cabinet in front, because I can't trust him and I don't know what he's capable of.

We are very lucky to have enough for a good life, yet this kind of things are very toxic, especially for my child. I don't know what to do anymore because he doesn't look for help.

Please advice me on what to do? I can't just leave him because it'll be very expensive for me to pay for my and his housing. And I'm afraid of what he'll do,also I have investment bias seeing my age. I'm too old to start over.


Summary: husband has always had aggressive tendencies, at 3 am he woke me and our kid up shouting because of (minor) change in plans (he has adhd/autism) about me having coffee with a friend. Called me bitch and slammed doors scarring me. I locked myself with my son in bedroom to get through the night.",1,1734780322.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

mein Name ist Huynh Nguyen Vu, ich bin 24 Jahre alt und komme aus Vietnam. Mit diesem Schreiben bewerbe ich mich um eine Ausbildung zum Restaurantfachmann in Ihrem Betrieb. Ich bin sehr motiviert, in der Gastronomie zu arbeiten, und möchte mich beruflich weiterentwickeln. 

Mein Interesse an der Gastronomie begann, als ich während eines Projekts für ein Boutique-Café gearbeitet habe. Ich war dafür verantwortlich, neue Menüs, Verpackungen und Werbematerialien zu gestalten.

Die Ausbildung bei Ihnen bietet mir die Chance, die Gastronomie besser kennenzulernen. Ich bin sicher, dass die Arbeit in Ihrem Betrieb meine Designkenntnisse erweitert und mir zeigt, wie ich zum Erfolg eines Restaurants beitragen kann.

Zusätzlich zu meiner Designarbeit habe ich vier Monate mein eigenes Café, ""Dau Coffee"", geführt. Während dieser Zeit habe ich nicht nur Kunden betreut und den Lagerbestand verwaltet, sondern auch grundlegende Kenntnisse im Bereich der Kaffeezubereitung und im 
Barista-Handwerk erworben. Leider führten mangelnde Kommunikation und fehlende Struktur zum Scheitern des Cafés. Obwohl es nur von kurzer Dauer war, habe ich in dieser Zeit die große Bedeutung von klarer Kommunikation und effektiver Teamarbeit gelernt. Diese Erfahrung hat mich motiviert, diese Fähigkeiten weiterzuentwickeln und in meiner nächsten Position erfolgreich einzusetzen.
Ich bin ein zuverlässiger und engagierter Mensch, der bereit ist, hart zu arbeiten und neue Herausforderungen anzunehmen. Ich freue mich darauf, in einem internationalen Umfeld zu arbeiten und von den Besten in der Branche zu lernen.


Vielen Dank, dass Sie meine Bewerbung gelesen haben. Ich würde mich sehr freuen, Sie in einem persönlichen Gespräch kennenzulernen und mehr über die Möglichkeiten in Ihrem Unternehmen zu erfahren.

Sobrang torpe kong lalaki. I knew back then that there was something, pero takot ako ma-reject. She was my TOTGA.

Fast forward last year, 2023. I met her bestfriend. We had coffee and light snacks. Kumustahan na din and then she asked:

_“Bakit hindi mo pala tinuloy yung panliligaw mo kay J dati? Inaantay ka lang nya eh. Ayaw nya din kasing mag-assume dati kasi baka mabait ka lang talaga sa kanya pero gustong gusto ka nya. She was just waiting for you.”_

My heart sank. Gusto kong sumigaw sa loob ng Cafe Mary Grace. Although 15 years na din ang nakalipas, isa ito sa _What If?_ ko. 

Part of me wished na hindi ko nalang sana nadinig ang other side ng kwento.

—

About sa title nito, yes, ito na.

May na-meet ako sa office namin, sa kanya ko lang ulit naramdaman ang ganito. Kaya naisip ko na baka ito na yun. 15 years in the making, I won’t fumble this shit up.

One Sunday, I confessed to her. Btw, she’s leaving our workplace na for a new one come Jan 2025. Although she said she doesn’t mix professional and personal relationship, I asked again na _“next year wala na tayo sa isang company, any chances kaya?”_

She said _“I don’t know.”_

I replied again, _“well, optimistic akong tao, I’ll take this answer than a NO.”_

She answered _“No commitment on this one but you can ask next year… kung makikita mo pa ako hahahaha.”_

Sabi ko _“Yes!”_

…

She’s kinda preoccupied with a lot of things now. Turnover and hundreds of meetings kasi year end din.

She followed me din pala sa Instagram kahit sabi nya few weeks ago na _“Ok lang kahit naka-pin ang @ mo, hindi ko iu-unpin pero hindi ko din if-follow. Hahaha!”_

Context lang, sabi ko kasi i-follow nya ako, then nagbiro ako na _”Day 120 of reminding you to follow me.”_ 

She said _“Gawin nating 200 days.”_

Fast forward, not yet on day 200 but she already did.

…

We are exchanging convos sa IG at the moment, minsan sobrang high hopes na ito na yun, pero may gabi na sobrang dry talaga.

I’ve had my current setup (Micra/P64) for about a year and a half now, and up until recently I’ve only brewed medium roasted coffee without any issues. I grind, transfer to portable with collar, WDT, tap and tamp and this works wonders for a medium roasted coffee producing very little to no channeling or otherwise messy shots. 

However, I’m now getting into light roasts as I’ve figured out I much prefer the acidity, but I’m having some huge issues. It seems I can’t get a balanced shot, and I believe the culprit is channeling. Coffee I’m currently using is about 10 days off roast, and in the cup I can taste some acidity and tea like flavors, but also some horrid bitterness that comes from (I assume) some pretty bad channeling at the end of the pull.

My partner and I have plans tomorrow. It’s 3am. I can’t just leave. But I’m so anxious and I know I’ll be the bad guy if I up and leave or if I didn’t agree to this all in the first place. I feel like I can’t do anything either. Either I’m happy and comfortable and no one else is or I’m sacrificing my sanity and wellbeing for a fing sleep over. I don’t know what to do anymore. No one understands or believes me when I’m struggling with my autism because I’m an adult woman who “looks normal”. It’s not sensory issues or burn out, it’s being a bitch. And I don’t know what to do anymore. I really want to go home. ",5,1734779396.0,AutismInWomen,1,1.0,False
1hj7rfn,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelanceuk/comments/1hj7rfn/junior_graphic_designer_looking_for_advice_on/,Junior Graphic Designer: Looking for advice on large company disputing an invoice,"Hi folks, I'm hoping someone here could offer some advice. In October of this year, I completed a Social Media Carousel for a large coffee company and have been in a dispute regarding my invoice since. The company confirmed they were happy with my day rate of £140 with the estimated quote taking around 2.5 days.  

The brief required a 5-panel carousel with information spanning each slide. The brief was vague and feedback on initial drafts was slow, however, the work was completed to a high standard and within the deadline. A request for the brand guidelines was submitted however they were unable to provide this due to the lack of an up-to-date copy. Upon completion of the work, I noticed that the uploaded carousel had been edited drastically, removing almost all of the design work I had carried out - at no point were such drastic edits mentioned and I was clear in amending design elements should they be unhappy with the final submission. At no point were the new edits mentioned and now the company is disputing that, because the work was unusable, they are not willing to pay my invoice. 

For context, their dispute goes as follows:

There were accessibility issues due to text crossing over slides - (**Text had crossed over slides in multiple drafts and at no point was this raised as an accessibility concern)** 

**T**here were spelling errors - (**Two to be specific and it is common practice for clients to proofread before publishing)**

It's been two months now of back and forth and they have mentioned several things that have concerned me: 

They have said they were too busy at the time to offer feedback on the design and when the final design had been submitted, they needed to get the comms out immediately, therefore had to edit it themselves. 



They requested a breakdown of my hours which I provided and are now disputing the time it took to create the asset. The breakdown is as follows: 



||
||
|Date |Description |Unit (Hours)|Rate Per Hour (£)|Total (£)|
|23/10/24 |Research and Design Panning |3.5|20|70|
|24/10/24|Design Development (First Draft)|7.5|20|150|
|25/10/24|Revised Design (Second Draft)|7|20|140|
|28/10/24|Revised Design (Third Draft)|3|20|60|
|||||420|

Their response to the breakdown goes as follows: 

\- They feel the time spent is excessive given the scope of work. 

\- They have compared the rate to other designers they work with and the ""output does not align with the cost""

There were several design drafts created before the first submission and I'm struggling to keep advocating for my date rate which is below the UK national average (to my knowledge). They offered to pay £100 for the asset as that's what they deemed was appropriate which takes my day rate from £140 to £33 per day. Are companies allowed to not pay an invoice if they decide to go in a different direction? How do I manage this as a freelancer? 

It would be great to hear people's thoughts on this. I'm happy to send over the assets privately (if that's possible) as I'm apprehensive about making it public as the dispute is ongoing. 

Thank you for your time!

I have been taking cetirizine nightly for years now to circumvent bad allergies, so I would assume that I've developed some resistance to drowsiness/other side effects by now.

Curious if anyone has had this problem? Why does bupropion worsen drowsiness if taken alongside antihistamines?

Even if you haven't — would taking bupropion at night alongside the cetirizine help with the drowsiness (so I can sleep it off or be asleep during my drowsiest times given that the greatest concentration in your blood is apparently \~6 hours)?

Would taking it at night it prevent me from feeling the full benefits of bupropion?

------------------------  
  
# Introduction   
  
I have both the S6 Lite (2020) and the S6 Lite (2022). I have been using the S6 Lite (2022) as my main tablet for about a year and a half.  
  
It gets a very bad reputation on r/GalaxyTab and r/AndroidTablets.  
  
I think that the S6 Lite could be a better option than the S9 FE, but only under very narrow conditions. Here are the benefits of the S6 Lite:  
  
- includes a headphone jack  
  
- is cheaper than the S9 FE  
  
There are many drawbacks of the S6 Lite. Here are the main ones, in my experience:  
  
- It has only 4 GB of RAM. This is low enough that it causes lag, especially if you have many applications open or many web browsing tabs open. The lag is worst when switching between applications. (However, people say that OneUI 6.1 helped make the lag less bad, and I think they're correct. The lag on the 2020 version, which only received updates to OneUI 5.x, is worse).  
  
- The lightbleed on some units are so bad that it is distracting. In other words, some S6 Lite 2022 units will have very bad lightbleed, and some will have minimal lightbleed. You might want to buy from a place that you can return or exchange the tablet, or that lets you check how bad the tablet's lightbleed is first, before buying it.  
  
- The screen's maximum brightness isn't very, very bright, so using it in direct sunlight can be hard.  
  
- The screen does fade out when view at an angle. (See video I attached at the end). This is especially true when using the tablet at low brightness levels, in a room with not a lot of lighting. This, however, doesn't bother me at all.  
  
--------------  
  
The main advantage of the S6 Lite is that its S Pen is a pleasure to use, because the S Pen uses Wacom technology.  
  
- The S Pen makes handwriting and annotating PDFs a pleasure, because it feels very accurate, and line drawn seems to be directly ""on top"" of the glass, where the tip of the pen seems to touch directly the glass (ie, there is no gap of empty glass between the pen, and the ""ink"" of the line drawn). Lines drawn are crisp and not wobbly. You can also easily write in very small handwriting, when making annotations in the marginees of a PDF. \[My understanding is that all Samsung tablets in the S series have equally as good an S Pen experience, except that more high-end tablets have bluetooth-enabled S Pens that allows you to make Air Actions.\]  
  
- For notetaking, annotating PDFs, and making small sketches that don't have many layers, the S6 Lite is probably the cheapest option (that is easily avaiable) that still has an S Pen.  
  
  
----------------  
  
The S6 Lite (2022) was a good purchase for me.  
  
(The S6 Lite (2020) was also a good purchase, but its lag was too significant for split screen and pop-up views, that it made those two views too frustrating for me to use on the 2020 tablet. But on the 2022 tablet, I use those two views quite often.)  
  
For me, these simple tasks are what I do most; and the S6 Lite (2022)'s performance is adequate enough for me to enjoy doing these tasks:  
  
- Surfing the web (emailing, watching YouTube)  
  
- Typing in TextMaker. (I wrote this post in TextMaker, before copying it to reddit)  
  
- Annotating PDFs, reading ebooks  
  
- Learning French, including through ebooks and audio files; being able to easily and quickly look up words and translate sentences; the tablet lets me do this in ways that I can't on a laptop  
  
- Journalling by handwriting, and by typing  
  
Being able to do all these tasks in a portable way, in various locations (at the coffee shop, in bed, on the bus), has improved my life. Being even just to annotate PDFs has improved my reading comprehension a lot. The S6 Lite (2022), when paired with the Book Cover and bluetooth keyboard, allows me to do these tasks in ways that are at worst, productive with some slightly annoying lag, and at best, pleasurable. It is well worth the money I spent on it, and I have no need for a more powerful tablet (plus, I really appreciate the headphone jack, which newer S-series tablets removed, sadly).  
  
  
  
  
# Accessories that I Find Indespensible   
  
I use this tablet every day, but only because of two very important accessories: The (official Samsung) S6 Lite Book Cover, and an Artek Bluetooth keyboard ( [https://www.amazon.ca/Arteck-Adjustable-Brightness-Smartphone-Rechargeable/dp/B00X5P8BJO](https://www.amazon.ca/Arteck-Adjustable-Brightness-Smartphone-Rechargeable/dp/B00X5P8BJO) ).  
  
About the S6 Lite Book Cover:  
  
- The S6 Lite Book Cover helps me to easily rest the tablet on a table, when I'm reading in a coffee shop. There are two tilt angles that I can adjust the screen to have.  
  
- The S6 Lite Book Cover helps me to easily hold my tablet while waiting in line at the coffee shop, or even hold the tablet while reading it in bed. For me, it takes less effort to hold the tablet, by holding the book cover, than to hold the tablet without the book cover (see photos). This is true even though the Book Cover does add noticeable weight.  
  
- Another wonderful thing about the Book Cover, is that when I close the book, the display automatically shuts off, and when I open the book, the display automatically turns on.  
  
- There is a place inside the Book Cover to store the S Pen, so it is difficult to lose it.  
  
About the Artek keyboard:  
  
- The bluetooth keyboard's battery lasts for a long time (maybe 2 months?) when charged. It makes typing on the tablet very easy, using it sort of like a laptop.  
  
- The bluetooth keyboard magnetically clips onto the Book Cover, making it like a mini-laptop that is useable even when resting it on my lap, while riding the bus. (see photos)  
  
- I use Alt+Tab (just like in Windows) to switch between applications.  
  
  
I also use an old netbook case to store my tablet. (see photos) :  
  
- The netbook case is just somewhat larger than the tablet and keyboard. The keyboard is almost the same size as the tablet.  
  
- The netbook case has two zippers, going all the way around. I can 
emove and insert the tablet and keyboard from either a long edge or short edge, which is handy when the case and tablet are in my backpack.  
  
- I also can store a thin battery pack and USB charging cable in the netbook case.  
  
# Lightbleed   
  
Many units of the S6 Lite (2022) have bad lightbleed on the short edge that is close to the USB-C port.  
  
My understanding is that LCD screens work by backlighting the entire screen with white light. This white light is generated by small lights hidden underneath the bezel on that short edge.  
  
You can see examples of lightbleed in these two videos:  
   
- for the S6 Lite (2022), very bad lightbleed: [https://youtu.be/dklyMgCla\_M?si=2-B272P9hdR2uh7K&t=153](https://youtu.be/dklyMgCla_M?si=2-B272P9hdR2uh7K&t=153)  

- for the S6 Lite (2024), somewhat bad lightbleed : [https://youtu.be/CGEA1NZKlls?si=e-SxVRt4a0vTOz8L&t=145](https://youtu.be/CGEA1NZKlls?si=e-SxVRt4a0vTOz8L&t=145)  
  
My own S6 Lite (2020) had no lightbleed. My S6 Lite (2022), I bought a few months after it was released in Canada, and it had very bad lightbleed. Samsung's customer support over chat and over the phone, and at an official Samsung Repair Centre, refused to replace the screen or fix it. But, a third party repair centre for phones and tablets, that was liscened by Samsung to repair Samsung's products, fixed it for free under the 1 year warantee.  
  
Note that the screen along that short edge near the USB-C port, even on my 2020 and 2022 versions, looks slightly different, even though the lightbleed isn't there. In some angles of viewing my tablet, especially when the screen's brightness is turned down low, that edge for about a centimetre thickness along that edge looks slightly \*darker\* than the rest of the screen. I think all LCD backlit screens might have slightly different lighting on that edge, if you look for it.  
  
I just bought an S6 Lite (2024) which arrived in the mail today. I checked for lightbleed on it, and indeed it has some, but it is so minimal that I have to consciously look for it to see it, and under some angles and lighting conditions and screen brightness, I can't see it at all. Its lightbleed is so minimal that I don't think it will bother me.  
  
The lightbleed on the S6 Lite (2022), before I got it fixed, really \*did\* bother me, a lot. It was very distracting.  
  
  
  
# Lag   
  
The biggest reason to not get the S6 Lite (2022) is if you are annoyed by lag. The lag rarely bothers me, but it exist and it exists quite frequently.  
  
The lag in daily use for the S6 Lite (2022) is less severe than the S6 Lite (2020).  
  
My best guess is that most of the lag is caused by the low amount of RAM memory (4 GB). When many applications are open, those applications can't all be stored in the 4 GB of RAM , so they are stored in the Internal Memory (ie, where files are stored), which is slower.  
   
Here are some illustrations of the lag in the S6 Lite (2022)  
  
- Switching between open applications will have some lag. Switching between recently used applications will have less lag or no lag (eg switching between the same two applications).  
  
    - Switching into Samsung Notes, for some reason, has much worse lag than switching into any other application. Occassionally there is no lag when switching into Samsung Notes (especially if you very recently used Samsung Notes). But often, there is about a 1-7 second lag. And sometimes it's VERY bad; where the lag is something like 15 seconds.  
  
    - Switching into OneNote also typically has some lag. At best, no lag; typically about 1.5-2 seconds of lag, and at worst, maybe about 8 seconds of lag.  
  
    - Switching into other applications usually has between 0-6 seconds of lag.  
  
- Most of the time, when you're actually in an application, there is not too much lag. Browsing the web has minimal lag; scrolling heavy webpages might be slightly choppy, and switching Chrome tabs might have 0-3 seconds of lag. It is certainly not smooth like it would be on better tablets, but I don't really notice the choppiness. But there are some exceptions where the lag is so bad that it's very noticeable. For example:  
  
    - Typing in TextMaker has a constant lag for me. I touch-type at about 90-100 WPM. Textmaker will update its screen about 4-6 characters behind. (ie, I could type the word ""late"" in its completion, before TextMaker will display it). However, this lag doesn't bother me at all.  
  
    - Opening up YouTube to display the feed, will take maybe 4 to 8 seconds to load. Opening up a video will take maybe between 0.5 and 3 seconds to start playing the video, and an additional 0.5 to 4 seconds to load the comments and recommended videos. When scrolling down through the feed, new videos loading will sometimes cause the scrolling to pause for 0.5-1 seconds.  
  
    - Grocery store websites, for some reason, are VERY heavy. It can take more than 15 seconds for them to load for me.  
  
    - As expected, websites that require a lot of processing power are very choppy, such as websites like [zygotebody.com](http://zygotebody.com), which displays a 3D model of a human that you can rotate and zoom in, and lets look at the skeltons and muscles and organs.  
  
-----  
  
I strongly suspect that there are many instances of half-second or even one-second lag, that I don't even notice because I'm used to it and because I never used a faster tablet before, but that other people would be annoyed by.  
  
For me, the lag doesn't get in the way of enjoying the main tasks (reading ebooks, annotating PDFs, browsing the web) that make this tablet so useful to me. The exception is switching into Samsung Notes; it does get in the way of needing to jot down an idea, and waiting 10-15 seconds when switching into Samsung Notes. This is one reason I use OneNote more than before.  
  
# Other elements   


Drawbacks:  
  
- The front and back camera's aren't great. They are completely unsuitable for taking photos of my Visual Arts paintings to submit for school; the colours are very washed-out; the photos are somewhat blurry; and the colours are not accurate.  
  
- The front camera's placement is unfortunate. When the tablet is in landscape mode in the book cover, the front camera's placement is in the middle of the left short edge. This makes it so that if you are looking at the centre of the screen, and take a selfie photo, the photo will show your eyes looking to the side. This is also bad if you're in a video call; your recipient will see your eyes always looking to the side, instead of at them.  
  
- The S6 Lite, like the S9 FE, doesn't have a USB-C that supports video out. My understanding means that you cannot display the S6 Lite's screen onto an external monitor.  
  
- I've attached a video to show how the screen can look faded on some angles. (Note that my screen looks yellowish, because I set ""Eye comfort shield"" to ""Always on"", and at almost maximum yellow temperature). The fading, however, doesn't bother me at all. I hardly notice it in practice.
  
- The screen's maximum brightness is JUST bright enough for me to read my ebooks, with black text on white background, in direct sunlight in the summer. In other words, its max brightness is probably not high enough if you need to use the tablet in direct sunlight a lot.  
  
Neutral:  
  
- The two speakers seem plenty loud for me, but I don't have high need for loud sound. I have heard that people who play videogames by holding their tablet in their hands, sometimes are unhappy that their hands can cover the speakers.  
  
- For me, I love the screen size, because it is so portable. It feels effortless to read on this tablet on the bus or waiting in line at a coffee shop, etc. However, it is probably too small for some tasks that other people do, that I don't do:  
  
    - Visual artists might find the screen too small  
  
    - People who need to see a large amount of the page of their notes on one screen, and who need to move back and forth beteen their notes, might find the screen too small.  
  
    - People who need to do a lot of split-screen multitasking might find the screen too small. When taking notes when reading a PDF, I make the notetaking application take only about the bottom 2-3 inches of the screen, in order to leave a lot of space for the PDF. But this allows for only 2-4 lines of handwritten text visible for handwriting notes down.  
  
  
  
# Battery Life   
  
The battery lasted for about 9 hours in my normal usage, when it was new, but reduced quite a lot after a year and a half of usage:  
  
- When the tablet was new, at 100%, I could read an ebook (black text on white background) for about 5-6 hours, with maximum screen brightness, in bright outdoor light.  
  
- I estimate that normal usage (fairly low screen brightness, reading indoors, often with low lighting in my room), reading ebooks, typing notes, and watching YouTube, the tablet would last around 9 hours, on one charge to 100%.  
  
- It has been about a year and a half since I bought this tablet, and sadly, my battery seems to have lost a lot of its capacity. I estimate that my tablet only lasts about 7 hours on a charge to 100%, or even less. (I'm not sure; I have not tested it). I regret not using the battery health setting (that limits charging to 80%, in order to save battery health).  
  
Other notes:  
  
- I have read that AMOLED screens use less battery power, than the S6 Lite's LCD screen.  
  
# Tips and ways I use my tablet #  
  
- Not installing applications (or putting them to deep sleep) that run in the background, and want to update you with notifications, might help with reducing lag and reducing battery drain. Installing WhatsApp, for example, seems to have slowed down my tablet a little bit?  
  
- I liked turning off three window animations, in order to make the tablet feel less laggy. (To do this, first activate Developer Options, by opening up the home screen for Options (pull down the notifications / Quick Panel, and click the cog/gear icon), going to ""About Tablet"" > ""Software Information"", then tapping repeatedly ""Build Number"" about 10 times, until you get a message saying that the Developer Options have been unlocked. Then go back to the home screen for Options, go to Developer Options, flip the ""On"" switch in Developer Options if it's currently off, then scroll down a little more than halfway until you see options about Drawing. Find ""Window Animation Scale"", ""Transition Animation Scale"", and ""Animator Duration Scale"", and set each of those to ""Animation Off"")  
  
- I use GoodLock to automatically hide my navigation bar, and to make my icons bigger on the navigation bar. (See video) However, sadly, newer versions of GoodLock and NavStar don't allow this. I don't remember the steps I did to get this to work, but this my guess of what I might have done:  
  
    - Download GoodLock version 2.2.04.78, and install it. I think I downloaded it from apkmirror.com, but I might have downloaded it from apkpure.com instead. Then download NavStar version 6.0.00.16 and install it. Then I could go into GoodLock > NavStar, and change my navigation bar to have big icons showing currently opened applications, on the right. (I might have had to go to my tablet's Options > Display, and turn off ""Taskbar"" to make NavStar's settings work.)  
  
    - I also have QuickStar version [7.1.03.22](http://7.1.03.22) installed, to change the clock at the top of my screen to have ""a.m."" or ""p.m."" displaying.  
  
- I use split-screen view and pop-up view a lot. \[To use this, press the three vertical lines button the navigation bar, to show all open apps. Tap the icon of one of the apps you have open. You will see a menu that lets you open the app in pop up view, or in split screen view\]. For example, if I'm reading an ebook, I might have a note-taking app in pop-up view. I pop it down when reading the ebook, and pop it open when I want to take notes on the paragraph I just read in the ebook.  
  
- I use the Samsung Smart Select feature quite a bit, when taking notes. (Hover the S Pen onto the tablet's screen, but without touching the screen, and double click the S Pen's side button; then select the red icon with the white lasso). It lets me capture a rectangular area of a PDF, for example, and paste it into OneNotes. (It is unintuitive on how to do this, but once I figured it out, I could replicate it easily).  
  
# Some applications I use  
  
- For learning French:  
  
    - I use Moon+ Reader to read ebooks written in French. In its settings, I can set it so that I can highlight a sentence or word, and translate it using DeepL.com or WordReference.com  
  
    - I use yt-dlp on my laptop (or, occassionally, on my tablet using Termux and yt-dlp installed through Termux) to download YouTube videos. I then use a Whisper AI Google Colab helpfully written by someone else (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WLYoBvA3YNKQ0X2lC9udUOmjK7rZgAwr?usp=sharing) to make a transcript that is maybe 98% accurate, and save that to a file that I can read using TextMaker or Librera  
  
    - I use VLC media player application to watch the YouTube video when I don't have an internet connection.  
  
    - I extract the audio using yt-dlp of a downloaded YouTube video, and play it back using UpTempo, so I can try to increase my listening comprehension. UpTempo lets me reduce the speed down to even 5%, and to select small sections of audio (eg less than a second) to loop-repeat it, so I can imitate the accent to improve my vowel pronounciations.  
  
    - I install the DeepL and Wordreference applications, so that I can highlight words or text in Chrome, and then long press the highlighted selection, to easily translate that word or sentence. I like going into my tablet's Options > Accessibility > Interaction and Dexterity, and changing the ""Touch and hold delay"" to a very small 0.20 seconds, so that highlighting happens very quickly.  
  
    - I use the Anki application to learn vocabulary.  
  
- For annotating PDFs, I use Xodo  
  
- For reading most ebooks written in English, I also use Moon+ Reader, though I don't love how its annotations can't be exported. It seems that all ebook readers have their own proprietary formats for saving annotations, and none of them can export to a universal file format like RTF or HTML.  
  
    - I \*love\* Google's Literata font. It is perfect for increasing legibility for reading ebooks, even at a small font size. It is not intuitive on how to install it into Moon+ Reader, but it was worth the effort.  
  
    - For reading Shakespeare plays, I use ReadEra, becuase it displays the footnotes on the same page that the footnote is marked. However, it is a little buggy, about 5-10% of the time not displaying a footnote.  
  
- It is possible (for now) to force Chrome to use the desktop version of Google Sheets and Google Docs, by bookmarking or typing in a specific URL: ""https://docs.google.com/?fd=true"", AND setting Chrome to turn on ""Desktop Site"" in its menu options. However, the processor for the S6 Lite (2022) is weak enlugh that it makes Google Docs rather laggy, and Google Sheets almost unusably laggy. (And on the 2020, both Docs and Sheets were so laggy that I considered them unuseable).  
  
- I used to play Magic: the Gathering Arena. Loading the game (ie after tapping the icon) used to take maybe 5 minutes on the S6 Lite (2020), and maybe 3 minutes on the S6 Lite (2022); it was a significant difference. But after loading, the lag was so minimal that I didn't notice it. However, note that MtGA is a 2D card game; that is, it doesn't need a lot of processing power.  
  
- While I don't (yet) sketch on my tablet, here are some videos that might be helpful if you want to sketch on your tablet, to see what it is like on the S6 Lite:  
  
    - This visual artist is sketching on his S6 Lite (2020). He notices that zooming in and out is choppy, but drawing lines is not choppy. [https://youtu.be/t-INd2KbS1I?si=NxRrXDdoP30jQBjK&t=342](https://youtu.be/t-INd2KbS1I?si=NxRrXDdoP30jQBjK&t=342)  
  
    - Here is the same artist sketching on his S6 Lite (2022): [https://youtu.be/mbdu6ID93xA?si=xIXWCSS5Ff1ywOWy](https://youtu.be/mbdu6ID93xA?si=xIXWCSS5Ff1ywOWy)  
  
    - Brad Colbow ( [https://www.youtube.com/@thebradcolbow](https://www.youtube.com/@thebradcolbow) ) on YouTube is a visual artist who reviews tablets, especially android tablets, for drawing  
  
    - This visual artist is working on an S6 Lite (2020), with a drawing with over 60 layers. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuY9qSZRNOM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuY9qSZRNOM)  
  
    - There was a YouTube video that I can't find, but that I thought was quite useful. The visual artist worked on the same very large drawing project on different tablets, which helped him to compare the performance of different tablets. He noticed that tablets with low RAM, such as the S6 Lite, would crash if he was working with large canvasses and with many layers, but were useable if working on smaller canvasses and with not too many layers.  
  
# Can the S6 Lite (or other S series tablet) + Book Cover + Bluetooth Keyboard replace a laptop, for basic tasks?   
  
Not really, in my experience, and the issue is the limitations of the Android software that I've tried. There are many, many small frustrations, that add up to an overall frustrating experience. Here are some frustrations:  
  
- If you have an SD card inserted \[which I recommend! Storing books and videos is a big help when I know I have 500 GB of extra storage\], Chrome and Firefox won't let you choose what folder to save any downloads. They only allow you to save it to ""Internal Storage / Download"" or ""SD Card / Download"". It is a big hassle to have to move files from the ""Download"" folder, into their proper folder for organization.  
  
- The Sasmung File Explorer is frustrating for moving files. Every time you select files to move, it brings up a pop up to select the destination folder... but the menu always starts at ""Internal Storage / Download"". This means that if I have (for example) 25 ebook files in my ""SD Card / Downloads"" folder, and I want to sort them into various folders within the ""SD card / Books"" folder (eg subfolders such as ""Psychology"", ""Dance"", ""Visual Arts"", ""Programing"", ""French""), each of which, themselves, might have other subfolders, this takes a LONG time. Every time I need to move files, I have to navigate from ""Internal Storage / Download"" to the proper folder, like ""Sd Card / Books / Psychology / Therapy / Focusing""  
  
- Sending photos from my Galaxy S10 phone via bluetooth, to my tablet, dumps them all in ""Internal Storage / Download"". Renaming them and sorting through them is annoying and cumbersome, compared to a laptop. Again, Samsung's File Explorer is cumbersome.  
  
- Confusingly, in some applications, when nagivating to a file you want to open, ""sdcard"" means ""Internal Storage"", instead of the SD Card. Android seems to be filled with small, unintuitive bugs like this.  
  



Android software is much buggier than on Windows, or is unintuitive. Some examples:  

- When typing text using the keyboard in OneNote, the cursor will sometimes jump to the beginning of the paragraph abruptly, for no seeming reason. This causes you to type new text at the beginning of the paragraph! And at other times, the cursor will seem to update its position ""too slowly"", causing a bug where the cursor will go behind one letter. So for example, if I type the word ""Miracles"", the cursor might ""go behind"" the letter ""r"" after I type that letter, causing everything I type to behind a letter ""r""; for example, if I type ""Miracles Happen"", I could get ""Miacles Happenr"", with the curosr left blinking behind the ""r"".  
  
- Copying and Pasting using the keyboard sometimes just doesn't work, using the keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V. This is especially bad in Chrome, and especially annoying when working in Google Docs, given that Google Docs doesn't easily allow you to copy and paste in any other way.  
  
- Applications seem to not like telling you where they saved a file. For example, if I make a screenshot (hold power button and volume down button simultaneously), where is it stored? Both ""Internal Storage"" and ""SD Card"" each have folders called ""DCIM"", ""Download"", ""Pictures"", and ""Documents"". I have to hunt for the file, or hope that opening it in Gallery will tell me! How about when I make a Long Screenshot using Chrome? Where is it stored? (It's stored in a different place than making a screenshot!! And it doesn't even show up in Gallery!)  
  
- Adding a new keyboard language format is VERY unintuitive. It takes a lot of trial and error to figure it out. Also, there seems to be no keyboard layout that lets me type the ""oe"" ligature, on Android!  
  
    - On Windows, the ""English (US International)"" layout can type the ""oe"" ligature, but on Android, the ""English (US International)"" layout can type almost all the same characters as the Window's version .. except ""oe""!  
  
    - And, the French keyboard layout that can type the ""oe"" ligature (Canadian Multilingual Standard), is available on Windows, but is not available on Android, it seems? Suprisingly, the ""French (Canada)"" layout that is available on Android, is unable to type the ""oe"" ligature!""  
  
Android software misses many features, compared to Windows applications. 

- OneNote for Windows lets you, for example, have multiple notes open at the same time, and switch between them using tabs (just like you can do in Chrome). This allows you to quickly and repeately switch between notes and make comparisons.  
     
- There is no way to export bookmarks (eg to an .HTML file) in Chrome for Android, unlike Chrome for Windows. (It is possible to do this using ADB (Android Device Bridge) and a laptop computer, but this is a hassle)  
     
- Word Processing applications seem to lack featuers. TextMaker meets most of my needs (especially my need for a hotkey for ""Increase Indent"" and ""Decrease Indent""), but its ability to insert Images is so frustrating that I don't use it. (An Image must be saved as a file in order for TextMaker to insert it into a document; it cannot insert an image copied to the clipboard). Other word processing applications have better image manipulation, but are frusterating in other ways.

# How Optimized Images Impact Sponsored Placement Ads

# Increases Click-Through Rates (CTR)

Click-through rate (CTR) is one of the most important metrics Amazon uses to evaluate the performance of sponsored ads. 

An optimized image has a great story to tell. It also expresses the value or utility of the product rather than focusing on exhibiting it in isolation.

* For instance, take an ad for a fitness tracker. A generic tracker image might be enough, but a stark, high-res photo of the device strapped to a model’s wrist, tracking their heart while they jog, is far more powerful.

 That contextual adoption resonates right away with a customer’s search intent, increasing the likelihood of clicking on the ad.

Additionally, Amazon’s algorithm rewards ads with higher CTR by giving them better placements. Above-average engagement rate signals to Amazon that your ad resonates with shoppers, promoting it to more search result pages. 

With optimized listing images, sellers can create a virtuous cycle: more clicks lead to better ad placements, which in turn lead to more clicks.

Moreover, shoppers that clicked on visually-appealing ads are typically closer to making a buying decision. 

In competitive niches such as fashion or electronics, where an image’s impact is key, an optimized image can be the difference between a customer selecting your product or skipping right on by.

 Clear, vibrant and detailed listing images can make your ad twice as effective, particularly during high-traffic shopping seasons such as [Black Friday](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/whats-the-secret-to-winning-the-amazon-black-friday-battle/) or Prime Day.

 

# Improves Conversion Rates

High CTRs will bring customers to your product page, but only conversions can transform that traffic into revenue. Optimized images are your unsung salespeople, helping people answer their questions and address their concerns regarding the product out loud. 

Every customer loves to visualize how a product can complement their life, the more a customer can visualize a product in their life the more would be the chances of purchase!

* A lifestyle image, for instance, of a blender in action — mixing up fresh, colorful fruits in a crisp, modern kitchen — tells a shopper how to use it and fits aspirationally into his or her lifestyle. 

This type of imagery fills the gap between a customer’s curiosity and confidence by showing what the product i ando what it can do.

In fact, [conversion rates](http://www.inc.com/samuel-edwards/improve-ecommerce-conversion-rates-with-these-6-seo-tips.html) are the most critical metric in Amazon’s ad ranking system. And when your ads drive traffic but don’t convert, your CPC goes up, which means poorer ROI for your campaign. 

With high-quality images, customers get a better view of the product in many aspects and its applications, cutting the hassle of them looking for more information or comparing more products.

* A close-up shot revealing the powder’s texture, paired with a clear depiction of its nutritional label, appeals to health-conscious customers. When combined with lifestyle images of athletes using the product, it adds credibility and encourages purchases.

Apart from that, you can face negative reviews if your listing images are not optimized. Customer frustration usually arises from misleading or unclear visuals. 

 

# Builds Customer Trust

Trust is a key component of online shopping and visuals contribute in a big way towards establishing trust. Since shoppers can’t physically check the product quality, features and legitimacy, they rely on listing images. 

Blurry, low-quality, or deceptive images chip away at that trust and cause shoppers to either leave your ad and head to a competitors’ or question the legitimacy of your product.

An optimized image gives a touch of professionalism and reliability. A crisp, high-res photo of a luxury wristwatch shows enough detail of its components (the bezel, dial, strap stitching) in close-up to let you know that you’ve got quality on your hands. 

These details let customers know the seller is trustworthy and values providing a high-quality experience.

 

# Enhances Ad Relevance

Optimizing **listing images** is vital because it will help you convince searchers that your product is relevant to the keywords they are targeting in the sponsored campaigns. An image that visually matches their intended product is instantly eye catching and says suitability when customers search for.

* For example, an ad targeted to the keyword “organic skincare bundle” will succeed dramatically better if the listing images feature eco-friendly packaging, natural ingredients and certifications such as “USDA Organic” prominently. 

This alignment provides reassurance to customers that they have found precisely what they are looking for, resulting in a higher click-through rate.

Also, Amazon’s algorithm tends to rank ads higher if they obtain clicks and conversions consistently. Crispy, keyword-rich listing image content creates not only a pleasant visitor experience, but also a second chance in making the algorithm take your image as relevant.

 

# Meets Amazon’s Guidelines

Amazon has stringent standards regarding ad visuals, and sellers must adhere to the required specifications which include white backgrounds, minimum resolution thresholds, and a clearly visible product. 

This lack of compliance can lead to ad rejection or limits on what placements the ad will show, which can harm campaign performance.

* For instance, the protein powder seller has to upload listing pictures that meet Amazon’s technical standards. For the image, they must be out in the product in its original packaging (besides with a white backdrop), the labels must be readable, and there should not be a water mark.

 Meeting these standards will help to ensure the ad is approved and remains competitive, thereby protecting your investment in sponsored campaigns.

By following Amazon’s specific requirements for **listing images**, sellers will avoid any interruptions while maintaining professionalism and legitimacy in front of prospective buyers.

 

# Differentiates Your Product

* For example, let’s consider a high-end knife set. Rather than displaying the entire set, it captures close-ups of blade materials, ergonomic handles, and unique packaging that raise the quality perception.

 By adding an image to compare and contrast with cheaper alternatives it adds another layer of value proposition to persuade the customer to buy from you.

Standard **listing images** can make some flat products look less interesting, even when there are unique functionalities that visually highlight [Amazon product USPS.](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/5-best-ways-to-highlight-amazon-product-usps/) 

 

# Improves Ad ROI

Well-optimized **listing images** improve Amazon ads ROI directly. These visuals are maximized to get the most out of every dollar spent by increasing click-through rates and conversions. Not only this, but high-performing ads with high-quality visuals often get better placements, thereby reducing the cost of advertising even further.

* A pet food company that is advertising on Amazon. Lifestyle images — like a dog loving the food — create an emotional response in pet owners that drives clicks and conversions. 

This not only increases listing engagement, but also boosts the efficiency of the campaign as a whole.

 

# Drives Organic Ranking

Good performance from sponsored ads creates an uptick in organic visibility. Products that have great, click-attracting, and sell-worthy [listing images](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/is-amazon-penalizing-your-listings-for-low-quality-listing-images/) should naturally rise in Amazon’s organic rankings, getting more and more visibility.

* For example, one of the sponsored posts for a branded coffee maker with nice pictures just might edge above the rest. 

As sales rise, Amazon’s algorithm deems the product valuable and useful to shoppers, increasing its position in organic search results. A feedback loop ensues, in which optimized listing images enhance paid and organic performance.

 

# Strengthens Brand Identity

Besides, a brand identity builds trust and loyalty and consistent and professional listing images in all sponsored ads help to manage it. A well-defined visual identity makes your products more distinctive so that they stick in the consumer’s mind and encourages repeat purchases.

* For instance, a cosmetics company can utilize the same color palette and high-end packaging visuals in every commercial it runs, reinforcing its identity as a trustworthy and luxurious brand. This way images of high-quality **listing images** set a lasting impression and customers tend to choose the brand over that of competitors.

 

# Encourages Repeat Purchases

Well-optimized listing images aren’t just about driving first-time sales; they also help create long-term relationships. Using consistent brand imagery gives customers something to remember your product by and it increases the likelihood of repeat purchases.

One such kit that takes this to the next level is a meal prep kit with step by step in-use images of the product which can create familiarity and satisfaction When customers see the same **listing images** in future ads, they get reminded of the positive experience, leading to repeat orders.

 

# Reduces Return Rates

Clear and accurate listing photos will reduce return risk, since they increase customers’ understanding of what they are buying. It’s not uncommon for misleading or unclear visuals to create impressions that lead to dissatisfaction and ultimately, returns and negative reviews.

* For example, a photo of a backpack with clear measurements and close-ups of compartments allows customers to visualize how much someone can fit in the product and how it functions. Sellers can minimize return rates and improve customer satisfaction by offering complete visual information.

 

# How to Create Eye-Catching Listing Images

# For Related Items Placements

# Highlight Compatibility

It’s important to demonstrate how your product works well with other products when designing images for related item placements. This is a chance for some gentle cross-selling or up-selling, showing how your product works with goods that shoppers are already looking to purchase.

When customers shop, they are often looking for items that add to or complement what they already have in their cart. When you highlight compatibility visually, you immediately create a bond between the products and improve the chances of selling them as a bundle.

* For instance: There are many cases for smartphones, indicating how your smartphone case holds perfectly onto a popular smartphone model. If your case has more than one function (like a cardholder), show this by placing the case next to items you have that would fit perfectly in it (like a business card or a small amount of cash).

 

An alternative strategy that could also work well is to emphasize “add-on” or “bundle” offers that demonstrate with visuals how the products complement each other, cementing in the mind of the customer how those related products go together. 

* For example, next to a camera lens, display an image of a lens cleaning kit that illustrates maintenance compatibility.

 

# Customization by Season and Theme

Making your [product images](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/what-are-tips-for-amazon-fba-scroll-stopping-product-images/) relevant to the season or holidays will give them a significant increase in relevancy and usability. Adapting your imagery to the occasion infects customers with a feeling of relevance and urgency and connects your offering to the trends of the moment.

When shoppers feel like items resonate with the season, event or holiday they are preparing for, they are more likely to purchase products. This makes the product feel more personal and more in-time with their immediate needs.

* For instance, you could show a grilling tool set during the summer months alongside a barbecue setup in a sunny backyard. For the holiday season, you could depict a cozied-up kitchen set with a bakeware collection or a high-end coffee espresso machine, prepped for seasonal goodies.

Depending on your product, you could highlight your product in multiple seasonal contexts. A woolen blanket, for example, might be displayed in a winter holiday scene as well as a cool autumn evening to illustrate its use all year round.

 

# For Sponsored Placements

#  Use Action-Oriented Imagery

If you’re using sponsored placements, it makes sense to use action-focused images to get potential customers picturing themselves actively utilizing your products. Images of this nature make for a dynamic visual experience and encourage interaction, which means higher engagement.

Action-oriented images especially do well in demonstrating the utility of a product. This can make customers mentally visualize themselves using the product that can trigger interest and lead to conversions.

 

* Example: A camping tent advertisement should not just show the tent pitched at one point in time at one spot. But picture hikers pitching the tent at one of these beautiful outdoors and in motion.

This both depicts the tent in use and invokes a sense of adventure, tapping into consumers’ longing to be outside.

* Another Tip: Try to add motion to your [product imagery](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/01/pinterest-rolls-out-genai-tools-for-product-imagery-to-advertisers/) where you can; a drone lawn shot with a person actively using a gizmo, or for something such as a product like a bike pump, where it is in use when the yard application is in full motion.

 

# Implement Brand Storytelling

Brand storytelling via photo allows you to connect on an emotional level with your customers, making your sponsored ads more memorable. It’s about showing, not telling, your brand values, mission, or where your product belongs in the customer’s life.

Customer storytelling appeals to customers’ emotions, which helps build more powerful brand loyalty and increased intent to purchase. It focuses on the experience the product provides and extends beyond the features.

* For instance, for baby diaper ad, put an image of parents happily interacting with their baby in a calm, well-organized nursery. The touchy-feely warmth of the scene links product with care, comfort and love.
* Another strategy: Too many background elements that describe the product’s origin or philosophy should continue storytelling. For example, a sustainably sourced skincare brand might use imagery of nature, emphasizing the eco-friendly ethos behind the product.

 

# Focus on Target Demographics

It is vital for your [sponsored ads](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2024/01/23/three-tips-to-help-your-sponsored-ads-stand-out/) that the people in your visuals are relatable to your target audience, as this maximizes the effectiveness of the visuals. It can help diversify the audience while still retaining a focused line of the brand voice.

If your product speaks to a specific crowd, including people who look like your target demographic in the imagery helps build a sense of camaraderie. This enables customers to visualize themselves using the product, making the ad much more relatable.

* For instance, a fitness brand could showcase athletes of diverse skill levels all interacting with the same product. It broadens the appeal but also shows the product’s versatility, making shoppers feel like they might benefit from it, too.
* Alternative: Try utilizing diversity in your pictures, showing different ethnicities, genders and ages if your product is targeting a wide audience. This way, you can make your product attractive to multiple demographics.

 

# For Product Detail Pages

# 360-Degree Product Views

Providing several presentation angles for a product is a mandatory requirement for any Amazon product detail page. This way, shoppers can see the product up close, contributing to their trust and enhancing the shopping experience.

When shoppers can really inspect a product from all angles, they feel more confident in making a purchase. [360-Degree shots](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/product-photography-for-amazon-listings-exploring-flatlays-to-360-degree-shots/) build transparency, build trust and facilitate closing the sale.

* For a pair of shoes show the top-down, side, back and sole views. This is something that caters to buyers’ need to understand precisely what they are receiving, especially when it involves elements with fit and quality that can only be confirmed on time, for instance: fashion or shoes.
* Extra Approach: Include zoom feature for customers to see closer details on stitching, fabric quality and small things that make it unique (ex: logo positioning, materials tag)

 

# Break Down Key Features

Individual word descriptions can be supplemented with **listing images** that highlight specific product features which might make your product listing seem more informative and persuasive. It helps shoppers hone in on the attributes that are most important to them.

Close-up pictures that highlight critical details help Valentine’s World reassure potential buyers of the value and functionality of the product before any hesitations ever surface.

* For example, with a suitcase, use photos that focus on individual elements like compartments, handles, wheels, or zippers. This allows buyers to assess the functionality of the suitcase as well as its outward appearance.

(Infographics or close-up images of key features, such as a laptop with callouts highlighting the processor, screen quality and ports, can work well where products are tech-focused.)

 

# Making Products Look Premium with Amazon Professional Photography

# Focus on High-Resolution Images

[Amazon product photography](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/inside-look-why-amazon-product-photography-is-the-game-changer-you-didnt-know-you-needed/) has their requirements, which include high-resolution images (minimum 1000px in either height or width), but if that can be outfaced even higher quality images then your products will just look more in-depth and polished.

 Crisp and clear visuals help showcase your product in its best light, giving customers the opportunity to appreciate every fine detail.

A crystal clear image allows your customers to examine the product much as they would if they were holding it in their hands, leading to customer confidence that your product is in fact it claiming to be.

* For example — if we are photographing a high-end watch, we may linger on the careful design, the materials, the craftsmanship, everything that suggests luxury and artistry.

 

# Use Professional Lighting

The lighting is one of the aspects that dictate the quality of every product photo. For top-of-the-range products, soft diffused light helps you minimize harsh shadows and highlights and create a soft, even look. ‌

Lighting needs to highlight the main features of what you’re selling to also come off as well thought out and nice to see. Good lighting helps expose the texture, color, and quality of your product to make it look more inviting and premium.

* Example: with a skincare product, soft, natural lighting can give an elegant, premium vibe—and highlight the sleek packaging and smooth consistency of the product inside.

 

# Utilize Lifestyle Shots

Lifestyle images depict the product used in context and are critical for giving a product a sense of luxury and aspirational appeal. They demonstrate how your product can integrate into an aspirational lifestyle, showing viewers emotional benefit beyond functionality.

This lifestyle shot contextualizes the product by helping potential buyers picture themselves using the product. When done well, these images help elevate your product from simply being a commodity to positioning it as an exquisite experience.

* For instance, a premium coffee maker which is placed on the countertop of a chic kitchen along with a perfectly brewed coffee served in an elegant cup can evoke the ideal sense of premium living.

 

# Have Simple & Minimalist Backgrounds

Amazon does mandate a [white background](https://medium.com/@splento/ultimate-guide-to-white-background-product-photography-f3f1c1f6e4c1) for its image of the main product, but other shots can take advantage of mobile-friendly minimalist neutral-coloured backdrops. 

These backgrounds help keep the focus on the product and showcase the design of the product. This method can make products appear sleek, refined and luxurious.

Minimalist backdrops provide a polished appearance focused on just the product, adding a feeling of exclusivity and luxury.

* Example: For a luxury handbag, use a neutral background (beige or light colors) that contrasts with the bag’s rich texture and intricate details, putting the product in the center of attention.

 

# Show the Product’s Details

High-quality close-up shots of product details, like textures, stitching, or unique features, suggest quality craftsmanship. These photos help shoppers have respect for the care that sets your product apart.

Details instantly transform a product from average to premium as they convey craftsmanship and quality. Products from customers who can clearly view the quality of materials and construction will see the product as more valuable.

* Eg: A high-end leather wallet can show close-up images of its stitching, logo embossing, or soft underlay — to demonstrate its superior quality.

 

# Highlight Product Packaging

When it comes to premium products, the packaging is sometimes as important as the product. Packaging that is designed with care can elevate a product to look more premium and higher quality. High-quality **listing images** of the product packaged also help create a premium feel.

Upscale packaging is an integral piece of the luxury experience. Showing it in your images, solidifies the idea that customers are investing in something special.

* For e.g. A premium perfume bottle kept in a designer box with satin finishing and elegant velvet lining for the inside of the box feels high-end and the unboxing experience feels special.

 

# Incorporate Color Psychology

 

The colors have an enormous impact on the mood and aura of the visuals of your product. Premium products tend to feature darker, muted colors like deep hues of blue, gold, or black. They evoke feelings of luxury, elegance, and luxury.

The right color scheme in product photos can evoke feelings of sophistication and class, while also influencing buying decisions.

* For a good example, consider a luxury watch — a black background with gold accents creates a strong visual contrast that carries associations of refinement and exclusivity, while also showcasing the product’s premium materials.

 

# Maintain Consistent Branding

Taking professional photos also means making sure your product **listing images** look cohesive. By having consistent lighting, styling and backgrounds across your product range helps reinforce your brand’s premium identity.

 Consistent imagery helps build trust and recognition and creates the impression of a professional and trustworthy brand. This is essential for luxury/high-end products.

For example, a premium beauty company could apply a uniform lighting style with soft, pastel backgrounds across the product photos they try to make their [product line](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/amazon-fba-tools-and-strategies-for-expanding-your-product-line/) a sense of uniformity and level of luxury.

 

# Using Before-and-After Images for Demonstrating Effectiveness

Just like this, before-and-after **listing images** are one the most useful visual tools to showcase your product, benefits, and results. These enable prospective customers to see the effect or efficacy of a product at a direct level which can play a crucial role in making a purchase. 

 

# Featured Case Product Performance

Before-and-after images are also commonplace in industries like skincare, cleaning products, weight loss supplements, and other consumables to show visually that a particular product works. An apples-to-apples comparison, demonstrating the product’s value, can increase engagement and drive conversions.

* For example, an advertisement for a cleaning spray might show a before-and-after image of a dirty kitchen counter beside the clean counter after being cleaned with the spray. This enhances shoppers’ ability to visualize the product’s effect.

Why It Works: An image showing results proves the benefits of using the product, which increases trust and credibility.

 

# Establishing Authenticity

While presenting a before–after image, there should be plausible and authentic transformations. Recklessly using exaggerated or doctored images can breed skepticism or mistrust. 

* For example, a weight loss supplement may show a subtle but realistic change in a person’s body shape instead of a dramatic transformation.

Why It Works: When it comes to before-and-after images, authenticity resonates with shoppers, who value transparency and are likely to have more confidence in products that look as though they belong to the real world.

 

# Demonstrating Multiple Uses

Before-and-after images can show how versatile a product is, for products with several benefits. This can help you demonstrate how it addresses various customer needs across multiple scenarios.

* For instance, a multi-surface cleaner could display a before-and-after photo of a stove top and countertop to highlight its effectiveness on multiple surfaces.

Why It Works: Multiple before-and-after images help shoppers grasp how a product may work in different scenarios, which can amplify value perception.

 

# Incorporating Customer Testimonials

Before-and-after images are most effective when paired with authentic customer testimonials. This gives a personal experience which is sorry to say more credible than those made up claims, this validates that the product actually works.

* Example: If you sell a hair growth product, you can take a before-and-after photo of a customer’s hair, and then use their review of how long they used it and what it did for them, to go along with it.

Why It Works: Consumer-generated content enhances credibility, as it makes the transformation more relatable and believable, and therefore builds trust by consumers.

 

# Highlighting Time-Based Results

In the case of products that work over time, a before-and-after photo may show how things have improved over the months. Skincare products, such as anti-aging serums and acne treatments, are examples of products that take weeks or months to show effects.

* Example: A facial serum might show before and after photos of skin one month after using it, and another three months after using it, illustrating the results over time with consistent use of the product.

Why It Works: This lets potential customers know that the product delivers long-term benefits and not just instant gratification, and so appeals to buyers who want results that last.

 

# Ensuring Product Accessories Are Visible in Images

# Display Accessories in the Main Product Image

The primary image is the very first thing customers will notice as they explore your product page. Accessories are also a must in this image and should be kept as much as possible to attract their attention. 

If you’re selling a smartphone, include the case, charger, or headphones visible in the main product image, so your complete package is visible.

* Example: Camera bundle displays not just the camera body but also a lens, a camera bag and memory cards to give the buyer an idea of everything that comes in the packet.

Why It Works: By adding accessories in the primary image, customers can easily relate to what is included with their purchase and will make a quicker purchase decision.

 

# Highlight Accessories with Lifestyle Images

[Lifestyle images](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/mastering-the-balance-of-infographics-and-lifestyle-images-in-2024/) work best for depicting accessories that complement the primary product. These images are not only about the product, they showcase the environment and the way in which the product is consumed. 

* For example, for a kitchen appliance, show the appliance in a context where the accessories, such as its special blades or containers, are being utilized.
* An example would be a stand mixer used in a kitchen environment where the whisk attachment, dough hook, bowl etc. are all still visible and another example would be an automotive buffer used in a garage where the buffer head is still visible with the car.

Why It Works: Lifestyle images create a situation that customers can imagine themselves using the product and its accessories in real life. This makes it more likely that the buyer will see additional value.

 

# Add Additional Images of Accessories

Leverage this and add extra images that are only looking at the included accessories in your product. Detailed images of each accessory that could showcase their quality and characteristics.

* For example, a listing for home gym equipment should showcase close-up images of various attachments or accessories like resistance bands, adjustable dumbbell racks, or a workout bench—you can demonstrate how the design and material used should look up close.

Why It Works: Close-up shots of accessories ensure that the customer isn’t going to be confused on exactly what they are purchasing and can help enhance customer confidence in the purchase.

 

# Use Image Labels or Icons

Another underrated way to incorporate accessories is to add small, non-intrusive labels or icons to your images that draw attention to what you’re wearing. It highlights the extra value your product provides without overloading the image with a list of products.

* For instance, if you are selling a gardener tool kit, you can include small labels that say “included tools” next to the rake, trowel, and gloves in the product image.

Why It Works: Labels or icons help direct the shopper’s attention toward important accessories, so they don’t miss seeing what comes with the product. That will also help if a few of the accessories are smaller and might not be as easily seen in the larger image.

 

# Offer Information Specific to Accessories

You should also detail all the accessories that are included in the box in the product description or the bullet points. While this doesn’t directly impact the images, it does help customers know what they are getting when it comes to accessories to make sure that your accessory is included in the product search.

* For example, if you’re selling a camera and have a lens, memory card, tripod, or cleaning kit in the package, you can clarify that customers can find these accessories with the product.

Why It Works: Pairing images with comprehensive descriptions ensures customers understand everything they will receive as part of the purchase — which means that when they click on “buy,” they will make that sales-goal hit.

 

# Showing You Accessories in Use 

If Amazon permits, utilize interactive elements like a video or 360-degree views to display your product alongside its accessories. For customers, interactive images or videos enable them to interact and engage with the product and its accessories in a new way.

* For example, a portable speaker can have a [product video](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-maximize-your-amazon-product-video-on-amazon-fba/) showing the product itself and its charging dock and wireless case used together — it can show that each product complements the other and adds to the speaker’s portability.

Why It Works: Engaging links such as videos or 360-degree perspectives lead to an all-encompassing shopping experience, which confirms that the accessories are given time and consideration without excessive static images.

 

# Bundle Images for Cross-Promotion

If you sell product bundles that include accessories, you can use a bundle image to allow customers to visualize the entire package. This strategy is effective especially when these accessories offer distinct additional value to make the bundle more enticing than purchasing items individually.

* For instance, if you sell a drone kit with extra batteries, carrying case, and propeller guards, you might photograph the drone next to all the accessories so it’s easy to see the buyer is getting a better deal.

Why It Works: Whether the customer is buying the cost-effective complete image set, the bundle visual provides a strong sense of getting a better deal. This can lead to higher conversion rates by pulling customers with a complete bundle.

 

# Highlight Accessory Quality & Detail

Make sure your [Amazon images](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-turn-shoppers-into-buyers-with-killer-amazon-images/) match the high quality of your product’s accessories. Focus on the craftsmanship, the materials, the design — because customers might be willing to spend more on a higher quality item.

* For example, images of a leather bag may focus on the quality of stitching, hardware, and accessories like a keychain or dust cover.

Why It Works: High-quality, detail-focused images strengthen your product and accessories’ perception as premium products, helping you to appeal to buyers most concerned about quality.

 

# Show Accessories in Packaging

Packaging is another factor that reinforces the premium nature of the product, and demonstrates it to customers. This is particularly effective for gifts or items with branded or design-forward packaging.

* Example: A luxury skincare collection with a wardrobe of creams in a designer gift box (preferably clear packaging) to sample each applicator and the components.

Why It Works: Images of packaged offerings can enhance the perceived value associated with the product which gives customers the perception of exclusivity that is ideal for premium or highly giftable items.

 

# How to Add Video Content Alongside Optimized Images 

 This can include video content that can showcase your product’s functionality, add social proof and trustworthiness, and boost engagement. 

 

# Utilise Amazon’s A+ Content (Enhanced Brand Content)

Amazon’s A+ Content (previously Enhanced Brand Content for third-party sellers) lets you add rich media to your product images, including videos. 

This tool is available only for brand registered sellers and allows you to create visually appealing product detail pages with the option of adding both videos and optimized **listing images**.

 

How to Use:

* Quality product video – highlight features, benefits, or how to use video.
* Combine the video with high-quality, opportune listing images in a tailor-made layout.
* Make use of text overlays or captions within the video to emphasize important selling points as well.

For example, a listing for a fitness tracker might display a video showing a person exercising while wearing the tracker, then an image of the product showcasing its design, screen and highlights of your product.

 

# Make a Product Demo Video

The Pathfinder Project allows users to ensure that their work remains accessible, by leveraging data visualization to explore metrics such as the patterns of reuse of their data and the types of data being reused, which can provide critical visual context that static snapshots cannot. 

Finally, if your product has unique features or requires assembly, creating a demonstration video can help customers understand better and avoid hesitating.

 

How to Use:

* If applicable, add in a video that shows your product in action, like a camera tripod being set up or a portable blender being whizzed to make a smoothie.
* Include photos of the product in other formats, like close-ups or different angles that highlight features.

For example, if you were selling a camera, you might include a video of the camera in action, along with shots of the camera’s zoom function and close-ups of buttons, lenses and features.

 

# Upload Video In Video Shorts Section

You can upload videos as part of the product listing on Amazon, typically in the “Video Shorts” area or below the **listing images**. It allows the video to be pushed higher up without having to lose your typical image gallery for static visuals.

 

How to Use:

* Post a quick, short video to accompany your product images. The shorter the better, and do try to keep it under 60 seconds.
* Video may be dedicated to aspects such as how to set up your product, customer testimonials, real-life use, and pictures focus simply on giving detailed views of the product.

A set of luxury headphones, for instance, could start with a [short product video](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/build-your-brand-on-amazon-with-short-product-videos/) to showcase the immersive experience of the sound, then have images that show off the product’s materials and design and comfort features.

 

# Use Interactive Images with Embedded Video

For supported listings, you can now add interactive images that allow customers to click through to see a video, transforming static **listing images** into engaging media. These engaging elements work best for displaying intricate UP or lt; 3 D products.

 

How to Use:

* You can include an interactive image that you click to see a brief video of the product’s main features in action.
* Keep the media fairly standardized in quality and narrative to avoid a jarring user experience.

The image could open a video introducing potential customers to your vacuum’s powerful suction and compact design.

 

# Leverage Customer Testimonials and User-Generated Content

Videos of happy customer testimonials mean a lot in establishing trustworthiness. Tech demonstrations or testimonials on quality, functional utility, and ease of use — period different videos are recommended that show a real audience using your product.

 

How to Use:

* Include testimonial videos with images to give your product work the overall systematic approach.
* You can also add customer testimonials in video form showing how the product is used in practice.

For instance, a home coffee maker may include a clip of a customer showing how easy it is to use the product, alongside photos of the coffee maker from different angles, as well as closeups of the coffee-brewing process.

1hj7d40,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hj7d40,-11 degree without winter cloths ,"Some experiences in life are unforgettable and feel fresh even after years!
Cycling in the snow without any winter jacket is one such memory worth sharing.

April 2021

I was on a solo cycling expedition from Kanyakumari to Kashmir. After cycling across the country for 165 days, I finally reached Zero Point in Kashmir.

A couple of days before reaching Zero Point, I met five guys from Kerala who were walking to Kashmir. We connected easily as we shared similar travel experiences.

When we reached Zero Point, it was a lush green meadow with a small mountain covered in dirty snow. Indian tourists were enjoying the snow, as it was April. I decided to audaciously pitch my tent there, and the others agreed to join me.

Everything was fine until it started snowing.

At first, the tourists enjoyed the snowfall, but after a while, they started to leave. Within 30 minutes, it was just the three of us left—me, Vibin, and Pradeep. We became worried about the other two and started looking for them. That night, I was filled with guilt, feeling responsible for what was happening.

We were completely unprepared for the cold! It started snowing heavily for hours. I had no down jacket or proper winter clothing. Our tents were completely buried in snow, and the entire area turned white. We couldn’t see anything but snow.

The three of us held hands and wandered around, shivering, looking for help. At one point, we thought it was the end for us. Then, in the distance, we saw a faint light. We trudged through the heavy snow and found a commercial tent (a dhaba). We pleaded for shelter.

The owner told us they had very little space but, after constant pleading, agreed to accommodate just one person. The problem was, we were three. Since I was the only one who spoke Hindi, I considered going in. But something inside me said that if I went in, the others might not survive.

I asked Vibin to go inside instead. Now it was just Pradeep and me, wandering in the freezing cold. We consoled ourselves, thinking at least Vibin was safe.

In the distance, we spotted an empty commercial tent. We approached it hesitantly. When we got closer, we saw a Kashmiri man who welcomed us with open arms. We had tears in our eyes.

He asked us to remove our footwear and gave us three warm blankets. We couldn’t believe our luck. A few minutes later, Vibin came running back to us barefoot. He said he couldn’t understand what the people in the first tent told him and that they had asked him to leave.

Now all three of us were in the Kashmiri man’s tent. He gave us a basket full of burning coal to keep warm. In that moment, he felt like God to us. To our surprise, he also served us a large plate of dal rice (rice in lentil soup). We told him we didn’t have any money, as it was in our tent.

He smiled and said he didn’t ask for any money.

I cannot express that feeling in words. That night was so long, and our entire lives flashed before our eyes.

The next morning, he gave us warm coffee and handed me a Kashmiri pheran (a traditional Kashmiri dress) because I didn’t have proper winter clothes. Before we left, he gave us a warm hug and told us that it had been -11°C the previous night. If he hadn’t taken us in, we would have frozen to death.

When we returned to our tents, they were drenched and buried in snow, as was my cycle. After clearing the snow, I took a ride to check if my cycle was still functional, and Vibin captured a picture of me cycling in the snow.

As for the other two, they were safe in a store stockroom where they had gone to purchase water. They ended up spending the night among boxes of chips and biscuits.

To this day, the three of us remain good friends, and our journey continues!",15,1734777613.0,bicycling,5,0.78,False

Cycling in the snow without any winter jacket is one such memory worth sharing.

April 2021

I was on a solo cycling expedition from Kanyakumari to Kashmir. After cycling across the country for 165 days, I finally reached Zero Point in Kashmir.

A couple of days before reaching Zero Point, I met five guys from Kerala who were walking to Kashmir. We connected easily as we shared similar travel experiences.

From the early days of simple wooden tables to the modern, ergonomic designs seen in contemporary eateries, the evolution of restaurant furniture reflects broader shifts in culture, dining preferences, and design aesthetics. 

**This blog explores the fascinating transformation of restaurant furniture design over the decades.**

https://preview.redd.it/mlvbzks4j68e1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=93cd281262f6d3dc9a11b800ab2a0f94b8de4222

# Early Beginnings: The 19th Century

In the 19th century, restaurant furniture was simple and practical. Most eateries, especially in Europe and the United States, were designed with function in mind, providing guests with basic seating and dining options. Wooden tables and chairs were the most common, often made from sturdy hardwood to withstand heavy use. The design was minimal, focusing on durability rather than style.

The concept of the restaurant itself was also evolving during this time. The rise of cafés and bistros in Paris, for example, led to more formal dining spaces with simple, yet functional, furniture. These early establishments often used wooden tables with metal chairs, reflecting a blend of industrial and classic design elements. The furniture's primary function was to accommodate guests comfortably while they enjoyed their meals in a social setting.

# The Early 20th Century: Art Deco and Modernism

As the 20th century dawned, so did the rise of new design movements, which significantly impacted restaurant furniture. The Art Deco style, which emerged in the 1920s, brought with it a more glamorous approach to interior design. Restaurants, particularly those in urban centers, adopted sleek, geometric furniture with luxurious materials like chrome, lacquer, and exotic woods. Chairs and tables became more stylized, with bold lines and intricate detailing. These changes were a reflection of the optimism and modernity of the time, and they played a role in shaping the dining experience.

In the 1930s and 1940s, the emergence of modernism also influenced restaurant furniture. Modernist design prioritized simplicity, function, and clean lines. Furniture designs became more streamlined, moving away from ornate details in favor of minimalist aesthetics. The use of industrial materials like steel and aluminum became common, with furniture pieces that were not only functional but also easy to mass-produce. The introduction of modern, tubular steel chairs by designers such as Marcel Breuer revolutionized restaurant interiors, offering a lighter and more flexible alternative to traditional wooden seating.

# Post-War Era: Comfort and Casual Dining

The post-World War II era saw significant changes in restaurant furniture, largely due to the rise of fast food chains and a shift toward more casual dining experiences. The 1950s and 1960s brought about a focus on comfort and accessibility, as dining out became a more regular activity for families and individuals alike. Upholstered seating became more common, with booths and padded chairs offering guests a more relaxed dining experience.

The emergence of diners and fast food establishments in the 1950s also led to a shift in design priorities. Bright, vibrant colors, chrome accents, and plastic materials became popular, reflecting the optimism and consumer-driven culture of the era. Vinyl-covered chairs and Formica tables became staples in casual dining spaces, and restaurant furniture became more standardized and affordable for larger chains.

# 1970s-1980s: Eclectic and Experimental Designs

In the 1970s and 1980s, restaurant furniture design became more experimental, as designers embraced a range of eclectic styles. This era saw a mix of retro, rustic, and industrial influences in restaurant interiors. The use of natural materials like wood and stone, along with bold patterns and textures, added a new dimension to dining spaces. Restaurants began experimenting with unconventional seating arrangements, incorporating lounge-style seating, curved booths, and communal tables.

The rise of themed restaurants also influenced furniture design during this time. Establishments like TGI Friday's and Hard Rock Café introduced furniture that complemented the overall theme of the restaurant, often incorporating memorabilia, neon signs, and quirky seating designs. The furniture was often more playful and less formal, creating a more relaxed atmosphere for diners.

# 1990s-2000s: Sleek and Functional

The 1990s and early 2000s ushered in an era of sleek, functional design that prioritized comfort without sacrificing style. As dining preferences became more diverse and global, restaurant furniture adapted to reflect a range of culinary experiences. Minimalist design gained popularity, with clean lines, neutral colors, and materials like glass, steel, and leather becoming common in upscale restaurants.

Furniture design during this period also became more ergonomic, with attention to comfort and durability. Chairs and tables were designed not only for aesthetic appeal but also for ease of use over long dining periods. The rise of casual dining chains, such as Starbucks, also influenced furniture design, as cafes and coffee shops became gathering spaces for both work and leisure. The furniture in these spaces was designed for both comfort and functionality, with a focus on creating flexible environments that could cater to different needs.

# The 2010s to Present: Sustainable and Customizable

In the last decade, restaurant furniture design has been greatly influenced by the growing demand for sustainability and personalization. With increasing awareness about environmental issues, many restaurants have turned to eco-friendly materials, such as reclaimed wood, recycled metals, and biodegradable plastics, for their furniture. The use of sustainable design principles in restaurant furniture not only helps reduce environmental impact but also appeals to a more conscientious consumer base.

Another significant trend in recent years is the emphasis on customization. Restaurants today are increasingly adopting bespoke furniture designs that reflect their brand identity and the dining experience they want to offer. Whether it's through customizable seating arrangements or tables that cater to different group sizes, restaurant furniture is being designed to create a more personalized and intimate atmosphere.

# Conclusion

From the simple wooden tables of the 19th century to the sleek, sustainable designs of today, restaurant furniture has undergone a remarkable transformation. Each era's unique design preferences and social trends have shaped how furniture is created and used in dining establishments. As the restaurant industry continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more innovation in furniture design, blending functionality with style, comfort, and sustainability.",1,1734777190.0,u_One_Scallion_6415,0,1.0,False

**Let me introduce to you, what I believe is King.**

The market just had a massive correction the last few days and saw billions wiped out. Everything crashed and saw negative.

Kendu though, well we gained holders, outperformed the whole market and just simply kept working. It is a community of diamond hands and genuine 100B believers who know what they hold, with us having now developed a concrete floor where realistically there is ONLY upside.

Kendu has just become 2nd of all time, out of millions (13 million in 2024 alone) to complete the massive 50 000 certik votes organically, only behind Pepe which is 10B+ now.

The agreement has now been signed on both ends, with Certik being so impressed by our community that they will begin doing an awareness campaign for us. A memecoin literally being shilled by an audit company.

We are also only 1 of 2 memecoins in existence with our own dedicated stocktwits page. Them also consistently making posts on X about Kendu being in the top 10-5 most active cryptos on all of stocktwits. The CEO of the company even just mentioned the Kendu ticker in one of his posts.

Not only do we dominate the digital scape though, but we have transcended beyond ""memecoin""

Our community knows that it is a game of awareness, so we do exactly that.

We also have branding that is simply not seen elsewhere in memes, such as our energy drinks that can be seen in front of the mural.

This isnt just an isolated performance though, with IRL and branding being our game.

we have just had a new addition to our products, Kendu Gum. Thats now alongside our jewellery, hot sauce, coffee beans and even a protein supplement range on the whey.

This is what sets the community apart. This is why the kendu army thrives and is destined for greatness.

All of this is decentralised community effort, all individuals initiatives who know Kendu is going to the billions this cycle, and who know Kendu is their ticket to financial freedom.

Kendu is more than just a memecoin. We are a genuine movement with branding and products alike.

Our ethos is ""we do not gamble, we work"" and we are using the Kendu canvas to paint our wildest imaginations.

so how do you make the judgement on what is truly good? I have seen so many communities claiming ""Mine is the best! we are different!""

Thats not to mention how many are made on a daily basis,

""Every day, between 40,000 and 50,000 new meme coins are created, according to BDC, an Estonia-based blockchain consultancy. Nearly 13 million have already been created in 2024""

So how do you determine what is best?

There often remains a clear lack of alpha, genuine content and general conviction in the shilling methods I see. Just AI images that dont reveal anything.

**Let me introduce to you, what I believe is King.**

The market just had a massive correction the last few days and saw billions wiped out. Everything crashed and saw negative.

Kendu though, well we gained holders, outperformed the whole market and just simply kept working. It is a community of diamond hands and genuine 100B believers who know what they hold, with us having now developed a concrete floor where realistically there is ONLY upside.

Kendu has just become 2nd of all time, out of millions (13 million in 2024 alone) to complete the massive 50 000 certik votes organically, only behind Pepe which is 10B+ now.

The agreement has now been signed on both ends, with Certik being so impressed by our community that they will begin doing an awareness campaign for us. A memecoin literally being shilled by an audit company.

We are also only 1 of 2 memecoins in existence with our own dedicated stocktwits page. Them also consistently making posts on X about Kendu being in the top 10-5 most active cryptos on all of stocktwits. The CEO of the company even just mentioned the Kendu ticker in one of his posts.

Not only do we dominate the digital scape though, but we have transcended beyond ""memecoin""

Our community knows that it is a game of awareness, so we do exactly that.

Recently one of our community members (OG chadette who helped run up Shiba inu to the billions) is smashing out murals in the middle of Miami.

She attended the Miami Art Basel event handing out hundreds of our energy drinks cans, and placing this painting right on one of the busiest intersections where it will now remain.

We also have branding that is simply not seen elsewhere in memes, such as our energy drinks that can be seen in front of the mural.

This isnt just an isolated performance though, with IRL and branding being our game.

we have just had a new addition to our products, Kendu Gum. Thats now alongside our jewellery, hot sauce, coffee beans and even a protein supplement range on the whey.

We have chads literally jumping out of planes, 12 community tattoos (one on a guys willy), people climbing off buildings, smashing plates and going out on the streets everyday all in the name of getting Kendu to be number 1.

[Community Work](https://preview.redd.it/w0b7gha7i68e1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=f80ab921168799e106c8a1cfb4465837920bf3c3)

This is what sets the community apart. This is why the kendu army thrives and is destined for greatness.

All of this is decentralised community effort, all individuals initiatives who know Kendu is going to the billions this cycle, and who know Kendu is their ticket to financial freedom.

Kendu is more than just a memecoin. We are a genuine movement with branding and products alike.

Our ethos is ""we do not gamble, we work"" and we are using the Kendu canvas to paint our wildest imaginations.

1hj77jh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndia/comments/1hj77jh/office_bait_or_a_genuine_need/,Office Bait or a Genuine Need?,"Some months back, I befriended one of my colleagues. Although she works in a junior position in a different department, she is an absolutely stunning, attractive woman. Thus I always found a reason to somehow end up having an evening chai or snacks with her (Yeah, my dick does the thinking).

This friendship quickly developed into a situationship of sorts wherein we were having movie dates, coffee dates, dinners, and sleepovers. She told me that she had been divorced a couple of years ago (no kids) and I was cool with that. Everything was going smoothly, and given the chemistry, I was having a really good time. 

One fine day, she asked me for 30k for an emergency saying that she would return it on receiving her next salary. I didn't mind and transferred the amount without hesitation. 

The next month arrived, but she didn't return. On the contrary, she asked me for another 25k, and before I could say anything she admitted that she remembered that she had to return the previous amount. 'My dad is not well, and there's no one who will support me', is what I got instead of the money. What I felt fishy was that every time we spoke about families, she never mentioned her dad's illness even once. 

This was also taken with a 'Seh lege thoda', but then I noticed subtle changes. The chemistry vanished quicker than a rat, and she kinda started ignoring me. I was still cool with this, but hey I needed my money back. So, in a week, I asked her twice when is she gonna return the sum. 

She calls by on the weekend and asks me to come over. I, again, did the dick-thinking and went over. We had really good sex that night and the money matter was buried six feet deep. It followed a very sweet, thoughtful conversation which again threw me on the bus of 'she's so compatible with me'. 

The bells rang again when she asked for another 50k last week. I have been connecting the dots now, and it seems that it's only about money at the back of all of it. I gave her pretty stupid excuses about why I can't lend the extra 50k, but there's been a lot of sobbing on the call now. 

I am in a dilemma where a part of me thinks that she is genuinely in need too. But I also have a feeling ke mera katt raha hai.  Which one is it?

But I am not sure if its the right time or if she has a partner.,"What is the best way to ask a woman if she have a partner?

There’s this woman I occasionally work with whenever I’m assigned to her site. She’s always smiling and laughing at everything I do maybe she just finds me funny. The second time we worked together, I decided to hold eye contact, and she looked right back at me as we talked about random things in life. I’m not sure if it means she’s genuinely attracted to me, and I don’t want to assume.

Last night, I told my friends that the next time I work with her, I’m thinking of asking her out for coffee or maybe inviting her to watch a movie. I figured that if she already has a partner, she’d probably mention it once I ask. My male friends think this is a solid plan. However, my female friends say it might not be the best move, since we’ve never really flirted, and (according to them) there’s no real “sexual tension” which they say is very important. They suggested talking to her about the holidays first, then casually asking if she has a partner.

I worry that directly asking if she has a partner might make me look creepy, but my female friends insist that’s how I can show genuine interest and possibly start flirting naturally. They also pointed out that asking her out before any flirting might come across as awkward or even creepy.

What do you all think? Should I just go for it, or am I imagining things and she’s just being nice? I’m a bit scared it’s all in my head.

Additional context:
I’m not entirely sure if she’s straight, since her style is on the boyish side. We’ve only worked together twice in the last five months, and we’ll be working together for the third time in January. After that, who knows when we’ll see each other again she might move on to a different job. I’m not the best at dating or attracting women, but I’m trying 😔",1,1734776484.0,dating_advice,4,0.67,False
