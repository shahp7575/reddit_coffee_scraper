She seems kinda shy and introverted if that matters. The only problem is I sit all the way across the room (full class) and I've never talked to her (maybe complimented a band on a shirt she was wearing once a few semesters ago, but I don't remember). 

I've thought about just introducing myself quickly after class and handing her a note with a bit about myself and my number asking to go out for lunch/coffee/do HW together in the library. My reasoning for this approach was, IF she IS shy, I don't want to box her in and make her uncomfortable; I'd rather give her the opportunity to read it alone on her own time (and also I'm too nervous lol).

Does anybody have any tips?? Should I try to chat with some of the members of her group, and see if i can get to know her thru them or would that be a scummy thing to do?

I am simply here because I find myself texting my real life friends and siblings but rarely get the enthusiasm and attention I am seeking. I know everyone has their own life but I seem to always be there for them and whenever I am excited about something, they disappear. 

With that said, I am a divorced mother trying to navigate the dried up dating scene. I have good days and bad days. I’d love to have people to talk to and feel comfortable with.

Here are some interests of mine, so if we share similar interests, please feel free to message me: gardening, houseplants, baking, painting, self care, coffee (if you are knowledgeable about making homemade cold brew, move to the front of the line!), video games (Minecraft (java), Civ6 (yes, getting Civ7 next month), Splatoon 3, Mario Party Jamboree), traveling to tropical places, shopping, and I’m sure there are more!

I hope everyone reading has a great day and ends up finding the friend(s) they’ve been searching for. ❤️",1,1738197845.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

I need advice. I’m a 33 year old female. Sagittarius sun, Sagittarius moon and and Cancer rising. He is a 37 year old male. Scorpio sun and moon (not sure of his rising sign). I’ve been with this man almost 3 years. The thing is we aren’t really together anymore. When we first met I was skinny, active and happy. September of 2022. We started dating and he soon engulfed me in his pit of misery. We went on one “date” to the local Mexican restaurant. Other than that, we sat at his house chugging beer/shots and playing video games. And it would always end badly. He wants to play a particular game and I don’t so he throws a fit and flips over the coffee table in rage. But we’ve continued hanging out. All of this time. I gained a lot of weight over the last 3 years, almost 100 pounds. Mainly because of depression and sitting around drinking beer playing video games on the couch with him. He told me maybe 1.5 years ago he wasnt attracted to me anymore. Sexually. That he loved me and my personality but he just couldn’t have sex with me because I was “big” now. So we havent had any physical contact other than pecks on the lips/cheek in well over a year. I should have left then. The thing is, he’s also my best friend. We still hang out multiple times a week, playing video games and smoking/drinking. We talk every day, all day. Good morning, I love you, goodnight etc. We talk every day about all kinds of things, family stuff, we watch the same sports and we do have a lot in common. But when we get together with alcohol, which is every time we hang out, it almost always turns bad. We will have weeks sometimes where we just chill, but even then he guilt trips me when I don’t want to come see him (currently) it’s just been a horrible experience and I know I need to cut ties all together but it’s hard because he’s like my best friend. Any advice? He also lives like 10 mins away from me, which makes this even more awkward. This is my very first Reddit post ever, I just don’t know how to do this. Thank you for any help.

1id9iid,https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1id9iid/final_day_in_medellín_a_mixed_bag_at_my_favourite/,Final day in Medellín: a mixed bag at my favourite café,"I'm near the end of my trip and decided to go to the café in El Poblado that I visited 40+ times during my first trip to Colombia. I went there so, so many times because the staff were very tolerant of my poor Spanish during that trip and I wasn't forced to speak English. The goal was to get them to speak normally to me. To not change their phrasing, the words they used or the speed at which they spoke. In other words, to treat me like a local. The time I spent there was a mixed bag. 

I've always been treated the same by them, during both visits. That's to say like a Spanish learner at a low level. It's not their job to monitor my level in Spanish and they probably don't care all that much about one guy's progress. Honestly, I was surprised that they all remembered me 6 months after my first trip.

I'm not going to share the name of the place. It's small, few people work there and the people I meet haven't agreed to such things.

Naturally, as much as people in this situation may want to help, they're busy. They have dozens of customers during a normal day and they're paid to serve coffee and baked goods, not to cater to my Spanish needs.

I asked them to speak to me in the way I described and there was no problem with my interactions with them. I understood everything perfectly. I screwed up a question simply because I had no idea how to phrase one thing in particular, but that was all. Again, though, these interactions weren't 10-minute conversations. You don't always get what you want.

The negatives of this experience were all down to the location; it's in El Poblado, the most touristy part of the city. As a result, I had to hear some of their customers speaking English.
I briefly interacted - in Spsnish - with a customer who was clearly a native speaker, but she was joined by a very white person who clearly was not. I didn't use English in this place and it would take a lot to force me to do so.

The aforementioned very white woman was complaining during her conversation about how touristy Colombia is. In English. That cracked me up because she's white AF, clearly a tourist and only speaking English. In El Poblado. Complain in Spanish, sure, but if you only speak English and are clearly a tourist, you blatantly lack self-awareness in this situation. It was hilarious and of course frustrating to hear these people speaking English.

On the other hand, a married couple who some of the employees obviously knew came in and the wife started talking about her new dietary restrictions. This included not being allowed to eat bread. I interjected and asked if this included arepas. The husband said yes and I said that half my gut/extra weight was due to arepas. The response was ""do you swear?"" which is somewhat odd phrasing to me, but not everything translates well. The point is that I understood the whole conversation and I was completely understood when I interrupted.

I'll explain why in more detail in my trip report, but I would generally recommend that Spanish learners avoid El Poblado. Medellín is a huge city with many zones and many of them are lovely.

I have a flight to Bogotá early tomorrow morning and 4 nights there before my flights to Barcelona and then back to the UK. I stayed with the same hosts at the end of my first trip, so I hope they'll notice a difference in my Spanish!",3,1738197586.0,dreamingspanish,0,1.0,False

Waffle House, an icon of American midwestern and southern culture. Often, it’s yellow glow is a beacon of hope to those late night dwellers, whether they be members of the working class or alcohol favoring partiers. Druggos are also a staple clientele. Waffle House, for better or worse, opens its doors to everyone from every walk of life. 

I will set the scene: it’s a late Thursday night, or early Friday morning in technicality, and I was heading home from a late night bender where I had the important but ultimately boring job of designated driver. All I wanted to do was go home and crack open a cold one for myself to kick off my weekend. Nature had other plans, however. The weather in the midsouth turned on a dime, and tonight was no exception. A downpour diminished any visibility on the road, and I knew I couldn’t confidently drive through this. The familiar yellow glow shone through the onslaught of rain and hail, however, and given that Waffle House will probably remain open under threat of nuclear war, I knew I could seek refuge there. 

The jingling bells welcomed me more than any employee did, but I could not blame them. The restaurant was a mess, probably from a busy evening earlier. The rodeo was this weekend, after all, and those rodeo boys sure loved their Waffle House. Shit, we all did. It was a Waffle Home in this part of town-- it was all we had after the rest of the town went to bed at sundown. 

A waitress sighs and tells me to sit wherever I’d like and she’d get to me when she could. She looked so tired. I picked the one somewhat clean table in the place, and watched the storm rage on outside. My phone confirmed that I would be here for awhile, and all I could do at this point was hope it didn’t evolve into a tornado. Waffle House would probably remain open even if it did. 

Even this late into the night, Waffle House had a buzz of conversation and kitchen noises. I saw a full staff and other customers, and yet, the only sound in the place was the hail beating on the roof and windows. The usual late night sound of laughter or arguments (usually the latter) was replaced by this frighteningly eerie silence. 

Seeing my phone was nearing the end of its battery life, I glanced around for an outlet when my eyes met those of the man in the booth across me. His hunched shoulders were cloaked in a dirty plaid shirt, and I assumed he might have been one of the rodeo boys. He wasn’t terribly old, maybe in his fifties at most, but the weariness of his features aged him. He stared at me momentarily, a slight crustiness to his gaze, before he returned to his plate of syrup soaked waffles. 

I slid down a little in my booth, knowing I’d soon be phoneless. Well, not the end of the world, I figured. People operated just fine without phones for years. I set it aside and waited for my waitress to remember I was here. 

The lights above flickered, and yet were silent-- none of that fluorescent hum. Or maybe there was, and I just couldn’t hear it among the thunder and hail. It still struck me as unsettling, but my thoughts were interrupted by the work worn face of Marilyn. 

“What can I get you?,” she asked in a monotone voice that added to my increasing unease. She didn’t sound tired, or annoyed, she sounded utterly blank. Almost robotic, but with an inflection of human that made it uncanny.

“Could I get a coffee, and the two egg breakfast with--”  I didn’t get to specify anything about my plate before she was walking away. Must have been a hell of a shift, I thought to myself. Whatever, food was food, I would be fine with whatever I got at this point, as long as it passed the time faster. I just wanted to go home. 

Her shoes echoed as she shuffled off, and she didn’t speak with the cook, she just handed him a plate with random crap on it. Figuring my staring would be rude, I turned back to the window. Luckily, the hail stopped, but the rain was still coming down in buckets. No tornado watch yet. The atmosphere felt oppressively thick, and I almost felt like I was choking on the smells of burnt coffee, bacon, and stale cigarettes. There was an undertone to it though, something I couldn’t place right away. It was oddly….metallic. 

I pressed the heels of my hand to my eyes and took a deep breath. I had to relax. It was just a fucking Waffle House. It was always weird-- that was part of the charm. My growing anxiety was just the storms, right? 

“Good time for a late night meal, huh?” The voice made me jump from my seat. It was the rodeo guy, staring right at me. His voice was low and gravelly and much more human than the waitress’s, yet it gave me even more anxiety. Despite how I’d seen him actively eating, his plate had the same amount of food on it that I’d seen earlier. He had a little smirk on his face, and glanced at the window, as if suggesting I do the same. 

I smiled nervously, wondering why the fuck some random man was talking to me. I was a newer face around this part of the country, and what they called Southern Hospitality still creeped me the fuck out. As if noticing this, he let out a frightening little chuckle before returning to his plate of waffles, his weirdly hypnotic gaze now breaking. 

I looked back out the window, weirdly compelled to, and the rain had downgraded to less apocalyptic now. I could see my car, and a few bodies in the parking lot smoking. I had a bad habit of not locking my doors, so I locked them from my remote to deter any smokers out there who might be interested in my stunning little Nissan Altima that smoked if you drove it longer than twenty minutes. Lightning flashed, momentarily illuminating the parking lot. That’s when I noticed the shadows. They moved unnaturally, and danced only at the very edges of the parking lot.

My heart began to race, but like before, the waitress interrupted my growing unease. A cup of coffee was placed in front of me, its smell warm and familiar. And yet, it brought me no comfort. I tried to ask for sugar and cream, but again, the waitress walked away before I could. Black coffee was better than no coffee, I figured. Taking a sip eased my nerves a bit, and I told myself I was just letting my anxiety get out of hand. I was finding fright in things that were perfectly normal-- for a Waffle House. 

Aside myself and the rodeo boy, there was one other table here. Five people in total, who were silent the whole time. I only knew this because they stared at me as they walked by to leave. No words, no smiles, just vacant staring. I knew I stood out, but it made me feel uncomfortable regardless. 

Rodeo boy laughs once more. “Saw yer plates,” he said, motioning to the window. “Out of state. You’re new here, aren’t ya?”

“Been about six months,” I replied. Did that count as new? Ever since I moved here, people seemed obsessed with the idea of me being from out of town. It felt so unnecessary.

“That’s just a drop of piss in the bucket, son. I’m here every night, and I ain’t ever seen you.” He was right. I’d never been to this Waffle House before. I much more preferred the one on the highway, surrounded by other businesses. This one was more remote, which added to it’s uncomfortable atmosphere. “They’re gonna stare, son. You’re out here dressed as Count Dracula, chokin’ back black coffee. We don’t do cream ‘n sugar, you’ll just have to mature a bit.”

He laughed once more, but I decided not to reply. Why should I? He was a creepy, hulking man who was getting a kick out of scaring and insulting me. It felt safest to pretend he wasn’t there. 

My eyes go back to the window, and in another flash of lightning, I see them again. The shadows. It was as if fingers of darkness were clawing at the edges of the parking lot. I inched closer to the glass to get a better look, when the sound of a plate slamming once again pulls my attention away. My waitress. 

“Syrup?,” she asked. 

It confused me, until I looked down and saw waffles. I hadn’t ordered that. “Oh, this is--”

“All we got,” she snapped. “Syrup or not?”

I nervously shook my head and slumped in my seat some as she walked away. I wasn’t the biggest fan of waffles-- even Waffle House’s-- but hey, food was food. I took a bite, and again looked out the window. The sight made me nearly choke on my food. 

The man was laughing wholeheartedly now, as if my horror was the funniest thing he’d ever seen. The entire lot now was engulfed in the strange tendrils of shadow, and it was pulling at the hedges that perimetered the building. I got up quickly, getting as far from the window as I could in a short amount of time. 

My eyes looked to rodeo boy. “Shut the fuck up dude-- don’t you see that!?”

“See what?,” he mocked. “Oh, hush boy.” His laughing ceased and he pointed at the seat across his. “Your mind’s playing with ya, making ya see shit. Why don’t ya sit awhile and relax some?”

I shook my head and turned to the counter, trying to pay. But it was like the staff was ignoring me. 

“Ah, come on!,” the man teased. “You look like you’d be a big fan of the creepy crawlies that hang out ‘round here! C’mon, sit with me, I can tell ya all about it.”

I still didn’t want to, and every instinct said not to, and yet, it was like he was forcing me to. I was stiff as a corpse as I sat down, and my eyes refused to meet his. They were quite suddenly full of life, like a proud predator who had just caught his prey. 

“They say these woods are haunted,” he said.

“That’s cool…” I murmured, looking for any out to leave.

“The shadows yer seeing, they ain’t real. The trees pull weird tricks out here. No, no, see the real worries in this neck of the woods ain’t no ghosties. There’s weird people.”

No shit. I’m sitting with one.

He then says something that injected ice into my veins. “Yanno, you’d make a fine lookin’ corpse, Hollywood.”

There was an instinct to correct him, wanting to say that just because I was from California didn’t mean I was from Hollywood. I’d never even been to fucking Hollywood. But fear took over, and I tried to inch out of my seat.

“Not a lot of meat on ya, though. But I bet you’re one of them clean eaters, all that plant based shit. I bet that’s like a good, grass fed beef. Ya dig?”

I dug, alright. I once again tried to leave, but now, his hand had a frighteningly strong grip on my own. “I wouldn’t go out there right now if I was you. Like I said, they say these woods are haunted. They say they make people do crazy things. There’s a few families in them there woods, families I won’t ever speak to. They like to wait for the dark--” His voice immediately stopped with the tingling of bells. A new face had just walked in.

He was a tall, thin, utterly filthy man. I would guess that he was a farmer based on his clothing, but it was almost as if he was dressed in a costume to trick people like me who weren’t raised around here.

Rodeo boy in front of me now leaned in close. “That there’s one of em,” he whispered. “You sit tight, pretty boy.”

I had a chance to escape then, as he’d gotten up to greet this freak. But that meant walking right by them, which I didn’t want to chance. This new comer had dead eyes, the kind with no soul in them. I turned away, quietly listening to rodeo boy talk him up. 

“Well, shoot, Todd I ain’t seen ya in, shit, how long’s it been now?” Rodeo boy sounded genuinely friendly now. 

“Not since our Brodie went missin’,” Todd replied. His voice was oddly deep for someone as scrawny as he was. “It’s been ‘bout six months.”

Todd glances my way, and I again feel ice in my blood. “You looks a lot like my Brodie,” he said. “You wanna be Brodie?”

Rodeo boy, takes him by the shoulder and leads him to a table. “Now, Todd, that twig looks nothing like Brodie. You don’t want him.”

Want me? I got up now, knowing this may not end well. I tried to be inconspicuous as I went for the door, but Todd’s voice warned me not to. “You don’t wanna go out there right now. Mama’s out, ‘n she’s in one of her moods. She’s been real hungry, Mason. I dunno what to with her.”

Rodeo boy, aka Mason, told me to sit back down before turning back to Todd. “You gotta ride it out. Yer family can’t keep doin’ this.” His voice dropped to a hush. “One of these days, someone’s gonna catch on. Get her a deer or somethin’, all these missin’ boys is eventually gonna turn back to you.”

It was all clicking. Was this Mama some crazed murder? Was she blood thirsty? Or was it a more literal hunger? 

I didn’t want to stick around to find out. My car was less than twenty feet away. If I ran, I could get in it fast enough to beat it out of here. 

“I wouldn’t try it!,” Mason called after me. But it was too late. I was dining and dashing sure, but I had to get the fuck out of here. Through the rain, I sprinted to my car, and practically dove inside. I prayed for it to start on the first try, for once in my life, and thank god it did. I ensured all my doors were locked before turning on the headlights. 

The sight before me made me scream. An older, larger woman was in front of my car. In my panic, I was struggling to shift into reverse, giving her a chance to hobble to my door. Through the glass, I could hear her wailing, “You gotta light!? You gotta light for my cigarette!?” She was pounding on the window, begging for a light. 

I did not care. I threw the car into reverse and whipped the fuck out of there. I was going about ninety on the highway, wanting to put as much space between me and this Waffle House as possible. It was all a bad dream, I told myself, a manifestation of my anxiety. Seeing my apartment complex in my headlights felt like salvation, and I knew this was all behind me. Now, more than ever, I craved a Modelo. I took a moment in my car to just breathe. Everything was going to be alright, I assured myself. It was all fine. Mason was just scaring me for fun, Todd was obviously mentally ill, that woman was probably on drugs. It was just a weird night. I was letting my fear of storms make everything into a horror movie. 

Once I’d stopped shaking, I started for my apartment. Typically, I never paid attention to anything in the lobby, least of all the mess of papers that littered the billboard. There was usually all the same shit: local ads, lost pets, and missing people. The same things you’d see at a Walmart or a post office, or anywhere else. I’d seen it all so much that it melted into the background in my day to day life. 

But tonight, it caught my eye. A missing person’s flyer with a photo of a guy looking vaguely like myself. Brodie Wells, it read. Brodie. My heart sunk as I ripped it off and inspected it closer. Behind Brodie’s flyer was another, very similarly formatted. Another young guy, looking like an outsider. And another. And another. There were over twenty of them-- all within ten years of age from each other, all not dressing like the townsfolk I'd seen here, and all missing in this area. All last seen around that Waffle House by those woods. They were also all tourists, visitors-- just like myself. I brought all the flyers to my unit with me, laying them all over my floor to get a better look. This kidnapper definitely had a type. Or was it a kidnapper? 

I pulled open my laptop and started researching each name, and everything came back the same. No trace of any of them, and this had been going on for years. Two of them had an ounce more of information on them, as their names were better known. They had public profiles, so there was much more on their case. They were also tourists, but they looked different from the kidnappers' victim type. They were in town for some YouTube video project, and apparently, one recommended they film out the woods in the area after a dinner at Waffle House. For years, nothing ever came up about them, until a hiker’s dog came running out of the woods with a human bone. One that was so smooth, it was as if all flesh had been cooked away. Those were the article's exact words. Soon, another bone was found, and both were DNA matched to a pair of missing YouTubers named Hunter and Isaiah. But that was years ago, and they were never explicitly tied to other missing persons cases. Despite the differences, I found connections. Were these the first victims? Did they put up too much of a fight, perhaps? The one did look a little intimidating, like he didn't trust strangers. Maybe he'd fought back? My heart was pounding and my mind went back to Waffle House. 

Mama’s in one of her moods. What was the mood? Homicidal? Damn it, Mason, that’s not something to ride out! I decided to try and call the police, but my phone was dead at this point. Surely, there was a public phone in the lobby. I raced downstairs for it, but to my dismay, the line was dead. Had the storm taken it out? It had picked back up again, the thunder rattling the whole building as it sounded. The lights flickered before also going out, and now, it was pitch black. The only light came from the occasional flashes of lightning. 

That’s how I saw her, standing in that glass doorway. As shadows unnaturally danced about in the same way they did in that parking lot, I saw her silhouette and a glimpse of her face, but there was no mistaking it. It was the same woman, and my only saving grace was the door being locked from the inside. She was pounding on the glass once more, begging to be let in. 

“Come on, now, boy, you can spare a light!,” she begged, somehow yelling loud enough that I could hear her clearly through the glass. Her fist was pounding on it in a jarring display of strength, sending echoing booms through the quiet lobby. I couldn't see a thing in the dark to find where I was going, and I stood frozen in fear. I was hoping the lock would hold and that the rain soaking her would make her give up. 

A million things ran through my mind. Mason really was a freak, but he was trying to be nice, wasn't he? Was he trying to save me? He seemed to know, and yet, he seemed to have a soft spot for Todd. Was Todd an unwilling accomplice? Were Mason's comments nothing more than to get me to either leave sooner, or pay attention to him? It seemed Marilyn, my waitress, was trying to keep me distracted too. Did they not want me to look out the window? Was that how this Mama spotted me? I lived my life in near constant fear of everyone around me that I missed those who maybe had good intentions at heart. How I regretted that now. 

All at once her pounding stopped, and I thought for sure she was done. But she suddenly pressed her face to the glass, and a long flash of lightning illuminated her unholy grin. She's not human, I thought to myself. She couldn't be. 

“You'd make a lovely corpse!,” she yelled, and it sent chills through me. 

It wasn't just because of those harrowing words. It was because I could hear her much clearer now. The door was open, the glass shattered around her frail, twitching frame. Her skin hung on her like kudzu hangs on an abandoned home, and her teeth were unnaturally large and white as she grinned maniacally. I was frozen before the sound of shuffling glass against the bottom of her slippers pushed me into action. Her eyes shone like a predator’s, and I had to act to live. 

All I could do now was run.

I’m really new to the coffee world and still getting my head around the whole cup of excellence. I do have a few questions though (hoping it doesn’t sound ignorant)

- Does it matter if the ranking on the COE for the specific country is on the lower levels? Like 5 and up? Is it still considered a good kind of coffee compared to the #1 ranked? 

- I understand that roasters who buy these beans usually resell it packaged. How long does the packaged coffee usually last and keep its flavor? Especially if you consider the timeframe of shipping it takes to get to your door and these roasters that bought the COE are located on the other side of the world such as Tokyo, Korea, California and more.

- For those COE that won 2023, and the roasters / coffee shops that are still selling the COE are those beans still fresh? Or have they lost their flavor since it’s been a long time since it was packaged? I’ve noticed that even though they won the 2023 COE the prices are still high. 

- For the companies who buy the beans and the customers who buy from them, does the customer usually get a certificate as a proof that they won? Especially if the customer also wants to resell it? 

- and has anyone heard of Coffea circulor and if they’ve actually won the COE or are they grading their own beans based on the Qgraders in their team? Do they give out COE certificates as well for proof? 

- do these roasters/ coffee shops give out recipe or ways on what’s the best equipment (v60, aeropress, siphon, etc) that would best suit their roasted coffee? Would hate to waste an expensive coffee only to experiment on it.

I want to write deep love letters full of longing and she writes me back because I’m THAT kind of romantic. I want us to split the check for the date or maybe she offers sometime.

I want someone who thinks of me as much as I think about her. I want us to talk about Sister Outsider and give our analysis on what she means. I want mundane trips to the grocery store and we race each other to the car with our shopping carts. I’ve kissed so many frogs and it’s to the point where I just fucking give up.

It comes down to choosing based on the city and I’ve never lived in either.  Cincinnati is about 5 hours closer to my family but I only see them 5-6 times a year as is.

Alright, basketball fans, gather 'round for the clash of the titans—or perhaps more accurately, the clash of the ""we're trying our best"" squads. The Los Angeles Clippers are set to take on the San Antonio Spurs in a matchup that promises to be as thrilling as a lukewarm cup of coffee.

The Clippers are coming in as the favorites with odds around 1.56 to 1.62 across various sportsbooks. Meanwhile, the Spurs are the underdogs with odds ranging from 2.35 to 2.5. Given that underdogs in basketball only win about 25% of the time, the Spurs are like that one friend who insists they can win at Monopoly without buying any properties—it's technically possible, but don't hold your breath.

The spread is hovering around -3.5 to -4.5 in favor of the Clippers, which suggests that the oddsmakers think the Clippers will win by a handful of points. The total points line is set at 220.5, which means we're expecting a decent amount of scoring, or at least a lot of attempts.

Now, if you're looking to make a savvy bet, consider taking the Clippers to cover the spread at -3.5. It's a safer bet than trusting the Spurs to pull off an upset, which is about as likely as finding a unicorn in your backyard. If you're feeling adventurous, though, you could take a flyer on the over at 220.5, because who doesn't love a good shootout?

In conclusion, expect the Clippers to come out on top, but if the Spurs do manage to win, well, you might want to check if pigs are flying outside. Happy betting!",1,1738196944.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False

There’s this girl at my school and in my major too. We hot it off the first couple days of classes and went to all the new student events and stuff. Then we both kinda stopped talking to each other, but still liked posts and stuff on instagram of each other. Then on last Halloween she gives me some candy, and a few weeks later I go to her stage play and she hugged me after.

now I have a class with her and we don’t really talk. I’m trying to convince myself not to like her but idk now I’m on Reddit I guess. Anyway I let her borrow some materials for the class, and sometimes when she sees me she’ll call my name and smile. And just today she was talking to my friend trying to get him to show the picture he drew, but the entire time she was doing that she was looking into my eyes.

idk. I’m overthinking, and I get attached to the idea of someone liking me but idk what to do. I have a feeling if I ask her for coffee or something then she’ll say no and that would make that one class awkward.

They are the quiet triumph of nature’s design, the soft, gentle rebirth of a new day, and honestly, nothing gets me quite like the glorious sunrise. It’s like the universe is personally sending me a message: “Wake up, you’ve got this, and today is yours.” The sheer perfection of a morning is something you don’t appreciate until you truly experience it—whether it’s that first sip of coffee that hits your soul or that feeling of accomplishment when you’re awake before the world starts buzzing.

There’s something magical about mornings, you know? It’s like the calm before the chaos of the day. The stillness, the silence, the crisp air—it all whispers, “Today could be the best day ever.” And let’s not forget that first *stretch*—you know, the one where your body just says, “Ah, yes, I’m alive and ready to conquer everything.” It’s the ultimate form of self-care, the morning stretch. Don’t even get me started on breakfast, though. The potential of what your morning could be is encapsulated in that one meal. Smoothies, avocado toast, pancakes—each bite feels like a promise of something greater.

The beauty of mornings is that they hold endless possibilities. You wake up with a clean slate, a fresh start. Even if the day ahead is packed with challenges, you know you’ve already won by embracing the gift that is the morning. It’s like having a secret weapon against whatever the day throws at you. The world is still asleep, but you're ready to *rise and shine*.

So yes, let’s celebrate mornings. They are the heartbeat of the day, the first chapter of a new story, and the source of endless hope and potential. Without mornings, we would have no reason to dream, no reason to try, no reason to take on the world with the kind of energy that only a morning can give us. They are, without a doubt, the most important part of our lives. Mornings, I salute you.",0,1738196758.0,poop,0,0.5,False

She goes on to say how ""her and Chris usually split a coffee 😭"" but she got her own and the coffee she had there was freaking her out and making her tweak and giving her paranoia.

So taking that a step further what if Outie Irving is also trying to Palatov Dog himself not just making himself fatigued by drinking coffee at night? 

Cuz as far as we know inning Irving hadn't seen that hallway to the testing hall before they overrided but if Outie Irving is apparently connected to some sort of resistance group, if someone on the inside has already gotten a photo of the testing hallway, what if he's painting it over and over and drinking coffee while he does to try to palatov dog himself and pass the severance chip 

So Innie Irving is getting fatigued at the office but also smells the coffee and they're trying to get the smell of coffee to awaken a memory of the testing hallway for him to look for? 

And I'm assuming that when Outie Irving said ""my Innie got the message"" he gathered that his any saw all the paintings of the testing hallway so he caught it either way 

But what if that's what they've been doing what if there's some sort of break in the severance when it comes to sleep or fatigue?

I tried to make an appointment this week with my primary physician to discuss weakness in one side of my face. I've never had a symmetrical face and have noticed I've been losing muscle control on one side over many years. I attributed this to having terrible eyesight (nearly blind) in the eye on the affected side my whole life. I wear prescription contacts or galsses that correct my vision enough. However, in the last two months, it has progressed rapidly. My lip actively drags and drools when I talk. I have trouble fully swallowing at times. I cannot lift the eyebrow on the affected side independently at all anymore when I used to be able to. I've noticed I've been having more headaches, tho not severe. And the weirdest for me are the sudden numb spots on the affected side of my face. My lip, eyebrow, parts of my cheeks and jaw, and almost all the muscles around my eye are numb.

After providing my symptoms to the appointment scheduler for my primary doctor, the told me to go directly to urgent care, who then told me to go immediately to an emergency room.

I have no issues with speech besides the dragging drooling lip, and my balance is fine. I've even gone out dancing with friends and have no issue staying upright. I'd I've been fully sober for nearly a year for health reasons. I don't even drink coffee anymore.

The ER staff checked me for a stroke at the ER and suggested I had a mild case of Bell's Palsy. I've never heard of this before and explained I thought it was because of my blindness. They said it would go away withing days. When I explained it wasn't a sudden onset, that it had been aparently worsening for years and has rapidly worsened in the last couple of months, they were more concerned, gave me temporary medication to treat it, and advised me to see my primary doctor ASAP.

While my doctor is normally booked out weeks if not months for in-person visits, given the symptoms, they booked me in less than a week.

Some of my friends and family who have had it explained it was a sudden onset for all of them and went away within a matter of weeks if not days. None of them had experienced an onset over many years.

I've documented any photos and videos I have from the last 10 years to take to my doctor to show the progression. You can clearly see it has worsened over a long period of time.

I'll be visiting in February, and I'm keen to do and see the best that this region has to offer.

I've enlisted the help of AI (deepseek) to curate a list of food stops and activities. **I'll copy-paste the results below!** It took some time asking the agent to be more specific, and removing seasonal recommendations or things that didn't interest me.

I'm most interested in the nat'l and states parks, redwoods viewing, banana slug sighting, local oysters, local brews, breakfast burritos, coastal scenic hikes, Victorian architecture, learning about and sampling the local cannabis industry, independent book stores, and anything that is unique to Humboldt in a way that allows for further zen'ing out and relaxation.

**How would you rate this itinerary? Is it top-notch? What would you replace, what's missing?**

1id8sis,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1id8sis/the_25th_passenger/,"""The 25th Passenger""","I used to work the night shift as a train operator for the city’s subway. The graveyard shift was always eerie—empty stations, flickering lights, and the occasional late-night wanderer stumbling aboard. But nothing compared to what happened on November 12th, 2022.

That night, I was on the 3:15 AM route. As I pulled into the last underground station before the train looped back, I counted the passengers through the rearview mirror. There were exactly 24 of them. I always counted; it was a habit I developed for safety reasons.

The doors closed, and I continued the route. A few minutes later, I glanced at the mirror again. There were now 25 passengers.

I frowned, thinking I had miscounted. Maybe someone had been obscured by a seat. But the number gnawed at me. I decided to do another count at the next stop. As the train pulled in and I watched people exit, I counted again. There should have been fewer now.

Still 25.

A chill ran down my spine. My stomach twisted. I turned in my seat and scanned the car through the small operator’s window. The passengers sat in silence, some staring at their phones, some dozing off. But something felt… wrong.

At the next station, a few more people exited. I counted again.

Still 25.

My throat went dry. I checked the security cameras, rewinding to see if someone had somehow reboarded. Nothing. My hands gripped the controls tighter as I continued through the tunnel. The air felt heavy, suffocating.

I had to see for myself.

At the next station, I made an excuse over the intercom—""Routine check, everyone remain seated."" I stepped out of the operator’s booth and walked through the train, my eyes darting from face to face.



There were only 24 people. My heart pounded. I swore I had seen 25 in the mirror. I shook it off, chalking it up to exhaustion, and returned to my seat.

But as the train plunged into the darkness of the tunnel, I glanced at the mirror one last time.

There it was.

The 25th passenger.

It sat in the very last row, face obscured in the dim light. My breath hitched. My hands trembled over the controls. My instincts screamed at me to stop the train, to get out, to run—but I couldn’t. I had a job to do.

The next stop was the final one before the turnaround. I kept my eyes on the mirror. The figure never moved. As the train came to a stop, I held my breath, waiting for people to exit.

One by one, they stepped off. And as the last of them disappeared into the night, I counted again.



I shut the doors and bolted to the back of the train, my heart hammering in my chest.

The seat was empty.

But there was something left behind—a single, damp handprint on the window, smeared as if someone had been staring out, waiting for something… or someone.

I never worked the night shift again.

But the story didn’t end there.

A few weeks later, I ran into an old colleague at a coffee shop. He still worked nights. We chatted for a while before he hesitated and leaned in. ""Have you ever noticed something… strange on your shift?"" he asked.

My stomach dropped. ""What do you mean?""

He stirred his coffee, glancing around as if making sure no one was listening. ""A passenger. One that doesn’t belong.""

I felt the blood drain from my face. ""You’ve seen them too?""

He nodded slowly. ""Not just me. A few of us. Same thing every time. The count is off, then it isn’t. Like they were never there. But someone always finds a mark. A handprint, a shadow in the reflection—something.""

I swallowed hard. ""Who is it?""

He exhaled sharply, looking me dead in the eyes. ""No one knows. But rumor has it… it started after a passenger disappeared on a train late one night, years ago. The conductor swore he never saw anyone get off. But they found a single, damp handprint on the glass.""

I shivered.

That night, I dreamed of the 25th passenger. In the dream, they were sitting in the last row, staring directly at me. But this time, I could see their face.

And they were smiling.

The next morning, I woke up to a notification on my phone. It was a security alert from my old train station. A motion sensor had been triggered in an empty subway car.

I tapped the video feed open. The footage showed a train sitting in the dark, abandoned on the tracks.

Then, for just a moment, the lights flickered. And in the reflection of the train’s window, I saw it.

The 25th passenger.

So this should be the last time. At least it has to be for my brain’s sake. I’m a busy professional and to keep up professional appearances, sometimes we have to volunteer to write long detailed articles with meticulous citations. And despite my best efforts, I somehow procrastinated to the point that I need to finish quite a lot of work by the end of the week. 

I know. Weird how that happened. In my defense, my real work, the one that pays me, and life and being an adult also combined with my inherent neurodivergence to create a perfect storm of inactivity. But don’t fret, the looming deadline activates some deep part of my brain that helps me create my best work. If only I could tap into that all the time. 

Anyway it’s a lot easier to stay up late when I have someone to talk to. I also like talking to people and have been very isolated and busy lately. So I’m looking for fellow nite owls to chat with, get to know, learn from, vent to, and just have an all around good time. 

Last time I kinda winged my post, but I’m gonna give a list of possible things that I like that we could connect on. You don’t have to like or be interested in all or any of them, but it’ll give you a picture of who I am other than my clear ADHD:

- Cats
- Beers
- Showerbeers
- Tolkien legendarium
- Camping and Outdoorsy stuff 
- Adventures and traveling
- Reading
- Cool gadgets 
- Reaction videos on YouTube
- Complaining about work
- Looking for friends on Reddit
- Not being a ghost or catfish
- Sharing secrets and stories 

That pretty much covers it. But I’m sure we can find more things to connect on. All I ask if you be interested, engaged, open, and able to talk through the night (or day if you’re on the other side of the world). 

Wish me luck. Time for coffee No. 1

I don’t feel like writing how it happened again, but basically, he lured me to meet him and then just said he wanted to leave without telling me the truth. You know…always denying, lied to my face and daughter. Said he didn’t want to go abroad to see my other daughter and visit her as a family. Worse day of my life. He already had affairs twice before, but stayed. 
35 years together. 
He would write to my daughter who lives with me these emails as if everything was perfect for him and that he loved her, she showed them to me and deleted them. She is extremely angry. 
His family never said a word, only one sent me a merry Christmas plain. Card, as if nothing happened. 
Anyways, a part of me can’t resist to write his and her name on FB (they both blocked me on my real account though). They both have, on their profile, pics of them together. Always smiling. And I checked the likes and his sister and my ex sister in law all like their posts. His new wife has 600 friends on Facebook. I also found some pics of them on some group on Facebook and they were together, in a coffee shop, literally together. As if nothing could separate them. 
I don’t know how not to think about this. How do I get this out of my mind. Again, I did rebook them, but … 
Why are they so happy everywhere and why does his family also like their pics ?? Is this even fair ?? Why doesn’t anyone care, I just….

Please help!!!,"I'm a Christian male in my mid 20s. I have a problem with lusting after women. I had some girlfriends in high school and early college but haven't dated much since then because of this issue. I don't view pornography. I'm a virgin that's looking to remain celibate for life.

I like looking at pretty women and my mind starts to fantasize. For example, there's this woman from my church. She's really beautiful and the other day she had on a blouse and pants that were silky. The pants weren't exactly tight but I could see her figure and it wasn't good for me. She's also really sweet so I feel wrong thinking of her like that. There's also this friend I have that I think is so pretty. She's shy and also has a really kind personality. Finally I have a crush on a woman that works at the coffee shop I go to. Her eyes are beautiful. And I notice other random women all the time and frequently get crushes. But the one from church is my biggest crush. I wish I could hug and kiss her.

I'm a Christian guy and I want to live for Jesus. I just get really distracted by these beautiful women and I do lust and fantasize so bad. I can't get rid of the feelings of wanting to hold hands, hug, kiss, make out, have sex, etc. How can I be forgiven for this sin?

I wanted to share what worked for me, and hopefully this will reach people because SIBO is a horrible thing to deal with. I broke my jaw about a year ago and got my mouth wired shut, i got put into an all liquid diet and thought that was the reason I was getting so backed up. After switching back to solid foods, it only got worse. Lo and behold the antibiotics I was given ruined my good bacteria and gave me horrible SIBO. At one point I was lucky to have a bowel movement once a week. 

I did my own research and began taking 4 supplements: in the morning — Artichoke, Ginger, and Berberine. That with a cup of coffee is magic. I also did homemade shots of lemon juice, apple cider vinegar, and turmeric (I stopped doing this once I started to go regularly). At night, 250 mgs of magnesium oxide before bed. It took about 2 weeks of doing this before I began really noticing a difference, but my IBS symptoms magically disappeared.

Is it worth trying to reconcile or was she only saying that to save face?,"Hi all-- new account to hide under because some of the people involved use Reddit. Some proper names are lightly changed to keep anonymity. Sorry for the lengthy post, I just want to include as details possible to get proper insight!

For background context, I (28F) met this group of girls in college while working at a retail store near the university. We have been friends since 2019. The three girls in this group are The Bride (30F), Jane (30F) & Hannah (28F).

All three of these girls were apart of my bridal party when I got married in 2022 alongside two other close friends of mine (not apart of this story).

Context for points of tension (relevant later):

A few years ago, in 2022, we traveled to another state for a concert. I had a great time. However, one of the days we did spend a significant amount of time shopping (2+ hours in a vintage thrift store that The Bride really wanted to visit; there were no other places to wander to nearby, and there wasn't a public restroom so I had to hold my pee!) when I started to get burnt out from it. I didn't say anything, I didn't want to ruin anyone's time. Overall the trip was great and I loved it.

Early 2024, The Bride gets engaged.

Last fall, Hannah was moving states so us girls decided to do an overnight staycation in the city (early Sat to late Sun).  BECAUSE of the last trip, and because we were only doing one night little hurrah, when we were planning activities, I decided to be forthcoming and let the group know I would rather do something other than go shopping this entire trip (I was also recently unemployed and don't have the money to be frivolous right now). I pitched a few ideas like getting permanent bracelets or the aquarium. We agreed to see what the vibe was and just got along with how it progressed.

On Saturday in between our lounge reservations, we decided to kill time walking around a very high end mall (exclusively designer shops-- Cartier, Chanel, etc). We looked around and browsed for a couple hours and headed out to the cocktail lounge. I considered this outing ""shopping"" even though no one bought anything.  I was fine, we were having a good time.

Saturday evening we decide to go bar hopping; myself and Jane want to go dancing. We find a bar that has a dance floor and are dancing as a little group and having fun. The Bride seems very uncomfortable like she was not having a good time but didn't explicitly say anything. Even though I wanted to stay out, I didn't want her to be uncomfortable and it was getting a bit late, so I offered we could go back to our hotel and order food. We do.

Th next day we check out of our hotel and we're all a little hungover. They express wanting to go pick up a few things they saw from the shops yesterday really quick. I didn't want to go along and feel out of place or be grumpy about it so I suggested that I would sit back at a coffee shop and wait for them. My mistake was assuming that a quick go pick things up meant like \~1 hour.

An hour goes by and I hear nothing from the group. I figure they must be wrapping up soon, I'll hear from them anytime now! I keep thinking this until we reach the two hour mark and I finally message them. They say they are wrapping up soon and will come and get me. I was starting to be a little upset because my time was disrespected but I would be okay.

Soon turned into waiting for another thirty minutes, so again I check in. They say they are five minutes away. I decide to express how I felt rather than bottle it up because they are my girls and I care about them; I let them know I am annoyed and upset. I felt they weren't being inclusive about everyone's desires for this trip and our limited time, I also wanted to be able to spend quality time with Hannah before she moved. Also, I felt like we had gone shopping the day before too.

Hannah tried to talk to me and expressed that I lacked the adult communication to check in with them sooner. While I agree, I could have asked for an update earlier, I think this goes both ways and they could have checked in with me too knowing I stayed behind somewhere in a big city I'm unfamiliar with. I reminded them how I said I didn't want to spend the entire trip shopping because of the concert trip. I just didn't want it to monopolize the limited time of this trip we did have together and felt like we already engaged in that activity.

We all mutually apologize. This was the first rift to happen in this friendship. Disagreements and fights happen between friends from time to time. We had been friends for 5 years prior with relatively smooth sailing. I didn't think this would be so detrimental later on.

A month later, I get lunch with The Bride. She wanted to clear the air about the staycation, and I told her I no longer held any grievances but if she did we could talk about it. She asked to explain what I meant about the concert trip in regards to the staycation, so I explained. She seemed to understand in the moment, and I told her everything was good on my end. I was happy that we could be open and talk. We laughed, both apologized, forgave each other and hugged it out. She then asked me to be bridesmaid.

I go home to my husband telling him how we cleared the air, reiterating that I was so grateful to have a friendship where we could be open and honest with each other.

Hannah moves.

We have a group chat with the four of us, and I have always not been very prominent presence in a text based space. I have ADHD and I often forget about notifications although I'm trying to be better. I'm much better at being reached directly.

I'm still unemployed because it has been very difficult to find a job in my field since getting laid off. All of them have flourishing careers, travel plans and our chat talks a lot about shopping. I feel like right now,  I don't have a lot to contribute to the conversation. Also because of how hard of a time I'm having finding a job,  I started to fall violently depressed and withdrew even more. Also to combat my depression I've been delving into old hobbies I had dropped for a long time like reading and creative writing.

While I could have said I was dealing with mental health issues, I didn't want to interject and rain on anyone's celebratory parades. I also didn't want to burden them. No one ever checked on me or asked how I was doing or why I was withdrawn.

I would try to pop in every now again, and respond when it really mattered. I was rallying for us to all do a virtual pajama party but no date was ever locked down.  I also would initiate conversation with The Bride directly to try and make plans with her or tell her I miss her; our schedules never aligned.

I was telling my husband that I felt like whenever I had an innocuous but different opinion it felt ""wrong"" to them and they would try to correct me. One time I said I didn't understand the hype around a specific high end perfume for example, and the vibes in the chat got really... off. No judgement if that's what they like, I just personally didn't understand. My husband told me that anyone had a problem with what I said, they'd tell me because that's what good friends do.

More recently, The Bride asked the group for our opinions about several different wedding band options to us, and said she didn't want the bands to distract from her engagement ring's center stone. It's a beautiful vibrant sapphire.

Hannah and Jane say all of them are beautiful and she can't go wrong.

I made the mistake of calling one of the options gaudy-- I said something along the lines of ""This feels gaudy to me and it takes away from your centerpiece. I also prefer daintier rings and may just be a difference of style"". I commented on my favorite one saying how I loved it, it was elegant, classical and beautiful and really enhanced her engagement ring.

Hannah @'s me (so I see this message out of the 150+ that have passed) and said something along the lines of ""We don't say gaudy. It's a different of taste"".  I thought gaudy meant over extravagant. I told my husband that it felt like The Bride asked her to say that to me, and. he reassured me ""if The Bride had a problem, I'm sure she would tell you because that's what friends do"".

The MoH reminds us all to buy our dresses soon; The Bride asks that we send her a photo in the GC to get it approved because its a more conservative wedding. I send the photo, the Bride doesn't respond. She also didn't respond to the MoH who picked a very similar style of dress. MoH says she bought her dress,  and I go ahead and do the same, letting the chat know.

A couple of weekends ago, Hannah comes to town and we decide to meet in the middle (\~1hr drive each way for me). We all plan to go out for dinner and drinks to catch up. I still feel out of place at the table and like these are not conversations for me to engage in, but I'm happy for them and I want to celebrate all their happiness. When asked what everyone is up to, I mentioned I'm reading a lot and trying to write a book. I get weak ""oh that's so cool!"" before its overshadowed and dominated by work and travel plans. Toward the end of the night Jane is giving a small toast and shout out ""highlighting"" each and everyone of us.

Hannah is so pragmatic and reasonable.

The Bride is so fun and bubbly.

And I hyperfixate.

She legitimately said I hyperfixate so well. I really felt reduced to my ADHD in that moment. I go home and tell my husband how it hurt my feelings, and he reassures me she didn't mean it like that.

The following day, we are to meet brunch and go dress shopping. Another long drive for me, but I make it and have a good time mingling with The Bride's other bridesmaids despite it being a lot for me because I'm shy and introverted. The Bride gives us formal wedding invitations.

Now... Monday, the Bride messages me asking if we can chat about bridesmaid responsibilities. I say sure, we set up a time. She calls me and opens with that she feels like there has been a distance between us and put a lot of thought in and thought I wasn't a good fit for the bridal party anymore. I understood.

What bewildered me was her saying I was no longer invited to the wedding and that she couldn't trust me because I'm reactionary and bad at communication. She would love for us to get back to where we were and that if I we wanted to discuss me earning my invite back, I have to start at ground 0 for our friendship. I asked her what she meant because I was genuinely blindsided, and she said, that she it was a lot of things. She couldn't get over what happened at the staycation, and how I was harboring a grudge for what happened at the concert trip. (I didn't think I was? I only brought that up as a... hey, this happened last time but because we have such little time, can we make sure everyone's wants are heard?) She said she didn't want to continue fearing other grudges I may have over things that happened years ago. She also said that me calling her ring choice gaudy when she asked for an opinion was hurtful and judgy; she said I also dismissed her response of ""that's a strong word"". (I went to a movie after, and didn't comb through all 150+ messages). I told her I didn't see the message and it wasn't my intention to hurt her or dismiss her. I can't fix what I don't know and wanted to know why she didn't speak her concerns with me before they snowballed.

She continues to tell me she felt like she couldn't talk to me because I reacted very defensively during our lunch talk (again, I had a complete opposite experience. I didn't really harbor any grievances and only explained and justified my feelings when she furthered asked why and for me to). I have a bad habit of over explaining because I want people to understand, probably seen here and I'm working toward being more concise but it takes time. I understand now that is seen as defensive, and I don't want to be someone who is defensive. She said she feared my reaction and these talks are hard enough as it.

She also tells me that we never talk anymore or see each other and that being withdrawn has made her feel unsupported.

I feel like my entire character was redefined, and no one told me what exactly I needed to amend. My best friend and I got into a huge fight, and had a long, very uncomfortable talk over breakfast where we worked through our issues and made commitments to being better friends; our friendship has flourished so much since then. I feel like she never gave me the opportunity to change or know anything was wrong before it was absolute.

I asked her what rebuilding trust looked like for her and she said always being on the same page, and sharing the same values. I told her I needed to process our conversation since it took me by surprise and I would be open to continuing the conversation at a later date. I didn't want to say something misleading or unintentional hurtful in the heat of emotions.

After talking with my husband, my mom and my best friend... they all have come to the conclusion that these group of girls no longer fundamentally like me, and it seemed premeditated and like an out for them. I'm not a boss career driven woman (although I have career aspirations, I don't want to be chasing the promotion forever and forever), I don't care for designer items or expensive things, or fashion, or Taylor Swift. I'm artsy, introverted and more alternative in style and tastes; I like horror movies, and reading fantasy. Sure, I would like to travel, but I'm not going to be heartbroken if I don't. I enjoy staying home with my pets, and going out to the same bar with the same friends from time to time. I understand friendships grow apart, and people change; I  appreciated their different views because it helped broaden my perspective. However, I don't want to dim my light to make people feel comfortable. It's one thing if I am genuinely a flawed, hurtful person-- I'd want to change for the better, but it just feels like... she didn't like that I was different.

The Bride is also an only child who is best friends with her parents, and has been dreaming of her perfect wedding since she was a little girl. She's very colorful, and contemporary, versus I like dark colors, alternative styles and have a lot of tattoos and piercings now. I'm starting to think maybe I also don't look the part of her vision.

I'm also just really confused, and I don't know where I stand with Hannah & Jane.  But it feels like everyone else knew except for me. If they all had a problem with me, why didn't anyone speak to me? I was never worth a conversation and that hurts so much!

Do you agree, did she just not like me anymore? I'm open to working on myself, and will work on being more concise but other people around me have told me I'm fairly direct when it comes to communicating my boundaries and needs, and I care enough about people to talk through things when I'm/they're upset rather than brushing it under the rug.

TLDR: I was unasked to be a bridesmaid and uninvited from one of my former bridesmaids wedding.  She told me it was because I was reactionary and bad at communication because I expressed being upset with our friendship one time, and having varying opinions. Does she even like me as a person anymore? Is it worth trying to reconcile or was she only saying that to save face?",1,1738194682.0,relationship_advice,9,0.67,False

I wasn’t riding. Just walking. Same grocery store, same winter air, but slower this time. My hands were deep in my jacket pockets, breath curling in the cold like smoke. I wasn’t thinking about her—not exactly. But maybe, in some quiet, unspoken way, I was hoping.

And then—just like that—there she was.

Standing near the entrance, adjusting her scarf, holding another small grocery bag. This time, she noticed me first.

“You’re not on your bike today,” she said, tilting her head slightly, that same amused glint in her deep, dark eyes.

I smiled. “Didn’t want to make a scene crying outside a grocery store again.”

She laughed, effortless, like she had been waiting for me to say something stupid. Her wavy black hair was tucked under a hoodie today, but that same rebellious strand had found its way out again, curling near her lips. The tiny mole near her eyebrow was just as distracting.

She shifted the bag in her hands. “So, do you always come here?”

“Only when my kitchen is empty or fate decides to mess with me,” I said.

She raised an eyebrow. “And which one is it today?”

I glanced at the grocery store behind her. “Bit of both, I guess.”

She smiled—not the polite kind, but the kind that lingers for a second too long, as if she were deciding something. Then she nodded toward the entrance. “Well, if fate’s messing with you, might as well get something out of it.”

I followed her inside. The store was warm, filled with that faint scent of coffee and freshly baked bread. She walked ahead, stopping by the shelves like she knew exactly what she wanted. I, on the other hand, picked up random things just to have an excuse to stay longer.

At one point, she turned, holding a packet of cookies—the same brand I’d seen in her bag yesterday. “You should try these.”

I took the packet, flipping it in my hands. “Is this a recommendation or a test?”

She smirked. “Both.”

I looked at her, the way her eyes held a little mischief, the way her hoodie framed her face. And before I could overthink it, I said, “You look pretty.”

For a moment, she didn’t say anything. Just blinked. Then she tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear, smiling—not the confident smirk from before, but something softer. “That’s… random.”

I shrugged. “Maybe. Or maybe fate’s just messing with me again.”

She laughed, shaking her head, but there was a different kind of warmth in her eyes now. And just like that, I realized I wanted to see her again. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe the day after. Maybe until fate decided to stop messing with me.",1,1738194338.0,RelationshipIndia,5,1.0,False

1id87m4,https://i.redd.it/w15adxf2r0ge1.jpeg,Love Lost in New York: A City of Missed Connections,"New York City is a place where millions of lives intersect every day. You could be standing next to your soulmate on the subway, brushing past them on a crowded sidewalk, or locking eyes for a fleeting moment in a coffee shop. Love is everywhere, waiting to be found. And yet, in this city that never sleeps, losing it’s just as easy.
A City of Chance Encounters
New York has a way of bringing people together in the most unexpected ways. A wrong turn, a delayed train, or a spontaneous night out can lead you to someone who changes your life. You never know from which corner love will appear—maybe in a bookstore in the West Village, during a late-night walk across the Brooklyn Bridge, or in a cab you happened to share with a stranger.
But as fast as love can appear, it can disappear even faster.
Fear: The Silent Heartbreaker
The city teaches us to be tough, to move fast, and to protect ourselves. But in love, those same instincts can become our downfall. We hesitate, we overthink, and we convince ourselves it’s not the right time, not the right person, not the right moment. We let fear take the wheel, and before we know it, the opportunity is gone.
Maybe you met someone who made your heart race, but you were too afraid to ask for their number. Perhaps you felt an intense connection that scared you, so you ran before it could become real. Or maybe you let love slip away simply because you assumed there would be another chance—only to realize too late that there wouldn’t be.
The Pain of What-Ifs
One of the worst feelings in a city filled with endless possibilities is wondering what could have been. The regret of not speaking up, not fighting for love, not pushing past fear—it lingers. Because the truth is, love doesn’t always wait. Sometimes, it’s a one-time offer; if you don’t take it, it’s gone forever.
Reclaiming Love in the City
But here’s the thing: New York is also a city of second chances. The same streets that took love away might bring it back again. And even if it’s not the same person, love always finds a way—if we let it.
So next time your heart tells you to take a chance, listen. Say hello. Ask for the number. Show up because love is around every corner in this city—but only if you’re brave enough to claim it.

In a strategic twist that echoes the old adage about having friends in high places, Coinbase has added four significant figures to its advisory council. Yes, you guessed it — we're talking about former US Senator Kyrsten Sinema, along with Chris LaCivita, who notably campaigned for President Trump's re-election. 

Rounding out the new advisory lineup are Bill Dudley, the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and Luis Alberto Moreno, a global finance guru. Michael Ashley Schulman of Running Point Capital Advisors remarked that this move hints that Coinbase is eyeing a direct line to policymakers, especially with such heavy hitters who have deep connections in the Trump camp and traditional finance sectors. 

The winds seem to be shifting favorably for Coinbase. With Trump's nominations for key positions in US financial regulatory bodies leaning toward the crypto-friendly end of the spectrum, things are looking brighter. 

Paul Atkins has been tapped as the pro-crypto successor for the SEC, aiming to replace Gary Gensler. In the meantime, Mark Uyeda, a crypto supporter in his own right, has snagged the acting chair role at the SEC and has already initiated a crypto task force designed to clarify the murky waters of crypto regulation. 

Not to be outdone, Caroline Pham is now the acting chair of the CFTC, ready to dive into discussions about crypto through new public roundtables. And it gets wilder — Trump has even signed an executive order to form a working group focused on digital assets, whilst also doubling down on the anti-central bank digital currency stance.

The regulatory fun doesn’t stop there. Coinbase recently celebrated a series of legal victories against the SEC, with rulings that challenged the regulator's lack of clarity on rules. It seems Coinbase is not just adding advisors but is also sharpening its legal game!

Whether this new advisory board will lead to clearer crypto regulations or just more coffee breaks remains to be seen. However, one thing is abundantly clear: Coinbase is looking for a sweet spot in the world of digital finance, and they know how to play the game.

I am unemployed for 4 months now. At first it helped me lowering my stress levels and constant alertness, which is good. But recently i am feeling really miserable. I started taking Lexapro, which helped somewhat, leaving my flat wasn't a tragic task anymore. But it is sometimes bad again and today, it wasn't that good. I felt extremely uncomfortable going out again, and I catched two people giving me disgusting looks. I just can't help it, I just feel so damn uncomfortable on the streets, it's always been that way. Back then, I didn't even knew how bad I felt, when I was younger I just wandered  through the streets like I was in some form of trance, everything felt so weird and bad and I think I was just dissociating nonstop. It never got any easier. Later that turned just in a constant fight or flight mode. Recently I am in a stat I can't really explain. I just feel so extremely out of touch with everyone. I just feel so alienated from the people around me. It happened when I thought back about past experiences I made in my relationships with people. I just fucking can't get over about how much assholes has been in my life. Starting with my dad leaving me alone when I was three months old, leaving me alone with my narcissistic single Mom in a student dorm. I can only remember some things before I was ten. My teens were a shit show, I just wasn't ready for school, horrible self esteem and constantly switching from feeling super anxious or depressed. In my childhood I always felt that deep aching loneliness, which makes you feel restless and anxious, it almost hurts in a physical kind of way. My twentys were just another, more shitty shit show. Psychosis with 21, narcissist friends, borderline girlfriends, me reaching my mental breaking point. I also somehow never learned who I was. I only have vague ideas about myself, it's like I have multiple versions of me, and I switch between them, sometimes I go back to another version if I loose hope in the other. I just can't get out of the negative feedback loop. Recently I uncovered a lot of anger and it makes me a bitter person full of resentment and I can't stand myself that way, but these are the true feelings I have. I can't pretend anymore. Life was only nice in movies or books. Reality sucks so much. I want to like people and humans but I...just don't. I am 30 now, a grown man, and I never got the chance to know what real love or trust feels. I want to have a positive outlook on life but everything just sucks so fucking much. I cut off all contacts who were not healthy for me and was completely alone for a year. I started socialising again and met some people, one really sympathetic guy, but we only meet for sports and two women, one has borderline and the other one also comes from a very controlling and narcissistic home, and I just can't trust her, because she is pulling strange moves sometimes. And they both want something from me, I am not sure what it is exactly. I don't even see a future. I learnerd a job, which I am totally incompatible with (in the social field) and it's just coping with lack of sleep, coffee, silent desperation, dreaming about a better future because the present is bad and horrible thoughts before bed. I will start working again next month, but I just have very little confidence, because my last job was so horrible. I just don't know how to behave socially, I never had a real role model in any situation of life, besides my abusive and neglectful Mom, and even she wasn't there most of the time. I feel like a fucking alien and just empty right now. I am just so done being myself. I wish I was invisible. Putting myself out there just feels like feeling every little second how incompatible I feel with everything. ",1,1738193874.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

As someone who's somewhat health-conscious and likes to keep track of their vitals, I had high hopes for this device. Right out of the box, the design caught my eye. It's compact, lightweight, and has a clean white finish that blends well into any modern setting. The build quality feels sturdy, and the cuff material is gentle on the skin. Having a patented, skin-friendly, and comfortable cuff is a game-changer, especially for someone like my mom who gets annoyed by stiff cuffs on other monitors.

Setting up the device was surprisingly straightforward. I’ve dealt with monitors before that made me feel like I needed an engineering degree to operate them, but not this one. The instructions in the user manual were clear and concise. The cuff, adjustable for arm sizes ranging from 8.7 to 16.5 inches, fit snugly on my arm without pinching or discomfort. I tested it on my dad too, who has a larger arm circumference, and it adjusted perfectly. What stood out most was the large display. Even in dim lighting, the numbers were crisp and easy to read. My grandma, who struggles with vision, could easily interpret the readings without squinting.

Accuracy is where this monitor shines. Over the course of a week, I used it multiple times a day, and the readings were consistent. It even averages the last three readings, which gives a more balanced perspective of blood pressure trends. This feature was particularly helpful during my morning coffee experiment (spoiler: caffeine did spike my numbers). I liked the built-in alerts too. Once, I had the cuff a bit loose, and the machine prompted me to fix it rather than giving me a false reading.

**Pros**

* **User-friendly design**: The large display and clear instructions make it ideal for all age groups.
* **Comfortable cuff**: Adjustable and soft, it works well for varying arm sizes without causing irritation.
* **Data storage**: It stores 245 readings for up to three users, making it perfect for family use.
* **Accurate readings**: Consistent results with alerts to ensure proper usage.
* **Dual power options**: Comes with batteries but also supports a Type-C cable (not included).

**Cons**

* **No Type-C cable in the box**: Having to buy it separately feels like a missed opportunity.
* **Storage bag quality**: While functional, it feels a bit flimsy for long-term use.
* **Limited advanced features**: No Bluetooth or app connectivity for those who prefer syncing health data to their phones.

Comparing this to competitors like Omron's popular blood pressure monitors, the OVUTEK VBP441(F1701T) holds its own in terms of accuracy and comfort. However, Omron offers Bluetooth connectivity and app integration, which OVUTEK lacks. That said, this device is more budget-friendly, making it an excellent option for those who prioritize value over high-tech features. Against other budget monitors, OVUTEK stands out for its consistent performance and thoughtful design.

Speaking of value, the price aligns well with what it offers. While it's not the cheapest option out there, the reliability and comfort are worth the investment. Advanced features like irregular heartbeat detection and error alerts add to its appeal. However, the lack of Bluetooth might deter tech enthusiasts who are used to syncing everything to their smartphones.

During my testing, I appreciated the memory function, which allowed me to track my readings across the week. It’s particularly useful for families since it supports data storage for three users. I wish I’d had this years ago when my dad was juggling multiple health concerns and struggled to keep a log of his readings manually. The device also includes a feature where it compares your readings to WHO standards, making it easy to understand whether your blood pressure is within a healthy range.

Portability is another strong suit. Weighing just over 15 ounces and fitting easily into its storage bag, it’s a breeze to take along on trips. I took it to a family gathering over the weekend, and everyone had a blast testing their blood pressure after a heavy meal (spoiler: fried chicken wasn’t kind to anyone’s numbers).

Battery life is decent, and the inclusion of three AA batteries in the box was thoughtful. I tested it with both batteries and a Type-C cable (borrowed from my phone charger) and found both options equally effective. However, the lack of the Type-C cable in the package felt like a small inconvenience.

Overall, the OVUTEK VBP441(F1701T) Blood Pressure Monitor is a solid choice for anyone looking for an accurate, easy-to-use device that doesn't break the bank. It may not have all the bells and whistles of high-end models, but it shines where it matters most: reliability, comfort, and simplicity.

For instance, I am an online college student so I am home a bunch and am surrounded by lots of food. I keep putting off my studies to binge and its a horrible habit. Anyway, here's what I've noticed:

\- Usually around 1-3 or 3-6pm, that uncomfortable time when it's too early for dinner, too early to shower, etc. I get a bit bored around this time so I unfortunately turn to snacking to ease into the uncomfortableness. At the end of the day too. Its horrible massive binges too. It's almost daily

\- When I sit in my kitchen with boredom I binge.

\- Carbs and sugars also heavily trigger my binges. I was even telling myself I was even binging on protein, but no, it was the loaded saucy combos on top of the protein that was luring me in. Whatever it may be, protein bars, oatmeal, yogurt bowls, those foods that you think wouldn't trigger the average person, triggers me. Even coffee with milk!

\- The longer in the day I go without food, the less food noise I have. Once I indulge I cant stop. My mind sets off when I eat: oh no, when will I eat next? What? etc etc.

Based off this info, what steps should I take? Im thinking of low carb because I think boring foods will keep that trigger off for a bit. What do you think? Thank you!",1,1738192844.0,BingeEatingDisorder,0,1.0,False

I made a previous post here that got a bit of attention about a lady who works outside my place of employment as a coffee lady, and how she defended Elon for doing the salute. What she just told me made me drop my coffee right in front of her. I was stupid for even trying to have a conversation with her after the first time, and I'm even more stupid for buying another coffee from her. I really wanted to give her the chance to not be abhorrent, but we are officially in a post logic world, and she's from a bygone era. 

-‐-----------

Today, I walked over to get lunch and a coffee like normal, so I, for whatever reason, went to the coffee lady who had only recently exposed herself as a Trump supporter and Elon defender. Yeah, I know, I'm fucking stupid, and feel even more stupid knowing that I tried to bring real conversation to one where the other side literally makes up 80% of their arguments and never stays on point. My bad, and it will NEVER happen again.

She could tell I'm not in a good mood, because (insert one of the thousands of global issues, including our domestic ones), and she asks why I'm down, like she doesn't understand that the presidency isn't like a coat of paint on a car, and it's not just something to get over after a while when policy is on the line. I told her that I'm sad for our country having 10% of it's GDP vanish over night, the death of various outreach organizations and the fact that millions of the people who harvest our food are now living in fear. I should have just said nothing. 

She then goes on a Hunter Biden tirade, calling them a ""crime family"", and asks me if I think anything would be better if Trump lost. I said ""obviously, yes"", and she says something that would lose any customer: ""Well then you're even stupider than I thought"". WTF? Don't call me stupid, you uneducated bitch. A structured debate would melt her brain. I was about ready to leave, but she kept going. 

""I hope ICE goes into every school, and every building and rips the illegals out, and sends them all back to Mexico! If I got pulled over for committing a crime, they'd take my kids away from me as well! I have to spend my hard earned tax dollars on them being illegally here!""

I simply said, ""I'm sorry, but that sounds incredibly fascist""

She told me, and I'm quoting,

""You say that like it's a bad thing.""

But there’s a lot to work through.,"We broke up a few months ago in November. There were a lot of reasons, during the summer we had a long distance period for about 2 months, only about 2 months into us dating. We then lives together for about a month before the Fall semester at our university started. I initiated a breakup in early November because it seemed almost like she was losing herself in our relationship. 

We both struggle with some mental health issues (shocker), and over the summer, especially during the month we were apart, I most certainly was not the easiest partner to be with. She has confided that my actions during that time made her feel very judged and as if I didn’t respect her opinions. I can’t disagree in full faith. My actions during the time were toxic. There was no cheating or name calling, but subtle things that I completely understand uprooting someone’s mental state. Asking for like long phone calls almost every night, needing constant validation, and an insufferable downward spiral. At the time I was dealing with some intense financial hardship, and familial tensions. I never asked her for help with any of this stuff, but she heard the brunt of my long winded complaints. I was also working in a state on the opposite side of the country for the summer, in a city where I knew absolutely no one. I also wasn’t very passionate about my work or my team. It was good money though.

Anyway, when we got back I started noticing the changes in speech patterns and our dates. She was sad and I felt horrible and apologizing over and over wasn’t a solution. She had gotten me into therapy and medication over the summer, so I felt like I was in a clear enough head space to end things clearly and let her go. It wasn’t just her disposition though, we were having severe sexual incompatibilities at the time. She into kink, I was not yet comfortable with it. I broke it off over a coffee and walked her back to her place. The next week she told me she wanted to go no-contact (I wanted to be friends) and she was gone just like that.

About a month later, I get a text from her asking to meet up to talk. We grab coffee and she tells me all about her month. A very sexual conversation about her exploration into kink and feeling sexually free. I was happy for her, but severely uncomfortable. I told her I was okay with hearing anything but I guess that did not cross my mind. She told me about how she was seeing a few people casually and was having fun. I walked her home and cowardly, blocked her on everything. I felt bad but I also knew I couldn’t deal with that kind of conversation with her. It hurt too much.

Then I unblocked her a week later and asked to meet up. Wishy washy I know, but I was missing her and the conversation in the coffee shop just intensified all the feelings. I at least wanted to talk. It did not go well. A botched convo that ended with her just walking away. I did block her, so it was valid, but I texted her all that night anyway. I showed back up at her apartment in the morning and practically begged to do better by her. I felt horrible. With 12 hours of discussion and a list of things we promised to work on to ensure the previous issues didn’t pop back up, we were trying again. We were attached at the hip for 4 days during finals season. She had a mall date with her friends that Saturday. I was gonna go out with some of mine. She left my apartment and promised to see me after (I was planning on going back home that Monday). 

8 hours later, she broke up with me over text. A very short concise text. Later she sent an email with some more fluff but it felt like bs. Apparently it was. Because 4 days later she showed up at my apartment and basically told me her friend pressured her into it. Her friend is not exactly a nonpartisan, nor unbiased person. Her relationship with relationships will be excluded here but we both agreed it was not exactly a great idea to be guided by the ultimatum the friend gave out. Me or her. My partner faltered and gave in. I got a text. She told me everything she wrote was pretty much bs in order to make it at least seem like she had a real reason. I took her back.

We have since had a disgustingly traumatic Christmas with my family that I won’t disclose, and a very long Christmas break after that. Stress grew. This is a very time consuming semester for us both, taking many hours of classes and other commitments. We have tried to work away from previous problems, but recently came up with a list of new ones to solve. Here are a few important ones.

From her:

- concerns over uneven codependency in emotions/mental health
- Trust issues to be treated differently

From me:
- Resentment over being broken up with over text.
- Working against conflicting needs in relationship on multiple fronts (Sexual, Relaxation, Conflict) such as her needing time apart and me needing quick working solutions
- Dealing with all of these issues during college, especially these next semesters, while also searching for peace with familial issues, financial stability, and recovery.
- Uncomfortable with the month of sexual activity between us dating

So I come to ask, is this all reasonable to work through? Commitment is massive to me, and sticking to my word as well. But the frequency of issues alongside the weight of a relationship at this point in life makes figuring it all out so hard. I do a hard degree at a very hard school. I’m virtually cut off from my family and I’m currently going through a lot of soul searching. This is hard, but I want to believe it’s worth it? I regretting treating her horribly when we broke up initially. I don’t want to hurt her again.

Also we did eventually reconnect on the sexual compatibility. My journey with kink is very different than hers though. I will note that the disconnect has had some very real repercussions in our sex life, which I am not very satisfied with at the moment (I believe she is though).",1,1738192440.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

He is awkward and says edgy stuffs a lot. He'd say things like he wishes downfall/death on the friends he has disagreements with, that sort of deal. Everyone else goes along with it because that's just how he is.

Timmy doesn't know but at that point in time I was going through a dark place. I had just the week before admitted to my partner about by persistent suicidal thoughts. I'm doing much much better now. Til this day my partner is the only person who knows.

That night, Timmy being Timmy, loudly announced to me, ""If I give you money will you kill yourself?"" I was taken aback. He kept going, ""I'll give you money if you kill yourself. ""

I responded by extending my hand signalling to him to give me the money, he hesitated then gave me a quarter. Another friend, I guess as a way to lighten up the mood, gave me another quarter. I think we joked a bit more about me killing myself before moving on with the night.

I thought my partner didn't notice our conversation but when we got back to his place and I placed the quarters on his desk, he looked at me and said ""no suicide, ok?"" I said no. He asked me if I was upset at his jokes, and I just blurted out, ""No, Timmy is just a r/*t/*rd."" Yeah, I know, my word choice wasn't the best. My partner chuckled and we left it at that.

For months the two quarters just stayed in the same place where I set them down. Eventually I put the quarters away but they are still in my partner's place. I don't want to take them. 

There is no moral to be had, no rhyme nor reason behind this story. I'm just throwing it out there because somehow, after months, it stills bugs me slightly and I don't know why. ",29,1738192154.0,offmychest,16,0.97,False

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

From here, as soon as I drop off I see a new list of orders. I keep picking and delivering. Sometimes for a bit of fun I will take a trip out of town. These ones are sort of like taking a break because after delivery there are no missions as I am out of range and have to head back to the city.

I drink coffee all day and will stop and piss at McDonalds, Walmart or CostCo and usually get another coffee.

I do not eat during the entire time I shop because it slows me down. I work 3 days a week, sometime 4. I prefer to do all day shifts and will work for 10 to 14 hours each outting. 

I enjoy the cardio and because I don't eat I am also losing a bit of weight which is good because I am slightly overweight.

When I get home I get unbelievably baked and then I eat.

Known Issues as of V0.17.0

Most audio is still Homeworld 3 Default assets. The audio system for Homeworld 3 uses Wwise and the rebuild of the projects to get custom audio in game is still WIP.

Resource Collector Harvesting VFX does not currently function, this is being investigated.

Vaygr T2 Assault Frigate spawns the incorrect Death Debris (A Kushan Assault Frigates)

Multiplayer Map TheOutpost may still have collision bugs.

Multiplayer Map ReturnToTheGarden may cause lag when entering nebulas, this map is getting a redesign to correct this problem.

Taiidan Faction may impact performance more so than the Kushan Faction. This is being investigated.

If you have any issues please report them and I will look into them. As well I do take feature requests if they are feasible and can be worked into the timeline so feel free to ask away.

1id79pm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1id79pm/aio_for_requesting_my_graduation_party_money/,AIO for requesting my graduation party money?,"Hi first time posting here, I (25m) recently graduated with my doctorate degree in occupational therapy. About 2 months ago my parents talked about throwing me a graduation party and I said I’d rather do a family trip with my aunts and uncles and my grandparents- rent an Airbnb somewhere and just have fun for a weekend. They said they had to throw a party and I relented. 
It didn’t take long for it to become an issue as I’m someone that doesn’t like big parties and giving off pretentious vibes. My parents never discussed the party with me and apparently it was quickly becoming the most extravagant and pretentious party I’d feared. It was being held at banquet hall (we’ve been there for multiple weddings), had a dj, a photo booth, catering drinks from a coffee house, and I was expected to dance as if it was my wedding. 
I am someone that 100% absolutely can’t stand the spotlight or even just a modicum of attention. I like being in the background and being the person that observes and listens rather than the social butterfly. Right away I was upset with all the developments and had an argument with my mom. Eventually I relented again as people from my family were telling me to just do it for my parents who just want to show they’re proud.
The day of the party came and I was irritated by everyone and everything but I put on a semi-positive attitude and decided to just power through the event. At the end of the night my parents counted up all the money that was gifted to me (not gonna put a number but it was in the 5-figure range). I haven’t asked about the money in over a week, just kind of waiting for them to bring it up but it never came. So today I decided to bring it up with my mom to which she replied “why would we give you any of it?”. She says they want to hold the money for my engagement (future engagement because I am not even talking to anyone currently).
Right away I thought she was screwing with me and I legit laughed with her until I quickly found out she was being serious. Right away I blew up and even went digging through her nightstand and under the bed (definitely know I was overreacting here). I decided to ignore her for the rest of the day to avoid escalating the situation even further.
My uncle was over and texted me to see what was going on. I explained the situation to him and he was on my parents side. He stated I was being ungrateful to parents after all they’ve helped me through when it came to money for school. He also said that all the people that came to the party and gifted me were friends of my parents anyways and that they only gift that money out of respect for my parents. But by logic does that mean that every birthday, graduation party, and even wedding money belong to your parents? To me this isn’t about the money, it’s more so the fact that they threw me a party that I practically begged them to not throw for me and then withheld the money that was gifted to me. The part that bothers me most and I think has me the most pressed with this whole thing is the way my mom and uncle kept looking at me like I was crazy and continually asked if I was on something. I just could really use that money to square off the rest of my student debt and start paying for the things I’ve been putting off for the last couple years like my cars bumper. I know I could’ve reacted better with how I initiated the confrontation but overall AIO in this situation? 

Sorry for the long post I know I blabber on a lot.
TL;DR: Parents threw me a graduation party that I really did not want and are now holding my graduation money for future engagement party (I am not with anyone).",2,1738191482.0,AmIOverreacting,4,0.76,False

Dodge City

Colton Kane was a man of few words but many actions. His eyes spoke louder than any words. Behind the charming gaze and relaxed posture hid a man who had seen too much death and survived too much evil. He was a wanderer, a man without roots, who sought peace in a restless world. He was a retired gunslinger and outlaw who had enough of a life on the run. But people don't forgive some deeds. In whatever city he came to, they would look at him with fear and nervousness. They prayed that the day would come soon when he would leave town. As much as he tried to forget, the past caught up with him. He would always remember his mentor, Jebediah Stone, who often said that one mistake can forever be marked. He was right. As soon as he entered Dodge, the sheriff asked him not to stay.


 Dodge was a cattle town with heavy traffic. Problems were frequent, and Kane would only add to that. He promised the sheriff that he would leave if he thought there was a chance things would go wrong. The sheriff looked like an honest man and Colt had no intention of causing him trouble. He never wanted to live the life of an outlaw, but he had no other choice. He entered the saloon and rented a room. The owner was kind and treated him with great respect. Colt knew that the reason for this was fear, not politeness.


 ""One whiskey, bartender,"" Colt muttered, sliding a coin across the wooden counter, ""And watch out for trouble. This town isn't known for its hospitality."" Looking into the glass, he remembered the words of his mentor. ""Forgetting is a luxury we can rarely afford, Colt. The past shapes us, whether we like it or not."" Jebediah was a wise man most of the time, but he ran away from his problems through alcohol. It cost him his life. He stood at the counter for a while and saw various faces entering the saloon. He recognized Wyatt Earp, with whom he exchanged a glance, after which they both continued their business. He saw a blackjack table, so he decided to join. He wasn't a gambler. He thought it was a waste of money. But people are engrossed while gambling, so he hoped to distract his mind a little from his past. As soon as he sat down at the table, two men got up. They said they had lost too much, but he knew the real reason. Only he, an older man named Jerome, and the dealer played. In the first round, his card total was 20, Jerome had 19, and the dealer had 25. Colt won. The two of them praised him, but he knew that the only goal of this game was to have more luck than your opponent. He played a few more rounds and then decided to withdraw. In the end, he lost 14 cents, but he earned something more valuable. He earned the trust of several people in the saloon. They looked at him like everyone else, not like a beast capable only of killing. He ordered soup and sat down at a table in the corner. Jerome sat next to him.

""Why did you come to this town?"" he asked him.

""I'm looking for an answer myself.""

""I know you used to be...""

Colt interrupted him, ""You don't have to remind me of that, but I assure you I didn't come to cause trouble.""

""Have you been here before?""

""Just passing through, but it seems like a decent place.""

""Looks can be deceiving.""

""Why?""

""The city has everything you need, but because of that it attracts many people, of different characters, who end up fighting. Too much traffic.""

""I hope things get better.""

""Me too. Enjoy the rest of the evening.""


Jerome got up and returned to the blackjack table. Colt continued to sit at the table and think about his past. He remembered one pre-war incident when he chased Will O'Rubenford in the town of St. Anabel in Arizona. A large reward was promised for his head, so Colt decided to try. He followed them from Colorado to St. Anabel where they camped and hid the loot. Will wanted to retire, but he had to do one more job before that. Robbing the Hutchingson bank in New Orleans. But things went south. Bruce and Mike, 2 brothers from the gang, were moles. Will blew up. He killed all the members except Mike and Bruce, who escaped, and Navajo John and the black man Bob, who survived. He was told about these events by Navajo John, a few years later. He was born in a small town in Montana. His mother was half Navajo, and his father was a sheriff. When his father disappeared, John ran away with the gang. Colt wondered where John was now, but something startled him. He ordered another drink. He sat for a long time observing the atmosphere, then used the only thing Jebediah left him. His memoirs. He randomly opened the page where there was an Indian proverb ""You can't wake a man who pretends to be asleep.""


""Excuse me, is this seat taken?"" a woman asked him.

Colt shook his head, ""Feel free.""

The woman sat down and ordered a drink, ""My name is Sarah,"" she said.

""Colton,"" he replied briefly.

""Beautiful name. Where are you from?""

Colt hesitated, as he didn't like to reveal too much to strangers, ""I'm just passing through.""

""Nice place, isn't it?"" she said, looking around, ""Although it can be dangerous.""

""I believe it.""

""Are you new here?""

""Yes.""

""Don't worry, most of them are friendly. If you need anything, I have a shop across the street.""

""I'll keep that in mind."" He smiled.

Sarah smiled too, ""I hope to see you again, Colton.""

""Me too.""


Soon after, Colt retired to his room and slept until dawn. When he woke up, he went downstairs to the saloon for breakfast. Only the bartender, Jerome, and the sheriff were there. The sheriff came only to check if there had been any problems last night, then left.


""Are you up for a game, Kane?"" Jerome asked him.

""Why not.""

""Do you plan to stay longer?""

""Anything is possible,"" Colt replied with a slight smile, ""But how come you're here already?""

""I like to get up early.""

""How long have you been in Dodge?""

Jerome sighed, ""Since I was born.""

""What did the sheriff want?""

""He was checking if everything was okay last night,"" Jerome replied, ""He asked about you too.""

""What did you tell him?""

""That you seem like a decent young man.""

Colt smiled, ""Thank you, although I wouldn't exactly call myself a young man.""

Jerome smiled, ""We all age, but some things never change.""

Colt looked into his coffee cup, ""What do you mean?""

""People. Their desires and fears. The longing for freedom, peace, and a happy life. We all want more or less the same thing - peace, freedom, and family. But fate often deals us differently.""

Colt nodded, ""I agree.""


And at that moment the sheriff entered the saloon, with a serious expression on his face.


""Colt, I need to talk to you.""

""Excuse me for a moment,"" Colt said to Jerome.

""No problem,"" Jerome replied.

Colt and the sheriff went outside, while Jerome continued to drink coffee.

""Where's the fire, friend?"" Colt jokingly asked.

""Before the war you met Navajo John in Arizona, didn't you?"" the sheriff asked.

""Yes, why?""

""Do you know where John might be now?""

""I heard he became a Texas Ranger. But why again?""

""If you ever meet him, tell him I have a few things to tell him.""

""He's not involved in robberies anymore, as far as I know.""

""Not because of that. It's something personal between the two of us.""

""Alright.""

""Also, if you ever need money, O'Rubenford has a barbershop in New Orleans. I think he'll easily sing where the loot is.""

""I'll keep that in mind. Goodbye, sheriff.""

""So long.""


Colt returned to the saloon and played a few more rounds of poker, then returned to his room. He lay on the bed and thought long about the sheriff's request. After a few hours he returned to the saloon, which was now full. He went to the counter and ordered a drink. He watched the atmosphere in the saloon. A blond young man entered the saloon.


""I've been looking for you, Kane,"" he said arrogantly.

""I don't give autographs, kid,"" Colt let him know that he wasn't taking him seriously.

""I challenge you to a duel.""

""I refuse.""

The young man reached for his revolver, but Colt was faster.

""I'll walk out of the saloon, and you won't follow me. Clear?"" Colt said, holding the young man at gunpoint.


Colt walked out of the saloon and headed towards the stables. He decided he would leave town. The young man followed Colt, but Jerome stood in front of him.

""Where do you think you're going



II
Fire Baptism

Colt wandered the prairies of Kansas, thinking about his past. His parents, Karen and Sam Kane, were robbers who operated from California to Missouri. When Colt was born, they decided to retire, but they couldn't. When he turned 6, they left him in Missouri and returned to the west. Father Joseph, who was a priest in the city church, occasionally brought food to Colt. However, neither Joseph nor Colt's neighbors, the Andersons, wanted to constantly care for him. He survived by begging and stealing from wealthy strangers who passed through the city. On Sundays, he always went to church, because he would get a free meal. Colt lived this way until the age of thirteen, when he got a job in a local store. This was a new opportunity for a normal life for him. The salary in the store was not enough for a normal life, so he still had to beg. When Colt was 16, a famous outlaw named Jebediah Stone came to town. Jebediah was tall and frowning, with a gaze that could penetrate the soul. Due to an unhealthy lifestyle, he was also extremely thin. He wore a wide hat and a leather vest, and he had 2 revolvers at his waist. Colt admired him, but at the same time he felt fear when he was near him. However, he was eager for his attention. He often went to the saloon hoping to see Jebediah, but he was as cold as ice. One night Jebediah ordered a drink in the saloon when Colt sat down near him.


""I heard you're a hard worker,"" Jebediah said, ""But I think you're capable of much more.""

Colt blushed, ""I don't know what you're talking about,"" he muttered.

Jebediah laughed, ""I'm not playing with you, boy. I see potential in you. I can teach you everything I know. Tomorrow, when you're done with work, come to the saloon.""


He was startled from his thoughts. He came to a small town near the border with Oklahoma. He didn't plan to stay long. He entered the half-empty saloon. He approached the counter when he felt a revolver at the back of his head.


""Hands up, cowpoke,"" the attacker said.

""You've mistaken me for someone else,"" 
Colt said, trying to remain calm.

""Nobody has a face as ugly as yours, Colt 45,"" the attacker said.

""I'm just passing through and...""

""Calm down. I thought you'd recognize my voice,"" the attacker said, then lowered his revolver.

Colt turned around, ""I've seen funnier jokes. But how come you're in Kansas, John?""

I was curious about why nothing seemed to bother him. He surely had his ups and downs as I recall but somehow he remained even-keeled throughout. I met up with him in our local pub and I just flatly asked. “John, Why are you so Zen-like?” 

He chuckled at first until he realized that I was serious.

—--

Tabula Rasa. Alright, let’s start there—a blank slate of the mind.

The weather’s been pleasant the last few weeks, and I’ve been reading a lot of books that cultivate spirituality. I know for a fact that when the weather turns hot and humid in the next few months, I’ll probably get tired of reading and just binge-watch *The Sopranos* instead. Then I get to watch my mind shift from a giddy hippie to a wannabe gangster. 

\[He chuckles and I was like “Huh? Oh boy... Here we go.”\]

Last time it was Narcos. A good show you know. Plomo o Plata! I thought that was an important step for me after immersing myself in spirituality. I was feeling all good and one with everything but it didn’t seem right. It didn’t seem authentic and practical. It’s like I’m losing touch with the harshness that can be experienced in the world. Yeah… Life can be really tough sometimes… Dostoevsky's Prince Myshkin, all saint-like, thrusted into the realities of the world, that guy ended up in a mental asylum. 

I had to balance it out. And I believe I was right…

\[He paused for a few seconds. Ah, the awkward silence. I wanted to ask him if he was alright but I was more concerned about how to get out of this conversation that seemed to be going off the rails.\]

Heh. \[he continues\] Such is the mind you know? So malleable... 

The point of bringing this up is to be aware of how fickle it is, how easily it bends to stimuli. Think happiness, sadness, excitement, boredom—it’s all just a response to external (and uh… sometimes internal) factors. There’s biology in it, too—sometimes it’s as simple as a lack of proper nutrients, oxygen in the brain, or the way our minds react to stimulant intake or withdrawal. 

Life is an opinion man. Marcus Aurelius said that. You know that guy from Gladiator 1? The dad of Joaquin Phoenix, the one he stabbed? Heh. Imagine Joker stabbing a Roman emperor... Funny eh? That’s just an artistic representation though, don’t think Marcus was actually killed by his own son. He was just dealing with the plague back in his day. Probably died from it.

Anyway, Life is an opinion. Yes. Our judgment dictates how we see things—not the person, not the environment, but our interpretation of it. Basically whatever that goes on externally is something that is not in our control. Everything outside the realm of us, we have no control over it. But how we view them though, the opinion, we can learn to handle.

Like when someone cuts you off in traffic. You think, “Wow, that guy’s a jerk,” you’re going to feel annoyed even angry. But if you think, “Maybe he needs to do a number 2” and you laugh then you start remembering the bad sushi you had before and start puckering your butt in recollection, or “Maybe he’s rushing to the hospital” then you’re concerned recalling how would you react if you're in a life and death situation? Suddenly, it’s not personal. The event didn’t change—just your opinion of it. So it’s how you see things man. Perspective. Life is an opinion.

That’s the West’s Stoicism in a nutshell. It usually just stops in the mind though but what I found out is that it’s a wonderful complement to the East. 

The East offers a more deeply centered solution: discovering your True Nature—the Witness of the mind. When you discover that, it becomes hard to take the mind seriously anymore. You start to notice its autonomous mood shifts, its sparks of creativity, its constant gasping for stimuli when left undistracted. Meditation has a way of showing you this. I immersed myself in Vedanta before that Narcos show you see. It was very effective for me in capturing this centeredness of the Witness. The Observer. Funny that superhero cartoon show The Watcher is kinda like that. To be uninvolved. But that’s just you know, it’s an artistic representation. It’s probably based on what their writers got from the East. Many of their stories are.

Anyway, the beauty of Vedanta is that it teaches you that you are not your mind. You are not your emotions, nor your troubles, nor your sorrows. You are the unaffected Witness that lights up all experiences. Personally, I think of it as a pivot point.

In Vedanta’s traditional explanation, it’s represented by the sound AUM. Spelled A-U-M, not O-M. You know the sound that meditators chant. AAAAAUUUUUMMMMMMMM….

* **A** represents the waking state.
* **U** represents the dream state.
* **M** represents the deep sleep state.

But what’s often overlooked is the silence between the repetitions of AUM.…..AUM…..AUM…..AUM…..

That silence, the deliberate pause, is what surrounds the waking, dream, and deep sleep states. That silence is the Divinity. That’s your True Nature—Atma, the light that illuminates all three.

Now, I should say I’m not a trained teacher of Vedanta. It’s probably best to seek out proper scholarly gurus who can guide you responsibly. If my guru hears this, he’d probably smack me on the head for butchering the explanation. \[He snickers mischievously\]

Heh. Hey, what can I do? I’m a student—always will be. So take this as a very soft introduction, something to see if what the East offers resonates with you.

That said, I’ve thought deeply about this and have my version of the AUM explanation that I feel like sharing. Maybe it adds to the time-tested methods, maybe not. But whatever, here’s how I think about it:

The waking state—you’re in it now. You’re listening to me. If you think you’re dreaming, you probably need some coffee or a cold shower. The waking state is our normal routine: work, bills, lunch, dinner, throwing out the trash. Day in, day out, it’s familiar. Predictable. We know that it’s us awake.

The deep sleep state often gets a lot of attention in Vedanta. “How can we witness deep sleep?” sparks a lot of philosophical debate. It’s very heady. Personally, I’d rather look at IG models than get deep into that. \[He said that proudly with a grin\] My simpleton brain doesn’t want to engage with it but I think it somehow relates to how an inanimate object is supposed to have Consciousness. That’s Consciousness with the big C. It has Consciousness but it doesn’t have the awareness to perceive and appear conscious.  Anyway, I’ll leave that to the masters to orchestrate.

Instead, I want to focus on the dream state because you know, I dream, you dream. Almost everyone dreams every night. When we dream, we’re there, right? Fully present. But here’s what’s interesting: we don’t really question the backstory of the dream. If we’re talking to a friend in a dream, we don’t ask how we got there or why. We just go along with it.

Now before you get any ideas if this is a dream or not, bear with me for a second. Let’s talk about weird stuff that happens in the dream first. I think it helps for the point that I’m trying to make.

\[He pauses for a bit\] 

Flying. \[he says\] There’s flying in dreams—when I fly, it’s like I’ve known how to do it my whole life. I want to say R. Kelly but I don’t think it’s appropriate anymore. Heh. 

Oh, you know, what the hell. I BELIEVE I CAN FLY. I BELIEVE I CAN TOUCH THE SKY. 

\[That was a bit cringey\]

But when we dream it feels second nature. You don’t need to believe it, you just do it. You just take off and fly. You know, wwfffftttttt! Like Superman. But when I wake up, I clearly know I can’t fly no matter how hard I try. So what are these believed backstories that are totally inapplicable to real life? It’s like you have stored memories that justify how you are in that dream of yours.

The “me” in the waking state and the “me” in the dream state—clearly, those are two different “me’s.” But one thing is constant: You Witness both of them just the same. We’re present in both states, but the “me” shifts. So who are we really? If you get it, that’s our True Nature. The light that reveals all our personas, whether we’re dreaming or awake. The pivot point that stays fixed.

\[Our beers and wings arrived at this point- I thought it was timely as I was trying to process what he’d said. For whatever reason I remembered Chappelle’s skit of R Kelly instead of trying to comprehend what was just laid out to me. I was thinking about why sometimes raindrops are warm. And then John continued casually and broke my reverie.\]

From a scientific perspective, \[while munching on his wings\], you could say the “me” in dreams is just the result of the prefrontal cortex taking a backseat while the limbic system and default mode network weave random thoughts into a story. 

It’s like \[while holding a wing in his greasy hands and pointing to several parts of his head\] a variation of activity in our brains that shifts reality for us.

\[“What is this the Matrix?” I asked.\]

\[He laughed and nodded his head and smiled devilishly like the Jack Nicholson yes meme. I’m not sure if he was joking or not but upon thinking about it now I get tiny knots in my stomach. Then he quipped with a more serious face.\]

That’s not really the point of this my man. Dream and reality are indeed products of the brain, but if you go into that deeply, wait when your electric bill arrives and the other utilities that need to be settled. I’m picking up the bill, by the way, I call dibs.

But the point is just that, utility. What’s the use of questioning reality when we have our lives to live, you know responsibilities… Are you going to not brush or floss anymore because you think this is not real? Are you just going to leave your bills unpaid? Come on now. The pragmatic use of this is… is to selectively apply it to what bothers us the most internally. You know like sometimes we get all sucked into our problems and end up sulking and asking WHY IS THIS HAPPENING TO ME… \[He was doing the Willem Dafoe Platoon pose while reciting the words. Still with a chicken wing on his hand mind you.\]

You asked me why I seem so Zen right? This is what it is for. \[He finishes eating and starts wiping his hands and mouth\]

So the shifts in mood be it sadness or the joy we feel are as fluid as the shifts between the waking and dream states. We can apply it there because it is generally the same. They’re like Instagram filters, where we turn into different things but still know it’s *us* under the filter. In this metaphor, the “us” on the screen is our True Nature—unchanging, constant. The filters just get so engaging that we end up identifying with them. 

Just like, just like… I got to do this. Just like “*emotions taking me over.  Caught up in sorrow, lost in the soooooooong…”* \- Nothing more funnier than a straight man singing Destiny’s Child. Heh.

If this all sounds like jargon, that’s okay. There are modern approaches to dealing with the mind’s malleability. Cognitive defusion, for example, is one. Cognitive Behavior Therapy is another one, or I think they’re just one and the same. Ah just look it up, I’m no expert. But the main idea of those is to create space between you and whatever’s troubling you internally. It is very doable.

Say you feel sad. Instead of becoming a full embodiment of the sad face emoji, you can think:“Hmm… it’s weird that I feel sad today. It’s just a regular day. Did I sleep poorly? Is it this new diet? Am I just sore from working out? Or is it the cold weather? Maybe I’m burnt out. Let’s try some jumping jacks, get some endorphins going, see what happens.”

The idea is to observe the feeling like a doctor diagnosing a patient. Explore it. Reframe it. It’s a method anyone can use. Personally, I discovered it almost 20 years ago when I googled “how to handle emotions.” I didn’t even know what it was at that time but the concept of seeing myself in the third person and observing my emotions compounded and I sort of got good at it because it was easy to do. It became a natural tendency that helped me stay even-keeled whenever I found myself in an emotional state. It is very doable.

There are a lot of other ways to deal with undesirable states, maybe even prayer can help in some way but I’m not the one to be asked as I never practiced it. 

But I’m a little biased you know. I like Vedanta. It resonated with me well because upon the discovery of Atma, the True Nature, The Witness, this Centeredness made the latency to handle the malleable mind a lot quicker.

\[What do you mean?\]

Hmm… It’s like Jedi mind shit man… 

Nah, I’m kidding.

What’s unique about Vedanta is their methodology of building up hours and hours of discussion, reflection, and contemplation, and then consolidating it into a phrase or two. “Tat Tvam Asi”, You Are That! YOU are that Consciousness. You won’t really get it at first because that phrase still holds no meaning but when you get into the practice and immerse yourself with the methodology of a responsible guru, oh it’s effective. It gets me centered really quick. It’s like when I notice an undesirable thought or emotion I can just dismiss it without needing to rationalize it. Just swipe to the left like a Tinder profile with red flags all over it.

Heh. My guru used to say like when dealing with a headache. “It’s just what’s on today’s menu.” Nonchalant, not absorbed in what he’s experiencing. 

\[What is that meditating? Like astral powers?\]

What? No. \[he chuckles\]. No man. That’s movie stuff.

It’s more grounded than that. It’s like he’s not attached to it because he does not identify with the headache. He is the Observer, not the experiencer. He identifies with the Witness. That’s how he explains it. 

With me though, I see it as more of a pattern recognition situation. Like when I understood this Centeredness, where it is or in a more accurate term, Who it is (pointing at himself) I get to distance myself quickly from the emotion. What compliments it though is the amount of experiences I integrate into it. The more challenges I internalize and see as “to be not affected with”, the quicker it is for me to dismiss them the next time it hits or when something similar to it happens. That’s where Atma=Brahma comes in.

\[What’s that?\]

That’s probably a few week's worth of classes right there so I have to oversimplify so you can sort of gauge if this would still interest you or not. Basically in mainstream words “You are the Universe”. You are the one who Witnesses everything. Everything means including all the things you know, you don’t know, you don’t know that you don’t know as well as everything you can perceive and not perceive, and things you don’t know that you can not perceive. That’s You. If I were to oversimplify this even further which will make this even more brutally imprecise, it’s about expanding what you can include in the things you tend to attach or identify with. It’s extremely useful for dealing with what makes one suffer.

\[I don’t get it. I’m not following\]

Yes, because you need a well-trained guru for that. Otherwise, if it’s a confused teacher guiding you, even a well-meaning one, you’ll both end up equally confused. You don’t ask me to teach you calculus right? I barely passed algebra man. You go to an expert. Try Arsha Bodha in Jersey. If you can’t go there they have almost everything online now. Don’t cost anything but an optional donation.

\[Wait but is what you're referring to enlightenment? You can get that from Vedanta? Are you enlightened?\]

Haha. Well, that depends on what you think enlightenment is. If you’re thinking about our main man Keanu Reeves, all bliss like in that movie Little Buddha or that Matrix movie where he sees code everywhere, then no it’s not that. It’s far from that. It’s definitely not that. Those are simply artistic renditions meant to inspire us to wonder if there’s something more to life. It’s something that can spark the spiritual curiosity of the viewer. Maybe even take a spiritual journey for, who knows?

But when you say you get enlightened like I understand the teaching, I have internalized it, and have integrated it with my life then yes, you can get that from Vedanta.

\[I’m still confused as to what it is.\]

Heh. Hmm.. Let’s try it this way then. The purpose of enlightenment is so we can handle whatever life throws with certainty. We’re confident in ourselves. Secure. It’s so we do not suffer when things go bad for us. Pain? Sure we’ll still feel pain but we do not get too absorbed with it and get stuck in a negative frame of mind. It’s like when something bad happens and we feel sad, it’s not that we are sad. We, the Unaffected Observer see that the mind of this person seems sad. So you just know that you are not sad. It’s quick. Like a snap of a finger. It’s not magic or anything, it’s similar or close to instinct.

\[What so you will never get sad?\]

Ah, yes and no. Yes, you can still get sad but you won’t get attached to it. The classic example of that is when you watch a movie and some parts are sad, then you cry and feel bad but when the movie ends, you are fine. Because you know that it was just a movie. You simply watched actors playing the part of a drama, you were never part of that movie. 

But you don’t become a robot where you don’t feel anything. You’ll remain human. You won’t transform into anything. You’ll still be you just with an understanding that you’ll be fine regardless.

A classic explanation is, that a man who chops wood and carries water will still chop wood and carry water after enlightenment. The subtle difference is just that he will do it with peace of mind. With equanimity. Contentment. Sometimes even with a smile and if bold enough with grace. It’s very grounded and very light in here \[pointing to his chest\].

\[the bill came shortly after that. I pretended that I got it and asked about what was going on in his life. He answered and asked me the same and we shared pleasantries. When we were about to part ways I couldn’t resist asking again. “John, you never answered my question, are you enlightened or not?”

He smiled and said “Does it matter? That’s just a label. If you are curious about enlightenment, why don’t you go find out for yourself? See what it is really about. What matters is what you come to realize. Because you are the one that’s in there, not me.”
