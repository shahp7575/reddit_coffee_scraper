1l8fmbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diverticulitis/comments/1l8fmbp/zantac360_during_a_flare_up/,Zantac360 during a flare up,"Suffice to say, I've had non-acute (smouldering?) diverticulitis for several months and only in the last week did my doctor prescribe 2 antibiotics (Flagyl and Ceftin) for a short course of 5 days.

During that time I had quite fast relief from pain/aches in my lower left abdomen. I think to myself, great!! This must be a good course of treatment.

A few days go by and I'm still having some pain in my upper left abdomen, near the left side of my stomach and ribs. I think to myself, this kinda feels like an ulcer.

That night, I pop a Zantac 360 and when I wake up - wow! no pain at all! Upper or lower left abdomen! 

And then I think to myself, hey you idiot - maybe your freakish love of really strong espresso drinks has been taking a toll!?!? So, I stop some coffee for the next few days. Massive headache (I know, expected).

My question: has anyone else had the combo experience like this? Are they related? Is this what UC is like?

Thanks in advance!

I know this sub gets this question asked all the time, but everyone has different priorities when moving to a new place and no one knows this place better than you all. 

My partner and I are planning to move from urban Western Washington State to the Twin Cities area at the end of this year or early next year and would love some input on where we should look into buying. This is our first home and our budget is only about 300k, but we don't need a huge home. 

Some of the things that we value:

- green spaces nearby (especially larger wooded ones) and/or access to well maintained walking trails
- walkability to small shops/coffee shop (but not necessarily everything)
- managable random crime (would rather not have to be on constant lookout for porch pirates and I would like to feel safe enough to walk around on my own, but also we know to keep our door locked and plan to avoid homes that don't have some form of off-street parking, we've already had our car broken into a couple time at our current place)

We are also specifically looking for a single family home with a little character and a yard decent enough for a few chickens. Definitely don't want the to live in the suburbs where all the houses look the same. Also, we both work from home, so we don't need to be particularly close to either city center. 

Let me know what y'all think and why you prefer certain neighborhoods! I've only visited the Twin Cities briefly, but it was beautiful when I was there!

1l8fhc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Beastars/comments/1l8fhc4/watched_the_series_with_my_mom/,Watched the series with my mom,"So I decided to watch the series with my mom. She used to be in the furry fandom (a suit maker actually) and said that honestly the only reason she never watched it was basically due to the pure amount of ranting people were doing with the series, making her decide to never really watch it, so I had her watch it now that it's been so long. 

To sum it up: She really liked it. There was a lot of scenes that made her laugh, as well as other strong reactions due to it (which isn't uncommon, but it's definitely been a while since I've seen her laugh so much due to a series.

So, have some of her best random reactions which I remember (not in exact order, just ones I can remember):

Season 1 reaction highlights:

""For being someone who hates Legoshi so much THAT DEER IS SHOWING A LOT OF FREAKING INTEREST""

""...Ok since it's clear Louis is gay for Legoshi yet also is with Haru... by this point is it safe to assume they just have an orgy...?"" \[When it's revealed that Louis is having his visits with Haru\]

""I'M FUCKING SORRY, DOES JUNO RAPE LOUIS? Oh... no she's just... an overdramatic fuck..."" \[Juno 'Decleration of war' scene\]

""So- does Bill actually eat the dude's finger?... Wouldn't surprise me considering how much of a bitch he is..."" 

""Wait- the guys who kidnapped Haru are Lions- IS THE GOD DAMN MAYOR BEHIND THIS!?!?!?""

""OH- NOW LOUIS IS BATSHIT INSANE- THAT'S JUST GREAT-"" \[When Louis laughs after killing Shishigumi leader\]

Season 2 reactions:

""Ok so lemme guess... Louis is somehow the leader of the lion mafia guys."" \[Casually guessing the lore immediately\]

""...I swear to god if the source of the noise is some snake bit- GOD FUCKING DAMNIT-"" 

\[Incert mom happily and mockingly saying ""Shishi"" every time the sign that marks their base is shown due to it appearing in subtitles for some reason lol\]

""Wait- so where does he run off to? Panda guy? YAY PANDA GUY""

""WAIT WHAT THE HELL IS PANDA GUY DOING TO LEGOSHI?!?"" \[Chair scene\]

\[Can't really remember any other funny reactions for the season unfortunately\]

Season 3:

""Wait- his grandfather is... a fucking alligator...? No..."" \*begins naming every reptile species which can come to mind\*

""But- if you hate mixed kids so much WHY THE  F U C K  ARE YOU HELPING ONE!? Oh... you're just trying to be petty..."" \[Yafya having Legoshi work with him to get the devouring record stuff removed\]

""...Ok so he's just giving lion gang coffee- WAIT A FUCKING MOMENT, HE'S A CIVET- DEAR GOD..."" 

""WAIT- why is her grave in the messy graveyard- WHY IS IT IN THE MESSY GRAVEYARD- PLEASE TELL ME IT'S JUST DUE TO HER BEING MIXED AND NOT WHY I THINK IT IS-"" \[reffing to how suicides usually get buried seperately\]

""...Ok, so this dude is just... furry joker...""

""SERIOUSLY- THE DUDE GETS SHOT AGAIN!!!??!?!?""

""...So let me guess.... everyone got pissed at Netflix due to not being able to put two and two together that the seal guy told Legoshi how to call for help, meaning in reality he uses that knowledge and survives, but people who don't have magna context still assumed he actually dies- WAIT WHAT THE FUCK- MELON IS HARU'S FUCKING TEACHER!!!?

1l8fdxw,https://i.redd.it/gmk2t935376f1.jpeg,I told my psych that Concerta is making me sleepy…this was her response?,"I have seen quite a few posts on Reddit (here and in other subs) and just in my general Googling that some people experience drowsiness when taking Concerta. I’m not talking about a crash after it wears off at the end of the day; rather, about 2 hours after taking it, I can pretty reliably count on being tired/sleepy most of the time. 😴 The fatigue only lasts a short time, maybe an hour or so, but I can definitely feel it.

I messaged my psych about this and this was her response. Anyone else who experienced this side effect get this kind of feedback from their practitioner? I trust her and she’s honestly great, but honestly my only change in routine has been this medication, so I’m just like…🤷🏻‍♀️🧐

I started the medication a month ago and have been on an 18mg dose that I take around 6:30-7am. I try to always eat at least some of my breakfast first (don’t always finish it bc of the appetite suppression), and I try to wait and drink coffee until after I’ve taken it, or at least not before. I typically only have one cup of coffee in the morning, if that, and occasionally a minimal amount of caffeine at lunch in the form of a Poppi. I go to bed between 9-10pm and often wake up between 1-4am thanks to perimenopause, especially when I am not taking my cyclical progesterone, but this was also the case before I started taking Concerta.

I am hoping that increasing my dose will help, she prescribed me 27mg that I should be starting on Thursday this week (though my pharmacy just called and it’s apparently on back order sooo…).

Anyway, I would love to hear from those of you who also went through this and whether or not it eventually subsided, either with time or dosage increase. 🙏",2,1749602715.0,adhdwomen,2,1.0,False

EPS came in at $2.31, compared to $2.66 in the year-ago quarter.

The reported revenue represents a surprise of -2.18% over the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.19 billion. With the consensus EPS estimate being $2.25, the EPS surprise was +2.67%.

While investors closely watch year-over-year changes in headline numbers -- revenue and earnings -- and how they compare to Wall Street expectations to determine their next course of action, some key metrics always provide a better insight into a company's underlying performance.

As these metrics influence top- and bottom-line performance, comparing them to the year-ago numbers and what analysts estimated helps investors project a stock's price performance more accurately.

Here is how Smucker performed in the just reported quarter in terms of the metrics most widely monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts:  




* **Net Sales- U.S. Retail Frozen Handheld and Spreads**: $449.80 million versus $462.28 million estimated by four analysts on average. Compared to the year-ago quarter, this number represents a -0.2% change.
* **Net Sales- U.S. Retail Coffee**: $738.60 million versus the four-analyst average estimate of $715.26 million. The reported number represents a year-over-year change of +10.9%.
* **Net Sales- U.S. Retail Pet Foods**: $395.50 million compared to the $433.66 million average estimate based on four analysts. The reported number represents a change of -12.6% year over year.
* **Net Sales- International and Away From Home**: $308.90 million compared to the $310.83 million average estimate based on four analysts. The reported number represents a change of +3.1% year over year.
* **Net Sales- Sweet Baked Snacks**: $251 million compared to the $270.36 million average estimate based on three analysts. The reported number represents a change of -25.5% year over year.
* **Segment Profit- Sweet Baked Snacks**: $20 million compared to the $53.95 million average estimate based on three analysts.
* **Segment Profit- U.S. Retail Coffee**: $211.20 million versus the three-analyst average estimate of $182.87 million.
* **Corporate administrative expenses**: -$75.10 million versus the three-analyst average estimate of -$93.98 million.
* **Segment Profit- U.S. Retail Frozen Handheld and Spreads**: $91 million versus the three-analyst average estimate of $93.28 million.
* **Segment Profit- International and Away From Home**: $69.20 million versus the three-analyst average estimate of $62.50 million.

The Collins family is just starting to wake up. James walks down the hall and stares at the clock, which reads 7:14 AM. He grabs a box of Lucky Charms, milk, and a bowl. Turning on the TV, he puts on Star Trek. The sound of the show wakes William. President Reagan’s voice crackles from the radio, which switched on when James got up. His walkman sits next to the clock.

“You’re watching Star Trek without me?” William asks, his grogginess evident.

James chuckles, and they sit down to watch together. William glances at the clock and realizes he has to be at the train station in 30 minutes for a work trip that will last an entire month.

“We have to be at the train station in an hour, so go change clothes. I’m going to wake up your mother,” William says.

“Ok, but what should I wear?” James asks.

“Just put on a pair of jeans and any shirt you like.”

“Margaret. Margaret, réveille-toi. We need to be at the train station in an hour,” William whispers.

Margaret stretches, gets out of bed, and whispers, “Ok.”

William rushes to the bathroom to brush his teeth and take a quick shower. The sound of Star Trek, still playing, echoes through the house. Margaret walks into the hallway, yawning. She makes herself a cup of coffee.

“What are you watching?” Margaret asks, curiosity in her voice.

“Star Trek. Dad went to shower,” James replies, now dressed in clean clothes.

“C’est en français ? ”

“Yeah, but I barely speak it, so I put it in English.”

“You should really learn more French. It’s our culture and native language,” Margaret says.

William finishes his shower, eats breakfast, and grabs himself a cup of coffee. After finishing it, he pours a bowl of Cheerios and sits on the couch, focusing on the TV.

“To boldly go where no man has gone before,” the TV echoes through the house.

William and James both smile in sync. Margaret notices and studies their faces, momentarily puzzled by the shared expression.

She glances at the clock and realizes it’s now 7:22 AM.

“Guys, we need to go. William, you’re supposed to be at the train station in 20 minutes.”

“Alright, buddy, time to turn off the TV. We can watch more when I get back. Actually, as soon as I return, we’re going to the movies to watch Search for Spock.”

James perks up and smiles. The three of them get in the car and begin driving to the train station.

“What are you guys going to do while I’m gone?” William asks.

“I dunno. Probably rewatch Wrath of Khan, The Motion Picture, and every last bit of Star Trek,” James exclaims.

“Lucky! Save some Trek for me! Just make sure your schedule’s clear the day I get back—we’re watching Search for Spock together,” William says with a grin.

“That movie is a must-see. Spock’s death was sad. I need to know what happens next.”

“You guys love that sci-fi show so much, huh?” Margaret teases.

“Yes, and you should watch it too. Tu vas l’aimer. Donne une chance à Star Trek,” William says with a smile, trying to convince her in French.

“Non, ça a juste l’air ennuyeux pour moi,” Margaret replies.

“Mom, it isn’t boring. Just watch one episode—you’ll be hooked.”

“I’ll give it a chance. Just one episode. But if I don’t like it, you two don’t bring it up again.”

“Okay, fine. Oh, Margaret—I’m going to call you as soon as I get there. Immediately.”

“Alright, good. We need to know you’re okay.”

They arrive at the train station. The chill of early spring clings to the platform as Margaret watches passengers board. William, carrying a briefcase, prepares to leave on the 7:45 train.

“I can’t believe you’re going to be gone for a month,” Margaret says as she hugs him tightly.

“Don’t worry, I’ll be back before you know it,” William says, smiling as he kisses her and James. The noise of the station hums around them.

“Be good and listen to your mother,” William tells James, patting his head.

James nods. “Are you sure you have everything, William?” Margaret asks, trying to keep him close just a little longer.

“Oui, ça ira. Nothing’s going to happen,” William reassures her.

“Tu es sûr?”

“Oui. Now go. Je t’aime,” William says, kissing Margaret and stepping into the train.

“Dad, wait!” James calls out. William turns back at the door. “Yeah?”

“I have been and shall always be your friend,” James says, giving the Vulcan salute.

Margaret smiles in awe.

“Live long and prosper,” William replies, returning the salute just before the train doors shut. James lowers his hand, and he and Margaret walk back to the car.

—

Four days pass since William left. The promised call never came. James and Margaret begin to worry. They contact the police to report William missing.

“Call him again,” James urges.

“This is like the 12th time… but sure.”

The phone rings. After several seconds, it goes to voicemail. Margaret sighs, tears welling in her eyes at the thought of her husband’s death. James gently comforts her.

“I’ve had enough. We’re going down there to find him.”

Margaret grabs her keys and rushes out. James follows. As she opens the door two men in suits stand on the doorstep.

 Margaret and James freeze. She recognizes them: William’s friends, Tom and Billy. They’re dressed in both black suits, as coming from a party—or a funeral.

“Margaret, we have some terrible news,” Tom says, his face solemn.

“What’s going on?” Margaret asks, panic rising.

“We’re so sorry,” Billy says quietly.

“Sorry about what? What happened?” Margaret asks again, trying to force a smile.

“William… he had a heart attack,” Tom says, his voice heavy.

“He’s gone, Margaret. They found him alone in his hotel room.”

Margaret stands frozen. Her world flashes before her eyes. James blinks rapidly, trying to process what he’s just heard. Tom’s voice sounds distant, as if underwater. James sits himself on the couch staring at the now muted and turned off TV, and sees his dark reflection—silent and still. 

Margaret’s hand grasps the table, trembling. The wood presses deep into her palms, as her world starts to slip out of her reach. She doesn’t want to believe it. The silence in the room is deafening. Only the soft hum of the refrigerator and the ticking of the clock can be heard.

James doesn’t cry—at least not yet. The weight on his chest is unbearable.

Finally, Margaret whispers, “No… no… this cannot be.”

Tom’s eyes well with tears. Billy’s voice is caught in his throat. James’s eyes glisten.

My step daughter (teenager) and I’s second cruise, my wife’s 3rd. All Carnival, Liberty being the one we all 3 shared.

TL:dr MSC suite vs carnival/Norwegian ocean view.

Mainly interested in Caribbean. Wife prefers the Bahama area over western. 
 
We’ve looking into Carnival (smaller ships Elation, Valor, etc), MSC (Seashore), and Norwegian (Getaway). We would like to start some form of brand ‘loyalty’ for future perks, although our last one was 2019. 

We haven’t looked at many other brands as it seems like most max us at 4 guests without adding another stateroom which almost instantly doubles the cost. 

Both Carnival and Norwegian put us in an ‘ocean view’ while MSC provides us two suite options (one with the Whirlpool or a bit more for the two room suite). 

Here’s our kicker, all 3 options are within a respective few hundred bucks of each other, but offer different options. Carnival offers either 2 days at sea with a stop at Celebration and half moon, or 1 day at sea with stops at celebration/princess/nassau. MSC offers an overnighter at their Marine Reserve then a stop at Nassau, but includes their drinks/wifi/gratuities. Norwegian offers the same perks with stops at Great Stirrup, and Nassau (3 nights). 

The wife doesn’t really drink alcohol, may have a cocktail here and there, but does enjoy a soda or two a day, while the teenager loves her fancy coffee. I’m on vacation, I can drink a few cold ones. I’m assuming going through the steps for Carnival with gratuities and drinks, we’d be well into $500+ added to the grand total. 

Leaning MSC purely over offering the suite with the whirlpool on the balcony seems like a nice way to relax at night, but looking for some feedback with 5+ families. ",1,1749602390.0,Cruise,4,1.0,False

[I have been writing](https://www.reddit.com/r/AiChampions/comments/1l74kia/helping_my_brothers_obstacle_course_biz_run_on_ai/) about how I am helping him install AI into his biz this week.

The other (Huw on the right) owns [urbanbaristas.co.uk](http://urbanbaristas.co.uk)

If you are in London you should pop in and say hi! He has 20 locations, and is franchising too. I am super proud of them both. Yeah they are super successful. But more importantly they are good men.

Ev is more conservative - is a “bean counter’ by trade. Huw is more creative like me.

A few weeks ago he messaged on whatsapp and said “Bro… call this number”

So I did.

Turns out he had signed up to [High Level](https://honeysyed.com/gohighlevel) and created “Voice AI” for one of his locations. I was blown away. Not only by how with the time he is, and how fast he moves. But also how well it worked.

The voice AI handled the call beautifully. It was flawless. I was impressed, and AI is all I do. Hat tip brother!! Smart cookie.

If he can position his coffee biz as an “AI coffee biz” I am sure there will be higher multiples when Private Equity comes knocking.

You know what struck me as super cool a few days later though (with a little help from my ROYA friends)

How powerful that whatsapp message was:

“Call This Number”

Imagine if you created a Voice AI solution for your client, assigned them a number in High Level, And then sent them a Whatsapp, sms or email just like Huw did to me?

And get the client to DEMO Voice AI. Cha-F’ing-Ching. No brainer. Wallet lube… to get the clients credit card to slide out into your capable hands.

Are the cogs turning?

Here’s the thing though.

It can get expensive, complicated and time consuming if we have to create a new Voice AI for every demo. How powerful would it be if we could create an “Any Niche” Voice AI demo, which would:

Operate from a SINGLE PHONE NUMBER to save time, money & prompt writing headaches

Ask the client what niche they are in, and their business name, Transition seamlessly to a bespoke Voice AI demo for their biz, Obv “impress the sh!t” out of them.

Idea being, you can just fire off this “Any Niche” Voice AI demo to as many clients as you want. From a single number. I mean, some cold outreach peeps who are clever cookies could automate this, and do some real damage, right?

**If the idea of turning this into real client cash gets your gears turning…**

I woke up at 3am, with the lower stomach pains/cramps that can only mean a bad bathroom time is minutes away. Sorry for the tmi! Thankfully I made it in time, and while I was letting nature take its course, I got quite nauseous. Thankfully I never ended up getting sick though. I had one more unfortunate bathroom trip before I popped a ginger candy in my mouth and fell back to sleep. 

I didn’t get horrible pains - just some gnawing dull discomfort around my lower right rib area, and a bit of back pain near my right shoulder blade that felt like a muscle knot. 

I’ve been too nervous to eat much today - and had to ditch my beloved coffee in favour of tea, even. 

I have been getting some back pains and discomfort around what I feel is the traditional gallbladder pain spot - but that only started maybe 3 hours ago. I’m not in pain to the point where I’d even consider going to a doctor let alone the ER, but something is definitely off.

The last thing I ate before I went to bed last night was around 9:30, and was a large handful of kettle cooked potato chips - I went to bed around 11:30. Didn’t have any hints that something was off, aside from some heartburn, but that’s not super unusual for me (I’m on omeprazole for acid reflux). And today I’ve had oatmeal, jello, rice and chicken breast to try and help things settle down in case it was the kettle chips that set things off.

Could it be that I’ve just got some kind of lower GI problem, or is what I experienced potentially related to gallbladder issues?

Nothing seems to be working, and I’m deeply discouraged. I have no motivation left. I am located in a country where nutritionists are not a thing unfortunately as disordered eating is the norm and everyone weighs 20 kilos less than they should, often achieved by skipping meals altogether in favor of jellies and stuff. Yes, it’s frustrating. 

A bit of backstory. F (31), I’ve struggled with self-image since childhood due to my mom and older sister’s terrible relationship with food. Overweight by first year of high school, I was picked on and lost 20 kilos in a year of rigid dieting. Since then, I’ve had disordered eating until I landed my first full-blown eating disorder in my twenties after moving to the country where I now reside. At 165cm, I weighed 50 kilos. I never felt better about my appearance, but my mental health was terrible. I was proud to be “underweight,” praised by everyone. 

After that I went to therapy for years and worked on some issues including my ED and my weight went up to 59 with a lot of struggle, but I eventually felt okay with that.

Fast forward to ten years later, I gained around 10 kilos in the span of two years: lots of things happened, COVID, work and family-related stress, heartbreak, new relationship, moving in with my partner etc.  

Since February of this year I decided to try and having a better relationship with you food and starting to diet again. 

It’s now June and I haven’t dropped a single cm or kilo. A single one! All this effort for what? At some point I did drop like 1 or 2 kilos but somehow I gained them back while following the same regime. Maybe it was just water weight at this point. 

A few deets:

1) I eat healthy, no sugar except on occasion, alcohol max 1 per week and in limited portions. No soda, no sugar in my coffee and tea. 
2) I have been upping my protein intake from an average of 60 to 90 daily.
3) I exercise (40 minutes walk every day min. and hot yoga 2 or 3 times per week). Please don’t suggest gym I tried going for a couple years but it’s just not my thing I was miserable.
4) I am consistently in a 400 calories deficit. 
I track my food with MFP, often overestimating. 
Calories burned with exercise are EXCLUDED from my allotted calorie pool (MFP).
5) I want to avoid crash diets due to my history with ED. 
6) I started taking the pill at the same time when I started dieting, the first one for three months which did not work for me, now on the new one but I haven’t finished my first pack yet. It looks like it’s better. I am also on antidepressants due to a burnout, it’s been 3 years now (Lexapro, inderal and rivotril). I am anemic and also take iron and zinc as prescribed by my doctor. I also had hormone tests done before starting the pill and everything was okay.  
7) I mostly eat plant based as my partner is vegan. As we cook home we tend to make only one meal (vegan). I occasionally have meat and other stuff too if I’m dining out. 

I do think my muscles are slightly more pronounced but unfortunately I don’t seem to have dropped fat percentage, at least according to my 20$ scale I bought on Amazon. I don’t have access to inBody. If you have any recs on a good scale I’m all ears…

So I'm like cool, and I respond today asking him if he'd wanna meet at this nice cafe/bar not too far away from where he works.

A couple hours later, I wake up from my nap and I get a text from him say ""thanks for nothing"". Turns out he was under the impression that he we were meeting tonight. I'm pretty confused by this since we never mentioned another date while setting this up and only talked about setting up a time after he suggested meeting up on Friday yesterday.

We’re both 23. I’m Syrian (live in North America), she’s Persian (Europe). Neither of us had been in a relationship before, both really attractive.

Early March 2025:
We met on a travel app (I was planning a Germany trip). Started chatting, moved to IG. She was sweet, feminine, very beautiful (10/10), and later told me she had feelings for me from day 1 and even told her mom about me. But she’d often go hot/cold.

After she arrived back in Europe she started ghosting. I got worried because I’d been catfished before, so I asked for a voice message. She replied, “I’m tired and my roommate is sleeping, maybe you’ll be lucky to hear my voice later.” I replied calmly, “All good, have sweet dreams X.”

I checked her IG highlights — found her uni acceptance letter, so I knew she was real. Still, she replied slowly. A week later, after I posted an Eid pic, she replied, “Happy Eid X 😍”. We started talking again.

When I asked for a call or VM, she said, “I don’t know why everyone thinks I’m a catfish.” (remember this). I’d been through trauma from being catfished, so I pressed her a bit — eventually she sent a VM. She said she was insecure about her voice and a guy blocked her once after hearing it. I told her it was beautiful and called her Miss Angel Voice.

We had our first call the next day. She showed her ID — definitely real. We kept calling for the next 2 weeks. She was sweet and empathetic at her core, but rarely showed her face on video — “I’m shy, fat, ugly” (she wasn’t). Meanwhile, she told her friends I was her BF and love-bombed me a lot.

Cracks started showing:
She’d ask, “Why did you choose me when there are prettier girls?” I told her, “I hate how shallow girls here are. You’re beautiful. I care about vibe too.”

She’d sob and say, “If you talk about them like this, then you like them.” Then disappear before I could explain.

This pattern repeated. I asked her not to use silent treatment and explained: “My dad used to give me silent treatment — I hate it. Please tell me upfront if something is wrong.” She agreed, but still did it.

I suggested virtual dates → “I’m busy with finals” or “my introverted ass could never.” When I mentioned visiting Italy: “I’m not ready, I’m scared, I’m not good enough, I’m ugly.” I reassured her, “There’s a step 0 before that. I just want to know you more.”

She never even gave me her number we only called and texted on IG and sometimes on discord.

One day she texted, “I don’t wanna talk.” Later called me, refused to say why she’d been upset: “Not important.” Another red flag.

During a later call I turned my camera on, she didn’t. I joked, “When we go on a date in Italy, will you wear a mask?”

Cold voice: “You’ll never see me because I’m a catfish.”
She added, “You thought I was a catfish before…”
It triggered me — I realize now she held a grudge and used it to punish me.

I had written her Arabic poetry, prepared an old-style letter with a feather pen, wax seal, and €20 gift + coffee beans. She refused to give her address. I offered pickup at the post office — “I don’t speak Italian.” I offered a flower shop — “No! You’re sending someone to watch me!”

I asked her friend to forward the letter (my mistake, I was tired of guessing where I stood). A couple days later, 2 AM, she dumped me by text: “Sorry, I can’t continue a relationship. I got too much going on and can’t keep up with everything.”

I broke down crying.

When I tried calling, she didn’t answer. Later messaged, “All good. I felt that tbh.” Then: “You used to say rude things about my people. If you hate me because of my nationality, find someone else.” (total projection — she was the one trashing her own people).

I apologized. She said, “You are free to be with whoever you want.”

I said: “I know your fears and insecurities are getting the best of you. I won’t give up on you because of that.”

She replied, “Can you stop texting me?” I just liked the message.

She didn’t block me — restricted/unrestricted her stories. One looked very sad. I messaged: “Sorry X, you look really sad. Are you okay?” → She restricted me again.

I sent 2 VMs explaining my frustration and that I was ready to move on. She mocked me: “Ok, you win, can you leave me alone?”

I said: “Okay I will. Just one question — why didn’t you block me? Why unrestrict your stories?”

She said: “You wanna get blocked? Promise you won’t hate me.”

I said: “I don’t. But why do you care? Do you hate me? Be honest.”

I tried calling — she blocked me on IG.

I had her iMessage saved through her email to exclude her from silent mode and get her notifications on IG

So I messaged:
“Didn’t expect you to have the balls to do that. But I think I got my answer. Wish you the best in life.”

Best move? Maybe creepy but I did to teach her confront herself and also to make her angry so she can call and I can say good bye and hear her angelic voice on last time.

She was shocked since she never gave me her iMesaage, unblocked me on IG, called me and cussed me out:
“You’re a narcissist. I hate you. You piece of shit. Why do you keep harassing me? What do you want from me? Don’t ever call me again. Fuck off.” And blocked me again everywhere 

She’s treating like a guy she just gave her number to on the street when she lead me on and I fell in love with her “innocence” “shyness” and flaws and expects me to forget. 

It’s been a month. I still think about her. She’s not a bad person and taught me how to love myself and find comfort in solitude and not to give my attention to whoever. I hope that I taught her to love herself, confront her fears, and draw boundaries instead of just running 

But I still wonder, “what I did to deserve this unfair treatment?”",1,1749601475.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False

He has his own notes, which are in the forest, stuck tightly to the trees. Like Slenderman and his other variants, it is not known what he wants or why he does what he does, which makes him even more creepy, and perhaps it is better not to know. His symbol is a circle with a fan, which means mystery, uncertainty and fear.

HandFeetMan: He is a Slenderman in a blue suit, contrasting considerably where he appears, the forests. His tentacles are bluish, and the most notable thing about this is that he moves using his arms instead of his legs. Despite this, he is very dangerous, more than Slenderman himself, since he can go at great speeds, not so much, but if someone is careless it can end in a fatal outcome. He has his typical powers, interference, headaches, induction of paranoia and fear, and teleportation, like Slenderman and Tenderman. Its symbol is the same as Slenderman's but on its side, implying the creature's anomalous nature, the symbol symbolizes the anomalous, the unexpected and paranoia.

Armedman: Wearing a green suit, this being can camouflage himself with the surrounding nature due to his color. He has two arms, from which three greenish tentacles emerge, identical to those on his back. These tentacles are very strong and can cause problems for his victims. The interference and paranoia he causes are a little more subtle and not as aggressive, however they are still feared, since he does this to disorient his victims. He also possesses teleportation, like Slenderman and his other variants. The symbol for this is a circle with a line, which reflects uncertainty, beginning, and care.

Tallman: He is a tall, very tall Slenderman, the size of a tree. He does not have tentacles, however, his large size is what makes him terrifying, since he can catch people with his arms. He induces erratic behavior, anxiety, fear, and insanity. He can cause devices to stop working for brief moments, then restore themselves as if nothing had happened. He has teleportation, although he prefers to remain hidden among the trees without doing anything. His symbol is a circle with three stripes pointing down, which symbolize the anomalous, the unpredictable, and fear.

Whiteman: Slenderman's father, he is a slenderman in a white suit, his shirt now dark, as are his hands, and he carries a hat, and his tentacles are white. Whiteman is someone very powerful, being long-lived, and being the father of Slenderman himself, he has lived for centuries. However, Whiteman's power is not impressive, but what he does is. Like Slenderman, his motives are unknown, and his appearances are very few, but those that exist, do not end very well. Its symbol is a circle with a cross, which symbolizes the long-lived, the primordial and the mysterious.

Lavenderman: He wears a purple suit, with a light green shirt, and a top hat, as well as a monocle on the left side of his head. He carries a cup of coffee, which he does not use to drink, since he does not drink from it at any time. Lavenderman is very powerful, however, his power is the least of it, his behavior, like all variants of Slenderman, is unknown. However, he seems to be more cautious when attacking and likes to live in abandoned mansions. His symbol is a circle with an eye, which symbolizes observation, mystery, and elegance.

Murderman: He is a creepy Slenderman, in a dark red suit, who has a blood-like liquid in his body, but it is not actually blood, that liquid is an unknown component which is possible to classify because of how rare it is. In addition, it smells like paint, not metal. Murderman, moves erratically, making his bones or what look like bones grind, produces interference and damage capable of damaging electronic devices for seconds, and can cause dizziness and disorientation such that it can even erase memories if exposed to it too much, also moves on all fours sometimes. It does not appear often, but when it appears you must get away from it as quickly as possible. Its symbol is a circle with an arrow, which symbolizes danger, the inevitable and fear.

Twinman: with a gray suit, and two arms and two heads, Twinman is a strange Slenderman, resembling Siamese twins, hence his name Twinman. As they are two beings in one, their powers mixed, making him incredibly powerful, not so much, but enough to be feared. In addition, it is seen that he has two consciences by having two heads, even so his motives are unknown. He has gray tentacles, and two arms that give him great strength. His symbol is a circle with two stripes pointing down, which symbolizes opportunity, fear, and uncertainty.

X0010: He is a strange, anomalous and singular Slenderman. He has no head, no tentacles, not even hands or feet, his body is deformed to the point of looking like a four-legged spider, his skin is grayish with greenish tones, he appears in cities climbing buildings, he does not emit any sound only the screams of people scared when they see him. He does not teleport nor does he produce interference. He emits a smell similar to wet earth, he is gigantic, and he is unpredictable. X0010 is not an experiment, a mutation or something like that, it is something that happened, and it only happens once. He does not have a symbol, however his presence is enough to grant fear, uncertainty and mystery.

Slenderman (New generation): he is not Slenderman, however, he was born to be his successor, but he didn't succeed, for the moment. He wears a brown suit with a bow, and his tentacles are brown. He has powers similar to Slenderman's, being on the same level as him apparently, but the level of power is not important, but his motivations, which are unknown, and will never be known. Its symbol is a square, which symbolizes the new, the anomalous and the mysterious.

OrangeMan: He wears an orange suit with a top hat, which gives him a strange appearance when seen in the forest, like all the Slendermen. Although his motivations are also unknown, when he appears, some Slendermen run away, however, it is not because they are afraid of him, it is something else, nor is it because he is their leader or something like that, since the Slendermen do not obey anyone. OrangeMan is also very powerful, but they do not fear him for his power either. He stands like a statue, both in the forest and the cities, going unnoticed. Its symbol is a circle with a triangle, which symbolizes the unknown, panic and calm.

CyanMan: He's a touch more powerful than Slender Man, however he doesn't seem as interested in attacking as stalking his victims, although that doesn't take away from the fact that he's dangerous, since he's not good either. He wears a long light blue suit, along with pants with blueish and greenish tones, light blue tentacles that give him a mystical air, and he's very strange to see, but not impossible. His symbol is a circle with a square, which symbolizes the mystical, the strange, and the peculiar.

SnowderMan: is a Slenderman that only lives in snow biomes, being his natural habitat, possessing the ability to make people feel chills when he is near. He has a bluish coat along with pants with primitive tones, and uses bluish tentacles. He can camouflage himself with the environment and make a noise similar to the whisper of the wind during a storm, and induces uncertainty, dread and fear. His symbol is thrown sticks, which symbolize nothingness, however this nothingness means something, it is not something deep, but it means something.",2,1749601455.0,Slender_Man,0,1.0,False
1l8ex98,https://youtu.be/40Q68eMkOHY,3 Very Scary TRUE RV Park Vanishing Horror Stories,"# ""The Mission"":

I was 12 years old, living in a small RV park in Pocatello, Idaho, with my family in 1974. Our RV was cozy, parked among a dozen others, a tight-knit community where everyone knew each other. We’d moved there temporarily while my dad’s store was being renovated. The park felt safe, with kids playing in the open spaces and neighbors sharing dinners. Robert, a family friend, lived in an RV nearby with his wife and kids. He was charming, always telling stories about UFOs and adventures, making us laugh. My parents trusted him completely, and so did I.On October 17, after my piano lesson, Robert stopped by our RV. He was wearing his usual plaid shirt, his smile wide. “Hey, kiddo,” he said, leaning against the doorframe. “Want to go horseback riding? My son’s coming too. It’ll be fun.”I looked at my mom, who was washing dishes. “Can I go?” I asked, excited. I loved horses, and Robert’s trips were always a treat.Mom hesitated, wiping her hands on a towel. “It’s a school night,” she said, glancing at Robert.He chuckled. “I’ll have her back before dinner. Promise.”Mom sighed but nodded. “Okay, but be careful.”We climbed into Robert’s car, just the two of us. His son wasn’t there, which felt odd, but I didn’t question it. As we drove, he handed me a small white pill. “For your allergies,” he said, his voice calm. “It’ll help with the dust at the ranch.”I swallowed it with a sip of water from his thermos. I trusted him. He was like family. But soon, my head felt heavy, my vision blurry. The world spun, and everything went black.When I woke, I wasn’t at the ranch. I was lying on a narrow bed in a moving RV, the hum of the engine vibrating through the floor. My wrists were tied loosely with a soft cloth, not tight, but enough to scare me. I sat up, heart racing, and saw Robert at the wheel, his eyes fixed on the road. The RV smelled of stale coffee and gasoline, and the curtains were drawn tight, blocking the outside world.“Robert?” My voice trembled. “Where are we?”He glanced back, his face serious, not the warm smile I knew. “You’re awake,” he said. “Something incredible happened while you were out. Aliens contacted me. They’ve chosen us for a special mission.”My stomach dropped. “Aliens? What are you talking about?”“They’re real,” he said, his voice steady, like he was explaining homework. “They spoke to me through a device in my head. They said you and I are special, chosen to save the planet. We have to do something important.”I tugged at the cloth on my wrists, my mind racing. “What do we have to do?”He turned, his eyes locking onto mine, cold and intense. “We need to have a child together. It’s the only way to complete the mission. If we don’t, they said terrible things will happen—to your family, to everyone.”Tears stung my eyes. I was only 12. I didn’t understand what he meant, not fully, but his words made my skin crawl. “I don’t want to,” I whispered, my voice shaking.He softened, but it felt forced. “I know it’s scary, but I’ll take care of you. We’re in this together. You trust me, don’t you?”I nodded, not because I wanted to, but because I was trapped. The RV kept moving, the hum drowning out my thoughts. I looked around, noticing a small table with a radio buzzing softly, a stack of sci-fi magazines, and a map pinned to the wall with red marks circling places I didn’t recognize. Where was he taking me?Days blurred together. He drove us to Mexico, to a small town I’d never heard of. He untied my wrists but kept me close, always watching. One afternoon, he took me to a tiny chapel, its walls peeling with old paint. A man in a suit spoke in Spanish, and Robert handed him papers. “We’re getting married,” Robert said, his hand on my shoulder. “It’s part of the mission.”I stared at him, my heart pounding. “Married? But I’m just a kid.”“It’s what they want,” he said, his voice firm. “It’s to protect you, to protect everyone.”I felt sick, but I didn’t know how to fight him. He was the adult, the one my family trusted. The ceremony was quick, and I clutched my dress, a simple one he’d given me, feeling like I was in a dream I couldn’t wake from.Weeks later, the police found us. I don’t know how. One minute, we were in the RV, Robert telling me about the aliens again, and the next, sirens wailed outside. Officers burst in, shouting for Robert to step away. I was shaking, confused, as they led me to a car. “You’re safe now,” one officer said, a woman with kind eyes. “We’re taking you home.”Back at the RV park, my parents hugged me so tight I could barely breathe. “We were so worried,” my mom said, tears streaming down her face. “What happened?”I tried to explain. “Robert said aliens chose us. He said we had to save the world.”My dad frowned, glancing at my mom. “Aliens? Honey, that doesn’t make sense.”I didn’t know what to believe. Robert was arrested, but my parents, still under his spell, didn’t press charges fully. They thought he was just confused, not dangerous. He got a short sentence, and soon, he was back in our lives, acting like nothing happened. The park felt different, though. Neighbors whispered, and I felt eyes on me when I walked to the communal showers.Two years later, it happened again. I was 14, still in the RV park. Robert came by one evening, his smile back, but his eyes darker. “The aliens are upset,” he said, sitting across from me at our picnic table. “We didn’t finish the mission. We have to try again.”My heart sank. “I don’t believe you anymore,” I said, my voice small but firm.His smile faded. “You don’t have a choice. If you tell anyone, your family will suffer. The aliens told me.”I wanted to scream, to run, but fear kept me frozen. He took me to another RV, hidden in a different park hours away. The same stories, the same lies. But this time, I noticed things—how he stumbled over his words, how his “alien messages” sounded like lines from the sci-fi shows he loved. Doubt grew, but so did fear. What if he was telling the truth? What if I was wrong?The police found me again, weeks later, after my parents reported me missing. This time, I told them everything, even the parts that scared me to say. The FBI agent, a man with a notepad, listened carefully. “He manipulated you,” he said. “You’re not to blame.”Robert disappeared for a while, but the damage was done. The RV park, once my home, felt like a trap. We moved away soon after, but I carried the fear with me. It took years to understand what he’d done, how he’d used lies to control me. He wasn’t just a friend; he was a predator hiding in plain sight, using our trust against us.I still think about those days in the RV, the hum of the engine, the maps, the lies. I wonder how I believed him, how we all did. But I also know I survived. I found my strength, my voice, and I tell my story now so others might see the danger before it’s too late.

  


# ""The Vanishing at Sunizona RV Park"":

I was staying at an RV park in Sunizona, Arizona, in May 1993. My family and I had rolled into town a week earlier, our old camper parked on a gravel lot surrounded by scraggly desert shrubs and cacti. The park was small, maybe fifteen RVs total, with a few picnic tables and a dusty path leading to a little store at the entrance. That store was the heart of the place, selling snacks, sodas, and camping supplies. It had a single pay phone outside, its metal glinting under the store’s flickering light. The park felt remote, miles from anything, with Highway 191 cutting through the emptiness like a scar. It was quiet, but not the peaceful kind—more like the world was holding its breath. That silence turned heavy the day Dorothy and her daughter Danielle vanished.I’d gotten to know them a bit over the week. Dorothy was in her late forties, with short brown hair and a warm smile. She wore the same blue T-shirt and denim shorts every day, her flip-flops slapping the ground as she walked. Danielle, her teenage daughter, was lanky, with long blonde hair she kept tossing over her shoulder. She always had this heart-shaped silver pendant around her neck, a gift from her mom, she’d told me once. They were staying in a faded RV two spots down from us, and we’d chat sometimes while our kids played nearby.That morning, May 23rd, I was outside our camper, sipping coffee from a chipped mug, watching dust swirl across the lot. Dorothy and Danielle passed by, heading for the store. Danielle was already nibbling on an ice cream cone, the chocolate dripping onto her fingers. Dorothy caught my eye and waved.“Morning!” she called. “We’re grabbing cigarettes for my husband and some snacks. You need anything?”I shook my head, smiling. “I’m good, thanks. That ice cream looks like it’s winning, Danielle.”She laughed, holding up her sticky hand. “It’s a mess! Mom, you should’ve got one too.”Dorothy chuckled, nudging her. “I’m sticking to coffee. Come on, let’s get moving.”They kept walking, their voices fading as they reached the path to the store. I didn’t think twice about it. People were always in and out of that store, buying sodas or chatting by the pay phone. But hours passed, and they didn’t come back. By late afternoon, a knot started forming in my stomach. Dorothy’s husband, a quiet guy with a graying beard, came by our camper, his face pale.“Have you seen Dorothy or Danielle?” he asked, his voice tight. “They went to the store around noon. They’re not back.”I set my mug down, frowning. “I saw them this morning, heading that way. Maybe they stopped somewhere?”He shook his head, running a hand through his hair. “They didn’t take the truck. Just walked. It’s not like them to be gone this long.”My chest tightened. The store was a ten-minute walk, max. Beyond it, there was nothing but highway and desert—no houses, no gas stations, just miles of scrub and sand. We headed to the store together, hoping to find answers. The clerk, an older man with a gray beard and a faded baseball cap, was sweeping the floor. He looked up when we came in.“You seen Dorothy and her girl?” her husband asked, his voice urgent.The clerk leaned on his broom, thinking. “Yeah, they were here around 1 p.m. Bought a pack of cigarettes and two ice cream cones. Used the pay phone outside for a bit, then left, walking up 191. Seemed fine to me.”“Anything else?” I pressed. “Anyone with them? Anything odd?”He shrugged. “Didn’t see anyone else. It was quiet, like always.”That didn’t sit right. The park was small, and strangers stood out. If they’d walked off, someone would’ve noticed. Back outside, I scanned the highway, its black ribbon stretching into the distance. The pay phone stood alone, its light buzzing faintly. Something felt wrong, like the air was too thick, pressing against my skin.By evening, Dorothy’s husband called the Cochise County Sheriff’s Department. Deputies arrived, their radios crackling as they took statements. They brought search dogs, who sniffed around the store and picked up Dorothy and Danielle’s scents. The dogs led us along Highway 191, their handlers following, but after about a mile and a half, the trail stopped cold. No footprints, no dropped items, nothing. It was like they’d vanished into thin air.I couldn’t sleep that night. Our camper felt too small, the walls closing in. Every creak of the frame, every rustle outside, made my heart race. I kept picturing Dorothy’s smile, Danielle’s pendant catching the light. Where were they? I thought about a guy in the park, Carl, who’d been staying in a rusted RV at the far end. He was in his thirties, always alone, with a habit of staring too long at people. A few nights earlier, I’d heard his truck rumble to life around 2 a.m., tires crunching gravel as he drove off. It hadn’t meant anything then, but now it gnawed at me. Was he involved? Or was I just paranoid?The next morning, the search ramped up. Volunteers from town joined us, fanning out across the desert. I went along, my boots sinking into the sandy soil, thorns snagging my jeans. We shouted their names—Dorothy! Danielle!—our voices swallowed by the vastness. The desert felt endless, its flat expanse hiding secrets in every shadow. Around noon, I wandered near the highway, eyes scanning the dirt. That’s when I saw it: a glint half-buried by the roadside. I crouched down, heart pounding, and brushed away the sand. It was Danielle’s pendant, its silver heart scratched but unmistakable.“Hey!” I yelled, waving over a deputy. “I found something!”He jogged over, his face serious. “What is it?”I held it up, my hands trembling. “It’s Danielle’s. She wore it every day.”He took it, slipping it into an evidence bag. “You’re sure?”“Positive,” I said, my throat tight. “Her mom gave it to her.”The deputy radioed it in, but instead of relief, I felt dread. That pendant was proof something bad had happened. Why was it here, alone, without her? The highway seemed to mock us, its emptiness hiding the truth.That night, I sat outside our camper, staring at the store’s flickering light. The pay phone stood like a sentinel, and for a moment, I swore I saw a shadow move behind it. I blinked, and it was gone, but my skin prickled. I told myself it was nothing, just nerves, but the feeling of being watched wouldn’t leave. Later, in bed, I heard a sound—a faint whisper, like a voice too soft to understand. I froze, holding my breath, but it didn’t come again. Sleep never came either.Over the next few days, the search dragged on. We checked ditches, ravines, even abandoned sheds miles away. Nothing. The sheriff’s department said foul play was likely, but they didn’t name suspects. I couldn’t stop thinking about Carl. He’d packed up and left the day after the disappearance, his RV spot empty. I mentioned him to a deputy, who took notes but didn’t say much. Had Carl seen something? Or worse, done something? The thought made my stomach twist.One evening, I walked to the store to clear my head. The clerk was there, restocking shelves. “Any news?” he asked, his voice low.I shook my head. “Just that pendant. It’s like they’re gone without a trace.”He paused, setting down a can. “This place feels different now. People are scared. You hear things at night, you know? Sounds that don’t make sense.”I nodded, remembering that whisper. “Yeah. It’s creepy.”He leaned closer. “I saw that Carl guy a few times, late at night, walking by the highway. Never said a word. Then he’s just gone? Makes you wonder.”I left the store, my mind racing. The park wasn’t the same anymore. People kept to themselves, locking their doors. Dorothy’s husband stayed in his RV, barely eating, waiting for news that never came. The pendant was our only clue, but it raised more questions than answers.A week later, we were packing to leave. The clerk stopped by, his hands in his pockets. “You think they’re out there?” he asked, nodding toward the desert.“I don’t know,” I admitted. “I hope so, but…”He sighed. “It’s not right. People don’t just vanish.”But they did. Dorothy and Danielle were gone, and the park felt heavy with their absence. I kept seeing them in my mind—Dorothy’s wave, Danielle’s ice cream dripping. As we drove away, I looked back at the store, its light fading. That pendant haunted me, a tiny piece of a puzzle with no solution. Were they alive, somewhere far from here? Or was the desert keeping their secret, buried where no one would find it?

  


# ""The Shadows at Whispering Pines"":

I’ve always been drawn to RV parks. There’s a sense of freedom in parking your home on wheels, setting up camp, and joining a temporary community of strangers who feel like neighbors. Whispering Pines RV Park was like that at first—rows of RVs under tall trees, kids zooming by on bikes, the smell of campfires and grilled burgers in the air. People would wave as they walked their dogs or hauled water jugs to the spigot. But after a few weeks, that cozy feeling started to fade, replaced by something unsettling that I couldn’t quite pin down.It started with small things. I’d left my cooler outside my RV one night, filled with drinks and snacks for a barbecue. The next morning, it was gone. I searched around, thinking maybe kids had swiped it as a prank, but no one had seen it. Then there were the noises—soft footsteps crunching on gravel outside my RV after midnight. I’d flip on my porch light, peer out the window, but see nothing. Just the other RVs, their awnings swaying slightly, and the dark line of trees at the edge of the park. I told myself it was animals or my imagination, but deep down, I felt watched.Then I heard about the first vanishing. Tom was an older guy, maybe in his sixties, with a gray beard and a habit of sitting outside his RV every morning, sipping coffee from a chipped mug and reading a worn paperback. He’d nod at me when I passed, sometimes chatting about his travels across the country. One morning, his chair was empty. His RV was still there, curtains drawn, door locked. I asked around, and a camper named Lisa, who parked a few spots down, said, “He’s been gone two days. Nobody saw him leave.”I went to the park manager, Dave, in his cluttered office by the entrance. “What’s up with Tom?” I asked, leaning on the counter.Dave barely looked up from his paperwork. “Probably took off. People do that sometimes. Don’t pay their fees and just split.”“But his truck’s still here,” I said. “Keys are in it. I saw them through the window.”He shrugged, scratching his neck. “Maybe he’s hiking or visiting someone. He’ll turn up.”But Tom didn’t turn up. A week later, another camper vanished—a young woman named Emily. She was in her twenties, friendly, with a little terrier she walked every evening. I’d seen her the day before she disappeared, tossing a ball for her dog near the picnic area. That night, she didn’t come back from her walk. Her RV door was wide open, the dog’s leash gone, food left out on the counter like she’d been about to cook dinner. Her dog was found the next morning, wandering the park alone, leash trailing in the dirt.The mood in the park shifted. People stopped lingering outside at night. Conversations at the communal firepit turned tense, full of whispers about what might’ve happened. I overheard Lisa talking to another camper, a guy named Ben, while they filled water jugs at the spigot. “It’s not right,” Lisa said, her voice shaky. “I saw someone last night, standing by the trees near my RV. Just watching. I turned on my light, and they were gone.”Ben frowned, glancing toward the woods. “You sure it wasn’t just a shadow? Trees play tricks at night.”“No,” she snapped, gripping her jug tightly. “It was a person. Tall, thin. I’m telling you, something’s off here. I’m packing up tomorrow.”I didn’t want to believe her. People see things in the dark, get spooked. But the disappearances were real, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that Lisa wasn’t imagining things. That night, I dug out a cheap trail camera I used for wildlife shots on my travels. I mounted it on a pole outside my RV, angled toward the path leading to the woods. If something was out there, I’d catch it.The next morning, I pulled the camera’s memory card and loaded the footage on my laptop. My stomach dropped as I watched. At 2:17 a.m., a figure appeared—tall, lanky, moving slowly between the trees. The footage was grainy, the night vision casting a green glow, but it was definitely human. The figure paused, facing my RV, then slipped back into the woods. No face, no details, just a shape that didn’t belong.I took my laptop to Dave’s office. “You need to see this,” I said, playing the clip.He watched, leaning forward, then sat back with a sigh. “Could be a camper taking a late walk. Or a deer standing funny. These cameras aren’t great at night.”“That’s no deer,” I said, my voice tight. “And who walks in the woods at 2 a.m.? Something’s happening here, Dave.”He rubbed his face, looking tired. “Look, don’t go spreading this around. People are already jumpy. I’ll call the sheriff, have them do a patrol, but it’s probably nothing.”I left, frustrated, his dismissal gnawing at me. That night, I set up two more cameras—one facing the main path, another toward Lisa’s RV, since she’d seemed so scared. I stayed up, watching the live feed on my laptop, a baseball bat by my side. Around 11:45 p.m., the feed from Lisa’s RV flickered. The same figure appeared, moving with that same slow, deliberate gait. They stopped at her door, knocked softly, and waited. My heart raced as Lisa opened the door, her silhouette barely visible. They talked—too quiet for the camera’s mic to pick up—then she stepped outside, following the figure toward the woods.I didn’t think. I grabbed my phone, dialed 911, and whispered, “Someone’s luring a woman into the woods at Whispering Pines RV Park. I’m watching it on my camera. Send help now.” The operator told me to stay put, but I couldn’t just sit there. I snatched my flashlight and bat, slipped on my boots, and followed the path into the woods, my breath loud in my ears.The trail was narrow, branches scraping my arms as I moved. My flashlight beam bounced, catching glimpses of footprints in the dirt—two sets, one smaller, probably Lisa’s. After what felt like miles, I reached a clearing. An old shed stood in the center, its wood weathered, windows cracked. A faint light glowed inside, flickering like a lantern.I crept to the side, heart pounding, and peered through a grimy window. Lisa was inside, sitting on the floor, hands tied with rope. A man stood over her, muttering to himself, his back to me. He was tall, thin, his clothes filthy and torn. Then he turned, and I froze. It was Tom. Not gone, not vanished, but here, his gray beard matted, his eyes wild and unfocused. He held a hunting knife, its blade catching the lantern light.Lisa was crying softly. “Please,” she said. “Just let me go. I won’t tell anyone.”“You shouldn’t have followed,” Tom muttered, pacing. “This is my place. My home. You people keep coming, ruining it.”I gripped my bat, my mind racing. I banged on the door, shouting, “Tom! Let her go! The police are coming!”He spun toward the door, eyes wide. “You!” he snarled. “You don’t belong here. This is my sanctuary!”I pushed the door open, bat raised. “Lisa, get ready to run,” I said, keeping my eyes on Tom.He lunged, knife slashing toward me. I swung the bat, hitting his wrist. The knife clattered to the floor, and he howled, clutching his arm. Lisa scrambled up, fumbling with the ropes until they loosened. “Go!” I yelled. She stumbled out the door, disappearing into the dark.Tom came at me again, tackling me to the ground. We wrestled, his hands clawing at my face, his breath hot and sour. I kneed him hard, rolled him off, and pinned him down, my bat across his chest. “Stay down!” I shouted, my arms shaking from adrenaline.He kept muttering, “My place, my place,” like a broken record. I held him there, my knees digging into his ribs, until I heard sirens in the distance. Flashlights swept through the trees, and deputies burst into the shed, pulling Tom off the ground and cuffing him. Lisa was outside, wrapped in a blanket, sobbing as she told another officer what happened.The police searched the shed and found a stash of stolen items—my cooler, Emily’s backpack, a dozen other things from campers over the years. They told me Tom had a history of mental illness, diagnosed years ago. He’d stopped taking his meds, dropped out of society, and started living in the shed, convinced the RV park was his territory. He’d been watching us, stealing, and—when he felt threatened—luring people into the woods. They didn’t find Emily, but her backpack was a bad sign.The park shut down for a month after that. When it reopened, they installed security cameras, hired a night guard, and put up signs about staying on marked trails. I didn’t go back. I hitched up my RV and drove to a new park, far away, but I couldn’t shake what happened. I keep my cameras charged now, always watching the edges of wherever I park. I think about Tom, how he seemed so normal at first, just another camper with a story.

If you’re planning a move to Panama—or even just thinking about it—one of the best things you can do right now is **start learning Spanish**. Trust me, I’ve been down this road. And no, you don’t need to be fluent before you land. But having a basic grip on the language can make your life **a lot** easier.

# 🧭 Why Bother Learning Spanish?

Panama is a Spanish-speaking country. That’s just the reality. Yes, this should be a shocker **to no one.** 

Yes, you *can* ""get by"" with English in some places—especially in touristy or expat-heavy areas—but the minute you need to handle something important (doctor’s visit, banking, fixing your utilities), you’ll wish you knew Spanish.

But do you want to just ""*get by*""? What kind of life is that? Is that how you want to live right now?

Yes, there is Google Translate. But do you want to interact with *people*, or have your face in a phone? Do you want ""handlers"" and ""fixers"" to run your life, or accompany you to do anything of consequence in Panama, like you're a toddler being taken to enroll in Kindergarten?

But it’s more than just being practical. It’s also about **respect**. You’re not just visiting—you’re moving here. That means adapting to *their* world, not expecting them to adapt to yours.

Once again, for the folks in the back. **It. Is. About. RESPECT.** We are (or will be!) ***guests*** in someone else's nation. There by the kindness of their hearts. Do the bare minimum, and at least try to learn to speak to them, in the native tongue.

When you try to speak Spanish, even if it’s clumsy, locals notice. People are more patient. They open up. You’ll build real relationships—not just with other expats, but with the people who *live* here. It sets you apart from the run-of-the-mill *gringo*.

Bottom line: If Panama’s going to be your home, it’s worth learning the language of the home.

# 💡 Easy Tips for Learning Spanish Before You Go

**1. Do a little every day**  
15–30 minutes a day beats 3 hours once a week. You’ll remember more, and it’s less overwhelming.

**2. Speak early—even if it’s awkward**  
Don’t wait until you’re “ready.” Start talking, even if it’s just basic stuff. You’ll learn faster by messing up a bit.

**3. Learn stuff you’ll actually use**  
Skip words like “astronaut” or “poet.” Focus on things like ordering food, asking directions, talking to your neighbor.

**4. Listen all the time**  
Watch Spanish YouTube, listen to music or podcasts in Spanish. Even if you don’t understand everything, your brain will start picking it up.

**5. Be okay with making mistakes**  
You’re going to mess up. It’s part of learning. Laugh at it, learn from it, keep going.

Speaking Spanish lets you:  
✅ Get things done faster  
✅ Avoid frustration  
✅ Connect with locals  
✅ Truly feel at home

1l8euhq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leadership/comments/1l8euhq/i_was_socially_awkward_for_5_years_until_i/,I was socially awkward for 5 years until I actually applied Carnegie's book. These 6 techniques changed everything (Leadership advice I never expected to work),"Used to be the guy who'd avoid eye contact, give one-word answers, and somehow make every conversation die. Small talk felt like torture. Group settings made me want to hide in the bathroom.

I've read ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" probably 5 times but never actually did anything with it. Just highlighted passages and felt smart for 10 minutes. Finally decided to treat it like a playbook instead of philosophy and holy shit, people actually started liking me.

Here's what I learned when I stopped reading and started doing:

* Names are literally magic words. Started using people's names way more than felt natural. ""Thanks for the coffee, Sarah"" instead of just ""thanks."" ""Good point, Mike"" instead of ""good point."" Felt weird at first but people light up when they hear their own name. Their whole face changes. 
* Became genuinely curious about random stuff. Instead of pretending to care about someone's weekend hiking trip, I'd ask follow-up questions until I found something actually interesting. ""What's the hardest part about the trail?"" ""Do you see wildlife?"" ""How do you know which gear to bring?"" Turns out most topics are fascinating if you dig past surface level.
* Stopped trying to be the smartest person in the room. Used to jump in with corrections or try to one-up people's stories. Started asking ""How did you figure that out?"" or ""What made you think of that approach?"" instead. People love explaining their thought process and you actually learn stuff.
* Let people save face when they mess up. Coworker made a mistake in a meeting? Instead of pointing it out, I'd say ""Maybe we should double-check the numbers"" or ""I might be missing something here."" They fix the error without looking stupid. They remember who had their back.
* Actually listened instead of waiting for my turn to talk. Stopped preparing my response while someone else was speaking. Started paying attention to what they were actually saying. Asked questions about their answers. Conversations became way less exhausting because I wasn't constantly having to think what to say next.
* Found common ground with literally everyone. Started looking for shared experiences instead of differences. Turns out the a coworker and I both hate morning meetings. The quiet intern and I both love obscure podcasts. The annoying coworker and I both struggle with work-life balance. Connection beats competition every time.
* Became a hype man for other people's wins. When someone accomplished something, I'd make sure other people knew about it. ""Did you hear Sarah closed that big deal?"" ""Mike's presentation was incredible, did you see it?"" Takes zero effort but people remember who celebrates their success.
* Stopped arguing about stupid stuff. Used to debate everything like my life depended on being right. Now when someone says something I disagree with, I either let it go or say ""I never thought about it that way"" and actually consider their perspective. Relationships improved overnight.
* Started admitting when I was wrong. ""You're right, I messed that up"" became my new superpower. People expect defensiveness, so honesty catches them off guard. They usually respond with understanding instead of judgment.
* Asked for advice instead of giving it. Instead of telling people what they should do, I started asking ""What do you think would work best?"" or ""What's your gut telling you?"" People already know their answers most of the time, they just want someone to listen.
* Made people feel important. Started noticing specific things people did well. ""I really liked how you handled that difficult client"" or ""Your way of explaining complex stuff makes so much sense."" Genuine appreciation, not generic compliments.

People actually seek out my opinion now. Invitations to social stuff increased by like 300%. Family gatherings stopped feeling like interrogations. Also time with friends have been the best.

Being genuinely interested in others is way less work than trying to be interesting yourself. When you focus on making other people feel good, they associate those positive feelings with you.

Most social skills advice tells you to ""just be yourself."" But if ""yourself"" is socially awkward, that's terrible advice. Carnegie's book taught me that social skills are learnable skills, not personality traits you're born with.

Took me 5 years to figure out that people don't care how smart or funny or interesting you are. They care about how you make them feel. Once I started focusing on that, everything else fell into place.

He was absent a lot when she was growing up but she still has good memories, probably just not as many as she’d like.

He has a problem with our relationship, and we have been very up and down, on and off. But now we’re as solid as we ever have been. And he’s given her the cold shoulder. Even messaging her to say ‘you’ve abandoned me for your new man’. Which is a bit weird. She also feels aggrieved that he only really gets in touch with her when his wife is away. So they’re both feeling the same thing I guess. Which does seem weird.

So he contacted her the other day to ask to see her. She agreed, she’s never not agreed. She hasn’t actually done anything different to normal. He just knows I’m around and so has cut down his contact with her.

When he asked to see her, she said it filled her with dread. She didn’t know what he was up to. She said he’s very hard to say no to. Her brother came round and they mentioned him and were very negative about him - she called him a narcissist no less.

So we had a chat about it. And she downplayed it. She said it might just be a coffee and a relaxed chat.

So it’s ok for her to be filled with dread, but if I feel anxious that my relationship and family could be ‘attacked’ by this bloke who she can’t say no to and who doesn’t like us being together, then I’m the problem.

And then the time comes. It’s the night before she’s seeing him. She spots that I’m anxious and she tells me to spit it out. I tell her I feel less than comfortable that she’s going to be sat with someone who potentially wants to break us up, might suggest things to break us up (he’s threatened to remove her from his payroll if she was with me previously - she has a new job now). She says we talked about it the other day, it’s pissing her off that I would bring it up to discuss it for 8 hours again (it was actually 30 mins, but don’t worry about the details lol).

And now we’ve fallen out. Because she can be filled with dread and slag him off royally. But if I’m concerned and wary of what he’s up to, then I’m the beast.

I'm looking for two people to share my 3-bedroom, 1-bathroom apartment in PLG, a 5-minute walk from the 2/5 station, and a 10-minute walk from Prospect Park.

I will be staying in the space. I have lived in the apartment for over 4 years, and the original leaseholder had been there for over 10 years. We love this apartment! It has a lot of natural sunlight, a spacious living room, and a nice back porch and backyard.

We share a back porch with our neighbors, who live in the building next to us. The yard is fenced in, making it great for gardening, movie nights with our projector set up, and cozy spaces for relaxing in the fresh air. My former roommate and I use the back porch and backyard fairly often.

**ABOUT THE ROOMS:**

The rental breakdown is $1750 for the big bedroom and $1050 for the smaller. I pay $1250 for the medium-sized room which I will be staying in (my bedroom is not in the pics).

The big bedroom is spacious with two floor-to-ceiling closets, two windows, and lots of floor space. It comes unfurnished, but some items are optional to keep if you'd like.

The smaller bedroom comes furnished or unfurnished. Furnished will include the desk, the desk chair, bed with mattress, and the bookshelf. Any unwanted items can be removed.

**ABOUT THE AREA:**

We have a coffee shop directly across the street, a Wholesome Gourmet Market for snacks and other items just 200 feet from our doorstep, a laundromat, grocery store, and a local hardware store, all within a block. Good food delivery. We're right by the 2/5 and an easy walk to the Q, B, and Prospect Park.

We've all had an easy flow living together, and our neighbors are great. Tell me a little about yourself; I hope you'll be the right fit to check out the space!

**ABOUT ME:**

I am a 30-something LGBTQ+ woman, a graphic designer who works at a garden during the day, and am a student at a design school.

When I'm home, I'm often doing homework, freelance graphic design work, or chilling out watching a movie or TV show (Taskmaster is my current comfort watch).

I'm sociable, tidy, and a people-person, but I know when to keep to myself. I leave the apartment for all of my socializing, but I enjoy having guests and people in the house.

I've lived in BK for a little over 4 years.

**RENTAL REQUIREMENTS:**

First month's rent of $1750 and a deposit of $1750, co-signing the lease with me. July 1st move in 12-month lease.

As much as I loved the pros of being a barista, nothing can overcome the hate I have for the cons of the job itself. Being scheduled to be understaffed, ridiculous BOGO deals, unrealistic expectations, new beverage sequences that contradict with drive times, and so much more that many partners like you already know. I’ve had my fun but I’m glad my time there is done. I can look forward and focus on literally anything else. Peace ✌️",8,1749600300.0,starbucksbaristas,0,1.0,False

Once, while teaching my Italian class, I asked my students to describe how they felt about the lesson using the verb _""sembrare""_. There was a moment of silence, then one brave soul piped up, ""Professoressa, _sembra_ che stiamo imparando!"" Everyone laughed, and I knew they got it.

_""Sembrare""_ is a fascinating word in Italian. It means **""to seem""**, and it's a regular verb, so it's a breeze to conjugate. Here's a quick rundown:

- _Io sembro_ (I seem)
- _Tu sembri_ (You seem)
- _Lui/lei sembra_ (He/She seems)
- _Noi sembriamo_ (We seem)
- _Voi sembrate_ (You all seem)
- _Loro sembrano_ (They seem)

One time, a student said, ""_Sembri stanco, prof!_"" (You seem tired, teacher!) and I couldn't help but chuckle. They were right—I needed a coffee!

_""Sembrare""_ is also an **intransitive verb**, which means it sometimes needs an indirect object. Think of it like a key needing a lock to open a door. For example, _""Mi sembra che il caffè sia troppo forte.""_ (It seems to me that the coffee is too strong.)

Have you ever used _""sembrare""_ in a quirky or funny way? Share your stories! Let's see who can come up with the most creative sentence using this versatile verb.

This one feels different.  I'm still not sure I'm all wired for 2025 dating ha ha, and she's just jumping back in after a long time as well.  After we met for coffee, I asked if she wanted to go out this weekend and she does. In a later text I asked what food she doesn't like: real Mexican food and fake Italian (she's Italian).  Neither of us drink. She's bright, funny, has integrity, is a great mom, loves her family, owns her own business, is super easy to talk to, and we share a faith. She likes trivia/game shows and movies/comedies (but I don't want to just sit in a movie theatre at this stage - I want to get to know her better.) She likes to laugh and so far, I can make her do that ha ha. 

Here's my plan: Her side of town, meet at a mid-grade chain steak and seafood... not a Ruth Criss but tasty and you don't have to dress nice...  We'll enjoy dinner, then I'll offer to drive to Dave and Busters to allow for activity and conversation. (we're in a hot climate so indoor is vital). Then, in the evening, a little stroll in adjacent outdoor mall to her choice of either ice cream or froyo together and then back to her car... 

What do you think? Am I overthinking it? And - do I outline what we're doing before hand or just meet at the restaurant and reveal step by step and just let her know ahead of time to dress casual comfortable? The last 2nd date we had kind of discussed before hand so it was different.

1l8efst,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l8efst,Four Seasons Boston with kids: a unicorn of a hotel,"Recently spent a nearly perfect long weekend at the FS Boston on Boylston (this distinction is important because the city boasts two Four Seasons) with my kids and mom - a multigenerational trip. 

Multigenerational trips aren't easy to get right, but this hotel really managed to hit it out of the park. I booked with [u/alex\_travels](https://www.reddit.com/user/alex_travels/) and as per usual, she anticipated things that would make our trip as seamless and magical as possible.

**Service: scale of 1-10**

 9.5

This would have been a perfect 10 if not for the fact that the room was not serviced for turndown till 8 pm the first night, and my daughter was already asleep. Furthermore, we had called to have the room service table taken away when we left the hotel at 4 pm and it still wasn't when we returned at 7. However, a quick call downstairs the next morning ensured the following nights had turndown earlier, and it wasn't a big deal at ALL.

Apart from that very small experience, the service at this hotel was NEXT LEVEL for people traveling with kids. They love kids here. Like...almost Disney-level love kids but with actual luxury hotel rooms and great food. Want to have a hot cocoa run downstairs in your pajamas? Get smiles all along the way. Returning from a hot walk in the Boston Common? Complimentary strawberry lemonade and cookies at the concierge, natch. Doing the hotel scavenger hunt? Every person you see along the way will get the biggest kick out of watching your kids' trials and tribulations over finding each clue and then winning the most adorable chocolate lollipop at the end. Mini bathrobes and slippers, of course. Nightlights and sound machines. A room service menu with every possible kid friendly item made with high quality ingredients. I've really never had service THIS child-centered at a luxury city hotel. Need more proof? Look at the magical TOY ROOM where kids get to choose a toy when they first arrive. 

They like adults, too! The room service was always prompt, we were proactivley offered the house car multiple times to get to dinner and museums (afternoons only) and the complimentary coffee hour makes a damn good iced latte and delivers it upstairs if you so desire. Our rooms were ready at noon when we arrived and the staff helped us extend our reservation one day without any issues. The staff was warm, informative, extremely efficient, and honestly so kind. 

Property/rooms: scale of 1-10

10

No notes. The rooms were beautifully appointed with luxury Frederic Malle toiletries, excellent air conditioning, and bath towels that are large enough to cover an entire human body (tiny scratchy towels are a major pet peeve). 

The rooms have plenty of outlets, are really thoughtfully laid out, and 4 people could easily share this room for a few days quite comfortably. The blackout curtains really DID black out the room, and the pocket doors between bedroom and living room made it really really comfortable setup. We also had the suites connecting, which made the space flow even better. As always, FS linens and beds were wonderfully comfortable. 

Alex set us up with an insane welcome amenity of prosecco, chips, treats...the whole shebang. It really got the vacay vibes going right away!

Our one bedroom suites had stunning views of the Boston Common, which was right outside our door. We easily walked to many restaurants and sights, and it was easy to get an uber or use the house car when we needed to go further afoot. The location is PRIME and could not be improved upon for our activities (a little culture, a lot of playgrounds, mostly food).

The pool area was awesome with noodles, kickboards, and swan floaties. We went twice and were the only people there for a couple hours both days, which was great.  
We also used the sanctuary, a beautiful garden space on the 6th floor, to have snacks and drinks. 

Though the hotel was clearly bustling, we felt like the most important guests at all times, which we clearly weren't. But wow, what a luxurious feeling. 

Food: scale of 1-10

8

I'm a major food lover, so 8 is a really good score (if not perfect) in my book. Everythign we ordered from room service was exactly as good as expected, it was just that nothing ""wowed"" me. Part of that is likely because the menu is not huge, but everything they do, they do extremely well. That said, the turkey club sandwich really hits the spot. 

But, like,...if you're a little peckish between meals...just head to the vault. 

Each floor has this keycard-accessible room with water, chips, candy, etc...my kids thought it was the greatest thing since Willy Wonka's candy factory. 

  
Not gonna lie, I did, too. 

  
This hotel hit all the points. Luxurious, well located, excellent service, and really makes kids not feel just welcome, but VIP. I would stay here again  (and book with Alex, FYI) in a heartbeat. 

PS - my fave meal was at Saltie Girl, the tea party museum was AWESEOME, and the playground near fanueil hall was \*chef's kiss\*

1l8eddw,https://i.redd.it/cksie3ant66f1.png,Would you switch to these earbuds?,"Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro Review: Best Wireless Earbuds for Android in 2025?

So I’ve been using the new Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro for a little over a week now, and here’s my honest take — the hype is (mostly) real. If you're on the fence, this might help you decide.

First Impressions

Out of the box, they feel premium — lighter than expected but still solid. The design is slick, the case has that nice matte finish, and pairing was instant with my Galaxy S24 Ultra (shoutout to Samsung ecosystem magic).

Pros (What I loved)

1. Sound quality = major upgrade

The adaptive EQ is no gimmick — it legit adjusts to your environment and listening habits. Bass hits hard when it needs to, but vocals still shine. I’m no audiophile, but compared to the Buds 2 Pro, this is a noticeable jump.

2. 360° audio is immersive AF

I tested this with a few Dolby Atmos tracks and... wow. It’s not just a party trick — spatial audio actually adds depth, especially when watching movies on the go.

3. Call quality finally doesn’t suck

The AI-enhanced mics are doing something right. I’ve taken calls in a breezy park and walking near traffic — no one asked me to repeat myself. That's rare.

4. Battery life is solid

I’m getting about 7 hours on a single charge, which is accurate, and around 30 hours with the case. No complaints here — haven’t had to worry about juice mid-day.

Cons (Things that bug me)

1. Still not quite AirPods Pro for ANC

Don’t get me wrong — the noise canceling is good. But in a crowded coffee shop, some voices and clatter still sneak in. It's improved, but not class-leading.

2. Touch controls are hit or miss

They’re customizable, but I’ve had a few ghost touches or missed swipes. It’s better than previous models but still not perfect.

3. Pricey if you’re not a Samsung user

At \~$185 (I got it on a sale), it’s a great deal if you’re in the Samsung ecosystem. Otherwise, you might not get the full benefit — things like auto-switching and Samsung-exclusive features don’t work as well on non-Galaxy devices.

 What do I think?

These are easily Samsung’s best earbuds to date. If you're already rocking a Galaxy device, it’s a no-brainer — you’ll get excellent sound, cool spatial audio, and finally good call quality in one slick package.

If you’re on iOS or another Android brand, maybe weigh your options — but still worth checking out, especially if you catch them on sale.

My plan was to hand him a piece of paper with both my number + a little msg asking if they’d like to get coffee or whatever (as friends).

The reason why I’m asking on this sub is because I’m worried that might be a weird thing to do *here.* Is it? Because I just moved back to the south after living on the west coast for a decade, and I think living there messed with my perception of what’s normal.

His company decided it was better “for the culture” aka “they are f-ed on the real estate they aren’t using” to force everyone back to the office. I don’t love Indiana but my family is here and we just built our house 2.5 years ago. Not to mention I just had twins. It is not the season for us to make a move like this…I hate it for so many reasons. We’ve tried every avenue to avoid this but the job market being what it is, we have to move.

Now that my soapbox moment is over. I need help finding a community. We will know zero people and have no experience with the area. We have three small children (4 year old daughter and 4 month old twins). Because of this, my husband’s commute needs to be 30 minutes max in traffic. He’s in tech and will be working near the Domain. The neighborhood is more important to me than the house to an extent. Though we will need 4 bedrooms/2 baths, a den, extra play space and our max budget is 550ish because of the stupid interest rates right now. (We could do more if we can get a lower rate). Our needs/wants in the neighborhood we end up in: friendly, outgoing people, block parties, festivals, bbqs, walkable to coffee shops or restaurants would be ideal. I personally want more open minded people. Access to good schools/childcare options is also very important to us. (Talk to me about preschools).

From my limited remote searching, the areas around Round Rock, Pflugerville, Rattan Creek and Wells Branch seem appealing. Any tips, suggestions or feedback is welcomed! Thank you!!

#### The Digital Nomad Dream: Spain’s Siren Call

Sun-drenched plazas. Tapas at midnight. Wi-Fi humming in ancient cafés. Spain isn’t just a country—it’s a gravitational force for the world’s untethered. But behind the sangria-soaked sunsets, there’s a shadow: the Spanish taxman, lurking, clipboard in hand.

#### Why Spain? The Magnetic Pull for Nomads

**Sun, Sea, and… Tax Surprises?**

Spain seduces with its Mediterranean rhythm. But the real surprise isn’t the siesta. It’s the tax bill that follows you like a persistent stray cat.

**Spain’s Digital Nomad Visa: The Shiny New Lure**

Spain’s digital nomad visa is the latest bait. Promises of legal residency, community, and sun. But read the fine print. With the visa comes a new relationship—with Spanish bureaucracy.

#### The Big Question: Do Digital Nomads Pay Tax in Spain?

**Tax Residency Demystified**

Here’s the deal: Spain taxes residents on worldwide income. Non-residents? Only Spanish-sourced cash. The line between the two? Blurry as a Barcelona night.

**183-Day Rule: The Invisible Line**

Spend 183 days in Spain in a year? Congratulations, you’re a resident. Even if you’re “just passing through.” The calendar doesn’t care about your intentions.

#### The Spanish Tax System: A Crash Course

**Personal Income Tax (IRPF): The Beast Explained**

IRPF isn’t just a tax. It’s a labyrinth. Progressive rates, regional quirks, deductions that vanish when you need them most.

**Non-Resident Income Tax: The Sneaky Sibling**

Non-residents pay a flat rate. Sounds simple—until you realize what counts as “Spanish income.” Hint: It’s broader than you think.

#### Tax Residency Traps for Nomads

**Accidental Residency: How Easy It Is to Slip**

Didn’t mean to become a tax resident? Too bad. Spain counts days, not intentions. Missed flights, extended Airbnbs—suddenly, you’re on the hook.

**Center of Economic Interests: The Subtle Net**

Even if you dodge the 183 days, Spain can still claim you if your “center of economic interests” is here. Clients, contracts, family—watch out.

#### The Digital Nomad Visa: Blessing or Burden?

**Visa Requirements and Tax Implications**

The visa opens doors. But it also opens your wallet. Most digital nomad visas require you to pay local taxes. No loopholes. No mercy.

**Remote Work and Spanish Taxman: Frenemies**

Working for a foreign company? Spain still wants its cut. Remote doesn’t mean invisible.

#### Double Taxation Agreements: Your Lifeline or Illusion?

**How DTAs Work (Or Don’t)**

Double Taxation Agreements sound like a shield. Sometimes, they are. Sometimes, they’re a sieve. The devil is in the details—and the paperwork.

**Common DTA Pitfalls for Nomads**

Miss a form, misread a clause, and you’re double-taxed. Or worse: neither country claims you, and both come knocking.

#### The Freelancer Dilemma: Autónomo or Not?

**Registering as Self-Employed in Spain**

Want to go legit? Register as an autónomo. But brace for paperwork avalanches and monthly social security bills that bite.

**Social Security: The Hidden Cost**

Spain’s social security isn’t optional. Miss a payment, and the fines pile up. Fast.

#### Corporate Structures: The Offshore Temptation

**Setting Up a Foreign Entity: Risk and Reward**

Some nomads set up shop offshore. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it triggers alarms with Spanish authorities.

**Controlled Foreign Company Rules: The Watchdogs**

Spain’s CFC rules are designed to sniff out offshore games. Play smart, or play with fire.

#### Crypto, Remote Income, and the Spanish Radar

**Crypto Taxation: The Unseen Trapdoor**

Crypto is taxed. Hard. Hide it, and you’re toast. Spain’s tax agency is watching wallets like a hawk.

**Worldwide Income: No Place to Hide**

If you’re a resident, everything counts. Every euro, every bitcoin, every freelance gig.

#### Common Myths: “I’m Safe If Paid Abroad”

**Payment Origin vs. Tax Residency**

Where your client is doesn’t matter. Where you are does. The money’s path is irrelevant if you’re sipping coffee in Madrid.

**Banking Abroad: Not a Cloak of Invisibility**

Foreign bank account? Spain can still see you. Information sharing is real. Privacy is a myth.

#### Penalties and Audits: The Spanish Inquisition

**What Happens If You Get Caught?**

Penalties are brutal. Back taxes. Fines. Maybe even criminal charges. Spain doesn’t play.

**How Spain Tracks Digital Nomads**

Data sharing. Airbnb records. Social media. Spain’s tax agency is more digital than you think.

**Tax Optimization: Smart, Not Shady**

There are legal ways to optimize. But they require strategy, not shortcuts.

#### Real Stories: Nomads Who Got Burned (and Those Who Didn’t)

#### The Future: Will Spain Get Tougher?

**EU Pressure and Global Trends**

The EU wants tax harmonization. Spain is tightening the net. The golden days of tax-free wandering are fading.

**Digital Nomad Advocacy: Can Change Happen?**

Nomads are pushing back. Lobbying for fairer rules. The fight isn’t over.

#### Protecting Yourself: Proactive Steps

**Keeping Records Like a Hawk**

Documentation is your shield. Every invoice, every contract, every Airbnb receipt.

#### The Anti-Establishment Playbook: Outsmart, Don’t Outrun

**Community Wisdom: Nomads Helping Nomads**

Share knowledge. Swap stories. The system isn’t on your side—but your community is.

**The Power of Transparency**

Honesty isn’t just noble—it’s strategic. Transparency can save you from disaster.

#### Spain vs. Other Nomad Hotspots: A Brutal Comparison

**Portugal, Estonia, and Beyond**

Some countries roll out the red carpet. Others roll out the red tape. Spain is somewhere in between.

**Is Spain Worth the Hassle?**

The lifestyle is gold. The tax system? Less so. Weigh your options.

#### The Bottom Line: Should You Worry?

**The Calculated Risk of Nomad Life**

Every paradise has a price. In Spain, it’s often paid in taxes.

**Peace of Mind vs. Paperwork**

You can have both. But only if you play smart.

#### Your Next Move: Take Control of Your Nomadic Destiny

Don’t let the system dictate your journey. Knowledge is your passport. Strategy is your shield. The Spanish sun is still shining. Just don’t get burned.",1,1749599371.0,NomadicLifestyleGlobe,0,1.0,False

I did a week long course of clarithromycin, amoxicillin and nexium. I then waited four weeks and tested negative through a breath test 120days ago. I was not out of the woods though, I was still in a lot of pain and feeling just as bad. I picked up the gastritis diet after doing my reading and I cut out all spicy, fatty and acidic foods. I added more colour to my diet and switched coffee for green tea. I also decided to take slippery elm supplements before meals to help lubricate my damaged stomach lining. I’ve learnt so much in the last six months and not only did my determination heal my stomach but I also healed the iron and b12 deficiency I have had for the last 10+ years. During this time I also did a lot of reading into ppis after treatment. I did try to get back on ppis for a couple of weeks there after treatment because I was experiencing that cool burn in my throat and burning gut pain, however it did not help and  actually made things worse, I ended up coming off them. Something drs don’t tell you is that a lot of people often experience low stomach acid after having HPylori and low stomach acid actually has very similar symptoms to high stomach acid. A few months after treatment I did end up retesting through a stool sample just for my own peace of mind to make sure I was still negative and I was in fact negative. 
Anyway my point of making this post is to give hope to the people who may just be starting treatment, or maybe your just finished treatment and your still feeling terrible. It gets better, you just have to be strong and hang in there. It’s been a good six months for me and I’m feeling great! ",4,1749599198.0,HPylori,1,1.0,False

Picture me, a 42 year old Muslim dude, drowning in heartbreak because I’m in love with my cousin. Yeah, that kind of cousin love. It’s halal in our family, totally normal, mom’s already picking out wedding sweets, but the girl? She’s out here calling me “bhai” like we’re in some twisted sibling sitcom. I’m serious about this, but also, like, laugh at my pain, because it’s pathetic.

It started at a family iftar three Ramadans ago. We’re all crammed at Aunty’s, plates piled with biryani, and there’s Amina. She’s always been the star cousin: quick wit, eyes that could launch a thousand nikahs, and a laugh that hits harder than qawwali at 3 a.m. I’m just the guy who trips over his own shalwar, but that night, she giggled at my dumb joke about fasting brain fog. My heart did a backflip. Suddenly, I’m noticing her hijab game, her savage comebacks, the way she sneaks extra samosas. I was gone, man. Done for. 

Our families? They’ve been shipping us since we were kids. “Such a good match,” they’d whisper, like it’s fate. But Amina? She’s not reading the script.

I thought I’d be smooth. Started small, sending her WhatsApp messages about “finding your soulmate” (cringe, I know). She’d reply with a thumbs-up or, worse, “Lol, bhai.” That word—bhai—it’s a dagger. I told her, “Stop calling me that, I’m not your brother!” She just grinned, said, “Okay, bhai-jaan,” and I wanted to yeet myself into the next dimension. I tried harder. Wrote her an Urdu poem, spent hours making “dil” rhyme with “safar ka qabil.” Sent it. She responded with a crying-laughing emoji and, “Cute, bhai.” I bought her favorite pistachio baklava, thinking food is the way to the heart. She ate it, hugged me, and said, “You’re the best brother.” I’m not your brother, Amina, I’m trying to be your husband.

Desperate, I asked her to coffee. Just us, no family WhatsApp group blowing up. Wore my cleanest kurta, and practiced my speech like I was auditioning for a drama. At the cafe, I laid it all out: “Amina, I love you. Families are down, let’s make this marriage happen.” She sipped her coffee, looked at me like I’d grown a second head, and said, “Bro, you’re like my sibling. Also, I’m moving to Canada for uni. Good talk.” 

Bro. I died right there, soul leaving my body like it had a flight to catch. She’s in Canada now, living her best life, while I’m here, eating kheer and scrolling her Insta like a loser. She still tags me in “sibling appreciation” posts. I’m in the trenches.

The worst part? I’m still hung up on her. My brain knows she’s never gonna see me as more than “bhai,” but my heart’s out here reciting love nasheeds. Families keep asking, “When’s the nikah?” and I just mumble about “timing” while choking on my own vibes. I’ve thought about sending her a sad Urdu playlist or showing up in Canada with a sign saying, “Not Your Bhai,” but even I know that’s unhinged. I’m stuck, stuck between love and a cousin who thinks I’m her brother from another mother.

TL;DR: In love with my cousin (halal, families approve), but she calls me “bhai” and thinks I’m her brother. Tried poems, baklava, and a coffee date confession—still bro-zoned. She’s in Canada, I’m in pain.",0,1749599055.0,confessions,8,0.33,False

1l8e1op,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l8e1op,"[🎉 I SHIPPED] I didn’t know what an API was 8 days ago. Now I’ve got a working iOS app with StoreKit, AdMob, and 40 custom PHP APIs I wrote with GPT.","Hey folks,

8 days ago I didn’t know what an API was. Or how a database worked. Or how Swift syntax looked.

Now I just shipped Tani — a social guessing game app that’s actually live on the App Store. And I built it 100% solo.
No dev background. No co-founder. Just me, hosting, and GPT.

🤔 What’s Tani?

It’s super simple:
Every day you get a personal question like “What snack do you secretly love?” or “Who do you call when you’re stressed?”
You answer it.
Your friends try to guess.
You see who knows you best — and who has no idea who you are 😅

It’s part game, part conversation starter. A low-pressure way to reconnect with friends or partners.

🛠️ How I built it (aka pain + coffee)
	•	I bought basic hosting, opened up phpMyAdmin and created the DB manually.
	•	Then I created 40+ PHP API files one by one inside cPanel.
	•	I didn’t write a single line of code on my own. I just used Cursor + GPT and asked:
“Write a PHP file that inserts this data into this table”,
“Make this endpoint update the score”,
etc.
	•	App itself? Built in Xcode. I had no Swift experience. Still don’t, tbh.
	•	I integrated StoreKit for in-app subscriptions (weekly premium).
	•	And added AdMob to show rewarded ads for some extra features.

Basically, I made an entire functioning app by brute forcing logic + AI.

💬 Why I’m sharing this:
	•	I wanna know how you’d improve something like Tani.
	•	Would you go full free + ads? Subscriptions only? Cosmetic rewards?
	•	Any features you think would make the app stickier or more fun?

Also: If you’ve always wanted to ship something but felt like “I don’t know how to code” was stopping you — this is your sign. You can 100% make a real thing. It’ll be messy, but it’ll work.

I’m happy to drop the App Store link or share screens if anyone’s curious. Appreciate any feedback 🙌

PS: I broke cPanel 3 times, crashed my database once, and thought Xcode was gaslighting me at least twice. Still worth it.

I feel like the title is so accurate 😅, I'm just a regular person looking for another to share our mundane lives together with. I'm looking for the kind of love where we have fun grocery shopping together, and make every night feel like date night.

[Here's a few recent photos of me.](https://imgur.com/a/FV8FVMO) They give you a good sampler of my interests lol. In addition to concerts/music and racing, I love going for walks to stay active, driving, card games, and I've been back into daytrading for the last two-ish years now. I have a cool full time job, and I don't drink or smoke. I think I'm a good noodle overall, hopefully you are too! Physically I'm 6'1 with blue eyes, no tattoos,...you've seen the photos. 😅

I'm here looking for my person to spend forever with. I dream of being together, maybe with a few kids too. I dunno, the thought of coming home from work and cooking dinner together and watching something before bed just sounds perfect to me. If that's something you want as well, you should reach out :)

Additionally I'm kind of a clingy partner and love to chat often! Sweet good morning/night messages melt my heart, and sharing little things through your day will keep me forever.

Some random facts about me:

* I load almost everything I eat with black pepper
* I'll always make a funny face or at least smile when going through an EZ Pass toll booth
* Left handed and born two months premature (my literal due date was April 1st and I feel like that says a lot lol)
* 😅 is my favorite emoji
* I can't really have caffeine anymore so I'm not a coffee drinker, and I don't have soda a lot - but birch beer is my WEAKNESS
* And I have to edge the microwave and stop it with a second to go

Please message me with your name, age and where-ish you are. Hopefully you have some time, because I'd love to connect. Also - this is a dating post, so please plan on sending a few photos of yourself early on.

I live in Eastern PA - so if you're nearby, cool! If not that's cool too, but please be in either the US or Canada just for time zones.

I'll also admit I'm feeling semi burned out from dating and going through the process. I've deleted all my dating apps, so you're my only hope for now. I have a lot of love and attention to give - if you show me yours too, I think we'll both be happy in the end!

Talk soon! Or if not, enjoy the rest of your night

We were going to go away for a week to a place that's about 2 hours drive from us and I managed to get a phenomenal deal on a hotel right in the centre of the city. I've been planning this trip and looking forward to it for months. 

I had scouted out all the independent roasters/coffee shops because I wanted to visit to try their beans. I had the hikes we were going to do picked out and was looking forward to seeing the waterfalls that several of them have. I picked this place because of finances (it was very reasonable and a week away would have run us ~$1500 with the hotel included) but also because the place is beautiful. We had budgeted and saved since last year in order to take this trip. 

Right now I'm writing this in tears because we're going to have to cancel this trip due to the fact that we simply cannot afford it. We had $3000 in surprise expenses last month (I needed a very expensive dental surgery) plus $1400 for my husband's car insurance. This month our landlord sent us 6 months of utility bills which total $1375. We need a new bed which is $1200-$1500. My car insurance comes up in August and will be about $2000 (no idea why mine is so much higher considering both of us have clean records and my car is from 2013 whereas my husband's is from 2007. He has 2 years seniority on me but we're both in our 30s). Then I need another dental procedure in September/October which will cost $2500. 

These are all on top of things like rent, groceries, cat-related expenses, and other bills. I was looking forward to this week away for months and I'm absolutely shattered that I had to cancel the hotel.

On the other hand I feel silly that I am so upset over this considering so many people never go on vacations either. I just need to vent because the one thing I was looking forward to this summer has been taken away.  ",18,1749598371.0,povertyfinance,5,0.91,False

What I am doing: I am using a one cup primula moka pot I got from Amazon and cafe bustelo espresso ground coffee. I used boiling water and just hot water on the lower chamber to below the valve. I fill the basket to the top and I don’t tamp it down. I think my issue come with the gas burner I use. It doesn’t have multiple sizes and the burner itself is the size of the bottom of the moka pot and the grate is too big so it sit on the on the actual burner. I leave it on the lowest heat setting the second brew I did and middle to low on the first and I take it off the second it started to sputter. The second brew was really little and didn’t use all the water in the lower chamber. ",2,1749598345.0,mokapot,0,1.0,False

I feel like the title is so accurate 😅, I'm just a regular person looking for another to share our mundane lives together with. I'm looking for the kind of love where we have fun grocery shopping together, and make every night feel like date night.

[Here's a few recent photos of me.](https://imgur.com/a/FV8FVMO) They give you a good sampler of my interests lol. In addition to concerts/music and racing, I love going for walks to stay active, driving, card games, and I've been back into daytrading for the last two-ish years now. I have a cool full time job, and I don't drink or smoke. I think I'm a good noodle overall, hopefully you are too! Physically I'm 6'1 with blue eyes, no tattoos,...you've seen the photos. 😅

I'm here looking for my person to spend forever with. I dream of being together, maybe with a few kids too. I dunno, the thought of coming home from work and cooking dinner together and watching something before bed just sounds perfect to me. If that's something you want as well, you should reach out :)

Additionally I'm kind of a clingy partner and love to chat often! Sweet good morning/night messages melt my heart, and sharing little things through your day will keep me forever.

Some random facts about me:

* I load almost everything I eat with black pepper
* I'll always make a funny face or at least smile when going through an EZ Pass toll booth
* Left handed and born two months premature (my literal due date was April 1st and I feel like that says a lot lol)
* 😅 is my favorite emoji
* I can't really have caffeine anymore so I'm not a coffee drinker, and I don't have soda a lot - but birch beer is my WEAKNESS
* And I have to edge the microwave and stop it with a second to go

Please message me with your name, age and where-ish you are. Hopefully you have some time, because I'd love to connect. Also - this is a dating post, so please plan on sending a few photos of yourself early on.

I live in Eastern PA - so if you're nearby, cool! If not that's cool too, but please be in either the US or Canada just for time zones.

I'll also admit I'm feeling semi burned out from dating and going through the process. I've deleted all my dating apps, so you're my only hope for now. I have a lot of love and attention to give - if you show me yours too, I think we'll both be happy in the end!

Talk soon! Or if not, enjoy the rest of your night

There were some attempts on both sides to get closure in the following year or so, but we were both young, immature, and pretty bad at it. Eventually we stopped talking. Life moved on. After a longer amount of time than I’d like to admit, I had moved on too. Or at least I thought I had.

Lately, we’ve exchanged a few casual messages online. Nothing deep, just surface-level friendly stuff once or twice a week. And I’ve realized something: I’m still carrying baggage from that relationship. Not longing, or hope, but just something that never properly concluded.

I’m genuinely happy now. I’m with someone I care about deeply. But the happiness I have now feels different. It’s less intense, less intoxicating, more grounded. What I have now is a shared love and understanding, and so I sometimes find myself avoiding thoughts about that old relationship, because when I go there, I spiral—regret, what-ifs, emotional noise I don’t really want to jeopardize what I currently have.

It feels weird to admit that after all this time, I’m thinking about asking my ex to grab a coffee. Not to rekindle anything, or to be dramatic. Just to say what never got said. Maybe take back some of what was, and apologize properly. I’m not proud of who I was back, or how I handled myself. I don’t want to carry a version of myself I’ve outgrown.

The hard part is that my current partner has some of the same jealousy I used to struggle with myself. I know bringing this up could trigger something, even though my intentions are clean. But part of me also believes that not doing this might be a kind of emotional dishonesty to both myself and my current relationship.

I keep going back and forth. Part of me says to just leave it buried—it’s been over ten years. But the truth is, I never really walked away from it. I just shut the door and hoped that would be enough. It wasn’t. This isn’t about wanting them back. It’s not some secret hope. It’s about facing something I’ve avoided for years because it still knots up my chest when I think about it. I don’t want to keep carrying around a version of myself that never got to finish the conversation. I think I just need to sit with it one last time, out loud, and then finally let it go—for real this time.",2,1749598066.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False

Americano
Espresso (single)

A Filter Coffee x Matcha section - This section is meant for drip/filtered coffee and matcha drinks. [Undercounter: Bin, Refrigerator, Storage]
Pastry section & POS - This section is meant for payment, hand-offs to customers, ordering of pastries through a pastry counter display and a toaster to heat things up. [Undercounter: Storage]

Packaging & Wash area - This section includes a sink and space for packaging the drinks. This area needs to be accessible to the Espresso section and the Filter Coffee Section without crossing each other's path. The groups operate moving only in a line. [Undercounter: Ice Box]

My main concerns are comfortability while working since I usually work from coffee shops or libraries. And organization. Im willing to spend up to $1500 on anything I need. I dont want to do any type of build as I wont be doing this after summer. Is there a resource you'd recommend that would give me details on everything I need? Im thinking

1. Some type of bed obviously. My Outback has a slope when I put the back seats down so Im thinking of a table or something under it. I know most people use half the back for a sleeping setup and the other half for storage. Ideally I would like the whole back space but not sure if I will have enough room for other things. I was thinking just a sleeping pad like I use for camping or fold up mattress. 

2. Battery. What would I need to charge my Starlink, laptop, phone, cooking, etc. I know most people have solar panels too. I do plan on being in a town once a week or so so wondering if I will need solar or can just charge in town?

3. Work setup. I have a steering wheel desk but I cant imagine working 8 hours a day from this. If I do it outside, I would probably need a small table or stand, chair, and a covering for weather and sun.

4. Maybe a rooftop storage space bins to store everything, etc

5. Cooking and refrigeration. I cook simply usually meat and fruits/veggies. Probably need some type of refrigerator. For cooking, I would love to use my air fryer as it is super easy and I would be able to meal prep and cook days worth of food at once, but not sure if this is doable with power storage.

Now, for context, my boyfriend and I are open. We use Grindr and Sniffies to talk to others and chat. Most of the time- 99% of the time- we have sex with others together.

Hi everyone,

I’m a 26F Indian with dry, sensitive skin (I have ichthyosis vulgaris, which mainly affects my body-my facial skin is dry/dehydrated but not flaky). I didn’t have textured skin or clogged pores until I turned 21, but ever since then, I’ve noticed persistent texture, especially around my cheeks, jawline, and chin. Despite a consistent skincare routine and minimal makeup, my skin just doesn’t feel smooth anymore, and my pores have become much more visible.

Here’s my current skincare routine:

AM: 

1. Wash face with water
2. CosRX Snail Mucin Essence
3. Cetaphil Moisturising Cream
4. Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun: Rice + Probiotics SPF

PM: 

1. Double cleanse (Beauty of Joseon cleansing oil + Vanicream cleanser) 
2. Sometimes exfoliate weekly with AHA 
3. I recently switched from The Inkey List Retinol to Adapalene (just started) -> 
4. Cosrx snail mucin, 
5. then Cetaphil moisturising cream

Other context: 

I wear under-eye concealer, but it doesn’t budge or spread to the rest of my face. I wear a creamy blush sometimes, it’s from ELF. Maybe that’s what’s causing it? 

•I don’t have oily skin or sweat much-my skin is naturally very dry. 
•I wash my pillowcases weekly. 
•I don’t eat much sugar-just a bit in my morning coffee. 
•I used the Inkey List Retinol lotion every night for a long time, but it didn’t help with the texture or clogged pores.

What’s confusing is that I didn’t used to have any of these issues, no noticeable texture or enlarged pores until my 20s. Now, makeup seems to emphasize the texture even more. I’m starting to wonder: 

•Is my cleansing oil (Beauty of Joseon) too heavy for my skin and possibly clogging my pores? 
•Is the Cetaphil cream too occlusive? 
•Do I need BHA (like salicylic acid) in addition to AHA to address clogged pores? 
•Could I be over-exfoliating and making my dry skin worse? 

Or is something else completely throwing my skin off?

I’ve been trying for years to fix this and feel pretty lost. Any help or product suggestions (especially for dry, clogged, textured skin) would be hugely appreciated!",9,1749597632.0,SkincareAddiction,8,0.8,False
1l8djn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/1l8djn8/my_office_is_haunted/,My office is haunted,"I work for a doctor's office that is situated beside a hospital nearly a century old. The building I work in was built 10 years ago, and is three stories of assorted specialists and doctor offices that aren't associated with the hospital. Behind it is the emergency room, which is actually older than the hospital. I'm not surprised about the hospital or emergency area being haunted. It holds a great amount of history, so I can expect there to be lost spirits roaming around those building. But I never expected those spirits to drift over to my office building which has to be at least 50 feet away. 

My first experience happened in early morning hours six months ago. It wasn't quite 8:00 when the lobby door knob rattled loudly. I watched the door, expecting a patient to walk in, and even went to check the hallway when no one walked in. Since we are the only doctor's office on the third floor, and this hallway is long, there's nowhere someone can hide.  This happened a few times that morning before the first patient of the day came in. Later, as I was telling my co-workers about the odd rattling, an  appointment card lifted from the card holder, flipped in the air, and landed in front of us on the desk. 

None of us had an explanation for it and it has never happened again. After that, I began hearing voices in the stairwell. It always sounded like someone mumbling downstairs, but there would never be anyone downstairs. Other times, I'd hear footsteps and no one would be taking the stairs but me. My coworkers heard it as well, so we knew we weren't going crazy. One coworker once had the lobby television turn on at random, flip channels, then turn back off. The remote was in a cubby, and it's an older TV, so there's no way someone could have turned it on by app. No one else was in the office, since it was lunch time. 

There have been times the office chairs will roll at their stations, and we have all witnessed it happening. A couple of turns, the coffee table in the lobby has been moved, and we've heard the sound of it moving both times. 

This evening was the scariest of all, though. I was the last in my office to leave, and the storms had been raging all afternoon, so I opted to take the stairs on the opposite end of the hallway. About 3/4 of the way, there were rapid footsteps behind me. I knew there was no one else in that hallway, but I looked behind me anyway, and the steps came to a quick stop. It made me nervous, and I picked up the pace. I was halfway down the stairs, just past the second floor, when the door on the third landing banged open and shut hard. 

I'll admit that I screamed. I waited a few seconds, mostly out of fear, then ran down the steps. The third floor door crashed open again as I got to the first landing, and I thought I heard footsteps, but they could have been mine echoing at that point. I ran out of the building. Tomorrow, I have to go in early, and I'll be alone for at least thirty minutes. Worse, there will be storms again, and I'll have to use the stairs. I'm scared.

1l8dioh,https://www.reddit.com/r/OntarioHomeRenovation/comments/1l8dioh/what_are_the_best_2025_soundproofing_products_for/,What Are the Best 2025 Soundproofing Products for Multigenerational Homes?,"When Alex’s teenage grandson moved in with his electric drum kit, the tension in the house *spiked*. Alex’s back‐of‐the‐mind dream of a peaceful multigenerational home was quickly replaced by pounding bass—and he realized soundproofing couldn’t wait. He dove into a months‑long investigation, weighing off‑the‑shelf materials, professional installations, government rebates, and Ontario-specific considerations. What emerges below is a deep, research‑driven guide to 2025’s top soundproofing solutions—complete with relatable, real-world messaging that resonates with Google and Reddit visitors alike.

# 🎯 Why It Matters in Ontario Multi‑Gen Homes

* **Close quarters = conflict risk**: Ontario's high housing costs mean many households are now multigenerational—up to three generations sharing one roof. But without proper sound separation, privacy evaporates.
* **Health, stress & well‑being**: Research links excessive noise to elevated stress and sleep disruption—serious when elderly or children are living under one roof.
* **Legal & rental compliance**: Basement suites must meet sound‑transmission standards (typically STC ratings of 50+). Investing in proper materials avoids headaches and improves property value.
* **Energy and insulation co‑benefits**: Many soundproofing materials also enhance thermal efficiency—helpful with Ontario’s hot summers and icy winters.

# 🔍 Proven Soundproofing Strategies for 2025

# 1. Mass‑Loaded Vinyl (MLV) for Walls & Ceilings

* A thin, dense sheet that adds mass without sacrificing space.
* Rated STC \~27–30 per layer; double layering with resilient clips dramatically boosts performance.
* *Ontario tip*: Look for low‑VOC options and rebates under programs like Canada Greener Homes.

# 2. Resilient Channel with Double Drywall

* Decouples drywall from framing, cutting sound path.
* Combined with double drywall and acoustic caulking, achieves STC 55+.
* *Note*: Requires professional installers versed in Ontario Code and fire‑separation standards.

# 3. Acoustic Insulation (Rock‑ or Glass‑Wool)

* Fill stud cavities with dense batts (Rockwool Safe’n’Sound or Knauf Rock Mineral).
* Big bang for buck—both thermal and acoustic gains.
* *Sidenote*: Ensure vapor barrier use to avoid moisture in Ontario winters.

# 4. Acoustic Panels and Fabric‑Backed Panels

* Decorative panels from brands like Acoustica or Real Acoustics absorb echoes.
* Best for upper families areas—living rooms, lounges, hallways.
* Over drywall or existing surfaces; ideal DIY with adhesive strips.

# 5. Soundproof Windows & Doors

* Double/triple-pane windows with laminated glass reduce noise \~30‑35 dB.
* Solid-core doors with perimeter seals cut airborne noise substantially.
* Look for options certified for Ontario homes.

# 6. Carpet and Underlayments

* Soft surfaces cut impact noise from upstairs footsteps.
* Combine with thick pad rated for acoustics.
* Reconnects generations: creates quieter bedroom configurations upstairs.

# 7. Green Glue Compound for Retrofit Walls

* A dampening compound applied between drywall layers—excellent for retrofits.
* Adds STC 5–10 to wall assemblies.
* Ontario builders value it in pre‑approved suites.

# 8. Sealant and Draft-Stop Tactics

* Caulking cracks, sealing outlets, patching floors cuts flanking noise.
* Acoustic sealant (e.g., OSI Quiet Seal) is UL-certified and code‑compliant.
* Simple but essential—a must‑do for DIYers.

# 🏷️ Ontario‑Specific Incentives & Resources

* **Canada Greener Homes Grant**: Rebates available for upgrading insulation and windows (if combined with insulative soundproofing steps).
* **Municipal basement suite incentives**: Some cities (e.g., Toronto, Vaughan) offer rebates or relaxed building fees for accessory units meeting soundproof thresholds.
* **Energy Star and CSA‑Certified products**: Only approved low‑VOC, certified products qualify for government programs.
* **Local installers**: GTA companies like Warm Cozy Cozy and JAD Soundproofing offer complete assessments and comply with code.

# 🧰 DIY vs Professional: What t0 Choose

|Task|DIY-Friendly?|Ontario Considerations|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Caulking, carpets, insulation|✅|Use low‑VOC sealants, follow fire‑code vapor barrier rules|
|Add acoustic panels|✅|Place on shared walls, maintain 40mm air gap for best loss|

# 🗣️ Real‑Life Example: Alex’s Family Transformation

“When my grandson’s drum kit hit—literally—I realized late that night that something had to change. I started by plugging leaks: outlets, bottom boards, ceiling trims. Then I spent a weekend installing Rockwool batts inside studs—and wow, what a difference. We added resilient-channel cross-bars, two layers of drywall with Green Glue, and installed a new solid-core door with a perimeter gasket. Now my downstairs theatre room *finally works*. Drums don’t shake the whole house, I get my morning coffee in peace, and everyone wins—including any visiting renters.”

# 📌 Key Takeaways

1. **Prioritize sealing and insulation first**—acoustic gains + thermal comfort.
2. **Use mass + decoupling strategically**—resilient channel + drywall upgrades make a big impact.
3. **Don’t forget floors, ceilings, windows, doors**—sound travels in all directions.
4. **Mix DIY and professional installation**—simple steps avoid permits but save money. Major wall assemblies may need certified help.
5. **Look for rebates early**—document products and contractors meeting eco/sound standards.

# ✅ Final Checklist for Ontario Soundproofing

* \[ \] Conduct a sound-log (measure noise times, sources)
* \[ \] Identify main walls/floors requiring insulation
* \[ \] Choose materials: insulation batts → resilient channels → drywall
* \[ \] Upgrade doors and windows to acoustic-rated units
* \[ \] Choose decorative panels for shared spaces
* \[ \] Fill all cracks with acoustic sealant
* \[ \] Explore all rebates (Greener Homes Grant, municipal incentives)
* \[ \] Apply for permits if necessary
* \[ \] Insist on STC-rated products, low-VOC, and CSA/Energy‑Star certifications",1,1749597418.0,OntarioHomeRenovation,0,1.0,False

#▌Main stories covered:

>- **[NEWS]  Bloomberry shares pump on MegaFUNalo launch...** Shares of **Enrique Razon’s** casino resort operator, **Bloomberry** [BLOOM 5.69 ▼3.9%; 349% avgVol] [[link](https://www.ggrasia.com/bloomberry-launches-online-gaming-platform-shares-soar)], surged on Monday after it launched its online gaming platform, **MegaFUNalo**, with a marketing blitz in print and social media. According to **GGR Asia**, the MegaFUNalo platform “features free-to-play games, live shows, and real-money prizes, as well as free-to-watch movies. It offers digital versions of slot and casino games such as poker, blackjack, roulette, and baccarat, as well as several arcade games.” MegaFUNalo will “complement” BLOOM’s existing online gaming platform, Solaire Online, which is more focused on live casino games and integration with BLOOM’s physical casino assets. BLOOM shares were up 18.4% on Monday, but slid back 3.9% during yesterday’s session.
>    - ***MB:*** The MegaFUNalo launch had a lot of buzz online which is exactly what BLOOM will need if it wants to go toe-to-toe with the heavyweight champ, **DigiPlus** [PLUS 61.10 ▼5.9%; 254% avgVol], and its 7.5 million monthly active users. All of my coverage of BLOOM’s digital offering has been somewhat negative, because BLOOM’s own PR framed this new offering to sound like just an extension of **Solaire Online**. That made me think Razon’s strategy was too tied to the physical casinos in some kind of sunk cost fallacy kind of way. But this launch took a different approach, with goofy gamified characters straight out of something titos and titas might play on their phones while waiting for their turn to sing at a family reunion. That’s the sweet spot. Online gaming isn’t about glitz and glamor. It’s about convenience and “fun”. Oh, and losing money to **Ricky “The House” Razon**.

>- **[NEWS]  DITO reiterates business plan in response to PSE’s inquiry...** **DITO CME** [DITO 1.08 ▼10.7%; 385% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=f049c11664799786ec6e1601ccee8f59)], the holdco of **Dito Telecommunity** (Dito Tel), provided investors with an update on its fundraising goals to pay for its expensive network expansion and growing debt obligations. DITO said that it plans to raise an additional ₱28.83 billion in equity through private placements between now at 2028, and that it will look to convert approximately ₱26 billion in shareholder advances to equity before the end of this year.
>    - ***MB:*** I saw a number of comments about how the private placement figure is dramatically lower than what DITO said in its previous response to a similar inquiry in August 2024, but I think that’s an incorrect take. I’m happy to be corrected if my take is wrong, but in August 2024, DITO said that it targeted to raise ₱40.26 billion within the next five years, but that it had already raised ₱5.5 billion in 2023 through three private placements with **XTerra** and the **Summit Telco group**. In the latest response, DITO said that it is now targeting to raise an additional ₱28.83 billion, but this section now outlines the massive **Subscription Framework Agreement** that was signed with the Summit Telco group as part of Summit Telco’s purchase of 9 billion primary common shares for ₱9 billion, plus the ₱1 billion DITO took from **DITO Holdco** in 2024, and ₱2.87 billion from Summit Telco group and another ₱0.197 billion from DITO Holdco in 2025. Altogether, my reading here is that as of August 2024, DITO had taken in ₱5.5 billion but was targeting ₱40.26 billion more. As of this latest response, they’d taken ₱13 billion (out of that original ₱40.26 target), and are still aiming to get another ₱28.83 billion more. If that analysis is correct, then this disclosure actually means that DITO has increased its 5-year equity raise target by about 4%, not slashed it.Did I read that wrong? 

>- **[QUESTION]  Why doesn’t the PSE have high-profile activist investors like Bill Ackman in the US?...** Great question! Let’s get everyone caught up before I give my take.

>  **What is an activist investor?**  What the reader is talking about here is the type of investor that accumulates a big chunk of a company’s outstanding shares (5-10%), with the goal of leveraging that position to obtain board seats and make reforms within that company to increase the value of the shares. In the US, these activist investors use media (socmed and traditional media) to whip up shareholder votes for the activist investor’s preferred slate of board candidates, in direct opposition to the current leadership and its proposed slate of candidates. **Bill Ackman** is a good contemporary example of this type of investor (though his recent socmed presence has descended into some culture war trash). A good historical example might be **Carl Icahn**. 

>  **Why do they work in the US?**  The American markets have a better legal system that is configured (in some jurisdictions, and in some cases) to handle these types of issues more quickly and with greater certainty. American markets are also deeper, with greater transaction volumes layered on top of much larger public floats. 

>  **Why not on the PSE?**  I don’t think there’s any one reason, but instead a jumble of structural and cultural conditions that make activist investing less attractive. The weight/importance of these reasons is debatable, but to me, the primary problem is the PSE’s anemic public floats. In the US, companies on the S&P 500 have substantially all of their shares in the public float. It’s not uncommon to see companies with public floats of 70% to 90%. Here, companies are usually family-owned, with floats that rarely get above 50%. The controlling shareholders dominate the board, oftentimes with family members or long-serving “soldiers” of the family holding seats and key committee positions. Volumes are low, so even if you or I decided that we wanted to acquire a huge chunk of shares, it’s very difficult to do this without driving up the price of the stock and drawing a great deal of attention to ourselves. Institutional investors, who in the US might back an activist investor to push for reform, are often drawn from those same family-owned conglomerates. Culturally, the Philippine business and finance sectors are generally averse to conflict. We are a high-context society that places a great deal of value on relationships and hierarchy.

>    - ***MB:*** The closest thing we have to a Bill Ackman right now is probably Leandro Leviste. Instead of leveraging a pool of capital--like his American comparison might--he’s leveraging his political connections to find and monetize deals for himself and his family. I’m finding it very difficult to think of any other examples, but I’m not convinced that this is a bad thing. I mean, yes, I think the factors that I’ve speculated as contributing to the lack of activist investors are bad (low public floats, low volume, family-held conglomerates in control) for the PSE’s health, but I don’t think it’s automatically bad that we don’t have a cohort of brash investors weaponizing capital for selfish gain. It’s beyond my pay grade to know if we can have the former (high floats and high volume) without the latter (activist investors), but if we had to suffer a few goobers like Bill Ackman here locally, but it meant that we had a vibrant and deep market with tons of activity and lower family control, then that would be a tradeoff I’d be willing to accept.

1l8dhxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArrowVDisscussions/comments/1l8dhxp/review_11_supergirl_season_5/,Review 11: Supergirl Season 5,"In the Season 5 premiere, Supergirl stops a school bus from mowing down a bunch of kids. The kids cheer Supergirl and thank her. Lena approaches and confronts her, calling out Supergirl as Kara, confirming she knows the truth. Lena punches Kara into the school bus. Wait, that's it, Lena killed Supergirl? Nope, just a simulation Lena was in to take her aggresssions out on Kara. Lena is angry at Kara for keeping her secret from the former. Lena created an AI, named ""Hope"" because she feels she can't trust anyone. This is due to not just Kara keeping her secret, but J'onn, Alex, Brainy, Nia, and James.

Kara meets up for breakfast, with Alex, J'onn, Nia, Brainy, and James at Noonan's. They discuss the awards ceremony, Alex convincing Kara to tell Lena she's Supergirl. Kara goes into work, her new boss is not her one of her best friends; It's Andrea Rojas. Andrea bought CatCo WorldWide Media and became the new Editor-In-Chief. Andrea has a whole new vision for CatCo, rather than real journalism and and seeking the truth, she's for sensationalism. It's her view that will make more money and bring in more business.

At a museum, a little girl who's seemingly part of a field trip spots a Dinosaur skeleton attack the people inside. Supergirl flies, or should I say crashes onto the scene (more on that later), the little girl makes her escape in a Kryptonian pod. Kara returns to the DEO and discusses the agenda of the day. Kara and the others discuss the holes in her cape. Brainy says he'll fix it. The Little girl arrives at a warehouse in town. She is actually a shapeshifting male Martian, one who was brought ot Earth-38 by Mar Novu/The Monitor. He's using this warehouse as a hideout so that he make prepare his revenge on J'onn J'onzz. 

It's time for Kara's Pullitzer Prize Ceremony, and her moment of truth. Kara takes Lena aside for a private conversation. Suddenly, the party is attacked by Midnight, a Phantom Zone prisoner that J'onn J'onzz defeated years prior. Kara reconciles with and reveals her identity to Lena before using a new suit Brainy created for her (much to Kara's excitement. She even says ""Pants!"". Kara gets excited of the simplist things, so cute!) to stop a black hole Midnight opened and send her back to the Phantom Zone. After Midnight is stopped, the ceremony continues, Lena speaks to the attendees about Truth and Honesty, before awarding Kara with the Pulitzer. Beneath that warm smile Lena had, was disdain, hatred, and anger over what Lena saw as deceit and betrayal.

While Kara shows more openness to Lena about her secret, Lena re-enters the simulation to vent; pledging to use Kara's trust to ""fix mankind"". James quits CatCo, refusing to support Andrea's sensationalist plans. Elsewhere, J'onn's brother, Malefic, vows to get revenge himself following Midnight's failure despite J'onn not remembering having a brother while Eve Teschmacher returns to National City on Leviathan's orders, but gets black-bagged.

In the next episode, J'onn seeks Kelly's help in remembering who Malefic is. He learns that his memories of the Martian Civil War were altered, but that Malefic (played by Phil Lamarr) was his brother who betrayed the Green Martians to aid the White Martians. J'onn and Malefic receive immense pain whenever they attack one another due to a curse, which J'onn still suffers from, so he asks Kelly to soothe his pain using Q-waves, but Malefic secretly sees this and realizes Q-waves can help further his revenge against his brother. Meanwhile, Lena reveals to Eve her plan to use Andrea's technology to improve humanity by giving them Hope's altruism and loyalty before having Hope take over Eve's body. Elsewhere, Kara chafes at her new work assignments, and rival reporter William Dey seems to be on the trail of her secret identity.

Over the course of the season, Kara and Lena seemingly get closer in the aftermath of the latter finding out about the former's secret. What Kara doesn't realize is that, Lena is playing her for a fool as part of her revenge. First Kara surpirses Lena with treats from France and Ireland, which is on brand as she's been known to bring Big Belly Burgers and Fries up to her Office. In this case, Lena know's Kara is Supergirl, and even has this exchange. 

""You brought me coffee éclairs from Cafe Rue Serret on the Champs-Élysées?"" asked Lena. ""I know they're your favorite."" replied Kara. ""And the cappuccinos, did you really go to Pavé in Milan?"" said Lena. ""It didn't take me that long."" said Kara. ""You know, I have really been missing out on the perks of having Supergirl as a best friend."" said Lena. ""Well, we have a lot of lost time to make up for."" said Kara. ""Yeah, but you know you don't have to go to Paris to pick up lunch, Kara. That's not what's important to me. But, these scones from Dublin, oh my God, you can fly these in every day."" replied Lena. 

Later, Lena and Kara break into Lex'ss prison cell to steal his diary. Lena was using Kara all along and the latter didn't know it. This Culminates in Kara and Lena going to the Fortress of Solitude to get a weapon and defeat Leviathan. Rama Khan (played by Mitch Pileggi) shows up to the Fortress to Attack Supergirl. Although he's kept at bay, there's another problem on the Horizon. A black haired Elephant in the Room named Lena Luthor. She stole Myriad and drops all pretenses. 

Lena confronts Kara over what she perceives as betrayal. She goes on a tirade over how Kara made her believe in people and trust in friendship, all the while lying to her. Lena explains how Lex survived his fall, using a transmatter portal. She also says that She shot and Killed Lex to prevent anyone else from getting hurt. With his dying breath, Lex told Lena that Kara was Supergirl. Lena sets off the fortresses trap, Kara asks if she's gonna kill the latter, Lena says ""No Kara, I'm not gonna kill you, I'm not a villain, you shouldn't have treated me like one."" 

Lena tries to make Non Nochere work with Myriad in response to Supergirl's lies. In her mind she's helping to make to world better by making people not lie. Lena and Hope tried to activate Myriad using the Q-wave generator but were stopped by Supergirl and the D.E.O. 

Also this season, James Olsen leaves National City and moves to Calvintown to run the Calvintown Gazette. J'onn and Malefic reconnect as brothers, when the too join minds. Malefic helps the Superfriends defeat Lena and Non Nochere. Mar Novu shows up after Malefic leaves for Mars, explaining he was the one who brought the former to Earth to test J'onn for the Crisis ahead. Our Big Crossover of the year happens this season, we all know what that is: Crisis on Infinite Earths. We have Lex Luthor, and Leviathan as major threats. We even get guest appearences from the like of Winn Schott, and the other Arrowverse heroes.

Casting. Much of the Cast returns this year. Mehcad Brooks leaves this season after  the previous four seasons. Julie Gonzalo joins the cast as Andrea Rojas/Acrata. The dynamic is a great as ever this season. Andrea Rojas, how do I describe her? She's the anti-Cat Grant. (More on that in the writing section). Phil LaMarr as Malefic is brilliant casting. The performers that are a part of leviathan are great too. This was the last season to have Tyler Hoechlin and Bitsie Tulloch as guests. Jon Cryer nailed it as Lex Luthor. He and Katie McGrath work well as brother and Sister. She and Melissa have wonderful chemistry as well. 5/5

Writing: Let's start with Lena's story, I'm not gonna lie. I don't like Lena in this season. She went off the deep end and began the decent not this season but actually Season three when Lena was making Krytptonite and was doing secret experiments. You go into season four, Lena is of the Mindset the people should be give powers. If that's not enough, she even works alongside not just Colonel Haley, but Lex Luthor. One of my favorite moments is where Kara tells Lena ""You have never understood what it means to share a secret identity with someone. How much danger that puts them in. You... you never even understood that I kept my identity from you because I wanted to protect you. And I know, I know that I hurt you by waiting so long to tell my truth. But what about all the ways you hurt me? You pretended to be my friend for weeks. Just so you could manipulate me. You stole from me. You convinced me to steal for you. And then, then, you even......you... you used kryptonite on me. I made one mistake. *One* mistake that was only ever meant to protect you. And in return, all you did was hurt me in every way imaginable."" Another Lena and Kara moment is...well here's that Exchange. Lena: ""Let me guess. You're here to tell me once again that I should forgive you. Or maybe that I shouldn't work with my brother?"" Kara: ""Not this time. I recognize I made a mistake in hiding my identity from you for so long, but the past is the past, and I can't change it. Forgive me or not, that's your choice. Just like it's your choice to work with Lex. I'm done blaming myself for your bad decisions."" Lena ""Then why are you here?"" Kara: ""To tell you that from now on, you're accountable for your own actions. If you decide to forgive me, I will be there for you. But if you continue to work with Lex, if you go through with whatever it is the two of you are planning, I will do everything in my power to stop you. Just like I would any other villain.""There's other moments this season I love too, like in 514 where Kelly gave Alex a bento box with Dumpling in it. She's all sad and Mopey that Alex won't give her any. Probably because Kara calls dibs on all the Potstickers. LOL! Crisis Part one is one of my favorite episodes. Andrea is one of the worst parts of this season, that is either a good thing in the sense that the mission was achieved and the show tackled the theme of journalistic integrity, or you simply brush Andrea off as a pest and move on to the rest of the show. 3/5

Special Effects: 5/5
Sound Effects: 5/5
Entertainment and Replay Value: I would totally watch this season again, but ignore such characters as Andrea Rojas. 3/5

Season Score: 21/25
Final Score: 31/35

Final Thoughts: Great Season, but not one of the better ones. The show took itself a little too seriously, which doesn't take away from the overall experience entirely, but it's still not the best entry into the Supergirl series and Arrowverse proper. Jessica Queller , is the showrunner and had been since Season four with Robert Rovner. Quller gave us a much better installment in Season four, but here she's not consistent. You have some great episodes, and some not so great characters or moments. Not a bad season, but if you had to have the worst one, this is it. The first four seasons were a lot better than this one. I will still take Season 5 of Supergirl over most of Superman & Lois.

The Cast worked extremly well together, Melissa Benoist is amazing as ever. She carried the show like a real pro, even in a very inconsistent season. Most of the Inconsistancies happened Post-Crisis. Eve Tessmacher worked with Lex and was complicit in shooting James Olsen back in Season Four. She wormed her way into CatCo, eventually working as part of the conspiracy during that year. We also learn at the end of Season Four that Eve is part of Leviathan. Fast forward to the post-Crisis timeline in the new Multiverse, it's established that Eve had been recruited into Leviathan as a Teenager thanks to her Academic brilliance. 

For me if I were to write Season 5 of Supergirl, I would have had Lena become Paragon of Truth, not Lex. Think about, Lex may have told Lena the truth about Kara on his deathbed, but he did so not as a caring, loving big brother, looking after his sister. He did it as a big fuck you to Lena, Supergirl, and the Superfriends. I may do a rewrite of Season 5 as an exercise sometime, we'll see. Until then we have one more season to go, will it be better than this? Stay tuned.

Notes: We have a 19 episode season, this time around. Originally we were to get 23, but that number went down to 20 due to Melissa's pregnancy. From 20 we down to 19 with one unfinished, due to the COVID-19 shutdowns that we all know too well. That unfinished episode was supposed to be the Season five finale, but became the Season six premiere. Here's some DC Trivia, Phil LaMarr, had previously voiced Virgil Hawkins/Static in Static Shock, and John Stewart/Green Lantern in Justice League and Justice League Unlimited. Wil Wheaton, who cameoed in Crisis Part One voiced Aqualad in Teen Titans.

I'm considering to upgrade from the bz10 Heat ecxhange machine I've been using for the past \~5 years. It's in many ways a nice machine for my daily 2-6 drinks including both espresso, americano and milk-based. My reasons for ugrading are more consistent temperatures withot purging, preinfusion and the timed/volumetric options, so I don't have to manually time each shot.

I'm many ways the Profitec MOVE seems like a perfect fit. I'm not in any hurry, and it seems that I can get it with a few weeks delivery.

I did consider the Ascaso Steel Duo Plus as I like the heat coil for brewing, but I don't like the steam-implementation. The Ascaso Baby T seems like a really nice mix with the heat coil for brewing a boiler for steam, but initially the price made me dismiss it. However, now I've found a used baby T zero for the same price as a new Profitec move.

I don't mind bying used but I'm still learning towards the MOVE for the more compact design and slightly better looks (I think). However, I'm also intriged by the assumed top notch quality of the baby T. I might enjoy the app-option for the baby T, but for now, I prefer not to use an app for making coffee.

I woke up feeling more of the same with my skin feeling uncomfortable, headache, and I just feel so weak. I don’t have an appetite but was able to eat and drink stuff.

You were the turning point in my life. The face that changed everything. You didn’t need to say anything, hell we never spoke of anything of substance and I was always afraid of saying the wrong thing. Saying too much, scaring you away. 

Seeing you walk across the parking lot waving your arms, tapping your hands to music the same I would when I walked. Seeing you do this cute little thing helped me feel less weird about my movements and I admired how “you” you seemed and how you walked around owning your self, not boasting or arrogantly. But you had this sort of peace about you. And this little nerdy side which I was charmed by. You liked lots of the same music as I did and I thought that was cool but also felt like I had to prove I wasn’t just going along with your interests to get on your good side but I thought it was cool we actually shared some similarities. 

I remember the first text on tinder “I like your piercings” I was surprised someone like you would even match with me. I wish I replied “thanks I like your face” but that’s long past now. 

You made my day when you agreed to hang out sometime outside of work. 
And again years later when I asked you for a coffee and you said yes. 

Still confused and a bit sad that we never went for coffee but maybe that’s because I became overbearing very quickly. 

I like your tattoos and how you kinda embarrassingly told me about them even though I already thought they were cool. 

I like that you didn’t seem too weirded out by my movie choice even though it was pretty raunchy

I like how comfortable I was around you. I can’t smoke with others unless I know them well but when we smoked, I didn’t have the same anxiety I usually get. 

If we had known each other longer or in a different context, I wished I could’ve cuddled up to you but it wasn’t a date and I didn’t want to weird you out too much since we worked together. 
Was always terrified of getting a reputation at work of being too flirty, or weird. 
Although I gave myself a weird enough reputation with my choice of graphic tees I’d wear to work and by the random shit I’d say to different people. 


I was also always secretly afraid you’d think I was a stalker since I randomly showed up at your work one day and worked there for like two years. I swear I didn’t know you worked there and was so embarrassed the first time I seen you walk through line 4s area. 


I also have a pretty weird and messy past and was afraid of bringing you into that and seeing me and learning more about me and my struggles and was worried I’d be too much, too messy, nothing you’d want to be around. And with my ongoing psych issues, I didn’t think it’d be fair to bring anyone into that mess I don’t even want to be in it lol. So it was easier to believe I fucked everything up before anything started and like maybe I was wrong thinking you’re the one. Maybe I’m the delusional one having feelings over someone who doesn’t want me nor ever gave me a hint we’d be anything more than friends. Maybe the bongrips have gotten to my mind and all of these feelings are puppy love delusions or my brain chemicals just firing off in a new way I’m not used to. Either way, I like you I know that much. 

I still daydream about you and give myself anxiety thinking about if we ever happened how I would mess it up, all the things I could say, all the things I wished I said instead, scared of what you think of me or if you do. What you’d say about me to others, how you’d describe me to your parents. Geez thinking of meeting parents makes me just about shit myself lol

Anyways, if it wasn’t obvious I think about you(it’s obvious), you’re one of the only good things I think about. In the wreck of my mind, seeing you walk through there is one of the saving graces. I thank God I even got to meet you and pray you’ll want to catch up one day or even be friends. 

I’ve never loved a man romantically but you were one I thought that could change for. Someone I’d feel safe with, someone I wanted to learn all about, learn your favorites, all your mannerisms, your interests, hear your voice, laugh with and explore new interests and grow together. Maybe I’m too stuck or just not what you need and in that case I hope you find what you need. :)",5,1749596926.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,1,1.0,False

I m currently doing a master with economic & informatics background and my thesis will be about using data mining strategies in trading.

Right now my overall plan looks something like this.

1. Develop a marketregime (bullish/sideways/bearisch) prediction model that uses economic, price and volume data, so I can determine bias
2. Decide upon a setup and finetune the parameters that would make the setup more reliably profitable (stop loss, target etc)
3. Apply both results in real time using an Ai agent or own system
4. Build dashboard to see important performance stats 

I want to apply all this on cryptomarkets because of their volatility.

I can work on this full time 6months now and I m excited to see where it will take me. 

I would be willing into invest in a nice set up too because I think it could be a good investment if I m really pursuing this, but I will also have access to university resources like own server or databricks license  

I m curious what you all think about my ideas, is this even possible? 
Am I massively overerestimating what I can accomplish in +6months with chatgpt premium, coffee and internet?
Is it even possible to find a consistent edge in a markets? Its not difficult to apply randomforests/ decision trees / clustering feature engineering to find an edge, otherwise everybody would do it, right?

If any of you have some advice for me I would be very thankful :)

They throw tantrums when upset, get hangry, can’t function without coffee, scream in traffic, and are clearly still possessed by their own inner child, but don’t even realize it. And then they expect the rest of us, those of us who’ve spent years parenting our own damn psyches, to offer sympathy or support.

Here’s what I’ve realized:
Children gravitate to me not because I’m dying to be a parent, but because I see them. I respect them as full humans. I witness them in a way that many parents don’t, because I’ve spent years doing that very work for myself. And yet when kids flock to me, their parents either assume I’m desperate for a child, or that I’m jealous of their family dynamic.
Truth?
I go home and feel grateful I don’t have a kid. Because I am a kid.
A very complex, wounded, fierce inner child that I’m still raising every single day.
Why the hell would I bring another child into my world while I’m still trying to stabilize and re-parent the one inside me?

Yes, I’ve had multiple divorces. Yes, I’ve had abortions. Yes, it’s caused me deep psychological unrest and plenty of stigma.
But you know what else it gave me?
My Self.

Every time I walked away from a marriage that felt like performance instead of partnership, I came home to mySelf. I stopped chasing “the one” and became the one. I’ve learned to sit with my voids instead of stuffing them with titles like “wife” or “mother.”

And here’s the wildest part:
If I ever do raise a human child, maybe at 60, maybe when I feel whole and calm and chosen by life, it’ll be one who is not only adopted, but truly seen.
That kid will not be my savior or my legacy.
They’ll be a soul I’m simply ready to meet.

Because I don’t believe in performing parenthood before you’ve performed your own rebirth.
And I’ve yet to meet a “stable” parent. Most are still haunted by the ghosts of their unloved parts.

So yeah. I’ve had many endings.
But none of them compare to the rebirth I’m living now.
I didn’t lose anything.
I escaped.

Chasing Horizons Without Breaking the Bank: Unearthing the **Cheapest Countries to Fly To**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's face it, the price of a flight can be a major buzzkill when you're planning a trip. It's often the biggest chunk of change you'll lay out, and it can feel like you're just throwing money into the wind. But what if we told you that the key to affordable travel lies not just in *when* you fly, but *where* you fly? That's right, some countries are just inherently cheaper to get to than others, whether it's due to airline competition, geographical proximity, or simply lower demand from certain regions. We're peeling back the curtain on these budget-friendly paradises, showing you where your travel dreams can take flight without emptying your piggy bank. Forget those fancy, overpriced destinations for a minute and let's talk serious bang for your buck when it comes to getting overseas.

### Where Your Pennies Get You the Most Miles: Exploring the Least Expensive Airfare Destinations

We've all been there: staring at flight comparison websites with our eyes glazing over, watching those numbers fluctuate like a chaotic stock market. But what if, instead of fixating solely on the timing of your flight, you focused on the destination itself? Certain countries consistently pop up when we talk about affordable airfare from various parts of the world. These aren't necessarily the places you see plastered all over Instagram – though some certainly are! They are the destinations where airlines compete for your business, where geographical location plays a favorable hand in pricing, and where overall travel costs tend to be lower, making the whole trip a lot more manageable on a budget. Think of it as your strategic advantage in the travel game – knowing where to aim your sights for the most economical entry point.

Let’s break down some of our top picks for the **cheapest countries to fly to**:

1. **Mexico:** Ah, Mexico! A perennial favorite for a reason. From the stunning beaches of the Riviera Maya to the vibrant culture of Mexico City and the ancient ruins scattered throughout the land, Mexico offers a dizzying array of experiences. And the best part? Flights to Mexico, especially from North America, are often incredibly affordable. Plus, once you're there, your money goes a long way. Delicious food, a variety of accommodation options, and vibrant local life make Mexico an all-around budget-friendly winner. You can score seriously good deals, especially if you're flexible with your dates.
2. **Colombia:** Colombia has shed its challenging past and emerged as a truly captivating destination. Bogota's burgeoning art scene, the colonial charm of Cartagena, the coffee region's lush landscapes, and the vibrant energy of Medellin – Colombia has it all. And guess what? Flights to Colombia, particularly from the US and parts of Europe, have become increasingly competitive, leading to lower prices. Once you arrive, you'll find that local transportation, food, and activities are remarkably affordable, allowing you to stretch your budget even further. It's a place that truly offers a rich cultural experience without the hefty price tag.
3. **Portugal:** Europe on a budget? Absolutely! While some Western European countries can feel prohibitively expensive, Portugal stands out as a fantastic exception. The sun-drenched beaches of the Algarve, the historic beauty of Lisbon and Porto, the mouthwatering pastries (pastel de nata, anyone?) – Portugal is a sensory delight. And compared to its neighbors, flights to Portugal are often significantly cheaper, especially during the shoulder seasons. Once you're there, you'll find delicious food, affordable wine, and charming accommodation that won't break the bank. It's proof that you don't need to mortgage your house to experience the magic of Europe.
4. **Spain:** Another European gem that often features on the list of cheapest places to fly to. Bordering Portugal, Spain shares a similar advantage in terms of flight costs from many parts of the world. From the architectural marvels of Barcelona and the passionate flamenco of Seville to the beautiful beaches and delicious tapas everywhere you go, Spain is a feast for the senses. While some cities can be a little pricier than others, overall, Spain offers a fantastic travel experience at a more accessible price point than many other Western European destinations. Plus, the train system makes it easy and relatively inexpensive to hop between cities.
5. **Costa Rica:** Pura Vida! If you're dreaming of lush rainforests, incredible wildlife, and stunning beaches, Costa Rica might be calling your name. Known for its commitment to ecotourism, Costa Rica offers adventure aplenty, from zip-lining through the canopy to exploring volcanoes and surfing world-class waves. Flights to Costa Rica can be surprisingly affordable, especially if you're flying from North America. While some tourist activities and accommodations can lean towards the mid-range, you can still travel Costa Rica on a budget by utilizing local buses, eating at *sodas* (local eateries), and opting for more budget-friendly guesthouses.
6. **Thailand:** Southeast Asia is practically synonymous with budget travel, and Thailand remains a perennial favorite for good reason. The bustling energy of Bangkok, the serene temples, the stunning islands with their crystal-clear waters, and the incredibly delicious and affordable food – Thailand offers an intoxicating blend of culture, adventure, and relaxation. While long-haul flights to Thailand can be a significant cost, they are often more affordable than flights to other similarly distant destinations. And once you're there, your money stretches incredibly far, making the overall trip very budget-friendly.
7. **Vietnam:** Another Southeast Asian marvel, Vietnam offers a rich history, breathtaking landscapes, and some of the most incredible street food you'll ever taste. From the bustling streets of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City to the serene beauty of Ha Long Bay and the ancient charm of Hoi An, Vietnam is a country that captures your soul. Flights to Vietnam are often comparable in price to Thailand, and once you're there, the cost of living and travel is incredibly low. You can enjoy delicious meals, comfortable accommodation, and fascinating experiences without spending a fortune.
8. **Greece:** Dreaming of ancient history, stunning islands, and mouthwatering Mediterranean cuisine? Greece is within reach, even on a tighter budget. While some of the more famous islands can be pricey, mainland Greece and some of the less-visited islands offer incredible beauty and history without the sky-high costs. Flights to Greece, especially to Athens and some of the larger islands, can be surprisingly affordable, particularly during the shoulder seasons. Once there, you can find budget-friendly accommodation, enjoy delicious and inexpensive food, and explore ancient wonders that will leave you in awe.
9. **Morocco:** Step into a world of vibrant colors, bustling souks, and stunning architecture in Morocco. From the imperial cities of Marrakech and Fes to the stunning landscapes of the Atlas Mountains and the Sahara Desert, Morocco offers a truly unique cultural experience. Flights to Morocco from Europe are often very affordable, making it a great option for a quick getaway. Once you're there, you can find budget-friendly accommodation in riads (traditional houses with courtyards), enjoy delicious and inexpensive tagines, and haggle for treasures in the souks.
10. **Peru:** Home to the awe-inspiring Machu Picchu, Peru is a land of incredible history, diverse landscapes, and vibrant culture. While the trek to Machu Picchu can be a significant expense, flights to Lima are often more affordable than you might think, especially from the Americas. Once in Peru, you can explore the colonial charm of Cusco, hike through the Andes, and indulge in the country's renowned culinary scene – all at relatively affordable prices. Public transportation is inexpensive, and there are plenty of budget-friendly accommodation and dining options.

Of course, the absolute **cheapest countries to fly to** will depend heavily on *where you are flying from*. A flight from New York to Cancun will be significantly cheaper than a flight from Sydney to Cancun, naturally. However, these countries consistently rank high on the affordability scale when considering flight costs from various major hubs around the world.

Cracking the Code: Why Are These the **Cheapest Countries to Fly To**?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

So, what’s the secret sauce? Why are certain destinations more accessible for our wallets than others when it comes to airfare? It's not magic, I promise! There are concrete reasons behind these price discrepancies, and understanding them can help you make more informed decisions when planning your next adventure. It's a bit like understanding how the stock market works, but way more fun and with significantly better real-world rewards (like stunning beaches and delicious food!). Let’s pull back the curtain and explore the factors that contribute to making certain countries the **cheapest countries to fly to**.

### Dissecting the Airfare Equation: Factors Influencing Flight Costs

The price of a plane ticket is a complex beast, influenced by a multitude of factors all working together in a sometimes bewildering dance. It's not just about distance, although that's certainly a piece of the puzzle. Thinking of it simply as point A to point B is like thinking a gourmet meal is just about the ingredients – the preparation, the presentation, and the overall experience all play a massive role. When it comes to airfare, there are hidden forces at play, shaping those numbers you see on your screen.

Here are some of the key factors that contribute to making certain countries the **cheapest countries to fly to**:

- **Route Popularity and Competition:** This is a big one. When a route is highly popular, airlines want to fly it. And where there are more airlines flying the same route, there's more competition. More competition generally means lower prices as airlines try to undercut each other to attract passengers. Think of it like a bidding war, but for seats on a plane. Countries with high tourism numbers or strong business ties often benefit from this.
- **Geographical Proximity:** This might seem obvious, but it's worth stating. Flying shorter distances generally costs less than flying longer distances simply because it requires less fuel and less time in the air. This is why, for example, flights from the US to Mexico are often cheaper than flights to, say, Australia.
- **Hub Cities and Direct Flights:** Flying into a major international hub city often results in cheaper flights than flying into a smaller, less-trafficked airport. Hubs have more flights, more airlines, and more competition. Plus, direct flights are often (though not always) cheaper than flights with multiple connections, as the airline doesn't have to pay landing fees or deal with logistics at multiple airports. Countries with major international airports that serve as hubs for multiple airlines tend to be more accessible on a budget.
- **Economic Factors and Demand:** The economic health of a country can influence flight prices. If a country relies heavily on tourism, airlines might offer lower fares to attract visitors. Conversely, if a country is experiencing economic hardship, demand for travel *to* that country might decrease, leading airlines to lower prices to fill seats. Global economic trends also play a role; during recessions, travel demand often decreases, leading to lower prices across the board.
- **Fuel Prices:** This is a major operational cost for airlines, and fluctuations in fuel prices are directly reflected in ticket prices. When fuel prices are low, airlines can afford to offer cheaper fares. When they're high, those costs get passed on to the consumer.
- **Time of Year and Seasonality:** This is a classic and probably the most well-known factor. Flying during the high season (when everyone wants to travel, like during school holidays or major festivals) is almost always more expensive than flying during the shoulder season (just before or after the high season) or the low season. Many of the countries we listed benefit from having distinct low seasons, offering prime opportunities for budget travelers.
- **Airline Business Models:** Low-cost carriers (LCCs) have revolutionized air travel, making it possible to fly for incredibly low prices. These airlines operate on a no-frills model, charging extra for things like checked baggage, seat selection, and onboard meals. Countries served by a large number of LCCs tend to have lower average flight prices.
- **Government Policies and Taxes:** Government taxes and airport fees can add a significant amount to the cost of a flight. Some countries have lower taxes on air travel than others, which can make them cheaper to fly to.
- **Currency Exchange Rates:** While not a direct factor in the *price* of the flight itself, a favorable exchange rate can make a country significantly cheaper to visit overall, which can make the higher cost of a flight feel less impactful. However, for our purposes of focusing on the *cheapest countries to fly to*, we're primarily looking at the airfare itself.

Understanding these factors is a crucial first step in becoming a savvy budget traveler. It’s not just about blindly searching for deals; it’s about understanding the forces that shape those deals and using that knowledge to your advantage. Knowing *why* certain destinations are cheaper helps you predict where the best value might be and when the sweet spots are likely to occur.

Timing is Everything: When to Jet Off to the **Cheapest Countries to Fly To**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Knowing *where* to fly for less is half the battle, but knowing *when* to fly is the other equally important piece of the puzzle. Airfare pricing is incredibly dynamic, fluctuating not just by the day, but sometimes by the hour! It's like a constantly moving target, and if you want to hit the bullseye of a cheap flight, you need to understand the rhythm of the airline industry. Flying at the right time can literally save you hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars on your airfare. So, let’s talk strategy and identify the prime windows for scoring seriously cheap flights to those budget-friendly destinations we've been discussing.

### The Calendar of Savings: Best Times of Year and Days of the Week to Find Affordable Flights

Forget everything you thought you knew about rigid travel seasons. While peak season is generally more expensive, there are nuance and opportunity lurking within the calendar. Thinking strategically about your travel dates can unlock significant savings. It's about being a little bit flexible, doing your homework, and using that knowledge to your advantage.

Here’s your guide to timing your flight for maximum savings:

- **The Shoulder Seasons:** This is often the sweet spot for budget travel. Shoulder season typically falls between the peak and off-peak seasons. For many destinations, this means spring (roughly April to May) and fall (roughly September to October/November). The weather is still pleasant, the crowds are smaller than during peak season, and crucially, flight and accommodation prices tend to be significantly lower. You get many of the benefits of visiting during peak season without the inflated costs.
- **The Low Season:** If you're truly dedicated to scoring the absolute lowest prices, traveling during the low season is your best bet. This is typically when the weather is less ideal (rainy season, very hot, or very cold, depending on the destination) or when there are no major holidays or events attracting tourists. While the weather might not be perfect, you’ll find the fewest crowds and the lowest prices for flights and accommodation. Plus, you’ll get a more authentic experience as you’re interacting with locals rather than being surrounded by hordes of tourists.
- **Mid-Week Travel:** This is a classic budget travel tip that still holds true. Flying on Tuesdays and Wednesdays is generally cheaper than flying on Fridays, Saturdays, or Sundays. Most leisure travelers prefer to depart and return on weekends, driving up demand and prices on those days. Business travelers often fly on Mondays and Fridays. By flying mid-week, you're traveling when demand is lower. Think of it as the airlines rewarding you for being willing to fly when fewer people want to.
- **Avoiding Holidays and Major Events:** This is perhaps the most crucial timing tip. Flying around major holidays (like Christmas, New Year's, Thanksgiving, etc.) or during major local festivals and events will almost always result in inflated prices. Everyone wants to travel during these times, and airlines know it. If you can be flexible and avoid these peak periods, you’ll see a significant difference in airfare.
- **Booking in Advance (But Not Too Far):** There’s a sweet spot for booking flights. Booking too far in advance (say, more than 8-10 months out) can be more expensive because airlines haven't released their cheapest fares yet. Booking too late (within a few weeks of departure) is also often more expensive as the remaining seats are likely the most expensive ones. The general consensus for finding the best deals is to book somewhere between 1-3 months out for international flights, and 1-2 months out for domestic flights. However, this can vary depending on the destination and time of year, so it's always worth doing a little research for your specific trip.
- **Flying at Undesirable Times:** Early morning departures and late-night arrivals are often cheaper than flights at more convenient times. While it might mean setting your alarm for an unholy hour or arriving exhausted, the savings can be significant. If you're willing to sacrifice a little comfort for a lower price, this is a great strategy.
- **Utilizing Flight Alert Tools:** Don't have the time to constantly monitor flight prices? No problem! Sign up for flight alerts from websites and apps that track price changes for specific routes. They'll notify you when prices drop, allowing you to snag a deal without constant searching.

Thinking creatively about your travel dates and times can be just as impactful as choosing the right destination. It's about being strategic and taking advantage of those periods when airlines are looking to fill seats. Pair this knowledge with our list of the cheapest countries to fly to, and you’re well on your way to an incredibly affordable and unforgettable adventure!

Beyond the Ticket Price: The True Cost of Exploring the **Cheapest Countries to Fly To**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, so you've found an incredible deal on a flight to one of our recommended budget-friendly havens. High five! But remember, the cost of the flight is just one piece of the travel puzzle. The overall expense of your trip is also heavily influenced by the cost of living in your destination. A cheap flight to a country with sky-high prices for accommodation, food, and activities might not be the budget victory you were hoping for. That’s why it’s essential to consider the bigger picture and factor in the in-country costs when deciding where to go. The beauty of the countries we’ve highlighted is that they generally offer both affordable flights *and* a lower cost of living, providing a truly budget-friendly travel experience from start to finish.

### Stretching Your Dollars Further: In-Country Costs and Making Your Budget Go the Distance

Once you’ve snagged that cheap flight, the real art of budget travel kicks in. How do you make your hard-earned money last as long as possible while still having an amazing time? It’s about being smart, being resourceful, and embracing the local way of life. Think of it as a fun challenge – how much amazingness can you squeeze out of every dollar?

Here are some strategies for keeping your in-country costs low, especially when visiting the **cheapest countries to fly to**:

- **Accommodation:**
    
    
    - **Hostels:** An obvious choice for budget travelers. Hostels offer dormitory-style rooms as well as private rooms, often with shared kitchen facilities and common areas, making it easy to meet other travelers.
    - **Guesthouses and Homestays:** These often offer more authentic experiences and can be very affordable, especially in countries where tourism infrastructure is less developed.
    - **Airbnb:** Look for private rooms or entire apartments outside of the main tourist zones for better value.
    - **Couchsurfing:** A fantastic way to save on accommodation and connect with locals for a truly immersive experience.
    - **Consider Location:** Staying slightly outside of the absolute center of a city or tourist area can significantly reduce accommodation costs, and you can often get around easily using public transport.
- **Food:**
    
    
    - **Eat Like a Local:** Avoid restaurants catering specifically to tourists. Seek out local markets (mercados), street food stalls, and small, family-run restaurants (like *sodas* in Costa Rica or *warungs* in Indonesia). This is often where you'll find the most delicious and authentic food at a fraction of the price.
    - **Cook Your Own Meals:** If your accommodation has kitchen facilities, hit up local grocery stores and cook some of your own meals. This is a great way to save money, especially for breakfast and lunch.
    - **Limit Alcohol Consumption:** Alcohol can be expensive in many countries. Cutting back on alcoholic beverages can significantly reduce your daily spending.
    - **Bring a Reusable Water Bottle:** Save money and reduce plastic waste by refilling your water bottle. Many hostels and guesthouses offer free filtered water.
- **Transportation:**
    
    
    - **Public Transport:** Embrace buses, trains, and local metros. They are almost always the cheapest way to get around, and they offer a great way to experience local life.
    - **Walk:** Explore on foot whenever possible. It’s free, healthy, and a fantastic way to discover hidden gems.
    - **Ride-Sharing Apps:** Popular in many parts of the world and can be a convenient and affordable option, but compare prices with local taxis and public transport.
    - **Negotiate Taxi Fares:** In some countries, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of South America, you may need to negotiate taxi fares before getting in. Agree on the price beforehand to avoid surprises.
- **Activities and Sightseeing:**
    
    
    - **Look for Free Activities:** Many cities offer free walking tours, and you can often explore parks, museums (on certain days), and local neighborhoods for free.
    - **Utilize Student/Senior Discounts:** If applicable, always ask about discounts.
    - **Prioritize:** You don't have to do *everything*. Research the things that genuinely interest you and focus your budget on those experiences.
    - **Book Tours Locally:** Sometimes booking tours and activities once you arrive can be cheaper than booking online in advance, especially if you can negotiate a price.
- **Shopping:**
    
    
    - **Embrace Local Markets:** Great for souvenirs and getting a feel for local crafts, but be prepared to haggle (politely!).
    - **Avoid Tourist Traps:** Shops and stalls right outside major attractions often have inflated prices.
    - **Think About What You Actually Need:** Try not to get caught up in buying too many souvenirs that you might not actually use or need.

Traveling to the **cheapest countries to fly to** is just the first step. By being mindful of your spending once you arrive and utilizing these budget-friendly strategies, you can make your travel dreams a reality without having to live on ramen noodles and air (unless you *want* to, of course!). It’s about being smart, being open to new experiences, and remembering that some of the best travel memories are made in the most unexpected places, often the ones that don't cost a fortune to get to or explore.

Here’s a simple roadmap to help you plan your affordable escape to one of the **cheapest countries to fly to**:

1. **Define Your Travel Style and Interests:** What kind of trip are you looking for? Are you a beach bum, a history buff, an outdoor adventurer, or a city explorer? Knowing your interests will help you narrow down the list of destinations that appeal to you within the budget-friendly options. While many of the countries listed offer a variety of experiences, some might align better with your specific interests than others.
2. **Research Flight Prices from Your Location:** Use flight comparison websites (like Google Flights, Skyscanner, Kayak, etc.) and explore the prices to the cheapest countries to fly to from your departure city. Play around with dates and see how prices fluctuate. Remember those tips about searching for flights mid-week and during shoulder/low seasons! Set up price alerts for the routes you're interested in.
3. **Consider In-Country Costs:** Once you have a few potential destinations with affordable flight options, research the average cost of accommodation, food, transportation, and activities in those countries. Websites like Numbeo can be a good starting point for cost of living comparisons. Factor this into your decision-making process. A slightly more expensive flight to a significantly cheaper country might be a better overall budget option.
4. **Create a Rough Budget:** Based on your research, create a realistic budget for your trip. Break it down into categories like flights, accommodation, food, transportation, activities, and a buffer for unexpected expenses. Having a budget will help you stay on track and make conscious spending decisions.
5. **Book Your Flight and Accommodation Strategically:** Once you've found a good deal on flights and have a sense of accommodation costs, book your major expenses. Remember the sweet spot for booking flights! Consider booking your first few nights of accommodation in advance, but you can often be more flexible with subsequent bookings if you're comfortable.
6. **Plan Your Itinerary (Flexibly):** While it's good to have a general idea of what you want to see and do, try to stay a little flexible, especially if you're aiming for the absolute lowest prices. Sometimes spontaneous opportunities arise, and being able to adjust your plans can lead to amazing experiences – and sometimes even more savings!
7. **Pack Smart and Light:** Avoid checked baggage fees by packing light and opting for carry-on only if possible. Research the baggage allowances for your specific airline.
8. **Learn a Few Basic Phrases:** While English is spoken in many tourist areas, learning a few basic phrases in the local language can go a long way in connecting with locals and potentially even getting a better price at markets!
9. **Be Open-Minded and Embrace the Experience:** Budget travel often means stepping outside of your comfort zone, trying new things, and being open to different ways of doing things. Embrace the local culture, be respectful, and soak it all in. Some of the most memorable travel moments come from unexpected encounters and experiences that you wouldn't find in a guidebook.
10. **Stay Safe and Aware:** Regardless of your budget, always prioritize your safety. Be aware of your surroundings, trust your gut, and take necessary precautions. Research common scams or safety concerns for your destination beforehand.

Planning a trip to the **cheapest countries to fly to** is not about settling for less; it's about being smart, resourceful, and prioritizing experiences over extravagance.
