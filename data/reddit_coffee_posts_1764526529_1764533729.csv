1) Must-visit cafés (cozy spots, good pastries/coffee)
2) Fun things to do indoors + outdoors this time of year
3) How the transit is in winter around Old Montreal
4) Any tips or “things to know” for couples visiting in the cold?

We are based in Hamilton, Ontario

We love exploring, taking photos, trying new cafés, and walking around pretty neighbourhoods. Wouldn’t mind trying out ice skating. 

Would love suggestions from locals or people who’ve done a winter trip! Thank you :)",0,1764533641.0,montreal,0,0.33,False

1pas34o,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1pas34o/yall_need_to_start_actually_doing_nothing/,Y'all need to start actually doing nothing,"I have been making slow, conscious efforts to decrease my internet time for years now. At first it seemed like nothing was happening, but now, I am so much happier and use the internet so much less. But the biggest thing that keeps me getting stuck for way too long scrolling is refusing to actually rest. 

Often times now a days, I'll get stuck on the internet when I feel like I can't do anything else. Scrolling is a great way to stay still and feel like you're resting. But honestly consider, how many times have you gotten up from being online for two hours and felt better for it? How many time has a scroll after work actually been restorative?

It might sound like trading one ""do nothing"" for another but I promise you, it's better for you to stare at a wall for 10 minutes than to scroll for 60. You need to give your body an actual break and not just the idea of a break.

This also could be why these other hobbies don't sound appealing. If you can't think of anything better to do than scrolling, get some tea or coffee or water or whatever and look out the window for 20 minutes. Stare at your wall or a painting. Get bored!!! Boredom is not an enemy, it is a way to rest and get your mind moving towards more interesting and engaging things. If you want to scroll the whole time, that is ok and normal. Just sit there anyways. 

Formal practices of meditation can be helpful but really, it's worth it to just do nothing with no plan, no idea of gaining benefits, no striving. Just sit and get bored.",1,1764533420.0,nosurf,1,1.0,False

# Crashlanding 6

 

""Do you think they will cause a problem?” She asked as she sat down, and he shrugged.

“I don’t think so. What would they do up here? As far as they are concerned, this is just a land of ice and rock.” He replied as he dug into the food, It might look like much, but Kerion was a genius when it came to food. The food fabricator had been hacked so many times that Peter was surprised when it realized it was not a chef.  Unfortunately, it had not learned to make presentable food.

“What? Is this… but?” Kiki had taken a bite into the rice mixture, and Peter just smiled.”

“Yes, it's Mimchi, pretty good, right? The secret is in the spices. Kerion did some amazing work with the food fabricator .”

She looked at the dish, which looked like a heap of minced meat and cut-up potatoes, mashed together with traces of egg and rice. “It's good, I thought it would taste like the normal shit.”

“Naw, Kerion was a chef in the navy, that and a communication officer. He served on a patrol ship. Anyway, he hacked the food fabricator and made some improvements.”

“Like what?” she said, eating quickly. He realized she had no access to the machine and had probably been eating only the ration packs they had lying around.

“wine and beer, among other things. I will put you into the system as a passenger after that, which will give you access to the food.”

“and the beer.”

“And the beer,” he repeated with a smile.

“Good,” she smiled back at him, “by the way, what’s the name of the ship?”

“Peppermint”

“Peppermint? You serious?” She laughed at the idea.

“Yes, Peppermint was a great dog, beloved by all.”

“Oh.” Her smile faded, and he chuckled.

“She died because this idiot gave her peppermint chocolate, we almost tossed him out the airlock.   Instead, we fired him and dropped off at the nearest spacehub. And we renamed the ship after her. Before that, it was Flying Dungeon. That’s probably more what you expected.”

 “Yeah, it was. I’m sorry about peppermint. There are always some idiots around.” She replied, and he nodded.

“Yeah, well, he is gone now. Probably working as a barkeep at that hub. More his style anyway. Worst part. It was his dog, his first dog too. He loved the dog more than anybody. After we got over the shock and realized the guy was just an idiot, we had to think about it.  He tried to jump out through the airlock at lightspeed. That was the real reason we dumped him.”

“Oh, damn.  Yeah, I can see that. So what now? Just wait for the ship to fix itself?”

“First, I want to set up a makeshift antenna and connect to the satellite.  There is still a slim chance that there is something here, like a research station. It could have been on the upper side of the planet when we crashed, or the sensor damage might have given us false reports. So that’s the second part, we need to get the sensors up and perhaps get another drone up to survey the area. Those two droids can be repurposed as mining droids as we need to gather some metals.”

“What do we need to get the communication up and working? And can't we call for help? We can call somebody neutral. That should save that ass of yours.”

He chuckled. “You want to save my ass? What about the rest of me?”

“Maybe, depends on how the rest of you behave. You should shave, by the way. There might be a face under that beard worth saving, too.” She said, and then realized what she had said and closed her mouth, then said. “I will shut up now.”

He just looked at her, then scratched his beard as he looked at her. “Well, since you're quiet, I can tell you what we need. A few microchips, some cable, and a portable receiver. We got the two last, thought the receiver might need an overhaul to see if those Ion blasts fried more than just the chips.” He could see she was struggling not to talk; it looked kind of cute, so he waited a few moments before asking her if she had any ideas.

“Yes, we can go through the other cargo container. It looked big and I think I saw it had some extra protection.”

“Do you know whose cargo that is?”

“No? Wait, why do you care? I thought you were going to run away after this, heck everything in this ship is now yours.”

“That’s not correct.”

“Oh? Who’s going to claim it when the ship takes off, and you fly north? What is on this ship that is now not yours?”

“You.” He said as he finished his cup and stood up. She looked at him, stunned. It took a few moments before she replied.

“Yeah, but I meant things...  We… You can go in and check. There was some tech just on the container that was not affected.”

“That’s an anti-scan shield… shit.. you’re a genius!” He ran towards the cargo hall and ran directly to the cargo hold. She looked surprised, then ran after him.

He was at the door when she caught up. “The anti-scan shields are also known to protect you from Ionblasts. Everything inside should be protected, and I think I saw a few scooters inside. They should have coms and chips we could use.” He opened the door, turned on the lights, and looked around.

Everything was neatly stocked in large boxes, and at the end, he saw six scooters. The expensive ones are made for speed.  Kiko immediately started going over the boxes as if she were looking for something.  He was about to tell her not to steal more than they needed, but looking at her, he realized she was correct and ignored her as he went to the scooters. He was about to pick one up when he noticed the large box next to it. He opened it and found several spare parts, among them several microchips. It would speed up the repair process. He looked through them and found one he could use. It could probably be used to fix some of the small 3-D printers, and they could print as many chips as they needed. He left her in the container as he went to the workshop and started working on the receiver. After an hour, he had both the 3-D printer and receiver up and working.  He then grabbed the suit, cables, and receiver as well as the rifle and headed out.  The outside was as he expected, and he moved through the tunnel he had made and made his way outside.  He stepped out into the sun and saw the first sign of life with his own eyes on the planet.  A birdlike animal sat on a rock about fifty meters away from him. It reminded him of a feather bat. When it saw him, it flew away, and he followed it with his eyes, then moved on. The sun was high up, and what he planned to do would not take long.

He moved up on the glacier, above the ship, and fired a shot through the ice until he made a hole down to the cave below, then pushed the cable down and connected it to the receiver, then moved back down, went through the tunnel, and closed it behind him. It took him about fifteen minutes to connect the cable to the ship. When he returned inside, he was met by a sight to behold. Kiko was no longer in the orange jumpsuit, but instead she was wearing black jeans and a white top under a green Hodie. He didn’t realize he was staring and she blushed.

“What? It’s clothes. I didn’t steal it.”

“You look great. I mean, I got the receiver hooked up.  Let's see what it can show us.” He felt like a fool. He had seen beautiful girls before; hell, he had dated some after. They had both agreed to move on, after all.  But Kiko just woke something he hadn’t felt before, not even with Tina, with Tina, it just happened, they had grown up, and they were just best friends. It was stable and nice, but they had never been madly in love, madly horny, yes. And Kiko's body just turned him on, and he should be scared by it, but he didn’t care. He liked the feeling.

“Oh, thank you. Yeah, let's see what it can show us.” She followed him back to the cockpit and sat down in the navigation chair next to him, and he accessed the screen. The planet came into view as it downloaded all the intel it had gathered. The first thing he checked was their location. It made no sense.  They were one hundred and forty-seven light-years from their destination. It made no sense, they would never be able to travel that long, even with a full tank.

“How?” was all Kiko said, and Peter shrugged.

“I don’t know, maybe we jumped into a wormhole?”

“Can you check that?” She asked, and he went over the flight route, and there it was.  Two light-years away was an unstable wormhole.

“Well, I be damned. We don't think they will find us here.” He brought the wormhole up on the screen. “It looks like this end is stable while the other end is moving around. We can't go back that way. We have to find another route home.”

“Great, well, at least I got good company,” She replied, and he looked at her and bit back his comment. It took more than he expected not to start flirting. He mentally made a note not to drink any alcohol near her. He would say stupid things then.

“Yeah, lucky you. Let's check our little island.” He turned the satellite back to the planet and found their island. Kiko was silent as she watched him. He knew he had said something stupid.

“Here we are.” He said as the image came up on the screen. The island was big with a large glacier in the middle, and the south side was green and lush with clear signs of roads and structures that looked like cities.  North was mostly mountains, and the island had several fjords.  

“Lucky me? Are you not lucky?” She asked, and he looked at her, and before he could think about a good answer, his lips answered.

“No, I’m f’ed. I’m trying not to fall for you, but it's getting harder and harder.”

She looked at him, then smiled and bit her lip. “Yeah, poor you.”

Crashlanding 7

 

He looked back at the screen as more and more images popped up, mostly maps and scans. The tropical areas were filled with settlements of widely different designs. Something was nagging him about it.  Kiko was just looking at him silently, still trying to decide how to reply to his comment.

Peter suddenly stopped and stared at the screen. “What the ….”

“What?” Kiko tore her eyes from him and looked at the screen, not understanding what he was looking at. “What is that?”

“Fossilized tech. and.. wait.. we have to do a complete new rescan.. shit.. we are at a zoo planet!”

“A what?”

He looked at her confused face and just smiled.  “Zoo planet.. I read about this.”

“What's a zoo Plant? Is this whole planet a gigantic zoo?” She looked confused at him as he nodded.

“If I’m right, then yes. About 500,000 years ago, some aliens were all into taking stone-age tribes from different planets and seeding them in different places on one planet. So one continent has humans, one gets Nalos, one gets pig men, and so on.  Spread wide enough that they won't run into each other for a few millennia, and they just watch.  That’s how we found those dinosaurs on Haridop-15. It was a zoo planet.”

“again.. How.. what? They kidnap different species from the Stone Age and drop them on an alien planet? Why?” Kiko was confused as she looked between him and the screen.

Peter got excited as he worked the keyboard, then it came up, and he clapped his hands and pointed at the screen. “Look, Look!”

She looked at the screen at what he was looking at. Peter could not help but grin. Several fossilized bases were spread around the planet. But also something very strange, the oxygen level below the mountain they were at was actually normal, they had landed in a gas pocket.  It was clear the scanners had been damaged and were now slowly being repaired. The new scans showed that the glacier was sitting atop a dormant volcano, and that a gas pocket below was leaking up. It was actually easy to block off and melt some ice, and a cryo bomb would fix it.

“What am I looking at, those ruins? Wait, ohh yeah, that’s not what some stone age people could make. Wait, you landed us in a gas pocket? Why?”

“I asked the AI to find a safe place. I didn’t think that the scanners were wrong. I mean this wrong. Besides, we were crashlanding.”

“So you can fix it, or are we moving the ship?”

“I can, but should we? It’s an extra protection from those pig men.” He replied, and she looked at him.

“You just want to make sure I stay in here with you.” She said, looking into his eyes, and his brain short-circuited for a moment. He hadn’t even thought about it, but now he did. Both of them stuck here together, just the two of them.

“Oh my god! You really want that?” She sat back, looking at him.

“No, no .. that thought didn’t occur to me before you said it. I mean …  you..”

She laughed. “What?  I was just joking with you.  Besides, you can do better than me.”

“no I cant. Besides, we can't. I have to find a way to bring you back without getting killed in the process. Your father probably thinks I’m one of your kidnappers.  Kango will definitely get pissed off if I don’t bring you in and put a bounty on my head. On top of that, you’re a cop. Yeah, you’re a bloody sexy nuke waiting to go off. And you're messing with my mind.”

She looked at him and bit her lip, which only made him look even more attractive. “Sexy nuke waiting to go off?”

“That’s what you got out of this?” He looked at her, and she just smiled.

“That was the most important part. Look, you get me back, I can tell my dad you rescued me the moment you found out what the cargo was. Or…” her voice got a little lower as she tilted her head and started to get dangerously close to him. “I can arrest you. Put you in handcuffs and put you in a cell to interrogate you about all your past crimes. I found my uniform in his cargo. I still got the handcuffs.” Her face was inches from him now, and then she stood up. “You need to shave. Beard reminds me of my ex.. older one, not a nice guy.”

“Oh. Eh yeah. Beard.” he absentmindedly scratched it.  “I normally shave, just forgot.. wait.. why are we talking about my beard.. Do you want me to shave i.. I mean, I can fix the carbon bubble. I just need to close the source of the leak.”  She looked at him, apparently happy about his reaction.

“Yes, it would be nice to be able to leave and take a stroll around without the full body suit. Besides, how are they going to notice that the gas has vanished? They have probably lived with it for as long as they have been here. We will be safe.” She said and tilted her head, looking at him. “ I.. you want coffee? It’s the only one I can access.”

“Yes.. Oh, I will add you to the crew. Just give me a moment.”  He had to do something, his eyes were wandering too much over her body, and she was probably very aware of it.  She turned and left, and he slowly cleared his mind. This was so wrong. He opened the crew list and started to add her to it. Why did she make him behave like this? He wanted her so bad, and it didn’t make any sense.  Maybe it was because they were the only survivors. Still, she needed food. He gave her the right to access the food supplies. Then he noticed the CCTV was back online, turned it on, and saw her in the mess, dancing as she waited for the coffee. She looked happy.  He scratched his beard. Damn, he needed to have a serious discussion with her about this.  Yeah, it must be the shock of survival that was messing with them. Damn, she is sexy, his mind went blank again as he watched her.  When she got the coffee and started making her way back, he quickly turned it off and looked back at the screen.  They needed a better drone. That meant fixing the old ones, and that meant metals. He checked the program; they needed some sink, osmium, and thorium.  He had the satellite start the scan. 

She appeared next to him with a smile and handed him the coffee, and then sat down next to him.  “cheers.”

“Cheers.” He looked at her, and he could swear she was blushing a bit.

“We have to talk.” He said, and she looked at him, her eyes meeting his.

“yes?”

“This.. us.. the flirting.. I.. “ He took a deep breath, focused, and continued. “Don’t you think it's strange?  I mean, if you saw me in a club, you would never look twice at me.  I’m just a regular guy.”

Her face went from happy to a short moment of panic, then almost panic. “No, don't say that. Well, with that beard, maybe. But you're not bad looking, and you are the first guy I have met in a long time who is nice to me because of me, not my dad. Besides, it feels right. You make me believe we will get out of this.”

“But you don’t know me, and I am worried about your dad. Hell, I’m worried about two mob bosses. And it's weird that right now all I want to do is kiss you. You make me … Im worried this is just because we survived alone. I doubt it would be the same if the whole crew survived.”

“Kiss me?” She smiled a little and then got upset. “Well, doh. I would still be in the cargo hold. Stuck in the bubble.”

“Well, but if you had been let out to eat, then I don’t think you would choose me even then. I’m simply the only one around, and you see me as some rescuing knight.”

“No, no, you're not.. “she looked at him a little desperately. “You’re my type.”

“How do you know?” He felt bad about it. She was definitely his type; he would have noticed her through any crowd.

“You feel safe. Okey.” She was standing now. “And I want you to kiss me!”

He stood up. “You want me to kiss you? Even aft..” She kissed him, and he could not hold back. When the kiss broke, she smiled triumphantly.

“See! You want to kiss me, too!  Now go shave, or I won't kiss you again. And then you will tell me everything you know about Zoo worlds.”",1,1764533338.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

I’m a 37-year-old woman living in Toronto for the past seven years previously I’ve lived in cities like London, England, and I go out a lot around downtown Toronto. I go to restaurants, malls, and all big and small shops.  Over the last few years I have seen the customer service provided at all types of shops, restaurants coffee places go from bad to worse. I have limited my expectations from how I’m treated when I am at these places so much so that I don’t even expect a barista to smile when handing me my order, but as a customer, I am always giving them the benefit of the doubt telling myself that I don’t know what type of customers they have been dealing with or how their day has been going. As a customer, I try to be as nice as possible, and I know for a fact that I’ve never been rude to one person at any place that I’ve been to. Recently the bad behaviour and rudeness of the customer service people has gotten so bad that I was bound to make this post for the first time in my life. For anyone reading this who works on customer facing jobs, I just want them to know that maybe the interaction that a customer is having with you is the only human interaction they’re having in their entire day and it affects them just how it affects you . Yes you have been dealing with a lot of customers the whole day, maybe you are tired, but kindness goes a long way on both sides. If you expect a customer to be kind to you or at least not be rude to you unnecessarily you should also make sure that you’re not being unnecessarily rude to a person who’s asking you for help.

i'm in my cs lecture right, same boring friday, same prof mumbling sum about graphs like he's narrating a nature documentary. i'm sitting next to my friend (we always sit together so we can suffer in sync). we're both straight males btw. this will be important later.

so anyway, at some point he leans over to tell me something. i think it was about how the prof misspelled ""algorithm"" for the third time. and idk something in my brain just misfired. like a neuron slipped on a banana peel. instead of turning my head like a normal functioning human student, i just... kinda... leaned in? and bro. BRO. he leaned in too.

i swear to god for half a second we were like those awkward romance characters who bump into each other in hallways except this was in Bahen and smelled like 100 kids who hadn't showered in weeks. next thing i know, our faces are way too close, and then. yeah. it happens. we kissed. in lecture. during a live demonstration of tree traversals. yeah.

the worst part? it wasn't even bad. like i expected to flinch or something but nah. it was kinda nice??? not emotionally, but like, technically speaking, it was a solid kiss. a B+ at least. maybe A- if he didn't have iced coffee breath.

the moment we pulled back we both made that ""no words. no thoughts. never happened."" face. like immediate agreement. treaty signed. the geneva convention of bros.

but then this girl behind us straight up gasped like she just saw plot twist in a kdrama. my TA looked over and did that disappointed blink thing. SOMEONE COUGHED IN JUDGMENT. one guy wrote it down in his notes like it was part of the lecture.

anyway we haven't talked about it since. he just sent me a meme afterwards like nothing happened. i don't know what that means. i don't think he knows what that means.

all i know is that my first kiss is now tied to a cs lecture, and i'm gonna have to carry that shame forever.

1parx3j,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1parx3j,"I just realised, that maybe, we have the wrong perspective.","I’m a 20M guy, here in Baner. I was very alone at first cause it was just me, and my dog living in a bungalow. Parents and family is in Mumbai.

I had made so many, almost desperate posts on punemeetups and r/pune, saying that I’m alone and if anybody is willing just to have a cup of coffee or something. I had distractions like PS5 or my dog Rambo but it would just hit me in the end.

After almost 3 years of living alone it finally dawned on me. The one thing, we never succumb enough. “No. One. Cares.”

As I realised that if I’m alone, I don’t have anybody to judge me, then why don’t I do whatever I want? I went to restaurants alone, I went cafe hopping alone, movies, shopping, whatever. Even went on a Solo Trip to Ladakh where I rode a RE for 1400kms. That was the only good thing I suppose, the rest, ruined me. I thought I would find peace with solitude, but only of aspects that didn’t matter much.

Then I realised one of the best things I could’ve ever done. We dedicate our lives, our most valuable time towards people we love and making their life better. Why not for ourselves? We don’t have no barriers to stop/slow down from. For us to be a better version of someone else’s vision of a friend or anything else, you gotta be a better version of yourself too. Every single day we set the limit, only to exceed, and excel beyond.

So I got my fat ass off of the sofa, which is literally the coziest place of my life, started running, hitting the gym, swim if I can, ALL ALONE. Today the type of man I am, I regret not working on it earlier. 

I know that I still gotta do better, only a matter of time now, but as you can see how I was before in the first pic and how I am now in the second one, I personally, do consider it a win. The most personal, biggest and the most beautiful one for myself.

Here’s my message to the introverted Punekars/whomever it shall concern,

Please, stop being hard on yourself in a way that’ll just destroy you, be hard on life, as it’ll only take you ahead. Surely living alone is peaceful, never found peace better than this, but take it to your advantage and turn it into the chapters of wisdom. 

Take Care my fellow introverts, always here to be your friend.

The choirs of bugs singing durges in the dark night always soothed my soul in the outpost. Though I knew if I saw those hand-sized mosquitos and beetles the size of footballs I wouldn't feel so relaxed. There's a stick bug the length of a mini-golf putter that liked to hang out by my window. Hot coffee was a cold comfort, of course, but I needed to stay awake. Maybe the reminder of the dangers of this time-period would have kept me agitated enough. 

It was not a complicated job, really, just keep my eyes on the green lights on the grid and any incoming calls from outposts and travelers. VECTOR paid me well enough to do it, and it kept the community safe. My fellow watchdog Kimber walked in, groggy and frog throated with a fleece blanket caped over his shoulders. 

""Ya need more quinine?"" I asked him.

He nodded, ""Also bored. Thought I needed to walk a bit. God, I hate these stone-age diseases."" He went to the kitchen to make himself another cup of medicine.

""Cretateous."" I said, being pedantic.

He glared at me and took a sip. 

An orange light on the line started flashing, I took it, talking into my earpiece. ""This is Outpost Q4-03, identity.""

A tinny male voice picks up on the other side. ""This is Arman Saab of the Rowman Mining Company, requesting safe passage into Cumberland County, code 60578.""

I checked the incoming logs and found ROWMAN 60578 cleared by Central Command. ""Your request is granted, drive safely."" 

""Thank you, over and out."" He shut down the line. 

I looked out through the wrap-around windows toward the southeast where the imaginary, 575 square mile line  called ""Cumberland County"" would be. I never saw one up close before but those coal mining platforms are a sight to behold. A small, shambling factory-city resting on a platform about four hectares in size, slowly driven on wheels about six stories tall. Maybe when it came through the mountain pass, I thought, I could see it. 

As I looked out, a large moth thumped onto the glass right by my face. Kimber was laughing as I jumped back with a yelp. The thing looked like a fuzzy dress shirt. 

""It usually takes about a year to get used to them."" Kimber said with toothy grin.

I looked back, ""They're still just as freaky after 6 months, I don't know if I'll ever get 'used to them.'"" 

He shrugged and sat in the recliner, ""Maybe you just need some more exposure. You know, maybe some action in the field. That's what I did.""

""If I wanted a dirty job, I would've stayed in 2135."" I said. 

He shook his head. ""You're a young guy, you should try to get your hands a bit filthy before taking something a bit more comfy."" He reclined all the way back and stroked his remaining white hair with his large hands.

""An accountant makes for a poor landfill recycler."" I said back. I didn't hear anything back, thinking I shut him up, but he actually fell asleep. Whatever this strain of malaria is it isn't a joke, not deadly but it certainly knocks you out and can't exactly be prevented, you just have to endure it. I suspected I'll come down with it in a day or two so our third help will be coming by sunrise tomorrow. 

I didn't hate Kimber but he was certainly old fashioned, maybe a bit entitled since he endured the Second Great Reset of 2090. I might have been, too, in his position. He just won't accept that the future comes after the young much more than the old. I'm lucky that VECTOR was able to send people to this time and needs jobs that don't require shovels and rakes. Hell, it's a job, which is also scarce in the future. The past is truly the land of opportunity. 

A few hours pass and I received another call. ""This is Outpost Q4-03, identity.""

""Outpost Q4-03, this is Blake with VECTOR, ID B709D4. I'm here as the emergency member.""

Her tenor voice was stern yet sweet. I replied back, ""This is Paleto, ID G610E5. I see you're still about an hour out. Any difficulties?""

""None so far. It doesn't look like the storm last night affected the roads too much. I should arrive with the drop-off team by 606 hours.""

""Affirmative. You're clear. Over and out."" I closed the line. 

I realized how little time I had before she would arrive, so I started cleaning up the outpost, and this probably woke Kimber up. 

""Why the cleaning?"" He grumbled. 

""The third arrival's coming soon, I thought I should tidy up the place. The name's Blake."" I said. 

""Aw damn, they sent a woman didn't they."" He covered his eyes up.

""I didn't say anything about her being a woman."" I said. 

""A young man doesn't clean up unless they're seeing a girl."" He said, falling back into sleep. 

""There's nothing wrong with cleaning, and there's certainly nothing wrong with a woman watchdog."" I replied.

""Well,"" he said on the doorstep of sleep, ""mind yourself... want no drama..."" 

I threw away the tissues, vacuumed the floors, scrubbed the smudges on the kitchen counters, wiped the coffee stains on the console desks, reordered the furniture in the workspace and the lounge, and made sure the third bedroom was set and ready. I suddenly felt childish with how excited I was, but it had also been well over a month since I saw someone of the opposite sex. 

I saw on the security cameras a large, 8-person ATV was pulling in, VECTOR written along the side. On the top was a ball turret, as well as a turret on the back. It drove onto the platform and called in. 

""This is Outpost Q4-03, identity."" I said. 

The driver answered, ""This is ATV-087 codename Snowden here to deliver Blake."" 

""We recieve you. Prepare for transfer."" I answered back. 

A loud beeping blared as the platform was raised about 15 feet into the air, leading up to a boarding bridge. The computer figured out how to attach itself to the vehicle. From the security camera, I could see a blurry shadow leave the side of the ATV and get into the bridge. As she entered the tower, I heard over the radio, ""Transfer complete.""

""Copy that. Prepare for departure."" The bridge was disconnected and the beeping started again, lowering the platform back to the ground. The vehicle backed up and drove up back to the trail. 

I could hear the elevator humming as it climbed up to the observation level. I got up to greet her, my heart fluttering a bit. In my head I was trying to guess what she might look like based on her voice. If she had a tenor, maybe she was a ginger or blonde, possibly skinny? I didn't have much time to think about it because she rushed out as soon as the doors opened.

She stopped herself just short of running into me. ""Oh! Gosh, I'm sorry.""

""No I'm sorry,"" I said trying to be polite.

""So are you Kimber? No, Kimber is sick, you're Paleto."" She looked inquisitively.

""Yes, I'm Paleto, John Paleto."" I said, extending my hand. 

""Pleased to meet you, I'm Kathleen Blake. Gosh, I hate using all that ID talk, don't you?"" She said, rapidly shaking my hand with a big smile. 

I was not prepared to meet someone who was so charmingly nerdy. ""Yeah, it's annoying. Well, your quarters are downstairs, room 3, it should all be in order."" 

""Oh yes, thank goodness, I need a nap, it's impossible to sleep in those terrible things. Ugh."" She headed toward the door but suddenly turned right around, ""Oh but wait, you probably want the rest, right? You must've been awake for, what, 48 hours?"" 

""I'm fine and perfectly caffinated."" I said raising my hands. ""You're our guest, I'd rather you be rested.""

""Well thank you! To be honest, I don't think I've slept the last few days, either."" She giggled. ""Ah, all the little hats they make me wear. Well, see you in, like, 3 hours.""

""Sure."" I said as she went downstairs to quarters. I realized I just said *sure* instead of something more polite to a stranger, a lady at that, and I knocked my head a few times. 

Kimber got up, realizing he had gone unnoticed. ""Well I should get proper rest, too, and stay out of Kay's sight.""

""You know her?"" I asked. 

He turned his hand over a few times, ""She's known to take a lot of different positions at the company, sort of a paratrooper jack of all trades, you know what I mean?"" 

""No."" 

""Well, you can get to know her better soon. Stay healthy, Jack."" He lumbered down to quarters. 

About half an hour passed as I was looking at the beautiful jungle morning, the whole valley blanketed with mist as streaks of sunlight broke through. I was finally feeling it, the dreadful comfort of dozing in and out. I was hoping ""Kay"" would come soon but I also didn't have much to do, either. Even these office chairs can be so soothing to sit in while this sleepy.

But one of the security cameras started flashing red. I jerked up and saw on the footage about 8 turkey-looking things on the feed. They were inspecting the emergency ladder on the side of the tower. Though it was about 8 feet off the ground, they were sizing it up. They could leap for it, sure, but it would take an effort. 

I waited to see what they'd do as per protocol. If they start jumping for the ladder, that's when you shock them. They need to be hurt, not just scared. If they're only scared they will most certainly come back, but if one of them is hurt or killed they will more likely move on. I had my hand over the button, waiting to see what they'd do. 

One of them lept, didn't get close. Another one tried, didn't make it. But there was a third one, larger with brighter colors, waiting its turn. It lept, grabbed hold of the lower bar, and I let my finger down. 

A loud blare and a red light went off, the guy hanging on started shaking violently. The rest of them scattered into the brush as fast as possible as their comrade fell down unmoving to the ground. I stared at it as little black plumes rose from it, lightly cooked from 9000 volts. But I was startled when suddenly the thing got up again, looked around confused, looked at the ladder, screeched at it, and went to join the rest of the pack.

1parh5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/ecommercemarketing/comments/1parh5j/most_stores_obsess_over_pdp_upsells_and_drawers/,"Most stores obsess over PDP upsells and drawers, but skip the cart page","I’ve noticed a pattern across a lot of Shopify stores: 

Product pages are well optimised and contain upsells, cart drawers are widely used with and w/out upsells… but the classic cart pages seem empty.

Yes, more shops now use drawers on Shopify instead of the full cart, and some try to hide the cart page completely, but in most stores it’s still accessible (at least on shopify), and it’s mostly  a ghost town, and feels like a missed surface.

IMO A simple add-on there could go a long way over time, eg:
- A basic upsell like gift wrap, priority packing or so
- A small accessory that clearly pairs with what’s already in cart (cleaner, refills, matching item, coffee + chocolate, etc etc)

If the offer is targeted well, it should be quite tempting?

And if there is an upsell in cart page on some stores, it’s usually very generic, static carousel or “recently viewed” items or so, which I don’t believe convert that well.

If you an online retailer (or work with eComm brands in consulting/marketing space), I’m curious:
- Do you actually treat it as a serious upsell surface?
- Or is everything happening in the cart drawer and on PDPs and you deliberately ignore the cart page?

I'm not too familiar with WooCommerce and other ecomm shop infra, but I imagine it would be the same there too.

You know that slight nagging feeling when you tap your card to pay? I used to shrug it off, thinking digital pickpocketing was something that happened to other people. That changed after a chat with my cousin, a cybersecurity analyst, who looked in my wallet and asked why I was carrying my cards ""naked."" He handed me a CardArmor RFID sleeve and said, ""Stop making it easy for them.""

It was a wake-up call. I realised I was casually waving my debit card, credit card, and passport around in a crowded train or coffee shop, completely unaware that someone with a hidden scanner could be harvesting my details from feet away.

CardArmor isn't just a sleek sleeve—it's a simple, essential shield. It's made from a proprietary material that blocks electromagnetic fields, creating a Faraday cage that stops scanners from reading your chip or skimming the data from your card's magnetic stripe. The peace of mind is immediate. Now, my cards are safe from digital theft, whether I'm commuting, travelling, or just out for the day.

Here’s what other security-conscious users are saying:

""I travel frequently for work, and my passport has an RFID chip. Using the CardArmor sleeve means I don't have to worry about someone scanning my personal data in an airport queue."" – James, 41, Management Consultant

""As someone who had their card details skimmed before, this is a no-brainer. It's the simplest and most effective form of protection I own."" – Chloe, 29, Project Manager

# What Real Users Are Saying About CardArmor RFID

After I started using them, I recommended CardArmor to friends and family. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive:

**What People Appreciate:**

* **""It's so slim** – I don't even notice it in my wallet, but I notice the peace of mind.""
* **""The quality is solid** – it hasn't frayed or worn out after months of use.""
* **""It works with everything** – my debit card, credit card, and even my office access card.""
* **""Finally, a security product that requires zero setup.** You just slip your card in and forget about it.""

**A Few Practical Notes:**

* ""You need one for each card you want to protect, but they're affordable.""
* ""Remember to take the card out of the sleeve when you need to make a contactless payment.""
* ""It's a small habit change for a huge security upgrade.""

# Why This Matters More Than Ever

Contactless payments are convenient, but that convenience comes with a vulnerability. Skimming devices are cheap, small, and can be easily concealed in a bag or jacket. They don't need to touch your wallet to steal your information. CardArmor is a physical barrier to this invisible threat.

**A Quick Tip:** For those interested, I've shared a link to the official CardArmor website in the comments. It's the only way to guarantee you're getting the genuine, tested product with the proper shielding technology. Third-party sellers often offer inferior copies that don't provide the same level of protection.

A buddy of mine said some good things about Reddit, so I figured I’d give it a shot! I've been traveling across the country (working remotely) and have been having a blast. It’s definitely had its high and lows, and I've met a bunch of different folks along the way -- but finding those lasting connections is obviously a little tough with this lifestyle. Hence why I'm here on Reddit. I put the location tag as US, since I'm not really restricted on location.

Here's a bit about me:

* I'm 40, male, and work in the medical field.
* I’ve been traveling full-time since last summer. I started on the east coast (NE), made my way through the Ozarks, and now I’m slowly meandering west.
* I love cooking, especially when I can do it outside. My go-to is a cast-iron skillet breakfast hash with whatever’s on hand -- potatoes, eggs, peppers. Hot sauce is a must, let's be real, haha.
* I'm a big reader. Right now it’s a mix of Steinbeck, some travel essays, and a book on neuroscience I like to pretend I understand.
* I used to be a runner, but now I’m more of a ""slow hiker who stops for photos and snacks"" if you get what I mean.
* I grew up near the ocean. I'm not afraid to laugh at myself, like the time I accidentally locked my keys (and shoes) inside the van at a rest stop in the middle of nowhere. Hey, at least it made for a fun story, right?
* I’m pretty low-key. I'm content with campfires, podcasts, stargazing, and the occasional dive bar conversation with strangers.
* I value good communication and people who can sit comfortably in both silence and long talks.
* My playlists jump from indie folk to old soul to 90s hip-hop, depending on the mood.
* I try to practice gratitude, even on WiFi-free days.

What I'm Looking For:

* Someone grounded, kind, and emotionally intelligent.
* someone who’s curious about the world, loves learning, and doesn’t mind taking the scenic route once in a while.
* I’m drawn to folks who can find beauty in simple things like a good cup of good coffee, a quiet morning - stuff like that.
* You don’t have to be a traveler (though that’s always a bonus), just open-minded, thoughtful, and looking to connect

1par8z6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flipping/comments/1par8z6/i_was_thinking_that_i_need_a_perfect_business/,I was thinking that I need a perfect business idea but I just needed to do start doing anything,"**TL;DR:**  
I thought I needed the perfect business idea to start making extra money.  
Turns out I just needed to start *doing anything* for my brain to finally kick in.  
If you struggle with ideas just sell something today. Your brain will catch up.



I am broke, I’ve had a poor men mentality my whole life and I want to change it really bad.  
I’m 30, I work 9-5, paycheck to paycheck. The job is ok, but not great - the sweet spot of not changing anything - that's why I realised I have to change it because I know I will regret not doing it as I regret doing nothing in my twenties. 

I wrote down what I have now. I was constantly changing jobs and countries, never really sticking to anything and quitting every time I faced challenges.

I’ve had a couple business or side hustle ideas but my brain just refused to believe that I could make any money because it seemed like everyone is doing this and that and I won’t make any money so I continued thinking about the perfect idea. Like once it comes - everything will change.

The moment came when I was binge watching anime (Attack on Titan) and one of the characters said “I’m thinking too much, I just need to act” and it struck me. The same day I realised that I know enough, I just need to convince myself that I can make at least 1 dollar and multiply this.

I just need to do it fast, like right now. So I started thinking like crazy about what is the easiest way to make any money like now, with no budget. So I just sold my old pair of Levi’s jeans and my old typewriter on Vinted (Kind of like Ebay if you are from the US) The next thing I know - my brain was constantly thinking about what else I can sell. Not fancy, not cool or trendy but what would work right now. I made 50$ in one day, what else am I missing that someone needs, and I could sell? My brain started shifting to the right direction.

It’s Christmas time, gifts and stuff and I always struggled to buy presents for myself. So I thought that my motivation would be to buy something cool for me, something that I wanted for so long but coudln’t just afford. Not too expensive to demotivate me in the beginning. Something that I could make money like in a month just before Christmas and I realised that I want a new Ipad, the cheapest one, with Apple pencil, to make notes, to read, I thought that would be really useful and productive. So the goal was set, what’s next? 

Gurus always tell - sell what you know. Because I’m broke I knew thrift stores and I knew how to find nice items so this was my very first idea and I went there. I had only 50$. I bought two pairs of leather shoes, some fancy ones and Dr Martens.

I saw the quality and also I checked that people actually bought these items so I knew there was a margin. One pair was 25$ and Martins were 15$. I hoped to profit at least 20$ in each. Also I found some Carhartt pants and a Dickies boiler suit. I knew these brands are in demand right now so I believed I definitely could sell them - spoiler - not as great as I thought although there was some profit. 

The first few days I realised I spend too much time on sourcing items and margins are too low, I tried to count how many items I’d need to sell and it actually showed that in one month I can get to my goal but it was draining for me. (Thanks to my Data Analyst skills I knew some excel basics so I ended up creating a spreadsheet to track what I buy and how much I make, because I knew I need to focus on items that bring the most and take the least of my time to sell)

So I also started sourcing through Facebook marketplace as I know a lot of people sell stuff and a lot of people flip it for profit. At some point I noticed Apple watch SE 2 for 80$ in a really good condition and I just believed that I could do on this more than on some shoes so I just sent a message and the same evening after work I was running to the car park under the rain knowing that I will be driving like an hour to collect it but it felt so good, it felt like I’m DOING something and not THINKING about it.

The watch was in a really good condition and I sold it the very next day with 30$ profit and I still believe I undersold it and I could ask for way more but these things come with experience.

So I had 130$ - the next thing I know I’m driving to pick up an Iphone and that’s where the wheel had spinned me into the phone flipping.

So here I am. One week later and I can afford to buy an Ipad that I was dreaming about but I think about completely different things - I can’t stop thinking about how to make more money. I’m crazy sourcing Facebook finding good undervalued phones and selling them with 50-100$ profit and my goals have changed. 

One day I was sitting in the coffee shop working with my old laptop, trying to find phones. At this point with that spreadsheet that I made to track all my phones and all my deals to understand which phone sells better, which one takes the longest to sell and to avoid in future, I grade them to understand what’s the most valuable and has the biggest margin (You’d be surprised but the ones in the perfect condition - they are the most expensive and people understand their value so my sweet spot is 11-13 Pro Max models that were smashed and abused but still they hold value on the second hand market due to their capacity and these things I wouldn’t be able to know if I wasn’t tracking what I was doing - so always track your sales.

So I was working with my old laptop and the battery just died and I realised what I need is a new laptop, the one I’ve always dreamed of but I’ve always convinced myself it’s too expensive for me - MacBook,the new one. Not some used laggy laptop. I’ve always said to myself that - I don’t need Macbook, that;s too expensive for me and there is no point in buying it but this time it’s been two weeks since I started actually doing something and my money were in the product I was selling (I know that sounds serious and someone could say it’s just a side hustle and there is no real product or no real business - shut them up, you are doing while they are talking, ignore everyone who’s not encouraging you. I am lucky enough that my partner is very supportive and we source phones together. Surround yourself with people who are likeminded and understand the value in action. 

So I got a new goal but also I knew it's a 1000$ for a laptop and I wanted to continue so I don’t want to spend all I have - I want to have a budget to continue. I have more ideas because the most important thing of this story is not a success story - it is the realisation of what comes next when you actually start doing something. 

There is no perfect plan or a perfect business - there is only action that you can do right now to make the very first dollar, and then another one and another one. It shifts your brain and gives you more ideas that you could have imagined. I was staying in shower when thinking about what I can do next and I realised that I could tell this story and give some value for free and also I can sell something - I can teach others what I know and how I’ve done it because first - I’m not planning to flip phones my whole life, it’s just a first step that I was needed to wake up and start my brain spinning and coming up with ideas and the second - there is a huge market and everyone can get their piece so I’m not bothered telling how I’ve made this first and the most important 100$.

It’s not an overnight success story that I quit my 9-5 job, created a business and now making millions, it’s a story about the very first steps that taught me what is important - action comes first, perfection comes after.

1par85d,https://i.redd.it/ehilet1o5g4g1.jpeg,Peaks / Troughs,"The night the big swell hit would puncture through dreams with the thunder of the incoming waves broken-open on the reef, and when morning broke it was if the whole ocean, too, were a just a single wave which had spilled past it's boundaries deep into the shore, broken-open into a super-saturated mist of salt-water that soaked into every dry pore. 

Black coffee drunk in the dark - to claim to the honor of being first out at first light and to paddle through the dawning sun as it's beams shattered into the ocean of golden liquid light before you now. 

And pushing through, ducking under, you only make it out if She lets you, a grace on a day such as this day denied to many, but by Her grace, today, you slip through.

And breathless now, you now know you only have one take, as the dark masses pile up, relentlessly, and obligates you to paddle further and further into the horizon - further drawing down your energy. You've never been this far out before. And you're out here utterly alone.

But when the right one comes (you just know - you feel it when you see it) a clarity and stillness of mind punctures all doubt, shatters all analysis, and breaks open a perfect silence. You spin around, thoughtlessly, perfectly integrated into this moment of this wave, now, on the surface of this unfathomable ocean. And in this moment, at the top of this peak, you stand up and drop into this transience that might as well be timeless, and dissolve perfectly into the wave, into the ocean, and you know a perfect transcendence. 

11-time World Champion surfer Kelly Slater once said, ""I was watching a dog chase a ball over and over again, and be perfectly happy, and I was like, why can't we do that? And then I realized that's exactly what we do with surfing. We catch a wave and then immediately go back to another.""

But, crucially, he left this part unsaid: are we happy? I reckon he intuitively knew it couldn't be stated as it's so obviously false. You can forgive Kelly, though, as he is a biased commentator whose title of ""World Champion"" and wealth were ordained by multinational clothing conglomerates under the brands Quiksilver and Billabong whom sell the ""surfing lifestyle"" in the form of clothing to both Californians and Ohians alike. He's in the game too deep to be honest. 

But if you spend enough time on the beach you see the trough in between every peak. You see it in the missing teeth of the once semi-pro athletes who now spend their time on the beach drinking tequila and chasing the vapor-trails of methamphetamine peaks - I have known quite a few. You see it, too, in the line-up - in the anger and belligerence of fighting over some peaks to claim as our own, our clarity and stillness and silence - our peace - confused, as if it had something to do with the waves. 

Alright, to be honest, I'm all out of poetry by this point in this post, so I'll just say it plainly: what we're after, us surfers (seekers by another name), isn't the peak, but simply the clarity, stillness and silence of mind, in other words: peace - which can be appreciated by means independent of conditions. And then you're no longer enslaved to conditions - and you're always surfing, and this is always the Wave and you are the Ocean. Sometimes that Ocean happens to look like sitting in a chair, looking at the wall - a transcendence which is unlikely to sell many T-shirts.

1par5ed,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1par5ed/the_tuscan_game/,The Tuscan Game,"The Tuscan villa was a postcard come to life, a sprawling stone residence nestled among rolling hills thick with cypress trees and the silvery-green olive groves. For Tom and Linda Patterson, a middle school teacher and an office manager, and their friends Mark and Jennifer Walsh, a retail manager and a nurse, it was supposed to be a three-day escape from the relentless gray of a city winter. They had found the listing online, a price so low it felt like a mistake, but the allure of the photos had been impossible to resist. Their first day was a blissful haze exploring the Tuscan countryside, followed by wine and cheese on the villa’s terrace as the sun set.

They had planned to do the same on their second day, but while the others were enjoying coffee in the sun-drenched cortile, Linda had decided to explore the biblioteca. It was a dark, cool room, smelling of old paper and leather, with floor-to-ceiling shelves crammed with books. She ran her fingers along the spines, pulling down a few at random.

One that caught her eye was a leather-bound journal. She flipped it open to find its pages were filled with strange, hand-drawn symbols, frantic, handwritten notes in Italian, and a scribbled phrase: 'specchio in Croazia'—a mirror in Croatia. Tucked between the final pages was a thick, cream-colored envelope. Her heart gave a little flutter. She brought the journal and the envelope out to the cortile where the others were relaxing.

“Look what I found,” she said, her voice a hushed whisper. She showed them the journal, the strange symbols, and the notes about Croatia. Then she presented the envelope.

It was sealed not with glue but with a dollop of deep crimson wax, bearing a crest that looked like a stylized labyrinth. There was no name on it.

“Maybe it’s for a previous guest,” Tom, ever the pragmatist, suggested. “We probably shouldn’t open it.”

“Or maybe it’s for us, we are guests after all,” Mark countered, a familiar glint in his eye. He loved a good mystery. “The owner, Julian, seems like an eccentric guy. Maybe this is part of the experience. An adventure.”

They debated for a few minutes, the allure of the unknown warring with their better judgment. It was Mark’s argument that won. ""Come on, guys, we're on vacation, after all. And what is a vacation without a little adventure?"" With a shared look of conspiratorial excitement, Jennifer carefully broke the seal. Inside, the elegant, looping calligraphy announced THE GAME. The note read:

Welcome, fortunate guests, to a game of wits and will. This villa is more than stone and mortar; it is a puzzle box of history and secrets. For those with clever minds and adventurous hearts, a prize of untold value awaits. Follow the path we have laid and solve the riddles to reveal the ultimate prize.

A wave of excitement washed over them.

“A puzzle!” Jennifer said, her eyes alight. “But what about our plans?” Tom asked, ever the voice of reason. “We were going to drive to Siena today. We only have one full day left.”

“Siena will still be there tomorrow,” Mark said, already caught up in the fantasy. “How often do you get a chance to do something like this? We have to do it.”

Linda and Jennifer both eagerly agreed; the lure of the game was far stronger than any generic tourist plans. Their plans to see Tuscany forgotten, they turned their attention to the first clue, written on the same heavy cardstock:

“In the cantina deep, a great heart waits. Pull it down and open the gates.”

“The cantina… that's the basement, I think,” Tom said. They searched the front entryway and found the door to the cantina tucked away beneath the main staircase, a heavy oak door with an ancient iron ring. The hinges creaked open, releasing a gust of cool, musty air. The staircase was steep and winding, stretching out of sight into the darkness below. Linda pointed to the wall just next to the door, ""Look, a torch! Does anyone have a lighter?"" After a round of ""No's"" from the group, a frantic search ensued. A short while later, they had regathered at the stairwell, matchbook in hand. Linda struck a match and lit the torch, bathing the staircase in dancing light.

The air below was thick and tasted of iron. The cantina was a cavern of arched stone ceilings, and the light from the flames reflected by the thin film of moisture on the floor. In the center of the room was the water wheel, a modest-sized machine of stone, wood, and rusted iron. A complex system of pipes and conduits snaked from it, disappearing into the stone walls. Embedded in the wall beside it, was a lever. Mark, ever the man of action, grabbed it and pulled. The lever didn’t budge; it was rusted shut. “Give me a hand,” he motioned for Tom to join him; together, they put their weight into it.

With a deep, protesting clunk, the lever moved down, and the great wheel began to turn. Water that had been diverted from some unseen underground spring began to rush through the channels, and the great wheel began to turn, its rhythmic groaning filling the air. As it moved, one of the iron pipes leading out of the cantina began to glow slightly blue. Where the pipe met the wall, a small stone panel slid away, revealing the number ‘7’ deeply carved into the wall. Tucked into the new cavity was the second clue.

“Where the first pipe ends, a new task starts. Divert the flow to play its part.”

They followed the glowing pipe out of the cantina, the hum a tangible presence beneath their feet. It led them across the sun-drenched lawn, past a garden of fragrant lavender bushes, to a small, windowless pump house built of the same stone as the villa. Inside, the air was hot and smelled of oil and rust. The pipe connected to a complex junction of three large, cast-iron valves, their wheels painted in faded primary colors.

A water-stained diagram on the wall showed they needed to be turned in a specific sequence. “Okay, ready?” Jennifer asked, her finger tracing the faded lines. “Mark, red valve, half-turn clockwise. Tom, blue valve, a full turn the other way. We have to do it at the same time.” The wheels were stiff, but moved with a concerted effort. Mark took one, Tom the other. “On three,” Mark grunted. “One… two… THREE!” The men put their shoulders into it, the old metal screaming in protest. “It’s moving!” Tom said through gritted teeth. With a final, coordinated turn, they heard a loud whoosh of pressurized air, and a powerful jet of water erupted from the dormant, moss-covered fountain in the cortile. On the main pressure gauge, a beautiful piece of antique brass and glass, the needle swung up and stopped on a single, red-painted number: ‘3’. A second iron pipe, leading from the pump house to the main villa, began to glow blue. This time, they found the third clue tucked beneath the diagram.

“Find four rods of copper bright. In the sala grande, connect the light.”

A quick search of the pump house revealed four decorative copper rods tarnished with age. They followed the glowing pipe to where it entered the sala grande of the main house. The hall was magnificent, with a soaring ceiling that let in shafts of afternoon light and a beautiful marble floor that echoed their footsteps. The pipe ended at an ornate bronze panel on the wall, a masterpiece of art nouveau metalwork depicting intertwined vines and flowers, and a glowing sun with four empty rays.

“Connect the light…” Jennifer mused, sliding the first rod into place. It clicked in with a satisfying weight. When the last rod was seated, all four began to glow with a faint, blue light. In the center of the bronze panel, a single digit, ‘9’, is illuminated with the same blue light. The energy seemed to flow from the rods into a final, thick conduit that ran out of the hall, across the cotile, and ended at the fienile, which was locked by a modern security keypad lock.

The fourth and final clue was a set of four riddles engraved on the bronze panel. “Okay, team, let’s huddle up,” Jennifer said, her voice echoing slightly in the vast hall. She pointed to the first riddle engraved on the panel. “‘I hold the world’s wisdom, but I am not alive. My face is plain, but my colored backs hold the key you seek.’”

“The journal?” Mark suggested jokingly, “The books,” Tom said suddenly. “The books in the biblioteca. They have colored backs. Tons of them. That’s the world’s wisdom.”

“He’s right,” Tom agreed. “It’s gotta be the library.”

“Okay, one down,” Mark said, moving to the second riddle. “‘I am an empty stage until the clock strikes. My purpose is to share, though often filled with likes and dislikes. Look down where the spoon and fork must stand, for the perfect arrangement gives the next command.’”

“An empty stage… the living room, for watching TV?” Linda guessed.

“But it says ‘Look down where the spoon and fork must stand’,” Tom pointed out. “That has to be the dining room. An empty stage for dinner.”

“Good catch,” Jennifer said, nodding. “Okay, third one. ‘I am the quiet twin, where daytime’s burden is shed. Here, two objects should mirror each other, right beside the head. Find the deliberate fault, the missing half you lack, to discover the true path that brings you back.’”

“Who wrote this? Fucking Shakespeare?!” Tom said with a chuckle.

“The master bedroom,” Mark said, ignoring him. “‘Daytime’s burden is shed… that’s sleep. And ‘two objects should mirror’… the bedside tables or pillows.”

“It fits,” Tom said. “So, biblioteca, dining room, master bedroom. That leaves the last one.” He pointed to the final riddle. “‘I wear my importance high above the floor, I am meant for crowds, though I need just one roar. Go to my heart, the place where all eyes meet.’” He looked around the vast hall. “Well, ‘meant for crowds’ and ‘great open space’, it has to be this room, the sala grande. But what about the rest of it? ‘One roar’? ‘High above the floor’?”

“And where’s the candle?” Linda asked, her eyes scanning the empty center of the room,: Let's knock out the other rooms first, we can come back to this one,” Mark suggested. They found the first three candles easily. One was on the mantelpiece in the biblioteca, another on the long table in the dining room, and a third on a nightstand in the master bedroom. But the candle for the sala grande proved elusive. The riddle said, “Go to my heart, the place where all eyes meet,” but the center of the room was empty. They searched for hours, their initial excitement giving way to frustration as the sun began to set on their second day. The blue light from the sconces now cast long, distorted shadows across the marble floor.

“I give up,” Mark said finally, “It’s not here. We’ve looked everywhere. Maybe it really was from a previous booking.” They retreated to the terrace with several bottles of wine, the unsolved riddle hanging over them. As darkness fell, they watched the fireflies begin to dance over the olive groves.

“‘I wear my importance high above the floor,’” Linda murmured, swirling the wine in her twelfth glass and staring up at the stars. “We’ve been looking on the floor, in the walls… but what if..”

Tom followed her gaze upward to the starry sky. “The chandelier,” he finished her question. “It’s the center of the room, where all eyes meet, and it’s high above the floor.”

A jolt of energy shot through the group. They rushed back into the sala grande, their eyes fixed on the enormous, multi-tiered crystal chandelier. A quick search revealed a small winch on the wall behind a tapestry. Working together, they slowly lowered the massive fixture. There, nestled in the very center, hidden among the crystal pendants, was the final candle. With trembling hands, Jennifer lit it.

As its flame ignited, a small drawer at the base of the bronze panel popped open. Linda heard the sound and jogged over to see what was inside. She found a small, rolled-up parchment with the number ‘1’ and a final message: “The path is lit, the code is scored. Seek the Contadino for your final reward.”

“7-3-9-1,” Linda recited, her voice trembling with excitement. “That’s the code!” ""What's a Contadino, though?"" asked Jennifer. ""Oh, I remember this from my high school Italian class, Contadino is, uh, a peasant or, or Farmer! I bet it's the fienile!"" Interjected Tom

They rushed to the fienile. It stood apart from the house, a hulking silhouette against the moonlit sky. Next to the heavy, weathered doors was a modern keypad, glowing with the same blue light. Jennifer’s hands shook as she punched in the four digits. The keypad beeped affirmatively, and with a soft THUMP, the lock retracted, and the heavy barn door slid open on silent, well-oiled tracks.

The air that drifted out was warm and humid, smelling of cedar and eucalyptus. As they entered, soft, ambient lights flickered on, revealing not a dusty barn, but a stunning, modern spa. The walls were lined with smooth, dark wood, the floor was polished concrete, and in the center of the room, a large, circular hot tub, built of black stone, steamed gently. A mini-fridge hummed to life, its door swinging open to reveal chilled champagne and crystal flutes.

“Oh my God,” Linda breathed. “This is incredible.”

“This is the prize?” Mark said, grinning ear to ear. “A private spa? This is 12 out of 10. We absolutely crushed this game.”

They didn’t hesitate. They popped the champagne, changed into their swimsuits, and slid into the hot tub’s warm, bubbling water. For a while, they just soaked, sipping champagne and laughing, recounting the day’s adventure. The stress of the final, difficult riddle melted away in the heat.

It was Mark who noticed it first. “Hey, do you guys see something over there?” he asked, pointing towards the far end of the fienile, just beyond the edge of the ambient light.

“Yeah, but not very well,” Linda said, squinting. “Wonder why it’s not lit up?”

“Oh, maybe there’s more to the game!” Jennifer chirped excitedly.

Curiosity piqued, they climbed out of the hot tub, wrapping themselves in the plush robes. Mark led the way. As he stepped within a few feet of the shadowy object, a new set of spotlights flared to life, illuminating a stone pedestal. On it sat a large, ornate wooden chest bound by a heavy, black iron band with four keyholes inset.

“What’s that?” Jennifer asked, walking toward it.

“I guess the game’s not over yet,” Tom said, a grin spreading across his face. “We need to find the keys.”

They split up to search the spa. The space was larger than it first appeared. Beyond the main area with the hot tub, they found a small, elegant changing room with a large mirror and marble counters. Adjacent to that was the sauna, its cedar walls radiating a dry, intense heat. The lounge area was stocked with fresh towels and bottled water. And at the far end, past a row of decorative plants, was a dark, unfinished storage area, filled with old furniture and dusty boxes.

It didn’t take them long to find the keys. Mark saw the first one hanging on a hook behind the heater in the sauna. Jennifer discovered the second tucked into the pocket of a plush robe in the lounge. Tom found the third resting on an underwater light fixture in the hot tub. And Linda, after a brief search, found the final key on the counter in the changing room, right in front of the large mirror.

They gathered back at the chest, triumphant, keys in hand. Their earlier giddiness returned, mixed with a fresh surge of adrenaline. This was it—the final prize.

“Well,” Mark said, setting his flute down. “Let’s see what we really won.”

With a collective nod, they inserted the keys into the four locks and turned them in unison. The locks released with a thunk as the band fell to the floor.

Slowly, Jennifer lifted the heavy lid. The first thing that hit them was the smell—not just the musty scent of old wood, but a cloying, sweet odor of decay and damp earth. They peered inside, but it was empty, filled with a profound, absorbing darkness that seemed to drink the soft spa light, a void that felt ancient and hungry.

The laughter died in their throats. The warm, cedar-scented air turned instantly cold, raising goosebumps on their arms. The ambient lights began to flicker and buzz erratically. One by one, they went out, plunging the spa into a suffocating blackness. And then, from the entrance, came a deafening BOOM as the heavy barn door slammed shut.

The darkness was oppressive, a physical presence that smothered sound and stole the air from their lungs. For a heartbeat, there was only stunned silence.

“Okay, very funny,” Jennifer said, her voice trembling slightly.

“That felt… different,” Linda whispered.

“It’s likely a power failure,” Tom said, his voice a calm, rational anchor in the dark. “It\`s an Old villa, all this luxury probably blew a fuse. Mark, can you check the door? I’ll see if I can find a breaker box in here.”

“Yeah, you\`re probably right, another level to the game would be a bit much,” Mark said, his voice already moving away. They heard his footsteps, then the sound of the heavy iron handle rattling uselessly. “It’s stuck!”

“What do you mean, stuck?” Tom called out.

“I mean, it won’t budge! It feels like it’s barred from the outside,” Mark yelled back, his voice tight with rising panic. He slammed his shoulder against the wood, the impact a dull thud in the oppressive silence. “I’m going to find something to pry it open. Look around for a crowbar or something!”

The group, now genuinely scared, began to search. Mark moved toward the right corner of the room, where he found a heavy-duty tire iron left near some old shelving in the storage area.

“Got something!” he shouted as he raced back to the door. He wedged the tip of the tire iron into the seam of the door and began to heave. At first, there was no reaction, but after a few tries, the wood began groaning in protest. “It’s moving! I think I can get this!”

He took a few steps back, braced himself, and slammed his shoulder into the tire iron. The impact sent a deep, shuddering vibration through the entire fienile. High above him, on the dusty second-floor loft, a massive, forgotten wooden crate shifted.

“Again!” Tom shouted, the sounds of the wood giving way having resounded throughout the room. Mark slammed into the tire iron again. BOOM. The vibration was even stronger this time. Above, the crate slid forward, its front edge now hanging precariously over the loft’s edge.

“One more time!” Mark yelled, sweat beading on his forehead. “It’s gonna give!” He took another running start and threw his entire body weight into the tire iron, CRACK. The door jamb splintered, but the door stayed in place and immobile. Mark stood, looking at the shattered jamb, his chest heaving from the exertion, a look of genuine puzzlement on his face, when the massive wooden crate suddenly crashed down on him with the force of a wrecking ball.

The moments immediately following the crash were dead silent, the entire group unconsciously holding their breath in shock. The image was too horrific, too impossible to process. Tom, Jennifer, and Linda rushed over to the door. Tom swept his flashlight beam over the mountain of shattered wood, lighting a single, mangled hand protruding from the wreckage. It twitched once as a dark, viscous pool of blood began to spread rapidly from beneath the debris.

A sound of pure, animalistic grief shattered the silence as a wave of agony washed over Jennifer, breaking her shock. ""MARK!"" she shrieked, scrambling toward the wreckage, but in her grief and haste, she didn't watch her steps and stepped into the pooling blood, her foot losing traction and sending her sprawling into the red liquid. She picked herself up into a sitting position and began to wail uncontrollably when she realised she was covered in her lover's blood.

""Oh my god, oh my god,"" Linda chanted as she rocked and hugged herself, her eyes wide and unblinking. Tom's mind struggled to process the impossible and reacted on instinct. He lurched forward; his hands were shaking uncontrollably.

""Call an ambulance!"" he yelled, his voice cracking. ""Somebody call 112!"" His own shock causing him to forget he was holding his phone momentarily, the screen’s harsh light illuminating his pale, sweat-slicked face for a second before his mind reengaged and he began clumsily stabbing at the app icons, ""Come on, come on…""

A beat of silence, then another. Tom stared at the top of his phone’s screen,

No Service.

His blood ran cold. ""I’ve got no signal,"" he said, his voice barely a whisper. Linda mechanically pulled out her phone and replied in a flat, numb voice. ""Me neither.""

""The Wi-Fi,"" Tom said, an injection of hope in his voice. ""The Wi-Fi. We can use that to make a call."" He looked from Linda’s pale, numb face to Jennifer, who was still crumpled on the floor, covered in her husband's blood and shaking with silent sobs. He knew in that moment they were in no condition to help. He was on his own.

""Linda,"" he said, his voice firm but gentle. ""Help me get her up."" Together, they managed to get Jennifer to her feet. She was limp, a dead weight of grief. ""Look at me,"" Tom said to Linda. ""Take her to the hot tub. Get her cleaned up and stay over there. I'll find the router.""

Linda, looking from Tom’s determined face to Jennifer’s broken form, slowly nodded. She wrapped an arm around Jennifer and began guiding her slowly toward the hot tub area, leaving Tom alone with the silent carnage.

Tom watched them go and took a deep, steadying breath before turning his phone’s flashlight towards the closest wall. He returned to the storage area, his light dancing over dusty boxes and sheet-covered furniture. As he turned, he caught a flicker of movement in his peripheral vision.

He whipped his head around, his heart hammering against his ribs, but saw only a stack of old paintings, their static faces staring back at him. He shook his head, trying to clear it. It’s just the stress, he told himself. My eyes are playing tricks on me.

He found a ladder leading up to the loft of the fienile, and, with a steeling breath, he climbed up. The loft was somehow even darker, the air seeming to have a weighted quality that made his breathing laboured. He swept his light across the space, illuminating a jumble of forgotten treasures and junk. And then he saw it. Tucked away in a corner, near a complex-looking junction of thick electrical conduits, was a small, metal box with a single, blinking green light—the router.

""I found it!"" he yelled, his voice a mixture of relief and triumph. ""I found the router!""

At the hot tub, Linda and Jennifer both heard Tom’s triumphant shout. A wave of relief washed over Linda. ""He found it,"" she said, her voice trembling with a fragile, newfound hope. ""See, Jen? It’s going to be okay. Tom will get us out of here."" She dipped a plush white towel into the warm water and began to gently wipe the drying blood from Jennifer’s face and arms. Jennifer remained pliant, her eyes vacant, but the rigid terror in her body seemed to lessen just a fraction.

Back in the loft, Tom scrambled over a pile of old crates, his eyes fixed on the blinking green light. As he reached for it, he felt a sudden, bone-deep chill, and the hairs on his arms stood on end. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a flicker of absolute blackness that seemed to suck the light out of the air. Just then, A low hum started from the conduits, and before he could pull his hand back, a thick, jagged bolt of blue-white electricity erupted from the junction box, slamming into his outstretched hand.

The force was unimaginable, a physical blow that welded his flesh to the metal in a shower of sparks. His body went rigid, every muscle contracting at once in a tetanic spasm that arched his back violently. A strangled, inhuman sound was ripped from his throat as his vocal cords seized. The smell of ozone was instantly overpowered by the sickeningly sweet stench of cooking meat and burning hair. His skin blackened and split where the current entered, the flesh blistering and popping.

A violent convulsion shook his entire frame, his limbs flailing wildly as if he were a marionette in the hands of a mad god. For a horrifying second, the electricity arced from his other hand to a nearby metal beam, creating a brilliant, terrible circuit with his body at the center. Then, with a final, explosive CRACK, the energy threw him backwards. He was flung through the air like a rag doll, his body limp, and slammed into a wooden support beam with a wet, final thud. He slid to the floor, a smoking, ruined thing. His eyes melted from their sockets, and a thin, greasy smoke curled from his open mouth and nostrils.

The deafening, explosive CRACK ripped through the barn, echoing from the second-floor loft, followed by a heavy, wet thud. The women froze, their eyes locking in a shared, unspoken terror. The silence that followed was deafening. ""Tom?"" Linda whispered, her voice barely audible. ""Tom?!"" she called out, louder this time, her voice cracking with a new, rising panic. She looked at Jennifer, who was now staring in the direction of the loft. Linda’s own courage, which had been so fragile just moments before, now hardened into a grim resolve. ""Stay here,"" she said, her voice low and firm. ""Don’t move. I’ll be right back.""

Linda slowly pulled out her phone and turned on the flashlight. She swallowed hard against a throat that was suddenly bone-dry. Her heart hammered against her ribs, but she pushed the fear down. Jennifer was depending on her. Tom was depending on her. She started moving, her small circle of light cutting a path through the thickening darkness, heading toward the location she thought she heard Tom shout.

As she passed the tall, rickety shelves of the storage area, a loud clatter from above made her jump. A stack of heavy-looking boxes tipped and then tumbled down, crashing onto the floor directly in her path and throwing up a cloud of dust. The way was blocked, she was forced to take a detour, her light now sweeping past the lounge area and toward the glass-enclosed sauna.

Suddenly, the sauna's interior lights flickered on, bathing the small, wood-panelled room in a soft, warm glow. The space was already thick with steam, and through the swirling vapor, she saw a figure. A man slumped on the bench. ""Tom!"" she cried out. All her fear, all her trepidation, was instantly erased by a wave of pure, desperate joy. She sprinted the remaining distance and threw the heavy glass door open, rushing inside.

""Tom, Baby, are you okay?"" she yelled, stepping into the wall of heat. The image of her husband flickered and dissolved into the swirling steam. A sudden, bone-chilling premonition washed over her. She spun around just as the heavy glass door slammed shut with the force of a guillotine. The sound of a lock clicked into place with absolute finality.

Outside the glass, standing by the control panel, was Tom. But it wasn’t Tom as she knew him. It was his corpse, its empty, dripping eye sockets fixed on her, as its blackened, smoking hand slowly, deliberately turned the temperature dial to the maximum setting. A strangled sob escaped her lips as she threw herself against the door, pounding on the thick, unyielding glass that was already hot to the touch.

She glanced at the digital display next to the door, its red numbers a mocking beacon in the swirling steam. They were climbing with impossible speed. 180°… 220°… 270°… The digits blurred as they ascended into a range that was no longer safe. Her first breath of the superheated steam was an agony she could never have imagined, a searing pain that felt like swallowing fire. It cooked the delicate tissues of her throat and lungs, and she began coughing and gagging, a thin, pink froth bubbling on her lips.

Her skin, already an angry, blotchy red, began to blister under the relentless assault of the wet, superheated air. The pain was a white-hot symphony of agony, a thousand needles piercing every inch of her body at once. A final, desperate surge of adrenaline gave her strength. She began blindly searching for any way out, her palms searing as she slapped them against the seamless wooden walls, looking for a panel, a vent, anything.

The air steam was so thick she could barely see through it now, and each breath was a fresh torment, scorching her throat and lungs until she could only manage shallow, ragged gasps. The edges of her vision began to darken as her body cooked from the inside out. She stumbled toward the glass door. As she drew near, the charred figure of her husband, who had been watching her motionlessly, glided to the other side of the glass. Now, inches away, Linda could see the full, gruesome details of its appearance. Tom’s eyes were gone, his skin blackened and split. What stood before her was not the man she loved but a grotesque mockery.

The sight, combined with the unbearable heat and the searing pain, was too much. A silent, hopeless sob shook her body, and the tears that streamed from her eyes turned to steam the moment they touched her blistering cheeks. Her legs gave out. She collapsed to the floor in a heap, the darkness in her vision surging inwards to consume her. As she lay dying, her gaze met Tom’s gaping, empty sockets, the ruined head tilted slowly to one side, and the blackened, lipless mouth stretched into something that could only be described. As a smile.

Linda tried to scream, but no sound came. Her vision collapsed to a single point of light, then went black. Her body gave one final, violent shudder, and then she was still. The only movement in the sauna was the relentless rise of the steam, curling around her lifeless form like a shroud

Jennifer remained by the hot tub. She had heard the boxes fall, a loud, startling crash, and then… nothing. A profound, unnatural silence that felt heavier and more terrifying than any scream. Linda had gone to check on Tom, and now she was gone too.

Get up, she told herself, her voice a silent scream in her own mind. Get up, you have to move. You have to find her. The thought of Linda alone and possibly hurt gave her a surge of adrenaline, and she pushed herself to move.

She pulled out her phone and fumbled to turn on the flashlight, her fingers clumsy and slick with a mixture of water and sweat. Just as the beam clicked on, the barn’s high-end sound system exploded to life at maximum volume. A wall of distorted, screeching static slammed into her, so loud and so sudden. She screamed, and her phone flew from her from grasp, arcing through the air before landing in the hot tub with a quiet. plink.

As the static roared, the barn's main lights flickered on, not the warm, inviting glow from before, but a harsh, sterile white that bleached all the color from the room. And in that light, she saw the massive main door, the one that had been barred and immovable, was now slightly ajar, a dark vertical slit of freedom in the wall of wood. Jennifer didn’t question it. She just ran. She threw her shoulder against the heavy door, grunting with effort, and managed to widen the gap just enough to squeeze her body through. She stumbled out into the cool night air, the sound of the screeching static still ringing in her ears, and sprinted for the main villa.

She burst through the unlocked front door, her breath coming in ragged, desperate gasps. The power was on. A soft, classical piece of music was playing. It was a scene of perfect, mocking normalcy. ""A phone,"" she gasped, her eyes darting around the entryway. ""I need a phone."" She ran through the downstairs rooms, her bare feet slapping against the cool terracotta tiles: the living room, the dining room, and the small study. Finally, in the dark, wood-panelled biblioteca, she found A vintage, rotary-style telephone sitting on the heavy oak desk. She lunged for it, her fingers closing around the heavy black receiver. She lifted it to her ear, her heart pounding with a desperate, fragile hope, but she was met by empty silence.

As she stood there, clutching the dead receiver, a loud, violent crash erupted from the back of the villa. It sounded like every pot and pan in a kitchen being thrown to the floor at once. Her head snapped up, her grief and terror momentarily replaced by a flicker of desperate hope. Linda?

She dropped the phone and ran to the large, professional-grade kitchen, its stainless-steel surfaces gleaming under the bright, modern lighting. The room was empty, but it was in complete chaos. Cabinet doors hung open, and bowls and plates were spilled onto the floor. Bags of flour and sugar had been ripped open, their white contents dusting every surface like a fine layer of snow. Jars of spices were shattered, their fragrant contents mixing into a strange, cloying potpourri.

""Linda?"" Jennifer whispered, her voice trembling. She took a slow, hesitant step into the room and scanned the destruction, her eyes darting from one mess to the next. A slight movement caught her eye, and she looked at a pile of pans. In each gleaming surface, the same impossible nightmare was reflected. It was standing right behind her. So close she could feel a profound, unnatural coldness radiating from it, a void where warmth and life were supposed to be.

Its skin was a waxy, translucent parchment, stretched so tight over its skeletal frame that she could see the dark, pulsing geography of veins beneath. Its limbs were impossibly long and thin, jointed in all the wrong places, and they moved with a constant, subtle series of micro-twitches and clicks, like a spider testing the strands of its web. The head was a smooth, elongated ovoid, like some deep-sea insect, and it lacked any feature save for two enormous, almond-shaped pits of polished obsidian that drank the light and reflected her own terrified face back at her, twisted into a mask of silent, screaming horror.

Its body was hairless and sexless, and adorned not with clothes, but with a lattice of intricate symbols carved directly into the parchment skin. They were not scars; they were fresh, raw, and they wept a thin, black, oily ichor that moved with a life of its own, slowly tracing the lines of the glyphs. A wave of primal, biological revulsion washed over her, so powerful it made her gag.

The primal revulsion that had frozen Jennifer in place finally broke, and a raw, piercing scream was torn from her throat. She spun around, her bare feet slipping on the flour-dusted floor, and scrambled for the doorway.

The entity didn’t move. It simply tilted its elongated head, and the fine layer of flour and sugar that dusted every surface began to stir, rising from the floor and counters in a swirling, ghostly white cloud. Then, the knives lifted from the magnetic block on the counter. The entire set rose into the air and formed a swirling, silver vortex in the center of the room, a tornado of polished, razor-sharp steel. The entity gestured, and she was lifted from her feet, suspended in the heart of the storm of blades.

The first knife, a long, thin boning knife, plunged into her thigh, and she screamed, a wet, gurgling sound. Another buried itself in her shoulder. The knives struck her from all directions, a brutal, percussive assault of piercing steel. They tore through her stomach, her arms, her legs, each impact a fresh wave of agony.

Finally, the heavy cleaver, which had been circling her like a patient shark, flew forward. It struck her square in the chest with a sound like a watermelon being split, burying itself to the hilt. Jennifer’s body was then slammed against the far wall, and the knives that were stuck into her began to push through her body, impaling her to the wall. Her head lolled forward, her lifeblood pouring from a score of wounds, a final, macabre masterpiece in the center of the chaos.

a thousand miles from the chaos, Julian Belrose sat in the cool, quiet darkness of his study. On one of his monitors, the four life-sign readouts, which had been spiking and plunging in a frantic dance, now settled into four, flat, serene lines. a faint, almost imperceptible smile played on his lips. He glanced at the secondary monitor, the livestream’s statistics. The viewer count had just ticked over to 3,000,000. A soft, pleasant ding echoed in the quiet of his study as another large donation rolled in.

He picked up a sleek burner phone from his desk and dialled a number from memory. It rang twice before a clipped, professional voice answered.

""Four this time,"" Julian said, his voice calm and even, ""And I need, re-containment.""

There was a pause on the other end. Julian listened, his eyes still on the flatlined monitors. ""Yes,"" he said, a hint of amusement in his voice. ""A dybbuk box.""

He listened for another moment, then ended the call and disassembled the phone, throwing the pieces in the trash can under his desk.

He turned his attention back to the livestream and typed a single, final message into the chat box: ""Till next time,"" and ended the stream. Then, he opened a new browser tab and navigated to a high-end, boutique travel website. He found the listing for the Tuscan villa, its pictures showing a sun-drenched paradise of rolling hills and rustic charm. He clicked on the admin portal, entered his credentials, and marked the property as ""under maintenance."" The listing vanished from the public site.

Finally, he opened a Tor browser, its icon a small, purple onion on his desktop. He navigated to a familiar address: reddit.com/r/nosleep. The page loaded a list of stories and he began to read, his eyes scanning the titles, looking for a spark of inspiration. He opened a fresh document on his computer and began to take notes, his fingers flying across the keyboard, already building, the foundations, of his next masterpiece.",1,1764531180.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1par51k,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1par51k/where_the_sun_can_never_stop_shining_monday/,Where the Sun Can Never Stop Shining: Monday,"*Inspired by the recent “Flight Attendants” episode, I wanted to post my own r/nosleep refugee. There are six parts that I’ll post if there’s any interest. Figured sharing here was a small way to show my love for the show.*

I woke up precisely at 7:55 like I had every morning I could remember. I hadn’t needed it since I turned 13, but I always set an alarm just in case. Reaching for my phone to turn it off, I remembered the dream I was having. A green park in a small town square out of a picture book. Surrounded by an old crimson brick wall that somehow looked as new as if it had been built yesterday. And a polite white bench.

I knew I had never been to the park. I doubted anyone had been to a park like that since the 1950s. But I had recurring dreams of it—first when I started my senior year of high school and now again since Bree started my campaign. But it still felt deeply familiar. Like a park that I might have visited when I was a young boy.

This time, though, something was subtly different. More the impression of the dream than the experience. The trees in the park were still tall, but they were ominous—not lofty. The brick wall was still solid, but it was impenetrable—not sturdy. And remembering the dream after I woke up, I thought it ended differently that time. I couldn’t remember how, but there was something new. A presence that woke me up with a sense of overwhelm instead of peace.

When I picked up my phone, I had already missed several texts from Bree. One a perfunctory good morning, “Hey, little brother! Big day today! Proud of you!” Then a handful laying out my schedule for the day. Work at the office from 9 to 5. Then at the campaign headquarters from 5 to 9. I knew that my days would grow longer as the election approached. For now, working the schedule of a normal lawyer seemed easy.

I put my feet down on my apartment’s cold wooden floor and walked to the television hanging opposite my bed. I turned it on just as the theme song for the local morning news started.

Somehow, Dotty Doyle was still hosting. She didn’t look like a general-store brand Miss America anymore, but she was still holding on. Even if her permed blonde hair seemed to be permanently strangling her gray roots.
“Good morning, Dove Hill!,” she rasped in an effortful echo of her younger voice. “It’s another sunny day! Even if the clouds disagree.” I let some air out of my nose. Dotty’s jokes had not gotten better with age. “Today’s top story: the race for Dove Hill’s seat in the state legislature. Young hometown attorney Mikey Dobson is running to unseat 12-term incumbent Senator Edmund Pruce whose office was recently the subject of an ethics investigation that has since been closed at the governor’s order.”

Bree’s publicist did a good job. I barely recognized myself in the photograph. When I looked in the mirror, I saw a too-tired and too-skinny nerd whose hair was too black to be brown and too brown to be black. On the TV, the glasses I was always anxious about keeping clean actually made me look smart. Especially next to my wrinkly plum of an opponent. I didn’t hate Pruce, but he was certainly made for the world before Instagram.

“The latest polling shows Pruce with a substantial lead thanks largely to the district’s heavy partisan tilt. Dobson’s campaign, led admirably by his sister Bree, is under-resourced but earnest. And his themes of bipartisanship, town-and-gown partnership, and clean government along with the campaign’s mastery of social media seem to be appealing to younger voters.” I couldn’t disagree with the narrative there. With only a fraction of our parents’ promised funds having come through, Bree had done a lot with a little.

Still listening to Dotty’s monologue about the job losses threatened by federal cuts to Mason County Community College’s budget, I showered and shaved. I put on my Monday coat and tie while the frumpled weatherman tried to make a week of clouds sound pleasant.
When I grabbed the remote to turn off the TV, Dotty teased, “Remember to join us this Friday night for the first and only debate between Mr. Dobson and Senator Pruce. The world–or at least our studio–will be watching.” At exactly 8:50 am, I grabbed my coffee and opened the door.

Walking out to find my door being watched impatiently by Rosa the cleaner, I paused for just a moment. I reminded myself that I was happy. I graduated from an Ivy League school. I opened my own law office. I was running for office. And my parents, according to their Facebook posts, were proud of me.

Using the mindfulness techniques that my therapists had taught me, I brought myself back to the present. I turned to Rosa and gave her a pleasant smile. “Buenos días, Rosa!,” I recited in perfect Spanish. “Gracias por limpiar mi lugar y todos tu arduo trabajo.” Every person was a potential voter.

Looking into the mop water on Rosa’s cart, I found myself thrust back into memory of that morning’s dream. I remembered that I was stirred by the strange feeling of drowning in something other than water. Something thin and gauzy. Then I remembered the sight that I saw right before opening my eyes. The material I was drowning in was bright, almost neon pink—somewhere between Pepto-Bismol and that hard bubblegum I used to get at church. I knew the park dream happened when I was stressed, but this hot pink funeral shroud was something new.

I caught myself. It was time to work.

Once I got to the office, I worked on pleasantly mundane tasks: drafting a complaint, reviewing a deposition transcript, checking the mail. I even found something to like about billing hours. I was fortunate. Unlike most of my law school classmates, I actually liked being a lawyer.

Or I had. When Bree started to plan the campaign, she started to advise me on which clients and cases I should take. Of course, none of her suggestions were optional.

With 4:00 pm approaching, I prepared for a meeting with a potential client. Since I was one of the very few attorneys in town—perhaps the only one without a drinking problem—I never knew what kind of client or case these meetings were going to bring. At precisely 4:00 pm, I opened the door to see a round man with a look like he was meeting an old friend.

I welcomed him in and listened to his story. The man explained that he had just been released from the Mason County Correctional Facility. Apparently, this was supposed to be a civil rights case. The man described the conditions in the prison. I wished I could be surprised at the routine violations of basic laws and human rights. I couldn’t be. I grew up hearing the same stories from some of my extended family—third cousins and the like. This was the kind of case I had become a lawyer to take. But I knew I couldn’t take this one. I couldn’t look anti-cop with the election just two weeks away.

“So that’s my story,” the man concluded.

“I understand,” I lied kindly. “Thank you for sharing with me.” I meant that part.

“Do you think you can help me, Mr. Mikey?”

“I’m not sure. Let me step out and call my associate.”

I left the cramped conference room that used to be a kitchen. Pulling up my recents to call Bree, I realized I had been using a creative definition of “associate” over the past few months.

Bree answered efficiently. “Hey! Are you on the way?”

“Not quite. I’m wrapping up a meeting with a potential client.”

“Is this another soft-on-crime case?”

“It’s not soft on crime. It’s…,” I began to protest.

“No. Absolutely not.” The law had spoken. “You know we can’t take those cases this close to the election. You’re running to make the change that will keep those cases from happening in the first place. You can’t let your feelings make you sacrifice your future.” I wondered why Bree said that “we” couldn’t take the case.

“Yeah. You’re right. I’ll see you soon.”

As I opened the door to tell the man the news, the man’s phone rang. I knew I remembered that song. Slow. Sweet. Syrupy. But I couldn’t place it.

*If you’re not feeling happy today,
Just put on a smiling face.
It will make the pain go away
Before you forget to say…*

Remembering those lyrics, I felt seen. And watched.

“So, what’s the verdict?,” the man hoped out loud.

“I’m sorry, sir. The firm just can’t take on a case like yours at the moment. If you’d like, I can refer you to some other attorneys.”

“No thanks. I’ll take this as my answer.”

I flinched at that then continued the script.
“Well, thank you for coming in. It’s always a pleasure to meet someone from our town.”

Waiting for me to open the door, the man mumbled genuinely, “Sure. Thanks for your time. I’m still going to vote for you.” I went to close the door behind the man but couldn’t stop myself from asking.

“Excuse me. Sir?” The man turned around halfway down the brick walkway. “I love your ringtone. What song is that? I know I heard it when I was a kid, but I can’t remember the name.”

The man looked at me like I had just asked if his prison cell had been on Jupiter. “I think it’s called Marimba or something. It’s just the default.”

I gave the man a kind nod. Closing the door behind him, I tried to shake off the feeling that came over me when I heard that song. It made me feel uncomfortably aware of the man’s eyes on me when I braced to deliver the bad news. It was like the man was suddenly joined by an invisible audience that waited for me to say the lines I had rehearsed so many times. The song reminded me of something always waiting just out of sight—waiting to swallow me whole if I ever failed to act my part.

I walked back to my desk, shut my laptop, and grabbed my blazer on the way out the door. In the past, I might have stayed late to work on cases. Not that month.

*	*	*	*	*	*	*

Driving through town, I passed the old bookstore where I spent hours on afternoons when my parents were working and Bree was building her resume with one extracurricular or another. The owner, Mrs. Brown, always made me feel at home. I’m not sure if it was because of her failing memory or because she saw just what I needed, but Mrs. Brown always left me alone. I cherished that time alone with Mrs. Brown where I could breathe without someone’s eyes waiting for me to do something wrong. Something that the kids at school would make fun of and my family would try to fix. In Mrs. Brown’s store, I could just *be.*

By the time memory took me to junior year when Mrs. Brown’s store was run out of the market by internet sales, I had arrived at my campaign office. That is probably not the right word. It was more the building that my campaign office was in. The building that was the town civic center some decades ago. Now it had been converted into a rarely-used venue for weddings and receptions and overflow offices for some of the mayor’s staff. One of these town employees was the daughter of one of Bree’s favorite professors, and he convinced her to let Bree borrow it after city work hours.

Walking from the car to the double dark-paneled wooden doors, I appreciated that the mayor who had ordered the renovation had at least thought to preserve the building’s frame. It had been there longer than anyone still alive in the aging county.

Bree was waiting just inside the dust-odored lobby when I opened the doors. Before either of us said anything, she gave me a flash of a smile. We always had this moment. Before we started talking about the campaign or our careers or what we could do better, Bree looked at me like a proud big sister happy to see her little brother. I remembered this smile from our childhood, but it became fainter and rarer as Bree aged and took on more responsibilities. Ever since our father informed us that Bree would be running my campaign, the smile only came in those flashes.

“Hey. Good day at work?” Bree asked perfunctorily. I loved her for trying.

“Normal,” I said, following Bree down the side hallway to the cramped office. “So I can’t complain.”

“I’m glad,” Bree answered. I wasn’t sure if she was glad I had a good day or glad I was not complaining. Probably both.

We sat down in the professor’s daughter’s town-issued pleather chairs, and Bree commenced.

“Thank you for coming this evening.” She ran those meetings like she was reading a profit and loss statement in a Fortune 500 conference room. Sometimes I wondered if she rather would be. “The polling is still not optimal. We’re trailing 45 to 50 with 8 percent undecided. The latest social campaign went well. The A-B testing found that the voters prefer you in a red tie so we’ll stick with that going forward.”

Tired of fighting it, Bree pushed her a runaway wisp of black hair out of her face with a red headband. I smiled to myself thinking about Bree doing that as a girl. She was always too serious to bother with her hair.

“Anti-corruption is still your strongest issue. People seem to like that coming from someone young and idealistic. The question is whether it will be enough to get people to the polls when Pruce has the culture war on his side.”

I nodded at the right time. I wanted to pay attention. Bree worked hard to prepare this report, but it was hard to focus when I knew my opinions didn’t matter. Bree made the decisions for the campaign, and the polls made the decisions for Bree. I hated myself for being so cynical, but I was a politician now—just the smiling face on the well-oiled machine.

When Bree started to explain the campaign schedule up through Friday’s debate, I heard something familiar. It sounded like a woman humming in the room next door. Except, in the office at the end of the narrow hallway, there was no room next door. I decided I wasn’t hearing anything.

Bree dictated, “Tomorrow, we have a meeting with Scarnes and Blumph, your publicists.”

*If you’re not feeling happy today…*

The wordless music continued, now coming from both the room that wasn’t next door and behind the professor’s daughter’s desk.

My decision failed me. I was definitely hearing something. I told myself maybe it was an old toy in one of the cardboard boxes that towered in the corner opposite me. I looked up at Bree to see if she heard anything. She reported on without a moment’s hesitation.

“Then on Wednesday we have the meet and greet at the nature center.”

Moving my head as little as possible, I began to dart my eyes around the room. The music was coming from above me now. I thought there might have been an attic there before the renovation.

*Just put on a smiling face…*

I tried my best to look focused. I was always trying my best.

“On Thursday, we have your appearance for seniors at the YMCA.”

I fought to keep breathing, but the air was leaving me. The music, now all around me and getting louder, was almost suffocating. I was drowning in it.

*It’ll make the pain go away…*

My nerves began to demand my body move. First my fingers began to tap the chair’s worn arm. The music grew louder. Then my feet joined in. The music was nearly deafening.
At that, Bree looked up from her papers. For another fleeting moment, she looked at me like a sibling instead of a campaign manager. But this time it was a look of concern instead of affection.

“You good?” Bree’s question was almost drowned out by the song.

“Yeah, yeah. I’m fine. Probably just too much coffee.” I felt like I was shouting, but I knew I was using my inside voice.

Almost as scared of Bree’s disappointment as the music from the void, I asked, “Do you hear something?”

The music stopped except for the faint hum from the woman in the room that wasn’t next door.

*Before you forget to say…*

“No.” Bree’s face looked just as I feared: worried but not willing to show it.

Silence kindly returned.

With an earnest attempt at earnestness, I pivoted like a professional. “And the debate’s Friday?”

“Right…” Bree said as if she were asking herself for permission to continue. “ I’ll do the walkthrough of the venue on Thursday afternoon. But don’t forget. Dotty’s show is that morning. It’s one of your only friendly audiences.”

She haltingly continued to the financial section of her report, and I remembered. The song was called “Put on a Smiling Face,” and it was from Sunnyside Square. I thought it was my favorite show as a kid. But, after I heard the song in my office and then in Bree’s, I texted a few friends.

A few things about me: • I read and write like I’m being chased by a deadline no one actually gave me. • I dip my fries in Frostys because that is how God intended potatoes to be enjoyed. • I pour liquids into bottle caps and pretend they’re shots, because sometimes you just need to feel like you’re at a club even though it’s Tuesday at 3pm and your “drink” is orange Gatorade. • I invent elaborate backstories for strangers at Target, usually involving secret royal bloodlines, cursed heirlooms, or mild tax fraud. • I embarrass my loved ones using offensive-to-no-one but highly dramatic accents in public. • I hunt for new music like it’s treasure, and when I find a song that emotionally drop-kicks me, I listen to it while curled up in the shower like I’m in an A24 coming-of-age movie.

I’m hoping to meet people who are… real. Real complex. Real simple. Real funny. Real soft where it matters. Real in need (or want) of a connection that’s based on mutual kindness, random serotonin drops, and daily attempts to make each other smile.

Bonus points if you are also powered by a chaotic blend of coffee, energy drinks, and pure stubborn willpower — the kind of person who wakes up, cracks open a caffeinated potion, and thinks, “Yes. I choose life.”

If you’re the type who finds joy in tiny things — like the perfect playlist, a particularly chaotic group chat, or the moment your caffeine finally kicks in and you achieve temporary godhood — we’ll get along beautifully.

So yeah… if you’re looking for a friend who’s funny, genuine, occasionally poetic, occasionally feral, and always up for a laugh, send me a message.

I think he might be interested too cause whenever I have visited the cafe w my friends, he has said hello, asked how I am, asked how I liked my coffee, and stuff.

I have noticed in my recent visit that we even made eye contact twice while I sat outdoor and he was indoor.

This is a competitive space, with thousands of applicants daily, so standing out is essential. Read all instructions carefully, be original, and avoid using external tools or AI assistance. These types of sites work with big tech companies that give projects, they can detect this easily. Your answers should be creative yet clear, with proper grammar, punctuation, and structure. Keep your responses concise and to the point. Rambling or adding filler content may confuse the AI and lower your score.

Although the assessments typically don’t have strict time limits, it’s best to complete them in one focused sitting. Taking too long or pausing mid-way for a break (like making coffee) could be interpreted as lack of commitment or preparation. Then again with the amount of applicants they get, I wouldn't blame them for getting rid of the slow workers. That said, don’t rush! Balance quality with reasonable pacing. If you're unsure about a response, take the time to double-check your work. These platforms prioritize quality input to ensure the AI models learn from accurate, well-written content.

Only apply for roles that match your skills. Many people lose access after being accepted because they struggle with project-specific requirements or receive too much bad feedback (R&Rs). Choose projects you're confident in and comfortable with. If a task seems too difficult or unclear, it's better to skip it than risk poor performance. The platforms even recommend taking breaks when tired, as high-quality work matters more than volume.

Also, follow the rules. Don’t use VPNs, fake identities, or create multiple accounts to game the system. These platforms work with major tech companies and have strict verification processes, including ID checks. If your country isn’t supported yet, don’t try to bypass restrictions. Instead, sign up and wait. They’ll notify you if and when your region becomes eligible.

Finally, be patient. Even after passing the assessment and updating your profile, it might take weeks or even months to be assigned your first project. Many users report long waiting periods, so don’t be discouraged if you don’t get immediate work. Stay ready, and keep checking your dashboard for opportunities.

1paqu5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/BetterAtPeople/comments/1paqu5y/discussion_signs_you_are_silently_attractive_even/,"[Discussion] Signs you are silently attractive, even if you don’t feel it","So many people I know ,  including myself for a long time ,  never realized they were low-key attractive. Not in the loud, obvious way that social media celebrates, but in quiet signals that others pick up on, even if *you* don’t. Silent attractiveness is real. It shows up in micro-behaviors, subtle dynamics, and the energy you bring into a space. But the sad thing? Most people miss it. Because they’ve been conditioned to believe that attractiveness = looks + loud confidence.

This post is for those who’ve been told they’re attractive “once someone gets to know them” or who keep wondering, *why do strangers stare at me but no one approaches me?* It’s not your imagination. I’ve been studying nonverbal communication, evolutionary psychology, and social dynamics over the past few years ,  through books, behavioral science research, podcasts, and some trial-and-error in my own life. What I’ve learned is that attraction is more nuanced and unspoken than we think. Here’s what actually signals that silent, magnetic appeal ,  and how to lean into it without pretending to be someone you’re not.

Let’s unlearn the IG filter version of hotness and talk about the real stuff.

**1. People stare at you a little longer than normal ,  but don’t always smile**

This one confused me for *years*. I thought I was being judged. Turns out, studies on gaze behavior (notably from psychologist Alan J. Fridlund’s work on facial expressions) show that prolonged eye contact without facial cues often means low-level attraction + confusion. When you don’t give off strong emotional signals, people get curious. They can’t read you. That “blank stare” is them trying to figure you out. Hot people who are loud and confident are easy to categorize. But hot people who are quiet? More puzzling. And more interesting.

**2. People mirror your body language ,  even without engaging you**

It’s subtle but powerful. If you’re sitting with your arms crossed and someone nearby unconsciously mirrors it, or if others shift their body toward your direction without seeming to notice ,  that’s subconscious alignment. Behavioral mimicry is often a sign of interest or admiration, whether romantic, friendly, or social. Check out the studies on nonverbal synchrony by Dr. Tanya Chartrand. You’d be surprised how much people are drawn to those who seem composed, self-contained, and grounded.

**3. Strangers open up to you in random places**

This isn’t just a sign of being friendly. People who radiate calm, curiosity, or emotional availability tend to draw out unfiltered sharing. You may think you’re invisible ,  but someone at a bus stop or coffee shop just told you their life story. That’s a magnetism rooted in emotional safety, which is a HUGE draw. A 2021 study from the Journal of Social Psychology found that perceived emotional intelligence in first impressions was a stronger predictor of attraction than even physical traits.

**4. You rarely get compliments about your looks ,  you get them about your “vibe”**

If you’ve gotten comments like “there’s just something about you” or “you have such a calm energy,” congrats ,  that’s silent attraction. A book that deeply explores this is *Captivate* by Vanessa Van Edwards. It breaks down how people unconsciously size up charisma, and why people who don’t try hard often seem the most magnetic. If you’ve ever been confused why a conventionally “loud” friend gets compliments while you get questions like “where are you from? what do you do? what’s your story?” ,  that’s intrigue. You live in the slow-burn zone.

**5. People act weird around you sometimes… or compete with you subtly**

This one is painful. Silent attractiveness can make others ,  especially those used to being centers of attention ,  feel threatened. I’ve had coworkers or classmates who got weirdly competitive or passive aggressive out of nowhere. At first, I blamed myself. But then I heard therapist and author Dr. Ramani discuss “narcissistic scarcity mindset” in her podcast ,  where people who rely on external validation feel unsafe around others who exude calm confidence without trying. You might not even *feel* confident. But your stillness makes others feel seen... and challenged.

**If you resonate with any of the above, here are some low-effort ways to make the most of it (without changing who you are):**

**1. Make learning part of your life**

Magnetic energy often comes from depth. People sense when you’ve done the *inner work*. One of the best ways I’ve found is creating a simple, daily knowledge ritual. For real, just 10–15 minutes a day adds up. I use the *Waking Up* app (by Sam Harris) for grounding myself in presence and conscious awareness. His guided meditations and lectures make emotional self-regulation a quiet superpower. And that regulated energy? Makes you wildly attractive.

**2. Improve 1% every day**

If you write, think, or observe for even a few minutes daily, you become sharper ,  more interesting without even talking. *The Knowledge Project* podcast by Shane Parrish is a goldmine for this. His episodes (especially ones with Naval Ravikant or Jim Dethmer) will train your brain to see through surface-level BS and spot what really matters in social dynamics, persuasion, and relationships.

**3. Build a slow learning habit**

Another underrated thing I started doing this year ,  re-building how I consume information. Not scrolling viral TikToks for dopamine crumbs, but going deep on a topic I actually care about. That’s where *BeFreed* has been a total game-changer. It’s an AI-powered podcast-style app that generates personalized audio episodes based on what you want to improve ,  like emotional intelligence, social mastery, or self-esteem. The cool part is it feels like a real convo. You can pause and ask follow-ups like, “explain that with an example” or “how do I use this in a relationship?” It goes deeper the more you chat with it. That real-time, custom style makes it 10x more engaging than passive listening. Helps me make sense of complex stuff in small doses whenever I’m walking or driving.

**4. Read books that rewire how you see people**

This is the best underrated book I’ve ever read for understanding attraction and human behavior: *The Art of Seduction* by Robert Greene. Yes, it’s got a dramatic title. But underneath the surface, it’s a breakdown of timeless archetypes of charisma, psychological influence, and how “silent” types ,  like the Coquette and the Natural ,  hold power in ways louder people don’t. This book will make you question everything you think you know about sex appeal and subtle power. Highly addictive read.

**5. Watch YouTube content that decodes social behavior**

One channel that got me hooked lately is *Charisma on Command*. Their breakdowns of celebrity interviews, social tension, and body language are super clear and practical. For example, they have great videos on why Keanu Reeves is quietly magnetic, or how understated confidence comes across stronger than over-the-top bragging. It helped me realize confidence isn’t about talking more. It’s about saying what matters and knowing when not to speak.

If any of this hits you, know that subtle attractiveness is something real. It doesn’t always generate likes or followers. But it shows up in real life, in deep interactions, in the way people feel drawn to your energy. You don’t need to yell to be heard. You don’t need to post thirst traps to be desired. You’re already radiating something. You just haven’t been taught how to see it yet.",1,1764530432.0,BetterAtPeople,0,1.0,False

And now that it's done, I'm feeling all of the everything at the same time:  
\-Pride  
\-Panic  
\-Excitement  
\-Dread  
\-Relief  
\-IMPOSTER SYNDROME   
\-And that weird emptiness that comes from closing a world you poured your heart into.

  
It's a holiday themed horror adventure I've been building for a couple months, with emotional NPCs, tense set pieces, and a few moments I genuinely hope will make people sob. Now that I've finished it though, my brain is just whooping my ass:  
""What if it's actually terrible?""  
""What if the emotional moments don't land?""  
""What if I missed something obvious?""  
and most importantly  
""Why does finishing something I loved working on feel so... empty?

  
I'm proud of it, like, so proud, but also I hate it.

Letting the words out before I lose courage again,"I am turning 23 in 3 months and i have spent most of my life trying to take up as little space as possible. You call it me being shy or being in a quiet voice or just polite smiles or whatever. I am the guy who fades into the background at gatherings. I have never shown this side to anyone. Not a single soul. The fear is heavier than the anything that I can handle.

If i am being honest what I need now is simple and enormous at the same time maybe just one person who will look at this version of me and not look away. Someone who will see me nervously in front of a mirror in something pretty and say gently that You are beautiful and please stay like that. Someone who understands that this is definitely not a phase or a costume. It is the most honest part of me finally asking to exist and above all finally decided to be myself even for fleeting moments. I am not asking for the whole world to accept me yet. I just want one safe pair of arms and one quiet room you call it one heartbeat that is not startled when I blush and whisper or ask that is this okay? I want lazy evenings where I can be myself while we watch movies or talk about anything and where I can rest my head on your shoulder wearing the softest hoodie I own and feel for once like I belong exactly as I am. 

I promise in return you wil get someone loyal, endlessly tender someone who listens like it is a love language and remembers the smallest things about you. Someone who will celebrate your softness or your strength with the same manner. If you are kind & patient and somewhere between 20 to 30 in or near Delhi, and the thought of being with someone who is being real self makes your heart ache in the gentlest way, please write to me. We can definitely start slow be it texts, voice notes or coffee in baggy clothes or you suggest something.

I am again hopeful and terrified to post this but the hopeless romantic in me won't stop so here i am more terrified of never trying.

I’m a truly hopeless romantic. Give me cliché stuff, gentle romance, quiet nights, cute dates, sharing life with my person, making memories, all that classic relationship stuff. But here comes the tricky bit: I’m asexual. Meaning I’m not up for anything sexual, *ever*. Which, to no surprise, has made my love life a bit challenging. I said this is a shot in the dark, didn’t I?

I offer dry humour, teasing as a love language, random info dumps and loads of cuddles. Needless to say, I’d love a partner who accepts my boundaries and is happy without any bedroom activities, so someone with a very low drive, or maybe I’ll strike it lucky and you’re ace too! **So, in a nutshell**, I’m looking for a monogamous long term relationship. Easier said than done, being ace, but never say never!

Now, since lists are clear and effective, have some!

**Who I am:**

* 27 years old and from Finland
* atheist and progressive person (liberal, leftie, woke, you get it)
* childfree
* chubby and short, short dark hair (but it changes, it’s been blue, purple, red…)
* some small tattoos but I dream of a full sleeve
* don’t smoke or drink at all, my only vice is coke zero
* city girl, love culture, museums, theatre, musicals, coffee shops, shopping etc.
* into writing, reading, photography, fashion, city holidays, binging tv shows
* not nerdy but not sporty either
* sadly very allergic to pets

**Who I’m looking for:**

* around my age, and please be 25 or older
* located in Europe
* doesn't want children
* knows what he wants, emotionally intelligent, honest, humorous
* someone I can have deep conversations with but also goof around

**Dealbreakers/ Big NOs for me:**

* sexism, homophobia, transphobia, racism, bigotry in general
* drugs, smoking, drinking a lot

1paqmfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1paqmfr/aita_for_being_upset_with_my_roomate/,AITA For Being Upset With My Roomate?,"I 18yo Female and my roomate 19yo (who I will refer to as Sally to protect her privacy)are both freshman at the same college. I also will mention right off the bat, that Sally is an only child, which is perfectly fine! I just want to put it out there for context.

Sally was not originally my roomate. I planned on having my room as a super-single as I have PTSD and really high anxiety. I also want to mention for context that I paid a $100 deposit to make sure I had this room as it is very accessible for me. It’s on the first floor, relatively close to the main entrance, and very close to the bathrooms. This is perfect for me Incase of a medical emergency (which I have had 2 instances where I had to be taken by ambulance this semester). 


Now, back to the story😅
I met Sally by coming in contact with her crazy roomate at a residence hall party on the first week of classes. This is a whole different story, but long story short, this roomate of Sally’s was honestly a really freaky and scary person. I found out Sally was in one of my classes, so I decided to talk to her and ask if she was safe. After meeting her roommate I know I wouldn’t feel safe in the dorm. Sally said she hasn’t been able to sleep and really dosent like this roomate. So I decided I could open up my room and allow her to have a safe space. So she filled out a room switch paper and moved in with me. She got settled in and my RA came in that night and helped us fill out a roomate success plan (RSP). We decided that we would split the room my half your half and that we would be willing to share a couple of things ex:(she would share her fridge, and I would share my humidifier). I also stated that she is welcome to my snacks but I just ask that she asks first as these snacks are mainly for if my blood sugars go low and I like to keep inventory so I know when to stock up and budget. Sally agreed to that. I also have a Betta fish in the room. I stated that he is on a strict feeding schedule as he was a rescue and I want to ensure he stays healthy. She agreed and mentioned she loves bettas. 

She seemed like she would be the perfect roomate and we should be able to coexist with each other just fine…

After a few weeks, I noticed some things of Sally that made me uncomfortable. In our room, our beds both face the long way against the wall. (I will include a drawing of how our room is laid out). Right off the bat, Sally moves her bed so it is directly touching my bed. (My bed actually has a headboard and footboard because these beds can be stacked into bunk beds). I thought it was weird she would want to sleep the same way as me and put her pillows on the footboard of my bed but I brushed it off. However, when she goes to sleep, her pillows fall through the gap on the footboard and go onto my bed and touch my feet. I have sensory issues and I am very big on my personal space and my boundaries. I really did not like her belongings on my bed. I decided she would probably realize it and adjust her bed. But she didn’t…

Another issue I was having with her is she never asked for any of my snacks, She just took. She would come up to my drawer stand and say “I have the munchies” and proceed to take a couple of snacks. There was also a day I came back from class and I found her under my bed and she jumped out holding one of my drinks. She looks at me and says “oh! I was just looking for this”. That really bothered me because she didn’t ask and I don’t know if she was doing this all the time when I wasn’t in the room. I actually put it to test and wrote down how many items I had of each before I went home for the weekend and sure enough when I came back, I was missing a few. I told myself it wasn’t that big of a deal but it was really bothering me because I specifically asked her to ask me before hand and she agreed. I also noticed her mom sends her care packages every month and there are tons of snacks in there! So I don’t really see why she needs to come into my area for my snacks. 

There was one day I came back from my house over the weekend and Sally was talking to my fish. She said “I know you’re mad at me because I didn’t feed you yesterday”. I was confused and asked her why she had been feeding him when I told her he was my fish and I am the one taking care of him and I never asked her to feed him in the first place. She responded with “oh it’s ok because I know everything about bettas because I had a couple growing up. I reminded her I have him on a strict schedule so he dosent get bloated and have issues in the long run. She didn’t say anything after that. But the next weekend when I came back from my house, I noticed my fish was very off. He was having trouble staying upright and had an obvious boyancy issue. I realized he did have swim bladder and I asked Sally if she fed him at all. She responded hesitantly with “no”, but I could tell something was off. My fish was clearly struggling, so I had to go to the pet store, get another tank, some aquarium salts, and some water medication which costed me about $95 to create a hospital tank for my fish so the medication and salts wouldn’t damage the live plants and ecosystem in his tank. I was absolutely furious. I got back, set his hospital tank up and started overthinking and wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt and I also purchased treated water and put that in his ecosystem tank thinking maybe the original water was too hard. But I knew it was because Sally was feeding him let alone overfeeding him. I reminded her again that he was my fish and was my responsibility. She didn’t say anything. 

Yet another issue I’m having with her… Sally’s desk is right next to my closet. I noticed she always placed her backpack and belongings in front of my closet doors blocking me from getting in. So every time I need to get into my closet, I have to move her stuff out of the way. It honestly isn’t that big of a deal, but there is plenty of space under her desk or somewhere else she could put her stuff. I noticed that when I do move her stuff, she gets up right away and puts her stuff right back infront of my closet as if it offended her. This really started to bother me because I keep everything on my side of the room and I make sure there is a boundary line that everything stays on one side of. 

Along with my stuff her stuff… we both have a garbage can of our own. Only mine is used for garbage. Sally uses her garbage can as a night stand by tipping it upside down, which is honestly really smart, but all of her garbage goes into my garbage can which is significantly smaller than hers. So I have to take it out often and use 2x as many of my garbage liners to fit her stuff too. She even reminds me that the garbage is getting full so I should take it out soon. She dosent even offer to help take it out, which again really bothers me. 

I got so fed up with all of this, and I actually started reacting symptomatically from holding it in. I would get severe migraines and I wouldn’t get any sleep making school absolutely miserable. Which sucks because I really do like my classes but I physically can’t do it. 

So… I had a meeting with my RA hoping she could help me solve the issue without coming off as rude or trying to upset Sally. My RA decided we would have a meeting all 3 of us and act like it’s a roomate success plan check in. I thought that was a great idea so it gives Sally equal opportunity to speak if there are things I’m doing that bothers her so it’s not just me ratting her out. 
The meeting comes and I shared everything I said above and everything that was bugging me. I kid you not… Sally completely dismissed everything I said. 

I first brought up the bed situation and how she is crossing my personal space boundary by her belongings coming onto my bed at night. My RA suggested Sally move her bed slightly and push it against the wall and face the other way so she could use the wall to hold her pillows up and nothing will come into my personal space. Sally replied with: “I absolutely cannot sleep the other way because it hurt my feet doing that” my RA and I looked at each other because we were not expecting that and it really didn’t make any sense. 
So I went onto my next issue saying I really didn’t appreciate her not asking to take any of my snacks and how I notice her coming into my area often saying “I have the munchies” and taking whatever. And going into my area when I’m not in the room, which I feel is a total violation of my space. Sally replied with “I don’t know what you are talking about, I think I’m always really good about asking for anything” I said okay and moved on. 

I then brought up how I kept telling her I didn’t want her feeding my fish especially when I told her I am the one taking care of him and that I never asked her to. She again replied “I never fed him, I don’t go near him”. She completely lied because she told me that one day that she forgot to feed him which tells me she’s feeding him when I am gone. I also mentioned to the RA he dosent need to eat when I’m gone for the weekend because Saturday is his fasting day to let his tiny somach settle so he dosent get bloated which can k!ll a fish. 

I then mentioned I don’t like how she blocks my closet with her belongings and I have to move all of it just to get into my closet… She replied with: “oh it’s okay because you don’t move my stuff that far”I mentioned after I move her stuff to get into my closet, she gets up right away and puts it right back. I asked her if there was anywhere else she could put her stuff like under the desk where there is plenty of room. She replied with: “no, if I put my stuff under the desk, then I have to bend down to get it and I don’t like that”. 
After she said that I was absolutely furious with her because she is completely dismissing everything I mentioned and won’t even offer to make a change because it inconveniences her. 

My RA said she will have to make a change with her bedding because her pillows are actively falling into my area. After our meeting, Sally did move her bed against the wall and off my bed, she had to take a lid to a very large tuberware container to try to hold her pillows up. While she was setting it up, she looks at me and says “if this dosent work and if I don’t get good sleep, I will be miserable”. 
The next day, Sally was very angry because it kept falling down and because of that she kept waking up. I told her I didn’t know what to tell her and she walked away angrily. Sally ever so slightly moved her backpack so it’s closer to her desk but still infront of my closet. She is also giving me the silent treatment and when she does talk to me, she talks in a very angry tone and gets very snippy. She has been talking to herself a lot lately and I asked if she could keep it down a bit as I was trying to study. She replied with “I am actually trying to be successful here” and scoffed. 

Another thing with Sally since, is she feels like she needs to be apart of everything in my life. To try to get a break from Sally. I joined hall government as a student impact leader. She somehow found me on our meeting night and stood behind me for like 10 minutes while we were having our meeting. Sally is not apart of hall gov and has no meaning being there so everyone thought that was really weird. She also feels the need to invite herself to whatever I’m doing. Like one day I was getting ready to go to class and she asked where I was going, I was honest and said I was going to get a coffee and go meet my professor for help on a quiz. Sally said “oh I guess we could go for coffee” and got up. I tried to get away from her and said I was going to take out the trash and she stayed in the room. After taking the trash out, I went and got my coffee hoping she would just leave me alone. When I was waiting for my drink to be made, she found me and was upset that I left her. I did feel bad thinking I should have communicated but I didn’t know what to say without offending her and making her mad. I then got my drink and went and saw my professor. I also notice whenever I enter the room or get up to do something in the room, Sally makes a groaning noise like me standing up is annoying her. I don’t know why she’s doing this and I am really confused. I know she’s mad at me. 

After all of this, I went to my hall director because our meeting with our RA obviously didn’t work, and Sally is showing signs of entitlement, dismissing my boundaries, prioritizing convenience over fairness, acting like rules and my boundaries don’t apply to her, Getting defensive after being confronted calmly, & retaliating after mediation. I told my hall director that and asked if there is anything he can do. It would be ideal for me if she could find someone else to live with as the room is technically my room originally and I paid extra to have that room as it helps with my medical needs. My hall director said she would have to leave on her own free will because we can’t just get rid of her even though she’s the problem. 

I dont know what to do because I cannot live with this girl but I also don’t think I could find another room that is as accessible as the room I am in. So I feel like I just need to tough it out. I was told to give attitude back to her, but I really don’t think that’s a good idea as I am on the hall government board and I could easily get voted off my position. 

So.. am I the @sshole for being upset about all of this? Or am I overthinking all of these behaviors. I could really use some advice and I would love to hear all of your guys’s thoughts.

Thank you so much for reading all of this, I know it was a lot but I couldn’t leave out any details.

Feel hopeless and don't know what to do.,"Hi everyone. I don't really know where this post will go, but I need to get my thoughts out and hopefully find some way forward.



I am 47M and my partner is 42F. We were married a few weeks ago but have lived together for almost 10 years. We've had a long history of crazy fighting. For my part, I've never had a relationship with this level of fighting and I've found myself doing things I never thought I would be capable, like screaming at the top of my lungs and storming out of the house.



We had a tumultuous relationship from the start. I was an alcoholic with serious baby mama drama. There has always been a huge tension with me needing to be there for my daughter (who lives with my parents in the Midwest) and having to deal with her abusive, BPD mother, who has thankfully fallen off the face of the earth in the last 3 years.



It always seemed like ""if you would just stop drinking, everything would be wonderful"" I stopped drinking 10 years ago and if anything, the fighting got worse. We moved in together in California and for a brief time it seemed like we could be happy. But she never really gave CA a fair shot ""we could be happy but I hate living in this city"". 



The pandemic was hard for us. She stopped working fully (has now been unemployed for 8 years or so) and slowly all of our relationships dried up. Now I am the only person she talks to. Without really agreeing to it, I started to pay for everything. When our relationship started, I had a promising career but these terrible life problems and she was very independent and capable. Now I have the career and ""have my shit together"" and she has become totally dependent on me. 



High hygienic standards turned into full on germaphobia and (what I would term) OCD contamination anxieties. She started to spend all of her days on twitter and started to dabble in alt-right concepts. At the beginning of our relationship she would lecture me about feminism but now she's lecturing me about immigration and ideologies that I would call racist. At this point in my life I understand my values and beliefs, and this stuff is not it. We went from talking about cool stuff we like to arguing and complaining. 



She wakes up around 1 and we never do anything on the weekend. She doesn't like me to leave the house so I spend my days on my phone waiting around for her then we sit at the table and have coffee until it's time to maybe go to the grocery store. We would never have people over to our house. She doesn't like TV anymore because everything is a psyop so we don't even do that together. 



She started to talk about how our life had been ""ruined"" and if only we had gotten married how everything would have been fine. This only came up retrospectively... we never talked about our aspirations, just how things could have been different if we had been married years ago. We never talked about having kids, just how it was too late to have kids. 



I proposed. I got a better job. I got laid off, I got an even better job and we moved back to the Midwest, but in a different state where we don't know anyone. It seemed like we could finally be happy. No more dirty streets, no more ""scary"" unhoused people. I worked hard to establish myself at work. We bought a house in the country. We worked hard to get things set up. We eloped and felt in love. Even though I have no local friends and no life other than work and grocery shopping, at least it felt stable. 



Well, we've been living in this house for 3 months now. I've realized that hygiene concerns are at the heart of most of our fights. I generally concede to how she wants things done, but it's getting increasingly stringent and when things don't go her way (for example if I touch my slipper with my hand and don't immediately wash it) she will have a freak out. These freak outs are starting to look more like full on anxiety attacks to me with her screaming at the top of her lungs, totally inconsolable. 



When we try to talk about our relationship and issues, I always feel like she isn't trying to understand me. It seems like the only way to preserve some stability is for me to suppress my needs and emotions entirely, but then the resentment will invariably bubble up. 



I feel like I'm dying. My hair is falling out and my vision is failing. Is this really the life that is there for us?

People who don't know what's happened or what's going on. Even if people didn't mention anything even tangentally related (which they would), I still know they know, and that is enough of a distraction. 

Every moment alone is already consumed, I need the moments I spend with people to be a break mentally as much as they can.

But it's hard for people to handle. To know I've been to a party, or went to a luncheon, or went to a hobby meet, but won't talk to them on the phone or ""grab a coffee"". I love them, I want them around eventually. But I just can't now. But that's not really emotionally easy to accept from the other perspective.

How did you handle this. I feel like I can't spend time around them right now, I can't see them, I can't have live conversations with them on the phone or in person. I feel like I'm ending up alienating people and breaking down relationships just to have to build them back up later.",1,1764529811.0,GriefSupport,1,1.0,False

1paqjol,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1paqjol/is_contemplating_about_personal_experiences_with/,is contemplating about personal experiences with racism useful?,"Sometimes I feel noticing the way people treat me, versus the way they treat others is a very sad experience. For example, noticing the way my white friend gets smiles from random people around him like the cashier, people walking on the street, people at the club just being very talkative and friendly. Or how when my girlfriend gets random people on the street just doing nice things for her, striking up friendly conversations, or how other women are just very sweet and trusting for her.

Then I notice me - people will cross to the other side of the street at night when walking past me.  People will avoid sitting next to me in coffee shops. I sometimes get side eyed from strangers. Nobody is really smiley  friendly like cashiers or people walking by. I'm invisible. It's such a light and day difference noticing how people treat my friends versus me.

I wonder if it is even useful to think about this stuff. But how can I not? I literally sit down at a coffee shop, look up and literally only the seats next to me are open. I dress well, groom nice, not even ugly (maybe a 5-6/10). Yet people just avoid me

It is such a sad experience to be treated like this",1,1764529732.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False
1paqje0,https://www.reddit.com/r/onepagerpgs/comments/1paqje0/quest_board_30_games_in_30_days_challenge_day_29/,Quest Board | 30 Games in 30 Days Challenge | Day 29 - ONE MORE TO GO,"**The Game:**

[Quest Board](https://www.noplotonlylore.com/one-page-rpgs/quest-board)

Quest Board is a simple contemporary modern RPG until it isn’t. The idea is simple - there’s a quest board in a local grocery store where people post odd jobs and the like, but none of them are actually what they seem. Each one has a genre twist that pulls it out of the ordinary and into fantasy, science fiction, science fantasy, or horror. 

**What I Like About This One:** 

Honestly, the quest board mechanic can and maybe should be stolen for basically every standard quest or odd job type game. Quests tend to be pretty stale in  the way they’re followed, and this provides a framework for a Big Twist of various kinds. 

**What I’d Do Different Next Time:** 

I don’t love this one, tbh. The well’s a bit dry after posting a game every day for a month, and this one feels a bit like I’m scraping the bottom. The mechanics are simple and I’ve used variations of them all over this project so far, and this one kinda feels slapped together and generic because of that, I think.

1paqie6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1paqie6,Place review,"Tried this place — overall a pretty solid experience.

Ordered white sauce pasta and an iced tea. Pasta was genuinely good, but man, they served pav instead of garlic bread LOL. Iced tea was refreshing too, totally worth it. The next table ordered South Indian food with a cold coffee — looked high quality, and judging by their faces, probably tasted good too.

My total came to 462 Rs for pasta + iced tea (bill attached here)

Some quick highlights:

\- Quality food

\- Both indoor & outdoor seating

\- Humble and attentive staff

\- Pure veg with a dedicated Jain menu

\- Live music on weekends after 9:30 PM (mostly 90s Hindi hits)

\- Clean the washroom and kitchen",12,1764529646.0,Indore,6,1.0,False

1paqhx7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1paqhx7,Trapper Rework: Concept,"# Lately, I've seen talk about Trapper and I was just going to give my opinions on the subject and how I'd change Trapper on the post about it, but thought I'd just make my own.

>Honestly, in my opinion, Trapper's effectiveness highly depends on who you're going against. Trapper has a much easier time going against SoloQ, and will most likely win. However Trapper is guaranteed to lose when going against a SWF. So when considering how to change Trapper, the goal was to slightly nerf him against SoloQ but buff him against SWF while also just giving him changes that helps him in both.

# So here's how I'd rework Trapper.

**Buffs**

* Traps will still catch Survivors if another Survivor is attempting to disarm it.
* Trapper now has basekit Trapper Sack without the downside of not being able to pick up traps. (starts with 10 traps)
* Iri Stone is now basekit (With tweaks explained in the rework)
* Traps can now placed under hook again. (idk why this is still a thing now that you can unhook from any angle)

**Nerfs**

* Traps now flatten grass nearby making them easier to see
* Survivors can no longer be instantly downed when stepping in a trap while healthy. instead, they will enter the deep wound state if M1'd while trapped. (This wont be a big nerf when looking at the rework) (Injured/deepwounded survivors can still be downed)



# Rework - Entity's Favor | Power

>Yes, I know... Trapper is the last person the entity would help given the lore. but lets ignore that for right now as there could be lore written to explain why the entity has decided to help Trapper.

**Entity Touched Traps** \- Passive/M2

>Trapper no longer has to manually arm his traps.

* When pressing M2, Trapper now drops his trap on the ground exactly where he was standing when he pressed M2, after which, the entity immediately begins arming the trap.
* Anytime a Trap is being armed/rearmed, entity claws come out of the ground and pull the trap open. this takes **5 seconds**, after which the trap is rearmed. during this period, humming of the entity can be heard within 8m which gets louder the closer you are to the trap. and fog is emitted from the trap as well.
* Basekit Iri stone. instead of randomly arming a trap after 30s, the entity will automatically rearm any trap after 45s of being disarmed/triggered without consuming a favor. 

**Entity's Favor -** Ctrl

The Trapper can call upon the entity to grant him a one of four small favors to help him with his traps anywhere on the map. 

The Trapper gets 3 **Favors** Maximum. 1 Favors is replenished every 45s. and can be sped up with addons, or by 15s if a survivor disarms a trap.

>Similar to Vecna, Trapper can hold Ctrl and bring up a favor menu and select between one of four favors. ""Entity-rearm"" ""Entity-Collect"" ""Entity-Ambush"" ""Entity-Surprise""

**Entity Rearm**

* When selected, the Trapper can look at the aura of one of his traps on the map and it will be highlighted Yellow. Trapper can press **M1** to mark up to **3 traps** for **rearming** and then press **M2** to **confirm selection** and **start arming traps** and **consume a favor**.
* The favor can be cancelled by pressing Ctrl without consuming his favor. T
* Trapper can confirm selection with less than 3 traps marked, but will still consume a full favor.
* Trapper can still manually Rearm Traps. but no longer gets haste.

**Entity Collect**

* When selected, the Trapper can look at the aura of one of his traps on the map and it will be highlighted Yellow. Trapper can press **M1** to mark up to **3 traps** for collection and then press **M2** to **confirm selection** and **consume a favor**.
* Upon confirmation, small portals open above the traps with entity claws picking up the traps and pulling them up towards the portals. this takes about 8 seconds.
* If a survivor is disarming a trap when collection begins, the survivor is struck by the entity and loses a health state.
* Trapper can confirm selection with less than 3 traps marked, but will still consume a full favor.

**Entity Ambush**

* When selected, the Trapper can look at the aura of one of his traps on the map and it will be highlighted Yellow. Trapper can Press **M1** to **ready trap for ambush** and **consume a favor.** ^((If you have bloody coil, you can mark 2 and press M2 to confirm))
* Trapper can press **Ctrl** to **cancel the favor without consuming it**.
* When readied for ambush, small entity arms wrap around the jaws of the Trap and it sinks slightly into the ground, grass is no longer flattened. the trap will only be ready to ambush for 30s after which it returns to normal.
* The Trap will not disarm it self when a Survivor steps on it

**Entity Surprise**

* When selected the The Trapper can press M2 to call upon the entity to apply a buff to himself for 20s
* When Buffed, the Trapper no longer gets caught in his own trap
* Doesn't disarm traps when stepping over them
* If walking over disarmed traps, the Entity will begin silently rearming the trap.

  


# Rework - Addons

**Bloody Coil**

* Same as before
* Survivors caught disarming a trap when collection is called will also be collected by the entity.
* Increases disarm time by 1.5s
* Can mark an additional trap for ambush

**Tension Spring (Now Iri)**

* Survivors can once again be picked up and instantly downed when trapped.
* Reduces favors to 1.75 ^((You only get 1 favor, but the 0.75 allows the next favor to recharge to 75% so you only have to wait 15s for the next favor))
* increases favors replenish time by 15s

**Honing Stone (Basically New Iri Stone) (Still Very Rare)**

* Decreases Time required for traps to auto reset themselves by 15s. 
* Decrease rearm time by 1s
* increases replenish time for favors by 15s

**Trapper Bag**

* \+2 Traps
* Can mark an additional trap for rearming and collection
* Decrease replenish time for favors by 10s. (Favor replenish time cannot be decreased past 30s)

**Trapper sack**

* \+3 Traps
* Traps take an additional 15s until they rearm themselves
* Can mark an additional Trap for rearming and collection
* Decrease replenish time for favors by 10s (Favor replenish time cannot be decreased past 30s)

  
**Makeshift Wrap/Coffee Grounds/Lengthened Jaws**

* Retired

**Tar Bottle (Now Very Rare)**

* Applies 6% Hindered to survivors after escaping a trap for 10s

I’m into cosy vibes: late-night chats, sharing playlists, movie nights (where we watch 20 minutes and talk the rest), chai/coffee debates, and harmless flirting that makes you smile at your phone like an idiot. I love good humour, curious minds, and people who text with actual personality—not just “wyd.”

A little about me:  
\-I yap a lot abt sports(especially F1) and fashion(bear me w that)  
\- I get emotionally attached to songs way too fast.  
– I’m competitive in the most unserious games(like Monica(IYKYK))

Looking for someone around my age to start  fun, and good conversations.  If we vibe, maybe this winter won’t just be cold—it’ll be kinda cute.",0,1764529580.0,SFWr4rIndia,6,0.5,False

I’ll be visiting Berlin soon and I’d love to get some recommendations from people who know the city well.

**1. Coffee & breakfast**  
Where can I get a really good cappuccino? Any cafes you genuinely love for breakfast or brunch?

**2. Dinner**  
What are some nice places to have dinner - anything from casual to something a bit more special?

**3. Kebab**  
Since Berlin is known for kebabs, where can I get a *really good* one?

**4. Souvenirs**  
What souvenirs are worth bringing back? Maybe popular local chocolate, snacks, or anything uniquely Berlin?

**5. Winter-friendly places to visit**  
Since I’m coming in december, what are some good places or activities to check out? I

I bought a nice new KBG last week when they were $170.  What a deal!  First few days I was making 4 cups with 28g as per manual.  Draw Down was very slow, but figured that's just how it is.  My previous coffee makers do not have this problem.  

  
Now my partner is back in town, and I'm making 8 cups and 56g.  It overflows... every time.  Here is my checkbox exercise trying to fix it:

\#4 Melita filters, also does this with the filters it came with

Basket is all the way open ""O"" setting

Kin Grinder - Should be set to 90 clicks, I've pushed it as far as 110 clicks.  This is French Press level coarseness.  Makes no difference, still overflows.  Tried my girlfriends Comandante, same problem.

Fines are sifted.  Still overflows.

Tried RO water, tried remineralized, tried tap.  No softening system.

Ensured I'm not creasing the filter in such a way that it clogs the output hole, the crease goes behind, orifice hole is in front.

Yes it's fully open for the entire brew.

I have tried agitation, I've tried ZERO agitation, still overflows.

I've put pipe cleaner through the orifice, not clogged or stopped.

I've bent the metal bit that allows the orifice to open so it opens a bit more, still overflows.

With no coffee in the filter, water flows through the hole at a high-rate

Tried another batch of coffee from another roaster.  Same problem.  Bought a second bag from them, had them grind it for ""Drip"" coarseness.  Same problem.

I always grind right before brewing, not leaving them in the basket overnight or anything.

Pure water brew with filter is fine

  
Make it make sense, what else can I try?  I've already wasted like $20 in coffee trying this and I can't take much more. ",1,1764529367.0,Moccamaster,9,0.67,False
1paqdkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1paqdkb/glint_automates_microbakery_morning_magic_with/,Glint - Automates Micro-Bakery Morning Magic with Make and Square,"I just baked a golden automation for a one-woman micro-bakery in Budapest who was waking at 3 AM already exhausted from yesterday’s orders. Hand-writing tomorrow’s sourdough menu on the chalkboard, texting regulars at dawn, juggling DMs for special requests, and praying the butter delivery arrives on time was turning her love for bread into sleepless dread. So I created Glint, an automation that works while she sleeps, so the moment she opens the oven at 4 AM the whole day already smells like fresh kovászos kenyér and calm.

Glint uses Make as the night-shift baker and Square (her simple POS) to run the entire morning like clockwork. It’s warm, quiet, and runs on flour-dusted autopilot. Here’s how Glint rises:

1. Every evening at 20:00, Make counts tomorrow’s pre-orders from Square, Instagram DMs, and a tiny Google Form, then texts the flour supplier the exact kilo amount needed.
2. At 22:00 it auto-posts tomorrow’s menu to Instagram Stories with mouth-watering photos taken the day before and a “Sold out = sold out” disclaimer.
3. At 05:30 it sends one group SMS to the regulars’ list: “Fresh from the oven: 18 sesame, 12 walnut-raisin, 5 olive. Door opens 07:00. First come, first served.”
4. When the first customer pays with card, Square instantly prints a numbered ticket and pings the baker’s watch: “Customer #1 is here, smile ready.”
5. At 10:00 when everything is sold out, Glint posts a single Instagram story “SOLD OUT – see you tomorrow ♡” and texts the baker: “You made 112 400 Ft before coffee. Go take a nap.”

This setup is pure morning poetry for micro-bakeries, home bakers, or anyone selling small-batch love before sunrise. It turns 3 AM panic into peaceful, profitable ritual and lets the baker do what she was born to do: bake and smile.

Loves reading and movies — genre doesn’t matter as long as the plot delivers. I like listening to people online and exchanging thoughts when I can.

This case ruled that 18 U.S.C § 1014, which carries a penalty of up to 30 years in prison and up to a $1,000,000 fine, criminalizes all false statements to bank officers during loan/credit applications made for the purpose of influencing ""in any way"" their actions? Crucially, the court declined to read materiality into the statute, suggesting that any false statement, no matter how trivial or ineffective, qualifies so long as the defendant had the required state of mind of influencing ""in any way"" the actions of a long list of entities which is essentially designed to capture the bank itself and anybody who may be extending the loan.

1paq78x,https://www.reddit.com/r/janeausten/comments/1paq78x/the_way_people_talk_about_anne_de_bourgh_and_lady/,The way people talk about Anne de Bourgh and Lady Catherine is really starting to bother me,"The idea that Anne is only sick because her mother is overbearing and that she'd be 100% better if she somehow got away is sexist, regressive, and honestly, horrible to women, especially mothers.

In the early days of psychology (like 30 years ago), psychologists blamed nearly everything on mothers. They told women that autism was caused by mothers who were ""cold"" and schizophrenia was caused by disorganized mothers. It was and is harmful and disgusting. Even though psychology has gotten better, this idea still lingers.

Mothers feel so much guilt when something is medically wrong with their child because of this exact attitude. They think back over every mistake they might have made since conception because it *must* be their fault. They must have miscarried because they had three cups of coffee one day last week. Their kid must be sick because they forgot to put a hat on them when they were overwhelmed. Their kid doing poorly in school must be their fault because they haven't been perfect. And it's never the father's fault, always on the mother.

People were sickly in the past. For most of human history we didn't have medicine that worked! Anne is always presented in the book as just sickly (Jane Austen LOVES mocking the worried well, so we would get that). She could be that way just from a high fever. Children used to go blind and deaf because of a high fever that wouldn't come down. Anne is probably only alive at all because of her wealthy and attentive mother. We don't even have any evidence that Anne is unhappy or that she dislikes her mother. The woman never has quoted speech! (and that's not evidence, Georgiana never talks either, Jane Austen just does that sometimes). Making her mother into this evil woman that has made her daughter so ill is perpetuating a very harmful belief about mothers that still hurts so many people today.

This isn't a call-out to anyone in particular, but maybe just something to consider before saying that Anne's condition is all her mom's fault.",81,1764528929.0,janeausten,40,0.82,False

Now, initially I thought the coffee tasted good, but now months in, after cleaning it as well, I feel like the coffee tastes bland.. it tastes.. watery.. I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong.

I tried posting this on r/coffeestations a couple weeks ago, sans lights, but it got auto-mod booted because everything was so recognizable I forgot to comply with their rule about naming your equipment. Honestly, anything more than this would just be extra to me . . . pretty sure I could be happy with this setup for 10+ years.

I picked up the Bambino two years ago from a friend for $75, then added the Niche last year (just before tariffs kicked in) to replace my trusty Lido ET hand grinder. Between the two of them, I'm getting medium-light espresso roast shots that frequently rival the best cafes in my city. In terms of value for money, my goodness, what an upgrade a $15 Chinese metal tamper made over the stock plastic Breville tamper.

After committing to espresso, I stopped drinking pour-over to clean up the bar and keep it simple. With a single origin espresso usually on hand, if I need a warm beverage to-go in a thermos it's usually an Americano, or tea from my wife's stash.

Probably the most controversial part of my workflow is that rather than using a blind shaker or WDT tool, I just use a cocktail spoon to mix the grounds inside of the Niche dosing cup for 10 or so seconds before transferring to the portafilter.

I’ve been trying to froth milk using a 34oz Bodum French press (https://www.amazon.com/Bodum-Chambord-French-Press-Coffee/dp/B01N9HZJ8R/), but it’s not working…

My latte art skills also need work, but I feel like my milk frothing skills aren’t there either and need to start with some good milk! Current process:

1. Heat up non dairy (almond or oat) milk to around 60C
2. 2-3 large pumps above milk to below to infuse air
3. 30-60+ smaller pumps below milk to try to break up the air bubbles / foam
4. Pour out milk into a milk pitcher and at this point I use a spoon to remove the large amounts of foam and bubbles remaining

My issue is that after this process, there is still a lot of foam on the top of the milk and I can’t break up the bubbles. I end up scooping out lots of the top foam with a spoon.

I normally eat 1200 calories a day and this last week I ate between 1400 - 1500 several days. I also had some sugar and some fried food. I had company who thinks Chick-fil-A and Starbucks sweetened coffee are primary food groups. Even so I only had two chicken minis (176 calories) and a skinny cafe mocha.

Been helping make coffee at some parties and being asked if I'd help out with doing coffee for more charity events. Been hand grinding and love the J-Ultra, especially for my medium to light roasted beans. But it's time to electrify and use the J-Ultra as the backup.

Premeasure out my doses into test tubes the night before. And like to try and dial in different varieties for home use. So I'd still like a single dose oriented machine. Or at least a hopper machine that can do single doses reliably.

Been considering some machines approaching $1000 with some flexibility. Partner is supportive of making these charity events happen. It was her idea to upgrade the setup, so I want to strike while the holiday sales are going. I've considered both the Timemore 078s (or 078ssp). Or the Eureka Mignon Oro Pro in the past. Or should push the budget a bit and bump up to something like a Mazzer Philos?

With my previous focus on manual hand grinding in the past, I don't have a good baseline here for machines that will holdup for busy evenings of dozens of grinds over a couple of hours.

1papxec,https://www.reddit.com/r/askcarsales/comments/1papxec/lets_try_this_again/,Let's try this again.,"Long read, hope it helps someone. After selling cars for yrs, how I'd recommend shopping.

TL;DR

*Pick 1: Cheap, Fast, Good

*Come in prepared with research and confidence.

*Cheap: leverage knowledge, document everything, walk if needed.

*Fast: pay for service and efficiency, set expectations early.

*Good: blend research with experience, build long-term relationships.

*Inspect the car, protect your leverage, get and verify contracts.

Good, fast, and cheap — pick one. Decide what matters most for your situation and build your strategy around that. If you want the best deal (“cheap”), don’t expect great service — think McDonald’s. We’re willing to accept sideways, smashed meat and cheese blobs as long as it’s $2.

If you want the perfect vehicle (“fast”), your options shrink. If I have the best burgers in town and seating is limited, I have every right to charge what I want. As the value of a person, product, or place increases, the money becomes less relevant.

If you want consistency (“good”), think chain restaurant. Not extravagant, but smooth enough that you’re comfortable even with the occasional compromise.

If you have clear expectations and a plan, you will enter the dealership with confidence. They prey on the unprepared and run from research. I remember salespeople being terrified of a legal pad and computer printouts walking across the lot. Now you can put pressure on them to earn your business.

Cheap

If you want the lowest price, your presence is leverage and your research is your armor. Vehicle selection, trade appraisals (Carvana, CarGurus), finance rates, and rebates can all be done online. Avoid KBB instant cash offers and online requests — they just funnel you into emails and phone calls.

If you want to send emails to multiple dealers and let them compete, that’s fine, but know the race to the bottom often brings low-profit, high-drama customers. Don’t reward bad behavior of the say anything to get you in dealerships.

Car selection matters — if you haven’t researched your vehicle, they will try to switch you. Get multiple trade values: a couple online, one in person. CarMax is a good low-pressure offer to carry with you.

Take pictures of the numbers as soon as they’re presented. Many dealerships hide VINs or pull paperwork under the guise of “privacy” — it’s just an excuse.

If the numbers are too high, be direct but kind:

> “You have a couple minutes until I get to my car. Get me to $X or don’t bother calling me. I’ll spend more out of spite because you wasted my time.”

If they get within $500–$700 of your goal, it’s usually worth settling. In finance, let them present options. Ask for time to think if needed. Peace of mind is what you’re paying for more than anything.

Fast

When you go to a high-end restaurant, you’re a captive audience, but not a hostage. You can demand perfection. If mistakes happen, they should correct them immediately. These places understand your value.

While you should always lead with kindness, you’re backed by a mercenary. Having been on both sides throughout my career, I can tell you — I always worked harder for a dollar than for a smile.

Don’t spend hours over-researching things that are the dealership’s responsibility. Focus on trade value, financing, and your vehicle needs. Set expectations early:

> “This is a big purchase for us. Let’s make it easy. Show me how everything works, be efficient with my time, and keep my coffee full. Your tip today is based on service — I’m already sold on the car. Fair?”

Leverage small perks via surveys or referrals if possible. If the quality drops — slow, sloppy, or unable to answer questions — walk. Someone else will treat you like a gold-star customer.

Good

Blend research with experience. Make sense of dollars: finance rates, rebates, days on lot, trade value. Don’t waste hours learning the car; the salesperson has training and experience.

For trade value: two online (Carvana/CarGurus), one cash offer (CarMax).

Pick three dealerships with the inventory you want. Call two, plan to visit one. Ask the manager who the best salesperson is. Check Google reviews. Eliminate red flags early.

Work toward a fair deal but don’t burn bridges. If you plan on using them for service, keep the relationship positive.

> “I’m not here to pay everyone’s rent today — just a portion of yours potentially. Fair?”

You’re worth more to a dealership over time than in a single transaction. Their behavior will reveal who’s genuine.

General Tips

Drive and inspect the car. Avoid problems later.

Don’t show up desperate. Empty trunk, bald tires, low fuel — these are signals. Stay neutral.

Don’t commit early. Stay vague and non-committal.

Reward those who earn it. Paying a little more sometimes helps good dealerships survive.

Surveys are gold. Don’t fill them out until the transaction is fully complete. Contact the manufacturer if you don’t receive one.

Get copies of all contracts. Don’t leave without them.

Verify with the lender. Compare your contract line-by-line. Sometimes, numbers are adjusted after you leave.

I loved my time selling and training sales. I never had to lie to make a living, and I have zero issues selling within these processes. The industry created the reputation that made me successful — I did the opposite.

I’m sure there’s plenty to ask, critique, or poke fun at, so I look forward to reading the comments.

1papw4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/royalcaribbean/comments/1papw4k/review_of_odyssey_of_the_seas/,Review of Odyssey of the Seas,"# Background

I don’t usually post reviews as time usually gets away from me.  This time I have hours in Newark Airport, so... To give some context: I have over 100 cruise points, and my first cruise was in 1969 on the SS *United States.* Royal Caribbean wasn’t even my second, or third cruise line—unless you count Celebrity right after the acquisition.

I’ve sailed every Radiance-class ship except one, and *Jewel* remains my favorite. I’ve also sailed most Voyager-class and almost as many Oasis-class ships. This was my first Quantum-class experience.

Overall? A great cruise—but with some quirks.

# General Impressions

There were 1,500 kids on board (Thanksgiving week!), and we had my second least-favorite cruise director. Steve is not bad—just very quick-speaking (and I’m originally from NYC) and not very visible. He says “I’ll see you around the ship,” but you rarely do.

The ship itself feels different from other Royal classes. Not bad—just different. The layout isn’t as symmetrical, and it took some time to get oriented. Oasis-class felt intuitive right away. Quantum took some adjusting.

270 is a really fun venue—though I didn’t need an entire show telling me it cost $37 million. *The Book* felt like a venue searching for a show. On the other hand, the technology in the Royal Theater—lasers, drones—was phenomenal.

# Specific Areas

# North Star

Great experience—but a one-and-done for me. I’d do the free port-day version, but I don’t need to do it again in the middle of the ocean.

# Royal Theater

I actually liked **not** having a Broadway show here. I’ve seen most of them already when they tour my city. The technology made the shows worth seeing more than once.

# Main Dining Room

Different feel, with the open view to Deck 5, but it didn’t change much operationally. Food was above average for Royal.

# Café Two70

Very much like Central Park Café. Great roast beef sandwich (and if you know, you know).

# Windjammer

Lots of specialty coffee spots and a solid selection. Fresh, made-to-order Eggs Benedict next to the omelet bar was a nice surprise.

# Cabin

Deck 10 interior under Adventure Ocean. A bit noisy when they were moving things around—definitely not ideal for light sleepers. Cabin was small but had great storage. Oddly, no end table. My brother’s balcony cabin didn’t have one either (except outside).

# The Good

* Tons of outlets—including one next to the bed and USBs at the desk and on phone. Never ran out of places to charge things.
* Most shows (except *The Book*) were excellent.
* A refreshed, different feel overall—nice change of pace.
* Just enough motion to know you're at sea, but not enough to bother anyone.
* Food venues opened early and the staff, overall, was great.
* Cococay was excellent if you like beach days. Crew seemed genuinely happy to have us there. Floating bar crowd-watching was gold.
* Bern and the activities staff were amazing.
* Music Hall was a fun, unique venue.

# The Not-So-Good

* Thanksgiving + cooler weather = PACKED ship. Trivia and lounges filled up early, often with families taking over the bars.
* 1,500 kids onboard—enough said.
* No proper promenade or wraparound outdoor deck except the running track on Deck 15.
* A **lot** of smokers in outdoor seating areas.
* Smelled pot several times around the ship and at shows. Reported it, but it didn’t seem to make a difference. Drug dogs were checking bags in port, though.
* Nassau excursion was the **worst** I’ve ever had on any cruise line. Basically paid to be driven to places where they wanted us to spend money. Rum tour was nothing, chocolate stop felt annoyed we were there, and with 6 ships in port, everything was a zoo.
* Windjammer coffee service at table was hit or miss—but I just sat closer so it wasn’t a big deal.  I am used to people constantly filling cups!
* I missed Central Park—a quiet outdoor space with good wind protection.

# Wrap-Up

Overall: a great ship and a great crew. Capt Marek is great! I sailed specifically for *this* ship and would absolutely sail her again—but not on this itinerary, and probably never Nassau again.

I’ve done the Greek Isles twice with other lines, so I’ll skip that for now until I knock out the rest of my bucket list.

# What’s still on my “need to do” list:

* *Brilliance* (to complete the Radiance class)
* South America
* Africa
* Asia
* Canada & New England
* St. Petersburg, whenever the world calms down
* Try an Icon-class ship once the prices become rational

# Upcoming bookings:

* *Mariner* (Going to try first 5 day cruise in a very long time, worried it will not be long enough!)
* *Liberty* (Fjords in July)
* *Symphony* (week before Thanksgiving)

As for Thanksgiving cruises—only Radiance class from now on. I’ve done it, and the crowds are far more manageable.

What do you think about my general plans? Anything I’ve missed?,"Hello, I’m a frequent visitor to Oregon Coast. We usually stay in Lincoln City, and sometimes in Cannon Beach, but this time wanted to stay a bit closer to Depoe Bay because of King Tides.

Arriving on thursday afternoon and will sadly miss the high tide on that day but will stay until sunday so hopefully can check then out on other days.

We don’t have much time but here are some things I found through research:

 - king tides is a must. Planned on seeing them from the bridge in Depoe Bay. Any advice on parking?
Is there any other place near Newport where we can see them crashing on cliffs?

- Cape Perpetua - hoping to hike to the lookout

- Yaquina Head Lighthouse

- hoped to check out the Christmas boat parade

- thors well, devils churn

- some restaurants/coffee i found: Georgie’s, zurita, sorella, local ocean, surfing bean, nya beach cafe, myril, coca mocha. Want to go back to whale bites dor breakfast. Any other places worth checking out? (We are a carnivore and a vegetarian)

I also helped in a small way and I feel blessed that I didn’t face any harm from the floods.
What truly touched me was seeing people risk their lives to save others and even animals. Many refused to leave their homes because they didn’t want to abandon their pets. Veterinary services are accepting animals in danger, and some coffee shops are allowing people to stay inside without buying anything. Organisations have even considered women’s essentials such as sanitary pads, and creators are spreading awareness about choosing the right size for different needs. Blood donation banks are also full, as people have generously donated blood truly something to be grateful for. Of course, there were a few negative cases where like an elderly couple who left their dogs behind, and people rushing to supermarkets and stocking up without thinking of others. But despite that, the majority showed incredible kindness and humanity.Sri Lankan people have the warmest hearts. I’ve visited other countries, but I’ve never seen hospitality like this.

1paplrt,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelLinks/comments/1paplrt/tomb/,Tomb,"She was so foolish to think that marriage could change a biker.
A husband who didn't leave their bed in the middle of the night to hang with his buddies, and women willing to screw a married man, shouldn't be something Nina had to ask for.
But here she was.
It was only 2 a.m. 
Tomb's Harley was gone.
He'd actually left their bed to go out.
And now she couldn't go back to sleep.
Oh, now she was mad.
She thumbed out a message.
Nina: Where are you?
Tomb: I'm at the clubhouse
Nina: Are you for real? It's after 2.
Tomb: Something came up. Will explain later, baby.
3 a.m. came and went. So did five and then six.
It escalated from her toes until the top of her head felt like it might explode.
She was about to give Tomb the biggest wake-up of his life. She threw the three large bags containing all of her husband's belongings down in front of him.
""You wanna be single? Tell the club sluts they have my blessing.""
————————
Nina
It was an awful, sickening pain in Nina's heart to know before the day was out, she would tell her husband she wanted a trial separation.
Want was a loose term since she was still madly in love with Tomb.
But the decision hadn't been straightforward. It was long thoughts and sleepless nights alone in their bed. Something she'd agonized over for months. If she left it any longer, she'd change her mind just like she had five million times already because her heart was weak.
This time, Nina was letting her head rule.
And her head was telling her their marriage wasn't maturing at all. Two years in, and it was as if they were two single people who screwed a lot but then went back to their separate lives. Approaching forty-one, Nina should have been shrewder to realize that getting married didn't change a person.
She loved that man. God, did she.
Some days, her love for Tomb felt like it would break her rib cage open, too big to keep inside her chest. If she could solve world hunger with the love she felt for Tomb, then no one would starve ever again.
If love was a beautiful, perfect thing, people chased their whole lives, why did it hurt so much?
She'd seen him and wanted him instantly.
According to Tomb, it had been the same for him.
They were in bed only hours after meeting. That showed the level of chemistry they had. What they still had.
It was that chemistry and sexual attraction that gave Nina pause for weeks. How could she be so unhappy and yet get laid regularly with the best orgasms? Some women would call her a greedy hooker for wanting more from the relationship.
Maybe she was.
Maybe she was ungrateful.
Tomb wasn't a wife abuser.
He was far from greedy with his money. Whatever she wanted, she could have. He was a friendly guy, and everyone loved Tomb. Easy-going, funny, and the best protector.
It could be she was expecting the complete package when that didn't exist outside of movies and books.
Sighing, she stopped in her wide hallway in front of the mirror by the front door. It was her last chance to check her appearance before she left the house for the day.
Nina knew Tomb loved how she looked. The banked flames in his eyes told her how attracted he was to her petite five-foot-one height, golden blonde hair down to her shoulders, helped only a little with low lights. Pursing her lips, she slicked on a thin, clear gloss coating to make her them shine. She smiled absently, remembering Tomb's face covered in her red lipstick not so long ago.
Not only his face wore the red color that night. But she couldn't think about his wonder shaft or how he used it to mesmerize her into submission.
She headed out the door with everything she needed, remembering to set the house alarm.
The stomach ache she'd carried all week like it was a symptom of her guilt, irritated Nina most of the morning until she drowned it in enough coffee to sink a ship.
Carrying bucket loads of guilt because she felt like a failure.
She'd obviously failed at being a wife.
It could be some people weren't meant to be married.
Now, she contemplated leaving him because it took two to make a marriage work.
Her answer, when he'd proposed, had been uncomplicated, like she'd waited her whole life for that question.
Now, she didn't know if she'd made the right decision.
More than ever lately, she'd enjoyed the quietness of the salon once she'd opened up. Not that Tomb was home to cause noise. He'd already left before she was awake.
She felt like she was turning into a silent nag, racking up negatives in his marriage tally. Not spending any peaceful time together each morning was one of them.
If they weren't having intercourse, Tomb was often out of the house doing his own thing.
She'd sold her condominium to live in his spacious three-bedroom bungalow. And though she had free rein to redecorate, it was sometimes like she was just an overnight visitor. A booty call with space in the double walk-in closet.
Lost in her racing thoughts, she jumped at the knock on the door. Esther was always early.
""It's hotter than Satan's armpits. We're gonna fry today, doll."" she dumped her purse and coffee tumbler on the work side. Esther was in Nina's age bracket, with three kids and a deadbeat boyfriend, long in the past. They'd been fast friends ever since Esther interviewed for the position of nail technician.
Not long after the pair set up the salon for the day, Nina's other stylist arrived fashionably late, as always. Ross greeted them as enthusiastically as he did every morning. ""Hello, you intercourse kittens. What kind of day are we having today?""
""Not siren-kittenish, that's for sure."" Scoffed Esther, rolling her eyes as she prepared her workstation.
""Didn't get laid again?"" asked the twenty-something, brushing black hair out of his eyes. Ross claimed it was his God-given queer right to butt into their intercourse lives. Or non-existent intercourse life, in Esther's case. It was many failed attempts to set Esther up with blind dates, but Ross wouldn't give up trying to find her a man.
""If you mean did I drive one kid to a basketball game and another to a gamer convention and then watched five episodes of True Crime while painting my toenails, then yeah, I got laid.""
Ross clicked his tongue, shaking his head. ""It's a sad day when you're not getting that body rocked at least twice a night, cupcake.""
""My rocking days are behind me.""
""This one,"" he pointed at Nina, who was minding her own business but always got brought into their spats. ""is your age and is getting her world rocked by the hottest man on earth."" Ross wasn't finished. ""She walks in here bow-legged. He's that good.""
""Nina is married."" Answered Esther.
Ross made a sarcastic noise from his throat. ""That means screw all, cupcake. Tell her, Nina.""
""Don't bring me or my intercourse life into it. I've hardly sipped coffee yet. And stop calling my husband hot, or I'll tell Bastian what you're saying.""
""Bas would agree; he fancies Tomb, too. We've agreed if Tomb ever comes to our side, he will be our throuple.""
Choking on a sip of coffee, Nina coughed before she met the humored eyes of her soon-to-be-fired colorist.
""At least that put color in your cheeks. What's up, cupcake? You're not your usual lively self this morning."" He winked.
""Less of the cupcake,"" she tried to reprimand, but smiled with it. ""Remember, I'm your boss; I could fire you anytime.""
""Not when I'm the best colorist this Podunk town has ever seen. Now answer, madame boss lady. Everything okay?""
""Everything is fine, Ross."" Nina was saved from further explanation when the receptionist and intern arrived. Minutes later, the salon team assembled, and the day was ready to start.
Thank God for her thriving business, because it meant Nina was kept busy. It was what gave her a purpose. Nina's salon was coming up on its tenth year, and thankfully, she'd come through dips and scares with the economy. But like death and taxes, everyone always wanted their hair to look nice, so while other shops around her on Main Street had come and gone, Nina's survived.
On a break, she half listened to Ross and Bethany, her quiet yet hardworking intern, when a text buzzed.
She frowned, seeing who it was from.
Tomb: Princess, gotta go on a run. I'll be home late.
Her heart sank as she kept her eyes on the screen to see if he'd send another text. Maybe love or smoochs, or he'd miss her. Nothing came.
They weren't ships passing in the night at this point. Their boats weren't even in the same ocean.
Nina: No problem. I'm going out with the girls. Be safe. XX
She missed that man more than she could say. And she had to wonder if he missed her at all. Slipping the phone into her back pocket, she tried to push aside the hurt.
Something had to change, and soon, before she lost herself to a deep-seated depression.
But Nina didn't know if she could put into motion something that would break her heart. It was unimaginable to think of hurting Tomb, not when he owned her completely. It was unthinkable to make her big man frown.
It hadn't always been this way.
Not in those first few days and weeks when they'd been so obsessed with each other.
She wanted that back.
She wanted more. And Nina didn't believe she was wrong about needing more.

I’m out here on Reddit like a raccoon holding a shiny object, hoping it turns out to be friendship and not a discarded LaCroix can.

I’m looking for people who want to connect in that real, warm, “we both survived another day of late-stage capitalism and deserve a gold star or at least a high-five gif” kind of way.

A few things about me: • I read and write like I’m being chased by a deadline no one actually gave me. • I dip my fries in Frostys because that is how God intended potatoes to be enjoyed. • I pour liquids into bottle caps and pretend they’re shots, because sometimes you just need to feel like you’re at a club even though it’s Tuesday at 3pm and your “drink” is orange Gatorade. • I invent elaborate backstories for strangers at Target, usually involving secret royal bloodlines, cursed heirlooms, or mild tax fraud. • I embarrass my loved ones using offensive-to-no-one but highly dramatic accents in public. • I hunt for new music like it’s treasure, and when I find a song that emotionally drop-kicks me, I listen to it while curled up in the shower like I’m in an A24 coming-of-age movie.

I’m hoping to meet people who are… real. Real complex. Real simple. Real funny. Real soft where it matters. Real in need (or want) of a connection that’s based on mutual kindness, random serotonin drops, and daily attempts to make each other smile.

Bonus points if you are also powered by a chaotic blend of coffee, energy drinks, and pure stubborn willpower — the kind of person who wakes up, cracks open a caffeinated potion, and thinks, “Yes. I choose life.”

If you’re the type who finds joy in tiny things — like the perfect playlist, a particularly chaotic group chat, or the moment your caffeine finally kicks in and you achieve temporary godhood — we’ll get along beautifully.

So yeah… if you’re looking for a friend who’s funny, genuine, occasionally poetic, occasionally feral, and always up for a laugh, send me a message.

My wife says that everything I make with the MM is too watery. I’ve tried different beans, amount, grind size, and all of the tips and tricks. The only decent coffee I’ve made with the MM has to be served black which hasn’t been great and had a “dry” aftertaste feel. Any creamer added instantly turns it to garbage.

1. The highway is not that bad. Google maps are exaggerating. Most of the detours are side roads of the highway and are free flowing. If you drive on Pune roads, even those detours are an upgrade. Just stay on the highway where all the traffic is flowing even if Google maps show otherwise. 

2. The best part of the trip is going to be an hour after you leave Kolhapur. The portion of Amboli ghat, Ajaara, Sindhudurg is the best. The roads are very nice and the scenery is great. I particularly liked the small, forest-y town of Sindhudurg. 

3. I halted at Kolhapur and it came out to be a good decision. Ordered their mutton Thali and man, it became one of the highlights of my trip. Just perfect. Even the town is not bad. Found a Starbucks when I craved good coffee. Had decent cafés and markets. The vibes were better than Pune at least. 

4. Just before Goa, maps may ask you to take a short cut. Ignore and stay on the main roads.

5. The worst part of your trip? You guessed it right. It is going to be your travel within Pune and its outskirts. Leave early to minimise that. Nothing beats the shittiness of Pune roads. ",38,1764527285.0,pune,1,0.98,False
1paphou,https://www.reddit.com/r/italianlearning/comments/1paphou/bilingual_blitz_29_six_short_exercises_to_test/,Bilingual blitz [29] (six short exercises to test your Italian),"**THE RULES**

Without looking at the comments, can you provide translations for these short (**but challenging!**) sentences (3 English-Italian, 3 Italian-English)? I’ll evaluate your responses and give you feedback. The exercise is designed to be intermediate/advanced level, but beginners and lower intermediate learners are welcome if they feel like testing the scope of their current knowledge. *I might take a few days to answer*, but I will read and evaluate all participants.  

**There is no time limit to submit your answer**. If you want to go back to the first ever edition and work your way up from there, you can. Just know that I usually prioritise more recent posts.

If you’re not sure about a particular translation, just go with it! The exercise is meant to weed out mistakes, this is not a school test!  
**If multiple translations are possible, choose the one you believe to be more likely give the limited context** (I won’t deduct points for guessing missing information, for example someone's gender, unless it's heavily implied in the sentence).

**THE TEST**

Here are the sentences, *vaguely* ranked from easiest to hardest in each section (A: English-Italian, B: Italian-English).

**A1)** ""Those cardboard boxes look very unstable to me""  
**A2)** ""Humanity isn't ready for this dangerous an invention!""  
**A3)** “Which direction is the North Pole again?”  

**B1)** ""Sei la cosa più bella che mi sia mai capitata""  
**B2)** ""Fu vera gloria? Ai posteri l’ardua sentenza"" (Manzoni)  
**B3)** ""Ha dato a tutti dei fannulloni, al che un po' mi sono risentito pure io""  

**Current average**: N/A (median N/A)  
**Estimated answer time**: 1 day (for those submitting now)

**EVALUATION (and how to opt out)**

If you manage to provide a translation for all six sentences, I'll give you a score from 1 to 10 (the standard evaluation system in Italian schools). Whatever score you receive, don't take it too seriously: this is just a game! However, if you feel like receiving a score is too much pressure anyway, you can just tell me at the start of your comment and I'll only correct your mistakes without evaluating.

Based on the results so far, here’s the usual range of scores depending on the level of the participants. Ideally, your objective is to score within your personal range or possibly higher:

**Absolute beginners**: ≤4  
**Beginners**: 4 - 5  
**Early intermediate**: 5 - 6.5  
**Advanced intermediate**: 6.5 - 8  
**Advanced**: ≥8  
**Natives**: ≥9 (with good English)  
*Note: the exact range might change depending on the difficulty of this specific exercise. I try to be consistent, but it’s very hard*

**TO SUPPORT ME**

Since I've been asked a couple of times by now, I've recently set up a [Ko-Fi page](https://ko-fi.com/crown85469). If you appreciate what I do and want to offer me a coffee as thanks, feel free to do so. **Only** donate if you have money to throw away: I'm doing this because I like it, any money I get from it is just an extra bonus and I won't treat people differently based on whether they decide to donate or not.

**IF YOU ARE A NATIVE ITALIAN SPEAKER**

You can still participate if you want (the exercise is theoretically symmetrical between Italian and English), but please keep in mind that these sentences are designed to be particularly challenging for *non* native speakers, so they might be easier for you. For this reason, I’d prefer it if you specified that you are a native speaker at the beginning of your comment: I’m collecting statistics on how well learners score on these tests in order to fine tune them (and personal curiosity), so mixing up the results from natives and non-natives will probably mess it up.

1paphdp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tier1Civ/comments/1paphdp/the_21st_century_library_a_proposition_for/,The 21st Century Library: A Proposition for Post-Institutional Knowledge Infrastructure,"  
  
\## Executive Summary  
  
This document proposes a fundamental reimagining of the public library as civic intellectual infrastructure for the 21st century. Rather than buildings that house books, we envision a distributed mesh network of knowledge nodes that integrate physical and digital resources, expert consultation, collaborative workspace, specialized equipment, and computational infrastructure.  
  
The system addresses a critical gap in modern society: accessible intellectual infrastructure outside the constrained models of academia and corporate R&D. It creates a «third space» for knowledge work that serves everyone from curious teenagers to retired experts, from amateur researchers to professional engineers working on side projects.  
  
—  
  
\## The Core Problem  
  
\*\*Current Reality:\*\*  
Humanity possesses unprecedented knowledge and computational tools, yet serious intellectual work remains gatekept by two primary institutions:  
  
— \*\*Academia:\*\* Credential-dependent, slow, hierarchical, publish-or-perish incentives, disconnected from application  
— \*\*Corporate:\*\* Proprietary knowledge, profit-driven, competitive rather than collaborative, results locked behind IP walls  
  
\*\*What’s Missing:\*\*  
A third model for intellectual work that is:  
— Accessible without credentials  
— Public good oriented   
— Collaborative by default  
— Infrastructure-supported  
— Cross-domain and cross-generational  
  
\*\*The Metaphor:\*\*  
Right now, we have «thousands of suns burning alone» — autodidacts, retired experts, curious amateurs, between-jobs specialists, unconventional thinkers — all doing intellectual work in isolation because there’s no infrastructure that supports them.  
  
\*\*The Vision:\*\*  
Build civic intellectual infrastructure that enables synthesis rather than fission. Transform isolated individual efforts into collaborative knowledge networks.  
  
—  
  
\## System Architecture  
  
\### 1. Distribution Model: The Mesh Network  
  
The system operates as a \*\*mesh network of nodes\*\* rather than a hub-and-spoke model.  
  
\*\*Regional Structure:\*\*  
— Multiple nodes distributed across a region (city, metropolitan area, or rural region with sufficient population)  
— Each node maintains a working collection based on local demand  
— One regional «big books storage» depot handles long-tail collection  
— Subscribers can request books delivered to any node (next-day delivery via app or in-person request)  
  
\*\*Mesh Topology Benefits:\*\*  
— No single point of failure  
— Load balancing (resources shared peer-to-peer)  
— Organic growth (add nodes without redesigning system)  
— Resource optimization (expensive equipment shared across mesh)  
— Resilience (node offline? Others continue functioning)  
  
\*\*Multi-Scale Operation:\*\*  
— \*\*Local mesh:\*\* Nodes within region coordinate directly  
— \*\*Regional mesh:\*\* Neighboring regions can coordinate bilaterally  
— \*\*Global mesh:\*\* Optional global coordination layer facilitates distant connections  
  
\### 2. Node Modularity  
  
Nodes are \*\*modular\*\* by design, allowing reconfiguration based on changing local requirements without years-long institutional processes.  
  
\*\*Core Module (Required):\*\*  
— Physical book collection (working inventory)  
— Digital access (tablets with full catalog)  
— IT infrastructure  
— Workspace (desks, quiet areas)  
— High-bandwidth internet (multiple ISPs for resilience)  
  
\*\*Optional Modules:\*\*  
— \*\*Living quarters:\*\* Studio apartments for rotating librarians  
— \*\*Café/diner:\*\* Food service, informal collaboration space  
— \*\*Maker space:\*\* 3D printers, electronics labs (where demand exists)  
— \*\*Equipment modules:\*\*  
  — Class 1: Common specialized equipment (oscilloscopes, microscopes)  
  — Class 2: Rare/expensive equipment (spectrometers, advanced testing gear)  
— \*\*Events module:\*\* Conference/hackathon spaces  
— \*\*Gym module:\*\* Physical fitness (larger nodes)  
— \*\*School integration spaces:\*\* Youth-specific areas  
  
\*\*Module Specification Approach:\*\*  
Each module defined abstractly by:  
— Functional requirements (what it does)  
— Resource requirements (power, data, space, ventilation)  
— Interface requirements (connections to core + other modules)  
— Access/safety requirements (training, supervision)  
  
This allows local implementation variation while maintaining system-wide compatibility.  
  
\### 3. Tiered Nodes (Activity-Based)  
  
Nodes scale organically based on actual usage, not predetermined hierarchy.  
  
\*\*Tier 1 (High Activity Hub):\*\*  
— High subscriber density  
— Heavy equipment utilization  
— Frequent expert consultations  
— Regular events  
— Full module suite  
— More living quarters  
— Regional anchor  
  
\*\*Tier 2 (Active Node):\*\*  
— Moderate subscriber base  
— Core + some specialized modules  
— Regular consultation hours  
— Occasional events  
— Some living quarters  
— Balanced capabilities  
  
\*\*Tier 3 (Access Point):\*\*  
— Smaller subscriber base  
— Core modules only  
— Visiting expert hours (periodic)  
— Primary digital access + workspace  
— Relies on mesh for specialized equipment  
— Minimal/no living quarters  
  
\*\*Key Principle: Tiers are fluid.\*\*  
— Nodes scale up/down based on demand  
— Resources shift as activity patterns change  
— Prevents both overbuilding and underserving  
— Metrics: subscriber count, visits, equipment bookings, consultation hours, event attendance, project output  
  
—  
  
\## Knowledge Access Layer  
  
\### 1. Physical + Digital Books  
  
\*\*Physical Collection:\*\*  
— Each node maintains working collection based on local demand patterns  
— Regional depot houses comprehensive long-tail collection  
— App-based reservation system (next-day delivery to any node)  
— Optimized for space efficiency without sacrificing accessibility  
  
\*\*Digital Access:\*\*  
— Tablets in each node provide immediate access to full catalog  
— Serves both «need reference now» and «want to read over time» use cases  
  
\### 2. Computational Infrastructure  
  
\*\*LLM Access:\*\*  
— Institutional subscriptions to major commercial LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, etc.)  
— Solves individual cost barrier ($60-200/month across providers)  
— Local LLM models on small data center infrastructure for privacy-sensitive work  
  
\*\*Fine-Tuning as a Service:\*\*  
— Subscribers can request fine-tuning of local models for specific projects (additional fee)  
— Most people/small organizations lack expertise and compute for this  
— Library provides both capability and consultation  
  
\*\*Small/Medium Data Centers:\*\*  
— Collocated with physical nodes where economically feasible  
— Provides compute resources for local LLM models  
— Storage and computing space can be sub-rented to subscribers for projects  
— Amortizes fixed costs while creating additional revenue  
  
Ядро идеи: Библиотека — это не склад готовых знаний, а мастерская (workshop), где предоставляются инструменты для их обработки, осмысления и генерации новых.  
1. Инструменты познания (Tools for Knowing)  
  
Это системы, которые помогают анализировать, структурировать и взаимодействовать с существующей информацией.  
  
Текущее воплощение (2024+): Доступ к коммерческим и открытым LLM, поисковым системам нового поколения, базам знаний с семантическим поиском.  
  
Будущее-proof принцип: Библиотека обеспечивает институциональный доступ к самым передовым когнитивным усилителям (cognitive augmenters), будь то продвинутые системы семантического поиска, модели искусственного интеллекта следующего поколения (после LLM) или интерфейсы «мозг-компьютер» для навигации по информации. Это решает проблему стоимости и сложности для индивидуального пользователя.  
  
2. Инструменты создания знаний (Tools for Knowledge Creation)  
  
Это системы, которые позволяют адаптировать, перепрофилировать и затачивать инструменты познания под специфические задачи сообщества, создавая, таким образом, новое, специализированное знание в форме алгоритма.  
  
Текущее воплощение (2024+): Сервис тонкой настройки (fine-tuning) локальных LLM-моделей под конкретные проекты (исторический анализ, лингвистика, медицинские данные).  
  
Будущее-proof принцип: Библиотека предоставляет вычислительные ресурсы, хранилища данных и экспертизу библиотекарей-IT-специалистов для кастомизации и создания новых инструментов. Если сообществу историков нужен AI-ассистент, обученный на архивах конкретного региона, библиотека предоставляет «станок» и «инженера» для его «сборки». Это превращает пассивных потребителей информации в активных создателей инструментов для её осмысления.  
  
Инфраструктура мастерской (Workshop Infrastructure)  
  
Малые и средние дата-центры: Колокация с узлами обеспечивает вычислительную мощность для работы этих инструментов, особенно для задач, требующих конфиденциальности данных.  
  
Аренда ресурсов: Пользователи могут арендовать не только доступ к AI, но и вычислительное время и место для хранения данных для своих исследовательских проектов.  
  
\### 3. Specialized Equipment  
  
\*\*Distribution Logic:\*\*  
— Not every node needs every piece of equipment  
— Expensive specialized equipment (spectrometers, advanced microscopes, testing gear) distributed across mesh  
— Reservation/scheduling system similar to book system  
— Equipment mobility: some items can rotate between nodes based on demand  
  
\*\*Examples:\*\*  
— Lab equipment (microscopes, spectrometers, oscilloscopes)  
— Audio/video production gear  
— Measurement and testing tools  
— 3D printers and fabrication equipment  
— Electronics labs (where demand exists)  
  
\*\*Integration:\*\*  
— Blueprint/design libraries for 3D printing shared across system  
— Equipment training provided by librarians  
— Safety protocols and supervision systems  
  
—  
  
\## The Expert Librarian Model  
  
\### Reimagining the Librarian Role  
  
\*\*Historical Context:\*\*  
The Chief Librarian of Alexandria was among the most powerful intellectuals in the ancient world — gatekeeper and synthesizer of human knowledge, advisor to scholars and rulers, curator of civilization’s intellectual output. Modern librarians were reduced to «person who checks out books» as the role failed to evolve with technology.  
  
\*\*21st Century Restoration:\*\*  
Librarians as expert consultants, knowledge brokers, collaboration facilitators, and domain specialists.  
  
\### Three-Tier Structure  
  
\*\*Junior Librarians:\*\*  
— Collection management  
— User support and training  
— Equipment supervision  
— Basic research assistance  
— Entry-level role with growth path  
— Access to expert mentorship for their own development  
  
\*\*Mid-Level Librarians:\*\*  
— Specialized domain knowledge  
— Project consultation  
— Advanced training provision  
— IT specialists maintaining/improving systems  
— Fine-tuning local LLM models  
— Internal project work  
  
\*\*Senior Librarians (Domain Experts):\*\*  
— \*\*Key Innovation:\*\* Practicing professionals working part-time as knowledge consultants  
— Real, current expertise (not academic/theoretical only)  
— Located in nodes near where they live  
— Examples: civil engineers, doctors, nuclear physicists, historians, linguists, materials scientists  
  
\*\*Expert Librarian Model Benefits:\*\*  
  
\*For the System:\*  
— Real, current expertise from active practitioners  
— Cost-effective (part-time, distributed salary load)  
— Natural geographic spread  
— Knowledge stays updated  
— Diverse specializations without massive staff  
  
\*For the Professionals:\*  
— Supplemental income (competitive hourly rate)  
— Give back to community  
— Teach/mentor without academic bureaucracy  
— Cross-pollinate their own work with other domains  
— Flexible schedule (4-8 hours/week)  
— Professional development and prestige  
  
\*For Subscribers:\*  
— Access to practicing civil engineer, not just someone who studied it  
— Current industry knowledge  
— Real-world problem-solving approaches  
— Network connections into professional communities  
  
\### Consultation Model  
  
\*\*Access Modes:\*\*  
— \*\*Online:\*\* Video consultation, expert can be anywhere in mesh  
— \*\*Offline:\*\* In-person at node, builds local relationships  
— \*\*Scheduled:\*\* Book consultation hours through app  
— \*\*Walk-in:\*\* Junior/mid librarians available for immediate questions  
  
\*\*Compensation:\*\*  
— Competitive hourly rate  
— Prestige and recognition (restoration of librarian status)  
— Professional development opportunities  
— Participation in knowledge community  
  
—  
  
\## The Rotation System  
  
\### Preventing Echo Chambers  
  
\*\*The Problem:\*\*  
Static expert assignments create echo chambers through:  
— Repeated interactions with same small group  
— Local consensus hardening into unquestioned truth  
— Methodological habits becoming dogma  
— Blind spots reinforcing each other  
  
\*\*The Solution: Voluntary Rotation\*\*  
  
Expert librarians can rotate between nodes for 1-4 week residencies:  
— Brings fresh perspectives and methodologies  
— Questions local assumptions  
— Forces articulation of tacit knowledge  
— Cross-pollinates between regional sub-networks  
— Prevents local power concentration  
— Creates «visiting expert» programming  
  
\*\*Living Quarters Infrastructure:\*\*  
Studio apartments or small flats in/near larger nodes enable:  
— Comfortable short-term residencies  
— Low-friction rotation (no housing logistics burden)  
— Attracts experts to volunteer for rotation  
— Enables international expert exchanges  
  
\*\*Benefits:\*\*  
— Smaller/rural nodes can host specialized experts temporarily  
— Expertise flows through network like books flow  
— System becomes dynamic rather than static  
— Prevents personality cults or gatekeeping  
— Sabbatical alternative for academics/professionals  
  
—  
  
\## Community Knowledge Network  
  
\### 1. Community Consultation Pool  
  
Beyond professional librarians, subscribers themselves become knowledge resources.  
  
\*\*Two Categories:\*\*  
  
\*\*Vetted Consultants:\*\*  
— Passed assessment/verification  
— Higher visibility in matching algorithm  
— May receive small stipend or credit system  
— Can charge for time  
— Professional-level consultation  
  
\*\*Unvetted Contributors:\*\*  
— Informal knowledge sharing  
— No credentials needed  
— Purely opt-in participation  
— Coffee-level exchanges  
— Low-stakes peer learning  
  
\*\*This creates spectrum from casual to professional knowledge exchange within single system.\*\*  
  
\### 2. Project Matching (Privacy-Respecting)  
  
\*\*Opt-In System:\*\*  
— Subscribers can enable project visibility (privacy toggle is critical)  
— LLMs and librarians analyze: research topics, tools used, problems being solved, expertise available  
— System surfaces connections: «Subscriber #4721 at Node 8 is working on similar materials analysis. Want introduction?»  
  
\*\*Transforms library from infrastructure to active network:\*\*  
— Serendipitous connections that wouldn’t happen otherwise  
— Collaborative opportunities across nodes  
— Reduces duplicate effort  
— Accelerates problem-solving  
  
\*\*Privacy Protection:\*\*  
— Default: projects private  
— Opt-in required for matching  
— Control over what information shared  
— Respects proprietary/sensitive work  
  
\### 3. Cross-Domain Integration  
  
\*\*The Physical Space Advantage:\*\*  
  
Same evening, same node:  
— Teens playing D&D campaign (learning probability, worldbuilding)  
— Nuclear + civil engineer discussing reactor housing design  
— Social scientist + linguist mapping language-policy interactions  
— Retired teacher + teenager prototyping educational game  
— Someone quietly reading physical book  
— Group testing water samples with shared spectrometer  
  
\*\*Unexpected Cross-Pollination:\*\*  
— Nuclear engineer becomes D&D dungeon master for teens  
— Teens offer linguistic expert insights on evolving slang  
— Social scientist observes D&D group dynamics for research  
— Power dynamics invert fluidly (expert becomes student)  
  
\*\*This is how genuine interdisciplinary breakthroughs happen\*\* — not in planned initiatives, but through accidental collision of different knowledge domains in shared space.

\## Youth Integration  
  
\### Breaking the Credential Barrier  
  
\*\*Traditional Model:\*\*  
«Study hard → university → degree → grad school → access to experts at 26 → start real work at 30»  
  
\*\*New Model:\*\*  
«Have question/interest? Here’s expert, here’s equipment, here’s project space. Start now.»  
  
\*\*Integration with Schools:\*\*  
  
\*\*For Students:\*\*  
— 14-year-old interested in marine biology? Direct consultation with actual marine biologist  
— 16-year-old building renewable energy project? Access to electrical engineer + testing equipment  
— Curious kid asking «how does this work?» gets real answers from real experts  
  
\*\*Infrastructure:\*\*  
— School group spaces in nodes  
— Educational programming  
— Youth-appropriate access levels  
— After-school intellectual community  
  
\*\*Ropes, Ladders, and Guardrails:\*\*  
— \*\*Ropes/ladders:\*\* Access paths (consultation hours, equipment reservations, project spaces)  
— \*\*Guardrails:\*\* Guidance (junior librarians helping with methods, experts preventing dangerous mistakes)  
  
\*\*Philosophical Core:\*\*  
Invite every individual human into the giant «humanity intellectual process.» Don’t warehouse human curiosity until it’s «qualified.»  
  
\*\*Talent Pipeline:\*\*  
Today’s curious teenager → tomorrow’s junior librarian → next decade’s expert librarian. They never have to leave the system to develop.

\## Events and Community Building  
  
\### Multi-Scale Events  
  
\*\*Node-Level:\*\*  
— Project showcases  
— Skill-sharing workshops  
— Informal seminars  
— Study groups  
— Reading clubs (yes, D&D rulebooks count)  
  
\*\*Regional-Level (Larger Nodes):\*\*  
— Hackathons pooling talent across region  
— Project festivals (showcase + cross-pollination)  
— Conferences (subscribers as both audience and speakers)  
— Between-node competitions/collaborations  
  
\*\*Benefits:\*\*  
— Builds knowledge community identity  
— Creates visibility for work being done  
— Networking opportunities  
— Alternative to expensive conference travel  
— Revenue stream + marketing  
  
—  
  
\## Economic Model  
  
\### Revenue Streams  
  
\*\*Primary: Subscriptions\*\*  
— Individual/family monthly subscriptions  
— Regional or city-wide subscription options  
— Tiered access levels possible  
— Example: $20/month × 5,000-10,000 subscribers = $100-200k/month regional funding  
  
\*\*Secondary Revenue:\*\*  
— Compute/storage rental (sub-letting data center capacity)  
— Premium consultation hours (vetted experts)  
— Fine-tuning services for LLM models  
— Event fees (hackathons, conferences)  
— Equipment rental fees for intensive use  
— Café/diner sales  
  
\*\*Cost Centers:\*\*  
— Real estate (rent/mortgage for multiple nodes)  
— Utilities across nodes  
— Staff salaries (junior/mid/senior librarians)  
— Expert librarian stipends (part-time)  
— Equipment purchase and maintenance  
— LLM subscriptions and compute infrastructure  
— IT infrastructure and development  
— Books and materials  
  
\### Governance and Funding Models  
  
\*\*Regional Level (Operations):\*\*  
— Self-governing regional mesh networks  
— Funded by local population (taxes or subscriptions)  
— Fast decision-making on module additions  
— Community ownership → higher engagement  
— Budget tied to local population  
— Accountability to actual users  
  
\*\*Global Level (Coordination):\*\*  
— Sets standards and specifications  
— Maintains shared digital infrastructure  
— Facilitates inter-regional collaboration  
— R&D on new modules and capabilities  
— Quality assurance and best practices  
— Backstops underserved regions  
— Handles international expert exchanges  
  
\*\*Global Layer Must Be Net Positive:\*\*  
— Provides genuine value (bulk LLM costs, expert network, R&D)  
— Not regulatory burden  
— Regions choose level of participation  
— Can operate independently if preferred  
  
\*\*Implementation Models:\*\*  
  
\*Public Utility (Government-Run):\*  
— Proactive planning with census and development data  
— Long-term capital budgets  
— Ensures universal access  
— Coordinates with other infrastructure  
— Risk: bureaucratic slowness, political influence  
  
\*Non-Profit:\*  
— Reactive/organic growth from demonstrated demand  
— Start small, prove concept, scale based on usage  
— More agile response to needs  
— Risk: slower expansion, underserved areas  
  
\*Hybrid (Likely Optimal):\*  
— Government provides baseline funding + real estate  
— Non-profit operates day-to-day  
— Captures planning capability + operational flexibility

\## Why Physical Space Matters  
  
\### Neuroscience and Embodied Cognition  
  
\*\*Physical co-presence creates different cognitive patterns than remote interaction:\*\*  
  
\*\*Spatial Memory Encoding:\*\*  
— Physical locations anchor memories strongly  
— «I had that breakthrough in the corner by the spectrometer»  
— Walking between spaces creates mental context shifts that aid thinking  
  
\*\*Embodied Cognition:\*\*  
— Handling physical books activates different neural pathways than scrolling  
— Manipulating objects/equipment while discussing integrates sensorimotor and conceptual processing  
— Gesture and body language convey information bandwidth text/video cannot match  
  
\*\*Synchronous Presence:\*\*  
— Real-time feedback loops (micro-expressions, timing, energy)  
— Spontaneous tangents and «wait, what if…» moments  
— Shared environmental context  
  
\*\*Proximity Enables Serendipity:\*\*  
— Overhearing adjacent conversation sparks connection  
— Running into someone at café leads to unexpected collaboration  
— Physical «bumping into» complementary interests  
  
\*\*Third Place Psychology:\*\*  
— Home (rest) → Work (obligation) → Library node (chosen intellectual engagement)  
— Distinct physical space signals cognitive mode shift  
— Physical commitment increases engagement  
  
\*\*Remote work works okay, but something is lost. The physical nodes aren’t nostalgia — they’re optimized infrastructure for how human brains actually work.\*\*  
  
—  
  
\## Implementation Considerations  
  
\### Deployment Strategy  
  
\*\*Ideal Pilot Region Characteristics:\*\*  
— Mid-sized population (200k-1M) — big enough for network effects, small enough to manage  
— Growing young population (knowledge-hungry, tech-comfortable)  
— Existing expertise pool to recruit from  
— Government interested in innovation  
— Mix of urban/suburban/rural to test node tiers  
— Economic development motivation  
  
\*\*Potential Early Adopters:\*\*  
  
\*Easy Mode (USA/EU):\*  
— Existing infrastructure and expertise pool  
— Funding available for pilots  
— But: bureaucratic inertia, political fragmentation, competing interests  
  
\*Hard But Needed (Africa/LatAm):\*  
— Genuine infrastructure gaps to fill  
— Leapfrog opportunity (skip legacy model)  
— Massive youth population needing knowledge access  
— Less institutional resistance  
— But: funding challenges, infrastructure dependencies  
  
\*\*Leapfrog Argument:\*\*  
Just as Africa skipped landlines and went to mobile, regions without legacy library systems could build this from scratch without retrofitting politics.  
  
\### Critical Success Factors  
  
\*\*Minimum Viable Scale:\*\*  
— Cannot start with 50 subscribers and one node  
— Need sufficient density for network effects  
— Probably 3-5 nodes minimum to demonstrate mesh benefits  
— 2,000-5,000 subscribers for economic viability  
  
\*\*Expert Recruitment:\*\*  
— Competitive compensation is necessary but not sufficient  
— Prestige and professional development key attractors  
— Need visible early successes to create virtuous cycle  
— Start with enthusiastic early adopters willing to experiment  
  
\*\*Community Engagement:\*\*  
— Active marketing of capabilities (many won’t understand initially)  
— Showcase success stories  
— Build from schools up (create generational adoption)  
— Events create visibility and network effects  
  
\*\*Technology Infrastructure:\*\*  
— Robust digital backbone required  
— Redundancy and failover systems  
— Open standards for interoperability  
— Avoid vendor lock-in  
  
—  
  
\## Philosophical Foundation  
  
\### The Why  
  
\*\*The Core Insight:\*\*  
Humanity is wasting the intellectual «energy of thousands of suns» — each person with knowledge, curiosity, or expertise burning alone in isolation. We need intellectual synthesis, not intellectual fission.  
  
\*\*Current Models Are Insufficient:\*\*  
— Academia gates knowledge work behind credentials and slow hierarchies  
— Corporate R&D locks knowledge behind proprietary walls and profit motives  
— Curious individuals, retired experts, amateur researchers, unconventional thinkers have no infrastructure  
  
\*\*What This Creates:\*\*  
Post-institutional knowledge work infrastructure. A third space for intellectual collaboration that is:  
— Accessible (no credentials required)  
— Public good oriented (not profit-driven)  
— Collaborative by default (designed for connection)  
— Infrastructure-supported (tools, space, experts)  
— Cross-domain (breaks down silos)  
— Cross-generational (teens to retirees)  
  
\*\*Historical Parallel:\*\*  
The Chief Librarian of Alexandria commanded enormous respect as gatekeeper and synthesizer of human knowledge. This system restores that role and distributes it — making every participating community a node in humanity’s collective intellectual project.  
  
\*\*The Promise:\*\*  
Infrastructure for the fusion of human knowledge and creativity. Physical and digital substrate for the next generation of breakthroughs that emerge not from isolated geniuses or corporate labs, but from unexpected collisions of curious minds working together.  
  
—  
  
\## Conclusion  
  
The 21st century library is not a building with books. It is distributed civic intellectual infrastructure — a mesh network of knowledge nodes that provides access to information, expertise, tools, and community for anyone who wishes to engage in serious intellectual work.  
  
It fills a critical gap in modern society: the lack of accessible infrastructure for knowledge work outside the constrained models of academia and corporate R&D. It creates a third space where human curiosity can flourish, where unexpected collaborations can emerge, where the intellectual energy of thousands is synthesized rather than isolated.  
  
The system is designed to be:  
— \*\*Modular:\*\* Adaptable to local needs and evolving requirements  
— \*\*Resilient:\*\* Mesh topology with no single point of failure   
— \*\*Scalable:\*\* From single region to global coordination layer  
— \*\*Sustainable:\*\* Multiple revenue streams and governance models  
— \*\*Human-centered:\*\* Built around how brains actually work and communities actually function  
  
This is infrastructure for post-institutional knowledge work. It is an invitation to every human to participate in the giant intellectual project of civilization, starting now, not after years of credential accumulation.

1papfax,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1papfax/i_thought_id_be_safe_working_from_home_im_not_so/,I thought I’d be safe working from home. I’m not so sure anymore.,"I don’t have anyone else to tell, so I’m turning to you. I’ve been working a fully remote job for the past year. It can get lonely, holed up in my apartment, but my cat Mimi keeps me company. As I hunch over my screen, she rubs her head tenderly against my leg and jumps on my lap. I sit up straight, letting go of my mouse one moment to pet her sweet head. At all times and for all things, she is my light.

Until last year, I had been working as a barista. Meager wages, yet enough to sustain the little life Mimi and I had made for ourselves. I was content, happy to chat my shift away with my customers, happy to enjoy free drinks as a work perk. But I quit after an incident that left me scarred—literally.

To make a long story short: a customer, sweet-talking though slightly off-putting, took an uncomfortable liking to me. He was a regular, drank his coffee black with a splash of cream he would add himself at the pick-up counter.

One night, he was waiting for me outside the coffee shop, his hand wrapped tight around a brick from a nearby construction site.

I thought I’d be safe working from home. I’m not so sure anymore.

I’m now employed by a tech company, providing human feedback for all things large language models, generative AI and search engines. It’s repetitive but somewhat interesting work, although extremely impersonal. I’ve yet to speak to anyone from corporate, nor do I know any coworkers, as a matter of fact. I’ve barely even signed a contract. But I get paid on time, and I can watch movies as I work through infinite and mind-numbingly simple tasks. A few cents per submission quickly adds up, and I get paid extra for agreeing to rate NSFW content.

It started two months back. I was working at my desk, per usual, and about to take a break to feed Mimi who was already clawing at the back of my chair. “Just one more task, baby”, I whispered as I clicked around on the screen. I was rating search engine results for online queries. I submitted my task, ready to log out. That’s when I saw it.

My full name, spelled out in the search bar.

Now, my name is rather unique. The company, of course, had my contact information on file—do they use employee data to generate fake queries for us to evaluate? I don’t remember reading anything about this in any of my onboarding documents.

Was this a real search, then? I stared at the screen.

Now, I’ve searched for an old classmate or two to ruminate over the accomplishments they’ve immortalized on the Internet before. But I couldn’t be too flattered. It was the word that followed my name that sent a chill down my spine: “address”. Was someone looking for me?

I scanned the search results I was meant to evaluate. None of them, thankfully, displayed my real address. I thought I might have been overreacting. Ever since the incident at the coffee shop, I’ve been overly on my guard. Lost the few friends I had this way, including the coworker who found us and saved me that dreadful night.

Paranoia got the best of me. I wish I could say I’ve worked on myself, but I didn’t. I closed in on myself, locked the door and threw away the key. I order most of my groceries online nowadays, as well as any book I read. I used to love my local book shops—the smell of old books was always extraordinarily pleasing to me—but browsing Amazon has since replaced any and all of my past life’s rituals.

So, yes, I’ve been on my guard. When my package went missing, later to find out my neighbour had mistakenly picked it up, his face was the first thing on my mind. A flash of his crooked smile appeared to me then, too. Could it be him, looking me up? I checked the user’s location. My city. Our city.

Eventually, I had to submit the task and log off. Mimi was gnawing at the foot of my chair. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched. Yet, when I came back to work, half an hour later, routine was quick to set back in. Nothing abnormal. Nothing unusual.

I wanted to tell someone, call up a girl friend, but the line stayed quiet.

That night, I stared through my blinds at the dark a while before turning off the lights.

A few weeks ago, new tasks were assigned to me: evaluating instructions for image generation. It consisted, in short, of classifying user requests as either safe or unsafe. No images, just queries. This, I’m assuming, is to prevent the model from producing anything inappropriate.

Most of them were safe—entertaining, even. I was still chuckling at what an earlier query had conjured up in my mind when I pressed “submit”. I popped a grape in my mouth as I waited for the next one to load.

My heart sank when I found my name in the user search bar.



dead bitch **********-***** *******



I felt sick. Attacked all over again. My entire body was shaking as I hovered the cursor over the “unsafe” button. I read the query over and over again, hoping to find something different. I didn’t. It really was my name. No one else’s. I clicked “submit” and called out to Mimi, limbs trembling, begging for a bit of comfort. The page refreshed; the query disappeared.

What appeared next was far from a relief. I gasped, tears welling up in my eyes.



**********-***** ******* face smashed in whi tbrick



It was him, no doubt about it. Mimi, my best and my only friend, had walked into my bedroom, and however soft her meows were, in that moment, they were of no comfort to me. I thought of calling the police, but though I remember his breath, the empty look in his eyes, the ragged button-up he wore most days at the café, I never even knew his name. He always paid cash, and he was never caught. Never entered into the system.

My second reflex was to contact the company. Could they de-anonymize the user, given the violence of the requests? But again, I had never spoken to anyone from management. I didn’t know who my team lead was—if I even had one. I did receive employee newsletters, but I had serious doubts the marketing team could do anything for me.

I had never felt so alone, and God knows I had been.

This, however scary it was to me, wasn’t what prompted my writing this. After the second incident, I stopped working for a bit, fearing what my screen would show me next. The advantage of being a cog in so large and immaterial a machine is that you can disappear at any time, without a word. Not a single person would notice, and in my case, no one did.

But I quickly realized I needed the money. I couldn’t afford quitting, either. This was the only job that would offer me shelter from the outside world. With what I knew, I couldn’t and can’t risk stepping outside.

So I picked up some work again, my heart heavy with anxiety any time a page took some time to load. I’d breathe a sigh of relief every time I turned off my monitor at the end of the day. For two months, my blinds remained drawn.

But I can’t go on pretending nothing happened after what I saw today.

I took on more NSFW tasks as a moderator, hoping to make up for the week I had spent in bed. I would cover Mimi’s eyes whenever she would come to sit on my lap, though screens never really interested her, and I wasn’t sure she could even comprehend any of it.

Many of the pictures I could recognize from movies, others were rather cartoonish in style. These were okay. Others were grainy, dark. I would rather not know where those came from or who took them. Despite the gruesomeness involved in the task, I felt safe rating these pictures. I thought, perhaps naively, that though he could search what he pleased, he had nothing of the sort on me. I did not risk stumbling upon my name again.

I was wrong. Today, I was proven entirely wrong, because there, on my screen, I saw red.

Everything red.

Red blood.

Red flesh.

Red brick. 

And me. My face was an unrecognizable mess, beaten to a disgusting pulp, red like nothing I had ever seen in life and on my screen. But that hair was mine, and the collar of my shirt, though in the picture, soaked in blood, was unmistakable. It hasn’t fit me in years, but I know where it comes from.

My Facebook account is old, but remains publicly available. I lost my password a while ago. In my profile picture, I am still eighteen, full of life and colour, untouched, untouchable. Mimi was still a kitten then—I had posted a picture of the tiny orange ball of energy she used to be. My page is full of my thoughts—anything I found funny, anything I found interesting was shared with all the world to see. This unbroken part of me still exists online. And I know he has seen it. I know he’s reached right into it.

I can’t unsee myself. I can’t forget how I looked in that picture, dead. I don’t know who to go to. I don’t know what to do. Is there any way he would be able to find my address? Will that picture be enough to satisfy his urges? 

A question I’ve been asking myself every day for the last year echoes in my mind with a renewed gravity.

Why?

1papf77,https://www.reddit.com/r/InlandEmpire/comments/1papf77/searching_for_ceramics/,Searching For Ceramics,"This is a real long-shot but I thought I’d try: earlier this year I spent some time in Joshua Tree and happened to come across some beautiful coffee mugs made by a local ceramics artist (“local” = southern CA in this case). They didn’t have a normal mug handle and were wonderful earth-tone in color.

Here’s the thing: I unfortunately lost the one mug I bought and am totally blanking on the name of the artist. This is what I do remember:

-The artist was a woman
-IIRC their website noted that they may not be purely based in JT, but they sell in some other small shops around southern CA as well
-I’m fairly certain I bought it at a gift shop or coffee shop in JT, but someone also told me she was selling them in the Rivian charging station on 62 just outside of town
-This was February of this year

I’d really love to get another one, so if anyone may happen to read this scattershot description and know the artist, I’d really appreciate it! Also, if anyone has a recommendation for a similar item by another local ceramics artist, drop a link in the comments and I’ll be more than happy to check them out too.

1papesb,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1papesb/tomb/,Tomb,"She was so foolish to think that marriage could change a biker.
A husband who didn't leave their bed in the middle of the night to hang with his buddies, and women willing to screw a married man, shouldn't be something Nina had to ask for.
But here she was.
It was only 2 a.m. 
Tomb's Harley was gone.
He'd actually left their bed to go out.
And now she couldn't go back to sleep.
Oh, now she was mad.
She thumbed out a message.
Nina: Where are you?
Tomb: I'm at the clubhouse
Nina: Are you for real? It's after 2.
Tomb: Something came up. Will explain later, baby.
3 a.m. came and went. So did five and then six.
It escalated from her toes until the top of her head felt like it might explode.
She was about to give Tomb the biggest wake-up of his life. She threw the three large bags containing all of her husband's belongings down in front of him.
""You wanna be single? Tell the club sluts they have my blessing.""
————————
Nina
It was an awful, sickening pain in Nina's heart to know before the day was out, she would tell her husband she wanted a trial separation.
Want was a loose term since she was still madly in love with Tomb.
But the decision hadn't been straightforward. It was long thoughts and sleepless nights alone in their bed. Something she'd agonized over for months. If she left it any longer, she'd change her mind just like she had five million times already because her heart was weak.
This time, Nina was letting her head rule.
And her head was telling her their marriage wasn't maturing at all. Two years in, and it was as if they were two single people who screwed a lot but then went back to their separate lives. Approaching forty-one, Nina should have been shrewder to realize that getting married didn't change a person.
She loved that man. God, did she.
Some days, her love for Tomb felt like it would break her rib cage open, too big to keep inside her chest. If she could solve world hunger with the love she felt for Tomb, then no one would starve ever again.
If love was a beautiful, perfect thing, people chased their whole lives, why did it hurt so much?
She'd seen him and wanted him instantly.
According to Tomb, it had been the same for him.
They were in bed only hours after meeting. That showed the level of chemistry they had. What they still had.
It was that chemistry and sexual attraction that gave Nina pause for weeks. How could she be so unhappy and yet get laid regularly with the best orgasms? Some women would call her a greedy hooker for wanting more from the relationship.
Maybe she was.
Maybe she was ungrateful.
Tomb wasn't a wife abuser.
He was far from greedy with his money. Whatever she wanted, she could have. He was a friendly guy, and everyone loved Tomb. Easy-going, funny, and the best protector.
It could be she was expecting the complete package when that didn't exist outside of movies and books.
Sighing, she stopped in her wide hallway in front of the mirror by the front door. It was her last chance to check her appearance before she left the house for the day.
Nina knew Tomb loved how she looked. The banked flames in his eyes told her how attracted he was to her petite five-foot-one height, golden blonde hair down to her shoulders, helped only a little with low lights. Pursing her lips, she slicked on a thin, clear gloss coating to make her them shine. She smiled absently, remembering Tomb's face covered in her red lipstick not so long ago.
Not only his face wore the red color that night. But she couldn't think about his wonder shaft or how he used it to mesmerize her into submission.
She headed out the door with everything she needed, remembering to set the house alarm.
The stomach ache she'd carried all week like it was a symptom of her guilt, irritated Nina most of the morning until she drowned it in enough coffee to sink a ship.
Carrying bucket loads of guilt because she felt like a failure.
She'd obviously failed at being a wife.
It could be some people weren't meant to be married.
Now, she contemplated leaving him because it took two to make a marriage work.
Her answer, when he'd proposed, had been uncomplicated, like she'd waited her whole life for that question.
Now, she didn't know if she'd made the right decision.
More than ever lately, she'd enjoyed the quietness of the salon once she'd opened up. Not that Tomb was home to cause noise. He'd already left before she was awake.
She felt like she was turning into a silent nag, racking up negatives in his marriage tally. Not spending any peaceful time together each morning was one of them.
If they weren't having intercourse, Tomb was often out of the house doing his own thing.
She'd sold her condominium to live in his spacious three-bedroom bungalow. And though she had free rein to redecorate, it was sometimes like she was just an overnight visitor. A booty call with space in the double walk-in closet.
Lost in her racing thoughts, she jumped at the knock on the door. Esther was always early.
""It's hotter than Satan's armpits. We're gonna fry today, doll."" she dumped her purse and coffee tumbler on the work side. Esther was in Nina's age bracket, with three kids and a deadbeat boyfriend, long in the past. They'd been fast friends ever since Esther interviewed for the position of nail technician.
Not long after the pair set up the salon for the day, Nina's other stylist arrived fashionably late, as always. Ross greeted them as enthusiastically as he did every morning. ""Hello, you intercourse kittens. What kind of day are we having today?""
""Not siren-kittenish, that's for sure."" Scoffed Esther, rolling her eyes as she prepared her workstation.
""Didn't get laid again?"" asked the twenty-something, brushing black hair out of his eyes. Ross claimed it was his God-given queer right to butt into their intercourse lives. Or non-existent intercourse life, in Esther's case. It was many failed attempts to set Esther up with blind dates, but Ross wouldn't give up trying to find her a man.
""If you mean did I drive one kid to a basketball game and another to a gamer convention and then watched five episodes of True Crime while painting my toenails, then yeah, I got laid.""
Ross clicked his tongue, shaking his head. ""It's a sad day when you're not getting that body rocked at least twice a night, cupcake.""
""My rocking days are behind me.""
""This one,"" he pointed at Nina, who was minding her own business but always got brought into their spats. ""is your age and is getting her world rocked by the hottest man on earth."" Ross wasn't finished. ""She walks in here bow-legged. He's that good.""
""Nina is married."" Answered Esther.
Ross made a sarcastic noise from his throat. ""That means screw all, cupcake. Tell her, Nina.""
""Don't bring me or my intercourse life into it. I've hardly sipped coffee yet. And stop calling my husband hot, or I'll tell Bastian what you're saying.""
""Bas would agree; he fancies Tomb, too. We've agreed if Tomb ever comes to our side, he will be our throuple.""
Choking on a sip of coffee, Nina coughed before she met the humored eyes of her soon-to-be-fired colorist.
""At least that put color in your cheeks. What's up, cupcake? You're not your usual lively self this morning."" He winked.
""Less of the cupcake,"" she tried to reprimand, but smiled with it. ""Remember, I'm your boss; I could fire you anytime.""
""Not when I'm the best colorist this Podunk town has ever seen. Now answer, madame boss lady. Everything okay?""
""Everything is fine, Ross."" Nina was saved from further explanation when the receptionist and intern arrived. Minutes later, the salon team assembled, and the day was ready to start.
Thank God for her thriving business, because it meant Nina was kept busy. It was what gave her a purpose. Nina's salon was coming up on its tenth year, and thankfully, she'd come through dips and scares with the economy. But like death and taxes, everyone always wanted their hair to look nice, so while other shops around her on Main Street had come and gone, Nina's survived.
On a break, she half listened to Ross and Bethany, her quiet yet hardworking intern, when a text buzzed.
She frowned, seeing who it was from.
Tomb: Princess, gotta go on a run. I'll be home late.
Her heart sank as she kept her eyes on the screen to see if he'd send another text. Maybe love or smoochs, or he'd miss her. Nothing came.
They weren't ships passing in the night at this point. Their boats weren't even in the same ocean.
Nina: No problem. I'm going out with the girls. Be safe. XX
She missed that man more than she could say. And she had to wonder if he missed her at all. Slipping the phone into her back pocket, she tried to push aside the hurt.
Something had to change, and soon, before she lost herself to a deep-seated depression.
But Nina didn't know if she could put into motion something that would break her heart. It was unimaginable to think of hurting Tomb, not when he owned her completely. It was unthinkable to make her big man frown.
It hadn't always been this way.
Not in those first few days and weeks when they'd been so obsessed with each other.
She wanted that back.
She wanted more. And Nina didn't believe she was wrong about needing more.
Did she try, or did she give up?",0,1764527056.0,romancenovels,3,0.5,False

1papc7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenX/comments/1papc7y/genx_parents_advice_needed/,GenX Parents - advice needed,"I’m 56f with two GenZ daughters,16f & 18f, and I was forcefully estranged from them 7yrs ago. The term is parental alienation, and it’s a form of psychological child abuse whereby one parent uses coercive control like brainwashing, manipulation, etc. to intimidate their children to fear the other parent. I have a post in the parental alienation sub that explains some of the dynamics that led to this outcome, so I don’t want to rehash that here.

I’m hoping for perspective about some interactions I’ve had with my 18yr daughter. About 2yrs ago we connected on text and Instagram. Those interactions have been infrequent. I wrote her a 2pg letter about 2yrs ago…no big emotions, past traumas, etc. just a simple, light glimpse into what my life was like. She responded in kind with a sweet letter. One night she randomly messaged me on SC asking if I wanted to meet for coffee soon. I responded yes immediately. Days, weeks went by and she never responded to any of my follow up attempts to meet for coffee. In January 2025 I told her I had an important letter I wanted to send her. She deferred and asked me to send it on her eighteenth birthday. She received the letter in early August but has since been radio silent. I was hopeful this letter would lead to a path forward. 

I guess one other interaction worth noting. In January 2025 I asked her if I could attend her high school graduation. She deferred (I don’t know when graduation is or how many tickets, etc). I asked a couple more times then just dropped it. The night before her graduation she posted on SC that she had two extra tickets available for graduation. I was so confused. It wasn’t sent to me directly.

She seems to be a good kid. Dyed her hair black and dresses in all black. Retro GenX goth. Haha! Smart like her mama. She was always a sensitive kid. She started self-harming at her dad’s house when she was only 8y. We were extremely bonded as mother/daughter and when dad became the primary parent she responded very poorly. 

It’s a miracle I haven’t gone insane. It’s true that the person who you marry can change your life path. Or in this instance, the lives of three people. The only thing that keeps me alive is my children. I think of them 90% of every day. I tell them I love them, aloud, everyday. But there’s a lot of shame being the Target parent, especially as a mother. The power, control, coercion and deceit constantly weighing on my thoughts. And the helplessness. Not having the means to fight for my children and being plunged into poverty. Clawing my way out of it. 

I have always feared so deeply for my children. When communication ended 7yrs ago,  I was hanging on by a fucking thread. I remember driving past a playground when children were outside playing, and having to pull my car to the side of the road because I started shaking/crying uncontrollably. 

Any wisdom, advice, resources, etc. for helping me lay that first brick to building a path forward with my GenZ daughters? It would be greatly appreciated. I’m open to suggestions, feedback or criticism if warranted. I still believe that one phrase can unlock a heart, or maybe I’m just hopeful. Thanks",0,1764526889.0,GenX,17,0.17,False

Whats true and whats not? lol,"* Nairobi is overrated as a city and has little genuine culture of its own Most of the “Nairobi culture” people celebrate is either imported (nightlife from Westlands, coffee culture, art scenes) or a superficial mash-up of upcountry ethnic traditions performed for tourists and the middle class. The city itself feels soulless outside of a few historic pockets.
* Traffic and matatu culture are not “part of the charm” — they’re a symptom of a failed city Romanticizing the chaos, loud music, reckless driving, and four-hour commutes is something only people who don’t rely on public transport every day can afford to do. A functional capital wouldn’t make enduring daily hell a personality trait.
* Nairobi’s “green city in the sun” reputation is a lie — it’s concretized, polluted, and ugly Outside of Karura, Ngong Road, and a handful of rich suburbs, the city is a hot, treeless, dusty concrete jungle with open sewers and terrible air quality. The “green” nickname is 1960s propaganda that never recovered from the population explosion.
* Westlands, Kilimani, and Kileleshwa are bubbles, and most of “cool Nairobi” is fake and pretentious The brunches, rooftop bars, overpriced cocktails, and Instagram aesthetic are sustained by a tiny elite (including expats and diaspora returnees) cosplaying a lesser version of Joburg or Lagos while the rest of the city lives in parallel poverty. It’s not vibrant; it’s segregated escapism.
* Nairobians are some of the rudest, most self-important people in East Africa The “we are better than the rest of Kenya” attitude has turned way too many residents into arrogant pricks who look down on anyone from shags, treat waiters and guards like trash, and act like living in Nairobi automatically makes them sophisticated.
* Nyama choma and Tusker nostalgia is low-class coping, not culture Every weekend the same ritual: overpriced tough meat, warm beer, and loud bongo flava in a smoky car wash-turned-nyama joint while pretending this is peak Kenyan happiness. It’s not tradition; it’s just that we never figured out better ways to socialize. You’ve done the exact same thing 400 Saturdays in a row and convinced yourself it’s a personality. It’s not culture, it’s alcoholism with loyalty cards.
* The Nairobi dating scene is trash because most people here are emotionally damaged gold-diggers Men faking lifestyles they can’t afford in rented V8s and Airbnbs, women putting “must be 6ft+, have a car, pay bills” in their bios while bringing nothing but filters and attitude to the table. Everybody is performing for the timeline instead of building real relationships.
* 90% of Nairobi churches are just prosperity-gospel M-Pesa scams in fancy suits The louder the pastor screams, the bigger the car parked outside. People are tithing their rent money to fund private jets while the pastor tells them “your breakthrough is coming next year.”
* Nairobi women have the worst wigs and personalities combo in the world 42-inch Vietnamese synthetic hair that smells like burnt plastic after one week, paired with an attitude that suggests the wig gave them a PhD. The confidence-to-maintenance ratio is criminal.
* The Java House/KFC/Artcaffe generation is raising the most entitled, useless kids Kenya has ever seen iPads at 3, private school British accents, zero chores, and parents who think “exposure” means weekend brunches. These kids will be 25 still asking daddy for fuel money and crying when the watchman doesn’t greet them properly.
* Deep down, every Nairobian knows the city is one giant open-air mental asylum and we’re all just coping The stress, noise, bills, fake friendships, hustles that never pay off, and daily small humiliations have broken most of us. We just pretend it’s normal because admitting the truth would force us to leave or fix it.",15,1764526714.0,nairobi,21,0.95,False
