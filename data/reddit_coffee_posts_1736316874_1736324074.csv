1hweuf4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dua_Perfumes/comments/1hweuf4/updated_version_part_2_a_list_of_alll_the/,🔥🔥UPDATED VERSION Part 2: A List of Alll the Perfumes I’ve tried and Love! Mostly Gourmand but also a bunch of Non Gourmand Fragrance Favorites added! (This list includes mostly Dua Perfumes but also other brands that are Amazinggg!),"🔥Random Loves: 

Duas Creamy Blend of Walnuts (A Dua Original Blend): I was told this was amazing so when it restocked I had to grab it! And I am sooo Happy I did! It literally smells like blended up walnuts blended with sweet cream! it sounds weird but it’s soo good! (It’s a banger right out of the box and the projection is awesome and the longevity lasts a while!) 



Duas Note of Milk (Inspired by Lait Concentré by Chabaud Maison De Parfum): I was so wrong about this one! when I first sprayed this it was so light I could hardly smell anything!  in my head I wasn’t sure how much stronger it would get maybe a little after macerating? I was wrong as it dried down on my skin it got stronger and stronger (it’s like light to moderate projection with 1 spray) it’s been about 5 hours and it’s still at its strongest. Its smells literally like a sweet milk with a little bit of light caramel mixed in. It’s so good! 



Duas Pistachio Gelato (A Dua Original Blend): okay this one takes months to macerate like 5+ to reach its full potential but when it does…..OMG!! When I first bought this I couldn’t smell any of the other notes the only thing I smelled was photorealistic pistachio nuts. Sprayed it 2 months later still the same. So I forgot about her and went to sell her because I had purchased 2 and sprayed her 1 last time and the 180 this fragrance did!! It went from sniffing a bag of pistachio nuts to a sweet creamy pistachio dream….it was INSANE!! The fact that a fragrance can change so much I can’t wrap my mind around it still! Lol but banger just needs patience! 



Duas Pistachio Almond Cream ( A Dua original Blend): this is the BEST most realistic pistachio scent I have smelled so far. (She is sitting right now and prob for a while because she does disappear pretty quickly 😔) when you first spray it you get a photorealistic home made pistachio ice cream scent. You can smell the creaminess and nuttiness of the pistachio and the almond/cherry note is blended in perfectly with it! But it’s very short lived that amazing pistachio note disappears and ur left with a skin scent of the almond cherry note. I will deff update as it macerates im really hoping the pistachio note starts to stick around longer and the fragrance gains some projection/longevity! 


Duas Pistachio Cream Delight: this is one of my favorite pistachio perfumes from Dua. It literally smells like smooth creamy pistachio pudding! This one was good straight out of the box but does get better as it macerates.



Duas Sky of Sugar (inspired by VS Sugar Sky): I love this! It’s ready to go straight out of the box! It literally smells like sweet sugar with a little bit of vanilla. This smells so good on its own but it’s one of those simple perfumes that u can layer with almost anything to amp up the sweetness! (I’m deff going to try it with marshmallow dreams!) 
A lot of people say it is very similar/ almost identical to Dua’s fluffy marshmallow (which I don’t have it was on my wishlist but since I have this now I don’t feel the need for that one) 



Love Coffee (inspired by Amore Cafe by Mancera): Another one I was praying Dua would dupe and my prayers were answered! (She’s good to go straight out the box but she’s in time out so all the notes can blend/smooth out better together)  she’s going to be so good in the winter! It’s a sweet vanilla, caramel and amaretto with a little bit of coffee in there and there’s another note I can’t put my finger on that makes it almost like a perfumey gourmand in a way? Maybe it’s the ambergris in the base? (This layered with any simple vanilla or white milk smells even better!)



Narcotica Happy Dust inspired scents I’ve tried so far….. (she’s a lighter scent in general so she’s not ment to be a fragrance that projects like crazy)

Duas The Dust of Delight (Inspired by Happy Dust by Narcotica): this one is so good she does start off as a skin scent and very light but as she macerates you can smell the notes so much better! Still a very light scent but she’s gorgeous all the notes together literally smells like you were sprayed with magic fairy dust lol…you get some sweet matcha, coconut water, very light vanilla and all the other notes it’s just a gorgeous blend.



Genre Parfums Fairy Dust (inspired by Happy Dust by Narcotica): also gorgeous she’s exactly the same as Duas except a little less creamy but the projection although it’s still light it’s not nearly as light as Duas IMO. I can smell all the notes as it warms up on the skin and the longevity is great just a gorgeous perfume.🔥🔥



Heist Fragrances Sparks (inspired by Happy Dust Narcotica): Now this one is also on the lighter side but she’s new so right now the projection is in between Duas version and Genres Version but I know as she matures the projection will get better 🤞🏼 lol. So far this one might be my favorite and as she matures and if the other notes come out more and the projection gets better she will deff be the winner for me! This one is creamy and right now I can smell the vanilla a little bit of matcha and a little bit of mango the most very sweet and pretty 💜 I will deff update in the future! 

Andromedas Moon Happy dust (Inspired by Narcotica Happy Dust): I Live AM I think she does a great Job with her dupes and this one isn’t any different! It’s slightly different from the others in its own way but it’s still Happy Dust but with a slight twist that you really won’t notice unless you smelled the others. I can’t pin point what it is but it does elevate the scent a bit and the projection and logevity are pretty good right out of the box! But I know from past experience the longer her fragrances sit the stronger they get! This one and I also purchased a bunch of samples aren’t oily at all to me! 

THE VERDICT OF STRONGEST PROJECTION & LONGEST LASTING:
(As of right NOW Genre is the strongest, Andromedas Moon comes in second, Heist comes in third, and Duas comes in fourth but heist and Dua are both more creamy then Genre and AM) 



Duas Fireplace (inspired by Replica by the Fireplace): I have the OG of Replicas by the Fire place I love it so much but since they changed the formula it doesn’t last as long it smells a tiny bit different and the longevity is deff not there! So I have been on the hunt and have tried almost every single “inspired by” fragrance houses, by the fireplace….. (ALT: good but a little to sharp (I need to test her again now that she’s macerated), Genre Parfums Bon Fire: good but something is missing? And it was a little to light in projection for me) and then Duas Fireplace: I just got it so I’m going to let it macerate for a little so everything can blend together, but on first spray it’s already pretty good! And close to the original except there are some sharp notes at the moment and it’s missing that little bit of sweetness (but that can easily be fixed) the hybrids I want to deff try are drowning in vanilla by the fire! And maybe casino royal fire nights? Or something like that)



Duas Sweet Milk (inspired by Commodity Milk Expressive): literally an exact replica of Commodity Milk Expressive! Except the longevity and projection are wayyy better!! (Deff a winter scent but it’s different it’s Smokey and woodsy and has the tiniest bit of sweetness (which I will be amping up by layering a marshmallow or vanilla on top) but it’s also good on its own if your in the mood for something different and cozy during those cold winter days/nights! 



Duas Dark Opium Red Cherry (Inspired by Black Opium Over Red): this is sooo good and it’s getting better and better everytime I try her out/ the longer it macerates! Straight out of the box she was super light but she gained projection pretty quickly! Omg the cherry smells so good in this with the Black Opium DNA. She’s gives off a sweet/sexy vibe! The cherry is more of a sweet cherry and smells amazing with the Black Opium DNA! I havnt tried the original but this is exactly what I thought the original would smell like, actually better! 



Duas I’m a Sexy Mess Rolling Out of Bed (inspired by Messy Sexy Just Rolled Out Of Bed by What We Do Is Secret): I waited sooo long for this to restock and I was so happy when it did! It did not dissapointed! Totally different than anything I would ever go for!it opens up as more of a pretty fragrance but the dry down is more sensual…the notes are really well blended so its kind of hard to describe…it opens with a soft fruity floral opening ( I can deff smell the peach but the florals are really well blended with it so it doesn’t smell like straight up peach) and the dry down the sandalwood, vanilla, cashmere and a tiny bit of amber added with the opening notes of peach and I guess the rose (I can’t really smell the floral notes) are so perfectly blended it just smells so beautiful!


Heist Sexy Bitches get Stitches (Inspired by Messy Sexy just Rolled out of Bed by What we do is Secret): this one needs time to sit to get the full effect (like a few months which I’ve found with a few of Heists fragrances that I’ve tried) but it’s more of a daytime scent compared to Duas Version. It’s more creamy and the peach is blended in with the floral notes but the scent as a whole has an all around brighter aspect to it. I think I like this one more due to it being more creamy but the only downside is waiting for it to macerate to reach its full potential.



Duas 🍓 Strawberry Love Note (inspired by Phlur Strawberry Letter): this is one of my top favorite strawberry perfumes from Dua! Thankfully I was able to get it from a good friend of mine that I met from purchasing some of her Dua Perfumes….this is a gorgeous grown/sexy strawberry perfume! The opening strawberry note is a realistic juicy strawberry that stays throughout the life of the perfume (their is plum in the top notes but I don’t smell plum I think it just enhances the strawberry bite and makes it juicy)….the dry down has added notes of apple blossom, earthy notes, creamy tonka and sugared amber are blended perfectly with the juicy strawberry from the initial spray but gets a little more sensual and sexy in the dry down while still being a little sweet and juicy. It’s one of those perfumes I never had an interest in trying but so happy I did after seeing the rave reviews! This is deff BUB worthy and perfect straight out of the box!



Duas Apple of Eden (Inspired by Kayali Eden Juicy Apple): after trying Circus of the Sun I fell in love with the Sweet red apple note in it so I have been looking for a great Sweet red apple perfume and Apple of Eden is a gorgeous sweet red apple scent! It smells almost like a sweet red apple with shampoo vibes (in a good way!!) but the deep dry down that sweet red apple is still there but blended in really well and it turns more into a sweet and sultry red apple perfume. I loved it so much I purchased a bub!! 🍎



Duas Error 430: Garden Tales (inspired by JPG (Jean Paul Gaultier) La Belle Paradise Garden): this is deff more of a summer scent in my opinion, I have wanted to try this fragrance for a while but I am not a fan of florals so I didn’t want to risk purchasing it and hating it because from the reviews I saw it’s one of those fragrances you either love or hate….this is very different from any other floral fragrance I have ever smelled before it is slightly aquatic/ozonic and because there is only 3 notes the floral I assume I am smelling the most is the Blue Lotus (which I’ve never really seen in a perfume before) it is a beautiful scent deff great for summer but I wouldn’t say it’s a safe blind buy based on the reviews! (Grab a decant or go smell it in store before buying unless you know you’ll love it!) 



Duas Exceptional Dance of Dragonflies (Inspired by  La Danza Delle Libellule Exceptional Edition by Nobile 1942): I was really hesitant to get this one because of the mixed reviews but found a great deal on it and my friend said I had to try it and she was not wrong!! This fragrance is gorgeous!!! You can smell the sweet red apple , sweet coconut and the other notes in this fragrance (vanilla, cedar wood, bergamot, cinnamon and musk) are just blended seamlessly and just bring it all together! I can mainly smell the red apple and coconut all the other notes are like supporting notes that make this into the gorgeous fragrance that it is! This fragrance is stunning IMO! Idk what it is about it but I have never smelled anything like it and I have fallen in love and am deff getting a bub of it! 



Duas Winter Wonderland (Inspired by B&BW Frosted Wonderland): I went for this one after seeing enough reviews that I knew it would probably by safe to purchase and I would like it…..this is a cool scent literally! It starts off with apple and caramel but gives off a sort of chilly vibe (it’s so weird I’m not sure how they are able to make a perfume smell cold but this one does in the beginning!) that chilly apple/caramel u smell in the begging blends in, in the dry down. The dry down is cozy and sweet and blended so well I have no idea what I’m smelling and honestly there are sooo many notes I really thought this one would be a disaster but it’s such a good cozy winter scent! (It does need some time to macerate cuz it is a little lighter when u first get it!) 



Duas Princeless Princess (Inspired by I Don’t Need a Prince by my Side to be a Princess by Kilian): if you live the OG you’ll love this. This has a slight citrus note that blends in beautifully with the green tea, marshmallow, vanilla, benzoin and other notes which arnt really detectable to me (on the dry down I can smell more of the marshmallow but honestly I wouldn’t of even thought of marshmallow when smelling this or the OG I can only identify it because it’s in the notes and people have considered this a “marshmallow frag”)This to me is like a pretty girl fragrance mixed with a little bit of sexy/grown and a little bit of sweet musk. This isn’t a ground breaking scent to me but there is something addictive about it? 



Duas Silky Veil of Santal (Inspired by The Wedding Silk Santal): I’ve never tried the original but I am so glad I picked this up! I was scared because it was classified as floral and I am not a fan of most floral fragrances. I would describe this as a pretty girl fragrance. You get the floral notes but they are very well blended in with the other notes. Right now I’m picking up a beautiful slight floral blend deff not overpowering at all, and there’s a freshness to it but blended very well with the vanilla, sandalwood and a little bit of sweet musk. This is a brand new bottle just out of the box the projection is really good already! I can’t wait until this sits and the other notes come out and develop more!
Will update in the future: 



Duas Creamy Vanilla Sugar Candy 42 (Inspired by Kayali Vanilla Candy Rock Sugar 42): the Projection and longevity is Amazing right out of the box! (Which I find the case with most of Duas Kayali Dupes) mine is sitting for a litter cuz I’m curious if the sweeter notes will get stronger, like the marshmallow, vanilla cream, bubblegum and rock sugar but this is a bit sweeter then the OG beautifully blended and an amazing dupe!  



Duas Puffletuft (Inspired by HOS Hufflepuff): I waited wayyyy too long to try this one! It has been raved about since it came out but I was nervous about the citrus notes because I’m not a fan of citrus perfumes at all! This is one of those perfumes that I would classify as gorgeous/sexy gourmand! This is good to go straight out of the box!! You get a very light lemon scent that’s very well blended with all the other notes (coconut, peach, bourbon vanilla vanilla bean and cedar wood) and the floral notes (gardenia, freesia and Jasmin) you can not smell at all they are so well blended to enhance the other notes. It’s perfect (I immediately bought a bub after I smelled it!!🔥🔥



Duas Circus of the Sun (Inspired by L’eau de Parfum by Cirque du Soleil): I was waiting for months for this to drop! And the release date kept getting pushed back further and further so when It finally came to drop day I had read reviews of the OG which was really hyped up when it came out (which is probably why I wanted it so bad + the bottle was gorgeous…..
but that price tag for a blind buy! No Thank you!) but the reviews on fragrantica were all over the place. They either loved, hated or it didn’t last long, ect. So I asked the ladies in the group (which they’re all bad influences lol 😂 so of course I had like 50+ comments saying I had to have it! So I grabbed a bottle and I am sooo glad I did!
Now I know when this macerates more it’s going to be even better/ stronger! But straight out of the box when first sprayed I can smell sweet red apple and something else like airy and sweet freshness mixed but I can’t put my finger in it yet because it does start out light (prob the red apple, airy cotton candy and airy florals blended ) as it dries down I still get the sweet red apple but a tiny bit of Butter and caramel starts to peak thru. At full dry down OMG I get the sweet red apple the buttery caramel, the littlest bit of cotton candy and some vanilla, amber and sandalwood but also something slightly salty but in the most beautiful way. I love that this has layers instead of being linear like most duas, I find to be pretty linear…. and the dry down is so well blended the only way I can describe this perfume is beautiful! Masham Raza did his thing with this one!! This is a master piece! This is BUB WORTHY!! (It’s gourmand but not full out gourmand IMO? It’s like half gourmand and half beautiful a beautiful slightly gourmand sprinkled with fairy dust magic fragrance?….idk this one needs a new genre all on its own!! (I’ve ordered BUBS for my BUBS because I never want to be without this perfume! EVER!!) this is the one for me! It’s literally been my SOTD daily since I’ve gotten it, which I never do (because I love to smell different perfumes daily and see if their getting better, ect…but I want to bath in her and smell like her for the rest of my life!! 


Heist Frangrances Paulie Walnuts (inspired by Navitus Baklava Royale): this is my favorite scent so far from Heist! It’s absolutely gorgeous! I don’t like citrusy scents but idk what magic they did to make the citrus blend so seamlessly with the other notes and you can still smell that there’s citrus in the fragrance but it’s blended so perfectly! This inspo was wayy better than I ever expected even the OG to be in my mind! It smells amazing, like a more grown up gourmand but still wearable anytime of the year day or night (this is tied with my #1 fragrance) it’s addicting and full bottle worthy plus the projection and longevity is there with just 1 spray!!




🔥Going Out/ Sexy Date Night Scents: (Mostly Non Duas so far but I’m waiting for some to restock to try out…..)


My #1 girl always and forever for when I go out: Carolina Herrara Good Girl: she’s classic! She’s gorgeous, she’s sexy. But most importantly she makes me feel at my sexiest/ most confident when I wear her! I don’t think she can ever be replaced? There’s nothing like her not even the flankers top her IMO (I have them but I still choose her!) 


Duas Essence for Lust (inspired by  Luxuria by Memoize London): A lot of people say this is close to CH good girl but to me the florals are more prominent then blended in, and hardly detectable in Good Girl (maybe as she macerates she will get closer to good girl? but she’s okay right now….still pretty but just not beating my #1 sexy girl up there!) 


Duas Sweet Pink Cloudscape (inspired by Cloud Pink by Ariana Grande): who doesn’t love Ariana Grandes line and Flankers of her Cloud perfume? Sweet Pink Cloudscape has insane longevity and projection Straight out of the box! (Ik not to try a perfume straight away when delivered, but…..I was way too excited and had waited wayyy too long for that perfume to restock and it was so worth it!) I tested it again a few days later and she’s perfect!! She’s got that OG cloud DNA but with a beautiful tropical fruit twist blended into the Cloud DNA. If you live Ariana Grandes Cloud and all the flankers and live Cloud Pink this is for you but better IMO because of the projection and longevity! 
P.S since we are talking about Ariana Grande obviously the classic cloud and cloud 2.0 are also favorites (but dua hasn’t created those versions) 


Duas Casino Royale Nights: White Milk Edition (Hybrid of Dua BR 540 extrait and White Milk aka Bianca Latte dupe): I never get white milk hybrids because White Milk normally takes over the fragrance. But I found this one at a great price and both are beast mode frags in their own way I had to try it, and I’m so glad I was able to grab it! It’s gorgeous! It’s a perfect mix of both fragrances! One doesn’t over power the other….you get the gorgeous BR540 DNA mixed with the sweet/sexy White Milk DNA and it’s just magic in a bottle! Such a great hybrid!! And deff worth it if you love both fragrances or even if you just love the BR540 DNA but wish it had a little more sweetness! This one is Perfection!


Duas Incarnation of the Venom (inspired by Venom Incarnat by Stéphane Humbert Lucas 777): I had this one on my wishlist wayy longer then I should have. I was nervous to grab this one because the notes were wayyy out of my comfort zone, and I’m so mad I did! This is absolutely GORGEOUS!! The strawberry is bright and juicy throughout the entirety of the fragrance and then  with the other notes (which are blended to perfection!) the caramel, cedar, patchouli, vanilla , tonka and Russian leather! Omg this is a sexy amber vanilla with sweet bright strawberry! Its dark and sexy but not to dark because the brightness of the strawberry and sweetness of vanilla and caramel keep it from being to resinous. It’s just a gorgeous fragrance! If you’re looking for something different and more of a sexy date night fragrance, this is it!! 🔥🔥


Duas Australia’s Santal ( Inspired by Santal Austral by Metiere Premiere): This was my first Santal forward fragrance I really stepped out of my comfort zone getting this one and I am soo glad I did!! This is a gorgeous Vanilla creamy santal fragrance!  It’s deff more of a nighttime/ date night scent imo. It’s giving sexy grown and sultry vibes. Gorgeous scent!!


Tie of Black (Inspired by Celine Black Tie): Another one I finally bit the bullet for because I wasn’t sure if it was going to be for me but this is a such a sultry perfume. It has moderate projection but I think that’s perfect for this scent! It’s perfect for day or night. It’s a little sweet but it’s more of a sultry vanilla Amber slightly woody perfume and the orris butter gives it a slight powderyness to it but very little which brings everything together. It’s perfect. 


Duas After Dark (Inspired by SDJ After Hours): I knew I had to have this because I lovee the original! The scent profile for After Dark is deff not an ordinary SDJ summery /fruity/ or floral scent, it’s more of a sexy date night scent. It’s kind of reminds me of good girls scent profile but has a tiny bit more dark fruitiness going on. It’s such a sexy scent the dark fruits with the sandalwood and amber it’s hard to explain but if you love the OG or now that it’s part of the SDJ  permanent line (#76) so ur able to go test it at ur local Ulta/sephora to see if it’s for you! 🔥🔥


 Duas Duagasm 36 (Inspired by Kayali Oudgasm Vanilla 36): Dua did an amazing job with this I mainly get vanilla, a soft rose note in the background which is blended perfectly in so it isn’t to much then the sandalwood blended with the oud (I have never tried oud this isn’t the expensive barnyard/ hay smelling oud at all!) it’s just blended in perfectly and rounds out the fragrance/ and the slight earthy notes ground the fragrance. Dua did an amazing job with it!  


Duas Cunning Defense (Inspired by Mind Games Perfumes French Defense): okay this one is wayyyy out of my comfort zone like the other ones out of my comfort zone I found a really great deal on it! But I am so glad I went for it because in the chat I’m in someone had brought it up a few weeks before and it’s gorgeous the opening is a juicy darker cherry note and takes front and center with the other notes in the background and as it dries down their is an odd earthy scent mixed in for a little bit that goes away and the cherry you can still smell pretty well but it’s then blended in with the other notes (like the floral, tea, vanilla and woody notes) making it so sexy the cherry brightens and adds sweetness and the other notes smooth everything together and makes it sweet but at the same time a darker sexy and a tiny bit earthy scent, but because it’s so well blended I can’t really tell what I’m smelling with the cherry?! just so good! Projection and longevity is perfect right out of the box!!


 Duas She Loves Red (Inspired by Rouge Smoking by BDK Parfums): this is literally a sexy cherry Dr Pepper type of scent. This took me a while to try because I’ve never tried any of the cola/ Dr Pepper vibe perfumes. But this is so well blended! It’s slightly sweet with the cherry, vanilla, tonka and ambroxan blended perfectly and the spices are soft and in the background and add that sexy touch to the scent (like spiced vanilla extrait 21) it’s just a sexy scent perfect for a night out with that perfect LBD or a leather jacket/ jeans and black leather boots. 


BDK PERFUMES GRIS CHARNEL: Duas version compared to Heist’s version….
Duas Carnal Grey (Inspired by Gris Charnel by BDK): this is one of those fragrances I would have never in a million years tried because of the notes and because it looked like it leaned more on the masculine side but I was wrong. This is deff a unisex fragrance I think it could work for day or night. It smells like tea (I’m not a tea drinker but u can smell the black tea note, it’s aromatic, slightly creamy, and the sandalwood and tonka round it out it’s a really cozy but sensual fragrance. I think it is great on its own but I also want to try layering it with Vanillac dreams to bring a little more sweetness to it to see how that combo is.

Heist Tea With Tony (inspired by Gris Charnel by BDK): they did an amazing job with this scent!, I would never choose a scent like this based on the notes but to me it’s giving sexy date night fragrance! Its a little sweet and has that sexy alluring smell to it that makes you want to keep smelling your wrist because you can’t get enough….ughh but that sweet note just brings it back and pulls everything together in the most gorgeous way! (This might even compete with my usual date night fragrance since I was 20….good girl) I love it! You can smell the black tea note but it isn’t dense it’s airy and very creamy and then the sandalwood and tonka just add to it, they did such an amazing job with this fragrance! 
Even tho both Duas and Heists version are pretty close I would deff choose Heist’s Tea with Tony over Duas Carnal Grey because I love that it’s more creamy and the added sweetness in heists compared to Duas it’s just so good! It’s blended perfectly! 



Heist Fragrances Baci (inspired by Bvlgari): absolutely Gorgeous Grown Sweet Vanilla Amber fragrance with a little bit of gardenia that just adds to the blend! Another biggest bottle worthy fragrance! It smells like a gorgeous elevated slightly sweet Amber Vanilla. They did an amazing job with this one, the dry down, the projection, the longevity is just insane straight out the box! This is one of those fragrances that make you feel like a confident boss bitch that knows what she wants and how to get it while smelling amazing, sweet but classy while doing it! 🔥🔥🔥


 Genre Virtuoso (inspired by Italica by Xerjoff): this one was a winner as soon as I smelled it! It’s like a more elevated sexier version compared to Duas Italica which is more gourmand. Idk what genre did but they did it right this is perfect for day or night! I can’t really explain how it smells but it’s like a sexy twist in a caramel fragrance and theres a slight almond/amaretto note. Its has a slight perfumey vibe but in the sexiest way possible. I had gotten a 5ml and could not wait to grab a full bottle! Deff one of my top favorites from Genre! 🔥🔥


Black Opium Le Perfume: (for a while the original and intense were my favorites but this one right here….idk what it is?? She has the EXACT SAME 3 NOTES IN THE EXACT SAME ORDER AS THE OG, but ughh she just projects and smells so much better and smoother! And the longevity is better also. She’s the winner so far out of all the flankers! 


Victor & Rolf Bon Bon: idk what it is about her but she just smells so good to me! She’s my favorite out of ALL the V&R perfumes and prob always will be! (She’s simple vanilla a floral and caramel but she’s so perfectly blended she’s just beautiful to me she doesn’t smell gourmand to me but deff a timeless fave!


VS Amber Romance body mist: this has been my favorite body spray since high school and I still love her she’s still my casual need to put on something fast go to or even just to enhance another perfume! She’s just a gorgeous sweet vanilla amber fragrance that has never been duped and non of the dupe’s have compared yet :( (I still have to try Andomedas moons version and I’m hoping Dua makes her because I will scoop her up so fast!!)


 
⭐️DUAS HOLIDAY LIMITED EDITION PERFUME RELEASES:

Duas A Holiday Gourmand (A Dua Original Blend/limited edition & quantity): sometimes they bring back more if they are very popular or bring them back the following year!…..this one definitely needs time to sit for all the notes to come out more but right off the bat I get the sugared berries mostly, caramel, A little bit of a boozy note and the milk chocolate note ( in the background right now and came off as kind of a dusty coco smell on my skin )   in the dry down the sugared berries are still prominent but start to blend in with the other notes and there’s a very faint dusty milk chocolate scent way in the background. It’s a pretty gourmand scent and I will see how it develops.
Update: It started to settle and the notes started to blend together pretty quickly. On me they blended together so well that the sugar berries became very light in the mix which was the best part. Every day it changed on my skin lol one day it was really pretty the next it was okay and faded pretty quickly (it is loved by many people but I ended up decluttering because I knew it was something I wouldn’t pick up)




Body Oils/Body Butters/Perfume Oils: 
Prty grl beauty: amazing smelling oils and body butters that last!! They are very photorealistic And they have amazing prices! There’s always a discount code and/or promotion! ALL OF HER PRODUCTS ARE AMAZING!! They last long the projection is amazing they make your skin feel amazing and baby soft and she has amazing customer service. This is the 1st and last company I’ve tried for pre made body products because the price is great the products are amazing and so is the woman who runs this small business! So I don’t find the need to try another company at the moment! 

My favorite body oils scents: birthday cake, brown sugar baby, fresh cream! (Got in the nectar and body lotion such a good scent that goes with everything!)
Added:  warm cashmere body nectar, coconut Passion body nectar, almond macaroon body nectar are all really good!
Vanilla bean body nectar is your standard vanilla. 
On the way: vanilla bean marshmallow, and sugar cookie body nectar.
Also got strawberry shortcake and pink sugar which I have to try cuz wasn’t sure about the smell straight out of the bottle. strawberry shortcake out of the bottle comes of a little synthetic smelling but the perfume oil is soo good!  (But havnt tried it on the body yet so it might smell different) 

Their body butters smell amazing!! Birthday cake, almond macaroon smells amazing! (Need to try more but they are out of stock a lot of the time but I did get them in the lotions) 
Cozy sugar body butter is very light compared to her other scents.

Body lotions: favorites sweet cream, almond macaroon (sweet cream is very versatile and I love almond scents)

Their perfume oils: sooo good!! Great for a base for ur perfume or layering or great on their own!: favorites in order: 
Warm Cream: an awesome sweet /warm vanilla amber( I swear every time I order from there I stick a few in my bag lol) It reminds me of Philosophy Fresh Cream Warm Cashmere, and VS Amber Romance body spray (a little bit I have to smell those side by side. I do know Amber Romance is deff different) 
Strawberry Shortcake: smells like a photorealistic strawberry shortcake! Yumm! 
Vanilla Bean: smells like a straight up sweet vanilla I use it as a base to add a little vanillla sweetness but don’t want it to overpower a lighter perfume.
( waiting on a few others I just ordered to try!)
Coconut passion: a sweet coconut perfume oil. Perfect for summer! And to use as a base to bring out the coconut or add coconut to some of your Summer favorites! (Also love layering it with vanillas, dust of delight and sexy messy) 
Soft vanilla: literally a softer sweet vanilla perfume oil…great if you just want something sweet and light to throw on or layer
Coming: sugar cookie and sweet almond perfume oils
Cake pop: if your looking for a sweet powdery perfume that’s what I got from this (I need to try it again because normally her perfumes smell exactly like the name and this did not smelll like cake to me at all or even the notes? So maybe there was a little mix up? Maybe with pouring vanilla powder and cake pop? Although in some of the cake pop reviews ppl did describe it as powdery so it just might be my skin chem?

Mostly gourmands but also a bunch of Non Gourmand added favorites! (This list includes mostly Dua perfumes but also other brands that are Amazing!!),"
UPDATED VERSION: Okay this is mostly a list for all the gourmand lovers, vanilla/ caramel / fruity tropical bangers that will make you smell fing delicious! (Plus a bunch of Non Gourmand added favorites that were expected/unexpected loves!)

This includes mostly Dua perfumes and some honorable mentions and body oils/butters that will make u smell amazing without breaking the bank! 
(These are not in any particular order of favorite to least favorite! And everyone’s skin chemistry is different so please use the resources I’ve given in other posts!) Google! Which is your best friend😉 Fragrantica is an awesome site to get reviews on all of these fragrances especially new “inspired by” releases!) This list keeps getting long and longer! Because every week there’s constantly new releases so this has taken me a while to write because I had to keep adding the new amazing ones that were released after I started this and have been continually adding to it/ providing updates!

I’ve now also started to add in other reviews/comparisons of other popular dupe brands of some of the more popular fragrances….such as Happy dust by Narcotica, Tihota by Indult, Marshmallow scents, ect….

🔥🔥IMPORTANT:
SIDE NOTE ON MACERATION: Anything here that doesn’t mention maceration is good to go straight out of the box, but I always let my Duas sit for a little no matter what because they just get better over time and become more smooth and blended) I honestly recommend u do this with all your perfumes even if it’s just for a week after getting them so they can settle down from mail shock and once u let that 2-5 sprays out of the atomizer your allowing your perfumes to start the maceration process ! Stick them in a cool dark place like your closet or a drawer and the maceration process will start!



🔥Best Smelling Cake/ Pastry Frags: 

Duas Vanilla of the Extreme (inspired by Comptoir Sud Pacifique Vanilla Extreme): very sweet vanilla buttercream and randomly you’ll get a flakey pastry and it smells so good but the dry down is a sweet vanilla buttercream! (some people say they smell play-doh I havnt had that experience yet with any duas but everyone’s skin chem and nose is different!)


BEST CAKE PERFUME to me is by Shop Lavana: Cake perfume! (It’s like a home made vanilla cake that you pulled out of the oven and frosted it with home made butter cream while it’s still steamy!) NOTHING HAS TOPPED THIS YET THIS IS THE BEST SMELLING CAKE PERFUME!! its sweet but not overly sweet it’s amazing! 


Duas Crumbled Couture (inspired by Sniff Couture Crumbled): flakey pastry with jam (it needs to macerate a little for me but people love it straight out of the box, I like it I have a feeling it’s going to be a love)
Update: as it’s been sitting it’s gotten so much better the notes are smoother and I’m getting more of the jam note and with the flaky pastry (croissant) it’s just delicious! 


Duas Accidental Vanille: Cream of Berries (Inspiration: Accident À La Vanille - Crème De La Berry by Jousset Parfums): get her now and let her macerate! Really good smells like creamy whipped vanilla cheesecake topped with berries! 


Duas Cookies & Milk (inspired by Cerchi Nell’ Aqua Latte E Biscotti): this smells like straight up sweet flaky Sugared Biscuits upon first spray (I don’t get any creaminess or milk/ yet but the fragrance also she turns into Skin scent pretty quickly (so she’s going in time out to macerate to get stronger and a longer projection) 
Will update!
UPDATE: I lived this when I first got it but as it has sat it is stronger and longer lasting now it’s such a yummy fragrance I do get a little bit of a chocolate vibe but I think that’s more of a crunchy cookie/biscuit then chocolate that I am smelling…it has easily become one of my favorite scents!


Duas Strawberry Dream Cake (Inspired by B&BW Strawberry Pound Cake): As good as I knew it would be! Smells like a photorealistic sweet strawberry pound cake (it’s one of my favorite strawberry scents!)


Duas Blueberry Fluffy Dream Cake (Inspired by B&BW Blueberry pound cake): literally smells like blueberry pound cake (this is my 1st blueberry frag from dua because I didn’t hear great things about the other blueberry forward frags/ Dua Originals but because this one was super from an OH fragrance I felt comfortable blind buying it and it’s really good!) so far this is the 1st blueberry dominant frag Dua has made that is mass appealing.


Duas Gourmand Illusion (Inspired by Mirage Gourmand): this is basically what I expected from the reviews it literally smelly like a French bakery! I get the amaretto/almond note when I first spray it and as it drys down that amaretto note blends in and it become more nutty with like an almond cake scent in the background. It has the slightest bit of a sweet powdery nuance in the background also as it gets deeper into the dry down. This is like a pretty feminine gourmand. It’s more of an airy fragrance and this is brand new right off the truck so I will be putting it away to see how much better it can get! This is gonna layer great with marshmallow dreams, French macaroons, couture crumbled (aka wild berry jam croissant) and probably even like any sugar cookie fragrances or oils!


Genre Perfumes Miracle Essence (inspired by Essenza Miracolosa Peccato Originale): this is a miracle in a bottle honestly I just sprayed it on today and it was so good I couldn’t stop sniffing my arm. I can’t pinpoint what I was smelling it was almond/ caramel/ amaretto but like an almond cookie and the late late dry down is caramel or vanilla when it’s starting to wear off (lasts for hours!) 
UPSATE: straight up buttery almond cookie scent!! I love this so much I ordered a big bottle of it! 




🔥The BEST Vanilla Frags: Straight Vanillas First…

Duas Gourmand escape (inspired by Escapade Gourmande by Maison Mataha): straight sweet not overly sweet vanilla great for layering or wearing on its own! 


Andromedas Moon Tihota (inspired by the OG Tihota by Indult): The original is awesome! But lacks the lasting power. Andromedas moon did her thang with this one it’s slightly sweeter then the original and lasts forever! It’s the most perfectly balanced sweet vanilla of your dreams! (The formula is a bit oily but it’s so good it doesn’t bother me!) 


Duas Goddess within her (inspired by Burberry goddess): if you love Burberry goddess you’ll love this (I actually like this one a lot better! the OG was an eh for me but I smelled it on myself next to replicas by the fireplace which smelled fing amazing on my skin so I don’t think it was a fair shot I gave her lol…save your money get duas they are pretty much identical!)

Duas Vanillac Dreams (Inspired by Indult Tihota): this did not dissapoint! Gorgeous vanilla (like always!) it is deff not ready to go straight from the box it does need time to macerate but you can’t go wrong with tihota she’s literally the PERFECT VANILLA!! (Smells almost exactly the same as andromedas moons except AM’a version is good to go straight from the box and might be a little sweeter) 


Genre’s Mello Vanilla (inspired by Escapade Gourmande by Maison Mataha): it smells very similar to Duas Gourmand Escapade but maybe the tiniest bit less sweet? It’s still really good to me but u don’t need both they both last and project really well! 


💜Honorable mentions:
Update on Vanillac dreams above:
Duas Vanillac Dreams (Inspired by Tihota by Indult)
Literally 2 notes vanilla and musk (you can’t really smell the musk it’s just there to prolong the longevity like in most gourmands) it’s a sweet straight forward vanilla that runs out of stock within seconds every time it’s restocked on the Dua site, so it is a very popular fragrance great on its own or layering (as you can see there are several hybrids made with Vanillac Dreams! (And they’re all awesome!)




🔥Gourmand Vanilla Frags:

Duas Vaniglia Dreams ( a hybrid of their inspo of the OG Tihota (Vanillac Dreams) and the OG Mazzolari Vaniglia (Duas Vaniglia): ughh this one is so good it’s perfect! It’s sweet it’s a little buttery vanilla, it’s heaven in a bottle! It smells like if werthers caramels and vanilla had a baby and you mixed in some creamy butter. I can’t tell if I’m smelling more vanilla or caramel it is so well blended and just perfect! (It needs to macerate to get stronger!) 
P.S: I havnt tried either of duas versions of vanillac dream or duas vaniglia but heard they are amazing as well! (But I havnt had the need to try them since Vaniglia dreams is so good and I found tihota by andromedas moon but duas vaniglia and vanillac dreams is on my list to try still just out of curiosity)
Update: tried Vanillac dreams you really can’t go wrong with this scent it’s the perfect vanilla (mine still needs to macerate right now it is pretty light)


Duas Holiday Vanilla Delight (inspired by B&BW Vanilla Bean Noel): buttery sweet vanilla with the tiniest bit of cocoa that u can’t smell but it deff enhances the vanilla! 


Duas THE Vanilla (inspired by Fire at Will by Jovoy Paris): this is delicious! It’s a sweet warm vanilla with some brown sugar that enhances it to that next level! It’s Called THE Vanilla for a reason!!


Duas Chantilly Vanilla ( Inspired by Vanille De Chantilly by II Profumiere): I waited forever for this one to restock and it did not disappoint! This is on the lighter side right now So I’m going to let it sit to get stronger. This is a delicious Vanilla it smells like sweet buttercream frosting and marshmallows vibe Or like a fluffy buttercream frosting. It’s the perfect amount of sweetness! I can’t wait until it gets stronger! 




🔥Vanilla/Caramel Frags:

Duas White Milk ( inspired by Bianco Latte with enhanced notes) This was my first ever Dua purchased! (I was looking for the OG Bianco latte on Mercari and this one kept popping up constantly! So I looked on duas site it had rave reviews so I tried it and fell in LOVE!! I will never get sick of this perfume it’s PERFECTION!! It’s a creamy Vanilla and Caramel that are blended sooo perfectly I don’t know which one I’m smelling and the honey enhances the formula to the next level! (This last hours on my skin into the next day! I stop counting after 6-8 hours cuz damn! And he projection is amazing right out of the box she just gets better the longer she sits….this is a beast mode fragrance!!)
P.S: this is Duas enhanced version of Bianco latte they will be coming out with a White Milk 2.0 that will be an EXACT REPLICA (duas words) of Bianco Latte (which I will be trying cuz y not?) 


Duas White Milk: Condensed Milk (inspired by Bianco latte with the added note of Condensed Milk): people love this one who aren't fans of the original White Milk because the Honey note is toned down a lot in this one! I can hardly smell it honestly! When I first got this I didn’t like it, it didn’t smell even close to white milk to me it smelled light and a tiny bit powdery sink out her in time out tried her again about a month later (and this might be just the one I got because most people say it’s ready to go straight from the box!) but now she smells like a lighter version of white milk with a tiny bit of sweet powder way wayy in the background (I love the OG White Milk but this one I’ll be using to layer to get the white milk vibe without taking over the entire fragrance like the OG WM usually does) 


Duas White Milk 2.0 (Inspired by Bianco Latte but with no enhanced notes, it’s suppose to be a 1-1 dupe of Bianco Latte): honestly I love white milk better the enhanced honey note is just gorgeous but this is perfect for layering!! The OG White Milk usually takes over fragrances so this one deff is not a beast straight out of the box like The OG White Milk it does need some time to macerate but because that honey note is toned down it is perfect for layering!! If you Love Bianco Latte you will love this!! Deff will be getting bubs of this!!💜
‼️SIDE NOTE: Because all of Duas White milks are different in their own way the best way to find out which one u like the most is by getting samples from a decanter! Or you might love them all for different reasons! ( the best one to probably start with if you are new and have never tried a Bianco latte dupe is White Milk 2.0 because that one is the closest option to the OG formula)


Duas Cloud of Caramel Vanilla (A Dua Original Blend):  this one is good to go right out of the box and she lasts!! Again a perfect blend of Caramel and vanilla I think I get a little more Caramel then Vanilla but it’s a straight forward Sweet Caramel Vanilla fragrance! 


Dua’s Sweet Serenade (A Dua Original Blend): if you ever wanted to try that waffle one perfume this is what I think it would smell like (except I e heard from sooo many ppl this one was wayyy better!!) 
This smells like a a waffle cone with vanilla ice cream(and the ice cream note literally smells like vanilla icecream it gives u a cold sweet airy vanilla vibe) with caramel on top. (It smells really good I think this can be worn anytime of the year because it isn’t a super heavy gourmand the stand out notes to my nose are deff the waffle cone and caramel with the vanilla ice cream in the background but still there the other notes are just a little stronger right now, but this is a new bottle so as it macerates knowing how duas do the ice cream note will deff get stronger)


Duas Holiday White Milk Vanilla Delight (a hybrid inspired by Holiday Vanilla Delight mixed with White Milk 2.0): this smells amazing!! I will be getting backups right now the white milk is taking over at the end but I know from the first spray when u can smell both equally once it sits and blends together this is going to be amazing!! And the added custard note to add creaminess is just chefs kiss🔥🔥


Duas White Milk Gourmand Escape (A hybrid of Duas White milk (Bianco Latte) and Duas Gourmand Escape (Escapade Gourmand): I love Duas White Milk and Duas Gourmand Escape. This was part of a bundle I purchased with Puffletuft so I already knew I would love it! If you love both of those scents, they are amazing together! The gourmand escape adds sweetness and mellows out the honey note in white milk a little but it’s just perfection! (You can get the same effect from layering but I will be using this up and layering them in the future!)


Duas Joyful You (Inspired by Gioiosa by Profumum Roma): this is DEFF in the Bianco Latte category!! I love this scent tho!! It is literally Bianco latte without the honey note but with the most delicious sweet coconut note added to it!! Absolutely gorgeous SIDE NOTE: (now I just need Dua to take that coconut note and bottle it up so I can layer it or where it on its own it is the best coconut note I have ever smelled!)


-Dua’s Vanilla Caramel Fantasy (Inspired by New Notes Caramel Vanille): this is giving light to moderate projection straight from the box so it’s going in time out for a little. If you’ve tried other dupes you already know this is a good one! This is a sweet caramel vanilla with a slight powdery touch in the background. 



🔥Complex Vanillas:

Duas Drowning in Vanilla (inspired by Nishane Ani): I was worried about this one but it ended up being really good! It smells like a warm sweet vanilla (not overly sweet) with a tiny bit of spice/ginger and a tiny bit of woodyness it’s sooo good. (Theirs hybrids with this which I can see being really good together/layered like with by the fireplace (Dua has a hybrid of it already) or the any of the BR540/ BR540 nights inspired scents, amber fragrances, and always other simple vanillas if u want it to be a little more sweet) 


Duas Alexandria’s Vanillac Dreams (A hybrid of Duas Alexandria Short and Duas Vanillac Dreams inspired by Tihota): I’ve wanted to try this one for a while I heard amazing things about it and I’m so happy I was able to snatch it up before selling out! Cuz it went quick! (It’s being vaulted but u can always layer the 2 which I always like doing anyway cuz I can control which one I want more/less of. Or when the vault opens they let you know which ones will be released) it still needs time to macerate but it’s mostly a sweet vanilla with a little bit of citrus and a tiny bit of musk. I’ll update when it macerates more but so far it’s really good! 


Duas Spice Vanilla Extrait 21 (inspired by Guerlains Vanilla Planifolia Extrait 21): This is soooo good!! This is the 1st Guerlain Perfume I’ve liked after trying a few! ……its not overly Powderly or overly spicy it’s a sweet vanilla with a tiny bit of spice that’s barely noticeable but there and gives it a little razzle dazzle and the tiniest hint of powder that’s almost undetectable but just adds something a little extra to the perfume! She not overly classy (like I find most Guerlains to be…..like a rich classy old lady who’s going to a high end function and dressed to the 9 but also very proper) no, this is a vanilla that’s different enough to add to your collection (and wear on a daily basis if you want to!) but smells amazing! (She isn’t a skin scent but she is on the lighter side of a moderate projecting fragrance)    


Duas Joyful You (inspired by Gioiosa by Profumum Roma): this just dropped recently and I just got it today so it is very light right now but she’s beautiful! A lot of the reviews on Fragrantica compared her to Bianco Latte and it is really close! (But without the honey note) I get the Bianco Latte Vibe (vanilla and light caramel) but there’s a gorgeous sweet coconut in this scent that takes it to the next level! I will deff update as she macerates more but I know she’s going to be a banger because she’s already loved in the fragrance community!
UPDATE: she took about a month to macerate maybe less and the bianco latte scent is deff there now and that delicious coconut note you can still smell but it’s blended in, you literally get bianco Latte without the honey note and some sweet coconut it’s gorgeous! 


Duas Vanilla Ice Cream (Inspired by Vice Vanilla Ice Cream): this isn’t an Ice cream fragrance at all! But it’s more of a yummy sweet but not to sweet woody vanilla. (I love layering this with Tihota or Gourmand Escape! It amps up the sweetness in the Vanilla Ice Cream and makes the straight Vanillas a little more complex)


Duas Bill-ish (Inspired by Eilish by Billie Eilish): if you love Eilish or Lattafa Nebras you will love this because this is an exact dupe except projection and longevity amped up by 10! You get the berries, the Vanilla, a little bit of the cocoa  it’s a really pretty, Awesome Dupe! (Good to go straight out the box) 


Dua’s Plumb and Vanilla (inspired by Ariana Grande’s Mod Vanilla): the plumb is so juicy in this and Mixed with the sweet vanilla it’s really pretty if you love Mod Vanilla but wish it lasted longer and the projection was better deff try this one out! (Good to go straight out the box)


Dua’s Magic of Vanilla (Inspired by Kayali Vanilla 28): they did an amazing job with this!! This is Vanilla 28 on steroids!! It’s that gorgeous Amber Vanilla we all love and know except the projection and longevity is amped up to 100!! (I do recommend letting it sit for a little the notes blend together and smooth out more, but she is really strong and good to go straight out of the box!)…..it’s truly a gorgeous Vanilla!🔥🔥


Duas Coffee Escape in Tiramisu (Inspired by  Dolce Treviso by Acca Kappa): I love this scent (it is sitting in time out right now to get stronger because it is a little light but once it gains projection💜!) this literally smells like gourmand escape (a simple sweet vanilla) with a hint of sweet light coffee in the background. Soo good I already have a few bubs of this one!🔥🔥


 Dua’s Radiant Mystery (Inspired by Morph disumono): she’s in time out she needs to sit for a good month or 2. Other people might be getting ones that have had more time to macerate because they are getting the sweet coconut , vanilla , caramel fragrance she is suppose to be! Mine is just taking her sweet time but she is getting a little sweeter little by little! 
UPDATE:


 Dua’s Amber Drench In Vanilla (Inspired by Melipona by Nectar Olfactif): this one smells delicious she’s literally the sweet vanilla amber I’ve been looking for! You get the sweet warm vanilla mostly but it’s complimented by this sweet by slightly resinous amber. She is very light when first sprayed so she is going into timeout for a month or so and I’ll check on her every week or so, and will update!
1 week update: She has deff gotten slightly stronger and the longevity/projection is still light but with a good 3-4 hours wear time at that strength before getting even lighter and soon disappearing!
UPDATE: 


🔥Caramel Frags:

Duas Caramelized Condensed Milk (A Dua Original): mmmmm shes good! She’s creamy she’s caramel! She smells like Werthers Caramel soft chews melted/blended with sweet cream. (Good to go straight out the box) 


Duas Caramel Sugar Elixir (A Dua Original Blend):She’s a little bit richer of a caramel! Straight to the point Caramel! 


 Duas Italiano (Inspired by Italica by Xerjoff): this is a beast right out of the box! (It does need some time for the notes to smooth out) this is a darker richer caramel/toffee and lactonic fragrance (it took me a longgggg time to pick this one up because it isn’t a safe blind buy because of how crazy this one projects but I did find one for a great price and grabbed it when I saw them make a hybrid with White Mik (which is one of my all time favorite duas) and decided to layer them I actually like this one on its own but layered with White Milk it’s soo good! (deff a winter frag!) 


💜(Honorable mention: because I’m waiting for her to macerate till fall!) 
Duas Caramelized Stone (A Dua Original):
She starts off as a pretty light caramel (but I heard she has to macerate for quite some time….6 months!! Which is really long!! But turns into an awesome smelling Caramel Coconut scent…I’ll come back to update to say if she was worth the wait! lol)
UPDATE: she’s getting stronger I can now smell the coconut peaking thru….im going to keep letting her sit till she’s perfect! 






🔥Cotton Candy Frags: 

Cotton Candy Milk (A Dua Original): to me this is a great creamy cotton candy! It’s light but not insanely light that you can’t smell it, to me it’s great for summer and gets better and a little stronger every time I spray it! 
Update: it’s fully macerated now and the sillage is pretty strong with a 1 spray test. It smells like creamy cotton candy (weirdly I’m starting to smell milkylicious?(some days I do and some days I don’t?) Which I didn’t at all when I first got her but also never smelled milkylicious before so I’m trying to let my mind clear out the milkylicious smell and go back to her 😂) idk if ppl convinced me in the group so now it’s what I think about? or what’s going on?


Duas My Baby Cotton Candy (hybrid of Melanie Martinez Cry Baby Milk and Duas Cotton Candy De Dua): at first I wasn’t sure about this one but tried her 2 weeks later and she smells amazing! Like a straight up light strawberry note with cotton candy , one doesn’t over power the other, it’s just really good and the projection and longevity was really good for a 1 spray test (lasted 4-6 hrs? Maybe around 5-6 hrs she started to get closer to the skin?)


Duas Happiness of Soft Cloud (inspired by Cerchi Nell’ Aqua Zucchero Filato): oh man first sprayed she’s beautiful a literal TRUE Sweet Airy cotton candy! (Some ppl say they smell berries but I think cotton candy is one of those scents that can be different for everyone depending on what memory u have when smelling it, or what u think it should smell like in your mind. So to me it just smells like a true sweet airy cotton candy fragrance) 


Duas Fluffy Caramel Spun Sugar: this is a lighter scent right now (I’m waiting to see if it gains some more projection.) But it’s a beautiful airy caramel cotton candy scent. This is great for summer just how it is and it isn’t so light that you can’t smell it, you can deff smell her! If anyone was going to be able to make caramel into an airy cotton candy scent it was Dua, and they did that!


 Duas Sugary Fantasy of Cotton Candy: A Dua Original Blend): FINALLY was able to get my hands on Sugary fantasy of Cotton Candy and she’s sitting in time out to gain some projection which I knew from other reviews she was going to have to Macerate. I see where people get that she smell like gourmand escape from this one! It does smell like gourmand escape mixed with a more dense cotton Candy smell (once she gets to her full potential I know she’s going to be insanely good, but right now if you have gourmand escape you won’t need this even though there is a slight difference, it is kind of redundant to have both. 
UPDATE: OKAY she’s been macerating and getting stronger she is kind of similar to gourmand escape but not enough that u can’t have both…I LOVE IT!! Its sugary cotton candy with a slight airiness to it but it’s still strong enough that you can smell it and then you get the gourmand escape vibes but it isn’t as dense as gourmand escape…..if gourmand escape wasn’t for you I would deff try this one out! So far I have never seen anyone complain about this scent only love for this one which I get why!💕


Duas Faraway Iris Fields (Inspired by Gourmand Vanilla & Iris by My Perfumes Select  ): the notes/description for this one DO NOT match how it smells!! (The only part of the description I do agree with is when you spray this on it literally “evokes feelings of peace and serenity”) This is a lighter scent but it’s soo pretty it literally smells like light cotton candy/bubblegum and it’s has a slight creaminess once it dries down. Even after macerating for months this isn’t a crazy projecting scent but it’s not as light as Marshmallow delight or Dust of Delight, it’s a tiny bit stronger and does last. This one is gorgeous on its own or layered to add some sweetness (easy grab for summer!)
UPDATE: they fixed faraway Iris Fields the current version that came out Black Friday is not what I described up above it is as the notes describe it an airy patchouli woody frag! (They are trying to recreate whatever the first faraway Iris fields was!

Dua’s Apricot Vanilla (Inspired by Vanilla Apricot by Comptoir Sid Pacifique): this doe not smell like the OG 1st Release from Dua of faraway Iris Fields (in the beginning) it starts off with a sweet clementine note (I know it’s suppose to be apricots but I’m getting clementine!) and then the vanilla comes in and as it dries down the sweet clementine and vanilla blend together. This was surprising to me and I think because it’s on the lighter side and more sweet I didn’t mind the clementine plus blended with a sweet sugary vanilla it’s really good! But about 10-15 min later I get the dry down of faraway Iris Fields (Duas 1st release) this is a brand new bottle so as it macerates it might change but I was happy with this one! And there is nothing like it in my collection! 


💜Honorable mentions: (I have not tried these but hear amazing things! And their on my list!)
Duas Sugary Fantasy of Cotton Candy (A Dua Original): I have been trying to get this for soooo long! Unfortunately I had ordered it and my order said it was sent out then I received an email saying they were out of stock :( I hear this is a sugary airy sweet spun cotton candy light vanilla fragrance (some people say it’s exactly like Duas gourmand escape which I personally love but that’s a more of a straight vanilla to me and not very airy at all so I’m still curious!)
UPDATE ABOVE on Sugary Fantasy!!

Duas Cotton Candy de Dua (A Dua Original Blend): A lot of people love this perfume! It’s cotton candy with a tiny bit of musk (great for layering and more of a grown up cotton candy but still can’t wait to try because of the rave reviews!)
UPDATE: Heard it’s on the muskier side but the longer it sits the better it gets and it’s more of a fruity cotton candy




🔥Marshmallow Frags: 

Duas AI Marshmallow Dream: literally smells like marshmallows when you first open a bag of marshmallows and you stick your nose in to smell that first wonderful whiff of Marshmallows! (Very light scent so far (heard it gets stronger as it macerates) but great for layering!)
UPDATE: it has gotten a little bit stronger ( mine has been sitting for a while!) but it’s still a very light marshmallow scent. (It might also just be my nose or skin chem because a lot of people loveee this one! My friend told me to layer it with Vanillac Dreams which is on its way! She said it brings out the scent more. So I will deff be trying that combo soon!) 


Duas Strawberry Cream and Marshmallows (Inspired by Marshmallow by Cerchi Nell’ Aqua): This literally smells like Sweet fresh strawberry’s and whipped Marshmallows (straight out the box great projection and longevity!) sooo good!! 


Duas Fluffy Marshmallows (A Dua Original Blend):  i was just going to wait and purchase this when it restocked as more of a layering scent but I finally found someone selling this one at a great price! Another one I waited wayy too long to try because I heard it just smelled like sugar (or Sabrina’s sweet tooth which I havnt tried) but Ik the one I purchased has been sitting for a little because it hasn’t restocked in a while and I’m in loveee! It smells like sugared vanilla and gooey sweet marshmallow in the background! (I heard you do have to let this one sit and macerate for the marshmallow to come out so keep that in mind!) but this is also great for layering I sprayed it next to not your average beach scent by Dua and the combo is sooo good! 
This is deff BUB worthy to me and I can see endless combos with this one! 




🔥Gourmand Cherry Frags: 

Duas French Macaroons (A Dua Original Blend): I love this! To me It doesn’t smell like a heavy/sweet gourmand cookie at all! (Even after macerating for Months!) This smells like a Maraschino Cherry marinated in Amaretto. It’s such a good sweet cherry scent that’s amazing for layering! (As you can see! There are like 10 hybrids created with this Dua Original!)  Ive tried 1 of the earlier hybrids but the cherry kind of gets overtaken by Duas White Milk (which is a beast mode fragrance) in my experience or dulled down because of the other fragrance. 
But the more recent ones I do have on my list because I think they figured out how to keep the cherry note in French macarons from being over taken by the other frag mixed in with it (but if u have both the perfumes you could just layer to get the perfect intensity of both for whatever layering combo your going for.


Duas French Macaroons White Milk (hybrid of Duas French Macaroons and White Milk):
(after macerating for a pretty long time! The cherry scent from French macaroons does stay a while along with white milk. White milk is a tiny bit stronger! (But because I loved 💜white milk so much this was an obsessive / need to get it out of my system purchase lol) At first I could barley smell the cherrry the white milk was dulled down a bit from the original but still took over, after macerating for (it’s been a while like 4-6 months) the cherry stays there for almost the entire life of the perfume along with the white milk. (But again I could get the same thing with layering, but I do use her and love her!) 


Duas Hooked on Cherry (Inspired by Cherry Hook by Gleam): so this is more of a sexier darker cherry fragrance it kind of smells like Tom Fords Lost Cherry but with a little bit of a sweeter cherry note. This is not spicy or medicinal at all!! This is such an underrated fragrance if you love cherry fragrances I would deff give this one a try! I’m actually going to layer it with a simple vanilla and see how that is also and I also think this would be great layered with by the fire (Duas fireplace) or even a coconut scent! And BR540! This is more of a winter cherry perfume to me! 


Dua’s French Macaroons Gourmand Escape (hybrid of French Macaroons and Gourmand Escape): this is the perfect cherry vanilla. I love French Macaroons it’s the perfect maraschino cherry to me and mixed with vanilla ….Perfection! (If you have both just layer I got a great deal on this and needed to grab 1 more perfume lol so I choose this one but u can literally layer them and get the same result) 




🔥Tropical/ Fruity Gourmand Frags: (lighter summery vibes) 

Caramelized Pinapple Dream (inspired by Nota Sugar by Ulyka Perfumes): I wasn’t sure about her when I first purchased her but I am sooo glad I did! She’s literally sweet sugary pineapple with a little bit of caramel and vanilla to add the tiniest bit of Warmth and sweetness, but still a perfect juicy light summer scent (but not overly light because I like to smell my frags! lol) 


Coconut Milk (inspired by Le Monde Gourmand Lait De Coco):  okay I LOVE the original of this scent (but I have to spray myself A Lot to smell it and it doesn’t last to long even when you do that 🙃) so when I saw Dua had created it I had to grab it! 
This is not a sun tan lotion coconut but initial spray is a little perfumey with light coconut.
Now the dry down on my skin the perfumey smell I got on the initial spray went away and it settled into this really pretty coconut scent. The coconut comes out more and I get a very tiny bit of creaminess (this lasts for the duration of the perfume.) theirs the slightest bit of sweetness but not much.
To me this is a perfect summer scent! It has an airy, clean vibe to it. (It’s sitting cuz that perfumey scent is going to blend in and I think the coconut/sweetness and creaminess will come out more) 
Update: after sitting for about 2 weeks the perfumey scent has blended in and is almost undetectable it’s still there a tiny bit but the sweetness of the coconut has come out more and so has the creaminess and she’s getting stronger……shes good!! (This is the coconut frag I layer with other tropical scents to bring out or add a straight up sweet coconut note to them, love layering this with dust of delight, I’m a sexy mess rolling out of bed, and ur basic vanillas or caramels)


Coconut Gelato (Dua Original Blend): so good! Not what I was expecting but I didn’t read the notes lol I thought it was gonna go quick cuz it’s going into the vault. It’s like a sweet creamy fruity summer ice cream.You get a little coconut but it’s very well blended with the pineapple and peach. It’s like a sweet tropical creamy desert!


Duas Rise of the Pina Colada (Inspired by Akro Rise): At first I did not like this the Tiare floral note over took everything (I’m not a floral fan so to me this note was to much) I debating putting it up for sale like a week later when I tested it again. I did end up listing it but then tested it again randomly like 3-4 weeks later I could smell the tiare flower slightly but it was now blended in wayy more! The other notes became more prominent. Now it smells like a sweet Pina colada, slightly creamy coconut and maybe a little sandalwood but blended perfectly….this one to me is a like but not a love compared to the others but it depends on your preference/skin chem so I see why ppl love it!


Duas Creamy Pina Colada (inspired by Coco Nana by Rirana): sooo good a little light but that’s what maceration is for. She’s the perfect scent to me! She’s literally a photo realistic sweet creamy pina colada!


Duas Coconut Crush (Inspired by VS Coconut Passion Body Spray): also a banger if you love the body spray you’ll love this! 


Duas Paradise Leisure (inspired by Leisure in Paradise by Narcotica): it’s a little weak right now but smells like a tropical vacation in a bottle I know it’s going to be sooo good as it gets stronger! Will update!!
Update: she’s a lot stronger and so good she’s a tropical vacation in a bottle, very different from all my other tropical scents on here and I love her! Idk which notes I’m picking up because they are blended so well but it’s a beautiful blend like I should be on a tropical island laying on the beach sand with a drink in my hand while the bright blue water and smell of fresh exotic fruits surround me every time the wind blows slightly!


Duas Wave Rider (inspired by Room 1015 Wavechild): okay just got her today so there will be an update! The reviews said this smells like a watermelon jolly rancher and she does but to me she smells like an aquatic watermelon scent. So pretty great for summer and sooo different from anything in my collection! I can’t wait until she macerates a little more to see how much better she gets!         This is my first aquatic scent since I got Dolce and Gabbana Light Blue when I was like 14 because it wasn’t my vibe but I was excited to have an expensive perfume at the time so I still wore it sometimes lol. So this makes me excited to try a few more aquatic scents in the future but with a little twist lol!


 Duas Paradise Scented Coconut (inspired by B&BW Coco Paradise): this one is different then all my other summer scents I can deff smell the neroli when I first spray it and as it dries down the sandalwood and coconut comes in.  This is more of a sensual airy summertime fragrance good for a date during the day or night.
UPDATE: as it’s been sitting I’ve really started to enjoy this more and more! The notes became more blended and I get more of a coconut scent (but not a suntan lotion coconut) more of a straight coconut with a little bit of sweetness and then there’s a little bit of a salty smell that makes you feel like your at the beach and as you breath in you catch a whiff of the salty beach breeze. So the slightly salty sweet coconut with the base notes in the background adding a little something more to this makes it beautiful! Perfect for the summer/beach days! I have no other coconut like this in my collection and I have a lot of coconut scents lol because I loveee coconut! 


Dua’s Apricot Vanilla (Inspired by Vanilla Apricot by Comptoir Sid Pacifique): this doe not smell like the OG 1st Release from Dua of faraway Iris Fields (in the beginning) it starts off with a sweet clementine note (I know it’s suppose to be apricots but I’m getting clementine!) and then the vanilla comes in and as it dries down the sweet clementine and vanilla blend together. This was surprising to me and I think because it’s on the lighter side and more sweet I didn’t mind the clementine plus blended with a sweet sugary vanilla it’s really good! But about 10-15 min later I get the dry down of faraway Iris Fields (Duas 1st release) this is a brand new bottle so as it macerates it might change but I was happy with this one! And there is nothing like it in my collection! 


Dua’s Not Your Basic Beach Scent (Inspired by St. Barts by QUAI): this scent is gorgeous!! Deff for summer it’s light but in the most beautiful way….it literally smells like your getting hit by a fresh breeze in the tropics with a light scent of blended exotic fruit…..I’m deff smelling the ocean breeze accord a little bit of the orange blossom and dragonfruit and the other notes, this is literally the perfect blend for layering or wearing on its own! 💕",1,1736322492.0,Dua_Perfumes,0,1.0,False

I’ve been traveling around Cebu and absolutely loving it here—the people, beaches, food, and overall vibe are incredible.

I’ve explored so many places, from Oslob in the south all the way to Bantayan Island in the north. Along the way, I’ve been trying to learn a bit of Bisaya, and a lot of locals smile when I say something. Not sure if it’s because I sound funny or they just appreciate the effort!

One of my favorite local foods is sisig and pusô, and when it comes to sweets, I can’t get enough of halo-halo. What’s amazing is how every city here has its own specialty dishes—it’s such a cool way to try something new based on where you are!

I’ve also been trying my hand at karaoke, but let’s just say I’m still a work in progress.

Anyway, I’d love to connect with locals or fellow travelers to make the experience even better. If you know any hidden gems, great food spots, or cool things to do, let me know! I’m also down to meet up, share stories, or just grab a coffee.

Feel free to drop a comment or PM me. Let’s make some great memories!

Firstly, this post is not sponsored, I don't get paid to talk to you about this.

I wanted to share one of my preffered coffee torefateur with you, based in France, and is delicious.

Lomi café (https://lomi.cafe), they also do training and have a coffeeshop next to their workshop in Paris. You can buy on their site or on MaxiCoffee. They actually provide several coffee in Paris also.

Their prices range from 9€ to more than 30€ for a 250g bag of coffee

They recently experimented with a ""Beaujolais"" method (yes, like the wine), I'll let you read about it on the site if you're interested.

I'm still experiencing with their Beaujolais coffee so I can't really recommend one or the other.

Cheers!

1hweefr,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1hweefr/i_fd_up_and_made_myself_hurt_more/,I f’d up and made myself hurt more,"Today I (26M) messed up.

My ex-fiancée (24F) of two years left me three months ago. It took us about three weeks to sort everything out—joint finances, pets, furniture—so I was still seeing and talking to her every day during that time. After that, the longest we managed to go no contact was only three weeks.

I was really struggling over the holidays, so I reached out on Boxing Day. We talked a bit, but I started leaning towards wanting to get back together, and she stopped replying. Then, I reached out again on New Year’s with the same outcome.

Today, I found out my dad has stage 4 cancer, and I was really struggling. I called her because I just didn’t know who else to turn to. But instead of support, the conversation shifted back to the relationship. I still don’t fully understand why she left, and part of me feels like if we could just talk things through properly, we could rebuild and be stronger than before.

Right after the call, I felt terrible and wanted to apologize—I knew it wasn’t fair to put that on her. But before I could send the message, I realized she had blocked me on everything.

It feels like I’m reliving the day she left all over again. I feel so stupid for still waking up every morning missing her. For knowing that, even now, if she called, I’d answer in a heartbeat. For smelling the coffee from our favorite café near work and having to fight back tears. I can’t even go in the room that was her office or sit on the spot on the couch where she used to sit.

I know she was my soulmate—I feel it in every fibre of my being. And now, I’ve done the one thing I never wanted to do: push her even further away.",1,1736321352.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Hear ye, hear ye, we are here today to pass judgement on one Penelope Muis, who stands accused of being an untrustworthy b@tch. Therefore it falls to us to review all the evidence and determine: what sort of person is Penelope Muis?

Let’s start with her chatroom communications with Bentley. She’s mentioned as being a Thiefnet member, and clearly knows Bentley and co. are a criminal enterprise, so she’s not an entirely law-abiding citizen (which only makes sense, if she were Bentley would likely never even have considered her for a role in the Cooper Gang). She initially rejects the offer, but then throws down a challenge to “know yer not just a pack of jokers… and worth my time”. When Bentley accepts the offer she seems surprised, and wishes them luck, “your gonna need it!!”. As the challenge was to beat her at her own game, this indicates to me that she thinks highly of herself, is perhaps even a bit cocky. This is supported later in the game when she casually confirms that she is indeed “a heck of a woman”, and later still when she insists on disarming a boobytrapped chest by herself, which gets her into trouble.   

The next time we hear Penelope speaking is as the Black Baron, giving the introductory speech to the pilots of the ACES Competition. The main thrust of the speech is to welcome “my esteemed comrades of the skies”, and to warn the guests not to go outside for any “good-natured” hi-jinx, on pain of being “beaten to within an inch of your life”. It is possible that this was a new policy intended specifically to make Sly’s job harder (recall that being the one who gave the challenge in the first place, Penelope would know the Cooper Gang was in attendance), but the Baron’s wording, the sarcastic comment made by a pilot in response, and Bentley’s comments later regarding the sewer security all suggest that this had been going on for a while.

There is no indication that the Black Baron derives pleasure from this brutality, in fact he seems mostly exasperated at the unsportsmanlike behavior of his guests. And in truth, the guests are quite awful, they’re laughing about sabotaging each other’s safety equipment and putting rat poison into Team Muggshot’s coffee machine. When Interpol-most-wanted-gangster *Muggshot* has the moral high ground, you know it’s a tough crew. It’s not unreasonable to guess that Penelope initiated the curfew policy legitimately because she was tired of these mooses and badgers being asses and undermining the spirit of the competition.

It's also quite a hammy performance. Given this and her exuberance in the chat room, it’s possible that she feels freer to loosen up when she’s not being herself. She is noticeably more sedate in her demeanor elsewhere in the game, with two notable exceptions… when she is playing at pirate, whether in the company of Bentley opening a double-button security door or when engaged in a duel to the death amongst a ship’s rigging, and when she is causing mayhem, throwing guards through the sky with her chopper or smashing security drones, she’s as boisterous and quippy as Murray, a surprising point of commonality, the girl loves to trash-talk. And is perhaps also into roleplay.

Later, as Sly is climbing the Baron’s castle, he overhears the Baron monologuing at a guard about the upcoming tournament. He sounds positively giddy at the prospect of the competition and the upcoming demonstration of skill, “I tell you, Kristoff, the ACES pilots get better and better… we'll witness some *legendary* dogfighting!” and reiterates his disappointment at the other competitors’ poor sportsmanship in sabotaging each other. This suggests that Penelope enjoys the thrill of combat and pitting her skills up against another (perhaps compare Sly’s insistence on robbing from master criminals because “there's no honor, no challenge, no fun stealing from ordinary people”), which would make sense for a girl who wanted to dogfight so badly she adopted a whole new persona to do so and then climbed the ranks into a world-renowned celebrity doing it, and who is enough of a perfectionist to meet Bentley’s standards for the Cooper Vault job. It’s even all-but-explicitly stated by Sly in his assessment of the Black Baron in the setup to the chapter: “He's so good that he's even set up an international competition called ACES to attract worthy opponents.” While far less overtly competitive after ditching the Black Baron persona, Penelope later expresses dreamy respect for Bentley when he beats up a half-dozen pirates singlehandedly, and it would also partially explain her amor of Sly, “I love to see him pull off those athletic moves!” Her admiration for skill is also demonstrated, albeit in the context of engineering rather than combat, when she sees Reme Lousteau’s diving equipment: “It's so intricate. Your grandfather was an artist.” She respects and acknowledges talent in others when she sees it.

The Baron also expresses concern about the possibility of losing at this time, the bluster is couched as reassurances for Kristoff, but given the guard’s lack of expressed interest (he seems half-asleep), it’s probably mostly to reassure herself.  

A final intriguing ambiguity: when the Baron says “we've got some real competition on our hands this year”, is Penelope referring to the other teams in general, or specifically to the Cooper Gang?

Earlier in that same scene, climbing the castle, Sly overhears the Black Baron muttering to himself, complaining about the work ethic of the guards. What’s interesting about this line is that, even if one assumes that every line Penelope speaks to others is a façade, a carefully crafted performance which reveals nothing of her true character, there is no one around (that the Baron knows of) to hear these mutterings, no audience to perform for. Such lines are thus the most likely of any to reflect her true thoughts. What does this say then, about Penelope the mouse?

Speculating, but I think Penelope holds herself to high standards, and expects the same from others.  This possibly makes her abrasive to work with (we don’t know how hard a taskmaster she was versus how lazy her guards actually were, only that a significant number of them were willing to betray her for an indeterminate amount of pay), but she seems perfectly cordial with people who can keep up with her and meet those standards, if her interaction with the Gang is any indication. She is not hesitant in the least to praise Murray for his quick-thinking or Dimitri for his frogman fighting skills.

Notably Penelope is never short-tempered when outside of her Black Baron persona. She brushes off minor setbacks with a quick exclamation (such as “drat” or “argh!”), and generally even major setbacks she responds to with a grim fatality: “We just ran out of options.” Even when the other members of the gang screw up, she doesn’t get angry. There is no indication of animosity as a result of Murray’s ill-advised cannonball in China (although they don’t actually interact after that point so it’s difficult to judge), and even after Dimitri came onto her most forwardly she still tries to console him in his failure to retrieve the Cooper cane, sole key to the vault, “you did your best”, and when she does finally make her leave it’s with a polite excuse and a befuddled “you have fun being you.” The only time we really see her panic at a failure is in Tsao’s treasure vault, a failure which could be construed as hers, but no more-so than the aforementioned incidents regarding Murray and Dimitri. She’s harder on herself than her teammates.

After climbing the castle, the next relevant scene is during Bentley’s art-decryption, where we get a classic Sly Cooper villain intercom message. Very classic, the Black Baron swaps between friendly and intimidating at the drop of a pin, and warns his men that “if we lose, if *I* lose” he will “dismiss the lot of you and start clean with a new staff”. It’s ambiguous if this is a mob-style “dismissal” or not, although if ACES is a legitimate institution, the latter seems far more plausible (there is some question about whether or not the ACES competition was legal, but if the tournament was outright illegal, why didn’t Carmelita start busting everyone there when she showed up, as she so often did in her pursuit of Sly?). It also makes sense that, this year of all years, the Baron would make this threat: if the Black Baron loses, the Cooper Gang would come to collect on their bet, Penelope would be joining the Cooper Gang, that would be the end of the Black Baron, and the guards would be out of a job anyway.  Regardless, it hints at a nasty streak: vindictive, villainous even.

What is not ambiguous however, is that Penelope was terrified of losing, and willing to go to extreme measures to avoid it. Very extreme measures, for all the Black Baron’s speechifying on fair play, he cheats like a weasel, calling in gunships and a spare plane when Sly gains the upper hand in the finals, and giving the following amazing piece of para-logic when Sly confronts him on having lost his aircraft: “Hah-ha! But we're both still airborne, aren't we? The victor has yet to be decided.” (To be fair, Sly had also ditched his plane by this point, but only after having shot down the Baron’s.) It’s possible that all this cheating was part of the challenge, a test of the Cooper gang’s mettle, However I think this is unlikely, Bentley’s commentary suggests that the dirigible gunships are a repeated pattern, the Baron sounds positively livid when they get shot down, and Penelope’s response when the Baron is finally vanquished “that's enough... you win, Cooper” sounds less like one acknowledging an anticipated defeat and more like someone backed into a corner throwing in the towel.

This hypocrisy and wrath is puzzling, troubling, and in sharp contrast to Penelope’s characterization elsewhere, both with and without the Baron mask. Is this a sign of extreme self-centeredness, fair play is for other people to follow? Or perhaps of a social darwinist mindset, it’s only cheating if one gets caught? Is it a sign of poor writing, Sucker Punch writing a villain on one hand and an ally on the other, without properly acknowledging that they were stated to be the same character?

I cannot definitely reject these possibilities, nowhere else in the game is Penelope’s character tested in quite the same way, but I can offer an alternative: Penelope felt trapped in the role of the Black Baron, and a pressure to perform as him, she was living a lie and had been for who-knows-how-much of her life, and had no idea what she would do without it, or what would happen to her if she were found out, say by a doctor pulling the Baron from the wreckage of his plane. This pressure, perhaps catalyzed by cynicism at the behavior of her fellow pilots, developed into paranoia, and she slowly resorted to these more and more extreme means of keeping up the deception, the thought of faking her death and retiring never crossing her mind until Sly forced the issue. Penelope’s hypocrisy then was fueled less by pride and ego, and more by fear.

This seems to be the interpretation that the canon leans towards, when finally discovered Penelope acknowledges “…I guess I’m kind of relieved”, and as Sly relates the story: “Penelope explained that the disguise was invented to get her past the dogfighting league's strict age requirements. However, after winning, the Baron became a celebrity, and she found herself putting on the costume more and more often. But now, with the Black Baron out of the picture, she was free to take up a new path, and she joined the gang without hesitation.” The Baron’s rise to fame seems to have been unexpected and self-perpetuating. Moreover, from a thematic point of view, Penelope’s abandonment of a role that had long controlled her life and become toxic for a more fulfilling future parallel’s Sly’s own decision to abandon thievery to join with Carmelita in the finale of the game.

This leaves only one major scene in Holland involving Penelope, when Bentley calls for her aid in defending the Gang’s airplane hangar from Black Baron guards that were paid off by Muggshot. She is happy to help the gang, and eager to mete retribution to those who betrayed the Baron. This would indicate a great deal of loyalty to the Black Baron… except that, given she secretly *is* the Black Baron, she’s actually angry that they betrayed *her*. Fair enough, nobody likes a Neyla, but it is another hint of a vindictive streak. She demands loyalty, we learn here… but does she give it in return? 

One final note before we fly to China: Penelope is filthy rich. She owns her own castle and surrounding lands, holds a dogfighting competition every year with presumably cash prizes (unless everyone there is just really gung-ho to prove their skills in deadly combat, like some kind of airborne samurai… which honestly I could buy too), she maintains a small armada of planes and dirigibles, with quite possibly tanks as well (unless Muggshot provided those to the mutinying guards), and if aSlyGoodbye’s kill count videos are any indication, has a staff of over a hundred-and-fifty guard-pilots, possibly far-far more. It’s unclear if she gave up all this in joining the Cooper Gang (an eccentric like the Baron leaving everything he had to his favored mechanic would likely not raise any eyebrows), but regardless, at no point in the game, as either Penelope or the Black Baron, does she express any interest in money.

In China, Penelope’s intellectual compatibility with Bentley is first demonstrated in her ability to predict and reconstruct Bentley’s plans with minimal prompting, a trait she demonstrates several more times throughout the game. However, in the affairs of the heart she only has eyes for Sly.  

It’s impossible to say exactly why she finds Sly attractive, she mentions his athleticism and his chivalry, and being rescued from a dragon does nothing to dissuade her feelings. The most straightforward interpretation is that in the wake of her disappointment meeting Bentley in person (they had both sent each other blatantly misleading photos, recall), she found the racoon smokin’ hot. Sly for his part is nonplussed by Penelope’s flirtations, the crushing is entirely one-sided.

The majority of Penelope’s interactions however are with neither Sly nor Bentley, but with Murray. She is the one who leads Murray, however unwittingly, to the lost team van floating in an iceberg, and is the one who drags it ashore for him, and who protects him as he drags it further the next leg of the journey towards the safe house. She has no history with the team van, no idea why Murray cares so much about it, to her it’s just a frozen hunk of metal, she even chastises him “this had better be worth it, Murray”, but she sticks by him until she is completely out of ideas for help. By this point, even Bentley is telling Murray to cut his losses and run. At no point does she tell him to abandon it, even when she’s telling him to run, she’s telling him they can come back for it later. When Murray finally does succeed in his mission, she cheers him on.

More telling though is her second job with Murray. When Murray, following her directions, is exposed to poisonous gas and placed into a deathtrap, she immediately rushes to save him. “This is all my fault! Hang in there, Murray. I'm coming!” Notably, she says this as she’s midway between the safe house and her destination. There is no one else around, she’s not on the binocucom, there is no audience for her to be performing to. Unless Penelope is literally lying at all times, there is every indication that, having let Murray down, she feels remorse and is determined to fix her mistake.

Sadly, they never have an opportunity to bond over their shared love of sending guards to the heavens. “Ha! Hope you can fly, 'cause it's a long way down!” “Taste deadly fence, miner guy! I wish I coulda seen 'em land!” They’d have a good time, I’m sure.

Moving onwards to Blood Bath Bay, the most important conversation, of course, is that between Bentley and Penelope outside of Skull Keep. She picks up on the turtle’s envy of Sly almost instantly and states bluntly “sounds like you're jealous”, to which the mastermind hesitantly agrees. Having detected this rift between the longtime friends, she does nothing to fan the flames of jealousy or pit the two against each other. Quite the opposite, she tries to talk Bentley through his problem, reminding him that he has his own strengths to be proud of.  When Bentley snarks that “Sly can't even *spell* ASCII”, she agrees, but in a way that minimizes the aggression, “yeah, he's not the most technical guy.” When she subsequently, makes an innocently insensitive remark about Bentley’s legs, she immediately catches herself and apologizes, even as unnecessary as Bentley said that was.

In this conversation, another interesting fact emerges. The whole conversation is started when Penelope expresses that with the bridges up there’s no means of getting into the keep, and Bentley corrects her “I've dealt with guys like this before, they can't really trust their own men, so they always keep an escape route handy... You just have to look around a little.” Presumably “guys like this” refers to villainous scoundrels who expect betrayal at all times because that’s what they would do themselves… exactly the sort of character Penelope stands accused of being. However, in this exchange Penelope professes ignorance of such machinations. And even if we cannot trust the defendant’s words, I say that we can trust the evidence: the Black Baron’s castle had no such emergency escape route, for if it did, Bentley would have found it and used it to access the inner sanctum, rather than send Sly to climb the castle and open the front doors for him.  However much the Black Baron berated his staff, he never expected them to mutiny against him. 

While these seem strong evidence, there are also several moments which might call the character of the defendant into question:   

First off, when seeking to retrieve the components of the downed reconnaissance satellite, Penelope warns Bentley “I rig all my gear to self-destruct if anyone tries to take it after a malfunction.” This suggests a streak of paranoia. And combined with the Black Baron’s fear of loss (and presumably also discovery), does make a trend. To this, all I can say is that neuroticism alone does not a supervillain make, and that a person can have flaws and still be overall sympathetic. As an example, look at Bentley. Seriously, at least she never feeds anyone to a giant crocodile.

Second, as they sneak into the Skull Keep, the duo come across a pack of pirates. “Time for a little swashbuckling”, she suggests. Penelope then proceeds to do absolutely nothing as she watches the fight unfold, despite being a formidable pugilist herself, as the boss fight against her as the Black Baron can attest. Perhaps she is sending Bentley to deal with the dangers while she sits comfortably back? Alternatively, she could be letting him build up his confidence, they had after all just had a big conversation downstairs where Bentley expressed dismay he could not be as physically capable as Sly… and here he is proving himself wrong. However, I think the most likely explanation is, unsatisfactorily, budgetary. I suspect Sucker Punch had neither the time nor inclination to animate and code up a full move-set for a character who would hardly use it, or set up the AI for a second Lemonade Brawl-style encounter.

Thirdly is much later, when Penelope is taken hostage by the pirate captain LeFwee, she cries “You can't just abandon me!” This demonstrates a shockingly low opinion for the Cooper crew, who of course return to rescue her shortly. Projection, perhaps? However, there are other explanations: While Penelope had already demonstrated her loyalty to the gang in aiding Murray retrieve the van, despite her own misgivings, she was now in the reciprocal position, and a much more fraught version of it at that, she had a cutlass to her throat and an ornery parrot smelling her hair. Sly had rescued her from the dragon, but now he was telling everyone to return to the ship (even if, as he said, it was only because the gang were out of options; an odd parallel to her own interactions with Murray over the van). Even if she had heard about Bentley’s heroism in Prague rescuing the original gang, she had never experienced it, nor would she have any particular reason to believe that such iron bonds would extend to a newcomer like herself. Bentley puts her at ease somewhat, assuring her that they *would* save her. “I... I trust you.” Her hesitation at believing the promise, in conjunction with her extreme reaction to the Muggshot turncoats, suggests the possibility that Penelope may have trust issues. Why this would be the case is completely unknown, and the possibility is never explored further, either to be confirmed or denied.

Lastly, when Penelope is finally rescued from the hold of LeFwee’s pirate ship, he expresses his dismay what she would choose “this cripple over me? The Smartest Man on the Seven Seas?” To which she replies: “Oh, I do like smart guys, and he beat you at your own game. You tell me who's more intelligent.” What would have happened if Lefwee had won? Would she have gone with LeFwee gladly as the proven more intelligent? While such plotting is always possible, we never see what happened in his hold, this seems unlikely: there is never any indication that Penelope expressed any affection for the pirate in the slightest, LeFwee makes no bones that he is keeping the mouse against her will and that she does not reciprocate his advances, so he will hold her in Skull Keep “until she agrees to love me, despite all my faults”. Even if we were to assume he was lying in this particular line (as indeed he was, at least about the location of his captive), he never suggests anything to the contrary, even after it has become clear she has made her choice and they are dueling to the death. Captain LeFwee, he who would never have to worry about getting a date so long ladies rode in sailboats and he had cannons to brandish at them, does not seem the type to keep a secret to the grave for the sake of the honor of a woman.  

An interesting detail: Penelope is audibly more shaken after her encounter with the blinding dust (“Bentley!? Thank you. I was really scared there for a bit. You saved my life.”) than she was either after being rescued from the clutches of a literal dragon (“My hero.”), or from a narcissistic and lecherous pirate (she makes a victory gesture to celebrate LeFwee’s demise, then flings herself into Bentley’s arms). Possibly she fears the loss of control more than the risk of death (though she plenty dislikes that, in the moment), or possibly she is an adrenaline junkie and the high wipes her fear once the danger is past. Or both. It is also possible she might be embarrassed, she got herself into the blinding-dust situation in the first place by being overconfident in her own abilities, whereas the other disasters that befell her were largely out of her control. Or perhaps it is none of these, and this is simply reading far too much into it all.

During the Kaine Island heist itself, Penelope’s most significant interaction is with Dimitri, rebuffing the lounge lizard’s advances and consoling him in his defeat. She also acts as mission control for Bentley during his confrontation with Dr. M, giving him advice, and warning him to hurry for Murray’s sake. None of the interactions suggest anything that hasn’t already been said previously. She never interacts directly with the mad doctor himself. 

So, we ask again: who is Penelope Muis? All the evidence is collected. What does it say?

From a straightforward reading of her dialogue, she is a loyal and dedicated team member, with a strong sense of responsibility, quick to berate herself when things go wrong, but slow to blame her allies, she acknowledges their efforts even when they fail. She tries to resolve interpersonal conflicts, and reminds people of their strengths when they are feeling down. When an ally is in trouble, she jumps to their aid without a second thought.

Her personality is significantly different as the Black Baron, however a close reading of the texts indicates that she maintains a strong work ethic, a love for challenge, and a mildly cocky belief in her own abilities in either persona, and that much of the Black Baron’s villainy can be attributed to stress and cynicism brought about by her situation, worrying about her reputation and having to deal with backstabbing pilots and possibly poor-quality employees.

She seems to enjoy taking on personas other than her own, and is more exuberant when she has a role to play.

She has affection for personal skill and craftsmanship, whatever form it takes and whosever’s it is.

She may have trust issues, although not to a debilitating degree.

She has a bloodthirst, though it seems to be for a love of the adrenaline rather than sadism.

She is not squeaky-clean: she is a criminal, she has a vindictive streak, and a tendency towards paranoia. However, she seems as honorable as anyone in the Cooper Gang: she has a sense of responsibility, a sense of proportion, and she tries to help others.

Therefore, this judge declares the verdict: Not Guilty!

""Hey babe, I need to get to a meeting tonight."" I yelled to Stacey while fishing for her keys in the kitchen. She was down the hall checking in on Noah, who had those creeping cruds in his chest and had been down for three days so far. 



""Do you think you could risk it tonight? I don't want to drag him out into the night air."" 



""Yeah, there's one about two miles away. I can do that."" I answered then walked back to where they were. I kissed her on the top of her head and gave Noah my pitiful look, then morphed it into a goofy look complete with my tongue hanging out. He chuckled a little. Probably more for my sake than anything else. 



What Stacey meant by "" risk it"" was that my license has been revoked for a DUI, but if the mission was dire then I would sometimes risk it. Going to court ordered AA meetings was a risk it if I had to. 



Besides, I was getting something from these meetings now. I even had a sponsor. They definitely couldn't have come at a better time and by this point I was freely admitting that I was an alcoholic and it kind of felt good to get it off my chest. 



I didn't know it at the time, but there was one more bender in me before I finally laid it down. 



The meeting was fun that night. A lot of laughs were had and I managed to learn a thing or two by accident. I donated to the coffee fund, shook some hands and made my way to the gravel lot of the small church. 



I started the car and made my way onto the road home and I noticed that the brakes felt a little squishy, they weren't really grabbing the car. I made a mental note to check the fluid when I got home. 



As I came closer to my left turn I put my foot on the brake pedal and it went straight to the floor this time. I was rolling along at fifty, and I was still doing fifty after I hit the brakes. 



I put my foot on the emergency brake and found they worked. I slowly applied them and pulled off to the side of the road to catch my breath and right my course. 



She had just had those brakes replaced. Boy, was I gonna raise hell to some mechanic as soon as possible. Had I not been on a straight road with no other cars in sight, that would have been a completely different outcome. 



I slowly made it home and told her what happened and her face lost all color. She ran to the kitchen junk drawer and retrieved a flashlight, then to the closet for a small tool kit we kept, then she dashed out the front door to the car. 



By the time I got up and went to find out what was going on, she had the hood up and the brake fluid tank open. She put two fingers in and inspected them under the flashlight beam. She looked at me and simply said, ""Oil."" 



""What are you talking about?"" I asked her. 



""There's oil in the brake fluid. Someone put oil in the brake fluid."" 



""You think it happened back at the shop where you got the brakes?"" 



""No. No way. The brakes wouldn't have lasted this long. Oil eats the seals and then air gets in the line. A matter of days, depending on how much you use the brakes and then, all of a sudden, no brakes."" She was staring at me with an expression of deep thought. 



She shook her head slightly and said, ""It's kind of a popular way to send a message where I come from. Losing brakes in those mountains can be a real day spoiler."" 



"" Who the fuck would have done that? ""



"" James. He's here. "" She pushed me out of the way as she hurried into the house. "" Goddam Scott, he could be watching us right now. ""



"" So your just going to run away? Run out on me?""



"" I've got to get me and Noah someplace safe. This isn't about you.""



"" If it's about you, then it's about me. I'm not running Stacey. He will have to go through me to get to you. We can take Noah to my grandparents house. He can't follow us there without being seen quick enough. I'm not scared of him. ""



"" That's because you don't know him. "" she looked at me, slowed herself down a bit, then explained, "" There's something you should know about James. He's a professional fighter, or rather was. Now he has a new career. He goes to a nearby cities and in no time he'll get some decent drug deal set up. Then he simply robs the people. Him and his partner David. ""



Inside I felt terror. Some kind of fucking mobster or something. Either way, I knew this dude was a whole new level of dangerous compared to me. 



"" I'm not going to just run and hide. If nothing else, if it comes down to it, I can at least be an obstacle so you and Noah can get a better head start. I'm not leaving or running out on you.""



"" You would really do that for me?"" She looked almost stunned.



"" Without question. I love you. That's what you do if you love someone. I'd never be able to look myself in the mirror if I did otherwise.""



"" Okay, "" she said, "" Let's drop Noah off at your grandparents and get a room to discuss what we should do."" 



I called Eddie and asked him if he would be up for a brake job right quick. I promised I would smoke him out and throw in forty bucks. He was there with fluid and everything we needed within an hour. His dad once was a mechanic in a NASCAR pit crew and his garages were better stocked than AutoZone.



I asked Stacey if I could let Eddie know what was going on. I let her know that he could be very helpful at a time like this. She agreed and so I did.



"" Man, you know that you are more of a brother to me than my own real flesh and blood brother. Right?"" I could tell this might turn into a lecture at any minute. "" As a brother then I am down with you. I got your back or I'll fucking die trying.""



"" Same here, I've never left you hanging for backup before. "" 



We changed the brakes out and Eddie told me he had a plan. The three of us were sitting outside still and I was rolling one.



"" You got any weapons? I know you can access a few."" He aimed that last bit at me. He knows I lived in the boondocks and finding a shootin' iron was as easy as walking across the street.



"" No. We don't have anything currently, but, you know. ""



"" I have a gun. "" Stacey said matter of factly. "" It's a thirty-two automatic.""



"" When were you going to tell me you had a gun in the house? ""



"" We can do Jerry Springer at a later time. I'm going back to my dad's and drop off these tools and grab a couple of things from one of his gun safes along with some ammo. I'll be back here in about thirty. ""



He jumped into his car and took off like a man on a mission. 



""Look, about that gun.."" Stacey started, but I just held my hand up and stopped her. 



""I'm sorry. I was being a bit of a dick. I don't blame you, if I was you I'd probably do the same thing. I got no right to judge you or be mad."" 



"" Thanks. I love you. ""



"" I love you, too. I'm not going anywhere. ""



Eddie showed back up with some fire power. Two AR-15s, two Glock nine millimeters, and his 30/06 deer hunting rifle. Eddie could shoot the wings off a fly with that sucker and has the ribbons and trophies to prove it. 



We divided up the weapons and ammo and threw some things in the car. Eddie spent the night on the couch and I stood watch until morning light. 



Then we all slammed some coffee while Noah ate a couple bowls of cereal. I called my grandma and asked if Noah could stay with them and spend the night as Stacey and I wanted to use our days off together to take a romantic car ride and get a room in the hills. 



They agreed and we drove over there. Eddie waited for about five minutes then he too headed that way, both of us sticking to the same route so that Eddie would be five minutes behind us in case James pulled out to follow us.



My grandparents had accepted and really seemed to like Noah a lot, and in return, Noah loved going over there to hang out. I had felt little pangs of jealousy at times over the way they fawned over him. 



When we left him there he
was happy and so were my grandparents. My grandad giving me a lewd grin the whole time we were there. We headed to the Travelers Inn about thirty minutes outside of town. Of course, Eddie was five minutes behind us the whole way. 



Once we were all safely checked in and I had my little arsenal safely inside the room, Eddie pulled up, rolled down his window and told us that he had to take his wife to her mom and dads and would be checking in on us every thirty minutes or so. He would drive by but wouldn't stop or show himself unless he has to. The rest of it was on us, but Eddie was quick to note he was a phone call away.



Stacey and I ordered up some pizza for dinner that night. She sat at the table next to the front window looking out of a small crack in the curtain. 



""I'll never be free as long as that bastard is alive."" She said to herself it seemed. I felt so bad about what she was going through, it enraged me to think this guy was willing to hurt his own son just because he couldn't take no for an answer. It bothered me deep down inside, giving me a whole new perspective on domestic violence.



""Have you ever taken out an order of protection against him?"" 



""Yeah. One time when I was naive enough to think it would do any good. At the end of the day, it's just a piece of paper and won't stop a grown man from doing what he wants to do."" 



""I guess not. Did he break it? Did you report it?"" 



Yeah, but half the cops in our hometown are his buddies and even help him rip off dope dealers at times.""



"" What about your dad? I mean, he shoots at his wife over some soup, but let's this guy hurt his daughter? Fuck, what kind of dad is that?"" I knew right then that I wouldn't get along with her dad. No matter what.



"" He's scared of him. Plus, James always has enough drugs to share when he comes around."" She never once looked away from the crack in the curtain. Then she added, ""Mom though. One time he gave me a black eye, right after we first got married. I'll never forget it. That was back when he would still do the whole apology thing."" 



""I had run to mom and dads because, well, mom and dad. Right? Well, here he came pulling into the driveway and you could see he had a whole bunch of balloons in the passenger seat. 



""All of a sudden I heard the crack of a rifle coming from the old barn about fifty feet from the house. Bullet holes started appearing on James windshield, then it just disintegrated. 



""I heard two more cracks and there went the balloons. The only time I ever saw that bastard scared. He turned around and got the fuck out of dodge."" 



"" I don't blame him. Your mom's a nut.""



"" I'm going to take a shower. I was up all night and it's starting to catch up to me."" I made my way to the back of the room. Looking back as I walked into the bathroom I saw her sitting in the glow of the television and staring intently out of the window. Broke my heart.



The shower felt so good and relaxing that I almost fell asleep standing up. The next thing I knew I had been in there so long that the hot water was running out.



So I cut the water off and got out to dry myself off. I put on the same pants with a new clean shirt. I decided it would be best to stay dressed in case anything happened.



""Did you want to get a shower tonight? The hot water will need to build up first. Sorry."" 



I got no reply and figured Stacey had probably fell asleep. She didn't sleep to well the night before. Pulling on my shirt I walked into the main room and saw she had moved from the window.



""Babe?"" She wasn't in the room and figured she had gone to get something to drink and some ice. I looked around and saw the ice bucket sitting where it was.



What was missing was all of Stacey's stuff. I dashed to the door and swung it open to check the parking lot. Sure enough, the car was gone.



I looked back through the room for some kind of clue, that's when I saw a piece of hotel stationary. I picked it up and read; Noah needs me. Call your grandma. Had to go. No matter what happens, just know I love you.



A sudden, almost tangible wave of aloneness washed over me.

1hwe8j9,https://www.reddit.com/r/fiaustralia/comments/1hwe8j9/are_passive_marketcap_weighted_etfs_an_example_of/,Are passive market-cap weighted ETFs an example of Nash equilibrium strategy? ,"Nash equilibrium is a concept in game theory where players in a game make the best decisions they can, considering what others are doing, and no one can improve their outcome by changing their strategy alone. It's like everyone sticking to their plan because changing it wouldn't make things better for them, assuming everyone else sticks to theirs.

For example, imagine two competing coffee shops on the same street deciding where to set their prices. If both choose prices where neither shop can gain more customers or profit by adjusting their price alone, they’re in a Nash equilibrium. Here is a video showcasing this: [Simulating Supply and Demand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNtKXWNKGN8&ab_channel=Primer)

An example in the stock market: if an investor buys an undervalued stock and its price rises to reflect its true value, the market reaches equilibrium. At this point, buyers have no incentive to pay more, and sellers see no benefit in lowering their price, as the stock is now fairly valued. This balance persists until new information or external factors disrupt the market dynamics.

In the stock market, participants (buyers, sellers, and investors) interact strategically, considering the actions of others to optimise their outcomes. In ETFs, arbitrageurs align ETF prices with their underlying assets by exploiting price discrepancies, stabilising the market at an equilibrium. Additionally, investors choosing ETFs or stocks for optimal portfolio allocation reach a balance where no one benefits from altering their strategy as we assume that we have an 'efficient market', explained in [Ben Felix - Is The Market Efficient?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbPVTqd468c&ab_channel=BenFelix)

The 'efficient market hypothesis' is a hypothesis that states that share prices reflect all available information and consistent alpha generation is impossible. 'Alpha' is a term used in investing to describe an investment strategy's ability to beat the market, or its “edge.” Many state that the market behaves this way and approaches an 'efficient market' behaviour or function such that 'alpha' approaches an asymptote of zero.

Yes, there are theories on exploiting factors (other than market beta, a measure of a security's sensitivity to movements in the overall market) by tilting weighting and this is supported by backtesting of the data. However, these premiums necessarily come with more risk and are not a 'free lunch' by increasing risk-adjusted returns with no consequence. Additionally, there is potential risk of crowding, if this is the predominant strategy that is used, the more who use this strategy, the less 'factor premium' there is as factors like 'value' stocks become priced in, although ['factor investing'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViTnIebSzj4&ab_channel=BenFelix) remains theoretically sound.

The caveats I have identified so far are:  
\- Participants may not have full or accurate information, violating one of Nash equilibrium's assumptions. In some cases it is an environment of 'information asymmetry' or 'imperfect information' much like Poker and in the [Prisoner's dilemma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9Lo2fgxWHw&ab_channel=ThisPlace), however for most investors and for fund managers, they have access to the same information.

\- Participants differ in risk preferences, time horizons, and available resources, complicating the establishment of equilibrium (which necessitates heterogeneity).

\- Market dynamics often are influenced by changing economic conditions, policy decisions, and external shocks, which can disrupt equilibrium states.

In stock trading, buyers and sellers anticipate each other’s decisions, leading to equilibrium prices where supply equals demand. If the 'efficient market hypothesis' is valid for the stock market, does this not imply that a market-cap-weighted portfolio represents a Nash equilibrium strategy by definition?",3,1736320694.0,fiaustralia,2,1.0,False

New Dodger Hyeseong Kim did an interview with his KBO team, Kiwoom Heroes where they congratulate him on his contract with the Dodgers. Wanted to give some details on our newest Dodger! This is a long one and I include some fun facts from his time in the KBO as well.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V85pjTVdNKI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V85pjTVdNKI)

From the video:

* He said he couldn't sleep the day he signed the contract and he's never gotten so many calls/congrats in his life after it was confirmed that he signed with the Dodgers
* A lot of Kiwoom Heroes were super happy for him and he wants to do well to make them proud as well
* His agent set up a workout and that's where he met Shohei. This was before his posting. He told Shohei he was being posted in 2 days and Shohei told him good luck. Interviewer jokes that it was their fate/destiny to become teammates.
* Says there were many reasons why he chose the Dodgers but the biggest reason is ""because they're the Dodgers""
   * He was familiar with the team because he watched Chan Ho Park and Hyun-jin Ryu play (see fun facts below)
   * The Dodgers are also reigning champions
* The Kiwoom Heroes team gift him a stamp as a congratulatory present for his new contract and team.
   * In Korean culture, it's common that important contracts are signed with a stamp with the signee's name
   * Hyeseong's was customized with two engravings on the side
      * 별처럼 빛나길 - transl. *Shine bright like a star*. This is apt because his name Hyeseong also means Comet in Korean
      * 지혜롭게 이루리라 - roughly transl. *Achieve things with wisdom*. Again related to his name--for some context, a lot of Korean characters have an additional meaning (Hanja). For Hyeseong, the Hye means Wisdom, and the Seong means To Achieve
* At the end, he thanks the Kiwoom fans for supporting him during his time in the KBO and he says he'll continue to work hard and do his best in America.
* The video ends with his walkup song which is <혜성/Comet> by Younha

Fun Facts:

* He went to the same high school as Hyun-jin Ryu and Ji-man Choi. Dongsan High School in Incheon, Korea
* He also was part of Chan Ho Park's first baseball camp in Korea
* Well known for being really friendly and personable with Kiwoom fans
* He's really good friends with Jung Hoo Lee and he looks up to Ha-seong Kim a lot. They all used to be on the Kiwoom Heroes together.
* Works on his body a lot. Stopped eating carbs for a while, back to eating them though. Doesn't drink alcohol, soda, coffee etc. Said Ha-seong Kim told him to bulk up to prep for MLB so said he's been working on that.
* For as great as his work ethic is, he also does tend to disappear in big moments, postseason, etc.
* Due to injuries and slumps, etc. Hyeseong has played just about every field position (superutility) for Kiwoom. He earned the nickname Hye-vee (based on Eevee from Pokemon) from fans.

Our youngest daughter had moved out during the summer to start college in Arizona.

My wife continued, “Hillian spends about $200 per month on boba. I see her bank transactions.”

Thinking about this hurt my stomach so I placed the book on the coffee table.

“When she was small, you bought her a gift card to Starbucks for $200 for her birthday,” she said.

I didn’t remember, but it was probably true.

“So you spoiled her,” she said. After 20 years of marriage, I could see the invisible connection to the boba. I imagined the Starbucks gift card spinning through the air and landing in my forehead like a ninja star.

I sent this message to the family group chat: “@Hillian, you will get $200 less each month for groceries. Call me for details.”

My wife gave it a thumbs-up reaction. My other daughter gave it a laugh reaction. Hillian did nothing as I expected.

I went to my Chase app and set up a recurring Zelle payment to Hillian for $250 per month.

(Shit keeps getting worse and worse as I'm in the process of writing this post, holy shit, it's just deteriorating by the minute.)

Idk how many people are aware of what's going on in Los Angeles right now, but there's a bad fire. It's been a very dry winter so far, and the Santa Ana winds have been insane today. I work in Santa Monica, I started at 7:30 this morning. In winter, it happens sometimes that I'll leave my home in Palms, and it'll be cold there, but when I arrive at work only 15 minutes later (closer to the ocean), it's *very* windy and *very* warm when I get out of my car. Obviously, that's a big contributor to wildfire danger, but... I didn't exactly think that today would be ""the day"".

My coworker came in at around 10:30, and mentioned something about a fire. I went outside around 11:30, and I could see the smoke rising nearby. By the time I was off work at 12:30, that cloud of smoke had more than doubled in size. I could tell that it was about to be really serious, but I wasn't really prepared for how serious it's gotten.

(Another coworker texted our group chat in the middle of me writing this. The area our store is in has recieved an evacuation warning, and our district manager has said that we're closed until further notice.)

They're calling it the ""Palisades Fire"". I used to live there. I lived there for 7 years. The neighborhood I lived in is completely ablaze, the house I lived in must be gone, I'm currently witnessing it on live TV. The news reporter is standing literally right there, in this horrible fiery hellscape that looks so unsettlingly familiar. And the places I would go grocery shopping, the places I would get breakfast, coffee, ice cream, restaurants I'd eat at, the pharmacy, the barber, the vet I would take my dogs to, the high school my mom went to, the restaurant she worked at, the home of one of her best friends, every place that's been significant to the very beginning of my relationship with my life partner -- I've been watching ALL of it get completely destroyed.

It's so weird. It's so fucking weird.

I'm so glad I moved out of there several years ago. I'm so glad my mom moved out not too long after.

But. Fuck.

I loved that shitty little mobile home on the beach. I was so mad that my mom decided to move. I guess it's a good thing now.

So many bad, difficult things happened there. My brother died there. I experienced the sudden loss of a very beloved pet there. My mental health was really fucking terrible for a very large portion of my living there. I went through an amazing amount of trauma there, and an amazing amount of otherwise life-changing experiences.

But the place itself... I loved it. I loved it so much. It was why I was so mad my mom gave it up. We were across the street from the beach, I was so connected with the nature there. I could see the ocean from my deck, I could feel my bed shake at 2:00 AM each time a booming wave crashed over the shore. I watched the sun set over the water so many times.

It's SO fucking crazy, my partner and I were there just 4 days ago. I hadn't been in the Palisades in a long time. Like 2 years. We had a little date at a restaurant we used to go to, we drove by my old home to pay it a visit. It was completely spontaneous, unplanned. It's clear now that the universe was allowing us one final goodbye.

I don't know what's gonna happen. I don't know how far it's gonna go. It's moving fast. New fires are starting in different parts of LA. It's only just reached 10 PM, and they're saying that the winds are expected to be at the worst from 10 PM to 5 AM.

A bit context, kakak gua (33F) baru aja divorced, masih mentally struggle karena dari awal berantem sampai proses itu sakit hati banget. On the bright side, dia kemungkinan besar bakal dipindah ke Jepang sama kantornya, Tokyo to be exact, tahun depan. Tapi karena dia masih struggling, dia maunya ada keluarga yang nemenin. Kebetulan, tinggal di Jepang emang udah keinginan dia dari dulu. Singkat cerita, gua yang bisa nemenin dia dan gua juga suka di Jepang.

Di sisi lain, gua (28M) udah 4 tahun jalanin bisnis keluarga. Udah 1 tahun buka coffee shop sendiri juga. Kerjaan palugada, dari marketing, taxation, invoicing, finance, budgeting, dll semua gua yang jalanin, jadi gua gak ada spesialisasi di satu bidang. Tbh, bisnis keluarga ini bukan passion, dan udah mulai pusing juga karena semua nya gua yang jalanin. Jadinya gua masih kehambat untuk gedein coffee shop gua karena most of my time buat beresin bisnis keluarga ini. Recently udah mulai kepikiran untuk pindah kerja, tp gabisa full time di coffee shop karena coffee shop gua masih terlalu kecil untuk jadi my only source of income. Karena gua gaada spesialisasi, jd kemungkinan gua bakal ulang karir gua lg dari awal. Modal gua cuma english CEFR level C1, gelar sarjana ilmu administrasi, dan magister manajemen.

Terus cewe gua (29F) udah 5 tahun jadi branch manager bagian sales. Dan dia juga udah mulai takut karena kantornya dia makin kesini internalnya makin kacau, dan sebenernya dia juga gak passion di sales.

Kita berdua pun juga mikir ya kalo misalnya kita mau ""reset"" career, kita nggak mau ulang lagi di Jakarta. Jadi kayak pengen ""reset"" kehidupan sekalian, ngulang hidup dari awal lagi di negara lain as a couple (kita bakal nikah tahun ini).

Akhirnya gua coba kasih tau ke cewe gua perihal kakak gua. Dan diluar dugaan ternyata dia excited kalo negaranya Jepang.

Setelah kita coba itung2, kalo kita berdua dapet entry-level job disana, dikurangin dengan tax, rent, utilities, dll, duitnya agak ngepas untuk tinggal berdua di Tokyo. Yang penting nggak kesusahan lah, tapi ngepas. Mungkin bisa nabung ¥10k - ¥20k per bulan. Tapi dengan catatan kita berdua kerja dan kerjaannya entry-level.

Kita sadar ini gambling banget, tapi kita juga nggak mau hidup gini2 aja. Di satu sisi, ini bisa jadi alasan gua juga untuk keluar dari bisnis keluarga ini karena kalo misal gua pindah kerja ke perusahaan lain di Jakarta juga, gua cukup yakin bokap nyokap gua bakal kecewa karena mereka berharap gua bisa nerusin bisnis ini. Tapi di satu sisi, I've had enough. Tapi, kalo gua pindah ke LN gua cukup yakin bokap nyokap gua bakal lebih legowo.

Dari sisi lain, cewe gua pengen jauh dari keluarganya. Soalnya bokap nyokapnya itu kayak nggak bisa ngelepas anak2nya. Semua anaknya dibeliin rumah sekomplek sama dia biar bisa bareng. Dan ternyata cewe gua nggak mau itu terjadi ke dia karena dia pengen hidup mandiri dan keluar dari ""bubble"" keluarganya.

Di umur kita yang udah 28 dan 29 tahun ini, make sense gak sih kalo gambling kaya gini?

I [28M] completed graduate school early last year. I dated a classmate of mine from my senior year of undergrad, but by the second year of my graduate program the relationship was over. Throughout my entire grad program, my classmates were either wildly older than me, way younger than me, married, or any combination of these. Since I have already graduated, the few classmates I did speak with have already drifted away and continued with their own lives.

I dated a coworker throughout the latter half of my graduate program. Close to two years together came to an end after I found out they cheated with one of their coworkers. My current job is entirely males and one married woman.

I have tried all of the major dating apps. Tinder, Bumble, Hinge—none of them did anything besides hurt me and disillusion me further. 

I have even done both long distance and local online dating with girls I met via Twitter. Spent three and a half years with one of them (long distance), spent six months with another (long distance), spent six months with the last one (locally). After years of being a regular user, I don’t even use Twitter/X anymore.

I have plenty of “third places” I spend time at. I go to the gym regularly, I have favorite coffee spots all over town, I frequent venues with live music as often as I can. At all of these places, I am recognized as a regular and I know many of the other regulars. There are seemingly no singles or people who look like they want to be approached at these places. I very rarely go to clubs as I have a physically demanding job and typically wake up before the sun is even up, so the type of person I would meet who frequents clubs would more than likely not the have the same values as I do.  

I have absolutely no problem socializing or talking to people. In fact, I am constantly approached by others with small talk and I always participate. I am commonly complimented on my appearance or clothing, my music taste, etc. This is almost always males (and no, they are not hitting on me), and if it is not a male it is also very obvious that they are being polite and not asking for an advance. Actually, a good 50% of all the relationships I have had began due to the other person approaching me at school, at work, online, and then hitting it off with them. 

However, I have reached a point in my life where a lot of the ways I met people in the past are no longer accessible to me or do not seem like they are worth my time. I finished graduate school and started my career not long after. I had a relationship throughout all of grad school so I didn’t mingle, and the people I did mingle with were never intended to be someone I would date. My current job does not have singles and I plan to be here for a good while. And quite frankly, I don’t think it’s appropriate to date people at these full-time locations the same way it was acceptable to date at my part-time minimum wage gigs I simply used as a means to get me through graduate school. I have become so disillusioned with meeting people through social media due to constantly being roped in my people who mislead me with the false front social media allows. My third places do not seem like they’re teeming with singles, and I also do not want to become known as “that guy who hits on everyone here” because I know plenty of those regulars at my favorite spots.

I wouldn’t say I’ve become hopeless, but I just feel so lost and confused about what I could possibly be doing wrong. My parents got married at my age and had me 2 years later—I would be surprised if I even have a girlfriend when I reach the age they had me at [27M, 30F]. I have not actively searched for a relationship or person to date basically since my last long term relationship ended with infidelity, but I have fallen into a few “situationships” here and there that seemingly just fall into my lap. They have all ended with me basically investing substantially more into the relationship than they did.

I don’t think I’m forcing anything or trying too hard, but maybe there’s something I’m missing? Am I being too quiet? Should I approach people even if they look like they don’t want to be approached? Should I disregard my fear of becoming “the guy who hits on everyone” and just try to talk to more people at my favorite spots? Are there places or events I haven’t considered yet but should?

I feel like I’m at a complete loss. The older I get, the more disheartening it feels to not have someone permanent who I love to share special moments with. I have friends and family, yes, but it is not the same as sharing those moments with someone who loves you romantically. It especially hurts knowing my parents had it all figured out by the time they were my age, and here I am wondering what I’m doing wrong or what I can possibly do to meet someone.",3,1736317612.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1hwdct1,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1hwdct1/quitting_caffeine_made_me_smarter/,"Quitting Caffeine made me ""Smarter""","For a long time I avoided quitting caffeine, thinking that I would ""need"" it to do intellectually demanding work at home. Like I felt like my mind was scintillating with connections, ideas and enthusiasm, but much of the time it was aimless, like fireworks going off. At the same time, I had begun to identify myself with this state and I was scared of stopping. Like if I quit, it would be Dullsville for me.

However, I realized I was always going through a cycle of only having a few hours of hyperactive productivity in the beginning of the day after drinking giant cups of tea, crashing as soon as the effect wore off. From early afternoon onwards, I felt like I was just waiting for the next day, pushing whatever tasks I had ""until the next morning"". Of course, I would never have 'time' to do even half of what I intended because I had only a few hours with the energy for more demanding tasks.

I was going to draft a serious application for a PhD program and I realized I could never get anywhere if I can just use a small part of my day for the most productive work. So I quit cold turkey, I tossed the rest of my tea in the garbage bin saying 'good riddance'.

And after two weeks of incredible sluggishness, I gradually began feeling better. Instead of sleeping and waking whenever, I began getting up at the same time and using the medical bright light for an hour during the same time window in the morning, and this made me more alert and in sync than ever before. I quit melatonin and my sleep cycle finally makes sense.

And my intellectual capacities have not diminished in the least. Now I am alert enough to do deep work from morning until late evening with only a very slight dip in focus in the afternoon. Quitting caffeine has improved my patience with reading the works of others and editing my words significantly. It's like the fireworks of scattered ideas have turned into something with purpose other than my own entertainment.

Caffeine was really my keystone habit, because after setting my sleep times, it was easier to then decide mealtimes and work cutoff periods. And suddenly, my daily cycle was in control. I have never been happier or felt more capable of reaching my goals.

The idea that smart and hardworking people must be addicted to caffeine is a myth. Maybe it's the kind of thing to joke about and bond over during coffee breaks, making sure no one stands apart. As if caffeine was a magic brew that gives people their smarts as otherwise they'd be just walking zombies.

Maybe for some people caffeine works, but not for me. Also, speeding up your thoughts is not the same as productivity. I was spinning my wheels. Now one and half months after quitting, I feel I have some traction, finally.",22,1736317295.0,decaf,7,0.97,False

1hwdcmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/raypeat/comments/1hwdcmk/saturated_fats_cause_larger_breasts/,saturated fats cause larger breasts? ,"I’m 24F and have been eating lots of saturated animal fats ever since I was 11 (predominately eating grassfed beef (organs + bone broth too), pastured pork, tallow, fish, raw milk, eggs, cheese, coconut oil, coffee, fruits (berries, oranges, apples), some root vegetables and rice throughout the years but not very consistent). Not completely peaty of course, but i didn’t grow up eating the standard high PUFA diet. Does anyone know if there is any correlation between high animal saturated fat intake and large breasts? 

I’m curious because parents and my grandparents don’t really have the genes for very large breasts. For reference I’m a 32J cup and not overweight. my sister (29F) who has eaten way too much seed oil/low fat standard American diet/not enough animal fats throughout the years hasn’t been above a DD cup.

1hwdb15,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1hwdb15/i_read_my_mothers_diary/,I read my mothers diary ,"About a year ago I was going through some cabinets late at night looking for some tape for a project when I stumbled upon a pack of notebooks. I thought I would take some cause I use notebooks up like crazy. I flipped through the pages to see if there was any writing and I stopped at one that the top page had a date and I could tell from the poor grammar and neat handwriting it was my mothers writing. She immigrated here from Mexico after she couldn’t afford her university tuition and was studying comped science some time in the 80s. 

The diary started off with how said she was that she just wished my dad loved her and how she found out that he cheated on her and how it affected their marriage and her self esteem. I cried so hard once I got in my room. 

Over the next few weeks I made it my mission to be the best daughter I could be. Took off Sundays and took her shopping and for regular coffee and it became out routine. I always told her how pretty she looked and how she was a great mom and I left her notes in her lunch. 

After a few months I read the diary again and saw that new entries stated how she was so grateful to have such amazing kids and how happy she was. 

I can see since a year ago she is a lot more happy and confident. 

I know it’s bad and I never meant to invade her privacy and I haven’t read it since then but that is my confession. I’m just happy that she’s happy. I hope she doesn’t find out but if she did I don’t think she would mind because they are topics we discuss nowadays anyways. ",28,1736317108.0,confessions,1,1.0,False

And as time goes on, it becomes clear that my family sees me as the failure. They won't say it, but whenever we have family and friends over, such as during Christmas week, they love talking about him since he is successful.

My brother got a full scholarship, did a computer science degree and had an internship and Microsoft, then another one at Facebook, and now has been working at Facebook since he graduated. Making over 300k a year

Then there is me... took debt for college since we aren't wealthy and financial aid didn't cover everything. Did an English degree and didn't think about why I was doing an English degree. I just enjoyed reading, without considering my job prospects. I landed a recruiting job that I got laid off from after a year, and have been working at a local coffee shop ever since.

I feel like the family failure. I have no achievements to talk about, and it hurts every time I hear them brag to family and friends about my brother.",1,1736317037.0,self,2,1.0,False
