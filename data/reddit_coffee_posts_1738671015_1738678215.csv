I recently got into this subreddit as I got a quite bad yeast infection around a month ago. My context is the following: 

I am 26, male. I tend to have a good health, exercise and eat properly but I also have a dark side that smokes, drinks a lot of coffee and loves sugar. 

I had a yeast infection around a year ago after unprotected sex with a partner. It went bad and I was pretty scared that it could be some other ITS. I got tested, and it was all good, but she did mention that she had a candida infection, which makes sense.  After around 3 months, the candida stopped generating problems but a month ago it came back in the form of another yeast infection which I recognized immediately. I moved to the UK in that period and I actually thought the tap water could be doing me wrong since i 

Overall symptoms: 

**Thrush infection.** Not only in the genital area but also in the armpits. Redish areas that itch. (I have been applying **clotrimazole** for the past 3 weeks but i am afraid that if i stop it will just backlash. 

**Stomach ache and gasses practically all the time.** (I thought the water or something in the food was making me feel sick but I think it could be this. It also makes sense that tap water makes me sick since it has added stuff to clean it out and that could be messing with the fungus).

**Sugar craves.** I stopped completely eating sugar but for a bit I was just craving it all the time. A lot of chocolate. It would also make my stomach hurt. 

**Mucus**. I have a constant mucus on my throat which i just have to get out all the time. My roomate now also got some since I moved in and i am afraid i may be the cause. It is the exact same *cough*. 

What should I do, where should i start? I am now commited to solve this specially because I don't want to affect others.

My friend is sooo pretty. Like, conventionally attractive talaga si ante ko. And because of this, she has several admirers talaga.

'Etong mga admirers niya, super generous talaga when it comes to her. Like, bigay gifts sa kaniya randomly‚Äîmakeup, fragrance, coffee, flowers, etc.

However, 'etong si ante ko ay may long-time LIP na, more than 7 years na 'ata sila, if I am not mistaken. Mayroon na rin silang anak.

Kapag may natatanggap siyang gifts, tinatanong naming mag-t-tropa if ano sinasabi ng LIP niya kapag may nagbibigay sa kaniya. Out of curiosity lang. She responded na (verbatim) ""okay lang sa kaniya; at least, hindi raw naman nila ako napakikinabangan."" Okay, that's good to hear naman.

Kaso recently, napag-awayan na nila 'etong matter na ito. Medj nainis na 'ata LIP niya sa pagtanggap niya ng gifts. Kasi 'yung last gift na natanggap niya, teddy bear na may hawak na note na ""mamahalin kita nang 10,000 na taon"" in Japanese. üò≠

Mayroon pang one time na siya mismo pumunta sa building nu'ng guy para lang kunin 'yung regalo niya.

Ngayon, hindi ko alam if ano stand ko about this one. Part of me says na okay lang naman talaga 'yun, as long as hindi nga naman siya napakikinabangan.
However, may thought din ako na parang hindi nga 'ata maganda tingnan if tatanggap pa ng gifts from supposed ""suitors"" or ""admirers"", lalo na't may serious commitment na.

I recently reached out to postal workers to gather information about struggles they're facing. I was asked to do so by a local org; however, I am also posting a summary of what I gathered here. In interacting with our postal workers, I learned about a world I never knew existed, and challenges I never knew they faced. Today, I'm going to provide a summarized version of my presentation. Here is how you can help them. I think supporting our 2 million government workers is a great ""first shot"" as it were, and 600,000 of them work for USPS.

**Call, email, and write your representatives in Congress and the senate.**

Tell them to support House Resolution 70. [Here's what it is.](https://www.congress.gov/119/bills/hres70/BILLS-119hres70ih.pdf)

This prevents privatization of USPS and protects it as an independent agency. PLEASE actually do this.

Let them know that you support the mission of the USPS.

Did you know they've been working for almost 2 years without a contract reached, because they can't legally strike? Tell your reps that, as well. 

**Mail things, Buy stamps.**

This one is easy. MAIL THINGS. Buy stamps. Our postal service is self-funding. Mail things and buy stamps. Visit your post office. When given shipping options, pick USPS. Send postcards to young family members, send letters to your government officials, your friends overseas, send mail to ANYONE. Don't mail anything that's leaking, or anything ominous. 

**Maintain good housekeeping.**

This was brought up time and time again. People, get your mail. Make sure your mailbox and home are clearly marked and accessible. Get a great big one, even better. Make sure you salt and shovel your walkways in winter, because your carrier is coming regardless of conditions. Your mail carrier is a bad-ass who will deliver on the promise that they'll be delivering your mail, no matter the weather. Think of them, because they work long hours walking around outside. Make sure your mailbox is easy to pull up to, if you're rural. Make sure your apartment mail is clearly marked with the apartment number, letter, etc. These little things will make their job so much easier. When setting up Christmas and seasonal decorations or pathway lights, please don't pick things that have to be stepped over at knee height and are connected to each other

  
**Get to know your carrier. Treat them like a human being.**

Build a relationship with your mail carrier, if you're around to see them. Let them know you've got their back. Leave them a snack and a cold drink if it's hot, offer them a cup of coffee, or other hot drink if you know when they'll be around and it's cold. Their job is often thankless, undermanned and underpaid. Let 'em know they matter and you're looking out for them.

**Spread this information.**

This one's for both me and them. Spread this information anywhere you think you'll be able to get people to take action. If you're a union worker, share it with your union. If you love social media, please share this wherever you can. Oh, and remember, the media lies.",2,1738677467.0,IronFrontUSA,0,1.0,False

With yoga, Working out therapy and a lose dose of busprione (anti anxiety med, not a SSRI) my anxiety has definitely gotten better but still present. 

I tested positive in a hospital lab with the lactulose solution. Hydrogen. But then I tested negative with at home test, glucose solution. My symptoms have improved but still having anxiety over the sibo results. They gave me xifaxan but I am currently sitting on them because of the horror stories..

I don‚Äôt have any weird food intolerances. I cut back on drinking alcohol. Wasn‚Äôt a heavy drinker to begin with. Cut back on smoking an ecig. Cut back on all energy drinks and started drinking decaffeinated coffee. One cup a day. I just get a little crampy on my left side above my hip. Not everyday. I do get midday fatigue but I have always had that. I just chalked it up as stress related. I also get these weird gassy movements that seem to be towards my anus. Hard to describe. 

I never bloat, no nausea after eating. I eat a pretty clean diet as well. My stools are probably a 4 or 5. with one BM in the morning. (Might have 2 BM in one day) but my BM never really changed schedule either.. I will have some diarrhea occasionally but don‚Äôt last days and days. 

Clean colonoscopy 
Clean abdominal ultrasound.
Clean bloodwork (low on vitamin d. Which is normal in my area) 
Clean CT scan. 

Only abnormal finding was positive for hydrogen sibo.. iv read how these tests aren‚Äôt very good and a lot of doctors go off symptoms. Should I take the xifaxan? Or maybe take megasporebiotic that was recommended by my dietitian/ nutritionist?  I am just trying to get some advice because I know many people who have worse symptoms would trade shoes with me. I don‚Äôt wanna take something that could cause more harm than good.

I woke up from a nightmare, I looked at the time, and decided to FaceTime him since it was his lunch break.

He answered the call, but oddly enough, he kept the call on mute. I saw a woman going out the door first, he hurriedly followed her in laughter, he went back the room to grab his phone (on call with me). I thought nothing of it since I thought he was grabbing coffee with his friend, Nick.

Though throughout his break, he didn‚Äôt talk to me and I didn‚Äôt see who he was with but I had a feeling he was with the woman who went out the door first. I didn‚Äôt want to jump into conclusions or formulate any assumptions.

When he got home, I asked him about lunch. He told me nothing special happened, whatsoever. I asked him about Nick, then he acted somewhat defensive? Telling me Nick wasn‚Äôt in the mood for coffee so he went alone, then I told him I saw him following someone out the door, he changed his narrative, saying he was with someone and explained to me that he didn‚Äôt bother telling me because that person is already married and have kids.

I told him I would have understood if he told me in advanced and I wouldn‚Äôt mind but I felt upset, a bit shocked and explained to him that what if our positions were reversed.

He then started getting stressed out and avoided the topic. I helped him calm down then brought it up later on. He got angry at me saying he wouldn‚Äôt want me to go out with a married man even if that imaginary guy had kids and all, so I told him that‚Äôs how I felt, but when I brought up the incident again (his lunch break) he lashed out at me, telling me to get over myself.

TL;DR - My bf (M26) grabbed coffee with his colleague and didn‚Äôt tell me because she is a ‚Äúmarried woman who has kids‚Äù, but got angry at me for telling him what if I went out with a married man with kids.

1ihi0qp,https://www.reddit.com/r/chuckklostermAIn/comments/1ihi0qp/the_semiotics_of_wordle_and_the_paradox_of/,The Semiotics of Wordle and the Paradox of Digital Kinship,"In 2024, the most meaningful sentence you can write to another human is not¬†*I love you*¬†or¬†*I‚Äôm sorry*¬†or¬†*Let‚Äôs start a podcast*. It‚Äôs a sequence of yellow and green squares, sent without context, like a cryptic haiku composed by an algorithm. ‚ÄúWordle 1,072 3/6. üü®‚¨õüü©‚¨õüü©. üü©üü©üü©üü©üü©.‚Äù This is how we say,¬†*I‚Äôm here, I‚Äôm thinking, I‚Äôm alive*. And sometimes, it‚Äôs how we realize someone else is not.

Take Denyse Holt, the 80-year-old retiree whose devotion to Wordle inadvertently turned her into a protagonist in a story that feels equal parts Coen Brothers thriller and¬†*Golden Girls*¬†episode. Holt, a woman who presumably spent decades worrying about things like¬†*leaving the oven on*¬†or¬†*forgetting to water the ficus*, found herself in a scenario no one plans for: trapped in her basement by a naked intruder wielding a knife. The man‚Äîexperiencing a mental health crisis, police later said‚Äîhad disconnected her landline, locked her away, and turned her Illinois home into a surrealist diorama of dread. But Holt‚Äôs survival wasn‚Äôt solely due to her grit or the neighbor who called 911. It hinged on something far more absurd: her daughter noticing that Holt hadn‚Äôt texted her daily Wordle score. The absence of those five letters and their attendant emoji squares‚Äînormally as reliable as sunrise‚Äîsparked alarm. It was like realizing your mom hadn‚Äôt watered the ficus. But worse.

This is the central contradiction of the daily game phenomenon: rituals born from boredom now serve as existential tethers. Wordle, Connections, Strands, and their algorithmic cousins are designed to be¬†*disposable*. They reset every 24 hours, erasing yesterday‚Äôs progress like a Buddhist sand mandala. Yet their social residue lingers. Sharing a score is the digital equivalent of a hunter-gatherer leaving a mark on a cave wall:¬†*I was here. This is how I did. Did you do better?*¬†It‚Äôs competitive camaraderie, a paradox that only makes sense in a culture where we‚Äôve replaced shared physical experiences with asynchronous validation.

The brilliance of these games is their frictionless intimacy. Unlike Instagram or TikTok‚Äîwhich demand the curation of a persona‚Äîdaily games require no aesthetic labor. You don‚Äôt ‚Äúpost‚Äù; you¬†*emit*. A grid of emoji squares is both utterly meaningless and profoundly personal. It says:¬†*I spent three minutes today thinking about a five-letter word for ‚Äúgossip‚Äù while my Amazon delivery languished in the rain, and now I‚Äôm telling you about it because we‚Äôre both pretending we don‚Äôt know how alone we are*.

Historically, communal games required proximity: bridge clubs, church softball leagues, that one summer everyone played¬†*Magic: The Gathering*¬†in the food court. Daily games thrive on absence. They‚Äôre the logical endpoint of a society that equates ‚Äúconnection‚Äù with the ability to ignore someone in 17 different formats. A family text thread buzzing with Strands solutions isn‚Äôt just a thread‚Äîit‚Äôs a s√©ance. We‚Äôre conjuring the ghosts of pre-internet kinship, back when ‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you do on the crossword?‚Äù was something you asked a person holding an actual newspaper, in a room you both inhabited, while drinking coffee that didn‚Äôt cost $7.

But here‚Äôs the rub: Holt‚Äôs story isn‚Äôt¬†*about*¬†Wordle. It‚Äôs about how we‚Äôve outsourced care to the dumbest possible proxies. We live in a world where ‚ÄúI‚Äôll know you‚Äôre safe if you text me a green square‚Äù is not just plausible but¬†*relatable*. The horror isn‚Äôt that Holt‚Äôs ordeal happened‚Äîit‚Äôs that we all instantly grasp the logic of her rescue. A missing Wordle score as a distress signal? Of course. Why wouldn‚Äôt it be? We‚Äôve already accepted that ‚Äústreaks‚Äù measure friendship and that ‚Äúlikes‚Äù approximate love. That Holt‚Äôs life was saved by a game owned by¬†*The New York Times*¬†(a company that once tried to sell us on the idea that¬†*spelling*¬†could be a competitive sport) is both bleak and perversely uplifting. It‚Äôs like learning your car‚Äôs GPS once guided an ambulance through traffic. Sure, it‚Äôs designed to sell you ads for nearby Arby‚Äôs‚Äîbut hey, sometimes it works.

Maybe this is the future of belonging: tiny, daily acts of mutual recognition that mean nothing and everything. We‚Äôll play these games until they‚Äôre replaced by whatever comes next‚Äîholographic Sudoku, AI-generated¬†*Jeopardy!*¬†for dogs‚Äîand we‚Äôll pretend not to notice that we‚Äôre using them to answer questions we‚Äôre afraid to ask aloud:¬†*Are you okay? Are we okay? Did you need a hint today, or did you need me?*

The green squares will never say. But we‚Äôll keep counting them anyway.

God has been telling me lately to be a little more trusting , despite all the other untrusting people in the comments‚Ä¶. So I decided to try Hugo‚Äôs brain blend . 

Although at 28$ USD. I wouldn‚Äôt have purchased this myself tbh , that is unless I really liked Yerba. Which after reviewing . I do like it . Mainly as a medicine . I didn‚Äôt really like its flavor tbh . 

It is a little bitter for my liking , but that is because I do not like the taste of Ginko , I already take it every morning , and would not have got this blend. I am eyeballing the slim and trim version . 

The first time I brewed it I did not have a bombilla so I used a tea bag . Don‚Äôt be like me . Just buy the bombilla. It didn‚Äôt work right 

Second time I brewed it with a tea strainer pot. Water about 180 degrees

Wow what a difference! Sustainable non jittery energy for most the day! I did have to drink more later tho 

Then I went ahead and ordered a set of Bombillas and got serious 

Again what an awesome way to drink tea! 

Again I am a first timer and have no idea what bad Yerba would be like , but I assume it‚Äôd have a lot of powder and this one has 0 powder, never clogs the straw 

I do not own a French press so I didn‚Äôt make it that way, but all in all this is some very high quality tea/yerba and I thank Hugo for being able to try it !

1ihhyks,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1ihhyks/my_battle_with_anxiety_a_novel/,My battle with anxiety‚Ä¶ a novel.,"Hey there my anxious friends. I‚Äôve been a lurker here for a minute and I can say I‚Äôve found my community of people who truly understand. I was diagnosed with GAD (General Anxiety Disorder) back in 2011. I‚Äôd never had anxiety that I noticed before but it all started with an incident of embarrassment and alarm with my IBS. Suffice to say, I have not visited Babe‚Äôs Chicken Dinner House since. üòë

It was so bad, and correlated with my IBS (or maybe flared it up) that I became agoraphobic. I could only go to work and home. To get gas or go grocery shopping I wasn‚Äôt able to do until months later and I had to know where the bathrooms were at all times and couldn‚Äôt stray too far. I was prescribed Klonopin. It helped during times of high stress and I had a highly stressful job and life at the time. I became acclimated to it and had to keep upping the dose to I believe it was 4mgs a day (2 in the morning, 2 at night). I became dependent on it, but not as horribly as some. I took it because I needed it, not to get high. I got the best sleep of my life during those times which I miss, especially nowadays. Long story short I did titrate myself slowly over time to 2 mgs a day. It wasn‚Äôt until I moved to a different city in 2015 that I noticed flyers at my new doctor‚Äôs office that controlled substances were basically being phased out and I was scared. Eventually I was hospitalized for an SA that same year and I voluntarily put myself in there for 5 days. I didn‚Äôt realize it at the time but they took me down to 1mg a day which I was pissed about because they never told me they were gonna do that and also, I was having brain zaps and all kinds of shakes. It was awful but my body adapted. Eventually I had a more difficult time to find a prescriber to prescribe my 1mg of medication and so I knew I was gonna have to take the plunge and get off it completely. I was scared, very scared. I was introduced to ketamine therapy in 2018, and that helped me to get off klonopin and kinda give me a buffer for anxiety. It unfortunately didn‚Äôt help though as my body again became acclimated and the dose I had to do at the clinic became higher and to the point where I had a scare and I stopped completely. My final ketamine treatment and I was totally sober for the whole thing was in 2021. Since then, I have been white knuckling my anxiety. I‚Äôve tried meditating which helps for a minute and I do need to get back into that but it‚Äôs gotten to the point now where I can hardly sleep. I don‚Äôt drink caffeinated coffee anymore, I rarely drink full caff tea. I‚Äôve been unemployed for a month now and it‚Äôs been horrible for me and yet at the same time I‚Äôve been battling with PTSD from my last employment experience. I‚Äôve done DBT therapy, talk therapy and now about to start CBT therapy but my mind has been racing so horribly I haven‚Äôt even touched my workbook. The state of our nation hasn‚Äôt helped at all. The fact that I‚Äôve been applying for part time work in anything that I can handle for a month has been stressful. My body has been truly going through it with my stress and anxiety. This has been a nightmare. I know I‚Äôm not alone. Getting out of bed has been a challenge nowadays. I‚Äôm at my wits end. Now my body has been doing its own thing. Higher blood pressure, increased heart rate, can‚Äôt sleep. The doom scrolling hasn‚Äôt helped for sure. I‚Äôve gotten off all social media except Reddit but even that which I love to see as I do get some laughs from the comments, it‚Äôs now flooded with so much horror from the news even though I didn‚Äôt sign up for it. I‚Äôm scared‚Ä¶ very very scared. 

So thank you for reading my novel, I‚Äôm not really looking for advice, I just need a hug really. I have my boyfriend who‚Äôs been an absolute superstar for me, but even still my anxiety is even affecting him, as I cannot fucking sleep. 

Many hugs to those that are suffering more so than me. Many more hugs to those that need it. Thank you for letting me share üôè‚ù§Ô∏è",1,1738676700.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False
1ihhxij,https://www.reddit.com/r/VestibularMigraines/comments/1ihhxij/is_it_possible_for_diet_not_to_be_a_trigger/,Is it possible for diet NOT to be a trigger?,"I have chronic vestibular migraines. So when they come about, the symptoms are there 24/7 and can last from weeks to months. 

When I first saw my neurologist, he didn't mention anything about diet. I started taking magnesium supplements and they just went away. Whether that's from the magnesium or something else, I don't know. But since they had gone away, he didn't prescribe any other medication. 

Thing is, when it went, it was gone completely. I was back to normal. And because I didn't know certain foods could be a trigger, I was just eating like normal, and the migraines never got triggered. 

Chocolate, cheese, onions, you name it. I don't drink any alcohol or caffeine (apart from what's in chocolate, but I mean I don't drink coffee or tea or energy drinks) and the migraines just... Never triggered. 

Flash forward to now, and the week they started I was going through MAJOR stress from another health issue and lo and behold, the dizziness started once more. 

Whilst I've found that certain foods make the migraines worse once they're already triggered (cheddar seems to be a big one, so I'm guessing other hard ages cheeses will too), it doesn't seem to trigger then when I'm outside of those chronic attacks, if that makes sense?

1ihhu02,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameTableCentral/comments/1ihhu02/sweetcrispy_l_shaped_desk_ac2529l02gy_review_for/,Sweetcrispy L Shaped Desk AC2-529-L02GY review for gaming and work enthusiasts,"Having spent weeks with the Sweetcrispy L Shaped Desk AC2-529-L02GY, I can confidently say it's a versatile addition to any gaming or home office setup. From unboxing to everyday use, it‚Äôs been an experience worth sharing. Sure, it‚Äôs not perfect, but what is? Let me break it down for you.

The design grabbed my attention right away. With its polished wood tabletop and sturdy metal frame, the Sweetcrispy desk manages to combine elegance with functionality. The grey finish is understated yet modern, blending seamlessly with other furniture in my workspace. The L-shaped design is not just trendy; it's practical, wrapping neatly into a corner and maximizing floor space. While it felt quite lightweight when assembling, the finished product turned out to be surprisingly sturdy. A minor gripe, though, is that the metal legs lack adjustable feet, meaning uneven flooring could cause slight wobbling.

This desk fits snugly into smaller spaces, but don‚Äôt let its compact design fool you‚Äîit‚Äôs got plenty of room for multitasking. I‚Äôve managed to fit two monitors, a laptop, and even my gaming console without feeling cramped. The reversible setup lets you customize the longer side, making it perfect for left or right-hand configurations. My only issue is that the shorter side could feel a tad narrow if you‚Äôre someone who likes spreading out paperwork or additional gadgets.

Moving on to the features, Sweetcrispy has done an admirable job. The built-in side storage bag is a lifesaver for keeping clutter off the desk. I‚Äôve stuffed it with controllers, cables, and random office supplies, and it‚Äôs handled the load like a champ. The CPU stand is another thoughtful addition, keeping my PC off the floor while ensuring proper ventilation. While there‚Äôs no cup holder, the desk‚Äôs ample space allowed me to designate a safe corner for my mug of coffee‚Äîno tragic spills yet!

Assembly was a breeze. The instructions were straightforward, and all the parts were labeled clearly. I‚Äôm no DIY expert, but it took me just about an hour to put everything together solo. However, I‚Äôd recommend tightening the screws periodically, as they tend to loosen up with heavy use.

**Pros**

* Sturdy and elegant design with a polished wood finish.
* Reversible configuration adapts to different room layouts.
* Side storage bag and CPU stand enhance usability.
* Compact yet spacious enough for dual monitors and accessories.

**Cons**

* Legs lack adjustable feet, creating potential instability on uneven floors.
* Shorter side might feel cramped for extensive setups.
* Screws may require occasional tightening.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
Compared to other desks in this price range, the Sweetcrispy L Shaped Desk stands out for its design and functionality. For instance, it feels more robust than the GreenForest L-Shaped Desk, which can feel flimsy under heavy setups. Additionally, Sweetcrispy‚Äôs side storage bag is a feature missing in competitors like the SHW L-Shaped Corner Desk. However, if you‚Äôre looking for a desk with integrated cable management or a built-in cup holder, you might lean towards pricier options like the Mr. Ironstone Gaming Desk. Sweetcrispy excels in balancing cost with essential features, but it could use minor tweaks to outshine its rivals completely.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
Sweetcrispy has managed to strike a sweet spot between affordability and usability. While it‚Äôs not the cheapest desk out there, the combination of design, features, and sturdiness justifies the cost. Higher-end options might offer fancy extras, but for those on a budget or setting up a starter workspace, this desk delivers excellent value.

In terms of features, the desk‚Äôs reversible nature is a massive plus for versatility. The polished finish and metal frame give it a premium feel, while being relatively lightweight for its size. I‚Äôve tested it with heavy monitors and a CPU, and it hasn‚Äôt shown signs of strain. The wood surface is easy to clean‚Äîjust a quick wipe with a damp cloth does the trick. However, the lack of cable management holes is a slight letdown; I had to get creative with some Velcro ties to keep cords tidy.

My teenage nephew even commented on how cool the desk looks when he borrowed it to set up his gaming rig for a weekend. He loved the spaciousness and the organizational features, though he did complain about the screws loosening after his marathon sessions. This desk has also handled the chaos of my work-from-home days, holding its ground even with stacks of files and a constantly ringing phone.

I started having such severe panic attacks I had to go to the ER and was given Ativan and zofran. I reached out to a psychiatrist and I'm going to be starting Prozac and Ativan next week. However, in an attempt to get myself back on track I started forcing myself to do ""normal"" things again. However, I may have overdone it. For a week straight I got up super early and stayed out late. I went to a solid core class and two 6 mile trail runs, one in the snow the other in the rain. I went out to two parties as well as dinner and coffee out with friends.

Well on Saturday I had one of my parties to go to and was feeling EXHAUSTED. I thought it was just from the week so I went to the party anyway. Sunday I woke up with a cough. I felt really run down and tied all day. I decided to skip work on Monday and slowly throughout the day felt worse and worse. I started getting terrible body aches and chills. My appetite had been okay but of course I started getting anxious about it. 

Well now it's about 5:30am Tuesday morning and I've been up all night panicking. I feel incredibly feverish and have chills and every time I dozed off I wake up with anxiety. I feel so terrible. Now I'm too scared to take ibuprofen because I would need to eat first and don't want to do that, so I took zofran and Ativan instead to try and calm down. 

I am so scared this is going to progress to something with my stomach. Normally I think I could handle this but I think because I've been in such a weak and comfortable mental state this feels nearly impossible to deal with. I am so scared and miss my mom.

As someone who‚Äôs always on the move, I was drawn to its reputation as a reliable travel guitar. The Koa-grained HPL construction, sturdy build, and portability made it an intriguing choice. While it‚Äôs impressed me on many levels, a few quirks stood out too.

The Martin LXK2's design is a conversation starter. Its Koa-grained HPL top, back, and sides are more than just aesthetic‚Äîthey‚Äôre durable and resistant to humidity changes. In my experience, this guitar has survived car rides, camping trips, and even an unfortunate coffee spill without a scratch. The dark natural finish gives it an earthy vibe that blends style with practicality. That said, the matte finish might not appeal to everyone, especially those who prefer a glossy sheen.

Playability is where the Little Martin truly shines. The modified low oval neck shape and 23-inch scale length make it ideal for small hands or anyone who values comfort. My niece, who‚Äôs just starting to learn guitar, found it much easier to handle than my full-sized dreadnought. The Richlite fretboard feels smooth under the fingers, though it does lack the warmth of real wood. While I found the action a bit high out of the box, a quick setup at my local music shop sorted that out.

**Pros**

* Compact and travel-friendly design.
* Durable HPL construction ideal for varying conditions.
* Comfortable neck and fretboard for easy playability.
* Surprisingly loud and balanced sound for its size.
* Great companion for beginners and seasoned players alike.

**Cons**

* Matte finish may not suit everyone‚Äôs taste.
* Requires professional setup to optimize playability.
* Lacks built-in electronics for amplified performances.
* Richlite material doesn‚Äôt have the same feel as traditional wood.
* Limited tonal depth compared to larger guitars.

The sound quality of the Martin LXK2 is remarkable for a guitar this size. Its tonal range leans toward the bright side, with clear highs and balanced mids. While it won‚Äôt replace a full-sized Martin in terms of richness, the projection is impressive enough to fill a small room. I‚Äôve used it for both strumming and fingerpicking, and it holds its own in casual jam sessions. On the downside, seasoned players might find its tonal limitations a bit restrictive.

In comparison to competitors like the Taylor GS Mini and Yamaha FG JR1, the Little Martin has its distinct strengths. The Taylor GS Mini offers a richer tone and more premium feel, but it comes at a higher price and slightly larger size. The Yamaha FG JR1, while affordable, doesn‚Äôt match the Martin in build quality or sound projection. The LXK2 strikes a balance, making it ideal for those who want quality without breaking the bank.

When it comes to value for money, the Martin LXK2 is a solid investment for what it offers. Its portability and durability make it a standout in the travel guitar market. However, the need for a professional setup adds to the initial cost, which is something to consider if you‚Äôre on a tight budget. Despite this, its versatility and reliable performance make it a worthy contender for anyone in need of a compact acoustic guitar.

Features like its fixed bridge system and six-string design are straightforward and beginner-friendly. The absence of built-in electronics might deter those looking to plug in for performances, but it‚Äôs not a deal-breaker for most. Its FSC-certified Richlite fretboard and Stratabond neck highlight Martin's commitment to sustainability, which is a nice touch for the environmentally conscious.

1ihhmxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Jolly-Egg-632/comments/1ihhmxv/gj_gastrointestinal_pain/,"GJ, Gastrointestinal Pain","So I am going to try and make this very long story a lot shorter so as to get to the point in hopes for a possibility of some good ideas on what to do.

So this all started back in 2009 when I had been having major uncontrollable breathing troubles from Asthma, this led to multiple intubation and 3 lung surgeries all to find out a decade later, that i had a rare form of asthma called Eosinophilic Asthma needing a biological medication, not the grocery bag full of meds that not only didn't work, have given lifelong problems.
I say all that to say this, during those times, the doctor thought there was a chance that my stomach acid was burning my airways causing all of these uncomfortable and uncontrollable symptoms. So they decided to do a Stomach Surgery called a Nissenfundoplication.  Immediately I woke feeling horrible and that something was wrong. GP and Surgeon kept saying it was apart of the healing process etc, gave meds that was it.
Well that part turned into me having Dumping Syndrome and massive pain that doesn't go away, just lessens with meds, all do to a faulty Surgery and the Vagus Nerve get cut causing damage and an array of issues. Over the next several years, I will have gotten sent back and forth to the University of Washington for a total of 3 full Reconstructions, truly countless Dialations, multiple partial Reconstructions, a half-way 180¬∞ take down and even botox injections. All to either no avail or very small and short lived moments of being better.
That all turned into them no longer wanting to try and fix that and instead, just manage symptoms. That bright idea led to numerous 2 month long hospital stays where on each occasion, I had lost a minimum of 30 lbs in under 2 months and also leading to Feeding tubes to bypass the upper aspect of things. Started with a G Tube that gave me partial relief for a few months, the assumption things were getting better, they took the G tube out, only to again go right back to where I was, throwing everything up, and having to force down my throat anything that wasn't a true liquid like water/juice/gingeral because it would get stuck there. That then led to another month long stay, lots of weight lost, muscles weakening, truly not doing well, they decide to then convert to a GJ Tube. It lasted about 3 months, failed and flipped over on itself and going back into the stomach,causing internal bleeding. They took it out, replaced with another GJ, it last 1.5 months. Same thing, it became malpositioned causing damage and pain. They admitted me again, replacing it another time, failed 2 days later. So now, after becoming somewhat stable, I will be getting sent home on TPN through a Central Line, a Temporary G Tube and am to come back in a couple weeks for what according to them, will be a first time ever Surgery that they are going off the cuff with in hopes to fix this.

**While all of this has been going on, my symptoms are...Unless it is true liquid such as water, juice, soda, coffee...if there is anything in the way of substance, it will either immediately start getting stuck, requiring me to force it through with a large mouthful of water, or it will build up while passing most of it through but yet still causing me to have to force it through at some point. Once any type of substance food wise hits my stomach, I almost immediately am having to run to the bathroom where I have pure loose stools also causing me to strain very hard, not because I'm backed up, but because the opposite, it comes out very forcefully. This continues until everything I ingested is out leaving nothing left, almost as clear as if I had just done Bowel Prep for a Colonoscopy.**  

**As far as meds, there is nothing I have notq tried nor is there a combination of them that I have not tried. There is only 1 type of medication that helps in the way of lessening the frequency of bathroom trips and that is an Opioid which helps to make it go from 20-30 times a day, down to less then 10. I have tried all combinations of this medicine as well, everytime without, I am stuck to the toilet, messing my pants frequently as it's very difficult to control, and massive cramping, pain and feelings of passing out. With it, at a low dose of 5mg 5 times a day, I cut down all of those problems significantly.  However, it's not an end all fix. The throwing up forcefully as well as the Dumping with forced explosion watery stools, it causes a Chinese finger trap so to speak in my stomach and intestine area which then somehow mechanically destroys the position of the tubes as well as continuous hernias that keep happening.**


So....in a nutshell, this is my story, it has been an absolute nightmare and I along with the Physicians are literally grasping at straws on what to do. Keeping me alive and nourished is the most important, then it's been symptom management. However, without being able to find someone who is willing to go in there one last time to truly fix it all, I'm afraid it will just continue to worsen as it has. I would do anything for that person or persons if they did that, it would be beyond a blessing.

Anyhow...I guess my question is, should I go out of country, say Europe, and see if they would be more willing to perform the surgery needed. Or is that even possible? 

All I know, is I'm 34 years old and my body is just falling apart because of all this. On disability and I am just wanting my life back. To know that there is a Surgery that can be performed and can fix it all, but those involved are afraid to do it in fear of possibly making it worse....it's a hard pill to swallow.  I know that going this route, it only has one direction which leads to just Bad Things. It was actually some nurses who mentioned checking to see of oversees would be a possibility.

But then, there's the whole insurance issues, cost etc.  Which, if it could be done...I guess could all be saved for.

I just was hoping and praying someone stateside would have by now.

Can someone who has done some or all of the destinations provide a comment about this plan?

We are looking to experience and learn about Colombian culture, explore the nature and we love the sea in general. We prefer smaller towns to big cities. Not at all into drinking or clubbing.

The plan is defined based on where we sleep that night:
* Feb 15 - Bogota
    * My friend will arrive the day before while I will land at 4AM
* Feb 16 - Bogota
* Feb 17 - Santa Marta
    * 3:20 PM flight to Santa Marta from Bogota
* Feb 18 - Santa Marta
	- Daytrip PNN Tayrona
* Feb 19 - Cartagena
    * AM bus to Cartagena
* Feb 20 - Cartagena
	* explore city
* Feb 21 - Cartagena
	* daytrip to Parque Nacional Natural Corales del Rosario
* Feb 22 - Providencia
    * AM flights: Cartagena to San Andres, San Andres to Providencia
* Feb 23 - Providencia
* Feb 24 - Providencia
* Feb 25 - Medellin
    * Flights: Providencia to San Andres, San Andres to Medellin
* Feb 26 - Medellin
* Feb 27 - Coffee Axis (Salento)
    * Flight: Medellin to Armenia flight
* Feb 28 - Coffee Axis (Salento)
    * Daytrip to Cocora Valley
* March 1 - Bogota
    * 5:30 PM flight from Armenia to Bogota
* March 2 - Bogota
    * My flight departs at 9AM, my friend's at 9PM

This is what I put together after doing some research online. I'm open ears to any suggestions you might have and until we start booking places to stay I can change any part of it. However these are the parts that looked really cool and would hate to miss:
* PNN Tayrona
* Cocora Valley
* Providencia (this part was the most difficult to fit in and I understand if you suggest to get rid of it, however we both thought it would be really cool to have a trip within a trip by taking a 3 day break in the middle of nowhere, just snorkeling and enjoying the beach)

I used flights wherever I though the extra money is reasonable to save us time and make the trip more pleasant

Full context: This trip is my delayed ""bachelor party"" and also a gift to my friend for his 30th birthday. We have known each other since we were 2, traveled together extensively, our favorite trip was 2.5 weeks in Brazil (Rio, Salvador do Bahia, Ilha Grande) back in 2016. We are trying to relive some of that with this trip.

We now live on different continents, I recently got married and I have a kid on the way so it's very realistic that this is our last chance for a trip together. Because of that, I don't mind pushing with the itinerary to make the trip truly epic and something we remember for the years to come.

Tax deduction is not the same as tax credit. So no, there isn't any offsetting happening.

\--

https://preview.redd.it/tizwn3bnj4he1.png?width=1988&format=png&auto=webp&s=71a688560cfefb1332e95fca6d41dfa75aacd925

Since this is a hot topic right now, I wanted to present a simple computation of the net effect of PWD discounts on a company's income statement and financial position. To keep things simple, assume the following:

1. Purchases = Cost of Goods Sold (for easier comparison).
2. This is a sale to one customer (e.g., a cup of coffee).
3. Input VAT allocation rules are ignored (to avoid complications with common input VAT).
4. The income tax rate is 20%.

**Notes**

1. The PWD discount directly doesn't affect sales revenue (naturally because sales are always recorded net of VAT)
2. Since PWD sales are VAT-exempt, output VAT is not recorded.
3. The company gets an ""additional deduction"" for income tax purposes, equal to the discount amount. However, this does not work as a tax credit‚Äîmeaning, it only reduces taxable income, not the VAT payable/Income Tax payable directly. 

**Net tax effect**

* This means the business only saves literally¬†**20% of the discount amount in taxes**¬†(assuming the income tax rate is 20%).
* The remaining¬†80% of the discount is fully shouldered by the business.",3,1738675623.0,Philippines,2,1.0,False

My personal take!,"Testing out the Verilux VT52WW3 HappyLight Alba has been an interesting journey. I'll admit, I was skeptical at first. A small, round LED therapy lamp designed to simulate natural sunlight? Could it really boost my mood, improve sleep, and help with focus during those gloomy days? Well, after using it daily for a few weeks, I can confidently share my thoughts‚Äîquirks, features, and all.

**Design & Build Quality**

The Verilux HappyLight Alba is a sleek, compact lamp that doesn‚Äôt scream ‚Äútherapy device.‚Äù It fits in nicely on my desk, blending in with my other gadgets rather than standing out as a medical tool. Its round shape and bright white exterior give it a modern aesthetic, and at just over 1 pound, it‚Äôs lightweight enough to move around the house. I‚Äôve carried it between my office and bedroom with ease. While the materials feel sturdy, I‚Äôd advise being mindful of the cord attachment‚Äîone accidental tug, and the charger could bend, as happened to another user.

[Check Verilux VT52WW3 HappyLight Alba price on Amazon here.](https://agegene.com/product/verilux-happylight-alba-vt52ww3-review-b08kshjhdn/)

**Ease of Use**

Setting up this lamp was a breeze. It has intuitive touchpads for brightness and color temperature adjustments, so I didn‚Äôt need an engineering degree to figure it out. The countdown timer is a thoughtful addition, letting me set it to run for up to an hour in 10-minute increments. I use it during my morning coffee ritual, setting it to 30 minutes to jumpstart my day.

**Performance & Effectiveness**

This little device packs a punch with its 10,000 Lux brightness‚Äîmimicking natural sunlight without the harmful UV rays. I‚Äôve noticed a significant improvement in my energy levels, particularly on overcast days. As someone who struggles with winter blues, this has been a game-changer. That said, I can‚Äôt say it works miracles overnight. It took about two weeks of consistent use before I really felt the benefits.

**Comfort**

Using the HappyLight Alba is a pleasant sensory experience. The adjustable brightness and color temperatures (ranging from warm yellowish tones to cool white) ensure I can customize it for the time of day or my mood. I didn‚Äôt experience any harsh glare, and the light feels natural‚Äînot like staring into a flashlight.

**Battery Life & Charging**

Here‚Äôs where the lamp shows its limitations. It‚Äôs corded electric and designed for indoor use only. While I appreciate the USB-C connectivity, the lack of support for generic USB-C PD chargers is a missed opportunity. Imagine being able to use this with a battery pack or a spare charger! That would‚Äôve made it perfect for travel or outdoor spaces.

**Additional Features**

The dimmable settings and adjustable color temperatures are standout features. You can go from a gentle warm tone for relaxation to a bright white for maximum energy boost. The countdown timer is a lifesaver for forgetful folks like me; I can set it and not worry about turning it off manually.

**Safety & Skin Sensitivity**

The lamp is UV-free, so there‚Äôs no risk of skin damage or irritation. I‚Äôve used it daily without any issues, and even my partner, who has sensitive skin, found it perfectly safe.

**Pros**

* Compact and stylish design that blends in anywhere.
* User-friendly controls with intuitive touchpads.
* Adjustable brightness and color temperature settings.
* Effective at improving mood and energy levels over time.
* Countdown timer is convenient for timed sessions.

**Cons**

* Corded design limits portability.
* USB-C compatibility doesn‚Äôt extend to generic chargers.
* Some features, like timers or light modes, may occasionally glitch.
* Not water-resistant, so forget using it in damp environments.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Compared to other light therapy lamps like the Circadian Optics Lumos or the Carex Day-Light Classic Plus, the Verilux HappyLight Alba stands out for its compact design and customizable settings. While the Carex offers a larger light surface, it lacks the portability and aesthetic appeal of the HappyLight Alba. The Circadian Optics Lumos, on the other hand, leans heavily on ultra-modern design but doesn‚Äôt offer the same level of brightness or adjustability.

One area where Verilux could improve is power flexibility. Some competitors allow battery operation or generic USB-C charging, which would‚Äôve been a nice addition here.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

While I can't mention exact pricing, I‚Äôd say the HappyLight Alba offers good value for its features. It‚Äôs not the cheapest light therapy lamp out there, but the design, adjustability, and performance make it worth considering. It‚Äôs an investment in your well-being, particularly for those of us dealing with seasonal affective disorder or long, sunless winters. That said, if portability or outdoor use is a priority, you might want to explore other options.

**Final Thoughts on Features**

Every feature of the HappyLight Alba is designed with user comfort in mind. The touch controls are simple yet effective, and the adjustable settings ensure you get the right intensity for your needs. The timer is a welcome addition, keeping you from overusing the lamp. However, the occasional glitches with timers or light modes, as noted by some users, suggest it‚Äôs not without flaws.

Just know I am a skeptic through and through, cause majority of these people are lying for a paycheck. These are being advertised as 50% pure perfume concentration... and I'm happy to report that I do in fact believe that, and the hype is REAL. 



**Caramel Vanilla** is HEAVENLY. It's marketed as a Bianco Latte dupe, but I've personally never smelled the OG. I've heard a lot of people say it's truly spot on, and if that's the case, I'm buying Bianco Latte. It's truly a warm, SLIGHTLY cinnamon-y caramel vanilla and it feels nostalgic to me. All noses are different, but this really is unique to my nose, and I've got a pretty good size collection. I feel like the longevity is pretty good, considering I paid 20 something a bottle for 4oz. It lasted about 7/8 hours on my clothes, about 4/5 on skin.

**Vanilla Latte** knocked my socks off with how strong and projecting it is. You quite literally only need ONE SPRAY and it's stout as an ox. I have NEVER smelled a body mist that accurate to the name. Do you ever get a latte and when you're done drinking it you smell the cup? Just me? Ok. Well that's exactly what it smells like... spot on. I wasn't sure how to feel about it at first, but I love it now. It literally smells like you're in a coffee shop! Definitely the most accurate coffee scent I've ever smelled! Wear time is freakin eternal, you can smell this the next day.

**Creme Brulee** is really good, but a little closer to the skin than I prefer & wear time on the skin is about 3/4 hours. I really like my perfumes to project, and this one isn't the loudest one in the room. I feel like this is an intimate scent that honestly makes you smell edible. It's a warm, sweet, sugary true creme brulee scent. It's VERY sweet, so brace yourself. My brain almost believes it's cotton candy at times it's so so sweet! It's allegedly duping Escapade Gourmande, but I haven't smelled that one so I can't vouch for how accurate it is, unfortunately. However, THIS is the scent you wanna wear when you're cuddling up to your significant other! I'd definitely repurchase, it's worth it because the smell is incredible.

**Coco Vanilla** is just kinda ok... I was hoping for a more prominent coconut and vanilla,  but this one just kinda smells.... clean? This one is marketed to be a dupe of Madagascar Vanilla by Nest, but -shocker- I haven't smelled that one either, so I can't confirm. I will say that I feel like it's a clean girl coconut scent, no buttery, warm, sugary vanilla coconut here. This was my least favorite of the bunch, I'm just a gourmand girly. This has average/medium projection, about 7/8 hour wear on clothes. 

**Love & Marshmallows** is truly a SPOT.ON.DUPE for Love Don't Be Shy. I have LDBS and I can't tell the two apart. I don't mean this in a ""oh, maybe after a while you can't tell, or when they dry down for a few hours or etc, etc."" I'm not kidding. From the first spray to the end of the dry down you CAN NOT tell the two apart. I hate when people say things are dupes and they're butt backward opposite, but this isn't the case... it's the most accurate dupe I've ever smelled of this perfume. Longevity is good, you get about 7/8 hours out of this, projection is medium. DEFINITELY recommend this over the perfume, save some $$.

  
Granted all noses are different, but here are my honest opinions of Scentuals. I fell for the hype and I'm SO glad I did. They're worth every penny, and the price is right. They have roller balls for $9.95, so maybe start there if you're not ready for the full body mist plunge!

I've been doing a variation of Scott Rao's blooming espresso to take advantage of the lack of a solenoid valve on this machine.

The one downside to this method given the thermojet system in the breville is that the first couple drops after the bloom might be overheated, but otherwise the temp is PID controlled at 93 degrees, and I haven't noticed a ""cooked"" flavor in my espresso yet. I've tried this method with ultra light coffee from S&W which I grind around 25 clicks (with burr lock at -1) on my kingrinder and Regalia coffee which I tend to do around 28 clicks.

1ihh5ut,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dbmlore/comments/1ihh5ut/the_innocent_runaway_2_project_build/,"""The Innocent Runaway #2"" (Project Build)","The air of unease is slowly dissipating as Sento tinkers with a gadget, and Banjou reluctantly sips his soda.

Suddenly, the door bursts open with a loud clang.

Misora: Sento, I‚Äôve got something for you!

The sudden noise startles Banjou so much that he leaps up, yells incoherently, and trips over the edge of the workbench. He lands face-first directly on top of Sento, knocking over several tools and bottles in the process.

Sento: (muffled under Banjou) You‚Äôve got to be kidding me‚Ä¶

Banjou: (panicking) AH! I-I didn‚Äôt mean to‚ÄîWhat the hell! Why do people just burst in like this?!

Misora: (deadpan, arms crossed, glaring) Wow. You‚Äôre loud. Who‚Äôs the idiot crushing Sento?

Banjou: (scrambling to get up) Idiot?! Hey, who the hell are you calling‚Äî

He finally looks up at Misora, who is staring at him with her usual unimpressed expression.

Banjou: (pointing, backing up nervously) W-What‚Äôs with her eyes? She‚Äôs looking at me like she‚Äôs gonna murder me or something!

Misora: (coldly) I might. If you keep yelling.

Sento: (dusting himself off, glaring at Banjou) Get off me. Now.

Banjou quickly steps aside, visibly shaken as Misora walks over to Sento and hands him a glowing purple and black bottle.

Misora: Here. Gorilla Fullbottle. Purified, as usual.

Sento: (inspecting the bottle, ignoring Banjou‚Äôs wide-eyed stare) Nice. This‚Äôll be useful. Thanks.

Banjou: (whispering to Soichi, who‚Äôs standing in the corner smirking) What‚Äôs her deal? She looks like she hasn‚Äôt slept in weeks!

Soichi: (grinning) Oh, that‚Äôs just her default setting. You‚Äôll get used to it. Or you won‚Äôt. Either way, it‚Äôs fun to watch.

Misora: (turning her glare to Banjou) Who‚Äôs the loudmouth, anyway?

Sento: (sighing) Unfortunately, he‚Äôs our latest 'project.' Banjou Ryuga, escaped convict, and perpetual headache.

Banjou: (offended) Hey! I‚Äôm sitting right here! And what do you mean by 'project'?!

Misora: (shrugging) Great. Another one.

Banjou: (gesturing wildly) Another one?! What does that mean?! Are you collecting weirdos or something?!

Misora: Pretty much. (To Sento) Do I even want to know why he‚Äôs here?

Sento: (dryly) Probably not. But don‚Äôt worry. He‚Äôs already broken half my lab equipment, so he‚Äôs fitting in perfectly.

Banjou: Hey! That‚Äôs not true! ‚Ä¶Okay, maybe I bumped into a few things, but that‚Äôs on you for making everything so fragile!

Misora: (ignoring him, pointing to the Gorilla Fullbottle) Just don‚Äôt waste this one, okay? And maybe keep your new pet on a leash.

Banjou: (offended, again) Pet?! Who are you calling a pet?!

Misora: (completely deadpan) You. Obviously.

Soichi: (bursting into laughter) This is gold. I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt close up shop yet.

Sento: (already focusing back on the Fullbottle) Banjou, stop yelling. Misora, try not to scare him too much. And Soichi‚Ä¶ just, stop enjoying this so much.

Banjou: (grumbling, crossing his arms) I‚Äôm starting to think escaping prison was the easy part‚Ä¶

Sento: (to no one in particular) Where do I even begin with this mess‚Ä¶

Suddenly, a voice cuts through the room.

Sawa: (cheerfully) I think I can help with that!

Everyone turns to see Sawa Takigawa standing at the entrance of the lab, holding a notepad and a camera slung over her shoulder.

Sento: (narrowing his eyes) Who are you, and how did you get in here?

Sawa: (grinning) Sawa Takigawa, journalist extraordinaire! Nice to meet you. Oh, and, uh, your door was open. The fridge door, to be exact.

Sento: (glaring at Soichi) The fridge door?

Soichi: (scratching his head, awkward) Ah‚Ä¶ Right. That. Okay, look, I saw you and the loudmouth over there‚Äî (gestures to Banjou) ‚Äîheading into the hideout. I thought you were bringing some random stranger in, so I rushed to stop you‚Ä¶ and, uh‚Ä¶ forgot to close it.

Sento: (deadpan) So, in your panic to stop me from bringing in a stranger, you left the literal entrance to our secret base wide open for anyone to waltz in?

Soichi: (grinning sheepishly) When you put it that way, yeah‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs exactly what happened.

Sawa: (looking around in awe) So this is the infamous Kamen Rider‚Äôs hideout! I‚Äôve got to admit, it‚Äôs a bit more‚Ä¶ cluttered than I imagined.

Banjou: (raising an eyebrow) Wait, wait, wait. You‚Äôre saying this random lady knows about Kamen Rider, and now she‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ here?!

Sawa: (ignoring Banjou, turning to Sento) Shouldn‚Äôt you be flattered? You‚Äôve got a bit of a reputation, you know. Mysterious vigilante saving people from monsters? That‚Äôs front-page stuff!

Sento: (crossing his arms, skeptical) Shouldn‚Äôt you be busy covering the election? You‚Äôre a journalist, not a monster hunter.

Sawa: (grinning) Oh, trust me, I‚Äôve been covering plenty. But then I heard rumors about this underground hero, and I couldn‚Äôt resist. Plus, politicians are boring compared to you.

Sento: (sighing) And what exactly do you want?

Sawa: (brightly) A deal! I won‚Äôt breathe a word about your secret base or your gadgets, but in exchange, I get to document Kamen Rider Build in action. Photos, footage, the whole shebang!

Sento: (narrowing his eyes) That sounds like a terrible idea.

Sawa: (leaning forward, smirking) Come on, it‚Äôs a win-win. You get to save the day, and I get the exclusive story of a lifetime. What do you say?

Misora: (to Sento) She‚Äôs not wrong. And it‚Äôs not like we can afford to have her blabbing to anyone else.

Sento: (grudgingly) Fine. But if you get in the way, you‚Äôre on your own.

Sawa: (snapping a photo of Sento) Deal!

Banjou: (grumbling) Great. Another loudmouth.

Sawa: (tilting her head) What‚Äôs with you, anyway? You look like you just crawled out of prison.

Banjou: (sarcastic) Oh, good observation, Sherlock.

Sento: (murmuring to himself, sarcastic) Unraveled what‚Äôs left of my humanity, and now this is my life‚Ä¶

Sawa: (raising an eyebrow) Wow, dramatic much? You always this stoic and cold?

Sento: (deadpan) No. Sometimes I‚Äôm worse.

Misora: (watching Sawa with interest) You know, I think we‚Äôre going to get along.

Sawa: (grinning) Oh, absolutely. We can swap gossip while the boys sulk and mope.

Misora: (nodding) Girl stuff.

Banjou: (offended) Hey! I‚Äôm right here!

Soichi: (laughing) This is getting interesting. I should pop some popcorn.

***Later***

Misora, Soichi, and Sawa are sitting around a table, sipping coffee and gossiping about Sento. Meanwhile, Sento is in a corner, seated with his headphones on, lost in thought as he scrolls through his notes, occasionally tapping a pen on the table. Banjou is leaning back in a chair, watching the others with mild interest.

Soichi: (grinning, leaning forward) You know, the scariest thing about Sento isn‚Äôt the gadgets or the Rider stuff. It‚Äôs watching him train.

Sawa: (raising an eyebrow, intrigued) Train? You mean like‚Ä¶ fighting Smash or whatever?

Soichi: (shaking his head) No, no, not just that. I‚Äôm talking about his forest routine.

Misora: (rolling her eyes) Oh, here we go. Dad‚Äôs story about the ‚Äòscary ninja scientist.‚Äô

Soichi: (ignoring her sarcasm) I‚Äôm serious! The guy‚Äôs like a machine out there. He takes this old handgun‚Äîwho even knows where he got it‚Äîand starts shooting at these makeshift targets. His aim is freakishly precise. Like, he‚Äôll hit the bullseye every single time, even from, I dunno, thirty or forty meters away.

Sawa: (leaning in, fascinated) Really? That doesn‚Äôt sound like something a scientist would do.

Misora: (snorting) You‚Äôd think, right? But wait, there‚Äôs more.

Soichi: (nodding eagerly) Oh, yeah. Then he pulls out these axes‚Äîaxes, mind you‚Äîand starts throwing them at trees. You know how hard it is to stick an axe in a tree from a distance? He does it effortlessly. Perfect aim, perfect precision, every single time.

Sawa: (wide-eyed) Axes? Seriously? Who is this guy?

Misora: (grinning) Wait till you hear about the bow and arrow.

Soichi: (chuckling) Oh, yeah. That‚Äôs the best part. He takes this old-school bow‚Äîno fancy tech, just a plain wooden bow‚Äîand starts firing arrows like he‚Äôs Robin Hood. He‚Äôll even hit moving targets if the wind‚Äôs blowing. It‚Äôs freaky how focused he gets. Like, everything slows down for him.

Sawa: (laughing nervously) Okay, remind me not to piss him off.

Misora: (leaning back, crossing her arms) It‚Äôs creepy sometimes, sure. But, honestly, he‚Äôs a good guy. Kind of a dork, though.

Sawa: (amused) A dork? The same guy you just described as a precision-obsessed marksman?

Misora: (grinning) Oh, yeah. You should see him when he‚Äôs working here. He‚Äôs a total neat freak in the kitchen. If a plate isn‚Äôt perfectly clean or the latte art is off, he‚Äôll redo it like three times. But the customers love him. They say he‚Äôs stoic but polite. And I‚Äôll admit, he makes a mean cappuccino.

Soichi: (nodding in agreement) He might be all broody and intense, but he‚Äôs reliable. When I‚Äôm off on my‚Ä¶ uh, adventures, he keeps the cafe running like clockwork. People like him, even if he‚Äôs a bit of an enigma.

Misora: (teasing) And he‚Äôs got some good abs. You know, for a science nerd.

Sawa: (staring at Misora, horrified) Misora!

Misora: (laughing) What? I‚Äôm just saying! It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm interested or anything. He‚Äôs practically family. Plus, I think he‚Äôs too busy being all ‚Äòtragic anti-hero‚Äô to notice stuff like that.

Soichi: (shaking his head) I don‚Äôt even want to know how you noticed that.

Sawa: (smirking) Well, at least he‚Äôs close to you, Misora. Sounds like he‚Äôs got a softer side.

Misora: (shrugging) He‚Äôs a good friend. Always listens when I need to vent. And, yeah, he‚Äôs probably the emotional type, even if he acts all cold and stoic. But don‚Äôt tell him I said that.

Sawa: (grinning)""Your secret‚Äôs safe with me.

Cut to Sento who is still at the corner table, completely oblivious to their conversation. He‚Äôs bobbing his head slightly to whatever music he‚Äôs listening to on his wireless headphones.

Banjou: (nudging him) Hey. What‚Äôre you listening to, anyway?

Sento: (removing one headphone, glancing at Banjou) ABBA. Why?

Banjou: (blinking) Seriously? Winner Takes It All and all that?

Sento: (putting the headphone back on) You wouldn‚Äôt understand.

Banjou: (muttering) Yeah, you‚Äôre right. I probably wouldn‚Äôt.

Back to the gossiping trio.

Misora: (leaning toward Sawa, whispering) By the way, I caught him listening to Nirvana once. Something sad, obviously.

Sawa: (grinning) So, broody scientist, precision marksman, part-time barista, and secret music lover. He really is a walking contradiction.

Soichi: (laughing) And yet, somehow, we like him.

Misora: (smiling) Yeah. We do.

The scene shifts to a dimly lit private office, its walls adorned with historical memorabilia, maps, and dossiers. A large oak desk sits at the center, covered in neatly stacked papers and an untouched cup of tea. Gentoku sits in a high-backed leather chair, steepling his fingers as his piercing gaze meets the quiet yet attentive Utsumi, who stands at his side holding a tablet.

Gentoku (calm, reflective): The day of the rebellion against ELITE. A pivotal moment, wouldn‚Äôt you agree, Utsumi?

Utsumi (stoic): It certainly changed the course of history. The Commonwealth‚Äôs independence was solidified, and ELITE‚Äôs fall sent shockwaves across the globe.

Gentoku (leaning back slightly): My father‚Ä¶ always the idealist. He thought disbanding ELITE would create a better future, a cleaner government. He believed he could sweep away the corruption and pave a golden path for this nation.

Utsumi (dryly): And yet the corrupt fled to the Republic, taking their venom with them.

Gentoku (smirking): Precisely. But even in chaos, there‚Äôs opportunity. The criminals once controlled by ELITE‚Ä¶ they were tools, disposable and easily replaced. My father saw them as nothing more than cannon fodder, but I see‚Ä¶ potential.

Utsumi (raising an eyebrow): Potential?

Gentoku: The former prisoners... ELITE treated them as disposable tools, but I see something more. Weapons. Weapons with grudges, vengeance in their hearts, and no allegiance to anyone but their own anger.

He pauses near a map of the city on the wall, running his fingers along it as if tracing invisible battle lines.

Gentoku: Heroes have always been their 
captors, their judges, their executioners. Society worships these so-called protectors while criminals rot in the shadows, forgotten, beaten, and discarded.

Utsumi (calmly): And you believe they'll fight for us?

Gentoku (grinning): They don‚Äôt need to fight for us. They‚Äôll fight for themselves. For their revenge. We don‚Äôt need loyalty, Utsumi. We need chaos. Targeting Build will give them that opportunity‚Äîa chance to destroy the image of a hero, to expose their hypocrisy.

He moves back to his desk, leaning on it as he locks eyes with Utsumi, his tone dropping to a dangerous whisper.

Gentoku: Heroes think themselves untouchable, elevated by their powers or their ideals. But when those ideals crumble, when the people they‚Äôve condemned rise up against them, what will they do then?

Utsumi (adjusting his glasses): Build will become the ultimate symbol of their downfall.

Gentoku (nodding): Exactly. Unlike the alien Mebius, Build is human. He can bleed. He can break. He can die. But before that, he will suffer‚Äîphysically, mentally, and emotionally. I want these criminals to strip him of everything. Every victory, every bond, every shred of hope.
He pauses, his expression hardening, the weight of his ambition evident in his voice.

Gentoku: Those who don't know better may think our actions are acts of the devil. However, even if our hands are soaked in blood, we will turn this country into what it has the potential to be!

Utsumi (nodding approvingly): A necessary evil for a greater purpose.

Gentoku: Precisely. The election may distract the masses, but our work begins now. Find the criminals, the former weapons of ELITE. Offer them freedom, wealth, and the chance to exact their vengeance.
Utsumi: And what of their loyalty?

Gentoku (smirking): Loyalty? I‚Äôm not a fool, Utsumi. They‚Äôll be loyal only to their hatred. As long as that hatred burns, they‚Äôll follow the scent of blood straight to Build.

He picks up a pen from his desk, flipping it between his fingers with a thoughtful expression.

Gentoku: The Commonwealth is already teetering. Build is a symbol of hope for the people. Take that hope away, and what do they have left?

Utsumi (with a sly smile): Despair.

Gentoku: Exactly. And despair is the foundation of control.

There‚Äôs a brief pause before Gentoku straightens up, his commanding presence filling the room.

Gentoku: Begin the search. And remind them‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt charity. It‚Äôs a chance to settle the score, to make heroes pay for their lies.

Utsumi silently nods, turning to leave, his footsteps echoing as he exits the office. Gentoku returns to the window, looking out at the sprawling city below.

Gentoku (quietly, almost to himself): Flesh and blood, Build. That‚Äôs all you are. No powers, no miracles. You‚Äôre human. And humans‚Ä¶ always fall.

***Time Skip***

Sento rode the Machine Builder at full speed through the streets, his mind focused on the distress call he‚Äôd received moments earlier. A Smash attack had been reported near a downtown bank. That wasn‚Äôt unusual in itself, but the silence on his radio afterward had been unnerving. No backup, no updates. Just the hollow sound of static.

He slowed down as the bank came into view, his armored figure blending into the shadows. The building was eerily quiet. No visible signs of destruction, no fleeing civilians. Just stillness. He dismounted, stepping cautiously toward the entrance.

Sento (grim, focused): Something‚Äôs not right...

As he approached the shattered glass doors, a piercing scream erupted from inside, sending a chill down his spine. Without hesitation, he charged in, the headlights of his suit illuminating the dark interior.

And then it happened.
A bolt of lightning struck him square in the chest, sending him flying backward. He crashed into a marble pillar, the force rattling his body inside the armor. His vision blurred for a moment before refocusing on the figures stepping out from the shadows.

Livewire (smirking, voice cold and sharp): Look at that. The great Kamen Rider Build, already on the floor. Guess the rumors were true‚Äîyou do bleed.

Sento pushed himself up, clutching his 
side where the pain was already radiating.

Sento (gritting his teeth): Who the hell are you?

The group stepped into the light, their presence suffocating.

Livewire: Me? I‚Äôm Livewire. You know, just your average lightning enthusiast. The rest of us? Well, we‚Äôre your worst nightmare.

Rory (stepping forward, flamethrowers humming): My name‚Äôs Rory. Hope you‚Äôre fireproof, sweetheart.

Rough House (pounding his gauntleted fists together): They call me Rough House. And I don‚Äôt lose fights. Ever.

Mist (his form flickering as he adjusted his cloaking tech): Kyle Nimbus. But you can call me Mist. That is, if you can find me.

Silver Banshee (her voice distorted through her mask): Siobhan McDougal. You‚Äôll remember the name when you‚Äôre deaf from my screams.

Livewire (mockingly): And together, we‚Äôre... actually, we don‚Äôt need a name. We‚Äôre just here to kill you.

Sento‚Äôs heart raced as he assessed the situation. They were coordinated, armed, and clearly out for blood. But he wasn‚Äôt about to back down.

Sento (coldly): If you think I‚Äôm just going to lie down and die, you‚Äôve got another thing coming.

Livewire laughed, her voice echoing menacingly.

Livewire: Oh, we‚Äôre not expecting you to make it easy. But let me tell you something, Build. That suit of yours? It‚Äôs impressive. Strong. Durable. Practically indestructible.

She stepped closer, her expression darkening.

Livewire: But just like a bulletproof vest, it only stops the surface damage. Kinetic energy, though? That transfers right into you. Every hit, every blast‚Äîit stings. And oh boy, are we going to make it sting.

Before Sento could react, the group descended on him. Rory unleashed a torrent of flames, forcing him to leap out of the way. Mist disappeared, only to reappear behind him, delivering a powerful strike to his back. Rough House charged, his massive fists slamming into Sento and sending him crashing through a desk.

The pain was excruciating. His suit absorbed the brunt of the attacks, but every impact sent shockwaves through his body. He could feel his ribs protesting, his muscles screaming in agony. Blood trickled down his face inside the helmet, his breaths coming in ragged gasps.

Sento (to himself, pained): The suit... it‚Äôs flawless on the outside. No scratches, no dents. But inside... it‚Äôs killing me. Every hit feels like a sledgehammer. How long can I keep this up?

Silver Banshee stepped forward, her amplified scream shaking the room. Sento‚Äôs ears rang, his vision blurred, and he dropped to his knees.

Silver Banshee: Poor little Rider. Doesn‚Äôt look so invincible now, does he?
Sento struggled to rise, his hands trembling. He couldn‚Äôt give up. Not here. Not like this. But his body was failing him, the weight of their combined assault too much to bear.

Livewire (coldly, looking down at him): I‚Äôd almost feel sorry for you if this wasn‚Äôt so much fun.

She turned to the others, her tone casual.
Livewire: Should we see who‚Äôs under the mask?

Rory (grinning): I‚Äôm curious.

Mist: Boss said no.

Livewire (shrugging): Fair enough. Orders are orders.

As they laughed and taunted, Sento mustered every ounce of strength he had left. He couldn‚Äôt win, but he could escape. Slowly, painfully, he began to crawl, his body screaming in protest.

Sento (to himself, weakly): Was it worth it? To fight, to wear this suit, to die here? Did I deserve this life?

His vision swam, but a single thought kept him moving.

Sento (to himself): I need to know. I need to know who I am.

He reached the shattered doors, his blood smearing the floor behind him. The group hadn‚Äôt noticed his absence yet, too caught up in their victory.

Sento (weakly, collapsing outside): Not here. Not yet.

His will to survive was the only thing keeping him alive.

The Machine Builder roared to life, its tires spinning against the cracked asphalt as Sento barely managed to pull himself onto the seat. His vision blurred, blood trickling down his temple and staining the inside of his suit. He pressed a button on the bike‚Äôs hub, activating the auto-drive system.

Sento (weakly, to himself): Get me... back to the caf√©.

The bike sped off into the night, leaving behind the gang of ex-ELITE members, who watched in amusement as Build disappeared into the shadows.

Livewire (casual): Let him go. Boss has other plans for him anyway. Still feels like a win to me.

Rory (smirking): He‚Äôll bleed out before he even makes it back.

Silver Banshee: Pity. I was just starting to have fun.

Mist (calm, almost bored): Doesn‚Äôt matter. He won‚Äôt last long.

The group turned and began to leave the bank, their laughter echoing through the desolate halls.

The Machine Builder finally came to a stop behind the caf√©, its hum dying down as Sento slumped forward on the handlebars. His trembling hands reached up to undo the transformation, pressing the hidden button on the Build Driver. The suit dissolved into blue and red particles, revealing his battered form underneath.
His black button-up shirt and long trench coat were soaked in blood, the fabric clinging to his wounds. Every step he took toward the hidden wall felt like dragging a mountain. He placed a shaking hand on the specific panel embedded in the brick. A soft beep sounded, and the scanner recognized his print.

The wall slid open, revealing a narrow passage that led to the underground lab beneath the caf√©. He stumbled through, the wall sealing shut behind him.
Inside the lab, Banjou and Soichi were deep in discussion about politics, while Misora absentmindedly scrolled through her phone. Sawa leaned against a desk, sipping coffee. The hum of equipment filled the air, a comforting yet clinical sound.

Misora (without looking up): Welcome back‚Äî
She froze mid-sentence, her eyes widening in horror as she turned to see Sento standing in the doorway, pale and drenched in blood.

Misora (panicked): Oh my god, Sento!

The others turned sharply at her cry, their expressions shifting from confusion to alarm as they took in his battered form. Sento‚Äôs knees buckled, but he caught himself against the doorframe.bHis legs gave out completely, and he collapsed to the floor, his body limp.

Banjou (rushing to him): Sento! Damn it, stay with us!

Sawa knelt beside him, her voice trembling as she checked his pulse.

Sawa: He‚Äôs alive, but he‚Äôs lost a lot of blood.

Soichi (firm, trying to stay calm): Get the med kit. Now.

Misora dropped her phone, rushing to Sento‚Äôs side, tears brimming in her eyes.

Misora (desperately): Sento, wake up! You‚Äôre not dying, you hear me? You can‚Äôt die!

Banjou grabbed the med kit from a nearby shelf, handing it to Sawa, who began working on stabilizing Sento‚Äôs wounds.

Banjou (angrily): What the hell happened to him? Who did this?

Soichi (grimly): Whoever it was, they didn‚Äôt hold back.

Misora (tearfully): He looked... so broken. He never looks like that.

Sawa (focused): He‚Äôs not dead, but he fainted from blood loss. We need to get fluids in him, clean these wounds, and pray he doesn‚Äôt have internal bleeding.
As they worked frantically, Soichi glanced at the fainted Sento, his expression a mixture of guilt and determination.

Soichi (to himself): You‚Äôve been carrying too much, haven‚Äôt you?

Misora gently brushed a strand of hair from Sento‚Äôs bloodied face, her voice breaking as she spoke.

Misora: You‚Äôre always so strong, so stubborn. You can‚Äôt leave us now.

Banjou placed a hand on Misora‚Äôs shoulder, his own expression softening despite his anger.

Banjou: He‚Äôs not going anywhere. He‚Äôs too damn stubborn to give up.

The room fell silent for a moment, the hum of the equipment the only sound as they worked to save their friend. And though Sento‚Äôs body lay still, his mind clung to a single, desperate thought.

Sento (to himself, faintly): I still need to find out... who I really am.

Sento drifted through the endless void of unconsciousness. His body, broken and exhausted, lay still in the underground lab, wrapped in bandages, his breathing shallow.

Then‚Äîsomething stirred in the darkness. A flicker of color.

Laughter.

Two small children, a boy and a girl, playing in a sunlit field. The girl, with an oversized cape, held a toy sword, declaring herself the hero.
The boy, with a mischievous grin, wore a makeshift mask, proclaiming himself the villain.

Boy (excited): You‚Äôll never defeat me, Hero!

Girl (confident): Watch me! Heroes always win!

She tackled him, both of them tumbling onto the grass, giggling.

Boy (laughing): Okay, okay, you win!

Racheal (grinning): See? Told you!

They lay side by side, staring at the sky, their hands brushing against each other. A quiet, unspoken understanding between them.

They really loved each other.

The memory blurred, slipping away like sand through his fingers.

Sento‚Äôs eyes twitched. His fingers curled slightly against the sheets.

But he did not wake up.

Misora sat beside his bed, resting her chin on her arms as she watched Sento sleep. His face was peaceful, but the deep lines of exhaustion never faded. The bandages wrapped tightly around his torso, the bruises peeking from beneath them, were a stark reminder of what he had been through.

Banjou stood nearby, arms crossed, shifting uncomfortably.

Banjou: He really scared us this time.

Misora (softly): He always does.
She reached out, brushing her fingers against Sento‚Äôs wrist, feeling the faint warmth of his skin.

Misora (quietly, almost to herself): No matter how much he burdens himself‚Ä¶ in the end, he‚Äôs still just a kid. A boy with a dream.

Her voice wavered slightly.

Misora: He pushes himself too much.

Banjou glanced at her, noting the rare sadness in her expression.

Banjou: Yeah. But that‚Äôs Sento. Even if it kills him, he won‚Äôt stop.

Misora (bitter smile): That‚Äôs what scares me the most.

She leaned back in the chair, staring at the ceiling.

Misora (softly): He has no family. No past. All he has is us.

The words lingered in the air, heavy with meaning.

Banjou shifted his stance, rubbing the back of his neck.

Banjou: ...We‚Äôll just have to be enough, then.

Misora smiled faintly but said nothing.
Slowly, the topic shifted.

Banjou: So‚Ä¶ to turn a Smash back into a human, you defeat it, retrieve its essence, and bottle it up, right?

Misora nodded.

Misora: Once the essence is bottled, it can be purified in the conversion equipment. That‚Äôs how Sento uses it.

Banjou raised an eyebrow.

Banjou: And you‚Äôre the only one who can purify it.

Misora (quietly): Yeah.
She fidgeted slightly, looking down at her hands.

Misora: It‚Äôs some kind of power I have‚Ä¶ something I was born with.

Banjou: That‚Äôs kinda crazy.

Misora (soft laugh): Tell me about it.
She twirled a strand of her hair between her fingers.

Misora: I used to feel weirded out because of it. People at school thought I was strange. Called me the weird girl.

Banjou: Kids are assholes.

Misora laughed again, a bit more genuine this time.

Misora: Yeah‚Ä¶ but Sento never made me feel that way. He was the only one who didn‚Äôt look at me like I was different.

She exhaled softly.

Misora: Two people with a burden, I guess.

A silence settled between them. The quiet hum of the medical monitors was the only sound.

Banjou (muttering): Yeah‚Ä¶ sounds like him.

Misora looked at Sento again, watching his slow, steady breathing.

Misora (softly): Wake up soon, okay? You‚Äôre not alone. Not anymore.

I‚Äôve been seeing some media content lately that has been making me reflect. I‚Äôm pregnant with my second after having previously been a fencesitter for a decade. 

I saw one woman make a video saying she had always dreamed of being a mom and now that she has a baby she simply does not think it‚Äôs worth it. I‚Äôm not going to invalidate her experience, but I will say if you asked me if it was worth it when my baby was her baby‚Äôs age I would‚Äôve said yes but given you horror stories about how hard it was.

Now that my daughter is nearly 4 I could go on for days about how becoming a mother is one of the best things I‚Äôve ever done. I think a lot of the anti-child accounts are from parents who are in the thick of it with young kids (I know not all). Dealing with absolute exhaustion, overpriced childcare, lack of alone/hobby time since their kid still requires around the clock attention and absolutely no breaks from it all now that our culture has moved away from communal child raising. It‚Äôs not fun. It *is* grueling, but it doesn‚Äôt last forever barring extenuating circumstances.

I went to visit a family member last year who is further along their journey in parenthood than I am. She has 2 teens. One 18 year old and one 16 year old. We stayed for a week and at the time I had a 2 year old. I was bone tired. I couldn‚Äôt sit down following my toddler around as she had fun accessing all the non-childproof spaces. I was kept up at night because my toddler wasn‚Äôt sleeping well with all the travel and change in schedule. I looked like a zombie. My family member though? She was glowing the entire time. Fit, polished, happy. 

She‚Äôd wake in the morning and do her workouts in the living room. After that she‚Äôd take a leisurely shower, curl her hair and ask what we‚Äôre doing for the day. She‚Äôd talk about her favorite current shows and what books she recommended and how her group of girlfriends are doing. She was excited for an interview coming up because she took off a year of work and was ready to get back into it. The night we were leaving she was packing her suitcases because she was taking a weekend trip to go to her favorite workout guru‚Äôs retreat in another state. Her teenagers? We got to see them for dinner mostly. We went shopping with her older one for dorm supplies. Besides that she was hanging out with her boyfriend and going to her part time job that she drove herself to. Her younger one had a busy week with her student government position, soccer and studying. She also was packing to go to a conference (by herself!) where she‚Äôd meet up with other student government bodies in another state to represent her school. Her and her mom were excitedly planning her birthday and the theme they wanted. Their dad was around too, working and helping neighbors with some house repairs. Grilling us dinner.

It was incredible to see everyone living their own lives, because online all you see being portrayed is motherhood being a lifetime of servitude and how your kids probably won‚Äôt move out till late so you won‚Äôt have your lives back until then. I finally got to see that wasn‚Äôt true and it was such a relief to see a mom living her best life as well as the rest of her family.

It also scared me because my daughter is nearly 4 so does that mean I only have 12 years left before she‚Äôs busy doing her own thing? üò≥ That seems so fast, especially considering next year she‚Äôll already be in full time school.

Regardless I can see how that happens. Just 1.5 years ago she was 2 and a handful. Waking up multiple times a night, speech delay so I couldn‚Äôt have full conversations with her, not potty trained, couldn‚Äôt sit still/quietly when we‚Äôd go out in public, couldn‚Äôt entertain herself for more than 15 minutes or be left unsupervised. I felt stressed, overwhelmed, desperate to take care of myself.

Now it‚Äôs not even 2 years later and she‚Äôs 3.5. She is potty trained, sleeps well (not perfectly but I‚Äôm not sleep deprived anymore), is caught up on her speech so I can rationally talk to her now, behaves well in public and is a dream to take on trips, and gets lost in her imaginary worlds and can play by herself for an hour+ at a time. She‚Äôs old enough to go on adventures with my husband too. He takes her running, swimming, to the park, to the zoo, to get ice cream, he‚Äôs teaching her about science (his passion), etc. all things that were difficult to do even last year whether it was down to her behavior or that she simply needed a nap. I can read a book and tell her to go play. I can sit with a cup of coffee and ask her to be quiet while I catch up on my favorite podcast. She doesn‚Äôt need to be supervised if she goes into another room anymore either. 

She‚Äôs not even 4 yet and I am genuinely enjoy parenting (hence the second baby). I‚Äôm not saying that I don‚Äôt still have days that I struggle. That I‚Äôm exhausted. That I don‚Äôt want to entertain her and simply want to be left alone and recharge. Those still happen, but it‚Äôs not a constant anymore. I have more joy than suffering now. 

So please just keep the long term in mind when considering your stance on the fence. The first couple years are grueling I am not going to lie to you. There‚Äôs many days that are not fun and you‚Äôll wonder when it‚Äôs going to be easier. But the infant and toddler years are not reflective of the parenting experience as a whole. I‚Äôm not saying you shouldn‚Äôt be childfree (perhaps you should) but don‚Äôt let people‚Äôs accounts of how much it can suck to have a little kid scare you off from considering the bigger picture. The lifelong bond you can have with your child(ren).

Best of luck making your decision ü´° I know it‚Äôs not easy. ",30,1738673940.0,Fencesitter,16,0.84,False

I (30F) work in the film industry and met this man (56M) last September, in a meeting for a project we now work on together (started a month ago and production will continue for another month). We‚Äôre in different departments, so there's no weird power dynamic thing involved here ; he‚Äôs very nice and easy going (also good-looking and in good shape, which helps!), and I know for sure he's single with no kids.

When we first met, a few months before production started, I thought he looked great from the start, and we chatted a little at each meeting, and we started to follow each other on social media not too long after (I added him first). At first, he was simply watching my stories (normal), but in December, he started reacting to some with emojis and hearts (not just liking them but replying in DMs). Then, a few days before New Year‚Äôs, he replied to a story, wishing me Happy New Year, two days in advance, and when I replied, asking if he had any resolutions for 2025, he proceeded to tell me, among other things, that he was hoping to find love this year. As my roommate told me, either he said that because he‚Äôs into me and wanted it to be known he‚Äôs single, or he‚Äôs just weird ! üòÖ I was so shocked, it took me hours to reply, and I think my answer was a little too proper, though I told him I was open to meeting new people and have fun as well (he said that was perfect, haha).

We then started to work together four weeks ago, and we‚Äôve been talking almost every day, though I don‚Äôt need to be talking to him to do my job, and vice versa. He‚Äôs very focused on his work, which I find attractive, so he doesn‚Äôt come by my office for no reason, but he passes by every morning and when he leaves, always greeting me with a big smile, sometimes taking a few minutes to chat ; otherwise we get to talk when we meet at the coffee machine, or in the open area, and he always looks me in the eyes when we do. I had to go see him for work stuff a few times though and, on some instances, hands briefly touched, legs/knees too, and no one was in a hurry to move‚Ä¶ We started texting a little too, for work at first (he had to pay me back for lunch orders), and I‚Äôve tried to keep it fun, not overly flirty, since I don‚Äôt want to be too forward and risk ruining the vibe, when we still have to work together until March. Then, last weekend, I asked recommendations for outdoor activities, and he replied with a voice note, which I think is somewhat more intimate than texting, or is it just me ? He also uses a lot of emojis, a lot of hearts (blue though), etc. when replying to my texts or stories.

The thing is, with that kind of age-gap, I know that we have different codes when it comes to social media, texting, voice notes, etc. And I‚Äôm not used to get that kind of attention from men (plus I don't have much dating experience), so I have a hard time sizing him up, since he seems to be good-natured in general (though I‚Äôm pretty sure he doesn‚Äôt act this way with the other women at work).

With all that said, with that information, do you guys think he might actually be into me, or is he just being nice ? Figures he probably likes me, but I can't figure out if it's as friends or more.

If he‚Äôs interested, my friends all agree that he will not make the first move, because of the age difference, so I guess that‚Äôs on me ? I would really want to go out with him, at least for a drink, to see what the conversation is like outside work and face to face, but it's not something I would usually do, fearing rejection and all. I guess, if I find the guts to do it, I better wait until the end of production, to avoid making things awkward between us at work...

I can‚Äôt describe it very well but whenever I‚Äôm near the steam or above (i guess when slightly inhaling the steam) I get really tired because it feels like my lungs have become heavy and bigger and can‚Äôt get enough oxygen. Currently 20 minutes after I cooked and I still feel really tired. 

When I brought this up to my mom she mentioned something about me having a ‚Äúweak heart‚Äù but she could be lying because it‚Äôs her who forces me  to cook every single day. 

However It does seem plausible because 1. Sometimes when experiencing emotions my heart also races almost out of my chest and it‚Äôs hard to keep it down. 2. My heart easily races and I easily become jittery whenever I have a bit of caffeine in my system such as coffee or even tea. 3. I also have an irregular heart rate as once for a checkup the nurse who was taking my heart rate (with that finger clipping device) asked me are you holding your breath?

Struggling to get more customers and close sales? It‚Äôs not just you‚Äîthe old linear sales funnel is out, and the **‚ÄúMessy Middle‚Äù** is in. Here‚Äôs what it looks like:

1. **Exploration:** Customers search and discover options.
2. **Evaluation:** They compare, read reviews, and weigh their choices.
3. **Trigger:** A discount, review, or ad nudges them to act.

# 3 Simple Steps to Win in the Messy Middle

1. **Be Discoverable:** Post valuable content (social media, blogs, ads) where your audience hangs out.
2. **Build Trust:** Highlight reviews, testimonials, and customer stories.
3. **Use Triggers:** Offer limited-time deals, free trials, or first-time discounts.

# Quick Case Study: Amanda‚Äôs Coffee Shop

Amanda ran a caf√© in a crowded market and struggled to stand out. She:

* Posted fun Instagram latte art reels (exploration).
* Highlighted glowing customer reviews (evaluation).
* Launched a ‚ÄúBuy One, Get One Free‚Äù offer for new visitors (trigger).

**Result?** A 35% boost in first-time customers in one month!

# Take Action Now

* Make your website mobile-friendly.
* Track conversion and retention rates.
* Build relationships, not just transactions (email follow-ups, VIP discounts).

I recently shared my thoughts on the Ratio Four coffee maker. I'm currently using an OXO Brew Conical Burr Grinder with it, grinding light roast single origins. 

I'm encountering a couple of issues with the OXO: some grounds always get stuck after grinding and fall out later, and I also see a layer of fines on top of the ground coffee in the container.

Since many of you are experienced with grinders for manual pour-overs, I'd love your recommendations for a grinder best suited for a drip-style machine like the Ratio Four.

I told my now wife she could bring her cat to our first apartment) and it has been the most irritating animal in my life. It will wake us up at 2am, 4am, I cannot have a peaceful morning and relax and meditate or make some coffee and map out my day without incessant yowling for attention that the cat then walks away while attempting to give it attention. We will leave sometimes for a weekend and I find the cat has peed on my clothes, or other places in the house. Just this weekend I forgot something last minute and left the office door unlocked which is where our dog has his bed (we brought our dog with us on the weekend trip) and we come home at 1:30am after a 6 hour drive and find the cat has peed on my sweater I left in the office, and peed in multiple places all over the dogs bed, the entire office reeks of cat pee. But somehow because I forgot to close the office door it's my fault and I should have known better according to my partner...? I told her whether I leave the door locked or open it won't matter because the cat will start peeing on our couch or other places, just like he has done before (went into the closet to pee on clothes, peed on a new cat bed we got him before, the list goes on) but she doesn't believe me and talks to me like I should have known better.

The cat has a litter box, and has done stuff like this before. I'm just about met my boiling point with this animal and it has consistently made my life worse, messed up my routine, my sleep, has brought zero benefit or joy to my life, and I have tolerated it for years because I love my partner but I genuinely have wanted to get rid of this cat for years and think I am actually starting to hit my boiling point and beginning to resent my partner.

TLDR; wifes cat pees on stuff when away all the time, incessantly meows/yowls in the mornings for attention that it walks away from, yowls at night at 2am, 4am, etc and has disrupted my schedule for years and caused nothing but stress and irritation and now beginning to genuinely resent my partner because I feel trapped ",1,1738672929.0,relationships,5,1.0,False

Local search engine optimisation (SEO) is essential for businesses that want to reach customers from their nearby areas in the modern digital market. Local SEO initiatives businesses apply help them reach better visibility, which leads to increased revenue and foot traffic because search engines are now the main tools for finding local services. The following guide examines fundamental methods for boosting your local search position, which distinguishes your business in search engine results.

# 1. Optimize Your Google Business Profile

A local SEO core tool emerged, Google Business Profile, which used to be known as [**Google My Business**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pmNaKfYYTrBJmxn99). A profile optimised for local search will help your business appear in regional result listings and Google Maps. To optimise your profile:

* Your listing must contain every essential business element, from your business name to your address, phone number (NAP), website, and operating hours.
* Utilise defined business categories and attributes that precisely represent your company's information.
* Add high-resolution business photos to your profile, including pictures of the exterior and interior and product images.
* Also, ask contented customers to create review feedback, which you will promptly review.
* Your profile needs regular updates about business-related posts, offers, and events to maintain activity and audience participation.
* The Q&A feature lets you answer regular customer questions within your business profile.

Implementing a completely optimised Google Business Profile adds value to your local search rankings and enables better trust relationships and increased customer engagement.

# 2. Optimize for Local Keywords

Your local SEO campaign will not succeed without proper keyword research. To identify relevant local keywords, you can use [**Keyword Research Tools**](https://awebstar.com.sg/seo/keyword-research-tools.html) like:

* You can use Google Keyword Planner Ahrefs or SEMrush as software to identify place-specific search terms.
* Your target keywords should contain specific location identification terms such as ""best coffee shop in Singapore.""
* Insert search terms with three to four words that show user objectives and describe your specific business offerings.
* When researching competitors' websites and Google search suggestions, professionals discover new keyword opportunities for usage.
* Your website content meta tags and headings should naturally include local keywords together with URLs.

Your content optimisation with local key phrases improves your search engine position when users search for location-specific terms.

# 3. Ensure NAP Consistency Across Listings

https://preview.redd.it/dsgtyik4a4he1.png?width=782&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f90e82f33656201d13706c264a9f45e13bd3aa0

Your business name, address, and phone number (NAP) must be consistent across all online platforms, including directories, social media, and your website. Inconsistent information can confuse search engines and potential customers, leading to lower search rankings. To ensure consistency:

* Use the same format for your NAP on all platforms.
* Regularly audit your online listings to correct any discrepancies.
* Update your business details immediately if any changes occur.

Maintaining uniformity in business information strengthens credibility and improves search visibility.

# 4. Leverage Local Citations and Directories

Listing your business on high-authority directories increases credibility and improves local SEO. Some top directories include:

* Google Business Profile
* Yelp
* Bing Places
* Facebook Business
* Yellow Pages
* TripAdvisor (for hospitality businesses)

**To maximise benefits:**

* Ensure that your information is accurate and regularly updated.
* Add relevant keywords to your business description.
* Include high-quality images and customer reviews.

Getting listed on multiple directories helps search engines validate your business information, leading to better rankings.

# 5. Encourage Customer Reviews and Respond Promptly

https://preview.redd.it/tcmaxit6a4he1.png?width=662&format=png&auto=webp&s=acc6213c6b41b72a1749b9c5d640e7858dd76da9

Customer reviews play a crucial role in local search rankings and consumer trust. Positive reviews not only improve visibility but also influence purchasing decisions. To get more reviews:

* Ask satisfied customers to leave reviews on Google, Yelp, and Facebook.
* Offer incentives, such as discounts or exclusive deals, for honest reviews.
* Respond to all reviews promptly, thanking customers for their feedback.
* Address negative reviews professionally and offer solutions to resolve complaints.
* Share positive reviews on your website and social media to build credibility.

Engaging with customer feedback helps foster a strong reputation and improves your local SEO performance.

# 6. Optimize Your Website for Local SEO

Your website should be optimised to target local customers effectively. Key aspects include:

* Creating location-specific landing pages for different service areas.
* Embedding Google Maps on your contact page.
* Adding schema markup to help search engines understand your business details.
* Ensuring mobile-friendliness for a seamless user experience.
* Improving site speed and performance to enhance user engagement.

An optimised website enhances user experience and signals relevance to search engines.

# 7. Build Local Backlinks

Backlinks from reputable local websites signal authority to search engines. Strategies to build local backlinks include:

* Partnering with local influencers or bloggers.
* Guest posting on local business websites.
* Sponsoring community events or charities.
* Getting listed in industry-specific directories.
* Reaching out to local news outlets for coverage.

Earning quality backlinks boosts your website‚Äôs authority and improves local search rankings.

# 8. Utilize Social Media for Local Engagement

https://preview.redd.it/115scam8a4he1.png?width=674&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9c3cdb4439f88bbc96e9ad654738c2a928bfa57

Social media platforms can enhance your local presence by engaging with your community. To maximise effectiveness:

* Share local news, events, and promotions.
* Use location-based hashtags and geotags.
* Encourage user-generated content and customer testimonials.
* Engage with followers through comments and messages.
* Collaborate with local businesses for cross-promotion.

Social media engagement helps build brand awareness and attracts more local customers.

# 9. Implement Local Schema Markup

Schema markup helps search engines understand your business better. Adding local business schema to your website can enhance rich snippets, increasing your chances of appearing in local search results with additional details like ratings and operating hours.

* Use [**schema.org**](http://schema.org) markup to highlight essential business details.
* Implement structured data for reviews, business hours, and contact information.
* Test your schema implementation using Google‚Äôs Rich Results Test tool.

Proper schema markup improves search engine comprehension and enhances visibility.

# 10. Monitor and Adjust Your Local SEO Strategy

SEO is an ongoing process. Regularly monitor your performance using tools like:

* Google Search Console for website performance insights.
* Google Analytics to track visitor behaviour and traffic sources.
* Google Business Profile Insights to analyse customer interactions.
* Rank tracking tools like Moz, Ahrefs, or SEMrush to measure keyword rankings.

Adjust your strategy based on performance data, customer feedback, and evolving SEO trends to maintain competitiveness.

# Conclusion

The strategy of Local SEO functions as a strong method to boost company exposure and draw regional consumer traffic. As the [**Best SEO Company**](https://awebstar.com.sg/seo-services-singapore.html), leveraging Google Business Profile optimisation, local keyword focus, regular NAP consistency maintenance, and local directory incorporation enables businesses to build a more substantial online impact. Combining customer review interaction and social media engagement enhances credibility and trust. Follow these local search strategies while monitoring outcomes to avoid stumbling backwards in your position and to achieve increased business expansion.

The continuous improvement of your local SEO strategies enables your digital business to create a more substantial online footprint, which attracts neighbourhood customers and generates successful business growth in today's highly competitive market.",1,1738672599.0,awebstar,0,1.0,False

I know this might be a broad question, but I‚Äôm trying to break it down into a process I can replicate in other places. For now, I‚Äôm using Illinois, specifically Chicago, as an example to focus on how to supply Araku green coffee beans to roasters and caf√©s. I‚Äôm fortunate enough to have direct connections with farmers in Araku, ensuring the beans are sourced straight from the farms, offering exceptional quality and a unique flavor profile.

Here are a few areas I‚Äôd love advice on:

	1.	Finding Buyers:
	A) How do I connect with roasters and caf√© owners?
	B) Is digital marketing (social media, ads, SEO) enough, or should I focus on trade shows, networking events, or direct outreach?

	2.	Standing Out:
	A) Who are my competitors in Chicago, and what sets successful sellers apart?
	B) How can I position Araku beans (unique origin, flavor profile, direct farm sourcing) to appeal to buyers?

	3.	Costs & Logistics:
	A) Other than sourcing and shipping, what key costs should I consider (storage, packaging, sampling, certifications, insurance, etc.)?
	B) How can I create a clear balance sheet to track profitability?
	C) How do I figure out what price buyers in Chicago are expecting for green beans? Are there market standards or ways to benchmark pricing against competitors?

	4. Certifications & Permissions:
	A) What certifications (USDA Organic, Fair Trade, etc.) or permissions are necessary for selling green beans in the U.S.?

	B) Should I consider offering free samples, partnering with local roasters, or attending coffee trade events?


Since Chicago is just an example, I‚Äôd like to ensure this approach is scalable and can be adapted to other cities and states. Any advice, tips, or resources would be greatly appreciated!

1ihgk91,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ihgk91/am_i_overthinking_this_mixed_signals/,Am I overthinking this? Mixed signals.,"I will try to keep this as breif as I can. We are both in our early 30s and have worked together for close to a year. I have very little experience dating because I was sick for the majority of my 20s, and it left me very isolated. Prior to that I was in a 5 year abusive relationship, so I'm not sure what is normal and what is not. 

He was flirting with me hard for months, and I him, but he never asked for my number. About a month ago I got tired of wondering and asked for his. We talked for 7 hours that day, and have been in near constant communication since. We see eachother approx every other day for a few hours at a time. He is empathetic, communicative (sort of), and physically affectionate when we are together. I love watching him work with clients and hearing him talk about his passions. He is not a bad man. 

However, subtle behaviors make me question if im wasting my time here or not. I don't expect to be a priority, especially not this early in the game, but i don't want to be used either. For one, everything is transactional. If he brings me a coffee, I buy dinner. Stuff like that. Last week was my birthday, and he didn't remember. I didn't take it personally because it's not his job to remember, but he made a big show over the price of tickets and when I offered to cover snacks, he asked for gas money instead. I told him I'd cover both. He then argued with the teller about ticket prices, made a show of checking his bank account, and still declined when I offered to pay again. Fine, whatever. He learned a while later that it was my birthday that day, he seemed apologetic, but I still covered dinner for us after the movie. Idk, it left a bad taste in my mouth. 

(As a disclaimer, I do know we all struggle with money. But there are indicators that lead me to believe things aren't THAT bad for him. He just doesn't seem very inclined to spend anything on me, at least not knowing he will get something back of monetary value.)

He is very last minute. I hate to admit I spend more time than I should holding off on doing something in case he wants to get together that evening. He often does, but it's on his schedule. Again, that's fine. He's busier than me. 

Yesterday he told me he was free today. I asked if he would like to grab dinner. He gave a very pointed ""maybe.""

He doesn't put much effort into appearance, which doesn't bother me at all, but I put a lot of effort into mine and it feels slightly off-putting that he shows up in slippers and sweatpants all the time. 

Again, I don't want to expect too much, but I also don't want to be fucked around with. He is a kind and communicative person and don't want to give the wrong impression. Maybe I am actually expecting too much. 

He's made it clear he isn't seeing other people, and I believe him (although I would never dream of having ""that talk"" at this point the game, either. I'm not asking for exclusivity, just honesty). He tells me where he is most of the time (without me asking) and touches base through the day over text. 

Any advice on this would be appreciated. Sorry this is so long, I don't have anywhere else to turn for advice. ",1,1738672240.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

She‚Äôs always been overweight but recently she‚Äôs even more than usual and she complains about it a lot.

When she complains about it, firstly I don‚Äôt say the typical fake cliche things as ‚Äúyour body is beautiful any size‚Äù etc because as a woman unfortunately we‚Äôre just treated better AND feel better when we‚Äôre smaller. I just give her advice. I ask her how are her eating or exercise habits during the day, and how to minimize or increase that, and a clear explanation of calorie deficit.

She takes my advice and the weeks go by and I see her stories on social media of pictures at these chain restaurants with fatty high calorie food. Like every day. And she also takes pictures of her coffees which are loaded with sugar and creamer. So I‚Äôm like, okay where is the effort? I‚Äôm constantly giving you advice and comforting you but you don‚Äôt make an effort and you go back to complaining. It‚Äôs a cycle.

It makes me mad because I want her to do it for her physical and mental health but I don‚Äôt want to nitpick her stories and comment ‚Äúwow that‚Äôs not healthy for you‚Äù bc I don‚Äôt want to trigger an eating disorder or anything.

1ihgh1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/1ihgh1l/feel_like_giving_up/,Feel like giving up,"Just need some love. I worked from home for the last 10 years but was forced to return to in-person work after a layoff, and then had to get a new job quick. I am a single parent to a wonderful teen (I also do have a loving partner but we‚Äôve been together under a year so, not at the move-in phase yet) and have three big, sweet, messy dogs.

I have only been working this new job about 3 weeks. They have documentation of both my ADHD and Autism and, per the ADA, I have requested some reasonable accommodations, which they have granted after some negotiation. (It‚Äôs a newer position at a small but fast-growing company so, we‚Äôre all learning together.) I can WFH Friday, and they gave me a solo office at work versus a cubicle, which I appreciate. 

They‚Äôre also not being too hard on me about in-office scheduling in as much as it seems like I can just say, I need to work from home for a bit, or take a longer break, and they‚Äôre decently nice about it.

But it‚Äôs still stressful, since I can never tell how sincere someone is or isn‚Äôt being, so despite how proud of myself I am for requesting the accommodations and having been granted them, I still feel like I haven‚Äôt asked for everything I really need. No matter how supportive my new boss‚Äôs words are (she shared with me she is diagnosed ADHD and we have a lot in common) I can‚Äôt bring myself to know when or if it‚Äôs okay to ask for more WFH time, or to leave the office to return to my home office as-needed, etc. 

Every day I have had had to go into work has been so hard. It‚Äôs just another sensory experience to manage on top of the ones I deal with every day already.

Since starting this new job, my drinking has increased a lot. Not like sick-and-stumbling drunk, but 1-2 beers every few days, for fun, has become 2-4 pretty much every night, up to 6-7 spread over about the same number of hours. So, I‚Äôm careful and lucid and all, but I feel like shit the next day. So I do my day feeling like shit, and then what do I want at the end of it? And I have almost no restraint, because this situation has me so depressed that I feel like I just don‚Äôt care about myself or my body and I have this quiet voice deep in my mind that wants me to believe that, if I destroy my body, then I can be relieved of this. 

The worst part is how stupid it makes me feel.

It‚Äôs nothing. It‚Äôs going to work. That‚Äôs it.

But no one understands how hard it is to follow the steps every morning of:

- Wake up
- Take meds, make caffeine (I use a water enhancer with caffeine, not coffee, but sometimes just being half-awake trying to find clean cups and stuff is stressful)
- Wake up teen (and remain available to support her if needed, making sure she wakes up on time, has some breakfast etc., as she is also ADHD‚Äîit‚Äôs well-managed and she is very easy in the mornings and pretty independent, but, as her mother, her feeling supported by me is a priority, so I am emotionally ‚Äúon‚Äù while she‚Äôs getting ready each morning)
- Pack teen a quick lunch, make her a quick breakfast, fill her water bottle (these are responsibilities she is taking over one-by-one; currently she is responsible for taking her own meds in the morning which is newer for her so I‚Äôve been giving her time to master that and make it routine)
- Get my own clothes, get dressed (sensory nightmare, especially in the mornings) 
- Do my hair/makeup
- I haven‚Äôt been bothering brushing my teeth because my brain is forcing me to let go of one thing and I guess it‚Äôs that)
- Put my computer in my bag
- Wrestle with whether or not I will eat breakfast (food in the mornings before going to work, for me, is a whole freaking thing)
- Turn the car on to warm it up (winter)
- Make sure I have all my stuff and anything the kid isn‚Äôt charged with managing yet (so her water bottle and lunch and breakfast, as I said)
- Feed the dogs
- Give one dog his medicine and ear drops 
- Make sure there‚Äôs nothing for the other dog to chew up while I‚Äôm gone
- Get my phone and check, again, that I have everything 
- Take kid to school
- Go into the office and start masking, or, if I‚Äôm in my own office there, just being hyper-freaking-aware that I am different, every hour on the hour, so I can‚Äôt get my work done as quickly as I want and end up pleasure-seeking through procrastination and feeling stupid and guilty and uncomfortable in my clothes because I can‚Äôt wear leggings there and I basically live in leggings 
- Watching the clock from the time I wake up to the time I have to get the kid out the door is also always hard, because I‚Äôm going from activity to activity to activity (transitions) 

Seriously, it feels like no one understands how much of a cognitive load that is, all before 8am. 

Previously, all I had to focus on was the kid and dogs. Nothing else. Then, I come home, and just‚Ä¶work. And kick ass at what I do.

I feel like I am getting more and more depressed. I‚Äôm hurting.

I have already applied to more remote jobs but do not have high hopes. 

And I hate that even with accommodations, this is just so hard for me. I do not understand why I need to be in the office if not for a meeting? What‚Äôs the damn point?

This morning I am just going to work from home (told them the kid was sick) and then go in later, because it‚Äôs already 7:20 and I still haven‚Äôt cleaned up or gotten dressed, I didn‚Äôt bathe yesterday even though I cleaned and sweated, because my dog had an accident and he needed a bath and I needed to clean my floors‚Ä¶

This life is just too much sometimes. It‚Äôs too, too much. I feel like I can‚Äôt handle it all. All normal things. I can‚Äôt handle normal things that most others don‚Äôt blink twice at.

And I haven‚Äôt been able to afford to see my therapist since the layoff, and I need her to vent to.

This job also pays less than my last one so money is an issue and I‚Äôm scared of running out. I can‚Äôt afford insurance either and may have to quit my ADHD meds because even if I can find the generic, it‚Äôs $175/month.

I‚Äôm just so sad and feel so defeated, but I need to keep a happy face on for my daughter, and demonstrate confidence, and do my best.

I‚Äôve been dealing with a really strange issue and I‚Äôm wondering if it could be some kind of food allergy. The reaction isn‚Äôt triggered by eating the food but just by smelling it. The main culprits seem to be:
	‚Ä¢	The smell of various baked goods, especially sandwiches
	‚Ä¢	Freshly baked pretzels
	‚Ä¢	The scent of cooked coffee 
cheap coffee
	‚Ä¢	Tomatoes (the smell alone is irritating)
	‚Ä¢	Many other foods as well

When I‚Äôm exposed to these ‚Äûsmells‚Äú (it‚Äôs more like the when breathing in the particles), my saliva changes‚Äîit becomes thick and sticky instead of fluid and wet, which makes my mouth feel oddly dry. At the same time, my face starts burning and feels dry and tight.

The burning lasts for around 1-2 hours. I always wash my face, change clothes and brush my mouth many times when that happens.

I‚Äôve never heard of an allergy that works this way, but it‚Äôs affecting my life significantly. I‚Äôve had to stop going to caf√©s, bakeries, and cafeterias because just being around these foods causes symptoms.

Does this sound like it could be a form of food allergy? Has anyone experienced something similar? I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice or insights!

I live 25 minutes from my mom so not we're not too far from each other. During the week I'm in school and on the weekends I work. I make sure to take a couple of hours to meet mom for a late lunch or a coffee or something. But that's not what this is about.

My dad died when I was 7 and it was me and mom until I moved out. A few months before I moved out she had started dating a guy called Brad. I met him, I met his kids and they were fine. They moved in about three months ago and now my mom and Brad are engaged. Brad's parents moved to live close to their son and grandkids so they're a few houses away from my mom and I met them twice.

I don't have a whole lot to do with Brad or his kids. I have been asked to babysit a few times and I always said no because I had other plans. My mom seemed okay with that. Though she has mentioned a few times that she'd love for me to spend more time with them and stuff. I do see them occasionally but nowhere near as much as I see my mom.

My mom's birthday was the other weekend and she had a small party at her house to celebrate. I was there and I interacted with everyone just fine. But my focus was on mom.

During the party she and Brad left the house for a few to pick up her gift. Brad's dad was with the kids and his mom approached me. She told me the kids had been looking forward to spending time with me and instead I was interacting with others more and focused only on mom. This was the second time I met this woman. She told me Brad had hoped he'd get to spend some time with me as well. She said it looked like I was only interesting in maintaining a relationship with mom and not on building my family. I asked her what business it was of hers and she told me her family are the ones involved. She said my grandparents had set a bad precedent by not claiming Brad's kids as honorary grandkids and embracing the fact mom had moved on from dad. This woman told me I should be doing more though. That if I love my mom I will love her family and accept them into my family.

I moved away from her so there wouldn't be a fight or anything and once mom and Brad were back she didn't try to approach me again.

I didn't say anything to mom and we went for lunch the week after. But after our lunch Brad's mom texted me (she got my number from my mom or Brad) and she scolded me or whatever you'd call it, for meeting with mom for time but not organizing something for us all to do and spending the time I spend with her with mom's family. She said it could be as easy as going to mom's house and being a part of the family and being the big brother to the kids.

I told my mom about the stuff Brad's mom had said. Brad came in as we were talking and he said he'd speak to them but that he would love if I was more involved. He said he'd love to be a father figure to me and to have a kid as good as me have some kind of sibling-type relationship with his kids. He said not to babysit but even to hang out so they can say they have an older brother. My mom said she was sorry about the stuff Brad's mom had done and she asked me how I felt about maybe being a big brother. I told her I'd see what happens with Brad and his kids but I wasn't planning to sign up for being an older brother. I told her they'd probably seem more like cousins to me.

She was upset. Then Brad's mom texted again (and I quickly blocked her). She asked why I had to go to her son like that when she was trying to talk some sense into me and help her family.

I‚Äôm reaching out because I‚Äôve been struggling with something quite strange, and I can‚Äôt seem to find any explanations for it. Maybe someone here has had a similar experience or knows what could be going on.

For some time now, I‚Äôve noticed that certain smells trigger an intense physical reaction in me. The most problematic are:
	‚Ä¢	The smell of various baked goods,
especially sandwiches
	‚Ä¢	Freshly baked goods (eg pretzels)
	‚Ä¢	The scent of cooked coffee
	‚Ä¢	Tomatoes (particularly irritating)
	‚Ä¢	Many other foods (especially industrial produced stuff)

Whenever I‚Äôm exposed to these ‚Äûsmells‚Äú (it‚Äôs not about the scent tho), my saliva changes‚Äîit becomes thick and sticky instead of fluid and wet, making my mouth feel uncomfortably dry. At the same time, my face starts to burn and feels dry and tight, almost as if my skin is reacting to the airborne particles.

I have never heard of anything like this before, and it‚Äôs becoming a serious issue. I‚Äôve stopped going to caf√©s and bakeries, and I can‚Äôt eat at cafeterias anymore because the air alone triggers my symptoms.

Has anyone ever experienced something similar? Could this be an unusual form of allergy or sensitivity? I would be grateful for any insights or advice!

Thanks in advance!",1,1738671222.0,Allergies,0,1.0,False

A nameless organization offered to pay for it, and when I accepted, I started to hear things no person should ever have to hear.","

Before I start, I‚Äôd like to be as transparent as possible.

Twenty years ago, I was convicted of manslaughter. 

Framed by an organization that took my need and my vulnerability and twisted it to their own ends.

I can‚Äôt right my wrongs, and I know that. I‚Äôll live with the consequences of trusting them for the rest of my life. 

Now that I‚Äôm free, though, I've finally decided to put the truth of what happened to me out into the world, which boils down to this:

The organization implanted something that allowed me to hear sounds that are normally well out of reach from our perception. Sounds that the human mind wasn‚Äôt designed to withstand - an imperceptible cacophony that is occurring all around you as you read this, you just don't know it. It‚Äôs occurring around me as I write this as well, and although I can‚Äôt physically hear it, I can still *feel* it. It's faint, but I know it's there. 

And once I came to understand what they did, they made sure to silence me. 

\------------------

***11/01/02 - Ten days before the incident.*** 

*‚ÄúReady?‚Äù*

I nodded, which was only kind of a lie. I was *always* ready for this part of my week to be over, but I was never quite ready for the god-awful sensation.

Hewitt clicked the remote, and the implant in my left temple whirred to life. It always started gently. A quiet buzzing. Irritating, but only mildly so. Inevitably, however, the sound and the vibration crescendoed. What started as a soft hum grew into a furious droning, like a cicada vibrating angry verses from the inside of my skull.

I gritted my teeth and closed my eyes tight.

*Only a few more seconds.*

Finally, when I could barely tolerate it anymore, a climatic shockwave radiated from the device, causing my jaw to clack from the force. With the reverberation dissipating as it moved further down my body, the device stilled.

A sigh of relief spilled from my lips.

I opened my eyes and saw green light reflecting off of Hewitt‚Äôs thick glasses from the implant‚Äôs remote. In layman‚Äôs terms, I‚Äôd learned that meant ‚Äúall good‚Äù.

Hewitt smiled, creasing his weathered cheeks.

*‚ÄúThe implant is primed. Let me collect my materials so we can get this show on the road.‚Äù*

The stout Italian physician shot up from his desk chair and turned to face the wooden cabinets that lined the back of his office. Despite his advanced age and bulky frame, he was still remarkably spry.

*‚ÄúThanks. By the way, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be ‚Äòready‚Äô for that, Doc. For any of this, actually. You can probably stop asking. Save your breath, I mean.‚Äù*

As I spoke, it felt like heavy grains of sand were swimming around my molars. I swished the pebbles onto my tongue and spat them into my hand, frowning at the chalky crystals in my palm.

*‚ÄúJesus. Cracked another filling. Does the Audiology department have a P.O. box I can forward my dental bills to?‚Äù*

He chuckled weakly as he turned back towards me. The old doctor was only half-listening, now preoccupied with assembling the familiar experimental set up. Carefully, he placed a Buddha statue, a spray bottle of clear liquid, four half-foot tall metal pillars, and a capped petri dish on the desk.

Absentmindedly, I rubbed the scar above my temple. Most of the time, I just pretended like I could perceive the outline of the dime-sized implant. The delusion helped me feel in control.

But I wasn‚Äôt in control. Not completely, at least. 

I shared control with the remote in Hewitt‚Äôs hand, especially when *his* part of the implant was active. The experimental portion. Suppressing the existential anxiety that came with split dominance was challenging. I wasn‚Äôt used to my sensations being a democracy.

The concession felt worth it, though. The implant restored my hearing, and Hewitt installed it free, with a single string attached: I had to play ball with these weekly sessions, testing the part of the implant that I wasn‚Äôt allowed to know anything about, per our agreement.

On the desk, the doctor was arranging the metal pillars into a small square. Once satisfied with the dimensions of the square, he‚Äôd position the statue, the spray bottle, and the petri dish into the center of it. Then, testing would finally begin.

*‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶are your other patients tolerating this thing okay?‚Äù* I asked, fishing for a few reassuring words.

The doctor looked up from his designs, pointing a brown iris and a bushy white eyebrow at me.

*‚ÄúThere are no other patients like you, David.‚Äù*

He paused for a moment, maintaining unbroken eye contact, as if to highlight the importance of what just came out of his mouth. Abruptly, he severed his gaze and resumed fidgeting with the metal pillars, but he continued to talk.

*‚ÄúYour case, this situation, its‚Ä¶unique. A marriage of circumstances. When the brain infection took your hearing, any model of cochlear implant could have been used to repair it. But you couldn‚Äôt afford them, not even the cheapest one. At the exact same time, my lab was looking for an elegant solution to our own problem. A friend of a friend was aware of both of our dilemmas. You needed an implant for free, and we needed a‚Ä¶‚Äù*

He stopped talking mid-sentence and swiveled his head around the setup, examining it from different angles and elevations, but he made no further modifications. It seemed like everything was in its right place. Contented, he sat back down in his chair, and briefly, Hewitt was motionless. He looked either lost in his thoughts, captivated by things he‚Äôd rather not say out loud, or he was resting and not thinking about anything at all.

Either way, it took a moment for him to remember he had been explaining something to me. My confused facial expression probably sped that process along.

*‚ÄúRight. We needed a‚Ä¶‚Äù* he trailed off, wringing his hand to convey he was searching for the correct word in English.

*‚ÄúWe needed an ‚Äòoperator‚Äô. Someone to tell us that the device worked like we had designed it to. I wouldn‚Äôt say this was an elegant solution, but we‚Äôre both getting something out of the deal, I suppose.‚Äù*

In the nine months since the implantation, this was by far the most Hewitt ever divulged about the deeper contents of their arrangement.

As requested, he didn‚Äôt check if I was ready this time; instead, he winked and clicked another button on the remote.

*‚ÄúWhat do you hear?‚Äù*

Instantly, I could hear sound emanating from each of the stationary objects in the middle of the square. Nothing moved, and yet a loud, rhythmic drumming filled my ears. Despite being able to tell the noise was coming from directly in front of me, it sounded incredibly distant, too. Like it was echoing from the depths of a massive cave system before it reached me standing at the cave‚Äôs entrance.

What started a single drum eventually became a frenzied ensemble. Over only a few seconds, hundreds of drum rolls layered over each other until the chaotic pounding caused my head to throb. The Budha was grinning, but that‚Äôs not what I heard. I heard the marble figure screaming at me, its voice made of deafening thunder rather than anything recognizably human.

I cradled my temple with my palm and grimaced, shouting an answer to Hewitt‚Äôs question.

*‚ÄúAll three things are drumming, same as always, Doc.‚Äù*

He clicked the remote again, and like the flick of a switch, the objects became silent immediately. 

*‚ÄúThank you, David. Head to the lobby, grab a book and have Annemarie make you a cup of coffee. In about an hour, I‚Äôll call you back. We‚Äôll repeat the procedure, I‚Äôll deactivate the implant, and you‚Äôll be done for the week.‚Äù*

My legs pulled my body out of the chair without a shred of hesitation. I was dying to leave the office and get some fresh air. As my hand gripped the doorknob, however, Hewitt‚Äôs words rang in my head.

*There are no other patients like you, David.*

I turned back to the doctor, who was now spraying down the statue with the unknown liquid.

‚Äú*Hewitt‚Ä¶you mentioned something when we first met in the hospital - about our contract. You said that, eventually, you‚Äôd be able to explain to me what we‚Äôre doing here. I know I‚Äôve never brought it up before now. I think I used to be more scared of knowing than I was of being left in the dark, and, well‚Ä¶I‚Äôve sort of been feeling the opposite way, as of late. Is that option still on the table?‚Äù*

Although he interrupted what he was doing, he didn‚Äôt meet my gaze. Instead, he kept his focus on the statue and muttered a halfhearted response.

‚Äú*I can appeal to the board. No promises, David.‚Äù*

When I returned an hour later, the objects and the pillars were in their same positions, but the Buddha had a new, glistening shine on its marble skin.

As the device activated, the horrible drumming reappeared, but only from the spray bottle and the petri dish. The statue remained eerily quiet. 

Hewitt clicked the remote one last time. The implant beeped three times, and then released one last shockwave, weaker than the one that came with ‚Äúpriming‚Äù his part of the device. This supposedly meant the implant had completely deactivated its experimental portion. I was told the designers never intended me to experience the drumming outside a controlled setting.

*‚ÄúWell, that's all for today. You have my cell phone number. I may not always be able to answer, but call me if there are any issues. Feel free to leave a message, as well.‚Äù*

He shook my hand, forced a smile, and then waved me out of his office.

As I turned to leave, my eyes fell on the gleaming statue still sitting on his desk. Although the silence better matched the figure‚Äôs smile, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel like it was still screaming, berating me for being so na√Øve.

I just couldn‚Äôt hear it anymore.

\------------------

Below, I‚Äôve typed out what I can recall of the messages I left for Hewitt leading up to my inditement. 

Here's what I remember: 

\------------------

***11/05/02 - Six days before the incident.***

***Me:*** *Hey Hewitt. First off, everything is OK. I know I‚Äôve never called you on your cell before, so I don‚Äôt want you to think that‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt want you to think there‚Äôs a big emergency or something. I mean‚Ä¶there kind of was, but I‚Äôm alright.*

*I was in a car accident. Drunk driver fell asleep at the wheel, swerved into traffic and I T-boned him. Not sure he walked away from the wreck‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm hanging in there, all things considered. Just a broken rib and a nasty concussion on my end. Banged the side of my head against the steering wheel pretty hard.*

*Still hearing everything OK, so I‚Äôm assuming the device is working fine, but I figured with the head injury‚Ä¶I figured you might want to know. Especially since our next appointment isn't for another week.*

*Give me a call back at* \[xxx-xxx-xxxx\] *when you can.*

\------------------

***11/06/02 - Five days before.***

***Me:*** *Got your machine again, I guess. Haven‚Äôt heard from you, so I suppose you aren‚Äôt too worried about me‚Ä¶or the implant. Which is good! Which is good...*

*But‚Ä¶uhh‚Ä¶maybe you should be. I am‚Ä¶after last night.*

*I started‚Ä¶hearing the drumming at home. Just little bits of it, here and there. Much quieter than usual.* 

*I was sitting at my computer‚Ä¶and I heard it in the background of the music I was listening to. It just kind of‚Ä¶appeared. I‚Äôm not sure how long it was there before I noticed it. At first, I thought I was hearing things, but as I walked through my apartment, it became louder. Muffled, though. Felt like it was coming from multiple places rather than one. Eventually, I thought I tracked it to a drawer in my kitchen, but when I pulled it opened, it stopped‚Ä¶all of a sudden.*

*I guess it could be the concussion, but the noise is so‚Ä¶distinctive. An invisible jackhammer banging into invisible concrete, like I‚Äôve told you.*

*Anyway‚Ä¶just call me back.*

*Oh! Before I forget, have you heard from the board? I‚Äôd‚Ä¶I‚Äôd really like to know what this thing does. In addition to my hearing, I mean.*

\------------------

***11/08/02 - Three days before.***

***Me:*** *Doc - where the fuck are you?*

*‚Ä¶sorry. Didn‚Äôt mean to lose my temper. I‚Ä¶I haven‚Äôt slept.*

*Can the implant‚Ä¶turn on by itself? I‚Äôm‚Ä¶I‚Äôm definitely hearing‚Ä¶whatever I‚Äôm being trained to hear.*

*It‚Äôs‚Ä¶it‚Äôs everywhere. Comes and goes at random. Or‚Ä¶maybe I‚Äôm just starting to hear it when I face it a certain way. My head‚Ä¶it feels like an antenna. If I turn my head up and to the left‚Ä¶it all goes away. Any other position, though, and I can hear the drumming. Like I said - everywhere. On my phone, my clothes, the walls‚Ä¶*

*I‚Ä¶I heard it inside myself, too.*

*I managed to fall asleep, but I guess I relaxed, and my muscles relaxed and‚Ä¶well, my head must have turned, because I could hear it again.* 

*Loud as hell...from the inside of my mouth.* 

*I‚Äôm not proud, but I‚Ä¶I kind of freaked out. Put my hands in my mouth and just‚Ä¶just started scraping. I‚Ä¶I wanted it out of me. Dug at my gums‚Ä¶its really bad.*

*I can‚Äôt drive, either. I mean, I can try, but I feel like I‚Äôll just get in another wreck, trying to keep my head up and to the left while driving. And‚Ä¶what if it still happens? Even though my heads in the right place?*

*Please‚Ä¶please call me.*

\------------------

***11/10/02 - One day before.***

***Me:*** *‚Ä¶I‚Äôve started to feel it all, Hewitt.*

*The drumming‚Ä¶it‚Äôs moving over everything. It‚Äôs* ***in*** *everything. It breaks you, and then it rebuilds you again. And now, I have only one sense, not five.*

*I don‚Äôt see, I don‚Äôt taste, smell, touch‚Ä¶and I certainly don‚Äôt hear. Not anymore.*

*But I feel the current.* 

*I feel it writhing and pounding and slipping and fucking and expanding and consuming and living and dying over every‚Ä¶****goddamned****‚Ä¶thing.*

*It speaks to me. Not in a language or a tongue. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a tide. It ebbs and flows.*

*It sings wordless songs to me‚Ä¶and I understand, now.* 

*I thought you cursed me, Hewitt. But all transitions cause pain. I mean, how do you turn a liquid into a gas?*

*You boil it. And when it bubbles its tiny pleading screams, you certainly don‚Äôt stop.*

*You turn up the heat.*

\------------------

***11/11/02 - Day of the incident***

***Me:*** *Hello?* **(shouting)**

***Hewitt:*** *David, are you at home?*

***Me:*** *Doc - oh thank God. You‚Ä¶you gotta help me‚Ä¶oh God‚Ä¶it‚Äôs‚Ä¶it‚Äôs everywhere‚Ä¶I‚Äôm nothing‚Ä¶I‚Äôm nothing‚Ä¶* **(shouting)**

***Hewitt:*** *Can you get to the-***(I cut him off)**

***Me:*** *Please‚Ä¶please make it stop. Why doesn‚Äôt it ever‚Ä¶why doesn‚Äôt it ever stop‚Ä¶* **(Crying, shouting)**

***Hewitt:*** *David, I need you to calm down.*

***Me:*** *Am I hearing death, Hewitt? Can God hear what I can hear, Doc, or are they too scared?* **(Laughing, shouting)**

***Hewitt:*** *LISTEN.* **(shouting)**

***Me:*** ‚Ä¶ **(line goes dead)**

***Hewitt:*** *You‚Äôre hearing the microscopic, David. It was all just supposed to be a novel way to test the effectiveness of anti-infectious agents. Once they stopped moving, we know the medication killed them. We stood to make a lot of money off of the technology, but we couldn't prove it worked. Not until you. You‚Äôve‚Ä¶you‚Äôve helped so many people, David‚Ä¶*

***Me:*** **(quietly)** *I‚Äôve been able‚Ä¶able to hear, able to feel‚Ä¶the billions of living things‚Ä¶moving around‚Ä¶on my skin‚Ä¶inside me‚Ä¶everywhere‚Ä¶*

***Hewitt:*** *Don't call an ambulance, don't call the police. We're coming to pick you up.*

\------------------

I don't remember much from that night other than this conversation. I can vaguely recall Hewitt arriving at my apartment, remote in hand. He examines my head, and I'm fading in and out of consciousness. 

When I fully come to, I'm lying on my couch, holding a gun I'd never seen before. A few steps away is Hewitt's corpse. 

And I start crying - not out of fear or confusion, out of relief. 

It's finally quiet. Silent as the grave. The endless drumming of infinite microorganisms crawling around me and within me had vanished. 

My weeping is interrupted by a man rounding the corner into my living room. He's well dressed with dark blue eyes, and he walks over to sit next to me, stepping over Hewitt as he does. 

He introduces himself as Hewitt. Tells me the body won't be needing the name anymore, so it's his now. 

*""Listen, David, we have some new terms. You can still keep the device, meaning you can keep your hearing. Its fixed now, too. You won't be hearing anything you weren't meant to hear from now until the day you die.""*

*""As with any fair deal, I have some conditions. You can't tell anyone what you heard, and you have to take the fall for the killing of the nameless body in front of you. If you do those things, you'll be safe.""*

*""Fail to abide by those conditions, and we're turning the noise back on. All of it. And we'll leave it on, up until the moment you choke on your own tongue. Not a second sooner.""*

*""Do you understand, David?""*

\------------------

I agreed to the terms then, but I've had a little change of heart. Jail gave me perspective. 

You see, the punishment behind incarceration is that you lose your autonomy. That's your incentive to reform. Serve your time, play by the rules and hey, maybe we'll give you your agency back. Maybe you'll have an opportunity to own your body again. 

It makes you realize that agency and autonomy are the only things that really have value in this world. Without them, you have nothing. 

And what is this implant, but another jail? I've wanted to speak up for so damn long, but the threat of being subjected to the drumming again has kept me silent. 

Well, I've changed. I'm tired of just settling for what they'll give me. I want my goddamned agency back. 

So, to the creators of the implant, consider this my resignation from our contract. In addition, I have a few choice words. I am relying on the internet to carry them to you, wherever you are.

There are various views on what constitutes a pure, disciplined lifestyle, and some argue that stimulants like caffeine may affect mindfulness or spiritual practices. On the other hand, some believe moderation is key and that there's no harm as long as it's not excessive.

What are your perspectives on coffee consumption in a spiritual context? Do you think it affects devotion, meditation, or overall well-being? I'd love to hear from others who follow a spiritual path!",2,1738671136.0,HareKrishna,3,1.0,False
1ihg8eo,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofattraction/comments/1ihg8eo/this_manifesting_method_always_works/,This Manifesting Method ALWAYS works!,"Don't let anyone tell you can't be or do or have anything you want - because you absolutely can! I'm the proof of that. I used to think LOA was impossible but then I realised I wasn't understanding it. I've gone from someone who was full of doubt and disbelief to a money magnet. Like most people I followed¬†all the LOA YouTubers but nothing was improving, and I used to read forums like this one for hours - I was worried that half the stories I was reading were made up or just scripting and the other half were just by people who could make it work and it just would't work for me! Now I've found a simple method that I know works - I know it does because now I'm not searching for answers, I have what I need.¬†

If it works for me it can work for anyone - I was someone earning a small amount per hour to someone who sometimes makes nearly six figures per year, sometimes more, and I've just had a pay rise. And I'm never without job offers through emails. It might not be millions I'm earning, but it's a quantum leap compared to where I was and what I first thought was possible. I want to help you drop the fake ideas which can seriously slow you down (I wasted years and thousands of pounds on workshops from manifesting teachers who wanted to take money from me more than they wanted to help).

The game changer for me is the confidence evoke which is still one of my favourite practices it's just total magic and it moves your reality at light speed. It's so simple, it's not a mental thing, it's all about the feeling. It's not about creating your reality by repeating words or robotically affirming like a lot of people are saying to do but I think that just keeps you away from what you want. What confidence evoking is is it's stepping one step at a time into the feeling state now. You don't try to visualize something impossible. You start with small steps of things that are easy to believe, such as times you got a free coffee or you found money on the street or someone bought you a surprise present. You keep on evoking the feeling and the more you do it, the process says (and it always works), the more actual real life experiences which match this feeling you evoke.¬†

Then, you're able to make the big leaps. The main difference is you make the visualization about the now not about trying to manifest something in the future.¬†

So what I did was start with confidence evoking times I'd felt rich. When I started I felt so poor so this seemed impossible. But I started to clear my mind and really focus on any time at all I'd felt even slightly rich. At first, it was a comment someone had made years before about me having a rich vibe. I held onto that, wrote it down, and kept coming back to it. Just like I read it then began to multiply and soon I recalled another time I'd felt rich. Then, the next stage was a friend offered to buy me a coffee. This too I wrote down. My wealth vibe had gone up a level, highlighted by the manifesting of the coffee. And this is how I went on. The key was that I confidence evoked the feeling I felt at the time until I started to feel that wealthy hit a lot more often.

I want to say that my career wages have only gone up since doing this practice, too, so I totally see how it's due to that. Being good at this is all about practice. Everyone I've met on here who confidence evokes gets results, it's like a science. The only people who don't are the ones who give up too soon or they don't even try it properly. Additionally a huge tip is to meditate first. Doing focal-point meditation (from week one) first clears your mind otherwise the mind is too complicated to focus and evoke the feelings. ¬†

And another thing, confidence evoking is also one of the best practices ever for changing/upgrading your looks and is like an instant cosmetic procedure except it's 100% effective, has no side effects, is non-invasive and best of all is 100% free! Firstly I got over body dysmorphia using the work and now I feel consistently attractive however we could all feel even better. I often say how I carry a small notepad and pen in my bag so I'm ready to confidence evoke whenever I'm going to a meeting and need to refresh my look instantly!",23,1738671066.0,lawofattraction,1,1.0,False
