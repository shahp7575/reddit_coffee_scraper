We went to the salesforce tower, made some laps and then went to get oysters at a restaurant next to the bay.  I noticed we didn’t have much to talk about anymore. Most of the questions I’ve already asked, but I enjoyed drinking coffee and holding hands and just being with her. Looking back at some of the dates we were quiet and embracing the views of a lookout spot etc, but this date we weren’t; and that got me worried. Im a very extroverted person so when I’m not talking something about me urges me to break the silence. She’s introverted and I am giving the benefit of the doubt that it is still early and she is still too shy.  We’ve hung out and things got intimate. I like her and think she’s beautiful and a catch overall. But should I worry that we don’t have anything to talk about too early? We also have been smashing the dates almost every other day (due to better scheduling for us both). This may also have played a factor since we just saw each other too quickly.

Also, I texted her layer on that night and told her I had fun to reassure her. She also said she always has fun with me with a smiley face ",1,1757621258.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

My boyfriend broke up with me last Thursday.

For some backstory, we had been seeing each other for about 4 months.  First dates had gone pretty good.  We met a bar, then made sushi, and watched a movie.  We shared a lot of common interests like music, we're both very intelligent, attracted to each other, and both very kind people.  As gay guys, we're both relatively masculine, which we both really desired.  We had great sexual chemistry where it mattered.

He felt uncertain about things, and at date 4 had texted about how he was unsure and didn't want to proceed.  We wound up getting coffee and talking about it.  He seemed to have two issues.  He was scared of going on because he didn't want to hurt me down the line and a small misunderstanding on where I stood on a political issue.  He had felt this way in large part because his last relationship had lasted 9 months, but he realized early on he wasn't into it.  He didn't want that to happen again.  We talked about it and got to the point that it wasn't that big of a deal yet, and we didn't need to decide on committing (political issue was a non-issue essentially).   We also agreed to be better about communicating moving forward.

Then, we went on some more dates, and things started getting really good.  We did one date where we each bought each other vinyls.  I got him an album we both really liked.  We both could definitely feel things.  I remember I met his roommate, and she was like ""he always talks about you.""  I had also told him ""I'm a slow-burn,"" and he replied ""you're burning.""  We drove out to go hiking, and did a lot of stuff together.  We continued to talk about where we stood each time we'd meet, and he consistently was getting close to wanting things.  I remember he went out of his way to join up for breakfast when one of my friends was visiting from out-of-town.  He met two of my best friends on a double-date and playing pickleball together.

About 3 weeks ago, after we had been dating for 3 months, he asked to make things official.  He told me that he had written in his journal and then listed out all of the things he liked.  Then, he got down on one knee (jokingly) and asked to be my bf.  I had been going away the next week with my family, so we made plans to meet up again when I got back.  When I was away, it felt like he was texting a bit less, so I asked to a facetime.  We called for like 3 hours and texted 2-3 times a day.  I flew in next week and then we met and spent the night and Labor Day together.  Things felt a tiny bit more distant, but I chalked that up to distance.

Then, we had made plans to meet Thursday.  Things felt a little weird texting-wise, and then he said for plans we should go on a walk and then figure things out (which was a little weird, and I was freaking the entire day).  We meet up, and he drops that he doesn't see things working out long-term.  We walked for like 12 miles and talked for hours about things.  We had made a plan to stay in touch for 2 weeks and meet up a few times.  It was a bit of whirlwind to go from official to breaking up in 2 dates.

We met up this Monday, and we played some xbox, made dinner, dropped off some clothes I wanted to donate and then talked a lot in my bed.  I could feel how unemotional he was at this point like he entirely backed off.  I think he told me that this was partially intentional because he didn't know how I was feeling and didn't want me to get the wrong idea.  We talked a lot.  This entire time I felt like I couldn't ever express myself because he was running away from commitment, but I finally told him that I really liked him and just like he did gave him a list of things I really liked about him.  He started crying.  He kept saying how he thought that there was something missing because we didn't have a flow in our conversation.  This is hard for me to accept because it feels like that is the one thing that for sure improves over time.  He also said that belies that we think about things differently, which I also didn't understand because we're both just very kind people granted he's a lot more creative than I am.

We're going to meet again Wednesday, but I don't know what to do.  I know he's for sure closed the door on getting back together, but we're perfect for each other and it feels like the one issue he's claiming was getting better and is something that naturally comes with time anyways.  Do you think he has commitment issues because of his last relationship?  I'm also even more scared of him leaving my life for good.  Is it worth it to just propose to be friends although at this point I'm not even sure he'd be willing to do that.  What should I do, especially if tries to cut each other out of our lives?

I did a second roast where I really cranked up the heat and Hit 150C right about 5 minutes. FC at 8:40, dropped at 10:30, after the last few beans cracked. Final roaster temp was 210C at drop. 

The final WL was almost exactly the same. The First roast was 12.3%, the second was 12.6%. 

AROMA:

The first, slower roast, had very pronounced ""wet paper bag"" aromas during the bloom. That vague papery aroma lasted through breaking the crust with mild citrus notes.

The second, faster, batch did not have that paper smell and instead had a sweet, somewhat floral aroma more akin to citrus blossoms than citrus rind. 

TASTE:

OK, so this is where the differences really came out. The first roast carried on with the ""paper"" theme. Doesn't taste like paper, but leaves my mouth very dry. There is a sharp acidity and lingering bitterness that is just not nice. Some roasty flavors, but I think that's contributing to the bitterness. 

The second roast is much better. There is much better sweetness to the cup. The astringency from roast 1 isn't there and is a much smoother drinking experience. There is still a bit of bitterness, but more balanced (The tasting notes include red grapefruit, so I expect a bit of bitter) and clean. The acidity isn't as outright sour and is more mellow orange than under ripe lemon.

Anyhow, wanted to give an update and a big shout-out to the group for the help! The coffee isn't where I want it, but I feel much more confident for future roasts.",1,1757620933.0,roasting,0,1.0,False

I work in a small office where the real power lies not with the CEO or the IT guy, but with our communal coffee machine. This isn't your standard office-grade coffee pot. No, this is a high-end, barista-approved espresso maker that my boss bought himself as a reward for some quarterly achievement. It's his pride and joy, and he often brags about how it's more reliable than his college roommate who bailed on rent. Anyway, yesterday morning, I came in early to squeeze in some last-minute work before a big meeting. I make my way over to the sacred coffee altar, as one does, and notice the machine's grinder is jammed. Without thinking, I decide to give it a gentle nudge. Of course, a gentle nudge turns into an accidental full-force bump, and the entire thing comes crashing down with a catastrophic clatter. The grinder's lid flies off, beans scatter like confetti, and the milk frother detaches with a pitiful 'clunk'. In my caffeine-deprived stupor, I panic and try to patch it back together like it's some kind of espresso Humpty Dumpty. My boss walks in just as I'm holding the grinder in one hand and a fistful of beans in the other like some guilty coffee-loving gremlin. To say he was shocked would be an understatement. I tried to explain, but he just looked at the machine, then at me, and said, 'Guess you're buying the next round of beans.' Thankfully, he took it in stride, and after an awkward pause, we both laughed about it. The office has now dubbed the event 'The Great Bean Catastrophe'. I'm currently on a first-name basis with the local coffee repair guy. TL;DR: Tried to fix a jammed coffee machine at work, ended up disassembling it unintentionally.

From home ownership, abusive marriage, pregnancy, assisting during active addiction, supporting during recovery efforts, near death experiences on his end, becoming his caretaker while working full time, to separation. 

It’s been 2 years since I left, but I still feel like a shell of my old self. I feel empty, disconnected, hopeless, shameful, yet angry. I poured my absolute ALL into that man & the life we were pursing. 

2 months after leaving, two bones in my hand were fractured in a car accident requiring surgical repair. I was in a cast for 3 months following the repair, followed by 4 months of occupational therapy, 3x a week. For the duration I was in a cast, I could not drive nor did I have a vehicle. (*still employed full-time*) I’m thankful for my mother-in-law for driving me to & from work & to & from ortho sessions, but I had lost my independence. At the time, all I wanted was to find my identity again & this created a roadblock. I lost my appetite even more, mind you, I’m a bodybuilder. The injury killed my spirit & it worsened my mental health. The only person I was living for was my occupational therapist. He counted on me to show up & make progress. It was a blessing in disguise. 

After completing OT, I dialed in on my nutrition & fitness. However, mentally, I felt the same. I looked good, but didn’t feel good. My symptoms started affecting my behavior, attendance & work performance. I had no desire to “be polite” or smile. Why should I have to fake a personality I don’t have??? Or listen to people complain about the slightest of inconveniences?? I felt drained at all times. The only thing I looked forward to was my daily trip to my fave coffee shop & my cat waiting for me at home. Hazelnut latte with oat milk, my friends 🙌🏽

Here we are today. I just had my first PCP appointment in 7+ years. When describing things that felt like hassles to me, I broke down & cried. I told her that simply brushing my teeth feels like an ordeal. She was wonderful & I felt accomplished in a weird way for finally addressing what’s been drowning me. I feel in control of my health for once. She ordered labs including all the hormones I requested, referred to psych (at my discretion) & prescribed Lexapro 5mg to get my body acclimated. She genuinely seems interested in working with me to help me feel better. I’m scheduled to see her again next month. I’m pleased & I feel a sliver of hope.

It might not be this month or next, but SCHEDULE THAT PCP APPT!!!

*Harsby, south east Sweden, June 12 1956.*

Brita Raninger was a housewife and contactee woman living outside Söderköping in eastern Sweden. Ever since she was 4 years old, she had strange experiences and encounters. When she was a little girl and lived in Småland, one evening she heard someone walking on the gravel road outside the house. She became curious and went outside and saw an unknown woman dressed in white walking towards her. The woman gave the girl a strange leaf, which was very hard, reddish-brown in color and had yellow dots on it. Then the white-clad lady disappeared along the road. Brita ran inside to her mother and some relatives who were visiting and showed the leaf, but no one knew what plant had such leaves. A few days later they went to a neighbor who they knew had lots of different exotic potted plants, but she didn't know what kind of leaves they had either. Brita called the white-clad lady ""the angel"" and said that she came from another planet and the leaf was some kind of message from the female alien.

[When Brita was a child she met an unknown woman in white who gave her a strange leaf. \(CGI interpretation\)](https://preview.redd.it/f4p6mbyu8lof1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8dd2b5db5daa2fcd123d8d2ddf56446fdce74a4d)

When Brita was 6 years old, she had her next experience. On Midsummer Eve 1926, she and other children saw a cross in the sky and at the same time they heard beautiful choir singing. Not everyone saw the crosses, and only heard the singing or vice versa. But Brita heard the singing and saw the majestic shining cross floating slowly across the sky. Many years later, she heard that more people in the area had seen the cross in the sky.

In August 1956, Brita was visiting her parents' home in Småland, to meet some childhood friends. They were drinking coffee and eating cake when someone in the group saw some frightened deer running across the yard. Everyone wondered why they were in such a hurry. Suddenly, they saw a helicopter-like object hovering over the forest. It descended and landed in the meadow between the forest and the house. They saw four strange little beings jump out and run a few circles around the craft. But none of the people in the group really wanted to see what was happening and tried not to pretend it was happening. UFOs and aliens were still taboo in 1956, and if you saw such things or talked about them, you were considered wierd or even crazy.

But two months before this, Mrs. Raninger witnessed another strange UFO landing. It was at the beginning of the summer in June and it was about 7-8 in the evening. Brita was sitting and meditating under a large oak tree in a forest clearing in Harsby where she lived. The sun had started to set and was about to disappear behind the trees in the forest, but it was still quite bright outside and the sun's rays were still shining through the trees in the clearing. She had been sitting under the oak tree for about 10-15 minutes when she heard a buzzing sound. At first she thought it was wasps or bees. But then she noticed that it was a little too monotonous to come from insects. It was not a loud sound but enough to catch her attention. She looked around and then noticed that a strange object was parked in the clearing. Then a couple of figures appeared, short green-clad beings walking around in front of a saucer-like craft. They had green, shiny clothes that covered them from head to toe except for their heads. They had no hoods, but rather long black curly hair that reached their shoulders. Their clothing resembled uniforms and was tight-fitting and appeared to be made of a leather-like material.

[One summer evening in June 1956, while Brita was sitting under an oak tree, a blue-green saucer shaped craft landed in the meadow not far from her and two short dark haired humanlike beings stepped out. \(CGI interpretation\)](https://preview.redd.it/i2jtdmza9lof1.jpg?width=929&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=99428e1f807b2cbb457848d89a60d3cf99121bf8)

The saucer-like craft shimmered in blue-green. Brita described it as a large flat disk with a larger dome on top and a smaller bulge on the bottom. The body of the craft was 1.2 – 1.3 meters high (4 – 4.3 feet) and the diameter of the disk was about 4.5 meters (15 feet), and the upper glass dome, in which the aliens later sat, was 1 meter high (3.3 feet).

The humanoids moved quickly and smoothly around their craft. When Brita watched them, one of the beings turned and stared straight at her and she was hypnotized by his gaze. At this moment, she received a telepathic message from him. They had landed there to repair the craft, which had malfunctioned. The small, short beings were about 150 cm tall (4.9 feet), and they had an Asian/Mongolian appearance. They did not seem afraid of the woman, but rather curious. Mrs. Raninger was not afraid of them either, but she was still a little bit shaken. The fact that the beings had come here was a kind of confirmation for Brita, who had long felt watched by something she could not explain.

After 10-12 minutes the beings ran back into the craft. Brita could not see how they got in, but their smiling faces suddenly became visible in the upper transparent dome. Then the same buzzing sound she had heard before came back and the craft lifted off. The craft circled the clearing a few times while it rose and then it flew away steeply upwards at a great speed and disappeared to the west. The whole observation lasted about 15 minutes and it made a strong impression on Brita Raninger. After the saucer-shaped craft with the small beings disappeared, a strong smell of phosphorus hung over the clearing and during an examination of the site a few weeks later, an acquaintance of Mrs. Raninger found that the grass in the clearing had been burned in an even and round circle.

It was after this experience that Brita began to have telepathic contact with the aliens. It started as apparitions in dreams where beings appeared and gave her messages. She didn't remember everything the beings told her, but a lot of it was about environmental destruction and that humans had to take care of their planet. Then she started having telepathic contacts and they always started with her seeing a large shining star. She experienced these occasions as very pleasant. Mrs. Raninger said that the beings in the flying saucers were friendly to the people of Earth and that they wanted to communicate their messages with certain chosen contact people, and they came from a wonderful planet that was relatively close to us.

**The man with the egg.**

*Mikkeli, south-east Finland, July 1969.*

This is another of the fascinating cases that are recounted in Tapani Kuningas’ book “UFOja Suomen Taivaalla” (UFO:s over Finland’s sky). In this story, Finnish contactee Toivo Kovanen told about his encounters with a strange man. Toivo was in his 40s and had never read a single UFO book in his life, and he did not believe in the supernatural or psychic abilities. However, despite this, he began to experience parapsychological phenomena and later he also met a mysterious humanoid. He would meet this being both physically and also have contact with him mentally several times.

It was the summer of 1969 and Toivo lived in the countryside outside Mikkeli in Southeastern Finland. It was between 11 and 12 PM and his wife was working the night shift and was not home and Toivo could not sleep. Instead, he went out into the cool summer night and walked around the yard and looked around. Suddenly he saw an unknown man standing and looking at him near the corner of the house and at the same time he noticed a strange device parked a little bit away at the edge of the field nearby. Toivo asked himself what this was all about and thought it must be the Candid Camera or something.

Toivo greeted the mysterious man who greeted him back. Then he asked the man how they had managed to get the large device so close to his house without him hearing anything. The man replied that even if they were to demolish all the houses nearby, no one would notice anything because they had made sure that everyone around them was fast asleep. Toivo was about to ask another question when he discovered that the man was no longer standing by the house but had somehow moved very quickly 10 meters (33 feet) away and was now standing near the device instead.

[The mysterious man led Toivo to a nearby field where an egg shaped craft was parked. Three other men was seen in an opening of the object. \(CGI interpretation\)](https://preview.redd.it/r1lttsz8alof1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bea4b3c10e55ebe00aeab5ea293cd0c84567838d)

The machine looked like a large metal chicken egg and was about 5 meters (16.5 feet) high. The object also had ridges in rows that Toivo thought looked like bolts similar to those found on airplanes. He saw no landing gear, but instead it seemed as if the machine was hovering just above the ground, but he also pointed out that it could be that he did not fully noticed how it was parked on the ground. In the middle of the object was an even larger cutout like a hatch or sliding door. In this opening stood three other beings who resembled the man who was standing on the ground in front of the machine.

The three men in the hatch looked at Toivo and asked at the same time, *“Do you want to come with us?”.* Now his amazement turned to fear and he shouted *“No, get away from here!”* to the beings and with trembling legs he turned and started walking away. Toivo was sure that something terrible would happen if he followed and he thought he might be going crazy. So he continued walking towards the house without showing them any more interest and he could hear them calling after him all the way until he reached the edge of the field. He was very shocked by what had happened and felt uneasy for a long time. He also has no idea how the craft left the field.

[Witness sketch of the egg shaped craft. \(source: UFO Information\)](https://preview.redd.it/954xh5bwalof1.jpg?width=404&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=11b5bdcd6e5cdf0a22f745f56a3a5db043bae3bf)

One Sunday two weeks later, Toivo encountered the mysterious man again near his house. He was no longer afraid, but instead more agitated. He learned that they had been monitoring him since he was 17 and that there were more contactees like him in Finland who the beings spoke to. They met both physically and mentally a few more times, and once again Toivo Kovanen was asked if he wanted to join the beings and “become one of them”. This time too, he declined. During their meetings, they also talked a lot about religion, and the beings told him that the Bible was right about some things, but wrong about other things. Every time they talked, Toivo saw the man's lips move, but instead he heard his voice inside his head, not through his ears. And when Toivo once asked the man where he and his kind came from, he replied: *""We come from everywhere.""*

**An unexpected encounter down at the creek.**

*Åmosen, eastern Denmark, May 1975.*

One evening in May, a young man was down by the Åmose River fishing for eel. This place was in the Åmosen nature reserve in western Zealand and he was about 300 – 400 meters (328 – 437 yards) from the point where the Nilløse-Skjellingsted road crosses the river. The weather was very clear and there was moonlight and it was even unusually cold for the time of year, with a light frost on the ground.

Shortly before midnight, the witness spotted a low-flying yellow light in the west, which in strangely manner approached the Hesselbjerg forest in irregular zig-zag movements. It passed over the forest and now came up on the southern side of a nearby ridge. The light stopped about 200 - 300 meters (219 - 328 yards) from the man and that was when he saw the object more clearly and in detail. The top was a shade of gray, while the bottom was deep black and both the top and bottom were completely symmetrical in shape, and looked like two deep plates placed edge to edge. The craft stood and hovered in the air in the same place while rocking back and forth with jerky movements that lasted throughout the observation. In the brighter upper part of the craft, the witness could see a row of illuminated windows. He did could not exactly make out their shape, but he remembered that bright white lights shone from them.

[A sketch of the craft. Two beings were clearly visible in the large illuminated windows. \(source: UFO-Nyt\)](https://preview.redd.it/xf073xh5blof1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf8d3621897ef837c65cb381a5cb4ae8139f207b)

Suddenly something happened. The craft sent down a cone of light from the bottom of the lower part. The light tapered to a point at a height of 5 - 6 meters (16 - 19 feet) above the ground. This light was not dazzling in any way, but it constantly changed color from orange to white. Now the witness also discovered two dark figures in the lighted windows of the craft. He clearly saw that they were moving inside as they were outlined as black silhouettes in the light. They were visible from the chest up in the windows.

The man was so busy studying these two beings that he only saw a third figure outside the craft a little later. This being was floating in the middle of the beam of light, hanging below the craft. It seemed as if it was somehow ascending into the craft. This being also appeared clearly in the glow of the beam of light. The witness could not determine whether the it was being pulled into the craft by its own power or by the help of the beam of light. The ascent was slow and then he saw the UFOnaut disappear into the bottom of the craft. After this, the beam of light was also sucked into the UFO and disappeared.

[The craft hovered over the area with a cone shaped light underneath. A being was elevated from the ground by the light cone and was sucked into the craft. \(source: Molvig\)](https://preview.redd.it/lmyt55jdblof1.jpg?width=825&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=63b36d4a7854bc39ba7d51a8c1d2124c4c412cd9)

The craft now began to move and it went back and forth over the area before flying away to the west. As the object moved out of view, the man saw that its upper part appeared a little brighter than before, at the same time as a white luminous ring or flange became visible in the middle. During the entire observation, which lasted about 5 minutes, the witness did not hear a single sound from the craft.

The man later explained to UFO researchers that he was not paralyzed during the incident. When asked if he experienced any side effects from the sighting, he replied that some time later the white of one of his eyes turned blood red, and he also had an unexplained spot on his eye, but this occurred 10 days after the incident and the man did not believe it had anything to do with the UFO.

**A strange vehicle in the sky.**

*Østbyhøgda, south-east Norway, December 18 1980.*

It was 6:12 PM on a Thursday evening and gardener Leif Aashaug was outside in one of his greenhouses next to his house in the countryside of Østbyhøgda, when he saw a bright light in the sky through the glass. He quickly went outside and saw a bright white object coming towards him. He immediately understood that it was not an airplane or the lights of a car far away. The phenomenon came from the north and approached Leif slowly and he stood watching it for almost two minutes before he could make out any details.

When the light was close, he could see an object that looked like the windows of a helicopter cockpit from the front. Inside the windows there was a light and in the middle he could see something that looked like a window post. Leif could also make out silhouettes of some people moving inside the glass. Behind the bright object was a halo that was a little darker and had a small bend at the lower end. Under the bend something that looked like an orange-red heat cloud came out. Leif didn't think it really looked like smoke and it came out in spurts. Under the object he saw three narrow landing legs pointing downwards.

[A bubble shaped craft with a corona behind passed by over Leif's head. \(CGI interpretation\)](https://preview.redd.it/0qmhrku3clof1.jpg?width=933&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f838125bec1c25351babf337ff4009ead3b5e18d)

The craft moved slowly across the sky and Leif heard no sound from it. However, he felt a faint heat as it passed at low altitude above him. He stood watching for it as it disappeared beyond the trees in the direction of the Hadeland-Hurdal area. Leif Aashaug estimated the observation time to be about two and a half minutes and he believed the object had a speed of 60 km/h (37.3 miles/h). The weather on this dark winter evening was calm and the temperature was -4 °C (24.8 F).

UFO Norway took this case seriously and contacted Gardermoen Airport to investigate whether there were helicopters or other aircraft in the area. The operations officer replied that there were no aircraft there at that time.

I work part-time while studying and last night I stayed up way too late watching random TikToks. This morning I hit snooze on my alarm like… six times. I finally grabbed my phone, still half-asleep, and tried to check my messages. Instead of opening WhatsApp, my zombie brain apparently opened FaceTime.

Next thing I know, I hear *ringing*. I blink at the screen and realize I’m *calling my boss*. Not just a normal call a full-on VIDEO call. I was literally under the blanket, messy hair, drooling on my pillow, and probably looking like I hadn’t showered in three weeks. I panicked, tried to hang up, but my thumb hit the screen wrong and I ENDED UP ANSWERING IT FOR A SPLIT SECOND.

So yeah, now my boss has seen me half-asleep, looking like I fought a bear and lost. I wanted the earth to swallow me. He hasn’t mentioned it yet but every time he emails me, I can feel the second-hand cringe radiating through my laptop.

What should I do?,"First of all, sorry if there is something wrong with the formatting with the post. This is first time for me asking a question about my personal life. I'll meet up with a friend of mine who went through a bad relationship and gave me some proper advice in 2 days. I felt like I need to went or look for advice from complete strangers online until then.

I (31 M) recently got into a new job. It's been going great in general. The first person I met when I was introduced was this friendly looking composed girl (27 F). We immediately started to get along because we had a lot of things in common, even to the point of underrated bands we both listened to. She more reserved and I was more outgoing and humorous but for some reason everything involving here started to feel very natural and enjoyable.

Now I know about the common phrase ''don't shit where you eat''. But the thing is, I haven't been in a relationship for a very long time. For some reason I wasn't really interested in other women despite how attractive they were both in looks and in personality because I wasn't really willing to get into another relationship and I had a lot going on with my life at that point so I wouldn't get bothered.

But with her I didn't even understand how fast the time went, especially during work time. We had long conversations for hours and kept sharing anything we could find interesting throughout the day and sometimes night.

I was at first attracted to her personality but they I started to feel attracted to her in a romantic way. Wıthout even understand I was gradually falling in love.

It felt like I was back to my teenage years, my heart fluttered and I was genuinely feeling happy. I invited her for coffee during breaks and to take some fresh air and she always accepted. I also eventually started hitting on her in a jokingly and subtle way and saw her giving a shy smile. I was having so confident and almost like invincible.

I also made some comments about meeting up with her outside work to see if she has a boyfriend. When the topic was about having a boyfriend she didn't reply, or switched the topic of discussion to something else. I also started to notice that she started to leave the office to make some phone calls more and more often.

Anyway, fast forward to a month later, when she found out that I liked her in a totally unrelated way (I was about to confess her on a date, not in the workplace) she politely rejected me. I was distraught of course, as I believed that she would be the one. Never in my life had I loved someone that much. But since we both enjoyed our companionship, we decided to keep it as friends as we were still working in the same office and had to keep things professional.

A few days ago, I realized that the more time I spent with her, despite being friendzoned, I just couldn't let it go since I'm still attracted to her. I said I wanted to meet up outside work and properly discuss with her about how strong my feelings are because since I was rejected by a text message everything felt like it was cut short for me and I was getting perplexed about what to do. I told her this would at least help me make up my mind. She agreed to meet up with me and told me to empty all my feelings until I felt like I was in peace. to which I replied if she wrote this for my well being or if she could consider changing her decision after hearing about my thoughts. She texted back ''unfortunately''. I told her then it's alright not to meet up, I also made up my mind and told her I won't bother her with this anymore.

After this, I started to focus more on work and gradually dwindle the frequency of texting and at work conversation. Less meet ups outside the office and less time going out for lunch break together. Despite me usually being the one who asks first. But I still couldn't refuse her whenever she asked me to.

I also met up with a close friend of mine who has previously tried to suicide due to a very bad breakup after a long term relationship. He was do depressed and we were trying to cheer him up two weeks ago. Thankfully he is now feeling much better and he gave me some really good advice on how to let it go and ignore her in general. I still enjoyed her company but my heart was still getting swayed anytime we made eye contact, therefore I started applying his advice, hoping that she would understand the reason why I was limiting our previously very enjoyable encounters.

Also more of her going outside the office for phone calls. The more I saw her talking on phone the more I was feeling convinced that she had a boyfriend and it was time to let it go in order to not the make things awkward. I was finally at peace.

Until today during the lunch break. We had lunch together as usual and I went outside for a smoke. Usually she also comes with me despite not being a smoker but she uses the ''getting a fresh air'' excuse in order not to make our supervisors angry.

Anyway, I was purposely ignoring her whenever she wanted to make a conversation with me and it felt like she was coming to realize because she also had stopped sending our usual good morning messages and sharing songs while on our way to work.

She then met up with a guy I never seen before. She told me that she had a big brother but I seriously doubted that would be him because they seemed intimate despite not displaying any PED (thank god). Then they walked together right past me and sat on a nearby bank because it was sunny outside.

I felt like my heart was hit by a arrow. I never felt like this in my entire life before, I got cheated, got dumped for the stupidest reasons, got through some really bad breakups during my past relationships but I got over it after a week or two at best. I genuinely felt like I couldn't breathe and my chest was squeezing so hard despite being outside the office.

Until the end of that day I ignored everything about her and got myself occupied with work. Even when she come up to me and asked how was I doing.

After the work I was waiting for the staff shuttle buses to take off in front of building to leave. Then I saw that guy. He was anxiously looking for her left and right and kept checking his phone. She later arrived and they got into a bus together and left.

I don't know how I'm feeling and what to do afterwards. But I felt really furious that she didn't tell me that she had a boyfriend. Had she said that to me sooner, the sooner and easier I'd let it go and not get myself attracted to her any further, we could still be good friends inside and maybe outside the work. Now I'm considering to completely halt all my encounters with her and tell her that ''I need to keep my relationship to you on a strictly professional level since we are still working in the same office and ask help from each other, but other than that please do not contact me anymore, it wouldn't be really proper since you a boyfriend'' if she asks for the the reason and turns out that he really is her BF. I'm also thinking a million other sentences but I don't want to break her heart because she is a really nice and thoughtful person. The reason why I was attracted to her in the first place.

I know that the logical action here would be to limit everything to a professional as it's the most level-headed course of action to do and it also helps keeping our jobs from being at risk. But no matter what I do the pain in my heart won't pass and all thoughts of bad thoughts are racing through my mind when I saw her with that guy. Despite none of it being out of my business.

The worst part is, my previously high confidence and self-esteem just plummeted after seeing this. The guy was no way as charming as her, looks wise. I always thought that she would go out with a taller (she is almost the same height as me) and a much more handsome guy. He seemed like a generic ass dude that was almost shorter than her (she has a slim figure so she looked taller than she actually is) and this infuriated me even more because I was running out of things to cope. I just hoped that maybe he had the greatest personality ever of which I also doubt because I've seen her getting upset after some phone conversations (despite me not asking her the reason as I didn't want to stick my nose in her personal life), probably with him.

I'm most likely going to talk with my other friends who had experienced similar relationships and come up with a solution. I eventually will. But for now, all I'm feeling is a suffocating and crushing feeling and thoughts on how not make things awkward in the workplace and kept my mind focused on work. It's ironic because the very reason why I was so good at adapting to the new workplace was mostly thanks to her.

Maybe after a few drinks and some clear headed thoughts I'll learn how to forget. But for now, thank you for listening to me. ",1,1757620452.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

Hey everyone, US IMG here. After taking my test on 8/15, I finally got my score back (at 12:50 am this morning). I wanted to do a write-up because I think my journey is a good example of what persistence can accomplish, and because my study approach proved to be adaptable. I'll throw a tl;dr at the bottom for those who aren't in the mood for my third-year novella.

First, here's a list of my scores starting with my shelves in order of my third year rotations: IM - 86, surgery - 83, pediatrics - 95, OBGYN - 92, FM - 92, psychiatry - 94.

Here's my CCSA/CCSEs in the order I took them: 15 - 265, 14 - 263, CCSE - 270, 13 - 271, 12 - 272, 11 - 272, 10 - 277.

So, I had some pretty strong scores, but I think this is a testament to my study strategy as opposed to my intelligence. I've always been considered smart, but I've never been 'the smartest'. I'll now describe my process throughout my third year and how my strategy progressed over time.

# Third Year Study Strategy:

My study strategy was partially carried over from a strong basic sciences routine, but I made some adjustments early on to account for the new schedule in clinicals. Clearly, the adjustment I made between IM and surgery was in the wrong direction, but it helped me course-correct going forward, which brings me to my first point: learn from everything you do during your prep. Every choice you make, every question you answer, will give you feedback. Integrate the feedback in as objective a way as possible (I say this as a neurotic med student, but you get the point).

So, let's talk about the strategy that allowed me to forgo an official dedicated period. First, as I'm sure everyone here is aware, you need to treat your shelves like prep for the real deal, especially in a time crunch. I know it's a polarizing app, but my strategy utilized Anki, which I'll elaborate on below. I also started creating ""Master Documents"" in the app Obsidian. This allowed me to catalog all of the tables and charts from Uworld, and thanks to Obsidian's hyperlink feature, I was able to link concepts together. This became incredibly valuable in my CCSA reviews, so I'll also touch on that below. But ultimately, what I ended up creating was an extensive interconnected library of all the step 2 concepts that I could easily navigate when reviewing for my exams.

For question banks, I did all of UWorld and Amboss. You might say, ""Okay, crazy, but what if you're a normal human?"" To which I'd say there is time to do both, but it's in how you use them. After step 1, I realized I was really challenged by the length of the question stems. To improve my reading speed and comprehension for step 2, I dedicated Amboss as my 'simulation Qbank' where I would do questions on timed, and only review questions that I marked or flagged while skimming the remaining ones. This allowed me to crush 80--sometimes 120--questions a day. It's worth noting that while doing the amboss questions, I focused on implementing strategy as much as I worked on applying knowledge. I'll touch on how I started dissecting questions below. By default, this left Uworld as my 'learning' qbank which meant this was a much more time-consuming process.

So, let's talk about Anki. I want to preface this by saying I don't think anki is necessary, but I do think you need to find something that you can be consistent with on a daily basis, especially if you were off-cycle like me and racing the clock throughout third year. I heavily used the Anking Deck for step 1 prep, and I was one of those people doing 500+ cards a day. The payoff was obvious, as I always scored well on the NBMEs. But I knew I couldn't spend 4 hours a day doing Anki during clinicals, especially after realizing my weakness with reading and comprehension. So I made a compromise. Under the shelf tags in the Anking deck, there's a tag called 'cards the anking did'. This greatly reduced the number of cards to finish during each rotation while also allowing me the room to add my own cards without feeling overwhelmed. Quick tangent: If you're wondering why my score dropped from IM to surgery, part of the reason was that I wanted to see what would happen if I only used the Uworld-linked Anking cards. There were other issues as well--I hadn't yet integrated Obsidian or Amboss into the fold--but I think lacking a solid foundation was the biggest contributing factor.

So let's talk about why I like Anki. 1) It touches on all of the concepts NBME expects you to know. I would come away from a shelf exam thinking about a question I was stuck on, and sure enough, I would come across a card that covered that very concept. 2) It is something you can easily be consistent with. Especially with the lesser amount of cards, doing anki became a 2-3 hour block of time I had everyday where I knew I was doing something effective (bonus: you can do it while waiting for a surgery to begin, or while waiting in line at the grocery store; I would even do my cards on a stationary bike which helped me get my cardio in during the year). Having something consistent like this freed me up to take plenty of nights off during the year, as well as keep up with my hobbies like rock climbing and cooking. So there you have it, I'm just another Anki shill. But like I said, do you need to do Anki? No, plenty of people are posting great scores without it. The lesson is in having something you can consistently do throughout the year that keeps you engaged in your studies because you're not going to have time to re-learn everything before you take step 2.

Alright, let's talk about Obsidian now (and for all the Notion fans out there, I'm sure this would work for you guys as well). I started using Obsidian to catalog all of the UWorld tables and charts after my surgery score came out. I realized I needed some form of organization that I wasn't getting from anki or UWorld alone. During my Uworld sessions, I would screenshot the tables, charts, and graphs, and add them to a document--along with any little notes I gleaned from the answer explanation--which I'd hyperlink to my master document. For example, I'd create a document for shoulder dystocia, and link it to my Pediatric Master Document. Within the master docs I would organize the different files based on body systems or other categories. The beauty of this system is that as my year progressed, a lot of the documents would come back up. So in OBGYN, I could just open up my shoulder dystocia document and link it to my OBGYN master. This flexibility allowed me to interconnect several related concepts together as well, which I think is a component of effective learning, figuring out how things relate to one another.

After finishing my UWorld for each rotation, I would start my timed Amboss experience. While doing the new set of questions, I would mark the concepts in my Obsidian master files that came up. This would help me hone in on repeated concepts and ensure I had those locked in. While doing the Amboss questions, I would practice strategy heavily. I started to break down every question into its HPI components, which also helped tremendously with the HPI-formatted questions, as you'd imagine.

I'd start by glancing at answer choices to get a very rough idea of the question type. I'd then read the last sentence of the question to identify the exact thing the question is looking for. Next, I would scan up the question to the opening line, keeping track of the sections of the question. By the time I'd get to the start of the question, I'd have a rough idea of where the vitals, physical exam, imaging results, and PMHx were all located. I'd then read the first few sentences and convert it to 'monkey-brain' format in my head. Instead of thinking about all the nuances of the question stem, I'd be thinking about it in as simple terms as possible. IVDU + back pain? Okay, now go straight to vitals and look for SIRS.

For questions with lab values, I had a slightly different approach. I would start on the labs, first skimming from the bottom up and taking note of labs that aren't normally included. For example, why does this question include fractional excretion of sodium? I would then highlight all abnormal values (I downloaded an NBME lab value anki deck that I did throughout the year - this helped me quickly identify abnormal labs).

After finishing the amboss questions, I would look at how much time I'd need for the NBME questions. Before simulating the NBMEs with their questions, I would go through my Obsidian library, using the Feynman technique on as many of the concept documents I created as possible, focusing on the concepts that repeated in both qbanks. For those unfamiliar with the Feynman technique, it's basically teaching something in a way that a five-year-old could understand. So I would open a document, read through it, then blurt out a quick lesson to nobody that helped me capture the big picture of whatever the concept was about. The key here was being more focused on the big picture > nuanced details.

The last part of my prep before the shelf exams was doing the NBME practice forms and similarly marking the Obsidian concepts that came up. Surprise, surprise, they were mostly the ones I had already identified. I would do a passive review of the marked concepts in Obsidian the day before the shelf, and then take the night off.

# Step Prep:

So that pretty much covers my shelf prep throughout the year. Here's a little more about my timeline and why it was so time-crunched. You know how some organizations are well-oiled, efficient machines? Well, my school is definitely NOT one of those organizations, and I'm sure many of you out there feel the same way. After passing step 1, it took my school about 2.5 months to get my clinicals scheduled. As a result, I started my rotations in September and finished my cores at the end of July, and then proceeded directly into electives. To account for this, I knew I'd have to be as close to finished with all of UWorld by the time I got to my last rotation, which was psychiatry. This meant that during IM, I also did all the ambulatory questions. During surgery, I did the emergency questions. During OBGYN, I started doing the neuro questions. Family Med was nice because a lot of the concepts were covered in ambulaotry, so I started doing my psych and the step 2 specific questions here. With some time to spare in FM, I also redid my incorrects and marked questions.

Then, I started taking the CCSAs in psychiatry because my school requires us to take the CCSE to qualify for step, and I was trying to allow the ECFMG as much time to approve my application in a timely manner (spoiler: they didn't). My original plan was to go backwards from form 15 because I heard form 9 was hard, so I thought I'd use it as a last prep before my exam, but due to the way everything shook out, I only got down to form 10.

During my prep with the NBMEs, I would do them under test conditions. The following day, I'd review the form in its entirety, focusing on questions that I marked or missed. In Obsidian, I would add a screenshot of the question, and under it, I would do two things. First, I would write notes about my thought process and how to adjust my thinking to instead get the question correct. Second, I would link the relevant concepts from my accumulated library via hyperlinks. This made for very effective review when I was going through my NBMEs.

By focusing on my thought process instead of the raw knowledge, I began noticing problems in my testing strategy. I also created a couple of ""tenets"" that I would use to establish a framework for my approach to the exam. The first thing I noticed was that on nearly every question I was getting wrong, there was a single moment while answering where I was on the right track. That was reassuring because it told me that I could find a way to answer similar questions correctly in the future. I also noticed that, for my flagged questions, I was constantly changing questions from correct to incorrect. This led to my first tenant. If I wasn't sure about the answer, I would not change my answer, especially if I arrived at it by logic. The only exceptions would be if I noticed something different in the question stem or remembered something that changed my thought process. Otherwise, I WOULD NOT change my answers.

The second and third tenets I arrived at were 'Trust the Buzz' and 'What's the big picture?'. These really go hand in hand. You might have a question that has 3/4 of the buzzwords for pulmonary embolism, and then one weird lab value that makes you second guess everything. Do not second guess. You need to weigh the information on a scale, when 3/4 says PE and 1/4 says something else, TRUST THE BUZZ.

There is a sentiment out there that the USMLE is getting vaguer. My takeaway is that they are keeping the same concepts but disguising the buzzwords in a complex soup of lab values and weird tidbits. Focus on the big picture of the question, don't get lost in the sauce, and trust the buzz.

My fourth tenet was to follow a hierarchy of escalation. Basically, for each management question, I went into it with a bias for 'do nothing/conservative/observation'. This would force me to look for information in the question that would justify escalating my management, whether it was unstable vitals, concerning presentation (peritonitis), or something about the severity of the patient's experience. If the NBME describes something as mild, then it's probably not important. For example: patient has mild systolic murmur, well so do I. It's probably not important. On the other side: the patient is in severe pain. Well that sounds important, and we should probably do something more than just observe.

My fifth tenet was for ""what's the best step in diagnosis"" questions. For these, I thought about what would be the most specific test we could do. Oftentimes, there would be multiple tests that you would consider, but one would be far more specific to the disease in question. 9/10 times that would be the right answer. Other times, if a test was both diagnostic and therapeutic, this is very likely the answer they're looking for.

And my last tenant - what is the most logical answer? The step exams are screening tests, and what do they want? I imagine they want doctors who can fall back on their rational, logical thinking, especially in times of stress. So you might get this super complicated presentation, but it's supposed to be like that. Sometimes the answer really is get a CT, MRI, or biopsy.

A final strategy I started using, which was especially helpful for ethics, was weighing answer choices against one another. Sometimes I would be stuck on a question, but when I dissected the answer choices, I noticed that three answers were more or less saying the same thing, and then another choice was clearly going for something different. Pay close attention to these choices. Ask yourself, why is this answer so different?

# The Exam Permit Rigamarole:

So there it is. That is more or less my approach to scoring a 273 on Step 2. This approach proved to be very adaptable, which is justified by some ECFMG shenanigans. After I passed my CCSE, I was wasting away, just waiting on my ECFMG application to process so that I could get my permit and schedule my Step. By now, I was in my first elective. I was continuing to do NBMEs, making sure I was prepared for anything. I waited, and waited, and as I approached the two-month mark, I got a terrible email saying my ECFMG application was rejected. Turns out my school closed a campus down and declared last years graduating class as the last class from that campus. So, from the ECFMG's perspective, I went to a medical school that did not exist.

As luck would have it, all of this was happening on the very last day before ECFMG closed down to switch to MyInthealth. So guess who was running around like an idiot trying to get a new ECFMG application expedited? Right.

Fortunately, I was able to barely squeeze out my application, and the next day, I got my exam permit. The only problem was that the only available exam was, like, the very next day. This is why I didn't do NBME 9, nor the free 120s, nor the UWSAs. The universe said no.

# Test Day:

I spent the remainder of the day remaining calm and not freaking out in my apartment. I went to Trader Joes and bought a steak and avocado as well as sandwich supplies for a test day meal prep (protip: a ribeye steak and a ready avocado is an excellent breakfast before exams). I also bought a mexican coke and some cheese to power me through the back half of the test. All this to say that nutrition is an important piece of the puzzle. I've found that having complex carbs the night before, and starting the day with healthy(-ish) fats and proteins gives me a solid boost to the day. Then, as my energy wanes, I rely on rapid-acting carbs like sugar to power to the finish line. This was a recipe I arrived at over the course of my shelf exams. In reality, please experiment with what works for you. Don't follow my meal advice if you despise avocados or if you know you crash hard after eating sugar.

During the exam, I chose to do my first two blocks back to back. Then I'd take 5 or 10 minute breaks throughout the remainder of the day. I ended up having 15 minutes left before my last block, which I fully embraced in the comfort of my mexican coke. Here's another protip, bring a bottle opener so you're not like me, frantically opening a glass bottle with your short-ass car keys.

I was pleasantly surprised after the first block; I had time to review all my flags with more to spare. That quickly changed. From there on out, it was a battle. A battle that felt very similar to the NBMEs. A lot of uncertainty, a lot of unanswered questions I had to come back to. I had, on average, about 12 flags per block and 5 questions that I had to come back to because I left them unanswered. This is where my tenets really came into play. I relied on them heavily to dictate my approach, which freed me up for the more involved questions, such as the HPI-formatted ones.

# The Aftermath:

I say all this because I want to validate those out there that even strong scorers are pushed to their limits on these exams. During the test, I even missed one of the linked-pair questions, which I gave myself exactly 3 seconds to cry about. After the exam, I quickly identified several silly mistakes (why did I choose C-section instead of oxytocin, dammit!), but I felt fairly confident. Over the next four painful weeks, I've alternated between that confidence and existential dread. There has been no in between. To cope, I identified the 10-15 questions I knew for certain I had gotten wrong. Then whenever my mind would drift back to those silly mistakes, I'd remind myself that they were one of mistakes I already identified and move on with my day.

Now, after waiting for 4 weeks, I'm sitting caffeinated at my favorite coffee shop, procrastinating my ERAS application by working on this Reddit post. But I hope some of you can find some value in my experience. We're all on our journeys during these exams, but I want to remind you that with some preparation, persistence, and a little faith in yourself, you can achieve your goals. To everyone waiting on your scores, trust in your preparation and trust in your practice exams. For those of you who feel your scores aren't where you want them to be, take a step back and reflect. Think about your thought process and how you might adjust. Growth is about taking the lessons and integrating them; If I've learned anything over the last year, it's that. If you read this far, thanks for reading, and all the best--you got this!

TL;DR - I used ""the cards Anking Did""-tagged cards from the Anking deck, did Uworld in tutormode, Amboss on timed, and all the NBME CSA forms during rotations. I cataloged all the uworld tables and charts into Obsidian, and used that to review for my shelf exams. While not ground-breaking stuff, this allowed me to stay consistent during third year and forgo a typical dedicated period. It also put me in a position to score well despite having less than a day's notice to mentally prepare for my exam. When reviewing NBME CCSEs I focused on analyzing my thought process and creating a framework to use to answer the NBMEs questions.",2,1757619723.0,Step2,0,1.0,False

1neieuq,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMSEOServices/comments/1neieuq/the_complete_guide_to_local_seo_for_small/,The Complete Guide to Local SEO for Small Businesses in Scotland,"Local SEO isn’t about competing with Amazon or huge corporations.  
It’s about making sure people in your town or city can actually find you when they search for services like yours.

Whether you’re a café in Glasgow, a plumber in Dundee, or a solicitor in Edinburgh, the steps below can massively improve your online visibility without breaking the bank.

# 1. Why Local SEO Matters

Most small business websites don’t get national traffic — and they don’t need to. What they need is **local search visibility**.

When someone searches “plumber near me” or “SEO services Glasgow,” Google’s results are driven by **local intent**. The businesses that show up there aren’t always the biggest — they’re the ones that have optimised properly.

# 2. Google Business Profile Optimisation

Your Google Business Profile (GBP) is your digital shop window.  
To maximise it:

* Fill in **all fields**: services, products, hours, categories.
* Add **photos and videos** regularly.
* Use **Google Posts** weekly — treat it like a free micro-blog.
* Encourage **customer reviews** (and reply to every single one).

GBP signals are one of the **top ranking factors** for local SEO.

# 3. NAP Consistency and Local Citations

NAP = **Name, Address, Phone Number**.  
If your details don’t match across platforms (Yell, Yelp, FreeIndex, Nextdoor, etc.), Google loses trust.

* Audit your listings once a quarter.
* Fix any outdated phone numbers, opening times, or old addresses.
* Add yourself to **relevant Scottish directories** (local chambers, industry associations, etc.).

# 4. On-Page Location Signals

Don’t just optimise for “SEO services” — optimise for “SEO services Glasgow” or “SEO agency Scotland.”

Tips:

* Include your **location** in the title tag and H1.
* Add your **city or town name** in alt text and internal links.
* Write service pages tailored to **each location you serve**.

# 5. Reviews and Reputation Management

Local reviews do three things:

1. Build **trust with customers**.
2. Send **keyword signals** to Google (e.g., “Best SEO in Edinburgh”).
3. Improve **click-through rate** (people click the listings with stars).

Pro tip: Ask customers to mention the **service and city** in their review. Example: “GM SEO Services helped our Glasgow café website rank higher.”

# 6. Local Schema Markup

Schema is structured data that helps Google understand your business.

* Add `LocalBusiness` schema to your site.
* Include your **address, opening hours, geo-coordinates**.
* If you serve multiple areas, create structured data for each one.

This doesn’t guarantee rankings, but it improves **visibility in rich results**.

# 7. Local Backlinks

Not all backlinks are equal. For local SEO, **relevance > volume**.

Ways to build local backlinks:

* Sponsor a charity event in Glasgow → get a link from the event website.
* Partner with other businesses in Edinburgh → cross-link each other.
* Join Scottish business associations that list members.

Even a few high-quality local links can outweigh dozens of generic directory submissions.

# 8. Content That Serves Locals

Generic blog posts don’t help. What works is **locally focused content**. Examples:

* “The Top 10 Coffee Shops in Hamilton”
* “How to Choose the Right Accountant in Dundee”
* “A Complete Guide to SEO Services in Glasgow”

This kind of content attracts **shares, links, and local authority**.

# 9. Tracking and Auditing

Don’t just implement SEO and hope for the best — measure it.

* Use **Google Search Console** to track impressions and clicks.
* Check your **rankings for city + keyword combinations**.
* Audit your site quarterly.

I was homeschooled growing up and didn’t have any contact with the outside world until I went to high school. I graduated high-school.. At 18 I had 3 choices; (1) go to work, (2) rot in modern suburbia and kill myself with coffee and television (there are no jobs where my parents live and the closest city is over an hour away, (3) be homeless,, so I chose to work..

I worked in a casino where I was lied to about promotion opportunities, so I left casino. Then I got CDL and drove an 18-wheeler; was extremely isolated and stressed from driving 80 hours a week. Then I worked on a cargo ship and grocery store in Alaska; all whilst living in my car.. My parents allow me stay at their house; my mother lays in bed all day high on pills, she is obese and her skin is purple, she watches TV all day and I’m almost certain she’s dying.. My father is a construction worker, why? I’m not sure; he owns 5 rental houses and his net-worth is millions. He drinks like a fish and eats 5,000 calories a day in greasy mexican food. Neither of them have friends or active social lives and I often wonder why they exist

I have nobody.. I’ve been working since I was 18 being chewed up and used for labour by corporations. I have NO social skills and can’t talk to people. I was drunkenly conceived on a cruise ship in the bahamas and birthed into the world with absolutely no family, role-models or help from society. What do I do?? My main concern is that I’m lonely. Everyone has a family to go home to a night. I have a 2007 Lexus ES350 with a blanket. I’m considering joining the military. I’m so fucking tired. I need help for my social skills too, I’ve been in survival mode so long that I can’t seem to have genuine relations or connect with people. I also desire to have a girlfriend but that won’t happen unless I start working again but all the women I’ve ever dated only care about money.

1neic51,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1neic51/cleaning_fees_what_are_your_thoughts_asking_hosts/,Cleaning fees- what are your thoughts? Asking hosts and guests [USA],"As a co-host, I see posts on this sub with guests complaining about cleaning fees because they feel they've kept the space tidy. While it's certainly appreciated when guests keep things fairly tidy, wipe off kitchen counters, etc, there's a lot more to an Airbnb clean than having it just ""look"" clean. Post pandemic, standards have been raised. Cleaners are asked to wipe down light switches and door knobs and refrigerator handles every time they clean. And wipe down surfaces with disinfectant even if it looks spotless. I believe guests who complain about cleaning fees don't understand the labor & time required for Airbnb cleans. 

The following is what tasks are done during an Airbnb clean: 

All commonly used surfaces are wiped down with a disinfectant 
Dusting
Used bed linens & towels are washed,  folded, and beds are made
Sweep, mop, and/or vacuum the entire space
Clean mirrors 
Wash dishes and then put them away
Scrub the shower & bath, sinks, and toilets 
Wipe out the refrigerator, microwave, and clean the coffee maker

Even with the teeniest space, it's going to take at least an hour and a half to wash, dry, and fold the laundry while cleaning in between cycles. Lots of people hire folks to clean their airbnbs for them. And that cleaning fee goes to the person that cleans it as their pay. 

With the airbnbs that I co-host, we don't ask guests to do anything before checkout. I have occasionally asked guests to take out the trash if I knew it would be a couple of days before I could come clean the space. But I don't have them do laundry because they won't look for stains and pretreat the stains before washing them. I don't ask them to do dishes or even run the dishwasher because some guests do a poor job with this, and then the next guest finds a crusty spoon in the drawer and complains. And guests don't always remove the crusty dried food bits from dishes before they load them into the dishwasher, so the cleaner has to rewash a lot of the dishes that come out of the dishwasher anyway. Maybe I have trust issues. 

Anyway I would love to hear people's thoughts about this issue. ",4,1757619437.0,AirBnB,3,1.0,False

Coffee cups clatter, plates hit the counter, and over it all, [**Melissa Vaugh**](https://www.instagram.com/onehitwandawrir/)[**n**](https://www.instagram.com/onehitwandawrir/) is already in motion. Before we’ve even ordered our food, she’s out of her chair, greeting someone at the table next to us like a long-lost friend, leaning in to compliment another patron on their work. 

Melissa doesn’t just walk into a room, she expands it.

That presence has carried Richmond’s independent radio station, [**WRIR 97.3FM**](https://www.instagram.com/wrir97.3fm/), through some of its most precarious years. But as we sat down that day, Melissa, myself, and [**Bridé Baker**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bbakercopywritereditor/), who will be stepping into the role of executive director, there was an edge of gravity beneath her boundless energy. Melissa is facing down metastatic breast cancer, a fight that has spread into her liver, bones, and spine.

You’d never know it. She is quick with a joke, eager to lift up others, and relentless in her vision. “I live, eat, sleep, breathe WRIR,” she told me. “It’s been my life’s work.”

I’ve been testing this wood cleaner and furniture polish for a while now, and I must admit, it manages to raise its hand in a sea of wood-care products with some impressive qualities. This isn’t just your average spray; it’s marketed as an eco-friendly solution with cinnamon and lavender scents. It sounds almost spa-like for your furniture, which instantly grabbed me. But with products like these, I prefer to focus on what it really delivers rather than simply what’s written on the bottle.

**Design and Ease of Use**

I appreciate the user-friendly design of this product. The 16oz bottles are easy to handle, even during extensive cleaning sessions. The spray nozzle distributes the polish evenly, which cuts down on product wastage. It's compact enough to store conveniently yet lasts long enough to make you feel like you're getting value for your money. The Cinnamon & Lavender scent was undoubtedly my favorite feature in this regard. Unlike the harsh chemical smells I’ve encountered with other products, this left the room feeling cozy and pleasant, which was almost as satisfying as seeing the wood surfaces gleam.

**Effectiveness in Restoring Wood**

What truly stood out was how well it revitalized my older furniture. A tired looking rocking chair was my first guinea pig, and the results? Remarkable. It not only restored a soft, warm glow but added a wax-like shine. The product also brought back some life to my kitchen cupboards and banisters, making them shimmer like polished gems under the light. I think antique lovers would particularly enjoy this wood polish. Items like grandfather clocks, wooden record players, or even those vintage coffee tables our grandparents used to have could get an instant facelift. It’s also worth mentioning that the polish doesn’t feel overly greasy once applied—a huge bonus!

**Good Points**

- Sweet Cinnamon & Lavender aroma creates a comfortable cleaning experience.
- Makes older wooden furniture appear polished and new with minimal effort. 
- Eco-friendly composition uses plant-derived ingredients, which is great for homes with children or pets.
- Leaves a waxy shine that enhances the beauty of cupboards, flooring, and countertops.
- Spray nozzle ensures perfect distribution, reducing chances of overuse.

**Negatives**

- While the scent is a top highlight for many users, those sensitive to smells might find it slightly overpowering.
- It doesn't completely get rid of deeply embedded stains in wood, which might require specialized products.
- The spray leaves a thin residue initially, requiring proper buffing to ensure no streaks remain.

**For Best Results**

In testing, I followed the recommended usage instructions closely. Spraying a modest amount onto wooden surfaces, letting it sit for a moment, and wiping it off with a microfiber cloth seemed to be the trick. It made everything significantly smoother to the touch, giving the impression that the wood was not only cleaned but also conditioned. The surfaces gleamed without appearing overly glossy, which kept the finish natural.

**Competing Products**

Comparing this polish to other big players in the wood-care category, it holds its ground. There are competitors primarily focused on grease-cutting, while this one serves a more multipurpose role by cleaning and beautifying simultaneously. For instance, other brands might have similar scents or eco-friendliness claims but often fail on shine consistency. However, I did find that Better Life 24193 struggles with deeply ingrained grime compared to heavy-duty wood cleaners. But for daily maintenance or moderate cleaning jobs, it’s hard to beat the mild yet effective formula of this product.

**Bang for the Buck**

From my perspective, it offers solid value for money, considering it’s more than just a cleaner. It polishes, gives off a pleasant aroma, and takes eco-consciousness into account. There are definitely cheaper options out there, but they may lack the multi-functionality or natural ingredient focus. In this case, it feels like you’re truly investing in a product that maintains the integrity of your furniture over time rather than just masking issues temporarily. Plus, the added bonus of not exposing your indoor air to industrial chemicals adds a layer of peace of mind.

As a Canadian expat (originally from Toronto, eh?), I'd hit burnout hard after a decade in finance. One impulsive trip to Mexico City later, and I was hooked.

 Fast-forward to me packing up and landing in Colonia Anáhuac – a hidden gem tucked away in Miguel Hidalgo CDMX, just a stone's throw from Polanco's chic vibes but without the touristy frenzy. My spot? A sleek, sun-drenched apartment at Torre Unión (ZIP 11320 for the map enthusiasts). We're talking floor-to-ceiling windows that frame epic sunsets over the city skyline, a modern kitchen where I perfected my mole sauce experiments, and a floor-to-ceiling window perfect for morning coffee while watching the neighborhood wake up. The building's got all the perks: 24/7 security, a rooftop terrace for my morning yoga, and proximity to everything – Reforma for work commutes, Chapultepec Park for weekend escapes, and enough hip cafes and markets to keep even the pickiest foodie happy.

Living here transformed me. I swapped suits for “Playeras”, learned to salsa (badly, but enthusiastically), and built a crew of fellow expats from the US, Europe, and beyond. We'd hit up local spots like the nearby La Comer for fresh produce or cruise to Masaryk Avenue in Polanco for some window shopping. Anáhuac feels like that sweet spot – upscale and safe, yet authentically Mexican with street vendors slinging elotes right outside. No more freezing winters or soul-crushing commutes; just pure, unfiltered joy in a city that pulses with energy.

 But alas, life throws curveballs. A new job opportunity back home (family ties, you know?) means I'm heading north sooner than expected. It's bittersweet – this place isn't just walls and a roof; it's been my launchpad for adventures, from day trips to Teotihuacán to late-night mezcal tastings.

1nei4fn,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1nei4fn/a_guide_to_reclaiming_comfort_and_joy_reviving/,A Guide to Reclaiming Comfort and Joy: Reviving the Brain's Positive Circuits After Complex Trauma,"For individuals who have endured complex post-traumatic stress disorder (c-PTSD), the default state can often be one of physical and emotional pain. The brain, in its effort to protect, can become wired to anticipate threat, making it difficult to find comfortable body postures, access positive memories, or cultivate a hopeful outlook. However, a growing body of knowledge in neuroscience and trauma therapy offers established methods to gently and effectively rewire these neural pathways. This guide provides an overview of these techniques, offering practical tools for self-help and a deeper understanding of the healing process.


The Neurological Impact of c-PTSD: Why Comfort and Positivity Feel Elusive
Complex trauma reshapes the brain's architecture and functioning. Key areas are particularly affected, creating a predisposition towards a threat-based internal landscape:
 * The Amygdala: This almond-shaped structure, the brain's ""smoke detector,"" becomes hyper-vigilant in c-PTSD. It is quick to perceive danger, triggering the fight-flight-freeze response, and can have difficulty distinguishing between past threats and present safety. This contributes to a constant sense of unease and a bias towards negative associations.
 * The Hippocampus: Crucial for memory formation and retrieval, the hippocampus can be compromised by chronic stress. This can lead to fragmented and disorganized traumatic memories that intrude on the present, while making it more challenging to voluntarily recall positive or neutral memories.
 * The Prefrontal Cortex (PFC): The ""thinking"" part of the brain, responsible for emotional regulation, planning, and self-awareness, can become underactive in response to a hyperactive amygdala. This makes it difficult to calm down, think clearly in moments of distress, and intentionally shift focus to more positive states.
 * Altered Interoception: C-PTSD can disrupt interoception, the sense of the internal state of the body. This can manifest as either a hyper-awareness of uncomfortable physical sensations (pain, tension) or a numbness and disconnection from the body, making it hard to recognize and respond to signals of comfort and well-being.
The goal of healing is not to erase the past, but to create new neural pathways that allow for a greater capacity for comfort, positive emotions, and a sense of a future worth living. This is achieved through the brain's inherent neuroplasticity – its ability to change and adapt based on new experiences.


Therapeutic Approaches That Pave the Way for Positive Rewiring
Several therapeutic modalities have proven effective in addressing the neurological underpinnings of c-PTSD and fostering the capacity for positive experiences. Understanding these can inform and empower self-help practices.
 * Somatic Experiencing (SE): Developed by Dr. Peter Levine, SE focuses on the body's stored trauma. It helps individuals gently release trapped survival energy and develop a greater tolerance for physical sensations. A key principle is ""pendulation,"" the practice of shifting attention between a resource (a place of safety or comfort in the body) and a place of discomfort, gradually expanding the capacity to stay present with and resolve traumatic activation.
 * Mindfulness-Based Interventions: Practices like Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness meditation cultivate non-judgmental awareness of the present moment. For trauma survivors, this can be a powerful tool for learning to observe thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations without being overwhelmed by them. It strengthens the prefrontal cortex's ability to regulate the amygdala.
 * Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR): EMDR therapy helps the brain process and integrate traumatic memories in a way that reduces their emotional charge. A crucial part of the EMDR protocol involves ""installing"" positive beliefs and future-oriented templates, actively creating new, more adaptive neural networks.
 * Neurofeedback: This therapeutic approach uses real-time displays of brain activity to teach self-regulation of brain function. By receiving feedback, individuals can learn to increase brainwave patterns associated with calm and focus, and decrease those linked to hyperarousal and anxiety, directly influencing the activity of the amygdala and prefrontal cortex.






Self-Help Toolkit: Reviving Your Brain's Capacity for Comfort and Positivity
The principles behind these therapies can be adapted into a consistent self-help practice. The key is to approach these exercises with patience, self-compassion, and a gentle curiosity.
I. Reconnecting with a Comfortable Body: Cultivating Positive Interoception
The journey towards positive internal states often begins with the body. The goal is to gradually shift the brain's focus from pain and tension to neutrality and even pleasure.
 * The ""Resource Spot"" Exercise (inspired by Somatic Experiencing):
   * Find a quiet place to sit or lie down.
   * Gently scan your body for a place that feels neutral, calm, or even slightly pleasant. It could be the weight of your body on the chair, the feeling of your feet on the floor, or the warmth in your hands.
   * Once you find this ""resource spot,"" let your attention rest there for a few moments. Notice the physical sensations in detail.
   * If your attention is pulled to a place of discomfort, gently acknowledge it and then guide your focus back to your resource spot.
   * Practice this for short periods, gradually increasing the duration as it feels comfortable.


 * Mindful Body Scan for Pleasant Sensations:
   * Lie down comfortably and bring your attention to your breath.
   * Instead of searching for pain, intentionally scan your body for any sensations of ease, warmth, or relaxation.
   * Perhaps you notice the softness of your clothing against your skin, the feeling of the air on your face, or a lack of tension in your fingers.
   * Savor any small pockets of comfort you find, allowing them to be your focus for a few breaths.


 * Polyvagal-Informed Exercises for Safety: The polyvagal theory highlights the importance of the vagus nerve in regulating our social engagement system and feelings of safety.
   * Humming or Chanting: The vibrations from humming or chanting can stimulate the vagus nerve, sending calming signals to the brain.
   * The ""Voo"" Sound: Take a deep breath and as you exhale, make a low, vibrating ""voo"" sound. This can be very grounding and calming.
   * Gentle Self-Hold: Place one hand on your heart and the other on your belly. The gentle pressure and warmth can be very regulating for the nervous system.










II. Cultivating Positive Memories and Associations in the Amygdala
The amygdala learns through association. By intentionally pairing positive experiences with a state of calm, you can begin to create new, positive neural pathways.
 * Savoring Positive Moments:
   * Throughout your day, make a conscious effort to notice small, positive experiences – the taste of your morning coffee, the warmth of the sun, a kind word from a friend.
   * Pause for a moment and fully experience the pleasant sensations associated with that moment.
   * Try to hold the positive feeling for 15-30 seconds, allowing it to ""soak in.""
 * ""Installing"" a Positive Resource (inspired by EMDR):
   * Think of a memory of a time you felt safe, peaceful, or joyful. It doesn't have to be a major event.
   * Bring the image of that memory to mind. What did you see? What did you hear? What did you feel in your body?
   * As you hold this positive memory, you can try a form of bilateral stimulation, such as slowly tapping your knees or shoulders, alternating left and right. This can help to strengthen the positive memory network.
 * Affective Labeling: Naming your emotions can help to regulate them. When you experience a positive feeling, consciously label it: ""This is contentment,"" ""I feel a sense of ease,"" or ""This is joy."" This practice strengthens the prefrontal cortex's ability to recognize and categorize positive states.















III. Fostering Positive Daydreaming and a Hopeful Future
For those with c-PTSD, the future can feel like a blank or threatening space. Reclaiming the ability to imagine a positive future is a vital part of healing.
 * Positive Constructive Daydreaming:
   * Set aside a few minutes each day in a comfortable and safe space.
   * Allow your mind to wander to pleasant thoughts or images. This could be a favorite place in nature, a cherished memory, or an imagined scenario where you feel happy and at ease.
   * The key is to keep it gentle and not to force it. If distressing thoughts arise, gently guide your mind back to your positive daydream.


 * ""Best Possible Self"" Exercise:
   * Take some time to journal or reflect on a future where you have achieved your goals and are living a life that is meaningful to you.
   * Imagine this future in as much detail as possible. What are you doing? Who are you with? How do you feel in your body and mind?
   * This exercise helps to create a ""blueprint"" for a positive future in your brain, making it feel more attainable.


 * Guided Imagery for a Positive Future:
   * You can find many guided imagery scripts online that are designed to help you visualize a positive and hopeful future. Look for scripts that focus on themes of safety, peace, and empowerment.












IV. Nurturing a Compassionate Inner Voice
The internal critic can be very strong in individuals with c-PTSD. Cultivating a compassionate inner voice is essential for creating a sense of inner safety.
 * Compassionate Letter Writing:
   * Write a letter to yourself from the perspective of a wise and compassionate friend.
   * In this letter, acknowledge your struggles and pain with kindness and understanding.
   * Offer yourself words of encouragement and support.

 * Self-Compassion Break (Dr. Kristin Neff): In moments of difficulty, pause and say to yourself:
   * ""This is a moment of suffering."" (Mindfulness)
   * ""Suffering is a part of life."" (Common Humanity)
   * ""May I be kind to myself in this moment."" (Self-Kindness)










A Gentle and Patient Approach
It is crucial to remember that healing from c-PTSD is a marathon, not a sprint. There will be good days and difficult days. The key is consistency and self-compassion. Start with the exercises that feel most accessible and practice them for short periods. Over time, these small, intentional acts of self-care will help to revive the brain's natural capacity for comfort, joy, and a hopeful orientation towards the future. If you are struggling, seeking the guidance of a trauma-informed therapist can provide invaluable support and direction on your healing journey.

Meanwhile, your actual work sits untouched, and that important project deadline looms closer. Sound familiar?

What if you could send an intelligent AI agent to handle some of these meetings for you? Not just a passive recorder, but an active participant that can conduct interviews, answer questions, provide training, and even negotiate on your behalf?

**Welcome to the future of meetings with Tough Tongue AI’s Google Meet Agent.**

# What Makes This Revolutionary?

Unlike traditional meeting bots that merely transcribe, Tough Tongue AI agents are **active participants**. They can:

1. **Conduct interviews** with candidates when you’re double-booked
2. **Present informatio**n using visual cards and diagrams in real-time
3. **Handle sales calls** with product knowledge and objection handling
4. **Deliver training sessions** with interactive whiteboards
5. **Screen customers** and collect valuable data
6. **Negotiate deals** following your specific guidelines

The best part? Setting this up takes less than 5 minutes. Let’s walk through it.

# The 3-Step Process: Simpler Than Ordering Coffee

# Step 1: Define Your Agent’s Mission (2 minutes)

First, you create a “scenario” — think of it as your agent’s playbook. Head to the [scenario creator](https://app.toughtongueai.com/advanced-scenario-create/?isPublic=false) and describe what you want your agent to do.

**Example scenarios you can create:**

1. “You are a technical recruiter screening candidates for a senior engineering position”
2. “You are a sales representative demonstrating our SaaS product to potential customers”
3. “You are a training coordinator conducting onboarding sessions for new employees”

The platform’s AI understands natural language, so just write as if you’re briefing a human colleague. No coding, no complex configurations — just plain English instructions.

# Step 2: Choose How Your Agent Joins (1 minute)

Navigate to your [Library](https://app.toughtongueai.com/library/) → Select your scenario → Click “Meeting Bot”

You have two incredibly simple options:

# Option A: Custom Meeting Mode (For Specific Meetings)

Perfect for that surprise meeting that just popped up:

1. Paste the Google Meet link
2. Set when the bot should join
3. Click “Deploy”

That’s it. Your agent will join at the specified time and handle the meeting according to your scenario.

# Option B: Calendar Integration Mode (Set It and Forget It)

For recurring meeting types:

1. Connect your Google Calendar (one-time setup)
2. Add a keyword filter (e.g., “screening” or “training”)
3. Your agent automatically joins any meeting with that keyword

Imagine never missing another candidate screening because you’re in another meeting. Your AI agent handles it professionally while you focus on high-priority tasks.

# Step 3: Let Your Agent Work Its Magic

Once deployed, your agent:

1. ✅ Joins the meeting on time
2. ✅ Introduces itself professionally
3. ✅ Follows your scenario instructions precisely
4. ✅ Uses rich tools (whiteboard, visual cards, diagrams) when needed
5. ✅ Records and analyzes the conversation
6. ✅ Provides you with detailed debriefs and insights

# Real-World Magic: See It in Action

Let me paint you a picture of what this looks like in practice:

**Scenario**: You’re a startup founder who needs to screen 15 sales candidates this week, but you’re also closing a funding round.

**Traditional approach**: Cancel meetings, work evenings, or rush through screenings.

**With Tough Tongue AI**:

1. Create one screening scenario (3 minutes)
2. Schedule all 15 meetings
3. Deploy your agent to each
4. Review AI-generated analysis and recordings at your convenience
5. Only meet personally with the top 3 candidates

**Time saved**: 12+ hours. **Stress reduced**: Immeasurable.

# The Secret Sauce: Rich Interactive Capabilities

What separates Tough Tongue AI from basic meeting bots is its **multimodal intelligence**. Your agent doesn’t just talk; it:

1. Creates visual explanations on the fly
2. Sketches on a digital whiteboard
3. Writes and reviews code (for technical interviews)
4. Generates diagrams and flowcharts
5. Reads body language and tone (when video is enabled)
6. Uses advanced reasoning to handle unexpected questions

This isn’t a scripted chatbot — it’s a thinking, adapting representative that maintains your professional standards.

# Common Use Cases That Will Transform Your Work

# 1. Recruitment at Scale

Deploy agents to conduct initial screenings, technical assessments, and even coding interviews. The agent can share code editors, review solutions in real-time, and provide detailed candidate evaluations.

# 2. Sales Automation

Your agent can handle discovery calls, product demos, and follow-ups. It knows your product inside-out and can handle objections just like your best sales rep.

# 3. Training and Onboarding

Create standardized training sessions that your agent can deliver consistently. New employees get the same high-quality experience whether it’s their first day or the company’s 100th hire.

# 4. Customer Support

Handle routine support calls, troubleshooting sessions, and product walkthroughs without tying up your support team.

# 5. Vendor Management

Let your agent handle initial vendor conversations, requirement gathering, and even preliminary negotiations.

# The Technical Details (For the Curious)

Under the hood, Tough Tongue AI uses:

1. **Dual AI architecture**: A low-latency conversational model for smooth interaction + a heavyweight reasoning model for complex tasks
2. **12-minute guaranteed sessions**: With automatic failover and retry mechanisms
3. **Multimodal processing**: Understanding voice, tone, and visual cues
4. **Real-time tool access**: Whiteboard, code editor, visual cards, and more
5. **Comprehensive analytics**: Full transcripts, insights, and actionable feedback

# Getting Started Today (It’s Free!)

Here’s the best part: Through August 2025, this feature is **completely free** for all Tough Tongue AI users. You only consume your existing platform minutes.

4. Experience the future of meetings

# Pro Tips for Maximum Impact

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with one type of meeting (e.g., initial screenings) before expanding
2. **Iterate Your Scenarios**: Refine your agent’s instructions based on meeting outcomes
3. **Use Keywords Wisely**: In calendar mode, choose specific keywords to avoid accidental deployments
4. **Review and Learn**: Use the analysis features to improve both your agent and your own meeting skills
5. **Combine with Human Touch**: Use agents for initial meetings, then personally handle high-value conversations

# The Future of Work Is Here

We’re not talking about replacing human connection — we’re talking about **multiplying your presence** for meetings that don’t require your unique human touch. Save your energy for the conversations that truly matter while your AI agent handles the routine, the repetitive, and the time-consuming.

In a world where time is our most precious resource, Tough Tongue AI’s Google Meet Agent isn’t just a tool — it’s your professional superpower. It’s the difference between being overwhelmed by meetings and being strategically present where you matter most.

# FAQs

**Q: Can people tell it’s an AI agent?** A: Yes, the agent introduces itself transparently. This is by design — transparency builds trust.

**Q: What if something goes wrong in the meeting?** A: The meeting host can remove the agent at any time. All sessions are recorded for review.

**Q: Is my data secure?** A: Absolutely. Tough Tongue AI follows enterprise-grade security protocols and data privacy standards.

**Q: Can it handle multiple people talking?** A: The agent works best with one speaker at a time but can manage multi-person meetings.

**Q: Which platforms are supported?** A: Currently Google Meet, with Zoom and Microsoft Teams coming soon.

# Ready to Transform Your Meeting Life?

Stop letting meetings control your calendar. With Tough Tongue AI’s Google Meet Agent, you can be in multiple places at once, maintain consistent quality across all interactions, and focus your personal attention where it creates the most value.

The future of meetings isn’t about having more of them — it’s about having the right ones with the right presence, whether that’s you or your incredibly capable AI representative.

1nehy3y,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlchemyBeauty/comments/1nehy3y/reveal_if_the_best_chandelier_cleaner_from/,Reveal if the Best Chandelier Cleaner from Berkland Really Works,"I’ve been tackling chandelier and glass cleaning for years, and let me just say, the Berkland ChandelierCleaner has been an absolute game-changer. With its innovative drip-dry formula and surprising ease of use, this product has redefined how I approach cleaning intricate crystal pieces. From the moment I first used it, I could see why so many people are raving about it in the reviews—even if there are a few quirks worth mentioning.

**Effortless Cleaning for Hard-to-Reach Fixtures**  
Cleaning a chandelier can feel like gym day, especially when you’re balancing on a ladder armed with rags and cleaning sprays. This product eliminates the need for all that. The tension in my shoulders melted away as I simply sprayed it on, sat down, and let it do all the work. With a reach of up to 25 feet, I didn’t even need to disassemble my fixtures. It saved me a lot of stress, not to mention the dread of accidentally breaking something priceless.

**Streak-Free Brilliance That’s Insta-Worthy**  
If you’ve ever spent hours wiping down glass and brass surfaces, only to turn around and see streaks glaring back at you, you’ll understand the joy this cleaner brings. It leaves an immaculate finish without requiring me to polish afterward. My chandeliers sparkled with a brilliance I’d only seen in luxury showrooms. Perfect for glass furniture, too, by the way—it really delivers that showroom shine with ease.  

[Check Berkland ChandelierCleaner price on Amazon.](https://stylistexperts.com/p/b0dhxxj9dn/)  

**Gentle Yet Effective Formula**  
What really stood out to me is the product’s biodegradable, non-toxic formulation. As someone who values eco-friendly, safe solutions, I appreciated knowing that I wasn’t introducing harsh chemicals into my home environment. The cleaner worked wonders on delicate crystal pieces without causing damage or discoloration, and I didn’t have to deal with lingering chemical odors afterward. It made cleaning thoroughly enjoyable—if that’s even possible.  

**Perfect for Busy People (or Procrastinators Like Me)**  
Prolonged clean-ups can feel daunting, but this product’s simplicity means no more excuses for putting off the task. Using the 32oz bottle, I quickly noticed that not much was needed to cover a considerable area. I cleaned two chandeliers and several glass coffee tables with it, and I still had plenty left for future use. Honestly, it’s one of those rare cleaning products that delivers on both convenience and long-term utility.

**Highlights**  
- Sprays up to 25 feet, making it ideal for hard-to-reach spots.  
- No wiping necessary—just spray and let it work.  
- Leaves a dazzling, streak-free finish on crystal, glass, and brass surfaces.  
- Safe and biodegradable formula that’s gentle on surfaces and eco-friendly.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The spray nozzle isn't as precise as I’d like for smaller or intricate items, so I had to be careful with where I applied it.  
- Some stubborn grime (like candle wax drips or years-old dust buildup) might need a second application to become fully spotless.  
- Despite its ease of use, the bottle design could be improved—my hand felt fatigued after multiple prolonged sprays.  

**Competing Products**  
While there are other glass and chandelier cleaners on the market, few stack up to the ease of a no-wipe formula. For instance, regular glass cleaners require a ton of scrubbing and can leave streaks, while another cleaner I tried, one marketed as a luxury brand, didn’t offer the same spray radius. Competitors like Windex work fine for surface-level dirt but lack the deep-cleaning power and no-drip magic that the Berkland spray delivers. One other product I tried did something similar, but its strong chemical smell was unbearable, making this product far superior in terms of safety and comfort.

**Value for Money**  
Considering how much time and effort it saves, this cleaner feels like an excellent investment. Similar products might promise a streak-free finish, but none have matched this level of convenience. The fact that it’s non-toxic and biodegradable only sweetens the deal. If keeping your chandeliers spotless sounds like a headache, this cleaner is absolutely worth checking out.

My dentist says my other teeth and gums are in good shape -- I lost my missing teeth a decade ago for unrelated reasons. 

Is it my tap water? Something about my mouth chemistry? It kind of ruins the invisibility to have the clasp starting to look yellowish against my gum, which is why I got this kind in the first place.

In my 9-5 job, I'm working in tech as a data analyst/data engineer so I have the turtleneck. Unfortunately I can't beat the corporate allegations😂. I do enjoy working in London but I can see myself worling abroad one day for sure. The opportunity to experience new things appeals to me and I'm learning Spanish as well🇪🇸.

In the near future, I'm planning to go on holiday✈️ so I would love to have some recommendations for travel destinations. At the moment, I have Amsterdam🇳🇱, Sarajevo🇧🇦 and Porto🇵🇹 on my list.

1nehlki,https://www.reddit.com/r/CleanSweepers/comments/1nehlki/reveal_the_truth_about_biobag_compost_bags_are/,Reveal the Truth About BioBag Compost Bags Are They Worth It,"The BioBag (USA) product, specifically their Original Compostable Bag in a 3-gallon size, has become a staple in my kitchen routine. These compostable bags have transformed how I handle kitchen waste, from food scraps to tiny bits of debris. Testing them daily has given me a good grasp of their unique features and areas where they shine or stumble. If sustainable living is your goal, this product is worth a closer look.

**Thoughtful Design and Functionality**  
One of the first things I noticed about these bags is their thoughtful design. Measuring 16.9 inches by 17.7 inches, they fit snugly into most kitchen composting bins or pails without slipping or sagging. Their 0.64-mil thickness adds a decent layer of durability. Although they feel thinner than traditional plastic bags, I found that they held up remarkably well when full of food scraps or damp materials. There’s no frustrating tearing, provided you’re not overloading them with overly sharp or heavy items. And for people like me who honestly hate scrubbing compost bins, these bags do a stellar job of keeping everything clean and contained.

**Highlights**  
- Made from natural components like plant starches and vegetable oils  
- Fully certified compostable according to ASTM D6400 Standards  
- Fits most kitchen compost bins effortlessly  
- Manufactured in the USA using imported Italian resin  
- Helps reduce micro-plastic pollution in soil  

[Check if BioBag (USA) The Original Compostable Bag is the right fit for your home.](https://app.womanreview.com/p/b009nmspoe/)  

**Eco-Friendliness at Its Core**  
Environmental sustainability is the main selling point here, and these bags do not disappoint. Unlike traditional plastic bags that end up in landfills for centuries, BioBag compostable bags break down efficiently in backyard compost systems. They’re even certified by the Compost Manufacturing Alliance (CMA), meaning they’ve been tested to ensure real-world compostability. I loved how using these bags felt like a small but impactful step toward a greener lifestyle. Tossing these into my home compost pile, I could see them start to degrade visibly in about a month. It’s empowering to know I’m not generating unnecessary plastic waste.

**Durability and Usability**  
Durability is often a concern with compostable bags, and I approached this product with some skepticism. To my surprise, the bags performed well during daily use. They can handle the weight of fruit peels, coffee grounds, and even wetter scraps without leaking. One day, I dumped a whole casserole dish’s worth of leftovers into a bag to test its tear resistance—it survived. That said, they aren’t indestructible; sharp bones or jagged shells can puncture them. So while they’re tough for compost bags, they still require a bit of care.

**Upsides**  
- Frustration-free sustainable packaging  
- Reduce waste naturally while maintaining clean bins  
- Help promote zero-waste kitchen practices  

**Limitations**  
- Prone to tearing with sharp or heavy objects  
- Must be stored in cool, dry conditions to prevent premature degradation  

**Market Rivals**  
Comparing these to other biodegradable or compostable bags, BioBag stands out in reliability and true eco-friendliness. Some competitors claim to be biodegradable but fail to meet ASTM D6400 Standards, which determines proper compostability. Products like If You Care Compost Bags are decent alternatives but feel flimsier under stress. Regular trash bags marketed as “eco-friendly” usually contain only partial plant-based content or degrade into micro-plastics—not ideal. One feature where BioBag dominates is their compatibility with backyard composting systems, which some rival brands can’t consistently guarantee.

**Value for Money**  
Given the balance of durability, eco-friendliness, and functionality, these bags offer excellent cost performance. Yes, they are pricier than standard plastic bags, but when you factor in their compostability and environmental benefits, they’re worth the investment. I’d say for households focused on sustainability, they deliver considerable value for the price. If all it takes to reduce your ecological footprint is swapping traditional bags for something like this product, then why not? The long-term benefits far outweigh the initial cost.

1nehiot,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1nehiot/am_i_being_used_financially_in_this_relationship/,Am I being used financially in this relationship?,"I’m in a situation with a girl I met on Facebook Dating and I’m not sure if I’m being used or if I’m overreacting.

I’m 24, she’s 27. She just moved from another state after breaking up with her ex. We matched, went on a date, and started seeing each other casually. Sometimes she stays at my apartment for a week at a time since she doesn’t have a job.

Lately, she’s been constantly talking about her financial issues, saying she doesn’t want to move back to her state. From what I understand, the only reason she would stay here is if I let her live with me and cover everything because she doesn’t want a job. She’s mentioned she likes a man to take care of everything so she can stay home and “work on her passion,” though she hasn’t done much toward that passion.

I’ve always been the one taking her out on dates, paying for things, and doing stuff for her. She won’t even pay for something small like a $5 coffee, saying she never paid for anything with her ex.

Things have been rocky too. We’ve had fights, and sometimes she’ll go out with other guys like the time she went to a restaurant with a guy she met while we were still together. Recently, after a disagreement, she downloaded a dating app and texted guys in front of me, then deleted it minutes later, apologizing.

She says she likes me, wants to have kids with me, but it feels like she’s using me financially. I’m confused am I being unreasonable for feeling this way? Is this relationship healthy, or am I just being taken advantage of?",4,1757617532.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False

But as i was going to the store to pick up the order this bicycle dasher thought it was a good idea to run red light and I had the green light going 35 and i hit him.

If it was my other car which is a 2019 I would be alittle upset but im more worried about is he ok. But I did to check up on him he got mad talking about i need to pay more attention and that he gonna sue me and started calling me names. Luckily for me I had whitneses that told the police no he was the one at fault and I had the green light.

1nehfzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/1nehfzx/my_love_for_fallout/,My love for Fallout... 😍,"Let me just say that the first ever Fallout game I played was Fallout 4 and I absolutely loved it. Everything about that game was amazing for me as it was my introduction to the world. From the exploration, to the amount of options the players can make, to the seemingly endless ways to interact with the environment, to the Lore, the creatures that spawned as a result of the experiments that Vault Tec done and as a result of the bombs being dropped, and the overall interconnectedness of everything. It left a huge mark on me. I'm even contemplating doing another playthrough so that I can go with different options this time. I played Fallout Shelter which is not much but it filled the void as well. I played Fallout 76 which I loved, despite the criticisms it's received and the recent improvement 😍. When I eventually build a gaming pc or have a gaming laptop I will play Fallout 2 and Fallout 3, and I hear that Fallout 3 is an extremely good game as well.

Eventually I found YouTube creators who make Fallout Lore videos and let me tell you that I have been binge watching them so that I put together the pieces of the puzzle called Fallout. 

What I would like or rather a selfish wish that we all want is the Fallout games to follow, to maybe explore the other countries of the world and explain how they currently live in this post-apocolyptic world. I am from Africa, South Africa to be exact, so I don't know if the Fallout world has reached any parts of Africa. 

Just to wrap up this post, the world of Fallout is awesome. I have yet to come across anything similar that will have me so hooked into. I'm even considering getting Fallout merch like a coffee mug or key chains or some cool shit you know 😂

I am a 31M, solo traveler. Planning on hitting Cappodocia and Pamukkale before ending the trip in Istanbul for 6 nights. Of course, I want to do all the touristy things within the city, but since I have a lot of time I would also like to immerse myself in local culture/food/art/coffee/etc as much as possible. I would like to be in bustling areas, proximity to water is not important for me (other than taking a ferry to another location).

Reading through reddit threads and websites, seems like it would be best to split my stay in Istanbul into 2 locations. Top choices appear to be Sultanahmet, Karaköy (Beyoğlu), and Kadıköy. I know all have the pros/cons, but are there other areas I should be thinking of? If I stay in Sultanahmet, could I hit all the major stuff in Karakoy, so should plan on doing the last 3 nights in a new area entirely?

1nehcpq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/1nehcpq/ethiopian_airlines_was_an_experience/,Ethiopian Airlines was an experience,"I flew JRO-YYZ in business class with Ethiopian Airlines and boy, was it an experience. The route was JRO-ADD then ADD-YYZ with a stopover in FCO for refueling.

JRO-ADD was fine. I got to JRO 3h in advance and it took close to 2.5h to print my boarding pass, clear customs, and clear security. Everything moved extremely slowly. The JRO lounge was much more air conditioned than the rest of the airport and it was surprisingly decent.

The lounge in ADD was also very nice. Two separate buffets were provided along with an Ethiopian coffee demonstration, and it was very spacious. Everything went great up until I left the lounge.

There was a separate security screening for my gate in ADD. Not a big deal, but it was the third time I'd gone through security that day so I was a bit annoyed. The gate agents started boarding us, on time, but we ended up just standing in the walkway for 30 minutes (didn't even make it onto the plane) before staff told us to return to the waiting area because the plane had mechanical issues. Reboarding started an hour later and it was complete chaos. No zones were called, people crawled under the stanchion to jump ahead, everyone pushed and shoved. There was no semblance of a line. A bunch of wheelchair passengers, who didn't board with us the first time, randomly joined the flight. Gate staff had to scramble to get them onto the plane before the hordes ran them over. 

The flight was delayed 2.5h at ADD, one hour of which the plane just sat on the runway fully boarded with doors open. The AC was off while waiting on the runway and it was insanely hot inside. Flight attendants served cold drinks but it didn't help much. My entertainment system didn't work either. My screen alternated between ""Your Entertainment System Will Load Shortly"", ""Android_"", and ""System Upgrading"". My neighbour's system worked, but their clock was running on some made up time zone.

The bathrooms didn't work either. My neighbour was the first person to use the bathrooms on our flight. They found the toilet in both business class bathrooms to be clogged, one with toilet paper and the other with poop. The plane obviously hadn't been cleaned after the last flight. My neighbour notified the flight attendants of the toilet issue well before we took off, but nothing was done. There were no functioning toilets in business class until we got to FCO, 6h later. 

The FCO stop was only supposed to be an hour long for refueling. This turned into a 2h ordeal because the mechanical issues identified at ADD hadn't actually been fixed, and the ground crew also had to clean out the toilets. The ground crew got into a somewhat heated discussion with the flight attendants over an ""environmental hazard"" which I presume was the poop toilet. We weren't allowed to deplane during the stopover, and the AC kept turning on/off, so it got uncomfortably hot at times.

After FCO everything went fairly smoothly, but I am very glad I flew business because I spent close to 19h in my seat between ADD-YYZ. If you are flying this route and budget allows, I highly recommend flying business otherwise you will be miserable if your flight is delayed like mine was. On a positive note, I did manage to make my connecting flight despite landing in YYZ 3.5h late. Was this the worst flight I've ever been on? No, but if I ever flew JRO-YYZ again I'd definitely transfer in Europe or Qatar instead of ADD.

1nehajn,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Playful_Rub3656/comments/1nehajn/market_gaps_exposed_5_industries_reddit_users_are/,Market Gaps Exposed: 5 Industries Reddit Users Are Begging For!,"Forget expensive market research reports and stuffy focus groups. If you want to find out what customers *really* want, you need to go where the complaints are. And right now, there is no place with a more honest, unfiltered, and constant firehose of complaints and desires than Reddit.

It's the world's largest, most brutally honest focus group. For entrepreneurs, it's a goldmine of unsolved problems.

After spending countless hours scrolling through threads on `r/AskReddit`, `r/Entrepreneur`, and dozens of niche subreddits, I've identified five major market gaps. These aren't just minor inconveniences; these are entire industries where Redditors are practically begging for someone to take their money.

1. The ""Buy It for Life"" Economy: Durable, Repairable Goods

**The Reddit Complaint:** ""They just don't make them like they used to."" Scroll through `r/buyitforlife` and you'll see a constant refrain: modern products are designed to fail. From smartphones that are glued shut to washing machines with cheap plastic parts that break just after the warranty expires, people are sick of planned obsolescence.

**The Market Gap:** There is a massive, underserved market for high-quality, durable, and—most importantly—*user-repairable* products. Consumers are craving transparency and longevity over flashy features and disposable designs.

**The Business Ideas:**

* **Modular Electronics:** Think smartphones, laptops, and headphones designed with easily replaceable components (batteries, screens, ports).
* **High-Quality Home Appliances:** A brand of simple, robust appliances (blenders, toasters, coffee makers) built with metal parts and standard screws, sold with available schematics and replacement parts.
* **A ""Modern Repair Shop"" Franchise:** A stylish, trustworthy chain of repair shops that can fix anything from a smartphone to a vacuum cleaner, empowering the ""right to repair"" movement.

2. Practical Software and Tools for Neurodivergent Adults

**The Reddit Complaint:** Subreddits like `r/ADHD` and `r/Autism` are filled with brilliant, creative people struggling with executive function. Their complaint? The world, and the software in it, is built for neurotypical brains. Most productivity apps are too complex, visually cluttered, or require a level of consistency that feels impossible to maintain.

**The Market Gap:** There's a desperate need for software and physical products designed specifically to aid with the challenges of neurodiversity—not to ""fix"" it, but to work *with* it.

**The Business Ideas:**

* **An ""Executive Function"" App Suite:** Simple, visually-driven apps for specific tasks. One for ""body doubling"" (virtual co-working), one for breaking down overwhelming tasks into tiny steps, one for managing sensory overload.
* **Sensory-Friendly Productivity Tools:** High-quality, durable fidget toys for adults, noise-canceling headphones designed for all-day comfort, and lighting systems that reduce eye strain.
* **A Subscription Box for Neurodivergent Discovery:** A curated box that helps adults discover tools that work for them—from different planners and pens to focus aids and sensory items.

3. ""Third Places"" for Adults That Aren't About Alcohol

**The Reddit Complaint:** ""Where can adults actually go to hang out and meet people that isn't a bar?"" This question appears on `r/AskReddit` constantly. People are craving ""third places""—locations outside of home and work—where they can relax, socialize, or just exist without the pressure to drink alcohol or spend a lot of money.

**The Market Gap:** The demand for sober-friendly, community-oriented spaces is exploding. People want low-stakes environments to pursue hobbies and build connections.

**The Business Ideas:**

* **The Modern Hobby Shop:** Think of a shop for model kits, board games, or knitting that has a large, comfortable area with tables and good lighting where people can hang out and work on their projects.
* **Upscale, Non-Alcoholic Lounges:** A space with the sophisticated ambiance of a cocktail bar but serving high-end coffee, tea, and complex non-alcoholic mocktails. A place for a date or a late-night chat.
* **""Parallel Play"" Cafes:** A quiet space where adults can come to work on their own projects (laptops, sketchbooks, etc.) in the quiet company of others, fostering a sense of community without forced interaction.

# 4. A Modern Approach to Digital Legacy and End-of-Life Planning

**The Reddit Complaint:** In threads about losing a loved one, a heartbreaking and practical problem always emerges: the digital nightmare. Grieving family members are left trying to figure out passwords, locate important documents, close social media accounts, and manage a scattered digital legacy. It's an administrative hell during an emotional crisis.

**The Market Gap:** A user-friendly, secure, and empathetic service that helps people organize their digital end-of-life plan. It's a morbid topic, but a universal and deeply felt need.

**The Business Ideas:**

* **A ""Digital Vault"" SaaS:** A secure platform where users can store passwords, important documents (wills, deeds), and final wishes with a clear, trusted protocol for releasing this information to a designated heir upon their passing.
* **A Legacy Planning Concierge Service:** A high-touch service that guides individuals and couples through the entire process of organizing their physical and digital assets, from legal documents to social media accounts.

# 5. Hyper-Niche Subscription Boxes for Serious Hobbyists

**The Reddit Complaint:** ""I love my hobby, but sourcing the best supplies is a pain."" The subscription box market is saturated with generic snacks and makeup, but serious hobbyists are left out. A coffee lover on `r/espresso` doesn't want another generic dark roast; they want single-origin beans perfect for their specific machine.

**The Market Gap:** Curated, high-quality subscription boxes for dedicated enthusiasts who are willing to pay a premium for expertly sourced materials.

**The Business Ideas:**

* **For the 3D Printing Enthusiast:** A monthly box with unique, high-quality filaments, a new nozzle, and a small tool or accessory.
* **For the Fountain Pen Aficionado:** A curated selection of rare inks, high-quality paper (like Tomoe River), and a featured pen or accessory.
* **For the Advanced Gardener:** A seasonal box with heirloom seeds, specialized soil amendments, and high-quality tools tailored to a specific type of gardening (e.g., bonsai, hydroponics).

The complaints are out there, waiting in plain sight. The only question is: who will build the solutions?",1,1757617022.0,u_Playful_Rub3656,0,1.0,False
1neha4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/trektalk/comments/1neha4t/collider_this_single_iconic_line_in_star_trek_iv/,"Collider: ""This Single Iconic Line in Star Trek IV Came From a Purely Accidental, Unplanned Moment - An Extra Broke the Rules While Filming The ""Nuclear Wessles"" Scene - Nichols & Koenig's there-and-gone confusion about the unexpected interaction before rolling with it makes the moment even better""","Collider:

>Picture the scene: it's a beautiful sunny day in 1980s California. Your morning begins like any other. Maybe your pre-work routine involves brewing coffee, washing your face, and feeding your pet. You head outside to your car, only to find that authorities towed it away overnight, seemingly without warning, rhyme, or reason. Why did the towing company impound an unsuspecting vehicle? No big reason, really — it's just because the latest Star Trek movie is filming on your street.

>That situation happened to Layla Sarakalo, a woman who didn't realize until too late that production for 1986's Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home had blocked off her residential area. But Sarakalo didn’t watch Paramount Pictures employees and small-screen legends create sci-fi history from the comfort of her window. She volunteered as a paid extra for the day, motivated not by fan ties to the franchise, but because she needed enough money to pay the towing bill. Once she passed by the camera, Sarakalo's brief, unplanned, and unscripted reaction created one of this fan-favorite blockbuster's funniest jokes.

...

>As Uhura and Chekov embark on their side quest, they ask passing strangers for directions to Alameda. The heart of this gag hinges on Chekov’s Russian accent turning the words ""nuclear vessels"" into ""nuclear wessles,"" as well as the movie's running joke that positions the crew as being endearingly out of touch with 20th-century American culture. Between their Starfleet uniforms and general cluelessness, every character sticks out like a very sore thumb. It's also amusing to watch highly competent officers out of their element. Give Uhura a diplomatic crisis or a linguistics mystery, or Chekhov an intense flying maneuver, and they'll work wonders. Hunting down one corner of the Bay Area? These actual geniuses don't know whether to turn right or left.

>Every civilian — and one police officer — they approach ignores them. No one speaks to the duo, either, baffled by their question and no doubt side-eyeing a Russian stranger inquiring about nuclear assets during the Cold War. Since the screenwriting team Steve Meerson, Peter Krikes, Nicholas Meyer, and Harve Bennett wrote no dialogue for the extras, The Voyage Home's assistant director instructed the background players to stay silent, even if they wandered close to the camera. **Everyone listened except for Sarakalo, who improvised a polite response: ""Ooh, I don't know if I know the answer to that. I think it’s across the bay, in Alameda**[**.**](https://static0.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/star-trek-the-voyage-home-nichelle-nichols-walter-koenig-layla-sarakalo.jpg)**""**

...

>According to a 2005 feature on the official Star Trek website, ""Layla changed into a suitable outfit, grabbed her whippet Anubis (her dog) and headed down the street to where the action was taking place."" The assistant director hired her for the day, even though she didn't have any acting experience. When she asked for advice, ""They told her to act naturally."" Sarakalo didn't respond to Uhura and Chekov's question because she sought her literal 15 seconds of fame; she took the guidance to heart by acting naturally.

>Nichols and Koenig's there-and-gone confusion about the unexpected interaction before rolling with it makes the moment — kindly meant by Sarakalo's character but entirely unhelpful — even better. Instead of ending the scene's humor on the same level it began, where utter silence greets Chekhov and Uhura's pleas, Sarakalo's reply unintentionally builds toward a traditional punchline. In true improv tradition, she hands two professional actors something to ""yes, and"" into their own conclusive punchlines. Chekov's disbelieving, ""That's what I said. Alameda. I know that,"" reeks of ""are you kidding me"" levels of exasperation, while Uhura casts about in every direction with disbelieving urgency. The take's flow elevated the existing humor so well that actor-director Nimoy used Layla's ad-lib in The Voyage Home's final cut.

The semester ended with me in a really bad mental state, so I couldn't pursue and ask her out. Fast forward to a year later, I'm doing great and am ready for a relationship.

I have her email and want to ask her out for lunch or coffee, and am not really sure how. I'm thinking of sending a short introductory email, along the lines of ""Hey, its been some time, how've you been?"" and go from there. Any thoughts?",1,1757616990.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

I recently got admitted to Rhine-Waal University and just moved to Duisburg. Honestly, it feels a bit lonely and boring right now since I don’t really know anyone here yet, and my German isn’t that good.

Would love to connect with people around Duisburg/Kleve, especially other students from Rhine-Waal! I’m open to hanging out, exploring the city, grabbing a coffee/beer, or just chilling. Also really into playing football if anyone’s up for a game sometime.

If anyone’s free to show me around or just wants to make a new friend, hit me up 😊

We first went out in June. Two dates, and I decided he wasn’t consistent, hours to reply, leaving me anxious all the time. We agreed it wasn’t worth it.

In July, he texted again. We decided to meet, but somehow it never happened. I thought, meh, it’s not meant to be.

Then in August, I texted him. Loneliness, boredom, I don’t even know why. We ended up talking almost all night, and met that weekend. It was awkward as hell, and I figured it wouldn’t last.

After that, we barely texted. I didn’t reach out much, because surely, he’d take the lead now, right?

 Seven days later, he did… and I said no. Where were you the past week, sir?

Then he went back home, texted me a few more times, kept asking me out again and again.

I had completely given up. Thought I lost all feelings. But seeing him try so consistently, kahin na kahin mai pighal gayi.

And what’s there to lose? I’m single. Friendless. Might as well make a day of it. No realllll feelings left anyway.

So, we went to watch a movie last night.

Held hands because it felt right.
He asked all the right questions.
Bought me food.
Dropped me home.
All gentlemanly, as usual.

As we sat almost alone in Starbucks having a late-night coffee after the movie, laughing… it hit me. 

how cute he was.

How much I actually liked him.

How long it took to get over him.

Shit, shit, shit.

So yeah, ladies… trouble in paradise.
Hope the high is worth it.",16,1757616956.0,TwoXIndia,7,0.94,False

I’m 28 and a bit over a year in Dublin. I’m looking to make friends who enjoy building and chatting about startups, AI and tech—people keen to create or get involved in early-stage projects here.

I’ve a bit of experience but I’m not an expert; I learn by experimenting and shipping small MVPs. Lately I’m exploring Ecoshine, an eco-friendly mobile car-care idea, mainly as a learning experiment (not promoting or selling anything).

Nothing formal at all. I’d love a small, friendly circle to swap ideas, have proper discussions and maybe collaborate down the line. Dublin city centre (and nearby) works best—evenings or weekends are usually fine.
If it helps as prompts: AI apps, marketplace ops, pricing for on-demand services, quick MVP tests.

I can’t formally launch anything yet due to my visa, but I’m keen to meet people and learn together. If you know any local groups (Meetup/Discord/WhatsApp) or fancy a low-key coffee or a pint in town, drop a comment or DM. Cheers!",0,1757616913.0,Dublin,2,0.4,False

1neh7us,https://www.reddit.com/r/blissandbirch/comments/1neh7us/brightening_your_home_balcony_lights_dining_room/,"Brightening Your Home: Balcony Lights, Dining Room Table Lights, and Dining Table Lights","Lighting plays a powerful role in transforming the atmosphere of a home. Whether you’re hosting friends, enjoying dinner with family, or simply relaxing in your balcony, the right choice of lights can elevate your space both functionally and aesthetically. Among the many lighting options, balcony lights, [**Dining room table lights**](https://blissandbirch.co.in/product-category/lights-for-dining-table), and dining table lights stand out as essential features that enhance both style and comfort. Let’s explore how each of these can make your home glow with warmth and elegance.



# Balcony Lights – Creating a Cozy Outdoor Haven

Your balcony is more than just an extension of your home—it’s a personal retreat where you can enjoy a morning coffee, read a book in the evening, or even host a small gathering. The right balcony lights can completely change the mood of this space.

Balcony lights should be chosen based on the size and theme of your outdoor area. For a modern balcony, sleek LED wall-mounted lights or string fairy lights can create a chic, welcoming vibe. If you want a more traditional look, lantern-style fixtures or warm yellow bulbs add charm and intimacy.

Practicality is equally important. Since balconies are exposed to weather, choose durable, waterproof balcony lights that can withstand rain and wind. Solar-powered lights are another excellent option—they are energy-efficient, eco-friendly, and require minimal maintenance. A well-lit balcony not only looks beautiful but also improves safety during nighttime.



# Dining Room Table Lights – The Heart of Family Gatherings

The dining room is often the heart of a home, where families gather daily and guests are entertained during special occasions. This is why dining room table lights deserve special attention.

The lighting above your dining room table sets the tone for mealtimes. A classic choice is a chandelier, which creates a focal point and adds a sense of grandeur to the space. For a more contemporary design, pendant lights or sleek hanging lamps are excellent alternatives. These not only provide adequate illumination but also contribute to the décor.

When selecting dining room table lights, consider the shape of your table. A round dining table looks best with a single large pendant or chandelier, while a rectangular table pairs well with a row of multiple pendant lights. Adjustable dimmers are also recommended—they allow you to set the mood, whether you’re having a bright family brunch or a candlelight dinner.



# Dining Table Lights – Blending Functionality with Style

While dining room table lights highlight the overall room, dining table lights focus on illuminating the table itself. They enhance visibility, ensuring every meal is enjoyed in the perfect ambiance.

Dining table lights don’t just serve a functional purpose; they also play a key role in home décor. For a minimalist theme, recessed ceiling lights with warm tones work beautifully. For homes with a bold design sense, artistic fixtures with metallic or glass finishes can turn the dining table into the centerpiece of the room.

Positioning is important—lights should hang about 30–36 inches above the table to provide optimal illumination without creating harsh shadows. Layering is another trend worth considering. Combine overhead dining table lights with wall sconces or floor lamps to achieve a balanced glow across the room.



# Bringing It All Together

When thoughtfully chosen, **balcony lights**, **dining room table lights**, and [**Dining table lights**](https://blissandbirch.co.in/product-category/lights-for-dining-table) don’t just brighten spaces—they elevate your entire living experience. Balcony lights create a cozy, inviting outdoor retreat, while dining room table lights add elegance and sophistication to your interiors. Dining table lights, on the other hand, provide the perfect blend of practicality and beauty, ensuring every meal feels special.

Investing in the right lighting fixtures is not just about illumination; it’s about creating memories. Imagine the soft glow of balcony lights during late-night conversations, the sparkle of dining room table lights during family celebrations, or the gentle shine of dining table lights during a quiet dinner at home. These lighting choices become a part of your lifestyle, adding warmth, charm, and character to your everyday moments.",1,1757616849.0,blissandbirch,0,1.0,False

Well, I didnt mess it up, and we are going to meet up tomorrow, for a coffee and a walk. But I am super anxious!

I will visit her town, we already planned everything, and I already said something along the lines ""great, cant wait!"" and that I am looking forward to it.

She sugggested a place we can go to which I agreed on and then she send me something like ""great :) see you there"" which I didnt respond to now, because I already said that I am looking forward to it and everything is clear, so it felt right to not overdo it by sending another messagge, right?

But now I am super afraid, starting with silly things like ""what if I miss my train and be late?"", over ""What if she is bored"" to ""What if she expects someone completely different""

I am afraid that I cant hold a conversation with her, sometimes I dont know what to say, sometimes I am awkward, what if I am?

And also, what if she expects someone entirely else? I am overweight, what if she didnt spot how much overweight I am from my pictures? Or how unattractive I am?  
I have a video of myself playing the guitar and singing, what if she thinks that I am a musician? She likes to dance, what if she thinks I can dance because I have some feeling for ryhtm? I am none of these, and I cant dance!

And then simple things: what if I mess up when we see each other the first time? When it will be awkward when we greet each other? And there are so many more what ifs... I am shy, and anxious, and dont know how to interact with people naturally...

I am 30 and I've never been on something like a date...

Sometimes I am a little excited about tomorrow, but then it quickly vanishes because of all the anxiety and worries.",1,1757616650.0,Advice,1,0.67,False
1neh4hg,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Working-Hawk-1982/comments/1neh4hg/the_best_cordless_stick_vacuums/,The Best Cordless Stick Vacuums,"Cleaning up little messes around the house used to annoy me way more than it should have. Dragging out the big upright just for some crumbs or cat hair felt like a whole event. Switching to cordless stick vacuums honestly changed my routine, since I can grab one quickly without thinking about outlets or cords. It’s not like any of them are perfect, but the convenience makes a big difference when you’re just trying to stay on top of everyday stuff.

What I’ve learned is that each one has tradeoffs. Some are great for carpets but heavy in the hand, while others glide around like nothing but don’t have the strongest suction. It really comes down to what you’re cleaning most often. For me it’s a mix of pet hair, hardwood, and the occasional rug, so having the right balance has mattered more than finding “the best” in every single category.

## 🏆 Best Overall Option: [Dyson V12 Detect Slim](https://productbible.com/blog/best-cordless-stick-vacuums#dyson-v12)

The Dyson V12 is probably the closest thing to an “ideal” cordless vacuum I’ve tried. It’s light enough that I don’t feel like I’m getting a workout every time I clean, and the laser head is surprisingly satisfying since it makes all the hidden dust pop out like neon green confetti. It also feels a lot more comfortable to hold compared to the older Dyson trigger design, since now it just has a simple on/off button.

I’ve used it on everything from the kitchen floor to cat hair on the couch, and it’s handled all of it without much fuss. The Motorbar head is a lifesaver for hair since it doesn’t tangle as much, though it does get a little rough on delicate rugs. The dustbin is small, which means I end up emptying it way more often than I’d like, but the tradeoff is that it’s super easy to maneuver and doesn’t feel like a chore to grab off the dock.

## ⭐ Best Self-Emptying Option: [Shark PowerDetect](https://productbible.com/blog/best-cordless-stick-vacuums#shark-powerdetect-cordless)

The Shark PowerDetect stood out to me mainly because of the self-emptying dock. I didn’t realize how much I disliked dumping out dustbins until I stopped having to do it. It feels almost indulgent to finish vacuuming and just drop it on the dock while it quietly sucks everything into a bigger canister. If you have allergies or just hate dealing with that dust cloud, it’s a nice upgrade.

On the cleaning side it’s no slouch either. The dual brush system means I can go straight from the kitchen tile to the living room rug without swapping anything out, though I did notice it can be a little harsh on thinner rugs. Battery life is solid, close to an hour in eco mode, which is more than enough for my place. The only downside I’ve had is with pet hair, sometimes it takes a couple passes on flatter rugs to get everything.

## 💸 Best Budget Option: [Bissell Cleanview XR](https://productbible.com/blog/best-cordless-stick-vacuums#bissell-cleanview-xr)

The Bissell Cleanview XR was the one I picked up when I didn’t want to drop Dyson-level money but still wanted something cordless. For under \$200 it honestly does a decent job, especially on everyday dirt and dust. It’s light, easy to handle, and comes with a handful of attachments that actually feel useful. I’ve used the pet tool in my car a few times, and it did a surprisingly good job on the seats.

That said, you can tell it’s budget-friendly once you push it a little harder. It’s fine with flour or coffee grounds, but bigger stuff like cereal tends to clog it up fast. Battery life is fair, around 40 minutes on low, but if you kick it up to Turbo the runtime nosedives. For smaller apartments or as a second vacuum it makes a lot of sense, but I wouldn’t expect it to replace a full-sized one if you’ve got pets and lots of carpet.

## 🔧 Best for Garages: [Ryobi 18V One+ HP Advanced](https://productbible.com/blog/best-cordless-stick-vacuums#ryobi-18v-oneplus)

The Ryobi feels more like a power tool than a vacuum, which makes sense since it runs on their same battery system. It’s heavier than the others I’ve used, but it makes up for it with a huge dustbin and really strong suction. I keep mine in the garage, and it’s been great for vacuuming the car or grabbing sawdust and random messes without having to lug out a shop vac.

What I love is that it actually stands on its own, which sounds small but is so handy when I’m stopping mid-clean. The attachments are also solid, especially the micro crevice tool, which I’ve used for vents and even my keyboard. The weight can be tiring if you’re doing a whole house, but the durability and big capacity make it the one I trust for heavier jobs. It’s definitely not the sleekest option, but if you want a workhorse it’s a good pick.",1,1757616633.0,u_Working-Hawk-1982,0,1.0,False

1neh39j,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1neh39j/my_full_story_including_postop_day_1/,My Full Story (Including Post-Op Day 1),"I have been waiting to write this post for a long time. I apologize for the length, but I hope my story can help anyone in a similar boat. Feel free to ask me any questions too or DM me if you would like.

**Background on me** \- 43m, father of 2 young boys, former collegiate athlete, 6'2 around 205 pounds (down from 230 starting weight). Before this experience, I used to be the life of the party, full of energy, quick witted, passionate about so many different things in life, and just an all around happy dude.

**3 years ago** I first began having a right side dull pain right where my gall bladder was located. It hurt so badly at one point I had to stand up during the entire birth of my 2nd son in the ER. I got an endoscopy, CT scan, bloodwork, and ultrasound done, yet it showed nothing. I then did the Whole30 diet and worked with a functional medicine person and the pain went away, so I stopped thinking about it.

**1 year ago**, the pain started to return intermittently. It didn't really affect me that much until about **4 months ago**, when it started to become more frequent. I initially thought it was due to my newfound Zyn habit (which had been ongoing for about a month at the time), so I stopped that. The pain continued though, which became a dull pressure feeling like a golf ball under my right rib cage that was constantly there.  It started to affect my sleep (I would wake up between 3-5 am every night for the past 4 months, usually sweating), my mental status (severe brain fog and memory issues, which was unusual for me as a lawyer), energy levels (extreme fatigue and dizziness, especially while waking up), and appetite (I was never hungry, especially first thing in the morning). 

During this time, **I had so many tests**. I started with bloodwork (normal), then got an MRI (unremarkable), followed by an endoscopy/colonoscopy (small hiatal hernia), a GI Map (showed increased zonulin levels), and got acupunture/therapy/chiropractic care.  None of these things seemed to help, and I began to feel suicidal at one point thinking that it was all in my head and I would have to continue to exist in life in this altered state. Finally, my idiot PCP mentioned a HIDA scan to me after like 3 months, which I had never heard about before that day. I did not know that even though the gall bladder could look fine on an ultrasound/MRI, *there was another test for its functionality.* I was so mad, like why was this not suggested to me earlier when I initially thought it could be my gall bladder? Sure enough, I had an EF of 26%, and I was diagnosed with biliary dyskinesia. I then met with a surgeon, who basically said that I could get the surgery to remove the gall bladder, but it was not guaranteed to be the solution. Having no other options at that point (I had also lost 25 pounds due to my lack of appetite and overall malaise), I decided to move forward with the surgery.

**Surgery** \- Yesterday, I had my gall bladder removed. I was very nervous for the procedure, but knew it was the best option for me at this point after hearing from numerous other people on this subreddit thread who had undergone a similar journey. After the surgery, I was in a lot of pain, mainly from the gas that they inject inside of your stomach. My stomach was extremely bloated and in pain, but I did notice that my appetite had returned (I ate so much at the hospital and when I got home). Once I started to move around at home, I would burp/fart to get rid of the gas, which seemed to help. I also had to pee like every 30 minutes once I got home. I went to bed in pain, but optimistic.

**Post-Op Day 1** \- Today I woke up feeling like a new person. While I woke up at 3:30 am, I actually felt clear-headed at this point and ate some food + drank some water. I went back to sleep and got up again at 8 am, feeling the most refreshed I have felt in months. Moreover, my appetite had returned and my gas levels had gone way down in my stomach. The gas has seemingly moved into my shoulder now, which is quite common. I have been icing my stomach and using a heating pad on my shoulder. I just took a walk around my neighborhood and got a coffee plus a croissant at my local bakery. So far, I have been able to eat whatever I have wanted without issues. No BMs yet, but it has only been a day. I have already walked around 2K steps today, and I actually feel like I could work out (thought I won't).

I will continue to post updates as they come, but thus far, this seems to have been 100% the right decision. The surgeon said there was an adhesion on my GB (which I nicknamed Gary, BYE GARY!), showing that it was inflamed (not on any of the other scans of course). My right side dull pain appears to be gone, and my sleep last night was the best I've had in months (even though I had to sleep on my back instead of my side, which I hate).

So the moral of the story is to (1) trust your gut if you know that you are not feeling well, (2) do your own research before seeing doctors (ChatGPT really helped and I wish I had used it earlier to discover the HIDA Scan), and (3) there is a light at the end of the tunnel.

Thanks to all of those I have spoken to about my situation and your own. It has really helped, and I don't know if I would have gotten to this point if not for this Reddit sub-thread. For the first time in a while, I am extremely optimistic about life again and feel my energy returning to me.

1neh2kk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1neh2kk,"I believe most people don’t need a $10k interior designer, but they definitely need a plan to follow","I honestly believe most people don’t need a $10k interior designer. What they really need is someone to tell them what to do with their space, like a clear plan they can actually follow.

Sometimes it’s small things that make the difference:

* Lighting that feels warmer
* A layout that creates flow instead of clutter
* A rug that anchors the room
* A few personal touches that add warmth

So you probably do not need a designer price tag, but you need a plan that makes sense",10,1757616513.0,Home,4,0.75,False
1neh2jj,https://www.reddit.com/r/LSAT/comments/1neh2jj/what_170_scorers_do_differently/,What 170 Scorers do Differently,"Hey all.  I wanted to make this post to share some of the things that 170 scorers do that help them achieve such a great score.  These are things that I did myself and things that my students that score in the 170s do, so they may not apply to every 170 scorer, but they apply to a lot of them.  If you are interested in tutoring or just have LSAT questions please reach out to me.

\-Practice under realistic conditions.  Take your practice tests under real conditions.  Don't give yourself a few seconds extra or a long break between sections.  On the real LSAT you don't get these things so you don't want to get used to them while you are practicing.

\-Blind review extensively.  Blind review is going through the test untimed after you have taken it.  The goal of blind review is to understand why every answer is right and why every answer is wrong.  Blind review is your chance to grow as a test taker.  It is your chance to learn from the mistakes you made on the test.  So, take it seriously.

\-Treat the LSAT like it is a job.  It can sometimes be tough to find the motivation to study.  What I did to combat this is act like the LSAT was my job.  I wouldn't show up late to my job or just skip a day.  So, whatever I decided my schedule was I would stick to it.  For the first month or two, I would go to a coffee shop every morning to make sure I would study and not go back to sleep or get distracted at my apartment.  

\-Be excited to take practice tests.  Being happy to do something often makes you a lot better at it because it puts you in a positive mindset.  For me, the way I got excited was to treat the LSAT like a challenge.  I wanted to beat the test makers.  So, find a way to get pumped for the LSAT and you will see your score increase.

I hope this information is helpful.  This is not an exhaustive list by any means.  If you have any questions or are interested in tutoring please reach out to me.",26,1757616512.0,LSAT,3,0.94,False

1neh2ep,https://www.reddit.com/r/BenignExistence/comments/1neh2ep/i_tried_coffee_for_the_first_time_in_910_months/,"I tried coffee for the first time in 9-10 months, here's my experience:","For the record: I didn't try to quit coffee and then ""relapse"" I was just curious and hyperfixating on chemicals, and I remembered having 2 instant coffee packs in my closet from when I used to drink coffee every now and then.

I woke up today at 9:20am, mafe breakfast and afterwards had a 230mg cup of coffee
Im caffeine-naive and have no tolerance but i wanted to experience something memorable that would help me complete tasks i had been procrastinating on. 

10-20 minutes: felt nothing besides feeling a little bit hot
30 minutes: I started doing my online school work and I was able to complete 2 important tests! By this time, I started feeling the urge to get up and walk around,  I was so uncomfortable sitting, and starting to feel hot. 
40 minutes: this is when it started actually kicking in, I wanted to clean my closet since it had gotten pretty messy, and I was able to fold clothes, and organize things, all in 10 minutes. By this time I felt very physically hot and began to feel the sensation of my teeth-chattering when it's cold except it was my arms and legs that felt super ""chattery"" if you will, I was moving quickly, my heart rate was up from 60bpm to 90bpm and I could feel my head and throat having a slight heartbeat too. I felt wired, and it was almost a little overwhelming and I became super fast and jittery but not uncomfortably so.
50 minutes: I decided to put the energy to use and went out for a run, by this time I was absolutely caffeinated, my entire body was buzzing, I was talking fast and moving hyper, and the second I got out, I immediately started running super quickly and it felt like I was on fire!! I ran about 4mph in 2-3 minutes and my heart rate was around 140bpm and I felt energized and like i could handle anything! I ran all around my apartment complex and I even ran downhill too, I had to stop eventually. And then I just kept running in short bursts, I could feel energy burning and the same jittery/chattery feeling. I kept on walking quickly without any breaks and my heart rate was still high but no true tiredness/fatigue happened even once i got back, it's like I was just more powerful and energetic and immune to the usual tiredness and aches that happen after I run or workout, plus my breath control was wayyyyy better. 
1h and 20 minutes: my thoughts glowed freely when I was talking and I didn't have to pause and think about anything when I was talking, words and ideas just flowed perfectly fine and I still wasn't tired. 
2-3 hours: I'm back to normal, no fatigue, I ate lunch, and im fine now. Safe to say I'll be doing this again! Im usually pretty mellow and not too happy/sad/angry so being so hyped up like that was crazy. 

9/10. Would Recommend 
I might just do 300mg tomorrow.
And for reference, I'm 5'4, 135lbs and 16, so that's the effect that coffee had on someone my size.",8,1757616504.0,BenignExistence,0,0.9,False

1neh0tt,https://www.reddit.com/r/productbible/comments/1neh0tt/the_best_cordless_stick_vacuums/,The Best Cordless Stick Vacuums,"Cleaning up daily messes shouldn’t feel like a chore. If you’ve ever dreaded dragging out a bulky, plug-in vacuum for something as small as crumbs on the floor or pet hair on the rug, you’re not alone. Cordless stick vacuums are designed to make life easier, offering lightweight convenience and the freedom to clean without worrying about tangled cords or outlets.

Of course, there’s no such thing as a perfect model. Some excel at maneuverability but lack raw suction power, while others offer longer battery life at the cost of added weight. Choosing the right one really depends on what matters most in your home, whether that’s tackling pet fur, deep cleaning carpets, or keeping up with constant spot cleaning.

The good news is that there are plenty of well-rounded options out there, and with the right choice, you can strike a balance that makes cleaning quicker and less frustrating. A cordless stick vacuum won’t solve every cleaning challenge, but it can definitely transform the way you handle everyday messes.

## 🏆 Best Overall Option: [Dyson V12 Detect Slim](https://productbible.com/blog/best-cordless-stick-vacuums#dyson-v12)

The Dyson V12 Detect Slim comes close to being the ideal cordless stick vacuum. It is lightweight, powerful, and versatile, offering excellent performance on both hard floors and carpets. At just over 5 pounds, it feels agile in hand and maneuvers easily around corners, table legs, and stairs. Its compact size makes it easy to store, though it cannot stand on its own and its dustbin is notably small.

One of the standout qualities of this model is how comfortable it feels to use. Despite most of its weight sitting near the top, the design makes it surprisingly easy on the wrists and hands during longer cleaning sessions. The cleaner head swivels 180 degrees, allowing it to reach tight spaces with ease, and at 72 decibels it runs relatively quietly compared to other stick vacuums. The switch design is also a welcome change: instead of the older trigger-style mechanism, the V12 Detect Slim uses a simple on/off button that reduces hand strain.

Performance is where this vacuum shines. Its suction power and airflow make it capable of pulling up fine dust and larger debris from bare floors as well as rugs. In controlled testing, it removed nearly all embedded particles from medium-pile carpets and also excelled at collecting pet hair. The V12 Detect Slim operates with three modes: eco for conserving battery, boost for maximum suction, and auto, which adjusts suction based on the dirt detected. This makes it adaptable for varied cleaning tasks without requiring constant manual adjustment.

The V12 Detect Slim comes with two specialized cleaner heads. The Motorbar cleaner head is designed for rugs and carpets, featuring rubber vanes that help prevent hair from tangling around the brush. It performs well against long strands of hair and pulls dust from deep in carpet fibers, though it can be aggressive on delicate rugs. The Laser Slim Fluffy head, built for hard floors, uses soft microfiber and a laser light that reveals dust and particles in dark corners. This head is especially effective at capturing fine debris that would otherwise go unnoticed.

Versatility extends beyond floors. The vacuum converts into a handheld model with multiple attachments, including a mini motorized brush that removes pet hair from upholstery and car seats. The included combination tool also makes it easy to switch between wide nozzle suction and a brush for delicate surfaces like shelves and windowsills. This adaptability makes the V12 a strong all-in-one solution for both floors and smaller surfaces.

Durability and maintenance are supported by practical features. The vacuum uses swappable click-in batteries, which means you can extend run time by keeping spares on hand, and it avoids the common pitfall of discarding an entire unit if the battery fails. Filters and other components are also replaceable and washable. Dyson backs the vacuum with a two-year warranty, which, while not the longest available, still offers reasonable protection. The LCD display adds a layer of convenience by showing battery life countdowns, troubleshooting guidance, and even particle counts, though the latter is more of a novelty than a necessity.

Despite its strengths, the V12 Detect Slim is not without flaws. It is one of the more expensive cordless models on the market, and its small dustbin fills quickly, requiring frequent emptying. The bin’s ejection system is forceful, which can sometimes cause spills, and debris may stick inside, requiring manual removal. Switching between the Motorbar and Laser Slim Fluffy heads can also be inconvenient if your space has a mix of flooring types. Additionally, the vacuum cannot stand upright on its own and struggles with lightweight rugs, where the brush roll may seize and cannot be turned off.

Even with these drawbacks, the Dyson V12 Detect Slim remains one of the most compelling cordless stick vacuums available. Its balance of power, convenience, and versatility make it a strong choice for those who want an effective, adaptable tool for everyday cleaning.

## ⭐ Best Self-Emptying Option: [Shark PowerDetect](https://productbible.com/blog/best-cordless-stick-vacuums#shark-powerdetect-cordless)

The Shark PowerDetect Cordless Stick Vacuum (IP1251) is a powerful and versatile cleaning tool with practical features that set it apart. One of its main advantages is the option to pair it with a self-emptying dock, which automatically transfers debris from the vacuum into a larger canister after each session. This reduces the need for frequent manual emptying and limits exposure to dust plumes, making it especially convenient for households with allergy concerns.

Performance is a strong point of this model. It handles a wide variety of debris including crumbs, sand, and dust with efficiency comparable to other top-performing cordless vacuums. Its single cleaner head uses a dual-brush system: a soft front roller for hard floors and a stiff-bristle brush in the back to tackle carpets. Together, these brushes work in both forward and reverse motion, speeding up the cleaning process. However, the brush roller can be too aggressive for delicate rugs, as it may pull out fibers along with dirt.

Battery life is another area where the Shark PowerDetect stands out. In eco mode, it can run close to an hour on a single charge, one of the longest runtimes among similar vacuums. The design is lighter than some competitors, though not quite as light as premium models like the Dyson V12. Still, its balance of power and weight makes it manageable for extended use.

The vacuum also incorporates smart features to improve ease of use. It has three cleaning modes, including an auto-detect mode that automatically increases suction when carpets or heavy debris are detected. The LED screen provides a clear readout of charging levels, while the wand design includes a convenient trigger for switching modes and an adjustable angle that allows it to fold at 90 degrees. This makes it particularly effective for cleaning under furniture without having to move heavy items.

In terms of attachments, the Shark PowerDetect offers useful tools such as a long combination crevice-and-brush tool for tight spaces and bookshelves. It also includes a pet multitool for upholstery, though this requires manual clearing of fur from the brush after use. The included tools are functional, but less efficient than the motorized mini brushes offered with some other models. While Shark does sell a motorized hand tool separately, it has often been difficult to find in stock.

Durability and support are backed by one of the best warranties in its class. With five years of coverage, this vacuum offers more peace of mind than many alternatives. The self-emptying dock, when included, also adds to the long-term convenience by holding debris for weeks at a time before needing to be emptied. Without the dock, the vacuum’s smaller 24-ounce dustbin will require more frequent emptying during use.

This model does come with some drawbacks. Its bold, angular design and bright color accents make it less visually appealing than competitors. It also struggles with pet fur, requiring multiple passes on flat-woven rugs to remove visible hair. Replacement parts, including the battery, are often out of stock, creating challenges for long-term maintenance. Noise can also be an issue, as the vacuum becomes significantly louder in boost and detect modes, producing a high-pitched sound that may be bothersome. Finally, the odor-neutralizing cartridge included with the machine gives off a strong artificial fragrance, and the manufacturer provides limited information about its ingredients. While the cartridge can be removed, some of the scent lingers.

Despite these shortcomings, the Shark PowerDetect Cordless Stick Vacuum remains a highly capable and practical choice. With its dual-brush cleaning system, long runtime, and optional self-emptying dock, it delivers strong cleaning performance and convenience for a wide range of household needs.

## 💸 Best Budget Option: [Bissell Cleanview XR](https://productbible.com/blog/best-cordless-stick-vacuums#bissell-cleanview-xr)

The Bissell Cleanview XR Pet 300W Cordless Vacuum is a budget-friendly stick vacuum designed to make everyday cleaning more convenient. Many cordless vacuums carry a steep price tag, often exceeding the cost of a full-sized plug-in model, but this Bissell offers solid performance at a fraction of the cost. Lightweight and versatile, it comes in under $200, making it one of the more accessible cordless options for those who want cordless convenience without overspending.

Unboxing the vacuum reveals several components, including the main body, wand, floorhead, a set of attachments, and parts for a wall-mounted docking station. The attachments include a crevice tool, two dusting brushes, and a motorized pet tool. The vacuum weighs just under 6 pounds and can be used either as a stick or converted into a handheld for smaller tasks. Controls are handled via a trigger-style on/off switch and a touchscreen display that cycles between three suction modes.

The unit is powered by a removable 24-volt lithium-ion battery. On its lowest suction setting, it can run for up to 40 minutes, though that runtime drops significantly in Turbo mode, lasting closer to eight minutes. While the drop is steep, this kind of trade-off between suction power and battery life is common across cordless stick vacuums. Charging takes a few hours, and because the battery must be removed to charge, it is less convenient than models that charge while docked.

For cleaning performance, the Cleanview XR Pet does well with light debris on both hard floors and low-pile carpeting. Its anti-tangle brushroll helps prevent hair wrapping and works effectively with everyday dirt and dust. LED headlights on the floorhead make it easier to spot debris along baseboards and in dim corners. The vacuum also features an anti-allergen seal that keeps fine dust and dander contained, though it lacks a full HEPA filter.

When tackling specific debris types, the vacuum has mixed results. It performs well with flour, coffee grounds, and sand, picking them up in just a pass or two, particularly on hard flooring. It struggles more with larger debris like cereal, which tends to clog the entry point between the wand and dustbin, causing material to back up and spill out when the vacuum is turned off. Pet hair removal is another area where performance is uneven. It picks up loose fur from hard floors and furniture with the help of the motorized pet tool, but it is less effective on rugs and carpets where hair can remain embedded.

The included attachments increase its versatility. The crevice tool and dusting brushes handle tight corners and shelving, while the motorized pet tool is useful for upholstery and car seats. The wand has a clip that can hold additional tools, making it convenient to keep them within reach while cleaning. The docking station provides organized storage and a place to charge the battery, though it requires assembly.

Maintenance is straightforward. The 0.3-liter dustbin is small but thoughtfully designed with a release mechanism that prevents accidental openings. It can be fully removed for deep cleaning, and the washable filter in the top is easy to access. The brushroll will require occasional manual cleaning, as longer strands of hair can still wrap around it despite the anti-tangle design.

Overall, the Bissell Cleanview XR Pet 300W Cordless Vacuum is a solid option for budget-conscious buyers who want a lightweight and versatile stick vacuum. It excels at cleaning up everyday dust and dirt but struggles with larger debris and heavy pet hair. For households with short-haired pets or minimal carpet, it offers good value. While it may not replace a full-sized vacuum, it is well-suited for quick cleanups and smaller spaces where convenience and affordability matter most.

## 🔧 Best for Garages: [Ryobi 18V One+ HP Advanced](https://productbible.com/blog/best-cordless-stick-vacuums#ryobi-18v-oneplus)

The Ryobi 18V One+ HP Advanced Stick Vacuum Kit is built for durability and power rather than sleek design. It is heavier and less nimble than some cordless stick vacuums, but it delivers strong suction and airflow that rivals many of the most capable models in its category. On rugs, bare floors, and even upholstery, it does an impressive job of removing dust, sand, and other debris. While it does not pull quite as much from deep carpets as premium competitors, its overall cleaning power makes it one of the stronger performers for the price.

This vacuum features three cleaning modes. The medium setting is sufficient for most everyday use, balancing suction and battery efficiency. Boost mode is available when tackling more stubborn debris, such as embedded dirt or pet hair on certain rugs, while eco mode conserves power for longer sessions. The versatility of these modes makes it adaptable for different surfaces and messes.

The all-in-one cleaner head is designed to handle multiple floor types. A plush front roller targets hard flooring like tile or wood, while a stiff-bristle and rubber-fin brushroll in the back lifts dirt from carpets and rugs. The single cleaner head includes a headlight that helps illuminate debris, although it is less effective at highlighting fine dust compared to models with advanced laser systems. Even so, the Ryobi is equally capable of picking up everyday debris such as cereal on slippery floors or pet fur on medium-pile carpets.

Capacity is one of this model’s biggest advantages. Its extra-large dustbin holds 33 ounces, nearly triple that of some competitors, and empties easily. The filter is washable, and both the bin and filter can be cleaned and replaced when needed. This large capacity allows the vacuum to handle longer cleaning sessions without frequent stops to empty the bin, making it especially practical for bigger homes or heavier messes.

Battery performance is solid, with a runtime of about 32 minutes in eco mode. That is enough to clean an average apartment or small home in one session, and the battery charges in under two hours, which is faster than many other cordless vacuums. A charge-level indicator light makes it easy to monitor remaining power. Noise levels are also relatively low, thanks to Ryobi’s Whisper Series Technology, which keeps the vacuum quieter than many similarly powerful models.

At over 10 pounds, this vacuum is significantly heavier than other picks. Its design places the motor and battery close to the handle, which can feel cumbersome during extended use. However, it stands upright on its own, an uncommon but useful feature that prevents the need to lean it against furniture or walls mid-clean.

The Ryobi 18V One+ HP Advanced Stick Vacuum can convert into a handheld model, and it comes with an excellent set of attachments. These include a crevice tool, a pivoting brush for tight spaces, and a motorized mini brush that is particularly effective at removing pet hair from upholstery. A micro crevice tool with flexible straws adds further versatility, making it useful for cleaning narrow or delicate areas like vents and sewing machines. The only drawback is that its charging station must be mounted on the wall, which may be inconvenient for those who prefer more portable storage options.

Durability is another strength of this model. Made from thick plastic and metal, it feels sturdier than many cordless vacuums in its class. The three-year limited warranty is longer than most competitors provide, and the battery is compatible with Ryobi’s broader line of 18V One+ cordless tools. While availability and replacement part ordering have been problematic with some of Ryobi’s products in the past, the build quality and modular system make this vacuum a reliable long-term investment if you can find it in stock.

---

Cordless stick vacuums have transformed the way people approach everyday cleaning. By combining portability, quick setup, and versatile attachments, they make it easier to keep floors, furniture, and even cars free of dust and debris without the hassle of cords or bulky machines. While they don’t always match the raw power or longevity of full-sized plug-in vacuums, the convenience factor is undeniable.

Choosing the right model ultimately comes down to balancing features with your household needs. Factors like battery life, dustbin capacity, weight, and available attachments can make one vacuum a better fit than another. Whether you’re focused on handling pet hair, covering large spaces, or just needing something lightweight for daily touch-ups, there’s a cordless option that can make your cleaning routine more efficient and far less of a chore.",1,1757616405.0,productbible,0,1.0,False

groovy: bro we were here to save the economy, not your nuggies

tangomangle: (stares menacingly)



carl: wait… anyone else hear that?

avi: oh no… not again…



(baconbeard’s new ship rises out of the ocean, bigger, shinier, with the name “S.S. LAG TITANIC” spray-painted on the side)



baconbeard: ARR… YOU SANK MY LAST SHIP… BUT THIS ONE HAS DOUBLE THE FPS DROPS!

groovy: oh for crying out loud— asdwz458, fire the cannons!

asdwz458: i removed the cannons because they were taking up my leg room

groovy: BRO THIS IS FUCKING BULLSHI- oh wait i can just create new ones using my new btools-



baconbeard: NOPE TOO LATE

(the S.S. Lag Titanic fires… lag bombs. suddenly everyone moves at 2 fps)



tangomangle: i can’t… move… my nuggets… falling… in slow… motion…

carl: MY LIFE IS A SLIDESHOW



(groovy smacks the engine button. ship barely moves at 0.1 knots per hour.)



\[meanwhile at robloxia’s blue house\]



stickmasterluke: shedletsky, where’s our army?!

shedletsky: half of them are stuck in the lava obby, the other half is arguing about whether bloxxydam or robloxia invented tix first

john: also our engineers are busy building the trenches first

luke: …we’re so dead



(theamazeman calls over radio)



theamazeman: luke! check the sky!



(a giant zeppelin shaped like a noob head appears, dropping leaflets: “FREE ROBUX – NO SCAM – CLICK HERE”)



caine: oh yeah we’re definitely dead.



\[back on the ocean\]



baconbeard: surrender your ship!

groovy: never! avi, full power!

avi: we’re already at full power!

groovy: then go fuller!

avi: what does that even—



(suddenly tangomangle crawls to the control panel, shoves a chicken nugget into the throttle)



engine: VRRRRRRRRRMMMMMMMMMMM

asdwz458: THIS SPEED IS LAGGING MY PC TURN IT OFF NOW



tangomangle: no!



asdwz458: ohh. :( okay...



baconbeard: NOOOO MY BEAUTIFUL SHIP! I ONLY HAD 2 FPS LEFT!!



(pirates splash into water, groovygang speeds off)



\[back at roblox HQ\]



david: so… bloxxydam just declared official war.

stickmasterluke: oh great.

david: also, someone gave the bacon pirates nukes.

stickmasterluke: (throws coffee cup)



\[robloxia HQ, war room\]



stickmasterluke: alright people, we have a situation.

shedletsky: (sipping coffee) understatement of the century.

david: bloxxydam has officially declared war, bacon pirates have nukes, someone crashed 37 zeppelins on the highway, and half our army is stuck on stage 3 of the lava obby.

john doe: stage 3??? seriously??? that one’s literally just a jump.

shedletsky: yeah, apparently some guy fell and blocked the checkpoint with his avatar, now everyone spawns in the lava.

stickmasterluke: …this is going to be the dumbest war in history.



(a soldier bursts in)



soldier: SIR!! the zeppelin noob head just dropped… not bombs… but… points outside



(they look out the window. hundreds of crates are falling from the sky. when they break open, thousands of robloxians flood the streets grabbing robux like black friday shoppers.)



stickmasterluke: this is worse than bombs… this is inflation.



\[meanwhile, bloxxydam secret base – the dam fortress\]



theamazeman: haha… look at them suffer…

inyo22: uh boss… i think they’re just… buying limited hats with all the free robux.

theamazeman: that’s the point, inyo… the economy will crash… ugc creators will cry… chaos will reign…

phalack: but won’t bloxxydam also suffer?

theamazeman: nah we turned off trading in our country. their limiteds are stuck at home. ours are safe. evil laugh



(a soldier runs in)



soldier: sir! robloxia forces are gathering near the border!

theamazeman: excellent… let them come… the lava obby will take care of them.



(camera pans outside: the dam has a giant 2012 lava obby built across the front gate. soldiers fall off into the lava every few seconds.)



\[back on the groovygang’s ship\]



groovy: alright, so, recap: baconbeard sank again, bloxxydam declared war, and apparently someone gave nukes to the pirates??

tangomangle: yeah i heard they put the nukes in crates labeled “FREE DOMINUS” so no one questioned it.

avi: looking at radar uh… guys? there’s like… fifty red dots behind us.

carl: fifty what?

avi: ships. big ones. bloxxydam navy.



(they all look back. a massive bloxxydam fleet is chasing them, sails painted with “DOWN WITH ROBLOXIA” in bright red letters.)



groovy: alright… plan b.

carl: what’s plan b?

groovy: we don’t have a plan b. i just hoped saying that would make us look smarter.

tangomangle: GIVE ME THE CANNONS I’LL DO PLAN C

asdwz458: what’s plan c?

tangomangle: chaos.



(he loads every single cannonball, half a crate of fireworks, and a btools cube into the cannon.)



groovy: WAIT NOT THE BTOOLS-



(BOOM. entire cannon explodes. ship speeds up from recoil, narrowly escaping the bloxxydam fleet.)



avi: we just lost half the deck but hey, we’re alive.

groovy: i hate this job so much.



\[robloxia high school – evacuation center\]



intercom principal: attention… uh… students… and teachers… and uh… anyone still in the building… the war is apparently official now. stay calm.



(half the ceiling falls in from a stray zeppelin crate. chaos erupts.)



ka-hi gaela: oh cool, i always wanted to dodge falling debris while running for my life.

yung giez gaela: bro this is literally the best day of school ever. no classes, free loot boxes falling from the sky…

shiotachen: yeah until you get crushed by a 500-ton robux crate.



(imaginaryunitlord the teacher tries to organize students but everyone runs in random directions like a natural disaster movie.)



\[robloxia capital – stickmasterluke at the gates\]



stickmasterluke: soldiers… today we fight for robloxia! for freedom! for the economy!

random soldier: do we get paid?

stickmasterluke: yes. in robux.

soldiers: LET’S GOOOOOOOOOO



(the army charges across the border… straight into the lava obby. half of them fall in instantly.)



shedletsky: …this is going to be a long war.



\[bloxxydam command center\]



theamazeman: hehe… look at them burn… the lava obby never fails…

inyo22: sir… sir… uh… one of them found the secret shortcut on the left side.

theamazeman: WHAT.

soldier: they’re inside the dam fortress.



\[in the obby\]

soldier 1: oh wait i just realized (goes around the obby, walking on a patch of grass that was conveniently placed there totally not just because of plot armor)

soldier 2: thats what i tried to say but couldnt since i was in the back of the line

soldier 6: YOU BLIND DIMWITS



(they rush inside)



(alarms blare. bloxxydam soldiers scramble. the robloxian army pours into the fortress courtyard. chaos erupts. bloxxydam soldiers use paintball guns, robloxians fight with swords and rocket launchers.)



john doe: (fighting off soldiers) THIS IS FOR TIX BEING REMOVED YOU MONSTERS



\[back on the ocean – bloxxydam fleet vs groovygang\]



(the bloxxydam ships finally catch up. cannonballs fly. groovygang’s ship zigzags wildly.)



avi: we can’t outrun them!

tangomangle: THEN WE DON’T OUTRUN THEM. WE OUT-CRAZY THEM.



(he pulls out a stash of fireworks, ties them to chickens, lights the fuse.)



groovy: …what the hell are you doing?

tangomangle: aerial chicken strike.



(the chickens launch into the air, fireworks explode mid-flight, raining chaos on the bloxxydam ships. sails catch fire. soldiers scream. ships crash into each other.)



carl: …it actually worked…

groovy: i don’t know whether to thank you or call a therapist.



\[roblox HQ\]



david: …this is getting out of hand.

stickmasterluke (over radio): “out of hand”?? david, bloxxydam just sent a giant noob mech stomping across the border!!

david: …a what.

shedletsky: yeah, it’s like… forty feet tall, made of laggy parts, powered by free robux.

david: …alright i’m calling in the mods.



(cut to a squad of moderators parachuting in with banhammers.)





\[roblox HQ, rooftop\]



(the moderators land dramatically, swinging banhammers like they’re in a michael bay movie)



mod #1: who do we ban first?

david: bloxxydam forces. every soldier. every nuke. every noob mech.

mod #2: …sir… the noob mech is technically a player-made model. it’s… uh… under terms of service.

david: I DON’T CARE IF IT’S IN THE MUSEUM, BAN IT.



(the mods charge toward the battlefield, each one swinging a glowing blue banhammer. every time it hits, a bloxxydam soldier vanishes with a “this account has been terminated” message floating above the smoke.)



stickmasterluke (over radio): mods are in. repeat, mods are in.

shedletsky: yeah well the noob mech just kicked over our entire left flank so maybe hurry it up.



\[robloxian army – inside the dam fortress\]



(chaos everywhere. robloxians storm the courtyard, fighting bloxxydam defenders who shoot paintball guns, throw crates, and yell stuff like “FOR BLOXXY!”)



john doe: THIS IS FOR TIX! (hits a soldier with a rocket launcher)

random soldier: sir that was one of our guys

john doe: oh. well… he should’ve moved.



(the noob mech’s footsteps shake the ground as it approaches the fortress gates)



soldier: IT’S HERE!!!



(the noob mech kicks the front gate open like it’s a cardboard box. it roars in the most laggy, robotic voice ever.)



noob mech: RRRRREEEESSSSPPPPPAAAWWWNNNN POOOIIIINNNTTSSSS DDEESSTTRROOOYYYEEDDDDD



(the mech fires its arm cannon. entire sections of the fortress explode. robloxians scatter.)



stickmasterluke: HOLD THE LINE!!

shedletsky: HOLD THE WHAT?! THE LINE IS IN FLAMES, LUKE!!!



(then suddenly…)



mod #1: don’t worry… we brought backup.



(a helicopter arrives. it drops… the ultimate weapon… THE BANBOT 9000. a giant robot made entirely of banhammers.)



banbot 9000: (in deep voice) ACCOUNT… TERMINATED.



(it grabs the noob mech by the head and slams it into the lava obby. explosion. half the map disappears. bloxxydam soldiers scream in laggy terror.)



\[groovygang: still on the ocean\]



avi: so uh… guys… i think half the mainland just exploded.

tangomangle: good. less people to steal my nuggets.

asdwz458: no wait look, the bloxxydam fleet’s retreating!

groovy: what? why?

carl: maybe they heard about the banbot.



(a radio crackles)



stickmasterluke: groovy, we need you at the dam NOW.

groovy: luke, buddy, pal… our ship is literally on fire.

luke: AND SO IS THE COUNTRY, GET OVER HERE.



(groovygang speeds toward the mainland, leaving behind baconbeard clinging to a piece of driftwood.)



baconbeard: mark my words… i’ll be back… with EVEN MORE FPS DROPS…



\[inside the dam: final battle\]



(the bloxxydam leader, theamazeman, stands on the control tower, watching chaos unfold. soldiers running everywhere, robloxians fighting through every hallway.)



theamazeman: so… this is it… huh?

inyo22: sir we could… like… surrender.

theamazeman: surrender?? to ROBLOXIA??? never!

phalack: but sir half the fortress is gone, the noob mech is in pieces, and the banbot is literally tearing through our walls.

theamazeman: …ok maybe a temporary surrender.



(a giant explosion outside. the banbot 9000 punches through the wall like the kool-aid man.)



banbot 9000: ACCOUNT… PERMANENTLY… TERMINATED.



theamazeman: ok yeah we surrender.



\[roblox HQ – one day later\]



(david sits at a table with stickmasterluke, shedletsky, groovy, tangomangle, and about 500 tired soldiers.)



david: so… bloxxydam officially signed the peace treaty.

stickmasterluke: yep. war’s over.

shedletsky: economy’s still on fire though.

groovy: can we get paid?

david: in robux or real money?

groovy: …robux. obviously.



(tangomangle walks in with a giant bag.)

tangomangle: good news. i found my nuggets.

shedletsky: …where were they?

tangomangle: inside the noob mech.

everyone: …what.

Hey everyone! 🌟 

Ever feel like you’re drowning in “hustle culture”? You know, that overwhelming push to work 24/7? Yeah, me too. But let’s be real—working harder isn’t always the answer. What if I told you there are **faceless growth strategies** out there that could actually *print money* without burning you out? Sounds intriguing, right? 

Here’s the deal—while everyone's rushing towards the next flashy AI tool, those of us who know a few *smart hacks* can really cash in. Let's jump into some strategies that might just save you time and *maybe* create that fortune you’ve been dreaming of. 

**1. Automation is Your Bestie**  
Seriously, stop doing the repetitive stuff. Use tools to automate social media posts, email campaigns, or basic customer interactions. You don't have to personally say ""thank you"" to every new follower. Want to know a solid starting point? Check out this helpful guide: [MaximizeMe](https://www.checkout-ds24.com/redir/540531/maximizeme/) 💡.

**2. Leverage AI for Content Creation**  
You heard me right! AI can whip up blog posts, social media content, and even email newsletters. Imagine having a virtual assistant that never sleeps! Sure, you need to tweak things to fit your vibe, but it’s all about working smart, not hard. What’s better than sipping coffee while your AI does the heavy lifting? ☕🤖

**3. Build Passive Income Streams**  
Imagine earning money while you *sleep*—sounds like a dream, huh? Think affiliate marketing, online courses, or print on demand. Explore avenues where you can create once and profit for life. I mean, if it’s digital, it can last forever, right? 

**4. Network without Getting Burnt Out**  
Join online communities and forums like this one! Build relationships, share insights, and snag partnerships that propel your growth without you having to chase everyone down. Plus, it’s way more fun to discuss ideas with friends instead of going solo! 

**5. Test and Tweak, Repeat**  
Remember: not every strategy works for every niche. Try different approaches, analyze results, and keep what works! It's a trial-and-error game where learning is part of the hustle. You might even stumble upon something that changes your game completely! 

**6. Embrace Minimalism in Your Strategy**  
Sometimes less really is more! Focus on a few key actions that deliver real benefits instead of spreading yourself thin. It’s all about efficiency—quality over quantity, folks!

And here’s the kicker… **the AI rush isn’t going to wait for anyone**! Those who adapt early and embrace these faceless growth strategies will be the ones laughing all the way to the bank. What’s stopping you from diving into it today?

Maybe take a quiet walk and quietly humm a childhood song.

1neglo0,https://www.reddit.com/r/RDR2/comments/1neglo0/live_arthur_morgan/,Live Arthur Morgan,"Part 1: The Rescue of Arthur Morgan on the Mountain

Arthur loses consciousness, accepting his end. He does not see several crows descending upon his lifeless body. But these are not ordinary birds. They are scouts of the Wapiti people, who have been tracking him since he helped Rains Fall and Eagle Flies. They saw him fight the Pinkertons and give his life for a friend.

They wrap him in hides, stop the bleeding with herbs they know (tobacco and sage), and carry him on a stretcher to a deeply hidden cave in the Ambarino mountains, where no agent has ever set foot.

The healing is long and agonizing.

· Tuberculosis: The tribe's shaman, seeing the sickness in his lungs (they call it ""the spirit that devours breath""), cannot cure him. But he knows herbs (chaparral, coltsfoot) that ease the cough and slow the disease, turning it into a chronic, rather than acute, phase. This gives Arthur years, not months.

· Injuries: The bullet and bayonet wounds heal, but leave him physically weak. His famous power is gone forever. He can no longer fight or run quickly. His strength now lies in his wisdom and patience.

· Psychological Trauma: For long weeks, he lies in a semi-delirious state, feeling as if he is in hell. He hears the voices of Dutch, Micah, Sean, and Lenny. The shaman performs cleansing rituals with him to exorcise the ""evil spirits"" of his past.

Once recovered, Arthur realizes that Arthur Morgan is dead to the world. And that's for the best. He takes a new name given to him by the tribe—""Wandering Ghost""—as a man who was meant to die but walks the earth.

Part 2: Life After

1. A Hunt for Memory. Living in seclusion on the outskirts of Hennigan's Stead, Arthur hears tales of a ghost who robs wealthy cattle barons at night and gives the money to the poor. He is described as a tall man in a mask. Arthur smiles. He recognizes the handiwork. It's Sadie.

He finds her camp. Sadie, upon seeing him, almost shoots, thinking he's a hallucination. But then she notices the scars, the tired eyes, and that same smile. They don't rush into an embrace. They sit by the fire for a long time, drinking coffee in silence. No unnecessary words. He simply says: ""If you need another pair of eyes... old eyes that have seen a lot... I'm here."" They become an odd pair: a ghost and a legend, watching each other's back.

2. In Saint Denis, he sees a book about wildflowers in a shop window. He remembers promising to help Miss Lancaster gather a collection. Now that he has time, he begins sketching the flowers he encounters in his wanderings. He is no artist; the drawings are crooked but full of detail. He does not sign them with his name. He anonymously sends the book to Beecher's Hope. Abigail, who finds it, thinks it's a quirk of nature. Only John, upon glancing at a clumsy drawing of a ""golden cat's paw,"" freezes. He doesn't say a word to anyone. But from that day on, he sometimes gazes out at the horizon as if hoping to see a shadow.

Part 3: The Reunion

It happens by chance. Years later. In the town of Blackwater. Arthur, now gray-haired and with a cane, is buying supplies. He hears a gasp, turns around—and sees her. Mary, also aged but just as elegant. She is dressed in black—having buried her father, and then her husband (her marriage was short and unhappy).

They silently look at each other. No panic, no tears. Only a quiet and bitter acceptance.

""I knew,"" she says softly. ""I always knew a man with as much stubbornness as you couldn't just fall off a mountain."" ""Mrs.Gillis,"" he nods, tipping his hat. ""Linton.It's Linton again.""

They go to the park, sit on a bench. They talk about trivial things. The weather. The new trains. They talk about everything except the past. It hangs between them like a heavy, unnecessary burden. As they say goodbye,Mary places an envelope in his hand. Inside is the address of her house in Saint Denis and a single dried flower. ""I don't expect letters,Arthur. But if you should want... to just stop by for tea... the door will be open.""

He does not come immediately. A month passes. Then another. But one autumn day, he stands at her door. Not to start over again. Too much water has passed under the bridge. They are both different people now. But to find a quiet harbor for the sunset of their days. To sometimes sit on the porch in silent understanding, watch the sunset, and know that they are not alone. This is not the passionate love of youth. It is something deeper and calmer—reconciliation and peace.

That, in my opinion, is how his story could have unfolded—not loudly, but quietly, in true cowboy fashion.

1negkjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1negkjo/my_reddit_story_is_starting_to_come_true/,My Reddit story is starting to come true.,"I’m a regular Reddit user. I like posting stories here. Even though my stories don’t get much attention, I don’t write them for fame or money. Writing just makes me feel better. I have dozens of short stories and a few unfinished books. This isn’t even my real job—I work at a gas station. But I’ve always been interested in writing since I was a kid. Usually, I post three or four stories every week in different communities. At best, they get a few thousand views.

But I’m not writing this as fiction.  
For the past few weeks, strange things have been happening. And if I’ve pieced everything together correctly…  
A serial killer is after me, and in a few days, I’m going to die.

I don’t know what triggered the beginning of all this. My shift ended at midnight. It was a normal Friday night. After work, I went home. Before bed, I opened my laptop. I had this crime novel idea in my head for days, and I wanted to start writing it. I wrote until around 3 a.m. I was half-asleep when I typed the last sentence.

*“And at last, the sound of the killer’s footsteps echoed in the empty street.”*

I was proud of the first chapter. I shut down my laptop and went to the kitchen for some water. While drinking, I saw two shadows outside the window. At first, I thought it was just a tree swaying in the wind. Then I heard a woman scream.

I froze. The street was completely empty. The scream cut off suddenly. Now, there were two shadows on the building. One was lying still on the ground. The other was moving. Then it quickly slid out of sight over the roof.

I went outside to check, still in my slippers and pajamas. The street was silent. But when I reached the neighboring building, I couldn’t believe what I saw. A woman was slumped against the wall, covered in blood.

I recognized her. She was the kind lady who brought me pie when I first moved in.

I called 911 and tried to stop the bleeding, but when I checked her pulse, it was gone. She was already dead. The paramedics confirmed it when they arrived. The police asked me a bunch of questions—Did I see the killer? Where was I? Did I notice anything unusual? They took my statement at the station. I got home around 5 a.m., collapsed onto my bed, and thought, this was the worst night of my life since prom.  
If only it had stayed that way.

The next day, I was a mess. I couldn’t focus at work. My boss let me leave early. When I came home, the police had blocked off my street with yellow tape and squad cars. The noise was unbearable, so I turned back to my story. Writing always calmed me down.

I finished writing the second chapter I had planned in my head. After writing the last sentence, I heard a siren from next door.  
*“His final words sent a shiver through him.”*

Later, I went for a walk in the park to clear my head. I sat on a bench, watching kids play, when an old man with a cane sat next to me. He asked, “Did you hear about that murder?”

“I didn’t just hear about it,” I said. “I saw it from my window.”

His eyebrows shot up. “Really?”

“Yeah.”

He sighed. “You can’t trust people anymore. You never know who’s good or evil.”

I nodded. I was suddenly uncomfortable. I stood up to leave. The man called after me:  
“Good day, son. And don’t forget to watch your back.”

I told myself it was nothing. Just a random warning. But his words kept echoing in my head all the way home.

That night, I sat back down at my laptop. I wrote furiously. Hours later, I typed the ending of chapter three:

*“He barely dodged in time. Looking up, he saw that same face staring down at him.”*

The next day at work, things got worse. A black SUV pulled in. The driver got a receipt for gas. Then a woman walked into. She looked strange. Her eyes were wide open, unblinking.

I ignored her. When the man who just got the receipt mentioned a problem with the pump, I went outside. It was acting up occasionally. I helped him. When I came back, she was standing right at the automatic doors. I almost crashed into her. Startled, I stumbled backward—right into the path of the SUV that was pulling out.

I barely avoided getting run over. The woman didn’t even flinch. She just stared at me. For some reason, this woman had really gotten on my nerves.

""What are you doing?""

She didn't answer. Then she turned and walked away.

My shift was over, so I left. When I got home, the police teams and the crime scene were gone. I desperately needed a distraction. I found myself at the computer again. This time, I really felt the urge to write. After 4 hours of uninterrupted writing, I typed the final sentence of the chapter:

*“And finally, he heard the sound he feared. Knock. Knock. Knock.”*

As I always do, I made my coffee and started reading the story I had written from beginning to end. The reason I do this is that I write in parts, so I don't always capture the flow of the story perfectly. While reading, the story took on a whole new dimension in my mind. I read the first part in detail. While correcting typos, something in a line caught my attention.

*""He ran towards the direction of the scream. He knew he was too late. She was already gone. He collapsed beside the woman's lifeless body. And at last, the sound of the killer’s footsteps echoed in the empty street.*

A theory began to form in my head. I continued reading, unconcerned. It was just a coincidence.

*""Every time he tapped his cane on the ground while talking, he flinched. Finally, unable to stand the strange old man any longer, he got up. As he turned around, the old man called out to him. 'Don't forget to check your back.' He didn't reply. The man's last words had caused him to tremble.""*

I started reading the next line. Again, when I reached the last paragraph, I noticed the same thing.

*""He raised his head. He was startled by the bulging eyes that suddenly appeared before him. His feet moved back as if wanting to flee. At this moment, he hadn't noticed the SUV spinning and screaming down the road. He barely dodged in time. Looking up, he saw that same face staring down at him.”*

I sat up straight in my seat. I was in indescribable fear. My eyes welled up as I read the last line.

*He understood now. All the pieces had fallen into place. Even the chair he was sitting on suddenly felt uncomfortable. He couldn't stay in place any longer and jumped up. He paced around frantically, his ears focused on a single sound. He sat on the couch to calm himself. He wanted to believe it was all his imagination. To lessen his fear even a little... He buried his face in the pillow. He waited in horror for the slow sound of the door. And finally, he heard the sound he feared. Knock, knock, knock.*

This couldn't be. It was impossible. I don't know how I didn't realize this while writing. Because I never considered the possibility of something like this happening. I thought I was inspired by my experiences when writing. It was the exact opposite.

I was living what I was writing.

I started pacing the room. I thought about calling the police. There was no crime committed yet. And as I wrote, I hadn't even heard the sound of the door yet. I thought I was mixing up the timelines in my head. Maybe I had lived it first, and then written it, remembering it differently in my head. In fact, I believed this possibility quite strongly. I calmed myself down a bit. As I said, reading too many horror stories made me confuse the real world with fiction. I sat on my couch and sighed. It was all my fabrication. All of it...

And then I heard it.  
Three knocks on my door.

I froze. Looked through the peephole. No one was there.

Maybe I imagined it. Maybe a misheard?

But then, louder this time—  
Three more knocks.

And thirty seconds later—  
Again.

I don’t know what to do. I thought about deleting the story. I even rewrote the ending so the killer just… vanished. But the knocking hasn’t stopped. 

God... maybe this is my last note before I die. I'm going to try to escape. 

If I don’t post again in the next few days… well… I guess my story didn’t get a happy ending.",10,1757615358.0,nosleep,3,1.0,False

Im looking for find someone to build a life with.

A life filled with adventure, discovery, memories, and little things that fill up the gaps.

Let’s bake something new together? I’ll help you clean the kitchen.

Let’s read a new book? I’ll set some tea/coffee for you and put your blanket in the dryer.

Let’s go camping or to the beach? I’ll drive and you’ll be the passenger princess.

Let’s do a late night McDonalds run? You can have my last fry.

There are many more things we can discover together. The things we love, like, dislike, and hate. We can date the old fashioned way and see if we click, perhaps deserving of a second date? Let’s do a cafe date? Let’s go to the movies and I’ll give you a flower. I won’t spoil all my secrets, of course :) we’ll have to level up our relationship to unlock these secret courses 👾🎮

A few things you should know about me though;
*   I don't condone cheating/one night stands.
*   I don't like smoking
*   I respond quickly, so if you'd like me to adjust that; please feel free to ask! (Reddit varies, it doesn't notify me all the time)
*   I love animals and I have a 9 month old kitty.

The things I expect from our relationship;
*   Communication! Please tell me how you feel or how something made you feel. We can make a routine on maybe reviewing how we feel at the end of the week and see what improvements we can make to help accommodate each others needs.
*   Loyalty. I love deeply and you will be my priority above all else. I know actions speak more than words and I'm sure""loyalty"" is self explanatory. I'd rather prove my loyalty above just saying it.
*   Understanding. I am not a perfect human. No one is... I have flaws that I'm working on and actively fixing. My mind works differently. I have ADHD and have been through things in the past that, unfortunately, have left a mark on my mind (le anxiety, people pleasing, etc.) although I have more under control than before; I sometimes slip up.

I hear voices every day, I’m not stable, I feel like I’m breaking down and it’s only going to get worse. The only thing holding me together right now is my writing and coffee, it’s the only thing I can even stomach. My only hope now is to finish one of my novels and publish and make it big and just hope it all works out and that I’m not totally and completely fucked.

And if you’re curious, this is what my parents do. I have a WiFi limit so I only have 4 hours of internet access a day. They have a monitor on my door that flashes every time I enter and exit so they can keep track of me like it’s a fucking bell around my neck. They track my internet and search history and read my messages. They go through my mail and withhold packages and letters if they’re not happy with me. They control when I go out and demand I ask permission to hang out with friends or go places, unless its work because I had a schedule. I’m not allowed to have pets, not even a fish or bug but they were kind enough to let me have a plant I take care of. I’m not allowed to eat any of their food so the kitchen is off limits unless I’m eating my own food that I bought with my own money. I have quiet hours where I’m not allowed to make noise. They also track how much i buy whether it’s groceries or anything for myself, because they think I eat too much even though I usually only eat once a day if I remember to eat. I have to hide packages if I ever order something for myself or I’ll get a scolding because I’m not supposed to buy things for myself. They also make me listen to bible propaganda videos and constantly try to convert me to christian Zionism because they say I’m going to hell for supporting Palestine and that I’m going to be “left behind” when the tribulation happens on September 22nd this year.

Part of Samantha's healing path is guided by Charles (an enigmatic sage), wild water, a weeping willow, a mysterious manuscript, a watchful crow, fragmented memories of a forgotten past, and a cozy cabin.

# Chapter 1 - The Way In

With every mile of her escape, the city skyline slowly softens in her rear-view mirror as she slips away from its grip. A worn brass key dangles from a red ribbon, replacing the cardboard pine air freshener. As Samantha glances away from the mirror, a weary thought surfaces. *Maybe now I won't need to watch my back all the time*. Sweaty hands clench the steering wheel. *Too hard*. As traffic thins, she breathes—really breathes—for the first time in months. *God, I'd forgotten what it felt like to let my guard down.* A breath carrying the first hint of freedom. Hands loosen. Summer humidity wraps around her, a smothering blanket holding her too tight. Yet something deeper, a voice long silenced, gives a name to the stirring beneath the surface. Possibility.

*Away.* The word has been a silent mantra for too long, a desperate plea repeated in the anxious stillness before dawn. Away from the sirens that wail in her memory, away from the patronizing sympathy in colleagues' eyes, away from the four walls of her apartment that started to feel less like a sanctuary and more like a cage. Away from it all. Everything inside her has twisted into a tangled knot, too complex and too painful to unravel, especially while driving. *Later. Maybe.*

For now, there is only the hypnotic rhythm of the tires on the asphalt, the lush landscape, a blur through her windows like a loose watercolor painting, and the promise of the Turners’ empty house somewhere ahead. A quiet place where her spinning thoughts and the city's constant roar might finally, mercifully, recede. Samantha pictures its weathered porch steps, the creaking screen door, spaces untouched by the city. A place holding only distant summer memories, preserved like the dried violets she kept in her diary, faded, but never forgotten. A safe haven offered with a casual note: *Here’s the key. It's empty all summer. Use it if you need to disappear for a while.* Every mile marker she passes feels like a small, crucial victory against the undertow threatening to pull her under. The road, her lifeline. Forward. That is all that matters now. Forward, and away from the torrent of emotions she can’t yet name, much less face.

She finishes her now cold coffee, grabbed earlier from her corner cafe, Common Grounds. *That’s the only thing I’ll miss in the city.* The dense woods lining the highway gradually thin, giving way to sprawling fields interrupted by stands of tall pines. Their dark silhouettes etched against the morning sky, windbreaks for the surrounding farmland. As Samantha opens her window, the distinctive scent of pine floods the car–sharp, ancient, and achingly nostalgic.

The woodsy aroma unlocks something deep. Suddenly, she is twelve again, riding this same stretch of road in the back seat of the Turners’ old station wagon, pressed close to Emma. Hair wind-whipped and wild, both of them. The girls whispered and giggled, sharing secrets under the protective drone of adult conversation from the front seat. The thrill of having an entire summer ahead, together. Laughing like nothing could ever touch them. Time moved differently, quicker, lighter. Everything felt possible then. Expansive.

Samantha blinks, pulling herself back to the present, to the steering wheel beneath her hands. That summer, the four-hour journey to the Turners’ house had felt like mere minutes, marked by license plate games and punch-buggy contests. Laughter had filled the car. Now, solitude transforms the same journey into something longer. Quieter.

She glances at the passenger seat and feels the stark emptiness beside her. Just her and the road and the thoughts she can’t outrun.

That memory of Emma comforts her. A reminder that the place she is headed to holds something different from what she was leaving behind. There, in that house, in those woods, she had once known a simpler joy.

Samantha shifts in her seat, exhaling slowly. As the memory slowly dissolves, her body remains stubbornly braced, unwilling to fully release its guard. *The Body Keeps the Score,* she reminds herself. That book her therapist had suggested. *I haven’t always felt this way*. Her younger self remembers.

The smell of the sawmill snaps her to the present. She almost misses her turn, braking just before the faded sign for Old Crow Lumber. She and Emma had always looked for its painted crow, the official landmark that finally silenced their chorus of ""Are we there yet?"" 

*That's how it's been lately, I don't remember getting someplace. Autopilot. My body's here, but I'm not.* She flexes her fingers on the wheel, grounding herself in the feel of worn leather. Samantha breathes in through her nose, slow. Again. The fuzzy edges of herself settle slightly, drawn back into the here and now.

She turns into the gravel driveway, maneuvering around the deep ridges and ruts left by seasons of weather and travel. Parking near the foot of the stone walkway, she sits for a moment, hands still gripping the wheel. Finally, she steps out, pulls the scrunchy from her hair, and stretches. She reaches back in for the key dangling from the mirror.

After grabbing her bags from the trunk, Samantha hauls them to the porch. The wooden steps creak under her weight. She shifts her bags to one hand and yanks open the wooden screen door, stepping quickly into the screened porch. The spring-loaded door slams shut behind her, the sharp crack making her whole body jolt. *Just a door. Just an old door.*

She slides the brass key into the lock, the red ribbon soft between her fingers. It turns smoothly, welcoming her in. She steps inside. The air hangs heavy, the kind of stillness that settles in when no one’s been home for a while. Beneath the mustiness, she finds not just the house's true scent of old wood and lavender sachets, but a deep, unexpected comfort. *Empty but safe.* The four-hour drive and morning coffee demand immediate attention. She drops her bags with a thud and hurries toward the back of the house.

The bathroom is just as Samantha remembers it: comforting in its small, clean simplicity. After washing her hands, she lets the cool water run over her wrists for a moment before she moves on, pulling back curtains and opening windows that have been closed while the house sat empty. Dust floats lazily in the late morning light now flooding the rooms. Fresh air drifts in through the open windows, slowly clearing the heavy stagnancy.

She retrieves a bottle of water and protein bar from her bag, steps back outside, and sits on the porch steps to take it all in. *Ah, fresh cut grass. That’s something you don’t smell in the city.*

A gentle breeze moves through the upper branches, a soft sigh in the trees like someone slowly exhaling. She doesn’t notice the birdsong, not at first. Her body is still shaking off the buzz of traffic and machines, the static of too much of everything. It takes her a moment to realize the quiet isn’t silent. Her ears are still adjusting, as if tuned to an old frequency, muffled by the echo of a life that hasn’t quite let go. The stillness isn't empty at all. It's layered. She begins to distinguish the variety in the calls—a sharp chirp from a nearby bush and longer, melodic songs off in the distance.

A memory surfaces of the stream. That hidden, secret place where she and Emma had built fairy houses from twigs and moss. Sunlight dancing and shifting through the branches overhead, the hushed whisper of water that seemed to speak just to them. A place that had once felt like magic itself. *Is it still there? Still the same?* The thought rises unbidden, almost urgent. As if that particular spot might hold something she needs right now—some answer or solace that can't be found anywhere else. Her heart quickens slightly. The house can wait. The stream calls.

Samantha walks around front. Her eyes scan the dense treeline at the edge of the property, searching for the sign, a remembered starting point. *Where had it begun?* Then she sees it, its weeping branches a cascade of green against the summer sky – the old willow. Its thick, leaning trunk still holds the quiet strength she recalls, while its long, graceful branches form the same green veil from her childhood. It looks older than she remembers, its posture unchanged, still holding a silent promise of protection. The tree has always marked the hidden entrance, the secret threshold to the world she and Emma once claimed as their own. Their watchful guardian.

Drawn towards it, Samantha crosses the field, her steps growing lighter with each stride. As she approaches, the details of the tree come into sharper focus, the deep furrows in its bark, the particular shade of green that belongs only to willow leaves, the way it reaches skyward and bows earthward simultaneously. The willow seems to recognize her too–its leaves stirring in the faint breeze as though beckoning her closer. 

She ducks beneath the canopy of trailing branches, entering the partial shade of its sacred space. With reverent hesitation, she extends her hand, pressing her palm against the weathered trunk. The bark feels cool and rough, solid beneath her touch. The texture and strange, almost bitter scent of willow wood ground her. Years fall away. Standing in the willow’s embrace, she glimpses a version of herself she’s nearly forgotten—one kept alive here, quietly waiting for her return, and remembrance. With a long exhale, she softens and feels something just as precious. Connection.

She closes her eyes.

The filtered light created patterns across their faces. Emma was saying something, her voice low and serious, then broke into laughter when Sam responded. The ground beneath them was soft with years of fallen leaves. Their natural cathedral, a sanctuary of whispers and shared laughter, a magical world spun from summer days and childhood secrets and dreams. They were invisible here, safe. Witnessed.

As Samantha opens her eyes, the moment lingers like warmth after a gentle touch. Her gaze drops to her hand where it rests against the ancient tree, a physical anchor connecting then and now. *Not a girl's hand anymore.* A few faint sunspots, the thin lines mapping the skin around her knuckles. *Forty-two*. The number feels foreign. *Where did all those years go?*

""Help me find my way,"" she whispers to the willow. She turns, studying the boundary where shadow edges into the sunlight. And there it is—the faint depression of a deer trail winding between the stately trunks, revealed only by the way pine needles have been tamped down by repeated passage. The way in.

*This feels good, being back.*

*Should I be wandering off alone like this?*

Among these, pasta holds a special place—a comforting, versatile, and universally beloved dish that feels like a warm hug in a bowl. Whether it’s a rich and creamy Alfredo, a zesty tomato-based marinara, or a simple garlic and olive oil spaghetti, pasta consistently draws people in with its promise of satisfaction and soul-soothing flavor.

But why exactly has pasta become such a staple in cafés everywhere? What is it about this humble dish that resonates so deeply with so many people? In this blog, we’ll explore the timeless appeal of pasta, its role in café culture, and why it will likely remain everyone’s favorite café dish for years to come.

**The Universal Appeal of**[ Pasta](https://www.forkandflame.mydt.in/fork-and-flame-pasta/)**: More Than Just Food**

At its core, pasta is simple: flour, water, and sometimes eggs. Yet this simplicity gives rise to a dish that is endlessly adaptable, comforting, and deeply satisfying. Here’s why pasta connects with people universally:

**1. Comfort Food at Its Finest**

Pasta is classic comfort food. Its warm, hearty nature satisfies hunger while evoking a sense of nostalgia and home. The softness of the noodles paired with flavorful sauces creates a soothing mouthfeel that many associate with family dinners, cozy nights, or simple pleasures.

Comfort food does more than fill your stomach—it nurtures your soul. Pasta fits this bill perfectly, offering familiarity and warmth in every bite.

**2. Endless Variety and Adaptability**

One of pasta’s greatest strengths is its versatility. There’s a pasta shape and sauce combination to suit virtually every taste and dietary preference. From creamy Alfredo and rich Bolognese to light pesto or tangy puttanesca, pasta can be transformed endlessly.

This adaptability makes pasta ideal for cafés looking to cater to diverse customers—vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, or meat lovers—without sacrificing flavor or appeal.

**3. A Social and Shareable Dish**

Pasta is often enjoyed communally—shared plates of spaghetti, platters of penne or rigatoni passed around a table. This social aspect adds to its charm, making it perfect for cafés where friends, families, and coworkers gather.

**Pasta’s Place in Cafe Culture**

Cafés have evolved into much more than just coffee stops. They are social hubs, casual dining spots, and sometimes even workspaces. Pasta fits seamlessly into this culture for several reasons:

**1. Comfort Meets Casual Dining**

Cafés thrive on offering food that feels both comforting and casual. Pasta dishes fit this niche perfectly—they are hearty yet informal, satisfying without being overly heavy.

You don’t need utensils you don’t know how to use, and pasta plates can be eaten slowly over conversation or work. This makes pasta an ideal café dish.

**2. Quick Yet Satisfying**

Unlike some restaurant meals that require longer preparation, pasta dishes can be prepared relatively quickly. This suits cafés where customers may be stopping in between errands or meetings, wanting something filling but not time-consuming.

**3. Perfect Pairing with Coffee and Other Beverages**

Many cafe-goers enjoy a beverage alongside their meal. Pasta’s rich flavors pair well with a variety of drinks—from a bold espresso to a refreshing iced tea or sparkling water. This harmony enhances the overall café experience.

**The Science of Comfort: Why Pasta Feels So Good**

Beyond cultural reasons, there’s scientific backing to why pasta satisfies on such a deep level:

* **Carbohydrate Content**: Pasta is a rich source of carbohydrates, which the body converts into glucose—a key energy source for the brain and muscles. This energy boost can improve mood and focus.
* **Serotonin Release**: Eating carbohydrates like pasta triggers the release of serotonin, the “feel-good” neurotransmitter. This explains why a bowl of pasta can lift spirits and reduce stress.
* **Warmth and Texture**: The warmth of a freshly cooked pasta dish combined with its tender, chewy texture triggers sensory pleasure, making the eating experience more enjoyable.

**Signature Pasta Dishes Loved in Cafés Worldwide**

While pasta’s core ingredients remain the same, every culture and café often adds its own twist. Here are some popular pasta dishes that have become café staples:

**1. Spaghetti Bolognese**

A hearty, meaty tomato sauce simmered with herbs and served over spaghetti, Bolognese is a classic favorite. It’s rich, filling, and widely loved for its robust flavors.

**2. Fettuccine Alfredo**

Creamy, buttery, and indulgent, Alfredo is perfect for those craving richness. It’s a dish that speaks to comfort and luxury at the same time.

**3. Penne Arrabbiata**

For spice lovers, Arrabbiata’s fiery tomato sauce with chili flakes adds excitement and warmth. It’s a bold choice that many cafés feature as a signature dish.

**4. Pesto Pasta**

Bright, fresh, and herbaceous, pesto pasta offers a lighter alternative. Made from basil, pine nuts, garlic, and Parmesan, it’s vibrant and satisfying.

**5. Macaroni and Cheese**

Though sometimes overlooked as “kid food,” gourmet macaroni and cheese dishes have found a new life in cafés, often made with artisan cheeses and creative add-ins like truffle oil or bacon.

**Pasta and Dietary Trends: Inclusivity and Innovation**

Modern cafés must cater to a range of dietary needs, and pasta adapts beautifully:

* **Gluten-Free Options**: With the rise of gluten sensitivities, many cafés now offer gluten-free pasta made from rice, corn, or legumes, ensuring everyone can enjoy.
* **Plant-Based and Vegan**: Pasta itself is vegan by nature. Pair it with vegetable-based sauces, nut cheeses, or mushrooms, and you have a vegan-friendly café favorite.
* **Whole Grain and High-Protein**: For health-conscious customers, whole grain or legume-based pastas provide extra fiber and protein, adding nutritional value without compromising comfort.

**How Cafés Can Elevate the Pasta Experience**

To keep pasta beloved and relevant, cafés often experiment with:

* **Locally Sourced Ingredients**: Fresh, local produce and artisanal cheeses elevate pasta from simple to exceptional.
* **Creative Twists**: Infusing traditional recipes with unexpected ingredients—like roasted vegetables, exotic spices, or seasonal herbs—keeps menus exciting.
* **Presentation**: Serving pasta beautifully—garnished with fresh herbs, a drizzle of quality olive oil, or a sprinkle of Parmesan—turns a simple dish into a feast for the eyes.

**The Emotional Connection: Pasta as a Mood Booster**

When we crave pasta, we’re often seeking more than nutrition. We’re looking for comfort, nostalgia, and a little self-care. A café bowl of pasta can be a quiet moment of indulgence, a mid-day pick-me-up, or a communal sharing experience with friends.

Pasta reminds us of home, tradition, and the joy of simple pleasures. It’s no wonder it remains a universal favorite.

**Final Thoughts**

In cafes around the world, pasta continues to shine as a dish that offers warmth, flavor, and comfort all in one bowl. Its versatility, familiarity, and emotional resonance make it the perfect café meal—whether you’re dining alone, catching up with friends, or grabbing a quick bite.

So next time you visit your favorite café and scan the menu, remember: pasta isn’t just a meal—it’s comfort in a bowl. And that’s why it will always hold a special place in our hearts and on our plates.

I was about nine years old, and he let me help build a simple birdhouse in his garage. The smell of fresh-cut wood, the sound of nails being tapped into place—it stuck with me. Ever since then, woodworking has been my quiet escape.

But life, as it tends to do, got busy. Between raising kids, working long hours at my job in Ohio, and just trying to keep up with the day-to-day grind, my tools started collecting dust in the basement. Every now and then, I’d get a burst of inspiration, but half the time I couldn’t find the right plans, or I’d start a project and realize halfway through I didn’t have the right cuts or measurements. More than once, I abandoned projects halfway finished, frustrated and defeated.

A few years back, after a particularly bad weekend where I ruined what was supposed to be a new coffee table, I told my wife, “Maybe woodworking just isn’t for me anymore.” Saying it out loud stung, because deep down, I didn’t want to give up—I just didn’t know how to get back on track.

[That’s when I came across TedsWoodworking. At first, I figured it would be like the countless other plan books I’d tried, but what made the difference was the sheer variety and clarity. The instructions were straightforward, the diagrams actually made sense, and the projects ranged from simple to advanced, so I could ease back in without feeling overwhelmed.](https://freezegluco.com/Woodworking.html)

I started small—a set of shelves for the garage. When they turned out sturdy and square (something I hadn’t managed in a while), it lit a spark. Next came a bench for the backyard, then a jewelry box for my daughter’s birthday. Each project gave me back a little more confidence.

The moment I knew woodworking was truly part of me again was last Christmas. I built a handmade toy chest for my grandson, complete with carved handles and a smooth finish. Watching his little eyes light up as he opened it, knowing I had made something with my own two hands—that was priceless.

Woodworking isn’t just about saws, nails, and wood. For me, it’s about slowing down, focusing, and creating something that will outlast me. It’s about carrying on what my grandfather passed down. And now, every time I step into the garage, I don’t feel frustrated anymore—I feel excited.",1,1757614591.0,TriedAndRated,0,1.0,False

Hello fellow Satisfactory enjoyers.



With 1.1 coming out I felt like playing this game again. So I watched a bunch of content to check if that would satisfy that urge.

It obviously didn't but I was inspired and intrigued by Nilaus' BUS base. If you haven't seen it, here is a link for you:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtpXYvbgwWI&list=PLV3rF--heRVuSN0-fSMyShBgQAdaxUOxK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtpXYvbgwWI&list=PLV3rF--heRVuSN0-fSMyShBgQAdaxUOxK)

So I created a new save to build a BUS base of my own where I would replicate Nilaus' ideas and add a few new ones.

The BUS was completed yesterday, on Satisfactory's birthday. Unplanned perfect timing made me happy. Happy birthday Satisfactory!



Here are the main features:

\- Module based building. Each production line is a blueprint module that branches from the BUS and then feeds back into it.

\- Starter module for each production line with a storage, a sink and a dimensional depot (if the output is needed by the build gun).

\- 2 BUS floors. Bottom one for basic resources like ingots, oil products, water, etc., coming from around the world. Upper floor for modules output.

\- 14 lanes on each floor. Bottom ones have up to 3 belts, upper on up to 2. Oddly didn't need more.

\- Modules are built on both side of the BUS.

\- Items are branched of the BUS using a ""Grabber"" blueprint. Items are picked from the bottom belt, which is immediatly refilled by the upper belts.

\- Upper floor items are replaced by the last item that uses it. Or their lane simply stops and a new item takes the spot.

\- See screenshots for resources consumed and items produced (one is from a small application I made to help me keep track of modules, resources, items).



A few notes:

\- No Power Shards or Somersloops are used in any of the modules. Self imposed rule. I wanted to see the amount of resources and modules required for Project Assembly. Plus that would make the BUS base bigger.

\- That resulted in a suprising low amount of Power usage (at least compared to my other playthrough). Only using an old Coal plant (32 generators), some geothermals and a Rocket Fuel Plant (600 crude).

\- Forced myself not to plan too much ahead. I wanted to run in some trouble along the way and have problems to solve.

\- The parts I did actually plan were the number of lanes and the replacement of items on the BUS as they stopped being useful. That part was fun and surprisingly I did not mess up that much.

\- Forced myself to feed 2 Alien Power Augmenters with Alien Power Matrixes, something I haven't done in my previous playthrough.

\- Used Rocket Fuel as main power source for the same reason. That stuff is great holy crap.

\- There are few factories in the world outside of the BUS base (at least compared to my previous playthrough). Producing mainly Power, BUS resources and Pioneer equipment.

\- Some of those factories are for items that are not produced by any of the modules but that I needed. Like Quickwire, Silica, Jetpack fuel, Ammo, etc..

\- Chest markers on the map are those factories and upload to a dimensional depot.

\- Rock markers are BUS resources production (Ingots, Silica, Plastic, etc.).

\- Factory marker is an Empty Fluid Tank factory, for Rocket and Ionized Fuel production.

\- Power markers for Power Plants obviously.

\- Cross is an unused Copper Ingot factory (I messed up, don't ask).

\- BUS base started on Tier 5 with Mk.4 belts. This is why modules do not strictly follow milestones progression (like Cable after Steel).

\- Upgrading belts to Mk.5 then to Mk.6 in the BUS and some blueprints felt terrible, then great once it was done. Love those Mk.6 belts. 

\- Alternates recipes choices were for efficiency or to use different ones than in my previous playthrough (forced myself to use more Iron this time). Do not seek any logic there.

\- Most items are produced in excess, nothing is in deficit (Except Dark Matter Residue, as it should).

\- Had to double a few module input/output lines due to thoughput issues. Pain.

\- Moved some of the Wire production to some modules, so that I would not have to add a 3rd line. I regret putting that damn Wire on the BUS.

\- Had to resupply the BUS with some resources between modules (Iron mostly). Mk6 belts do come in late.

\- Replaced Iron Plate With RIPs even though Singularity Cells use them later on. I liked the idea of items transforming into their more advanced selves on the BUS.

\- Blueprint designer Mk.3 comes in late. Had to create blueprints for some Particle accelerator modules retroactively. This is still bothering me.

\- Those Quantum Encoders do no fit in Mk3 either. Had to place them diagonally. This is still bothering me.

\- Did not really need to use drones to resupply the BUS, but I thought that was a cool thing in Nilaus' playthrough. So I talked myself into it.

\- Did not put Ficsite Ingots on the BUS as they are only used for Trigons. I directly supplied the Trigon starter module using a drone.

\- Went overboard anticipating Dark Matter Residue, made a lane of 9 pipes, only using 4.

\- Crystal oscillators, damn, 30 modules. Ran into a cliff had to go up a few foundations.

\- Not at final sink points yet, some endgame items output storages are not filled yet.



Took quite some time setting up infrastructure, bringing in resources and creating blueprints before starting the BUS.

But once the BUS started it went flying. It feels great adding new production lines to the BUS or scaling up production.

Need a new item produced? Load a blueprint using the same machine in the designer, change recipe, save, voilà. Done.

Almost took more time updating my signs and application with the new values.

Also it was pretty funny sometimes. After adding a module an item would be at a deficit and that deficit would cascade down the line as I added modules to fill that deficit.

Kind of the opposite of a normal playthough.

Overall a very satisfying playthrough, had a blast. 10/10 would recommend for a different experience.

Big shoutout and thanks to Nilaus for the inspiration, and thank you Coffee Stain Studios for making this awesome game!

But heres an interaction i had with Clive customer service during the search. I’ve been told they’re a good company so i looked for a good deal. I guess they nerfed their already modest $50 discount code to $15 and must spend $900 😂

And apparently if you don’t spend $100s of dollars with them before you refer people to them it’s considered “abusing the system” (what????)

Context: they used to have a $50 discount code but now it’s $15 and must spend $900+",0,1757614415.0,espresso,17,0.35,False

It was such a tiny thing but it honestly made my whole morning feel nicer. Funny how little stuff like that can change your mood.😊

Now I’m curious what random small thing happened to you today that made you smile? Could be someone holding the door open, your coffee being perfect, or just hearing a song you love.

I feel like these little moments are what make life less boring, so I thought it would be fun to share.😉",27,1757614413.0,CasualConversation,33,1.0,False

I look around and most people my age are still joking about the same stuff from high school, chasing distraction after distraction. I don’t wanna judge, but it feels like I’m on a diff wavelength completely.

Couple months ago I had this random convo with a 26 y/o at a coffee shop. We ended up talking about books, travel, life goals. It felt natural, like I didn’t need to put on a mask or force small talk. Just real human connection. That made me realize: I crave depth more than I crave “fitting in.”

So here’s the self-improvement part: I’m trying to stop forcing myself into spaces where I don’t belong, and instead lean into circles that make me feel alive. For me, that means:

* reading more so I can bring value into convos
* practicing listening (not just waiting for my turn to speak)
* not feeling guilty when I don’t vibe with “my age group”

Growth is realizing you don’t have to lower your frequency just to match the room. You can raise it until the right people tune in.

Anyone else go through this shift early on? How did you handle it without isolating yourself?",1,1757614387.0,selfimprovementday,1,0.67,False
