We got a coffee, drove around chatting. Everything was good but out of no where, her phone rang and it was a male friend of hers and they chatted for 5 minutes.    

And about two hours he called again, we pulled over and she chated for probably 10 minutes,  I heard him ask her what are you doing,  she said I was bored so I went and got a coffee. 

She explained to me why she has to talk to him when he calls.
So we met up again and the same guy or someone else called her while we was in a store, she ignored me and said she's gonna go out sit down. And 10 minutes later I comes out and there still chatting.  So I said I have to walk over here I need to pick up something I need right now, so she stayed on the phone, didn't go in with me, 10 mins later I come out and she says to the guy in the phone she had to go. 

We talked for a half hour and I told her I have to go now. 

I think on a first date you shouldn't chat with a guy on the phone. 

What should I do? I feel like i should just not message her anymore, because if she could talk to her male friend while on a first date with me, she will do it all the time.

Plus because of that I didn't really fe any connection. ",1,1736345280.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1hwkzna,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1hwkzna/intrigued_with_the_idea_of_opening_a_health_tea/,"Intrigued with the idea of opening a “health tea” shop, but need direction?","Hey guys,

I’ve searched the sub and read various posts about opening coffee/cafe shops; I realize the risks involved with those types of businesses. My wife and I recently visited a small coffee shop near our favorite B&B, and they were serving these Lotus drinks. They were pretty delicious and the inside was quaint and relaxing. We naturally had the conversation of opening a shop by us.

On our side of the state, there is nothing like a Lotus drink, but there are a few “healthy tea” spots in town. Without diving too deep, the main difference is Lotus is a more juice/spritzer drink, but they taste way better than the healthy teas, imo. As far as I can tell, outside of product, the only “machinery” I would need would be a soda type machine for seltzer/soda water and an ice maker. 

This is certainly a niche market, but with the healthy tea craze right now, I believe in our city it would be a good venture. I’m looking for some insight to these types of businesses, maybe some ideas to help bring it to fruition, or other types of products to couple together to boost traffic.

1hwkyee,https://i.redd.it/9lrf1wud1sbe1.jpeg,(Theory) Why Godot is obsessed with coffee,"On the surface this seems like a silly question. Obviously they just wanted the big bad prosecutor of T&T to have a funny gimmick like Franziska did, but I think it goes a little deeper than that.

Coffee symbolizes Godot’s past. He’s a man consumed by rage and ignorance unable to come to terms with his lover’s death, choosing to take it out on someone that doesn’t have anything to do with it.

He can’t move on from what happened, and this is his downfall. He is obsessed with coffee in a similar manner, almost always clutching a cup in his hand and taking a sip.

It was a poisoned cup of coffee that killed him and its coffee that gives him purpose during his resurrection. Mia’s death, like black coffee, is bitter and hard to swallow, but he can’t let go of either of them as the broken, crippled man he has become.


TLDR: Godot drinks coffee because he’s sad that Mia died

I feel like if you make it, you owe it to the rest of the people to share how you did it.

So here’s how we got our first 100 users in four steps.

The [project](https://buildpad.io/?ref=Reddit) I’m writing about continued growing and is now at 3,000+ users after about three months since launching.

So this is exactly how we did it, without spending a dollar.

**I'll try to be as concise as possible because I know reading a wall of text is boring.**

I'll start from the beginning:

**1. Coming up with the idea**

How did we come up with our idea?

We experienced a problem ourselves that we wanted to solve.

We knew the pain of the problem and we felt the strong need for a solution ourselves.

We spent a few days on market research, head-scratching, and coffee drinking, then an idea for a solution began to take shape.

We wanted to see if others experienced the problem as well, to make sure building a solution for it would be worth our time.

To check interest, we created a survey and shared it on our target audience's subreddit.

To get people to respond we made sure to offer them something in return for taking the time. In our case it was giving them feedback on their projects. **Give something to get something.**

This can take a few tries so if you don't get many responses > improve post and try again.

**2. Building the product**

We got positive feedback on the idea so went ahead and built an MVP (minimum viable product).

We did this to test the market and to see if people liked the basic version of our product before we commit and spend all the time and effort building a full product.

I highly recommend building an MVP first. It allows you to ship faster, collect feedback, and use that feedback to shape your product into something the market actually wants.

After about 30 days of building, it was finished.

**3. Simple way to get the first users through the door**

To get our first users for it we shared the MVP with the survey participants and did a launch post on their subreddit.

This is a simple way to get your first users because you have already established contact with them, they experience the problem you’re solving, and they have expressed interest in your idea.

This gave us our first 3 users!

Not bad.

We need more.

**4. Growing from your first users to 100+**

To keep growing our initial user base, we kept posting in communities of our target audience for two weeks.

* Daily posts in the Build in Public community on X (sharing behind-the-scenes of launch, giving advice, connecting with founders).
* Posting every other day in subreddits related to founders on Reddit

These were posts talking about subjects related to our project and would often end with mentioning our product.

Our total users after two weeks..

**100!**

Two weeks, 100 users. It felt amazing! We had never seen this type of hype for our previous projects.

This method:

* Doesn’t take too much time.
* Doesn’t take too much effort.
* Doesn’t cost any money.

You can do it too if you apply yourself.

At this point you've got an MVP and you have your first users. Now all you do is get as much feedback as possible and improve your product.

All the time we've spent improving our product based on user feedback has definitely made marketing easier for us, so I highly recommend it!

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

I (21F) was a teen mother. My daughter's (3 years) father has never been around and it's just been her and I for her whole life. 

I started dating my gf (23F) about 8 months ago. It took me a long time to introduce her to my daughter because I wanted to protect her, but gf promised me she would accept my daughter and I believed her. 

The first meeting went great! They got along, and gf told me afterward that she was excited to get to know my little girl more. That meant so much to me because my daughter is the most important thing in my entire life and knowing they got along made me so happy. 

About 2 months went by and gf would come over for dinner or just hang out, and she and my daughter continued getting along. I thought everything was great. 

The first night, gf stayed the night at my house, and my daughter woke us up at 4am because she got sick in her bed. She's a toddler, it happens. I didn't expect or ask gf to help, I just got up and cleaned up my daughter. 

After everything was cleaned up, my daughter and I got comfortable on the couch and watched cartoons. I texted gf and told her I would stay on the couch with my daughter, and gf seemed okay with that; she even came out of the room and sat with us.

My daughter eventually fell asleep, and I got up to get coffee, and gf came with me. Something seemed to be bothering her and I asked what was wrong, but I wish I didn't. 

She said that she was jealous. This obviously made me very confused and I asked what was making her feel jealous. She said that I was ""spending too much time"" with my daughter and she was upset that I didn't come back to bed. 

At first, I tried to be understanding because I know dating someone with a young child is a lot to take on. But she kept saying that she should be my main priority, not my daughter and even started insulting my parenting and telling me I should've just sent my daughter back to bed instead of staying up with her. 

I was dumbfounded but, again, kept calm because a) I didn't want to wake my daughter and b) again, I know it's a lot dating someone with a young child. 

I explained to her that my daughter is my main priority, she's only 3 and has known no one but me her whole life, but that I would try to spend more time with her.  Gf just rolled her eyes and said it was ridiculous how much time my daughter was getting and that I should just put her into daycare or something so I could give her my whole attention. 

I had never seen this side of gf before, and I was tired; plus, I am very protective of my daughter, so I lost it on her. I told her she was the one being ridiculous and that she was crazy if she thought I would ever choose her over my little girl. I also told her that I don't want to be with someone who's so insecure that they're jealous of a child. That made her angry and storm out. 

She texted me a few days later saying I was being an asshole and overreacting. A few of our mutual friends and even my brother have also said that I was overreacting and being ""bitchy"" about it. 

I'm a bit conflicted because I don't regret choosing my daughter over gf, but maybe I did overreact a bit? I just think some outside perspective would help and I'm curious if there are any different ways I could have approached this. ",0,1736344845.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,0.5,False

I see this question being asked a lot more, and I think that’s because in spite of creatine being relatively “mainstream”, the stream it was mostly found in was the mass of people looking to improve their physical performance and appearance, with the added hope of putting on some serious muscle. Of course, creatine is not going to magically give you rippling delts, huge lats, and a 6-pack to boot. But now, it seems that ‘regular’ people are showing a lot more interest. 

I’m not sure where that interest stems from, but it’s certainly worth diving into creatine as a supplement and whether your mom should be dipping into your supplement cupboard to sneak a scoop. 

So, what is creatine and should you supplement with it?

Creatine is a naturally occurring compound synthesized from the amino acids glycine and arginine, and is predominantly stored in skeletal muscles and the brain. It plays a critical role in regenerating adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy carrier in cells, thereby supporting energy intensive activities - running, lifting weights, and even cognition.

Because of the importance of creatine the body creates it endogenously, meaning it produces it without having to obtain it through it dietary sources, although it is also contained in foods like red meat and seafood, but this is where supplementation comes into play - is your boy making enough for you to perform optimally? Certainly, if you can walk around, run, lift weights etc. you have a sufficient amount being made and obtained through your diet, but what about if you want to perform even better, run further, get those extra reps, and maybe even eek out a few extra marks on that test or find those key words during a presentation, is creatine the answer? Based on hundreds of studies performed over the last couple of decades, the likely answer is yes!

Impact on Muscular Performance and Strength

Extensive research has demonstrated that creatine supplementation enhances muscular performance, particularly during high-intensity, short duration exercises such as weightlifting and sprinting. A study published in the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition reported that creatine supplementation, combined with resistance training, significantly increased muscle strength across various populations (Wang et al., 2024). Now, if living and living well until you turn 100 is a goal of yours like it is mine, than you should know just how important strength is as you age. Want to pick up your grand or great-grand kids? What about travelling? Those suitcase wheels aren’t going to put it into the overhead compartment for you. And oh no, the elevator is down (as it always is) are you going to spend the next 48 hours in the lobby waiting for the repairman? Not if you’ve got well established strength! Additionally, a review in Sports Medicine found that creatine use can increase maximum power and performance in high-intensity anaerobic repetitive work by 5-15%, that may not seem like much, but ask any gym bro if they want to increase their bench press by 15% and they’ll ask where they need to stick the needle… maybe its not that impressive, but for a regular person this could be the addition of an extra 1-2 reps per exercise, or a faster sprint. It also means overtime becoming stronger and improving your performance and ability to handle strenuous activity, which in turn benefits almost every physical process in your body - think arterial and cardiovascular system.

Effects on Cognition

Beyond its physical benefits, creatine has been investigated for its potential cognitive advantages. A systematic review in Experimental Gerontology indicated that short term memory and intelligence/reasoning might be improved by creatine supplementation, though results across studies	were conflicting. Another study in Scientific Reports found that a single does of creatine (5g) improved cognitive performance and induced changes in cerebral high-energy phosphates during sleep deprivation.

For those that struggle with sleep, creatine may also be a useful addition to one’s morning smoothie or on the side of a cup of coffee, especially on days where you were only able to clock 3-5 hours. A 2024 study that subjected participants to 3-5 hours of sleep per night were then given supplemental creatine. The results showed that participants receiving creatine showed better results in both cognitive and physical tests than the control group. 


Additional Benefits

Neuroprotection and the delaying of certain neurodegenerative diseases has become far more mainstream, rightly so. Clinical trials involving creatine supplementation have examined it’s use in the treatment and delaying of progression and symptoms in Huntington’s Disease (HD) and Parkinson’s Disease. In one double blind study doses of up to 30 grams of creatine were administered to participants daily, while the other group received a placebo. MRI looked at brain atrophy at different times throughout the study to examine disease progression and brain atrophy. It was found at the 6 month mark through MRI that the participants receiving creatine showed lower rates of brain atrophy compared to the placebo group, suggesting the creatine may be useful in slowing the progression of HD. Of course, we have to consider this is only one study, and 30 grams is a fairly significant does compared to what is recommended for the general population, but the mechanism by which they believe creatine to be neuroprotective by providing additional ATP resources to the brain appear to attenuate the disease’s impact on the brain. 




Dosing and Safety
Creatine has repeatedly been found to be safe for most people with few side effects apart from gastrointestinal issues in some individuals, especially at higher doses, above 5 grams per day. There are always exceptions, and anyone that may have kidney disease or that is taking prescription medication that may impact kidney function should be cautioned when considering supplementing with creatine. As with all supplements, consideration and discussion with their physician is recommended. The typical recommended dose is 5g, though it would appear higher dosing, in the 10g, 15g, even 30g range depending is tolerated, depending on your reason for supplementing with creatine will likely dictate the amount needed. For muscular strength and performance 5g seems to be sufficient, though someone carrying a significant amount of muscle may require more. It would also appear that there are diminishing returns and taking 20g+ would not be more beneficial, unless looking for neurological benefits, though I think larger and more studies are needed to support the use of creatine in those applications. Finally, there has often been discussion about ‘loading phases’, where a higher dose is consumed in the first week to saturate muscles, which typically lasts 5-7 days and then tapers to a regular 5g dose proceeding the loading phase. There’s been debate about whether or not that is effective, and given some people’s intolerance of higher dosing, it’s recommended to simply take 5g daily. It can take up to 4 weeks of daily creatine use for muscles to become fully saturated. Though there should still be benefit from periodic use, the studies seem to indicate benefit of a daily dose.

I don’t believe creatine to be a polarizing supplement but if you’ve had positive or negative experiences please share. Additionally, if you would like to see more posts in R/Biohacking about a specific topic or supplement leave a comment and I’ll do a deep dive.

1hwklfb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hwklfb,My very first project,"Hi everyone! I've been lurking here for the past couple of weeks and I decided to share my first ever project: a pair of socks!

In 2023 my partner and I had a tenant and I mentioned that I was curious about knitting and she said she knew a bit and could teach me. She grabbed a practice yarn and 5mm needles and taught me how to cast, how to make a knit stitch and a purl stitch. I was interested for a couple of weeks and then went on doing other things. 

This year I moved countries, so I found myself looking for friends, and discovered a group of ladies in my new town that have a coffee and do crafts. I went for a coffee and felt bad about not having a project so I decided to buy some supplies to have something for the next meetup.

Well, I've never knitted anything in my life and although I know a bit of cross stitching and crocheting, I never did a full project of anything because I wanted something useful and I knew if it was too much of a big project I would give up on it or not be able to finish. So socks seemed to tick all boxes, it was useful, didn't seem too much of a big/long project and would give me something to do.

The first pattern I chose I realised quickly that was way beyond any of my abilities, I could even understand what I was looking at, so I went to YouTube, looked for a step-by-step and found a lady who put out 5 videos of how to knit vanilla socks. So I started my first ever knitting project. And that's the finished pair. From the first foot to the second I've learnt a lot, so one is longer than the other and I made mistakes when decreasing the heel turn. But I'm proud that I finished and it came out much better than I expected.",5,1736344010.0,knitting,3,1.0,False

Some things have been said to each other that weren't the nicest but due to time and some outside encouragement parents and I have been able to settle our troubles and re unite. My girlfriends sister has now made 5 different digs at my parents including calling my mom ""Crazy"" while laughing during conversation. She's openly made fun of the event that kicked off my parents and I not talking in front of the rest of her family to where my girlfriend has even had to say ""dick move"" to her, but that's all that's said.

My girlfriend, her sister and I love coffee and her sister babysits every day while my girlfriend and I work from home. Almost always she brings my girlfriend a coffee but never me. I know that because I'm here it doesn't mean that she should feel obligated to add a coffee to her order ever time but there's almost no attempt. Unless my girlfriend or I place the order for coffee for her, which we pay for hers 100% of the time, she just walks in with her coffee and my girlfriends ignoring I'm here.

To be honest, I'm scared to say something. I'm not, NOT confrontational but I'm scared to cause an issue in the family, to upset anyone so I just sit there and take it (specifically the shitty stuff from here sister) I get frustrated at my girlfriend because she's seen and agreed all of this is bullshit but yet she won't say or do anything about it at all. I don't want her to fight my battels but at the same time, her sister has regularly shit on my family in front of me, in front of her other people and said hurtful things about my parents who she's never met and my girlfriend just sits there.

It's getting to the point where I'm going to say something because enough is enough. I come from a family where I've watched family members stick up for their spouses if something crossing the line was said so I feel like it might be a learned behavior that I get a little support from my girlfriend other than when her sister leaves, her going ""I can't believe she said that, that was totally targeted towards you""

My brain operated on the assumption that because she's my girlfriend sitting there watching her boyfriends family shit on and her boyfriend disrespected, she would want to stick up for me or have some kind of urge to say something to her sister but it's not happening at all, so I now feel like I need to say something and it feels uncomfortable because I don't want to start confrontation with the family.

Accessories can really make the transition from daywear to evening attire. Bold statement pieces like chunky necklaces or large earrings are great to draw attention without overwhelming the outfit. A stylish clutch or crossbody bag is also a great way to be both stylish and practical.  
When nights turn chilly, layers are essential: a fitted blazer over an oversized t-shirt adds structure and sophistication while keeping you warm. Brands like Adidas offer stylish options that blend athletic wear with chic designs, ideal for those wanting to maintain comfort without sacrificing style.  
Lastly, don't forget about makeup! A bolder lip color or defined eyes can complement your overall aesthetic beautifully. With these tips in mind, wearing an oversized t-shirt as a dress for a night out becomes not only possible but incredibly stylish.

Layering Techniques: Oversized T-Shirts in Different Seasons  
Layering is an important technique in styling oversized t-shirts throughout the year. This will allow you to adjust this versatile piece for any season, maintaining comfort and style. In summer, opt for lightweight fabrics like cotton that breathe well; pairing them with shorts creates an effortlessly cool look ideal for warm weather.  
When it gets cooler in winter, layering becomes really important. Put on long-sleeve tops under an oversized tee or top it off with cozy cardigans and jackets. It helps to keep you warm while adding interesting contrasts of texture and colour to your outfit.During the transition from spring and fall, one can layer an oversized t-shirt under light jackets or over fitted long-sleeve shirts to create warmth without bulk. Paired with fitted bottoms like skinny jeans, it helps balance out the loose fit of the tee.  
Scarves are a good addition to any outfit when accessorizing for a change of season, but sunglasses are great when accessorizing during summer. Then, footwear would also have a seasonal change - ankle boots during fall and sandals during summer.  
Mastering layering techniques will make oversized tees stylish, comfortable, and suitable for every season.

How to Accessorize Your Oversized T-Shirt Dress  
Accessorizing is the key to styling an oversized t-shirt dress effectively. The right accessories can transform this simple piece into a statement outfit suitable for various occasions. Start by considering belts; cinching at the waist not only defines your silhouette but also adds structure to an otherwise loose-fitting garment.  
Jewelry should be minimalistic to not overpower the outfit; use delicate necklaces or stud earrings that add but do not draw attention away from the overall look. Bags are also occasion-based; crossbody bags are suitable for casual activities, while clutches are suitable for evening outings.  
Footwear also plays a big role; the oversized t-shirt dress is great to be paired with sneakers for a very relaxed look, perfect for daytime activities, while changing into heels will automatically elevate the look for night events.  
Don't forget about hats! A wide-brimmed hat can add sophistication to your outfit while also providing sun protection during summer months. And of course, layering with jackets or cardigans depending on the weather conditions will add depth and interest without sacrificing comfort.  
Mastering accessory combinations allows you to personalize your oversized t-shirt dress according to individual style preferences while ensuring versatility across different settings.

1hwk9rz,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1hwk9rz/help/,Help,"Hello,

Im a 22 Year Old Male, 1,90m, beginning Weight 128kg and have been carnivore for roughly 2 months now so far I’m down to 115-16kg. 
I used to be very big into gym and lifting weights and thus have developed quite a muscular base frame although my body fat was always slightly high ( low to mid 20%).
To give a Little context, Im a Student and do Not have the biggest Budget for meat. Ive been eating more or less low quality meat ( Steaks from Lidl, Fish , Liver ). I eat a lot of eggs (3-8 per day).

Since I moved to a new town about a year ago I haven’t been to a gym since I can’t seem to find time and motivation with work and Uni. Also one of the reasons why I started carnivore to help slim down and not get too fat while only studying, eating and working. 

In the beginning I experienced the usual lows that come with ketosis transition ( I had done keto before). And then felt good. Weight kept dropping and I don’t seem to lose any significant amount of the muscle I have. 

For about 2-3 weeks I have been getting worse. My weight magically stopped dropping at around 115 and even goes up sometimes even tho I eat very little for my height and weight. 

Additionally I experience extreme fatigue headaches and sleepiness. 
Just now I slept over 13 hours and I feel like I’ve been in a coma when I wake up. My alarm can’t wake me, calls can’t wake me it’s like I’m dead. 

The weird thing is some days it’s really bad and then after 2-3 days I feel great again. Then it goes bad again. 

My family and friends are worried and are telling me to start eating “normal” again. They disagreed with carnivore from the beginning but I knew they weren’t right. But I’m stating to think maybe they were. 

My typical day of eating is as follows:

Morning

Black coffee and fast since I’m not really hungry

Around noon 

-3-4 eggs boiled 

Snack :

-Package of beef sausages ( no sugar or carbs)

Evening 

- coffee black 
-250-300g beef stake or liver or fish or chicken 
- 2-4 eggs boiled 

Late night working snack 

- slice of cheese or feta with around 50-100 grams of beef sausage. 



I know it’s probably slightly too little calories for me but I’m usually not very hungry or crave more food. 

My next step would be to go and get my blood checked see if it helps in anyway.

I (33M) have been in titration process for the last 3 weeks. My first titration appointment is next week, so I wanted to check if someone else taking Elvanse is having the same issue as me.

I have been taking Elvanse 30mg for the last 3 weeks and so far have not experienced any side effect apart from dry mouth, until yesterday. Yesterday evening I had hot flush and itching (red skin but not rash) for half an hour when the medication was wearing off. Today, I had the same but this time right 2 hours after taking the medication. (Note: Based on my experience, the medication starts becoming effective one and a half hour later than I take it, and at the second hour I have the peak level and the effectiveness gradually decreases in the upcoming hours).

The only thing that I have done different in the last two days is that I have taken the medication right after consuming coffee. I know this is something that needs to be avoided due to the BP or pulse increases, but I did this mistake as I have never had any dramatic change in my BP and pulse so far.

As this problem, which is still at a manageable level for me, started happening 3 weeks later than I began getting Elvanse, I believe it's not an allergic reaction of my body to the medication. I will monitor myself until the titration appointment, but wanted to know if it's something experienced by others as well.",1,1736342722.0,ADHDUK,3,1.0,False
1hwk6a7,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1hwk6a7/im_getting_frustrated_with_my_girlfriends_family/,I'm getting frustrated with my girlfriends family ,"It's been a gradual build of frustration but my stress and annoyance around my girlfriends family are at all time highs lately. 

I've had some communication problems with my parents where we went a year without talking. Some things have been said to each other that weren't the nicest but due to time and some outside encouragement parents and I have been able to settle our troubles and re unite. My girlfriends sister has now made 5 different digs at my parents including calling my mom ""Crazy"" while laughing during conversation. She's openly made fun of the event that kicked off my parents and I not talking in front of the rest of her family to where my girlfriend has even had to say ""dick move"" to her.

My girlfriend, her sister and I love coffee and her sister babysits every day while my girlfriend and I work from home. Almost always she brings my girlfriend a coffee but never me. I know that because I'm here it doesn't mean that she should feel obligated to add a coffee to her order ever time but there's almost no attempt. Unless my girlfriend or I place the order for coffee for her, which we pay for hers 100% of the time, she just walks in with her coffee and my girlfriends ignoring I'm here. 

Her dad absolutely hates Trump to the point to where he can't stop talking about him. I'm not saying I like him either but take politics out of it, he's obsessed. Every family dinner he finds a way to insert how Trump did this or did that. We were having a discussion about how a friend of my girlfriend and mine dated someone she called a narcissist and he came over saying how Trumps a narcissist. He finds a way to insert him into every conversation where it's obviously way over the top. 

To be honest, I'm scared to say something. I'm not, NOT confrontational but I'm scared to cause an issue in the family, to upset anyone so I just sit there and take it (specifically the shitty stuff from here sister) I get frustrated at my girlfriend because she's seen and agreed all of this is bullshit but yet she won't say or do anything about it at all. I don't want her to fight my battels but at the same time, her sister has regularly shit on my family in front of me, in front of her other people and said hurtful things about my parents who she's never met and my girlfriend just sits there. 

It's getting to the point where I'm going to say something because enough is enough. Do I even have a slight right to be upset with my girlfriend that she's been here for all of this and just says nothing to ""stick up for me""? I grew up in a household where if anyone ever said something that was upsetting to the opposite persons family, that related family member would stand up or say something to the person. Politely behind the scenes, not start a argument or anything. Its just a learned behavior. 

I don't know what to even think anymore about this situation.

We have a 3 year old and another one due in 2 months. 
I have had mental health issues from my childhood and he knew that and We even survived through very bad PPD. 

In the past 5 years i was treated badly and yelled at alot, basically when we started living together. Came out last year that he cheated 5 years ago and all of it was due to a guilty conscious. 
We got past that eventually. 
Got better but recently since we found out i was pregnant things have gone bad. 

He took a new job which is very stressful but has been neglecting his family Severely. Doesn't do his daily morning chores like take out the kitty litter box(which i cannot due) or take out trash. 10 min of his time. He doesn't greet me in the mornings. Just gets up for a siggerette(which he still smokes inside the house for, after i have begged him not to, because i stopped smoking) and walks past me.

So yeah a lot of him not keeping up and neglecting me and his kid. This is all after i stopped doing nice things for him. I woke him up with coffee and a foor rub, i would run him a bath, dinner, lunch, i stopped it all because i was being neglected anyway and forced to do all the house work and even take care of one of his friends (30m) 

After the friend and after my family for christmas(who also left me to clean and take care of them.) I need a break. I need help. I had people constsntly yelling at me and having to be a pack muel and care for everyone at 6 months pregnant mind you not.

So all i need is a bit of support from my hubby. 

When i talked to him about atepping up a little bit. It all turned into an argument and he got physical and we have not atopped arguing.

Spent new years arguing and it led to me having multiple breakdowns. Again im 6 months pregant almost 7 baby is here in like 10 weeks. All he did was scream at me and fight. I some how managed to stay ok and somewhat take care of my kid. 
Who is not doing ok with all this i know and i am trying.

He agreed to try and i told him about this app we can try since we dont have money for therapy. And that he needs to step up and be consistent with me. Because i need some stability or i might end up in the hospital.

This morning was bad. I broke down after he couldn't keep up with the little things like his shoes and pants on the living room floor the cat box was full and stinky again. I asked him to get up and handle our tot because i really need a break. And not the only time, he said he had a headache and he's tired and just climbed back into bed.

I was making a joke to lighten the mood a bit and he got so mean with me and i lost it. I went ballistic. I apparently even hit our tot that was trying to comfort me but i was in such a rage i didn't even see her.
I think i hit my head against the wall and i have scratch marks on legs. It was so bad and he continued yelling at me i dont know how i calmed down bit i remeber my kid coming in to give me a hug and then after a long fight he agreed he is going to ask for his half day off to come home and take care of me.

He promised. He went in and did some work and got permission and even stopped by a pharmacy to get me something natural to take to calm down and for my head ache.
He brought me chocolates that he hand fed me and we all bonded in the living room and started laughing and it was lovely. He started falling asleep and i asked him if we could spare the money to go for a milkshake he said he is off completely and he would take little one to vacation care. He fell asleep on the couch while we were suposed to be having some time and i was again trying to manage our tot from not jumping on him or waking him. She eventually jumped on him and he woke up in a angry fit and said he is going to go sleep. I swallowd the argument and just left it. Little one got very bad and i am still not recovered from the meltdown. And i go to him to say i need help please. He turns around and goes back to sleep saying he needs sleep he tried. 

I start crying histerically and losing my mind over how little this man i gabe my entire life up for, cared for me. 

Now he is telling me off on how selfish i am and that what he needed to do to come home and ""take care of me""😭
AITAH for telling him how selfish he is and that he doesn't care.

From generic protocols like not permitting outside foods to bizarrely specific ones prohibiting ""flirting with the cashier,"" - the list is quite fascinating in its range.

1hwjz7e,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hwjz7e/china_eastern_airlines_it_was_totally_easy/,China Eastern Airlines - it was totally easy!,"I had previously read peoples experiences of travelling with China Eastern Airlines & we just completed a return journey with them & I would do so again for the savings!

We flew Cebu - layover in Shanghai - London on Dec 27th & just returned yesterday.

Having flown Cebu - London via Dubai, Doha & Singapore before, we actually found this to be the most relaxed experience & we paid only £680 Economy for the return.

Couple of things to note on the flights: 

* We forgot to select our seats so had some trouble checking in before we flew out, we could select PVG - LHR, LHR - PVG & PVG - CEB but as we couldn't select the first leg of the journey. When we checked in at Cebu airport they gave us the extra leg room exit row seats & changed our PVG - LHR seats with exit row seats as well.
* They totally forbid you using power banks on the actual flight itself - there are USB ports but you can only use them at cruising altitude. You must still pack the power bank in your carry on but just cannot use it.
* They don't allow you to wear headphones on take off & landing as well - they are also quite strict on this.
* We found the food to actually be alright - chicken noodles, chicken rice, pork noodles etc. If you are veggie, order that in advance. I also packed some extra snacks to be safe but the meals themselves were filling.
* The seat back entertainment is definitely lacking but we were pre warned about this so loaded up our iPads with films & tv so we were well entertained there & back.
* Absolutely no delays or cancellations - everything ran like clockwork.
* Planes were in good condition. I'm 5'4"" & my partner is 6'0 - leg room was a bit more of an issue with the LHR - PVG flight in the middle seats but that happens on other airlines as well.

Couple of things to note on the layover: 

* We were through the transit process on the way to LHR very quickly as our flight got in at around 6am. Took around 15 mins. On the way back we came in at 1pm & it took more like 30 mins but again was all very easy. 
* Shanghai airport (T1) is huge but pretty empty. There's some souvenir shops, a couple of restaurants & starbucks. Personally I love the toilets, they are Japanese toilets & I really appreciated the heated seats due to the cold. I'd say you definitely need a jacket & jumper in the winter to be comfortable in departures.
* Lots of places to fill water - both cold & hot.
* We had 2.5 hrs on the way to LHR so just mooched about, got Starbucks & chilled at the gate. On the way back it was 8 hrs but more was open so we did a few laps, stretched our legs & then went to one of the loungers (T1) and paid £33 for 2hrs access, lots of food, soft drinks, tea & coffee, wine etc. Comfy seating & charging areas. I noticed that some people were there when we arrived & hadn't left when we did after 2 hrs & needed to get our flight so it didn't seem like they were super strict on the 2hrs rule, or they paid more for longer. Again good toilets. No showers. If you are flying China Eastern Business or First then they have lounges for those of you as well.
* Wifi access is limited - could only use iMessage. Tbh, it's nice for a little social media break as well. Could still access some websites directly but can't use Google search.
* We actually liked how calm it was, we know that Singapore, Dubai, Doha have a lot more to do but honestly, it was just nice to lie down, we had a nap & just be.

We would definitely do that route again for the price. We were previously spending over £1,200 return before so it's a hell of a saving!

Can someone who loved you for 2 and half years lose love in 7 days?,"Sorry for the long story, if you wana make it to to the end please grab popcorn , some water and tissues in case my life’s story makes you laugh or cry
if you made it to the end really appreciate your patience and input.

So i met this girl at a cafe 2 and half years ago after my breakup, it was a meet cute story i was still trying to get over my ex back then, it felt good to get some attention but slowly i started liking her we used to have good conversations we used to meet everyday at the same cafe where we and my friends met, realised she likes me too. We took it forward with a kiss on my terrace at one of the house parties. She was in a long distance relationship she broke up after the kiss i felt really bad coz i didn’t know about it. 
Then after her breakup we continued i was scared of getting attached due to my previous breakup so we took a couple of breaks but then one day i saw her with another guy on a date i realised i loved her and couldn’t lose her beca of my past and wanted to give this a chance so i told her loved her she felt the same and we started our relationship. It was an early live in as my parents left to Canada.
As a little background im a doctor completed my mbbs had started my md in Bangalore but stopped it because i had got hit by patients there as there was no sense of security and two i had chosen that branch and that hospital because of my ex so i couldn’t do it anymore.( This becomes relevant soon)
So i transitioned into health care it with a good remote job for a us health care company at that point i was earning more than my senior resident and my teachers from medicine. And started for Usmle because i wanted to practice medicine outside India after that incident.
Relationship was smooth we had a good connection our friends were also there it was a good part. Two of my friends a guy P whom i consider brother and another girl T had no job and were struggling financially and i really wanted to help so all of us friends founded a small start up to help them. It picked up well.
And due course due to this my preparation was taking a hit as now i was handling my job a startup and the house with a pet. My partner told me try canada instead of usa as it would be easier for her too, though initially reluctant i understood a point after also speaking a consultancy about usa.
Meanwhile during my prep she told since there’s aiims exam coming up why don’t you try that for practice i thought it would make her happy i went with zero interest after getting slosh drunk the previous night to the exam and i cleared it with a good result, and was getting a seat in most options which at a point i considered because she told take i but then i realised i prepared for a year for an international degree it would be unwise to not even try so after discussing with her everything as she was my partner (by this time we planned that we wanted to marry each other) came to conclusion lets try Canada if that doesn’t happen ill crack aiims again next year.
Everyone told me to take but i decided against it (i should’ve in hindsight would’ve saved me this pain today).
My parents came back so she moved out and she shifted close to my house so we could be close i told my parents about her they were chill also im a punjabi and shes a brahmin by family and lively by heart. She informed her parents a little down the line and they straight up said no. By this time i had met her sister and cousin she had met my sister and brother in law and everyone were happy except her parents.

So parents went again to Canada we moved in again but this there were problems coz my parents wanted us to get married her side was not onboard so she was feeling a lot pressure, i could understand the amount of stress she was in i was always there for her as moral support and fought with my parents or anyone if they even said her a word, one important piece here she never imagined life with family and i told very beginning of the relationship it’s a deal breaker for me i want my family she was onboard with it(clarified this early because my previous breakup was because of this) but just for her and the importance of her in my life and the adjustment she’s doing for me i suggested a common middle ground of living on first floor or ground floor of the same building she agreed.
We had a lot of fights this year because of her stress (her parents not agreeing my parents agreeing) my anger issues lack of intimacy because of an accidental pregnancy. 
In October we had a big fight where i asked do you want this relationship i needed an answer because my parents were coming, (clearing this out when i asked this i didn’t mean go against your parents it was because of our problems we landed up there.)
She said no, we broke up it broke me i was devastated friendships were kinda divided but i thought its okay coz i gave my all in this relationship to her i literally cooked everyday, was her motivator, was patient and respected her body snd choices one year without sex, despite this if she choose not to then it’s her loss i was talking to another person just to divert my pain and get some attention and thought i moved on so early(apparently she posted on Reddit and people commented youre better off away than being with such an immature guy- they didn’t even half the story!!! Nvm)
She came back i saw her hurt couldn’t take it we decided to retry, this time slow though i was scared of being hurt again reluctant i gave in because i loved her. She went to uk for a trip my parents still unaware that we patched up started looking for matches, my madam still however was still not sure if she wanted to get married her sister who once told me she’s very happy that my madam found a guy like me now says she can do better i went like wtf!!! 
We spoke she defended me, her and her familys main problem were my spine( i had met with an accident saving my friends life developed fractures and got operated no side effects except occasional pain, i guess thats acceptable over being dead) and didn’t start MD( with so much turmoil in personal life a job a startup it got delayed and tbh its my mistake too my fear of exams made me procrastinate and overthink for almost two years now).
I agree with their thinking too every parent wants their daughter to be secure.(But i know im more than this and yeah getting all this too)

She came back we sorted everything out to a point where she told shes ready to go against her parents( i never asked her to do this, always told her it will be inhumane for me to ask you this, well go for it only if you wana do it that way, then im okay her brother on call yes she wants to do it and she said yes too) 
Im overjoyed with happiness super over the moon she made me meet her uncle told him the same (he told he would try to convince her parents, if they don’t agree you guys can go forward he asked when we said march that was an arbitrary date) 
So the march date (hypothetical artbitary just a god damn suggestion!!) came by mom when we told about our patch up she was happy too.Because we thought canada PR will come by april.


Climax scene- 
So we’re planning our marriage happily one day she asks so are we living on the first floor or second floor? I said im not sure still thinking- Big mistake absolutely agree!!!(Now before reaching conclusions i said this because we were planning to get married in march hopefully get canada pr by april may( already in process) so why to remove a set tenant- should’ve used better ways to communicate). Madam got furious and pissed off absolutely has every right to be when shes doing so much, i cant be a fool that i can’t do this much!! 
So same day go to my parents and tell them as downstairs to vacate, (Surprise surprise- Bomb) my parents think im breaking family im like wtf!! 
She has no problem living with family why are you breaking the house, i didn’t want any blame on her said need my space. They say this is our source of income- go stay at her place or wait till pr to get married, dad gets emotional cry’s and says stay together.
This was the low point for me very difficult to handle got baffled!! Was not able to think straight no sleep that night coz duh family upset, the love of my life upset im torn suddenly.
Next day when she asked i said no option need to stay together if not lets break it( the amount of pain i had to say this sentence i gulped down a 30 whiskey neat my friends are like wtf im like wtf sunny think biggest mistake of my life was saying this- tbh feel like killing myself for this) 
Friends me and her everyone feel terrible broken down friends telling rethink me still trying to get to senses, decided to go on a impromptu trip where the next day realised what i had done after getting some sleep and realising everything that shes done for me, i tell her don’t worry it’ll be done ill do whatever it takes coz youre my priority!! (She doesn’t recall this conversation!! I remember this clearly was a conversation between just us two, friends weren’t there)
Going to sleep in her arms happily thinking everything’s normal making out next day we come back home and boom and shes like im done, im like wtf she said im leaving everything and you cant do this much! Im like wtf i told already itll be done she doesn’t remember at all!!!! This triggers her brings all her previous problems back(maybe her psych did a really bad job on that session that day), she tells my career is unstable( but i am working hard :’( just don’t have proof i study 6-10 hours per day work plus give time to family and friends life’s difficult man) im financially unstable (i earn 22 lpa may be thats not much?have a startup with 40% stake which made 20lakh so far in two years maybe not much?) and my spine( i didn’t have a choice i met with an accident when i was saving someone’s life hes dead i regret it everyday- but i live a normal life with an occasional pain she research on reddit about it and found many complications- arey madam ask me ill give text book i love medicine)- despite all this i gave her solutions to everything guaranteed her the md will start this year we will live separately friends told her, my parents told her, they dont have a problem.
After this i lost it, (not my proudest moment thanks to a lot of overthinking and anxiety, my psych didn’t do a great job too ) i kept asking her everyday tell yes or no, not giving her space to think, i told her i would be dead without her she told i don’t care thats your problem for a smart guy i behaved really dumb very dumb (took that quite literally and took away- making her feel i cant even handle emotional mess? Whats wrong with me!!- when she said wanted to die long before for mixed reasons i was on call with her till 6am consoling her talking calmly on call coz she didn’t allow to her place)
She was on call with me asking where am i when i heard my other friend scream dont do that i got scared shell do something stupid(ironical) i cancelled my plans of dying and drove as fast as I could to her, my parents got involved friends and her big conversation involved me begging her giving me one chance to sort everything right, but she gave up on me. 
My friend that brother he chose her!! Well she doesn’t like meeting me now or talking to me coz i talk about the relationship and im showing weakness (im an emotional person shes a practical person, i cant hide my emotions) well i tried being a friend too, but cant be sad huh?? Why do we have to pretend to be alright when you’re not why can’t people be normal and real does thar make you look weak? No showing your emotions is not weakness atleast were not pretending like half the world!!! 

I lost her coz of misunderstanding and miscommunication, there hasn’t been one day where i wish i could’ve choose my words better could’ve overcome my fear written that exam, could’ve given her that space.
She’s not wrong in expecting those things, but am i wrong in asking one chance to forgive me and see me make it alright? 
I wish I could tag her on this post so she sees how much i regret that(i guess i told her million times in 10 days probably thats why she doesn’t wana talk to me) 
There hasn’t been a single day where i dont miss my friends ( they’re there but not like the same way can’t hangout all together and my brother/ friend he cares for her more than me cant complain shes a gem of a person!!) ,not a day  where i don’t miss her or regret my mistakes. If you wana know her version of the story- 

https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/s/nWK5e7u9G7

hope she doesn’t get pissed or i hope it doesn’t spoil my chances more( i don’t know if there are any chances anymore :/, also not a stalker just know her id coz i read on a common thread what she posted about me) 

There might be a few who think let it go i should move on, but is it that easy ? that life, Those dreams that you built the habits the coffees, those conversations, those cooking days (I literally cooked everyday for her one year happily coz thats how much i love my madam, she cooks really good too actually she cooked the first year) back to topic- is it to let it go find someone else? Someone better? (That’s what she’s been telling me) my question is- what happened to repair why replace, in searching something better what if we lose the best? 

Also if i sent her this post? (Please be wise in commenting and comment good things about me xD- would she kill me first? Or our hopes of getting back) 

Do y’all think i deserve a chance? Or am i gone for good? I love her with everything ive got i wana be a better person for her but not with her away from me. She doesn’t wana come back at all even that 1% hope i had went away when you did that dying thing.

Please say something funny or helpful, very emotionally vulnerable (remember i ran away to die) be critical but not hateful.",1,1736341273.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

### Optimize Your Listing Title and Description

Your listing title is the first thing potential guests see. Make it eye-catching and informative. Include key details, such as the number of bedrooms, unique features, or the prime location. For example, ""Charming Studio in Downtown"" is much more appealing than ""Studio Apartment.""

Ever wonder what a stylist’s day looks like? It’s a mix of creative magic, spontaneous problem-solving, and a little bit of fabulous chaos. One moment I’m deep in a wardrobe consultation, and the next, I’m juggling shopping bags while scouting for the perfect statement piece. It’s busy, unpredictable, and completely *me*.

A typical day could involve helping a client discover their confidence through clothing—whether that’s creating a capsule wardrobe, styling them for a major event, or planning an outfit that screams “main character energy.” There’s nothing quite like watching someone light up when they see themselves in something that feels *just right*.

Then there’s the behind-the-scenes work: brainstorming ideas for styling parties or pop-up events, guiding start-ups through brand consultations, or creating content to inspire others to SHOW UP HAU. (And yes, sometimes this happens with coffee in one hand and a granola bar in the other. Multitasking is my superpower!)

When inspiration strikes, I might find myself wandering East London, where my urban upbringing and creative spirit collide. Whether it’s vintage finds, street art, or the buzz of Shoreditch, the city is my endless style muse.

It’s not always glamorous—there’s laundry to fold, emails to send, and an occasional sprint to catch a cab—but it’s always fulfilling. Helping people embrace their Human, Authentic, Unorthodox selves is what I live for. Fashion, for me, isn’t just about clothes—it’s about confidence, creativity, and connection.

**Story So Far:**

* *Ingrid lectures Burgers and Freedom to stuffy aristocrats, a Giant Spider raises the American flag while dog-sized mice squeak out the ""Star Spangled Banner.""* 

\_\_\_

""*Welp.*"" Zefir said ""*Since you guys are already there, get me a truckload of Marlboro Black and a crate full of Coke.*""

""Ten-four, Baseplate."" Ingrid said, sighing deeply.

Siria looked around, they were not in the moorlands as described by Khorak. The Whales emerged in front of a house, which stood in a row of identical structures. Tall, wooden fences covered the remaining three sides, while trees provided privacy from neighbors upstairs. They stood on slightly overgrown grass, ahead, a wooden patio led up to the house.

Ingrid put a finger to her lips, motioning for everyone to be quiet.

""We're on Earth."" she said quietly. “And in someone's backyard.”

 

The mice quickly scurried into position. One group quickly stacked up at the edge of the patio, taking aim at the doors and window at the back of the house, another quickly scurried up the trees to provide overwatch over the neighborhood, while others quickly located the back gate and stood guard.

In response, Viel quickly cast a cantrip over the windows. It caused anyone, or anything looking through them to perceive the view outside like a hazy painting, obscuring any onlooker from seeing outside properly.

 

""We're in your world!?"" Kvaris hissed quietly. Ingrid nodded in confirmation.

""And we're trespassing."" Philia added, though her tone indicated she could care less.

""It's too quiet."" Cecil said, flying over to a round table by the patio, the type that had in the middle an umbrella hole, but there was no umbrella to be found. There was a newspaper on it and he picked it up.

""The Lakeview Tribune, August 6, 1991..."" the slime read aloud. ""Ingrid, this paper looks recent.""

Neith launched Aquila high in the air.

""And we're in Illinois."" Ingrid said, scanning the front page.

The rest of the Whales looked around, it was a pleasant quiet afternoon.

""There's a gate leading to the back."" Kinu observed, ""We should just leave.""

""Don't!"" Philia urged quietly. ""We're in less trouble here.""

""But why?"" Kinu tilted her head ""You said we're trespassing.""

 

The mice watching the back of the house quickly scurried ahead. Quiet squeaks from the mice at trees had confirmed there appeared to be no one watching from the windows. Ian tried the door and found it locked.

Johnny, finding a bird feeder, quickly snatched it up with a vine and ate bird feed.

""It's too quiet."" Philia said, looking around. ""Something's very wrong. It's best we stay here where nothing can see us.""

""Wrong Lakeview, wrong Illinois..."" Neith spoke up, after running her analysis. ""Wrong Earth.""

Siria turned around to face the spider-bot. ""What do you mean?""

""We're in the past."" Neith explained ""Ingrid and Philia's parents weren't even born yet in the year of nineteen-ninety one. Second, according to my GPS coordinates, this location matches the Lakeview Illinois in our Earth except... unlike ours, this town is abandoned. My drone finds zero activity in this suburb.""

""I haven't heard any birds."" Cecil added, looking up from the newspaper. ""Nor have I heard a single squirrel run around.""

""Or racoons."" Ingrid said, smiling as she saw one of golden the mice poke a garden gnome with his glaive, ""An abandoned house like this would have lots of them. The usual animals that live in a suburb are gone.""

 

With a quiet click, Ian's lockpicks undid the door's simple lock. Ingrid wagged her finger, signing she will open the door.

“It could be booby-trapped. Let me.” Ingrid said quietly. She waited for them to scurry back to the edge of the patio before she, Viel, and Kvaris approached the door.

Ingrid waited for Kvaris's sense of smell and Viel's hearing to confirm there were no occupants inside.

""I hear a faint humming sound, and some ticking noises, but nothing else,""Viel said.

""I don't smell anything human, or any creature."" Kvaris whispered.

""Still no movement in the streets."" Neith said over their earpieces.

""Keep us apprised, Glados."" Ingrid replied. She motioned for the Garm and Ciltran to retreat to the back.

The door opened without a sound, Ingrid boldly strode forward then flipped the light switch, bathing the kitchen in off-white fluorescent lights.

“Clear.” she waved at everyone “Everyone inside, we’re harder to notice in here.”

The patio and back gate mice quickly flooded inside along with Ingrid, and the Valkyrie team. The kitchen was still in good condition. Like Autumnhollow, it had an island counter, but that's where the semblance ended. The room reeked of 1970's interior design sensibilities with tiles everywhere, and even retro appliances that would be selling in the four digits if she put them on auction online. There was even a breakfast nook with some magazines lying atop it.  


It appeared that half of the kitchen had been cleared out, there were still some canned goods, bags of dried beans, jars of coffee and sugar. In the fridge, the freezer was empty of perishables, leaving only the predictable box of baking soda and cans of beer inside the refrigerator itself.

Ingrid closed the door. There was a calendar mounted on it through magnets. The last crossed out date was August 12, 1991, four days after the newspaper Cecil was reading. That in itself only told the last time the family that once lived here occupied the house. It did not answer what the actual date today was.

 

""A lot could have happened between this era and the time that Ingrid grew up in..."" Iohann suggested as they entered, but Philia held up a hand to politely interject.

""No..."" Philia said, looking into her smartphone, observing the aerial view that the Aquila Drone was giving her. ""We're only a few miles from Chicago... the richest, biggest, and most populated city in this region. Nobody who lives here could have any valid reason to leave, it's too profitable. It's as unnatural as say... if any of those hamlets near Teth-Odin was suddenly abandoned. It makes no sense.""

""Aaand..."" Cecil added, looking up at the caddy-mounted monitors at his room-side portal. ""This Downtown is trashed... definitely did not happen in our history.""

""Maybe this city got attacked in the past?"" Kvaris suggested, opening up the cabinets. These too were half empty, unlike the canned goods that Roofe and Minke were selling, these did not depict hearty soups or stews but fruits and vegetables, her interpretation spell suggested that these may have been prepared ingredients for larger dishes, which could be the reason why the family that lived here did not believe them important enough to take with them.

“Ermm…” Cuddly held up a box of cereals and chewed a hole open. The adorable hare took out the bag inside and began to tip the contents into his mouth.

 

Cecil, Philia, Ingrid, and Zefir shared a chuckle at Iohann's suggestion.  


""Impossible"" Philia replied, chuckling as she knelt down at the island counter and began placing atop it various cans, ""at 1991, America had and still is the most powerful military in the world. Ten years from now, two large towers were collapsed. In retaliation, America destroyed that country. So attacking us is extremely foolish. Our biggest rival in this era was tottering in near-collapse, we had no equal.""

""Even if our Chicago was attacked in 1991,"" Cecil said, turning the page ""We would have known about it. An attack like that would take hundreds of years before it ever became forgotten.""

""Or fifty years ago from this era."" Ingrid added, hauling hefty sacks of rice and potatoes from a pantry. ""One of our ports in an tiny island far, far away was burnt to the ground, America destroyed two entire cities as revenge.""

""Perhaps it was some sort of disaster"" Iohann suggested. She saw Kinu let out an excited squeal as she opened a cabinet and found several spices.

Meanwhile the mice had discovered cans of Chef Boyardee Ravioli. Philia, noticing their discovery nodded to them, letting them know it was safe to eat. The mice opened the cans with their knives and started squeaking in delight as they helped themselves.

""It has to be a disaster."" Philia assented, pulling out several kitchen appliances from the power sockets, laying them next to the microwave and electric oven that Ingrid also laid atop the island counter. ""Or some kind of cone hat experiment gone wrong... the American people wouldn't let this destruction stand, there should be thousands of people in there right now rebuilding the city and undoing all the damage. Something really dangerous has driven them away...""

 

Sammy picked up the phone’s receiver, her sharp ears heard a buzzing sound.

“This one’s making a sound.” The orc remarked.

“That’s a telephone. It works like our earpieces.” Ingrid told her. “You’ll need to dial, or press those numbers in a sequence to reach who you want to talk to… it’s all in that yellow book that Viel’s reading.”

Viel looked at the book in awe, in her eyes it felt like an impressive tome of summoning with the sheer number of telephone numbers written on just one page alone.

“Most of those numbers are no good right now, Viel.” Philia said. “If all of the Greater Chicago area is evacuated, there will be no one to answer any of those numbers. Still, feel free to take it, even for us, it's a piece of history. They’re no longer in use in our era anymore…”

Sammy put the handset down. “We’re not speaking to anyone, are we?”

“No,” Ingrid shook her head. “They must not know we’re here. They won’t be our friends.”

“Treat everyone here as hostile.” Philia said. “All they will do if they find us is throw us in a laboratory like it’s Elion-Nosco.”

“You fine with killing your own people?” Siria asked, her elf-ears wagging incredulously.

“They’re not our people.” Philia said “Terragalia is my people. This Earth’s cone hat experiment now threatens our world. They should be lucky with what lives we take.”

""Oh and in case you're wondering, Ingrid."" Neith quipped, entering the kitchen at last. The door was wide enough to admit the refrigerator, thus giving her enough clearance to enter with her porter rig ""Radiation levels are non-existent, we're not in a nuclear holocaust.""

""Are we in a zombie apocalypse scenario?"" Ingrid asked, unplugging the refrigerator as Kvaris and Kinu emptied it.

""Ingrid's asking if this world has succumbed to a plague that turned everyone into a flesh-eating undead."" Zefir clarified for the sake of their less-experienced-in-fiction companions.

""Inconclusive, I detect no mass movement anywhere.""

""H-how are you so casual in assuming such a horrific scenario?"" Kvaris asked, looking up in half-horror and amazement.

""As I said..."" Philia shrugged. ""We're in the most powerful country in the world... if it's this deathly quiet... the worst has already happened.""

 

Siria was poking at some cabinets and discovered bottles of wine, she held them out to the Enthana sisters and Sammy, who examined them excitedly, their eyes lighting up at the unfamiliar labels. These too, joined the pile atop the island counter. Cuddly was still busily chowing down on the cereals, his Fae Harriers now brought to him a still-unopened box of chocolate flakes.

Meanwhile, Selphie was giggling as she read an Archie comic book she found at the breakfast nook. While most of the jokes escaped her, some elements transcended borders. A thought in the back of mind began to grow; it now dawned to her why Ingrid was so learned despite not being some aristocrat’s daughter. Earth’s children apparently were all required to attend an academy. What struck her as most humorous was how the narrative of this “picture-book” omitted all mention of academic scenes, focusing solely on the characters’ lives in-between classes, and somehow despite being in such an academic demesne all acted like world-class buffoons with their antics.

Sammy on the other hand was reading a National Geographic magazine she had picked from random. Flicking through the pages, she stopped to begin reading when she saw the pictures of long-dead humans wrapped in elaborate gold and fine cloth. The words gave way to her Interpretation spell and revealed it to be findings of a long-lost tomb in some far-away land, of a civilization that once flourished there, though the reasons for their flight baffled these explorers. Even more baffling to Sammy was that these explorers in turn had no intention of selling the loot for wealth. Instead they would be transferred to a ""museum"", apparently some hall open to the public for scholarly purposes.

The orc snickered, she could only imagine the Sages back in Terragalia frothing at the mouth at the idea of providing the general public such scholarly information. Knowledge that probably would not affect their lives at the slightest and probably cost so much to keep such an exhibit everyday.

""Huh"" Cecil said, turning his newspaper ""...looks like Bush didn't become president.""

""And no mention of Kuwait either..."" Ingrid frowned, reading the paper. ""This world's history is quite different from ours.""  


""So it's like we're in a mirror image of your Earth."" Viel said, leafing through a cookbook. Meanwhile, Ingrid busied herself taking a stack of china and glassware such as pyrex dishes and adding them to the pile.

Siria looked like she had a lightbulb go off in her head ""...so that's what it was!"" she exclaimed.

""What?"" Kvaris asked, Kinu, Sammy, and herself had settled on the breakfast nook and were helping themselves to the cans of beer fished out from the fridge. Kvaris snickered as she read over Selphie’s shoulder, seeing a funny exchange occur in the Archie comic book the dryad was reading.

Kinu too was also engrossed in Sammy’s magazine. It seemed unthinkable to her that the elaborate necklace as depicted in the page was not going to be sold. Like Sammy, she too was intrigued by this lost kingdom’s origins. The text ran through some probable theories yet the author respectfully maintained that they were just that; mere conjecture. The younger Garm smiled derisively at the thought of her own scholars, who couldn’t help but pass off their own as fact.

""Oh! Umm... Well, this wouldn't be the first time I've been in a Riftworld like this..."" The elf began, ""At one time, I entered a Rogue Rift and it looked eerily like the Arlon Highlands. It had the Star Trees but they looked much smaller-"" she paused for a moment as Ingrid was handing everyone cans of beer.

""*Those are like, really tall world trees*."" Zefir said, explaining it to Ingrid and Cecil. The latter continued to read his newspaper while he expanded his portal, allowing Ingrid and Philia to stuff into his dimension all the goods they had laid atop the island counter.

""They were only a quarter-height to what we have now-"" Siria continued, opening up her beer and taking a generous draught. It was pleasantly cold and strong, just like how she liked her ale.

""Everest high."" Philia added for Ingrid and Cecil's benefit.

""...and it didn't have the Skyeater Titan's bones either."" Siria added.

""Okay, now that's just impossible in our Terragalia's timeline."" Philia said, stroking her chin thoughtfully. ""Because that Titan predates the growth of the Star Hrove. I would know, I carbon dated them.""

""A what?"" the elf's ears drooped inquiringly.

Ingrid meanwhile, frowned and shook her head as she saw the mice hold out a can of dog food.

“No! You are not animals!” Ingrid said. Arthur shrugged and opened the can anyway , then dumped the contents into Johnny’s eager maw.

""Carbon-dating. It’s a way to get a precise age of an object"" the ex-princess said, laying down a stack of pyrex tubs into Cecil's dimension. ""The Terragalia you went to is just like this world, a mirror of the one we know, shaped by a different history.""

""So what do we do now?"" Peanut squeaked, looking up from a Betty Crocker’s cookbook, ""shouldn't we be looking for the ether quartz and shattering them?""

""We need information."" Cecil said, turning the page on the newspaper. ""So far, nothing in this paper says anything wrong going on, and this is a local newspaper mind you. So it should be the final word on what goes on in this neck of the woods.""

""I got something on the radio."" Neith spoke up. “Playing on speakers now…”

""*Vector One-Two-Two-Seven, Nine, Eight, Five, Six Four...*"" said a man's voice, droning on with more and more numbers.

""Sounds like the military."" Philia remarked, ""anything else?""

""Standby..."" there was a burst of static followed by another man speaking.

"".*..if you are in the Greater Chicago Area, be advised, in 48 hours we will initiate Hammerdown protocol. You will not be safe within the city limits. I repeat, this is the US Army, if you are receiving this message this transmission you must head to the following major roads: either Lake Shore Drive, or the Northwest Highway. Do not, I repeat do not attempt any other route for they are overrun. Do not travel at night. If you are in the...*""

Neith cut the transmission.

""It's on a loop. They're trying to evacuate as many people as they can."" she said dully. ""After that, the city and everything around it will be ash and rubble.""

""Sounds like we don't have to do anything at all."" Ingrid said. ""They're going to glass this city and that should take out any and all Ether Quartz formations.""

""*I guess we should return.*"" Zefir suggested ""*I mean we could raid the city for supplies but we're not really hurting for those.*""

Philia sighed. “There is one.” she began.

Ingrid smiled, knowing what she was about to say next.

 

""Site Epsilon-four."" Philia said, causing Ingrid and Cecil to chuckle darkly.

I have Type 1 Diabeties and just had my last baby 5 months ago who I adore and love so very very much but the pregnancy was hard my sugars kept dropping low and if I made one small adjustment I'd be high the next day because highs impact the baby more I opt to keep it on the lower side and treat the hypos but I put on a LOT of weight (32kg) 

I lost 20kg in the first 3 months but I have stayed stagnant for the last 2 months a lot of this is from not great choices and I am feeling the brunt of it. 

I do have an obsessive personality so when I would try to start losing the weight again I would eat way to little and try to excerise way to much (like an hour a night) however I work 45 hours a week and I have 4 kids so this has not been sustainable and I just kept going back to bad habits and burning out.

I had a cry to my husband about it and he asked me a simple question ""what's the rush to lose the weight"" and he's right previous times it was because we were preparing for another baby or our wedding but we are done with kids so there's no rush. 

My husband makes me feel beautiful no matter what I look like (been together 7 years and I was 40kg lighter 😅) so it's myself putting pressure on myself.

So 3 days ago I decided to not were my fitbit and watch how many calories I burn or microanalysis the calories i am intaking.

So my plan (which I have stuck to for the last 3 days)

1. Eat the healthy food I love Porridge for Brekky, rice chicken (tuna) & veg for lunch and one of my quick heat up dinners that vary from 280 - 400 calories a night plus salad for a snack or something with protein in it

2. Try to aim for 20mins min a night but I want to do 3 nights a week on the cross trainer and run on Sundays (I love running and would love to be able to run 10km again one day but 2km is my first goal)

3. Drink 2 litres of water a day 

4. NO DAILY WEIGH INS...once a month I will weigh myself and once a month I'll have a free day where I can have an iced coffee and take away 

I am proud of myself my co worker asked if I wanted an iced coffee and I said no when normally I would say yes.

I generally feel good and last night my 5 month old stayed up later and I was laughing and playing with her enjoying the moment but got to late to do a workout but when I would normally not go back the next night.

Tonight I went back on the crosstrainer.

I am aware I have a lot of weight to drop but for the first time in years I feel like I can take my time and I am hoping I can stick with it 

Thank you if you read all of this a lot of stuff in my head that I wanted to get out.",11,1736340899.0,loseit,1,1.0,False

***The Trump administration is considering imposing tariffs on Chinese goods, including rare earths, which could disrupt existing supply chains and raise prices.***

***China's dominance in the rare earth market poses a risk to U.S. supply chains, as China could potentially limit exports in response to U.S. trade measures.***

***The Trump administration aims to reduce reliance on Chinese rare earth imports by encouraging domestic production and partnering with allied nations.***

https://preview.redd.it/wke0292tlrbe1.png?width=718&format=png&auto=webp&s=f79f44ce434949f4bec354a9b609fc86f3b0bcc6

The Rare Earths MMI ([Monthly Metals Index](https://agmetalminer.com/monthly-report-price-index-trends/)) displayed bearish sentiment as it entered 2025, dropping by 3.08%. Weak Chinese demand for metals across the board had at least some impact on the downward direction of the index month-over-month. Considering major changes are underway in the global rare earth industry, this created downward short-term price pressure.

As far as the U.S. is concerned, the incoming Trump administration could impose tariffs that would impact any raw materials imported from China, which could potentially raise U.S. rare earth prices in the long term. China’s export ban on gallium, germanium and antimony also went into full effect in December, adding additional volatility to the rare earths market.

***The Trump Transition***

The inauguration of President Donald Trump in January 2025 signals a transformative period for U.S. trade policies. Rare earths are indispensable in manufacturing high-tech products, including smartphones, electric vehicles and advanced defense systems. The administration’s proposed strategies are poised to influence both the pricing and import dynamics of rare earths in the U.S.

# Rare Earths and Trump: Challenges

Introducing tariffs on Chinese goods is central to President Trump’s trade policies. Reports suggest that the administration is exploring imposing a 60% tax on imports from China and a 10% tax on goods from other countries.

The strategy emphasizes safeguarding sectors tied to economic stability and national defense. According to Reuters, such tariffs could push overall rates to levels unseen since the Great Depression, posing significant risks to supply chains dependent on rare earth elements from [China](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/trump-aides-target-critical-areas-import-duties-washington-post-reports-2025-01-06).

China currently dominates the global rare earth market, accounting for around 70% of total supply. In response to U.S. trade measures, China has signaled the possibility of utilizing its foothold on the industry to limit rare earth exports to the United States. According to MarketWatch, such a move could result in supply disruptions and drive up costs for U.S. sectors reliant on these [essential materials](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/china-is-feeding-a-tech-based-trade-war-ahead-of-2025-with-its-monopoly-on-rare-metals-f0243a1c).

# Opportunities

The Trump administration has also indicated plans to lessen reliance on Chinese rare earth imports by strengthening domestic production capabilities. According to Newsweek, this strategy involves backing U.S.-based mining and processing initiatives, which could improve supply chain resilience while generating [employment opportunities](https://www.newsweek.com/we-can-no-longer-afford-let-china-do-our-rare-earth-mining-opinion-1998171) nationwide.

Meanwhile, partnerships with allied nations that have access to rare earth resources, like Australia, are likely to persist. For example, Australian firm Lynas Rare Earths has already partnered with the U.S. Department of Defense to develop a processing plant in Texas with the goal being to reduce dependency on [Chinese supply chains](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/).

# Market Implications

The combination of higher tariffs and initiatives to expand domestic production presents a complicated outlook for rare earth pricing in the U.S. The tariffs could initially raise costs by disrupting existing supply chains.

However, if domestic production efforts prove successful, they may eventually stabilize or even lower prices by reducing dependence on imports. That said, the adjustment period will likely see significant market volatility as these new policies and production capabilities take shape.

**Date:** Wednesday, December 11, 2024 at 8:11 AM  
**To:** Jim Sims <[Jim.Sims@niocorp.com](mailto:Jim.Sims@niocorp.com)\>  
**Subject:** Five Questions as we head into 2025!

Good Afternoon, Jim!

   As we wait with many....  I've gotta ask a few more questions leading up to a years end 2024 **REDDIT REVIEW** & the AGM! Rumor has it team Niocorp is in talks with the new administration as 2025 approaches. 

Jim - As 2024 nears an end- Trade Tariffs, China, Critical Minerals & a new administration are on deck. The table is set for Critical Minerals to take center stage.

1. *\*\*\*Are several entities such as (DoD, U.S. & Allied Governments & Private Industries) “STILL” Interested securing Off-take Agreements for Niocorp's remaining Critical Minerals (Titanium, Niobium 25%, Rare Earths, CaCO3, MgCO3 & some Iron stuff* ***as 2025 approaches?****) - Should Financing be secured??*

 RESPONSE:

***""Several USG agencies are working with us to potentially provide financing to the Elk Creek Project.  And, yes, we are in discussions with the National Defense Stockpile, which (like much of the USG) is much more intensely interested in seeing U.S. production of scandium catalyze a variety of defense and commercial technologies.""***

[SOUNDS LIKE THE DOD & OTHERS ARE INTERESTED????](https://preview.redd.it/nar8a0a6orbe1.png?width=231&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fc057ecc9cfe44465d2a21b472674827ce2c861)

QUESTION #2) Niocorp has completed positive bench scale testing of magnetic rare earths from magnetic scrap. Is Niocorp now pursuing ""Pilot Plant studies at the site in Canada"" on the recycling of aforementioned materials? Could you offer comment on how that might continue.

 RESPONSE:

***""We have concluded all testing necessary at this time at our demonstration plant in Quebec to show the potential of our proposed system’s ability to recycle NdFeB magnets.""***

[ANYONE UP IN CANADA TRY VISITING??](https://preview.redd.it/gqwzl4haorbe1.png?width=403&format=png&auto=webp&s=432b7a3c571088254bfd86d52eadf98aeeb876e1)

Also, the material news release above mentions the ""Fact"" Niocorp could utilize the new proprietary Separation methods now being undertaken for the separation of **(\*\*Other Feedstock Sources).**

 RESPONSE:

***""Yes.""***

QUESTION #3) Could Coal waste, or other mine feedstock sources be utilized. Please offer additional comment if you can do so on what ""Other Feedstock Sources"" might be in play? Or under Consideration from the team at Niocorp...

 RESPONSE:

***""Post-combustion ash from coal fired power plants is highly unlikely to ever become a commercially viable source of REEs.  There are a variety of other potential sources of REE mixed concentrate that we could possibly process.""***

 QUESTION #4) Is the New Trump Administration seeking to continue to build upon its commitment to mining the production & sourcing of domestic critical minerals? Comment if possible...

1hwjk48,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1hwjk48/need_advice_shes_seeing_someone_else_after_a/,Need advice – She’s seeing someone else after a month of dating.,"Hey everyone,

I’m in need of some advice. I’ve been dating this girl (let’s call her X) for about 1-2 months now. We met on Bumble, chatted for a bit, and then met up in person after just two weeks of texting. Since then, we’ve had some really great times—dinners, long drives, coffees, and a lot of laughs. Things even got physical, and it felt like we were really clicking.

Over the past couple of weeks, we’ve been talking more seriously about exclusivity and what it would mean to make things official, so we could focus on each other and take the next step in our relationship. I asked her where we stood.

Yesterday, during another conversation about this, she told me that she might still be seeing someone else or considering going on another date. From what I understand, she could still be using Bumble or chatting with other people. She said she didn’t want to hide anything from me, and as she was saying this, she started tearing up. She told me she knew it would be hard for me to hear and that she didn’t want to break my heart.

This really took me by surprise, especially since we’ve spent so much time together during the holidays—celebrating Christmas and New Year’s, exchanging meaningful gifts, and even spending entire days and nights together. I’ve developed genuine feelings for her, so hearing this was a bit of a gut punch.

I’ve been trying to keep my emotions in check, but I’m honestly unsure about what to do next. I’ve been pretty invested in this relationship, and now I’m questioning whether it’s worth continuing or if I should move on.

So, what should my next step be? Should I just let things play out and see where they go, or do I need to have a more serious conversation about where this is headed? Any advice from people who’ve been in a similar situation would be greatly appreciated.",1,1736340816.0,relationshipadvice,1,1.0,False

Some personal thoughts after moving abroad,"Wanted to share a bit of reflection as somebody who splits their time between two countries and travels from each to all the others, and see if anybody can relate or share other interesting perspective? I always love the reflection that comes at the most unexpected times during and after a trip.  

My answer to my own question: Travel has always been about connection for me—both outwardly and inwardly. Living in Canada and the Middle East shaped this perspective in ways I couldn’t have imagined.

In Canada, the wide-open spaces, diverse cultures, and strong emphasis on individuality taught me to embrace freedom and exploration. It’s a place where you can lose yourself in nature one day and engage in a multicultural festival the next. The connection to the land is deeply rooted in moments of stillness—like hearing only your breath in the Rockies or sharing stories around a campfire.

The Middle East, on the other hand, introduced me to a richness of culture that thrives on community and hospitality. Living in Oman, I see how traditions are honoured and shared with pride. The sense of connection here is deeply personal, from the warmth of a stranger offering coffee to the collective celebrations of religious and cultural events. It’s a place where every corner has history, and every interaction feels intentional.

These contrasting experiences taught me that connection comes in many forms—whether it’s the introspection of a solitary hike in Canada or the shared laughter over dates and kahwa in Oman. They also helped me embrace duality: appreciating luxury and simplicity, solitude and community, adventure and rest.

When I travel now, I look for ways to blend these lessons. I seek the stories that only locals can share, the moments that force me to slow down and reflect, and the places where I can rediscover myself in the unfamiliar. For me, travel isn’t just about seeing the world—it’s about understanding how I fit into it.",10,1736340807.0,travel,9,0.86,False

So all were poly and consenting and all that.  Then 2020 happened and the world blew up. He and his girlfriend split. He blew up. We got our wires crossed on a date I had with my 'other' someone and was really hurt and demanded I break up with him; I stupidly complied.   Time passed and I ended up divorced from my husband/NP.  I have been able to visit there twice.  In 5 years.  We have spent 30 days total together.   
The last trip was only 10 days long.  And his wife pouted so he gave her one of those days.  I had felt for a long time like a secondary, that she could at any minute take it away.  And I knew then, for real, that I would not be a secure as he kept saying I was.  We had big plans for me and my son to move there. I still believe he means those.   
But he gave an ultimatum when someone I dated before the pandemic popped up - if you even have coffee with him, I'll break up with you.  And it went ugly from there.   
I set aside what I wanted for a while, but I finally didn't. I said I was meeting up with Coffee Guy.  And Bob broke up with me, as he said he would.  Even being married.   He insisted his marriage was just for the kids.  I told him I didn't  ask nor demand that, that what happened between them was their business not mine.   
So he broke up with me and I'm grieving.  I refused to not see Coffee Guy.  I reminded him we weren't monogamous when we got together and it was unfair for a married man to demand that of me.   
Coffee Guy is lovely and I want to see more of him.   
But it feels ...weird. To have a renewed energy in my heart and head for someone while at the same time grieving so hard for someone else.   My brother passed in Nov so it's been a rough few months and a lot of tears which doesn't help.

There was this coffee shop in town that doubled as a co-working space. I went there every day and after a while I noticed a woman.


She sat at the same table every day. She ordered the same coffee every day. And she had this dominant energy about her.


After about a month of fantasising, I finally plucked up the courage. I got to the shop before she did. After ordering my coffee, I asked the batista to have her order ready at 08:15. That was the exact time she came in every day, and I told him he could write ""From a secret admirer"" on the cup. 


The thrill of paying for it was enormous. My dick turned rock hard at the sound of the *beep* of the transaction going through.


I then placed an envelope on the table where she always sat. Inside was a gift card and a small note. It read:


""From your secret admirer to the mystery lady. I hope these little gifts make your day a little brighter"".


I sat down in my usual place. My heart was pounding. My cock was still hard as I waited in anticipation of her arrival. 


As the clock struck 08:15 she walked in. As usual she was dressed very stylishly and walked in with that boss bitch vibe she had.


The look of surprise on her face as the barista prepared her paid for order was almost enough to send me over the edge. I tried my best to look busy as she sat down at her table and opened the letter.


She looked around the half-full place. Did her eyes stay on me a little longer than on anyone else? I am sure that was just my imagination.


The rest of the day was fairly uneventful. She did, however, use the gift card to buy a panini for lunch, which made me feel great.


When she left for the day, she gave the barista a note. As soon as she was gone, he came over and handed it to me.


""Thank you, my little purse. Keep it up,"" it said.
As I read it I could feel a wet spot forming in my trousers as my cock exploded in orgasmic bliss. A little embarrassed but excited, I left looking forward to tomorrow.",2,1736340474.0,paypigsupportgroup,2,0.75,False

I thought I knew what to expect and that I was curbing all these feelings by being realistic before it happened. 

I knew that nobody is going to be as excited as me and my fiance for our wedding. I knew the planning and expense was going to fall on us. 

But nothing can prepare you for how much it'll bother you that nobody shows any interest. Nobody has said anything about a wedding shower and I can't add that expense or stress into the planning process. 

I'm planning and mostly paying for the entirety of my bachelorette party and I checked and double checked the dates I was looking for to book a cabin an hour and a half away and everyone said it was fine. I book the dates and the next day my sister tells me she forgot she has a concert one of the nights and can I move the trip..
Beyond that when I sent the information about the cabin being booked nobody else said anything. No ""I'm excited'"" or ""i can't wait"" or ""we're going to have fun"". It's just been crickets. 

I invited one of my best friends to go thrift shopping with me (something she's always enjoyed in general) with the intention of looking for wedding decor. The day came and I'm in her town (30 minutes from me) asking if I could grab her coffee or a breakfast snack and I get no reply. Several minutes later she calls and said she forgot and she's still half asleep. 

My mom told me when I got engaged she would buy my dress as her contribution. I had asked her what she was willing to spend and she never gave me a direct number. I came up with a number I was willing and able to spend so when we went dress shopping I wouldn't be disappointed trying something on I couldn't afford. I found a beautiful dress and when it came down to put 60% down my mom didn't move or reach for her wallet or say anything before or after the appointment about it. Thank God I was prepared to pay, but I just know when it comes to my younger sister's wedding (whenever that happens) my mom will not only pay for her dress but ask questions about her wedding and talk about it with everyone. 

I just feel myself being so sad about this wedding. I'm so excited to marry my favorite person, but it's bringing out so many feelings of not being good enough and cared about by my friends and family. 

I'm looking to get back into therapy because I don't want to feel like this, but right now it just sucks.

So firstly for context, my starting BMI was 29.8 but I have co-existing conditions which has allowed me a prescription. I’ve lost 5kg in just over 5wks so far, I hope to lose another 8+ to get me to a healthy weight. 

I’ve noticed that side effects are worst 36-48hrs after my injection. I normally inject on a Sunday night and Tuesday are when all the side effects kick in. Normally that’s nausea and tiredness and this week I had the dreaded sulfur burps yesterday - the worst side effect so far. If anything it reminds me of morning sickness - I just feel queasy and lacking in energy and want to eat something like a croissant to make it stop. Exactly like when I was pregnant! 

If anything I find that MJ turns hunger feelings in to nausea. The best way to tackle that is it eat but given I feel so rotten I find that hard on that second day. After that I tend to be ok, but I do feel the foods that make me feel better when I feel like this aren’t the healthy ones - it’s pastry or a cheeseburger or something along those lines that settles my stomach.   

On the plus side, I’m eating far smaller portions, often not finishing a meal if I don’t dish out accordingly and I’m able to avoid foods in a way I couldn’t before. I was at a NYE do and there was a buffet and normally I would be stuck to it picking all night, but I had a few hits and pieces and was satisfied with that.

While food noise is gone it feels a little like it’s been replaced with Mounjaro noise. So instead of thinking about food im thinking about this instead - is it working, how are my symptoms, when’s my next injection etc etc

There’s a few other unexpected things I’ve noticed too: I’ve gone off coffee! It no longer gives me the comfort it used to, I don’t crave it and I hardly drink it any more! 
I’m also drinking a fraction of the alcohol I used to - over Christmas I was struggling to finish the drinks I was given and didn’t have that need to top up my glass as soon as it was done. If I drink too much I feel queasy quite quickly too so it’s best avoided. 

This are both good things of course and match reports of how these sorts of drugs could also be used to treat a host of other things. 

I haven’t been food/calorie tracking up until now - I didn’t feel the need initially as my food intake had gone down so much that I knew I was in a deficit. That said I have started tracking now to make sure I’m eating enough and getting enough of the right nutrients and balance of carbs/protein/etc. I also want to see if there are any patterns to what I eat compared to the symptoms I get. For example I’m pretty sure my sulfur burps were triggered by baked beans in a jacket potato, which is a shame cause I love that but not as much as I hated those sulfur burps, so I’ll avoid for now. 

I’m starting to exercise again now having been unable to do so before so I’ll definitely need to make sure I’m fuelling myself properly hence the meal tracking. I use MyFitnessPal

Oh and I inject in my stomach. I tried my thigh one week on 2.5 and felt like it didn’t really “take” - appetite was back, food noise was back and I didn’t lose anything that week. So I reverted to stomach again. I’ve heard arm works well for some people? 

Anyway, no idea why I’m telling you all of this, I just wanted somewhere to put my thoughts down and see if anyone else feels any of the same things.

We took it forward with a kiss on my terrace at one of the house parties. She was in a long distance relationship she broke up after the kiss i felt really bad coz i didn’t know about it. 
Then after her breakup we continued i was scared of getting attached due to my previous breakup so we took a couple of breaks but then one day i saw her with another guy on a date i realised i loved her and couldn’t lose her beca of my past and wanted to give this a chance so i told her loved her she felt the same and we started our relationship. It was an early live in as my parents left to Canada.
As a little background im a doctor completed my mbbs had started my md in Bangalore but stopped it because i had got hit by patients there as there was no sense of security and two i had chosen that branch and that hospital because of my ex so i couldn’t do it anymore.( This becomes relevant soon)
So i transitioned into health care it with a good remote job for a us health care company at that point i was earning more than my senior resident and my teachers from medicine. And started for Usmle because i wanted to practice medicine outside India after that incident.
Relationship was smooth we had a good connection our friends were also there it was a good part. Two of my friends a guy P whom i consider brother and another girl T had no job and were struggling financially and i really wanted to help so all of us friends founded a small start up to help them. It picked up well.
And due course due to this my preparation was taking a hit as now i was handling my job a startup and the house with a pet. My partner told me try canada instead of usa as it would be easier for her too, though initially reluctant i understood a point after also speaking a consultancy about usa.
Meanwhile during my prep she told since there’s aiims exam coming up why don’t you try that for practice i thought it would make her happy i went with zero interest after getting slosh drunk the previous night to the exam and i cleared it with a good result, and was getting a seat in most options which at a point i considered because she told take i but then i realised i prepared for a year for an international degree it would be unwise to not even try so after discussing with her everything as she was my partner (by this time we planned that we wanted to marry each other) came to conclusion lets try Canada if that doesn’t happen ill crack aiims again next year.
Everyone told me to take but i decided against it (i should’ve in hindsight would’ve saved me this pain today).
My parents came back so she moved out and she shifted close to my house so we could be close i told my parents about her they were chill also im a punjabi and shes a brahmin by family and lively by heart. She informed her parents a little down the line and they straight up said no. By this time i had met her sister and cousin she had met my sister and brother in law and everyone were happy except her parents.

So parents went again to Canada we moved in again but this there were problems coz my parents wanted us to get married her side was not onboard so she was feeling a lot pressure, i could understand the amount of stress she was in i was always there for her as moral support and fought with my parents or anyone if they even said her a word, one important piece here she never imagined life with family and i told very beginning of the relationship it’s a deal breaker for me i want my family she was onboard with it(clarified this early because my previous breakup was because of this) but just for her and the importance of her in my life and the adjustment she’s doing for me i suggested a common middle ground of living on first floor or ground floor of the same building she agreed.
We had a lot of fights this year because of her stress (her parents not agreeing my parents agreeing) my anger issues lack of intimacy because of an accidental pregnancy. 
In October we had a big fight where i asked do you want this relationship i needed an answer because my parents were coming, (clearing this out when i asked this i didn’t mean go against your parents it was because of our problems we landed up there.)
She said no, we broke up it broke me i was devastated friendships were kinda divided but i thought its okay coz i gave my all in this relationship to her i literally cooked everyday, was her motivator, was patient and respected her body snd choices one year without sex, despite this if she choose not to then it’s her loss i was talking to another person just to divert my pain and get some attention and thought i moved on so early(apparently she posted on Reddit and people commented youre better off away than being with such an immature guy- they didn’t even half the story!!! Nvm)
She came back i saw her hurt couldn’t take it we decided to retry, this time slow though i was scared of being hurt again reluctant i gave in because i loved her. She went to uk for a trip my parents still unaware that we patched up started looking for matches, my madam still however was still not sure if she wanted to get married her sister who once told me she’s very happy that my madam found a guy like me now says she can do better i went like wtf!!! 
We spoke she defended me, her and her familys main problem were my spine( i had met with an accident saving my friends life developed fractures and got operated no side effects except occasional pain, i guess thats acceptable over being dead) and didn’t start MD( with so much turmoil in personal life a job a startup it got delayed and tbh its my mistake too my fear of exams made me procrastinate and overthink for almost two years now).
I agree with their thinking too every parent wants their daughter to be secure.(But i know im more than this and yeah getting all this too)

She came back we sorted everything out to a point where she told shes ready to go against her parents( i never asked her to do this, always told her it will be inhumane for me to ask you this, well go for it only if you wana do it that way, then im okay her brother on call yes she wants to do it and she said yes too) 
Im overjoyed with happiness super over the moon she made me meet her uncle told him the same (he told he would try to convince her parents, if they don’t agree you guys can go forward he asked when we said march that was an arbitrary date) 
So the march date (hypothetical artbitary just a god damn suggestion!!) came by mom when we told about our patch up she was happy too.Because we thought canada PR will come by april.


Climax scene- 
So we’re planning our marriage happily one day she asks so are we living on the first floor or second floor? I said im not sure still thinking- Big mistake absolutely agree!!!(Now before reaching conclusions i said this because we were planning to get married in march hopefully get canada pr by april may( already in process) so why to remove a set tenant- should’ve used better ways to communicate). Madam got furious and pissed off absolutely has every right to be when shes doing so much, i cant be a fool that i can’t do this much!! 
So same day go to my parents and tell them as downstairs to vacate, (Surprise surprise- Bomb) my parents think im breaking family im like wtf!! 
She has no problem living with family why are you breaking the house, i didn’t want any blame on her said need my space. They say this is our source of income- go stay at her place or wait till pr to get married, dad gets emotional cry’s and says stay together.
This was the low point for me very difficult to handle got baffled!! Was not able to think straight no sleep that night coz duh family upset, the love of my life upset im torn suddenly.
Next day when she asked i said no option need to stay together if not lets break it( the amount of pain i had to say this sentence i gulped down a 30 whiskey neat my friends are like wtf im like wtf sunny think biggest mistake of my life was saying this- tbh feel like killing myself for this) 
Friends me and her everyone feel terrible broken down friends telling rethink me still trying to get to senses, decided to go on a impromptu trip where the next day realised what i had done after getting some sleep and realising everything that shes done for me, i tell her don’t worry it’ll be done ill do whatever it takes coz youre my priority!! (She doesn’t recall this conversation!! I remember this clearly was a conversation between just us two, friends weren’t there)
Going to sleep in her arms happily thinking everything’s normal making out next day we come back home and boom and shes like im done, im like wtf she said im leaving everything and you cant do this much! Im like wtf i told already itll be done she doesn’t remember at all!!!! This triggers her brings all her previous problems back(maybe her psych did a really bad job on that session that day), she tells my career is unstable( but i am working hard :’( just don’t have proof i study 6-10 hours per day work plus give time to family and friends life’s difficult man) im financially unstable (i earn 22 lpa may be thats not much?have a startup with 40% stake which made 20lakh so far in two years maybe not much?) and my spine( i didn’t have a choice i met with an accident when i was saving someone’s life hes dead i regret it everyday- but i live a normal life with an occasional pain she research on reddit about it and found many complications- arey madam ask me ill give text book i love medicine)- despite all this i gave her solutions to everything guaranteed her the md will start this year we will live separately friends told her, my parents told her, they dont have a problem.
After this i lost it, (not my proudest moment thanks to a lot of overthinking and anxiety, my psych didn’t do a great job too ) i kept asking her everyday tell yes or no, not giving her space to think, i told her i would be dead without her she told i don’t care thats your problem for a smart guy i behaved really dumb very dumb (took that quite literally and took away- making her feel i cant even handle emotional mess? Whats wrong with me!!- when she said wanted to die long before for mixed reasons i was on call with her till 6am consoling her talking calmly on call coz she didn’t allow to her place)
She was on call with me asking where am i when i heard my other friend scream dont do that i got scared shell do something stupid(ironical) i cancelled my plans of dying and drove as fast as I could to her, my parents got involved friends and her big conversation involved me begging her giving me one chance to sort everything right, but she gave up on me. 
My friend that brother he chose her!! Well she doesn’t like meeting me now or talking to me coz i talk about the relationship and im showing weakness (im an emotional person shes a practical person, i cant hide my emotions) well i tried being a friend too, but cant be sad huh?? Why do we have to pretend to be alright when you’re not why can’t people be normal and real does thar make you look weak? No showing your emotions is not weakness atleast were not pretending like half the world!!! 

I lost her coz of misunderstanding and miscommunication, there hasn’t been one day where i wish i could’ve choose my words better could’ve overcome my fear written that exam, could’ve given her that space.
She’s not wrong in expecting those things, but am i wrong in asking one chance to forgive me and see me make it alright? 
I wish I could tag her on this post so she sees how much i regret that(i guess i told her million times in 10 days probably thats why she doesn’t wana talk to me) 
There hasn’t been a single day where i dont miss my friends ( they’re there but not like the same way can’t hangout all together and my brother/ friend he cares for her more than me cant complain shes a gem of a person!!) ,not a day  where i don’t miss her or regret my mistakes. If you wana know her version of the story-

 https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/s/nWK5e7u9G7

I hope she doesn’t get pissed or i hope it doesn’t spoil my chances more( i don’t know if there are any chances anymore :/, also not a stalker just know her id coz i read on a common thread what she posted about me) 

There might be a few who think let it go i should move on, but is it that easy ? that life, Those dreams that you built the habits the coffees, those conversations, those cooking days (I literally cooked everyday for her one year happily coz thats how much i love my madam, she cooks really good too actually she cooked the first year) back to topic- is it to let it go find someone else? Someone better? (That’s what she’s been telling me) my question is- what happened to repair why replace, in searching something better what if we lose the best? 

Also if i sent her this post? (Please be wise in commenting and comment good things about me xD- would she kill me first? Or our hopes of getting back) 

Do y’all think i deserve a chance? Or am i gone for good? I love her with everything ive got i wana be a better person for her but not with her away from me. She doesn’t wana come back at all even that 1% hope i had went away when you did that dying thing.

Please say something funny or helpful, very emotionally vulnerable (remember i ran away to die) be critical but not hateful.",0,1736340339.0,BreakUps,1,0.5,False

## The Ultimate Guide to Attachable Cup Holders for Strollers: Top Picks & Reviews

As a parent, you know the juggling act of managing a stroller, a baby, and everything else life throws your way.  One seemingly small detail that can significantly impact your daily outings is having a reliable and convenient place to keep your drinks and the baby's essentials.  That's where a good attachable cup holder for your stroller comes in. This comprehensive guide will help you navigate the world of stroller cup holders, reviewing top contenders and addressing common concerns to help you choose the perfect fit for your lifestyle.

### Why You Need a Stroller Cup Holder: Beyond Just Convenience

The benefits of a stroller cup holder extend far beyond simply having a place to put your coffee.  Think about these scenarios:

* **Increased Comfort:**  Having your drink readily accessible eliminates the need to constantly stop and retrieve it, enhancing the overall comfort and enjoyment of your outings.
* **Organized Storage:** Many cup holders offer additional features like phone holders or small compartments, providing extra storage for keys, snacks, or other essentials, transforming your stroller into a mobile command center.

These organizers often integrate multiple cup holders, storage pockets, and other features.

Bit long but please, i beg ya, and tell me what was my fault ? ","So, around 2023, during the CAT exam, I met this lady. Smiles were exchanged, LinkedIn profiles exchanged, and we moved to Snapchat. We talked for around 16 hours a day for a week. I write poems and stories (I'm working on my own novel). We used to write, talk, and snap all day long. Two weeks later, I texted her: ""The coffee at this cafe is excellent.""  
She replied, ""WDYM? It’s in front of my society!""  
I said, ""Yep, you texted me a snap, and one of my friends lives nearby."" She came to meet me, invited me over to her house. We drank tea, sat opposite each other, just staring and talking the whole night long. The next morning, I left, so it was sorta a date night. I then officially asked her out and took her for dinner. We held hands, and I suppose the situationship began.

Another weekend, another dinner. She wasn’t feeling well, felt queasy, so we left dinner, and I took her home. We were sitting by her bedside. She was leaning on my shoulder, and we were holding hands. Now, she had this peculiar habit of not holding my hand back, as if you hold a dog’s paw, and the dog doesn’t clasp it back. I jokingly said, ""The day you feel something genuine and want to kiss me, just squeeze my hand really tight.""  
Well, lo and behold, she gave me a death grip on my palm. I laughed and said, ""Not just for the conversation effect!"" She just stared into my eyes, and her grip tightened. She used to use a caramel-scented body mist, and Lord, this woman smelled good. Spotify shifted to Paul Anka’s ""Put Your Hand on My Shoulder."" I put my hand on her cheek – it was soft and supple, like a feather. I brought her closer, her eyes closed, and my lips embraced the chaos.

After around 10 months of courtship, I was dumped. On my birthday. Yep, you read that right. It hurt in places where it shouldn’t have.  
I had gone all out for this lady after years (I had just come out of a 7-year relationship), quit smoking, never ate non-vegetarian food in front of her so as not to make her queasy, and never came without flowers. I remember an incident where we went to a cafe that had a waiting area, and a guy gave his partner flowers. Everyone went ""aww."" At that moment, I entered, she looked at me, then at the flowers. I knew it was my moment. I unholstered my backpack, out came a bouquet of orchids, two handwritten poems, chocolates, and another gift. She had tears in her eyes. I gave her my handkerchief, scented with my perfume for her. She used to call me ""silvertongue"" for the smoothness I had with words and my ways. For me, we had officially started dating. Apparently, not for her.

I caught her staring at another guy’s picture when I had gone out to the men’s room. Upon inquiry, it turned out it was a guy she had met at some party who had sent her an expensive gift. She returned it. I didn’t pursue the matter further, believing that if she wanted to go, she had the full right to. I gave this woman all of my time, energy, and money, and all she called me was ""emotionally unintelligent"" and ""not her type."" Physically, I am 6'1"", fair as milk, clean-shaven with baby-bottomed cheeks, and apparently, she likes darker guys with beards. Right, personal choice – can't say anything about that.

This sort of dating went on for around 10 months. I took her to every good place I knew, spent money like water, spent time like it was nothing, and refused advances from other people. My eyes were only for her. She said she didn’t want marriage or kids, and that was fine – I could live with that. She wanted to go for higher education, and I was fine to wait. Now, as I type this, I realize I was an idiot. What else is needed? I’m a fairly decent-looking guy, I maintain myself, and I’ve dated my fair share of women. Yet, during all the time I was with her, she never called me ""baby"" even once. The one time she called me ""baby"" was on my birthday. I should have known I was about to be hit with a brick.

This woman made my birthday a blast. Every moment I spent with her, I cherished. I tried my best, and in the end, I wasn’t enough. What was my fault? Too much love? Commitment? When did these things become a downer? I just want to hear from the gang – what was so bad about me?",3,1736339366.0,AskIndianWomen,11,0.62,False

About me: As @ 20 Nov 2024 - 46yo, weigh 109KG, more than 30% body fat.

Lifestyle - mostly sedentary. Not active at all.

Food intake - usually only eat 1-2 meals a day (has been a habit I've inculcated since young). I drink about 4 small cups of coffee a day (full cream milk, no sugar).

I decided to make a change as I didn't quite like what I saw in the mirror.

After 20 Nov 2024, I started doing the following:

weight training 1.5hrs, 3 days On/ 1 day Off (six days a week).
post workout: creatine mixed with protein water (1 scoop).
switched to OMAD. Meal was majority protein and fat only. But I realised I couldn't eat much (probably taking in less than 800 calories).
cleared 10,000 steps daily.
burning approx 3,000 calories a day (based on my Fitbit info)
4 small cups of coffee with milk throughout the day (no sugar).
drink 4-5 cups of water daily.
decent 6 to 8 hrs of sleep.
I take my weight every Monday morning. Last weight measurement was taken on Monday 6 Jan 2025 and I weighed in at 103.3KG.

Im going on to 47 and I have a slight shoulder injury. But I still push myself with weights and/or more reps when I feel shoulder discomfort. After training, I feel a good pump and muscle soreness, but after awhile I feel as though my muscles ""deflate"".

Ideally I would like to reach 80KG by the end of the year with 10-15% body fat. I'd also like to put on some muscle mass.

I believe I could do better with nutrition, but I've tried and I really can't eat 4-5 small meals a day. I find it very hard for my food to digest and I often feel bloated.

At my current rate of doing things, what can I realistically hope to achieve by end November 2025 (1 year)?

Also, would I be able to build muscles along the way or is it a long shot because of my insufficient protein intake?

Many thanks in advance, Cheers.",3,1736339308.0,WorkoutRoutines,2,1.0,False

This post is concerned with the issue of rosters. No judgement whatsoever to anyone who does/has, but I just simply cannot fathom it in my experience. Maybe Im rather oldschool, maybe I dont live in reality, idk which one it is. I could never operate like that. Im too much of a feeler and monogamous and I do take people seriously. I crave connection, I invest fully in the person im seeing and my focus is solely on them.

Do people really go out on dates while simultaneously entertaining a bunch of other people, having them lined up, actively sleeping with them etc? So assuming im going out on a date with a guy whom I really like and want things to progress further, do you understand how much of a clown that makes me look - sitting across the table from him, talking, enjoying our coffee/meal, having a great time together, exchanging compliments, hearing him say how he'd love to get to know each other more ... to only know he's texting a bunch of other girls after we're done and have idk how many sleepovers with different women weekly? Like do you understand how detrimental that is for someone who views the person seriously and wants to date them? What's the point of taking me out or showing interest? Is it a competition of ""whoever from my roster impresses me more that's whom I'll take more seriously?"" Do they even have the time or headspace to develop feelings, process or think things through? Or do they senselessly jump from one thing to another completely numb and desensitised just ""for the plot""?

Ofc I can't say anything, it's their life, their right, their mentality. But do you see how for people who are genuine and want to connect with someone it's an ABSOLUTE CATASTROPHE? Like we'll go out, I'll like him more and more each time, will start falling for him to only know Im just a number on his list and he's only seeing me because some other number didnt work out or dropped him... ?

This topic deeply troubles me going forward as a woman in her 20s. How to best approach this as a young person? Should we go about meeting people entirely with no expectations, casual, friendly etc? Not take anyone seriously at all? Should I show my interest? Should I just view it as a one-time meeting and then nothing? What if they expect s3x or ONS and take it as a given that that's what we're here to do ... ? Even if the concept of rosters is real, who would openly admit it upon asking? It's like an unspoken/unwritten ""rule"" kinda ... Please (particularly fellow Gen Zers), provide me with your insights cuz I'm kind of starting to lose it...

TL;DR : Should I be taking people seriously in dating?",0,1736339236.0,relationships,3,0.25,False

1hwiyq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/woodworking/comments/1hwiyq8/butcher_block_table_separating_at_glued_seams/,Butcher block table separating at glued seams,"https://preview.redd.it/fqtycoy6jrbe1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ad14f85650f9a175ea9418b4e5621b38b58c291c

I built a butcher block table from recycled and refinished parts of a 40-year-old butcher block table. Before the rebuild, all the glue seams were tight and flush. In the \~3 months since, several of the seams have started to open up (see photo with highlighting). Why? What can I do to fix it? More importantly, what can I do to prevent it from getting worse? Thank you.

Details:

The original, 40-year-old table was a square coffee table with pegged legs and a light, glossy, polyurethane (or polyurethane-like) finish. I cut the legs off, cut the two side rails off, and glued the side rails to the ends of the original table to make a rectangular table (see second picture, below). Before doing this, I ran a saw along either end to remove 1/16"" finish. I glued the new end rails with Titebond III, clamped it for 24 hours, and then put four screws in at each end, diagonally up from the bottom (see third picture). I then sanded the top and sides of the new table to remove all the old finish, sanded down to 400 grit, and refinished with Odie's Oil (a tung oil product) according to the instructions. (The bottom of the table \[except for where I added the steel legs\] is not sanded and still has its original finish.)

I noticed the first joint separation after a couple of weeks, at one end, in the lower right of the picture. Around the same time, I noticed that the end of the new end rails and the old dowels were no longer quite flush with the sides, as they had been after sanding. So I assumed that the end rails were taking in humidity from the air, expanding more along their length than the other rails did along their width, and pulling the other rails slightly apart at the ends. After another month or so, a larger separation occurred between two rails in the middle of the table, this one starting from the center of the table and extending toward the ends; in this case, the end rails appear to be holding it together at the ends, if anything. (The very slight gap between the end rails and the rest of the table is a result of my imperfect gluing, not separation since then.)

I did the rebuild in mid-October, and the table spent a week or so (on and off) in a humid basement during the rebuild. All of the separation has occurred since then, in my radiator-heated house in the northeast with its dry winter air.

1hwiwvh,https://www.reddit.com/r/rome/comments/1hwiwvh/my_48hrs_in_rome/,My 48hrs in Rome,"My wife surprised me with a short notice, 2 night trip to Rome, with only the hotel booked. What a lovely city 😍 

I spent the day before reviewing this sub reddit for ideas on places to eat, getting around, what to expect etc.

For future travellers this is how we got on:

**Day 1:**

Arrival at 10am. Collection of bags, as we were walking out of the airport we saw 3 kiosks for buses to Rome Termini. A quick chat with the helpful lady and our return tickets were bought and we were on the bus. (€12 each)

We ate at Osteria il riposto, as we were early for check in. Lovely friendly place, good food, recommended!

Got to check in early at Hotel Sonya. Basic hotel, but it was booked solely for sleeping/washing in.(think travel lodge or premier inn, but touch more basic.) Beds were comfy, staff friendly, place was clean.

After that we went for a walk to explore, get our bearings  found the colloseum and walked around that (too late to get tickets for it) then wondered and found the 
Papal Basilica of Saint Mary Major

Another beautiful chapel, with amazing architecture to enjoy.

Back to hotel for shower, change and then to Pizzeria est est est for dinner, probably my favourite place of the trip.

**Day 2:**

**Colloseum**
 - we did the basic tickets. Buying these was interesting. Being a very last minute trip, we were booking these for the next day. We had wanted a morning slot, but they only had 2.45pm. We left it, started planning to do Vatican instead, looked again, 2.45pm no longer available, but 1.15pm was. And so the fun began, we were on and off the booking site, as 1 timeslot vanished, another would appear, or sometimes it showed as all sold out. We were lucky in that we had already walked the outside of it, so if we got no tickets inside, we had other ideas. Then an 11.30am slot was available, so we booked that there and then!


Well worth the walk around. Everyone stops right at the start to get their photo of it. Ignore them, keep walking, plenty of places to get pictures of the colloseum as you walk round.

**Roman Forum:**

Part of the colloseum tickets, again look at what they built, what it was used for and soak it all in.
 
We then talk a walk along by the river to Vatican City. Took about an hour plus our stop at Glenda bistrot cocktail for lunch. Before we continued on.

Vatican city - absolutely stunning (and free!). Could walk around there in amazement all day!

Sistene chapel - closed when we got there, sadly. So check your opening times!

Walk back to the hotel before dinner at Antica boheme -lasagne, amatrciano, wine, salad, bruschetta - €70

On leaving, 10 min walk to Termini, sarnie, crossing, 2 soft drinks at Eataly €16, then 2 doughnuts (real ones, with decent jam, far better than the UK ones!) Tea and coffee for €10.

**TLDR Section:**

Romeairportbus by schiaffini from Ciampino €12 return, each.

Hotel Sonya, basic, cheap, clean and comfy. If you're only sleeping/changing there, recommend it. 

A dinner or lunch for 2 with alcoholic drink  is around €60.

Wear comfortable shoes.

Look up. Look around. It's a beautiful city!


Every place we ate had a lovely vibe from fellow patrons and the staff. Could not complain at all. Oh and that brown bag has your bread in it.

Busy city, as you'd expect. Watch out for cars, they dont stop for zebra crossings!and people don't move out of your way. Just treat it like any other major capital city.

If you can read a map, it's well worth the walk, we did colloseum to Vatican back to Opera house, and whilst it's quiet far, break it up with lunch, Gellato and look and enjoy the architecture that's just around every corner.


**Where we ate:**

Antica boheme -lasagne, amatrciano, wine, salad, bruschetta - €70

Osteria il riposto near hotel/opera house  beer, coke, amatricana, ravioli €44.50

Glenda bistrot cocktail - beer, coke, veal meat balls, bruschetta, risotto €53

Pizzeria est est est, wine, stuffed courgette, 2 x pizzas €60

Eataly - Crossiant, ham, mozzarella and pistachio sandwich, 2 soft drinks €16.

Ignore any resteraunt that is inviting you in!

1hwiw7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/beards/comments/1hwiw7h/ok_rbeards_time_to_help_us_axe_a_scent/,"Ok, r/beards, time to help us AXE a scent. ","In an attempt to tighten up the operation over here, we've made the choice to axe a 1 or 2 of our oil scents, and we want your opinion.

In full transparency, we already know which are the least popular sellers, and which are the most, and that will likely inform the decision the most, but we still want your input.

Also, bear in mind, we use ZERO synthetic fragrances, so all of these are scents crafted with the art of perfuming. Top, middle, base notes, carefully balanced.

Comment what sounds good and what you'd be likely to hate. We all have our preferences! I'm going to let this run for 24 hours and then I'll lock comments. We're going to pull atleast one from the market within the week, and likely 1-2 more next week. Maybe more. We'd like to have around 10-12 total.
