**A Scholarly Analysis**

# Abstract

This paper critically examines the widely held belief that consumers invariably spend more when using credit cards compared to cash. While a body of research supports this ""cashless effect,"" we argue that its popularization by financial commentators often relies on methodologically limited studies and overlooks crucial nuances. This analysis deconstructs the psychological mechanisms‚Äîincluding the ""pain of paying,"" ""mental accounting,"" and neural reward activation‚Äîthat underpin differential spending behaviors. We conduct a critical review of the empirical evidence, questioning the external validity of seminal experiments and the veracity of oft-cited but apocryphal studies. The paper's central thesis posits that the most significant variable is not the payment medium itself, but the user type. By synthesizing academic literature on ""transactors"" (who pay balances in full) and ""revolvers"" (who carry debt), we demonstrate that these groups exhibit fundamentally different financial behaviors, rendering blanket statements about ""overspending"" misleading. We conclude that the ""paper vs. plastic"" debate is a false dichotomy; a more accurate understanding requires a segmented approach that considers a consumer's underlying relationship with credit and debt. This nuanced perspective has profound implications for financial education, policymaking, and the responsible design of future payment systems.

# 1.0 Introduction: The Ubiquitous Heuristic of ""Plastic Overspending""

# 1.1 The Popular Narrative

A foundational tenet of modern personal finance advice is the assertion that consumers spend more, often significantly more, when using ""plastic"" payment methods compared to physical cash. This notion has been elevated from an academic curiosity to a widely accepted heuristic, shaping the financial guidance dispensed by popular commentators, news agencies, and lifestyle publications. The narrative is typically supported by a set of compelling, easily digestible statistics that appear to provide empirical certainty. Chief among these is the claim, often attributed to a Dun & Bradstreet study, that people spend between 12% and 18% more when using credit cards instead of cash.^(1) This specific range has become a cornerstone of the argument, repeated so frequently that it has achieved the status of an undisputed fact in many circles.

To further illustrate the magnitude of this effect, specific real-world examples are often deployed. One of the most prominent is the case of McDonald's, where the average transaction value was reported to increase from $4.50 for cash-paying customers to $7.00 for those using a credit card‚Äîa jump of over 55%.^(1) Similarly, research has been cited showing that restaurant diners tip approximately 4.3% more on average simply by seeing a credit card logo on the bill tray.^(2) These figures paint a clear picture: the move away from tangible money toward abstract forms of payment loosens consumer inhibitions and encourages higher expenditure.

This perspective is championed most forcefully by financial personalities like Dave Ramsey, who has built a significant portion of his financial philosophy around the dangers of credit. Ramsey and his organization argue that the reduced friction of plastic payments fundamentally alters spending behavior. He posits that physically handing over cash activates pain centers in the brain, creating a natural brake on spending, whereas swiping a card is an emotionally detached act that encourages impulse purchases and leads to overspending.^(4) This narrative functions as a powerful and intuitive heuristic‚Äîa mental shortcut that provides a simple, actionable rule: to control spending, one must use cash.

# 1.2 Thesis and Roadmap

While psychologically intuitive and widely promulgated, the ""plastic overspending"" heuristic is a significant oversimplification of a complex set of consumer behaviors. It obscures a more nuanced reality where the magnitude of the effect is debatable, the foundational evidence is often context-specific and potentially weakening over time, and the most critical determinant of financial outcomes is not the payment medium itself, but the behavioral profile of the consumer. This paper argues that the central variable missing from the popular discourse is the fundamental distinction between two types of credit card users: ""transactors,"" who use cards for convenience and pay their balances in full each month, and ""revolvers,"" who use cards as a borrowing tool and carry persistent debt.

This analysis will proceed by systematically deconstructing the popular narrative and reconstructing a more evidence-based model. Section 2.0 will explore the established psychological theories that explain why payment form can influence spending, including the ""pain of paying,"" ""mental accounting,"" and the more recent neuroeconomic findings on reward activation. Section 3.0 will turn a critical eye to the empirical evidence itself, evaluating the methodological limitations of seminal experiments, investigating the veracity of the oft-cited Dun & Bradstreet study, and contextualizing the phenomenon with findings from a recent large-scale meta-analysis. Section 4.0 will introduce the paper's central thesis: the pivotal distinction between transactor and revolver archetypes, demonstrating how their divergent financial realities render blanket advice about ""overspending"" inappropriate. Section 5.0 will then re-examine the advice of prominent financial gurus through this new lens, re-framing their gospels as targeted behavioral interventions rather than universal truths. Finally, the conclusion will synthesize these findings, arguing that the ""paper vs. plastic"" debate is a false dichotomy that must be replaced by a more sophisticated, user-segmented understanding to promote genuine financial well-being in an increasingly cashless world.

# 2.0 The Psychology of Payment: Deconstructing the ""Cashless Effect""

The assertion that payment method influences spending behavior is not merely anecdotal; it is grounded in several well-established theories from behavioral economics and psychology. These frameworks provide a cognitive and emotional basis for understanding why parting with a crisp dollar bill can feel profoundly different from swiping a plastic card, even when the nominal value is identical. The ""cashless effect"" is not a single phenomenon but rather the outcome of multiple, interacting psychological mechanisms.

# 2.1 The Foundational Theory: The ""Pain of Paying""

The most widely cited explanation for the cashless effect is the concept of the ""pain of paying"".^(8) First articulated by Ofer Zellermayer in 1996, this theory posits that the act of spending money triggers a negative emotional response, an experience akin to a loss.^(8) This psychological discomfort is rooted in the principle of loss aversion, which holds that humans experience the pain of a loss more intensely than the pleasure of an equivalent gain.^(8) Because spending is a form of financial loss, it can be inherently painful, and the more a purchase hurts, the less willing a consumer is to make it.^(10)

The intensity of this pain, however, is not uniform across all payment methods. Cash transactions are considered the most ""painful"" because of their tangibility and salience. The physical act of counting out and handing over bills makes the depletion of one's resources immediate, visible, and concrete.^(2) This vivid experience reinforces the sense of loss with each transaction, acting as a natural check on spending.^(12) Neuroeconomic research has lent physical credence to this concept. Studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have shown that making purchase decisions can activate the insular cortex, a region of the brain that is also involved in processing physical pain and other aversive stimuli.^(13)

In stark contrast, credit cards are said to ""anesthetize"" this pain.^(13) They achieve this by creating both a temporal and an emotional distance between the pleasure of acquisition and the pain of payment. This phenomenon, known as ""payment decoupling,"" separates the immediate benefit of receiving a good or service from the delayed cost, which only becomes salient when the monthly statement arrives.^(8) When a consumer swipes a card, they are not immediately parting with their own money; they are, in effect, borrowing from a future self.^(2) This abstraction makes the loss feel theoretical rather than real, allowing the brain to focus on the positive aspects of the purchase and loosening spending inhibitions.^(1) The payment is less coupled with the consumption, reducing the aversive feeling and encouraging higher expenditure.^(11)

# 2.2 Mental Accounting: The Illusion of Fungibility

Complementing the ""pain of paying"" is the theory of ""mental accounting,"" developed by Nobel laureate Richard Thaler. This theory challenges the classical economic assumption that money is fungible‚Äîthat is, that a dollar is a dollar, regardless of its origin or intended use. Instead, Thaler demonstrated that individuals tend to compartmentalize their funds into different mental ""accounts,"" assigning subjective values and rules to each.^(15) People create distinct buckets for ""salary,"" ""savings,"" ""windfall gains,"" or ""entertainment money,"" and they treat these accounts as non-interchangeable.^(18)

This cognitive bias has profound implications for payment choice. Cash held in a physical wallet is often categorized in a ""current income"" or ""daily spending"" account. Spending from this account feels like a direct and immediate depletion of a finite resource, prompting more deliberate and cautious behavior.^(15) Credit, on the other hand, is often perceived not as money being spent, but as a line of credit being accessed. It resides in a separate mental account, one that feels more abstract and less constrained than the cash-on-hand account.^(16) Spending on a credit card, therefore, does not feel like a direct withdrawal from one's primary budget but rather a transaction with ""future money,"" which is psychologically easier to part with.^(15)

The consequences of mental accounting can be starkly irrational. It helps explain why an individual might meticulously budget their salary-based spending yet recklessly spend a tax refund or a small inheritance, as this ""found money"" is in a different, less protected mental account.^(17) It also explains the common but financially illogical behavior of maintaining a low-interest savings account while simultaneously carrying high-interest credit card debt. In the individual's mind, the ""savings"" account is sacrosanct and separate from the ""debt"" account, even though using the savings to pay off the high-cost debt would result in a significant net financial gain.^(18) By creating these artificial partitions, mental accounting makes spending on credit feel less impactful to one's immediate financial position.

# 2.3 Beyond Anesthesia: Reward Activation and Craving

For many years, the ""pain of paying"" was the dominant explanation for the cashless effect. The prevailing model was that credit cards ""release the brakes"" on spending by reducing a negative feeling. However, more recent research, particularly from the field of neuroeconomics, has introduced a compelling alternative and complementary theory: that credit cards also actively ""step on the gas"".^(20)

A groundbreaking study from researchers at MIT and the University of Utah used fMRI to observe brain activity during real purchase decisions.^(22) Participants used their own cash and credit cards to buy products while inside the scanner. The researchers found that the opportunity to use a credit card specifically engaged the brain's reward networks, most notably the striatum.^(20) This is the same dopaminergic reward center that is implicated in cravings and is exploited by addictive substances like cocaine and amphetamines.^(20)

Two findings from this research are particularly significant. First, this reward activation was not strongly correlated with the price of the product being considered; it appeared to be a response to the payment method itself. Second, the activation occurred when the credit card cue was presented, *before* the consumer had even made the final decision to buy.^(21) In contrast, cash purchases did not elicit the same strong activation in these reward pathways.^(23) This evidence suggests a mechanism of classical conditioning, where the credit card itself‚Äîthrough repeated association with the rewards of consumption‚Äîbecomes a powerful cue that triggers a craving or motivation to spend.^(22)

This ""step on the gas"" theory does not necessarily invalidate the ""release the brakes"" model of pain reduction. The two mechanisms could work in tandem, creating a potent psychological environment for increased spending. The credit card may simultaneously make the act of paying less painful while also making the prospect of buying more pleasurable and desirable. This dual effect‚Äîreducing a negative and amplifying a positive‚Äîprovides a more comprehensive explanation for why cashless payments can so effectively facilitate spending. It also establishes that the psychological drivers are linked to the properties of the payment method‚Äîits tangibility, salience, and conditioned cues‚Äîwhich has crucial implications for understanding all forms of cashless transactions, not just credit cards.

# 3.0 A Critical Examination of the Empirical Evidence

The psychological theories underpinning the cashless effect provide a plausible ""why,"" but the popular narrative of overspending rests on the perceived strength of the empirical ""what."" Financial commentators and news articles frequently cite studies as definitive proof that credit cards cause consumers to spend dramatically more. However, a rigorous examination of this evidence reveals a more complex and less certain picture. The foundational studies have significant limitations, the most widely cited statistic appears to be apocryphal, and the overall effect may be diminishing over time.

# 3.1 The Foundational Experiment: Prelec & Simester (2001)

Much of the academic and popular belief in a large ""credit card premium"" can be traced back to a highly influential 2001 study by MIT professors Drazen Prelec and Duncan Simester titled ""Always Leave Home Without It: A Further Investigation of the Credit-Card Effect on Willingness to Pay"".^(24) This research moved beyond hypothetical scenarios to investigate behavior in genuine transactions.

The study's primary experiment involved an auction for highly desirable goods: tickets to a sold-out Boston Celtics basketball game. The participants were MBA students at MIT, who were randomly assigned to one of two conditions. One group was instructed that if they won the auction, payment would be required in cash. The other group was instructed that payment would be required by credit card.^(24) The results were striking. The students who were told they would pay by credit card were willing to bid, on average, more than twice as much as their counterparts in the cash condition. The mean bid for the Celtics tickets was $60.64 in the credit card group versus just $28.51 in the cash group, representing a premium of over 113%.^(2)

While these findings are dramatic and frequently cited, a critical analysis exposes several methodological limitations that challenge their generalizability:

* **External Validity:** The study's participants were MBA students, a demographic that is not representative of the general consumer population in terms of income, financial literacy, or cognitive habits.^(24) Their spending behavior may not accurately reflect that of a typical household.
* **Context Specificity:** The massive premium was observed for a product with a highly uncertain and subjective market value‚Äîtickets to a sold-out sporting event.^(24) In a follow-up experiment within the same paper, the researchers auctioned a product with a known, fixed value (a restaurant gift certificate). In this second study, the large credit card premium did not consistently appear.^(24) This crucial detail suggests that the cashless effect may be most potent in situations of valuation ambiguity, where the consumer is unsure what a ""fair"" price is. It is far less certain that the same effect would apply to routine, budgeted purchases like groceries or gasoline, where prices are known and comparable.
* **Artificiality of Choice:** In the experiment, the payment method was *instructed* by the researchers. This does not mirror real-world scenarios where consumers self-select their payment method based on their own habits, preferences, liquidity, and the nature of the purchase. This artificial constraint is a significant departure from organic consumer behavior.

# 3.2 The Debit Card Conundrum and the ""Cashless"" Effect

A central inconsistency in the advice of many financial commentators is the condemnation of credit cards as ""not cash"" while simultaneously recommending debit cards, which are also a form of intangible ""plastic."" If the primary psychological driver of overspending is the abstract nature of the payment, then debit cards should produce a similar effect to credit cards when compared with cash. The academic evidence strongly supports this conclusion.

An incentivized experiment conducted by researchers at the Copenhagen Business School was designed specifically to isolate the effect of payment form by comparing debit card and cash spending.^(26) The study found that participants' willingness-to-pay for identical products was between 22% and 54% higher when they were instructed to pay with a debit card versus cash. This effect persisted even after the researchers controlled for potential confounding variables like cash-on-hand constraints.^(26) Similarly, a field study observing shoppers leaving a grocery store found that customers paying with credit cards (average purchase $11.45) and debit cards (average purchase $11.08) spent nearly identical amounts, both of which were significantly higher than the average purchase for cash-paying customers ($6.65).^(10)

These findings have a critical implication: the phenomenon is more accurately described as a ""cashless effect"" rather than a specific ""credit card effect"".^(8) The key distinction in spending behavior is not between borrowing (credit) and owning (debit), but between tangible money (cash) and intangible money (all cards and digital payments). Therefore, financial advice that focuses exclusively on the debt-related risks of credit cards, while ignoring the shared psychological impact of debit cards on spending behavior, fails to address the root cause of the overspending it seeks to prevent. The recommendation to switch from a credit card to a debit card is primarily a debt mitigation strategy, not a spending control strategy.

# 3.3 The Apocryphal ""Dun & Bradstreet Study""

Perhaps the most pervasive statistic in the ""paper vs. plastic"" debate is the claim that a study by Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) found that consumers spend 12% to 18% more when using credit cards.^(1) This specific data point is a favorite of news articles, blogs, and financial advisors due to its apparent precision and authoritative source.

However, an investigation into the nature of Dun & Bradstreet and a review of the available research reveal this claim to be highly suspect. The provided research material contains no link to a primary source for this consumer spending study. Furthermore, Dun & Bradstreet is a well-known *business* credit bureau.^(28) Its primary functions are to issue unique identifiers for businesses (DUNS Numbers) and to compile business credit reports and scores (like the PAYDEX score) to help lenders and vendors assess corporate creditworthiness.^(28) The company's focus is on business-to-business trade credit, not on the psychology of individual consumer purchasing habits.

Given the absence of a primary source and the clear discrepancy between the alleged research topic and D&B's actual area of expertise, it is highly probable that the widely cited ""Dun & Bradstreet study"" is apocryphal. It may be a misattribution of another study, a piece of marketing content from a payment processing company that has been laundered over time into a ""study,"" or a complete fabrication. Its persistence in popular financial media underscores a concerning lack of rigor and a tendency to repeat compelling statistics without verification. For the purposes of this scholarly analysis, this claim must be treated as unsubstantiated and an example of how financial myths can become entrenched in public discourse.

# 3.4 The Fading Effect: A Meta-Analytic Perspective

While individual studies provide snapshots, a meta-analysis offers a more comprehensive and statistically robust view of an entire body of research. A recent large-scale meta-analysis on the cashless effect synthesized the results of 392 effect sizes drawn from 71 different papers, providing a crucial quantitative counterpoint to the sensationalized claims often seen in the media.^(27)

The findings of this meta-analysis are revealing and temper the narrative of a massive, universal overspending effect:

1. **A Real but Small Effect:** The analysis confirmed that a cashless effect does exist and is statistically significant. However, the overall magnitude of the effect is small, far from the 100% premiums seen in some lab experiments or the 12-18% figures from popular lore.^(27)
2. **A Weakening Phenomenon:** Crucially, the meta-analysis revealed that the strength of the cashless effect has been *weakening over time*.^(27) This suggests that as consumers become more familiar and habituated to using non-cash payment methods, the psychological power of the medium itself diminishes. The initial shock of payment intangibility may have produced larger effects in past decades, but in a world where card and digital payments are the norm, the behavioral impact is fading. Data from the Federal Reserve confirms this societal shift, showing a dramatic increase in card payments and a corresponding decrease in the share of cash transactions over the past decade.^(31)
3. **Context is Key:** The effect is not uniform across all situations. The meta-analysis found that the cashless effect is stronger in the context of *conspicuous consumption* (e.g., purchasing luxury goods to signal status) and weaker for *pro-social spending* (e.g., charitable donations).^(27) Furthermore, the effect is influenced by the broader economic environment, being stronger during periods of economic growth.^(27)

This meta-analytic evidence fundamentally reframes the debate. It moves the cashless effect from a seemingly large and immutable law of consumer psychology to a smaller, context-dependent, and historically transient phenomenon. Advice based on decades-old studies or apocryphal statistics may be increasingly irrelevant in a modern economy where cashless transactions are no longer a novelty but the default for a majority of consumers.

# 4.0 The Missing Variable: A Dichotomy of Users

The entire ""paper vs. plastic"" debate, as it is popularly framed, suffers from a critical flaw: it treats all credit card users as a monolithic group. By focusing solely on the payment instrument, the discourse ignores the most powerful explanatory variable of all‚Äîthe underlying financial behavior and motivations of the individual user. The academic literature, in contrast, makes a clear and fundamental distinction between two user archetypes whose financial realities are so divergent that applying a single rule or judgment to both is inherently misleading.

# 4.1 Defining the Archetypes: ""Transactors"" and ""Revolvers""

Research in consumer finance consistently segments the credit card-holding population into two primary groups: ""transactors"" and ""revolvers"".^(33) These two groups, each comprising roughly half of all U.S. adult cardholders, are defined by how they manage their credit card balances.^(33)

* **Transactors:** Also known as ""convenience users,"" transactors utilize credit cards primarily for their transactional benefits‚Äîconvenience, security, and rewards. The defining characteristic of this group is that they pay their statement balance *in full* every month, thereby avoiding all interest charges.^(33) For them, a credit card functions like a charge card, providing a short-term, interest-free loan that is fully settled at the end of each billing cycle. Demographically, studies have found that transactors tend to be older, have higher incomes and education levels, and hold more assets than their counterparts.^(34)
* **Revolvers:** This group uses credit cards as a tool for borrowing and managing liquidity. The defining characteristic of revolvers is that they *carry a balance* from one month to the next, paying interest on the outstanding debt.^(33) They use their available credit to finance consumption over time, often for many years.^(33) Revolvers are the primary source of interest income for card issuers.^(35) Demographically, they tend to be younger and less affluent than transactors.^(34) Research has shown that this revolving behavior is remarkably persistent; a person's credit utilization rate tends to remain stable over their lifetime, even as their income and credit limits increase.^(33)

# 4.2 Divergent Financial Realities and Behaviors

The distinction between these two groups is not merely semantic; they operate under fundamentally different economic and psychological models. Their spending decisions are driven by different factors, and their relationship with credit is oppositional.

For **transactors**, spending is closely tethered to their *current income*.^(33) They use their credit card as a payment mechanism for consumption they can already afford. When their income rises, their spending may rise, but their behavior is constrained by their ability to clear the balance at the end of the month. Their debt level is simply a temporary float of their monthly expenditures.

For **revolvers**, the primary driver of spending is not income, but *available credit*.^(33) For this group, credit is not just a payment tool but a buffer against financial shocks and a source of liquidity. Consequently, an increase in their credit limit is often perceived as an increase in their wealth or purchasing power. This perception leads directly to increased spending, which in turn increases their debt and lowers their long-term consumption potential due to interest costs.^(33) This behavior is described by researchers as being driven by an ""impatience to consume more now"".^(33)

The most critical finding in the academic literature highlights this divergence. Multiple studies, including extensive analysis of credit bureau data by researchers at the Federal Reserve and West Virginia University, have investigated the ""pass-through"" effect of credit limit increases on debt levels. The results are stark: for consumers identified as likely **revolvers**, nearly 100 percent of an increase in their credit limit eventually becomes an increase in their outstanding debt.^(37) In contrast, for

**transactors**, an increase in their credit limit has a negligible impact on their (non-existent) long-term debt.^(37) The same stimulus‚Äîa higher credit limit‚Äîproduces completely different outcomes depending on the user type.

# 4.3 Proposed Table: Comparative Profile of Credit Card User Archetypes

To crystallize these fundamental differences, the following table synthesizes the defining characteristics of transactors and revolvers based on the academic literature. This side-by-side comparison makes the distinction between the two groups irrefutable and underscores the inadequacy of a one-size-fits-all view of credit card users.

|| || |Feature|**Transactors (Convenience Users)|Revolvers (Borrowers)| |Definition**|Pay balance in full monthly|Carry a balance month-to-month| |**Primary Motivation**|Transaction convenience, rewards, security|Short-term liquidity, financing consumption| |**Primary Spending Driver**|Current Income|Available Credit Limit| |**Debt Management**|Avoids interest; debt is temporary float|Incurs interest; debt is a persistent liability| |**Response to Credit Limit ‚Üë**|Minimal impact on debt level|Near 100% pass-through to long-term debt| |**Psychological Profile**|Higher self-control, future-oriented|""Impatient"" to consume now, present-oriented| |**Key Demographics**|Typically older, higher income, more educated|Typically younger, lower income| |**Data Sources**|^(33)|^(33)|

# 4.4 Re-evaluating ""Overspending""

The introduction of the transactor/revolver dichotomy forces a re-evaluation of the very concept of ""overspending."" The term is rendered meaningless without first identifying which user is being discussed.

For a **transactor**, the notion of ""overspending"" simply because they use a credit card is a mischaracterization of rational financial behavior. If a high-income transactor spends more on their credit card than a lower-income cash user, this is not evidence of a psychological flaw. It is a reflection of their higher disposable income and their strategic choice to use a payment tool that offers rewards, fraud protection, and convenience. As long as they remain within their budget and pay the balance in full, their higher transaction values are a sign of responsible, optimized use of a financial product, not ""overspending.""

For a **revolver**, the situation is entirely different. For this group, the cashless effect is a direct and perilous pathway to financial distress. Any psychologically-induced increase in spending translates directly into higher-cost debt that compounds over time. For a revolver, ""overspending"" is a real and damaging phenomenon where consumption exceeds the ability to pay, leading to a cycle of debt. It is this specific behavior, within this specific population, that should be the target of financial education and behavioral interventions.

This segmentation also helps to deconstruct misleading statistics. The oft-cited observation that the average non-cash transaction ($112) is dramatically higher than the average cash transaction ($22) is frequently presented as prima facie evidence of overspending.^(2) However, viewed through the lens of user choice, a more logical explanation emerges. This disparity is likely a statistical artifact reflecting

*different use cases* for different payment methods. Consumers rationally choose to use cash for small, incidental purchases (e.g., a cup of coffee, a snack), while they logically use a card for larger, planned purchases (e.g., a week's worth of groceries, a tank of gas) where carrying large amounts of cash is impractical and the benefits of card use (security, rewards, record-keeping) are more valuable. Federal Reserve data supports this, showing that cash is the dominant payment method for transactions under $10, while cards are used across a wide range of transaction values.^(39) The 409% jump in average transaction value is therefore not a measure of a single purchase being inflated, but rather a reflection of comparing apples (small cash purchases) and oranges (large card purchases).

# 5.0 The Gurus and Their Gospels: An Analysis of Financial Advice

The popular financial advice landscape is dominated by charismatic figures who offer clear, prescriptive rules for managing money. When their advice on credit cards is analyzed through the evidence-based framework of user segmentation, it becomes clear that their seemingly contradictory gospels are not necessarily ""right"" or ""wrong"" in a universal sense. Rather, they are highly targeted, albeit often implicitly, behavioral interventions designed for different segments of the population. The failure lies not in the advice itself, but in its presentation as a one-size-fits-all solution.

# 5.1 The Absolutist (Dave Ramsey): A Behavioral Intervention for Revolvers

Dave Ramsey's financial philosophy is built on a foundation of debt aversion, and his stance on credit cards is unequivocal and absolutist: they are a financial menace to be avoided at all costs. He advocates for a ""cash is king"" approach, permitting only the use of physical cash or a debit card for all transactions.^(5) His core argument is that credit cards are a trap engineered by banks to lure consumers into debt. To support this, he frequently cites the psychological principles discussed earlier, arguing that the physical ""pain of paying"" with cash is a necessary emotional check on spending, and he references the MIT study to claim that plastic's frictionless nature leads to significant overspending.^(4)

When viewed through the transactor/revolver lens, Ramsey's advice can be interpreted as a powerful and highly effective behavioral intervention designed specifically for the archetypal **revolver**. His system is a form of behavioral straightjacket for individuals who exhibit low financial self-control or an ""impatience to consume"".^(33) By mandating a ""cash only"" (or debit only) system, he achieves two crucial outcomes for this target audience:

1. **Elimination of Debt Risk:** By forbidding the use of a credit instrument, he removes the primary mechanism through which revolvers accumulate high-interest debt. With a debit card, spending is hard-capped by the funds available in the bank account.
2. **Maximization of Spending Friction:** By encouraging the use of physical cash (e.g., through his ""envelope system""), he forces the user to experience the full, unanesthetized ""pain of paying,"" leveraging this psychological friction to curb impulse purchases and enforce budget discipline.^(5)

However, the critique of Ramsey's approach lies in its absolutism. While it may be a potent remedy for revolvers or those at risk of becoming them, it is a poor and unnecessarily restrictive prescription for responsible **transactors**. For this group, his advice actively works against their financial interests by denying them the substantial benefits of credit card use, such as cash-back rewards, travel points, robust fraud protection (which is superior to that of debit cards), and the ability to build a strong credit history.^(2) Furthermore, his recommendation to use debit cards as a ""safe"" alternative is psychologically inconsistent. As established in Section 3.2, debit cards produce a similar ""cashless effect"" on the amount spent compared to credit cards.^(10) Ramsey's advice, therefore, does not fully address the psychological drivers of overspending; it focuses solely on eliminating the instrument of debt.

# 5.2 The Pragmatist (Suze Orman): A Risk Management Framework for All

Suze Orman's advice on credit cards presents a more nuanced and pragmatic perspective. Like Ramsey, she is vehemently opposed to carrying high-interest credit card debt, which she colorfully describes as ""bondage"" that holds people back from their financial potential.^(41) She consistently warns her audience about the dangers of rising interest rates and the financial and emotional burden of revolving balances.^(41)

However, unlike Ramsey, Orman does not advocate for the complete abolition of credit cards. She explicitly states that ""everyone needs to also have a credit card and use it responsibly"".^(41) Her framework implicitly recognizes the user dichotomy. Her dire warnings about debt are clearly aimed at the behaviors and risks faced by

**revolvers**. Simultaneously, her acceptance of responsible use acknowledges the existence and legitimacy of **transactors**. Her advice is less about the intrinsic evil of the payment medium and more about a holistic approach to *debt and risk management*. She emphasizes practical strategies such as maintaining a high FICO score to access the best financial products, keeping credit utilization low to signal financial control, and carefully reading the terms to avoid fees.^(43)

Orman's recommendation on debit cards also reveals a more sophisticated understanding of risk. While she is a proponent of debit cards, she offers a crucial security caveat: users should link their primary debit card to a separate checking account funded with only a small amount of money, not to their main savings account.^(44) This strategy mitigates the risk of a thief gaining access to a person's entire life savings through a compromised debit card, a risk not present with credit cards where the consumer's liability is legally limited.

In essence, the conflicting advice from these two financial gurus is not a matter of one being correct and the other incorrect. They are offering different solutions for different problems. Ramsey provides a rigid, behavior-modification program for those struggling with the *problem of debt*. Orman provides a flexible, risk-management toolkit for a broader audience, aiming to help them navigate the modern financial system safely and effectively. The fundamental failure in the popular discourse is the tendency to present these targeted strategies as universal, competing truths, rather than as complementary approaches for distinct consumer populations.

To analyse the effects of shade on physical coffee quality and on sensorial cup quality of Coffea arabica L. cv. Caturra KMC, a study was carried out with 94 plots on 16 farms in two municipalities, Timan√É¬° and Oporapa, located at elevations from 1272 to 1730 masl. in Huila, Colombia. The study was designed with emphasis on shade cover variation within each of the two study areas, while minimizing the variability of environment, agronomic management other than shade, and post-harvest processing. 46 samples of shade coffee and 46 samples of sun coffee were evaluated for physical and sensorial attributes using three professional coffee cuppers (assessors). A principal component analysis including all quality and environmental variables showed that sensory attributes were influenced negatively by shade, and that physical attributes were influenced positively by altitude. A mixed linear model, with coffee cupper and farm as random variables, revealed different shade effects on coffee quality in the two areas. In Oporapa, situated at high altitudes, shade had a negative effect on fragrance, acidity, body, sweetness and preference of the beverage, while no effect was found on the physical quality. In Timan√É¬°, situated at lower altitudes, shade did not have a significant effect on sensorial attributes, but significantly reduced the number of small beans. At high altitudes with low temperatures and no nutrient or water deficits, shade trees may thus have a partly adverse effect on C. arabica cv. Caturra resulting in reduced sensory quality. The occurrence of berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei) was lower at high altitudes and higher under shade. Future studies on shade and coffee quality should focus on the interaction between physical and chemical characteristics of beans.},`

1lrh13a,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1lrh13a/whats_the_maximum_feasible_height_range_for_a/,What's the maximum feasible height range for a custom adjustable desk/etc?,"I live in a small London flat. I'd like to make a multi-function adjustable table/desk/workbench/bench/etc that I could use for several different roles.

My minimum specs:

* needs no attachment to the floor or walls (we have no load-bearing walls or ceilings, just floating drywall/plasterboard, and we're not allowed to drill into the load-bearing parts behind them, nor into the floor)
* can be easily adjusted, without tools, for heights of \~12"" (to be used as floor-cushion-seated dining/gaming/brainstorming, footrest/coffee-table, maybe bench/couch), \~26"" (as chair-seated office/dining/etc), and \~41"" (as standing office/etc & light woodworking)
* can hold at minimum \~20 lb load at any height (once fixed to that height)
* can comfortably fit legs underneath as appropriate to the height (cross-legged or seiza for floor-seated, with rolling office chair for chair-seated, just knees/thighs for standing)
* hold a custom table top (e.g. maybe some sort of strong, thin metal base plate or frame attached to the legs/support, with bolt holes at the corners, into which I could slot an arbitrary sandwich of table surfaces \[e.g. felt, dining-grade wood, workshop-grade wood, whiteboard, or glass depending on the use case\])
* not too heavy (maybe \~20 lb max frame weight?)

It would be especially nice, but not *necessary*, if it could:

* be easily, smoothly adjustable while under \~30 lb load (i.e. monitor, tools, books, yada yada ordinary desk/workbench stuff)
* be adjustable, within that load, without significant physical effort (e.g. electric, pneumatic, well balanced X frame, springs, ???‚Ä¶)
* hold \~250-350 lb load when fixed at a low height configuration (i.e. usable as a bench / couch-base for 2 people ‚Äî n.b. it does *not* need to be adjustable under that much load, nor to take that much load at higher heights)
* be continuously adjustable through the entire \~12‚Äì41"" height range ‚Äî vs e.g. having a \~15"" continuous-adjustable range, plus a couple fixed length leg extension segments per leg to make up the full range (e.g. none at floor-seated height, +\~20"" for chair height, +\~40"" for standing height)

I have a reasonably good idea for how to do the multi surface aspect ‚Äî but I'm having trouble figuring out how to do the support aspect for this wide of a height range.

I'm willing to hire someone to do this, or buy specialty parts. I've searched a fair amount for something like this and not really found anything yet that seems like it'd work. 

I have seen some similar ideas in some random ""look at all this fancy adjustable furniture"" compilation videos, but haven't been able to figure out how they work / where they're sourced. For example, [this Tumblr post](https://web.archive.org/web/20240226045248/https://ampervadasz.tumblr.com/post/730862341585076224) at around 0:20, 0:50, 0:45, 0:49, 1:42, & 2:42 has a few similar ideas, though most of them aren't even identified. So does [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/JqnhaqrfXzE) at around 0:54 (Bellagio by resource furniture), 1:07 (Cristallo by resource furniture), 2:37 (Smart Living), 3:42 (Magi-J glass - tavolino transformable by Calligaris), & 4:15 (Newood by Ozzio Italia), though it's not clear to me how to DIY just the supports of those (so I can do a custom multi-role topper surface), nor whether they could be made to hold any significant weight.

So, dear r/DIY: could y'all give me any suggestions for adjustable support frames I could get (or make) that might fit these specs? (Preferably with specific keywords or links so I can find the thing you're talking about.)

My main desires are just the specs above. I'm open to creative or partial approaches on how to potentially fill them.

E.g. there's potentially the option alluded to above of combining a adjustable seated-to-standing desk converter frame (with \~15"" range) plus fixed leg extensions to move it into the low end of the three ranges (floor, chair, standing).

Or maybe getting a more heavy duty seated-to-standing range pneumatic frame and attaching the legs to locking hinges, so that in low mode they're folded flat against the bottom and stub legs are folded out instead. 

Or maybe nested tubular/square steel legs with the usual spring-button type length adjustment.

Or, even better, something I wouldn't think of even suggesting!",1,1751630526.0,DIY,0,1.0,False

Nothing formal ‚Äî just chatting, grabbing coffee, or exploring the area. If that sounds good to you, feel free to message me!

Hope to hear from you soon üòä

My kitchen doesn't have enough outlets and need to provide power to the coffee cart on the far right of the picture. Only outlet that can do that is the far left of the fridge. Out of the options of 
a) Running the extension cord under the stove
b) Running it behind the stove 
c) Running it behind the shelf above 

My preference would be under the front of the stove as i can hide it the best but I'm just worried if it would get too hot and melt the cord. 

P.S. Renting here so did discuss running power through the baseboard // wall but can't do so.

Any ideas? 
Thanks!

I love to wake up early in the mornings and cozy up with my latest WIP. Sip my coffee and reflect.

Crochet, for me, is therapy. It takes away all of my external stress, of bills, or kids or life‚Äôs hardships. I figure if the most stress I have is why my stitch counts are off or why this doesn‚Äôt look right, then life isn‚Äôt half bad. 

I found myself crying this morning, while doing granny squares; thinking about my relationship with my mother and how I want my kids to feel differently about me than I do her. Wondering if I was enough as a child and if my kids feel their worth around me. 

Uggg, a good old sobbing while crocheting session is free therapy! I had to pause and write this, mainly because I couldn‚Äôt see what I was doing anymore. But, then I wondered if I was just a crazy person or if this happens to anyone else. üòÇü•¥ü§™",2,1751630232.0,crochet,0,1.0,False

Bhaiya ne khana mangwa diya tha‚Äîcrispy dosas aur garam chai ka maza hi alag tha! üòã Khana khate hue hum dono ke beech ek ajeeb si khamoshi thi, par woh comfortable wali, jisme dil se dil tak ek connection feel hota hai. Fir humne decide kiya ki thodi der bahar ghumne chalein. Coorg ke lush green jungle aur thandi hawa mein hum dono ek doosre ke saath relaxed the, jaise sab kuch perfect ho. üòç Hum evening tak ghumte rahe, kabhi coffee plantations mein selfies lete, kabhi chhoti si waterfall ke paas baith ke baatein karte. Bhaiya kabhi kabhi meri kamar pe haath rakhte, aur main sharma ke hanste hue unka haath hata deti, ‚ÄúBhaiya, yeh kya, koi dekh lega!‚Äù üòú Woh bas naughty si smile dete aur bolte, ‚ÄúArre, meri Sheetal ke saath thodi si masti toh banta hai!‚Äù üòò

Sham ko hum dinner ke baad, around 10 baje, apne cozy cottage room mein wapas aaye. Room mein ek soft si yellow light thi, aur bahar jungle ki awaazein ek romantic vibe create kar rahi thi. üåø Bhaiya mujhe ek ajeeb, naughty si nazar se dekh rahe the, jaise unke dil mein fir se kuch shararat chal rahi ho. üòà Mujhe gudgudi si ho rahi thi, aur main sharma ke apne baalon ke saath khelne lagi. Woh kabhi kabhi mere paas aate, meri kamar ya haath ko dheere se chhune ki koshish karte, par main masti mein unka haath hata deti aur bolti, ‚ÄúBhaiya, abhi bas kijiye na!‚Äù üòú Par sach kahu, unki woh nazrein aur touch mujhe andar hi andar pagal kar rahe the.

Thodi der baad, maine bed pe lette hue ek serious tone liya aur kaha, ‚ÄúBhaiya, kal raat aapne mujhe bohot disrespect kiya. I want to talk about it.‚Äù üò£ Maine socha tha ki woh shayad defend karenge, par unhone ek soft si smile di aur mere paas aake baith gaye. Unhone dheere se meri t-shirt ke hem ko uthaya, aur apne haathon se meri pet pe pyaar se sehlane lage. üò≥ Unki ungliyan meri soft skin pe aise chal rahi thi jaise woh koi delicate saaz baja rahe ho. Fir unhone apna sir meri pet pe rakha, aur dheere dheere kisses karne lage, har kiss ke saath meri skin pe ek tingling sensation chhodte hue. üòç Maine sharma ke kaha, ‚ÄúBhaiya, yeh kya kar rahe ho? Baat karne boli thi main!‚Äù Par woh bole, ‚ÄúSheetal, tu meri pyari hai. Main tujhse baat bhi karunga, aur pyar bhi.‚Äù üòò

Woh meri t-shirt ko aur upar kiya, aur ab unki lips meri navel ke around circles bana rahi thi. Har kiss ke saath woh dheere se meri skin ko suck karte, aur main toh bas apne honthon ko kaat rahi thi, kyunki yeh feeling ekdum electric thi! üò∂ Fir unhone meri t-shirt ko poora upar kiya, aur meri bra ke upar se mere boobs ko dheere se dabaya. ‚ÄúSheetal, tu kitni sundar hai,‚Äù unhone kaha, aur fir meri bra ke hooks khol diye. üò≥ Unhone mere boobs ko apne haathon mein liya, unki ungliyan meri curves ko trace karte hue, aur fir apne lips se ek nipple ko chusna shuru kiya. üòç Har suck ke saath meri body mein ek current sa daud raha tha, aur woh kabhi tongue se tease karte, kabhi thoda sa nibble dete. Maine unke baalon mein haath daal ke unhe kareeb kheench liya, aur moan kiya, ‚ÄúBhaiya, yeh‚Ä¶ haye, yeh kya kar rahe ho!‚Äù üòò

Hum baatein bhi karte rahe, aur yeh ajeeb sa hi tha ki woh meri boobs ko pyar karte hue bhi itni normal baatein kar rahe the. üòú Unhone pucha, ‚ÄúSheetal, Bangalore mein life kaisi chal rahi hai? Office mein koi tujhe pareshan toh nahi karta?‚Äù Maine sharma ke kaha, ‚ÄúArre, bhaiya, aap yeh sab puch rahe ho aur‚Ä¶ yeh kar rahe ho!‚Äù üò≥ Woh hanste hue bole, ‚ÄúArre, meri pyari Sheetal ki life ke baare mein toh jaanana banta hai na!‚Äù Fir unhone meri ek breast ko dheere se squeeze kiya aur doosri ko apne lips se pyar karte hue kaha, ‚ÄúAur ghar pe kya chal raha hai? Mummy-papa sab thik hain?‚Äù üòç Maine hanste hue kaha, ‚ÄúHaye, bhaiya, aap ghar ki baat kar rahe ho aur meri yeh haal kar rahe ho!‚Äù Par sach kahu, unka yeh soft, caring pyar mujhe ekdum melt kar raha tha.

Woh meri boobs ko chhod hi nahi rahe the‚Äîkabhi ek ko chuste, kabhi doosre ko, aur unki tongue meri skin pe aise chal rahi thi jaise woh har inch ko taste karna chahte ho. üò∂ Unhone meri nipple pe thodi si bite di, aur maine ek chhoti si moan ke saath kaha, ‚ÄúBhaiya, aapko meri boobs mein itna kya milta hai?‚Äù üòú Woh bole, ‚ÄúSheetal, yeh toh meri duniya hain. Tu kitni soft, kitni perfect hai!‚Äù üòò Unka ek haath meri kamar pe tha, meri curves ko sehlate hue, aur doosra meri back pe, mujhe unke aur kareeb kheenchte hue. Maine sharma ke apna chehra unki chest mein chhupa liya, aur unki heartbeat feel ki.

Unhone dheere se kaha, ‚ÄúSheetal, tu meri pyari hai. Kal raat jo hua, woh galat tha, par main tujhe hamesha pyar se pyar karunga.‚Äù üòç Yeh sunke mera dil ekdum pighal gaya, aur maine kaha, ‚ÄúBhaiya, mujhe nahi pata tha aap itna pyar se bhi pyar kar sakte hain.‚Äù üòò Woh meri forehead pe ek soft kiss dete hue bole, ‚ÄúTu meri jaan hai, Sheetal. Hamesha rahegi.‚Äù Hum dono ke beech yeh moment itna intimate, itna loving tha ki main apne aap ko poori tarah se unke hawale kar chuki thi. üò∂

Us raat hum dono ek doosre ki baahon mein hi rahe, unki kisses aur touch mujhe ek alag hi sukoon de rahe the. Yeh pyar, yeh closeness‚Äîhaye, isse zyada aur kya chahiye

All of my past experiences were over five years ago, before I had my child, and they formed more naturally. I used to work in a high-end mall, so I met men in person, and we built real connections.

Back then, the men I met weren‚Äôt just generous ‚Äî they were also mentors in a way. One of them even taught me how to drive. There was respect, guidance, and genuine support. I never felt rushed or like I was being treated as disposable. That‚Äôs the kind of energy I‚Äôve been hoping to find again.

Recently I started looking again, partly because I miss the lifestyle ‚Äî but also because I honestly need the help. But so far, it‚Äôs been disappointing.

I met two older men while I was out doing DoorDash and UberEats. We exchanged numbers and started talking. The first guy kept saying ‚ÄúI got you,‚Äù but never actually followed through. He kept trying to get me to come over to his place, even though we‚Äôd only met in passing. He claimed he was generous and takes care of his women, but said he‚Äôd ‚Äúhook me up‚Äù on Saturday if I came over on Tuesday. That already felt like a red flag. Then he asked me if I had eaten that day ‚Äî I told him no, I just had coffee ‚Äî and all he said was ‚Äúoh that‚Äôs not good.‚Äù No offer to meet for food, no care ‚Äî just kept pushing for me to come to his house at 5am. I declined.

The second guy seemed a lot more put-together at first ‚Äî older, well-spoken, nicely dressed. We met in person while I was out, and he came off respectful. He said he liked to spoil women, which sounded promising. But once we started talking on the phone, he got explicit really quickly. It was disappointing. I know intimacy is part of this lifestyle, but am I wrong for feeling like that kind of energy before even meeting again or having a real conversation is just‚Ä¶ too much?

It's not just the colour and shape of the food that affects taste expectations and the experience of taste - it's also the colour and shape of the dishes.

Coffee consumed from the pink cups is perceived as sweeter, while coffee from the green or yellow cups is perceived as more acidic. Coffee in a clear glass cup may appear sweeter than when served in a white cup. A heavier cup can make the coffee seem of higher quality and with a more intense flavour.

Coffee consumed from a tulip-shaped cup is perceived as significantly more aromatic, and a cup with a narrow middle part (a split cup) is perceived as having more intense sweetness and acidity. The split cup was not to the liking of coffee amateurs, but professionals highly appreciated it.

I was just about to go for a coffee. I can't stop thinking about the textured blue cup that suits my coffee best. Do you have your own 'tasty' cup?

**Background:**¬†I'm a director based in NYC, went to one of the top film schools, and I'm currently in development on my first feature. We have well-known actors attached, solid producers, the whole nine yards. But here's the thing -¬†**no financing yet**. It's been a painfully slow process watching this project sit in development limbo.

Here's what's challenging me right now: I don't necessarily ""need"" to shoot more shorts at this point in my career, but I also don't want to just sit around waiting for the feature to get greenlit. As someone who's also a photographer, I understand the hustle, I understand the freelance grind, I get that we all need to pay rent.

But what I'm struggling to find are¬†**DPs who want to build something together.**¬†Who understand that there's currency in relationships, not just immediate paychecks. Who see the value in developing a creative partnership that could span multiple projects.

Look, I freelance too. I know the struggle. But some of the best collaborations I've seen come from people who invested in each other before the ""big break"" happened. Who were willing to experiment, take creative risks, and build something meaningful together.

**So I'm putting it out there:**¬†Are there any DPs who want to connect, build, talk shop, collaborate? Maybe work on some passion projects while we're all waiting for our ""real"" projects to materialize? If you're in NYC, even better - let's grab coffee and see if there's creative chemistry.

I'm not talking about working for free forever, but I am talking about finding people who understand that the best work comes from genuine creative partnerships, not just transactional relationships.

Anyone else feeling this way?¬†**DM me if you want to connect.**¬†Let's build something together. 

**Edit:**¬†To be clear - I'm not asking anyone to work for free indefinitely. I'm talking about finding collaborators who want to build a creative relationship that benefits everyone involved, whether that's through passion projects, spec work, or just having someone to bounce ideas off of.",0,1751630096.0,cinematography,1,0.45,False

Between crazy rent, overpriced coffee, and endless hidden fees, I had to figure out a system fast.  
  
The first few things I learned? One, avoid the big banks. Seriously. Most of them hit you with monthly maintenance fees, minimum balance requirements, and sketchy overdraft charges. As a student, that‚Äôs the last thing you need. Two, don‚Äôt underestimate how quickly little expenses add up like coffee, takeout, Ubers, all of it. And three, you need a budgeting system that actually works for your lifestyle.  
Here‚Äôs how I budget now:  
  
Set spending limits weekly, not monthly. It‚Äôs easier to manage in smaller chunks.  
Use two accounts. One for essentials (rent, groceries), and another for fun stuff. Keeps me honest.  
Automate savings. Even if it‚Äôs just $10 a week, I move money to savings automatically.  
Avoid cash where possible. It‚Äôs easier to track spending when it‚Äôs all digital.  
  
NYC is expensive, no doubt, but with the right tools and a bit of discipline, it‚Äôs manageable.

### **Chapter 3: ‚ÄúAbuela‚Äôs Hotel‚Äù**

They call it *La Esperanza Alma*, a drydock ring bolted to a repurposed mining pylon, half-submerged in fog, on the outskirts of New San Juan like a tired moon. Cargo containers converted into bunk rooms, a small canteen running off algae paste and stolen seasoning, and a chapel that doubles as the laundry room.

Abuela Lita calls it *home*.

---

The crew drags in before dawn, reactor coils wrapped in heat blankets, sweat and plague fear clinging to them heavier than the cargo. The hallway smells of boiling coffee, stale recycled air, and the salty tang of fried cod she managed to trade for last week.

‚ÄúLeave your boots at the door,‚Äù Abuela calls without turning around, stirring a dented pot on a single coil burner.

Tito peels off his boots, socks sticking to the floor, mumbling about needing new liners. Gato Gris slumps into a chair, hoodie pulled over their head, the data chip pressed flat in their palm like a talisman. Ra√∫l wipes down the drone with alcohol, careful, deliberate, like a man cleaning a weapon after a job.

Vera stands in the doorway, staring at the glow of Abuela‚Äôs tiny santo candles near the stove.

‚ÄúYou bring sickness back with you?‚Äù Abuela asks, glancing over her shoulder, eyes sharp under grey lashes.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Vera lies, or hopes it‚Äôs true. ‚ÄúWe wore masks this time. Didn‚Äôt touch them.‚Äù

Abuela nods once, adding a sprig of cilantro to the pot. ‚ÄúThen sit. You‚Äôre shaking.‚Äù

Vera realizes she is. She sits, letting the warmth of the steam hit her face, reminding her she‚Äôs alive.

They eat quietly. Salted cod, thin rice, hot broth that scrapes their throats on the way down but reminds them of mothers and kitchens and mornings that started with prayer.

‚ÄúShow me what you found,‚Äù Abuela says, ladling broth into a chipped cup for herself.

Gato hesitates, then slides the data chip across the table. It lands softly, a tiny weight that feels like it could crack the table in half.

Abuela studies it, thumb brushing over the TGC mark. She doesn‚Äôt flinch.

‚ÄúSolar siphon governor,‚Äù she says softly. ‚ÄúTGC doesn‚Äôt lose these. They kill for them.‚Äù

Ra√∫l‚Äôs jaw tightens. Tito leans back, exhaling, eyes darting toward the door as if expecting black-armored collectors to kick it in.

‚ÄúWe can fence the coils,‚Äù Vera says. ‚ÄúPay the debts, stock the hotel for the spring, set aside for the next lean year. But this‚Äî‚Äù

She doesn‚Äôt finish. They all know the choice.

Sell it to the highest bidder and risk TGC‚Äôs quiet wrath. Or give it to the Church and invite the Monarchy‚Äôs entanglement. Or dump it in deep space, pretend they never saw it, and live with the hunger and debts still gnawing at their lives.

Abuela takes a cautious sip of broth.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll keep it here for now,‚Äù she says, sliding it into a hidden pocket under her apron, next to a rosary and a small, silent pistol. ‚ÄúYou need rest. And you need to pray on what you are willing to pay for freedom.‚Äù

Outside the window, dawn crests over New San Juan‚Äôs horizon, pale light breaking through a thin smog of industrial haze. A cargo skiff passes, children laughing on the upper rail, chasing each other while mothers scold them in the same breath they use to barter for fish.

Life goes on, even when the weight of empire and rebellion hangs in the air.

Vera breathes out, shoulders lowering.

Tomorrow, they will decide.

[Rare earths pave the green road to militarization - Taipei Times](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2025/07/04/2003839702)

It is an irony that the minerals needed to save the planet might help destroy it. Rare earths, the mineral backbones of wind turbines and electric vehicles, are now the prize in a geopolitical arms race. The trade agreement between Washington and Beijing restores rare earth shipments from China to the US, which had been suspended in retaliation against US President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs.

Behind the bluster, there has been a realization in Washington that these are critical inputs for the US. They are needed not just by US icons such as Ford and Boeing, but for its fighter jets, missile guidance systems and satellite communications.

This understanding suggests that Washington would scale back some of its countermeasures once Beijing resumes delivery of rare earths. The paradox is that to reduce its dependence on China, the US must depend on Beijing a little longer. This is not yet decoupling; it is deferment.

However, that might not last. Trump has signed an executive order to boost production of critical minerals, which encourages the faster granting of permits for mining and processing projects. He eyes Ukraine‚Äôs and Greenland‚Äôs subterranean riches to break dependence on China.

The West became so reliant on a single geopolitical rival for such materials ‚Äî materials it once extracted and refined domestically before shuttering operations ‚Äî due to cost and environmental concerns.

China, for its part, has come to dominate global rare earth processing. It has used that market power before ‚Äî notably against Japan in 2010. It is hard not to think that it was strategic complacency that led to the West relying so heavily on China for key minerals.

Last month‚Äôs NATO summit has seen the West push to reindustrialize via rearming itself. This is also reawakening long-dormant extractive ambitions in the global north.

Canada, flush with critical mineral deposits, says its planned mining resurgence would be a new foundation for alliance solidarity. Last month, the EU called for strategic reserves of rare earths ‚Äúto prevent supply chain disruptions and economic blackmail from China‚Äù ‚Äî highlighting their importance not just for electric vehicles, but for the defense and aerospace industries. ‚ÄúResilience‚Äù means digging deeper at home and controlling extraction abroad.

The same minerals we need for net zero are being justified in terms of zero-sum rivalry. It is uncomfortable that ‚Äúgreen growth‚Äù and militarism have merged into a single policy frame, collapsing the distinction between ecological transition and arms buildup. A magnet for an electric car is also a magnet for a hypersonic missile. Meanwhile, the human and ecological toll continues to rise ‚Äî largely out of sight and out of sync with the idea of environmental sustainability.

A Guardian dispatch last week from Baotou, China‚Äôs rare earth capital, found evidence of toxic ponds, poisoned soil and demolished ‚Äúcancer villages‚Äù ‚Äî the hidden cost of our digital and electric age. Framing this as an inconvenient necessity risks repeating past mistakes. For mineral-rich nations, the surge in global demand brings opportunity.

However, as a UN report this year noted, without strong institutions and safeguards, it risks a familiar fate: corruption, conflict and environmental ruin.

Today‚Äôs scramble for critical minerals must not see the promises of responsible sourcing give way to a familiar logic ‚Äî extract first, moralize later.

# JULY 3rd, 2025~U.S., Europe push to build critical minerals supply chains as China dominates

[Investing.com](http://Investing.com) \-- As China continues to dominate global mining and refining of critical raw materials (CRMs), the U.S. and Europe are stepping up efforts to bolster their own supply chains, analysts at Barclays highlighted in a note Thursday.

‚ÄúAlthough China is the key player in CRM mining and refining, we see Europe and the US adopting initiatives to strengthen domestic CRM chains,‚Äù Barclays analysts wrote.

Driven not just by the green energy transition but also by surging demand from artificial intelligence and defense sectors, critical mineral supply chains are said to be facing pressure from global trade tensions, tariffs, and export controls.¬†

‚ÄúPowering AI and bolstering defence are two factors further boosting demand for critical raw materials,‚Äù said Barclays.

**In response, Western governments are pursuing three main strategies: substitution, domestic production, and recycling.**

On substitution, Barclays highlighted that ‚Äúcopper and nickel emerge as key materials due to their CRM substitutability,‚Äù with growing interest in next-generation materials.

On the production front, both the U.S. and Europe are fast-tracking domestic mining projects.¬†

***‚ÄúEurope and the US fast track local mining projects, benefiting mining equipment companies,‚Äù Barclays noted, adding that ‚Äúdeep sea mining emerges as a thematic wildcard.‚Äù***

**Recycling is also said to be gaining new attention, particularly around rare earth metals, as recycling of EV batteries lags. ‚ÄúAttention turns to rare earth metals given EV battery recycling slump,‚Äù the report stated.**

Barclays updated its CRM company landscape to include around 60 listed companies focused on substitution, exploration, or recycling.¬†New additions include mining equipment providers Epiroc and Sandvik.

# JULY 2nd, 2025~(MARK SMITH)China Has The Pentagon Over A Barrel, But Trump Can Stop It  (Mark Smith...continues to ""tell it like it is!"")

[China Has The Pentagon Over A Barrel, But Trump Can Stop It | The Daily Caller](https://dailycaller.com/2025/07/02/china-pentagon-trump-taiwan-defense-military/)

https://preview.redd.it/72csa73m2uaf1.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&s=b323da785cda31101ef23aee5ed2fc061388f5ac

President Trump and his team recently negotiated a ‚Äúfast track‚Äù deal on Chinese rare earth exports for use in products like automobiles, factory automation and robotics, wind turbines, and other durable goods. That action has helped to forestall more production slowdowns or work stoppages at several major Western automakers, at least for now. Tens of thousands of U.S. workers and their families will be able to better enjoy the upcoming July 4^(th)¬†holiday.

But all indications are that heavy rare earths like dysprosium and terbium ‚Äì elements that enable precision-guided missiles, jet fighters, and radar systems ‚Äì remain quietly bottled up in China‚Äôs new export control bureaucracy. Not surprisingly, reports are that the Chinese military is now playing an active role in identifying and blocking rare earths in both China‚Äôs new export license process and even at shipping ports.¬†

***I have served in the rare earth industry for nearly 30 years. I have seen virtually everything China does to maintain its hegemony over this industry. It comes as no surprise to me that the Chinese military wants to throw a monkey wrench in U.S. and allied defense supply chains. By targeting heavy rare earths destined for ‚Äúdual-use‚Äù technologies ‚Äì serving either¬†civilian and/or defense¬†applications¬†‚Äì they¬†can¬†slow or kill such export licenses¬†and still claim to be following the law.***

This is happening at the very moment when the U.S. Department of Defense and allies such as Israel are in urgent need of restocking smart¬†bombs, missiles,¬†air defense systems,¬†and other¬†armaments. Each of the guided missiles we have seen arcing in the night sky recently rely on permanent magnets made with heavy rare earths. When inventories dwindle and these materials become unavailable, entire weapons supply chains grind to a halt.

The bottom line:¬†[China](https://dailycaller.com/2025/04/14/china-vietnam-sign-dozens-of-new-deals-strengthening-ties-as-trump-works-to-renegotiate-trade/)¬†is in a position to directly throttle U.S. military operations. Without a reliable supply of these elements, at some point, the¬†[Pentagon](https://dailycaller.com/2025/07/02/pentagon-demands-billions-for-missile-defense-as-trump-pushes-revolutionary-golden-dome/)¬†cannot replace what it fires.

This is not a hypothetical threat. China accounts for more than 99% of the global supply of separated dysprosium and terbium, both of which are essential for producing the high-temperature permanent magnets used in control surface actuators, seeker heads, radar arrays, and electric propulsion systems. These are not interchangeable materials. There are no proven, scalable substitutes¬†for these elements¬†that can meet performance requirements for defense platforms like the F-35, Aegis destroyers, or advanced missile systems.¬†

While some in Washington hope that commercial markets will fill the gap, the truth is they can‚Äôt. Few civilian magnet manufacturers operate under defense-rated specifications, and they depend on Chinese feedstock themselves. Even the most advanced rare earth companies in the West still ship some of their mined material to China for separation and processing. Beijing knows this. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre deliberately dividing the rare earth trade into ‚Äúcivilian‚Äù and ‚Äúmilitary‚Äù lanes ‚Äî and enforcing a chokehold on the latter.¬†

Washington must stop assuming that economic interdependence will serve as a guardrail against escalation aimed at U.S. defense supply chains. Clearly, China has no intention of allowing its economic leverage to go unused. Rare earths are no longer just a trade commodity ‚Äî they are a geopolitical weapon.

# What should the U.S. do?

***As President Trump understands all too well, we need a whole-of-government response to build a fully domestic supply chain for heavy rare earth elements and the magnets that rely on them. That means identifying, funding, and fast-tracking the small number of fully permitted projects that can begin mining and processing these materials on U.S. soil within the next several years.***

***The cold, hard truth is that there is only one greenfield project in the U.S. that is fully permitted for construction, is staffed by experienced rare earth separations personnel, and can get online to produce the heavy rare earths dysprosium and terbium in only 36 months from financing ‚Äì possibly faster. For purposes of full disclosure, I am the CEO of the company developing this project, known as the Elk Creek Critical Minerals Project in Nebraska.***

***But my point is that the U.S. needs at least a dozen such projects brought online in the U.S. as rapidly as possible. Only then can we establish a position of relative independence from China for these defense-critical materials.***

***More than any previous Commander in Chief, President Trump understands the strategic importance of rare earth elements. That is why he is taking aggressive steps in the right direction. The Pentagon is funding magnet manufacturing under Title III of the Defense Production Act. It is finalizing funding for new integrated mining and processing facilities, such as the Elk Creek Project. Congress appears poised to provide several billion dollars to encourage greater domestic critical minerals production and to enable the National Defense Stockpile to enter into forward purchase contracts for these critical materials.***

***A new Presidential Memorandum issued this week will implement a revolutionary concept: the development of a common application for federal funding opportunities for critical minerals projects, and the establishment of a single portal to allow applicants to apply to multiple funding programs. This will make federal funding more efficient. It should also allow faster and more strategic investment decisions to be made across the energy and mineral sectors.***

***The United States once led the world in rare earth production. We can do so again. But the clock is ticking. China‚Äôs message is now clear: It will not allow its strategic materials to flow to U.S. defense contractors without very tight conditions. As tensions over Taiwan,***¬†[***AI chips***](https://dailycaller.com/2025/04/14/nvidia-supercomputers-made-in-us/)***, and naval activity in the Pacific intensify, we should expect that leverage to be used again and again.***

# ~GIVEN RECENT PASSING OF RECONCILATION BILL~

Here‚Äôs a **""SPECULATIIVE""** **summary and impact chart** of the final reconciliation bill as it relates to **NioCorp** and its strategic interests in critical minerals, domestic processing, DOE funding, and industrial base support. This includes both **positive (good)** and **negative (bad/neutral)** elements based on the reconciliation bill finalized by Congress and expected to be signed by President Trump.

# üü© Good for NioCorp

|Provision|Description|Strategic Benefit to NioCorp|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**SASC Critical Minerals Funding**|$2B to National Defense Stockpile Transaction Fund; $5B for Industrial Base Fund investments|**Directly supports U.S. domestic supply chain buildout. NioCorp (Nb, Sc, Ti, REEs) is well-positioned as a critical minerals producer.**|
|**$500M DoD Credit Program**|Capital assistance for critical minerals & related technologies|**NioCorp may access low-cost financing for Elk Creek buildout and processing infrastructure.**|
|**DOE Critical Materials RFI (2026)**|RFI on strategic critical materials, due July 25|Opens pathway for NioCorp to shape DOE‚Äôs 2026 Critical Materials List (e.g., Scandium, Ti, Nb).|
|**IRA 45X Manufacturing Credit (Phasedown but retained)**|Credit gradually phases out through 2033; retains support for most components|Still offers some medium-term support for NioCorp‚Äôs downstream processing (e.g. alloy development, magnet materials).|
|**NEVI Program Injunction Granted**|Judge unfreezes funding for EV charger infrastructure in 13 states|Indirect benefit‚ÄîEV infrastructure boosts demand for rare earth magnets and related inputs.|
|**$15M in New DOE Energy Storage Projects**|DOE awards for resilient grid energy storage projects|May create downstream demand for materials like niobium (used in next-gen battery R&D).|

# üü• Bad or Neutral for NioCorp

|Provision|Description|Potential Impact on NioCorp|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**DOE Budget Cuts (FY2026)**|26% cut to non-defense energy programs, 58% LPO staff reduction, 95% OCED cut|Major delays expected in funding processing, permitting, and DOE support programs relevant to NioCorp.|
|**Termination of IRA Clean Energy Programs**|Most tax credits and support programs (solar, wind, hydrogen) end by end of 2025 or 2026|Could slow demand for clean tech inputs (e.g. scandium in fuel cells, rare earths in wind turbines).|
|**No Permanent 45X Credit for Critical Minerals**|Credit for critical minerals (e.g. Nb, Sc) phased down starting 2031, gone by 2034|Undermines long-term stability of domestic mineral processing incentives.|
|**Excise Tax on Chinese-linked Components (Wind/Solar)**|Could deter clean energy investment; potential chilling effect on renewables|Indirectly slows demand for REE-based systems (e.g., NdPr magnets), though NioCorp benefits if U.S. sources are preferred.|
|**Land Sale Provisions (ENR)**|Limits BLM land sales; doesn't impact Elk Creek directly|Neutral‚Äîdoesn't affect project directly but may stall broader Western infrastructure opportunities.|
|**GDO and EERE Cuts**|63% and 45% staffing cuts, 74% budget cuts|EERE support for scandium-aluminum and clean energy integration (e.g. grid modernization) curtailed.|
|**Office of Technology Transitions Eliminated**|Moves commercialization programs under reduced budget|Reduces support for tech deployment and market access‚Äîhurts transition from lab to commercial scale.|

# üü® Open/Watch Areas

|Provision|Description|Relevance|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Hydrogen Credit Extended to 2028 (45V)**|Could help longer term if NioCorp alloys support hydrogen systems|Indirect benefit for scandium-aluminum and fuel cell tech.|
|**Public Land Sales Debated (ENR)**|BLM land sales restricted; parliamentarian review ongoing|Watch for future permitting or mining access implications.|
|**FOR SALE Act ‚Äì HQ Sell-offs**|DOE HQ (Forrestal) and other federal buildings targeted for sale|Signals further federal agency downsizing; could increase uncertainty for applicants to DOE.|
|**EV Tax Credits Eliminated, but No Federal EV Fee Added**|Credits phased out, fees dropped|Neutral for NioCorp, as EV magnet demand is still strong via market forces.|
|**Tailpipe Emissions Rollbacks Dropped**|Language to rescind Biden-era standards removed|Preserves market pressure for cleaner tech, indirectly supporting REE/magnet demand.|

# üìå Final Assessment for NioCorp:

‚úÖ **Strong Tailwinds:**

* $7.5B in DoD and Industrial Base support tied to critical minerals.
* Continued recognition of Sc, Nb, Ti, REEs in supply chain security.
* DOE RFI opens a chance to shape 2026 strategic material designations.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Key Risks:**

* Significant staff and program cuts at DOE (esp. LPO, EERE, OCED).
* Uncertainty in DOE-administered grants/timelines.
* Loss of long-term policy certainty from phased-out 45X credits and tech commercialization offices.

*(\*\*\*Some stuff has been reconfigured, but overall looks positive for NioCorp imho...  Form your own conclusions of course!\*\*\*)*

Without looking at the comments, can you provide translations for these short (**but challenging!**) sentences (3 English-Italian, 3 Italian-English)? I‚Äôll evaluate your responses and give you feedback. The exercise is designed to be intermediate/advanced level, but beginners and lower intermediate learners are welcome if they feel like testing the scope of their current knowledge. *I might take a few days to answer* (usually up to around a week if there‚Äôs high participation) but I will read and evaluate all participants.

If you‚Äôre not sure about a particular translation, just go with it! The exercise is meant to weed out mistakes, this is not a school test!  
**If multiple translations are possible, choose the one you believe to be more likely give the limited context** (I won‚Äôt deduct points for guessing missing information, for example someone's gender, unless it's heavily implied in the sentence).

**There is no time limit to submit your answer**. If you want to go back to the first ever edition and work your way up from there, you can. Just know that I usually prioritise later posts.

**THE TEST**

Here are the sentences, *vaguely* ranked from easiest to hardest in each section (A: English-Italian, B: Italian-English).

**A1)** ""Let‚Äôs just go ourselves, then""  
**A2)** ""Here comes the sun""  
**A3)** ""All three of them were jumped in a dark alleyway""  

**B1)** ‚ÄúNon √® che me ne prenderesti tre?‚Äù  
**B2)** ‚ÄúCon chi credete di avere a che fare?‚Äù  
**B3)** ‚ÄúSe non altro si √® rimesso a studiare, finalmente‚Äù  

**Current average**: N/A (median N/A)

**EVALUATION (and how to opt out)**

If you manage to provide a translation for all 6 I'll give you a score from 1 to 10 (the standard evaluation system in Italian schools). Whatever score you receive, don't take it too seriously: this is just a game! However, if you feel like receiving a score is too much pressure anyway, you can just tell me at the start of your comment and I'll only correct your mistakes.

Based on the results so far, here‚Äôs the usual range of votes depending on the level of the participants. Ideally, your objective is to score within your personal range or possibly higher:

**Absolute beginners**: ‚â§4  
**Beginners**: 4 - 5  
**Early intermediate**: 5 - 6.5  
**Advanced intermediate**: 6.5 - 8  
**Advanced**: ‚â•8  
**Natives**: ‚â•9 (with good English)  
*Note: the specific range might change a lot depending on the difficulty of this specific exercise. I try to be consistent, but it‚Äôs very hard*

**TO SUPPORT ME**

Since I've been asked a couple of times by now, I've recently set up a [Ko-Fi page](https://ko-fi.com/crown85469). If you appreciate what I do and want to offer me a coffee as thanks, feel free to do so. **Only** donate if you have money to throw away: I'm doing this because I like it, any money I get from it is just an extra bonus and I won't treat people differently based on whether they decide to donate or not, it really doesn't matter to me.

You can still participate if you want (the exercise is theoretically symmetrical between Italian and English), but please keep in mind that these sentences are designed to be particularly challenging for *non* native speakers, so they might be easier for you. For this reason, I‚Äôd prefer it if you specified that you are a native speaker at the beginning of your comment: I‚Äôm collecting statistics on how well learners score on these tests in order to fine tune them (and personal curiosity), so mixing up the results from natives and non-natives will probably mess it up.

I met this girl last year.
From our very first video call she refused to show her face (‚Äúmy hair‚Äôs a mess!‚Äù) and most chats felt one-sided, but I pushed on because she seemed sweet.

She‚Äôd plan a walk in the park, then cancel because of a ‚Äúleg injury.‚Äù
When I was mugged and almost lost her number, she barely reacted said she‚Äôd only text if I texted first.
She told me horror stories about an ex who ‚Äútraded her in.‚Äù
At the movies she suddenly asked, ‚ÄúMaybe we should just be friends?‚Äù then spent the whole film kissing me.
She hid her phone like it was a state secret and refused to share Instagram until after we broke up.(After the breakup, he gave me his Instagram)
She never wanted me anywhere near her family.

At a friend‚Äôs party she introduced me as her boyfriend‚Ä¶ then blurted, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs download a dating app and find you a hotter girl!‚Äù(A few minutes later)

After that whiplash I called it quits. She sobbed, blocked me, and claimed I‚Äôd ‚Äústolen her happiness.‚Äù Two days later she unblocked me to say she missed me. While we talked I spotted her active on a dating app; she swore she was ‚Äújust helping a friend.‚Äù

I told her I still loved her. She invited me to her mom‚Äôs birthday, then flip-flopped, then her mom phoned asking if I loved her daughter. (My mother called me again asking me to have coffee there)Next, I‚Äôm told her dad‚Äôs furious with me, and my ex sends a final message: I ‚Äúused‚Äù her and I‚Äôm blocked again.(sorry but this still affects me, I'm very sick)

1lrgnqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/1lrgnqe/got_the_p_despite_low_nbmes/,Got the P despite Low NBMES,"Hello everyone,

I want to preface this by saying: no matter what your practice scores are, *you must feel confident and ready* before taking Step 1. At some point during your dedicated, you'll feel a sense of calm and trust in your test-taking abilities. You‚Äôll realize that while you don‚Äôt know *everything*, you know *enough*, and that‚Äôs what matters. During my dedicated period, I often came to this subreddit to read encouraging posts from people who passed despite lower scores. Today, I want to return the favor.

I studied for Step 1 over three months and delayed my rotations. I simply wasn‚Äôt ready earlier. My knowledge base was weak. If you‚Äôre in the same boat and your school allows, *do not be afraid to delay* your exam, especially if you can still graduate on time. Aim to score consistently in the 60s on NBMEs. This gives you at least an 80% chance of passing. Here are my scores (not taken in order):

* **Form 29** ‚Äì 46
* **Form 28** ‚Äì 44
* **Form 27** ‚Äì 54
* **Form 26** ‚Äì 61
* **Form 30** ‚Äì 60
* **Form 31** ‚Äì 64
* **Free 120** ‚Äì 64

As you can see, I never hit a 65. But that 64 on Form 31 gave me a 92% probability of passing, and I was *consistently in the 60s* for two weeks. That consistency is what mattered most. It meant I was understanding core NBME concepts and getting the majority right. By the end, I was burned out and had changed my exam date multiple times. But once I scored the same on Form 31 and the Free 120 (despite the format difference), I felt a sense of serenity. I *knew* I was ready. 

I won‚Äôt sugarcoat it. Step 1 was tough. I didn‚Äôt know everything, and I definitely saw some of my weaker areas. But I stayed calm, took every break, drank coffee, and kept pushing. I had around 15 to 20 minutes left per block to review flagged questions. The two days after the exam were hard. I kept remembering questions I got wrong and was convinced I failed. But eventually I realized there was no point in torturing myself over what was already done. And this week, I got my P. Thank God.

# What Helped Me Pass:

**1. NBME Forms 26‚Äì31**  
Do all of them, and review thoroughly. Create a Google Doc or spreadsheet of key takeaways. These patterns *will* show up on your exam, just reworded. If you can‚Äôt review all thoroughly, focus on Forms 30 and 31.

**2. Free 120**  
By far the most *representative*. Do this close to your exam.

**3. Pathoma**  
I watched most of it. I only watched Chapter 1 out of the ‚Äúfamous‚Äù Chapters 1‚Äì3, and that was enough. Heme/Onc is a must. Watching Pathoma and doing 40 to 80 UWorld questions per organ system helped me jump from the 40s to the 50s. Side note about UWORLD: I only completed around 50% of the QBank. I used it mainly to learn content alongside Pathoma. I focused most of my effort on NBME material.

**4. Dirty Medicine**  
His concise videos are gold, especially for Pharm. I found Renal, GI, and Neuro particularly helpful.

**5. Mehlman Medical (lifesaver)**

* *HY Arrows*: Do these to master physiology.
* *HY Immuno and Path PDFs*: Must-do. I did most of his PDFs but these are really necessary.
* *YouTube Qbanks*: Absolutely game-changing. I listened at 2x speed, paused to try answering, and jotted quick notes. If you can get through 25 to 50 questions per organ system, you‚Äôll absorb high-yield buzzwords and refine test-taking strategies. I owe a lot to these videos.

The most important thing is to be *adaptable*. If your scores aren‚Äôt improving, change your methods. If you‚Äôre in the 40s, you likely need to go back to basics and rebuild your foundation.

Trust yourself. Be kind to yourself. And when you‚Äôre ready, you‚Äôll *feel* it.

About three years ago I got rid of my SIBO. It took about two years to do it, and a LOT of trial and error.A lot.I've avoided posting for a while because in my experience any time I do it ends up with a lot of debate and arguments, and just to be perfectly honest that's not what I'm here for.I assume most people who get rid of SIBO leave these boards and likely don't come back, job done. As a result, a lot of the help is from people who still have it, or have 'done the research', or are trying to find people to come to their clinic (seen a lot of this lately, including a TCM practitioner who is using this board to find clients which is sketchy af) 

Not ideal. You need something that has worked. Not should work in theory.

The other thing I run into is a lot of questioning the rationale or attempts at retailoring/adjusting. This is a relatively new diagnosis. It is not an exact science. What works for one person may or may not work for another. My honest is, find a system that worked for someone, and try that. Don't reinvent it. Don't armchair expert it. Do what worked, or at least try it. And then if it doesn't work, abandon it.

I once had the best chocolate chip cookie I've ever had at a party once, I asked the woman what her secret was. She said 'I follow the instructions on the box exactly to the measure. Why would I think I know more than the cookie people?'

I'm definitely not the cookie people. But I do have a method, it took a lot of work to get right. And I believe it needs to be done just right to work. I hope that it will work for you. Just to avoid argument I'll likely be muting replies on this at some point. But If you DO try it out, and need help, please feel free to DM me. All I ask that you try it this way first.

1: You need to get the mechanics right first. Before you can kill it. This is the most important single aspect of beating SIBO. If you start at part 2, you it won't work, because your sibo is coming back at the same time you're killing it.

What I'm going to try to get you to do is hyperdigest food. So much so that food goes through you easier and faster. We're not trying to isolate a specific issue. We're going to put your whole digestion into overdrive. Motility gets a lot of attention, but if food isn't digested well, it will move slower. The two go hand in hand.

This is primarily for Hydrogen, but it should work for the most part for methane. Methane is tougher, but this SHOULD make everything else easier once you've done it consistently for about a month.

I want you to get these EXACT brands.

1: Power Digest by Wholesome Health. This takes the place of like 7 other supplements I tried. It literally mimics digestion. Top to bottom. It is phased so it digests the way your body is supposed to, almost like an exogenous digestion. It's incredibly helpful. Take TWO with each meal or snak. As soon as you eat.They don't as of now offer international shipping, and the company is super tiny, but I bet if you ask them they would do it.

2:  Spectrazyme Pancreatin 9x ES 1 with meals: the only downside to Power Digest is the pancreatic enzymes aren't enough. This stuff is like baby creon, it's pretty powerful and hits right when your body needs it.

3:   Benfotiamine 150-250mg- 1 with meals: Increases motility, gastric acid, it does a lot. If you get tired the first time you take it, don't worry it will go away. Other forms of Thiamine work too, but Benfo just happens to be my favorite.

4: Zinc. Ideally liposomal 50mg- once per day. Codeage is a good brand. Low Zinc correlates to low gastric acid. 

5: Motegrity/Plucaloopride or Pyrodistimine if you have it. Take it how is best for you, some people find motegrity best 3-4 hours after eating. Some people right after. If you can't get either, and Artichoke/Ginger supplement like Gut Motility can help a lot, but it may run out of it's efficacy long term. The others should still help a lot, so hopefully this is just getting you from an 7/8 to a 9/10.

Try that, as written, on it's own for two weeks before adding any of the next pieces. Your SIBO will not go away. But keep very clear notes of whether you digestion gets even slightly easier.

If not, lets add based on your experience:

A: You feel like food is still getting 'stuck' and you're constipated.

Add Fibercon. This is not just another Fiber, it can't feed bacteria, and it will help get fluid into your intestines. So, it should make things easier to pass.

B: You still don't feel like you're able to digest... at all. Likely you have a bit of dysbiosis, you probably did a kill phase at some point, or an antibiotic that left you not feeling great. Get Kefirlabs Coconut Kefir, have about a third of a bottle after each meal. If it makes things worse, drop it right away. This is a 50/50 split- works great for some, not for others. 

C: You still can't eat some stuff.You can't go spend your life avoiding foods. If your car doesn't turn left, you don't just never take left turns. You take it to the mechanic and get it fixed. Based on which foods bother you most, go to Intoleran.com and try to find the one the works for you. Alternatively, Fodmate works great for many people in doing all of them.

D: You're getting gassy symptoms:Take Atrantil whenever you get symptoms. It will say to take it when you eat, just take it as needed, two at a time. This stuff is magic for gas.

If you're still having trouble, try adding another from the A/B/C/D category, it's tough to exactly line up symptoms to treatments. But try to stick to these temporarily.

E: You've tried ABCD exactly as suggested and they are just not doing it.Can you get pyrodistigmine or motegrity and add them in? If so, do it. If not, I may not have an answer for you. I deeply apologize. 

F: One last thing that helped me a lot: Intoleran's Starchway. I take one before bed and it feels like my gut goes into overdrive. Can't explain it for the life of me, but try it!

I would also HIGHLY recommend not eating within 4 hours of going to bed.

Now, likely you have ideally some improvement when you eat. Sibo is still there, but you have less difficulty when eating. (I hope, I got like a 70% hit ratio at this point. Ideally you're in the 70.) If you're not here, don't move to kill. I'm telling you it won't work. I would bet a lot of people reading have actually figured out their kill but because the mechanics are off, the SIBO is actually coming back at the same time they're killing it. If you haven't gotten your mechanics right, it will likely come back soon after or worse, it won't even feel like it's gone.

THE KILL:

1: The first thing I would try is EPC's Sustained Release Dehydroberberine.

The slow release makes it kill slowly and over time. It's powerful but it just stays in your system killing over and over. It's great stuff. It's not just berberine, it's the sustained release aspect that makes it so potent, I've yet to see another supplement work that way.

2: Next up: Xifaxin + NAC. Taking 1000mg of NAC each time you take Xifaxin makes it like crazy potent, at least for me. Cedars recommends this protocol as well, so there's def rationale behind it.

3: You're gonna tell me I'm crazy, but if you're getting here and you still aren't having success, try Kefir Labs Coconut Kefir- the amount of good bacteria in there can just wipe out the bad. It helps me on the rare occasion I get a flare up (normally I only get them if I eat super late before bed.) It's worked for a few people on these threads.

Lastly, there are the more extreme methods:

A: If you're open to it, Antibiotics will likely work. My two favorites are Alinia and Cipro. Alinia is a lot of things at once, but it's antibiotic qualities seem to be perfect for most SIBO. Cipro gets a lot of haters. Obviously talk to your doctor first, and you will need to to get it prescribed anyways. Yes, It has red label warnings, but then again so does Tylenol. It's frequently prescribed at hospitals and generally considered fairly safe except for those with tendon issues among older people. I suggest you decide for yourself by visiting the floxxies thread on Reddit if you're on the fence. You'll likely notice the lack of consistency in the symptoms people claim to have. I don't agree with the hate but again I don't want to argue, but  if you're really concerned about it Just Don't Take It. (easy enough!)

B: Just do the Elemental Diet. It works. Nearly every time. The thing is, you HAVE to have your mechanics figured out first. It takes a LONG FUCKING TIME, and it is awful. People say 2 weeks, I say it's more like three for most people to see success. You got to stick to it. The worst would be to go through all that and not have your mechanics figured out and have to do it again, so focus on that first and foremost. Oh, and you can have coffee. It's kind of the one little cheat. And if you get a decent tasting Elemental, you can put a little in your coffee too and it's kinda like sweet and low.

BEST OF LUCK. Feel free to hit me up if you need any guidance, all I ask is do part 1 first.

1lrgmre,https://www.reddit.com/r/AfterTheEndFanFork/comments/1lrgmre/the_battle_of_franca_summer_fanfiction_writing/,The Battle of Franca [Summer Fanfiction Writing Contest],"Zez√© gradually regained consciousness. Everything hurt. He couldn't remember how he'd got here. Actually, come to think of it, where was ""here"" anyway? He tried to think as the room failed to come into focus. What had he done and why was it so dark? It didn't feel like night, at least.

No, no, probably not, he decided. He certainly didn't remember drinking particularly heavily last night. He looked around again, trying to figure out where he was, when he heard the rattling of... something. A bolt shifting? It was then that he realized where he was, and why he couldn't see, and a pit began forming in his stomach. He was in a building. Not one of the temporary ones along the routes his people traveled across Mato Grosso to graze their livestock, but a more permanent, large, well-built one. Then he remembered, he remembered going off-road, to avoid detection by imperial patrols so as to set up an ambush to obliterate the little of the Imperial Army of Pedro that was around the city of Franca, crossing the misleadingly named Rio Grande river (He had thought it quite narrow, not Grande at all), the blood and fighting, the joyous scattering of the baggage train and troops barely in formation as he launched the surprise attack on a division of the Imperial Army and broke it, and then suddenly the entire rest of the army had shown up from behind a great hill, and it had all started to fall apart, and his favorite war mare, who he'd rode into battle on, had been lamed by an arrow, and fell, and he was thrown... no. His troops had to have rallied, they had brought him into the captured town to recover, they had to have... As the door opened, his fears were confirmed, as a man entered and bowed deeply and insincerely.

""So this is the Great Lord of the Cerrado, the King of Mato Grosso, Benevolent Protector of Bras√≠lia, Guarantor of the lands and peoples of the Chaco, Butcher of Tri√¢ngulo! And he deigns to visit my prison, that of a humble *Coronel* in service to the also very humble *Capit√£-General* of Sudiminas, in service to the Magnanimous Emperor of Brasil (long may he reign)! It is rare to have such an honor!""

The voice was mocking, and spoke with a thick accent he vaguely recognized as typical of the Capiau people... or perhaps Caipira? He did not recognize the source of the voice, a man both tall and fat, dressed in an immaculate coat of mail with a fine silk scarf and overcoat, marking him as a man of some status, though the silk had clearly been stained, and despite attempts to conceal, those stains were visible still, marking that status as quite limited (if he could indeed truly not afford a replacement.) Some minor governor of Brasil, if his words were to be believed... did a *Coronel* govern? Zez√© had never been able to keep the infinite gradations of the politics and responsibilities of his decadent neighbors straight. He had never needed to learn, after all. They were corrupt and weak, always fighting among themselves, and leaving their rich lands ripe for the taking. All that had mattered was they had an Emperor, Pedro the somethingth, who would soon be paying tribute to the Great Lord of the Cerrado, Zez√© Pena Branca, like everyone else who's lands touched Cerrado (and many in Gran Chaco too). In retrospect, of course, that may have been a fatal error, though not one anyone could have predicted. Brasil had been in steady decline for decades, perhaps centuries, after all, and had been at war with itself for yet another time as he had launched his invasion. There was no reason to expect them to successfully defeat his host, much less capture him. The Battle of Franca would go down in history as an unpredictable tragedy, the one time the armies of Brasil united against a foe instead of fighting amongst each other, he consoled himself with that.

The *Coronel* continued to talk. ""Nonetheless, your grace, I am sure you must be departing soon, you must get ready! The Emperor, (long may he reign), will want to take you to Rio de Janeiro personally, to cement his many recent triumphs. You will be the highlight of his parade, and then, perhaps, you will be released conditional on not attacking us again... Likely paying heavy tribute to us all, of course, but that is his negotiation... though, I am sorry, your grace, but I cannot imagine what you could provide us in tribute that we don't have already. But it is not my place to negotiate for our Magnanimous Emperor... (long may he reign). He will be here tomorrow, or perhaps the next day, and you will be out of my hands. He is making great haste to be here, your magnificence, after an arduous conflict against a destabilizing element within our Great Nation.""

King Zez√© spat.There were no words for the level of contempt he felt for this ridiculous man who dared mock a king such as he. He had lost the war, yes, but he had dignity still, the dignity of royalty! He was the rightful ruler of the Cerrado and Pantanal both, he was a name renowned across South America, and this *Coronel*, this*\*bureaucrat\**of no fame and no glory, positively dripping with false humility governed... did he even govern? Only with consent of those above him, if he governed at all. How dare he! And worse, the Coward Emperor Pedro hadn't even bothered to lead the armies of Brasil himself! Such weakness was an insult to the All-Father, and, in all likelihood, to the decadent pagan gods they worshiped in Brasil's cities. The spit globule missed the *Coronel* and landed harmlessly on the dirt floor. The Coronel just laughed and left.

The next day, Zez√© was given nothing but dark bread and water for sustenance. Another insult on the list of mistreatments he had suffered at the hands of the Empire of Brasil, and one that would be avenged one day. As he grudgingly ate, he heard a great fanfare outside the building, even through the thick walls, and two finely dressed soldiers entered his cell and forced him to his feet. These he recognized as Pracinhas by the emblem of the smoking snake on their tabards, the proud expeditionary forces of the Empire of Brasil. They hauled him roughly outside, and brought him to a room where he was dressed and made ""presentable"" by the standards of the Empire, cleaning him up, putting makeup over his many bruises, scrapes, and cuts to hide them, and dressed him in clothes of fine green silk.An interpreter was provided for him, a finely-dressed Veredista man twenty years his junior named Manoel. His mail, apparently taken from him after his capture at the Great Battle of Franca, was not returned to him. Yet another insult, he thought, as he was brought before the Emperor.

The Emperor didn't look like Zez√© imagined. He had heard Emperor Pedro was a young man in his 20s,still unmarried last he'd heard,but the man before him was noticeably older than that, by perhaps a decade (though still younger than Zez√©), and had white paint upon his face, in a pattern of dots upon his brow, and a wife by his side. As his heralds read out the Emperor's titles (in Fluminese, which he did not speak),Zez√© looked at the decadence around him. The emperor's entourage was filled with career bureaucrats, men (and some women) in elaborate military dress uniforms who'd likely never seen a battle, and hundreds of miscellaneous servants and hangers-on, perhaps even a thousand. A dozen ensigns carried a banner with a gold lion of the ruling family, and another dozen carried the banner of Brasil. Such wealth being squandered on such a pointless display. The herald came to the end of the titles, and Zez√© felt a jolt of surprise as he heard, clearly, ""His Magnanimity, Emperor Jos√© Maur√≠cio van Derley."" How humiliating! He hadn't even been brought before the real emperor, but some usurper from... from...All-Father knows where! The False Emperor, sitting on his throne, said something in Fluminese, and Manoel translated.

""The Emperor greets you, King of Mato Grosso, and apologizes for the harsh conditions you were kept under, but asks that you understand, many of his soldiers and subordinates do not fully acknowledge your people as wayward subjects of Old Brasil who have since lost their way, but instead see you as a foreign invader with no place in our society.""Zez√© tried to remain calm, but internally he burned with fury. This false emperor had not only denied his lordship of all the Cerrado, not only ignored his other titles, but asserted something prior emperors had never dared do, not since the days of Old Brasil, and claimed the Cerrado rightfully belonged to the Emperor! Manoel continued ""The Emperor asks that you accompany him to Rio de Janeiro, along with the good lady Ana Maria de Mello, *Capit√£-General* of this region, and her current Security Secretary, the good *Coronel* of this Colonelate, so that the terms of your military withdrawal may be discussed in a fairer setting, and compensation for the unprovoked aggression of your soldiers may be negotiated, and so that you may be present at his formal coronation.""

Zez√© recognized this was not a request. He would be accompanying the emperor to Rio either way. But he needed redress for the insults, to bend before the Emperor without resistance would be the height of cowardice, and so, he spoke. ""Tell the Emperor I accept his invitation, but demand the *Coronel* faces consequences for his actions, as he gravely insulted me."" Manoel dutifully translated, and the Emperor responded in Fluminese. ""As you are a guest of the state, the *Coronel* has already been given a most severe reprimand for his mistreatment of you.""Zez√© looked over at the *Coronel*, who did not look particularly reprimanded, and in fact looked downright smug. And were those new, cleaner silks? Had the Emperor actually rewarded him? Another insult, perhaps, or perhaps he was quick to recover. But soon enough, the audience was over, and they were all off to Rio.

On the journey, Zez√© came to ask Manoel what a Veredista was doing in the service of the Emperor. The Veredista communities, were, after all, foremost in Barreiras, a place currently under the suzerainty of the Cerrado, and by extension, Zez√© himself, and learned that Manoel was one of the Emperor's foremost concubines, a minor courtier of a neighbor to the Emperor who was offered the position back when Emperor Jos√© Maur√≠cio was merely one *Capit√£o-General* among many. Zez√© found this greatly offputting, as the Heavenly Father disapproved of men lying with men (and indeed the Causos made a particular point that this was improper), but he steeled himself and said nothing. Further proof of the decadence of the court of Brasil and their religion too, he thought.

Zez√© and the Emperor spoke again, (Through Manoel, of course, to talk in the other's language would be degrading) during a stop at S√£o Louren√ßo, when the Emperor called Zez√© to his chambers for a private audience, apparently to ask a question that had been burning in his mind the whole time they had traveled together. ""The Emperor asks why you thought you, with your host of scarcely ten thousand men, could defeat Brasil's army which stands at near four times the size? Did you have support on the inside that made you think you could succeed?"" At that moment, this last insult broke the dam that had held Zez√© back. He no longer cared whether the Emperor had him whipped or hung, anything would be better than this parade of indignity.

""Does your arrogance, your decadence know no bounds? You are ostentatious beyond compare, displaying wealth in frivolous displays in towns that long have submitted to you! You squander your empire's resources! Your armies do nothing but fight each other, in endless wars! You lie with men as you lie with women!""(At this, Manoel's expression turned dark)""You are a usurper yourself, corrupt to the core and in the eyes of every god and spirit, and Emperor Pedro must have been even lesser than you to lose to such an arrogant aberrancy! Brasil should have fallen, you would have paid tribute, because my warriors were the greatest! I would have won, entirely without help from inside, if every army of Brasil had not arrived at once and...""

The Emperor, furious, spoke in halting, thickly accented Cerradiano. ""That was not the 'every army of Brasil', that was the army of *Capit√£-General* Ana Maria, and the army of the Governor of Minas, not even half of 'every army of Brasil', deployed to fight you. You are nothing. You call me decadent, you call me arrogant, but you are the one who rode on Brasil to what, die? If what you say is true, you rode on Brasil because you have a death wish. Did you not know the size of the army of Brasil? The... the..."" The Emperor turned and whispered something to Manoel, who responded, and the Emperor continued. ""insanity, of your people! You did not even pause to consider basic things! You did not pause to consider why, if your people are the best warriors to ever do war, you live on some of the worst land in all the lands of Old Brasil, barring the wretched rainforests of Amazonas! If your people were truly strong, you would live where we live, in rich land that makes our people numerous and wealthy, where sugar and coffee and cacao and tobacco grow with ease, instead of the Cerrado, where the soil is so poor that you cannot grow any substantial number of crops without great effort! In the time of Old Brasil, it is said, they had to ship many millions of tons of lime out there each year and breed new strains of crops in addition, just to grow anything worth seeing there beyond a sheep or a cow, and those crops have since died, and we do not have the great wagons on steel roads that allowed them to carry such loads of lime, and so the Cerrado is today worthless land! You, you are a weak man from that worthless land, and you call yourself a Great Lord because you rule over only that which no one but those even more pitiful than you bother to fight over! You are the Great Lord of Dirt, Emperor of Grass, and Benevolent Protector of a Few Trees, stuck, isolated from the world! Your greatest army, made up of nearly half of the able-bodied men in your whole country, stood at barely over ten thousand! The population of Brasil, according to our latest census, stands at an estimated eight million! What were you thinking was going to happen?! If any... any... Horse-Lord"" (the phrase dripped with contempt) ""could ride through with bows and spears out, and enter an even slightly more desirable plot of land, how do you think Brasil existed long enough for you to try to become that Horse-Lord? Someone greater than you, (an easy feat), would have done it centuries ago.Decadence indeed! Wealth has made us strong, not weak, and poverty has made you weak, not strong! Our acceptance of difference, which you call a component of that 'Decadence', has made us stronger than you can imagine, with soldiers of various kinds for all occasions, and more people, not turned down for their gender or who they love, who can serve as great leaders of our people.But your memory is short, and your people's memory is selective. You remember antediluvian stories of the triumph of the nomad, of the ancient Genghis Khan, and forget that his name alone being immortal means that there were many thousands of other leaders, leaders more sensible than you, who lived and died on their worthless land, unable to even risk the escape to anywhere where anything worth growing can survive, or, who, like ***you***, fruitlessly led their people to the slaughter, and never again made their mark on history!""

The Emperor didn't give Zez√© time to respond before the guards seized him and dragged him from the room. He was left clapped in irons for the rest of the long trip to Rio, after they forced him on pain of death to sign humiliating concessions of territory, war reparations, and worst of all, acknowledge that he ruled the Cerrado in the name of the Emperor rather than in his own right. In truth, Zez√© was somewhat relieved they didn't cut out his tongue after he had spoken such to the emperor, though he did not dare admit it,not even fully to himself. He was not permitted to speak to Manoel or Emperor Jos√© Maur√≠cio again during the journey, not that he wished to. As they traveled north towards, the cities they went through grew ever visibly richer, and he grew ever more horrified at how truly wealthy and powerful Brasil really was, and he regretted ever more having ever engaged at the Battle of Franca. His troops had been faster, most were mounted, he had been in control, he could have retreated. His assumption that didn't have to learn about who he was fighting had doomed him to this, he knew that now. His life was ruined. There was nothing back home for him except disgrace.

After the entourage arrived in Rio, a great parade was held where Zez√© was paraded in front of a crowd in chains and dressed in what seemed to be a costume of stereotypical barbaric pelts, along with several other captured leaders from the other wars, each dressed differently, though no less ridiculously. The crowd had more people in it than Zez√©'s entire court and community combined, and his despair grew as the crowd jeered and booed him. How could he ever have been so arrogant as to imagine he could defeat Brasil, even in a moment of turmoil? His father had never tried, and he now knew, for good reason. He was a disgrace to the Heavenly Father, he was a disgrace to the Marru√°s, he was a disgrace to every god and spirit. After a long, miserable walk through the streets of Rio, he was brought onto a stage with the Emperor and several soldiers, where the Emperor's accomplishments were announced in every language of the Empire, and in the Goiano dialect of his language, he heard it. ""This is the false King Zez√© Pena Branca, of Mato Grosso, who we defeated and captured in a Great Battle at Arax√° after he cruelly butchered his way through Triangulo, which had been abandoned to its fate by the unfit emperor Pedro The Tenth, now retired to a life of contemplation in a monastery to seek forgiveness for his errors.Magnanimously, the Emperor shall be sparing King Zez√©'s life in exchange for reparations willingly given of...""

Arax√°. ARAX√Å. He'd gotten lost all those weeks ago. He'd crossed the wrong river. Of course the ""Rio Grande"" was surprisingly small, he'd never crossed it at all, and walked right into the Emperor's Armies. Why had he gone off-road?Why did he think he could outsmart every other commander and successfully destroy Brasil's army in a single surprise attack? He was skilled and he had used his skills, he knew how to ford rivers expertly, he knew he was a rare tactical brilliance, ""once in a generation"" he had been told, since he was young, but... ARAX√Å! Of course! Of course. If he had just not gotten lost, if he had only...but it was too late now. There was no victory to be gained, there never had been, if he had won, the Emperor, whoever it would be, would have just sent another army after him. There was no victory, just as there had been no Battle of Franca.

King Zez√© left Brasil alive and mostly unharmed, but as a broken man. By the time he returned, his attempt to unify the Cerrado had already begun crumbling away. The tribute he was forced to pay to Brasil for what he had done was worth little to them, but to his herds and the herds of his people, it was punishing indeed. Zez√© would never truly escape the legacy of his defeat, and on his deathbed, what had once been an Empire of the Plains on the cusp of greatness was split between his family and close friends, and the interior of the continent once again was ablaze with little conflicts everywhere. But, just as Zez√© had failed in his time, Brasil failed time and time again to push into the Cerrado, despite Emperor Jos√© Maur√≠cio's attempts, and the attempts of his successors. Zez√© had been unable to compete with the numbers of Brasil, but Brasil was unable to send its vast but slow armies into places with so little food and such swift riders. King Zez√©'s name fell into obscurity as the Cerrado once again resumed its predictable rhythms, as it had seen before him, and before his father.

But the story doesn't end there, because in that obscurity, King Zez√©'s ambitions could be reborn in another who did not remember what had happened last time, and then another, and another, as each failure was forgotten, as the Emperor Jos√© Maur√≠cio I van Derley had so mocked. One day, something would break, Brasil would be caught at just the wrong moment, after a great disaster, or plague, or some truly great crisis of succession, and a king in the Cerrado would have that perfect combination of fortune and skill and enmity against their own old ways at just the right time to forge the various horse-riders into something united firmly,and not make a critical mistake in their battle plans, and for the first time since Old Brasil itself, standing as yet another Benevolent Protector Of Bras√≠lia, triumph at last and force the Emperor to bend, and so the city of Bras√≠lia would once again stand proud as the True Capital of Brasil, if only for one perfect lifetime.",3,1751629191.0,AfterTheEndFanFork,1,1.0,False

So, yes I want to tinker with a recipe sort of.

I have two Colby recipes: one that adds salt to the curds, and does not brine, and another one that adds no salt to curds but brines (standard brine with 8 hours for a 2lb Colby.

Scenario: I have some Gesha coffee from Colombia.  I want to roll the Colby wheel in the coffee grounds then seal it.

Question: should I use the salted/not brined recipe? Or the brined/not salted recipe?

I want to have the coffee flavor infused in the cheese, but I understand I should not add liquid coffee to milk or to the curd wash.

  
And what would be the sequence of events? I can see if I use the salted/not brined batch, I roll it after pressing, let dry, and vac seal.

If I were to brine/not salt the cheese, would I roll after the brine and let it dry on the wheel then seal?  Or let dry then wipe it with olive oil and roll in the ground, then seal?

I‚Äôm 6‚Äô3 and my TDEE is 2,500 per day (as I do exercise regularly - sometimes cardio sometimes weights). However I don‚Äôt see how I could even get to 2,000 (I.e. a 500 deficit from BMR) and usually do about 1,200-1,500. 

Breakfast - never have liked breakfast and since years have just been having one black coffee in the morning and so usually don‚Äôt eat until 12. 
Lunch (around 12).  Usually a high protein salad or a huel shake - usually around 500 calories. 
Dinner (around 6:30). Varies but usually lots of fresh veggies and carbs and protein. Like chicken and rice and veggies. Or sushi. This again is usually around 500-600 calories. Maybe 800 on an occasional day out if I went to a restaurant. 

I don‚Äôt really snack but sometimes would if I did would be a banana or apple or yogurt or one scoop of protein shake if my calories that day were lower. 

On the above I feel content and not hungry or fatigued. But I still wouldn‚Äôt get to 2,000 calories in a day based on a 500 calorie deficit. 

So am so surprised by how I managed to eat so much before. I think mindless snacking, especially the late night munchies, was my undoing. Where I‚Äôd just open the fridge and stuff my mouth with whatever I could see. ",4,1751629119.0,mounjarouk,4,1.0,False
1lrglkk,https://www.reddit.com/r/FODMAPS/comments/1lrglkk/how_i_got_rid_of_my_sibo_ibs/,How I got rid of my SIBO & IBS,"So, a lot of people have messaged me asking about my protocol. Figured at this stage it's probably easiest to just put it here for people to come back to.

About three years ago I got rid of my SIBO. It took about two years to do it, and a LOT of trial and error.A lot.I've avoided posting for a while because in my experience any time I do it ends up with a lot of debate and arguments, and just to be perfectly honest that's not what I'm here for.I assume most people who get rid of SIBO leave these boards and likely don't come back, job done. As a result, a lot of the help is from people who still have it, or have 'done the research', or are trying to find people to come to their clinic (seen a lot of this lately, including a TCM practitioner who is using this board to find clients which is sketchy af) 

Not ideal. You need something that has worked. Not should work in theory.

The other thing I run into is a lot of questioning the rationale or attempts at retailoring/adjusting. This is a relatively new diagnosis. It is not an exact science. What works for one person may or may not work for another. My honest is, find a system that worked for someone, and try that. Don't reinvent it. Don't armchair expert it. Do what worked, or at least try it. And then if it doesn't work, abandon it.

I once had the best chocolate chip cookie I've ever had at a party once, I asked the woman what her secret was. She said 'I follow the instructions on the box exactly to the measure. Why would I think I know more than the cookie people?'

I'm definitely not the cookie people. But I do have a method, it took a lot of work to get right. And I believe it needs to be done just right to work. I hope that it will work for you. Just to avoid argument I'll likely be muting replies on this at some point. But If you DO try it out, and need help, please feel free to DM me. All I ask that you try it this way first.

1: You need to get the mechanics right first. Before you can kill it. This is the most important single aspect of beating SIBO. If you start at part 2, you it won't work, because your sibo is coming back at the same time you're killing it.

What I'm going to try to get you to do is hyperdigest food. So much so that food goes through you easier and faster. We're not trying to isolate a specific issue. We're going to put your whole digestion into overdrive. Motility gets a lot of attention, but if food isn't digested well, it will move slower. The two go hand in hand.

This is primarily for Hydrogen, but it should work for the most part for methane. Methane is tougher, but this SHOULD make everything else easier once you've done it consistently for about a month.

I want you to get these EXACT brands.

1: Power Digest by Wholesome Health. This takes the place of like 7 other supplements I tried. It literally mimics digestion. Top to bottom. It is phased so it digests the way your body is supposed to, almost like an exogenous digestion. It's incredibly helpful. Take TWO with each meal or snak. As soon as you eat.They don't as of now offer international shipping, and the company is super tiny, but I bet if you ask them they would do it.

2:  Spectrazyme Pancreatin 9x ES 1 with meals: the only downside to Power Digest is the pancreatic enzymes aren't enough. This stuff is like baby creon, it's pretty powerful and hits right when your body needs it.

3:  Benfotiamine 150-250mg- 1 with meals: Increases motility, gastric acid, it does a lot. If you get tired the first time you take it, don't worry it will go away. Other forms of Thiamine work too, but Benfo just happens to be my favorite.

4: Zinc. Ideally liposomal 50mg- once per day. Codeage is a good brand. Low Zinc correlates to low gastric acid. 

5: Motegrity/Plucaloopride or Pyrodistimine if you have it. Take it how is best for you, some people find motegrity best 3-4 hours after eating. Some people right after. If you can't get either, and Artichoke/Ginger supplement like Gut Motility can help a lot, but it may run out of it's efficacy long term. The others should still help a lot, so hopefully this is just getting you from an 7/8 to a 9/10.

Try that, as written, on it's own for two weeks before adding any of the next pieces. Your SIBO will not go away. But keep very clear notes of whether you digestion gets even slightly easier.

If not, lets add based on your experience:

A: You feel like food is still getting 'stuck' and you're constipated.

Add Fibercon. This is not just another Fiber, it can't feed bacteria, and it will help get fluid into your intestines. So, it should make things easier to pass.

B: You still don't feel like you're able to digest... at all. Likely you have a bit of dysbiosis, you probably did a kill phase at some point, or an antibiotic that left you not feeling great. Get Kefirlabs Coconut Kefir, have about a third of a bottle after each meal. If it makes things worse, drop it right away. This is a 50/50 split- works great for some, not for others. 

C: You still can't eat some stuff.You can't go spend your life avoiding foods. If your car doesn't turn left, you don't just never take left turns. You take it to the mechanic and get it fixed. Based on which foods bother you most, go to Intoleran.com and try to find the one the works for you. Alternatively, Fodmate works great for many people in doing all of them.

D: You're getting gassy symptoms:Take Atrantil whenever you get symptoms. It will say to take it when you eat, just take it as needed, two at a time. This stuff is magic for gas.

If you're still having trouble, try adding another from the A/B/C/D category, it's tough to exactly line up symptoms to treatments. But try to stick to these temporarily.

E: You've tried ABCD exactly as suggested and they are just not doing it.Can you get pyrodistigmine or motegrity and add them in? If so, do it. If not, I may not have an answer for you. I deeply apologize. 

F: One last thing that helped me a lot: Intoleran's Starchway. I take one before bed and it feels like my gut goes into overdrive. Can't explain it for the life of me, but try it!

I would also HIGHLY recommend not eating within 4 hours of going to bed.

Now, likely you have ideally some improvement when you eat. Sibo is still there, but you have less difficulty when eating. (I hope, I got like a 70% hit ratio at this point. Ideally you're in the 70.) If you're not here, don't move to kill. I'm telling you it won't work. I would bet a lot of people reading have actually figured out their kill but because the mechanics are off, the SIBO is actually coming back at the same time they're killing it. If you haven't gotten your mechanics right, it will likely come back soon after or worse, it won't even feel like it's gone.

THE KILL:

1: The first thing I would try is EPC's Sustained Release Dehydroberberine.

The slow release makes it kill slowly and over time. It's powerful but it just stays in your system killing over and over. It's great stuff. It's not just berberine, it's the sustained release aspect that makes it so potent, I've yet to see another supplement work that way.

2: Next up: Xifaxin + NAC. Taking 1000mg of NAC each time you take Xifaxin makes it like crazy potent, at least for me. Cedars recommends this protocol as well, so there's def rationale behind it.

3: You're gonna tell me I'm crazy, but if you're getting here and you still aren't having success, try Kefir Labs Coconut Kefir- the amount of good bacteria in there can just wipe out the bad. It helps me on the rare occasion I get a flare up (normally I only get them if I eat super late before bed.) It's worked for a few people on these threads.

Lastly, there are the more extreme methods:

A: If you're open to it, Antibiotics will likely work. My two favorites are Alinia and Cipro. Alinia is a lot of things at once, but it's antibiotic qualities seem to be perfect for most SIBO. Cipro gets a lot of haters. Obviously talk to your doctor first, and you will need to to get it prescribed anyways. Yes, It has red label warnings, but then again so does Tylenol. It's frequently prescribed at hospitals and generally considered fairly safe except for those with tendon issues among older people. I suggest you decide for yourself by visiting the floxxies thread on Reddit if you're on the fence. You'll likely notice the lack of consistency in the symptoms people claim to have. I don't agree with the hate but again I don't want to argue, but  if you're really concerned about it Just Don't Take It. (easy enough!)

B: Just do the Elemental Diet. It works. Nearly every time. The thing is, you HAVE to have your mechanics figured out first. It takes a LONG FUCKING TIME, and it is awful. People say 2 weeks, I say it's more like three for most people to see success. You got to stick to it. The worst would be to go through all that and not have your mechanics figured out and have to do it again, so focus on that first and foremost. Oh, and you can have coffee. It's kind of the one little cheat. And if you get a decent tasting Elemental, you can put a little in your coffee too and it's kinda like sweet and low.

BEST OF LUCK. Feel free to hit me up if you need any guidance, all I ask is do part 1 first.",0,1751629074.0,FODMAPS,6,0.42,False

1lrghbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1lrghbt/bermuda/,Bermuda,"As a kid, I remember watching horrifying documentaries that sensationalized the imminent dangers posed by aliens, crop-circles, Bigfoot, and blackholes. There were so many: Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious Universe (1994‚Äì1995), History‚Äôs Mysteries (1998‚Äì2006), Sightings (1992‚Äì1998), Decoding the Past (late 1990s), and The Proof Is Out There (early 2000s). These shows terrified me as a kid and I took these so-called ‚Äúfacts‚Äù at face value. Looking back on that strange time, I noticed that of all the weird paranormal stuff that was covered, the Bermuda Triangle seemed to be the biggest threat. At one point I vividly remember the History Channel telling me the Bermuda Triangle was a place where strange and frightening things happened; that it was out to get us. Examples of such documentaries include: The Curse of the Bermuda Triangle (1990s‚Äì2000s), and The Bermuda Triangle: Into Cursed Waters (late 1990s). I‚Äôm pretty sure my interest in ‚Äúhigh strangeness‚Äù, along with a love for science-fiction horror like the Outer Limits and the Twilight Zone, was kindled by my watching such documentaries. Then, like with all things, time passed and I realized a lot of those stories simply weren‚Äôt true.

Now, in 2025, I‚Äôm all grown up and have trained as a photojournalist. I worked mostly for nature magazines but sometimes for fun took jobs investigating supposedly haunted locations. A few years ago, I visited some of the most haunted places along the West coast of the US, including the Queen Mary, the Whaley House, Alcatraz, and the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. Despite all the time I spent searching, I never once saw anything supernatural. 

I‚Äôd recently saved up some money and decided to finally take the trip I‚Äôd been wanting to take since I was eight: visiting the Bermuda Triangle. Based on years of my own research, I decided the area with the most likely truly ‚Äúsupernatural‚Äù activity would be near one of the many islands which make up the archipelago. I don‚Äôt believe in the supernatural anymore, but I was compelled to go and look. I took a flight from Orlando to Bermuda. It was idyllic here; the friendly locals, beautiful fresh skies, gorgeous rolling beaches and the cold, indifferent ocean. It was late in the evening when I exited the airport. I called my friend who lives nearby and he drove me to his home. After an early night and a large breakfast he drove me to the docks. I‚Äôd grown up by the sea and my family were originally fishermen so I was confident in my boating abilities. I got in the small boat and inspected the engine and double checked my supplies. It was morning and the sun was low. I heard the water slap the sides of the boat. The air was cold and salty. I closed my eyes as a zephyr caressed my face. I took in a deep breath of satisfaction. I loved being back on the ocean. ‚ÄúHave fun out there, try not to get in any trouble!‚Äù My friend shouted at me and waved as I started the engine and made my way out of the harbor. I checked my map again. The island I was looking for was tiny. I would be satisfied if I could make it there, take a look around, then leave. I wasn‚Äôt planning to spend too long out here. I had supplies for a few days but that was just a precaution. I expected to be back at the dock within a day. 

After a few hours of gliding through the vast blue ocean I‚Äôd already seen dolphins and some whales and I‚Äôd gotten some great shots. Goosebumps spread down my neck and arms as I realized i was finally here. I was in the Bermuda Triangle! As I looked around I couldn't help but feel a bit underwhelmed. There was nothing out here but the sea. Nevertheless, I was determined to enjoy myself. The frigid wind whipped through my hair as I heard the distant cries of seagulls. Or was that an albatross? I poured boiling hot coffee from my thermos into a tin cup. I blew on the steam and carefully took a sip. It was delicious. Just then, I noticed my compass. My eyebrow arched. The needle on my compass was spinning like a top. ‚ÄúNo way,‚Äù I mumbled softly. I ran over to the ship‚Äôs controls in excitement. I tried the radio. It was dead. My head was spinning. Before I could fully take in the weirdness, a bright white light exploded to life above me. No way! I thought, no way! I screamed and shielded my eyes. What the hell was that? Ob my God! Is it happening? ‚ÄúShut down your engine immediately! These are restricted waters! Prepare for boarding!‚Äù I heard a voice boom from a loudspeaker. Two gigantic black police-boats, with enormous blaring spotlights atop each, were suddenly within spitting distance of my small single-engine boat. Oh, shit! Had I somehow crossed into a restricted area? There was no warning! My friend had said nothing. There was also no trace of any warnings on my map or from my online research. I blinked rapidly from confusion as my heart lunged hard against my ribs. Of course, I immediately obeyed. The engine shuddered as it stopped. I didn‚Äôt feel like getting shot or blown up. I held up my arms in submission. 

In less than a minute, my small boat became quite crowded. Officers in black uniforms swarmed all around me and told me to sit. I quickly explained who I was, why I was there and that I really had not known that I was in restricted waters. They took my ID card. Soon they were much less aggressive; it appeared whatever background test they did came back clear. I was relieved when they said they believed me. ‚ÄúCivilians are not permitted in this area, it is very dangerous!‚Äù I looked sheepishly up at one of the officers as I asked, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs out here that‚Äôs so dangerous?‚Äù The officers exchanged an enigmatic expression. Was it fear? ‚ÄúWe are not at liberty to say, sir,‚Äù he answered as he handed me a fine for 550 dollars. ‚ÄúConsider this a warning, if we catch you back out here again we will arrest you. If you‚Äôre lucky.‚Äù My head felt full of air. Was this happening right now? For real? I was in the middle of the Bermuda Triangle being interrogated by agents who I‚Äôd expect only existed in Area 51. This isn‚Äôt real-life, right? 

Suddenly a deep rumbling sound unlike anything I knew blasted into existence. I couldn‚Äôt tell where it came from. Was it all around us? It sounded like a tuba. Or an oboe. The sound was so loud I felt it in my chest. It swelled and swelled, louder and louder. Then it stopped abruptly. The officers and agents went berserk. Immediately weapons were drawn, orders screamed over their walkie-talkies. Then it got a lot weirder. The waters to our side began to bubble and seethe. Immediately, I noticed all our boats were moving. On their own? No. There was a current! But how? I looked on in disbelief as the ocean before me swirled faster and faster. A whirlpool formed, and before long it was a massive maelstrom. My mind had whiplash from the sudden shift in our situation. Where was I? What the hell was going on? All around me the officers began to yell in alarm. ‚ÄúShit! We have an event! Contact! Contact!‚Äù They yelled and pulled out their rifles. To my great confusion they began to fire at the sea! 

Then I realized why. We were swirling in a vortex of water like a paper boat in a gutter. As the sea in the middle was pulled apart I saw what lay below. My heart nearly stopped. That same horrible sound blasted out again like a deep trumpet. I felt my chest vibrate as the sound roared out so loud we all clamped our ears in pain. The sound came from something beneath the water. It was large and circular, with many lights peppered throughout its bulk. What the fuck is that? A city? A space-ship? I couldn‚Äôt tell. The boat whirled and shook, faster and faster. Soon we would capsize! The wind swirled cold and salty around me. When I looked up and gasped. We had already been pulled deep into the whirlpool. The sky was a shrinking circle of pale blue above us. The officers leapt into the water trying to escape. I jumped in too and immediately fell into frigid darkness.

When I woke up I was not surprised to find myself cold and shaking. However, I was very surprised when I realized I was lying naked on a cold metal table. I screamed and sat up. The room around me was small and empty. It was all made from dull metal. Sweat beaded my forehead and my heart was hammering hard. Where the hell was I? Where were the other officers? Where was the sea? It was then, while inspecting my aching head with my fingertips, that I felt something. A chill rolled down my back. Oh God, what was that? I leapt up and looked for a mirror. When I found none, I squinted into the reflective metal surface of the wall. In my right temple there was a small piece of silvery metal. It was cool and smooth. There was no pain. In an instant I was cursing and looking for an exit, and when I saw one I ran out as fast as I could. Where was I? Who had done this to me? The exit I ran through led me to a maze of long metallic tunnels. As I ran I glanced through multiple doorways. Within many were the remnants of old boats, submarines, and I even saw an old Spitfire airplane! I don‚Äôt know how many doorways I tried, but eventually I came to one much larger than the others; it was rectangular rather than semi-circle in shape. As I passed through, I froze. My eyes nearly popped out of my head. I was standing in a massive room that must have been at least a mile long! There, stretched out before me, were rows and rows of people! They were all floating in glass tanks. All of them had that same metal implant in their heads, only theirs were all blinking rapidly with a red light. They were also all equipped with breathing tubes and small monitors displaying strange symbols blinked and beeped next to each respective pod. I panted from having run so far and walked slowly in disbelief towards the nearest tank. Just like all the others, a naked person floated gently within some transparent fluid.  I looked at the monitor next to the tank. It displayed some language I‚Äôd never seen before. Suddenly, out of the corner of my eye, I noticed the person in the tank twitch. Small bubbles leaked from their mouth. That confirms it! They were still alive! Suddenly, I heard a noise. Were those footsteps? Claustrophobic panic sent a surge of adrenaline through me and immediately I was running again. As I ran by the pods I thought, Were they pickling these people? Keeping them trapped? Before I could think more I stopped again. This time I nearly puked. The pods I was running past now no longer held bodies. Instead they held brains. Human brains. The same blinking metal prosthetic was seen on them. It was then that I realized I had lingered here too long. Behind me I heard the footsteps grow louder and louder. 

Clank. 
Clank. 
Clank. 

It was the unmistakable sound of metal on metal. Then the footsteps stopped. My heart thumped. I held my breath. I spun around. I only saw what stood behind me for a moment. All I can say is that they looked humanoid, and were partly organic and partly machine. Any other detail is lost to me. Almost immediately after I turned, I heard a beep come from my prosthetic and I‚Äôm sure, if I could have seen it, I would have noticed a little blinking red-light flicker to life too.

Suddenly I was back on my boat like nothing had happened. I shook my head in disbelief. My hands were trembling. I was clothed again! How? What? At first, I could not understand what had happened. How I long for those days. Of course, the first thing I did was try the radio. And, of course, it did not work. Without thinking further, I started my engine and headed for land. Hours ticked by. My heart beat harder and harder. Sweat trickled down my arms and forehead. I yelled in frustration. Where was the land? At first, I thought my compass must be wrong. Could I be lost now in the middle of the ocean? That‚Äôs when I noticed for the first time: the sun wasn‚Äôt moving. It seemed no closer to setting now than it had hours before. Panic flooded my blood. I had to get out of here! 

I don‚Äôt remember how long I tried. I must have travelled for thousands of miles across the ocean. I can‚Äôt get back to land. It never comes back. A few times I even leapt into the ocean and swam as deep down as I could. There‚Äôs nothing down there. Not just no land. There‚Äôs no dolphins, sharks, whales, fish or crustaceans of any kind. No birds in the sky. No other boats. Not even one single bit of plankton. Days went by. Soon weeks must have passed too. Now I spend my days on this God forsaken boat. The boat never changes. As soon as I turn, whatever dent or damage has occurred to it magically repairs itself. Is my mind or soul trapped in some simulation? Is this a punishment? Are they studying me?

I have no idea how much time has progressed. I must have been out here for years. How many? Hundreds at least. I cannot remember the smell of dirt. Will they ever let me go? Will I ever know why? When I can dream I dream of never setting foot in Bermuda, of my friends and my family, of the smell of petrichor, of eating popcorn at the cinema, of beer and sex, of petting my cat one last time. All I do is cry and scream in rage and sail alone, the taste of salt the only thing I know now. I‚Äôve tried suicide, but all that happens is I wake up back on this fucking boat! Have they left my brain on some shelf? Am I forgotten? A failed project? For centuries I have been starving but cannot die. I drink nothing but sea-water. 

I used to know I was in a simulation. But can I be sure? Was there ever such a person as me? Or was I a dream? Was this always my real life? The truth matters little. There is nothing now but the flat endless sea.

# Chapter 1 - He Chose Her: My Husband's Ultimate Betrayal

My world imploded as, suspended thousands of feet in the air facing potential death, my husband, Mathew, didn‚Äôt hesitate for even a split second before choosing Milana‚Äîhis so-called ""dream girl"" and past obsession‚Äîover me, his wife.

It all unfolded on my thirtieth birthday, when Mathew, in what I thought was a romantic gesture, chartered a helicopter ride for us. To my utter disbelief, Milana, the woman he‚Äôd always idealized, was joining us. Mid-flight, disaster struck in the form of a sudden mechanical failure, and we discovered there were only two parachutes onboard.

Mathew was presented with an impossible choice: save himself and me, or ensure Milana's survival.

Without a moment's hesitation, he chose her.

‚ÄúMilana‚Äôs life is just beginning; she has so much ahead of her. I can‚Äôt bear the thought of her dying,‚Äù he declared, his voice laced with what sounded like genuine anguish. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, Sophia, the moment we‚Äôre safe, I‚Äôll send help back for you.‚Äù

What he didn‚Äôt realize was that this so-called malfunction wasn‚Äôt accidental. It was a test, a cruel and desperate measure I'd orchestrated to expose his true feelings.

As Mathew meticulously secured Milana in her parachute, his face was etched with nothing but urgency and raw fear‚Äîafraid his precious Milana might be harmed. I watched, a silent observer to my own heartbreak. He then strapped on the second parachute, grasped Milana‚Äôs hand tightly, and prepared to jump. Just before they leaped into the void, he cast a fleeting glance back at me.

‚ÄúSophia, please, try to understand,‚Äù he pleaded, his voice strained. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve always had everything, a life of privilege and comfort. Milana hasn‚Äôt been so fortunate.‚Äù

Did that mean she deserved to live more than I did? The question burned in my throat, but the words remained unspoken, trapped by the sheer weight of betrayal. With their fingers entwined, Mathew and Milana jumped from the helicopter and into the abyss. I pressed a button on the control panel, and the malfunction warning light blinked off, the illusion of danger dispelled.

As I watched the two of them locked in a desperate embrace against the backdrop of the clouds, my heart shattered into a million irreparable pieces.

....

Today was not only my thirtieth birthday but also marked seven years since Mathew and I began our life together. We had met because of our shared passion for aviation, and now, with a cruel twist of fate, it seemed fitting that our relationship should end in the same realm. Resolutely, I slid into the pilot's seat and navigated the helicopter back to the base alone.

Once back on solid ground, I changed into comfortable clothes, and I couldn't help but overhear the hushed whispers of the staff.

""Did you hear about Mathew Rogers? He took his dream girl skydiving, and something went terribly wrong.""

""Milana Hudson is seriously injured and in the hospital. I heard Mathew even spared no expense, hiring a whole team of specialists for her treatment.""

""They said he's on his knees outside the operating room, practically begging for her to pull through.""

Each word was like a shard of ice piercing my heart, each whisper a fresh wave of pain. My fists clenched so tightly that my nails broke the skin, drawing blood.

I reached for my phone and called my grandfather's close friend, Reed, who manages a helicopter adventure company nestled in the Alps. He‚Äôd extended countless invitations for me to work there as an instructor, but I always declined, prioritizing Mathew and our daughter, Lottie. Now, finally, I felt ready, even eager, to accept his offer.

Reed was overjoyed to hear from me and to learn of my decision. ""Sophia! That's wonderful news! I'll arrange for someone to collect you; they'll be there the day after tomorrow.""

""Thank you, Grandpa Berry.""

After ending the call, I noticed that Mathew had updated his social media. It was a picture expressing desperate hope, captioned: ""Please, let her be okay.""

The comments section below was flooded with well-wishers assuming he was referring to me, his wife of seven years.

""Mathew, is everything alright? Has something happened to your wife? Do you need anything?""

""Is everything okay with Sophia and the baby?""

Mathew replied to each query individually: ""It's not Sophia; it's Milana who was in the accident.""

My heart plummeted, a lone tear escaping and landing on my phone screen. Mathew and I had first crossed paths at the helicopter base when he was just a young, enthusiastic instructor. Over time, our bond deepened, and he eventually confessed his feelings for me. I was five years his senior and initially believed our relationship was doomed, but he was relentless, showering me with flowers, thoughtful gifts, and unwavering attention. He even once bravely intervened when I was being mugged. Eventually, I surrendered and agreed to be with him.

In the initial years of our marriage, we were deeply in love, and he treated me like a queen. But all too soon, subtle cracks began to appear, revealing signs of his infidelity. I found old photos tucked away in the trash of him and Milana in bed, and I discovered bank statements detailing regular transfers of money to her account. Despite everything, despite the mounting evidence of his betrayal, I found myself unable to leave him, a prisoner of my own love. So, I endured it, time and time again, burying the pain deep within.

# Chapter 2 - My Husband's Obsession

I found myself at the sterile hospital, scheduling the procedure that would end my pregnancy. Five months along, and she was perfect, a miniature human already. Ivan Medina, the doctor, stared at me, a question etched on his face. ""The baby is perfectly healthy, no complications. Are you absolutely certain you want to proceed?"" he asked, his voice laced with disbelief.

""I'm certain,"" I managed to choke out, each word a shard of glass in my throat. What choice did I have? Bringing a child into a world where she'd be unwanted, unloved‚Ä¶ it would be the height of irresponsibility.

When I first discovered I was pregnant, Mathew Rogers had been ecstatic. He'd plastered social media with announcements, declaring himself a soon-to-be father, promising to be a changed man. He'd quit smoking, ditched the late nights with the boys, and showered me with gifts, never missing an anniversary or special occasion. Every night, he'd whisper promises in my ear. How could such a loving man be capable of such betrayal? I‚Äôd chosen to ignore it, clinging to the illusion.

Clutching the appointment card, I turned to leave when I spotted Mathew down the hall. He was slumped in a chair, his face buried in his hands, his shoulders shaking.

""Milana, please be okay. I can't live without you."" He seemed to have completely forgotten about saving me from the plane crash.

A chilling thought struck me: If I hadn't staged the incident today, would I have simply disappeared with the wreckage? As if sensing my presence, Mathew looked up, his eyes widening in shock.

""Sophia? What are you doing here?"" The realization dawned on his face. ""You're alright?""

""Yes, I'm fine,"" I replied, walking towards him, my voice steady.

His face contorted in rage. ""It was you, wasn't it? You sabotaged the plane. You tried to hurt Milana. How could you be so cruel?"" He seized my face, his fingers digging into my cheekbones.

""Yes, I planned it,"" I admitted, forcing myself to meet his gaze. I needed to see how far he'd go for her. His jaw tightened, a muscle ticking in his cheek.

""Sophia, why? Milana just beat cancer. She's finally starting her life. Why would you try to destroy that? If anything happens to her, I swear, you'll pay.""

It was almost comical‚Äîmy husband threatening me for another woman. My faint smile only seemed to infuriate him more, his grip intensifying.

""Sophia! You vicious, cold-hearted bitch. I regret ever marrying you."" The words hung in the air. I was about to tell him the feeling was mutual when Ivan Medina emerged from the operating room.

""The patient is stable,"" he announced, his voice calm and professional.

In that instant, the light returned to Mathew's eyes. The fight drained out of me, and I crumbled to the floor, my cheek throbbing where he'd grabbed me. In that moment, I understood that the young man who had once held me close, whispering, ""Sophia, you're mine forever,"" was gone, lost to me forever.

\---

Milana was wheeled into a private room, while Mathew pinned me against the wall, demanding an apology.

""Sophia, apologize to Milana now! Or so help me, you'll regret this!"" he snarled.

Milana, pale and weak in the bed, murmured, ""I'm‚Ä¶ I'm alright, Mathew. Don‚Äôt get angry because of me. It‚Äôs okay even if I don‚Äôt make it.""

Mathew rushed to her side, his face etched with concern. ""Don't talk like that, Milana. You're the most amazing woman in the world. You have to get better. I still want to take you to Scotland and see the Highlands, visit all those places we talked about.""

Once, I had dreamed of exploring the Scottish Highlands with Mathew. He had promised me, ""I'll take you there, Sophia."" Now, he didn't even remember. I should have realized long ago‚ÄîI was no longer part of his plans.

First, there was the affair in our car. Then, the helicopter ride, the helicopter emblazoned with their names. Each transgression had chipped away at my heart, leaving it raw and bleeding.

""Sophia, this is all your fault. If it weren't for you, none of this would have happened to Milana,"" Mathew roared, grabbing a fistful of my hair. He raised his hand, ready to strike, but stopped, remembering the child I carried.

""Sophia, if you ever try anything like this again, I'll ruin your family, bankrupt them."" But he didn't understand. I no longer cared about money, about my family's reputation. All I wanted was out. I wanted a divorce.

# Chapter 3 - My Husband's Midlife Crisis

Mathew excused himself mid-conversation, claiming he needed to fetch Milana some coffee. He shot me a look that could kill. ""Lay one wrong finger on Milana, Sophia, and you'll regret it.""

Milana, bless her heart, gave me a knowing look and chuckled. ""You lost.""

Damn right, I lost.

Yesterday's harebrained scheme, cooked up between Milana and me, was supposed to gauge Mathew's true feelings during that ridiculous helicopter ride. The results were in: Mathew's heart belonged to her, no contest.

""You should divorce Mathew and get out of this town."" I told her softly.

""I know.""

My voice was barely a whisper.

""After my procedure, I'm leaving.""

""I wish you and Mathew all the happiness in the world."" The words felt like ash in my mouth.

Suddenly, tears streamed down her face. ""Sophia, please, just let me go. Stop doing this to me.""

""I really do love Mathew. We already messed things up once before. I can't lose him again.""

Before I could blink, Mathew was back, a storm cloud in his eyes. He grabbed a fistful of my hair, yanking my head up so I was forced to meet his furious gaze.

""Sophia Ryan, didn't I warn you to keep your hands off Milana?""

""Are you even listening to me?""

Where was the gentle boy who used to speak to me with such tenderness? Now, he was nothing but harsh and unforgiving. Maybe getting out was the only option left.

Milana watched the scene unfold from the bed, a smug look plastered across her face.

I didn't have the fight left in me.

""Mathew, if you care so much about Milana, if you love her that much, let's just get a divorce.""

His pupils constricted, like a cornered animal.

He looked genuinely stunned, as if the idea had never even crossed his mind. ""You want a divorce?"" The disbelief was thick in his voice.

""Yes. Let's head down to the courthouse now, while they're still open.""

""Sophia!"" His anger flared, raw and untamed. ""This is all your fault! You almost hurt Milana!""

""And now you're throwing a childish fit and demanding a divorce? Have you completely lost it?""

""Maybe I have."" I met his gaze, and a memory flashed: just yesterday, he'd held me close, whispering, ""Sophia, do you want a son or a daughter?""

""A son,"" I'd replied, ""as strong as you. Then there'd be two of you to protect me.""

""You'll get your wish.""

Today, he'd shattered that dream into a million pieces.

Seven years. Seven years down the drain.

""Mathew, I want a divorce.""

""I'll be waiting for you at the courthouse.""

After I walked out, a flurry of messages flooded my WhatsApp.

\[Yes, Milana still means something to me, but nothing happened. I still love you more, so what's with this overreaction?\]

\[Sophia, you're not getting any younger. Who else is going to want you if you leave me?\]

\[Just stop this nonsense, okay?\]

Reading his words, I was transported back to our early days.

He always called me ""big sis"" back then.

""Big sis, you're so beautiful. I want to love you forever.""

I'd asked him if he'd ever be disgusted by me when I got old.

He'd looked me dead in the eye, unwavering. ""Never. I'll love you well for the rest of my life.""

""Sophia, I choose you.""

Now, those promises were just hollow echoes.

I spent the entire afternoon cooling my heels at the courthouse, but Mathew never showed.

I finally called him. ""Sophia, I'm not divorcing you,"" he said.

""We've been together too long. I'm not just going to throw it all away like that.""

I couldn't wrap my head around it. If he loved Milana so much, why wouldn't he just let me go?

""Mathew, I know you've always been tangled up with Milana.""

""I also know how much you care about her. I'm setting you free, so you can give her the life she deserves."" My heart felt numb, incapable of beating for him any longer.

He sounded dumbstruck on the other end, probably shocked that I knew the truth.

There's a saying: You see how they love you, so you know immediately when they don't.

That's exactly how it was with Mathew.

He'd once loved me deeply; now that his feelings had shifted, the change was glaringly obvious.

""I'm not really in love with her. I'm just trying to recapture something I missed out on in my youth.""

""Sophia, don't take it so hard. This is just a phase. I'll get over it.""

It was clear I'd never get him to come to the courthouse and sign the papers.

So, I hung up and dialed Alma, Mathew's mother.

	‚Ä¢	and knowing it‚Äôs OK to not always be available

Not looking for intense oversharing, not looking to trauma-bond, not looking to build a mini-community. Just that one or two people who get it. Who are cool with a calm bond, with a rhythm that breathes.

I don't HAVE to think like that anymore!,"As a larva, I had such a bright, bubbly, and optimistic attitude towards life - any problem can be solved with enough hard work, together we can accomplish anything, etc.  Then ""manhood"" hit me like a ton of bricks.

The type of ""manhood"" I was exposed to is the sorta dark, dour, sarcastic, and generally pessimistic kind that responds to optimism, especially bubbly optimism, as being inherently naive and feminine.  Naturally, my attitudes didn't mesh with that and my masculine mentors picked up on it like bloodhounds.

It was really quick that they reinforced ""men don't think like that"" or ""that's not how men solve problems"".  So it was brow beaten out of me.  I learned and adapted my thinking to match theirs, same with my humor, and my problem solving approach.  

Rather than problems being the problem and building a team to solve them, the focus became hyper individualistic ""I have to solve this on my own and accepting or seeking help is weakness"".

I just realized though, during my morning coffee, that it's all bullshit.  Like, for one, I'm trans baby!  So those masc expectations no longer apply.  But more than that, even if I weren't trans, I finally saw the social engineering for what it was and was able to pull up my original, natural way of thinking and being.

It was like a huuuuge weight was lifted off my heart and I could just be me again.  I think I'll spend the rest of my morning playing a problem solving game like Rimworld and see how it feels to approach problems the way I _actually_ want to solve them.

That's what this was for me.

I started Tuesday night only to find the dough looking exactly the same Wednesday morning and realizing I never added the yeast.

I tried again the next day and awoke to find it looked pretty much the same as the day before. Thankfully, someone helpful said to give it more time, so I did.

The recipe says 12-15 hours, it took my dough like 19 hours before I finally got some bubblage.

From there everything proceeded as intended, including my first stretch n folds.

In between those steps I managed to make something for dinner and spent the rest of the time trying to get little bits of dough off of everything.

This dough was smwet and sticky, or high hydration. I was reminded of the scene early in the first Ghostbusters ""someone blew their nose and you want to keep it?""

At some point I remembered we used to buy ciabatta rolls from Aldi and my kids would have them for breakfast, so I decided to make the 18 rolls. I don't know if that was a good idea or not.
A couple people mentioned how much of a pain plastic wrap to cover the dough was and said a bowl was a good idea. I had some bowls ready to go and improvised with coffee mugs for when a bowl wouldn't fit between other bowls.

My baking stone still hasn't fixed itself so I used the upside down sheet pan to bake on, with a metal loaf pan for the water.

I managed to get everything baked. It was a little tricky having the dough ready to go in, then boiling water, putting the dough in, then measuring out the water and adding that after the dough. Somehow I remembered to have an oven mitt on to move the racks when I needed.

I baked two batches for 15 minutes and one for 16. They both came out ok but the 15 minute ones seems little pale

I don't know how anyone gets these to all be uniform.

I tried one and it was good  very chewy with a nice crust. My daughter says it's good. Don't think my son or wife tried it yet. Dog gives it two thumbs up.

Would I make these again? Maybe, but I'd have to have a very open schedule.

New techniques? Nothing really comes to mind  I've cooked with steam before but I don't think it was baked goods, and I doubt I booked the water first.

Published on the Fourth of July, this reflection cuts through the celebration to ask the question that haunts every ambitious person: what does true independence actually cost? While we wave flags and celebrate a nation‚Äôs hard-won freedom, most of us remain prisoners of our own making‚Äîtrapped by golden handcuffs, social expectations, and the fear of disappointing others. This isn‚Äôt about fireworks and patriotic platitudes. It‚Äôs about the messy, uncomfortable truth of what it takes to live entirely on your own terms.

The Paradox of Craving What We Fear
Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs fascinating about human psychology: we simultaneously crave and fear independence. We dream of total autonomy while clinging to the very structures that constrain us. This isn‚Äôt weakness‚Äîit‚Äôs evolutionary programming. For thousands of years, being cast out from the tribe meant death. Today, that primal fear shows up as the knot in your stomach when you imagine disappointing your parents, the anxiety of leaving a secure job, or the terror of social judgment.

Independence Day celebrates revolutionaries who risked everything‚Äîtheir fortunes, their reputations, their lives‚Äîfor an abstract ideal. But what are you willing to risk for yours?

When you close your eyes and picture true independence, what emerges? Is it waking up without an alarm, answerable to no one? Is it walking away from toxic relationships without guilt? Or is it the financial cushion that lets you say ‚Äúno‚Äù without consequence? Each vision of freedom reveals what you feel most trapped by today.

The Four Types of Independence (And Why You Can‚Äôt Have Them All)
True independence isn‚Äôt singular‚Äîit‚Äôs a complex ecosystem with distinct, often competing elements:

Financial Independence means your money works for you, not the other way around. You‚Äôre not trading time for dollars, and you‚Äôre not one emergency away from panic. But financial independence often requires years of delayed gratification, living below your means, and making unpopular choices while others spend freely.

Emotional Independence is perhaps the hardest to achieve. It‚Äôs the ability to feel secure in your own approval, to make decisions based on your values rather than others‚Äô expectations. It means being comfortable with disappointing people‚Äîeven people you love. This often costs you the easy comfort of always fitting in.

Creative Independence allows you to express your authentic vision without compromise. Artists, writers, and entrepreneurs know this freedom intimately‚Äîand they know its price. You trade the safety of following someone else‚Äôs blueprint for the terrifying responsibility of creating your own.

Social Independence is the freedom to choose your tribe rather than accepting the one you were born into. It might mean leaving your hometown, changing social circles, or standing apart from family traditions. The cost? Sometimes profound loneliness as you search for your real people.

Here‚Äôs the uncomfortable truth: these types of independence often conflict. The entrepreneur building financial independence might sacrifice creative control to investors. The artist pursuing creative freedom might remain financially dependent on others. The person seeking emotional independence might find themselves socially isolated.

The Stories We Don‚Äôt Tell About Freedom
Let me share what really happened when I left my corporate job‚Äînot the sanitized version you usually hear. Yes, I gained afternoon walks and passion projects. But I also gained 3 AM anxiety spirals about next month‚Äôs rent. I traded my stable identity as ‚Äúsuccessful corporate employee‚Äù for the daily uncertainty of ‚Äúfreelancer who might be deluding herself.‚Äù

The freedom was intoxicating, but it came with a psychological tax I hadn‚Äôt anticipated. When you‚Äôre responsible for your own success, every failure feels personal. When you don‚Äôt have colleagues to share the blame, every mistake is yours alone. Independence can be profoundly lonely.

My friend Sarah‚Äôs story illustrates another hidden cost. She left her big-city marketing career to run a pottery studio in rural Vermont. She found the creative fulfillment and slower pace she craved, but she also found herself explaining her choices at every family gathering. ‚ÄúWhen are you going to get serious about your career?‚Äù became the soundtrack of holidays. Her independence required her to repeatedly defend decisions that felt obviously right to her but looked like failure to others.

Then there‚Äôs Michael, who built a seven-figure business that gave him complete financial freedom‚Äîand discovered that success brought its own cage. Now he‚Äôs responsible for dozens of employees‚Äô livelihoods. His freedom to make impulsive decisions vanished under the weight of obligation to others. He jokes that he‚Äôs less free now than when he was an employee, but he‚Äôs also more fulfilled. Independence, it turns out, isn‚Äôt about having no responsibilities‚Äîit‚Äôs about choosing which responsibilities align with your values.

The Psychological Architecture of Independence
What most people don‚Äôt realize is that independence isn‚Äôt just about external circumstances‚Äîit‚Äôs about rewiring decades of psychological conditioning. We‚Äôre raised to seek approval, to follow established paths, to find security in external validation. True independence requires dismantling these deep-seated patterns.

Consider the psychological research on ‚Äúlocus of control‚Äù‚Äîwhether you believe you‚Äôre in charge of your life or at the mercy of external forces. People with an internal locus of control are happier and more successful, but developing this mindset often means giving up the comfortable illusion that someone else is responsible for your outcomes.

Independence also requires what psychologists call ‚Äúdifferentiation‚Äù‚Äîthe ability to maintain your sense of self even when others disapprove. This sounds simple until you‚Äôre sitting across from disappointed parents or watching friends pull away because your choices make them question their own.

Designing Your Independence Blueprint
True independence isn‚Äôt about rejecting all constraints‚Äîit‚Äôs about consciously choosing which constraints serve your deepest values. Here‚Äôs how to map your personal path:

Start with your non-negotiables. What aspects of your current life would you never willingly give up? Your relationship with your children? Your creative practice? Your morning coffee ritual? These are your foundation‚Äîthe things that define who you are regardless of external circumstances.

Identify your current trade-offs. What are you giving up right now for security, approval, or comfort? Are you staying in a job that drains you for health insurance? Are you living in a city you hate to stay close to family? Are you avoiding difficult conversations to keep the peace? Get honest about the prices you‚Äôre already paying.

Calculate the cost of change. If you made different choices, what would you lose? Be specific. Don‚Äôt just say ‚Äúfinancial security‚Äù‚Äîcalculate exactly how much less money you might make and what that would mean for your lifestyle. Don‚Äôt just say ‚Äúfamily approval‚Äù‚Äîimagine the specific conversations and relationships that might become strained.

Run the regret test. Imagine yourself at 80, looking back. Which would you regret more‚Äîthe risks you took or the ones you didn‚Äôt take? This isn‚Äôt about being reckless; it‚Äôs about getting clear on what matters most when everything else falls away.

Design your transition strategy. Independence rarely happens overnight. What small steps could you take to move toward your vision while minimizing unnecessary risk? Could you freelance on weekends before quitting your job? Could you have honest conversations with family members before making dramatic changes?

The Paradox of Interdependence
Here‚Äôs perhaps the most counterintuitive truth about independence: the most independent people aren‚Äôt isolated‚Äîthey‚Äôre selectively interdependent. They‚Äôve learned to distinguish between relationships of convenience and relationships of choice, between obligations imposed by others and commitments that flow from their values.

True independence might mean you‚Äôre more dependent on a small circle of people who truly see and support you, rather than superficially connected to many who expect you to play a role that doesn‚Äôt fit.

Your Independence Day Declaration
As the fireworks fade and the flags come down, the real work begins. Independence isn‚Äôt a destination‚Äîit‚Äôs a daily practice of aligning your choices with your deepest values, even when those choices are difficult.

Your personal declaration of independence doesn‚Äôt need to be grand or public. It might be as quiet as setting a boundary with a demanding client, as personal as choosing your own definition of success, or as simple as protecting your morning routine from the demands of others.

The question isn‚Äôt whether you‚Äôre ready to be completely independent‚Äîfew of us ever are. The question is whether you‚Äôre ready to start making choices based on your own definition of a life worth living, rather than someone else‚Äôs expectations of who you should be.

What would you write in your personal Declaration of Independence? What freedoms would you claim, and what are you willing to sacrifice to claim them?

The revolution starts with a single, honest answer.

‚ÄúWhat does freedom look like to me specifically?‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúWhat am I afraid of losing?‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúWhat am I afraid of gaining?‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúWhat would I regret not trying?‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs one small step I could take this week?‚Äù

1lrg80l,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1lrg80l/bermuda/,Bermuda,"As a kid, I remember watching horrifying documentaries that sensationalized the imminent dangers posed by aliens, crop-circles, Bigfoot, and blackholes. There were so many: Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious Universe (1994‚Äì1995), History‚Äôs Mysteries (1998‚Äì2006), Sightings (1992‚Äì1998), Decoding the Past (late 1990s), and The Proof Is Out There (early 2000s). These shows terrified me as a kid and I took these so-called ‚Äúfacts‚Äù at face value. Looking back on that strange time, I noticed that of all the weird paranormal stuff that was covered, the Bermuda Triangle seemed to be the biggest threat. At one point I vividly remember the History Channel telling me the Bermuda Triangle was a place where strange and frightening things happened; that it was out to get us. Examples of such documentaries include: The Curse of the Bermuda Triangle (1990s‚Äì2000s), and The Bermuda Triangle: Into Cursed Waters (late 1990s). I‚Äôm pretty sure my interest in ‚Äúhigh strangeness‚Äù, along with a love for science-fiction horror like the Outer Limits and the Twilight Zone, was kindled by my watching such documentaries. Then, like with all things, time passed and I realized a lot of those stories simply weren‚Äôt true.

Now, in 2025, I‚Äôm all grown up and have trained as a photojournalist. I worked mostly for nature magazines but sometimes for fun took jobs investigating supposedly haunted locations. A few years ago, I visited some of the most haunted places along the West coast of the US, including the Queen Mary, the Whaley House, Alcatraz, and the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. Despite all the time I spent searching, I never once saw anything supernatural. 

I‚Äôd recently saved up some money and decided to finally take the trip I‚Äôd been wanting to take since I was eight: visiting the Bermuda Triangle. Based on years of my own research, I decided the area with the most likely truly ‚Äúsupernatural‚Äù activity would be near one of the many islands which make up the archipelago. I don‚Äôt believe in the supernatural anymore, but I was compelled to go and look. I took a flight from Orlando to Bermuda. It was idyllic here; the friendly locals, beautiful fresh skies, gorgeous rolling beaches and the cold, indifferent ocean. It was late in the evening when I exited the airport. I called my friend who lives nearby and he drove me to his home. After an early night and a large breakfast he drove me to the docks. I‚Äôd grown up by the sea and my family were originally fishermen so I was confident in my boating abilities. I got in the small boat and inspected the engine and double checked my supplies. It was morning and the sun was low. I heard the water slap the sides of the boat. The air was cold and salty. I closed my eyes as a zephyr caressed my face. I took in a deep breath of satisfaction. I loved being back on the ocean. ‚ÄúHave fun out there, try not to get in any trouble!‚Äù My friend shouted at me and waved as I started the engine and made my way out of the harbor. I checked my map again. The island I was looking for was tiny. I would be satisfied if I could make it there, take a look around, then leave. I wasn‚Äôt planning to spend too long out here. I had supplies for a few days but that was just a precaution. I expected to be back at the dock within a day. 

After a few hours of gliding through the vast blue ocean I‚Äôd already seen dolphins and some whales and I‚Äôd gotten some great shots. Goosebumps spread down my neck and arms as I realized i was finally here. I was in the Bermuda Triangle! As I looked around I couldn't help but feel a bit underwhelmed. There was nothing out here but the sea. Nevertheless, I was determined to enjoy myself. The frigid wind whipped through my hair as I heard the distant cries of seagulls. Or was that an albatross? I poured boiling hot coffee from my thermos into a tin cup. I blew on the steam and carefully took a sip. It was delicious. Just then, I noticed my compass. My eyebrow arched. The needle on my compass was spinning like a top. ‚ÄúNo way,‚Äù I mumbled softly. I ran over to the ship‚Äôs controls in excitement. I tried the radio. It was dead. My head was spinning. Before I could fully take in the weirdness, a bright white light exploded to life above me. No way! I thought, no way! I screamed and shielded my eyes. What the hell was that? Ob my God! Is it happening? ‚ÄúShut down your engine immediately! These are restricted waters! Prepare for boarding!‚Äù I heard a voice boom from a loudspeaker. Two gigantic black police-boats, with enormous blaring spotlights atop each, were suddenly within spitting distance of my small single-engine boat. Oh, shit! Had I somehow crossed into a restricted area? There was no warning! My friend had said nothing. There was also no trace of any warnings on my map or from my online research. I blinked rapidly from confusion as my heart lunged hard against my ribs. Of course, I immediately obeyed. The engine shuddered as it stopped. I didn‚Äôt feel like getting shot or blown up. I held up my arms in submission. 

In less than a minute, my small boat became quite crowded. Officers in black uniforms swarmed all around me and told me to sit. I quickly explained who I was, why I was there and that I really had not known that I was in restricted waters. They took my ID card. Soon they were much less aggressive; it appeared whatever background test they did came back clear. I was relieved when they said they believed me. ‚ÄúCivilians are not permitted in this area, it is very dangerous!‚Äù I looked sheepishly up at one of the officers as I asked, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs out here that‚Äôs so dangerous?‚Äù The officers exchanged an enigmatic expression. Was it fear? ‚ÄúWe are not at liberty to say, sir,‚Äù he answered as he handed me a fine for 550 dollars. ‚ÄúConsider this a warning, if we catch you back out here again we will arrest you. If you‚Äôre lucky.‚Äù My head felt full of air. Was this happening right now? For real? I was in the middle of the Bermuda Triangle being interrogated by agents who I‚Äôd expect only existed in Area 51. This isn‚Äôt real-life, right? 

Suddenly a deep rumbling sound unlike anything I knew blasted into existence. I couldn‚Äôt tell where it came from. Was it all around us? It sounded like a tuba. Or an oboe. The sound was so loud I felt it in my chest. It swelled and swelled, louder and louder. Then it stopped abruptly. The officers and agents went berserk. Immediately weapons were drawn, orders screamed over their walkie-talkies. Then it got a lot weirder. The waters to our side began to bubble and seethe. Immediately, I noticed all our boats were moving. On their own? No. There was a current! But how? I looked on in disbelief as the ocean before me swirled faster and faster. A whirlpool formed, and before long it was a massive maelstrom. My mind had whiplash from the sudden shift in our situation. Where was I? What the hell was going on? All around me the officers began to yell in alarm. ‚ÄúShit! We have an event! Contact! Contact!‚Äù They yelled and pulled out their rifles. To my great confusion they began to fire at the sea! 

Then I realized why. We were swirling in a vortex of water like a paper boat in a gutter. As the sea in the middle was pulled apart I saw what lay below. My heart nearly stopped. That same horrible sound blasted out again like a deep trumpet. I felt my chest vibrate as the sound roared out so loud we all clamped our ears in pain. The sound came from something beneath the water. It was large and circular, with many lights peppered throughout its bulk. What the fuck is that? A city? A space-ship? I couldn‚Äôt tell. The boat whirled and shook, faster and faster. Soon we would capsize! The wind swirled cold and salty around me. When I looked up and gasped. We had already been pulled deep into the whirlpool. The sky was a shrinking circle of pale blue above us. The officers leapt into the water trying to escape. I jumped in too and immediately fell into frigid darkness.

When I woke up I was not surprised to find myself cold and shaking. However, I was very surprised when I realized I was lying naked on a cold metal table. I screamed and sat up. The room around me was small and empty. It was all made from dull metal. Sweat beaded my forehead and my heart was hammering hard. Where the hell was I? Where were the other officers? Where was the sea? It was then, while inspecting my aching head with my fingertips, that I felt something. A chill rolled down my back. Oh God, what was that? I leapt up and looked for a mirror. When I found none, I squinted into the reflective metal surface of the wall. In my right temple there was a small piece of silvery metal. It was cool and smooth. There was no pain. In an instant I was cursing and looking for an exit, and when I saw one I ran out as fast as I could. Where was I? Who had done this to me? The exit I ran through led me to a maze of long metallic tunnels. As I ran I glanced through multiple doorways. Within many were the remnants of old boats, submarines, and I even saw an old Spitfire airplane! I don‚Äôt know how many doorways I tried, but eventually I came to one much larger than the others; it was rectangular rather than semi-circle in shape. As I passed through, I froze. My eyes nearly popped out of my head. I was standing in a massive room that must have been at least a mile long! There, stretched out before me, were rows and rows of people! They were all floating in glass tanks. All of them had that same metal implant in their heads, only theirs were all blinking rapidly with a red light. They were also all equipped with breathing tubes and small monitors displaying strange symbols blinked and beeped next to each respective pod. I panted from having run so far and walked slowly in disbelief towards the nearest tank. Just like all the others, a naked person floated gently within some transparent fluid.  I looked at the monitor next to the tank. It displayed some language I‚Äôd never seen before. Suddenly, out of the corner of my eye, I noticed the person in the tank twitch. Small bubbles leaked from their mouth. That confirms it! They were still alive! Suddenly, I heard a noise. Were those footsteps? Claustrophobic panic sent a surge of adrenaline through me and immediately I was running again. As I ran by the pods I thought, Were they pickling these people? Keeping them trapped? Before I could think more I stopped again. This time I nearly puked. The pods I was running past now no longer held bodies. Instead they held brains. Human brains. The same blinking metal prosthetic was seen on them. It was then that I realized I had lingered here too long. Behind me I heard the footsteps grow louder and louder. 

Clank. 
Clank. 
Clank. 

It was the unmistakable sound of metal on metal. Then the footsteps stopped. My heart thumped. I held my breath. I spun around. I only saw what stood behind me for a moment. All I can say is that they looked humanoid, and were partly organic and partly machine. Any other detail is lost to me. Almost immediately after I turned, I heard a beep come from my prosthetic and I‚Äôm sure, if I could have seen it, I would have noticed a little blinking red-light flicker to life too.

Suddenly I was back on my boat like nothing had happened. I shook my head in disbelief. My hands were trembling. I was clothed again! How? What? At first, I could not understand what had happened. How I long for those days. Of course, the first thing I did was try the radio. And, of course, it did not work. Without thinking further, I started my engine and headed for land. Hours ticked by. My heart beat harder and harder. Sweat trickled down my arms and forehead. I yelled in frustration. Where was the land? At first, I thought my compass must be wrong. Could I be lost now in the middle of the ocean? That‚Äôs when I noticed for the first time: the sun wasn‚Äôt moving. It seemed no closer to setting now than it had hours before. Panic flooded my blood. I had to get out of here! 

I don‚Äôt remember how long I tried. I must have travelled for thousands of miles across the ocean. I can‚Äôt get back to land. It never comes back. A few times I even leapt into the ocean and swam as deep down as I could. There‚Äôs nothing down there. Not just no land. There‚Äôs no dolphins, sharks, whales, fish or crustaceans of any kind. No birds in the sky. No other boats. Not even one single bit of plankton. Days went by. Soon weeks must have passed too. Now I spend my days on this God forsaken boat. The boat never changes. As soon as I turn, whatever dent or damage has occurred to it magically repairs itself. Is my mind or soul trapped in some simulation? Is this a punishment? Are they studying me?

I have no idea how much time has progressed. I must have been out here for years. How many? Hundreds at least. I cannot remember the smell of dirt. Will they ever let me go? Will I ever know why? When I can dream I dream of never setting foot in Bermuda, of my friends and my family, of the smell of petrichor, of eating popcorn at the cinema, of beer and sex, of petting my cat one last time. All I do is cry and scream in rage and sail alone, the taste of salt the only thing I know now. I‚Äôve tried suicide, but all that happens is I wake up back on this fucking boat! Have they left my brain on some shelf? Am I forgotten? A failed project? For centuries I have been starving but cannot die. I drink nothing but sea-water. 

I used to know I was in a simulation. But can I be sure? Was there ever such a person as me? Or was I a dream? Was this always my real life? The truth matters little. There is nothing now but the flat endless sea. ",1,1751627759.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,0.67,False

Olivia's POV

¬†

""Wake up, Olivia,"" Mom's voice echoed in my sleep.

¬†*3*

I groaned, pulling the blanket over my head. ""Five more minutes, Mom.""

¬†

""We don't have any more minutes,"" she snapped, shaking my leg with a force that made it impossible to ignore. ""Get up now, or we'll be late.""

¬†

""Mom,"" I groaned in frustration, slowly forcing my eyes open.

¬†

""Don't tell me you still want to sleep,"" she said, standing at the foot of my bed, her hands placed firmly on her hips as she tapped her foot impatiently on the tiled floor. ""Other servants are already up doing their duties, but you are still sleeping? Do you want us relieved of our duties?"" Mother snapped angrily at me.

¬†*1*

I sighed heavily, tossing the blanket aside as I dragged myself out of bed. ""I'm up, I'm up,"" I muttered, rubbing the sleep from my eyes.

¬†

""Anita is staying in the pack house for the weekend, and she has asked that you be the one to attend to her until she leaves,"" Mother announced, and my frown deepened. ""Why me? Out of all the servants, why do I have to be her personal maid?""

¬†

""Don't start,"" Mom said firmly, shoving me toward the bathroom. ""Get moving. There's no time for complaining.""

¬†

I stomped to the bathroom, muttering under my breath as I turned on the tap.

¬†

The thought of spending the day attending to Anita made my stomach churn.

¬†

Anita and I were born on the same day, which was why we were close in the first place. Once, she had been my best friend. We'd grown up together, running through the forest, sharing secrets, and dreaming of our future.

¬†

That was before everything fell apart.

¬†

My father was one of the pack's strongest warriors, and my mother worked in the pack hospital. Our family may not have been the wealthiest, but we had respect.

¬†

But everything changed the night of the setup.

¬†

I stared into the mirror as the memories replayed in my head. My father had been framed for stealing from the Alpha, a crime punishable by death. Despite his pleas of innocence, no one believed him. The evidence gotten was all pointed at him, planted carefully by someone who wanted to see him fall. We were stripped of everything. My father was imprisoned for life, my mother was demoted to an omega, and I was forced to share her fate.

¬†

Anita was there that night. She hadn't comforted me, hadn't spoken up for the family she once called her own. Instead, she stayed silent, her gaze avoiding mine as we were being mocked.

¬†

Now, years later, our former Beta had died from an incurable illness, and her father was appointed the new Beta. Anita was now the Beta's daughter. And I? I was nothing more than a servant. An omega.

¬†

What made it worse was how effortlessly she fit into her new role. The triplets, our Alpha's sons, Louis, Levi, and Lennox, loved her. Their attention, their admiration, it all belonged to her now. They literally worshiped the ground she walked on, and everyone believed she would turn out to be their mate once she turned eighteen, which was only a few days away. The brothers were actually competing among themselves for her attention and love, and it was so annoying to watch. Or perhaps I was just jealous of her life.

¬†*1*

I finished washing up, dressed quickly into the maid's uniform, and stepped into the kitchen, where my mother was preparing breakfast.

¬†

""Olivia,"" my mother called, ""I know this isn't easy, but‚Ä¶ we've already lost so much. Don't give them a reason to take more.""

¬†

I nodded, biting back the urge to argue. She didn't understand. How could she? I was once the daughter of a respected Gamma, but now? I was a mere Omega.

¬†*5*

""Here,"" my mother said, handing me a tray with a steaming cup of coffee. ""She asked for this.""

¬†

I frowned but took the tray and headed toward the guest room where she was staying.

¬†

""I'll find my mate, and all this will be over,"" I whispered, trying to comfort myself.

¬†

But I let out a dry laugh. Yeah, right. The only mate I would get was another omega, another nobody just like me. This life? It wasn't ending.

¬†

Reaching Anita's room, I sighed heavily and knocked on her door, bracing myself for another day of being reminded of how far I'd fallen, and how far she'd risen.

¬†

I sucked a deep breath before knocking again.

¬†

""Come in,"" Anita's voice called.

¬†

I pushed the door open carefully, keeping my head down. ""Your coffee,"" I said quietly, stepping inside the room.

¬†

The first thing I noticed was the sound. A soft giggle, followed by the low murmur of a man's voice. My eyes moved up for just a second, and what I saw stopped me in my tracks.

¬†

There they were, Anita and Louis. She was tangled in his arms on the bed, her silky robe slipping off one shoulder. His shirt was open, his muscular chest on full display as he leaned into her, his lips brushing her neck.

¬†

I swallowed hard. My eyes darted back to the floor, and I placed the coffee on the table. Without another word, I turned, desperate to leave.

¬†

""Wait,"" Anita said sharply.

¬†

I froze, turning back to her reluctantly.

¬†

She kissed Louis deeply and even moaned in between the kisses before pulling away.

¬†*4*

My wolf growled in spite, but I put on a blank expression. Anita stepped out of the bed in just in her matching set of red underwear. I watched her sway her hips seductively at Louis, and I noticed how he hungrily gawked at her. Anita has a sexy body, and I have to give her credit for that.

¬†

She picked up the cup of coffee, her lips curling into a smug smile as she swirled the liquid inside. Her eyes scanned me from head to toe. Louis remained silent on the bed, leaning back against the headboard.

¬†

She took a slow sip, her nose wrinkling in exaggerated displeasure. ""What is this?"" she asked, her voice sharp and filled with annoyance.

¬†

""It's the coffee you requested,"" I replied respectfully, keeping my tone polite despite the way my wolf growled in the back of my mind.

¬†

""This?"" she scoffed, holding the cup out as if it were something filthy. ""You call this coffee?""

¬†

My jaw clenched, but I forced myself to remain calm. ""It was made in the way you like it,"" I said.

¬†

Anita's eyes narrowed in anger, and suddenly, she threw the hot coffee over my chest and arms, soaking through my dress. The sharp sting of the heat made me gasp, but I bit my lip to keep from crying out.

¬†

""Next time you serve me garbage like this, I swear I'll dump it on your face.""

¬†

Behind her, Louis remained silent, not wanting to interfere.

¬†

I stood frozen, my frown deepening as the coffee dripped down my skin. My wolf stirred, angry. I could almost hear her urging me to act. But what could I do?

¬†

""I'm sorry if the coffee wasn't to your liking,"" I said quietly, forcing the words out despite the lump in my throat. ""I'll remake it.""

¬†

Anita laughed, a light, annoying sound that grated on my nerves. ""Don't bother,"" she said, waving a dismissive hand. ""Just try to be less useless next time.""

¬†

Turning her back to me, She turned away, moving toward Louis. She slid onto his lap like I wasn't even in the room. He pulled her close, barely sparing me a glance before his lips found her neck.

¬†

""You're dismissed,"" he said, though his voice lacked the sharpness it usually carried.

¬†*5*

I swallowed hard, nodded, and turned to leave, my heart racing in my chest.

¬†

As I stepped out of the room, I let out a shaky breath. The humiliation burned as much as the coffee had, but I sucked in a deep breath and gathered my emotions.

¬†

Making my way back to the kitchen, I met with Bala, Lennox's personal guard. ""There you are. Lennox calls for you,""

¬†

I frowned. ""Did he say why?"" I asked, my stomach tightening. Lennox, the eldest of the triplets, rarely summoned me unless it was important. And rarely for anything good.

¬†

Bala shrugged. ""Not exactly, but he seemed really furious.""

¬†

A lump formed in my throat, but I forced myself to stay composed. Without another word, I turned and made my way to Lennox's room.

¬†

When I reached his door, I hesitated for a moment before knocking. Instantly, His authoritative voice ordered me in.

¬†

Hi Everyone!

This is my first book here. check it out and tell me what you think.

Chapter 2: Accused

¬†

Olivia's POV

¬†

Pushing the door open, I met a furious-looking Lennox waiting for me. His room was a mess. Clothes littered the floor, shoes thrown to each corner of the room. I was confused to see it in such a state because Lennox is a top-notch man when it comes to cleanliness; he loves everything tidy.

¬†

The moment he noticed my presence, he turned to me, and our eyes met. I could see anger and hatred for me in his eyes, and this baffled me because, among the triplets, Lennox was the closest to me when we were little. Back then, when my father was still a respectable warrior, he would bring me to the pack house to watch him train, and on various occasions, my path crossed with the triplets. I was just seven years old then, and they were twelve years old, but we turned out to be great friends. In fact, I visited the pack house more often, and while my father trained other warriors, I played with the triplets.

¬†*2*

But that was before.

¬†

Before everything fell apart.

¬†

Just like Anita, they severed all ties, acting as though we had never been friends.

¬†

""Who cleaned my room yesterday?"" Lennox suddenly asked, his voice filled with rage that made my wolf whimper in fear inside me.

¬†

I swallowed hard in fear and forced myself to speak. ""I did.""

¬†

Lennox's expression darkened, and he took another step towards me, but out of fear, I instinctively took a step backward.

¬†

""Then tell me, Omega,"" he sneered, his voice dripping with anger, ""where is the diamond necklace I kept in my top drawer?""

¬†

I froze, my heart racing as Lennox's words sank in. A diamond necklace? I had no idea what he was talking about. My mind reeled, trying to recall if I had seen anything of the sort while cleaning his room. But all I could remember was organizing his scattered belongings, folding his clothes, and dusting the surfaces. There had been no necklace in the drawer.

¬†

""I‚Ä¶ I didn't see any necklace,"" I stammered, my voice trembling as I met his accusing gaze.

¬†*5*

Lennox's eyes narrowed. ""Don't lie to me, Omega,"" he growled, his tone laced with anger. ""The necklace didn't just grow legs and walk out of the drawer.""

¬†*2*

""I'm not lying!"" I protested, panic creeping into my voice. ""I cleaned the room, but I didn't take anything. I swear!""

¬†

He closed the distance between us instantly, towering over me with his imposing frame. ""You expect me to believe that?"" he snapped. ""You and your kind are all the same. Thieves and liars.""

¬†*5*

His words hurt me, and I felt my wolf stir with anger, but I quickly suppressed her. Defending myself against Lennox in this state would only escalate things.

¬†

""I didn't take it,"" I repeated, my voice steadier this time. ""You can search me if you don't believe me. Check my room. Check anywhere you want. I have nothing to hide.""

¬†*2*

Lennox studied me, his jaw clenched tight. For a moment, I thought he might strike me, but instead, he turned and began tearing through the room, pulling open drawers, throwing clothes onto the floor, and overturning furniture searching for the necklace.

¬†

I stood there, my lips pressed together as I fought to hold back my tears. The Lennox I had known as a child, the boy who had taught me to climb trees, The boy who used to teach me how to swim, who used to protect me from his brothers' pranks, was gone. In his place was a cold, bitter man who saw me as nothing more than a thief and a liar.

¬†*1*

Minutes later Lennox stopped searching, his breathing heavy as he stood amidst the chaos he had created. The necklace was nowhere to be found. He turned to me, his eyes blazing with frustration.

¬†

""I can't find it, Olivia. It's gone. That was a gift I got for Anita, a gift I wanted to give her on her eighteenth birthday. Do you know how much that cost me?"" he asked in anger.

¬†

I swallowed hard in fear but stood my ground. ""I did not take it‚Ä¶""

¬†

""Lies!"" he angrily cut me off.

¬†

Lennox exhaled sharply, rubbing his temple. ""This doesn't make sense,"" he muttered. ""You cleaned my room. You were the last one here."" His gaze hardened. ""Don't lie to me, Olivia. Where is it?""

¬†

When I remained silent, his eyes blazed.

¬†

""You are a thief, just like your father! A thief!"" he cursed, and I pressed my lips together, holding myself back from answering him.

¬†

Lennox's words hit me like a blow to the chest. A thief. Just like my father. It didn't matter how hard I worked, how much I tried to keep my head down and stay out of trouble, this pack would always see me as the daughter of a disgraced warrior.

¬†

""Only two people came into this room yesterday,"" Lennox continued, his voice low and sharp, like the growl of his wolf ready to pounce. ""You and Anita. So, tell me, Olivia, who else could have taken it?""

¬†

I stiffened at his words, the pieces clicking together in my mind. Anita. Of course. She had been in his room yesterday. I remembered seeing her standing by his dresser, pretending to admire a framed photograph.

¬†

I knew Anita better than anyone else. She was cunning, always looking for ways to get what she wanted. I remembered the time she stole a pack warrior's silver bracelet, only to cry her way out of trouble. Or the time she framed a servant for breaking the Alpha's Favorite vase, earning the poor girl a week in the dungeons.

¬†

And now, she had done it again. But this time, I was her scapegoat.

¬†

Who would dare enter Lennox's room and steal something so valuable?

¬†

No one.

¬†

No one except Anita.

¬†

But the words were heavy on my tongue. I couldn't say it. Not to Lennox. If I accused Anita, I'd only make things worse for myself. No one would believe me. Lennox would defend her, just like everyone else did.

¬†

""I didn't take it,"" I said again.

¬†

Lennox let out a bitter laugh, shaking his head. ""You think I'm stupid, don't you?""

¬†

I bit back a retort, my wolf growling in frustration. I wanted to scream the truth at him, to tell him that Anita was far from the innocent, perfect girl he thought she was. But I couldn't. Not without proof. And even if I had proof, it wouldn't matter. Anita had the triplets wrapped around her finger.

¬†

""You know what, Olivia?"" Lennox sneered, taking another step toward me. ""I'm done wasting my time with you. If that necklace doesn't turn up by the end of the day, I'll make sure you and your mother are punished. Severely.""

¬†

His words sent a chill down my spine, but I stood my ground, meeting his gaze. ""I didn't take it,"" I repeated one last time, my voice steady despite the fear coursing through me.

¬†

Lennox glared at me for a moment longer before turning away, his shoulders tense with rage. ""I give you until the end of today to return that necklace. Get out,"" he growled.

¬†

I didn't need to be told twice. I turned and left the room, my heart pounding as I walked down the hallway. Once I was far enough away, I leaned against the wall, my legs trembling beneath me.

¬†

Anita. She had to be the one who took the necklace. I knew it in my gut. But how could I prove it without putting myself in even more danger? The triplets wouldn't believe me, and Anita would just deny it, twisting the situation to make me look like the villain.

¬†

""Here you are, Olivia,"" a guard said as he walked over to me. ""Levi is looking for you, and he doesn't seem happy.""

¬†

The guard's announcement made my heart sink in fear.

¬†

""Why? What happened?"" I asked, terrified.

¬†

Joshua, the guard, shook his head. ""I don't know, Olivia, but he is really furious and demanding for you.""

¬†

Shit! What could it be this time?

¬†

Chapter 3: Under The Sun

¬†

Olivia's POV

¬†

""Start talking, Olivia‚Ä¶ before I lose my patience,"" Levi demanded, his voice laced with anger.

¬†

I stood frozen, unable to form words as I struggled to process the accusation. Again. I was being accused of stealing‚Äîagain.

¬†

""Olivia!"" His voice thundered through the room. ""Don't make me lose my patience! Where is the bundle of dollar notes I kept in my drawer? Speak, you thief!""

¬†*5*

My eyes widened in shock. But Before I could respond, the door to Levi's room burst open, and Louis stormed in, seething with rage.¬†

*1*

""Olivia, where is the money I kept in my drawer?"" Louis demanded.

¬†*1*

I took a step back, my breath hitching as both Levi and Louis glared at me with fiery rage. My heart pounded in my chest‚Äînot out of guilt, but out of sheer disbelief. This wasn't happening. Not again.

¬†

""I didn't take anything,"" I managed to say, my voice trembling.

¬†

Levi scoffed, running a frustrated hand through his hair. ""Really? Then tell us who else could have taken it. Who else enters our room if not you?""

¬†*1*

Louis folded his arms, his frown deepening. ""Don't play innocent, Olivia. Just return the money and save us all the drama.""

¬†

Tears gathered in my eyes, but I refused to let them fall. At least not now.

¬†

Swallowing the lump in my throat, I forced myself to speak. ""I didn't take your money,"" I repeated, louder this time, my voice shaking with suppressed emotion. ""I would never steal from any of you.""

¬†

""Liar!""

¬†

I flinched at the new voice and turned to see Lennox standing at the doorway. His eyes, filled with cold hatred, locked onto mine.

¬†

""The necklace I bought for Anita is missing too,"" he announced, turning to his brothers.

¬†

All three of them‚ÄîLevi, Louis, and Lennox‚Äîlooked at me as if I were the worst kind of filth.

¬†

Levi was the first to walk toward me, and out of panic, I tried to run away, but it was useless. I was surrounded by the triplets.¬†

Levi pinned me against the wall, lifting my hands above my head while his burning glare was staring right into my eyes.

¬†

""This is your last chance to confess and return what you stole, or you'll be dealt with accordingly,"" he threatened.

¬†

A tear slid down my cheek as I met his angry gaze. I knew, regardless of what I said, they would never believe that I didn't steal from them. They would never believe that their precious Anita was the one stealing from them.

¬†

""One‚Ä¶ two‚Ä¶"" Levi began counting, and all I could do was shed more tears.

¬†

I sobbed silently, knowing the punishment for stealing in this household was brutal. Some thieves were thrown into the dungeons, like my father. Others had their hands chopped off. Some faced even worse fates.

¬†

As Levi counted, my mind raced. Would I end up like my father, rotting in a dungeon? Or worse?¬†

""Ten.""

¬†

He released my wrists and took a step back.

¬†

""She's just like her father‚Äîa stubborn thief,"" Lennox sneered. More tears slipped down my cheeks.

¬†

""Guards! Bring some maids!"" Louis ordered sharply.

¬†

As we waited for the arrival of the maids, my heart raced in my chest. What were these men going to do to me? Why were they sending for maids?¬†

*2*

My gaze met Lennox's, and he glared at me with so much hate, which made me wonder‚Äîdid he really hate me just because my father was accused of stealing? Was this all about it, or was there something else involved? How could a man who once cherished me now look at me with such disgust?

¬†*1*

Three maids walked in and bowed their heads to the triplets.

¬†

Levi was the one to usher the punishment. ""Take her to the mansion rooftop. Strip her and apply pepper to her naked body. Make sure she kneels under the sun.""

¬†*3*

A tear slid down my cheek, but I didn't say a word. Compared to what was done to anyone accused of stealing, this was a lesser punishment for me.

¬†

""Take her away,"" Lennox demanded coldly.

¬†

The maids took hold of my arms and led me out of the room. I didn't struggle. There was no point. As we walked through the mansion, I saw my mother. She was sobbing, her entire body trembling, but she didn't dare approach me. If she did, she'd share my punishment.

¬†

When we reached the rooftop, the maids let go of me.

¬†

""Please undress,"" one of them urged softly.

¬†

I hesitated, my entire body trembling, but there was no escape. Swallowing hard, I began removing my clothes, my tears falling freely.

¬†

One of the maids picked up a bowl of ground pepper and moved closer. My body tensed.

¬†

The moment the first handful of pepper touched my skin, an agonized scream tore from my lips. My body convulsed as the fiery sting spread across my skin. They rubbed it everywhere‚Äîevery inch of my exposed flesh except for my face. The burning sensation was unbearable. My knees buckled, but I forced myself to stay upright.

¬†*3*

""You have to kneel,"" one of the maids said.

¬†

I hesitated, but my body was already giving in. Slowly, I sank to my knees, my sobs wracking my entire being. The scorching sun hit down on me, intensifying the torment. My entire body felt like it was on fire.

¬†

How could anyone be so cruel?

¬†

I wanted to scream, to beg for the pain to stop, but I knew it would only make things worse.

¬†

It was as if the sun was against me because it began to heat even more. My whole body was burning with pain, and it felt like I would pass out soon. The pain was unbearable. I had never imagined I would go through such torture.

¬†

With tear-filled eyes, I looked at the maids who stood in a corner, staring at me with pity. Painful tears trickled down my cheeks while my entire body burned. As the excruciating pain enveloped me, my vision blurred, and my head spun.

¬†

Painful memories flashed through my mind. The triplets used to adore me. They used to fight over who got to spend more time with me. They used to playfully argue about which one of them would marry me when we grew up.

¬†

How did everything change so drastically?

¬†

How did men who once cherished me suddenly hate me so much?

¬†

I wished my father hadn't been framed. I wished he had been proven innocent. Then, maybe‚Ä¶ maybe, the triplets wouldn't hate me this much.

¬†

The fiery sting of the pepper intensified, searing every inch of my exposed skin. I struggled to remain upright, my knees weakening beneath me. With each agonizing breath, the world seemed to tilt and sway until, finally, I could no longer fight the overwhelming sensation of nausea and torment.

¬†

My body gave way, and I crumpled to the ground. Distant voices called my name, but I was already slipping into darkness, into the past. Into the days when the triplets swore they'd protect me. Back when they fought over who would marry me, not who would break me. But those boys were gone. And so was I.

¬†

# CREATORS' THOUGHTS¬†Sugarlitics

I did a wrong calculation. the issue happened on her fourteenth birthday. so it‚Äôs four years ago. not five. anywhere you see it as five years please call out my attention. I will correct it.

Chapter 4: sharing

¬†

Lennox's POV

¬†

An uncomfortable silence hung in the air as neither my brothers nor I spoke. The tension was thick, almost suffocating. An uneasy feeling settled in my chest as my thoughts drifted to Olivia‚Äîto the pain she might be going through. A part of me wanted to stop the punishment, to let it go. But if I did, it would show weakness, a soft spot for her. And I didn't want that. I couldn't afford that. Not after what she did to me.

¬†*6*

""I wonder what she plans to do with all the things she stole,"" Levi spat, his voice sharp with anger, breaking the silence.

¬†

I turned to look at him, noticing the anger in his eyes. He was just as pissed as I was.

¬†

""Maybe she has a boyfriend she plans to give them to,"" Louis grunted.

¬†

The mere thought of that sent a sharp, uncomfortable pain through my chest, but I shoved it down and stood abruptly. ""Tell the guards to search her things. Perhaps they're still in her room.""

¬†

Without waiting for a response, I left the room, heading back to mine.

¬†

The mess I had created in my earlier frustration still littered in my room‚Äîbroken glass, overturned furniture, scattered papers. I ignored it and walked straight to the minibar, grabbing a bottle of whiskey. Uncorking it, I took a long swig, feeling the burn slide down my throat.

¬†

With a sigh, I sank onto the bed, but no matter how hard I tried, my thoughts kept drifting back to Olivia. The punishment she was enduring on the rooftop. I glanced at the window‚Äîthe sun was scorching.

¬†

""If you're so worried about her, then stop the punishment."" My wolf's voice rumbled in my head.

¬†

I clenched my jaw. ""Why should I? Did she think about how I felt years ago when she hurt me? When she said those things?""

¬†*2*

The door to my room pushed open, and Anita stepped inside. Her brows furrowed as she took in the mess in my room before her gaze landed on the whiskey bottle in my hand.

¬†

""Lennox, are you drinking because of the missing necklace?"" she asked, concern lacing her voice.

¬†

I swallowed hard. No. The necklace wasn't why I was drowning myself in whiskey. It was Olivia. But I couldn't say that to Anita.

¬†

""Yes. It was a gift for you,"" I murmured instead.

¬†

Anita sighed and walked closer, kneeling before me. Gently, she took the bottle from my hand and placed it aside before looking directly into my eyes.

¬†

""You don't have to do this to yourself over a necklace. You can always get me another one, right?"" she said, her voice soft, comforting.

¬†*4*

And she was right. Money wasn't the issue. My brothers and I were the sons of the richest Alpha in the world and soon to be Alphas. A stolen diamond necklace shouldn't be enough to put me in this mood.

¬†

""Or‚Ä¶"" Anita tilted her head, her gaze searching mine. ""Is there something else bothering you?"" Anita asked, raising a suspicious brow.

¬†

I quickly shook my head.

¬†

She studied me for a moment before a slow smirk curled her lips. ""I know exactly what you need.""

¬†

Before I could ask what she meant, she reached for the hem of her dress and pulled it over her head, letting the fabric fall to the floor. My gaze traveled over her exposed skin, the smooth curves of her body.

¬†

""Come on,"" she whispered, her voice sultry. ""Let me help you take out your frustration.""

¬†

I said nothing as she unclasped her bra, letting it slide off her shoulders. Then, she moved closer, pressing her body against mine. Her hands traced down my chest, her fingers slowly unbuttoning my shirt before pushing it off.

¬†

""Use me, Lennox,"" she breathed, tilting her head up to meet my gaze. ""Pour all your anger into me. Take what you need.""

¬†

A dark hunger stirred inside me‚Äîthe need to lose myself, to forget everything‚Äîeven if just for a moment. I grabbed the back of her neck, pulling her into a bruising kiss. She gasped against my lips, but I didn't slow down. I pushed her back onto the bed, climbing over her, my body pressing her into the mattress. I ran hungry and angry kisses all over her body before pulling away and standing before her.

¬†

Anita lay back on the bed, her legs spread, her body on full display for me. Her smirk was teasing, her eyes dark with anticipation. She knew what I wanted‚Äîwhat I needed‚Äîand she was more than willing to give it to me.

¬†

I didn't waste time. My belt hit the floor with a sharp clink, and I shoved my pants down, my cock already hard and aching. I crawled onto the bed, grabbing Anita's ankles and yanking her closer, making her gasp in surprise.

¬†

""So rough, so dominant,"" she purred, but I wasn't in the mood for her teasing.

¬†

I wrapped my fingers around her throat, squeezing just enough to make her gasp. ""Shut up,"" I growled, watching her eyes widen with excitement.

¬†

Her lips parted, her breath hitching as I tightened my grip just a little more. ""Yes, Master,"" she whispered.

¬†

That sent a dark thrill through me. I released her throat and grabbed her hips, flipping her onto her stomach in one swift motion. She barely had time to brace herself before I yanked her up onto her knees, positioning her exactly how I wanted.

¬†

Olivia's POV

¬†

""Wake up, Olivia,"" Mom's voice echoed in my sleep.

¬†*3*

I groaned, pulling the blanket over my head. ""Five more minutes, Mom.""

¬†

""We don't have any more minutes,"" she snapped, shaking my leg with a force that made it impossible to ignore. ""Get up now, or we'll be late.""

¬†

""Mom,"" I groaned in frustration, slowly forcing my eyes open.

¬†

""Don't tell me you still want to sleep,"" she said, standing at the foot of my bed, her hands placed firmly on her hips as she tapped her foot impatiently on the tiled floor. ""Other servants are already up doing their duties, but you are still sleeping? Do you want us relieved of our duties?"" Mother snapped angrily at me.

¬†*1*

I sighed heavily, tossing the blanket aside as I dragged myself out of bed. ""I'm up, I'm up,"" I muttered, rubbing the sleep from my eyes.

¬†

""Anita is staying in the pack house for the weekend, and she has asked that you be the one to attend to her until she leaves,"" Mother announced, and my frown deepened. ""Why me? Out of all the servants, why do I have to be her personal maid?""

¬†

""Don't start,"" Mom said firmly, shoving me toward the bathroom. ""Get moving. There's no time for complaining.""

¬†

I stomped to the bathroom, muttering under my breath as I turned on the tap.

¬†

The thought of spending the day attending to Anita made my stomach churn.

¬†

Anita and I were born on the same day, which was why we were close in the first place. Once, she had been my best friend. We'd grown up together, running through the forest, sharing secrets, and dreaming of our future.

¬†

That was before everything fell apart.

¬†

My father was one of the pack's strongest warriors, and my mother worked in the pack hospital. Our family may not have been the wealthiest, but we had respect.

¬†

But everything changed the night of the setup.

¬†

I stared into the mirror as the memories replayed in my head. My father had been framed for stealing from the Alpha, a crime punishable by death. Despite his pleas of innocence, no one believed him. The evidence gotten was all pointed at him, planted carefully by someone who wanted to see him fall. We were stripped of everything. My father was imprisoned for life, my mother was demoted to an omega, and I was forced to share her fate.

¬†

Anita was there that night. She hadn't comforted me, hadn't spoken up for the family she once called her own. Instead, she stayed silent, her gaze avoiding mine as we were being mocked.

¬†

Now, years later, our former Beta had died from an incurable illness, and her father was appointed the new Beta. Anita was now the Beta's daughter. And I? I was nothing more than a servant. An omega.

¬†

What made it worse was how effortlessly she fit into her new role. The triplets, our Alpha's sons, Louis, Levi, and Lennox, loved her. Their attention, their admiration, it all belonged to her now. They literally worshiped the ground she walked on, and everyone believed she would turn out to be their mate once she turned eighteen, which was only a few days away. The brothers were actually competing among themselves for her attention and love, and it was so annoying to watch. Or perhaps I was just jealous of her life.

¬†*1*

I finished washing up, dressed quickly into the maid's uniform, and stepped into the kitchen, where my mother was preparing breakfast.

¬†

""Olivia,"" my mother called, ""I know this isn't easy, but‚Ä¶ we've already lost so much. Don't give them a reason to take more.""

¬†

I nodded, biting back the urge to argue. She didn't understand. How could she? I was once the daughter of a respected Gamma, but now? I was a mere Omega.

¬†*5*

""Here,"" my mother said, handing me a tray with a steaming cup of coffee. ""She asked for this.""

¬†

I frowned but took the tray and headed toward the guest room where she was staying.

¬†

""I'll find my mate, and all this will be over,"" I whispered, trying to comfort myself.

¬†

But I let out a dry laugh. Yeah, right. The only mate I would get was another omega, another nobody just like me. This life? It wasn't ending.

¬†

Reaching Anita's room, I sighed heavily and knocked on her door, bracing myself for another day of being reminded of how far I'd fallen, and how far she'd risen.

¬†

I sucked a deep breath before knocking again.

¬†

""Come in,"" Anita's voice called.

¬†

I pushed the door open carefully, keeping my head down. ""Your coffee,"" I said quietly, stepping inside the room.

¬†

The first thing I noticed was the sound. A soft giggle, followed by the low murmur of a man's voice. My eyes moved up for just a second, and what I saw stopped me in my tracks.

¬†

There they were, Anita and Louis. She was tangled in his arms on the bed, her silky robe slipping off one shoulder. His shirt was open, his muscular chest on full display as he leaned into her, his lips brushing her neck.

¬†

I swallowed hard. My eyes darted back to the floor, and I placed the coffee on the table. Without another word, I turned, desperate to leave.

¬†

""Wait,"" Anita said sharply.

¬†

I froze, turning back to her reluctantly.

¬†

She kissed Louis deeply and even moaned in between the kisses before pulling away.

¬†*4*

My wolf growled in spite, but I put on a blank expression. Anita stepped out of the bed in just in her matching set of red underwear. I watched her sway her hips seductively at Louis, and I noticed how he hungrily gawked at her. Anita has a sexy body, and I have to give her credit for that.

¬†

She picked up the cup of coffee, her lips curling into a smug smile as she swirled the liquid inside. Her eyes scanned me from head to toe. Louis remained silent on the bed, leaning back against the headboard.

¬†

She took a slow sip, her nose wrinkling in exaggerated displeasure. ""What is this?"" she asked, her voice sharp and filled with annoyance.

¬†

""It's the coffee you requested,"" I replied respectfully, keeping my tone polite despite the way my wolf growled in the back of my mind.

¬†

""This?"" she scoffed, holding the cup out as if it were something filthy. ""You call this coffee?""

¬†

My jaw clenched, but I forced myself to remain calm. ""It was made in the way you like it,"" I said.

¬†

Anita's eyes narrowed in anger, and suddenly, she threw the hot coffee over my chest and arms, soaking through my dress. The sharp sting of the heat made me gasp, but I bit my lip to keep from crying out.

¬†

""Next time you serve me garbage like this, I swear I'll dump it on your face.""

¬†

Behind her, Louis remained silent, not wanting to interfere.

¬†

I stood frozen, my frown deepening as the coffee dripped down my skin. My wolf stirred, angry. I could almost hear her urging me to act. But what could I do?

¬†

""I'm sorry if the coffee wasn't to your liking,"" I said quietly, forcing the words out despite the lump in my throat. ""I'll remake it.""

¬†

Anita laughed, a light, annoying sound that grated on my nerves. ""Don't bother,"" she said, waving a dismissive hand. ""Just try to be less useless next time.""

¬†

Turning her back to me, She turned away, moving toward Louis. She slid onto his lap like I wasn't even in the room. He pulled her close, barely sparing me a glance before his lips found her neck.

¬†

""You're dismissed,"" he said, though his voice lacked the sharpness it usually carried.

¬†*5*

I swallowed hard, nodded, and turned to leave, my heart racing in my chest.

¬†

As I stepped out of the room, I let out a shaky breath. The humiliation burned as much as the coffee had, but I sucked in a deep breath and gathered my emotions.

¬†

Making my way back to the kitchen, I met with Bala, Lennox's personal guard. ""There you are. Lennox calls for you,""

¬†

I frowned. ""Did he say why?"" I asked, my stomach tightening. Lennox, the eldest of the triplets, rarely summoned me unless it was important. And rarely for anything good.

¬†

Bala shrugged. ""Not exactly, but he seemed really furious.""

¬†

A lump formed in my throat, but I forced myself to stay composed. Without another word, I turned and made my way to Lennox's room.

¬†

When I reached his door, I hesitated for a moment before knocking. Instantly, His authoritative voice ordered me in.

¬†

# CREATORS' THOUGHTS¬†Sugarlitics

Hi Everyone!

This is my first book here. check it out and tell me what you think.

Chapter 2: Accused

¬†

Olivia's POV

¬†

Pushing the door open, I met a furious-looking Lennox waiting for me. His room was a mess. Clothes littered the floor, shoes thrown to each corner of the room. I was confused to see it in such a state because Lennox is a top-notch man when it comes to cleanliness; he loves everything tidy.

¬†

The moment he noticed my presence, he turned to me, and our eyes met. I could see anger and hatred for me in his eyes, and this baffled me because, among the triplets, Lennox was the closest to me when we were little. Back then, when my father was still a respectable warrior, he would bring me to the pack house to watch him train, and on various occasions, my path crossed with the triplets. I was just seven years old then, and they were twelve years old, but we turned out to be great friends. In fact, I visited the pack house more often, and while my father trained other warriors, I played with the triplets.

¬†*2*

But that was before.

¬†

Before everything fell apart.

¬†

Just like Anita, they severed all ties, acting as though we had never been friends.

¬†

""Who cleaned my room yesterday?"" Lennox suddenly asked, his voice filled with rage that made my wolf whimper in fear inside me.

¬†

I swallowed hard in fear and forced myself to speak. ""I did.""

¬†

Lennox's expression darkened, and he took another step towards me, but out of fear, I instinctively took a step backward.

¬†

""Then tell me, Omega,"" he sneered, his voice dripping with anger, ""where is the diamond necklace I kept in my top drawer?""

¬†

I froze, my heart racing as Lennox's words sank in. A diamond necklace? I had no idea what he was talking about. My mind reeled, trying to recall if I had seen anything of the sort while cleaning his room. But all I could remember was organizing his scattered belongings, folding his clothes, and dusting the surfaces. There had been no necklace in the drawer.

¬†

""I‚Ä¶ I didn't see any necklace,"" I stammered, my voice trembling as I met his accusing gaze.

¬†*5*

Lennox's eyes narrowed. ""Don't lie to me, Omega,"" he growled, his tone laced with anger. ""The necklace didn't just grow legs and walk out of the drawer.""

¬†*2*

""I'm not lying!"" I protested, panic creeping into my voice. ""I cleaned the room, but I didn't take anything. I swear!""

¬†

He closed the distance between us instantly, towering over me with his imposing frame. ""You expect me to believe that?"" he snapped. ""You and your kind are all the same. Thieves and liars.""

¬†*5*

His words hurt me, and I felt my wolf stir with anger, but I quickly suppressed her. Defending myself against Lennox in this state would only escalate things.

¬†

""I didn't take it,"" I repeated, my voice steadier this time. ""You can search me if you don't believe me. Check my room. Check anywhere you want. I have nothing to hide.""

¬†*2*

Lennox studied me, his jaw clenched tight. For a moment, I thought he might strike me, but instead, he turned and began tearing through the room, pulling open drawers, throwing clothes onto the floor, and overturning furniture searching for the necklace.

¬†

I stood there, my lips pressed together as I fought to hold back my tears. The Lennox I had known as a child, the boy who had taught me to climb trees, The boy who used to teach me how to swim, who used to protect me from his brothers' pranks, was gone. In his place was a cold, bitter man who saw me as nothing more than a thief and a liar.

¬†*1*

Minutes later Lennox stopped searching, his breathing heavy as he stood amidst the chaos he had created. The necklace was nowhere to be found. He turned to me, his eyes blazing with frustration.

¬†

""I can't find it, Olivia. It's gone. That was a gift I got for Anita, a gift I wanted to give her on her eighteenth birthday. Do you know how much that cost me?"" he asked in anger.

¬†

I swallowed hard in fear but stood my ground. ""I did not take it‚Ä¶""

¬†

""Lies!"" he angrily cut me off.

¬†

Lennox exhaled sharply, rubbing his temple. ""This doesn't make sense,"" he muttered. ""You cleaned my room. You were the last one here."" His gaze hardened. ""Don't lie to me, Olivia. Where is it?""

¬†

When I remained silent, his eyes blazed.

¬†

""You are a thief, just like your father! A thief!"" he cursed, and I pressed my lips together, holding myself back from answering him.

¬†

Lennox's words hit me like a blow to the chest. A thief. Just like my father. It didn't matter how hard I worked, how much I tried to keep my head down and stay out of trouble, this pack would always see me as the daughter of a disgraced warrior.

¬†

""Only two people came into this room yesterday,"" Lennox continued, his voice low and sharp, like the growl of his wolf ready to pounce. ""You and Anita. So, tell me, Olivia, who else could have taken it?""

¬†

I stiffened at his words, the pieces clicking together in my mind. Anita. Of course. She had been in his room yesterday. I remembered seeing her standing by his dresser, pretending to admire a framed photograph.

¬†

I knew Anita better than anyone else. She was cunning, always looking for ways to get what she wanted. I remembered the time she stole a pack warrior's silver bracelet, only to cry her way out of trouble. Or the time she framed a servant for breaking the Alpha's Favorite vase, earning the poor girl a week in the dungeons.

¬†

And now, she had done it again. But this time, I was her scapegoat.

¬†

Who would dare enter Lennox's room and steal something so valuable?

¬†

No one.

¬†

No one except Anita.

¬†

But the words were heavy on my tongue. I couldn't say it. Not to Lennox. If I accused Anita, I'd only make things worse for myself. No one would believe me. Lennox would defend her, just like everyone else did.

¬†

""I didn't take it,"" I said again.

¬†

Lennox let out a bitter laugh, shaking his head. ""You think I'm stupid, don't you?""

¬†

I bit back a retort, my wolf growling in frustration. I wanted to scream the truth at him, to tell him that Anita was far from the innocent, perfect girl he thought she was. But I couldn't. Not without proof. And even if I had proof, it wouldn't matter. Anita had the triplets wrapped around her finger.

¬†

""You know what, Olivia?"" Lennox sneered, taking another step toward me. ""I'm done wasting my time with you. If that necklace doesn't turn up by the end of the day, I'll make sure you and your mother are punished. Severely.""

¬†

His words sent a chill down my spine, but I stood my ground, meeting his gaze. ""I didn't take it,"" I repeated one last time, my voice steady despite the fear coursing through me.

¬†

Lennox glared at me for a moment longer before turning away, his shoulders tense with rage. ""I give you until the end of today to return that necklace. Get out,"" he growled.

¬†

I didn't need to be told twice. I turned and left the room, my heart pounding as I walked down the hallway. Once I was far enough away, I leaned against the wall, my legs trembling beneath me.

¬†

Anita. She had to be the one who took the necklace. I knew it in my gut. But how could I prove it without putting myself in even more danger? The triplets wouldn't believe me, and Anita would just deny it, twisting the situation to make me look like the villain.

¬†

""Here you are, Olivia,"" a guard said as he walked over to me. ""Levi is looking for you, and he doesn't seem happy.""

¬†

The guard's announcement made my heart sink in fear.

¬†

""Why? What happened?"" I asked, terrified.

¬†

Joshua, the guard, shook his head. ""I don't know, Olivia, but he is really furious and demanding for you.""

¬†

Shit! What could it be this time?

Chapter 3: Under The Sun

¬†

Olivia's POV

¬†

""Start talking, Olivia‚Ä¶ before I lose my patience,"" Levi demanded, his voice laced with anger.

¬†

I stood frozen, unable to form words as I struggled to process the accusation. Again. I was being accused of stealing‚Äîagain.

¬†

""Olivia!"" His voice thundered through the room. ""Don't make me lose my patience! Where is the bundle of dollar notes I kept in my drawer? Speak, you thief!""

¬†*5*

My eyes widened in shock. But Before I could respond, the door to Levi's room burst open, and Louis stormed in, seething with rage.¬†

*1*

""Olivia, where is the money I kept in my drawer?"" Louis demanded.

¬†*1*

I took a step back, my breath hitching as both Levi and Louis glared at me with fiery rage. My heart pounded in my chest‚Äînot out of guilt, but out of sheer disbelief. This wasn't happening. Not again.

¬†

""I didn't take anything,"" I managed to say, my voice trembling.

¬†

Levi scoffed, running a frustrated hand through his hair. ""Really? Then tell us who else could have taken it. Who else enters our room if not you?""

¬†*1*

Louis folded his arms, his frown deepening. ""Don't play innocent, Olivia. Just return the money and save us all the drama.""

¬†

Tears gathered in my eyes, but I refused to let them fall. At least not now.

¬†

Swallowing the lump in my throat, I forced myself to speak. ""I didn't take your money,"" I repeated, louder this time, my voice shaking with suppressed emotion. ""I would never steal from any of you.""

¬†

""Liar!""

¬†

I flinched at the new voice and turned to see Lennox standing at the doorway. His eyes, filled with cold hatred, locked onto mine.

¬†

""The necklace I bought for Anita is missing too,"" he announced, turning to his brothers.

¬†

All three of them‚ÄîLevi, Louis, and Lennox‚Äîlooked at me as if I were the worst kind of filth.

¬†

Levi was the first to walk toward me, and out of panic, I tried to run away, but it was useless. I was surrounded by the triplets.¬†

Levi pinned me against the wall, lifting my hands above my head while his burning glare was staring right into my eyes.

¬†

""This is your last chance to confess and return what you stole, or you'll be dealt with accordingly,"" he threatened.

¬†

A tear slid down my cheek as I met his angry gaze. I knew, regardless of what I said, they would never believe that I didn't steal from them. They would never believe that their precious Anita was the one stealing from them.

¬†

""One‚Ä¶ two‚Ä¶"" Levi began counting, and all I could do was shed more tears.

¬†

I sobbed silently, knowing the punishment for stealing in this household was brutal. Some thieves were thrown into the dungeons, like my father. Others had their hands chopped off. Some faced even worse fates.

¬†

As Levi counted, my mind raced. Would I end up like my father, rotting in a dungeon? Or worse?¬†

""Ten.""

¬†

He released my wrists and took a step back.

¬†

""She's just like her father‚Äîa stubborn thief,"" Lennox sneered. More tears slipped down my cheeks.

¬†

""Guards! Bring some maids!"" Louis ordered sharply.

¬†

As we waited for the arrival of the maids, my heart raced in my chest. What were these men going to do to me? Why were they sending for maids?¬†

*2*

My gaze met Lennox's, and he glared at me with so much hate, which made me wonder‚Äîdid he really hate me just because my father was accused of stealing? Was this all about it, or was there something else involved? How could a man who once cherished me now look at me with such disgust?

¬†*1*

Three maids walked in and bowed their heads to the triplets.

¬†

Levi was the one to usher the punishment. ""Take her to the mansion rooftop. Strip her and apply pepper to her naked body. Make sure she kneels under the sun.""

¬†*3*

A tear slid down my cheek, but I didn't say a word. Compared to what was done to anyone accused of stealing, this was a lesser punishment for me.

¬†

""Take her away,"" Lennox demanded coldly.

¬†

The maids took hold of my arms and led me out of the room. I didn't struggle. There was no point. As we walked through the mansion, I saw my mother. She was sobbing, her entire body trembling, but she didn't dare approach me. If she did, she'd share my punishment.

¬†

When we reached the rooftop, the maids let go of me.

¬†

""Please undress,"" one of them urged softly.

¬†

I hesitated, my entire body trembling, but there was no escape. Swallowing hard, I began removing my clothes, my tears falling freely.

¬†

One of the maids picked up a bowl of ground pepper and moved closer. My body tensed.

¬†

The moment the first handful of pepper touched my skin, an agonized scream tore from my lips. My body convulsed as the fiery sting spread across my skin. They rubbed it everywhere‚Äîevery inch of my exposed flesh except for my face. The burning sensation was unbearable. My knees buckled, but I forced myself to stay upright.

¬†*3*

""You have to kneel,"" one of the maids said.

¬†

I hesitated, but my body was already giving in. Slowly, I sank to my knees, my sobs wracking my entire being. The scorching sun hit down on me, intensifying the torment. My entire body felt like it was on fire.

¬†

How could anyone be so cruel?

¬†

I wanted to scream, to beg for the pain to stop, but I knew it would only make things worse.

¬†

It was as if the sun was against me because it began to heat even more. My whole body was burning with pain, and it felt like I would pass out soon. The pain was unbearable. I had never imagined I would go through such torture.

¬†

With tear-filled eyes, I looked at the maids who stood in a corner, staring at me with pity. Painful tears trickled down my cheeks while my entire body burned. As the excruciating pain enveloped me, my vision blurred, and my head spun.

¬†

Painful memories flashed through my mind. The triplets used to adore me. They used to fight over who got to spend more time with me. They used to playfully argue about which one of them would marry me when we grew up.

¬†

How did everything change so drastically?

¬†

How did men who once cherished me suddenly hate me so much?

¬†

I wished my father hadn't been framed. I wished he had been proven innocent. Then, maybe‚Ä¶ maybe, the triplets wouldn't hate me this much.

¬†

The fiery sting of the pepper intensified, searing every inch of my exposed skin. I struggled to remain upright, my knees weakening beneath me. With each agonizing breath, the world seemed to tilt and sway until, finally, I could no longer fight the overwhelming sensation of nausea and torment.

¬†

My body gave way, and I crumpled to the ground. Distant voices called my name, but I was already slipping into darkness, into the past. Into the days when the triplets swore they'd protect me. Back when they fought over who would marry me, not who would break me. But those boys were gone. And so was I.

¬†

I did a wrong calculation. the issue happened on her fourteenth birthday. so it‚Äôs four years ago. not five. anywhere you see it as five years please call out my attention. I will correct it.

Chapter 4: sharing

¬†

Lennox's POV

¬†

An uncomfortable silence hung in the air as neither my brothers nor I spoke. The tension was thick, almost suffocating. An uneasy feeling settled in my chest as my thoughts drifted to Olivia‚Äîto the pain she might be going through. A part of me wanted to stop the punishment, to let it go. But if I did, it would show weakness, a soft spot for her. And I didn't want that. I couldn't afford that. Not after what she did to me.

¬†*6*

""I wonder what she plans to do with all the things she stole,"" Levi spat, his voice sharp with anger, breaking the silence.

¬†

I turned to look at him, noticing the anger in his eyes. He was just as pissed as I was.

¬†

""Maybe she has a boyfriend she plans to give them to,"" Louis grunted.

¬†

The mere thought of that sent a sharp, uncomfortable pain through my chest, but I shoved it down and stood abruptly. ""Tell the guards to search her things. Perhaps they're still in her room.""

¬†

Without waiting for a response, I left the room, heading back to mine.

¬†

The mess I had created in my earlier frustration still littered in my room‚Äîbroken glass, overturned furniture, scattered papers. I ignored it and walked straight to the minibar, grabbing a bottle of whiskey. Uncorking it, I took a long swig, feeling the burn slide down my throat.

¬†

With a sigh, I sank onto the bed, but no matter how hard I tried, my thoughts kept drifting back to Olivia. The punishment she was enduring on the rooftop. I glanced at the window‚Äîthe sun was scorching.

¬†

""If you're so worried about her, then stop the punishment."" My wolf's voice rumbled in my head.

¬†

I clenched my jaw. ""Why should I? Did she think about how I felt years ago when she hurt me? When she said those things?""

¬†*2*

The door to my room pushed open, and Anita stepped inside. Her brows furrowed as she took in the mess in my room before her gaze landed on the whiskey bottle in my hand.

¬†

""Lennox, are you drinking because of the missing necklace?"" she asked, concern lacing her voice.

¬†

I swallowed hard. No. The necklace wasn't why I was drowning myself in whiskey. It was Olivia. But I couldn't say that to Anita.

¬†

""Yes. It was a gift for you,"" I murmured instead.

¬†

Anita sighed and walked closer, kneeling before me. Gently, she took the bottle from my hand and placed it aside before looking directly into my eyes.

¬†

""You don't have to do this to yourself over a necklace. You can always get me another one, right?"" she said, her voice soft, comforting.

¬†*4*

And she was right. Money wasn't the issue. My brothers and I were the sons of the richest Alpha in the world and soon to be Alphas. A stolen diamond necklace shouldn't be enough to put me in this mood.

¬†

""Or‚Ä¶"" Anita tilted her head, her gaze searching mine. ""Is there something else bothering you?"" Anita asked, raising a suspicious brow.

¬†

I quickly shook my head.

¬†

She studied me for a moment before a slow smirk curled her lips. ""I know exactly what you need.""

¬†

Before I could ask what she meant, she reached for the hem of her dress and pulled it over her head, letting the fabric fall to the floor. My gaze traveled over her exposed skin, the smooth curves of her body.

¬†

""Come on,"" she whispered, her voice sultry. ""Let me help you take out your frustration.""

¬†

I said nothing as she unclasped her bra, letting it slide off her shoulders. Then, she moved closer, pressing her body against mine. Her hands traced down my chest, her fingers slowly unbuttoning my shirt before pushing it off.

¬†

""Use me, Lennox,"" she breathed, tilting her head up to meet my gaze. ""Pour all your anger into me. Take what you need.""

¬†

A dark hunger stirred inside me‚Äîthe need to lose myself, to forget everything‚Äîeven if just for a moment. I grabbed the back of her neck, pulling her into a bruising kiss. She gasped against my lips, but I didn't slow down. I pushed her back onto the bed, climbing over her, my body pressing her into the mattress. I ran hungry and angry kisses all over her body before pulling away and standing before her.

¬†

Anita lay back on the bed, her legs spread, her body on full display for me. Her smirk was teasing, her eyes dark with anticipation. She knew what I wanted‚Äîwhat I needed‚Äîand she was more than willing to give it to me.

¬†

I didn't waste time. My belt hit the floor with a sharp clink, and I shoved my pants down, my cock already hard and aching. I crawled onto the bed, grabbing Anita's ankles and yanking her closer, making her gasp in surprise.

¬†

""So rough, so dominant,"" she purred, but I wasn't in the mood for her teasing.

¬†

I wrapped my fingers around her throat, squeezing just enough to make her gasp. ""Shut up,"" I growled, watching her eyes widen with excitement.

¬†

Her lips parted, her breath hitching as I tightened my grip just a little more. ""Yes, Master,"" she whispered.

¬†

That sent a dark thrill through me. I released her throat and grabbed her hips, flipping her onto her stomach in one swift motion. She barely had time to brace herself before I yanked her up onto her knees, positioning her exactly how I wanted.

This is my first post here so go easy on me if i don't have all my facts straight, also english isn't my first language so excuse any grammatical errors on my side. 

A little about me, im 21 years old and have been, what would be considered im my country of residence, very obese for most of my life. I tried numerous times to loose weight, succeeded a couple times but somehow never got below 100kg (220 lbs).   
Im a big boy with a wide frame and im around 190cm (6'3), i don't even want to be skinny just not be morbidly obese.

My weight at the start of my weight loss journey 2 weeks ago was 145kg (320 lbs). I started intermittent fasting (18 hour fast / 6 eating window) and tracking my calories maticoulisaly. Im using an app called Yazio, i don't know if thats just a regional thing but it is pretty popular where i live. It allows me to enter my Values and gives me my estimated Calorie Budget.   
The problem that i have is that i feel like the calculations are a little of. At the moment im not very active since i mostly sit for my job but try to get my 5 - 10k steps a day.  It still suggests that i eat 2550(!) kcal per day to loose 2 lbs / 1 kg a week (i know thats a lot) which i feel like  is way to much. Goal weight is 99kgs (218 lbs) for now. 

I like intermittent fasting because it worked for me in past attempts to loose weight but now i also have the determination to stick with it. It helps my to stabilise my energy levels and control my appetite.

Since i feel like 2550 kcals is to much per day im trying to stay around 1800 - 2000, i expected to feel like crap as i usually did when i tried this in the past but i feel great? My energy levels are great, not that many cravings and in general no real hunger to speak of. 

I also want to start to lift weights again since i enjoyed that in the past but i usually get REALLY hungry if i do my usual 1,5 - 2 hour lifts, so im gonna wait a bit till i feel i can handle that.

As for dietary restrictions, i try to eat whole foods and lots of high quality animal protein and i quit drinks that contain calories (only water, unsweetened tea and black coffee now).

As of today i lost around 6kg (13 lbs) which i would assume is mostly water weight.

So i guess what im asking is, if my maintenance Calories are supposedly around 3500 kcal how can i feel completely fine with as little as 1800 kcals a day? 

Also i would just be thankful for any advice or critique to get some perspective on what i have been doing so far since i feel like im just winging it at the moment.

Thank you guys so much in advance and have a great day!",1,1751627278.0,loseit,3,0.6,False

While reading many of these posts, I started to do a very deep introspective of my experiences with ""paranormal activities"".

So I came up with 2 situations, but still I don\`t believe it was anything paranormal, just some sort of short term memory induced thoughts. 

1st Occurrence.

I have a family of four, mom, dad, my brother and I. When this happened my brother was 18y while I was 11y. 

Bro had a very detailed and realistic dream of a nun trying to get into his bedroom through the window, while we were living on the 3rd floor of a building. 

Next day, my brother told this nightmare to my mom while drinking coffee in the kitchen, while I was asleep.

That night, I dreamed about the same nun trying to get through my window. I woke up scared and hugged the wall, covering myself with a blanket trying to get to sleep again, while I can swear I felt the matters moving like someone just sat on it. At that point I was so scared that I jumped out of the bed and when to my parents bedroom to sleep.

The very next day, my mom asked me what I dreamed about and I explained her the entire scenario, while she did not react to it, she know me and my brother had the same dream. 

On the 3rd night, my mom dreamed about this nun too. She was getting home from work and while taking the buss, a old woman, looking nun like got caught between the doors and my mom screamed for the driver to open the doors. When the nun lifted her head up and made I contact with my mom, it was the moment that my mom recognized her and started screaming for the driver to drive off. 

After that, my mom did not alarm me or my brother, instead she booked for us a trip to a very famous church in my country. So, we went on the trip and we went to a priest and all of us explained what we have dreamed of in detail. The priest kind of shrug it off saying it was the St Marie trying to get into our house to prevent anything harmful happening. I didn\`t really believed him, because I knew the feeling I got during that night was not peaceful, but I was scared af. One thing is for sure, he did some chanting to ""cure"" me for the fear of darkness and since then I have never ever felt scared in the dark ever again. To the point of today, while I do ""fun"" activities with my friends, exploring abandoned buildings and places for the fun of it, all my friends are scared af, while I could not give a fk about any ghost conspiracy, moving from a dark room to a tunnel without hesitation. 

I would describe my second experience, but I already typed too much on this one lol. ",1,1751627221.0,Paranormal,1,1.0,False

It‚Äôs like the first spark before the fire, a still frame that signals something is coming ‚Äî a glimpse, a whisper, a breath of the story before it unfolds.

While most of the world is posting polished perfection or manufactured chaos, James offers something different: a photo that feels like it was taken in silence ‚Äî not for attention, but for meaning. A misty cabin. Clovis standing guard. The truck in the middle of the driveway. 

One image that somehow says everything without trying to say anything at all. And in that moment, the weekend begins. Not with noise, but with expectation*.*

Because that single photo carries a quiet weight: it means the next chapter of the story is almost here.

By the time Saturday rolls around ‚Äî 6 a.m. EST ‚Äî I‚Äôm already awake, coffee in hand, waiting. Not because it‚Äôs flashy, but because it matters. Because for a few minutes, I get to step out of the digital chaos and into something real. Into a place where nature doesn‚Äôt compete with noise ‚Äî it commands stillness, and every nail driven into wood has purpose behind it.

That Friday post is the beacon. The signal fire. And the video that follows? That‚Äôs the pilgrimage.

It‚Äôs not just a YouTube upload ‚Äî it‚Äôs an invitation into a way of life most of us are aching for.

1lrfztf,https://youtu.be/9amYVSYEuek,3 Very Scary TRUE Craigslist Horror Stories,"# ""One Quick Sale"":

Our house on Edgewood Drive in Tacoma was our sanctuary. It was a modest two-story home with a small garden out front, where the boys loved to play catch. James, my husband, and I had built a life here for over a decade, raising our sons, Tommy and Alex, who were 10 and 14. The neighborhood was quiet, the kind where you waved at neighbors and left your doors unlocked. That sense of safety made what happened feel like a nightmare we couldn‚Äôt wake from.

It started with a simple decision. James had inherited a diamond ring from his grandmother‚Äîa beautiful piece with a large center stone framed by smaller diamonds. It was stunning, but I rarely wore it, and with the economy tight, we needed money for home repairs. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs sell it on Craigslist,‚Äù James suggested one evening, his eyes bright with optimism. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll go fast, and we‚Äôll have the cash we need.‚Äù I hesitated, uneasy about inviting strangers into our lives, but James was confident. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a quick sale,‚Äù he assured me. So, he posted the ad, describing the ring and setting a fair price.

The next day, we got several responses. One group stood out‚Äîa couple and their friends, they said, looking for an engagement ring. They seemed eager, asking detailed questions about the ring‚Äôs carat weight and condition. James arranged for them to come by the following afternoon, April 28, 2010. I spent the morning tidying the house, wanting it to look welcoming. Tommy and Alex were sprawled on the living room couch, playing video games, their laughter filling the air. James was in the garage, polishing the ring one last time.

Around 3 PM, the doorbell rang. I was in the kitchen, slicing apples for a snack. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get it,‚Äù James called, heading to the door. I heard him greet the visitors, his voice warm and friendly. A moment later, he returned with four people: two men and two women. The men were in their twenties, one with a shaved head and tattoos snaking up his arms, the other with messy brown hair and a goatee. The women were younger, one with long blonde hair, the other with dark curls. They introduced themselves, but their names‚ÄîKiyoshi, Joshua, Amanda, Clabon‚Äîblurred in my mind. They seemed polite, if a bit nervous, which I chalked up to the awkwardness of buying something valuable from strangers.

‚ÄúNice to meet you,‚Äù James said, shaking hands. ‚ÄúThis is my wife, and those are our boys, Tommy and Alex.‚Äù The boys glanced up from their game, offering shy waves before returning to the screen. We led the group to the dining table, where James opened the velvet box to reveal the ring. The women gasped, admiring its sparkle, while the men asked about its authenticity and price. Everything felt normal, like any other sale. I started to relax, thinking we‚Äôd made the right choice.

Then, without warning, the man with the shaved head reached into his jacket and pulled out a handgun. He pointed it at James, his face hardening. ‚ÄúThis is a robbery,‚Äù he said, his voice flat and cold, like he‚Äôd rehearsed it.

My heart stopped. I looked at James, whose eyes widened in shock. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù he stammered, stepping in front of me.

‚ÄúShut up and don‚Äôt move,‚Äù the man snapped. The other man, with the goatee, pulled out a second gun and aimed it at the boys. ‚ÄúYou kids, stay still,‚Äù he growled. Tommy whimpered, clutching Alex‚Äôs arm. I wanted to run to them, but my legs felt like lead.

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù I whispered, my voice shaking. ‚ÄúTake the ring and go. Don‚Äôt hurt us.‚Äù

The man with the shaved head smirked. ‚ÄúOh, we‚Äôre taking more than that.‚Äù

The blonde woman stepped forward, pulling zip ties from a bag. ‚ÄúGet on the floor, all of you,‚Äù she ordered. Her voice was sharp, like she was used to giving commands. We had no choice. James helped the boys lie down on the living room carpet, then took my hand as we followed. The carpet smelled faintly of the lemon cleaner I‚Äôd used that morning, a cruel reminder of normalcy. My hands trembled as the blonde tied them behind my back, the plastic biting into my wrists.

The man with the goatee started ransacking the house, yanking open drawers and stuffing our laptops, phones, and jewelry into a duffel bag. He moved with purpose, like he‚Äôd done this before. The other woman, with the dark curls, stood watch, her eyes darting between us and the door.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do anything stupid,‚Äù the man with the shaved head warned, pacing in front of us. He held the gun loosely, but his grip tightened every time one of us moved. ‚ÄúWe just want your stuff. Cooperate, and you‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt believe him. His eyes were too cold, too empty. I glanced at James, who was whispering to the boys, trying to keep them calm. Tommy was crying silently, tears streaking his face. Alex stared at the floor, his jaw clenched. I wanted to tell them it would be okay, but the words stuck in my throat.

The man with the goatee returned, holding my wedding ring between his fingers. ‚ÄúNice,‚Äù he said, grinning. He grabbed my hand, and I tried to pull away, but he was too strong. He twisted my finger until I gasped in pain, then yanked the ring off. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt need this anymore, do you?‚Äù he taunted. Before I could respond, he kicked me in the side, hard enough to knock the breath out of me. ‚ÄúStay quiet,‚Äù he hissed.

James‚Äôs face twisted with rage. ‚ÄúLeave her alone!‚Äù he shouted, struggling against his zip ties. His voice was raw, desperate.

The man with the shaved head turned, his gun now pressed against James‚Äôs forehead. ‚ÄúYou want to be a hero?‚Äù he said, his voice low and menacing. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll count to three. One‚Ä¶‚Äù

James froze, but his eyes burned with defiance. I wanted to scream at him to stop, to stay still, but fear choked me.

‚ÄúTwo‚Ä¶‚Äù

James shifted, and I saw his wrist move‚Äîhe‚Äôd been working at the zip tie, loosening it. In a sudden burst, he freed one hand and lunged at the man, grabbing for the gun. They struggled, a blur of motion. The boys screamed, and I shouted James‚Äôs name.

Then, three gunshots shattered the air, each one louder than the last. James collapsed, blood pooling beneath him on the carpet. I screamed, a sound I didn‚Äôt recognize as my own. The blonde woman slapped me across the face. ‚ÄúShut up!‚Äù she barked.

The man with the shaved head stood over James, breathing heavily. ‚ÄúHe shouldn‚Äôt have done that,‚Äù he muttered, almost to himself. The others didn‚Äôt react, just gathered their loot‚Äîour electronics, jewelry, and my wedding ring‚Äîand headed for the door.

‚ÄúStay down, or we come back,‚Äù the man with the goatee warned. Then they were gone, the front door slamming behind them.

I lay there, sobbing, staring at James‚Äôs lifeless body. The boys were crying, their voices muffled by shock. It felt like hours before Alex, with shaking hands, managed to free himself and untie us. I crawled to James, hoping for a miracle, but his eyes were empty. I held him, my hands slick with his blood, until the police arrived.

Our home, once filled with laughter, was now a crime scene. The safety we‚Äôd taken for granted was gone, replaced by a fear that lingers in every shadow. Those four were later caught and sentenced to decades in prison, but no punishment could undo what they took from us that day.





# ""A Killer‚Äôs Job Ad"":

I was out of work, scrolling through Craigslist on my laptop, desperate for anything to keep me afloat. My savings were nearly gone, and the bills were piling up. That‚Äôs when I saw it: ‚ÄúRanch hand needed, $300 a week, room and board included. Must be hardworking and reliable.‚Äù It sounded perfect, almost too good to be true. I hesitated, but my empty bank account pushed me to pick up the phone.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù a deep voice answered.

‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm calling about the ranch hand job,‚Äù I said, trying to sound confident.

‚ÄúGreat! You interested?‚Äù the man asked, his tone warm and welcoming.

‚ÄúYeah, can you tell me more?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a small ranch. Need someone to help with animals, fix fences, basic stuff. Pay‚Äôs $300 a week, and you get a cabin to stay in. You got any experience?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot much with ranches, but I‚Äôve worked hard all my life. I‚Äôm a quick learner.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fine. Can you come for an interview tomorrow, say 10 AM?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù I said, jotting down the address he gave me. It was about an hour‚Äôs drive into the countryside. ‚ÄúSee you then.‚Äù

‚ÄúLooking forward to it,‚Äù he said, and hung up. He called himself Jack.

The next morning, I drove through winding roads, passing fields and patches of woods. The farmhouse at the address was rundown‚Äîpeeling paint, sagging porch, not at all like the tidy photo in the ad. A man stood on the porch, sipping coffee. He was tall, muscular, with a skull tattoo on his neck that made me pause.

‚ÄúYou must be the guy for the job,‚Äù he said, extending a hand. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Jack.‚Äù

I shook his hand, his grip firm. ‚ÄúNice to meet you.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome inside,‚Äù he said, leading me into a cluttered kitchen. Old newspapers were stacked on a rickety table, and the air smelled faintly of mildew. He poured me a coffee, and we sat down.

‚ÄúSo, tell me about yourself,‚Äù Jack said, leaning back. ‚ÄúWhat makes you want this job?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been out of work for a while,‚Äù I admitted. ‚ÄúUsed to work at a factory, but it closed. I‚Äôm ready to try something new, and I‚Äôm not afraid of hard work.‚Äù

He nodded, his eyes studying me. ‚ÄúGood. The job‚Äôs simple‚Äîfeed the animals, clean stables, fix things. Think you can handle it?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I can do that,‚Äù I said, sipping the bitter coffee.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs take a look around,‚Äù he said, standing up.

We walked outside, and he showed me the property. A few scrawny horses stood in a corral, and a barn loomed nearby, its red paint faded. The fields were overgrown, dotted with rusted equipment. ‚ÄúNeeds work, but it‚Äôs got potential,‚Äù Jack said, his voice casual.

I nodded, trying to seem enthusiastic, though something felt off. The place looked neglected, not like a working ranch. Still, $300 a week was hard to pass up.

He led me to a small cabin at the edge of the property. Inside, it was dusty, with a sagging bed and a tiny kitchenette. ‚ÄúThis is where you‚Äôd stay,‚Äù Jack said. ‚ÄúNot fancy, but it‚Äôs free.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôll do,‚Äù I said, forcing a smile.

As we walked back to the farmhouse, I noticed a young man by the barn, maybe in his late teens, staring at us. His face was blank, his eyes cold. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my nephew,‚Äù Jack said, noticing my glance. ‚ÄúHe helps out.‚Äù

I waved, but the nephew didn‚Äôt respond, just kept staring. A chill ran through me, but I brushed it off. I needed this job.

Back at the farmhouse, Jack said, ‚ÄúSo, you in?‚Äù

I hesitated, my gut nagging at me, but I thought of my bills. ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm in. When can I start?‚Äù

‚ÄúTomorrow,‚Äù he said, grinning. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go over the details.‚Äù

We sat at the table, and he pulled out some papers. As I skimmed them, I heard a faint click behind me. I turned, and the nephew was standing there, holding a handgun, pointed at my chest.

My heart stopped. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù I asked, my voice shaking.

Jack‚Äôs grin vanished. ‚ÄúSit down,‚Äù he said, his tone hard. ‚ÄúWe need to talk.‚Äù

I sat slowly, my eyes darting between Jack and the gun. ‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe need money,‚Äù Jack said, leaning forward. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to help us get it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand,‚Äù I said, my mouth dry.

‚ÄúYour family, they got money, right? We call them, tell them to send cash, or you‚Äôre done.‚Äù

My stomach twisted. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have family with money. My parents are gone, no siblings, no kids. It‚Äôs just me.‚Äù

Jack‚Äôs eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt lie to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not lying,‚Äù I said, my voice rising. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got nothing.‚Äù

The nephew spoke, his voice flat. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs useless then.‚Äù

Jack looked at him, then back at me. ‚ÄúGuess you‚Äôre not much help, are you?‚Äù

I knew what that meant. My mind raced, searching for a way out. The door was behind the nephew, and the windows were boarded. I was trapped.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got some savings,‚Äù I blurted out. ‚ÄúMaybe $2,000. I can get it for you.‚Äù

Jack laughed, a cold sound. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs nothing. We need real money.‚Äù

The nephew stepped closer, the gun steady. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs take him out back.‚Äù

My blood ran cold. I had to act. ‚ÄúWait, I need to use the bathroom,‚Äù I said, hoping to buy time.

Jack stared at me, then nodded. ‚ÄúMake it quick.‚Äù

The nephew gestured with the gun toward a door. I walked to the bathroom, my legs trembling, and locked the door behind me. I pulled out my phone, hands shaking, and dialed 911. Before it could connect, Jack banged on the door. ‚ÄúHurry up!‚Äù

I hung up, flushed the toilet, and ran the sink to cover my tracks. When I stepped out, Jack grabbed my arm. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go for a walk.‚Äù

The nephew kept the gun on me as we left the farmhouse and headed toward the woods. The trees closed in around us, the air thick with the smell of pine. My armpits were soaked with sweat, my heart pounding so loud I thought they‚Äôd hear it.

We walked deeper, the nephew behind me, the gun at my back. I knew what was coming. They were going to kill me out here, where no one would find me.

As we reached a dense patch of trees, I made my move. I bolted, zigzagging through the underbrush. A gunshot cracked, and pain exploded in my arm. I stumbled but kept running, blood soaking my sleeve. Behind me, Jack shouted, ‚ÄúGet him!‚Äù

I crashed through branches, my lungs burning, my arm throbbing. The woods were a blur, but I kept moving, driven by pure fear. I heard them chasing, their footsteps heavy, but I didn‚Äôt look back.

After what felt like hours, I saw a light through the trees‚Äîa house. I staggered toward it, pounding on the door. ‚ÄúHelp! Please, call the police!‚Äù

An elderly man opened the door, his eyes wide. ‚ÄúWhat happened to you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI was shot,‚Äù I gasped, clutching my arm. ‚ÄúPlease, call 911.‚Äù

He let me in, and his wife called the police while he wrapped a towel around my arm. The pain was unbearable, but I was alive. The police arrived, and I told them everything‚Äîthe ad, Jack, the nephew, the gun.

They caught the men later, and I learned their real names: Richard Beasley and Brogan Rafferty. They had lured three other men with the same ad and killed them. I was the lucky one.

The bullet had missed the bone, and after weeks in the hospital, I recovered. But the fear stayed with me. At Beasley‚Äôs sentencing, I stood in court, my voice steady. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be there when you go, smiling,‚Äù I said, staring him down. He deserved every bit of his punishment.

I don‚Äôt use Craigslist anymore. The memory of that day‚Äîthose woods, that gun‚Äîstill wakes me up at night. But I‚Äôm here, alive, and that‚Äôs what matters.





# ""Not for Sale"":

I woke up to my phone buzzing like crazy. I grabbed it, still half-asleep, and saw 12 missed calls and eight voicemails, all from numbers I didn‚Äôt know. My heart skipped a beat. Was something wrong with my family? I called my parents, but they were fine. Confused, I started listening to the voicemails.

The first was from a woman, her voice bright and eager. ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm calling about the house for sale on Craigslist. The pictures look amazing! Can you tell me more about the price and when I can come see it?‚Äù

House for sale? My house? I lived alone in a small, cozy place I‚Äôd bought a few years ago. It wasn‚Äôt for sale. I played the next voicemail. ‚ÄúHello, this is Mark from Downtown Realty. I‚Äôm interested in listing your property. It looks like a fantastic opportunity. Please call me back.‚Äù

My stomach twisted. What was happening? Another voicemail played. ‚ÄúHey, is the house still available? The ad says $25,000, which seems too good to be true. Is there a catch?‚Äù

$25,000? That was a fraction of what my house was worth. My hands shook as I opened my laptop and went to Craigslist. I typed in my city and searched for houses for sale. There it was‚Äîan ad for my house. The photos showed my living room with the new couch I‚Äôd just bought, my kitchen with last night‚Äôs dishes in the sink, and my bedroom, bed unmade. Worst of all, there was a picture of the pumpkin I‚Äôd carved last Halloween, still on my porch, and my car in the driveway. Someone had been here, taking these pictures, and recently.

I felt sick, like someone had ripped away my sense of safety. Who would do this? Why? I called the police, my voice trembling. ‚ÄúSomeone listed my house for sale on Craigslist without my permission,‚Äù I explained. ‚ÄúThey have pictures of the inside. Someone‚Äôs been in my home.‚Äù

The officer was kind but not reassuring. ‚ÄúIf the person isn‚Äôt on your property now, there‚Äôs not much we can do,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúContact Craigslist to get the ad removed. Maybe change your locks and consider security cameras.‚Äù

I spent hours on the phone with Craigslist support, navigating their automated system until the ad was finally taken down. But my phone kept ringing with people asking about the house. One man was pushy, demanding to know why I wasn‚Äôt responding to his offer. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready to pay cash,‚Äù he snapped. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the hold-up?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not for sale,‚Äù I said, my voice sharp. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a mistake.‚Äù

He huffed and hung up. I changed my number, but the unease lingered. That night, I checked every lock twice and kept the lights on. Every creak in the house made me jump. I kept picturing someone sneaking around, snapping those photos while I was at work.

The next morning, I went to grab the newspaper and froze. In the dew on the lawn, there were footprints leading from the street to my back door. They were too big to be mine, probably a man‚Äôs. My heart raced as I followed them. They stopped at the back door, which was locked, but the knob felt loose, like someone had tried to force it.

I called the police again. ‚ÄúThere are footprints outside my house,‚Äù I said, trying to stay calm. ‚ÄúSomeone was here last night.‚Äù

The officer sighed. ‚ÄúCould be kids messing around. Keep us posted if anything else happens.‚Äù

Kids? I didn‚Äôt buy it. I bought a baseball bat and kept it by my bed. I started closing the curtains during the day, feeling like eyes were on me. I posted about the incident on social media, hoping someone might know something. A friend messaged me. ‚ÄúI saw a guy near your house a few days ago,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúHe was in his 30s, wearing a baseball cap. I thought he was just passing through.‚Äù

That didn‚Äôt help much, but it confirmed my fears‚Äîsomeone was watching me. Then, a few days later, I came home from work and found a note taped to my front door. In block letters, it read: ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre alone. I‚Äôve been watching you. Leave the back door unlocked tonight, or you‚Äôll regret it.‚Äù

My knees buckled. This wasn‚Äôt a prank; it was a threat. I called the police, my voice shaking. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a note on my door,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs threatening me.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll send a car to patrol the area,‚Äù the officer said. ‚ÄúStay safe and call if anything happens.‚Äù

I barricaded the doors with chairs and set my phone to record any noises. I sat in the dark, clutching the baseball bat, listening for any sound. Around midnight, I heard it‚Äîa faint scratching at the back door, like someone was testing the lock.

I peeked through the window and saw a figure in dark clothes, fumbling with the door. My heart pounded as I dialed 911, whispering, ‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs trying to break in.‚Äù

‚ÄúStay calm,‚Äù the operator said. ‚ÄúPolice are on their way.‚Äù

I watched as the figure moved to a window, trying to pry it open. Then, sirens wailed in the distance. The figure froze, then ran, disappearing into the night.

The police arrived minutes later but found no one. They took my statement and promised more patrols, but I was done. I couldn‚Äôt stay in that house. I packed a bag and went to a friend‚Äôs place. From there, I hired a private investigator.

A week later, he called. ‚ÄúI think I found your guy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your old neighbor, the one who moved out last year. He‚Äôs got a history of obsessive behavior and was seen near your house.‚Äù

I remembered him‚Äîquiet, always keeping to himself. We‚Äôd never had issues, but apparently, he‚Äôd fixated on me after doing some repair work at my house. The police arrested him, and I learned he‚Äôd been planning to ‚Äúmove in‚Äù with me, believing we were meant to be together.

I moved to a new city, changed my name, and started over. I installed security cameras and never left my doors unlocked. But the fear lingers. Every strange noise, every unfamiliar face, reminds me how easily someone can invade your life.",1,1751626982.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

I read about TECSA and will give it time no matter how hard it is because I'm desperate for this to work.

I can barely keep my eyes open at daytime despite being on stimulant medication and coffee, that's what's saving me right now. Will it get better?

**July 4, 2025 | 11:47 AM (GMT)**

**The Matchup:**  
Linda Noskova (CZE, 27th seed) vs. Kamilla Rakhimova (RUS, 80th seed).

**The Stats:**

* **Noskova**: Struggled in her last match but boasts solid grass-court form.
* **Rakhimova**: The ""Russian Rocket"" (per no one) has surged forward with aggressive play, knocking off a two-time Grand Slam finalist.
* **Odds**:
   * **Moneyline**: Noskova (-150, implied 60%) vs. Rakhimova (+400, implied 20%).
   * **Spread**: Noskova -4.5 (1.85-1.87) / Rakhimova +4.5 (1.91-1.95).
   * **Total Games**: Over 20.5 (1.8-1.87) / Under 20.5 (1.83-1.95).

**The Props:**

* **Big Server‚Äôs Big Day**: Bet Over 20.5 total games if you‚Äôre betting Rakhimova‚Äôs aggressive style will turn this into a popcorn match. Under if you think Noskova‚Äôs precision will shut down the fireworks.

**The Prediction:**  
Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a **grass-court chess match** with a side of drama! Noskova is the favorite, but Rakhimova‚Äôs ‚ÄúI‚Äôve-got-nothing-to-lose‚Äù energy could turn this into a three-set thriller.

* **Noskova‚Äôs Edge**: Her ranking (27th vs. 80th) and recent practice with a tennis ball-throwing robot might help.
* **Rakhimova‚Äôs Wild Card**: She‚Äôs playing like a sleep-deprived barista‚Äîaggressive, erratic, and prone to spilling coffee (i.e., winners).

**Final Verdict:**  
Noskova should win in three sets, but Rakhimova will make her sweat. If you‚Äôre feeling spicy, take Rakhimova +4.5 to cover and hope she serves with the fury of a Russian winter.

**Bonus Prop Pick:**  
**Over 20.5 total games** ‚Äì Because when Rakhimova‚Äôs power meets Noskova‚Äôs inconsistency, chaos (and points) ensue.

*‚ÄúThis match isn‚Äôt about who‚Äôs better‚Äîit‚Äôs about who‚Äôs less likely to trip over their own feet.‚Äù* üéæüí•

1lrfv9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feedspace/comments/1lrfv9v/how_to_increase_online_course_sales_with_social/,How to increase online course sales with social proof: proven strategies that work,"Credibility and authenticity are the two key factors that turn a potential student into a loyal one. Selling online courses is difficult enough with the high competitor rate and innumerable options‚Äìhow do you stand out from your competitors then?

**The answer is simple: Social Proof.**

Social proof is the psychological phenomenon that encourages viewers to do what other people are already doing. Using social proof in different ways, you can easily convince potential customers to sign up for your online course.

In this blog, we‚Äôll explore how social proof and course testimonials can amplify your sales with different strategies.

Let‚Äôs begin.

**1. Understanding Social Proof for Course Creators**

**What is social proof?**

It‚Äôs a question asked by innumerable marketers. Marketers utilize social proof to encourage potential customers to successfully convert. Modern marketing makes the maximum use of social proof in multiple ways‚Äìfrom ecommerce businesses, B2B marketers and even education institutions‚Äìall of them leverage social proof as a powerful tool.

Social proof is a phenomenon where people get influenced to make buying decisions based on the behaviour of others that came before them. When we consider online courses, a student will be more likely to sign up if they see other students who are similar to them.

Social proof validates their choice of signing up for your course and ultimately results in increased signups for you as a company.

There are different types of social proof that you can leverage. You can collect reviews, testimonials (yes, reviews and testimonials are different!), case studies, social media reviews, and a lot more.

In fact, celebrity endorsements and influencer collaborations also fall under the category of social proof for your company. Even when you proudly display the number of people that have signed up for a course, it can be considered as social proof.

**2. Collecting and Showcasing Course Testimonials**

Online course marketing requires strategy, planning and execution of each fundamental step effortlessly. If you wish to showcase testimonials from your previous students, you must know how to collect and showcase them on your platform.

**What are the Best Ways to Request Testimonials From Students?**

The very first step you must take is to request testimonials from your students. Knowing when to ask for a testimonial is just as important as knowing what to ask.

But to start off, you must have clearly defined the goals you wish to achieve with the testimonials you collect. Decide whether you want to put them on different platforms? Is it a marketing campaign that you wish to execute using the collected testimonials? Or something else entirely.

Based on where you want to reach, you can take the first step. The best way to ask for a testimonial involves being genuine, clear and direct about your approach. Here are some factors to consider:

* **Timing matters:**¬†When you are asking for the testimonial is important to how the student responds. Asking right after they have expressed a positive view or after they have successfully completed the course can be incredibly helpful.¬†
* **Personalization:**¬†Personalizing your request makes your student feel valued. Ensure that you use their name and keep track of what they say. Personalizing the request fosters a sense of community and shows your dedication towards providing students with positive experiences.
* **Value their time:**¬†Keep the review short, simple and to the point. Long review questions can get boring and eventually answer simply for the sake of it. Instead, ask creative questions that encourage respondents to think. Open-ended questions also bring in excellent responses.¬†
* **Channel:**¬†Choose your channel of communication wisely. If your respondent is comfortable responding over text, ask for a review over text. Email requests are also excellent ways to collect testimonials from students.
* **Comfort:**¬†Don‚Äôt be too pushy or sound too aggressive about how you want the respondent to answer, let it flow naturally. Pose your questions in ways that allow for unbiased responses. Ensure that your questions are not misleading in any way.¬†
* **Sportsman spirit:**¬†Even if you receive criticism, ensure that you take it well with a positive attitude and improve upon it. Negative feedback always comes with an opportunity to learn. Follow up with the concerned individual and show them the progress you‚Äôve made, this mindset will foster growth and loyalty among past customers.¬† 

Draft a precise questionnaire that avoids survey fatigue, prompt answers that are authentic, truthful and can generate emotional connection between the viewer and the speaker.

**Using Video Testimonials to Boost Authenticity**

Do you know the basic tenets to appear authentic in front of your audiences are:

* Storytelling
* Consistency in storytelling.
* Transparency in consistent storytelling.¬†

These three factors (and many more) largely determine how authentic you appear to the masses. However, an important detail that many miss out on, is how you communicate these factors to your audience.

How you show (not tell) your potential students that your course is legit is extremely vital. This is where video testimonials come in.

If you try to convey your courses‚Äô value via text, there is a very high chance that your audience will only retain 10% of it, as compared to using a video testimonial which increases that number to 90%.

Additionally, you might find it surprising that businesses that utilized video testimonials, generated almost 1.5X the revenue and clicks went up nearly 3X.

There‚Äôs a really simple explanation for this: humans.

When a viewer reads a text and sees a face next to it (in a textual review) they might end up thinking that the review was faked. On the other hand, if they see a person actively appreciating the course and sharing what they learnt from it in a video format, they‚Äôll be more than likely to think that what the person is stating is 100% true.

All in all, video testimonials are the ultimate form of social proof especially when considering authenticity.

**Displaying Testimonials Effectively on the Landing Page**

The testimonials and reviews you collect can be used on Landing pages and sales pages too. Using a tool like Feedspace can allow you to create a widget that you can embed in your website in minimal steps. Put them in places on your landing page where it is immediately visible. Don‚Äôt add too many testimonials to avoid overwhelming the visitor, but do ensure that it stands out.

Testimonials that show a student‚Äôs name, their role in the industry, and other relevant details are important elements when showcasing a testimonial to build credibility. Incorporate various testimonial types on your landing page. These are the ones that perform the best:

* **Video testimonials:**¬†Testimonials in any format can be incredibly effective in brining in increased enrollments.
* **Case studies:**¬†Shows how your course positively impacted students‚Äô lives or helped them develop a skill or solve a problem or deepen their understanding of the subject.¬†
* **Celebrity/Industry Expert endorsements:** A household name that endorses your course can significantly boost your and your course‚Äôs integrity.
* **Text-based testimonials (especially the ones that are from a social media platform):** These are effective in convincing readers that people love and appreciate your course enough to leave behind a review.¬†

Remember, high-quality, informative and concise testimonials will provide greater leverage in convincing potential students to enroll for your course as compared to average ones.

**3. Leveraging User-Generated Content & Reviews**

Our next-in-line strategy is leveraging user-generated content and reviews.

**What is user-generated content?**¬†  
Content that is developed by your students. Content derived when students post about how your course impacted their career positively is titled as ‚Äòuser-generated content (UGC)‚Äô i.e., content generated by someone who has experienced the particular business.

**Here‚Äôs two ways you can utilize content generated by your students:**

**#1 Social media:**

Motivate students to share their experience on social media. They can share a review or you can make it engaging and fun by creating a hashtag or a contest. Social media can be a great way to showcase your course content, engage with students and establish an identity for yourself.

Many course creators utilize tools to search for creative content that has already been posted by students and reach out to them to ask for permission to reuse the content as social proof for their marketing.

**Industry:** Arts and crafts, DIY tutorials, marketing and media courses, photography courses.

**#2 Success stories:**

Highlight student‚Äôs success stories in your marketing campaigns. Show your potential students how your course has impacted students that have enrolled for your course. You can get your student‚Äôs insights about how the course helped them achieve their goals.

You can create a case-study type testimonial (varying in format like text or video) too. These stories can be shared on platforms like reddit, X (formerly twitter) or even Facebook and Instagram pages. Celebrating your student‚Äôs success story fosters a sense of community among your students and attracts new students to your course.

**Industry:** Finance, marketing, IT courses, courses based on skill learning and development.

**4. Using Social Media & Community Engagement as Social Proof**

Social media marketing is incredibly important when it comes to selling courses online. In fact, to accurately depict the value of your course, social media is the best course. It allows you to set the tone for the course, reach out to vast audiences and promote engagement.

Platforms like¬†**LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram**¬†are excellent ways to reach audiences your ads might not reach.

Like we mentioned above, you can even utilize¬†**branded hashtags**¬†to create excitement around achievements. You can incentivize it by¬†**hosting giveaways or offering prizes**¬†(ensure you remain ethical though!).

Using social media to boost engagement creates a sense of community. This allows you to stay in touch with your past students and even creates a sense of loyalty and belonging amongst different batches.

Additionally, you can use platforms like Quora and Reddit to participate in community events and discussions. These will help you stay up to date with the current market sentiments. These platforms give you a space to establish yourself as a community leader and thus an expert on your subject matter.

**5. Featuring Industry Endorsements & Influencers**

As a course creator, partnering with influencers or featuring industry experts is an excellent way to establish yourself as a mogul in the course-creators industry.

However, when choosing someone to work with, you must keep these factors in mind:

* Find someone whose image and brand aligns with your course‚Äôs content.
* Ensure that they are indeed an expert in the industry and are well-established as a household name.¬†
* A leading expert that has a social media presence that can be leveraged to market your course.
* Set clear contractual agreements with the expert and measure their potential reach across all platforms to leverage maximum value.¬†

Industry experts will boost your courses‚Äô awareness and visibility. It can boost the credibility and legitimacy of your course‚Äìespecially when a well known celebrity in the industry with a large and engaged audience does it.

An underlying benefit of collaborating with a famous personality is that the audience forms a connection between your brand and the celebrity‚Äìwhich follows long after the contract has expired.

The audience's perception becomes positively influenced and continues to remain the same for a long time, since they associate it with the expert‚Äôs positive brand image (think Nike‚Äôs Air Jordan 1s and Micheal Jordan).

**6. Integrating Social Proof in Email & Paid Marketing**

The next strategy on our list is email and paid marketing.¬†

Blending social proof into your email marketing campaign might be the sure shot way of bringing in increased enrollments for your course. Statistics show that for every $1 spent on email marketing, ROI is nearly worth $38.

Periodically sending an email to your students is a great way to ensure that your students remember you without being too nosy and interruptive. The idea of setting up an email marketing strategy is to turn first-time website visitors into students and first-time enrollers into full-time loyal students.

Adding testimonials in your email‚Äôs content is a great way to guarantee enrollments. Using an¬†excerpt¬†of a testimonial left behind by your student in the body of your email or integrating a review catchphrase into the subject line can highlight the value of your course.

If you wish to use media or social media posts in your emails‚Äìturn them into GIFs! GIFs are easy to embed and convey the same message without taking up too much space and time.

On the other hand, social proof in paid advertisements can play a pivotal role in raising conversions. Research indicates that while 40% of people trust a paid advertisement to deliver the desired results, the number goes up to 70% when paid ads feature reviews.

Social proof in Meta or Google ads can skyrocket your enrollments. Here are a few ways social proof can be used in paid advertising:

* **Using video testimonials:** Using video testimonials on platforms like Youtube or Facebook can significantly enhance engagement and empower all the benefits of using a video test¬†
* **Micro-influencers:** Collaborate on social media platforms with micro-influencers (that target a specific audience/niche) and pay them to advertise your course.¬†

Using these tactics you can easily promote your content across different channels of paid advertising and bring in a higher number of enrollments. Paid advertising can help you target extremely specific audiences that you can leverage to your benefit.

**7. Creating a 'Wall of Love' for Your Course**

Imagine a dedicated space on the internet that displays all the ‚Äòlove‚Äô you have received for your course. That is exactly what ‚ÄòWall of Love‚Äô is. A wall of love is where a visitor can view real student feedback that you have received.

A wall of love is an excellent way to collectively showcase the reviews and testimonials you collected from your students. It is commonly used by innumerable e-commerce businesses that function primarily through online platforms.

Using a wall of love can help your potential students realize how your course has impacted the lives of your students in a positive way. It is also known as a testimonial wall. Not only does it create a sense of community using your brand, but it also elevates your online presence and improves your brand image in the industry.

Want to see real results? Check out how Smart Up Academy used reviews as social proof.

Businesses like ‚ÄòBuy me a coffee‚Äô effectively leverage their Wall of Love to enhance customer‚Äôs trust in the brand. They have combined multi-media testimonials that they received from creators and users alike from platforms like YouTube, X (Twitter) and TikTok.

Their wall of love showcases genuine appreciation, has a culmination of different testimonials and experiences and can boost authentic connections.

It is incredibly important to integrate testimonials in different media formats to keep your wall of love engaging and communicative. Integrate audio reviews, reviews from social media platforms, and especially video reviews.

Stressing about the excess workload that multi-media testimonial collection brings?

Don‚Äôt worry‚Äìwe‚Äôve got your back.

The simplest way to do this is using a testimonial collection tool like Feedspace. Not only does Feedspace help you collect testimonials in video, audio or text format using a single link, but also simplifies the process of creating a Wall of Love for your website that you can easily embed (without needing technical knowledge).

Additionally, if you don‚Äôt have a website, you can still create a 'Wall of Love' page to showcase testimonials. You can also add a button for users to register for your course.Give it a shot‚Äìits simple, easy-to-understand UI can elevate testimonial collection while minimising your effort.

**8. The Role of Third-Party Review Platforms**

Third-party review platforms are the most powerful way to mitigate hesitation in your students. Seeing reviews on platforms like Udemy, Coursera or Skillshare informs the viewer that the reviews are unbiased and authentic.

While testimonials on your website influence the final stage of the decision-making process, testimonials on a third-party platform are a stronger form of social proof since these platforms are more likely to have unbiased, credible reviews.

You must encourage your students to leave ratings on platforms like Udemy, Coursera and other course marketplaces to ensure a well-rounded course (brand) identity is established. Moreover, using external validation for authority will strengthen your credibility and over time bring in more enrollments.

One thing to keep in mind is that when you get a review, you must respond. Even if it is a negative review, or a review tainted with criticism for your course, you must professionally respond and take notes as to what can be improved.

Testimonials are not just to proudly display how far you‚Äôve come, rather they are great tools to learn what your students really think about your course. Since online course creators are rarely able to interact with students in person, feedback and reviews are the only ways which can allow you to peep inside a student‚Äôs mind.

**9. Measuring the Impact of Social Proof on Course Sales**

Our last and most important strategy is to measure the impact of all the strategies above.

You must have considered altering different strategies to fit your particular niche, or you want to use them in conjunction with another strategy‚Äìbut none of it would mean anything if you are not able to accurately analyse what works best for you and what does not.

Strategising and implementation are two continual steps that you must keep on improving based on the audience's feedback, changing market conditions and even your own course‚Äôs growth.

Here are a few metrics you must track:

**On your website**

* **Source of traffic:** Where your audiences are coming from i.e., email, paid platforms, social media, referrals, etc.
* **Conversion rate:** The percentage of website visitors who enroll for your course.
* **Bounce rate:** The percentage of website visitors who leave without any interaction with your website.¬†

These metrics can help you assess where the most traffic comes from and which channel of marketing you should improve in.

* **Number of reviews and ratings:** Analysis of all reviews and ratings collected in a particular duration on your website and other third-party websites as well.¬†
* **Testimonial engagement:** The number of people who interact with your testimonials (signifying which testimonials are actually being read)¬†
* **Mentions:** Where your course has been talked about i.e,. Social media platforms, etc.¬†

These metrics are useful in assessing the impact that simply displaying testimonials have on enrollments.

**From Email marketing**

* **Conversion Rate:** The percentage of people who enrolled for your course through email marketing.
* **Open rate:** The percentage of people who opened your mail.¬†
* **CTR:** Percentage of people who clicked on the links in your mails.

These metrics allow you to determine how effectively your target audience is engaging, clicking on and enrolling for your course; directly from email marketing.

**Paid marketing**

* **CPA:** Cost-per-acquisition‚ÄìThe cost incurred to acquire one student through paid marketing.
* **CTR:** Click-through rate: The percentage of people who clicked on your paid ads.
* **ROAS:** Return on ad spend‚Äìthe revenue generated for every dollar spent on paid marketing.¬†

These metrics help you clearly define your current position for paid advertising channels. Deeper analysis of these metrics can help you make informed decisions in the future.

**Retention, Engagement and Satisfaction.**

* **No of Referrals:** The number of students that are enrolling based on recommendations.
* **Completion Rate:** The percentage of students who successfully complete the course.¬†
* **NPS:** Net promoter score helps you determine how likely a student is to recommend your course to someone close to them.¬† 

These metrics are crucial in determining how satisfied your students are with your course, contents and teaching methods. Based on these metrics you can identify the problem areas in your course structure and plan for improvement.

**Conclusion**

We hope that these 9 effective strategies for increasing sales with social proof prove to be incredibly useful for your online courses. Course testimonials (in video, audio and text format) are your best bet at increasing enrollments and helping students achieve their goals.

What would you do? What story would you tell?

This is interesting because there is so much you could actually do. Here‚Äôs some that I feel fit where TASM2 and NWH left off as well as what I‚Äôd do.

-The Clone Saga: bring in Ben Riley and explore the torment of not having your own life but sharing memories with someone else, a commentary on what makes us human, Andrew could pull off this duel role.

-Venom: bring in the black suit either from space or like the original Ultimate Universe, in a lab created by the Brock‚Äôs and the Parker‚Äôs, ties in the parent aspect whilst giving us Andrew in the black suit which people want.

-Miles mentorship: introduce Miles Morales and how Peter mentors him to not make the same mistakes he did when he was Spider-Man. Villains can be the Prowler and Scorpion.

Those are all fun and interesting and could work but here‚Äôs my pitch, it‚Äôs a lot more simple but has a lot to say
‚Äî‚Äî
Mary Jane Watson: this is a love story about how to fall in love again. We all know someone or are someone who had a soulmate and then they left our world. How do we fall in love again when we didn‚Äôt get chance to fall out of love to begin with. That‚Äôs what Peter is wrestling with in this story. We show that with Peter (a science teacher at Empire State University) and Mary Jane who‚Äôs down the road in the Coffee Bean who‚Äôs not full party girl but also hasn‚Äôt fully matured just yet. 
We also see it with the cheesy Doc Ock and May story but here, we take it seriously and explore how to love again from these people and how Peter wants May to be happy but also selfishly doesn‚Äôt like seeing her with someone else because he‚Äôs so close to Ben. Plus also this guy is Doc Ock and he needs to be stopped anyway.

I wrote a script on this story and what I‚Äôd do for TASM3. You can read it below.

The sun shone brightly on a January morning unlike any other. A vast army of reporters surrounded the United Nations, trying to get a glimpse of the event. But the guards fiercely defended the blockades as they became unruly, shouting, stretching their recording devices over the security limits. However, their desperation wasn‚Äôt without reason. The reporters tried to capture recordings of what might have been humanity's most vital gathering. Above them, spaceships carrying dignitaries from the United Planets, some humanoid and others who couldn‚Äôt be more different, soon landed in a designated area.

It was Daisy who provided the infrastructure for the historic gathering. After she and Carter defeated the Nemesis invasion, she was invited to a meeting of the Earth‚Äôs military powers, discussing how to fortify defenses in the contingency they return. Daisy proposed seeking help from the United Planets and even facilitated the initial meeting between Orion and the human leaders. It went well, but Orion was a military commander, not a politician. The finalization of their alliance would have to be between the human and off-worlder dignitaries.

Later that night, inside the building, the meeting room was halved with a blade of tension. The humans occupied one side and their alien counterparts on the other, and Damara stood in the middle, mediating.

‚ÄùOh, boy.‚Äù Daisy wiped the sweat off her brow.

Being a farmer by birth and a seamstress by trade, she had only the barest knowledge of politics. Daisy had spent weeks being tutored by advisers, finding it even more difficult than Everton‚Äôs combat training, but still, she was the only one both sides trusted.

""Ladies and gentlemen, I believe we have reached a fair arrangement. The humans will accept Orion Maximus as the supreme commander of the new arm.‚Äù Daisy took a deep breath. ‚ÄúBut in turn, Carter Buchanan Barnes will be given the rank of general and all its authority. Are there any more issues or grievances you would like to discuss?""

Daisy looked between both sides, sweating a storm, waiting for their responses. But they both nodded to her question. And the delegates swiftly signed a treaty on a table. As they finished, Daisy grew a big smile.

""Ladies and gentlemen, I realize this arrangement is to fend off a common doom. But as we fight against oppression on the battlefield, I hope the bonds we make will stand the test of time. And lead our galaxy to an age of lasting peace and happiness.""

As they heard Daisy, a deafening silence swept the room to such a point one could hear a pin drop. Such a degree of sincerity like hers was exceedingly rare in the realm of politics. But it broke as they slowly gave a big round of applause.

\*\*\*

A few minutes later, Daisy and Carter entered an empty room with Orion, Lucas, and Sarah.

""Orion, now that everything is official, we should start making battle plans immediately,"" Daisy said.

Orion grew a smile.""Fear not. The second we received the word, the other generals and I arranged a meeting on planet Hachiko. So please relax and enjoy this time with your loved ones.""

Daisy gasped for air, clutching her chest, freed from a mighty burden.¬†*""Sir, yes, sir.""*¬†

As Carter went to help, she kissed him, and the couple hastily began making out. With a small chuckle from Orion, he and Sarah quickly turned their gaze away from the couple. But Lucas instead burst out laughing.

""Fortis, you have the worst sense of humor.""

""Sarah, they're adorable like-""

Lucas looked at Sarah in her black dress and high-heeled shoes, blushing.""You.""

*""What?""*

""I've never seen you in a dress and high-heels before. I think I like it.""

Sarah blushed bright red back, and Orion chuckled as he saw them. But he soon stopped as he looked toward Daisy as a dire thought entered his mind.

""Daisy, have you told anyone but Carter about your dual identity?""

""No, sir. But I do plan on telling my family when I see them again. Is that okay?""

""Of course it is, but please, no one else. The more people know about this secret, the harder it will become to conceal. I don't even think it's safe to divulge it to the other generals.""

""You're worried about protecting the divinus from the Nemesis?""

""Yes. And I figured you would like some alone time now and again.""

Daisy cried tears of joy.""Yes, sir. Thank you.""

\*\*\*

A day later, Daisy and Carter returned to their home in Liberty City. Their home was a lavish apartment housed within one of Earth‚Äôs finest hotels. Every part of its one thousand and two hundred square feet was pristine. It had two bedrooms, a kitchen, and a living room with a beautiful couch in addition to other furnishings. Its floor was cleaned and polished to the point of a clear reflective surface. The room lived up to and even surpassed the hotel‚Äôs good name.

The couple lay in bed, snuggling right after making love in their apartment. Daisy wore a pink, short-trim silk nighty as Carter ran his hand through her silky hair. But as she was experiencing bliss, her eyes caught the sight of Everton‚Äôs pillow on the nightstand, and she grew a frown as she reached for it.

""Thank god those meetings are over. I was terrified I would say the wrong thing,"" Daisy held Everton‚Äôs pillow close to her heart.

""I'm right there with you, red. Fighting is one thing, but politics is something else.‚Äù Carter noticed Daisy holding the pillow frowning. ‚ÄúBy the way, what's the story with that pillow? These days, you don‚Äôt go anywhere without it. And you always look so sad holding it.""

""It's a gift from the first Nemesis who showed me kindness. His name was Everton Blak. He protected me and showed me how to defend myself. And he even died saving me.‚Äù Daisy let out a deep sigh. ‚ÄúCarter, the man, was like a father to me. After all these years of being robbed of Pa's love, I got another. But I was too foolish to treasure it.""

""Wow, that's something.‚Äù Carter took a deep breath. ‚ÄúNow for my second question. Where exactly does the horse go in you when you're not Damara? Because I can think of several places that wouldn't be fun.""

Daisy burst out laughing.""Carter Barnes, I don't know how you do it, but you always cheer me up.""

""Great, I love seeing that smile."" Carter gently brushed his hand against Daisy‚Äôs cheek.

Daisy prepared to kiss Carter, but she stopped as an idea appeared in her mind, and her frown returned.

""I'll need you more than ever when we return from Hachiko. Oh god, I should have called my family earlier.""

""Daisy, don't beat yourself up. You had a thousand and one things on your plate."" Carter kissed Daisy.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs that talent again.‚Äù Daisy grew a small smile.

\*\*\*

A United Planets spaceship flew across the galaxy to planet Hachiko. On the ship, Daisy helped Carter get dressed in front of the mirror in his cabin. She put the final touches on his black uniform with its long white cape on his clothes. But Carter looked at himself in the mirror, tightly gripping his mouth.

""Well, red, how do I look?""

""Quite handsome. But more importantly, like a respectable general.""

""I was thinking more like a fraud. I wish I never got this job.""

""Carter, there‚Äôs no one more qualified than you. So where is this coming from?""

""So many lives in my hands.‚Äù Carter took a deep breath. ‚ÄùMore people to lose if I make a mistake. More little boys that will grow up without a dad.""

Daisy looked at Carter quickly hugging him.""I know you'll do a splendid job, my love. It‚Äôll be an honor to fight beside you.""

Carter cracked a small smile. ""Red, you cook, clean, and fight. What did I do to deserve you?""

Carter went in for a kiss, but Daisy quickly stopped him.

""What?"" Carter asked.

""I-I probably should have said this earlier. But we need to keep my secret. So, we must practice keeping our relationship quiet on missions. Starting now, no flirting, touching, or romance in any way.""

""Daisy, that's two weeks. You're killing me, but fine.""

Carter let out a groan but he soon gazed deeply at Daisy's body. Everything from her lips with red lipstick to, breasts, and butt made his heart pound like a drum.

""After this,"" Carter said.

Like lightning, Carter kissed Daisy with spirit. She tried to push him away but instead began enjoying it, clinging to Carter with an iron grip. As the couple stumbled toward his bed, he swiftly shoved Daisy onto it. And as he restrained her on the bed, Carter hastily had his way with her.

\*\*\*

Later, the spaceship landed on planet Hachiko. As Daisy and the others exited the vessel, they swiftly took in the glory of the alien world. A place of vast, open green meadows as far as the eye can see. Thousands of Lucas's kind, the Hachiko, littered the majestic landscape. Dog people of every breed lay down or ran through the meadows, filling the atmosphere with the sounds of life, loud shouting, chatter, and laughter as their sun bathed the land in golden rays. But one colossal shadow cast by a titanic white tower pierced the golden veil. And around it stood the only metropolis, solitary in the sea of the planet's natural beauty.

The metropolis was Camelot Alpha, the headquarters of the United Planets army. Carter‚Äôs militaristic mind was already scanning it for its defensibility in case of invasion. And he quickly noted how well-built it was, using the natural terrain to its advantage. It was like the fortress agreed with Hachiko, partitioning a portion of its surface, allowing it space to house the military without disrupting the natural landscape.

""Gorgeous. It makes me even more homesick for Kansas.""

""Thanks. War forced us to adopt a lot of new technology. But for the most part, we're still an agrarian society. We take great pride in our beautiful land.""

""Not to mention, the only obvious point of entry is through the secured front gate. And I bet your canine senses don't make sneak attacks any easier. No wonder Orion chose this place to be HQ,"" Carter said.

""He's the boss for a reason,"" Sarah said.

Carter looked around the area and spotted the Hachiko drawing carriages.

""Question. I get that you're a bunch of farmers, but why don't you employ some of that new technology in your transportation?""

Lucas let out a bark.""Because running through our fields makes us happy.""

""So, biology?""

Daisy giggled as she heard the men.""Carter, let's hurry to the meeting place before we're late. Sarah, Lucas, goodbye for now.""

Daisy waved to Sarah and Lucas goodbye, and she and Carter quickly left for their meeting.

""Well, Sarah, let's get to my village.""

Lucas hastily grew a smile, running toward the meadows, but Sarah caught him and hoisted him in the air.¬†

Sarah looked Lucas in the eye with an apathetic expression.""We're taking hover transport""

As Lucas heard Sarah, his smile disappeared, replaced with a growling frown.

At night, the family went to their old horse stable solitary on the Kansas prairie. It was a wooden structure of twelve square feet comprised of two levels, the ground and upper level with its white paint long faded to time. The upper level was used to store numerous things Joseph needed to care for the animals. But the ground level where the horses were kept was where it happened, the great tragedy of David family. For many years, they dared not to step foot on its land. It was here where their beloved Joseph met his doom. With every step forward, Belle and Mary trembled as ghosts of painful memories ran past them. Their minds saw phantom steeds dash away from the burning stable. Among them, Mary ran to the scene only to find Belle, a child, crying over her father‚Äôs dead body. And even all these years later, Belle could still feel the hellish heat of the barn on fire.

Daisy gazed upon the stable thoroughly scanning its dilapidated state. ""My god, I still remember Pa working so hard to raise the horses here. Ma, how could you ever think about selling it?""

""After all these years, I still struggle with Joseph's death.‚Äù Mary gripped half her face with her hand. ‚ÄúSo when I thought you died, I wanted to be rid of my sorrow. If only a little.""

""Daisy, why are we out here? So we can relive the day that ruined our lives?"" Belle asked

""I'm sorry. When I saw the stable, I couldn't help but ask.‚Äù Daisy took a deep breath. ‚ÄúThe reason why I brought you so far from town is to get away from prying ears. And you can‚Äôt find anywhere more solitary than Pa‚Äôs place.‚Äù

‚ÄúFor what?‚Äù Aisha asked.

‚ÄúT-there‚Äôs no easy way to tell you this. But I‚Äôm Damara the Valiant.""

Aisha burst out laughing. ""Daisy, I love you, but you are not a war hero. I don't think I've ever seen you hurt so much as a ladybug.""

Daisy looked at Aisha with her brow furrowing as she laughed at her statement. But she swiftly summoned the divinus's light and emerged from it as Damara. Her family was taken aback by the transformation, especially Aisha, as she fell to her knees, dead silent.

Mary looked at Daisy intensely, ensuring her eyes didn‚Äôt lie. ""So this is how you survived.""

""And because of the sacrifices of a good man. Ma, now that you know who I am, you know that-""

""You're going back into that killing field. Why?""

""Because I'm Joseph David's daughter. And because I made promises, I need to honor them. Ma, there are billions of little girls that are about to lose their fathers.""

As Mary heard Daisy, she started crying and walked away from everyone else. And Daisy looked at her mother, speechless, at a loss on how to console her.

\*\*\*

Daisy lay with Carter on the grass, staring at the starry night sky with Aisha and Belle beside them.

""Sissy, are you sure you can't give the divinus thing to someone else?‚Äù Belle pointed towards Carter. ‚ÄúLike the pretty boy, for example.""

""No, I'm the only one allowed to use it. I hate putting you through this, but please understand.""

""Daisy, we understand, but we still hate it.‚Äù Aisha got up weeping, slowly wrapping her hands around her neck. ‚ÄúYou came back to us, but now you're leaving for that death trap. If I hear that you died again, I might commit s-""

*""Don't you dare say that vile word. I will come back alive, and we'll run our boutique together like planned.""*¬†Daisy interrupted.

As they heard Daisy, the two women shared sideways glances.

Daisy looked at Belle and Aisha, perplexed. ""What is it?""

""The Boutique is dead. We lost all our clients.""

*""How?""*

""After we lost you, our dream seemed so meaningless. So we didn't have the strength to keep fighting for it.""

""Let's promise right now. When I return, we'll work hard like never before and get our dream back on track.‚Äù Daisy initiated a pinky promise. ‚ÄúYou can expect me to fly down to Pa's stable early on the first day of March.""

With her words of assurance, her sisters shook to the core, accepting the pinky promise. But Aisha and Belle started crying as they finished. They hugged Daisy with an unyielding grasp, and she reciprocated.

""D-daisy, I know this might sound strange, but can you please bring out the horse?"" Belle asked.

Daisy grew a smile. ""Really?""

""What can I say? I'm Joseph David's daughter, too.""

Daisy giggled but quickly granted Belle's request, summoning her noble stallion. Playfully guiding her to look to the right with a glance, the horse emerged from the divinus's light. And he swiftly brushed his nose gently against Belle's face.

""He's a handsome boy. Does he have a name?""

""I like to call him flaremane.""

Like lightning, a herd of wild horses ran through the prairie. Flaremane saw them and spotted a beautiful mare. The noble stallion became love-struck, preparing to chase after her, drawing everyone‚Äôs gazes. But as he started, Carter pulled on his reigns, stopping him.

""Sorry, horse, but I prefer not to know what will come of that.""

Flaremane snarled at Carter like a rabid dog, but he looked straight at the stallion with an apathetic expression. As the girls saw them, they burst into a laughing fit, clutching their stomachs in pain.

\*\*\*

Two days later, Daisy and Carter prepared to leave Lilyville. Carter put his and Daisy's suitcases in the back of his car. As he finished, Daisy hugged Belle and Aisha goodbye, but her heart skipped a beat as she saw Mary walking towards them.

As Mary arrived, she looked at Daisy, piercing through her with the violet eyes she passed down to her youngest daughter. Carter and the girls traded sideways glances. She only interacted with them by the barest minimum over the past two days. None of them, not even her daughters, had the slightest guess of what she would say. But Daisy had prepared her defense. The young woman would insist that she loved and respected her mother, but regardless, she still had to leave for the greater good. However, as the words began to exit her mouth, Daisy saw tears escape Mary‚Äôs eyes, stopping her.

Mary cried as she looked at Daisy. ""I will pray for you every night until you return, my kind and brave child.""

""Thank you, Ma.""

Mary and Daisy hugged each other goodbye, and as they finished, Daisy hurried into the car with Carter.

""Boy, you'll protect her with all your might, won't you?""

""No need to ask, ma'am. That was the plan.""

Daisy and Carter waved goodbye as the car drove off. And as they left, the David family watched with teary eyes as their beloved Daisy hurried off to war. Knowing too well that all they could do for her was pray.

\*\*\*

Elsewhere, on Placentia, Mavor landed on the flying castle in his spaceship. The slaves quickly rolled out a long red carpet of the finest fabric before its doors. He departed the vessel with his guards, walking down its path to Cymbeline. He and his soldiers met their emperor, kneeling by the entrance. But as Mavor reached him, he signaled for him to stand. And hastily, he began to heed his emperor's command.

""A warrior as mighty as you, Cymbeline, should never be on his knees,"" Mavor said.

""Thank you, emperor.‚Äù Cymbeline stood up. ‚ÄúI mean no disrespect, but why are you here? I already sent my report on the status of the colonies. Are you dissatisfied?""

""On the contrary. There's something I wanted to discuss with you in person. Please let us go inside.""

For a while nothing much happens.

*The Day:*  
Several invading armies approach, including the Storm King's flashy clanks, some make it into the city. Mixed signals are received from Castle Wulfenbach, first being part of the invading fleet, later defending the city walls.    
The castle awakens. The doom bell rings. The coffee shop Heterodyne emerges triumphant while the invaders flee. J√§gers appear out of no where all over the city. The city is saved...?  
Immediately a giant ...thing... pops up and lurks menacingly over the city. Dreen attack it, Franz attacks it. Just out of town it turns into a GIANT giant thing... 

All in all, a good first day for a new Heterodyne.

1lrfjgc,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthnutrition1/comments/1lrfjgc/does_vegan_mean_no_dairy_facts/,Does Vegan Mean No Dairy? Facts!,"Does Vegan Mean No Dairy? Understanding the Basics of Veganism
--------------------------------------------------------------

Many people ask, ""Does vegan mean no dairy?"" To answer this question, we need to explore the principles of veganism. A vegan lifestyle excludes all animal products, and that category includes dairy. If you have just started looking into veganism, understanding this fundamental distinction is key.

To clarify, vegans do not consume any products made from animals. This includes:

- **Milk:** Any kind of cow, goat, or sheep milk is excluded.
- **Cheese:** All types of cheese are made from milk, so vegans do not eat cheese.
- **Butter:** Whether it‚Äôs from cows or any other animals, butter is not an option.
- **Yogurt:** Dairy yogurts are given a firm no from vegans.
- **Ice cream:** Traditional ice creams are off the table, although there are many plant-based alternatives available.

These exclusions are not just about choosing what to eat; they come from ethical, environmental, and health-related concerns. Many vegans adopt this lifestyle to avoid contributing to animal suffering. By saying no to dairy, they also opt out of farming practices that are often linked to animal cruelty.

[ Get Vegan Warrior: Your Guide to Plant-Based Fitness Here ](https://buy.stripe.com/3cI9ATdnQ6Ubg0d2nt1wY05)  
  
Another reason for choosing a vegan diet is environmental sustainability. Dairy farming is resource-intensive. It requires large amounts of water and land, contributing to deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions. By avoiding dairy, vegans help decrease the burden on the planet‚Äôs resources.

Health is also a significant consideration. Research suggests that eliminating dairy might reduce the risk of certain health issues, such as lactose intolerance symptoms, heart disease, and some cancers. Many who adopt a vegan lifestyle report feeling better and finding it easier to manage their weight.

[ Get Vegan Warrior: Your Guide to Plant-Based Fitness Here ](https://buy.stripe.com/3cI9ATdnQ6Ubg0d2nt1wY05)  
  
Some people are under misconceptions about the vegan diet. They might think that being vegan means you can only eat salads and fruits. This couldn't be further from the truth! There are numerous delicious plant-based options available today, from meat substitutes to dairy-free treats. Here‚Äôs a look at some popular vegan substitutes for dairy:

- **Almond Milk:** A nut-based alternative to cow's milk.
- **Coconut Yogurt:** A creamy, tropical alternative to traditional yogurt.
- **Cashew Cheese:** A rich and creamy cheese alternative made from cashews.
- **Nut Butters:** Peanut or almond butter is a great spread in place of butter.
- **Vegan Ice Cream:** Made from almond, coconut, or cashew base instead of dairy cream.

Transitioning to a vegan diet can feel overwhelming, especially if you're used to including dairy in your meals. However, you can start small. Begin by replacing one dairy product at a time, helping your palate adjust. As you experiment with different alternatives, you might discover new flavors and recipes that you love.

[ Get Vegan Warrior: Your Guide to Plant-Based Fitness Here ](https://buy.stripe.com/3cI9ATdnQ6Ubg0d2nt1wY05)  
  
This journey into veganism doesn‚Äôt have to be rigid. Many individuals identify as ""flexitarians,"" where they mainly follow a vegan diet while occasionally still consuming animal products. Even small steps toward reducing dairy can make a difference in your personal health and the environment.

It‚Äôs also important to check food labels. Some processed foods, even those labeled as ""plant-based,"" might contain dairy. Always be vigilant and choose options specifically marked as vegan. This ensures that what you're purchasing aligns with your vegan lifestyle.

[ Get Vegan Warrior: Your Guide to Plant-Based Fitness Here ](https://buy.stripe.com/3cI9ATdnQ6Ubg0d2nt1wY05)  
  
If you think veganism sounds appealing but have concerns about missing out on certain flavors or textures, consider exploring plant-based cookbooks or online recipes. Many dishes can be created without dairy while still delivering a delightful eating experience. With creativity, you can craft meals that not only taste good but are also good for you and the planet.

If you are committed to a vegan lifestyle, then yes, it means no dairy. This decision comes from a mixture of ethical choices, environmental responsibility, and health benefits. Embracing a vegan diet opens up a world full of delicious new foods and experiences!

The Health Benefits of a Dairy-Free Lifestyle: Myths and Facts
--------------------------------------------------------------

Many people are exploring different dietary options for health and ethical reasons. A dairy-free lifestyle is gaining popularity, but there's often confusion about its true impact on health. Let's delve into the myths and facts surrounding the health benefits of eliminating dairy and how this choice can influence your well-being.

One common myth is that a dairy-free diet is always unhealthy. In reality, many people thrive on dairy-free diets filled with nutrient-rich foods. For instance, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and seeds can provide essential vitamins and minerals that are often associated with dairy products.

Another widespread misconception is that you will miss out on calcium if you cut dairy from your diet. While dairy is a known calcium source, there are plenty of alternatives. Some excellent dairy-free calcium sources include:

[ Get Vegan Warrior: Your Guide to Plant-Based Fitness Here ](https://buy.stripe.com/3cI9ATdnQ6Ubg0d2nt1wY05)  
  
- Leafy greens like kale and collard greens
- Fortified plant-based milk such as almond or soy milk
- Tofu and tempeh
- Broccoli and Brussels sprouts
- Almonds and sesame seeds

These foods not only provide calcium but also come with added health benefits. For example, leafy greens are rich in fiber, helping with digestion and maintaining a healthy gut. By focusing on a variety of plant-based foods, you can easily meet your nutritional needs without dairy.

Individuals often turn to a dairy-free life to manage lactose intolerance or milk allergies. Lactose intolerance can lead to uncomfortable symptoms like bloating, gas, and diarrhea after consuming dairy products. By removing dairy, people often report feeling better and more energized. A dairy-free diet allows these individuals to avoid the discomfort that dairy can cause while still enjoying a diverse range of foods.

There are potent health benefits linked to a dairy-free lifestyle, including improved skin health. Some studies suggest that dairy can exacerbate acne and other skin conditions. If you struggle with skin issues, reducing or eliminating dairy might lead to clearer skin. Many people have shared positive experiences about their skin feeling smoother and healthier after cutting out dairy.

In addition, many people who switch to a dairy-free diet find they enjoy more energy and less fatigue. Dairy, especially when processed, can be heavy and hard for some bodies to digest. By opting for lighter, plant-based foods, you may feel more energetic and agile throughout your day.

It is also important to note that some may think eliminating dairy means they can‚Äôt enjoy their favorite foods. This is a myth! Today, there are numerous delicious dairy-free alternatives available. Options include:

- Dairy-free cheese made from nuts or soy
- Coconut yogurt or almond yogurt
- Ice cream made from cashews or coconut milk
- Dairy-free creamers for coffee
- Dairy-free chocolate and desserts

With creativity and exploration, you can easily find substitutes that provide the satisfaction and taste you desire without the dairy.

It's essential to consider that a dairy-free diet won't suit everyone. Each person's body responds uniquely to dietary changes. Therefore, it may be beneficial to consult a healthcare provider or nutritionist when considering such a transition. They can help ensure you‚Äôre still meeting your nutritional needs.

A dairy-free lifestyle comes packed with health potential, along with a few myths to bust along the way. By understanding the facts, you can make empowered decisions that benefit your health. Instead of viewing dairy-free as a limitation, see it as an opportunity to explore new foods and flavors that can enhance your dietary experience.

Ultimately, whether you‚Äôre lactose intolerant, allergic to dairy, or simply seeking a healthier lifestyle, going dairy-free can offer numerous benefits. Embracing a variety of plant-based foods can lead to a richer, more satisfying diet, improved health, and potential solutions for skin issues. So, take the leap, discover new options, and enjoy the positive changes that come with a dairy-free lifestyle.

### Conclusion

Understanding the connection between veganism and dairy is essential for anyone considering a plant-based lifestyle. At its core, veganism is a commitment to eliminate all animal products, which includes dairy. This means that if you choose to follow a vegan diet, you are opting to do away with milk, cheese, butter, and any other dairy-derived ingredients.

Adopting a dairy-free lifestyle can provide numerous health benefits. Many people report improvements in digestion, skin health, and overall well-being after eliminating dairy from their diets. However, there are common myths that suggest a dairy-free lifestyle lacks nutritional value. In reality, there are plenty of plant-based alternatives rich in calcium, vitamin D, and other essential nutrients. By incorporating a variety of fruits, vegetables, nuts, and fortified plant-based products, you can easily meet your nutritional needs without dairy.

Transitioning to a vegan diet may seem daunting, but there are many resources available to guide you through this journey. Whether you are motivated by health, ethical, or environmental reasons, eliminating dairy while embracing a vegan lifestyle can lead to significant positive changes. It‚Äôs important to remember that each person‚Äôs journey is unique. Always listen to your body and consult with healthcare professionals or nutritionists if you have specific dietary concerns.

Embracing veganism and a dairy-free lifestyle is not just about what you eliminate; it‚Äôs about the positive choices you make. By choosing plant-based options, you are taking a step towards improved health and a more sustainable future.

1lrfix6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInReviews/comments/1lrfix6/does_the_sana_878_juicer_redefine_convenience_and/,Does the Sana 878 Juicer Redefine Convenience and Cold Press Juicing?,"Testing the Sana 878 was a surprisingly enjoyable experience for someone like me who juggles a busy schedule but insists on fresh juices every morning. As a long-time user of masticating juicers, I wanted to see if the Sana 878 could live up to the hype of its self-feeding capabilities and innovative cold-press juicing screens. Let me just say, it exceeded many of my expectations, but there are a few quirks worth noting.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The Sana 878 stands out with its sleek black gloss finish that looks almost too elegant for just sitting on my kitchen counter. Its compact yet sturdy build doesn‚Äôt take up much space but feels solid and durable, which matters when you‚Äôre dealing with a machine that weighs over 13 pounds. The product dimensions, 8""D x 10""W x 19""H, make it tall enough to catch your eye but not cumbersome. I especially appreciated the large 2000 ml XL hopper on the top, allowing me to drop multiple fruits and vegetables all at once‚Äîgoodbye repetitive hand-feeding! The stainless steel blade components also add a professional touch, ensuring durability and low maintenance. Plus, for someone like me who loves gadgets but hates cleaning them, the dishwasher-safe parts were a game changer.  

**Good Points**  
- The self-feeding hopper really reduces effort and speeds up juicing.  
- High-quality, durable materials like stainless steel and gloss finish make it feel premium.  
- Compact design saves countertop space.  

[Check Sana 878 price on Amazon.](https://appliancedirectory.com/p/b0dc2517n6/)

**Performance and Functionality**  
One of my favorite things about the Sana 878 is its performance. Using its quiet yet powerful 200-watt motor, the masticating technology slowly extracts juice. This ensures I get maximum nutrients and flavor without compromising the integrity of my fruits and veggies. The included three cold-press juicing screens‚Äîthe fine, coarse, and homogenizing options‚Äîallowed me to experiment. I tried the fine screen for hard produce like carrots and beets, while the coarse setting was better for softer fruits like mangoes and peaches. Surprisingly, the homogenizing feature wasn‚Äôt just a gimmick; I made creamy almond butter and a delicious frozen berry sorbet for the kids. The ability to tailor each result based on the type of produce made me realize how well-thought-out the design is for a variety of uses.  

**Capacity and Storage**  
The impressive 67-ounce (1500 ml) vacuum juice container deserves its own mention. It has a built-in pump to remove air, which extends the lifespan of fresh juice up to three days. This was like a little gift for me because I could juice in bulk twice a week and not worry that it‚Äôd lose nutrition or flavor quickly. The lid even comes with a built-in calendar to keep track of its freshness. For anyone who dislikes the daily hassle of juicing‚Äîor gets lazy on day three of their healthy streak‚Äîthis feature alone is worth it.

**Drawbacks**  
- Taller height can make it tricky to fit under low kitchen shelves.  
- Only one speed setting limits versatility for certain tough produce.  

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
Operating the Sana 878 couldn‚Äôt be easier. Its knob controller is straightforward, and with just one speed setting, there‚Äôs no over-complication. I will say, some might see the lack of multiple speeds as a downside, but I found it sufficient for most fruits and veggies. Cleaning up was unexpectedly simple. Disassembling the parts didn‚Äôt leave me grumbling into my morning coffee, and knowing I could toss most of it into the dishwasher made me love it even more. The stainless-steel angled pulp catcher was also genius; it kept everything tidy while I transferred pulp to my compost bin.  

**Shortcomings**  
- The lack of multiple speed options might frustrate more advanced users.  
- Slightly pricey compared to some competitors in the same category.  

**Competing Products**  
Having used masticating juicers from other brands, such as the Omega NC800 and Hurom H-AA, I‚Äôd say the Sana 878 offers a unique edge with its self-feeding design. The Omega juicer, though powerful and incredibly efficient, often required constant hand-feeding, which grows tiresome over time. Hurom models generally excel in aesthetics and size but lack the vacuum storage system that the Sana 878 offers. Where the competitors win is price‚Äîif you‚Äôre tight on budget, you may lean towards Omega‚Äôs slightly simpler models. However, when it comes to innovation and quality together, the Sana 878 clearly steals the spotlight.

**Money‚Äôs Worth**  
The initial investment in the Sana 878 might make you hesitate, but it offers features that justify the cost over time. Bulk juicing, extended storage, and durability ensure you‚Äôre getting long-term efficiency without racking up hidden costs. If you value convenience, rich nutrient retention, and a product that could genuinely last over a decade (thanks to a stellar 15-year warranty!), then this machine delivers on every count. Plus, its multipurpose use‚Äîfrom juices to almond milk and frozen desserts‚Äîoffers potential savings by eliminating the need for separate gadgets.

I recently broke up with my gf so I thought I should be getting back out there and meeting people irl and then I remember this incident and it gives me Nightmares... So what happened was I was at a theatre for Kung Fu Panda 4... I was alone and the theatre was like half full but a group of girls were sitting in seats on the same row but on the opposite side... I saw one of them walking up and thought she was cute... At the end of the movie I walk up to her and say she looks really pretty and would like her number, but then she said she just turned 16... I was 18 at the time ofc and I was like nah she's too young and I apologised profusely and ran away... I was really embarrassed...(That was the first time I had ever asked someone out in person...). As I run out of the movie, I see these 3 girls literally chasing me... Like I look back and they're following me like WTFFF... I try running faster and I get out thinking they're gone... There's a coffee stand outside the mall so I get a coffee and just look at my phone... And then I see these 3 girls waiting and I was like FUCKING HELL WTFFF... I try not to look and to stay away hoping they're just there to catch and auto but then I grab my coffee and THE GIRL I ASKED OUT comes and talks to me... She gives me her insta and I leave... Then I make it clear to her on chat that she's too young for me and I can't do that... At the time and till recently I thought it was flattering that someone chased me and followed me but after all the times I remembered that incident and just felt genuine sickness made me realise that I didn't want to be followed or chased after and that it WAS really creepy of those girls to do that...
