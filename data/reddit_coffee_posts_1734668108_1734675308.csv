I was toned and lean had a great diet, and was my happiest. When I went to college, I stopped running and mainly focused on weight training (nothing crazy) and simple forms of cardio like the stair master or  the 12-3-30 treadmill routine. During this time I became less interested in my health, and was increasingly fixated on just losing weight. I often would supplement coffee as meals (not all the time, just here and there), because the caffeine made me feel full‚Äî and I was convinced that having a meal over drinking coffee would reverse the weight loss. I don‚Äôt think I have an ED (possible disordered eating), but I‚Äôm worried if I start exercising again I will go down this same path of fixation and it possibly become worse. I know I need to exercise because I‚Äôve lost all muscle, have no stamina, or energy‚Ä¶ but am just nervous to try again. Any advice??",2,1734674944.0,EDAnonymous,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone! I just got back from an amazing half-day trip to Muir Woods and Sausalito, and I had to share my experience with you all. If you're visiting San Francisco or live in the Bay Area, this is absolutely worth your time.

I booked this tour through this link (https://athometouch.com/MuirWoods) and it was honestly one of the best decisions I made during my SF visit. The whole experience was super smooth, from the hotel pickup to the professional guide who really knew their stuff.

First stop: Muir Woods. Let me tell you, pictures don't do these coastal redwoods justice. Standing beneath these ancient giants, some over 600 years old, is truly humbling. We had about 1.5 hours to explore the trails, which was perfect for taking photos and soaking in the peaceful atmosphere. Pro tip: going in the morning meant fewer crowds and better lighting for photos.

The trails are well-maintained and mostly flat, so don't worry if you're not a hardcore hiker. The fresh morning air mixed with the earthy smell of the forest is something I'll never forget. Our guide shared fascinating facts about the ecosystem and history of these magnificent trees.

After Muir Woods, we headed to Sausalito - this charming waterfront town looks like it belongs on the Mediterranean coast. The 45-minute stop was just right for grabbing lunch (try the fresh seafood!), browsing unique boutiques, or simply enjoying the stunning bay views. I loved watching the sailboats while enjoying my coffee at one of the waterfront cafes.

The tour also included an optional photo stop at the Golden Gate Bridge - definitely worth it! The views were incredible, and our guide knew exactly where to get the best shots.

What I really appreciated about this tour was the flexibility. You can either return by coach or take the ferry back to SF (I chose the ferry for extra views). The whole thing takes about 5 hours, so you still have plenty of time to do other activities in SF.

If you're planning to go, I highly recommend booking through this link: https://athometouch.com/MuirWoods. The price includes everything (entrance fees, transportation, guide) and it's totally worth it. The tour has amazing reviews (4.6/5) for good reason.

Quick Tips:
- Wear layers (the woods can be cool in the morning)
- Bring a camera
- Wear comfortable walking shoes
- Book in advance as spots fill up quickly

Would love to hear from others who've done this tour or are planning to go!",1,1734674815.0,AskTheTraveler,0,1.0,False
1hidg5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/1hidg5m/i_need_more_black_women_in_my_life/,I need more black women in my life.,"Hey everybody, can I vent? 
From kindergarten to 8th I was the only black student in my year. In high school I had one black female friend that I was close to from freshman year in high school to her ghosting me a couple years after coming out(I always knew, I‚Äôm pansexual and we were both in denial haha) in our sophomore year of college for what i assumed was apart of cutting off a group of high school friends that I was included in(I recently(during the pandemic)cut off the rest of the group who were white female friends I played basketball with because they never called out their other white friends and I stopped feeling comfortable or safe with the friend group they developed. I was already quiet quitting by time the pandemic came around(one was straight and somehow also the president of the lgbtq club in college, but when her wedding came around she brought up that she was considering not inviting our friend and their partner to her wedding because they‚Äôre gay and didn‚Äôt want to make her in laws uncomfortable, the other friend became hyper religious and surrounded herself with people who supported trump and would go silent when I walked into the room mid conversation). I cut them off for those obvious reasons and because I realized I masking to get by and feel safe because I was constantly the only ‚Äúone‚Äù in the room or space. I was one of two black women on the basketball team in college. That teammate was more of a mentor than a friend. I was a 17 year old freshman and she was a 25year old sophomore. She joined the navy and roots on my accomplishments through social media from another state or country depending on deployment. I experienced a lot of anxiety in college that affected me physically(heart being monitored by ekgs pretty consistently). I dropped out because focusing was already hard enough with ADD(recently being diagnosed and treated at 32) and after a couple years of working in hospitality I went to culinary school and eventually became a corporate executive pastry chef(my life goal from second grade), even though I went to school for savory cooking üòÖ i met a really dope black femme artist a couple years post graduation who became my favorite friend, the first time I actually felt seen and heard as a black femme human. We became close friends before the pandemic, but even closer after one of her best friends said they couldn‚Äôt be there for her as this friend of mine was going through an intense episode of psychosis with lasting side affects during the pandemic. She stopped being friends with her other best  friend because her brother in law cheated on them. I proposed doing a big project to distract and lift her up(don‚Äôt work with your friends) during the end of the project I became distant, inattentive and a bad friend and I see that now. The white girlfriend that let her go because she didn‚Äôt have capacity for her during her mental health crisis popped back in after getting a black boyfriend. She started prioritizing her. When I brought up how people shot down my ideas for the project and then recycled them later in the planning, she didn‚Äôt have my back. We grew apart during the project. She ended up getting closer to my sister and the art collective of women my sister had that were working with us on the project(I proposed the project to my sister for help)By the time the project was over, she said she never wanted to speak to me again and that I didn‚Äôt deserve to get paid for my labor(another long story)and that was the last time a couple years ago. She continued hanging out and working with my sister just as she did with the sister of her friend that her brother in law cheated on(he later cheated on that girl after their daughter was born). This isn‚Äôt an important detail, but it‚Äôs hella juicy ain‚Äôt it lol During that project I called out this friends mom for continuing to maintain a relationship of her brother with her dad(a man that sexually abused her as a child) and the whole family started getting petty with me after that. I also called out my sister for her parenting skills during this time too. I didn‚Äôt get to socialize much in 8th grade and high school because I helped my sister out with my niece heavily. She kept taking back a man who went to prison multiple times and was left parenting on her own and still decided to have a second child with him. She stopped talking to me for at least 2 years after that. I made varsity as a senior, so I wasnt really around people my age or grade. The freshman and Jv players who were my age that I reconnected with later in life thought my niece was my daughter because of how I brought her everywhere. My now husband, who I met the summer going into sophomore year of high school but didn‚Äôt date till age 25 would make jokes about how hanging out with me was forbidden(my mom was a nurse and my dad was a truck driver, I spent a lot of time heavily isolated and raising myself in elementary and grade school because of the large age gap with my siblings, the oldest being almost 2 decades apart from me) and then in high school my mom just wouldn‚Äôt let me go out. My dad was very passive. They would argue a lot and she would hit him often(still trying to figure out if I‚Äôm actually an introvert or just have ptsd from my childhood making me want to keep all relationships at the surface level) After a year of therapy I see where I went wrong as a friend in that relationship and I could‚Äôve done better. My sister also stopped being close to me after that project. She literally would walk out of rooms that I walked into around the holidays and if my mom brought up any success I would over hear her change the subject or talk about the friend that I lost during the project. Like the little sister she wish she had. That relationship hasn‚Äôt been the same. Fast forward to present time, the moment I thought we were getting close again, turns out she just someone to stay with my younger than 10 nephew for a week while she spontaneously booked a trip to Florida üôÑ 

That was the venting,(nah, there‚Äôs more lol) but here is my current frustration. I can‚Äôt catch a brick trying to make black friends or friends in general. Being the only black friend is taxing and I‚Äôm tired. I feel like I‚Äôm not accepted as a black person because of my ‚Äúalternative‚Äù interests and now my husband. I had a sweet moment with two gay black men talking to me and hyping me up at a bar and the moment my white husband walked up they made a twisted face and almost literally scurried away üôÉ I walked into a coffee shop and saw two beautiful black women talking about going on hikes after work(a friendship dream situation) but I felt intimidated like I wasn‚Äôt black enough to approach them. I got a little side eye when I said excuse me too. I was holding a lot of products for a customer visit and needed to make way to the corner table. I‚Äôm afraid of being disowned after people meet my husband or my hobbies and entertainment interest are brought up. I thought I met a couple of cool women in the same friend group and I was stoked because it wasn‚Äôt just more white girls, but there was a woke one in the mix lol(one Mexican, the other el Salvadoria) but turns out one just wants to flirt with my husband and the other did some weird shit. She was talking to what I assume was a Dom because a black woman with a collar walked away from him (this happened at a gay bar) and I over heard her say to him ‚Äúso your into watching‚Äù and continue the conversation. Later walking/bringing the guy over to stand two feet behind to watch her constantly touch and sexually harass me after telling her no and to stop to the point where I sunk/fell into the outdoor lounge set that I was sitting on the arm of behind a friend to force space between her and me. Granted, this woman works as a sex therapist and I was abused by an extended family member as a child and my college boyfriend was verbally and sexually abusive.
My no meant no. When she apologized to me later she said ‚Äú I‚Äôm made an announcement at the beginning of the night that I‚Äôm gonna get drunk and no be responsible for my actions and then apologized saying sorry in a baby voice and gave an unwanted hug. I gave up my chef job for work life balance and because the falling out with the that project friend brought me to my lowest depression spell. I now work in an office because working as a chef is hard when you stop liking food or eating.  The longest lasting black femme friendship I have has last from kindergarten to now, but that friend just shared screenshots on social media about how she journaled what I ate and how I looked during and post college. I grew up buck toothed and funny looking and became conventionally attractive(still have my gap though)in my twenties after dropping 40lbs. I always felt a nervousness or anxiety hitting off with any of her friends because I noticed starting in college that after any time I bonded with anyone in her social group she would become more distant in our friendship and I‚Äôve now noticed that she only cared for hearing about the bad that was happening in my life and because of social media I see how often she is socializing doesn‚Äôt really invite me to anything, ever. Now I‚Äôm just tired and feel alone. I‚Äôll probably delete this later.",1,1734674790.0,blackladies,0,1.0,False

1hidcfm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1hidcfm/i_have_been_having_headaches_every_day_for/,I have been having headaches every day for several years. ,"I (22F, 200lbs 5‚Äô6, I vape and used to smoke weed but stopped last year. I take pantoprazole for GERD and progesterone only birth control, and quetiapine for mood control and sleep) have been having daily headaches for approximately 3 years now. My symptoms include: headaches in different areas but usually behind my eyes or around the back of my head, occasional dizziness and a tendency to bump into things, weird depth perception, large mood shifts, difficulty losing weight (I work out daily and eat healthy-ish), constant fatigue, and difficulty finding words when speaking. 

Within the last year I‚Äôve tried a variety of things to see if it helps reduce the headaches such as: working out more/going for more walks, changing my diet, getting more sleep (difficult, because I had a baby in April this year and he doesn‚Äôt know what sleep is), drinking more water, drinking less caffeine (down to 1 cup of coffee a day), I‚Äôve tried meditating and all that jazz, hell, I‚Äôve even tried praying to no avail. 

In the past I wasn‚Äôt very bothered by it, I‚Äôd take some Tylenol and take a nap and it‚Äôd be gone by the time I wake up. Since having my baby though, I have to take Tylenol and Advil (max dose) and it only reduces the headaches and doesn‚Äôt stop them. They occur daily and last several hours (if not all day.) I‚Äôm at a loss. All blood work is normal. My BP is always on the low end of normal (usually like 110something over 70something) my thyroid and hormones are fine every time they‚Äôre checked, CBC always comes back normal, ALP is somewhat high since my cholecystectomy in July but my doc isn‚Äôt alarmed.

### A Love Story: Shoaib Akhtar and Kriti Sanon

#### Chapter 1: An Unlikely Encounter

In the heart of bustling Mumbai, where lives intersected in the most unexpected ways, the world of cricket and cinema seemed to collide one fateful evening. Shoaib Akhtar, the legendary fast bowler known as the ""Rawalpindi Express,"" had just retired from cricket and was looking for new avenues to express his passion for the game. He was invited to a charity match organized by a popular film studio, where he was to play alongside various Bollywood stars.

Kriti Sanon, an emerging star in the film industry, was known for her charm and acting prowess. She was also an avid cricket fan. As fate would have it, she was chosen to host the event, and on that sunny afternoon, while everyone gathered on the field, her eyes spotted Shoaib talking animatedly with other players. The sight of him, despite being a former sportsman, radiated confidence and charisma.

#### Chapter 2: The Spark

As the charity match commenced, it wasn't long before the chemistry between Shoaib and Kriti became noticeable. After a particularly impressive delivery from Shoaib, Kriti couldn't help but cheer loudly, bringing attention to herself. Their eyes met, and just like that, the atmosphere changed ‚Äî there was an undeniable spark.

After the match, where dreams were chased and laughter echoed, the hosts and players gathered for a wrap-up party. Kriti found herself drawn to Shoaib. Their conversation flowed seamlessly, transitioning from cricket to cinema, and then touching on their loves and dreams. They discovered a shared love for art ‚Äî Shoaib had painted for relaxation, while Kriti had taken up sketching.

#### Chapter 3: Blossoming Connection

Days turned into weeks. What began as casual encounters during various charity events evolved into long conversations filled with laughter. Shoaib admired Kriti's genuine passion for her work, while Kriti was fascinated by Shoaib's stories from the cricket field. Their friendship blossomed, and soon enough, romantic undertones began to emerge.

One evening, while sharing a cup of coffee at a quiet caf√©, Shoaib looked into Kriti‚Äôs eyes and said, ‚ÄúYou know, there‚Äôs something different about you. You make me feel alive, like I‚Äôm chasing down another wicket.‚Äù

Kriti smiled, her cheeks slightly flushed. ‚ÄúAnd you, Shoaib, remind me that life can be thrilling and unpredictable, just like a cricket match.‚Äù

#### Chapter 4: The Challenge

However, their relationship wasn't without its challenges. As a celebrity couple, they faced intense media scrutiny. Rumors circulated, and paparazzi pursued them relentlessly. One evening, during a particularly chaotic outing in the city, they found themselves overwhelmed by the attention.

Kriti turned to Shoaib, her eyes filled with concern. ‚ÄúIs this how it will always be? Can we handle this?‚Äù

Shoaib placed a reassuring hand on hers. ‚ÄúWe can face anything together. Let‚Äôs not allow the world to dictate our happiness.‚Äù

#### Chapter 5: A Grand Gesture

Determined to show his commitment, Shoaib decided to make a grand gesture. He organized a weekend getaway to a serene beach resort. He planned every detail ‚Äî from a candlelit dinner on the beach to stargazing on the shores

I (28) have a friend who just had a baby (29).  She asked me if I wanted to do a gift exchange for the holidays and I said NO bc i honestly don‚Äôt care about Christmas. She kind of pressed more and I said I‚Äôm just really busy and don‚Äôt have time or money to buy gifts for everybody. She said I wouldn‚Äôt have to get her a gift but maybe just her daughter and I said no I don‚Äôt want to do that sorry, holidays are stressful and I have a full plate‚Ä¶


I wish she just left it at that but today she texted me saying I know you didn‚Äôt wanna do gifts because you‚Äôre struggling financially but I still got you and your partner a gift anyways I would love to see you soon. 

I responded I know you didn‚Äôt mean that in a backhanded way but I am not financially struggling, which then she responds ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean it that way I just mean I‚Äôm in a giving spirit blah blah blah and just because you‚Äôre not in a position to exchange gifts doesn‚Äôt mean I  expect anything in return‚Äù

 she goes on to talk about  how I have been looking for a new job and I just need some time to get back on my feet and blah blah blah

 Which to me is totally rude and out of pocket. Yes I am looking for a new job but it doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not working 
and even if I wasn‚Äôt working I don‚Äôt get how that‚Äôs any of her business? I‚Äôm married and I have my own financial situation. I‚Äôve never missed a bill,

 maybe sometimes she wants to go out (like how she wanted to go to wicked with me and I didn‚Äôt feel like going to a movie theater) and I‚Äôm like I don‚Äôt really feel like spending money on that? But that doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm struggling financially it just means I don‚Äôt wanna go out and spend money for no reason. I don‚Äôt wanna get brunch, I like to eat at home. I don‚Äôt want to get coffee I have a nice espresso machine. 


I just felt like that comment is totally rude and she‚Äôs not sorry for it but instead is a saying  she understands and before she had a kid she used to be financially irresponsible. 

I do not think I‚Äôm financially irresponsible lol. I do not think she should have any opinions on my finances at all because it‚Äôs none of her business.

 I didn‚Äôt say this to her because I don‚Äôt feel like I need to explain myself but I already have to get my family gifts and also a lot of my cousins just had kids who I haven‚Äôt even met yet and I also have to get them gifts. Not only that but I need to get my partner gifts and his family, his sister & her bf, his cousins because we will be seeing them at their big family get together, and my family I will also see. I just don‚Äôt really think it‚Äôs necessary to exchange gifts with my friends. I told her it‚Äôs a lot of money to spend at once and I prefer doing gifts spontaneously throughout the year just out of love and not for obligation of Christmas. 

Also complete sidenote holidays are very stressful for me it‚Äôs enough (as an introvert ) that I have to deal with  seeing extended family  & I don‚Äôt really even get the point of Christmas . I don‚Äôt believe in Santa , I don‚Äôt have kids with my own , I would rather visit my family  when traffic isn‚Äôt crazy. so I absolutely feel like opting out of doing anything with my friends for the holiday.  And not to sound ungrateful but I don‚Äôt even like receiving gifts from people because if there‚Äôs anything I wanted I would just buy for myself and I really don‚Äôt need extra clutter‚Ä¶.  

What should I say to her ? My partner says I shouldn‚Äôt say anything and just drop it but I feel like her narrative that I‚Äôm financially struggling is extremely rude and the truth is I already told her I didn‚Äôt wanna exchange gifts. If she got us gifts that‚Äôs sweet but ??? I‚Äôm not like in need and I don‚Äôt want to get her or her kid a gift. Just because I don‚Äôt wanna spend money doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm financially struggling or in a tight position. I just don‚Äôt care about the holidays.

1hidam3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hidam3/grandpa_unfriened_me_on_facebook_added_comments/,Grandpa unfriened me on Facebook added comments,"Hi everyone. I'm a little weirded out by something, and I could use a little advice.

My grandpa has been dead for about ten years, but before he died he made a Facebook account. I never unfriended him, because it felt like I still had a connection with him as long as I could go back and read our old conversations. Well, a few weeks ago I noticed my Friends count had gone down by two. I never had many Facebook friends, so I knew it had to be two of my close friends or relatives who unfriended me. Eventually I realized it had to be grandpa and grandma. I thought maybe Facebook had closed grandpa's account because he had been dead for so long, but... That didn't explain grandma. Also, I could still find both of them by searching for their names. I don't know why, but I tried adding both of them again. Almost immediately, the option to add grandpa returned, so, I know my request was Ignored. The request to add grandma remained pending for a few hours, but eventually that one was Ignored too.

All this is a little besides the point, and more detailed than you probably care about, but I need to tell someone, because it's all still really strange to me, and I wanted to tell the whole story.

My grandmother is still alive. I don't visit her as often as I should, maybe a few times a year... She is not very tech savvy, but she's on Facebook once or twice a month, and after a few hours of painstakingly guiding her through online banking, she's even managed to start paying her bills online. But other than that, Facebook is about the most complicated 'computer thing' she can handle.

I asked my mother, and she checked her own account. She had been unfriended as well. She about had a small meltdown when she called grandma and she didn't pick up. I live pretty close to my mother, so she came and picked me up, and we drove to grandmother's house. It's only an hour away. Really there is no excuse for visiting her as seldom as we do.

Grandma was home, and she was happy to see us. When my mother demanded to know why she hadn't picked up the phone, she said she had been to grandpa's grave. She didn't seem to think mother had any reason to be upset, but she invited us in and asked if we wanted to stay for dinner or coffee. We decided to remain for a few hours. As I said, we really should have visited her more often, and every time we visit it's clear grandma likes having us... We feel guilty about it when we're there for once, but life moves pretty quickly, and there is always something else we need to do.

My grandma has an old piano. I'm not very musically inclined, but it's very nostalgic for me to hear mother and grandma play on that piano. Which they did, as they always do when we visit. It felt good. It felt normal. So I told myself she had probably just had an old person moment and logged into grandpa's account for some reason. But I was still curious, so I did ask her during dinner. She looked embarrassed, but she said she just did not feel like using facebook anymore, so she had tried to close her account. We said the accounts were still open though, but she waved it away. We finished dinner and helped her with a few things around the house. She was happy to have us there, and again, everything felt normal. Eventually we went home.

A few weeks passed. I and mom both called grandma once or twice, and everything still seemed normal. But late one night last week I decided to look my grandparents up on Facebook again. The profile pictures had changed. Grandma used to change hers every now and then, and the new ones didn't look unusual, but... Grandma said she' stopped using Facebook. And there was no reason at all for grandpa's account to have a new picture.

I brought it up with mother the next day, and she had that same feeling as I did that... something was off.

We went to visit grandma again yesterday. She was glad to see us like always. In fact she seemed happier than she had been in a long time.

We asked her about Facebook again, and she said she hadn't been on it. When we mentioned the profile pictures changing she said maybe she'd been on there once or twice. She didn't want to talk about it, so we let it drop. We helped her with a few chores around the house again, but... this time my curiosity was stronger, so I made sure I had an excuse to go into her bedroom while she was in the kitchen with mother, and I turned on her computer. I know all her passwords, because she never changes them, and she has them all written down on a little note next to her laptop. It was a cheap piece of crap the day we bought it for her half a decade ago, but she only uses it for very basic things like writing about her childhood (She lives out in the middle of nowhere, and she grew up in a retirement home in the 1930s, so she knows more about the area and people who used to live there than pretty much anyone). But... she had a Tor browser.

She's not stupid, my grandma, but she's always been very, very bad at computering, like a lot of old people. So this surprised me. Even my parents probably don't even know what Tor browsers are used for, so my grandma definitely shouldn't. Hell, I don't even know that much. Only time I ever used one was when I was looking into the Darknet back in the day, and that was a very brief and shallow visit.

I clicked on Tor, and it opened up to a normal search engine. No bookmarks, no browsing history, nothing. Considering she was in the habbit of writing all her account names and passwords down on post it notes and leaving them by the computer, I figured she probably didn't use Tor. I closed it, opened up her regular browser and went to Facebook. She was logged in. She had unfriended everyone. Everyone, except grandpa. And this is what creeps me out. There were posts on both her and grandpa's timelines going back to the day she had unfriended everyone. Some posts were from his account, the rest from hers. They replied to each other. It looked like real conversations. Grandma would sometimes take minutes to reply, sometimes hours, but grandpa's replies were all almost instantaneous. There were old pictures of them back when they were younger. From back before digital cameras even. I suppose it's possible grandma might have learned how to scan photos, or paid someone to do it for her, but... Why would she fake conversations with her dead husband? I was starting to worry something was seriously wrong with grandma. I took a few photos of the screen with my phone, then I went out into the kitchen. I joined the conversation for a little bit, then whispered to mom and told her to go into the bedroom while I talked to grandma. I kept her busy for around twenty minutes until mom came back. She looked a little pale, so she must have found the whole thing as creepy as I did. But now what? We didn't know what to do. I sneaked back to grandma's bedroom with the intention to turn her laptop off before she noticed we'd turned it on at all. But then I saw there was a new message waiting for her. From my grandpa. I opened the chat window, and it read:

Have Angie and Charlie already left?
My mother's name is Angela, so Angie isn't that strange as a nickname, but nobody calls me Charlie except my grandparents. Charles is my middle name, and most people don't even know I have one. So I was a little bit disturbed that someone was calling me that when talking to my grandmother using her dead husband's account. I took a photo of that as well, then closed the browser and turned her laptop off.

My mother and I said our good byes and left. Everything about my grandma's behaviour seemed normal, and she was sad to see us go like always... But I know for a fact that it couldn't be her who had written that message, since she had been in the kitchen the whole time.

This happened yesterday, and I have no idea what's going on. It feels wrong. I mean, I know something is clearly off, but I have no idea what it could be. How do I even look into this more? Do we just confront grandma about this? I have no idea where to turn. So, if anyone here has any ideas, please, I'm completely in the dark.

I read a bunch of comments but not all of them so someone may have suggested this already...Since you know and have all of your grandmas login info why not log in from your own computer and read more of the conversation and see what else has been said between your Grandma's & Grandpa's accounts? It will probably give you some further insight and possibly help you get to the bottom of this.

Also, considering that the person sending the emails asked if you and your mom left yet and knew you were there, it IS possible that they could, 1) either be in her house or spying on her like someone else had said and also be aware that you were on her computer. 2) They could have seen that your grandma was ""active"" and that's why the email had been sent and they had assumed it was her or 3) they knew it was you and sent it to worry you enough to shut the laptop down and stop snooping.

Regardless of all of that though, my suggestion is that you invite your grandma out to lunch sometime SOON and maybe find out more. If she is being watched in her house and isn't feeling safe like someone else had said, getting her out of the house to talk about it would be your best option, imo. Let your grandma know that you had seen her Facebook and you did get on it because you were worried about her well-being. She seems really sweet and might not get too upset if you explain why you did what you did.

Please keep us posted, OP. Hope everything turns out ok!

P.S. Visit your grandma more often. You will seriously regret it when she's gone. Older people that don't have too many people to socialize with rely on their families for company. She may be lonely and visiting her even once a week would probably make her really happy, I'm sure. I miss my grandma terribly. It's been almost 10 years and I still wish I had more time with her. Don't miss out on the time you DO have left before there's no time left at all.   This is a repost from sevan years ago",2,1734674215.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1hid9kl,https://www.reddit.com/r/handbags/comments/1hid9kl/the_horse_review_clementine_in_burgundy/,The Horse Review - Clementine in Burgundy,"Hello friends! I'm doing a series of reviews¬†[as detailed in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/handbags/comments/1ha4id0/black_friday_insanity_lots_of_reviews_incoming/). This post is for the Clementine(s) I ordered... yes, multiple. I ordered the Olive \~2 days before I heard that the Burgundy would be going on sale, so I bought the Burgundy anyway, and sold the Olive at the Black Friday price. Unfortunately I only took photos of the Burgundy.

Photos: [https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1GMoMHXtN4PowI5Ctf5\_lNA7Hir0ZWRUI](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1GMoMHXtN4PowI5Ctf5_lNA7Hir0ZWRUI)

Let me say - this is one of my favorite bags, and definitely the least expensive bag that I loved and kept. The design is simple but gorgeous IMO, the leather feels and smells luscious (none of them chemical smell I've heard some colors have), and the color is beautiful. 

My first impression was, honestly, that the color looked more brown and less red than I'd hoped, especially since the Coffee color seems to have a red undertone too. But once I took it into slightly better lighting it is definitely more reddish, and especially outside. To be nitpicky, I would probably call this a maroon instead of a burgundy, but hey. 

My second impression was that I liked the shape, but was worried it might be too deep for my preference and/or frame. Thankfully (surprisingly!) I didn't find wearing or carrying it to be uncomfortable, although my style and function preference will definitely be to carry it instead of wear it. 

In general, though - the shape has a GORGEOUS shape, from every angle! All photos were taken with a minimum of items inside (wallet, phone, keys), and without any other encouragement to make it slouch, or any wear yet for it to 'gain' a slouch. It definitely slouches more when carried, but other reviews have mentioned that too. Have I mentioned the leather feels and smells gorgeous? 

Something else I appreciate about this style/color combo, is that it feels really versatile - easy to dress up or down, can be worn any season, etc. While the Olive was also REALLY pretty, this bag feels like it can be dressed up a little easier. The Olive seemed great for a casual or edgy style, but less for evenings, an elevating neutral, etc. Both colors were true to the website. 

Minor cons: I don't love the silver hardware, which I know The Horse does for most bags, and I knew about going in. It doesn't bother me too much, or clash with a chain I played around with adding, but it's never my preference. The strap also feels a LITTLE too wide, but that was quickly forgotten, and I like the look of it when carried (not worn), so that doesn't matter too much to me. It's also the least easy to access out of all the bags I kept, since you need to move both flaps out of the way - but my bar for this generally is pretty high, so I'd say that overall it's not too bad. 

Overall I was really excited for this bag, with a little uncertainty since there were some underwhelmed reviewers here too. The thought crossed my mind if perhaps it was nice for the price, but wouldn't work for someone who generally carries more expensive and sometimes luxury bags. But I am happy to report that my high expectations were definitely matched! ",1,1734674099.0,handbags,1,1.0,False

1hid6vg,https://www.reddit.com/r/VestibularMigraines/comments/1hid6vg/the_good_the_bad_and_the_ugly/,"The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly","I was diagnosed with VM about a year and a half ago. My symptoms started in my late teens but became much worse in my mid-twenties, then became more consistent after I had COVID in 2021. I have frequent ear fullness, tinnitus, dizziness, and dissociation (the symptom I hate the most). I'm 35 now, and have had a crazy year, so I wanted to share with this community.

**The Good:**   
I started on the dizzy diet back in January and had massive success. Along with this, I figured out my triggers are caffeine (mainly coffee, green tea doesn't impact me as much), very fatty foods, gluten, sugar, and dairy, basically anything inflammatory. Aged food and smoked meat also impact me. I also take the supplements like magnesium, B12, D, and CoQ10.  
  
 Started a new job on January 3rd. It was a technical marketing role, and I've traveled the world several times. I've been fortunate to visit places like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, Hong Kong, Singapore, Paris, London, and various cities in the US. I would be lying if I said the VM didn't impact these; it did a great deal (more on that soon), but I haven't allowed my VM to define me, and I make sure to not over-commit when traveling and pad my time.

I have also figured out that the worst of my VM happens in the summer. I've lived in the Midwest my whole life, but I am now moving to the greater Boston area; I am interested to see how the northeast impacts my VM.

Lastly, the most significant impact I've noticed is not getting enough sleep or drinking enough water. Keeping a record of my sleep (using an oura ring) and monitoring how much water I drink has been a massive improvement.

Overall, I've had an excellent year with a wonderful and supportive family. 

**The Bad:**  
I have severe VM symptoms after long flights, especially to Asia. I've been able to combat this a bit by having 1-2 days of downtime when I get there, but typically, by the time I get home, I'm in bed for at least a few days.

I haven't been able to read as much as I once did. I enjoyed reading, but now I get dizzy a chapter or two in. I have glasses now, but they are not helping much.

Working in technology and being at a screen has made things difficult. I've started using just one monitor; I dim the screen often and sometimes take meetings on a headset and walk around my office to reduce screen time. It's helped a lot, but I haven't found a solution than just managing my VM.

**The Ugly:**  
I have 3 types of VM issues, the first is just dizziness that happens if I bend over, read a book, etc, this is day to day. It's frustrating, but I've learned to deal with it.

The next issue I call an episode. It's when I suddenly have a feeling of dizziness, the feeling of disassociation, and then terrible VM symptoms that typically last 30 minutes to a day. This happens less frequently but can be concerning when traveling or outside my home. I used to have a panic attack with this, but I now calmly find a place to ride it out. I know many of you have rescue medicine, but I haven't found anything yet for that.

The last one is what I call a flareup; it's when I'm out for a week or two, unable to work, have trouble sleeping, and am mostly in bed. This has only happened a few times. This is what started my diagnosis journey, which involved 10+ doctors over a couple years. Another one happened this summer, and I was worried I was going to have to go on disability (terrifying time). I was fortunate that I was not traveling during this period of the year. I am going through a minor one right now as well. I believe it's been triggered by stress with a recent cancer diagnosis in the family and my move to the northeast coming up, as the previous flareups were all in the summer.

I also was in the ER earlier in the year because of medication I was taking for my VM, specifically when my dosage of Nortriptyline was increased. I had a blood pressure of 180/130 and pulse of 140. To say the least, I've been very shy about trying further medication, though I'm open to revisiting this in the future.  
  
I know this was very long, but I hope sharing my journey with you will help you somehow.",1,1734673797.0,VestibularMigraines,0,1.0,False

1hid0cl,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hid0cl/am_i_wasting_my_time_hoping_something_will_come/,Am I wasting my time hoping something will come of this? ,"I (30F) am interested in a guy (32M) who used to work at the same company as me but who recently left. A week or so before he left, we got chatting on our work messenger and it culminated in him asking me if I wanted to have lunch together. I did want to, but I declined as it seemed like his intentions were flirty and I‚Äôm in a relationship. He was respectful of that. However, we kept chatting, and during a work social shortly after he told me that he‚Äôs attracted to me. I felt the same way and I told him the feeling was mutual, but because I‚Äôm in a relationship, we could be friends and nothing more. He said that he wouldn‚Äôt be able to be friends with me as he didn‚Äôt think he‚Äôd be able to stop liking me. He proceeded to tell me that he doesn‚Äôt fancy me because of the way I look, but rather because of who I am, and listed the qualities about me he admires. I was really taken aback as no-one has ever spoken to me like that before. I was especially stunned by it as I‚Äôve dated guys in the past who didn‚Äôt respect who I am as a person and who didn‚Äôt treat me well. I was pretty shocked and told him truthfully that this information made me feel like my head was scrambled. At that moment I realised that I don‚Äôt just fancy him for the way he looks either - he‚Äôs handsome, but his personality is what I‚Äôm really drawn to. He‚Äôs kind, warm, smart, open and funny. He said that we seem to have an intense connection and this doesn‚Äôt come around very often. I certainly haven‚Äôt felt this way before either. 

He walked me back to the train station on my way home and almost kissed me, but I told him not to as again, I‚Äôm in a relationship. I went home in a daze. He had given me his number and I debated texting him, but I did the next day and we ended up speaking on the phone. He confessed to me that he‚Äôs also in a relationship, so I was annoyed that he hadn‚Äôt told me that to begin with. Essentially, he says the relationship is mostly good but they feel more like roommates than romantic partners. I told him about my situation in turn, in that while I love my partner and see them as my best friend, I have had persistent doubts that the relationship isn‚Äôt right for me, and have been thinking about ending it for a long time. I‚Äôve had these doubts long before this situation came about. I told him that I‚Äôm thinking of breaking up with my partner, but he needs to figure out what he wants. We agreed not to talk for a bit while he does that. 

Cut to last weekend, we saw each other briefly at the work Christmas party, and messaged again after. I‚Äôm not proud of admitting this, but the messages did turn sexual because we have a really strong attraction to each other. However, my mood shifted, and I spoke to him on the phone earlier and told him that I think we should take a break from talking over Christmas because the situation is making me upset. I am feeling vulnerable and I don‚Äôt know where I stand with him, and I have made it clear that I‚Äôm interested and I would want to explore something with him, but I don‚Äôt know what he wants. 

He said that he hasn‚Äôt entirely figured out what he wants, and said that he felt as though getting to know each other as people, rather than just the sexual attraction, had fallen by the wayside recently and he sees that as his fault because of the strength of his attraction to me. He suggested we take a break to reset over Christmas and then get to know each other better as people, in a less intense way than we have been - like maybe going for coffee. 

We ended up having a really good conversation with lots of laughter, and I do feel like a weight has been lifted. All the same, I can‚Äôt help but thinking, am I wasting my time hoping we could be something? I‚Äôm breaking up with my partner, which is not because of this new connection, but I can‚Äôt lie, I am really hoping that he will break up with his girlfriend as well. But experience has taught me that actions speak louder than words and I don‚Äôt want to be acting like a fool hoping he chooses me if it‚Äôs probably not going to happen. 

TL;DR I met someone and we have an intense connection. We are both in relationships, I will soon be single but he is still figuring stuff out. Am I wasting my time hoping he will end things with her and want to pursue something with me? ",0,1734673103.0,relationships,0,0.5,False

1hictxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/1hictxf/honey_jarsweetening_spell/,Honey Jar/Sweetening Spell,"# Hi Spellcasters and Enthusiasts!

I wanted to share some knowledge and general recipes for one of my most favorite spells!

**The Honey Jar Spell AKA Sweetening Spell**!

Of course, everyone‚Äôs practice is different, everyone‚Äôs methods, and everyone‚Äôs ingredients will be different so do not quote what I say as the Bible. Just use it as a general guide! It would also be nice for other practitioner‚Äôs to share their perspective, if comfortable, and for enthusiasts to share your thoughts or success.

Basic understanding of what a honey jar spell is: Commonly used to ‚Äúsweeten‚Äù someone up to you. If someone has bad feelings about you or even if they have good/neutral feelings about you, this spell can entice the person to think well of you. This is NOT a love spell though, just fyi.

Of course with any spell, you have to be reasonable with expectations. You can‚Äôt expect someone to like you or have great feelings about you if you‚Äôve caused them or someone they love great physical/mental harm, or something else extreme. You also can‚Äôt expect the result you want to just fall in your lap without doing consistent work on your part. For example, don‚Äôt belittle your Person of Interest (POI) and expect they‚Äôll suddenly have good feelings about you.

Some common ingredients for a honey jar I use:

* honey (I prefer organic/raw honey with or without honey comb)
* small mason jar
* sugar (I prefer unprocessed brown sugar or vegan sugar)
* vanilla bean stick
* chamomile
* roses
* cinnamon stick
* bay leaf
* the POI‚Äôs favorite piece of candy
* a picture of your POI and, optionally, yourself (create a petition with this picture. Please look up how to create a petition as that is not what I'm explaining here today)

*I prefer using ingredients that are as clean and unprocessed as possible due to my preferences of having as little ingredient mishandling as possible through cross contamination.*

When I create my honey jar, I enjoy just thinking about positive things, talking to it and myself nicely, and ‚Äútalking to my poi‚Äù sweetly. There‚Äôs no right or wrong when putting your contents into the jar either. You can choose to pour a half amount of honey into the jar then your ingredients (this ensures you don‚Äôt spill it trying to put the rest of your stuff in there) or you can go about it layer by layer. Really up to you!

Once all my ingredients are inside the jar, I close it up and gently shake it in my hands while imagining what I want to happen. Once I feel satisfied, I typically choose a small pink candle (but you can use red or white, depending on your intentions) and light it ONTOP of the jar lid. The candle wax should naturally drip down onto and over the jar which ‚Äúseals‚Äù it.

Once the candle fully burns through and the wax is over the jar, there‚Äôs nothing else you have to do for now! You‚Äôre done! Leave the wax on the jar and just store it somewhere dark and hidden. About once a week, repeat the process of saying what your intentions are for the spell, imagining it happening, and give it a gentle shake to re-energize it. You can also relight another candle on top of it, if you choose. Just be sure to leave the wax remains on the jar!

I have seen success using a honey jar spell multiple times. As a regular practitioner who is constantly trying to explore, learn, and practice my craft, I often test new and old spells to see what does and doesn‚Äôt work for me.

I only have one issue I‚Äôve noticed. I tried using both ground and whole coffee beans before to speed up the ‚Äúsweetening‚Äù process. For one situation, I felt it did speed it up, but there was an immediate drawback from my POI. My POI was very nice and sweet to me, but it was so short lived out of nowhere. The best way I could explain that is like the crash effect you get after consuming caffeine. High energy one moment, then extremely tired the next.

Another situation with using coffee is the ‚Äúbittersweet‚Äù effect I got. They sort of had better feelings towards me, but it felt forced or strained. I remember my POI saying to me ‚ÄúYou did nothing wrong and you‚Äôre absolutely sweet, but for whatever reason, I just feel unsure‚Äù. A very bittersweet feeling.

Alas, you‚Äôve made it to the end! Again, do not take this guideline as the Bible as it‚Äôs very basic/general and only gives a dusting on the process. Please add or omit whatever you like to suit your needs. Honey is my most FAVORITE ingredient to use for all of my spells due to its many worldly benefits along with being so yummy so, naturally, I felt inclined to share. Since I'm so familiar with this spell, I may have forgotten to detail something within the process so feel free to ask **in this post** if there's anything I may have missed!

Good luck!!!",3,1734672434.0,Spells,0,1.0,False
1hicszk,https://www.reddit.com/r/HydrogenWaterFast/comments/1hicszk/10_reasons_why_how_much_water_in_a_day_should_i/,10 Reasons Why How Much Water In A Day Should I Drink Is Essential For A Healthier Life,"The Importance of Hydration: How Much Water in a Day Should I Drink?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is a vital aspect of maintaining a healthy life. Many people wonder, ‚Äúhow much water in a day should I drink?‚Äù The answer can vary depending on several factors, but the importance of sufficient water intake remains constant. Here are ten reasons why ensuring you drink enough water daily can lead to a healthier life.

### 1. Supports Physical Performance

When you engage in physical activities, your body loses water through sweat. Dehydration can lead to fatigue, decreased endurance, and poor performance. Drinking enough water helps you maintain your energy levels, especially during workouts or outdoor activities.

### 2. Aids in Digestion

Water plays a crucial role in digestion. It helps dissolve nutrients so your body can absorb them. Additionally, staying hydrated can prevent constipation by keeping your digestive tract functioning smoothly. This not only helps you feel comfortable but also ensures your body is efficient in processing food.

### 3. Enhances Brain Function

Your brain is highly sensitive to changes in hydration levels. A lack of water can lead to difficulties in concentration, increased feelings of fatigue, and even mood swings. Drinking enough water ensures that your brain stays sharp, focused, and ready to tackle daily challenges.

### 4. Regulates Body Temperature

Water helps regulate your body temperature by enabling sweating and respiration. When it‚Äôs hot outside or during exercise, your body sweats to cool down. Proper hydration is essential for this process to function correctly. Keep your water intake balanced, especially in warmer climates or during physical exertion.

### 5. Promotes Healthy Skin

Hydration has a noticeable impact on your skin. Drinking sufficient water helps keep your skin moisturized and can improve elasticity, reducing the appearance of dryness and wrinkles. It's one of the simplest ways to support your skin's health from the inside out.

### 6. Supports Kidney Function

Your kidneys play a crucial role in filtering waste from your blood. Adequate hydration helps your kidneys efficiently eliminate toxins and prevent kidney stones. Drinking enough water each day is essential to maintaining healthy kidney function and balance electrolyte levels.

### 7. Aids Weight Management

Drinking water can assist in weight management. Sometimes, our bodies confuse thirst with hunger. Staying hydrated helps you avoid unnecessary snacking and can promote a feeling of fullness, which can reduce overall calorie intake. For those wondering how much water in a day should I drink, incorporating water into your routine can be a great weight loss strategy.

### 8. Boosts Immune Function

A well-hydrated body is better equipped to fend off illness. Water helps in the production of lymph, which is essential for the immune system in transporting white blood cells. Keeping hydrated can lower your risk of infections and improve your overall health.

### 9. Enhances Mood and Energy Levels

Dehydration can lead to irritability and mood swings. Ensuring adequate fluid intake can improve your overall sense of well-being and keep your energy levels stable throughout the day. This is especially important for people with busy schedules who need to stay alert and focused.

### 10. Prevents Dehydration-Related Health Issues

Maintaining proper hydration can help prevent a variety of health issues linked to dehydration, such as headaches, dizziness, and urinary tract infections. Knowing how much water in a day should I drink can provide insight into balancing your intake and avoiding these discomforts.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
Adequate water intake into your daily routine can have lasting positive effects on your health. While the specific amount may vary per individual and circumstance, aiming for around 8-10 cups of water per day is a good rule of thumb. Listen to your body and adjust your water consumption based on your activity level, climate, and personal health needs. Remember, staying hydrated is essential for a healthier life!

Common Myths and Misconceptions About Daily Water Intake
--------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to hydration, many people fall victim to common myths and misconceptions about daily water intake. Understanding these misunderstandings is crucial for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Let's explore some of the most prevalent beliefs surrounding how much water you should drink each day.

### 1. The 8x8 Rule is a One-Size-Fits-All Solution

Many individuals believe that everyone needs to drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily. While this guideline is easy to remember, it doesn‚Äôt consider individual needs. Your required water intake can vary based on factors such as age, weight, gender, activity level, and climate.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### 2. You Can Rely Solely on Thirst

Some people think they should only drink when they feel thirsty. While thirst is a natural signal, it might not always indicate hydration needs, especially in certain conditions. For example, elderly individuals often experience a diminished sense of thirst. Instead of waiting for thirst, stay mindful of water intake throughout the day.

### 3. All Fluids Are Created Equal

It‚Äôs a common belief that any liquid counts toward your daily water intake. While beverages like tea, coffee, and juice do contribute to hydration, they also contain caffeine or sugars that can affect hydration levels. Plain water is still the best option for ensuring optimal hydration.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### 4. You Need More Water if You're Active

Many think that if you engage in exercise, you need to double or triple your water intake. While it‚Äôs true that physical activity increases your hydration needs, it‚Äôs essential to listen to your body rather than fixate on a specific number of ounces. Always rehydrate according to how you feel.

### 5. You Can‚Äôt Drink Too Much Water

Overhydration, although rare, can lead to a condition called hyponatremia, where your body‚Äôs sodium levels become dangerously low. It‚Äôs vital to balance water intake with electrolyte replacement, especially after intense workouts or heat exposure.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### 6. You Should Always Drink Water Before Meals

Drinking water before meals is often recommended as a way to control appetite and aid digestion. However, many believe you should always drink water before eating. While some hydration before meals can aid digestion, overdoing it may lead to discomfort or reduced appetite.

### 7. Temperature Doesn‚Äôt Matter

Some people think the temperature of the water doesn‚Äôt affect hydration. However, consuming cold water might be more refreshing during hot weather, potentially encouraging you to drink more. Conversely, warm water may aid digestion and help you relax, serving different purposes for hydration.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### 8. You Only Need Water on Hot Days

Another misconception is that hydration is necessary only during summer or warm conditions. In reality, your body loses water every day through sweat, urine, and respiration, regardless of the weather. Staying hydrated is essential year-round.

### 9. Eating Fruits and Vegetables Doesn't Count

Many individuals believe that only drinking water matters for hydration. However, fruits and vegetables, such as cucumbers, oranges, and watermelons, can contribute significantly to your daily water intake. Including these hydrating foods in your diet can help maintain hydration levels.

### 10. Young and Healthy People Don‚Äôt Need to Worry About Hydration

Some people think that age and health deter hydration needs. However, young individuals can still become dehydrated, especially during physical activities. Maintaining hydration is essential for everyone, regardless of age or health status.

Understanding the facts about daily water intake versus misconceptions can lead to better hydration practices and ultimately promote a healthier life. Stay informed and listen to your body to discover the right hydration balance for you!

The Role of Water in Physical Health and Performance
----------------------------------------------------

Water is often regarded as the cornerstone of physical health, and for good reasons. It's not just a thirst-quencher; it's critical for maintaining numerous bodily functions, enhancing physical performance, and ensuring overall well-being. Understanding the role of water can lead to better health choices and improved daily functioning.

### The Importance of Staying Hydrated

Hydration is vital for everyone, regardless of age or activity level. When we think about how much water we should drink daily, it‚Äôs essential to recognize that adequate hydration fuels our bodies in countless ways. The ""8x8"" rule (eight 8-ounce glasses of water each day) is a common guideline, but individual needs can vary significantly. Factors such as climate, exercise frequency, and personal health conditions can influence how much water you should consume.

### Keep Water Accessible

Place a water bottle on your desk, kitchen counter, or wherever you spend most of your time. When water is within reach, you‚Äôre more likely to sip throughout the day. Consider using a bottle that tracks your intake, so you can see how much you are drinking.

### Set Reminders

Sometimes, life gets busy, and it‚Äôs easy to forget to drink water. Use your phone or a hydration app to set reminders throughout the day. These alerts can prompt you to take a quick water break every hour.

### Add Flavor

If plain water doesn‚Äôt excite you, try infusing it with fruits, herbs, or vegetables. Here are some delicious combinations:

- Lemon and mint
- Cucumber and lime
- Strawberry and basil
- Watermelon and rosemary

This not only makes water more enjoyable to drink but also adds a hint of flavor without any added sugars.

### Choose Water Instead of Other Beverages

When you go out to eat or grab a drink, choose water instead of sugary sodas or other high-calorie beverages. This helps cut down on extra calories while ensuring you‚Äôre getting the hydration your body needs.

### Boosts Brain Function

Your brain relies heavily on water. Approximately 75% of the human brain is water, and even slight dehydration can impair its function. When you don't drink enough water, you may experience issues with concentration, memory, and overall cognitive performance. Studies show that adequate hydration can improve focus, problem-solving abilities, and learning. Just a glass of water might be all you need to perk up your brain!

### Regulates Mood

Hydration is closely linked to emotional well-being. Dehydration can lead to irritability and increased stress. Studies suggest that individuals who are well-hydrated are less prone to mood swings and anxiety. When you drink enough water, your body can eliminate toxins effectively, helping you feel more balanced and less overwhelmed by stressors.

### Enhances Energy Levels

When you're hydrated, your energy levels remain stable. Dehydration can cause fatigue, making you feel sluggish and unmotivated. Remember, fatigue can impact your mood negatively. Drinking water can keep your energy spikes stable, contributing to overall mental clarity and emotional resilience.

### Improves Sleep Quality

Adequate hydration can also improve your sleep quality. Poor sleep affects cognitive abilities and mood. If you are well-hydrated, you are less likely to wake up feeling parched during the night, allowing you to enjoy uninterrupted rest. Quality sleep boosts your mental sharpness and makes you more receptive to positive moods during the day.

### Fosters Physical Health

Drinking enough water doesn‚Äôt just quench your thirst; it nourishes every cell in your body. When you're physically healthy, your mind tends to be sharp and resilient. Hydration aids in flushing out waste from your body, ensuring your organs function optimally. This ensures that no physical discomfort impedes your mental clarity or emotional well-being.

### Prevents Brain Fog

- **Maintain Clear Thoughts:** Staying hydrated helps maintain sharp thinking. Dehydration often manifests as brain fog.
- **Enhance Mood Stability:** Regular fluid intake contributes to emotional balance, reducing mood swings.
- **Combat Headaches:** Drinking enough water can reduce the occurrence of headaches, which can cloud your mental clarity.

### Helps with Stress Management

Hydration has been shown to affect stress levels. When you are dehydrated, your body releases more cortisol, a stress hormone. By keeping yourself well-hydrated, you can help keep those cortisol levels in check, allowing you to manage stress more effectively and maintain your mental focus.

### Our Dependence on Consistency

To gain the full benefits of hydration on both mental clarity and mood, it's important to make drinking water a daily habit. Consider incorporating water-based foods like fruits and vegetables into your diet. Simple habits, such as carrying a water bottle or setting reminders to drink, can ensure that you get enough hydration throughout the day.

### Listen to Your Body

Your body often gives signals when you need water; listen closely to them. Thirst is an obvious sign, but other indicators include dry mouth, headaches, and fatigue. Responding to these warnings can help you stay hydrated, ensuring optimal mental performance and a stable mood.

I (F16) went through the drive through this afternoon while driving my brother & his friend to curling.
The boys got farmers wraps & hot chocolates, while I ordered a small iced coffee. 

Normally when I get an iced coffee, I sometimes order it half sweet. I do this because IF THERE IS TOO MUCH CREAM (which isn‚Äôt always but sometimes) it twists in my guts and makes me run to the bathroom. This time I forgot to, realized it after I pulled away from the screen and was like ‚Äúshoot, whatever, It‚Äôs not a big deal, usually I‚Äôm ok.‚Äù

I pay, pass back food, and when they hand me my iced coffee it‚Äôs almost completely white. I‚Äôm not even joking. It‚Äôs like adding two drops of dye to white frosting. The iced coffee was a VERY light shade of brown, which meant someone had a free for all with the cream.
I was like ‚Äú.. okay, maybe it‚Äôs not as bad as it looks? Just lots of milk?‚Äù I take a small sip and yeah no it‚Äôs so sweet that it‚Äôs gross. I could‚Äôve started a side business selling cream specifically from that order.

I ask them if I‚Äôd be able to get it half sweet, which was not my original order mind you. 

The lady at the drive through is rude. I‚Äôll be blunt about that. she tells me that if I want to get it half sweet I need to tell them half sweet when I order, and that I‚Äôm making a lot of extra work by not ordering correctly. That‚Äôs not what I thought made her rude though, that‚Äôs a perfectly reasonable explanation, her tone and body language made it sound like I was the scum of the earth.

Like I was an annoying ass customer purposely being difficult. Like if I ordered a hot chocolate, drank half, got to the end was like changed my mind tee hee! Give me a free French vanilla instead!

I was holding my drink out through my window, so I was like ‚Äúoh okay sorry‚Äù and started pulling it back in because ?? I felt bad, I was just going to drive away and bin it because I couldn‚Äôt drink it. The lady stares it down and says ‚Äújust give it here‚Äù 

She holds it, stares, says ‚Äúyou drank this?‚Äù I never got a chance to respond, she says ‚Äúshe drank this‚Äù then leans backwards and yells ‚ÄúSHE DRANK IT‚Äù and pours it right out the drive through window. 

30seconds later a man gave me an iced coffee half sweet. I felt really bad because I idn‚Äôt want to be a bother, and I didn‚Äôt want to be that annoying entitled customer. 

Here‚Äôs are my case arguments: 

‚Ä¢ I literally could not handle that much creamer in my drink, I‚Äôd be locked on the pot. 

‚Ä¢ I have NEVER received an iced coffee with that much milk/cream before. It was fucking ridiculous.

‚Ä¢ Even if I hadn‚Äôt requested half sweet, I would have asked them to remake it because holy moly even a sane person couldn‚Äôt handle that much sugar

Against:

‚Ä¢ I requested a new drink different from my original order
‚Ä¢ I took a sip from said drink (I don‚Äôt know if this violates anything but just saying)

‚Ä¢ I should‚Äôve asked for half sweet in the first place knowing that sometimes full cream gives me a stomachache (they add more than they‚Äôre supposed to)

\- Party Palace: Once I got the autocooker I actually really started to like this one!

\- Flipping Pancake: I did not really like this one it was really frustrating. I think my biggest gripe was not being able to mix more pancake dough unless the bowl was empty. Also, the coffee didn't refill fast enough.

\- TGI Fridays: This one was okay for me. The kitchen upgrades were soooo expensive in terms of coins that it took me quite a while to get on a level where it was enjoyable and I wasn't losing customers.

I was driving home around 5:40 from having coffee in Chester on HWY 17M when I saw this orb floating soooo low, it looked giant!
The orbs that have been over our home have been extremly high up (You can see my previous posts for a visual) so this was an extreme shock for me.

I then decided to go on the other side of US HWY 6 to see if I could get a better look at this orb. I couldnt see anything tree covered from the side roads I had taken. I drove so far down that when I arrived back to HWY 17M I was back down to Main st in Chester. I decided to find a safe place to park where this orb was visible. When I got down to the orb veiwing spot i pulled out my binoculars to get a clearer look at the orb, as i was staring at this low color changing orb it then began to float farther away from me getting smaller as it moved.

The school is a management university and my scholarship allows me stay in the country for one year. During my first 3 months, I started talking to a girl I met at the school cafe. I'd always drop by after my classes to have a coffee and we started flirting back and forth. Eventually we went out on a couple of dates and started to get close. However I let her know that I would have to travel out of the city for work as part of my scholarship (6 months with a reputable company) then Id return to Jakarta, since then I noticed she got distant. She was hesitant to talk to me up until the day I left. One day, I discovered after I left she stopped following me on Instagram. I don't know what I did wrong or even how to approach this situation.

What am I doing wrong? ,"After having a Breville Express for 4 years and getting pretty good shots out of it, I finally thought I would take the plunge a few months ago and take myself to the next level.

I bought a Profitec Go and a Breville Smart Grinder Pro. Ever since I feel like I'm doing something wrong because I am struggling to pull a consistent shot. It's to the point where I'm just buying a coffee on the way to work instead because I'm getting that deflated.

I'm really hoping someone could give me some advice or point out what I'm doing wrong.

To walk through my process, I've included some photos and videos.

# Process

**Grind:**

* 18g basket
* Finest grind setting (2), running for 14.8 seconds
* Produces 20g of grind (I know it's higher than 18g, but the issue during extraction is worse if I go 18g).

[Grind process photos.](https://imgur.com/a/6dAgzUM)

**Extract:**

* Let my machine heat up to 93degC,
* flush the system for 5-10 seconds
* insert the portafilter
* start the extraction.

This is where my issues predominantly seem to be. No matter what I do I can't get the pressure to get up to the 9.5 I'm hoping for and my extract just seems to flow through. I've tried with a puck screen as well to see if that increases pressure, but it seems to be largely unnoticeable.

Here is a video of my extraction: [Link](https://imgur.com/a/DWlcQzX)

I've checked the pressure adjustment on top of the machine with a blank basket, and it's showing the pressure is set to 10 (I adjusted it up from 9.5 to see if that made a difference).

Since then, the Arrival has been in the sock-drawer.

Every month, I split a PayPal purchase with one dollar on this card, which would be waived on statement date.
Twice a year, I buy a $1.05 coffee from McDonalds, to show some activities and my ability to pay.
Basically, the issuer earns nothing from me the deadbeat customer.

Earlier this year, there was a slew of fraud charges on this account, which was promptly stopped by the system.
Nevertheless, the issuer must have lost a bunch of money in the process.

Today I noticed the credit line is an odd number: $3019.
I checked CreditKarma and saw the credit line on this account has been $7500.
I checked *Documents center*, and there's the letter.

Regarding Your Barclays Arrival¬Æ Mastercard¬Æ

Dear yoursunny,

A recent review of your Barclays Arrival¬Æ Mastercard¬Æ account shows that a significant portion of your available credit limit is not being used. To align with your card usage over the last 12 months, we‚Äôve reduced your credit limit to $3,019.00.

While we believe this new limit provides appropriate flexibility for your future spending needs, you may request reinstatement of your credit line within 60 days of this letter. Please note that
reinstatement of your credit line is subject to standard credit evaluation. If there is a security freeze on your credit bureau, first contact TransUnion to unfreeze or temporarily lift the security freeze.

To request reinstatement, log in to your account at BarclaysUS.com and go to the ‚ÄòServices‚Äô tab, then select ‚ÄòRequest credit line increase‚Äô.

We value your business and want to continue to serve your financial needs.

Sincerely,
Barclays

---

Looks like all my bad deeds with Barclaycard are finally catching up on me.
Since I do not intend to increase spending on this card, I do not plan to press the reinstatement request button.

My other card with the same issuer, Barclays View (formerly Uber Visa), is also in the sock-drawer and sees similar activities.
For now it has retained its $7000 credit line, but I can smell the hammer coming.

During a recent trip, I charged $73 of restaurant meals on the Barclays View.
I hope it's enough to make amends with them on this card.

1hiceo8,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1hiceo8/does_my_husband_actually_hate_me/,Does my husband actually hate me? ,"My husband and I have been married for almost a year. Together for 2.5. We have a daughter and I had children before we married. It‚Äôs a full house of 8 people. I am a sahm/cottage food baker and business owner/ first generation new farmer and artist who dabbles in social media profits. Most of my day to day tasks involve slaving away over my home and being chased mercilessly by my boob barnacle. Ideally I try to break away every chance I get to ‚Äúwork‚Äù on something but I spend a lot of time feeling like I‚Äôm unproductive and have nothing to show other than a somewhat put together home. Because  swear to you almost my whole day I am cleaning. I am not the kind of person who can focus or accomplish much when there is a mess around me. Since my work requires cleanliness and creativity, I don‚Äôt get to do much. So when my husband comes home I always expect some sort of help. We have discussed SO MANY TIMES, how I feel I need more time to do my things and how I feel like I am not valued and how I want to enjoy my family but I can‚Äôt when I am just their resource/ slave. We have discussed and agreed on equity in household and childcare chores. We have an understanding and he has expressed AGREEMENT. But EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. He comes home. He piddles for an hour or 2. He grumps around and looms over the children monitoring their every movement and getting annoyed SO EASILY. Making everyone walk on eggshells. If I ask him to do a task like feed the baby dinner. He will literally make the food and walk away and FORGET. Then as soon as he sits down somewhere he falls asleep. EVERY SINGLE NIGHT. Usually it‚Äôs 6-7. He stays asleep through the entire evening routine, the cleanup the bedtimes everything. I struggle with the baby until about 11-12 until she goes down for her first nap because she still doesn‚Äôt sleep through the night at 17 months old. When she finally goes down I like to have a coffee and a porch break alone. (I am auDhd and sensory avoidant, so my lifestyle and family drain me.) 
As soon as I‚Äôm ready to sit down. He wakes up. He wants to sit with me ‚Äúand spend time together‚Äù and usually insinuates he could also go for sexy time. (He‚Äôs not pushy sexually at all just always up for it) and all I can think is that he is ruining my life and sabotaging the youth I have left. Idk what to think. I know he is tired. I know he has adhd too. But so do I! And so do so many parents. And I just feel like it‚Äôs not an excuse and like he proves every single night that I am not important and my time doesn‚Äôt belong to me and there is a part of me that wonders if he even cares about me. I have never had a partner who has helped in the home and my 2 previous long term relationships were both with abusers. So I do feel sometimes like he justifies his behavior because he doesn‚Äôt hurt me. But this hurts in other ways and I remember when I was a single mom of 5 and before that a single mom of 4 and my home is never this chaotic or dysfunctional. He adds so much to the messes. Leaving dirty piles of clothes in the floors like we are teenagers. Opening packages of socks and leaving the trash on the counter for 3 days. Leaving half drank cups everywhere, so many things I could list. But then he just sleeps and acts so rude when no one enjoys his company. Idk what to do I love this man but I don‚Äôt think he likes me. ",3,1734670876.0,family,3,1.0,False

Overwhelm their phone lines with calls demanding answers.

This has led to my room becoming what I would call a neat dumpster. All the duvets and blankets, jackets is put in my closet, leading me to have no space for my own clothes. My parents have a walk in closet that's far bigger than mine and my sister has the same sized. 

I don't like the mess, so every holiday I try to clean it up, throw or donate anything that I don't have a use for (awards from forced extracurricular/ broken stuff). My parents are insanely annoyed at the stuff I throw away, because their mentality is 'if it has a value of five bucks or more, keep it'. I can't keep organising this mess.

I also donate large amounts of clothing, because my family is pretty big on graphic tees and like patterned stuff with logos etc. I myself have a more minimalistic fashion, with plain shirts and jackets.

Our house is constantly a mess. I've never seen it spotlessly clean. You could walk in, and there's mountains of books and papers on the coffee table, wires sticking out, toys that haven't been put away (thing to note: we do clean up like food spills and no food or drink is left to collect dust). My friends constantly ask me for a room tour or house tour, and they send pictures of like spotless living rooms but say, oh sorry it's a bit messy right now. I‚Äôm embarrassed at how messy our house is and I get constantly yelled at to clean something, but the moment I move something that's not mine, it's like, where the hell is this?

How do I organise my room, whilst the family stuff is still in my closet? How can I get my family to cooperate and have like a day of just cleaning? I feel like it's unfair if only I/ my sister have to clean everything, and it's confusing when we move something that's isn't ours.

Stuff to note:
I don't throw away the stuff people give me very often, because I feel bad.

1hibukr,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1hibukr/confessing_to_my_crush/,Confessing to my crush ,"This post will be a long one so bear with me.

I'm a Canadian currently studying in Australia, and over the course of this year, I realize that I have a crush on my friend I've been studying with. 

At first, I thought he may have shown some interest in me because in multiple instances, he would offer to get me coffee or food without having to pay him back. This was before I had any romantic interest in him (from Feb to June of this year). However, I had another friend join our study sessions, and he would get stuff for all of us without charge, so I was like probably not.

It was during one of our breaks this June when I noticed myself trying to text him every day when we were apart. At this point, I was still in denial with having a crush on him. By the end of the month, that's when I was really sure of it.

He's generally a very easy going and enthusiastic person, easy to communicate whenever I'm happy or not happy with him. However, at the end of the school year after our final exam, I wanted to hangout with him and confess my feelings, but I didn't end up telling him because he was busy with other plans with another friend of his. I actually asked him to hangout a month in advance, so I told him I was sad that I would be alone after the final exam. It was quite understandable though because he hadn't seen this friend for 9 years.

He said he would be available after his friend leaves. So on the day his friend is gone, I text him a bunch of times but with no response. The next day, he responds and says we can hangout with some other friends. So again, not a good time to confess my feelings.

Then the day after, I carpooled with him to a school event, and I told him I was sorry I texted him so much on that one day. He told me that he wasn't mad at me, but it's true that this issue should be addressed. He said that he just couldn't handle all the emotion I was giving for being lonely on text (just the realities of being an international student), and I should also look for my other friends for support. It was only the two of us at the time, but that ruined the mood for me to tell him I liked him.

Now I feel like I'm ready to tell him, but I don't know in when and where it would be appropriate. So here's my concerns:

1. We are in different streams in our program, so he will be in a different location a 4-hour drive away from me next year. He wanted to continue our study sessions together online with my other friend, and would like to meet up in-person occasionally to hang out. I told my other friend that I liked him. Should I tell my crush I like him during my study sessions, or in person? Should I wait until it's only the two of us?

2. Will it be possible to remain friends with him if he doesn't feel the same way about me?

3. If he feels the same way, would long distance work between us? He's Australian and I'm Canadian, so I don't know if I would be in Australia or in Canada in the future, let alone the four hour distance we will have.

4. He did say that he is hesitant in having a relationship in med school in a practical sense, but does find people in my program attractive, so should I even bother telling him my feelings for him?

5. My mom would not support a same-sex relationship and I'm currently financially dependent on my parents. Is it worth hiding this part of me from them and also risking them finding out?

If you're still with me, thank you so much for reading this super long post. Any advice is appreciated üôÇ.",2,1734668926.0,askgaybros,2,1.0,False

1hibsls,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTheTraveler/comments/1hibsls/how_many_days_to_see_south_rim_grand_canyon/,How many days to see South Rim Grand Canyon?,"Hey everyone! I recently took an incredible day trip from Las Vegas to the Grand Canyon South Rim, and I just had to share my experience. I've been to Vegas countless times, but this was my first time visiting the Grand Canyon, and wow - it completely blew me away!

I did a ton of research before booking, and I finally settled on this tour package (https://athometouch.com/SouthRim) that seemed to offer the best value for money. For $80, you get everything sorted - transportation, meals, and an experienced guide who really knows their stuff.

The day started early with a hotel pickup around 6 AM. Pro tip: grab a coffee before boarding! The bus was super comfortable with AC and a bathroom, which is crucial for the long ride. Our driver/guide, Mike, kept us entertained with fascinating facts about the desert landscape and local history during the journey.

We made a quick stop in Kingman, Arizona (yes, from the famous Route 66!) to stretch our legs and grab snacks. The real excitement kicked in when we approached the National Geographic Visitor Center. If you're wondering whether to add the IMAX experience - do it! It gives you an amazing overview of the canyon's formation and history.

But nothing prepares you for that first view at Mather Point. Pictures don't do it justice - the sheer scale of the canyon is mind-blowing. We spent about 3 hours exploring different viewpoints along the South Rim. Bright Angel Point was my favorite spot for photos.

Here's a cool option I wish I'd known about earlier - you can upgrade your experience with a Hummer tour along the rim or even a helicopter flight! Some folks in our group did the helicopter tour, and their photos were incredible. If your budget allows, I'd definitely consider these add-ons (available when booking through the link above).

The meal voucher came in handy - I got a decent lunch at one of the rim-side restaurants. The food isn't fancy, but hey, you're not here for the cuisine!

Was the 14-hour day long? Yes. Was it worth it? Absolutely! It's the perfect way to tick the Grand Canyon off your bucket list if you're based in Vegas. The tour handles all the logistics, so you can just focus on taking in the magnificent views.

If you're planning to book, I'd recommend doing it through this link: https://athometouch.com/SouthRim - they often have special deals, and the booking process was super smooth for me.

Quick tips:
- Wear comfortable shoes
- Bring a light jacket (it can get chilly at the rim)
- Don't forget your camera
- Stay hydrated (the altitude is no joke)
- Book in advance during peak season

1hibsll,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1hibsll/how_accurate_are_body_composition_analysis_scales/,How accurate are body composition analysis scales at the gym in calculating body fat?,"So, my new gym has this machine where they did like an inbody scan or something (it's like a scale where you hold two handles and then it estimates your body composition). My results came to like 25% body fat at 87 KG and 5 10 height last month. I did have a small meal and coffee before the test so not sure if it affected it. But I'm kinda surprised by how low that sounds. By their measurements, I'd reach my goal BF% by 77KGs or so but i thought id need to reach like 70KGs. Now I set my goal BF based on those pictures that people show on yt for where people are based on their physique. But I really don't think that I look anything like the 25% bf pics but then again, I could barely tell that it looked like I've lost 10KGs since summer till I went through my old pics after meeting with family members at a party and receiving insane amount of compliments which surprised me because I can't tell the progress in the mirror so it seems I've a distorted image of where I am because of obsessing over this lol.

Hi everyone,
I‚Äôm struggling with my mom, and I‚Äôm at my wit‚Äôs end. She‚Äôs in her early 60s and has always been someone who leans on excuses and avoids taking accountability for things in her control.

For example, she constantly complains about poor sleep, but she smokes a pack of cigarettes a day, drinks multiple coffees, takes frequent naps, eats poorly, and doesn‚Äôt exercise. When I try to point out how these habits affect her sleep, she deflects, shuts down, or gets defensive.

She lacks motivation and confidence, and it feels like she‚Äôs stuck in a cycle she doesn‚Äôt want to get out of. I‚Äôve been trying to help her for as long as I can remember, but I‚Äôm exhausted. I call her out on things because no one else does, and I genuinely want her to find motivation and work toward something.

I‚Äôm looking for any advice, suggestions, or resources (like helpful YouTube videos) on how to approach this. How do I encourage her without her shutting down? How do I stop feeling so drained by the constant battle?

Thanks in advance for any help.

1hibquy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/1hibquy/r1s_dual_max_delivery_1st_week_impressions/,R1S Dual Max - Delivery & 1st Week (Impressions & Experience),"Hello everyone! I officially joined the club this weekend! While I absolutely love the vehicle so far, I wanted to share my experience and give some of my thoughts‚Ä¶

# DELIVERY - POSITIVES:

* **FRIENDLY** \- While my representative was new, she was super helpful and engaging. She always welcomed questions and would seek out answers to anything she was not well versed on.
* **NO EXTERNAL QC ISSUES -** No exterior dents or panel gaps :)
* **ALL FEATURES WERE FUNCTIONAL**

# DELIVERY - NEGATIVES: 

* **CLEANLINESS** \- Hot chocolate (or coffee?) splatters were prevalent across the dashboard, touch screen, and coffee holders. I contacted the service center and they‚Äôre sending me a free cleaning kit for my troubles :) 
* **QUALITY CONTROL** \- There‚Äôs a noticeable gap in the middle console where the wood and plastic meet. This is just forward of the wireless charging pads. I brought this to the attention of the representative and after speaking w/ the service wing, she stated that this was common in all Rivian‚Äôs and that replacement of the plastic pad would result in the same gap. 
* **COMMUNICATION** \- No direct phone line to dealership to update on my ETA (driving in 5hrs for pickup). -WAIT TIME - I waited roughly 45min after my appointment start time arriving at the service center (ATL) to begin paperwork. 
* **VEHICLE READINESS** \- Vehicle was not fully charged upon taking delivery. I had to wait for a full charge before heading home.

# SOFTWARE ISSUES ENCOUNTERED:

* \[FIXED W/ 2024.47.30\] **INVOLUNTARY INFOTAINMENT AUDIO MUTE** \- Audio mutes itself across all apps and Bluetooth devices. Augmenting the volume levels or toggling mute does not fix the issues. Was only remedied by infotainment system restart. It was a little embarrasing encountering this issue on my second or third day of ownership when I was giving a friend a demo drive.
* **APPLE MUSIC CURRENTLY PLAYING DISPLAY** \- When in the Apple Music app, the currently playing menu will not stay anchored to the right side of the screen. Instead, it will self swipe its way off to the right of the screen and outside the observable screen area. Dragging it back with a swipe would only result in it removing itself again a few second later. This was only remedied by toggling to the nav menu and back again. Issue persists at random intervals.

# FEATURES I WOULD LIKE TO SEE: 

* **LAUNCH CONTROL** \- The idea that a $5,000 software-based Performance upgrade doesn‚Äôt immediately add Launch Control to any vehicles in the line up is absurd. This shouldn‚Äôt be reserved to the Tri and Quad motor variants when you‚Äôre paying for a pricey pErFoRmAnCe upgrade. In hindsight, I probably wouldn't have paid for this feature unless it had Launch Control and \*CANNOT\* recommend it until it does.
* **APPLE PODCASTS** \- Transitioning over to Bluetooth to use Apple Podcasts isn‚Äôt a big deal but it would just be a tad more convenient to have the app available on the infotainment system. 
* **APPLE MUSIC REFRESH RATE** \- The refresh rate on the Recently Added tab of the Library in Apple Music only seems to refresh every two to three days. The refresh rate seems like it should be much more frequent or constant to make sure it‚Äôs up to date with recently added songs. 
* **POST-PURCHASE CUSTOMIZATION** \- While I understand the limitations of a relatively new car manufacturer, features such as the Dark Out Package and Dynamic Roof should be able to be added on post-purchase. 
* **AUDIO SETTING PRESETS** \- Continue to make audio quality improvements please. Especially for Premium Audio upgrade purchasers. Also, an EDM EQ setting would be a welcome addition to the genre list currently provided. 
* **CUPHOLDERS** \- Larger in diameter please! I feel like a lot of the target demographic (adventurers and outdoorsman) use larger water bottles than what the 3.25‚Äù diameter cupholders can support. Currently, I‚Äôve only found that fast food to-go cups and shaker bottles fit comfortably in the holders. My Hydroflask and others do not fully seat in the holders.",0,1734668559.0,Rivian,0,0.5,False
