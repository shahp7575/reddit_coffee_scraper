Emery Vaughn was about to hand over a billion–dollar empire–and she couldn’t stop smiling.

“On a scale of one to ‘please slap some sense into you, this ranks somewhere around full–blown insanity.”

Emery ignored her friend Nina’s words as she finished signing the transfer of shares that she prepared for her boyfriend, Samuel.

“Really… Em… Do you want me to slap you in case that would wake you up, or something?”

“Five years,” Emery said, signing the final page. “I tested him for five years he passed.”

Nina grabbed the folder. “These will make him the largest shareholder of your father’s company, which is worth millions. Are you hearing yourself?”

“Worth billions,” Emery said with a grin. “And he stayed with me when he thought I was just an orphan intern. That kind of love deserves everything. Don’t you think so?”

Nina jogged a step ahead to catch up. “Em, seriously. You need to think this through.”

“I already did. Five years, Nina. Five years of hiding who I really am. And he never once made me feel like I wasn’t tightening her grip on her purse\*\*.\*\* “It’s time that I pay him back.”

Emery nodded. “Because he earned it. Tomorrow, he’s going to meet my father and we can get married **in** secret. This **is** my dream, alright?**”** 

They reached the building entrance when a sudden screech of tires made them stop. A sleek black **car** pulled up at the curb.

Before they could react, a wave of people swarmed the sidewalk. Reporters shoved their way forward, cameras flashing, mics shoved ahead. One of them clipped Emery’s shoulder, nearly knocking her off balance.

“Whoa!” Nina grabbed her, steadying her before she could fall.

“What the hell–” Emery started, but her words were drowned out by screams.

Fans were pushing past them now\*\*,\*\* shouting a woman’s name.

“Talia! Is Talia here?**”** 

“Talia! We love you\*\*!\*\*”

“Talia, Look at me!”

Security immediately rushed to create **a** barrier, but the crowd kept moving forward. Because of this\*\*,\*\* Emery and Nina were pushed against the **glass** doors of the building. One of the security guards shoved a fan **back**, and in the chaos, both Emery and Nina stumbled to the ground.

Emery grabbed Nina’s arm and tried to **stand**, but another **wave** of screaming fans pressed toward the car. Her heart pounded as she pulled herself up. What the **heck is** going on? She turned her head just in time to see the door of the car **open**.

Then **a** familiar face stepped out.

Samuel Dwight. Her Samuel.

**A** woman got out *of* the **car** and stood next to him. It was another familiar face\*\*.\*\* 

Almost immediately, the reporters shouted over **one** another.

“Mr. Samuel Dwight! Is it true you’re **marrying** Talia **Arden?”** 

He **paused** for a second, adjusted his **coat,** then nodded. \*\*“\*\*Yes, it’s true. **We’ll** be holding **the** engagement **ceremony very** soon.

Emery blinked.

Chapter 1

Another reporter pushed forward. “**Is** it true she’s pregnant?”

Samuel looked straight ahead. “That’s a very personal matter. I hope you can respect our privacy.”

He had barely finished speaking when another PR handler beside him handed out printed invitations. “The ceremony will be held this Saturday at the Azure Grand Hotel. A formal press conference will follow.”

That set the crowd off. More fans rushed forward, shouting Talia’s name. Phones were lifted, flashes blinding. Several people shoved against each other, trying to get closer. It was almost impossible to move.“¶”

Emery held on to Nina tightly as they were pushed backward. One of the cameras hit her shoulder, hard enough to sting. Yet she ignored it as she looked at Samuel again.

H

He didn’t even glance in her direction. However, this was not enough to stop her. She marched inside the building, fuming followed behind Samuel.

“What the hell are you doing?**”** Nina asked, pulling her back.

**as** she

“Did you hear that?” Emery asked, her face paling. At first, she wasn’t sure if she heard it correctly, but that was clearly Samuel. She wasn’t blind or deaf. That was him! “He’s marrying someone.”

Nina grabbed Emery’s arm. “Em, stop. Don’t do this. Not here.”

Emery yanked her arm free. “He’s marrying someone\*\*,”\*\* she said. “Someone that’s not me!”

She moved fast, weaving through the lobby and heading straight for the elevators. Samuel had just stepped inside with Talia and his secretary. Seeing this, Emery quickened her pace, but one of the guards blocked her path.

“Mr. Dwight asked not to be disturbed,” the guard said. “He wants to be alone with Miss Arden.”

Emery didn’t stop. “Do you know who I am?” she snapped, her voice loud enough for some people to notice.

That got Samuel’s attention. He looked at her–just for a moment. His eyes lingered, filled with something unreadable. But he said nothing, letting the elevator doors close.

“Oh, hell no.” Emery didn’t wait. She turned sharply and bolted toward the stairwell. She could hear Nina shout her name behind her, but Emery didn’t slow down.

“Emery! Emery, stop!”

Emery didn’t slow down. She yanked off her heels and clutched them in one hand, feet pounding up the stairs. Her breath came hard and fast. Her legs burned her chest squeezed tight–but hey, all that cardio was finally paying off.

“Wait–just wait!” Nina called again, struggling behind her. Emery glanced back once to see Nina leaning against the railing on the sixth floor, gasping for air.

“Go,” Nina said between breaths. “Just go.”

Emery didn’t look back again.

By the tenth floor, her knees buckled slightly, her chest rising and falling **fast**. She pushed the door open and stepped into the hallway. Two men in black stood outside Samuel’s office\*\*.\*\* She recognized them–his personal security. Familiar faces. Faces that used to nod at her when she brought coffee when she left in the mornings when **she** stayed over,

She marched straight toward the door, heels still in hand.

“You can’t go in,” **one** of them said, stepping forward. “You’re not allowed on this floor without clearance.”

“Does he know I’m out here\*\*?\*\*” she asked.

“We’re following instructions,” the other guard said. “Please **step away**.”

“I’m not leaving,” Emery said. “Tell him I’m out here\*\*!\*\*”

Just as she expected\*\*, they\*\* didn’t move.

**“Samuel!”** she shouted\*\*,\*\* her voice echoing down the hallway\*\*. “**Samuel**, open\*\* the damn door\*\*!”\*\*

The two guards stepped in immediately. One of them reached for her arm.

“I said don’t touch me!” Emery snapped, backing away from the guards.

Before either of them could respond, the office door swung open.

Emery barely had time to register the older woman’s expression before a hand shot out and struck her across the face.

The slap was sharp and fast, her cheek instantly stinging as her head jerked to the side. She stumbled back, heels slipping from her grip and hitting the floor with a dull thud. Her hand flew up to her cheek, but she didn’t speak. Not yet.

“Hold her down!” Vanessa barked.

Emery’s heart pounded as the guards hesitated. She couldn’t move, couldn’t speak–not from fear, but from the pure shock of it.

Then she heard him.

Mom, what are you doing!?” Samuel’s voice cut through the noise\*\*.\*\* 

Emery’s eyes snapped toward him\*\*,\*\* but her **face** burned too much to form a reply.

“What the hell–” Emery started, but her words were drowned out by screams.

Fans were pushing past them now\*\*,\*\* shouting a woman’s name.

“Talia! Is Talia here?**”** 

“Talia! We love you\*\*!\*\*”

Then **a** familiar face stepped out.

Samuel Dwight. Her Samuel.

**A** woman got out *of* the **car** and stood next to him. It was another familiar face\*\*.\*\* 

Almost immediately, the reporters shouted over **one** another.

Another reporter pushed forward. “**Is** it true she’s pregnant?”

Samuel looked straight ahead. “That’s a very personal matter. I hope you can respect our privacy.”

He had barely finished speaking when another PR handler beside him handed out printed invitations. “The ceremony will be held this Saturday at the Azure Grand Hotel. A formal press conference will follow.”

That set the crowd off. More fans rushed forward, shouting Talia’s name. Phones were lifted, flashes blinding. Several people shoved against each other, trying to get closer. It was almost impossible to move.“¶”

Emery held on to Nina tightly as they were pushed backward. One of the cameras hit her shoulder, hard enough to sting. Yet she ignored it as she looked at Samuel again.

He didn’t even glance in her direction. However, this was not enough to stop her. She marched inside the building, fuming followed behind Samuel.

“What the hell are you doing?**”** Nina asked, pulling her back.

**as** she

“Did you hear that?” Emery asked, her face paling. At first, she wasn’t sure if she heard it correctly, but that was clearly Samuel. She wasn’t blind or deaf. That was him! “He’s marrying someone.”

Nina grabbed Emery’s arm. “Em, stop. Don’t do this. Not here.”

Emery yanked her arm free. “He’s marrying someone\*\*,”\*\* she said. “Someone that’s not me!”

She moved fast, weaving through the lobby and heading straight for the elevators. Samuel had just stepped inside with Talia and his secretary. Seeing this, Emery quickened her pace, but one of the guards blocked her path.

“Mr. Dwight asked not to be disturbed,” the guard said. “He wants to be alone with Miss Arden.”

Emery didn’t stop. “Do you know who I am?” she snapped, her voice loud enough for some people to notice.

That got Samuel’s attention. He looked at her–just for a moment. His eyes lingered, filled with something unreadable. But he said nothing, letting the elevator doors close.

“Oh, hell no.” Emery didn’t wait. She turned sharply and bolted toward the stairwell. She could hear Nina shout her name behind her, but Emery didn’t slow down.

“Emery! Emery, stop!”

Emery didn’t slow down. She yanked off her heels and clutched them in one hand, feet pounding up the stairs. Her breath came hard and fast. Her legs burned her chest squeezed tight–but hey, all that cardio was finally paying off.

“Wait–just wait!” Nina called again, struggling behind her. Emery glanced back once to see Nina leaning against the railing on the sixth floor, gasping for air.

“Go,” Nina said between breaths. “Just go.”

Emery didn’t look back again.

By the tenth floor, her knees buckled slightly, her chest rising and falling **fast**. She pushed the door open and stepped into the hallway. Two men in black stood outside Samuel’s office\*\*.\*\* She recognized them–his personal security. Familiar faces. Faces that used to nod at her when she brought coffee when she left in the mornings when **she** stayed over,

She marched straight toward the door, heels still in hand.

“You can’t go in,” **one** of them said, stepping forward. “You’re not allowed on this floor without clearance.”

“Does he know I’m out here\*\*?\*\*” she asked.

“We’re following instructions,” the other guard said. “Please **step away**.”

“I’m not leaving,” Emery said. “Tell him I’m out here\*\*!\*\*”

Just as she expected\*\*, they\*\* didn’t move.

**“Samuel!”** she shouted\*\*,\*\* her voice echoing down the hallway\*\*. “**Samuel**, open\*\* the damn door\*\*!”\*\*

Samuel looked straight ahead. “That’s a very personal matter. I hope you can respect our privacy.”

He had barely finished speaking when another PR handler beside him handed out printed invitations. “The ceremony will be held this Saturday at the Azure Grand Hotel. A formal press conference will follow.”

That set the crowd off. More fans rushed forward, shouting Talia’s name. Phones were lifted, flashes blinding. Several people shoved against each other, trying to get closer. It was almost impossible to move.“¶”

Emery held on to Nina tightly as they were pushed backward. One of the cameras hit her shoulder, hard enough to sting. Yet she ignored it as she looked at Samuel again.

H

He didn’t even glance in her direction. However, this was not enough to stop her. She marched inside the building, fuming followed behind Samuel.

“What the hell are you doing?**”** Nina asked, pulling her back.

**as** she

“Did you hear that?” Emery asked, her face paling. At first, she wasn’t sure if she heard it correctly, but that was clearly Samuel. She wasn’t blind or deaf. That was him! “He’s marrying someone.”

Nina grabbed Emery’s arm. “Em, stop. Don’t do this. Not here.”

Emery yanked her arm free. “He’s marrying someone**,”** she said. “Someone that’s not me!”

She moved fast, weaving through the lobby and heading straight for the elevators. Samuel had just stepped inside with Talia and his secretary. Seeing this, Emery quickened her pace, but one of the guards blocked her path.

“Mr. Dwight asked not to be disturbed,” the guard said. “He wants to be alone with Miss Arden.”

Emery didn’t stop. “Do you know who I am?” she snapped, her voice loud enough for some people to notice.

That got Samuel’s attention. He looked at her–just for a moment. His eyes lingered, filled with something unreadable. But he said nothing, letting the elevator doors close.

“Oh, hell no.” Emery didn’t wait. She turned sharply and bolted toward the stairwell. She could hear Nina shout her name behind her, but Emery didn’t slow down.

“Emery! Emery, stop!”

Emery didn’t slow down. She yanked off her heels and clutched them in one hand, feet pounding up the stairs. Her breath came hard and fast. Her legs burned her chest squeezed tight–but hey, all that cardio was finally paying off.

“Wait–just wait!” Nina called again, struggling behind her. Emery glanced back once to see Nina leaning against the railing on the sixth floor, gasping for air.

“Go,” Nina said between breaths. “Just go.”

Emery didn’t look back again.

By the tenth floor, her knees buckled slightly, her chest rising and falling **fast**. She pushed the door open and stepped into the hallway. Two men in black stood outside Samuel’s office**.** She recognized them–his personal security. Familiar faces. Faces that used to nod at her when she brought coffee when she left in the mornings when **she** stayed over,

She marched straight toward the door, heels still in hand.

“You can’t go in,” **one** of them said, stepping forward. “You’re not allowed on this floor without clearance.”

“Does he know I’m out here**?**” she asked.

“We’re following instructions,” the other guard said. “Please **step away**.”

“I’m not leaving,” Emery said. “Tell him I’m out here**!**”

Just as she expected**, they** didn’t move.

**“**Samuel!**”** she shouted**,** her voice echoing down the hallway**. “**Samuel**, open** the damn door**!”**

Chapter 1

The two guards stepped in immediately. One of them reached for her arm.

“I said don’t touch me!” Emery snapped, backing away from the guards.

Before either of them could respond, the office door swung open.

Emery turned toward it, expecting Samuel.

Instead, Vanessa Dwight–Samuel’s mother**–**stepped out.

Emery barely had time to register the older woman’s expression before a hand shot out and struck her across the face.

The slap was sharp and fast, her cheek instantly stinging as her head jerked to the side. She stumbled back, heels slipping from her grip and hitting the floor with a dull thud. Her hand flew up to her cheek, but she didn’t speak. Not yet.

“Hold her down!” Vanessa barked.

Emery’s heart pounded as the guards hesitated. She couldn’t move, couldn’t speak–not from fear, but from the pure shock of it.

Then she heard him.

Mom, what are you doing!?” Samuel’s voice cut through the noise**.** 

Emery’s eyes snapped toward him**,** but her **face** burned too much to form a reply.

Vanessa didn’t pause. “I don’t understand why you would actually think my son would marry someone like you. You I said hold her down! Today, I will teach this woman a lesson she will never forget!”

I’ve been in Pune for about a year now, and while I’ve tried joining a few Redditor meetups, I often found myself either mismatched with the vibe or surrounded by people in very different life stages. So I figured—why not host something that feels more aligned?

This meetup is for people aged **27–32**, preferably **unmarried**, who find themselves with fewer friends around because most of them are now married or busy with different priorities. If you're someone who misses meaningful hangouts, this might be for you.

**Who this is for:**

* Age group: **27–32**
* Preferably **unmarried**
* Looking to build **genuine friendships** with people who enjoy thoughtful conversations and shared experiences
* People who have experienced ups and downs of live and find themselves isolated in meetups where the most everyone is trying to be loudest or funniest

**A bit about me:**

* 28M, working as a **Strategy Consultant and a small side hustle in Wealth Management**
* Ambivert—love deep conversations 
* Into **bike rides**, **car road trips**, **short treks, movies, songs, anime, gaming, board games, card games,** 
* Enjoy chatting about anything from **photosynthesis to economics to nutrition**
* Not the “joke about everything” type—more into meaningful exchanges

**What I’m hoping for:** A small group of like-minded folks who’d be up for:

* Weekend drives or treks 🌄
* Coffee meetups with long conversations ☕
* Maybe even planning a short trip together 🚗

**When and Where:** 

* Depends on the location and preference of the responders

Well, hold onto your coffee cups, folks, because it’s time to get familiar with AI tools that can help you cash in on your passions, no matter how small they seem! 💸

So, let’s get down to the nitty-gritty. Here’s your go-to guide for making bank as a beginner creator using AI tools. *Seriously, before it’s too late!*

**Why even bother?**

Let’s face it: conventional jobs are not getting any more exciting. With AI on the rise, now’s the moment to jump into creating something that doesn't just make you money, but actually makes you happy. Imagine waking up each day excited rather than dreading that morning commute! 🚗💨

**Here’s a quick roadmap to help you get started:**

1. **Choose Your Passion**: What lights you up? Writing, designing, video making? The beauty of AI is that it can enhance nearly any creative endeavor. *Don’t overthink it!* Pick something you enjoy, and let AI be your sidekick!

2. **Explore AI Tools**: Too many options? Here are a few to get the ball rolling:
   - **ChatGPT**: Great for brainstorming ideas, generating content, or even drafting emails like a pro.
   - **Canva**: Design eye-catching graphics without needing a degree in art—seriously, if I can do it, anyone can!
   - **Lumen5**: Transform your blog posts into engaging videos—perfect for visual platforms!

3. **Set Your Goals**: Instead of saying, “I want to make money,” try “I want to earn $500 this month.” It’s about keeping things realistic and measurable. Even small wins will motivate you to keep hustling! ✨

4. **Create Consistently**: Make it a habit! Start with a simple schedule: dedicate an hour a day to your creative quest. It doesn’t have to be perfect right away—just start! Think of this as a muscle you're training.

5. **Get Social**: Join groups on platforms like Discord or Reddit (hey, you’re already here!) where you can share ideas, ask for feedback, or just find someone who gets your struggles. Remember, your network is your net worth! 🤝

6. **Monetize Smartly**: Once you’ve got some content or products in the pipeline, think of how to monetize them—think affiliate marketing, sponsored content, or even selling your own products. Get creative! 💡

**But wait—What's the catch?** I mean, we've all heard “get-rich-quick” schemes that sound way too good to be true, right? Remember, while AI tools can give you a boost, it’s not about instant income; it’s about combining your passion with around-the-clock hustle. 

And hey, it’s perfectly normal to feel a little overwhelmed. There are tons of paths you can take! The trick is to *stay adaptable* and keep experimenting until something clicks. What works for one person might not work for you, and that’s totally okay! 

So, what’s your passion project going to be? And are there any tools you're excited to try out? Let’s swap ideas and keep the energy flowing! 🚀",1,1757318023.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

**Disclaimer**: This is my experience. I am in no way a qualified psychiatrist or doctor, and the questionable tactics I used during the flights of MIXING clonazepam 0.25mg (or sometimes 3 of those over the course of a 12 hour journey) with 1-2 beers should be avoided. It has a direct drug interaction, which I was aware of at the time of doing it. My old psychiatrist and the current one were also both aware that I might try to do this, and obviously they did not encourage it, but understood. At higher doses, this drug interaction could slow down your heart so much that it just stops. I believe this is partly how the singer Chris Cornell died. 



\------------ **TW FOR THIS PART** \-------------



**A Bit Of Mental Health History:** I'm 25, M. I've always had anxiety & depressive issues, and since at least 2019- ""psychosomatic issues"" (pain, hypnic jerks of sorts, etc). 

Essentially a troubled nutcase, but one which everyone (including myself, shrinks, parents etc) knew wasn't hopeless (although it obviously felt so a couple times, and all my issues still feel severe, damaging & haunting). 

Since this post isn't  about all this, I will restrict myself to just the fear of flying I developed after having the MOST SEVERE panic attack of my life on board a 3 hour flight in Sep 2022, and how I overcame it. 

But I calculated later that I had done some 15-20 flights in my life already by this point! I was always nervous as a flier, but the following panic attack cemented my absolute hatred for this mode of transport.

**The Panic Attack in 2022**: I was in fact *returning home* on a night plane, from a place which was, as they say, a severe trigger of past trauma for me (essentially severe bullying in college). 

The key puzzle for me was why the panic happened when in fact I was returning home- a place of some amount of safety (parents' divorced shook me, but nevertheless, home). After a long time, with the help of a therapist, discussions with almost everyone & introspection, I believe that the simple answer of ""I got into a plane already disturbed"" is right somewhat (This is not at all to say that if you are disturbed ***about flying***, you must give up-- please read on).

Essentially, shortly after takeoff, some anxiety came because it felt like the plane was tilted almost at a 45-60 degrees. The panic spiked sharply and became a full fledged **panic attack** because even after half an hour, it felt like the plane was at a very steep, ascent angle and I started to feel dizzy & nauseous. That was the trigger and the anxiety became a proper panic attack, and at that time, there was no stopping it. 

I told the flight attendants this, and asked if the ascent had stopped. They said yes but not in a convincing way- they asked me to sit down and said they'll get me some water. But since it felt like they were unsure themselves, the already exponential panic exploded at a greater rate and I felt a ringing sound in my ear, felt dizzy & crouched down on the aisle. I was already shaking & trembling by this point, which further contributed to a sense of loss of control (even over body. let alone aircraft and systems). 

The flight attendants obviously rushed to help me to my seat, and I both felt embarrassed and extremely scared at what was happening at the same time. 

It felt like there was some small inner part of me observing all this real time--- in hindsight that itself was probably an indication that this was more a panic attack than anything physiological or plane related. But now my hands & feet (only these) started numbing/pins-&-needles thing, my heart ached a lot & it was racing so fast,  and I was genuinely wondering if this was a heart attack or a stroke. My eyes started blurring too, giving me further ""indication"" that this indeed was something physiological. I saw black spots and my vision was actually blurring!!! If that has happened to you for any reason, you would know how absolutely terrifying it is. 

I was obviously coming to terms with all these symptoms and the sheer unexpected suddenness & the ferocity of the symptoms made my mind go blank. I. COULD. NOT. THINK. 

Since I had exhibited worrying signs of fainting (crouching down, but obviously no one wants to risk such an assumption), the attendants had made the pilot ask for a doctor on board. A 55 year old gentleman said he was and was made to sit beside me. 

He checked my pulse, spoke to me and I told him what I thought he needed to know- that I was on medication for psychosomatic symptoms, anxiety and depression, and that this could be psychosomatic but that this severity and range of symptoms I had never experienced EVER simultaneously. Again, as I type this, it feels like this itself was a clue. Here is a 22 year old boy talking straight enough, with a LOT of severe but slightly uncorrelated symptoms, and who has a history of psychosomatic issues. Also, he revealed to me that he was a psychiatrist at a leading mental health institute, and EVEN IN THAT STATE, I WAS AMUSED AND MADE A JOKE ABOUT THIS. 

By this time though, it was clear to me that since I was indeed able to think again, the fact that I hadn't died/fainted yet and that apparently my pulse was OK, that this was a panic attack of sorts (or a psychosomatic episode or whatever you want to call it). **But again, by this time the rocket ship of panic had taken off too far, and the physical symptoms DID NOT SUBSIDE**. 

The rest of the journey was spent with the doctor holding my hand and asking me to focus on my breathing, and helping me just SURVIVE the symptoms:-  of blurry eyes (almost complete loss of vision), pins & needles on all extremities, THAT HORRIBLE FEELING OF PANIC PANGS CONTINUING UNABATED, sinking feeling in my chest, heart-pain, difficulty breathing, tremors, dizziness & nausea. It was genuinely the worst experience of my life. 

Once we landed though, the hostesses asked ordered for a wheelchair, but I said I would try to stand and get out. I was able to. Vision had returned. The cabin lights also were now fully on so that helped. I was trembling and felt like I was an obese man who had run a marathon. I was so exhausted, from the bottom of my stomach and heart, to the depths of my bones. But I walked onto the tarmac, and felt.....better. I could stand. I was home. I was still alive. I could meet my cats at home. I might be out of commission for a while but I could recuperate. 

On the way out of the plane, a young man, probably around 25 got out of the cockpit and was asking the attendants who the passenger was, what had happened, etc. He was a little speechless when they said it was me. I smiled in embarrassment, but was mainly so tired and happy to be on the ground that I just got out of the plane. 

I knew that I would never get on a plane again in my life.

The doctor & I shared a coffee, and he asked me if he should drop me home. I said I thought I could go home myself but that I was very exhausted. I was still worried if I needed immediate medical attention so I asked him what he thought this whole thing was & whether I needed a cardiac checkup etc. He said based on what he saw, he thought it was a panic attack, that I could go home and check with doctors tomorrow. 

We shared numbers and I lamented that he would now recall me as a patient in an aircraft. He then saved my number as ""XYZ friend"" and said that that is not how he would remember me. This whole part felt very cringe, over-dramatic and just overdone. Nevertheless a sweet gesture, and I just left for home, told my dad what happened, and slept.

**3 Years Passed, & I knew I needed to try in more ways than one:**

I hadn't travelled by plane for a good 2.7 years now. In the interim, I continued having issues existing - basic eating, pooping, sleeping, working were all hampered by issues. Psychosomatic issues, depression, anxiety. It got worse, it got better. Meds remained the same. I dated for a year and broke up due to a very personal, change-able fault of mine. 

Tried getting better, but at a snail's pace. Went from drinking from 4 times a week to 3. My gut health went for a toss nevertheless, and on an ultrasound, showed mild fatty pancreas. Was told to stop drinking completely. It didn't help alcohol's case that I felt I was wasting my life, and that my hangovers were getting worse (with migraines, chills the next day, tremors, and all sorts of weird things). Probably due to the alcohol? No answers were given point blank by the doctors, but I knew at the bottom of my heart that I had to reduce drinking first, and then start some small form of an active lifestyle. I knew all along, of course, that an active lifestyle was necessary but this scarce resource called ""willpower to do basic shit"" had slowly collected over 3 years and made me do things. 

I also did foolish things like stopping my meds abruptly as well. 

Stopped my Sertraline (but continued Amitriptyline) around 5 months after reading semi-anti-psychiatry books like ""Anatomy of an Epidemic"". Got rid of a ""fried, pulling"" feeling I had started developing, and still had no daily anxiety. But mood was back to depressive, and the random psychosomatic symptoms continued. But again, in a way, I had gotten used to them, and no longer feared them. I felt that since I was cursed to be with them anyway, might as well at least try to get better. 





\------------ **TW PART ENDS, GOOD PART FOR FLYING BEGINS** \-------------



I decided to get my shit together. Tried to get back into shape and run. Helped that I found friends through board games (of all things), nudging and not pushing me to do so. Did so a little, intermittently. Went from 300 steps a day to 2000, not much and not even visible to my father (who keeps saying I need to take care of my health, not drink, etc), but an achievement for me. 

Restarted therapy. Some effort into facing and understanding my symptoms was started, even if as crudely as possible. The shrink had also added Desvenlafaxine along with my Amitriptyline.

I was 25. It felt like I had wasted the last 10 years of my life being a slave to depression, and that I was getting too old. Too less time. Might not have enjoyed life, but hadn't even ""lived"" it - for example by travelling. I agree & knew even then that this was a very superficial way to think, but I still felt that way. And so I set my end sights on travelling to Europe, which has been glamourised in both mainstream & social media in around 6 months. This form of goal setting for me was a sign that mentally, I was getting better. It wasn't exactly new, but I was getting more functional & driven. 

But before I did this, I wanted to take shorter flights within my country. I ended up doing a first flight of 40 minutes. Then did two flights of 1.1 hour each. Again, my mindset was that since I had survived a 2.5 hour panic attack, that physically all was OK, & that I had begun to show normalcy and mental agility, I could give it a shot. How long would I be caged in my region because I was scared to fly? I took the opinions of my present psychiatrist, my previous psychiatrist, my therapist and my GP. All of them said I could, and in fact should, go ahead. 

**First Flight:**

The first flight was a short flight of around 40 minutes. I didn't think about it at all that day- I guess that was one way of coping, and in hindsight (one of many) good ways of coping. I played board games with some acquaintances during the day, and spoke to my mon & dad separately, spoke to my situation-ship (who was also very supportive) and just.....headed for the airport.

It helped that this was an airport which I had never been to before. I took a clonazepam 0.25mg on the metro to the airport (some 2.5 hours before takeoff), and it's effect was very mildly felt. My hands were cold and I was quivering as I went through the security checks and tried to convince myself that this was something as normal as going to the bus station. I assumed I was normal and tried to feel the way a person like that would feel. 

After checking in my luggage, I was again very close to quitting. I wondered how I would be let in at my home airport for luggage claims the next day. My backup plan was to simply take a 6 hour bus to my home destination. I found a pub inside and rushed in to have around 750ml of 5% beer, by which time the boarding announcement was made. 

The beer and clonazepam had begun to affect me, and the buzz was greater than the fear. I decided to ""give in"" and enjoy the buzz and what I thought were the last couple minutes of calm before the bloody plane lifted off. I. ABSOLUTELY. HATED. TAKEOFFS. That's the one part of the journey where I had any real control-- control to not board the plane. I had mentally pictured how the takeoff would feel many times the previous week. I was buzzed, and I just saw the normal faces, reactions & body mannerisms of all the people on board. 

I had read that it was best to let the flight attendants know that I was a fearful flier, and so I did tell two of them. They disseminate information between themselves but I didn't want to take any chances. 

The good part of the buzz is the 5-10 minute wait after the plane taxies onto the main runway passes fast. That I believe would've been the main stressor pre-takeoff. So the plane, an Airbus A321neo, accelarated, took flight, and I just gritted my teeth, tightly closed my eyes, held onto the seat handles and waited. After the first 5-15 minutes, planes are almost never accelerating upward, so I knew that if I felt dizzy, or that the plane was tilted upward at some 45 degree angle, that it was a product of the mind. 

I had a bunch of distractions with me- a book on finance (my favourite subject & my job lol), two earphones (one as backup lol)- one which was noise cancelling and playing rock music (my favourite songs) and finally, for times where I felt the plane turned and I felt G forces again, conversations with the co-passenger and the air hostesses.

The co-passenger turned out to be my age, so it was embarrassing a bit, but also reassuring that I was seated next to someone who will easily understand my lingo. I told him I was a fearful flier and that I was talking to him because it helps this anxiety. He understood and said it was no issue, so we spoke about our jobs, etc etc. At two points, I reverted back into my music and close-eyes-grit-teeth way of coping G forces suddenly. It barely lasted 20 seconds, and I apologised immediately to him. He seemed amused, curious and understanding at what I was facing so he didn't mind.  

I took the 40 minute flight because even assuming the panic had started at ascent and continued all the way till landing, it would still be some 30-40% of the time I had my worst ever panic attack (which I had survived BTW). So that was a worst case reassurance. 

The flight attendant asked me if I was feeling ok some 2-3 times during the journey, which was a welcome interruption, and offered me water as well. That helped in addition to the music, book, co-passsenger trio of distractions. 

The thing about 40 minute flights is that it doesn't IRL last for more than 30-ish minutes, so by the time I felt ""Hey, it's going OK this time"", the landing in 10 minutes announcement came. I was so relived at that announcement. 

I've read that many people find landing scary which never made sense to me emotionally. For me, I simply didn't mind the sensations of descent suddenly simply because I knew I would be on ground in a bit! This was so strong even though I knew landing is one of the more risky parts of a flying journey. I even (part-jokingly) felt that even if we crashed during landing it would be fine as we would be on the ground. This highlighted to myself how absurd my thoughts & feelings about flying were, and how it genuinely was a phobia with not much going for it in the way of logical argument. 

I didn't like the G force sensations yes. That was a major part of my fear, along with my panic spiralling out of control. But then during descent, when there are some G forces as well, I didn't mind them as much since we were landing. The very fact that we were landing gave me comfort. Again, I noticed this and kept a note of it to myself.

1nbhkf1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TechGadgetsAndGear/comments/1nbhkf1/hackers_can_steal_your_credit_card_in_seconds/,Hackers can steal your credit card in seconds - here’s how Wallet Defender stops them,"We hear a lot about online scams and phishing, but there’s another threat that doesn’t get enough attention: **RFID skimming**. This is when someone uses a handheld scanner to steal your credit card or ID info without ever touching you. It sounds like a sci-fi plot, but it’s happening in coffee shops, airports, and train stations every single day. Studies even show that a majority of RFID-enabled cards can be skimmed in seconds.

**What is Wallet Defender?**  
Wallet Defender is a slim RFID blocking card that looks like a normal credit card but creates a shield around everything in your wallet. You slide it in once and it passively blocks signals from scanners trying to read your information. Unlike some high-tech gadgets, it doesn’t need charging or syncing. It just works quietly in the background, protecting you every day.

**Why people are worried about RFID skimming**  
Modern credit cards, driver’s licenses, passports, hotel keys, and even work badges often have RFID chips. These are great for convenience but they also broadcast data. With cheap scanning tools, someone can steal your card numbers or ID details without you noticing. Victims often don’t realize anything is wrong until they see charges on their account. This makes physical card protection just as important as having strong online security.

**How Wallet Defender stands out**  
Most RFID wallets and sleeves block signals but they can be bulky or inconvenient. Wallet Defender is the size and thickness of a single credit card and can protect every card in your wallet at once. It’s water-resistant, crush-proof, and designed to last for years. It’s not a tech-heavy gadget, which is why a lot of people like it. You don’t have to install apps, worry about batteries, or replace it often.

**Who might need this type of protection**  
If you travel frequently or spend a lot of time in crowded places, RFID protection is worth considering. Even if you have a secure bag or a wallet with RFID shielding, adding an extra layer can provide more peace of mind. Travelers often carry passports and multiple credit cards, and digital pickpocketing is easier than traditional theft because it’s silent.

**Reviews and real-world feedback**  
A lot of Wallet Defender reviews mention its simplicity and long-term durability. Some people highlight that it’s a small investment compared to dealing with the aftermath of identity theft. While no solution is completely foolproof, this card is an easy way to reduce risk without changing your daily routine.

**Why this kind of security is gaining popularity**  
Identity theft cases are on the rise and not all of them happen online. RFID skimming is low effort for criminals and can go undetected for weeks. With more people using tap-to-pay cards, security solutions like RFID blocking cards are becoming part of everyday carry items.

My meds greatly reduce my anxiety and enable me to be in public, park my car,  order a coffee,  etc. Now that I know the difference I feel like I can't l live without it. 
But with the anxiety reduction comes my loss of my over planning and  over checking of things. 
I'm much more likely to lose my wallet or phone now. Or forget an appointment or something important. It's like a black hole has opened up. 

I think previously my hyper anxiety balanced my unknown adhd so I never knew.  But know that my anxiety is manageable, my adhd is unchecked.  
Ultimately,  not having the anxiety is the better option but I always prided myself on my organization,  memory,  and planning ahead.  So it's a self worth reckoning to deal with.  But oddly I'm not super anxious about my self view changing.  It's just difficult.  And now I need an alternative set of skills. 

I already use cues for taking my meds. I have a habit of pocket checking. I make calendar alerts to remind me things. (Though usually cryptic)
What else can I add? 
Any tips?

Directed by: Michael Todd Schneider  
TSZDT: 5,269



104 minutes. Experimental nightmare fuel that feels like I got abducted and hooked on a drip of chaotic and dark images and they didn’t realize they kept the editing speed a few clicks too fast. 



To say this movie has a little bit of necrophilia, practical gore, rotting flesh, rape, murder, suicide, reality-bending context switching, and is the work of someone dangerously close to the edge of sanity is still not totally doing it justice. *My Crepitus* is one of these singular experiences in film that people often talk about. I watched the director’s cut which means it’s 104 minutes of spliced together footage that only loosely makes sense together. It is six or seven different threads built around the macabre and grotesque, and I kept waiting to hate it. But that never happened. 



Much like *Cornshukker, Lost Prophet, No Resistance,* or the films of Richard Baylor, some directors seem to have the ability to use SOV in ways that make it feel different. Certain creative forces can hold and build a vision and use the limitations of video to create atmosphere in a way that really sticks out and demands to be seen.



Any perception you may have about what SOV is or isn’t, I promise *My Crepitus* will force a new mental model. It is an onslaught of macabre and dark and sometimes taboo images. There is a commentary on here that I really hope to get to, mostly because I cannot wait to hear from Schneider himself and just try to make sense of this. It’s a mess, but a crazy dark mess that I’m here for and I hope many people get to see.",2,1757317515.0,personalhistoryoffilm,0,1.0,False

1nbhivu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nbhivu,"Is Weyler Just a Fever Dream, or Is There Actually a Thing Here?","***Case File: Weyler***

I usually spend my nights dissecting another fandom’s murderous lovebirds at the FBI. But this thread is so passionate — I had to wander over from the forensics department to examine this evidence.

I’ve certainly got a soft spot for pairs who treat murder like a Friday night out.

**For the anti-shippers:**  
Let people have their fun. Shippers will find evidence anywhere. If Wednesday sharpened a quill, someone would swear it spelled Tyler’s name. If Tyler stirred his coffee counter-clockwise, someone out there saw a proposal. That’s the joy. You don’t have to board the Weyler ship, but you don’t need to set it on fire either. Nevermore has support groups for disembodied appendages — there’s room for everyone.

**Is Weyler a thing?**  
Yes. Consider this your autopsy report — Weyler is alive. Doesn’t mean it survives.

**On Tyler’s monstrosity:**  
Yes, he kills — he has a rather impressive starter Hyde career. He admitted he liked it. But Hydes are compelled to obey their masters. His autonomy is hazy, like smoke trapped in a crypt — shifting, choking, hard to see through. Was it all Laurel’s control? Or was any of it his own indulgence? Hard to say.

Hear this: the only authentic glimpses of Tyler we’ve ever seen were with Wednesday — because they actually spent time together. Conversations, dates, stolen moments of “supposed” intimacy. Some of it was real. That gave her insider evidence. No one else can claim to know Tyler in any true way.

**The Willow Hill Heartbreak:**  
When Weds visits him, Tyler launches into: “I knew you’d come,” “you love my monster,” “we could rule the world.” Shackled, chained, wrecked — and still pitching a couples’ apocalypse tour. That’s not Laurel’s command. That’s Tyler, raw. She rejects him. Brutally. And when the doors slam, he lets out a growl that’s half heartbreak, half fury — the sound of someone splitting in two.

**The Monster Gaze:**  
He mauled Laurel. Like everyone else. But Weds? She got the pause. The stare. The Hyde gaze before he shoves her. His bulging eyes locked onto hers, and she didn’t falter. He could have shredded her like the rest, but he didn’t. It’s telling.

**The Weems Oracle:**  
Weems throws out daggers: she tells Weds she is affected by her feelings for Tyler. Then she doubles down — a prophecy, love and hate are two sides of the same coin, tangled and confusing. It hits Weds like a funeral bell tolling — a gut-stab realization she’d never considered. You watch it wash over her, resonate, and once spoken — she can’t ignore it.

**Outcast Intervention:**  
Remember Dios de los Muertos? Tyler’s mid-maul with Enid, and Weds lures him back with talk of forever, as if recruiting a Hyde for a couples’ blood pact. He turns. He stares. He leans in. That’s not obedience — that’s desire. This Hyde was keen on the idea of a master with braids and swords.

**The Buried Alive Scene:**  
His face said it all: he hated watching it, but he couldn’t intervene. But here’s the kicker — Tyler knows Weds. He knows she finds being buried alive soothing, like how Enid fancies a bubble bath. He’s seen her morbid quirks, learned her idiosyncrasies. If he hadn’t sensed Agnes was there to dig her out, Tyler probably assumed Weds was meditating underground, calculating decomposition rates, rehearsing her burial pose and conserving oxygen like a bat entombed for winter. 

**The Master Question:**  
Hydes are born dormant, only unlocked by trauma, hypnosis, or chemical inducement. Once unleashed, they bond to their liberator — their new master.

Laurel had Tyler first, through chemical triggers and venomous vendettas. But Laurel was later killed by Tyler himself. And then he was dealt a nightmare hellscape: his dad was murdered by a savage swarm of devil ravens who left eyeballs as souvenirs, he was electrocuted by his sadistic unhinged zombie uncle, nearly stripped of his powers by his duplicitous dying mom — and then he spies a wild-eyed Wednesday swinging a psycho axe with glee. And yet, she spared him. *Maybe that kind of carnival of torment rewires a Hyde.*

Which is why some whisper Weds may have become his new master — unintentionally. She separated him from Laurel, then freed him. If true, Weyler isn’t just teenage angst in black combat boots. It’s tether, it’s bond, it’s biology. Stitched together by that same magic that sealed off Thing’s severed hand. Call it a ship or call it a leash — either way, it’s a thing (punny).

**Differently coded creatures:**  
Tyler is a literal monster. Weds is a girl who stalks serial killers to pass the summer. Neither of them has the tools or practice to know what their feelings mean, let alone what to do with them. As Weds herself says: *“It’s not my fault I can’t interpret your emotional Morse code.”*

They don’t behave or perform in the rituals that we (as audience) would recognize as romantic cues. Their “love language” is a foreign dialect — more like ancient runes no one can decipher.

He’s spent his life ignored, insecure, without any sense of connection or acceptance. Until he met Weds — and now both of them are navigating emotions like it’s a minefield.

**Let’s talk about that Axe:**  
And there he is — **restrained, anguished, begging her to kill him.** For Wednesday Addams, that’s not horror. **That’s seduction.** It should have won her heart right there! When she frees him, he gasps out the shock of *“why?”* It wasn’t mercy. It was recognition. Her eyes said: *I know there’s more to you — and it unsettles me, yet intrigues me, even as I should run.* That’s a realization she’ll need time to unpack.

**The Case for Weyler:**  
Weds is a vault — deadpan, detached, emotions padlocked. Tyler is a monster who’s never known love. Both got a taste of it — the shape of something tender and terrible — and don’t know what to do with it. Their dynamic is jagged, unhealthy, magnetic. And still — the pull is there.

**Recap:**  
Weyler is a thing — messy, compulsive, unresolved. And a thing doesn’t always spell love. It could mean respect, or ruin, or a cross-country killing spree in Uncle Fester’s sidecar. But all roads lead to disaster — the kind that earns us a signature Wednesday Addams smirk.

Hello everyone, I have some exciting personal news to share! After many months of work, I've published a coloring book for all ages: ""Ethiopia in Line Art: A Fun Coloring Journey.""

This project is deeply personal to me. Earlier this year, I found myself at a crossroads after my job in Ethiopia was terminated. During that uncertain period, I was looking for a way to make sense of my experience and reconnect with the beautiful country around me.

I was born in Addis Ababa but I left when I was 10. I’ve always been amazed by Ethiopia's rich culture, but I noticed a lack of coloring books that truly celebrated its unique heritage. So, I decided to create one. This book is the result. It was a therapeutic and fun exercise that helped me move forward. Inside, you'll find illustrations of the famous coffee ceremonies, the stunning Simien Mountains, vibrant traditional dances, and festive celebrations.

My goal was to create more than just a book; it's an invitation to explore and connect with Ethiopia. It's for families, for art lovers, and for anyone curious about Ethiopia.

It would mean so much to me if you’d take a look. It's available on Amazon now, and if you enjoy it, please consider leaving a short review.

Thank you for your support!

1nbhdg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_mrc2318/comments/1nbhdg8/should_i_worry_about_my_bfs_ex/,Should I worry about my bfs ex?,"So my bf and I have been dating for almost 2 years. Idk when him and his ex exactly broke up but Ik we started dating a month or 2 ( or honestly maybe even shorter ) after they broke up. So obviously he brought her up a few times during our honeymoon stage. He got a tattoo a week before we were official (but we were talking/hanging out almost everyday) and told me it was a tattoo in a language  his friend made up. He then told me (maybe 2 months into our relationship?) it was a language his ex made up. So he has a tattoo in a language that his ex made up. That definitely made me get in my head a lot. He also just brought her up a lot in general during the early stages of our relationship and would say stuff about how he has trust issues from her or something like that? Idk that’s not really an issue anymore. He just brings her up in weird ways. We walked by the coffee shop she works at and he was like “let’s go get coffee there” when there were so many other places we could’ve gone. She kinda comes up in general sometimes, like in ways I can’t get upset at him for. But he’s still brining her up and I think that’s what kills me. Everything I just said mostly happened in the beginning of our relationship. I eventually opened up to him about how hurt I am by the tattoo, brining her up, etc. and he said he didn’t even realize he was brining her up so much and he meant nothing by it. I even asked him to block her on everything and he did without hesitation. Anyways now we’re almost at our 2 year anniversary and he still brings her up. But it’s in ways that are so general. Do you get what I’m saying? I love him so much and I know this is more of a me issue but every litte thing he mentions about her makes me spiral. Like he mentioned how she viewed his accounts ( on a different account he didn’t know she had ) and that made me get so in my head. Sometimes I want to leave him cause I can’t stand this feeling. Am I crazy or is he the one making me crazy? I check her socials constantly and I know that’s bad but I can’t stop. He’s told me how she was crazy and I’m perfect for him and he wishes he met me way sooner. And once he found out how I felt about the tattoo he literally started picking it off his skin ( he’s also gone to a few laser removal appointments but it’s still half there). I wish it was fully gone tho. He mentioned just getting it covered and I know it’s not logical for me to be upset about that but I am. And I think I am because if it’s covered it’s still there? And part of me just wishes he’d WANT to get it removed fully. But I feel like he doesn’t really care if it’s there or not. 

Now it’s like any little thing he says makes me spiral even if he’s not talking about her. 
Literally just the other day I was talking about how I want to quit my part time job and find somewhere else to work and he mentioned the place she used to work at (which btw is that same coffee shop) and I didn’t know how to take that. 

Sorry for the rant but I just need to talk about this. My main points here are he still brings her up ( at least 3 times a month ) in general ways that I can’t get mad at him for ( if that makes sense ). But I don’t bring up my ex like.. ever?? How does he bring her up so much?? Why does he bring her up so much? I sometimes wonder if I was just a rebound as well. Like I know it’s almost been 2 years and I should’ve thought about this 2 years ago but did he have enough time to heal? (Obviously the answer is no)  
I want to talk to him about this but I also don’t want him to know how fucking crazy I am. I don’t want him to know how much I think about this. This drains me. It makes me want to cry. And I know if it wasn’t her it would be someone or something else making me this insane. Idk maybe I need therapy or something. Or maybe I just need to talk to him. I don’t know what to do.

1nbh8oi,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1nbh8oi/dad_had_to_make_my_wedding_all_about_himself/,Dad had to make my wedding all about himself,"This is a long one—
Got married this past weekend and while I’m so happy to be married, I’m so upset by how my dad acted and finally told him off.

I generally haven’t liked him the majority of my life since he was a workaholic, alcoholic, abusive, and a selfish man. He’s never come to any of my achievements (graduations, concerts), nor do I remember him ever wishing me a happy birthday. 

After my grandpa, his dad, passed away a few years ago, my dad has become a more emotional person who seemed to want to improve himself. I still didn’t like him very much, but was open to see if he would change.
My husband and I paid for the wedding 100% ourselves and preferred it that way. However, to be kind, I told both parents that they could invite a couple of their friends (said 2-3 friends) if they want. My dad automatically assumed I would be fine with him inviting 6 people, none of who I knew. 
He eventually guilted me into letting him invite 5 people, since he told me he already told all of them they were invited and gave them our password protected wedding website.

Then as the wedding date got closer, he kept asking for more details so he could prepare. I was kind of confused what he meant by that but he assumed he would do a speech at our wedding. He has done one at each of my sisters’ wedding (3) and brags about how guests love him. But every speech he’s done, my family rolls their eyes because they know his true nature and he always puts on a show for other people. 

A week before the wedding, I decided to let him do a toast as long as he keeps it short and says kind things about us. He said he already decided he was doing a speech, and to not call it a toast. That should’ve been my warning to not let him talk, but I felt like I would possibly regret not letting him do a speech when he did one at every wedding.

Then the days leading up to the wedding, I sent  out a message regarding family photos before the ceremony. He responds saying his friend will take photos for our wedding and that his friend is a hobby photographer. I was genuinely confused if he was being serious, as we never asked him to do that and we already hired our own photo and video team. My sister stepped in and told him no since we already hired photographers, and I thought that would be that. Gave him the benefit of doubt that maybe he was just making a dumb joke. 

Well, wedding day finally comes around and here are the ways that he made things about himself once again.

1. His friend ends up bringing his camera and is standing up at the front of the ceremony space, close to our officiant and our other photographer, taking photos we told my dad he should not take.

2. His friend likely thought it was fine because my dad told him it was. My dad also told our photographer that the bride and groom said it was fine and we wanted his friend to take photos. Then proceeded to LIE that he didn’t tell our photographer that when we called him out about it.

3. He has an older brother who went MIA for many years but recently came back as he is sick. We extended an invite to him early on and I tasked my dad with the responsibility of confirming if he can come or not, as we needed catering numbers. He told me that he couldn’t come, and to give his two seats to my dad’s friends. I said fine, whatever. But guess who shows up on the wedding day because my dad told him to?

4. One of his other friends steps outside of the ceremony space right as it’s about to start. Like we’re all lined up, and his friend is grabbing a coffee from our coffee vendor. My dad sees absolutely no problem in this and doesn’t tell his friend to get back inside.

5. He then proceeded to give the absolute worst, selfish, irrelevant speech ever during dinner. I told him max 5 minutes and to say kind things about us. Instead, he went 10 minutes talking about how he worked most of his life, how his daughters cost so much money, his accomplishments, talked about Trump ???, talked about his gender identification beliefs ???, and also forgot what his 3 son in laws do for work (which Idk why he even brought that up) and even forgot one son in law’s name. Then talked about his own marriage how he’s been married for 40+ years and how “not sure if that’s a good thing, being married to only one person for 40 year” like who says that at a wedding?!
Each sentence, I was waiting to see how he would spin it back to us but he never did. He thanked my father in law once as courtesy, but also told the whole room about what a shame my father in law doesn’t drink alcohol but that he (my dad) will drink enough for the both of them. 
The only thing he said relating to us was welcome to the family. No congratulations, no I love you. 

This wedding and letting him be involved was my olive branch to see if he would step up to be a better father. But he failed so miserably and I am done with him. I sent him a message listing everything he selfishly did at my wedding and how unacceptable he was. He has yet to respond, and probably won’t. 
I hate that I feel guilty about this because all of my family members just tolerate and ignore his behavior, and all told me to just let it go. I feel guilty because he did work his entire life to send us through school and gift us our first cars. I feel guilty because he does a good job at making us feel bad for him and manipulating our feelings. But he stepped way out of line on what was supposed to be his daughter’s most important day and I’m done with him. ",3,1757316272.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

I started from Shivajinagar at around 5.30 am in the morning. I took breaks for fuel and photoshoot but no long break for breakfast. I reached back at 10 am. The total km on my odometer was 170 km.

  
The road was bad, the lonavala highway was less crowded but once you leave that the road condition is not good. The good part was scenery, you get good views along the way and there is a lake as well. During my 80% of the ride, mild rain was there so I missed some good shots but whenever the rain was not there the natural views of mountains were mesmerizing.

  
I didn't had any ride in last few months so decided to go on quick solo short ride, was seeing khandi point from long time on this subreddit so decided to visit that. Was expecting almost no traffic due to day after Visarjan and yes there were very less traffic.

I’m the one who broke up with him, and it’s a long story as to why. I know it sounds stupid (and *very* cliché), but—to keep it brief—he deserves better, and I need to sort myself out.

A few days before we broke up, I installed a Ring doorbell on my front porch. We broke up in his car, and he—being his sweet, gentle self—insisted that he come inside to say goodbye to my parents one last time. I obliged.

We said our final goodbye on my doorstep. He handled the breakup with the level of maturity, strength, and poise that I had come to expect from him. I was doing something so horrible, and I was ruining something so perfect. But, despite that, he did what he had always done throughout our entire relationship.

He took care of me.

He reassured me that he understands. He cried with me, then laughed with me to lighten the mood. I felt even worse after this, as his laugh quickly transformed into the most heartbreaking sob I’d ever heard. Through tears, he told me, “I love your laugh. I’m gonna miss it so much.”

We did our signature handshake. We kissed one last time. We promised that we’ll see each other again someday, even if it’s just to catch up over coffee.

As soon as we parted ways, I screen recorded the Ring doorbell footage. I tucked it away in the “hidden” section of my camera roll, alongside every other photo I have of him.

Every night, I get an insatiable urge to revisit that video. Some nights, I give in. Other nights, I distract myself. Such as by writing posts on Reddit that no one will ever read.

1nbh4sk,https://www.reddit.com/r/OwnYourTruth/comments/1nbh4sk/why_youre_addicted_to_crumbs_how_to_heal_your/,Why You're Addicted to Crumbs & How to Heal Your Heart and Body,"You know that feeling, right? That emotional dose of relief in your chest when *he* finally texts back—after hours of nothing. Or when that business idea gets a half-hearted nod, but not the full yes you’re craving. It’s like you’re hooked on scraps, those tiny glimmers of what *could* be, and you keep chasing, hoping, waiting for the whole damn thing. But here’s the real talk: those crumbs aren’t just messing with your head—they’re messing with your heart, your lungs, your whole body. And deep down, you know you deserve more.

This isn’t about shaming you for wanting what you want. It’s about seeing the cycle for what it is—an addiction to inconsistency—and learning how to break free from it. Let’s unpack why you’re stuck, how it’s hurting you, and how to start healing, so you can claim the whole damn thing in love, business, and life.

# The Crumbs Trap: Why It Feels So Damn Good (Until It Doesn’t)

Ever wonder why a single text from that emotionally unavailable guy feels like an emotional high? Or why does the potential “maybe” from another business idea get you fired up for a moment? It’s not just you being “extra.” Your brain’s wired for it.

Dr. Gabor Maté, a leading expert on trauma and addiction, says this chase often stems from old wounds—times when love or approval came in fits and starts, if at all. In his book *In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts*, Maté writes, “Addictions are attempts to soothe pain. They’re not about the substance or behaviour; they’re about the hurt underneath.” If you grew up with inconsistent attention—or even if you didn’t, but past relationships taught you to settle—your brain gets hooked on the high of chasing what’s just out of reach. That text, that deal, that *hope*? It’s a dopamine hit, and it keeps you coming back, even when it stings.

But those crumbs? They’re not feeding you. They’re keeping you hungry, stuck in a loop of wanting more. And that hunger doesn’t just live in your head—it’s physical, and it’s taking a toll.

# How Crumbs Hurt Your Heart, Lungs, and Immune System

Notice how your chest tightens when you’re waiting for that text that never comes consistently? Or how you’re suddenly coughing or exhausted after another let-down? That’s not you being “dramatic.” Your body’s keeping score.

Bessel van der Kolk, in his groundbreaking book *The Body Keeps the Score*, explains that emotional stress—like chasing unavailable people or goals—lives in your body. “Trauma and stress dysregulate the nervous system,” he writes, “which can manifest as physical symptoms, from chronic pain to weakened immunity.” When you’re stuck chasing crumbs, your body stays in fight-or-flight mode. Cortisol spikes, your heart races, your lungs feel like they’re only half-working. Over time, that chronic stress taxes your immune system, making you more prone to colds, fatigue, or even bigger health issues.

Think about it: every time you hold your breath for that next breadcrumb—whether it’s a text or a business win—your body’s holding the stress too. Your lungs don’t expand fully, your heart’s working overtime, and your immune system’s begging for a break. The chase isn’t just breaking your heart; it’s breaking your body.

# The Addiction to “What Could Be”

Here’s where it gets raw. It’s not just the guy or the business deal you’re chasing—it’s the fantasy of what *could* be. The fantasy where he shows up fully, loves you like you deserve, or your launch goes viral and changes everything. You’re addicted to the hope, not the reality. And that hope? It’s a liar. It keeps you stuck. Whispering “just one more try” will get you the whole damn thing.

Maté calls this the “void” we’re trying to fill—an emptiness from not feeling worthy enough as you are. You chase the unavailable because, deep down, you’re scared the full thing isn’t for you. So you settle for scraps, because scraps feel familiar. Safe, even. But safe doesn’t mean healthy.

When you chase crumbs, you’re not honouring your heart. You’re teaching it to settle, to survive on less than it deserves. And your body knows—those tight lungs, that racing pulse, that bone-deep exhaustion? They’re your heart’s SOS, begging you to stop running after what doesn’t show up consistently and available the way you deserve.

# Breaking the Cycle: How to Stop Chasing and Start Healing

So how do you quit the crumbs? It’s not about willpower—it’s about awakening and choosing your pain. Either way, it's going to hurt - it's going to keep hurting chasing breadcrumbs, and it hurts detaching from the crumbs. You need a reset. It's finally seeing clear enough that you deserve better than this. Here’s how to start, step by messy step, like you’re talking to your best friend who gets it.

# 1. Name the Pattern

Next time you’re waiting for that text or that email, pause. Say it out loud: “This is the crumbs talking.” Naming it pulls you out of the trance and seeing it for what it is. Maté says awareness is the first step to breaking any addiction—you can’t change what you don’t see. So see it. Call it what it is. You’re not chasing love or success—you’re chasing crumbs masked as potential.

# 2. Breathe Back into Your Heart

Your lungs are your superpower here. When you’re caught in the chase, your breath gets shallow, like you’re bracing for disappointment. Try this: close your eyes, put a hand on your chest, and breathe deep for a minute. Feel your lungs expand. Van der Kolk says slow, intentional breathing calms the nervous system, helping your body unlearn the stress response. It’s like telling your heart, “Hey, we’re good. No more chasing.” Over time, those deep breaths can help your lungs—and your immune system—heal from the toll of the chase.

# 3. Give Yourself the Whole Damn Thing

You don’t need him—or that deal—to feel full. Start small: buy yourself that coffee you love, take that course you’ve been eyeing, pitch that business idea without waiting for a green light. Every time you choose *you*, you’re teaching your brain that *you* are the feast, not the crumbs. Maté calls this “self-compassion”—not some woo-woo fluff, but a radical act of rewiring your worth. In love, it means walking away from anyone who can’t show up fully. In business, it means launching with your whole heart, not half-assing it out of fear.

# 4. Reframe Consistency as Sexy

Here’s a truth bomb: consistent people or opportunities might feel boring at first. Why? Because your brain’s used to the rollercoaster of crumbs. But consistency isn’t dull—it’s safe, and safe lets you grow. Start noticing the reliable stuff: the friend who always texts back, the client who pays on time, the sunrise that shows up every damn day. Let those retrain your brain to crave steady over shaky.

# 5. Honour Your Body’s Wisdom

Your body’s been trying to tell you something. Those tight lungs, that racing heart—they’re not random. They are signs you’re not honouring your worth. Next time you feel that physical pull, listen. Maybe it’s a walk, a nap, or just saying “no” to someone who’s stringing you along. Van der Kolk emphasizes that healing trauma—and addiction—starts with listening to your body’s signals. When you do, your heart starts to trust you, your lungs open up, and your immune system gets a chance to recover.

# Reclaiming the Whole Damn Thing

You deserve the whole damn thing—not just in love, but in business, in life, in every breath you take. That means no more settling for half-assed texts or maybes. No more launching your dreams with one foot out the door. You’re not here to perform for scraps—you’re here to show up fully, for yourself.

The next time you catch yourself chasing crumbs, remember: you’re not broken. You’re just wired for a pattern that’s ready to break. Every deep breath, every choice to choose *you*, every moment you say “I deserve the whole damn thing” is a step toward healing. Your heart knows it. Your lungs know it. Your body’s been waiting for you to catch up.

So go for it. Launch that project with your whole heart. Walk away from anyone who can’t match your energy. You’re not just enough—you’re everything. And the whole damn thing? It’s already yours.

1nbh4qo,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1nbh4qo/coffee_extraction_help_delonghi_la_specilaista/,Coffee extraction help! [De’longhi La Specilaista Arte],"Hi All! I have just received my De’Longhi La Specialista Arte bean to cup machine, and really just want some general help in order to get the correct weight coffee ratios to not give me a bitter taste. No predominantly I probably won’t be drinking espresso, and more than likely will be drinking a flat white, or americano but still want that nice tasting espresso which I can’t quite seem to get after having a play around with the machine over the weekend.

I’ve seen generally that I would need at 1:2 ratio, so 16g of ground coffee should provide me with 32g of coffee extracted, however I’m assuming I need to fine tune the timings of the shot pulled, as im currently pulling a 60g shot of extracted coffee. Also, the coffee pucks seem a little bit too saturated, not too much standing water, and soggy compared to what I would normally see in a coffee shop.

Are beans important as well? I’ve brought some cheap beans from a Tescos to begin with as I didn’t want to spend an outrageous amount on beans prior to getting to grips with the machine. I’m thinking of buying some coffee beans from a coffee stall where I really like the coffee! Further to this I’m also assuming that all beans will have a different grind level/ and dose level.  So I assume I’ll need to play around to get the correct weight! Any help that you guys have found with this machine would be much appreciated!

I've never posted anything on Reddit before, It's a long story and will have a lot of details, I ask that at least one person read this to help me.
‎‎I (was 17 at the start of the relationship but am currently 18, female) have been with Bruno (23, male) since February. We met one night at a party. He was turning 23 on Saturday and asked me to go to his bday party. I went, we had a great night with his friends, and we had an after-party at my place. His friends left, we hooked up, and in the end, he stayed at my house for almost a week and we've been together ever since.
‎‎However, like every relationship, he had flaws, such as:
‎· He is 23 years old and has no job, no vision for the future like college or a career.
‎· He had a very difficult childhood, has a lot of unresolved trauma, and a strong tendency to depend on addictions (he smokes cigarettes/tobacco like crazy, was clean from cocaine for 2 years when we met and has been hospitalized because of his addiction, lives on coffee...)
‎· He has suspected different diagnoses from every psychologist he's ever seen: bipolar/BPD, autism, ADHD, depression, anxiety... (none confirmed, but clear signs of one or the other. He definitely has something).
‎· He is older than me and not really my type. He has back problems that make him hunchbacked, a small p*nis, little sexual experience, impotent due to his addictions and anxiety, receding hairline, a vein on his forehead that pops out whenever he gets stressed. I'm not really into men with beards and he's obsessed with his own goatee, takes days to shower, never brushes his teeth, often has his hair full of knots (he has long, wavy/curly and bleached hair).
‎· Besides his appearance, there's his personality. Problems dealing with his own feelings, doesn't know how to handle interactions well and always says or does something cringeworthy. Because he's so traumatized, he can't even talk to my mom without thinking she has hidden intentions in these interactions. My mom offered to pay for his therapy, paid his ENEM (university entrance exam) fee, takes us on all possible trips, gives him money for the bus to come see me, when he helps around the house she sends him money, and even so he thinks she wants something from him. He always takes everything literally (which I forgive due to possible autism) and tries to turn things around against me, worries about people judging even the color of his underwear but is the first to judge everyone.
‎· We fought one day and he relapsed. He's clean again, but the relapse made me lose some of my sparkle for him.
‎· Manipulative, says what people want to hear without really believing it, lives and wallows in his own depression, does nothing to help himself even though my mom and I have offered to take him to the public health center (CAPS), pay for a psychiatrist, get him registered for government aid (cad único). He repeated the last year of high school 3 times and is finishing his equivalency exam (supletivo) this year.
‎· Very performative. Everything is super dramatic to him, and when we fight it seems like he's quoting lines from dramatic soap operas.
‎‎Despite all this, he also has many qualities. Bruno always worries about me, asking if I need help with everything. Whenever I've given him criticism, you could see a change; he makes an effort for me. He hasn't had many good relationships (was cheated on in most of them) but even so, you can see how crazy he is about me. I even worry that he might be emotionally dependent on our relationship based on how he talks.
‎‎Before being with Bruno, I was in another relationship where I was cheated on but hadn't gotten over the guy after the breakup. I spent a year without getting over my ex until Bruno came into my life. I still think about my ex sometimes but I try to cut that thought off because I know he's a jerk and already has another girlfriend.
‎‎The relationship with Bruno has been my relationship with the most fights. We used to disagree a lot but never to the point of almost breaking up. After talking, we looked for different alternatives to reduce the fights, which works most of the time.
‎‎I realize that since I was little, I've had a problem with getting irritated and embarrassed by the existence of other people. I'm trying to suppress that and be kinder. I have some difficulty with empathy, and depending on the case, I do things to make other people feel worse about themselves purely for pleasure. I have flaws and I'm trying to learn to be less like that. I know I'm spoiled, egocentric, hypocritical, and many other things just as bad as everything I said about Bruno.
‎‎Since the beginning of our relationship, there have been moments when I didn't like physical contact with him: kisses, hugs, sexual touch, nothing. However, in others, I love having him around. There are moments when I can't stand to see his face anymore, and there are days when I want to live with him and be happy together. I recently turned 18, and since then I've been questioning whether I really want this relationship.
‎‎I know I love him, and he is my best friend, but I don't know if I love him romantically, if I'm just craving attention, if I got in too deep in this relationship (7 months is a long time) and now I'm afraid of losing our mutual friends, the parties we go to together, the fun moments we have. Sometimes I feel bad for feeling this way, but I can't bring myself to feel good kissing him depending on the moment. I don't want to trap him in a relationship with someone who doesn't know what they want, but I also don't want to lose him from my life.
‎‎Today I told him all these things: that I didn't like some moments of physical contact with him, that I didn't find him that attractive, that his paranoia and persecution complex drive me crazy, everything he does has to involve me, he's 23 but doesn't know his way around the city he was born in, doesn't know how to take a bus, doesn't know how to make decisions alone and makes me choose everything for him. Sometimes I feel like a mother to him instead of a girlfriend. I told him I was afraid our future would be based on me killing myself studying and working for the things I want and supporting him, or him holding me back. I apologized for not knowing what I want and said he doesn't deserve a confused person.
‎‎One last thing I didn't tell him but sometimes feel is a longing to be single, to be with other people, to not have to be attached to someone. I know it seems pretty obvious that I should break up with him, but I genuinely feel lost because I want him in my life, but I don't know if I can handle him being so immature (my hypocrisy, i know).
‎‎When I told him all this, I asked to meet tomorrow to talk about it, and this conversation will define whether we stay together or not. What do I do? I know I'm a bitter person and he is trying, but I can't help getting stressed with him.
‎‎I don't expect anyone to actually read this much text, but I needed to get it off my chest. Thank you for listening.",0,1757315678.0,AmIOverreacting,8,0.5,False

I really like the DF64 Gen 2. I have the currently newest version with the black dosing cup and single declumper, but I can't seem to get ""good"" pourover/V60. I aligned it and the marker test seems good. I've run about 200-300g of coffee in total.

I currently run a pre-fermented India Ratnagiri and like a coffee with brighter acidity, but I'm struggling to achieve this profile even if the beans are more juicy/acidic and I usually end up with a muddy and bitter coffee. I've tried different temperatures, from boiling, 95 degrees down to 85. 90-85 gives better acidity but with very little body, while 95 and upwards gives too much bitterness. I tried to keep temperature at 95 and change grind size to keep to one variable. Size 50 has given the best body/""mid tones"" but acidity is muted and bitterness is a bit too high at 95 degrees. At 55 the acidity is still not bright enough, body is starting to vein and bitterness is still present. At size 60-65 I pretty much only get a disappointing acidity with a very watery coffee.

I use a gooseneck kettle, tried both our soft tapwater and filtered with a brita. Tried the hoffman recipie, the lance two-pour 6g/s method and even a 3 pour (50g bloom, 2x100g 6-8g/s pours). I use a single cup plastic hario V60 with the V02 hario papers. (15g coffee, 250g water)

Last night I removed the declumper, grind size 50 and temp at 95 with the three pour method. It did improve with less fines, but I'm still not quite satisfied. I know the stock burrs are meant for espresso, but I do believe that the filter should be better than what I experience (especially by reviewers who say it has nice clarity while not being perfect). I'll try slow feeding, but I really hate slow feeding..

Myself 33F, husband 33M and baby 6 months. We are first time parents, keep this in mind. 

We were looking forward to this trip and now that it's over it has felt me feeling defeated. I hoped that MIL and I could form a meaningful connection, that I could get to know her deeper as she lives overseas. I hoped for a stronger bond with her now that I'm a mother myself.

I got to know her a little bit more as I asked her about her childhood here and there when given the chance however the majority of her stay I didn't feel love nor safe around her. She had a judging aura and made constant comments about how I did things. 

She would stop me from tending to my crying baby. For example my baby cried in the car seat which she normally does, when this happens we normally pull over when safe, take her out and have a short break. (disclaimer I checked with her pediatrian and a pediatric chiro they said some babies just hate carseats). 
But one time baby cried and cried and MIL said do not take the baby out because she knows I will remove her. So then baby cried and cried and I was so upset because I couldn't tend to my baby. (BTW give me some grace I know I can just do what I want but keep in mind I'm a First time mom, I'm Post partum and I'm being told what to do and idk how to act) 
This happened again another time. My baby cried and was looking at me, I wanted to pick her up but keeping in mind what my MIL said last time I was caught I didn't know what to do. Until the cries became hysterical, my daughter was so stressed. She never cries like that. I was getting stressed. I told my husband to take the nearest exit which he didn't. When he finally stopped MIL and her husband got out of the car and walked away. My daughter had pooped herself allover her back, she was crying so much, she does this when she is stressed. I hugged her and we were crying together. He and I got into a back and forth in the car. Voices raised. We were bickering, I was crying because I wasn't used to baby being so stressed and baby was hysterical. It was just a stressful situation all around. (my husband isn't an ass ok so no comments about that it was rush hour he said he was also stressed). 
So then MIL was upset at me because she said I blamed my husband (her son) because he didn't pullover like I asked. So she ignored me for the rest of the afternoon. Even at night she ignored me didn't say goodnight and didn't make a pot of coffee or eggs in the morning like she used to (showing me attitude basically). I don't really care for this but it shows her nature. 

Now on the other hand, I'm trying to understand her in the best of my abilities. I'm trying to understand why she would do certain things and act a certain way. A lot of what people do stems from their childhood and other traumas that have shaped them. That being said, although I may understand her based on her history, it is not an excuse to inflict pain, judgement and hurtful things on to someone. I craved connection and a meaningful relationship with her but I did not get that in this trip. Instead I felt pain was inflicted on me especially I'm still postpartum - - the most vulnerable stage of my life. I was looking for understanding and love. So many other things happened! 
In the end before they left, I printed out photos and put it in a collage picture frame with a card from me to her saying I hope she sees past my imperfections and that I wish to have a meaningful bond with her. 

She lives overseas. I still crave connection but I'm deeply hurt by how she treated me. What does our future relationship look like? How do I go about this? I want to maintain peace but addressing that I don't want to be hurt nor be around that energy. Im so conflicted between standing up for myself and wanting a peaceful relationship with her. I don't want drama, nor stress, I don't want any toxic people in my life. Right now I'm feeling sad, defeated and just upset that this trip wasn't what I had hoped for.

1nbgpqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/cults/comments/1nbgpqa/breatharianism_wiley_brooks_ellen_greve_c_1980/,"Breatharianism (Wiley Brooks, Ellen Greve, c. 1980)","Breatharianism, also known as inedia, is the belief that a person can survive without consuming food or water, instead subsisting on prana or “life-force energy.” While the notion has roots in ancient spiritual traditions and appeared in a 17th century esoteric text, it is today associated primarily with the claims of two modern individuals.

Wiley Brooks, the founder of the Breatharian Institute of America, gained national attention in 1980 with an appearance on the television show “That’s Incredible!” where he claimed not to have eaten solid food for nearly 20 years. He argued that eating was a learned habit and that breathing alone could sustain life. Brooks further asserted that hunger strikers did not die from starvation but from psychological causes, and that even infants could survive without food if properly trained. In a 2013 interview, Michelle Pfeiffer said that she had been introduced to breatharianism as an aspiring actor in Los Angeles in the early 1980s by a “very controlling” couple who may have been linked to Brooks.

Brooks’s credibility suffered a major setback in 1983 when a former follower reported seeing him purchase and consume a Slurpee, Twinkies, and a hot dog at a 7-Eleven. Although Brooks denied the allegations, the incident led to public skepticism and a decline in his following. Brooks later refined his teachings, introducing concepts such as “people pollution” and “electro pollution” as obstacles to successful breatharian living. He also proposed that some fast food items, particularly McDonald’s double quarter-pounder with cheese and Diet Coke, could align with the “base frequency” of a fifth-dimensional universe.

Brooks began offering expensive workshops and spiritual retreats, targeting affluent clients with prices ranging from $100,000 to as much as $50 billion. In the final years of his life, he acknowledged that he still needed to eat and said he was focusing on understanding why this was the case. Brooks died in 2016.

Another central figure in the modern movement was Ellen Greve, who adopted the name Jasmuheen. Active from the 1990s, she promoted “pranic nourishment,” claiming that she could go for months with little or no food, subsisting primarily on a cup of tea. Jasmuheen linked her beliefs to the teachings of the mystical figure St. Germain and authored books that outlined her approach.

In 1999, she agreed to participate in a supervised test organized by the Australian television program “60 Minutes.” The experiment aimed to assess whether she could sustain herself without food or water over a week. By the third day, Jasmuheen complained that the hotel setting, located near a busy road, was too polluted to allow her to absorb nutrients from the air. The test was relocated to a rural retreat, but her physical condition continued to worsen. After several days, a doctor employed by the show recommended that the experiment be halted, reporting that Jasmuheen’s pulse rate had doubled, she was severely dehydrated, and that kidney failure was imminent. Jasmuheen disagreed with the decision but complied.

In 2000, Jasmuheen received the “Bent Spoon Award” from the rationalist group Australian Skeptics for promoting what they described as the year’s most egregious pseudoscientific claim. That same year, she was also awarded an Ig Nobel Prize for her book *Living on Light*. As of 2017, at least five deaths had been linked to individuals attempting breatharian practices allegedly influenced by her writings. Jasmuheen has denied culpability, stating that in one of the cases, the deceased’s practice was perhaps “not coming from a place of integrity and did not have the right motivation.”

Other prominent modern breatharian claimants include Prahlad Jani, an Indian sadhu who stated that he had lived without food or water for over 70 years, and Hira Ratan Manek, an Indian man who claimed to have lived primarily on water, with occasional tea, coffee, or buttermilk, since 1995. A 2011 documentary included footage of Manek eating a large meal in a restaurant.

Something about him made me think, “Maybe he’s the one… maybe it’s finally him.”

A part of me just hopes that this time, fate will be kind --- because I’ve been waiting, and I’ve been a good boy all these years. 😊

 

Despite my hectic schedule --- constantly traveling from one country to another for business trips --- I told myself, “Okay, I’ll give it a shot. I’ll make time to get to know him.”

 

We started chatting, and while he would reply, I couldn’t help but notice the long gaps… first a few minutes, then hours, sometimes even longer.

I kept pushing through, convincing myself that maybe he was just busy with work or personal things – even at night.

Even though I don’t really believe in the whole “too busy” excuse, I tried to understand.

 

My schedule finally eased up a bit, so I asked him if he wanted to meet.

I could feel from our chats that he also wanted to, maybe he was just waiting for me to take the first step.

 

I invited him to attend a mass service first, then have lunch and coffee after.

But then he surprised me --- he asked if I’d like to meet earlier and include a breakfast date too.

Of course, I said yes. I thought it was really sweet of him, and it meant we could spend the whole day together, from morning until late afternoon.

 

We finally met for breakfast --- at a place I chose.

At first, he looked pretty nervous -- you could tell from his gestures and the way his eyes moved.

I felt a little nervous too --- it’s been such a long time since I’ve actually gone out on a date.

But once we started eating, we loosened up, and things felt a lot more natural.

 

We attended the 12 PM mass.

The mass ended, and we went out in peace. Haha

 

Then we went to a restaurant for lunch and coffee --- his choice this time.

He forgot to make a reservation, so I quickly booked a table online.

We had to wait a few minutes, but it was fine --- we kept talking while we waited.

 

We kept talking over lunch and coffee, getting to know each other a bit -- about our jobs, family backgrounds, and how we spend our free time and weekends.

 

By the end, it was a really nice, relaxed date --- no pressure at all, just easy and enjoyable.

 

Around 3 PM, he mentioned he needed to leave because his friends were waiting.

He had actually mentioned meeting them in our chats before, but I thought it was around 5 or 6 PM.

 

Anyway, we left the restaurant and started walking toward the nearest train station.

Halfway there, I said I wanted to stay in the area to buy something.

Truthfully, I just wanted to give him a little alone time before meeting his friends, which is why I didn’t ride the train with him.

We said our “Nice meeting you, take care,” and then went our separate ways.

 

I took my time walking and sent him a message: “Thanks for today! I’m really happy we met. I like the vibe -- so easy and chill.”

He replied, “Me too, looking forward to the cooking show,” since I had mentioned that I enjoy cooking.

 

And after that, it fell back into the same pattern --- chatting, waiting, and wondering when, or if, he would reply.

But I kept the conversation going, starting with a simple question—asking if he had time to chat—because this was the only way for us to get to know each other.

Still, it ended up being the same waiting game.

 

I’m going to be busy at the end of this month, so I asked if he wanted to come over to my place to finally fulfill my promise of cooking for him.

He said he didn’t have any plans that weekend but would let me know if he could make it. Hehe.

 

Two days later, he messaged me saying he thought he could come over.

I replied with a simple, “See you,” to seal the plan. Haha.

 

I planned everything and cooked what I think was my best meal. When he arrived, I showed him around my place.

We had lunch and ended up talking non-stop for a full five hours.

 

During our conversation, I finally found the courage to ask about his pattern of replying to messages.

He admitted it wasn’t about being busy --- it was intentional.

He said that in the past, people he chatted with would do the same to him, so he just mirrored their behavior.

 

Hearing that honestly raised a little red flag for me.

It made me pause and think --- if this is how he treats communication, how will it play out in a relationship?

I couldn’t help but feel a mix of frustration and concern, even though I still enjoyed our time together.

 

Our meetup ended well. I walked him to the train station, we said goodbye, and he later messaged me, “Thanks a lot!”

 

 

Hey, you.

 

I know you’ve been hurt in the past --- ignored, replaced, or maybe overlooked.

But don’t let that shape how you treat people moving forward.

Don’t build walls or hold back because of what others did.

 

It’s natural to want to protect yourself, but I hope you can pause and reflect: not everyone is the same.

Let your past guide you, not limit you, and stay open to the good in others.

 

My intentions are pure, gentle, and kind. I truly like you, deeply and sincerely, from the bottom of my heart.

But please don’t make me pay for the hurt others have caused.

Or maybe I should take this as a signal that you’re not feeling the same.

Mind you, neither city is ideal for tipped workers as servers get 2.13 most of the time.

For one, it's funny being a barista/bartender in Austin because I've never been treated so well by clientele. People seem to respect drinkmakers more here. The money is better. I found coffee houses in Houston would put a cap on gratuity where you could only make 2/3$ an hour in gratuity. Over here baristas can actually survive.

Secondly, everyone is doing live music. It makes me proud to be in the scene. If you have a bar or restaurant out here and you never do shows, it's kind of shocking. Back in Houston, I rarely had jobs where I could always catch a free show (or rather get paid to work a show).

Even the coworker culture has been better out here. No weirdness from squad and we all treat each other with respect. Although that's a case by case basis.

29y o female 5’5” 150lb active in hiking/walking ways not in working out way ADHD on 30mg methylphenidate increased from 25mg two months ago. Sometimes this increase makes me physically ill. Strange heart rate has been ongoing issue in life but they’ve never cared enough to have me do further testing other than a quick in office visit where they said it was SLIGHTLY irregular and in December they want to send me home with a two week monitor.  

I suffer from binge eating and recently have “been off the wagon” sort of eating junk. Previously I’d cut ALL caffeine and “junk” and never felt better but had a hard time not binging doing this. My resting heart rate was 60 ish during this time. The last 3 weeks I’ve tried not being so strict to avoid a binge (this includes caffeine again) and felt generally worse and noticed an increase heart rate. Idk if this is related but in my head it is. 

Last Friday I got the worst pains of my life in the stomach, not a cramp but sharp pains. I was also sick this whole week from a bug my son brought home. Idk if that’s related. Lasted all day from 9am on and got the worst around 3pm to the point where I had to just lay down for a couple hours then it resolved. I thought it was gas/digestion pain. 

I’ve felt it SLIGHTLY every day since but it’s generally followed by mild gas/sort of toothpaste consistency poop and it’s gone. 

Yesterday I ate the most junk/crap I have in weeks. Like 99% candy. I had 10oz of coffee to start the day, sugary cereal, then several kinds of actual candy after a hike followed by Mexican food and MORE candy. 

By the end of the day my heart was beating fast and when I laid down for bed it was racing. Sometimes this happens and it goes away after 10 ish minutes and I fall asleep. Tonight I fell sleep while it was still racing and I woke up at 11pm (2 hours later) to my heart still racing. I put my watch on and the higher heart rate it caught during this time was 125. After waking up!! I was overheated and uncomfortable but still! Insane! 

I got up in a cold sweat and had crazy diarrhea and sat down. I’m here now, with a slightly better heart rate but it’s still 80-90 beats per minute. 

I’m theorizing four things. 1) Maybe this is the butt end of a weird sickness. 2) my body can’t handle me eating junk/caffeine anymore and too much back and forth has taken a toll 3) maybe my medication is too high and my heart is suffering for it 4) options 2 & 3 combined. 

Either way I’m trying to figure out what to do right now and tomorrow. Is my heart rate something I need to see a doctor IMMEDIATELY for, or can I wait until tomorrow? Or should I just lay off the junk, take a 20mg dose of my meds (or stop altogether) and schedule a regular appt to figure this all out. 

All of my current issues seem to be related to digestion which is a brand new problem for me that only showed up AFTER getting sick last week. 

The fear of god has been struck and I’ll be reaching out to my doctor regardless to get help in managing my binge eating and possibly seeing a nutritionist. But for right now I want to know if my situation is dire or just sleep it off type of thing. ",1,1757314001.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False

**Here u go** [**https://writers.editingapp.net/nothing-1/**](https://writers.editingapp.net/nothing-1/)

Before committing suicide while holding her daughter’s body, Beatrice Lindsey did three things. First, she sent the autopsy report of her daughter, who died from an infection after kidney donation, to Caden Baldwin. He was at a birthday party for the son of his first love at that time. 

Second, Beatrice calmly arranged all the funeral affairs for her daughter. Then, she held her daughter’s ashes and slept in the cemetery for a whole night. 

Third, Beatrice softly sang “Happy Birthday” and threw the ignited divorce agreement in her hand towards the curtain. 

At the same time, in the magnificent hall, Caden Baldwin’s phone rang. 

“Third Master, the villa is on fire.” 

The wine glass Caden was holding fell to the ground with a crash, and he turned and left. He didn’t know how he stepped on the gas pedal and rushed to the villa. 

Looking at the house engulfed in fierce flames, it felt as if something had pierced his heart. The curtain fell, revealing Beatrice Lindsey sitting in front of the birthday cake and the urn of her daughter’s ashes in her arms. 

She smiled at him as if they were meeting for the first time. 

“Goodbye. I hate you. If everything could start over…” 

In a drunken stupor, Beatrice Lindsey had a wild night with Caden Baldwin, her step–uncle. 

Then, she deliberately switched her morning–after pill with folic acid, trying to get pregnant and marry Caden. 

He ranted at her for being shameless and using dirty tricks to climb the social ladder. 

After they tied the knot, he began to retaliate against her like crazy, not even showing mercy on their daughter. 

**Here u go** [**https://writers.editingapp.net/nothing-1/**](https://writers.editingapp.net/nothing-1/)

When Beatrice opened her eyes again, she found herself reborn to the day after their one–night stand happened. 

The first thing she did was burn the 100 love letters she had written for Caden. 

Next, she told him that the woman he slept with was Madelynn Bradford, his fiancée. 

Finally, she took lots of morning–after pills, making sure she wouldn’t carry his baby. 

In the previous life, Beatrice greedily admitted that they had slept, which resulted in eight years 

11:28 

0.0% 

of loveless marriage, 

Caden had been waiting for Madelynn and hadn’t slept with any woman before that, so he hated Beatrice’s guts and mistreated her. 

Bur Beatrice just wouldn’t give up on this marriage no matter what. 

Eight years later, their daughter Stella died on the operating table, 

Meanwhile, Caden was celebrating the successful transplant of Stella’s kidney to Madelynn’s 

Son 

After Stella was cremated, Beatrice set herself on fire with Stella’s urn in her arms. 

Before she died, she finally realized that she shouldn’t hold on to what didn’t belong to her. If there could be a chance to start over again, Beatrice wouldn’t want anything to do with Caden. 

**Here u go** [**https://writers.editingapp.net/nothing-1/**](https://writers.editingapp.net/nothing-1/)

Under the scorching afternoon sun, the coffee cup fell to the ground, and the shards cut through Beatrice’s skin, making her sober right away, 

Beatrice opened her eyes, only to find herself kneeling in the center of the hall. 

She looked around with confusion, finally realizing that she had been reborn! 

Ignoring the astonished gazes of the crowd, she pinched herself in the arm. 

Pain swept through her body, and tears instantly welled up in her eyes. 

“Why are you crying? You’re the one who crossed the line!” 

A solemn voice came from the main seat. 

Beatrice snapped back to reality and met the displeased gaze of Xander Baldwin. 

She immediately lowered her head, appearing as humble as ever, but her body couldn’t stop trembling with excitement.

Before committing suicide while holding her daughter’s body, Beatrice Lindsey did three things. First, she sent the autopsy report of her daughter, who died from an infection after kidney donation, to Caden Baldwin. He was at a birthday party for the son of his first love at that time. 

Second, Beatrice calmly arranged all the funeral affairs for her daughter. Then, she held her daughter’s ashes and slept in the cemetery for a whole night. 

Third, Beatrice softly sang “Happy Birthday” and threw the ignited divorce agreement in her hand towards the curtain. 

At the same time, in the magnificent hall, Caden Baldwin’s phone rang. 

“Third Master, the villa is on fire.” 

The wine glass Caden was holding fell to the ground with a crash, and he turned and left. He didn’t know how he stepped on the gas pedal and rushed to the villa. 

Looking at the house engulfed in fierce flames, it felt as if something had pierced his heart. The curtain fell, revealing Beatrice Lindsey sitting in front of the birthday cake and the urn of her daughter’s ashes in her arms. 

She smiled at him as if they were meeting for the first time. 

“Goodbye. I hate you. If everything could start over…” 

In a drunken stupor, Beatrice Lindsey had a wild night with Caden Baldwin, her step–uncle. 

Then, she deliberately switched her morning–after pill with folic acid, trying to get pregnant and marry Caden. 

He ranted at her for being shameless and using dirty tricks to climb the social ladder. 

After they tied the knot, he began to retaliate against her like crazy, not even showing mercy on their daughter.

When Beatrice opened her eyes again, she found herself reborn to the day after their one–night stand happened. 

The first thing she did was burn the 100 love letters she had written for Caden. 

Next, she told him that the woman he slept with was Madelynn Bradford, his fiancée. 

Finally, she took lots of morning–after pills, making sure she wouldn’t carry his baby. 

In the previous life, Beatrice greedily admitted that they had slept, which resulted in eight years

of loveless marriage, 

Caden had been waiting for Madelynn and hadn’t slept with any woman before that, so he hated Beatrice’s guts and mistreated her. 

Bur Beatrice just wouldn’t give up on this marriage no matter what. 

Eight years later, their daughter Stella died on the operating table, 

Meanwhile, Caden was celebrating the successful transplant of Stella’s kidney to Madelynn’s 

Son 

After Stella was cremated, Beatrice set herself on fire with Stella’s urn in her arms. 

Before she died, she finally realized that she shouldn’t hold on to what didn’t belong to her. If there could be a chance to start over again, Beatrice wouldn’t want anything to do with Caden.

Beatrice opened her eyes, only to find herself kneeling in the center of the hall. 

She looked around with confusion, finally realizing that she had been reborn! 

Ignoring the astonished gazes of the crowd, she pinched herself in the arm. 

Pain swept through her body, and tears instantly welled up in her eyes. 

“Why are you crying? You’re the one who crossed the line!” 

A solemn voice came from the main seat. 

Beatrice snapped back to reality and met the displeased gaze of Xander Baldwin. 

She immediately lowered her head, appearing as humble as ever, but her body couldn’t stop trembling with excitement.

1nbgeeb,https://www.reddit.com/r/counttheheadlights/comments/1nbgeeb/in_the_car_to_qld_long_post/,In the Car to QLD (Long Post),"In the car to Queensland, the seat won't recline because there's so much shit crammed in the backseats. I look out the window. It is beautiful. Even with the sound of him talking in my ear in the background, I filter it out and focus on the road zooming by, the cows in the meadows, the sun soaring overhead, the dry brown of the foliage as the hot sun gives the Spring buds their first taste of an Australian Summer.

The complaints rise in my throat and choke. Over and over, sore back, sore bones, dry skin, itchy skin, too loud, too bright, awkward, painful, sore, thirsty, hungry, restless, bellyache, headache, hives. I'm allergic to you, I joke, but it's true and he doesn't laugh because he knows that I know that, and it's a knife disguised as a joke. And I feel bad and I do love him, and I lay my head on his lap and think about giving him a blowjob but then it's too obvious that I'm a sexual service and that my sorry's mean nothing, and a blowjob means something, and so my mind is futile and my body is sold, and that's not the reality I want to live in, and although it's the reality he wants to live in, he wants to pretend with his words and his mind that it isn't, because if he lets the reality of it all sink in, he will split at the seams with floods of self-hatred. So I am silent and he is silent for a moment where we share a fantasy, that things are okay and this is normal, and then I sit up because the seatbelt is digging into my side and I already have broken ribs.

Then I sink into the depression, where the sun outside creates a lovely contrast yellow with the deep, swirling blue-black inside me. I love these thoughts, I sink and swirl in the rough tumbling oceans inside me, like the Billie Eilish album cover, I am immersed. Maybe it's because it all feels inevitable anyway, maybe I like the difference between the dry lips of the land and the man beside me and the endless oceanics of my inner turmoil. He drives, gripping the wheel with both hands, holding onto his control with paced breathing and demonic calm. He has his girlfriend, all to himself, she is away from her family, she has no money, she has no autonomy, she will do whatever I say. He doesn't think like that, but he feels like that. He edits his thoughts in real-time, so he can believe himself to be good.

I just take my thoughts as they come, the swirling oceans tossing me inside, my thoughts sound like: la di da di da... it's all gonna be ok... 3 months in... he'll always be there... maybe he'll give me a black eye... I love bruises... 

I think of my dad, and I am struck with sadness and worry, he's a state away, and a lot more than that. Every day I fucked this man sliced us apart a little more. My mum, who I don't even know, who I never shared love with for long. My brother, an image, no feelings, too dark, too evil, too cold-hearted to describe. My face twitches and chabges at the thought of him, hatred, disgust. My self, as a younger girl. Depression, thrown back into the ocean.

I look at my bag, and grab it from the passenger seat floor. Strawberry backpack. I zip it open and search the contents: a black knife, food wrapper, empty pill packets, condoms, wallet, keys. I wonder how useless my keys have become, now I'm driving into Queensland for god knows how long with this man who hates my life apart from him. One day, if I stay with him, he'll make me throw them away altogether. I'll be his pet.

I find my pill packets, boue pills, white pills. Together, they make a fog for me for up to 8 hours. The sun casts into my eyes, waking me up a little. I have to give myself time to sober up properly or they don't work. But the pain of it all, physically, and especially mentally, is a lot to handle. It's not enough and it's too much. It's all wrong. I plunge back into the ocean. The pills are my only solace, I clutch them tight. 

He glances over at me, analysing. I glance back, sly and furtive. If I take them now he'll hit the fritz, why are you taking them? you're ruining your mind, your beautiful mind (you're ruining my mind) why are you here then? he will whine (i don't know what else to do I will mumble under my breath because I don't want to be anywhere else and he'll pull over on the side of the road and tell me to get out now if I argue. it's the middle of the goddamn desert. he might just pull off in a cloud of dust, and I might just walk offroad into the desert hills, and let the ants eat me flesh from bone... he will come back and not find me here, and he will have to call the police or maybe he will just not.) 

I look down at the pills in my hand which crinkle in my hand as a tear drops from my eye and rolls down my face. his gaze burns the tear up dry onto my cheek, that tear is a crime to him. i am on death row and he is busting open on top like a steaming kettle, he is waiting to kill me. but he won't take the blame. when I kill myself after 6 years of torture and a shrinking globe inside my head, when no one can save me and so they release my hand and hail Mary across their face and chest, when I finally throw myself into a river, drunk and on heroin, or leave myself a little open on the highway. It will be unexplainable, it will be self-sacrifice, or stupidity, or mental illness. It is not his fault, actually, it is no one's. 

He turns on the radio. DJs blare and blast, are they really that happy? Diggity. I hate myself. I pop the pills out of their blisters and that's too much, but he can't say anything because I waited that extra second and that show obedience, so he is silent as I take the pills that calm my mind and destroy my memory recollection for temporary and hopefully permanence. Self-inflicted lobotomy. I used to think I was just too weak.

""The game show..."" 

""...a hundred million...""

""Sounds like self-reflection...""

""...terrible things...""

""...gave it a good try...""

""...and that's all!""

Pit stop. Rest stop. Quick piss, ""you want anything?"", my lids are heavy, I can't open my eyes, the blue pills do that. He notices but doesn't care, he can fuck me awake or asleep. ""I'll come in..."" I mumble, and jack the door open, out of the car, standing, silver stars, dizziness, roar... I hit the ground and door crunches me against the rim. I'm just being dramatic, he says with these words: ""Are you okay?"" It's in the tone, I say silently, to my own observing mind in my head, as I rub the raising lump on my forehead. It has the good ache, the ache that reminds me I'm bad and deserve to be in pain, but doesn't distract me from anything. It just hums in the background like a bad frequency. 

He is chipper in the store. ""Hello there, Sir!"" He stole my sunshine from me and now people think it's his. He drops Malteasers and Sour Patch Kids and a purple Powerade on the counter. I look at the drinks in the fridge, registering they are each a different colour and it looks cold in there and I'd like to squeeze in there like liquid around the bottles and freeze myself solid, into a new shape. 
""Do you want anything?"" He calls back with that slightest, tiniest note of annoyance, of hurrying, that is indetectable to the cashier but tables my whole world in a second. I grab some sort of iced tea from the shelf, a weird flavour in a weird bottle, which I know will be too sweet or too bitter because it doesn't sell but I think I just want to waste his money and I don't even want to drink it anyway. I walk over to the counter slowly, carefully, trying not to fall on the big cool tiles on the floor, and put my drink down.
The cashier scand it wordlessly, he doesn't want anything to do with this drug-addled fucked up pair of clown losers in front of him. I make eyes at him, and he is stunned for a second then returns to pushing buttons on the till. Oscar pretends he doesn't see this, because he hates me and he hates it all, and he doesn't want to react, not in front of them, he looks at me and makes a silly face. I make a silly face back and we act like a good old happy couple for a few minutes. The third party is necessary since we're both performative and we hate each other passionately but not enough to ruin ourselves in the eyes of society, not quite yet. This sparks a sort of comradery that will last us approximately 3 minutes. We say ""thank you"" at the same time, and grab our snacks and drinks, and Oscar opens a bag of Malteasers and offers them to me, and I take a sip of my drink and say ""It's alright"" with a telling face when he asks how it is. And because he seems satisfied with that answer, I think, hey, maybe it is alright, and the drink tastes okay for a few sips. But then it warms up and I tip it on the ground before we pull away. ""You didn't like it?"" he asks disappointedly, ""nah it's kinda weird tasting"" I say, we are conneseiurs, ""you want some of mine?"", ""thank you"" I look at him adoringly, he feels great, I take a swig of his Powerade, we climb in the car +1 empty bottle and +2 packets of candy. 

I take more pills, covertly, 10 minutes in to the drive, trying to knock myself out flat. He accepts silently that he'll have to drive the next 3.5 hours alone, and stops to make a coffee. I cry about the seat not going back and lie down on the red dirt because even though the pills have turned my pain into pleasure, there is this itchy lumpy restless agony inside of my soul that never dies. I drift off into dreamland, but the dreams don't actually come because of the heavy wet fog. I just listen to half-takes, snippets of sound, metal pots clanging on the floor, a cough, the ghostly imprint of voices, silent but perfectly shaped, TV channels playing my memories changing every 5 seconds. ait's agony, I am here, and I am not. Once I was, someone. Now I am, no one. Am I ugly when I cry? I'll be better to him. I just want him to fuck me. All day every day.

Are there any local e-bike or e-moto meetups around New Orleans? Like group rides, build show-offs, or just chill community hangs?

I know traditional bikes have a few regular events, but the battery-powered crew (us!) might want to cruise at a different pace—or just pull up and show off shelf-bought rides, custom builds, or whatever you’re rolling on.

Maybe it’s just a shower thought… but imagine an all-electric cruise through the Quarter or a mini-parade down Esplanade. 😎🔋⚡

It's been months now. I've been constantly coming back to the Bastion of Faith for the Sunday sermons. I forgot all about my log of events when I first started coming here. There have been events in the past week or two that made me realize I should be recording my experiences. This weekend was the most bizarre by far. It's hard to find a spot for me to pick back up. 

I was completely sold on the church. I hadn't been so excited to go to Sunday mass since before my father died. The pastor was more and more charming each week I returned. His miracles became more and more breathtaking. Life felt good. 

The day started out as normal as any other day. I had bought nice suits to wear to church now. I wore navy blue with a nice Paisley tie. I would skip breakfast at home and opted to get brunch with the pastor after church. 

When I got to the Bastion of Faith I saw some friends that I had made there getting coffee. We all sang and listened to the pastor preach from the Bible. It was a good sermon just like all the rest. However when he finished his sermon, the light grew dim. Zacharious spoke in a softer tone now.

“Well everyone we have a lil something going on today. We are going to exorcise a demon on stage for you all.”

By this point I have seen people flying, a man dying and once the pastor even brought a man back to life. Honestly his miracles were so numerous that I couldn't even begin to describe all of them. Needless to say, the crowd was captivated instantly. We had no idea what this entailed or who was getting exorcised. Every member of the audience perked up and gave their undevided attention to Zacharious. A member of the church worshiped the devil during his early years. Apparently, in college, David was into the occult for a short time. Witchery, magic and gem stones. Although I don't believe in that stuff I could tell that Zacharious took it very seriously. David was certain that the devil was still in his life. Satan was allegedly causing him to lose sleep and feel bad emotions. David had apparently been coming since around the same time I started attending and was moved by the pastor's sermons. 

I'll admit, this sounded ridiculous. Even after the stuff I had seen, this seemed like a fable. I believed that exorcisms were only done in movies. I was only able to suspend my disbelief because Zacharious was taking the situation so seriously. He had followed guidance from the Vatican and had multiple things set up in preparation. There was a circle of salt around a chair in the center of the stage. Zacharious had also brought a bag of supplies to aid in this endeavor.

The pastor had David sit in the chair in the middle of the stage. The room went quiet as Zacharious began. He opened up a very, very old looking book and began reciting. It must've been Latin or something because I couldn't understand what he was saying. Whatever language it was, it certainly wasn't English. For a while nothing happened as he read. I was starting to think I was right about all of this being a hoax until about three minutes into the exorcism. I could tell David was sweating. He seemed to be very uncomfortable as though he was about to vomit. There was a sense of unease that began to pervade the room. It felt like a dense fog had descended upon us. The cozy vibe of the church was gone.

All of a sudden David began to scream. Zacharious noticed, but did not stop reciting the old text. Two congregation members in professional church attire held David down to the chair. His scream subsided, but only because David was actively holding them back. Every so often a word from the pastor n would cause David to cry out in pain. 

The lights were already dim, but they became even dimmer when David screamed. The power fluctuated every time David writhed. Then all of a sudden David got up from the chair. He pushed the congregation members away with enough force that they didn't bother coming back. David was drenched in sweat now. He begged Zacharious to stop, but his plea fell on deaf ears. David began to run around the same circle like a caged animal looking for an escape. He seemed unable to leave. This filled me with more dread. 

David began to unbutton his shirt. This was confusing at first, until we saw it. David had claw marks forming on his chest and abdomen. His skin was deep red in these spots as if it was scar tissue. I swear I saw something underneath his skin crawl, but I told myself it was a trick of the mind.

Zacharious pulled a round jar from his bag on stage. David could instantly tell what it was. He put up his hands and screamed as the pastor doused the man in holy water. The power had been fluctuating a little before, but with this action, David's screaming had plunged the entire church into darkness. Not even the emergency lights were on. People gasped in fear. We could only see what was illuminated via the red and yellow stained glass. 

The microphone was no longer on, however we heard the pastor shout the name of our God at the man. Then, in a way I still cannot describe, the ambience in the room changed. It was silent in a way that filled the emptiness in the air. As if silence was a sound itself. It washed out all the other noises.

From where David was lying on the stage, he was illuminated with light from the window. His shadow was splayed on the floor of the stage. Some of the lights flickered back on which gave us a false sense of hope. Then, we saw it. The lights depicted something we wish had stayed in the shadows. A shadow had formed behind David's body. It crawled up the wall and became a towering presence. The shadow was inhuman. It was clear what this was, it was a demon. I wasn't able to see the creature itself, but I could vividly make out the shadow on the wall. Only one person in the room was able to see the demon. He saw the creature for all of its horror. 

The pastor looked scared. I had never seen that man falter in confidence until now. Seeing the look on Zacharious’ face filled me with even more dread than seeing the demon's shadow. I didn't feel safe anymore, I began to feel paranoid. What if there were more in the room? Something happened that snapped me out of my paranoid monologue. Zacharious shouted. I looked back up at the stage to see Zacharious suspended in the air. The scene before me was bathed in an ominous red glow. I could tell by the shadow, the demon had our pastor in his hand. 

Zacharious struggled for a moment, trying to fight the demon's strength. He grasped the air where the demon's arm would be. He latched onto it and squeezed. Zacharious shouted at the demon, but I couldn't hear what he said because simultaneously the demon let out a bassy cry that rattled the church. Instantaneously I saw the demon's shadow retreat in pain. His deformed body was still human enough to read the body language. It was in pain. The demon continued his squealing. It was almost like a down pitched pig squeal. That sound was disgusting.

The pastor picked up the book and continued to read. The demon let out more and more pitiful cries until his shadow ceased to exist. The power slowly returned and so did my sense of security. There was no longer an ominous feeling of dread in the air.

The pastor collapsed on stage and the crowd rushed to check on him. I remember seeing the blood. The demon's claw had pierced his skin and let loose a deep current of the pastor's blood. However, he was no longer bleeding. That man has enough power left to save himself from what would have been a fatal amount of blood loss. He was still breathing.

As for David, he seemed different now. He seemed frail in a way. I can't explain it, but that demon must have been very attached to him. It looked like the exorcism took a lot out of him. He was out of breath just sitting in a ball on the stage. We tried to comfort him, but it was no use. He was shell shocked. No one could get through to him until one man spoke. Zacharious had regained conciseness and sat up. 

He spoke with great effort.
“Hey Sonny, there's nothing to worry about. I got him out of you. I sent em back to hell. You're safe.""

The pastor was able to conjure up enough charisma to come across as confident and as genuine as ever. And it worked. Zacharious snapped him out of his trance. David was pulled from the spiral he was going down. David hobbled over to the pastor and hugged him. They began to laugh out of pure excitement. The congregation cheered. It was sweet, but unfortunately, they were both covered in the pastor's blood now.

One thing still remains in my mind to this day. The pastor didn't have a shadow.

1nbg872,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToysAndTots/comments/1nbg872/nuna_triv_next_stroller_review/,Nuna TRIV Next Stroller Review,"If you’ve ever fallen down the stroller rabbit hole, you know it’s a wild mix of “I just need wheels for my baby” and “why does this thing cost as much as a secondhand scooter?” That’s exactly where the Nuna TRIV Next comes in, it promises to be this magical middle ground between compact travel strollers and those hulking, feature-packed beasts.

# First Impressions: Sleek, Compact, and… Pricey

* It looks good. Matte black frame, luxe leatherette touches, modern vibes, you won’t feel like you’re pushing a clunky “baby bus.”
* It’s *light* for a full-feature stroller (around 18–21 lbs depending on what’s attached). You can fold it one-handed and it stands on its own, which is clutch when juggling a baby, diaper bag, and iced coffee.
* The price? $700 for the stroller alone. And that’s before you start adding extras like the bassinet, cup holder, or travel bag. Ouch.

So yeah, Nuna isn’t playing in the budget league. But you *do* feel the premium build the second you touch it.

# What I Loved

# City-Friendly Size

This thing is like the stroller equivalent of a studio apartment done right: compact but somehow roomy enough. Narrow enough for store aisles, light enough for subway stairs, yet it still feels sturdy.

# One-Handed Everything

The fold is kind of viral for a reason. Tug the strap and boom, it collapses. You don’t look like you’re wrestling with a transformer in public. Also, the push is buttery smooth, even one-handed while scrolling on your phone (don’t judge).

# Reversible Seat

Baby can face you (great for when they’re tiny and you’re paranoid about every breath they take) or face the world. Switching is quick and easy.

# Canopy + Comfort

The UPF 50+ canopy is generous, with a peekaboo window (so you can sneak a look without crouching awkwardly). The seat itself has breathable mesh for summer, cozy merino wool for cooler weather, and a no-rethread harness (aka no fiddly strap-adjusting nightmare).

# Car Seat Compatibility

It works seamlessly with Nuna PIPA car seats thanks to the included adapter. Snap, click, done. No confusing buttons or wobbly attachments.

# The Not-So-Great Stuff

Okay, so it’s not all roses. Here’s where the TRIV Next might bug you:

* **The Basket Limit (ugh):** The storage basket is decently sized but only holds 10 lbs. Which… let’s be real… is like one diaper bag and a pack of wipes. Forget using it for groceries.
* **Canopy + Tall Toddlers:** Once your kiddo gets taller, their head may bump the canopy. Some parents said it felt like their toddler was ducking under a low ceiling.
* **Not All-Terrain:** It’ll handle sidewalks, parks, and cobblestones fine, but if you live near gravel paths or like “off-roading” with your stroller, this isn’t it.
* **Nuna-Only Car Seats:** Huge bummer if you already own Chicco, Maxi-Cosi, or UPPAbaby seats. The TRIV Next only plays nice with Nuna.
* **The Price Tag:** Did I mention it’s $700? And that’s before accessories. You really have to commit to the Nuna ecosystem for it to make sense.

# Daily Use: My Real-Life Notes

* The **telescopic handlebar** is awesome if you and your partner are different heights. (I’m 5’4”, my husband is 6’1”… our backs thank Nuna.)
* The **brake** is flip-flop friendly, which I didn’t know I needed until summer hit.
* The **seat recline** is *almost* flat but not 100%, so for newborn naps you’ll probably want the bassinet or car seat attached.
* Folding/unfolding in a parking lot? Smooth. But it can occasionally “pop open” if not fully clicked. Annoying but not a dealbreaker.

# Who I Think This Stroller Is For

Perfect for:

* First-time parents in apartments, condos, or city/suburb life.
* Families who already own (or plan to buy) a Nuna PIPA car seat.
* Parents who need one-handed everything (fold, push, buckle) because they’re often solo.
* Taller parents who are sick of bending over strollers designed for hobbits.

Not so perfect for:

* People who want to use non-Nuna car seats.
* Families who need a double stroller in the near future.
* Rural folks or anyone walking mostly on dirt/gravel paths.
* Parents who regularly haul Costco-sized grocery runs under the stroller.

# Final Verdict

The Nuna TRIV Next is like the Goldilocks stroller light enough for travel, feature-rich enough for daily life, and fancy enough to make you feel like you didn’t just buy the “basic” option.

Yes, the basket limit is silly, and yes, $700+ hurts. But if you’re already in the Nuna world (especially with the PIPA car seat), it honestly makes your day-to-day life way easier.

Would I recommend it?  
If you’re city/suburb parents who want something sleek, compact, and premium: absolutely.  
If you need rugged terrain, extra storage, or flexibility with other brands: probably look elsewhere (UPPAbaby Cruz or Vista might be better).

Overall? I’d give it a **4.7/5**. Elegant, practical, and let’s be honest, a little envy-inducing at the playground.",1,1757312494.0,ToysAndTots,0,1.0,False
