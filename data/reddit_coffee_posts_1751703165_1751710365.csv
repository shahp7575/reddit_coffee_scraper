Hey Reddit!  
A few months ago, I was absolutely convinced that AI was going to take over my job. I totally get it, the headlines were all about ChatGPT replacing writers, Midjourney threatening illustrators, and generative tools making entire creative departments redundant overnight.  
I have to admit that I felt a bit panicky. I started getting a bit carried away with job boards, brushing up on random certifications, and even considering a full career change. I found myself asking, ""If a machine can do it faster and cheaper, what's the point of my years of experience, late nights, and creative grind?""  
But then something really lovely happened.

I decided to let go of fighting it and embrace it instead.

I asked ChatGPT to help me brainstorm some taglines for a product I was stuck on, just out of curiosity. I was so surprised that it didn't spit out gold, but it gave me really good raw material to riff on. It was like having an average intern, but one who never got tired or needed coffee breaks. 😅

Then I tried Midjourney to come up with some ideas for a branding project. These are just early ideas, not final designs, just a few moods, concepts and aesthetics to get your creative juices flowing. Once again, I didn't find anything that I thought was quite good enough to put in my portfolio, but it really helped me to get past those creative blocks I was facing. Instead of spending days trying to solve them, I was able to get past them in just minutes.

The shift in mindset was so subtle, but it made such a huge difference:

Instead of competing with AI, I started working with it.

I realised:

💡 AI doesn’t replace taste.

💡 AI doesn’t understand brand nuance, voice, culture, or ethics.

💡 AI doesn’t care—and caring is literally half the job in creative work.



Sure, AI can generate 10 logo options in seconds. But it can’t tell a client’s story, or instinctively know when something just “feels off.” It doesn’t negotiate feedback, balance business goals, or design with empathy. We do that.

I see AI as I see Photoshop or Grammarly – just useful tools that help me out, nothing more, nothing less. I can't tell you how much time it saves me in some weeks! Don't worry if you find yourself not using it for a few weeks now and then. But it never replaces me. It makes me feel so good when I let it.

If you're in a creative or strategic field and feeling the same AI anxiety I was, I totally get it. It's real, and it's beautiful. But let me tell you from someone who was ready to jump ship—don't run from the wave. Why not have a go and learn to ride it? You're still the surfer, and that's great! The board just got better, which is great news!

I would absolutely love to hear how others are integrating AI into their work (or struggling with it, we all have those days!). I'm sure we can help each other get through this together.",1,1751710067.0,u_ProfessionalMap5085,0,0.99,False

We started chatting, and she gave me her business card. I told her I didn’t have one, so I suggested connecting on LinkedIn. She handed me her phone, I keyed in my profile, and she told me to message her just in case she missed it.

Then she insisted on adding each other on WhatsApp. Again, she passed me her phone to put my number in, and I texted her straightaway. I mentioned I had an event coming up in July if she was interested. She said, “Sure.”

When the event ended, I said, “See you at the next event then.” And she cheekily replied, “Why wait for the next event? You can meet me anytime you want,” then giggled and walked away.

Fast forward 2 days later—just for context, my office building has 30 floors and 8 lifts. We work at different companies, and she doesn’t even work in my building. But of courseeee, I bumped into her in the lift because she had some meetings there. We said hi, small talk, then she walked out, turned around, and waved goodbye.

At this point, I posted on Reddit, and most people told me to text her. So… I did. But she kinda “hey bro” me, so the conversation was awkward. 😭 I didn’t ask her out properly, just sent her the invite to my event.

Fast forward a month to a few days ago—she actually came to my event. I saw her at the photobooth with her friends, but she immediately left them to come greet me. We were happy to see each other. She asked me random personal questions like where I was born, but I didn’t mind—I’m just naturally awkward. Then my colleague, who was actually the main PIC for her account, came over to greet her, and she immediately shooed him off saying, “I’ll come to you later,” then focused right back on me. (For context, she doesn’t work with me in any capacity.) Later I had to excuse myself.

After the event, she texted me:
“Sorry I had to leave first, but thank you for inviting me. It was nice. Hope to see you at other events.”

Like…I can feel there’s some interest, but she never takes it further, like asking, “Hey, wanna grab coffee?” So I’m just here like…idk how to proceed.

And this isn’t even the first time. Back in uni, there was this girl who literally bought me food every day and even came to my dorm to give it to me…and again, that’s it. No flirting, no asking to hang out, nothing.

I’m a very nerdy, shy, awkward person. 😭 I really need the other person to clearly say, “Hey, wanna hang out?”—then I can take action.

Any advice? Or maybe I just overthink everything.

1ls6fb0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalCannabis_NI/comments/1ls6fb0/street_cannabis_vs_medical_cannabis_whats_the/,Street Cannabis vs Medical Cannabis: What’s the Difference and Why It Matters for Your Health,"Think cannabis is cannabis, no matter where it comes from?

Not quite.

There’s a huge gap between what you’ll find in a dodgy baggie from a friend-of-a-friend and what you’ll get through a legal medical prescription. And that difference could be the key to whether cannabis improves your health, or makes it worse.

At **High & Polite**, we believe in the power of cannabis as one of nature’s greatest healers. But we also believe in **education, informed choices, and safety**. And that starts with understanding the difference between **street cannabis and medical cannabis**.

This article is your clear, confident, and compassionate guide to that difference, and why it really matters.

# What Is Street Cannabis?

Street cannabis, also known as black market or illicit weed, refers to cannabis sold outside of legal or regulated channels. In the UK, where recreational cannabis is still illegal, this is the form most people are familiar with.

It’s often sold in unlabelled bags with no information about:

* **Strain**
* **Cannabinoid content (THC/CBD)**
* **Pesticide or solvent residues**
* **Contaminants like mould or synthetic cannabinoids**

And while it’s often cheaper and easier to access, street cannabis comes with **serious health risks**, especially if you’re using it for **therapeutic purposes** like [anxiety](https://www.highandpolite.co.uk/cbdnews/cannabis-and-anxiety-how-to-maximise-relief-without-making-it-worse), chronic pain, or insomnia.

# What Is Medical Cannabis?

Medical cannabis refers to **lab-tested**, **prescription-grade** cannabis products that are dispensed by licensed pharmacies under the supervision of a doctor. In the UK, this has been legal since 2018, though access is still limited to private clinics for most patients.

Medical cannabis is:

* **Tested** for contaminants (like heavy metals, pesticides, mould) 
* **Labelled** with exact cannabinoid content (THC, CBD, CBG, etc.) 
* **Selected** based on individual health needs 
* **Grown in controlled conditions** to pharmaceutical-grade standards 
* Often available in **non-smoking formats** like oils, capsules, and dry herb vape products 

This means you know exactly what you’re getting, and how much of it, which is essential when using cannabis as a medicine.

# The Risks of Street Weed: It’s Not What It Used to Be

There was a time when cannabis from the black market was relatively mild, grown in the UK or imported hashish with balanced THC and [CBD](https://www.highandpolite.co.uk/cbdnews/cbd-vs-hhc-whats-the-difference-and-which-ones-right-for-you) ratios.

But today, it’s a different game.

Street cannabis is now overwhelmingly **high-THC, low-CBD**, which makes it:

* More **psychoactive** (leading to anxiety, paranoia, and panic in some) 
* **Less therapeutic** for conditions like inflammation or epilepsy 
* More **addictive** and likely to induce tolerance 

On top of that, it’s often:

* **Sprayed** with chemicals to boost weight or appearance 
* **Grown indoors** using toxic pesticides or fertilisers 
* **Mouldy or contaminated** due to poor storage and curing 

For someone seeking **relief** from chronic health issues, this is a dangerous lottery.

# Why the Difference Matters for Your Health

If you’re using cannabis to support your **mental clarity**, **pain management**, [**sleep**](https://www.highandpolite.co.uk/cbdnews/cannabis-and-sleep-natures-answer-to-insomnia), or **gut health** (as many of our readers do), consistency and purity are essential.

Let’s break this down:



In short: **if you’re serious about health, medical cannabis is the only safe option**.

# Our View: We Support Access AND Safety

Let’s be clear – we’re not against recreational use. Far from it. We believe adults should have the freedom to explore altered states, relax, and connect with nature or others through cannabis, just like they do with alcohol or coffee.

But we do believe in:

* **Safe methods** ([dry herb vapes](https://www.highandpolite.co.uk/cbdnews/how-to-use-a-dry-herb-vape-and-why-you-probably-should), oils, edibles, **not smoking**) 
* **Clean products** (free of toxins and contaminants) 
* **Conscious consumption** (with awareness of dosage, strain, and set/setting) 

And we believe everyone deserves access to **high-quality cannabis**, whether for recreation or healing.

# How to Get Medical Cannabis in the UK

Yes, it’s legal. No, you don’t need to wait for your GP to understand it. You can go directly to a [**private cannabis clinic**.](https://www.highandpolite.co.uk/cbdnews/the-rise-of-medical-cannabis-clinics-in-the-uk-what-you-need-to-know)

Here’s what to do:

1. **Check if you qualify** – You’ll usually need a history of a diagnosed condition and tried at least two conventional treatments. 
2. **Book an online consultation** – Many clinics operate virtually and are happy to guide you. 
3. **Receive your prescription** – If approved, you’ll be sent a prescription tailored to your needs. 
4. **Get safe, tested cannabis delivered** – Direct from a licensed pharmacy.

# Final Thoughts:

Cannabis can be one of the **most powerful tools** in your wellness toolkit. But like any tool, its effectiveness depends on **how you use it**.

Street cannabis may seem convenient, but it could be doing you more harm than good, especially if you’re using it to **treat**, not just to **chill**.

Knowledge is power. And with medical cannabis now legally available in the UK, there’s no reason to settle for second-rate.

You deserve better weed. You deserve better health.

And we’re here to help you get both.

He sat across from me, probably engrossed in debugging some intricate code. Manvinder. Just twenty-four, with a quiet intensity about him. Not conventionally handsome, perhaps, but there was a certain charm, especially when his eyes crinkled at the corners when he delivered one of his surprisingly sharp jokes. Those coffee breaks with the team had become a highlight of my day, all thanks to his unexpected wit.

I playfully started calling him ""bro"" every now and then. It was a little game, a way to gauge his reaction, to see if there was any flicker of something beyond mere collegiality. He was so reserved; I needed a way to test the waters, even if it was just a little splash. When I finally asked if it bothered him, he said it didn't. I expected a bit of fight from him. A tiny sting of disappointment, but I wasn't ready to give up yet.

But those moments when the office quieted down, when it was just the two of us, the atmosphere shifted. I'd casually remark, ""Things feel a bit dull without everyone around, don't they?"" It was my not-so-subtle way of hinting that he was the one who made things interesting. And then I’d simply look at him, holding his gaze a little longer than necessary, hoping he’d pick up on the unspoken invitation. He usually just met my eyes with an innocent curiosity, and the silence would stretch, thick with unspoken possibilities… and a healthy dose of awkwardness.

He was genuinely helpful when I was wrestling with a tricky work problem, and I found myself ""stuck"" a little more often lately. It was a flimsy excuse to be near him, to feel that brief connection as we leaned over a shared screen. Outside of work, though, it was like we existed in separate universes. No late-night chats, no weekend meetups. Our connection, however intriguing during office hours in Indore, seemed confined to these four walls.

He is medicated and doing much better of late, however the old habit of gaming is becoming more of a problem. I understand it’s an outlet but like you’re a father of two children, he is gaming almost every chance he can get. I put the babies to bed 90% of the time and he games. I’ll come out and he takes ages to eventually spend time with me. He enjoys his job and is on significantly more money than he has ever been on. He doesn’t have a social life at all and doesn’t want to get one. 

He has gained 30kg in the past year and still seems depressed - even more so lately despite upping his medication (Dr said he shouldn’t up anymore). He doesn’t want to change meds because he feels so much better than he used to and thinks he just had to deal with it. I am losing attraction to him (physically and emotionally) and feel so terrified and guilty about it. He has made positive change since the crisis but I am starting to see things that worry me again. Like an uptick in gaming. He works 4 on 5 off, typically. 

Today, he came off night shift and I had only had 3 hrs of sleep (up with screaming infant - teething, worst night ever, he knew because I called him having an anxiety attack at 2am). He slept about 6-7hrs and said he needed to go back to bed after only waking for about 5min. I just was like whatever okay. He went back for a couple of hours. I was like I need help. He immediately was happy and nice, made a coffee, played with the kids for a minute and then dispersed into the man cave with the baby. Leaving our 4yo to her own devices in the next room - she is fine to be alone for short periods within earshot but really missed him. I didn’t know because I was trying to rest in the bedroom and thought he had it under control. No less than 10 min and she came crying to me, he was snappy at her as she woke the baby (baby was in carrier while he played video games). She was whining but just wanted attention from her daddy. Before this I found him alone while I was playing with the kids, 3 coffees in and no energy. 

This is random and may not be true but I find that he is a lot more irritable and aggressive when he plays. I can just tell. He stays up late and pretends to go to bed with me. He will then be groggy and difficult to wake in the mornings which is frustrating because I’m up feeding the baby through the night with no help most of the time. I also think it makes him more likely to watch porn etc. I think he’s doing it again but hiding it from me too. It’s weird. Maybe I’m way off but I think they’re related. Like one addiction feeds into another and changes his personality. (?)

What could I do to help him? What are some healthy outlets or hobbies he could take part in (maybe?). He says he wants to rejoin the gym etc but hasn’t. His lack of motivation is sad and honestly a bit distressing considering he didn’t used to be like this as much. He does very well at work. I just feel like he gives the rest of us what’s left and it’s not much. 

When I tried to discuss it he said I was being controlling and he needs freedom. Am I? I honestly don’t know. I said all he needs to do is communicate when he needs a break - he told me he shouldn’t have to. He gets so defensive. He told me to take a break whenever I want but I can’t trust him to not play around the kids and give them his full attention anymore. I also don’t think it’s healthy and feel it’s selfish to just do whatever you want when you want. I always consider his tiredness and moods when I take time for myself.

As someone coming from abroad, my knowledge of German law is limited, so I’d like to ask a question regarding an issue many of us might face.

I recently moved into a new flat in Berlin, and the noise level in the apartment is constant and quite severe. I’ve heard from others that it may be possible to request a rent reduction if the noise significantly affects the quality of life and can be proven as such.

Does anyone have more information on this? Is this a reliable option? How does the process work?  
Where can one apply for this?

And a related question: Could the landlord potentially refuse to renew my contract or issue a notice to leave as a form of retaliation?

Thank you in advance for sharing your experiences and advice!

PS. The noise is coming from three main sources:

There are two construction sites on the ground floor, right next to the residential building. They are not constructing anything new, but they regularly cut and break materials like iron and stone from 8 AM to 4 PM.

Additionally, the apartment directly above me is undergoing a full renovation. It’s still in a very early stage — there are no finished walls or floors yet — and it looks like the work will take many months.

This constant activity makes it extremely difficult to live comfortably in the apartment. Every day, I wake up around 6 AM from the noise of workers talking and drinking their morning coffee, followed by drilling that starts at 8 AM.",1,1751708702.0,AskAGerman,7,0.67,False

I wasn’t looking for the most advertised or top-rated models, but ones that consistently hold up in daily use.

Here’s what I focused on:

* Reviews that mention long-term performance, reliability, and how the mixer holds up with regular use
* YouTube videos showing real grinding tasks like turmeric, dry masala, and idli batter
* Common complaints about excessive noise, tricky cleaning, or poor jar design
* Reddit comments from people who’ve either regretted their purchase or swear by a particular model that ""just works""

The comparison chart covers wattage, number and type of jars, noise levels, build quality, and how well each model handles dry grinding, chutneys, batter, and juicing. I’ve added pros and cons for each one so it’s easier to figure out which ones are worth considering based on your needs.

## How to Choose Right Mixer Grinder

There are four broad species in the mixer grinder ecosystem:

| Type | What It Does | Should You Care? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Traditional Mixer Grinder** | Basic grinding, chutneys, masalas | Yes, this is your daily driver |
| **Mixer Grinder with Juicer** | Same as above + Juice extraction | Maybe, if you pretend you’ll drink carrot juice |
| **Stand Mixer** | Heavy-duty mixing, baking, whipping | Only if you’re running a home bakery |
| **Wet Grinder** | For dosa/idli batter — granite-based | South Indian homes: YES. Everyone else: chill. |


### Wattage – No, 1000W Isn't Always Better

For most homes, **500–750W** is the sweet spot. More wattage = more power, sure, but also more noise and higher bills.

| Use Case | Ideal Wattage |
| --- | --- |
| Daily chutneys, masalas | 500–600W |
| Tough stuff (coconut, urad dal) | 750W |
| Wet batter, large quantities | Get a separate wet grinder, don’t push your mixer |

Pro tip: Avoid anything below 500W. You’re not here to stir dahi.


### RPM

Most good mixers run at **18,000–23,000 RPM**. Higher RPM = faster blade = faster grind. But...

*   **More RPM ≠ better taste** — spices can overheat and lose flavor.
    
*   Make sure there’s a **3-speed knob** with a pulse mode. No single-speed nonsense.
    

### Jars – It’s Not About Quantity, It’s About Use Case

You need at least **3 jars**:

1.  **Large jar** – for wet grinding, batters
    
2.  **Medium jar** – masalas, pastes
    
3.  **Small jar** – chutneys, dry spice mixes
    

Juicer jars? Meh. Most just become dust-collectors. Unless you're juicing daily, skip it.

*   **Stainless steel** > plastic. Always.
    
*   Transparent lids = no need to open every 5 sec to check.
    
*   Bonus: Get jars with **handles** that don’t fall off after 3 months.
    
### Blades

Stainless steel, **304-grade** or bust. You’ll typically find:

*   **Dry grinding blades**: Sharp AF. Good for masalas, coffee, dals.
    
*   **Wet grinding blades**: Blunt, like your ex. Good for smooth pastes.
    
*   **Chutney blades**: Smaller, fast, powerful.
    

Blades are wear-and-tear items — plan on replacing every year or two if you cook a lot.

### Motor Quality

*   **Copper winding motors** last longer and resist heat.
    
*   **Aluminum motors** = cheap junk. You’ll smell burning in 6 months.
    
*   **BLDC motors** (like Atomberg) are the future — quieter, energy-efficient, expensive but worth it if you're a heavy user.
    

### Safety

Minimum safety checklist:

*   **Shockproof body**
    
*   **Anti-skid feet**
    
*   **Lid locks that don’t fly off mid-spin**
    
*   **Overload protection** – automatically cuts power when you abuse it
    

### Warranty & Service

2 years is standard. But ask:

*   Do they cover motor failures?
    
*   Do they service in your city/town?
    
*   Is it a 7-day repair or a 30-day “we’ll get back to you”?
    

### Price

You’ll get decent machines in this range:

| Price | What You Get |
| --- | --- |
| ₹1,500–₹2,500 | Entry-level, low wattage, meh build |
| ₹2,500–₹4,000 | Mid-range, good for light use |
| ₹4,000–₹7,000 | Reliable, heavy use, copper motors |
| ₹7,000+ | Fancy features, BLDC, silent, smart UI |

Avoid local no-name brands unless you love the smell of burning plastic.


### Ingredients It Should Handle

*   Spices (cloves, pepper, cinnamon)
    
*   Dal & rice (for batters)
    
*   Coconut, onion, garlic, ginger
    
*   Tomatoes (for thick gravies)
    
*   Nuts (cashews, almonds)
    
*   Coffee beans (if you’re fancy)
    

If it chokes on dry turmeric, return it.


### Maintenance Tips (So It Doesn’t Die in 6 Months)

*   Wash jars after every use. Yes, even when you're lazy.
    
*   Don’t overload. Your mixer is not Thor.
    
*   Start slow, increase speed gradually.
    
*   Always clean under the blade. That gunk builds up.
    
*   Replace blades and rubber gaskets as needed.
    

### TL;DR 

**Checklist Before You Buy**:
- 500–750W copper motor  
- 3 jars min, stainless steel  
- Speed control + pulse  
- 304-grade SS blades  
- Reputed brand (Philips, Preethi, Sujata, Bosch)  
- Good service in your city  
- Warranty that covers the motor",1,1751708610.0,DesiKitchenGear,0,1.0,False
1ls64q4,https://www.reddit.com/r/PolymyalgiaRheumatica/comments/1ls64q4/coffee_thoughts/,Coffee thoughts,"Good morning all. The following long post results from my sleepless night and frustration. Can you relate? I would love to hear your thoughts and comments. Please share! Thanks so much for listening. It helps to vent. 😒

A LONG ROW TO HOE
Everything about the autoimmune disease Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR) is difficult. A huge challenge to say the least in dealing with the pain and stiffness, the difficulty walking and simply moving, the sleeplessness and fatigue, the brain fog.  However, the medications with their side effects really put the icing on the cake. 
In my book, “When Pain Speaks: Reclaiming Life With Polymyalgia Rheumatica” I do mention often the woes of remaining on corticosteroids, Prednisone, for extended periods of time though not in any great detail. To be honest this is one of the greatest challenges for me. I want to elaborate more here. 
In addition to the difficulties mentioned above, just the weight gain itself is a huge detriment for the condition overall. For me for example, carrying 35 extra pounds with my 5’2” stature comes with great issues. When I walk it feels as though I am carrying a ton of bricks on my hips, legs and back.  Exhaustion results even though I am moving at turtle’s pace. I cannot begin to explain how frustrating this is, again along with everything else. 
It is a vicious cycle with such an increased appetite and cravings and not being able to exercise properly if at all. I can’t walk for exercise. That’s obvious. I have tried “swimming” and by swimming I mean getting in the pool dog paddling or treading water. My body is so stiff and the pain especially in my back is so great that it’s almost impossible to accomplish. I cannot even get out of the pool easily. It would help if the pool at my condo had step railings but mine doesn’t. So that last step onto the concrete deck is both difficult and dangerous. 
I don’t know if everyone experiences some loss of balance as I have. I also must add that I have a great deal of degenerative disease in my back emphasizing my issues here. Thus I may suffer way more in back pain involvement than others. My first symptoms began with severe back pain along with the upper body pain in my shoulders and neck which is so typical for the beginning of PMR. My back pain never subsides now. 
In conclusion of these thoughts and comments having and living with PMR is emphatically, frustratingly and sadly a “long row to hoe”. Will it ever end?

Hey.

I don’t even know why I’m recording this.

You’ll probably never hear it. I don’t even know if I want you to. But there’s this weight sitting on my chest, and I guess this is the only way I know how to let some of it go.

It’s been a while. Not long, but long enough that it already feels like a lifetime. Five months that’s all we had.

But if I’m being honest, those five months were the loudest, softest, most chaotic, most beautiful months of my life.

You were my first love. I didn’t even know what that really meant until I lost you.

You had this smile you know that, right? Not the kind that you pose for. The real one. The tired, sleepy, eyes-half-closed kind. The one that made me forget we were always arguing. The one that made me feel like I was in the right place, even when everything else was going wrong.

And your laugh…

You laughed even when my jokes sucked. Especially when they sucked. You made me feel like I was worth something, even when I didn’t believe it myself.

And still… I ruined it.

I was immature.

You were, too, in your own way. We were both trying so hard to prove we didn’t care too much. But we did. God, we really did.

I used to think love was supposed to be loud, dramatic, passionate. I thought fighting meant we were deep. Real. But it turns out, real love isn’t always that noisy. Sometimes it’s quiet. Consistent. Soft in a way we didn’t know how to be.

We fought like the other person was the enemy. We held grudges like they were medals. We waited for the other to break first and in the end, we both did.

That last fight… I don’t even remember what started it. Maybe it was something dumb. It usually was. But I remember how it ended:

Me, standing there, angry and tired and afraid.

You, looking at me like you didn’t recognize who I’d become.

I walked away.

Not because I stopped loving you but because I didn’t know how to fix it.

I was scared. Of saying the wrong thing. Of trying again and failing. Of losing you slowly, painfully, piece by piece.

So I let it happen all at once.

And you let me go.

That’s what breaks me the most. You didn’t chase me. Maybe you couldn’t. Maybe you didn’t know if I wanted to be chased. But in that moment, we let go of something that still had life left in it.

I think about that a lot.

The way we ended. Not with silence but with fear.

People talk about closure like it’s this neat little bow you tie on pain. But I don’t have closure. I just have questions. Memories. Ghosts of a smile I can still see when I close my eyes.

I don’t know where you are now. I don’t even know if you think of me.

But I think of you.

When I hear that song. When I pass the coffee shop where you spilled your drink on your jeans and pretended it was “fashion.” When I say something dumb and no one laughs, and I suddenly wish you were there to say, “You’re not funny, but you’re cute.”

I don’t want to rewrite us.

We were flawed. Messy. But we were real. And that matters.

If I could go back not to fix everything, but to hold your hand a little longer, or to tell you one more time that I loved you I think I would.

Not to change the ending. Just to make the middle even warmer.

I hope you’re okay.

I hope someone holds you like you’re worth holding, and listens to you when your voice cracks, and laughs at your weird little jokes even when they’ve heard them before.

And if you ever, just for a second, wonder if I ever really loved you 

The answer is yes.

I did.
I do.
In that quiet, stubborn, forever kind of way that doesn’t ask for anything back.

I was scared.
But I loved you.

And if you ever hear this

Know that somewhere out there, there’s a version of us  laughing, holding hands, still in love.

And maybe that’s enough.",1,1751708222.0,story,0,1.0,False
1ls62d9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndia/comments/1ls62d9/need_a_female_perspective_am_i_overthinking_this/,Need a female perspective — am I overthinking this or is there something more?,"So there's this female colleague of mine — she's 30, divorced, and we work in the same team. I'm 24, kind of an introvert, not really the good-looking type, but I do have a solid sense of humor (honestly, that's the one thing I’m proud of). She even says she likes my humor pretty often, especially when our whole team is chilling over coffee.

Now here’s where things get a little confusing. She randomly started calling me bhai — not all the time, just like once every couple of days. Then one day, she asked me if I have any problem with her calling me that. I mean, what would anyone say in that moment? I said “No, it’s fine.”

We talk, laugh, and have a great time when the whole team’s around. But when it’s just the two of us, the vibe is different. She’ll say stuff like “I miss the team” or “it’s boring without them” — and not just once, she’s said it several times. And whenever she says she’s bored like that, she just starts observing me — like staring silently — and I honestly don’t know what I’m supposed to do in that situation. It gets awkward real quick.

She also helps me out when I’m stuck with work, which is nice. But outside of the office, we don’t text or call or anything — all our interaction happens at work.

So yeah, I just wanted to ask the girls here — do you think she might like me? Or am I just overthinking it? I really can't tell and would appreciate your perspective.

This is a recipe that actually works for making a retinal extraction. No carrot puree involved. What you actually need to extract retinal at home is LIVER. Carrots have beta-carotene in them which is just a precursor to retinal and its not bio-available. I formulated this recipe based on chemistry and I chose a method that would be safe at home. There are other more rigorous methods that are certainly fire hazards.

The end result of this is a neutral smelling oil with a medium concentration of retinal. It's perfect for adding to your own DIY face creams for overnight retinal masks.

Equipment Required

•	1 L borosilicate boiling-flask with stopper or foil cap

•	1 Large Graduated cylinder (250 – 1000mL)

•	Large stockpot or saucepan for water bath

•	Probe or meat thermometer (°F/°C)

•	Blender

•	Nitrogen or CO₂ source

o	whipped-cream charger + dispenser or dry-ice pellets

•	Coarse kitchen sieve

•	Double-layer cheesecloth

•	Coffee filters (0.45 µm paper ideal)

•	Food-safe food scraper, 2 stirring instruments

•	Pipette or 20 mL plastic syringe

•	Amber safety glasses or dim red/amber bulbs

•	Gloves

•	70 % ethanol / 10 % bleach for sanitation

•	Amber-glass vials or aluminum bottles, self-sealing

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Ingredients

Item	Amount	Notes

Fresh pork, beef, or cod liver	1 kg (diced)	≤ 48 h post-slaughter, kept on ice

Almond or sunflower oil	1 kg (≈ 1.1 L)	Cosmetic- or food-grade, fresh

Mixed tocopherols (vit E)	0.5 % w/w (≈ 10 mL)	Antioxidant

Rosemary essential oil	0.05 % w/w (≈ 1 mL)	Antioxidant, scent

Bentonite clay	0.5 % w/w (≈ 10 g)	Final clarifier

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Step-by-Step Process

1 · Sanitize & Set-up

1. Disinfect bench, tools, and flask with 70 % EtOH or 10 % bleach; air-dry.
2. Dim lights or switch to red/amber bulbs.

2 · Blend Under Cold & Gas Blanket

1. Rinse, trim, dice liver (1 inch cubes).
2. In blender: liver + oil + tocopherol + 3 – 5 drops of rosemary essential oil → smooth emulsion, make a liver smoothie.
3. If you’re using dry ice, put a few pellets into the flask first until the air is displaced.
4. Transfer to 1000mL boiling flask.
5. If you’re using N2 from a whipped cream container, PLEASE make sure you don’t add any dairy to your mixture. Release N2 into the top of the boiling flask until all the air in the flask is displaced.
6. Seal the top with either foil or a lid.

3 · Warm Extraction (120 °F / 49 °C)

1. Place flask in 50 °C water bath.
2. Hold 118–122 °F for 5h, swirling every 30 min.

o	Keeps microbes in check; stays below retinal’s 130 °F breakdown point.

4 · Primary Clarification (this is the gross part).

1. Pour through coarse sieve → discard solids.
2. Filter through cheese cloth until the mixture goes through without resistance.
3. Transfer product into a dark container.

5 · Cold Phase-Separation

1. Stir a spoonful of bentonite clay into filtrate. Clay grabs water-soluble debris yet sinks below oil, so yield loss is minimal.
2. Pour into foil-wrapped graduated cylinder; chill at 34–36 °F (1–2 °C) for half an hour.
3. Mix once more to make sure the bentonite fully activates.
4. Put it back into the fridge for a full hour.
5. Pipette/syringe off clear top oil. (The middle layer is water while the bottom layer is muck. Feel free to save the middle layer and allow it to rest in the cylinder again if you want to increase the yield).
6. Repeat this process until all the mixture has been separated.

6 · Polish Filtration

1. The oil should not smell like liver at this point. It should be very neutral smelling, maybe a hint of rosemary. If you want to filter it more, simply add more water, more bentonite clay and mix it thoroughly. Repeat the above process for siphoning off the top layer.
2. Then once you are satisfied, pass it through a coffee filter.
3. Finally add in 3 more drops of rosemary oil and 0.5mL of vitamin E. This helps with shelf life.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Quality Check

Test	Pass Criteria

Black-light spot	Drop on white napkin beside plain carrier oil; retinal oil glows green-yellow.

Smell	Mild rosemary scent. Rancid, fishy, or sour odors → discard.

Visual	Golden oil, no visible sediment. It might be a bit cloudy. A bit like honey.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Packaging & Storage

1. Fill amber-glass or aluminum vials to the brim; briefly purge with N₂/CO₂; seal.
2. Label: “Retinal Oil • Batch \_\_\_ • Extracted YYYY-MM-DD • Est. \_\_\_ IU Vit A /mL”.
3. Refrigerate at 34–40 °F (1–4 °C). Potency drops \~10–20 % per month.
4. For storage beyond 3 months, freeze ≤ 0 °F (-18 °C) once, then thaw and use—avoid refreezing to prevent moisture ingress.",3,1751708154.0,DIYBeauty,0,1.0,False

It's amazing how a little kindness from a stranger can really lift your mood and change your whole perspective, even on mundane decisions like coffee orders. Psychologists call this 'compliment-induced mood enhancement.' When someone acknowledges you in a positive way, it activates the brain's reward system, releasing a little hit of dopamine. Essentially, even the tiniest compliments can make us feel more connected and appreciated.

So just sitting there minding my business, when I heard some yelling. I looked up and there was a car parking/pretty much parked, and a white Subaru type car trying to park behind them (mind you enough room for them to park) 

Anyways it was white Subaru man yelling at the couple in front of him to move, even though they were clearly there first and so much street parking available. Insert eye roll.

Let’s give them names to make this easier.
First car: man = Leo , female = lily (both Indian, this matters latter on) 
Second car (white Middle Aged man) we will call douche.

So douche is yelling at Leo and Lily to move forward, to the point where they would be over a driveway. They say no. Lily got out to tell douche that they wouldn’t move and he could move into another spot if he wanted. Mind you still plenty of room for douche to park and/or reverse out of. 
Douche yelled and swore at lily and abruptly went forward with his car towards lily. 
She jumped back luckily, otherwise he would have hit her.

Leo at that point gets out and yells at douche about how to speak to a woman properly and to move on.

Douche gets out of the car and a back and forth between the three of them happens
Lily starts recording and douche puts his hands in her face in a f you kinda manner.

Eventually douche gets back in car swearing and yelling and proceeds to reverse. He mounts the curb with both front tyres somehow, and proceeds to park in front of them in the many available spots. 

But it doesn’t end there. No the testosterone was too high for that. 

Douche kept going back and forth between his car and the couple who originally thought the conflict was over and started using racial slurs towards them and standing over them.

He laughed when they called the cops but eventually half way through the call had his tail between his legs and disappeared.

Okay, kwento time!

I had this major crush on a guy since 4th year high school. You know the classic “pinagtutukso” vibes? At first, aliw-aliw lang. Until one day, ayun, di ko namalayan—ay, feelings na pala ‘to.

And from there, boom, naging close kami. Every weekend, kasama ko siya. Gimmick dito, coffee shop doon, talking about buhay-buhay as if kami na yung hosts ng “Pip Talk.” Tuloy, nahulog ako nang walang safety net. Pero syempre, classic ako: never ko tinanong kung ano ba kami. Di ko kaya. Parang mas okay na yung “assume” kaysa “assume-rang iniwan.”

College came, same old kami—sweet, clingy, pero wala pa ring label. Kasi nga, di ko matanong. Bakit? Ayoko siyang mawala. Kaloka.

Pero di naman teleserye kung walang “kontrabida” diba? Dumating yung time na nagkaroon siya ng ibang girl na close. At girl, selos kung selos ako, pero award-winning actress ang peg—deadma kunwari. Until nagbusy na kami pareho at ako naman, nagka-BF. Pero… panakip-butas lang. Ending? Walang forever.

After nun, wala na kaming communication. Total radio silence.

Fast forward… as in very fast forward.
Ako ngayon? 29 years old. Career-oriented. Hot single tita. Siya? 31. Still single. NGSB. (NO GIRLFRIEND hmmm) Wow!

Nagkita kami uli sa reunion. And guess what? Naging close uli kami. As in balik sa dati—gala, tambay, uwian madaling araw ,hatid sundo pa sa bahay. Parang bumalik yung high school feels. And yes, girl, 12 years na crush? Di pa rin nawawala. Naging mas hopeless romantic pa ako kasi mas gumwapo siya. Gusto ko na nga ipa-NBI background check yung glow up.

Pero eto na yung plot twist na mas juicy pa sa tsismis ng mga kapitbahay:
Something felt off. Alam mo yung “woman’s instinct”? May sinasabi yung radar ko. So bilang certified stalker (with honors), gumawa ako ng dummy account sa IG. CSI level.

Ayun. Nahuli ko. May second account pala siya—and dun ko nalaman. May jowa pala siya (di ko alam kung jowabels ba talaga, pero ang sweet sa photos beh, mhasakit ). And bet ko din kasi mas GWAPO pa sa kanya. Sabi ko na nga ba eh!

Sakit? Oo naman. Pero natawa na lang ako. Like, girl, 12 years? Para sa isang plot twist na ganito? Pero eto ako ngayon—still pretending na wala akong alam. Kahit sobrang sweet pa rin siya sa akin. Hinahayaan ko lang. (or imagination ko lang to)

Pero deep down, gusto ko sabihin:

“Hoy, alam ko na. And it’s okay. Di kita jujudge. Love ko nga ang LGBT. Pero sana wag na tayo maglokohan. Masaya kayang may BFF na Gayla!”

Kaso di ko alam paano sisimulan yun. Ayoko rin naman siyang i-out o mapahiya. Secret ko lang ‘to. Pero at the same time, gusto ko rin siyang i-free from pretending.

So ayun. Ako si tita mo, hopeless romantic forever, certified Marites sa sarili kong buhay, at nagtatanong: Paano ko kaya aaminin sa kanya na alam ko na? Apaka ka OA talaga nang buhay to noh! 😩",2,1751707016.0,OALangBaAko,2,1.0,False
1ls5s2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1ls5s2s/winning_as_my_petty_betty_best/,Winning as my Petty Betty Best,"Today I was my absolute Petty Betty Best self and showed I won. 

My husband (let's call him Danny) and I are celebrating our 10yr wedding anniversary this year. We have a mutual friend from university (let's call her Meg) who I fully admit I have a complex about. She had a crush on him for a long time (which she openly admitted to) and has always acted inappropriately towards him - late night phone calls when she was lonely, asking for help at weird times, excluding me from events she invited him to....
 
Meg and I were in the same department at university and shared a lot of the same classes and study groups. We had a large mutual friend base. She was very cold to me to start and our friendship took some time to warm up. She never really seemed to have any problems with me and we could easily hang out together. Meg's roommate had some overlapping classes with Danny. Danny and I met volunteering and it was honestly love at first sight.  When we first started going out, Meg's roommate asked us not to announce it publicly to spare Meg's feelings. I said that was hurtful to us and the compromise (I hate that there was one) was that we would wait a day or two before making it """"Facebook official"""" so roommate would have time to prewarn Meg. After Meg presumably found out, she started excluding me from things. 

She invited a group out to the movies and told Danny she had invited me too. She hadn't but Danny said she must have forgotten and brought me along. It was Danny, myself, Meg, roommate and one other friend. At lunch Meg asked me what I was having and then when it came time to order she, roommate and friend ordered things to share between them, excluding me. She organised a couples camping trip and only invited Danny. When Danny told her he'd check if I was available, she told him straight that there wasn't room in the cars for another person so only he was invited.... To a couple's camping trip. Yes Meg had a boyfriend then and he was invited. Danny would be the only single, despite not being single. Meg organised a small party for Danny's birthday at his house with other friends from uni but again I wasn't told. It was a surprise party so Danny didn't know about it to ensure I was invited. 

She finally stopped the exclusion when Danny brought me with him to a dinner at her house with, again, several other couples from our mutual friends group. Again Meg was having a couples night but didn't invite me, just Danny. At the party I confronted her, politely, asking if she had a problem with me and Danny dating since she always excluded me. She responded she was over her crush and hadn't realised she was excluding me. She """"apologised"""" and things improved between us. 4-5yrs later Danny and I got married and invited her with a +1. She brought an ex boyfriend with her and basically avoided him all evening. She organised a wedding brunch for us the day after the wedding that turned out not to be a wedding brunch but just a catch-up brunch with all the friends who had come from out of town. 

On Danny's first Father's Day, she called begging him to come help her because she had COVID and couldn't go out to buy groceries. He left us in the middle of the afternoon to drop groceries at her apartment. He apologised afterwards to me for leaving during his first father's day but took pity on her being sick. When I pointed out she could have had groceries delivered, he made up some excuse about her doormen not being reliable. She invited me out to lunch when I was pregnant but expected me to travel 45mins on public transport with my toddler in the rain to see her. Safe to say I declined that lunch. 

Recently Danny and I have bought our close-to dream house after moving back to our hometown. We have two gorgeous children and are celebrating our 10 marriage anniversary this year. We are slowly inviting our friends over to see the house and Danny wanted to invite Meg over to show her the house and to catch up. I said yes and began planning. 

I got my skincare on point (I don't wear makeup so taking advantage of that new baby hormone glow), slept last night with my hair in curl-cups that I shook out early this morning to give perfect soft beach waves. Scrubbed my house from top to bottom, over stocked the fruit platter, extra fluffed the cushions and made sure both kids were at their adorable bests. The cherry on top, I asked Meg for a favour while she was here. 

She arrived with her dog (she'd asked permission first) and her new boyfriend. They had really odd chemistry between them but have met each others parents so maybe it's serious. I showed off my house, toddler showed off his new books, baby cooed with her fresh cut front teeth and I played faultless hostess serving tea, coffee, fruit platters and cakes. Towards the end of the visit, I called on the favour and asked Meg to follow me to the bedroom. I reminded her it's mine and Danny's 10yr anniversary and we were going to get a photoshoot done in our wedding clothes. I asked for her help trying on my wedding dress! Now 10yrs and 2kids makes a difference in wedding dress fits but it still felt good to pull that baby out of the closet, remove the plastic wrap and gush over it and memories of the wedding to her. Didn't even care the dress didn't fit anymore. 

Meg made some weird comment about expecting my favour to involve me divorcing Danny. Super confused by that assumption and she had no real explanation for it. She just assumed that by me asking for a favour I must be wanting to leave Danny or need her to watch the kids while things happen. I honestly have no idea why but my sister thinks she was fishing for gossip that I was secretly unhappy.

 Shortly after it was time for her to leave and I happily stood next to Danny, us each holding a gorgeous child, in front of our house and watched her drive away. I got the guy, the ring, the house, two kids and we're already planning the next 10years. Safe to say I don't have a complex about her anymore and pretty sure after that divorce comment, I'm living rent-free in her mind.",2,1751706945.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False
1ls5ryc,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1ls5ryc/how_you_can_wake_up_at_5am/,How you can wake up at 5am,"I’m jumping out of my bed right on time at 5am. Finally after struggling for the past month to wake up on time. I made it and felt damn good about it.

The struggle came from me misunderstanding the flow of how to wake up. I thought that if I set up an alarm at…

4:55

5:00

5:05

5:10

5:15

I would be able to wake up .  But instead I would just snooze the alarm clock when I started to ring. So that I could sleep in to 7am.

For the life of me I could not make this work. I tried drinking coffee to make it so that I could not fall asleep.

But that would just lead to me not being able to go to bed later at night. So after trying to figure out how to fix this.

Today is the day when I jumped out of bed almost tap dancing.

So what’s the difference? 

I had a reason for waking up, I did not want to keep sleeping in because I have shit to do.

And now when I think about it, back when I would wake up at 4am in the morning. I had a reason for doing it and it felt like I was on a mission to live life.

Which is why I think that the notion of aiming just to wake up for the sake of waking up is a waste of time.

When I have no reason to wake up, I naturally default to telling myself.

>*Why do you need to wake up now, you have* 

>*the entire day to do the shit you need to do?*

>But when I know that I have shit to do? I wake up right on time when the alarm clock rings.

So instead of focusing on just waking up. Give yourself a really good reason for why you need to wake up. It can be anything.

For me it can be as simple as….

If I wake up right now I can go buy pastry after the gym, so the sooner I wake up. The sooner I can have a dessert.

Remove friction from doing the right thing.

1ls5r7g,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1ls5r7g/just_wanted_to_share_my_story_of_limerence_since/,Just wanted to share my story of limerence since I’ve had a few Twisted Teas tonight,"I’ve always felt limerence since I can remember. I remember being in pre-school and falling in love with a girl whose name I don’t even remember. Obsessed over her constantly at age 4-5 but I never saw her again after pre-school graduation. 

But when I went to kindergarten, it was a new school with all different kids. That’s where I met my long-term LO. First day of kindergarten, September 1998, I swear I was hooked to my LO on Day 1. Went to school with her until we were 18. She showed some interest in me during the early years. She comforted me when my pup passed away in 2003 when we were 10. We slow danced together 3 times together in middle school, my hands on her hips, her arms around my neck. I organized two “after school movie” activities with my middle school class where everyone in the class was invited to a PG-13 scary movie and she sat next to me during one of those two and when I tried to make her laugh by saying things during the movie, she actually laughed and told me “OP, you really are funny, I never knew that”, at the end of the movie. She one time with her friend took me under the playground during one of our last recesses of 8th grade and she took chewed gum out of her mouth and put it in mine. During our 7th grade field trip, there was some situation, where I think we were playing truth or dare in the back of the bus on the way home. I kissed two other girls cheeks and my LO became quite irate. She called me a manwhore and horrible for kissing the other two girls on the cheek. She was the only girl who displayed any negative emotion to me because of this. Freshman year of high school, I ask her to my high schools homecoming. She says yes! I am elated. A week later she messages me and tells me that she forgot that she said yes to a sophomore months ago and that she can no longer go with me. I become depressed. I become nothing. I transfer high schools after two months, going from the high school I am at to the high school she goes to (which was always my 2nd choice and closer to home). I proceeded to not speak to her once until senior year of high school where we went on a religious retreat together. She was making coffee, I said to her, “No cream or sugar for your coffee?” and she said “Nah, I like my coffee black.” And that was it. That was my time with my LO.

 Here’s the bad part. College hits, I go to college about 20 miles away from my LO. Get super depressed in college. Junior year, I go to a psychiatrist and get prescribed an antidepressant. Makes me manic, since unfortunately myself nor my psychiatrist knew I was bipolar. I proceeded to send a friend request to my LO on Facebook (we were friends on FB from 07-12, but she seems to be one of those people who just purges old acquaintances over time, especially since we hadn’t been very close since 8th grade and only had that coffee talk in 12th grade). She accepted it. We’re talking for a little bit, learning about what each has been up to. So I ask her on a date. She says yes! Then it’s like all the dopamine in the world got sent to my brain and I just had to fuck my everything and I mean EVERYTHING up. I proceed to send her about 200 messages with zero response from her in 24 hours. I start thinking of her as some type of Goddess over time as the delusional mania sets in. Get sent to 2 separate psych wards, but the delusions don’t stop. Upon being released from the second psych ward, I went and rode my bike once around her college campus and waited at a park nearby for 3 hours with my Facebook status just saying that I would be there from 1pm-4pm so we could talk or whatever. This was after her college has sent me a certified letter not to step foot on their campus or I would be charged with a crime. I didn’t take this seriously as my delusional mania + limerence completely set in. So I got arrested. Charged with stalking. Spent 7 months in jail on a psychiatric hold until I was deemed competent to continue my case. Got out a week after I was competent and receive 4 years of probation with no contact with my LO. That ended in 2019. I haven’t made any contact and don’t plan to. But I still think of her hourly, and she hasn’t been off my mind since 1998. Ughhhh! Oh and she viewed my instagram story in 2020! What?!?! Oh and during our first “date” I like to say sometimes in my head which was our preliminary hearing where she had to be there. She ran out of the courtroom bawling crying before I came out of the holding cell in shackles 6 weeks after the initial arrest. What does that mean? Idk.

I don’t know why I wanted to vent all of this, but here it is. I just hope my LO has an amazing life and is very happy and fulfilled. That’s all, and I am fully on board with never speaking or interacting with her again. Though if I had a genie or Time Machine, I would probably make a few little changes.",1,1751706844.0,limerence,1,1.0,False

The chatter, the crowd, the old yet beautiful rustic vibe—it all grabbed my attention instantly.

This was the first place I visited in Kolkata. I had read so much about it, seen it in movies, and heard countless stories. But experiencing it in person—alone—was something else. And that was the scary part.

1. I'm a super introverted person.
2. I'm socially awkward to the core.
3. I couldn’t even find a seat.

It felt like a personal challenge. A little life test. I had to face my fear.
So, I walked up to a waiter and asked if there was any place to sit. He pointed to a seat by the window.

I sat down quietly, placed my camera on the table. As I said, I was scared—even to take photos. But somehow, I gathered the courage and captured a few beautiful moments.

Now about the food—honestly, it was average. Not bad, not great. The cold coffee? Just... cold coffee. The kind you make hot and refrigerate for three hours.
Fish fry was good, chowmein was okay. But yeah, the food was overpriced for what it was.

If you’re planning to visit, I’d suggest trying the fish finger or the chowmein. But definitely skip the cold coffee.

	•	High-school best friends. We texted each other 24/7 even while I had another girlfriend and she another boyfriend.

	•	End of June (last year): I was freshly single, she’d been single for 6 months ; the spark we’d buried for flared up.

	•	Mid-July: we made it official—a month before my draft date. We went on to have an incredible month together, spending every second together, madly in love. The base to our relationship was already there, and maybe we jumped to the boyfriend-girlfriend to intensively.

	•	Mid-August: From then until March we saw each other every other weekend, living on stair-well calls and 2 a.m. voice notes. Hard but agreed that wort it.

	•	March–May (lighter duty, both at home): We both had medical issues that sent us home, both very frustrated our incredible first assignment didn’t turn out rhetorical way we had hoped. Yet we looked at the positive side and were happy to be together at home. The first weeks felt like a continuation of the honeymoon faze ; constant laughter, happiness, real “I love you” moments (not a first relationship for either of us, but easily the best). Then the cracks: zero personal space + two very frustrating first army assignments. We started snapping over nonsense, sometimes three times a week. I own most of those blow-ups.

The break

	•	Ten days ago: after another pointless argument, she said she had been ”saw black,” couldn’t feel the love, and ended it. I thought we were push through until our next assignments where everything will be simpler, but she said the past couple of months were just too much, and she didn’t have the emotional strength to rebuild our communications, since she didn’t feel the love.

	•	Four days later: she texted; we continued texting a bit for the day. The next day we met for three hours, swapped belongings, and surprisingly had a good time and sort of a relationship sum up. We agreed to try rebuilding friendship before new postings in August.

	•	Next day: I sent a harmless question; she went distant, said texting like we’re still together confuses her. She asked for no contact to clear her head. She said she’ll text in about a week —either to grab coffee strictly as friends or to have a deeper talk about “us.”

My tug-of-war

	•	Heart: This was the most incredible relationship I’ve known. Part of me believes that if we both calm down and reclaim some personal space, the feelings will surface again.

	•	Head: The only guaranteed healing tool is real no-contact… but that might erase the one chance we have.

What should I do? If I don’t fight for it, there’s a 0 percent chance, and she really is something special. But sometimes, you just have to move forward. And even then, is moving forward remaining friends? She is and was a big part of my life, or is moving forward no contact?

The polished chrome of her motorbike glinted subtly in the background, a silent testament to a different kind of freedom.

She thought of Arjun. He was good, so undeniably good. Kind, loyal, stable. All the words people used when they described the kind of partner you should want. He brought her soup when she was sick, remembered her favorite coffee order, and listened patiently to her rambling thoughts. With him, there was a profound sense of safety, a quiet harbor in a noisy world.

But the harbor, she mused, could sometimes feel a little too still. There were no crashing waves, no thrilling storms. No butterflies doing acrobatics in her stomach, no dizzying preoccupation that stole her sleep. Just comfort. A deep, steady, unwavering comfort.

Was this, she wondered, what real love truly was? A gentle, consistent warmth, like the afternoon sun on her skin? Or was it something more? A part of her yearned for the overwhelming connection, the kind that consumed her thoughts, that made her heart pound with an exhilarating, almost painful joy. 

The kind she’d felt before, briefly, intensely.
Was choosing calm over passion the right thing? Or was she, in her pursuit of a sensible, safe future, simply settling? The question hung in the air, as still and unmoving as the perfect afternoon itself.",1,1751705659.0,IndianStoryTime,1,1.0,False

Me 32F and fiancé 27M have been together for 5 years now and I feel it's crumbling. We're engaged, and I have been holding off the marriage. 
There's obviously an age difference and I think his immaturity has contributed to it, but over the years he's learned a lot and matured. We both came from very broken, abusive households. I haven't always been the most emotionally stable and he hasn't always understood me. I suffer from depression, but I was doing really well up until the 3rd year of our relationship. He's an active duty Marine and I'm a busy nurse. My life is literally just working, gym, cleaning, spending time with immediate family or spending time with him. We've gone through so many ups and downs and I've supported him through SO MUCH.

I've basically been doing wifey duties. Made his birthdays and holidays special. Always got him little gifts. I cooked for him, cleaned after him, took care of him after 3 surgeries, flown out to see him when he was on detachments for the military and even helped him financially with investments. Every freaking time he wanted to do something, I would always do it. 

I've met nearly all of his family and even send his little sister and little cousins money. I love them and they love me. 

I ask very little from him. Loyalty, reciprocation, effort and respect....yet it seems too much, and this is where we're now falling apart 

I had issues with him blatantly liking thirst trap IG pics in my face... even on my birthday. Had to bring it up 3x and eventually I just started retaliating, doing the same to make him understand how it felt and THEN he stopped. 

At one point I had to point out that he was making more of an effort for his friends than us because he didn't even notice. He at one point sent his close female friend money for coffee, but he had never done that for me. I BLEW THE FUCK UP on him. He didn't think anything of it, saying she was just a friend and it was only $5, but it was the principle of it.. I was his fiancé. 

I ask him to help out with chores because I literally work more than he does and he has more days off than me, yet somehow I'm still pulling most of the chores. 

When we're around each other he's always on his fucking phone, even when I'm trying to talk to him. When I brought it up he always had some stupid justification like ""I barely got on it"", so I gave up and started just going on my phone more too causing us to drift even more. 

When I would talk to him, he wouldn't even be listening....and sometimes it's when I was trying to connect with him, but when I give up, then he would get MAD at me for not wanting to talk to him! It's so frustratingly confusing to have someone ask you to talk to them, but only when they notice you're quiet. I just don't get it. 

And now the part that's been hurting the most.. We're not as intimate anymore. Like I don't feel ""safe"" to be vulnerable with him to the point where I can't be turned on. I avoid sex even though I WANT it. I've been watching more porn, desiring other people and fantasizing about someone just.... Loving me. It makes me cry. 
I've brought this up and it's been an issue for 2 years now. He wants to initiate sex every now and then, but I can't even get turned on by him even though I'm horny. 

He always talks about having kids with me, getting a house with me and moving away, but I can't even imagine that life with him after everything. He says he loves me so much, but I'm so tired now. 

I can't let anything go. I hold SO MUCH resentment for past things. 
I feel so pathetic, lonely, depressed and my self-esteem has taken such a toll in this relationship. I don't even feel good enough anymore despite everything I've done for him. 

Obviously there's some things I've left out, but this would go on forever.... 

I feel like ye average couple doesn't go through these things, but I don't know. I feel like I need reassurance and that this is worth fighting for.. Or if it's not.",0,1751705653.0,relationship_advice,5,0.5,False
1ls5gbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1ls5gbk/your_jealousy_makes_me_feel_better_about_my/,Your jealousy makes me feel better about my choices,"So my husband and I travel. Like, A LOT. We do frequent weekend trips away, both semi local and not. We also use all out vacation from work to do international travel. On top of that, I'm into theatre and do day trips to various semi-local theatres to see plays and musicals and make a fun day out of it, visiting bakeries, eateries, coffee shops, local haunts, etc. (Case and point: this weekend, heading to a city an hour away to see an off-Broadway production of ""Cats."")

We have two dogs and my MIL is an all-star who is willing to do weekend/daily dogsitting for us, and we compensate her in various ways (but anything longer than 2-3 days, we tend to board at a kennel). ((And then sometimes we also do dog-friendly trips and just bring em with us.))

I'm the chatty type of person, and while I don't go out of my way to brag, if you ask me, ""any plans this weekend?"" I am absolutely quick to say ""hubby and I are visiting friends out of state this weekend!"" or ""fun beach trip this weekend!"" or ""going camping at x place!"" Etc.

Some of my coworkers quickly caught on that I spend more weekends away from home than not, and have made bitter and judgemental comments, like:

""Dunno how you afford all this.""
""Do you just not care if you're constantly broke?""
""How the hell do you travel so much?""
And so on.

I tried explaining that my husband and I don't travel extravegantly, especially if we're not leaving the country, and that allows us to travel rather frequently. I do so less to explain my actions btw, and moreso to encourage people to travel on a smaller budget. For example, we have an SUV and a memory foam air mattress custom fit to our car, and for weekend trips, we absolutely don't mind just finding a rest area/free parking area, laying our backseat flat, pumping up the air mattress, hanging up our fairy lights, opening up our moonroof, and star gazing until we fall asleep. When you aren't paying for hotels/air bnbs and you dont have kids to worry about, budgeting travel is a lot easier.

Anyway, there's a good number of people who still act bitter about my traveling, and I notice all of them have children. I gently tried telling a few of them that kids make traveling harder, but most of them insist that their kids ""aren't that expensive so it can't be that."" 

Bud, it is absolutely that. Food alone is outrageous. Clothing prices are frequently high way robbery. Want an extra bedroom in your home for the kid to sleep in? Add 30% or more to your rent prices. 

Sorry (not sorry) you made choices you regret, but I purposefully stayed child-free so I could live the life I've always wanted, and now I'm eagerly and happily doing so with a partner who feels the same way. At first, it irked me that people acted so bitterly jealous about my travel, but now... I just glean a small pleasure in knowing that my lifestyle is enviable, unglamorous as it often is. It almost feels like validation that I did something right with my choices (not that I need validation, but ya know).

Anyway, just thought I'd share since folks who aren't child-free just don't seem to understand why I love my CF lifestyle.",41,1751705623.0,childfree,6,0.98,False

1ls5e99,https://www.reddit.com/r/EasternCatholic/comments/1ls5e99/my_experience_in_eastern_rites_as_a_latin_catholic/,My Experience in Eastern Rites as a Latin Catholic,"I had the opportunity to attend various divine liturgies in the eastern churches and I wanted to share my impressions as someone who previously only knew the Latin Church. I went to a Maronite Church (Antiochene Rite using St. James), a Melkite Church (Byzantine Rite using St. Basil and St. John Chrysostom), a Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church (Byzantine using St. John Chrysostom), a Greek Orthodox Church (Byzantine using St. John Chrysostom), a Syro-Malabar Church (Edessan Rite using Sts. Addai & Mari), and a Coptic Orthodox Church (Alexandrian Rite using St. Basil). Since my background is in the Latin Church, I will use this as my default frame of reference. 

A couple of similarities exist across the eastern churches that I noted. The first and obvious one was the lack of kneeling and abundance of standing. The prayers are all recognizable to me, but often far more verbose than ours and also fixed, i.e. no alternative prayers (preface, blessing, etc). A third one is the presence of deacons and subdeacons as well as the heavy use of incense. The last was coffee and snacks in a side building after the liturgy.  

The antiochene rite, as I experienced it in the Maronite Church, was perhaps ironically the most familiar and most foreign to me. The vibes were probably the closest to the Latin Church, being more solemn and serene, as well as the use of unleavened bread and the priest standing versus populum. That being said, the prayers themselves tend to be very different from ours in a way that I can't really pinpoint. The focus I get from them was ""God is loving."" 

With the three byzantine churches I've experienced, the main difference between them seemed to be more aesthetic (music, icons, regalia). The Divine Liturgy of St. Basil was perhaps the closest to the roman rite, I was very pleasantly surprised to see how familiar it is. The Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, on the other hand, was completely different in vibe, it almost felt like there were no breaks between the sections in the liturgy and just rolled on for the full duration. The focus I get from them was ""God is almighty."" 

The Syro-Malabar's holy qurbana felt like a hybrid between the byzantine rite and the latin rite. The main impression I got from their qurbana was that it felt more ceremonial, something you would see in a national ceremony or Olympics or similar, almost like a ""let's get down to business"" vibe. I really love how their priest stands versus populum during the liturgy of the word and ad orientem during the liturgy of the eucharist, it takes the best of both worlds and makes perfect sense to me in their explanation of facing the people to preach and facing the altar for the sacrifice. The focus I get from them was ""God is holy."" 

The coptic mass was by far the most mind-boggling to me. The first thing that stood out was how long it is, the divine liturgy I went to was a relatively ""short"" one at 3 hours, but my coptic coworker mentioned that it would typically go up to 4 hours back in Egypt. Their liturgy was very lively and vibrant, very celebratory. Honestly, it felt less like what I expected from a church and more from a wedding reception, in a joyful and reverent way. The prayers in the Coptic Liturgy of St. Basil was so similar, and an edge even more than the Byzantine Liturgy of St. Basil, to the Mass of Paul 6 that we use. If the Maronite was similar in vibes but foreign in prayer, the Coptic is the exact opposite. The focus I get from them was ""God is merciful."" 

I haven't gotten the chance to visit an armenian church to see what the Armenian Rite is like, but I do hope that I might get an opportunity in the future. An extra observation I had about the Melkite Church is that their aesthetic (especially music) is perhaps the most stereotypically arabic, compared to the Coptic Church and the Maronite Church, someone who didn't know better might even think it was a mosque if he heard the chanting. 

I hope this could be an interesting read to lurking western christians or even eastern christians who never had the chance to visit some of the other rites. One thing I have to note is that despite the number of differences I saw, the similarities even with the Latin Church was far greater; I could keep up with all of them without struggling because the core of the divine liturgy is essentially the same. It's really quite an interesting and pleasant experience to see the diversity in the Church. Please do feel free to ask me or even share your own observations.

Woke up late to the pup goin’ wild,
Slipped on a sock—yeah, that’s my style.
No demon kids screamin’ in my ear,
But the dog threw up in the hall—I stepped right in it, dear.

No coffee to brew, but I don’t drink that mess,
Still muttered “what now?” while I cleaned up the stress.

Something’s leaking, something smells,
The fridge moaned back like it’s been through hell.

Trash bags piled from the purge we began,
Junk from squatters with no damn plan.

Axe body spray ghosts still haunt the air,
But hey—at least they’re no longer there.

Dishwasher blinkin’ like it’s speakin’ in code,
And I stepped on a screw in barefoot mode.

My tools? Still right where I left those suckers—
No more, “Hey, I borrowed it,” from freeloadin’ fuckers.

The bathroom’s quiet, no soap gone AWOL,
No slime on the wall or Nerf darts in the hall.

Laundry’s half done, but at least it’s mine,
No Fortnite shirts or toddler pants in line.

Still got dog hair rollin’ like tumbleweeds,
And bills that stack like Decepticon schemes.

But the house is healing, slow but sure,
Each breath of calm feels kinda pure.

And best of all… I took it back.
That sacred space where there’s no attack.

The Prime Cave—sealed off, mine once more,
No more kids camped out on the floor.

Once a refuge, then a fuckin’ mess,
Now it breathes like steel and peace, no less.

Dust off the shelves, line ‘em proud and tight—
Fifty Primes deep, like beacons of light.

Figures aligned like a battle hymn,
Each one whispering, “You outlasted them.”

My sanctuary, my silent roar,
The spark restored behind that door.

Red and blue legends, lined just right,
A glowing reminder—I won this fight.

The rest? A crew of steel and lore,
Forty-five percent of what I adore.

Still…
Something breaks, something spills, someone barks too loud,
And I swear the quiet gets heavy, even without the crowd.

Life ain’t perfect, and that’s okay—
Because some shit still sticks to the day anyway.

So I mutter “fuck it” and roll my eyes,
But deep down I see through the daily lies.

The war is done, but the cleanup stays—
Yeah… it’s just one of those days.

And as the great Optimus once declared,
“One shall stand… one shall fall.”

Well, I’m still standing—
and the bums? They’ve fuckin’ fallen.

After a heartbreaking and rapid seven-week battle with terminal lung cancer and multiple strokes, our beloved Timothy passed away. He fought through unimaginable pain with strength and love, holding on for his family until the very end.

This illness came out of nowhere, and his decline was as sudden as it was devastating. Due to living on disability benefits, Timothy had no savings or will in place, and we are now asking for help to give him the farewell he truly deserves.

Timothy was a beautiful soul—warm, generous, and full of life. He fiercely loved his family and welcomed friends into our home with open arms. If you were kind and respectful, you became part of our extended family. Our home was always full of laughter, stories, and love—because Timothy was at the heart of it.

He had a passion for the outdoors—fishing, camping, cycling, and handcrafting bows and arrows. Children naturally gravitated to him, and he would lead them on magical adventures filled with exploration and wonder. At home, you’d find him in his favorite armchair, sipping coffee and working on crossword puzzles, always ready with a dad joke or a thoughtful conversation about history.

We are hoping to raise funds to cover funeral expenses and provide Timothy with the dignified farewell he earned through a life of love, laughter, and kindness. Any amount helps and is deeply appreciated. If you can’t donate, please consider sharing this with others who may wish to help.

The one person outside my family who I know would be willing to take a bullet for me, best friend. Well, he was getting worse, so I took him to Marietta Memorial in Belpre, because anyone who lives in Parkersburg knows that if you go to Camden Clark, you're just going to sit for hours. I speak from experience. Toothache, crippling pain, sat in the waiting room for nine hours.

Anyway, the toll bridge was fastest. Usually, I would never take the toll bridge. In my opinion, it's nothing but a scam. ""It's less than a cup of coffee!"" But the 6th street bridge is FREE! I never received a bill. Until two days ago. 89 dollars and a threat that they were going to escalate it to collections.

1ls53oq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ls53oq,Coffee in Tokyo Day 2,"So I went on a meandering walkabout today. I got to check out one place from a redditor suggestion - Philocoffea, one on my list About Life Coffee, and a return visit to glitch, but at their other location (wanted to buy their drinkware). Everything I got was pour over, with glitch being one hot and one cold. Overall, here are my thoughts. 

About Life Coffee - Onibus Rwanda beans - (first photo) it's fine coffee. It felt like it wasn't in the same category as everything else. i.e. It's a café while the others are more bespoke coffee 'bars'. Got a ham and cheese sando with it too. That was good, but I didn't like the thick cut ham though (fat wasn't fully rendered, so those parts were tough).

Philocoffea - 539 Ethiopian - (pix 2-4) thoroughly underwhelming experience. Great customer service, I had a lovely chat with the barista as he made my drink, but the flavor profile didn't come through to what the tasting notes indicated. I do NOT like the minimalist industrial vibe. Nowhere to sit. Only place to set your drink fits about 3-4 people while VERY SAD plants occupy the corner of in a giant concrete room (which is basically empty), being deprived of sunlight. They are located in the basement of a building. Has the most ridiculously accessible bathroom I've ever seen (pictured), like totally opposite vibe from everything else - sheer toiletry maximalism. Overall feels unfinished, like they ran out of money.

Glitch (Jinbocho location) - Honduras (hot) and Colombia (cold) - OK so the two locations were very different experiences. BOTH had WONDERFUL aromas when you walk in (Jinbocho is where they do the actual roasting). Something no other place had. I really enjoy being able to smell the beans before making a decision, at Ginza it really helped me notice the differences between the options. For whatever reason, the beans at Jinbocho all smelled fairly similar. As for the coffee itself, I was pretty meh on both. Not bad not great. Maybe my palate was wrecked by now, IDK. I kinda wish I did the Colombia hot as well. 

Overall I liked the first two drinks I had at glitch yesterday the most (see previous post), and wound up buying 150g of the Campo Hermoso to take home. They give you a brew profile and a sample of the grind size so you can replicate at home (really cool, IMO). Didn't get the drinkware, they were sold out. 

I feel like regardless of who's doing the brewing, which beans you choose can vary the tasting outcome wildly.*

Glitch by far was the best _experience_ out of all. The thoughtfulness put in to the process really made it stand out. They were also hands down the most busy/popular (with PHILOCOFFEA being eerily vacant - they're also in what I felt like is a weird neighborhood). 

Tomorrow I plan to visit Apollon's Gold for their espresso (another reddit rec.). The other multi-course tasting experience that was suggested sounds really cool, but I'm not going to do it. Don't have the time, and don't want to spend $130 on it. 

I'll be heading to Kyoto and Osaka as well, if you have recommendations in those locations! 

*Disclaimer - I do not have an exceptionally refined palate for coffee. With that said, again the drinks from glitch (Ginza) were the most accurate to the tasting notes. Also, I don't have a strong understanding of the different processing methods (washed, honey, natural, etc.), and how they can impact the overall flavor profile. 

I've enjoyed the tour, will keep it going while on this trip. I'm happy to check out anywhere else, time permitting. Let me know!",7,1751704114.0,espresso,1,0.89,False

I ended up calling her bc I was honestly just worried but she answered the phone all excited “Omg OP how have you been” and goes on to say basically that she hadn’t really been able to reach out to anyone the past week because of personal reasons; now the issue is i feel like i maybe over reacted in response? I let her know I was glad to hear she was okay but felt hurt that she didn’t give me a heads up (like i had asked for in the previous convo we had, i dont mind space i just hate the not knowing) and essentially asked her if she thought we should take a step back if she felt so overwhelmed by external factors that she couldn’t communicate w me properly. She goes on to say she was thinking about that but that we should talk about it more in person, which I did agree with but I feel like I did start to get a bit frustrated atp, because she said she didn’t think I was open to being friends but just drew this conclusion without asking me. Idk I think that my mistake here was voicing that this indecision was frustrating to me as I very much dislike having to make those kinds of calls for others and i have expressed that before to her in the past. We essentially ended on both needing a bit more space but wanting to catch up and talk over coffee in a week from now because we have gotten really close since we started seeing each other. Redownloaded some socials to coordinate on plans with friends and noticed she unfollowed me and made me unfollow her, trying not to read too into it because I imagine it would be hard to look at my stuff after that conversation but ughhh this whole thing is making me nauseated
