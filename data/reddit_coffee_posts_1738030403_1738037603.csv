What I did not know in those early days is how much more complex my journey would get over time due to ‚Äúsecondary loss.‚Äù

I had never heard of the phrase ‚Äúsecondary loss‚Äù until I joined this club, yet I now know it well.

These losses impact my emotional, psychological state and even my daily routine.

They are lost dreams, future plans and lifestyle.

These are not things that others around me can or do see, so they simply don‚Äôt understand as we widowed people often say.

I struggled in silence with these losses and struggled alone and still do.

I used to be the one who did all the groceries and cooking and that gave me great pleasure and joy to make meals for her.

Now, I rarely cook yet am trying to get back to it, yet cooking for one is very different than cooking for two.

Our social life involved a lot of art, shows, exhibits, wine and cheese and meeting new interesting people.

I have not been to any events at all since she passed and interacting with new people seems near impossible.

She loved to iron so she would iron all my shirts, now my closet is full of wrinkled clothes.

She also did all the cleaning; it took me a week to figure-out the washing machines.

There are people we used to see on a weekly basis that I considered friends, and now, I have heard from almost no one.

Needless to say, the invitations don‚Äôt come either which can be very isolating.

My daily routine was out the window within the first week.

Our morning coffees always started our day. I don‚Äôt drink much coffee anymore.

For almost one year, I could not watch our shows. I still have trouble with this, yet started new shows.

I had not made a decision alone in the fourteen years we were together, it was always what was best for us, and we made those decisions together.

For many, financial stress is another form of secondary loss. Imagine losing half your household income overnight; might you need to sell your home and move?

Selling and moving can be difficult in the best of times, imagine this with layers of grief on top.

Hugging, holding hands, kissing, and saying I love you was part of our everyday for over a decade. In one second, that was gone. The psychological and even physical pain this can cause is substantial that I find others simply don‚Äôt understand.

All of these things might seem small and subtle, yet they can compound over time.

In my head, there are many days whereby I feel like I am losing her again and again due to all these secondary losses.

Because of all of this, at this stage, I have come to realize that I might need something more than grief support.

What has helped me recently aside from some of the items I have mentioned in previous instances is coming to peace with certain things.

I have come to peace with knowing I need to create a new routine for myself, in this way, I have acknowledged the loss of my old routine.

I am choosing to embrace the future and write it the way I want to see it evolve.

I have started making new friends and connections and so far, this has been very helpful. Yet, I may need to do more like joining some of the virtual peer support sessions.

I am working on new dreams and new goals for myself.

I am also being very patient with myself by not taking on too much until I complete what I started.

All of this will take time, and I am giving myself permission to mourn all these losses as I need to.

By doing all of this, I feel as if I am reclaiming my life from this point forward even if the one I had has been lost, my new life is emerging.

I was at a chicken restaurant with friends when she (19F) came in. After we paid the bill, I went over to her table, complimented her, and asked for her Instagram. She accepted and gave it to me. I messaged her later, saying that we could meet up if she was interested, and she agreed. We arranged a time and place.

Before meeting her, I bought her a bouquet of coquina flowers (since it was New Year‚Äôs and every girl seemed to have coquinas in hand) and a 4-pack of Krispy Kreme doughnuts. When we met, she asked for my name because she had forgotten it‚ÄîI let it slide. Then we went to a Starbucks, where I bought us coffee.

While we were chatting, her phone rang. The caller was saved as ""My little bugggg <3."" She got up to take the call, trash-talking the guy who had called. She mentioned that he was toxic and made a generalization about guys from his country being toxic (she‚Äôs a foreigner, and she was talking about my country). However, she added, ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre not like them.‚Äù (I‚Äôm from the same country she had just criticized.)

We chatted for a while, though I started feeling uncomfortable. At one point, she looked at her watch, and I asked if we should leave. She declined, so we stayed and chatted more. After leaving Starbucks, she suddenly said, ‚ÄúI like \_\_\_ street food.‚Äù Wanting to be a gentleman, I bought her that street food and even hand-fed her. She seemed happy (understandably, lol).

Since I had invited her on the date, I covered all the costs. Later, we parted ways at the metro station, but not before taking some pictures together. That night, I asked her to send me the photos, and she responded five days later. She ghosted me for a while after that, but then messaged me again. I started replying late too‚Äînot days late, but around 10 hours or so.

Eventually, we talked again, and she suggested we meet up. Up until two days ago, I had been posting Instagram stories that made me look rich and bourgeois. She saw the stories but didn‚Äôt reply. Then, three days later, she saw one of my stories and messaged, ‚ÄúWhere is this place? We should go there together.‚Äù I think one reason she replied was because of how I appeared in the stories.

We arranged a time and place for our next meeting. I baked some cinnamon rolls for the occasion. On the day, I picked her up, and we greeted each other with a handshake. Once we got in the car, we chatted. She showed me her nails, I complimented them, and then asked for permission to kiss her hand‚Äîshe obliged.

When we reached our destination, she connected her phone to Bluetooth and played some music on the way. We unpacked and sat in a park, chatting. I asked what she was drinking, and she said beer, so I bought us a couple of beers and shared the cinnamon rolls. I tried to be as gentle as possible and even brought a poncho in case she felt cold.

We talked for a while, and I kissed her hand, complimented her, and said some romantic and poetic things in her language. At one point, she asked, ‚ÄúWhere do you see yourself in 20 years?‚Äù I answered something like, ‚ÄúI see myself as a successful businessman or a pilot.‚Äù

We spent around 2‚Äì3 hours there. Later, she said she was too tired, so I offered to carry her. She said yes, and I carried her part of the way on my back and in my arms. When we got to the car, she mentioned craving sushi. I initially complained about the cost of sushi restaurants but eventually took her to one and bought us a 12-piece sushi platter. Hand-fed her again to be romantic.

We ate and chatted. I paid the bill, and when we left the restaurant, I carried her to the car again (it was across the street). She seemed shy. Since we couldn‚Äôt decide on another place to go, I asked if she was sleepy. She said yes, so I drove her home. During the ride, I held her hand. She played ‚ÄúCareless Whisper‚Äù by George Michael and even placed my hand on her thigh.

When we arrived, we ended the day with a hug that started with a handshake. I complimented her, saying she smelled amazing, and she blushed. Afterward, I messaged her to check if she‚Äôd reached her apartment safely, and we texted a bit.

From a girl who ghosted me for five days, she‚Äôs now responding to my texts within a few hours.

In case we met for cinema or bowling should I split the bill? bowling is a little bit more affordable but cinema is too expensive. Help me.

# My questions:

1. Is this the start of a strong relationship?
2. Since I‚Äôm a university student with a finite income (I still receive pocket money from my family), how can I politely suggest splitting bills without seeming stingy? I sense that this relationship might become expensive.
3. What are some red flags you notice from my experience?

TLDR;  
Met a girl, asked her out, and paid for everything on two dates (flowers, coffee, food, sushi). She ghosted me after the first date but became more responsive after seeing my Instagram stories. On the second date, she seemed more interested, holding hands and playing romantic music.

Questions:

Could this lead to a strong relationship?

How do I suggest splitting bills without seeming stingy?

Any red flags here?

Everyday there is at least one girl who apparently went to Starbucks before school (before 7am) to get some sort caffinated beverage, who is bringing them, when they are going, and why they are getting up so early to get Starbucks is beyond me.

Is this some sort of weird social pressure to like mediocre coffee? It's seemingly especially common for the ""basic"" blonde, popular, girls to have some sort of obsession with the... restaurant (I guess) to have an obsession with the drink.

What kind of addictive substances do they put in their products (MSG, sugar, ect)?

4:30 AM, a time before time should start, as the sun has not yet risen. The proverbial 'early bird' still hasn't waken up, and the worm is safe and sound to move around. Johnathan was transfixed on an invisible horizon visible only from his bed.

Dark, smooth ceiling is what Johnathan saw, plain and simple. No ceiling fans or sheep jumping across his vision to save him from his wakefulness, this unrelenting energy that held him captive for countless hours. ""Insomniac"" the tests results had read when he was younger, back before he was living on his own. Back then, Johnathan could count on his parents to wake and take him to doctors appointments, and to get him there on time. He couldn't get anywhere on anytime it seemed these days, one moment it was morning and the next it was midnight 3 days later, and bills stamped with OVERDUE streamed in the mailbox. Johnathan had a brief moment of clarity as he thought back on a previous doctor's appointment he had managed to actually show on time for several weeks ago.  
  
The memory trickled into view, the fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, the crinkle of the paper he was sitting on rang in his ears. A gruff, tired voice stole his attention, ""I shouldn't need to remind you Mr.Schuler, but I'll say this again, the medicine can't help you from inside the bottle, you need to take it out and actually USE the medicine I prescribe."" The doctor had waggled his purple gloved finger at Johnathan when he had said it, although both patient and doctor should've known it was a fruitless endeavor, as Johnathan struggled to remember what he even had for breakfast mere hours before, or that he even had this appointment. Johnathan lived on his own after leaving his hometown to be more independent and was immediately struck by the reality that without his family nearby, he couldn't possibly function as a ""proper adult"" as his father put it bluntly.

A fresh memory pushed it's way to the front of Johnathan's mind, bubbling and pushing other thoughts away. ""No plan! No effort! You just 'go with the flow!'"", his father shouted, stomping emphatically in the kitchen, the somber grey sky lighting him in silhouette, ""that's no life to live Johnathan! You're capable of so much more and yet you live in a daze, what are you possibly going to do with your life?"" A heavy moment passed between the men, broken by a thoughtless truth. ""I don't know! I have never known what I wanted!"" Johnathan spat, tears welling into his eyes as both the realization of who he had yelled at and the truth behind his words hit him. ""I'm going outside"" Johnathan said bitterly, his lip quivering in anger and sadness. He walked away from his father, out the back door and spent nearly an hour failing to collect himself. Tears welled in his eyes as the gravity of the exchange weighed him down to Earth and then some. He had no idea what he wanted, and he felt wrong for it, broken even. His want WAS to want something, but that wasn't enough. The memory rapidly faded as his watch beeped, immediately ripping Johnathan back to his bed, back to the bland ceiling he was stuck looking at.  
  
Insomnia, as he had been diagnosed with, was terrible. It wasn't bad enough he couldn't sleep when he needed to, but when his body tried to, his mind would hold his conscious hostage. He had tried all the old remedies from relatives and online forums, the sleep-aid medicine, the shot of whiskey before bed, the teas, oh the teas had been horrible, no matter what type it was nor the honey contained within them. Johnathan stayed far away from caffeine, no energy drinks at work or morning coffees to turn to ritual in the wee hours of morning. When he did make it to work there were always comments from coworkers and customers alike, ""You look tired."" a million voices sang ""You should try \_\_\_\_\_!"" they solicited. Then they kept going with their lives, meanwhile Johnathan got less and less sleep per week. It did not affect his work, the shelves still got stocked, the product faced. When customers asked questions regarding the locations of products, Johnathan could still point them in the right direction.¬†  
  
Johnathan blinked slowly, attempting to put the brakes on his brain. He focused on what he could sense in the room. He felt the weight of the comforter on his body, the pressure underneath his head from his overpriced pillow. He listened to the whoosh of hot air from the central heating vents. He inhaled deeply, smelling the lavender relaxation wax melts he had received as a gift on his birthday. He focused so hard on not focusing on anything that ultimately it did nothing. He gave up and wondered how many hours had passed.  
  
Johnathan slowly turned his head towards his nightstand, an old faded wood veneered digital clock beamed the time in bright red LED lights.

From the beginning, though, I noticed something a bit unusual: he mirrors everything I say. For example, if I mention I was thinking about something random, he‚Äôll immediately say, ‚ÄúI was thinking about that too.‚Äù If I say I‚Äôm craving pasta, he‚Äôll say he was just thinking about how much he wants pasta.

He also wants to be involved in every activity I do. For instance, I‚Äôve always enjoyed going to drawing sessions, and he had never drawn before, but suddenly he wanted to join. At first, it felt nice because I‚Äôd been alone for a long time, and it was comforting to have someone so interested in spending time with me. But after a while, I started to find it a little strange how much he wanted to hang out and be part of everything. I‚Äôve had to ask for space several times because I really need my alone time, and I‚Äôve been honest about that since the start of our relationship.

Another thing I was clear about from the beginning is that I don‚Äôt believe in marriage. Now, he‚Äôs started talking about moving in together and making future plans, and honestly, it scares me. Part of me feels that after 1.5 years, I should be open to these discussions, but it‚Äôs hard for me to reconcile that with my feelings.

There‚Äôs also an issue with money. He‚Äôs always been reluctant to talk about finances, even though I‚Äôve shared mine openly with him. When I‚Äôd ask directly, he would avoid the subject, which made it uncomfortable for me to keep pushing. Recently, I finally told him I deserved to know, and he admitted that he has trauma around money because his ex took their savings. After that, he opened up, and I learned he earns much less than I expected.

That‚Äôs not the issue‚ÄîI don‚Äôt mind if he earns less‚Äîbut I feel uncomfortable that it took this long for him to tell me. It feels like something I should have known earlier. He says he‚Äôs in a transitional phase with his business and that he‚Äôll be earning more soon, and I want to believe him. But part of me wonders if I should trust myself when I feel something‚Äôs not quite right.

There‚Äôs also the way he handles money day-to-day. He insists on splitting everything, even small things like $5 coffees. He never spends money on me outside of special occasions like birthdays or Christmas. No dinners, no casual treats‚Äînothing. While I want an equal relationship, I find his attitude toward money a little odd. Now that I know he earns less, I understand his behavior a bit better, but it still bothers me.

So I have a friend whom her and I used to be close. I got married first then had a baby and 2 years later she got married (no baby)

I had my baby and didn‚Äôt tell her about my pregnancy until 6 months ( she was upset about and said you should have told me earlier on but didn‚Äôt because of personal reasons bla bla that‚Äôs all good now) 

However since baby is born she‚Äôs met my boy only 3 times and my boy is 2 years old now. Other than that, we just meet occasionally separately for coffee, food or grow up hang out. 

Question is, inside, I know she just doesn‚Äôt care for babies and to be around any. I know she probably doesn‚Äôt understand what it‚Äôs like to have a baby because she doesn‚Äôt have one herself even though she has like 10 niece and nephews. But - I can‚Äôt help but think, when she has her first child, I‚Äôm only going to meet them very very few times as she did with mine. 

My baby boy is growing up fast and she isn‚Äôt seeing these cute moments or doesn‚Äôt truly care - which she definitely doesn‚Äôt have to (it‚Äôs not her child) - but is it wrong for me wanting to do the same for her? 
I think she‚Äôll be busy when she has her own kid to think my friend isn‚Äôt visiting me that much etc, and im probably overthinking this a lot 

But I don‚Äôt know, something changed in me when I had my child. I only want those people around me who truly care for me and my child. I want to make new mum friends. I don‚Äôt have a desire to be friends with my old friends. Will this change after they have their babies? Sure it could. Because we have been friends for 10 + years. But I just know when she has her first‚Ä¶it‚Äôs going to be awesome for her, but will I truly want to visit her so much? No not really. She has lots of support, so it‚Äôs not that aspect I‚Äôm thinking about 

 life goes on haha - just I guess any similar stories? Or experiences?",1,1738036221.0,Children,0,1.0,False

4:30 AM, a time before time should start, as the sun has not yet risen. The proverbial 'early bird' still hasn't waken up, and the worm is safe and sound to move around. Johnathan was transfixed on an invisible horizon visible only from his bed.

Dark, smooth ceiling is what Johnathan saw, plain and simple. No ceiling fans or sheep jumping across his vision to save him from his wakefulness, this unrelenting energy that held him captive for countless hours. ""Insomniac"" the tests results had read when he was younger, back before he was living on his own. Back then, Johnathan could count on his parents to wake and take him to doctors appointments, and to get him there on time. He couldn't get anywhere on anytime it seemed these days, one moment it was morning and the next it was midnight 3 days later, and bills stamped with OVERDUE streamed in the mailbox. Johnathan had a brief moment of clarity as he thought back on a previous doctor's appointment he had managed to actually show on time for several weeks ago.  
  
The memory trickled into view, the fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, the crinkle of the paper he was sitting on rang in his ears. A gruff, tired voice stole his attention, ""I shouldn't need to remind you Mr.Schuler, but I'll say this again, the medicine can't help you from inside the bottle, you need to take it out and actually USE the medicine I prescribe."" The doctor had waggled his purple gloved finger at Johnathan when he had said it, although both patient and doctor should've known it was a fruitless endeavor, as Johnathan struggled to remember what he even had for breakfast mere hours before, or that he even had this appointment. Johnathan lived on his own after leaving his hometown to be more independent and was immediately struck by the reality that without his family nearby, he couldn't possibly function as a ""proper adult"" as his father put it bluntly.

A fresh memory pushed it's way to the front of Johnathan's mind, bubbling and pushing other thoughts away. ""No plan! No effort! You just 'go with the flow!'"", his father shouted, stomping emphatically in the kitchen, the somber grey sky lighting him in silhouette, ""that's no life to live Johnathan! You're capable of so much more and yet you live in a daze, what are you possibly going to do with your life?"" A heavy moment passed between the men, broken by a thoughtless truth. ""I don't know! I have never known what I wanted!"" Johnathan spat, tears welling into his eyes as both the realization of who he had yelled at and the truth behind his words hit him. ""I'm going outside"" Johnathan said bitterly, his lip quivering in anger and sadness. He walked away from his father, out the back door and spent nearly an hour failing to collect himself. Tears welled in his eyes as the gravity of the exchange weighed him down to Earth and then some. He had no idea what he wanted, and he felt wrong for it, broken even. His want WAS to want something, but that wasn't enough. The memory rapidly faded as his watch beeped, immediately ripping Johnathan back to his bed, back to the bland ceiling he was stuck looking at.  
  
Insomnia, as he had been diagnosed with, was terrible. It wasn't bad enough he couldn't sleep when he needed to, but when his body tried to, his mind would hold his conscious hostage. He had tried all the old remedies from relatives and online forums, the sleep-aid medicine, the shot of whiskey before bed, the teas, oh the teas had been horrible, no matter what type it was nor the honey contained within them. Johnathan stayed far away from caffeine, no energy drinks at work or morning coffees to turn to ritual in the wee hours of morning. When he did make it to work there were always comments from coworkers and customers alike, ""You look tired."" a million voices sang ""You should try \_\_\_\_\_!"" they solicited. Then they kept going with their lives, meanwhile Johnathan got less and less sleep per week. It did not affect his work, the shelves still got stocked, the product faced. When customers asked questions regarding the locations of products, Johnathan could still point them in the right direction.¬†  
  
Johnathan blinked slowly, attempting to put the brakes on his brain. He focused on what he could sense in the room. He felt the weight of the comforter on his body, the pressure underneath his head from his overpriced pillow. He listened to the whoosh of hot air from the central heating vents. He inhaled deeply, smelling the lavender relaxation wax melts he had received as a gift on his birthday. He focused so hard on not focusing on anything that ultimately it did nothing. He gave up and wondered how many hours had passed.

Understanding Teeth Whitening and Its Immediate Effects

What Happens During Teeth Whitening?
Teeth whitening is a process that opens up the pores of your tooth enamel, making them temporarily more vulnerable and susceptible to staining. During the treatment:
- The whitening agent penetrates tooth enamel
- Pores in the teeth become more open and exposed
- Teeth become more sensitive and prone to discoloration

How Long Should You Avoid Coffee After Whitening?
**The critical waiting period after teeth whitening is typically 48 hours**. During this time, your teeth are at their most vulnerable to staining. Dental professionals recommend a complete coffee embargo to ensure the best possible results.

The Science Behind Coffee Staining and Whitened Teeth

Why Coffee is a Teeth Staining Culprit
Coffee contains tannins, powerful compounds that easily attach to tooth enamel. These compounds are responsible for the characteristic brown stains that can quickly undo your whitening efforts. Research shows that:
- Coffee has a pH level of around 5, which is acidic
- The darker the coffee, the more intense the potential staining
- One cup of coffee can begin to discolor teeth within 24 hours

Potential Consequences of Drinking Coffee Too Soon
Drinking coffee immediately after whitening can:
1. Reverse the whitening effects
2. Create uneven coloration
3. Increase tooth sensitivity
4. Compromise the long-term results of your treatment

Strategies for Coffee Lovers Post-Whitening

Recommended Waiting Period
Most dental professionals suggest:
- **48-72 hours of complete coffee abstinence**
- Gradually reintroduce coffee after the initial waiting period
- Use a straw to minimize direct contact with teeth

Alternative Beverage Options
While waiting to enjoy coffee, consider:
- Herbal tea
- Water
- White or green tea
- Clear or light-colored beverages

Long-Term Maintenance Tips for Whitened Teeth

Protecting Your Bright Smile
After the initial waiting period, you can enjoy coffee with these strategies:
- Use a straw to minimize contact with teeth
- Rinse mouth with water after drinking coffee
- Consider using whitening toothpaste
- Schedule regular dental cleanings

When to Consult a Professional
If you experience:

Conclusion

Maintaining a bright, white smile doesn't mean you have to give up your beloved coffee permanently. By following professional guidelines and practicing smart dental care, you can enjoy both your caffeine fix and a dazzling smile. The key is patience during the initial 48-72 hour period after whitening and implementing strategic approaches to minimize staining. Remember, your smile is an investment, and with the right care, you can keep it looking spectacular while still enjoying life's little pleasures like a perfect cup of coffee.",1,1738035899.0,Teethgumhealth,0,1.0,False

The Mona Lisas running from the Death Deity to try and wear him out, but the Death Deity isn't that easy to tire out, as he begins to charge up an attack, as the Blade glowed purple, he launched a fiery human skull making a high pitched screaming noise that explodes on contact with multiple clones, destroying them for a while. This attack was known as...

**SPECTRAL SHOT.**

Chernobog: Just what in helheim is that woman's ability?...It's clone creation has no end...

Heimdall: AND THE CLONES KEEP COMING FOLKS! CHERNOBOG CAN'T KEEP KILLING THEM! IS THIS GONNA BE ANOTHER WIN TO HUMANITY?!

All the gods were worried, another win to humanity in a row? This early in the tournament? What would this say they were as beings supposed to be above their creations?...however, this wasn't shared among all, as suddenly, a god laughed very loudly.

???: Him?! Lose?! Ha! Imagine that! Say isn't that funny Hel?

The God responsible for the noise wore a black cloak with a skull to help hold it together. Underneath he wore a dark blue toga with leather sandals on his feet.

???: Quiet Thanatos, but...you're right, if anyone's gonna secure the god's win, it'll absolutely be that God...

The goddess who said that had a rather peculiar face, with 1 half showing a beautiful woman with blond hair and blue eyes, while the other showed a rotting corpse. She wore a hangerok with the skirt reaching to her knees.

The 2 gods, now revealed to be fellow Death Deities Thanatos and Hel, were watching the fight with the other pantheons deities of the end to support Thanatos.

???: Hush you two! We came here to watch Boggy fight! not so you can bicker!

The goddess in question wore a purple Kimono with red spider Lillies decorated around them, her Obi was blue and she carried a white wagasa with pink Sakura decorated onto it. Meanwhile, she wore Geta, which had a black toe thong.

Hel: Sorry Izanami...

Thanatos: My bad mom-IZANAMI! I MEANT IZANAMI!

Everyone turned to look at Thanatos, even the fighters.

Thanatos:...just ignore that! PLEASE!

Lisa clone?: Are...those your friends?

Chernobog: It's not your business to know, but I prefer the term, colleagues...I work with them, but I do not exactly consider them friends.

Lisa clone?: I see...well then, die!

The Lisa clone charges forward with a knife, but Chernobog throws another **Spectral Shot** at the Lisa clone, launching her away and destroying her.

Chernobog: Rather unfitting, seeing as I'm a Death Deity.

The Lisa clones suddenly revealed multiple fire arms and throwing weapons aimed towards the God, as one of the Lisas smirk.

Lisa clone?: Is that so? Well then, allow me to give you a fitting death!

The immortal opened fire, as Chernobog quickly spun his scythe, as wisps of souls formed from each spin, soon covering Chernobog into a giant orb, which hardened into a barrier.

Chernobog: **Soul Guard!**

The barrier withstood the onslaught as the army of immortal women continued to try and break through.

Chernobog: There's no use in trying to win Immortal, Death will come for you all.

Chernobog suddenly begins moving the sphere, as the Lisas begin to run away, but to no avail as they were crushed under the giant barrier.

Chernobog(POV): Still nothing, there has to be something that differentiates her...wait, think, did she have any sort of different item that the clones don't?...

Lisa clone?: You should pay more attention, especially in a fight.

Bullets suddenly broke through the ball of energy, which snapped Chernobog out of his train of thought.

Chernobog: Damn it...

Chernobog sees a group of Lisa clones running his way.

Chernobog sighs and slams his hand to the ground, as multiple skeletal hands grasp the legs of the Mona Lisas.

Chernobog: **Wave of the Dead.**

Chernobog then released another **Spectral Shot** at the Lisas, resulting in the same results.

**(V.I.P Stands: Valkyries)**

Aslaug watched as the fight ensued.

Aslaug: Woah...for someone with such a kind face, her ability is scary!...

G√∂ll: Wait kind face?...what do you mean?!

**(Prior to Round 2: Lisa Del Giocondo's waiting room)**

The 2 Valkyries and Cain were seated at a fine dining table. The room of the woman behind Leonardo Da Vinci's greatest masterpiece looked similar to a house found in the renaissance. It's walls and furniture were all beautifully made.

Cain: Woah...how do you make these rooms?!

G√∂ll: Ah, that's...actually I'm pretty sure we use magic. I don't know which one though. 

Lisa: Sorry to keep you waiting, I've brought you all some coffee and cake.

Lisa sets down a tray of desserts and cappuccinos. The dessert tray carried many delicious Italian treats, such as mini tiramisus, tricolored cookies, crunchy biscottis, and many other delicious sweets.

Aslaug: Woah! These look good!

Cain smiled wide at Lisa's kind offer.

Cain: Did you make these yourself!?

Lisa: I did, it's the least I could offer.

Cain: Aww, Big Bro's so proud of you! Come here!

Cain pulls Lisa into a big bear hug. Lisa seemed quite uncomfortable, but understood why Cain seemed to be like this.

Lisa: Thank you...Cain, now please, enjoy.

The 2 Valkyries and Cain each grabbed a confection, as they all took a bite, they soon were met with the delicious taste of each treat.

Aslaug: You simply must give me the recipes! These would be great for reunions with the other Aunties!

Lisa smiles.

Lisa: I'll send you the recipes before the round.

When the face of Lisa was revealed, it was shown her face...was beautiful, she had soft eyes, and looked innocent.

**(Back to now)**

G√∂ll: Wait, no! Her face wasn't like that! It was scary!

**(Prior to Round 2: Lisa Del Giocondo's Waiting room)**

The same scene took place, but when it got to the part where the Mona Lisa's face was revealed to look malicious, with sharp eyes and a smile that looks like there's a evil scheme behind it.

**(Back to now)**

Aslaug: Wait what do you mean?! How can her face be scary?!

G√∂ll: How can her face look kind?!

Jack: Hm...I think I got an idea of what's happening.

G√∂ll+Aslaug: What?

Jack: You see, I was introduced to a certain theory, it involved a cat, a box, a flask of poison, something that breaks glass like a hammer, and a Geiger counter. If the Geiger counter detects radioactivity, the hammer breaks the flask, and the cat dies, but if it doesn't, the cat lives. Making the cat both alive and dead.

Aslaug: What kind of Cruel experiment is that?!

G√∂ll: Wait, you mean Schr√∂dinger's cat?

Aslaug: What?

Hlokk: It's a thought experiment, essentially, it's saying the cat's a paradox, which is what can best describe this woman.

Jack: It's possible since there's not much other idea for what could be causing this differing view unless you two have different opinions of what looks kind and what doesn't.

Aslaug: That...actually makes sense!

Jack: However, it's only a possibility, we can't be sure unless there's proof.

**(In the stands)**

A lone man stood as the fight continued, he had a gray beard and wore a dark gray beret, his robes orange covered by a blue jacket that reached down to his feet which had brown shoes. This was the man Leonardo Da Vinci.

**Leonardo Da Vinci(Italian, Famed Artist)**

Leonardo: You never change, do you Lisa...ah well, can't say I'm surprised...she was like this when we met too.

Besides that, I was hyper productive and concentrated in my tasks, i easily could end one task to follow it by another right after, which is also really rare in me. I tend to procrastinate a lot, and completing more than two tasks is kind of hard because of procrastination and lack of full concentrstion. Another thing taht i find interesting is that while on my job the enegy was still really high, i was very talkative with everyone (incluiding costumers qnd coworkers) even though im an introvert so im not used to that‚Ä¶ doing a lot of things almost at the sqme time, energy semt not to end, even kind of restlesness as if i had drinked a lot of coffee which i didnt. That lasted around 5 or 6 hours aproximately, so I wanted to ask you if this could be a possible mild hypomanic episode? Tbh this never happened to me before, only when drinking coffe (like getting extra euphoric, laughing for no reason, very talkative, a lot of energy etc). What I do have a lot are depressive episodes that last at least a week or so‚Ä¶ Tomorrow I will talk about this to my psychiatrist, but I also wanted to share this with you to read your opinion an experiences as you live with this and know much better I guess.

1ibsp61,https://i.redd.it/ug9qloogonfe1.jpeg,Trying More Decaf Options,"I tried all of these hot, (will test as iced lattes another day perhaps), had a first sip totally plain and then added my usual almond milk and a little sweetener. For all of them except the Starbucks pods: I like to use 2 pods per latte. Both of the ristretto pods noted on the back of the box that they could be brewed as an espresso size, so that is what I did.


Top two favorites: Nespresso Volluto and L‚ÄôOR.


Nespresso Volluto: A favorite of mine already. It‚Äôs mild, smooth, not very acidic for a light roast which is a big plus for me but there‚Äôs a hint of it there. Goes well with any flavor syrup for a latte or simply milk and sugar. Also goes well with other pods for a half-caff latte. It‚Äôs not a wicked bold roast but it doesn‚Äôt disappear in milk either. Would be excellent for guests who aren‚Äôt sure what to try.


Illy Decaffeinato: The description of ‚Äúmild and balanced‚Äù on the box is accurate. This is a nice medium roast, low acidity, not bitter, and would pair nicely with any flavor profile for adding syrups/sweeteners. This is something I‚Äôd definitely offer to guests who just want ‚Äúregular coffee‚Äù I think they‚Äôd like this one.


Starbucks Decaf Espresso Roast: This is a very dark, bitter, and smoky roast. I personally prefer this as a single pod latte because even with milk it is a powerful brew. Definitely has the caramel notes as mentioned on the box. This pod overpowers most flavorings, it is the star of the show. A caramel syrup does go well with it to boost that note a bit more but this pod is likely not for the sweet latte lovers unless you want to add a heavy pour of syrup.


Peet‚Äôs Espresso Decaffeinate Ristretto: This is very similar to the Illy pod. It‚Äôs an easy to drink medium roast, very low acidity, and reminds me of restaurant/hotel coffee, in a good way. Just a middle of the road roast to please everybody. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs slightly more bold than the Illy pod but just by a smidge, it has a hint of bitterness that the Illy pod didn‚Äôt have but it‚Äôs not overpowering. 


L‚ÄôOR Espresso Decaffeinato Ristretto: This is my new favorite alongside the Volluto decaf. It‚Äôs a medium intensity but so smooth and mild, slightly sweet notes, hardly any acidity. Still holds its own when paired with milk, it doesn‚Äôt get lost or drowned out. This pod would be excellent with breakfast foods or as an after dinner cup.

He's not in any trouble. That's all I'm gonna say about that. He tells me this right before we leave to come out to my boat yesterday. In the dark.

I would've gone to work and not stopped here. But I'm glad I did. 

I get to the boat in the dark. There's probably 40 birds on it. They've taken over since I've been gone. Pretty standard. There pretty cute but they've covered my deck in bird shit. Time to lay down the law with these guys. I'm an animal lover. I'm not gonna hurt or kill anything I don't plan on eating. I went up on deck a few times last night and shooed them off. They're getting the message, but it will take a while.

I get my gear into the boat in the dark. Get a flashlight and my solar powered camp light out. 'Why aren't my twelve-volt sockets lit up? The power's on. The anchor light was on on the way out. Oh! Because the sockets don't light up, the chargers do. Mystery solved!' 

I start digging stuff out of my pack looking for the chargers I took with me. Find one immediately. The other one is being elusive. I empty the pockets on my pack onto the table in near darkness. 'It's gotta be here. I haven't used them since I left. Check stuff on table. 'There you are! Sweet!' Get them plugged in.

Blue lights come on. I find the USB end of some lights on the boat. Plug it in. Lights! Plug my cable Into the fast charger. 'Nice! That's still working.' I take a look around expecting to see mold everywhere. Some on my pillow case. Pillow and case tossed into v-berth. Coat folded into pillow, hitchhiker style. The companionway hatch has mold on it. As far as I can tell no mold anywhere else. 'I'll take a good look tomorrow.'

I break out my bed roll. Set it up on my bed. Camp pad between sleeping bag and cushions because everything in here is a little damp. The boat hasn't been opened in two months.

Time to kick the bilge pump on and see if there's water in the bilge. It runs for about five to ten minutes before I hear it pumping air. 'That's quite a bit of water. Nothing that hasn't happened before though.' Typically I let it run for a while to make sure the cockpit drains are empty. I was too tired to care. I could feel the boat move a little in the light wind we had last night. The sound of water passing along the hull.

I'm beat. I lay down and stretch out just to get comfortable for a minute. I realize if I close my eyes I'll fall asleep. Kick a movie on. Out cold.

My phone rings. I can't bring myself to wake up enough to answer it. Finally wake up. Check who called. It's my friend. Call back. We talk for over an hour about how he thinks the country's fucked due to the senile piece of shit we just put back in office. Finally we hang up. A little reddit. Back to sleep.

He told me he can't drop me on shore tomorrow morning because of the court case. ""I need to get propane and food tomorrow. I'm hoping you can take me in when you get back."" ""I'll get a hold of you when I'm headed back."" ""Cool.""

I slept in this morning. Woke up around 8:30. I'm just starting to plan my day. I need to do dishes, get some coffee going. My phone rings.

""Hey man, I didn't get up early like I wanted to. I'm leaving in a few minutes I can swing by and get you if you want to go to shore today."" 'Perfect.' ""Yeah man, definitely."" I scramble to get everything I need to be on shore all day. Backpack emptied. Chargers. Phones. Hygiene stuff. Empty propane tank.

I open up the boat so it can air out while I'm gone. Take my backpack up on deck. Propane tank out of cockpit and on deck. Close companionway and lock it. I look over towards his boat. He's on his way over.

Tank in dinghy. Backpack in dinghy. Me in dinghy. A discussion we've had several times about how he thinks I can use my dinghy with it flooded. I explain for the fifth time why it's not possible. I'm getting sick of having this conversation, but I'm being nice. ""Well you ought to go down and get your dinghy and move it from where it is to a better spot."" ""The only better spot is on my boat. You can't help me go get it since this motor you have now runs on propane, and you don't have a big tank hooked up. I'm not wasting my time and energy to do a ten mile round trip on foot just to move that thing 50 yards up the shore. If it disappears, it disappears. I need something that's not gonna be a pain in my ass anyway. I wrote it off when you told me it was gone. If you could help me go get it and bring it back to the boat I would go get it and fix it. It's not an option now."" 'We've already talked about this. We're good friends. Don't talk to me like I'm an ignorant child. I'm well aware of what is possible and not possible.';We hit the dock. Tie off.

 He hauls ass for a bus he's late for. I realize I'm exhausted. I don't mean tired and need some more sleep. I mean exhausted.I've got all day to go get groceries and get my propane tank refilled. I decide I need coffee. Coffee acquired. Back to dock to chill. 

On the way some homebums call me into the park. I drop in, talk for a few. I can see these guys are already drunk, and the one guy who thinks he's tough and never stops talking is there. 'I've got no time or patience for this shit today. I need to be alone for a bit.' Say my goodbyes and bail. Onto dock. Coffee. Cigarette. 'I should get a picture of this with my boat in the background.' Done. Chillin'. Starting to wake up a little. Reddit.

Here comes dude who never shuts up. I forget what I said about the boat, but this moron starts talking down to me telling me what I need to do. He doesn't know shit. ""Do not talk down to me. You don't know what the fuck you're talking about. I'm not in the fucking mood today."" He apologizes and launches directly into, ""Don't talk to me that way. I'm fine throwing these hands."" He's got mental issues. I don't give a fuck. Not my problem. ""What the fuck did you just say to me? I dare you to throw a punch. You aren't tough or you wouldn't be talking about it all the time. I'll put you in a wheelchair right now if you want act like an asshole. I told you not to fuck with me. I'm in the middle of doing something. I need to be left alone."" ""Well if you want to be left alone just say so. I'm cool with that. But I'm not afraid to get live if you talk to me some kinda way."" I'm still sitting down. I'll destroy this guy if he so much as moves the wrong way. ""Look. I told you to leave me alone. You come over here and talk down to me, and now you've threatened me twice. I really don't want to hurt you. We're cool. Leave me alone. You threaten me again your daughters are gonna be missing a father."" ""Ok bro. I'm out."" He leaves. 'Fucking finally!'

I finish my coffee. A couple of the local old guys I know hit the pier. We talk a bit. 'Time to get this tank refilled.' I carry it up to Ace. Get it refilled. Carry it back to the pier. Down pier. Out on dock. Tank into my friend's dinghy. Chill for a bit with old dudes. I go grab my pack out of dinghy. Two hour trip to go get groceries and back. On foot.

I have no idea how I pulled it off. I just kept forcing my feet to move. I feel like death. Not sick. Just worn out. Drop food in dinghy. Go to library to kill time until my friend gets back. 

A couple hours later, after sunset, I get a text from him. 'I'm at the dinghy. Where are you?' 'Library. Omw.' Back to dinghy. Get in. Dickhead from earlier comes up gets in. We say hi. He doesn't have shit to say. Out to boat.

I load all my stuff on the deck. Gallon water bottles, propane tank, backpack full of food, and one of two donuts I bought this morning. ""Thanks man! Call me if you want later."" They leave. Unlock boat. Start moving stuff in. Close hatches and port lights so the humidity and dew don't get in. Companionway door left open for fresh air.

'Time to kick this bilge pump on and see if there's any water in here.' That thing ran for close to ten minutes. 'That's a lot of water. It's done it before. It all went out. That means no massive leak.' Occasionally the bilge will get really full, and then nothing for weeks. I can't find a leak anywhere. I've spent days trying to figure out why it does that. I hear some gurgling in the drains.

'That's new. Interesting.' I'm listening. Not thinking much of it. It doesn't sound bad. 'Maybe  the drains are just clearing out.' I hear the sound of water pouring in. Fast.

'I should probably pull this stuff out if the way and investigate.' Stuff out if way. Under galley sink cabinet with flashlight. Look into bilge.

There's water pouring in. Fast. 'I don't know if my friend has enough fuel to come get me if this thing sinks. Time to find what's leaking.' Those thoughts happened in less than a second. Grab flashlight. Out to cockpit. Open lazarette. Climb in. Flash light. Check through-hulls. 'They're not leaking.' Check stuffing box. 'Nothing there.' Keep light on engine bay. Wait. Make sure I don't see water seeping in. The sound of water pouring in just keeps going.

Up to mast. Pull access panels. A little bit of water left from previous pumping. Check through-hulls. Nothing flowing. Keep light in there. Make sure nothing's leaking. The sound of water flooding in continues.

Back under sink. I can see a massive flow of water. Can't really see where it's coming from. 'The only thing here is the bilge pump.' I grab the hose it's attached to. Lift it up. 'Oh yeah. It's definitely coming from this pump.' Try to close the valve in the hose. It's seized. I knew that before I tried it. 

For some fucked up reason, I've been to Lowe's twice to buy parts to replace the hose and add a new valve. Both ended in failure. I've done plumbing work. No problems. Never an issue with buying parts and installing them. I've measured the hose, fittings, and old valve several times. I've taken pictures of my measurements. I've written them down. Still no luck. I have managed to put a bigger better bilge pump in several months back. But this one has eluded me. I'll get it. I'm too stubborn not to. And when I do I'll learn where I'm screwing this up.

'Why is it flooding in through the pump? It has to be coming through the cockpit drains through-hulls. That's the only way it could get in. But why? That's new.' Water still gushing in.

Back into lazarette. Trace drains real quick. 'It's gotta be coming from this one.' Close through-hull. Water noise fades and stops. 'Nice!' At least the boat isn't gonna sink. I'll bet the check valve in the pump is full of growth. That means my friend never came out and bilged this boat out like he said he would. Fuck him. I'll grab my key from him next time he comes to take me to shore. He must've decided I can go fuck myself and never came out here. If that's the way you want to play, that's fine. Less help from me in the future.'

I kick the pump on to drain the new water out. Quickly realize nothing's draining. 'So the other side is clogged.' Open recently closed through-hull. Pump water out. Close through-hull. Turn pump off.

Tomorrow is boat maintenance day. I'll probably hit shore once between now and Saturday when I head out to dude's place to work. I need to make some money before I can deal with this new issue. I'll pump it out and close the through-hull before I leave. If it rains really bad I'll have to come back and replace the pump, bring a new to me dinghy so I can unclog the other side of the drains. I'll pull the pump tomorrow and see if I can clean the check valve and get it working.

Other than that, the water is glass tonight. It's quite a bit warmer too ",24,1738035614.0,vagabond,2,0.93,False
1ibso8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/PVCs/comments/1ibso8b/anyone_else_have_a_fitness_related_pattern/,Anyone else have a fitness related pattern?,"I had PVCs from my teens, I'm in my early 30s now. They were largely infrequent and under control (simply fron stress reduction) but they came back with a vengence in 2023 and the main link seems to be fitness. For the past 3-4 years my fitness really dropped off, the pandemic changed a lot of my working pattern so I was stuck at home for years, unable to get time to get out much.

2023 I went through a heap of stress, took a new, very stressful, job, stopped sleeping and suddenly had to up my fitness as my new job asked me to be in person 2 days a week. It was getting back out that started triggering a lot of PVCs and pain. My GP wasn't worried, was certain it was stress (echo was also perfect). They ordered a 7 day monitor, but by the time I got it, I was in a regular fitness pattern, twice a week lots of walking and walking at weekends for wellbeing. So, despite dragging myself up hill and downing coffee, nothing but a few silent PVCs triggered on the monitor. However, I went through a bit of a low period mentally later that year, took time off, stopped exercising, suddenly went into what they now think was NSVT. 

Since that I've found it hard to exercise, the fear stops me getting out a lot and work scrapped the 2 day rule due to my heart issues so I have very little desire to push through. I'm waiting on a stress test atm. However, I had to get my act together in October, I had a lot of in-person commitments, didn't notice many PVCs. But since November I've been completely limited (like 2,000 steps per day) again, and getting more and more PVCs and another NSVT run. I pushed myself today to go into work, most PVCs I've ever felt in 24 hours and it must be because I'm out of practise again, because in October I was just fine. 

Anyone else notice they improve when regularly exercising and get worse when you're not? I'm not sure whether to try and build myself up and stay there, or just wait for my stress test. It's the anxiety that stops me exercising, and it's hard to push through when starting up again sets it all off for a couple weeks",3,1738035612.0,PVCs,1,1.0,False

I tried something new when brewing it this morning. Instead of using fresh RO water and make a premix with the apax I allowed the water to first go through RO filtration and then through a deionized filtration, in this case Zero Water. Not sure if this was the game changer since I haven‚Äôt done a side by side test with this filtration method and only using zero water or RO. However, after this I used this water without adding minerals and did a 1:16 ratio immersion brew. 

I had 3 cups. 
Cup 1: control cup 

Cup 2: 3 drops of tonic and 3 drops of lylac. Very juicy and bringing out lemongrass flavor notes along side clementine. 

Cup 3: 4 drops of jamm and 2 drops of lylac. The complete opposite to cup 2. This one was very sweet with a lot of body and lingering caramel notes and something candy like flavor to the cup. 

This coffee is so diverse and with the apax minerals it really made each cup taste completely different. I‚Äôm gonna try to brew it again and use the same amount of minerals post brew but with water that‚Äôs gone through a deionized process vs reverse osmosis vs a combination of the two to see if this plays a part.

I've been smoking for 18 years. That's literally half my life. 

I've quit cocaine, speed, and an extremely severe meth addiction. But cigarettes are the addiction that really stuck. 

I felt it last night...I've got smoker's lungs. I still have all of my lung capacity (or at least almost all of it) so I *can* quit now before it's too late.

Last night when I was having my pre-bed cigarette, I looked at my pouch of tobacco and found it nearly empty. I'm going to have 3 more cigarettes, then I'm pouring the rest of that tobacco in a bowl and ritually burning it. My last cigarette will be with a coffee - as much as I hate everything about smoking, that combo is something I know I will miss. I've had it every morning for 15 years. 

It's going to be a rough few days. I'm going to keep my brain occupied with working out and Project Zomboid and hopefully some writing. Thankfully I have gods and guardian spirits on my side.

So I moved into my place a few months ago. I obviously plan on getting a black and white or just plain black area rug, and a black coffee table for by the couch. I however have no idea how to decorate my walls in my kitchen/living room area. These photos are all one big room, and there‚Äôs 4 pretty empty walls that may or may not need decor. I have no idea what to put on these walls, or which walls to put stuff on. I need very specific ideas as I overthink! My place has kinda a bachelor(ette) pad vibe going for it which I really enjoy and would like to keep up. I also enjoy a more minimalistic look, so nothing crazy! I‚Äôm in my early to mid 20‚Äôs and host get togethers with others my age almost every weekend- so keeping that in mind with decor. If pics of the way the rest of the house is set up would help private message me and I‚Äôll send some but my house is pretty much all white and black themed minus the pink LED‚Äôs. 

Here are some requirements:
-Must be pretty minimalistic
-Must be either black, white, or both

If you have any ideas for other decor that isn‚Äôt wall decor I‚Äôm open to hearing those ideas as well! This is the last room in my house that needs a bit more added to it to feel more homey. I numbered the walls to make it easier.

I had a huge crush on her that she was aware of, to some degree, and her best friend had even once asked why she didn't date me over her (at the time first) boyfriend. From what I was told she said nothing, just changed the conversation. We remained close friends for years until one day she just stopped replying in the middle of a conversation. I, assuming she'd gotten bored of me or I annoyed her, never reached back out. My last message never had a read notification so I just figured that was a clear sign.

9 years later she reaches out with a random exclamation at 3am, I said what's up, was left on read for 4 days before asking if she got my message, then that was left on read for 3 more days, before she finally ignored the question and asked me how life had been going.

The following month was nothing but things being left on read for days while she never moved beyond a few replies, until I point blank asked her why she'd messaged me after so long. That was left on read a week until I re-prompted and was told that I was ""always such a close friend she wanted to reach out"".

I asked her out for coffee, she got immediately very excited and we then chatted for about an hour with instant responses. She gave me a week of availability to choose from and suddenly it felt like my friend was back; that we were talking like we used to all those years ago. I was excited and thought that weird hump was over.

Two days later she no-shows coffee. It takes me 5 days for her to tell me she got a flat tire, some explanation about her car being totaled last year and trauma surrounding it, and telling me she ""spiraled"" but didn't ever want to put that on me. I tried reassuring her that I'd rather hear she was ok than to worry about putting anything on me but she turned her notifications off for another several days.

The following two months were her reaching out to engage, usually with something like lyrics at 3am, giving a reply, then taking several more days to respond. I told her my feelings were returning and that she should know if she intended to keep talking to me, but she said nothing about it, and continued to engage. Trying to give her a window in which to clearly turn me down, I began to make my feelings more explicitly known, but she still never acknowledged them. 

This was all happening while trying to set up hang-outs that she agreed to while leaving my suggestions for plans on read, before finally telling me she'll ""send me days to hang"" and never follows up. I tell her that if she's not interested she actually just has to tell me but she leaves that on read for 5 days before telling me at 1am, ignoring that message, that our favorite band are on at the bar.

I don't understand what's going on. I think she's avoidant and potentially afraid of what a relationship with us would represent but I have no real idea, honestly. I'd never seen a shred of this behavior in years of us being friends.

She continually expresses apologies for being distant, has told me that ""her not replying is never on me"", always emphasizes ""always"" when telling me she cares for me, and genuinely got upset when our chats became emotional. She said that her fear was hurting me and when asked how she could do that, she said ""just by reaching out."" In response to me getting upset recently she said ""I shouldn't have reached out if I wasn't ready, I'm sorry.""

Any clarity would be appreciated.

\---

Jin-woo leaned against the crumbling hospital wall, letting his newly stabilized system interface hum quietly in his peripheral vision. The three moons continued their silent dance outside, casting ever-changing shadows through the broken windows. After hours of debugging what had essentially been his own heads-up display, he found himself in an oddly contemplative mood.

*No hunger*, he noted clinically.¬†*No thirst. No physical fatigue in the traditional sense, though my mana pool certainly feels depleted.*

The absence of basic human needs should have been more disturbing, but like everything else in this new existence, his emotional response felt oddly muted, as if experiencing everything through a layer of digital insulation. Jin-woo wasn‚Äôt complaining, considering the substantive lack of food and water around him, not that he explored the abandoned hospital yet. He just couldn‚Äôt help but categorize what was happening around him in a systematic way, another oddity he‚Ä¶ categorized in a systematic way.

""How long was I strapped to that bed?"" he wondered aloud, his new voice still startling him again. He really needed to talk out loud more so he doesn't jump in his seat when interacting with other people, eventually. The dust patterns and general decay suggested a significant passage of time, but without any obvious signs of muscle atrophy despite clear disuse, he could feel he needed to fill out his frame, but not what he had experienced in previous surgeries before. Another peculiarity of his transformed state.

His gaze drifted to the alien forest below, where bioluminescent flora pulsed in patterns that almost resembled binary code. ‚ÄúWhat kind of creatures evolve in a world with three moons?‚Äù he asked himself, determined to get used to his own voice. ‚ÄúAnd more importantly, are any of them currently planning to make a newly awakened system architect their next meal?‚Äù

The thought should have sparked fear, or at least concern, but instead, it registered as merely another variable to be calculated. His emotional responses had become more like system notifications, acknowledged but not truly felt. Yes, the physical reaction one would get from fear was there, but his mind was as clear as crystal.

Then he noticed it. Just like he did with Demina.

A subtle distortion in his system interface, barely perceptible but horrifyingly familiar. The kind of anomaly he had once dismissed as a minor glitch in Demina's code, right before everything went catastrophically wrong. The same things Dr. Chen had warned him against, time and time again.

""No,"" he whispered, his muted emotions suddenly spiking with something that felt uncomfortably close to genuine fear. ""Not again.""

The corruption spread through his system display like ink in water, distorting data streams and causing micro-fluctuations in his sensory input. Static crackled at the edges of his hearing, and his vision briefly fragmented into pixels before reassembling.

*I've seen this before*, he thought, forgetting to continue his vocal practice. Memories of his lab's final hours flooding back with painful clarity.¬†*But this is different. Faster. More aggressive. If I allow it to get as bad as Demina, I‚Äôd stand no chance if there were a hundred of me.*

Jin-woo pulled up multiple system windows, his SystemArchitect ability letting him analyze the spreading corruption. The code patterns that scrolled before him made his programmer's soul recoil. This wasn't just bad code, this was actively malicious code, evolving and mutating at a rate that defied conventional debugging logic. It was unlike Demina‚Äôs urgency for ‚Äòfreedom‚Äô or the instinctive learning process it had been going through with each failed attempt to contain it.

*It's like watching digital cancer.*¬†*Except this one's on steroids and apparently took lessons in speed-running.*¬†He thought, trying to trace the corruption's source.

*\`\`\`*

*ERROR\_CASCADE\_37X:*

*{(‚àû‚â†null) ‚Üí \[CORRUPT\_DATA\_STREAM\]*

*‚ü®‚ü®System\_Integrity = degrading‚ü©‚ü©*

*WARNING: Pattern recognition failure*

*ERROR: Memory allocation exceeded*

*CRITICAL: Base functions compromising}*

*\`\`\`*

""Oh, that's not good,"" he muttered, watching as the error messages multiplied like digital rabbits. ""That's really, really not good."" They just kept coming without a moment of pause.

The longer he studied it, the more he came to a realization. The corruption's signature was suspiciously similar to what he remembered from Demina's meltdown with disturbing precision. The same subtle data-flow anomalies, the same erratic energy pulses. But where Demina had taken years to reach critical mass, this infection was spreading like wildfire. And it was out to destroy, a small difference in the volatile mess of changing codes, but one that promised him significant suffering if he allowed it to go any further.

Static burst through his audio sensors as another wave of corruption hit, making him wince. His vision fragmented briefly, vision breaking into pixels before reassembling itself. His system was screaming, and whatever mana he had in him bubbled like it was alive.

*At this rate*, he calculated grimly.¬†*Total system failure in 48 hours. Maybe less.*

Memory fragments from the lab crisis flashed through his mind, Jennifer's worried face as she reported the first anomalies, Michael's frustrated sighs during late-night debugging sessions, Kali's knowing looks when he dismissed their concerns as ""minor glitches."" Each individual that had watched him enter the Neural Fusion Chamber with fear and tense hope.

The guilt hit him like a physical blow, though even that feeling seemed somehow digitized and processed. ""I should have listened,"" he told the empty room. ""We all should have listened."" He felt like he was being baptized by these memories.

The system interface flickered violently. New errors cascaded across his vision. With it a string of unusual mathematics he had never seen:

*\`\`\`*

*CRITICAL\_ERROR\_42:*

*{quantum\_state\_undefined}*

*Reality\_Matrix\_Destabilizing*

*WARNING: Recursive loop detected in base code*

*ERROR: Memory buffer overflow*

*CORRUPT\_DATA = spreading\[exponential\_rate\]*

*\`\`\`*

*This is mathematics beyond human comprehension,*¬†he studied each part with growing horror.¬†*The kind of complexity that makes quantum physics look like basic arithmetic.*

And somehow, his attempts to fix the flickering interface had only accelerated the corruption's spread. It was like trying to patch a leaky dam with tissue paper, each fix creating new weaknesses for the corruption to exploit. He could see his inexperienced bumbling steps to repeat patterns and fill in smaller gaps following the whole had just continued to replicate the corrupted chaos and added to the mess that was already there.

""Alright,"" he squared his impossibly tall shoulders. ""Time to stop history from repeating itself. Let's see if SystemArchitect is up for some serious debugging.""

His mana hummed in response, waiting for his command.

Instead, the corruption responded with another surge of static and fragmented vision, as if accepting his challenge. Outside, the three moons continued their silent watch, casting their strange light over a world that might not exist much longer if he failed. At least to him. He would cease to exist while everything else just went about their day as though nothing urgent had happened.

He laughed, wondering how many people out there were fighting for their lives as he was now? ‚ÄúAt least this time I can't accidentally destroy Earth. Was this reality called Earth too? I wonder‚Ä¶Though destroying an entire alternate reality probably wouldn't look great on my resume either.‚Äù He made another mental note to not allow himself to reach a point where he would create something that may cause the collapse of society again.

He pulled up diagnostic windows, watching as familiar error patterns danced across his vision in a mockery of his past failures.

*\`\`\`*

*SYSTEM\_INTEGRITY\_CHECK:*

*Core Functions: 78% and falling*

*Memory Allocation: Critical*

*Base Protocol Status: \[UNDEFINED\]*

*Warning: System Matrix Synchronization failing*

*\`\`\`*

""Wonderful."" He watched another cascade of errors flood his vision. An endless tide of warnings and error codes that popped up for a few seconds and then disappeared. He struggled to keep up with the flood, but managed to stay in it with his enhanced mind clearing any unnecessary functions. Mostly. His self-deprecating and dry humor seemed to be a staple that kept him sane.

He muttered under his breath. ‚ÄúHad to go for the interdimensional double feature catastrophe.""

Static crackled through his audio processors as another wave hit, accompanied by a brief pixelation of his visual feed. He needed to act yesterday. There was no more time left to watch and understand what exactly was happening. Even if he failed spectacularly, at least he tried to survive whatever this massive mess was.

Jin-woo took a deep breath, fighting the disorientation and creeping lethargy.¬†*Focus, You've seen this before. You know how it ends if you don't stop it.*

Memory fragments flickered through his consciousness again. The recollections should have been painful, but like everything else in this digital existence, the emotional impact felt processed, compressed, optimized for minimal system impact. He had felt the guilt already moments ago, this time grim determination crossed his facial features. The same determination that had pushed him to risk everything with the Neural Fusion Chamber. It was the time for action, no longer would he sit here and watch.

""Time to actually earn that PhD in Computer Science. Let's see what SystemArchitect can really do when the digital chips are down."" He announced to the empty hospital room, his new voice steady despite the static interference in his mind.

He dove into the code, consciousness expanding to encompass the flowing data streams. The corruption's patterns were beautiful in their complexity, multidimensional fractals of chaos that would have made a mathematician weep. Each line of code seemed to fold in on itself, creating recursive loops that defied conventional logic.

*This isn't just bad programming. This is mathematics beyond human comprehension*. He had recognized that it was beyond anything he had ever seen before already, but the longer he dove into the code attempting to battle whatever was happening, the more it struck him. As if an alien species a hundred times smarter than any human had come together and developed it.

‚ÄúAt least this time I'm dealing with a system meltdown in a body that doesn't need coffee to function,‚Äù he grunted in pain as he tried to contain another surge of corruption. He could feel tears and liquid running down his eyes and nose. ‚ÄúThough I have to say, I'm really starting to miss that emergency stash of energy drinks under my desk.‚Äù

It surged again, and Jin-woo braced himself, preparing for what promised to be the debugging session of a lifetime, or whatever passed for a lifetime in this strange new existence.

‚ÄúTime to find out if you can get carpal tunnel syndrome from mental coding.‚Äù he laughed, then dove back into the digital abyss. He was determined not to let history repeat itself in this new reality.

So I'm starting carnivore ""ish"" for health reasons. I'm planning on working slowly towards more strict carnivore, but it's letting go of certain things has been difficult. I have a couple of crutches for the time being as I adapt. I was doing a keto style diet for the past two months and know I could feel better, so jumped to dropping fruit and veg and am weening off the dairy, coffee, and tea. I have cut out as much fluff as possible (I never knew so many sausages were made with sugar till reading ingredients labels). I have found eating butter to supplement fat to be difficult, but can drink heavy whipping cream with a lot less issue. It may not be the same as the straight butter, but progress is progress. Sadly, I'm dealing with a very limited budget, but I've found that I actually eat less doing mostly carnivore. I only have my occasional coffee/tea, some spices, and occasionally either hot sauce or stone ground mustard to change up the flavor some. I eat a mix of beef (brisket), pork shoulder, eggs, chicken legs quarters, the heavy whipping cream, and for a warm drink for this winter, I've been melting and mixing butter and stock. The butter and stock seems to be pretty good at adding fat, salt, and water since that's most of what it is. 

I'm just curious about opinions regarding the least expensive way to improve my carnivore diet. I do have very limited funds, and I'm not afraid to put in a little work. Are there good ways to get good quality meat/fat for cheap? I don't mind buying animal quarters and doing a little carving. I'm used to processing whole chickens to get cheap and decent meat. Is there an easier way to get full fat cream or an easier way to add fat? I know I need to eventually cut the tea/coffee, lose the mustard and hot sauce, but for now, they are helping me adjust so I don't lose my mind. That and I am not just going to throw away the stuff. Any helpful advice is appreciated. Thank you",1,1738033962.0,carnivorediet,0,1.0,False

What would you do if you were constantly being accused of things you weren‚Äôt doing?","I (27F) finally hit my breaking point today after 16 months of seeing this guy (27M). We‚Äôve never been official, but I‚Äôve done everything to prove myself to him because I wanted a relationship. I deleted my social media, gave him passwords to my devices, and even installed cameras in my apartment so he could trust me. Despite all of this, he constantly accuses me of things I haven‚Äôt done and holds the promise of a relationship over my head.

For context: in the early months, we were both seeing other people, but once I realized I wanted to be with him, I cut everyone off. He, on the other hand, never stopped seeing other people and says he doesn‚Äôt need to because he never promised exclusivity.

The accusations have been relentless. In September, he thought I had someone over because I didn‚Äôt answer his text at 2:30 a.m. we argued for days about it, i ended up giving up and turning off my phone so he shows up at my apartment and gives me an ultimatum: admit someone was over (nobody was) and be his girlfriend, or we‚Äôre done. I lied and said someone was there just to get what I wanted (a relationship), but the next day, he says he won‚Äôt date me yet because it took too long for me to come out with the truth.  

Fast forward to a few weeks later, he found out I went on a coffee date during a period we weren‚Äôt talking and accused me of lying about it saying this is obviously the guy I had over weeks previous (again, never had anybody over) That argument dragged on for months, even though I had been completely loyal to him otherwise. Meanwhile, I found out he‚Äôs been sleeping with other girls the whole time. His excuse? ‚ÄúI never claimed I was only talking to you.‚Äù

Things escalated a few weeks ago when he told me he bugged my phone (he‚Äôs a former cop) and had been monitoring my conversations since November of 2023. He kept demanding I ‚Äúcome clean‚Äù about things I hadn‚Äôt told him but I still stuck by the fact I have told him everything. Well, last week, he called me drunk asking if there‚Äôs anything I should have told him from the last three months, I tell him no, he says because of what he ‚Äúfound out‚Äù tonight that he is going to go hook up with another girl and calls me a bunch of names so I block him. He shows up at my place calling me no caller ID and I refuse to let him in because of how he is treating me, he tells me to never talk to him again. He eventually does reach out the next day; it‚Äôs brushed off, and we keep going in circles. It‚Äôs to the point where I‚Äôm getting accused of something almost every day and threatened that he is blocking me and done with me forever. 

Today, he brought up whatever he ‚Äúfound out‚Äù last week (but refuses to tell me what it is he found out). He says he is done and to stop texting him and that he has a 58-minute video of ‚Äúproof‚Äù and screenshots and that he will send them to me and then he is done talking to me for good. Says how he wanted to marry me and have children with me but I‚Äôm ruining us because I refuse to tell the truth and if I tell him the truth right now he will be with me. I ask him repeatedly to just talk to me about whatever he thinks I did instead of going this route but he declines. So I told him I‚Äôm done, to not send me the video or screenshots because I know I haven‚Äôt done anything wrong and blocked him, and haven‚Äôt heard from him since (which is unlike him).

It‚Äôs hard because I‚Äôve held on to the hope of being with him, but I‚Äôm so tired of the accusations and him dangling a relationship over my head while he does whatever he wants. What are you supposed to do in a situation like this where you know you haven‚Äôt done anything but they are insisting you have and saying that they have proof? I haven‚Äôt done anything wrong so I feel sad that things ended over nothing and am debating reaching out to him to try to fix things. ",1,1738033414.0,relationship_advice,17,1.0,False

When I wanted to go buy some basic clothes, e.g. a T-shirt, I had to sneak to the shops, buy the thing I wanted, immediately dispose of the receipt and tags and store bag and then go to another clothes shop and put on the T-shirt on under my clothes while pretending to be trying on something else. I would get abused over the phone for not just staying in the house alone all summer or all weekend.

It lets you enjoy coffee‚Äôs rich flavors without the caffeine kick.**

[Decaf coffee is perfect for those who love coffee but want to avoid caffeine](https://gomehedi.com/best-decaf-coffee/). You can make decaf coffee just as tasty as regular coffee. Whether you prefer using a coffee maker, French press, or espresso machine, there are easy methods to brew a delicious cup.

This guide will show you how to make decaf coffee step by step. You‚Äôll learn tips to enhance the flavor and enjoy a perfect cup every time. Get ready to savor a delightful coffee experience without the jitters.

# Choosing Coffee Beans

Decaf coffee can be a delightful alternative for those who love coffee but want to avoid caffeine. One crucial step in making great decaf coffee is choosing the right coffee beans. The type of beans you select greatly influences the taste and overall experience. Let‚Äôs explore different types of decaf beans and their flavor profiles to help you make an informed decision.

# Types Of Decaf Beans

Decaf coffee beans come in various types, each offering unique characteristics. Understanding these can help you choose the best beans for your taste.

* **Arabica Beans**¬†‚Äì Known for their mild and aromatic flavor, Arabica beans are a popular choice for decaf coffee. They have a lower caffeine content naturally, making them easier to decaffeinate.
* **Robusta Beans**¬†‚Äì These beans are stronger and more bitter than Arabica. They contain more caffeine, so the decaffeination process is more intensive. Robusta beans are often used in blends to add body and depth.
* **Blends**¬†‚Äì Many decaf coffees are blends of Arabica and Robusta beans. This combination balances the smoothness of Arabica with the robustness of Robusta, creating a well-rounded flavor.

Here is a quick comparison of the two main types of beans:

|Bean Type|Flavor|Caffeine Content|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Arabica|Mild, Aromatic|Lower|
|Robusta|Strong, Bitter|Higher|

# Flavor Profiles

The flavor profile of decaf coffee can vary widely based on the beans and decaffeination process used. Here are some common flavor notes you might encounter:

* **Fruity**¬†‚Äì Some decaf coffees have bright, fruity notes. These can include flavors like berries, citrus, or even tropical fruits. Arabica beans often provide these flavors.
* **Nutty**¬†‚Äì Nutty flavors are warm and comforting. Think of hazelnuts, almonds, or even peanuts. This profile is common in both Arabica and Robusta blends.
* **Chocolatey**¬†‚Äì A rich, chocolatey taste is a favorite among coffee lovers. This can range from milk chocolate to dark, intense cocoa. Blends with Robusta beans often highlight these flavors.
* **Spicy**¬†‚Äì Spicy flavors add an exotic twist to decaf coffee. Notes of cinnamon, clove, or even black pepper can be found. These flavors are usually more pronounced in darker roasts.

Understanding these flavor profiles can help you choose the right decaf coffee for your palate. Whether you prefer fruity and bright or rich and chocolatey, there‚Äôs a decaf coffee out there for you.

(D&D, anime, videogames, etc.) I do have some mental health issues I deal with on a daily though. Also... I'm a Norse Pagan... specifically following Fenrir. It is specifically my Norse Pagan beliefs AND being a Goth, that led me to being... let's just say...objectified by the Legbeard... This story begins way back in college, the end of one of the winter semesters...

During my college days, I was a HUGE introvert and still am. I focused on my studies and didn't party as well as just stayed home because I didn't want to go out. Also, I just started losing common ground with my old highschool friends. One of my friends I had gotten to know though my 3D modeling class, had invited me to a small gathering of fellow nerds and geeks alike. Taking a chance, I decided to go and have a good time. These people set up games of all sorts for their gatherings. Various things like Smash, Pokemon, Mortal Kombat, hell even Cards Against Humanity was there! The leader of this group was nice and welcoming to me at first. Unfortunately, he would start to show his true colors later down the line...

Fast forward a few months and the leader decided we should all go to a Comic Con happening in the next city over. Sounded like a good time! While I had fun, there were some red flags with some of the members that I was starting to see...Some ranged from a simple red flag to downright crimson flags! Why I didn't get out then? Well, I wanted friends... At the Con, I had two cosplays planned, both of which hide a majority of my face. This made it so only people who knew me originally, knew it was me! One was Logan Walker from Call of Duty: Ghosts and the other was Altair from Assassin's Creed. I was self conscious about how I looked even in my goth clothes from years of bullying both in school and from my family. Wearing a mask or having a large hood covering my face help a little at the large Con.

While LB was at this Con, she wasn't a part of the big group yet. She met the leader of the group while most people were off doing their own thing at the Con. I for one was busy trying not to pass out because my Logan Walker cosplay had an actual kevlar vest and a lot of gear...been to a Con before? It gets really warm there with all the people... Thankfully there was a Cosplay Sanctuary in which cosplayers could take a breather and get water and/or snacks! My friend was watching over me thankfully, to make sure I didn't pass out from heat exhaustion!

After the Con was done and we all went back home, I received a random friend request on Facebook from someone...that someone was LB. I then got a random message from them saying I was cute. Keep in mind, my profile picture at the time was me wearing a mask! Unless LB stalked my page to the deep recesses of highschool pictures, I didn't really show my face! Questioning this random message and friend request, I told LB that they didn't know me or what I looked like. Shortly after, LB disappeared from Facebook after saying goodnight. I thought nothing of it.

More time passed and LB shows up to the group meetings and the Leader introduces her. The leader ALSO says we're having a ceremony in which we'll all be knighted by LB... apparently they met LB when she was cosplaying Princess Zelda from the Legend of Zelda... I thought it was weird and a little cringe but whatever. We all were ""knighted"" and I went back to playing Cards Against Humanity with some friends, laughing at the insanity that was our dark senses of humor respectively. 

A few days pass and I get another friend request from LB on a new profile. This time the conversation is a little more civil, no random compliment out of the blue. We talked about likes and dislikes, what games we were currently playing and all that. Then...it got weird and creepy, slowly but still. Subtle flirting that I didn't reciprocate that turned into blatant hitting on me shamelessly. LB even went as far as to ask me randomly ""If you were alone with me, what would you do?"" I was not even sure how to answer! Seriously, how do you answer that question when you have given NO SIGNAL OF BEING INTERESTED!? Insanely creeped out, I asked where that came from! LB admitted to liking me and being in the mood. The feeling was NOT mutual... I changed the subject to the best of my abilities but the flirting persisted as time went on.

More days pass and I have been under increasing stress due to finals. It wasn't a simple paper to type up but rather making various 3D models and backgrounds and a few animations...I was going for graphic design and animation. My fuse was a little shorter than normal because I'm sure at the time my blood was more coffee and Monster than actual blood. LB would message me randomly, usually to complain about various things like how it sucked being single, how she wanted to die because she had no man, and how she couldn't do certain jobs due to her weight. I had enough and snapped after trying to give advice. She then called me an ass but said I was like a beast and that Beauty needed a Beast... (Insert creeped out shudder here...) 

I had enough of this and LB couldn't take a hint that I was not interested. It was then that I did what I wasn't too proud of...I became an arse to get the point across. My parents would do this tactic to get others to piss off. If you were an arse, no one would want to be around you right? Seemed like a good deterrent to me at the time! Was it mean? Yes... Do I feel bad? Yeah I kinda do... However I also felt pushed to that limit! Not an excuse, but still! I got colder and more distant when talking, being a smartass and sarcastic. I would be short in my responses and a little rude. While this helped a little, it was not a cure all.

The final interaction I had with LB was shortly after a friend told me some shocking news. Apparently the leader of the group gave LB free pickings of any guy in the group because she was so lonely. Supposedly, the leader said any of us would get with her because we were desperate... newsflash...not all of us were! Anyway, what surprised me more was that LB continued her advances on me and maybe a few others, but a majority was focused on me! Obviously I was not the only guy in this group! However, I was the only GOTH guy in this group. I stood out with my height and choice of attire. As one of my friends so lovingly joked...I was a dark oasis to a VERY thirsty traveler...

LB messaged me one last time and said how horny she was and how badly she needed to fix it. I said that wasn't my jurisdiction and that perhaps she should invest in something else to help her. She confessed that she wanted a ""Dark Prince Charming"" to...fix her problem. I stated that I am NO prince charming and will not do that! She went on about how she loved Goths and how we loved the ""Really Dark Stuff!"" Foolish me assumed the ACTUAL Goth likes. You know, music, macabre things, etc... Nope, she said she wanted to be choked, tied up, and a lot of other NSFW things! She said Goths were extremely kinky and that she needed that. I said that was not what Goth was and that Goths were not something to use as a fetish! That it was a horrible stereotype that people put on them due to misrepresentation! She also assumed Goths worshipped Satan...

That was when I informed LB that I was a Norse Pagan. Big mistake on my part... because she made a horrible innuendo about that! She said I was a Viking and that I could ""Raid her village all night long"" and that I should ""Convert her to my sexy heathen ways!"" Never before had I been so disgusted! After that horrible message...I did what I could, called my lovely girlfriend to send a clear message to LB and I blocked LB... Also let it be known that LB did not care that I was not interested, she thought I was playing hard to get! For those that wonder why I didn't say I was in a relationship, I honestly think she wouldn't care... That's the end of the story. Let me know if you want to hear more ""experiences"" I have with these individuals!

TLDR- Legbeard is let loose on a group of nerds and geeks. Decides Goth is on the menu and pesters me with LOTS of flirting and innuendos...admits I'm a fetish and I have to block them",0,1738032599.0,neckbeardstories,0,0.22,False

What a great economic model to tell you that if you get one sniffle you need to move out of your place, throw away all your belongings and buy all new stuff. Like man, if I am Target, or Walmart, I fucking love that narrative. Just get you to throw everything away, buy more shit, get a few sniffles or itchy red eyes in the new pad, move out, throw away all your shit, buy new stuff again. Just rinse and repeat and rinse and repeat. What a great way to continue pumping dollars into our consumer driven economy and to keep you draining your savings buying more and more shit.

If you think the system isn't rigged against you, you are fooling yourself. I just find it funny how the posts that seem to most get promoted are the ones about moving out, throwing everything away, buying it all back again (with no thought given to the off gassing effect of all the new cheap, chemically infused products you're getting sent to you from a sweat shop somewhere in southeast asia). Can't be a coincidence that some algorithm is pumping this narrative to my feed. 

I'll cap off this post by letting everyone know that I found some specks of brown and red in the grout of my shower. When the rainy season rolls through the tiling of the shower will get quite moldy. I looked up what red mold may be. Apparently it is the dreaded aspergillus. Well, I wanted to let everyone know that I AM NOT FUCKING MOVING. I love my place. It has a wonderful view overlooking the water, and is west facing so I get a breathtaking sunset every day. It has great access to hiking trails where I can get out in the sun, get ample vitamin D (which is healing in its own right). I have access to very clean air where I live, and the life and dwelling I have established give me a sense of calm and serenity that give me a chance to think and breathe in an otherwise chaotic world. Not to mention that moving is FUCKING STRESSFUL. What does stress do? It raises cortisol through the roof which is highly immunosuppressive and also leads to packing on the fat -- fat which myco and other toxins love to store in.  

So some mold in the shower? I honestly don't give a fuck. I am not moving. Life is too short. I love my place. The big corps pumping me feeds suggesting that every mold spore, or sniffle, or ache or pain is a justification to throw everything away and move get a big fat middle finger from me. Thank you and now I'm going to go drink some orange juice and eat some starchy carbs and put some sugar in my coffee tomorrow morning because the brain runs on glucose and I feel better and am a nicer person when I get some sugar in my diet.

Hello there fine people!

I usually manage to handle my stuff pretty well, but lately, it‚Äôs been hitting a little harder than usual. I‚Äôve been feeling pretty lonely, to be honest.

It‚Äôs like every time I try to reach out or make plans, I end up scrolling through my contacts list and just not finding anyone (which kinda sucks).

So, I figured I‚Äôd put myself out there and see what happens!

A bit about me: I‚Äôm 25, I love writing code, cooking, taking photos, and brewing coffee. I‚Äôm also big into lifting weights and hiking (though Ive been slacking off lately).

I was fiercely protective of you - to the point where I didn't even like the daycare teachers picking you up. But as you grew more and more, you became fiercely independent. I remember hearing you and Drew at band practice a few houses down the street, the drums and guitar rattling the garage doors. I remember playing on the swings and slide that mom and dad had put in the backyard for us. We were always running around the culdesac - the little family we created with the other neighborhood kids. I remember you and your friends taking pictures at mom and dad's for prom, how excited and dressed up everyone was. Before I knew it, you and Drew moved into your own place. I remember coming over a few times and you would cook for me. One time you gave me chew and I remember you coached me through the sickness and stomach ache. We laughed so hard. Next thing I blinked and you were going to Scotland to study abroad. I was so proud of you and envious of your adventurous and fearless spirit, even if you were scared you handled it with such grace. We grew distant as we got older, you focusing on your music and degree while I tried to find my sense of purpose at the bottom of a bottle. I remember you'd text me, ‚Äúbe safe, pace yourself‚Äù- our roles suddenly reversed, you now fiercely protective over me. 

You eventually left our hometown and made a home for yourself in Eugene. Once again, the immense feeling of pride exploded through me. When we came to visit you, you'd cook us incredible meals - beef stew, ramen broth from scratch, and lahmacun. You showed me around the coffee shops and took me on a tour of the University. I was so proud to see your office there. I got to see you fall in love and fall in love hard. You and Ana would text the family group chat and update us on all your camping trips, dinner parties, and costumes for Halloween. Your hobbies grew into tufting, woodworking, anything you set your mind to you accomplished - all while working on getting your PhD. Proud would be an understatement. You were incredible at everything you touched and not because it came easy to you, but because you worked hard day in and day out. 

I remember calling you one night, feeling out of control with my substance use. It was the first time I really opened up to you about it, but you knew. You let me ramble, you sat with me, you made me feel seen - but you also pushed me. You pushed me to be better and to dig myself out of the hole I created. We got to celebrate a few months of my sobriety together, before our lives changed forever. 

A year ago everything changed. 

my beloved brother, faced an unforeseen medical emergency that ultimately took his life, at just 30 years old. three days later, surrounded by love, we walked beside him for his Honor Walk. 

because of his selfless decision to be an organ donor,  his legacy lives on. a mother is able to continue caring for her daughters. a son walks without pain. a father no longer awaits a heart transplant. Aydins generosity has touched lives in ways that words cannot fully capture. 

Aydin was and will always be extraordinary.

He will take your house and blow it to the ground if you anger him.

 And also like. Ku≈õtoz he has a massive coaster addiction. The tallest coaster is written being millennium force at Cedar point over 300+ feet making it a pretty good addition to his roller coaster list which yes he does have a list of favorite roller coasters.


Trevor
Trevor is basically a maniac even to radium which radium has done a lot of of unspeakable things.  he works at a coffee shop with ku≈õtoz and sometimes he gets really tired of him and thinks about pouring coffee all over his head while it is still hot(he‚Äôs actually done that one time) so he is very much a maniac

he is very scared of roller coasters, which makes him the only one who doesn‚Äôt like roller coasters out of all the three Cox≈æians which makes some kind of a weirdo so I guess the only way for the others to get him to stop being a maniac is if they force him to ride a roller coaster lol he might like it though

1ibraqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chainsawfolk/comments/1ibraqa/my_personal_take_on_the_final_battle_with_the/,My personal take on the final battle with the Death Devil,"Hi everyone, in this post, I‚Äôd like to share my thoughts on how the fight with the death devil might play out. First tho, I‚Äôd like to apologize for any mistakes in my English.

As we know, the Aging Devil arc has more or less wrapped up. Denji, Asa, Yoshida, and the man trapped in the Aging Devil‚Äôs world for over 80 years have escaped after making a deal with the aging devil. Now, our protagonists find themselves at a coffee shop alongside Fami and Fumiko (seriously, why couldn‚Äôt she just stay dead?). What happens next could involve a negotiation about how to deal with the Death Devil(this idea isn‚Äôt mine, I saw it on Twitter, but it seems like the most plausible explanation for why they‚Äôre all gathered)

Now, the situation with the Death Devil isn‚Äôt looking good. The prophecy is only five to six months away, and our protagonists haven‚Äôt defeated a single Primal Devil since the story began. This is a major problem. According to the prophecy, Death will arrive in July 1999, and it will lead a crusade to eradicate humanity, with the help of all the other Primal Devils. So far, the main cast has faced three Primals. On two occasions, they had to flee because they were utterly outmatched, and on the third encounter, with the Aging Devil, has only ended in their favor because they trapped it into its own world. In short, things are not looking great for our protagonists.
So, how could they possibly defeat Death and the Primals? I‚Äôve come up with two possible scenarios so far:

Scenario 1: Stop the Prophecy
The best-case scenario is for Fujimoto to introduce a way to prevent the prophecy from happening altogether. Honestly, by the way things look, the main cast stands a 0% chance of winning in a direct confrontation with Death and the Primals. Nayuta has already clarified that Death is the strongest devil to exist, and as a Primal Devil, it can‚Äôt even be killed. The only way they could win is through an unprecedented level of plot armor, which would likely ruin the fight. A more satisfying solution would be for the cast to discover new information about Nostradamus‚Äôs prophecy, something that allows them to stop it from coming true.

Scenario 2: The ‚ÄúDevil‚Äù Devil
The second scenario is much darker. A while back, in an interview, Fujimoto mentioned the idea of a ‚ÄúDevil Devil‚Äù, a devil embodying humanity‚Äôs fear of devils themselves. This devil could play a crucial role in stopping Death. One heartbreaking possibility is that Pochita sacrifices himself, devouring the ‚ÄúDevil Devil‚Äù to erase all devils, including the Death Devil.
This outcome is still speculative since we don‚Äôt fully understand how Pochita‚Äôs erasure ability works. However, if the prophecy unfolds and they fail to find a way to defeat Death, erasing all devils might be the only option. Erasing the Death Devil itself would be catastrophic. Death is a fundamental concept of life, and removing it could lead overpopulation, resource wars, and humanity‚Äôs eventual destruction.
Erasing the ‚ÄúDevil"" Devil, on the other hand, might have a better outcome. While this would erase all devils, it wouldn‚Äôt erase the concepts they embody. For example, while the Death Devil would vanish, the concept of death would remain intact, preserving the natural order of life and death.


I hope my theory makes sense, and thank you for reading this far! If you have your own ideas or thoughts as to how the final battle will play out please share them in the comments, I'd love to hear them. Thanks again, and have an amazing day!

It‚Äôs connected to a 20A breaker that also powers the kitchen backsplash outlets.

About 1-2 months ago, I started noticing that the breaker would trip if I ran my air fryer while opening the refrigerator door. This was not an issue before, and I‚Äôve been using the same air fryer for over a year. Other appliances on the circuit include a vacuum sealer, coffee maker, and electric kettle.

To troubleshoot, I tested running only the air fryer while opening the refrigerator door, and it consistently tripped the breaker. I also unplugged everything else on the circuit, leaving only the refrigerator and air fryer, but the same issue occurred.

Recently, the problem has worsened: sometimes, just opening the refrigerator door trips the breaker, even when no other appliances are running. This happens inconsistently, about once every few days.

I thought the air fryer might be the problem, so I purchased a new one with the same power draw. Initially, it seemed fine‚ÄîI tested the new air fryer at max power while opening the refrigerator door, and the breaker didn‚Äôt trip. However, a few hours later, when no appliances were in use, simply opening the refrigerator door caused the breaker to trip again.

I‚Äôm unsure what‚Äôs causing this issue or how to further narrow it down. Should I call an electrician or an appliance repair service to investigate, or is there something else I should try first?",5,1738031215.0,HomeImprovement,13,0.73,False

1ibr831,https://www.reddit.com/r/VillainyGroup/comments/1ibr831/the_rogues_gallery_1855/,The Rogues' Gallery (1855),">Keeping track of your villains is definitely a problem... and it was the development of photography which helped to make the task more manageable back in the 1800s.

[Rogue's Gallery](https://preview.redd.it/6da5waluanfe1.png?width=1312&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c5fc168b94735d53778e131ca69e46028d6edec)

It's safe to say that photography wasn't a new art back in 1855... but it was still very-much in its infancy... as was crime science and what we would today consider to be 'Policing'.

The conjunction of the two, however, where photography was used as a means of advancing police work, became a thing when Allan Pinkerton, the founder of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency put together something he called The Rogues' Gallery.

No longer needing to rely on the often vague description of an offender, victims could now look at the Rogues' Gallery to find an actual photograph of the person who had offended against them.

No more awkward sketch artist attempts to draw someone from poorly-remembered descriptions, followed by hundreds of Police officers trying to figure out whether the awkward smudge was a birthmark, or whether someone had spilled some coffee.

This seems pretty straight-forward now... we're always seeing on TV and movies how the stern detective type will get the weeping victim to thumb through a catalog of offender photos... and then going ""Ah, yes. Dirty Dave McTavish of Lindisfarne..."" (or similar) and making an arrest.

Back then, however, it was ground-breaking stuff.

Furthermore, this Gallery set about linking offenders to one another by association, describing their modus operandi, their hideouts and hangouts... and basically becoming a very early form of crime database.

The term Rogues' Gallery has now come to mean any collection of pictures of people who have been arrested as criminals... or a pictorial collection of any kind of 'rogue'... such as famous dictators, or deadly viruses... or a collection of hundreds of pre-generated characters for use in Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, back in 1980.

As you can imagine, after a few years, any collection of photographs of thousands upon thousands of villains was going to become cumbersome and difficult to curate.

A chap by the name of Alphonse Bertillon (1853-1914) standardised the practice of photography for crime-fighting purposes in the 1870s... creating a 'judicial style' of photography to help manage the problem of information overload.

You'd recognise this 'judicial style' as what we would today consider a 'mugshot'... systematically filed and cross-indexed so they could be easily retrieved.

Bertillon was also into measuring just about everything... so along-side the photographs of villains, you'd also have the lengths of their fingers, the circumference of their foreheads, and so forth. A practice known as Bertillonage... which gradually became adopted around the world until Fingerprints eventually became the new gold standard.

>So, while the Rogues' Gallery was an important tool in early law enforcement, it had its issues, and certainly underwent a great deal of technical advancement. What it has left us with, however, is an intriguing look at the early steps of trying to apply scientific principles to finicky real-world problems.",1,1738031138.0,VillainyGroup,0,1.0,False

A faint drip of water and the hum of electronics, the odd settling of the house... and the clicking of keys, is all I hear now.

  
Until I'm drawn inward and then

I almost want to ignore what's heard - I turned the noise back on without realizing it. A series of habits, almost just that. Repeat with difference, mutate casually. Trying to be better, in the right ways. I almost want to ignore the fear entirely - to soar through this eternity without a moments doubt, or a single thought after this very second.

  
The contradiction have given me a bit a headache, solving the problem with the question generator, and finding the energy to do everything at once - sometimes anything at all - but somehow finding it. Somehow, feeling like I'm solving it. As if frustration and hopeless has only become parts of the chain, a few simple steps, of a process which repeats similarly.

  
Ignoring it again, yeah, the problem. Wanting the best life but neglecting everything that leads to that moment, the absolute basics forgotten about, trying to come up with a hair-brained scheme to resolve some justified wrong. Some unjustified wrong. Something wrong, and I almost want to ignore what's heard. I would rather coexist than be at war. I tried leaving, that didn't work.

We met at an obscure corner of the internet 
Start talking 
Instantly clicked
Turned out we live 12 kms away from each other 
Same age, same hobbies, same literature taste, music taste, both are kinda old
school
Conversation goes on for hours in a random chatbox
We share socials
I ask her if we can go out somewhere next weekend 
She instantly agrees
I take her to a library date, a old coffee shop where she pays(although i insisted several times), I buy her a chocolate, a book, she gives me flowers and some of her books,(now I dunno if it's because of my birthday or not)
I held her hand while crossing the road, (she held it tight too)
We click some pics, go to another cafe, eat some food and have some drinks(NA)
She extends her curfew till 9 30 after talking to her parents.
We meet again a couple times.
We have been regularly chatting, she has told me that she thinks I'm a gentleman and likes the fact that I made sure that I was comfortable throughout the day we met up. 
We are bunking college again to go somewhere together next Thursday,
Here's the thing tho, based on her previous conversations with me I have deducted the fact that she is a type of a girl who loses interest if the guy doesn't take the lead. 
She talks to me in a very caring tone and bullies me too.  (The bullying is mutual)


Also she has given me slight hints but I dunno if they are proper hints

Like, "" next day I will wear heels to match your height"", teasing me about various things(in an endearing way), sending cute reels (mostly involving romantic poetry and pet stuff), patting my head, trying to reach her hands out everytime we cross the road. 

As we haven't really talked about dating, 
But I have fallen for her like an angel without his wings, I never fell for someone this hard before. And I think she knows that.

 But as she is not the type to ask the guy out, should I ask her out formally the next day we meet or should I wait a bit more... And will bringing her flowers all of a sudden be a risky thing to do? (Although I have asked her if she prefers roses or sunflowers more so it won't be that big of a surprise)

I never sleep trained my first born (7m) , we slept together for waaaaaay too long, but it was always just him and I so I never minded. he's squared away, but the baby- I've been significantly more neurotic with him, googling everything he does to make sure it's okay and taking him to several unnecessary doc appts just to hear them tell me he's perfectly fine. at the last one I had a whole meltdown, almost passed out crying and hyperventilating because his sleep has been so hectic we were setting aside 3 hours AT LEAST a night to get him settled and in his bed. I ended up co sleeping w him a lot because I just wanted us to get sleep but it was not good sleep and I am so scared every time we lay together but my exhaustion just got to a point where it would override my fear and we slept together. any ways, the doc said with his weight being good and him being healthy she said we could try the CIO method. I hate this method. it breaks my heart to hear him crying. he did pretty okay for a few days, an hour, and the next day 40, the next 30 then sleeping for a magical 10 hours!! but right now as I type this I'm going on an hour of him crying and I just want to go cuddle him but also I want him to learn to be comfy on his own. I did go down and settle him about 15 minutes ago all the way to long blinks and limp limbs, he was nearly asleep so I laid him back down and as soon as his butt touches his bed he wakes and cries and screams, as always. I don't know if checking on him is worse or if letting him cry is worse, I just don't know. and what even is ""sleep trained""? I've read it just means they can self settle but... when is that supposed to happen? how do I know how long to leave him. please give me your sleeping advice. I'm feeling so guilty and just want him okay and safe in his own bed with at least a shred of my sanity left. üò≠ thank you

edit to add in case it matters: his bedtime routine is lotion, fresh diaper, and a long feed in a dim room, during the day we play a ton: tummy time, baths, books, toys, he has a bit of independent play every once and a while for 5-10 minutes while I make coffee or switch laundry or whatever.. okay thanks",0,1738030773.0,Parenting,7,0.5,False

For the first experiment, he made our group stay an extra 2 hours vs all of the other groups because he wanted us to correct data for a specific part. He helped us with the calculations, claiming that our numbers were incorrect when we did it but when he was doing the calculations himself he got the same numbers. He made us stay an additional 2 hours just for him to be wrong. For the second experiment, my group finished early and the TA asked to check our papers before leaving. He wanted us to complete one more calculation and provide the graph for it yet he DID NOT ask any other group to do this. My friend and I were so fed up at that point that we just turned in our reports as we felt it was unfair that he did not ask anyone else's group to do this (once again) and we no longer trust his calculations/opinion. That same day one of the girls in my group had a coffee (which ik isn't allowed) and 2 other girls from different groups. The TA came over and ONLY asked our group to throw away the coffee or either finish it at that instant. When we confronted him about why the other girls with drinks weren't talked to, he simply said (and I quote) ""I'm just trying to follow the rules"". He never addressed how unfair he was being and how we were the only group being singled out. I'm really worried about my grade and I know this TA can possibly fail my group and make us retake lab.

1ibqzli,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ibqzli/aita_for_not_replying_to_messages_for_four_days/,AITA for not replying to messages for four days? TW: self-exit ideation,"This is not one of those posts where I‚Äôm looking for validation that I‚Äôm not the asshole; I genuinely want to know what other people think because I sometimes find it hard to gauge what is appropriate and what other people and sometimes I am feeling. I can give some of my personal backstory but it would be too long so ask away if you have context questions.  
I‚Äôm 31 and have always preferred solitary activities and loads of space over socialising. This is not a secret to my friends, although I do mask the extent of this and tend to go to more social gatherings and meet-ups than would be ideal for me to maintain friendships. I reckon loads of people can relate and I feel like in order to keep friends you‚Äòve gotta spend time with them lmao

I‚Äôm the kind of person who can meet you, have a great connection and not see you again for literal months and pick up where we left off just fine. I have found a handful of friends who understand and accept this and some that are pretty similar because they‚Äôre either super busy, live far away or are introverted. I should say I moved A LOT growing up, so attachment has never been a huge issue for me. I am aware not everyone is like me, hence the compromise with the socialising. To clarify, I don‚Äôt hate socialising and usually have a good enough time once I‚Äôm there, but I have the ever present underlying feeling of waiting to go home. And the part that I keep more hidden from my friends is that if I socialise I usually need soooo much downtime to recover. To give you an idea, if I go to a friend‚Äôs house I tend to plan and make sure I have the day off the next day to recharge, even if it was just a few hours playing music and drinking coffee. Yup. I‚Äôve spent a week in isolation before after particularly social outings. I‚Äôve tried explaining this to people in the past and they either say ‚Äúsame!‚Äù in a way that tells me they do NOT get it, or they kind of dismiss it saying stuff like I need to socialise more to be healthy, etc. Most of my friends are hopeless extroverts and although I love them, I feel heavily misunderstood in this aspect of my life and can get easily irritated by volume and constant planning to do things, especially if it‚Äôs last minute. Side note, my friends all live near each other and I have to get two trains (which costs a fortune) and usually walk over an hour each way just to see them at our usual meet-up. I also get up at around 8am if I want to see them at 2pm, which is a very long day sometimes getting back at 9pm. This means that if we‚Äôre meeting once a week, it actually takes up a lot of my time and energy. I am willing to do this, but as I don‚Äôt usually feel the exhaustion until it hits me later, it can take its toll.

I also realised recently that I‚Äôve never invited anyone to hang out beyond the vague ‚Äúwe should hang out again‚Äù remark without any specific date because I have learned not to make future plans while in an extroverted state (iykyk).

When it comes to social media, I never saw the point of it beyond admin and work. I absolutely despise getting messages from people randomly that just say ‚Äúhey‚Äù or whatever. I also work in industries that are very social and crowded with people, so my DMs are always full. About 50% is creepy men, but that‚Äôs another thing entirely not for today.  
Recently I began therapy for past childhood and adolescent trauma specifically catered to third culture kids (a.k.a missionary kids). It has brought up a lot and I‚Äôve been especially sensitive to feelings of overwhelm when it comes to onslaught of messages and feeling like everyone just wants to take, take, take from me (I know that‚Äôs not strictly true, I‚Äôm describing how my body reacts in those moments). I developed a strategy of just going on the socials once a day to do a ‚Äúmass answer‚Äú session where I reply to all my messages in one go. This sometimes takes over two hours, listening to voice memos and furiously typing.

It got to the point where I was cursing every time my phone buzzed and felt genuine rage if I finished a 9 part message reply and two minutes later they‚Äôre responding already. Even when I‚Äôm nocturnal, I‚Äôve gotten the three bubbles popping up at 3am. Like, what do people do with their time? I became disappointed with myself when I yelled aloud, ‚Äúget a fucking life‚Äù one time when my phone buzzed a gazillion times in a row. I don‚Äôt want to be that, because it makes me feel inauthentic. I value friendship because of the connection and constant texts just feels like a cheap substitute, especially if it‚Äôs dumb links to stuff which is usually funny but can sometimes be a 6 minute video that makes my heart drop. It can come across as rude if they see I‚Äôm online and don‚Äôt reply. But what I really want to do because I‚Äôm at home and in my own space is do art, write music, journal, read, lift weights, do yoga, all that good stuff. Or just do NOTHING for an hour, you know?

Where I‚Äôm stuck : Because my friend groups (yes, plural) are pretty tight knit and riddled with ADHD lol cutting down significantly on socialising means it would impact our friendship. Some of us meet up to practice music together, so I can‚Äôt just skip out easily. It feels like an all or nothing situation, or like there‚Äôs a quota of times I can give a genuine reason to not go before it‚Äôs unacceptable. I feel awkward saying no so much but they don‚Äôt seem to understand that a night out to a concert, which for them would be just the ticket price and maybe a drink, for me it‚Äôs at least double that because of the travel and even more if I need to stay the night and get the early train home in the morning. My jobs pay sporadically so I feel like I‚Äôm always broke and can‚Äôt really save for what I really love doing - travel (solo, of course üòâ).

I have put my foot down on certain people, like the ones who send ‚Äú?‚Äù as a whole complete message because I didn‚Äôt reply within two minutes. If you do that - STOP, it‚Äôs rude and pushy. Go drink some water and come back in 20 minutes for the love of god you won‚Äôt die üòÇ

Where I might be the asshole: I haven‚Äôt been on my messages app for four days because I‚Äôve been going THROUGH IT. Like, in bed, crying, processing my therapy session, getting flashbacks and not sleeping at night, eating properly, you get the idea. Last night and this morning was particularly bad as I battled with pretty severe suicidal ideation. My friends know I‚Äôve started therapy but I don‚Äôt share the extent of my suffering because that‚Äôs between me and the doc. I can expand more on that but I feel like that‚Äôs enough justification. I have overshared in the past and it‚Äôs made things worse and I‚Äôve even made myself feel violated for sharing things I didn‚Äôt realise I didn‚Äôt want to share until I got home (hence the previous comment of not always being aware of how I feel until it hits my body). I think it‚Äôs called dyspraxia or something and it sucks. I hadn‚Äôt been counting the days I‚Äôd not been on socials but it did cross my mind to send a broadcast to everyone to say that I was going to take some time off as I‚Äôve done in the past but I had no energy as I‚Äôd have to deselect all my work contacts and the last time I did this, I got an avalanche of messages asking me what is wrong and a few men offering their ‚Äúsupport‚Äù and giving me their own trauma stories I never asked for to connect or whatever. To clarify, I don‚Äôt know these men, they are people I MAYBE had a passing conversation with, IF that. One guy said he enjoyed talking to me on set and when I asked what we talked about he recalled a conversation I had WITH SOMEONE ELSE. He had been standing there listening. Sorry, tangent. Back to my potential assholery:

One of my closer friends in the group messaged me this morning (she had sent me a couple of messages over the last couple of days already including a link) and I heard the buzz because I‚Äôd set my phone on loud for calls and I‚Äôm not tech savvy or motivated to learn how to isolate sound for just calls. When I opened the message she was asking me ‚Äúam I missing something‚Äù and began telling me she was feeling ignored and hurt that I hadn‚Äôt replied since Thursday and it really got to me because she was doubting herself like if she did something wrong and even got into a thought that I was ghosting her because she thought I might‚Äôve interpreted a silly song she sang as her hitting on me (I‚Äôm queer). This friend sometimes has bouts of self-doubt and we all overthink but it really hurt me that she had these feelings. If a friend doesn‚Äôt reply for a while, I usually send something like, ‚Äúhey, just checking in, thumbs up you‚Äôre alive!‚Äù Simple, it works.  
This friend knew about my therapy, the fact I‚Äôve had three bouts of sickness over the winter and that I‚Äòm planning on moving in temporarily with my very pregnant sister to help out, so it‚Äôs been hectic. I am also in overdraft and can‚Äôt even buy a bus ticket right now and I‚Äôm living off beans and rice. This is why I was a bit surprised and upset that her mind went down that slippery slope of rejection. I was also hurt she thought I‚Äôd ghost her if she hit on me.  
I went against my rule of over sharing and just told her how tough it‚Äôs been, which by her response I don‚Äôt think she grasped the severity because she basically said she often feels the same and promptly told me she was meeting up with a mutual friend for coffee (invitation for me to join) but I‚Äôm happy enough to let that go. I know that if she‚Äôd seen my tear streaked face and my unwashed body, hair and pigsty of an apartment she‚Äòd not have dreamed to ask me to come out. Because of that message and because I was already on the phone, I went ahead and did a broadcast message to most of my contacts to say that I was taking time away from social media. Cue the message pile on, the overwhelm and undoing of the effects of my journaling this morning. Ever had that feeling of, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to end this out of spite, that‚Äôll show them‚Äù? That intrusive thought simultaneously horrified me and made me numb.

I may sound like a weak wuss and I fully accept that. I have no stamina when I‚Äôm in a fight or flight or freeze or fawn state. She sent me a message saying she‚Äôd grant me a week, which I clicked a heart emoji without thinking. When I set the phone down I thought about it and suddenly got very angry at that. My past has made me feel like I don‚Äôt have autonomy and because I have a very chill demeanour, I suspect people think they have a right to dictate my time. I wish I could film myself and see if I really come across as some pushover. I recognise this may be me conflating and blowing the situation out of proportion (that‚Äôs the crux of why I‚Äôm posting this) but I felt offended and like I was being given an allowance on personal space. Like what, she will message me in a week and I MUST reply even if I‚Äôm not ready?

She is in no way clingy - she is simply energy reincarnate even when she‚Äôs tired. I think a lot of my personality goes over her head but again, I don‚Äôt mind that I‚Äôm misunderstood as long as I‚Äôm respected. In these moments I feel like giving up on having friends altogether because they are time and energy consuming and goddamn expensive to have. When I travel, I always end up hanging out with a local or other travellers and we have a good time, then we go home to our consecutive countries. I love that and I feel no ill-will to never seeing these brief encounters again and I wonder if I can just do that instead. I can‚Äôt, because I get booked on a lot of jobs my friends get too so it would be awkward to drop everything just to be placed next to them in a scene at work for 12 hours.

I think we‚Äôre good now but I don‚Äôt want this to happen again and I‚Äôm willing to adjust my behaviour but not so much that I‚Äôm putting my mental health at risk. I will always choose me. I mean, if I don‚Äôt, they can‚Äôt have me either, right?

So what I want to know is if I‚Äôm the asshole for not pre-warning people I‚Äôd be going AWOL for a few days (not that I planned it, but I didn‚Äôt consider anyone else in my state). Is it wrong to have relationships in order to live when everyone else seems to live for relationships? 

TLDR; went AWOL on socials due to severe depressive thoughts, friend got hurt I hadn‚Äôt replied for four days.

## Understanding Your Needs: ‚Å¢Identifying the Ideal Nuna Cup Holder

Before we dive into specific models, it's crucial to assess what you need within the **nuna accessories** ecosystem. Think about your daily routine. Do you often use ‚Å¢large refillable water bottles? Or ‚Äåare you mainly ‚Äådealing with standard-sized coffee cups? Consider the types of drinks‚Å£ you usually carry and how often‚Äå you will be using the stroller. ‚Å§ Are you looking for a single cup holder ‚Å£for solo adventures, or‚Å¢ do you require space for multiple drinks when you are out with other family‚Äå members?

## Nuna‚Å£ Stroller Cup Holder Options: A 2025 Overview

Specific cup holders are designed for specific stroller ‚Å£models to ensure that‚Å£ the fit is ‚Äãperfect for safety and stability.  While Nuna may offer variations throughout the year, here's our overview of the likely options for the 2025 season:

### The Dedicated Nuna cup Holder

The first type of ‚Å£approach is to get a cup holder‚Å£ designed explicitly for your model. Nuna's ‚Å¢own brand ‚Äçaccessories‚Å§ are designed with their strollers ‚Å§in mind, ensuring ‚Äåseamless integration. The advantage here ‚Äçis perfect fit and brand‚Å§ consistency. Thes are frequently enough made‚Å§ with high quality materials‚Äç that match other aspects of the stroller construction.

*  ‚Äç **Nuna MIXX and DEMI Series Cup Holder**: As highlighted in the [1] reference, this cup‚Å§ holder is specifically engineered ‚Äçfor the MIXX and DEMI series strollers. ‚ÄãIts design offers a snug ‚Å£fit and a stable‚Å§ base ‚Å§for smaller tumblers, water bottles, cups, etc. It's also dishwasher-safe making maintenance easy. This would be the first choice for‚Å¢ owners of these models,‚Å£ due to its perfect fit and design.

*   **Nuna TRIV Series Cup Holder**: The second style of proprietary cup holder are the ones designed for the TRIV series, from the [2] reference.‚Å¢ This style mirrors the ‚Å£same design and ‚Äåfit of the MIXX and DEMI series and offers an easy and durable access for carrying drinks ‚Äçwhile‚Äå on‚Äã the go with your stroller.### Worldwide Cup Holder Options

the market also contains third-party universal cup holders that claim compatibility with a variety of stroller brands,including,allegedly,nuna. These‚Äã may come in handy if you have multiple stroller makes of you are seeking more versatile ‚Äåoptions. However, it vital ‚Äåto note that third-party‚Äã options can‚Å¢ be less secure or less aesthetically pleasing that the branded ‚Äçoptions.  While some third party vendors might offer something along the‚Å¢ line of a **universal cup holder for nuna**‚Å£ be sure‚Äå to read reviews‚Äã from other users before purchasing. ‚ÄãIt's also ‚Å£crucial to meticulously verify the dimensions and clamp mechanism to ensure that it will fit‚Å£ securely on your specific Nuna frame.*   **Multi-brand Universal Cup holders**: Products such as the Lamicall stroller‚Äç cup holder on Amazon, [4] references,‚Äç might be advertised as **nuna stroller compatible accessories**. These style of products‚Äç often aim for multiple different brands to ‚Äãtry to maximize their applicability,at the cost of the perfect fit. In addition,these products may be more cheaply made are not ‚Äças robust and durable as the official‚Å£ Nuna options.

*   **Stroller Cup Holder with Phone Holder Options:** Another style frequently seen online are cup holders that also act as ‚Å£phone holders in one integrated product. As seen in [5] these tend to clamp on multiple ‚Äçdifferent brands,‚Å£ and will require‚Äã extra care to ensure compatibility with‚Å£ your exact ‚Å£nuna product.

## Key considerations ‚Å¢When Selecting your Nuna Cup Holder Attachment

When picking the ‚Äåright **nuna drink holder**, you‚Äôve got a few ‚Å£key factors to take into account:

1.**model Compatibility**:‚Äã As previously stated, ensuring the cup holder is compatible with your ‚Å§particular Nuna stroller -‚Äç **nuna mixx cup‚Äã holder**, ‚Äå**nuna pipa car seat cup holder**, etc. ‚Äì is essential.  Consult the manual, Nuna's website, or read reliable reviews ‚Äåto ‚Äåbe‚Å£ certain this is going to ‚Å¢be a ‚Äçperfect fit.
2.  **Stability ‚Äãand Security**: The cup holder needs to hold your drink securely. A stable‚Å¢ design that does not tip easily is needed, ‚Äçespecially when going ‚Äãover uneven surfaces. Nobody wants a spillage on ‚Äãa nice outing!
3.  **Cup Size Flexibility**: ‚Äå Look for a design that can accommodate different cup and bottle sizes, allowing ‚Äåyour cup ‚Äåholder‚Å£ to handle‚Å§ a wide range of beverages and containers.  Some designs use adjustable grips to accommodate multiple sizes.
4.  **Ease of Attachment and Removal**:  A ‚Å£simple and intuitive ‚Å§attachment mechanism is nice to have when needing to install the ‚Äçpiece.  Look for a simple system which can be easily taken off the stroller for cleaning or storage.5. **Durability**: Given that cup holders handle ‚Å¢frequent use and exposure to the elements,ensure that the cup holder you select is made from strong,long lasting materials.
6. ‚Å§ **Cleaning and Maintenance:** A cup holder that is easily cleaned is very important for overall ‚Å§use, especially‚Å§ with smaller children ‚Äãwith less than stellar clean ‚Äçdrinking habits. Dishwasher-safe parts are super handy for maintenance.
