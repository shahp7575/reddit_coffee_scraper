1p4wmdo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Suburbanhell/comments/1p4wmdo/i_cannot_wait_to_get_the_hell_out_of_here/,I cannot wait to get the hell out of here,"This is a rant about how I made the worst decision moving to the Chicago suburbs:

I am a gay guy and was living downtown until May 2024 with my boyfriend at the time. Annoyed by city politics and thinking we wanted more space, we start looking on the outskirts of the city. One thing led to another and then we decided well why not move further out and we could get an even bigger place in the woods? I figured since I travel a lot for work to big cities it would be nice to come home to quiet. Boy was I wrong.

Work trips ended up with my boyfriend cheating on me, several times over and over again, while I was away and ultimately me kicking his ass out. Luckily, I bought the house on my own. But here I am for the last year alone in a big house in the burbs. I can’t sell and officially close on this house until May 2026 so I don’t have to pay a big capital gains tax – the only saving grace is that given the work that I put into the place and what similar houses are selling for here, I’ll be able to walk away with a $200-$250,000 profit.

I’m reaching the point where I’m going absolutely stir crazy. I’m a long train ride away from the city, and too far away that I have literally no dating options. My only few friends out here are straight and married and I never see them - the best friend I have can only meet for coffee at 7am on a Thursday lol. I find that guys on dating apps here are extremely threatened by me being really fit, and they message me randomly just to throw insults and names at me which is clearly a reflection of their jealousy and insecurity. I’ve never experienced this level of rudeness from other gay guys than I have in the suburbs - and I’ve lived all over the country. Or they just say I’m a catfish and block me. I’ve had to lower my standards out here just to get laid.

I am so sick of driving everywhere, hearing my lazy neighbors complain about things, driving past disgusting strip malls, sitting in traffic when I’m thinking myself – if I’m gonna sit in traffic, why aren’t I in the city? I miss going to yoga studios and meeting other like-minded people. I miss being able to walk out my doorstep and be right in the middle of everything. I miss intelligent cultured people who dress well. I honestly don’t know what the hell I was thinking. I’m 35 about to be 36 – I don’t wanna waste another day of my 30s out here. 

Granted, it’s a nice area by the lake and there are a bunch of running and biking trails – but I’ve never been so bored in my life. I’m a city person and I’m going literally insane out here. Counting down the days until I list my place in March.",0,1763928681.0,Suburbanhell,0,0.5,False

1p4wkyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/PsychologyTalk/comments/1p4wkyj/criminal_profilingunderstanding_of_psychological/,Criminal Profiling/Understanding of Psychological Terms Used in 20’s,"TLDR: What would have been meant when doctors used the term “has fits but otherwise sane” to describe a man trying to please insanity during his trial?

I am researching for a book on a family member I uncovered when doing genesological research. He was on trial in 1929 for murder. It’s not truly clear if he murdered the guy because the guy had married the woman he was in love with, or because the guy refused to sell him beer on credit. What was said in court, was that the man refused to sell him beer on credit so he pulled his gun, stated “you’ve lived too long anyway” and shot him. His mother and sister described a “blast” from when he was a kid and “he hadn’t known right from wrong since” and his sister actually had to break through their bathroom window and save him a year or two before this as he has filled the bathroom with gas and was trying to kill himself.

When the man tried to plead insanity, the doctors that evaluated him said that he suffered from “fits” but was otherwise sane. I have researched his crimes and this is the only truly violent crime he ever committed. He operated underground mostly, moving counterfeit money and robbing a lit I believe. I have found bank accounts ties to his aliases with large amounts of money in out of state banks (like over $14,000 in 1938). Like he had a more organized operation than most just petty criminals back then.

Sheriffs and officers were known to speak about him in a way that framed it like they were scared of him. Though, he wasn’t truly violent by nature from what I can gather. The only other reference to violence I know if in his life was beating his sister’s husband till he was unconscious and needed true care, because the husband had beat his sister. However, it does seem from newspapers that he would always somehow find a weapon even when he rarely used it even to threaten. Though, he was known to always carry guns outside of jail/prison.

He was a known jail break artist and showed a lit of ingenuity in how he did that. He used tools from his environment, down to the spring in a coffee percolator, to break out of jail. Like he would take anything and use it for leverage.

He would be a constant management problem while in custody. Eventually they started putting extra locks on the jail doors and started putting him in full body chains including a neck chain when transporting him. He would brag a lot about breaking out. And once he used 26 different spoons and melted them down before he was able to escape from one of the prisons by making a crude key. He still had it in his mouth when they caught him and when he was taken back, they had put extra locks on everything so he spit it into the sheriff’s hand and said he didn’t need that and would find something else. He did shortly thereafter.

He is almost described in newspaper and articles and by family like he was slow but with the banking and the ingenuity and knowing when to be on the radar and when not to, I kind of feel like he wasn’t the “lunkhead” they describe.

I would like some help on trying to understand this man. I can give more details if needed.",1,1763928587.0,PsychologyTalk,0,1.0,False

Linked up with someone on Taimi on tuesday, we met for a single coffee the next day, had some phone calls and she basically immediately told me she was head over heels into me, how attractive i am, how sexy my voice sounds, how she's thinking about moving in with me, all kinds of intimate and everyday stuff we should totally do and hourly texts about everything she does.

Mind you, i'm very openly ace and not into romantic partnerships and she knew that from the moment we engaged. Not that this kinda thing would be any less weirder towards a more sexually inclined person but wtf?

So, since i know my fair share of trauma and i know how much isolation and loneliness can fuck someone up, instead of calling it quits, i told her that she's a nice woman and i'd like to be friends, but that i also need some first and second dates to, y'know, get to actually know her before i would even think about short term plans, let alone long term stuff. Some real basic boundaries and some actual relation-/friendship building with some prospects for more in the future.

Big surprise incoming (/s): She fucking flipped! Started guilt-tripping me about how things are always ""so complicated"" for her and how she just really cares about me, then accused me of not respecting her very serious feelings towards me (again, i've ""known"" this person for like half a week).

In the end, i decided to block her because nothing about my boundaries got through to her. And also, if this is the behavior after 4 days, i don't want to know how it looks after a month or more. Just red flag after red flag.

... yeah. She was basically a stranger, so it's not like i'm heartbroken or anything, but i was really excited to make some new local queer friends my own age and just .. wow. Not really my best week, gals. :C

1p4wfmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1p4wfmh/aio_to_hearing_my_supervisor_tell_my_coworker_she/,AIO to hearing my supervisor tell my coworker she thinks I have an eating disorder?,"I’m 17 years old and I work as a dietary aide in a private retirement home. I’ve never had any issues with the job. It’s a very nice place so I get paid 17 and hour, which is amazing for my very first job, and I also want to get into nursing when I’m older so I think having a job that’s considered health care is good for me.

I’ve worked here since a little before I turned 16, and I work about 24 hours a week.

All in all, it’s been a good place to work. My coworkers are all nice and there’s surprisingly a lot of minors, so I’ve made a couple of friends through work. A lot of the kids I go to school with work there, so I was familiar with people in my first day which made the job seem a lot easier.

Two things I have to mention for this post two make sense are:

One, I’m a very shy and quiet and private person. It took me a while to make the couple friends I made through the job. My first couple months I only really talked to coworkers when spoken to, and I was quite shy when talking to and serving residents.

Two, I struggle with an eating disorder and I have for the last six months. I honestly struggled before that, but recently it’s been more difficult. I go to therapy and such but anyone who’s ever struggle with any kind of eating disorder knows it’s very difficult.

The other day I was working 11-7:30 because it was an inservice day at my school so I picked up an 8 hour shift.

I went on lunch about 2:00, and when I came back, I overheard one of my supervisors and an older coworker of mine talking.

I had no intentions of eaves dropping, in fact I had headphones in because my supervisor has never minded if we have them in while there’s no residents in the dining room, and between the time of the 6-2:30 people leaving and the 4-8 people coming in, there’s stuff to do in the downing room like roll silverware, vacuum, prep fruit bowls and dessert, just small things like that that the mid shifters do after tables are bussed and reset, so my supervisor doesn’t mind if we listen to music or something while doing everything, as long as it is done.

Normally we have two first shift people, two second shift people, and two third shift people per didn’t room (it’s a five floor building and there’s five dining rooms)

But this we had three people on third shift and I was the only mid shift, which was fine because it meant we had an extra closer.

So I was coming back from lunch and I overheard my supervisor and the coworker say my name. Again I had no intentions of listen to them or anything, I was just going to start doing my prep work since our silverware wasn’t washed yet, but then I’d heard my supervisor say something that made me pause.

She said, “Yeah, I think that girl has some kind of eating disorder, I never see her eat a thing.”

To of which my coworker laughed a bit and then said “Probably so.”

It is true that I don’t really eat at work, mostly because I hate eating in front of people, but still. In my mind it’s not really their business?

My supervisor showing concern and talking to me privately would be one thing, but talking about it with another coworker seems wrong to me.

I just proceeded to walk through the dining room to the kitchenette in the back where we keep the fruit and dessert we prep for the meals and all the juice and coffee machines and what not.

I didn’t expect her to say anything to me, just assume that I couldn’t hear her because of my headphones, but she came to the back and said “oh I didn’t realize you were back from break already.”

I just kept my head down and started plating the fruit I got from the main kitchen, not looking at her when I said. “Yeah, and I’d appreciate if you don’t talk about me to other coworkers, especially about my personal situations.”

She immediately denied it and said she was taking about how I did well during lunch for there only being two of us that day.

I told her that I heard what she said, and that she should mind her own business because she truly knows nothing about me.

She told me I heard her wrong and to not be disrespectful before she left.

I just continued what I was doing.

I’ve always been very respectful towards her, and I’m someone who hates confrontation, but this just seemed wrong to me. I definitely see now that I could have been more respectful and polite, but the truth is that I don’t like this supervisor despite being respectful.

My other two are great. This one? She constantly complains about the residents and the fact she has to go to other floors to check on the other employees, she’ll disappear when we need help with something and turns into she’ll be out smoking, then she’ll come and tells us to stop standing around because she’s the one who gets into trouble for us not working even though we’ve completed everything and we’re just waiting for her to check us out (we have these little checklists for each shift and she’s supposed to “check us out” before we go to make sure everyone completed all their tasks) and there’s plenty of other things that just make her not a great supervisor.

She told one of my coworkers (a guy I already knew from school and he’s a good friend of mine) when he as talking about the fact he went to homecoming with a guy that she “knew he was gay because he doesn’t act very manly”. He just laughed it off, but later texted me saying he thought it was rude.

Another time one of my coworkers (also a friend of mine through school) made a small comment to me about a dress she got being too small for her because she was fat, and my supervisor said “I’m so glad I don’t struggle with my weight at all.” Which for one upset my friend and for two seemed weird to me because as an adult you should be quick to tell a teenager “oh no you’re not” or something like that. At least that’s how I see it.

She also changes our shifts without telling us. I was supposed to work 6-2:30 for thanksgiving and now I’m working a 11-7:30. She didn’t even ask me about it. Another time I knew for a fact I was working Tuesday and not Wednesday but then the next then I checked it, I was on the schedule for Wednesday even though I’d already traded with a friend because I needed that night off and she needed the Tuesday off, yet we were switched.

Anyway, I half expected to get in trouble for talking to her that way, but she hasn’t said anything to me.

I really do hate confrontation and i definitely don’t want to be on my supervisors bad side, especially since I work with this one most often, but it just felt like a strange thing to say and kind of upset me considering I already know I struggle.

But I don’t know I guess. Maybe in just being dramatic about it. Is what she said true? Yes. But I still feel like it isn’t her business, especially to just talk about with a coworker and as a supervisor.

And I truly am a respectful and kind person, she’s still my supervisor and an adult, but i also knew how to stand up for myself and I know right from wrong, and this seemed wrong to me?

Context: Need advise po para po sa youngest brother namin na magkakapatid. We are 5 siblings po (3 girls and two boys) and ako po ang pang apat. 
Lahat kami na mag siblings ay may kanya kanya nang pamilya at mga anak except sa youngest brother namin who is 26 (let’s call him LB for Little Brother). Sya po ang baby ng family and as is common in the Ph, pinakaspoiled. We all still live in the same house where we grew up in (hindi naman po sya mansion pero it’s a 4 bedroom house).
When LB graduated from college some years ago he had trouble finding a job in his line of work/suited sa studies nya which is sa tech so nag apply sya sa isang call center. Okay naman work nya as chat agent and he eventually got promoted to SME (actually di sya promotion, mejo lang— ang difference lang is he doesn’t do agent type na work anymore; he now manages the “tickets” and does some TL-assigned tasks  na di ko na alam kung ano ba talaga. Hindi sya proper promotion dahil no increase sa pay, allowance lang). Graveyard shift sya and since we live 1-1.5hrs from the call center, pinahiram ni dad sa kanya ang pickup nya para maging service nya, mahirap kasi makasakay ng jeep or PUV 10-11pm onwards samin at ayaw ni LB matulog sa sleeping quarters ng call center dahil may mga harassment / stealing issues dun so para naman sa safety nya.
2 years into his call center life, he met this girl na naging girlfriend nya. He would bring her home to eat sa bahay and that was how we met her.
Then we started noticing some red flags:
1. Si girl, parang lagi naka buntot kay LB kahit weird hours of the night at labas/pasok sila sa bahay. I know si LB dapat ang may alam ng boundary na to na ayaw ni dad naka-unlock pa ang gate at night dahil when it’s their day off (nag sa-swap sched pa talaga sila para same off sila) dito sila sa sala tuma tambay and they would go sa 7/11 or kung saan2 para bumili ng snacks at 12-1am. Minsan, they take long so parang pumapasyal pa. Night owl kasi sila and we understand naman (kahit manood sila ng tv sa sala magdamag) pero dad already told them na buy your snacks ahead of time para no need na lumabas at night. Pero I think the truth of it is, dito pa lang, na turn off na si dad kay girl dahil daw parang hindi galawan ng matinong babae dahil nag se-stay over sa bahay ng lalaki. My dad is the traditional type kasi.
2. Ang weirdest is kahit hindi day off ni girl andito sya sa bahay naka tambay after shift nila; dito na nag be-breakfast and lunch. Halos everyday na talaga and nag wa-wonder na kami if may bahay ba to? Dahil minsan nakakatulog na sila sa couch sa kakatambay sa sala (out of respect sa wishes ni dad na di pwede dalhin si girl sa kwarto. Ano ba naman magagawa ni LB? dahil dito pa sya nakatira kay dad, he has to somewhat adjust sa mga gusto ni dad.) We are wondering di ba sya hinahanap ng mom nya? May mom ba sya?
3. Si LB 10pm-7am ang regular shift (some days nagiging 11pm ang start if he needs to cover for someone). Sa times na hindi nya dinadala si GF dito sa bahay, he would drop her off 1 hour away sa call center. Si GF lives in the north at kami naman ay taga south. So this means, example, if labas ni LB sa shift is 7am at 1hr ang trip para mahatid si GF sa kanila, it will now take him 2-2.5hrs to get home sa south so parang 3.5hrs sya on the road every other day. At ito kung SAME OUT TIME SILA. If GF ends her shift later, hihintayin pa sya ni LB and this would add more time sa commute nya. He would barely have time for breakfast sa mesa when he gets home before he passes out to sleep from exhaustion. We have seen this happen so many times.
4. Because of number 3, parang kulang na ang “me” time ni LB. Before, he used to be able to play MMORPGs with his gaming buddies (at may guild pa sila which my other brother is also a member of). So alam ni other brother na parang di na nakaka unwind si LB or do the things he wants dahil lagi na lang ito either tulog or nag de-date /tambay with the GF.
5. Na notice namin na nang hihiram na si LB ng pera (sometimes he would ask for gas and other times he would say pang emergency funds daw dahil na short sya. He would sometimes borrow around 2k at never naman more than 5k) at nababayaran naman ito. We are just wondering dahil before, when dad forgets to withdraw sa bank ng cash at need nya ng cash on hand ng mabilisan, si LB ang hinihiraman ni dad mga tig 15k na sinasauli naman ni dad the next day so alam talaga namin na before he met GF, maraming savings talaga si LB. (Di kasi uso kay dad ang online banking!) Nakakapagtaka dahil kahit internet and other utilities (which we all split evenly among us siblings) na be-behind na sya sa payments. (We have 3 different ISPs dahil work from home ako at need namin back up and can you imagine the amount of screens at home? Lol) na de-delay na sya magbayad at magsasabi pa na, magbabayad na lang sya sa next sweldo nya so parang we get the feeling na he is living paycheck to paycheck. Which we never saw from him before. He used to bring home donuts or whatever or treat the nephews/nieces to a mr. DIY trip and he would splurge on games (may PS5 sya that he bought for himself.)
6. Another red flag is before, si LB, homebody sya at may pagka introvert na nerd type. He would often spend up to 5hrs gaming lang, either on his PS or PC, before he had this GF. Before his current GF, “online2x” lang ang mga naging GF nya — ung tipong virtual talaga or LDR (dahil nga di naman ito lumalabas masyado so his social circle is not huge). Ever since he met this GF though, halos almost every weekend may lakad sila na outing or dining-out or gala. They would go on these out-of-town trips at todo post si girl sa IG/FB of their travels at una, happy kami na parang our LB is coming out of his shell na and naging outdoorsy na sya. Kaya lang, napagalaman namin na nag aaway pa pala sila dahil LB would forget he has his Discord comms on and other brother would overhear them arguing sometimes in the lines of, “kakalabas lang natin yesterday ah, today na naman? Can’t I just rest muna today or play my game?” At yun, full blown away na talaga for everyone in their guild to hear. Not even sure if LB ever realized na they were overheard pero mula noon, parang nega na talaga perception sa kanya nga guildmates / barkada ni LB. 
7. The guild is made up of 60% barkada (dahil ang iba ay nasa ibang bansa na) pero those na living here locally pa, they would sometimes go on weekend outings together na para bang “all boys.” As these kinds of things go, these are no GFs allowed get-togethers either over coffee, a seaside overnight trip or a night out with the boys. (Minsan lang talaga ang night out maybe only if there is a special occasion!) So one time nag yayaan sila na dahil they haven’t gone on a camping trip for so long, mag short hike sila sa isang mountain to camp there dahil may magandang falls daw. GF begged to go with them and said if di daw sya isasama, then di nya daw papayagan sumama dun si LB. Heler? Even before kapa naging GF nya this is what him and his friends are doing. May other labas naman na with GFs na like group date or beach time pero bat mo pipilitin ang self mo sa all-male na outing? Ikaw lang babae dun? Tsaka ano gagawin mo dun eh malamang mag lalasingan ung mga yun habang naliligo in the nude sa waterfalls (hahaha!) We know na pinilit nya lang talaga self nya isama because LB asked other brother ano gagawin nya sa situation na to. He asked for advice dahil na ipit talaga sya sa loyalty nya kay GF at sa allegiance nya din sa guild. Ang ending di na sya sumama and he had to make an excuse for it. Gigil si other brother dahil alam nya na gusto talaga sana sumama ni LB pero … haaaaai
8. Nag move in na talaga si GF sa bahay! After a year of them dating and sometimes sleeping on the sofa in the afternoons or early evenings (di na namin magamit ang living room at parang nainis na nga kami dahil nag ca-cuddle sila sa sofa for everyone to see. We have young kids here so we don’t want them to see that lol) I get na tired kayo pero LB naman, bat hinayaan mo mag overstay yan dito? At ikaw naman girl, mahiya ka naman kay dad. Nag di-dinner kami a few feet away tapos ikaw naka handusay dyan sa sofa na naglalaway in an unbecoming position for a woman. Okay lang ba kayo? Eventually dad asked them dun na lang matulog sa room ni LB. Siguro napuno na din si dad at baka naawa na din kay LB because they didn’t look at all comfy sa couch.
9. Ang room ni LB is naka annex sa house, which is a separate building sa bahay. This used to be dad’s oversized store room/tool shed before he we had it cleared out so it is quite roomy to be a bedroom. Maganda pa nga dahil pinarenovate pa ni dad at ang labas nya ay parang studio type na unit with its own ensuite bathroom. This is also where the back kitchen is attached. No connecting doors papunta doon from the main house pero same gate parin ang access sa compound namin. LB made this his bedroom eventually dahil when us older siblings started having our own families after getting married, hindi na enough ang 4 bedroom house (1 bedroom is ofcourse sa kanila ng parents namin). When one of the sibs moved out dahil nag migrate na with the family, this left an extra bedroom sa bahay pero ayaw na bumalik ni LB sa loob dahil nakapag set up na sya ng magandang gaming station sa room nya. Oh diba marami sya pera before dahil he would waldas sa mga luho nya like magagandang equipment at kung ano ano pa.
10. We only realized she had moved in and was sleeping over dahil nakikita namin sa CCTV na halos araw araw syang may dalang maleta in and out sa annex at minsan na lang talaga ito umuuwi sa kanila/ or lumalabas for any length of time. Minomonitor kasi ni kuya houseboy sa cctv ung shop namin at kasama na ang compound so sya ung unang naka notice nun at nakapag comment lang kay dad. Si dad naman, hinayaan na lang sila kesa daw mag mot-mot pa ung dalawa at gusto nya talaga na we are all under one roof kumbaga at malapit sa kanya. He just likes having all of us and his grandkids altogether with him and up to now, kahit nga may work na kaming lahat at pamilyado na, he would still often give us “allowance”. Di naman sya consistent na araw2 or weekly may allowance but he would suddenly give you, “oh eto pang gas” or “here! pang mall” and ano ano pa kahit di ka naman nanghihingi. Parang tini-take advantage din ni GF that dad is so generous at parang unli-lakad or trips talaga sya na alam namin, sya ang nagpu-push na pumasyal kung saan saan. Ang mali lang dito is hindi nag formally ask for permission si LB kay dad upfront kung pwede ba dito matulog lagi si GF, until dad commented on it na napapadalas na ang stay dito ni girl at dun na nag ask si LB if okay ba na dito sya mag stay dahil daw (ehem ehem) magulo ang pamilya ni GF: lasingero daw ang tatay at nanakit pag naka inom at lagi itong nakikipag away sa asawa. We cannot validate this since we have never met the GF’s parents or got to know them at any level so we had to take GF’s word for it na lang.
11. Since di na sya hinahatid sa kanila ni LB, nag e-expect kami that they would join us for family meals. Family meals at the table are a big thing here. It’s one way everyone can gather casually and catch up on what’s happening sa mga kabuhayan ng isa’t isa and even get some news in the mix and even chika sa mga happenings sa neighborhood. LB knows this pero ever since nag move in si GF, di na namin nakikita ang fes nya. LB would just put together a huge tray of food and bring it sa annex. He eventually had the yaya do it consistently at meal times hanggang di na talaga sila mng dalawa nakikita sa main house at all at pinapahanap pa nga talaga sya ni dad to join us… may pupunta samin sa likod only to get refused: Busog daw dahil nag grab food na or kumain na sa labas. 😥 it was at this point na we had to check na lang the CCTV if si LB ba home or not. LB would make the occasional appearance sa loob if he would get special food (example, may nagdala ng something2 from outside and gusto nya) but that’s it. We had to think of ways na talaga to make him come inside. Si girl, ghost na talaga. We would see her hanging up her laundry sa cctv so we knew she was there. Lol dad was hurt dahil nagpapaluto pa nga kami ng paborito ni LB and we count them in sa pagluluto (to avoid wastefulness, saktong sakto lang talaga ang rice and ulam) pero wow, what a waste.
12. Since living together, and since they work sa same company, sabay na sila mag in and out sa work. Para bang ginawa na talaga si LB driver…? When their start times would differ, hihintayin pa talaga sya ni LB  and if her shift was earlier than his, LB would also come to work 1-2hrs ahead para lang maihatid nya. Parang walang effect talaga na may car si LB which would have meant faster/shorter/smoother commute at walang effect na they lived together. Hai… Parang mas naging mahirap life nya dahil now, it’s like may alaga sya dun sa likod ng bahay at need nya ito buhayin by bringing it food? Parang aso kasi ang ugali. Di man lang pumapasok sa loob ng bahay para mag good morning or say hi kay dad or makipag mingle sa amin. Tsk tsk! Even to just say, thank you sa free kuryente and free internet. Haha! Dretso na talaga sya as freeloader dito from the start pa lang so ekis na talaga sya in my books.
13. Si girl eventually resigned sa call center. LB stayed there dahil may spot daw sya sa pagka TLT (team lead trainee). Si GF, went without work dahil gusto daw muna magpahinga. She was like this for several months until LB asked help from us to find her work (dahil nga WFH ako nagpasuyo ng help mag apply sa company ko.. as if instantly may opening? At ma hire ka agad2? You should have thought of this ahead of time before resigning…). Dun na namin nalaman na ilang buwan na pala syang unemployed. My God girl??? Eventually she started an “ukay ukay” business. How do we know? She joined a local buy and sell FB group under a business page and nakita namin ang kwarto ni LB sa mga posts nya because she would take pics of the items being sold sa mismong bedroom ni LB. Okay naman sana mag business, so proud of you girl! Pero wag mo naman sana sagarin ang washing machine namin to the point na nagrereklamo ang yaya na parang sayo pa sila magpapahintulot kung pwede bang magwash? At wala nang room sa sampayan lollllll at makakalimutan mo pang alisin for DAYS at si yaya pa ang gagawa for youuuuu mygoodness, free washing machine and water ka na nga bat di ka na lang lumugar when you have things hanging there? Ang weird is she would do her laundry at the oddest hours too! Like 1am the washing machine would be running and the rooms na nasa back ng main house, dinig na dinig lahat pati ang pagsampay nya dahil mejo clumsy sya at di nya talaga na re-realize na IT’s THE MIDDLE OF THE FREAKIN’ NIGHT AND PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO SLEEP HERE! Eventually had to talk to LB to establish a washing schedule dahil as in, antagal talaga nya mag washing/leaving clothes hanging na tig 1week na sya parang sintigas na ng kahoy at pwede na tumayo ang tshirt on its own! Akala namin nung una marami lang talaga sya damit lolllll
14. Nag yoyoga/jumprope sya sa empty oparking slot ng garage namin at nila live feed nya loob ng garage namin tapos may pa-post pa ng “AT THE XXXXX’s RESIDENCE” girl di pa ba enough na winaragwag mo ang loob ng bahay namin na kitang kita ang gate and all, ipo-post mo pa talaga kung saan/apelyedo ng pamilya? Whyyy? We are private people and di comfortable si mama or papa na pinopost sa social media ang nga ganyan. 
15. Parang chronic liar sya. One time we left them some fried fish and rice sa table for lunch. Come 3PM, their covered plate was still there. When I messaged her on FB to ask jf they had already eaten, she said yes. But when I asked bakit hindi nakain ang fried fish, she said because di daw kasi kumakaoj ng isda si LB. When I know for a fact fave un ni LB (bangus!) at ung tiyan (the fat part!) pa nga ung gustong gusto nya at nag aagawang pa nga kami even as adults lol. Bat gagawa ka pa ng excuse like that when you can just say for example, “I actually liked the other ulam, thanks!” Edi sana okay. She was caught in a lie at di nya alam na na sense na namin na liar sya. Another time, when we asked LB to join us one weekend night to dine out (we knew he had weekends off that month), sabi ni LB di daw sya pwede dahil may shift sya. Pero ang jending nakita namin sa story ni GF na may lakad pala sila at sya na naman ang ginawang driver sa kasal na hindi man lang sya guest. Kasama pa ni GF sisters nya pumunta sa kasal and he couldn’t make it sa dinner because of the drive. WTF? Wala bang grab car? He had to make an excuse na may work sya to cover for the weird fact na he had to drive his GF and her family to a distant wedding he was not invited to? Ang sad. Ang hirap. Nakakapagod ka girl.
16. We recently learned that LB has never met the mom. Hindi daw ka close ni GF ang dad, estranged daw ito pero ang mom ang ka close nya. So we asked but haven’t you been dropping her off sa kanila before?! He said she would ask him to drop her off sa corner at wag na ipasok ang car dahil masikip ang daan and it’s just a short walk from the corner ang bahay nila. When my brother would insist, she would say wag na dahil walang tao sa kanilang bahay and it would be disrespectful for her daw to bring home her BF without anybody around. What the fk kind of excuse is that? Di naman sya papasok sa bahay mismo and he’ll only be dropping you off sa gate.
17. When we initially did a background check on her via online sleuthing, we discovered SHE HAD SEVEN FACEBOOK ACCOUNTS. 7.! It’s like every year, before she met my brother, she had a new FB account and get this… sa old accounts nya, iba iba ang BF nya. So nag ce-create new account si girl everytime she gets a new BF. Why do you have to do that??? Di man lang nya sinet to private noh? And get this… we dug up everything from all of her accounts na nakapublic post, some posts going as far back as 2015. She would post things like, “home sweet home!” And there’s a photo of a nice house na obviously pulled from Google that she was trying to pass off as her house. You think we’re that stupid? She also had, “I LOVE MY BEDROOM!” Tapos ung photo straight from a Pottery Barn catalogue. Girl don’t me, dahil dream bedroom ko din yan mga yan hahahahaha! Some of her other posts were very distasteful and giving “walker” vibes: “WHO IS OUT TONIGHT?!” “SAAN ANG HAPPENING NOW?” “AT **** TONIGHT. CARE TO JOIN ME?“ Parang ang landi? And I can’t forget: “A NICE FLOWER IS A FLOWER YOU LOVE TO SMELL. Do you like to?” Diba may innuendo? Mali pa ang grammar technically pero.. besides that parang ambastos ah?
18. And then we dug up on the exes. Turns out mag kabarkada pala ang dalawa sa ex nya because they were all in one post from one of her older accounts but in one of the newer accounts, di na kasama ang ex nya at sya na ang nag replace sa ex nya sa barkada ng guy. WTF kind of friend group is that? It’s different levels of effed up.
19. An ex of hers tried to stir up trouble sa work ni LB. The dude was waiting in the parking lot and harassed LB when he was walking and trying to get into his car. HOW DID THE EX KNOW WHICH ONE UNG CAR NI LB??? The ex threatened LB with things like, “LUMAYO KA SA KAY *** IF AYAW MO NG GULO!” good thing it did not get physical dahil it was right in front sa main door ng office and I guess that’s why timing, pero… ang scary na talaga! LB had to share this story with dad when he asked dad if he can have his old baseball bat to keep in his car. dfq?

So much pa na redflags at masyado na mahaba ang post ko. A lot of time has passed as well, so that now, I live in the same city as LB’s call center. One time gusto ko sya isurprise with his fave ulam for his lunch break… alam ko pa talaga lunch break nya and knew what time sya pwede makababa. I drove the 15mins to his place of work, gave him his lunch out the window of my car and went on my way. I had to pass his parked pickup on my drive out and nakita ko there was a bright light sa loob. I realized there was somebody sitting sa front seat na nag se-celphone. It was her. Wtf? The only time she leaves the house pala is to go with him sa place of work nya tapos tatambay sya there? In his car? Idk if whole shift ni LB pero what level of effed up is this na ba? 
Question: 
How do I let LB know, in a loving way, na parasite ang GF nya?

If only milyonaryo kami sana bibigyan na lang namin sya ng 5 million ala-korean-novela pero wala eh. So paano ba???

Previous attempts: Around 1.5 years ago, I talked to LB one on one when I happened to catch him on a very rare moment he was alone sa main house and I asked him how he was doing, if okay lang ba sya. I told him I felt like I needed to ask him dahil I can see scratches on his arms and it looked like he was in a fight. He said nag away daw sila and it got to a point na nag-abutan na and GF started scratching him. I told him don’t ever hurt her or fight back because she can use that against you. Sabi ko pwede ka nya maiblotter or ireport sa DSWD/VAWC and dun ko na nainsert, “are you happy pa ba? Servoso ba talaga kayo sa isa’t isa?” And he shrugged okay lang kami! And he laughed it off as if it wasn’t that bad. I told him mahal kita and I don’t want to see you get hurt or taken advantage of. Please know that and please understand I am coming from a place of love. We are worried about you and hope you’re definitely okay like you said.

Til now, mag 4–5 years together na ata sila and no change parin. What do we do??? Intervention na ba?

She’s an executive producer and helped Gypsy get her book deal.

1.  Gypsy says to Melissa Moore, “i would need to talk to you when you have time. it is somewhat important. I would like to talk about handling the book and podcast earnings without my parents being involved. I do not feel comfortable involving them anymore. Whatever the studio has left to send for my documentary is still fine but I no longer wish to entrust my fiances with them for future projects I’ll explain on the phone”, Gypsy also says, “I am giving Power of Attorney to Ryan to handle financial business and to be able to sign in my place. Beginning March 15 and ending December 28th.”


2.  Gypsy says to Melissa Moore, “Got the other pics, Ryan doesn't look like himself but he is the only person I know who looks different based on angles in every picture I have of him. I held it up to photos that I had the picture girl in visiting take of him based on select angles and the two look totally different. Because he is bigger shots need to come from above not lower or head on. But it is what it is. it just isn't the best likeness is all. are their better more flatterina shots?”


3.  Gypsy says to Melissa Moore, “-someone- read the book proposal to me and what I found is...without trying to be insulting, that the overall framework of words was bare boned. It reminded me of listening to Forest Gump and made me cringe. It was your very basic wording. I often use more intellectual words for example instead of saying ""People said my mom poisoned my step grandma would have said ""It was speculated that my mother had poisoned my step grandmother with RoundUp"" -someone-also uses mom and I actually rarely call my mother mom, I refer to her as mother because I now call Kristy mom. Also there were consistent repetitive words and words that should have used commas where the repetitive ands were placed.
The story read very factual however lacked emotion, texture, and emersion and to a degree intelligence. One thing everyone comments on even when living with my mother is how articulate I am with words and that did not translate with the way this reads. NOTES  \#1 My mother did not work at the hospital after I was born she took a job at a bar called PJs when I was toddler age and later took odd jobs such as photo restoration on her computer. \#2 It reads more then once that i had no participation in Mommy Dead and Dearest but I did participate in the HBO documentary Mommy Dead and Dearest, however I did not have financial compensation. and it was not a docuseries it was a single documentary. \#3 In the beginning it read ""My childhood was great but then I got sick"" Then the next paragraph reads I had x amount of surgical procedures at 11 months old."" That is contradictory to the beginning paragraph. From birth my mother claimed I was sick however as a child I at least was allowed to be more social with my mothers side and have some good memories as a child, I would not say great though. \#4 Ken and I did not mutually break up, he left me devastatingly brokenhearted. I want readers to feel the strength of the pain that I felt. After all I had gone through, I thought I had went through it to get to this person who would love me and he let me down just like everyone else in my life. -Someone- jodded down other notes of errors in grammar and proper English and pretty much the same notes. For a proposal it is ok but I do NOT want -someone-  to write the manuscript. I just can't see a whole book of this shit. it is all facts and no heart. Nothing tugged at me to make me feel anything but bored and depressed.” Gypsy also says, “I emailed -someone-  with some thoughts. it might offend her but it is my story and i am not settling.” 


4.  Melissa Moore forwards an email to Gypsy that she wrote to the ghost writer Gypsy has a problem with, which says,  “Here is what I sent to -someone- to read to you and get your notes on: Thank you for sending the proposal. I had forwarded it immediately to Gypsy before my own review of it and got a quick response from her that same day-she was deeply offended. During my own review, I dissected the proposal to understand why she had such a negative reaction. First, it mainly was due to the lack of her own voice missing in the proposal. While the writing is factual it lacks her tone and reduces her vocabulary to an elementary grade level. We assume the lack of voice comes from her interviews not being directly pulled from and injected into the writing. Second to voice, there aren't any emotional moments we enter into through the writing. There is a play-by-play of timeline events. Again factual, just not taking the opportunity to have us experience a moment in time that Gypsy lived through, so we know what she felt. The sample chapter is where this really could have shined, for example, there is a memory Gypsy has of sleeping over at her cousin's home as a child and she is jumping on the bed when her aunt walks in. Immediately, she drops to the bed in tremendous fear and freezes knowing she was caught using her legs. Now being caught, hell will be paid when her mother discovers her lapse in the act. There are many memories Gypsy has of the transition of being healthy while her mother starts to train her to be sick that could be used for the sample chapter. Instead it opens with facts lined up of her date of birth and nickname--nothing an editor couldn't Google. The sample chapter is a chance to show that this book truly has never-before-heard stories that only she could tell. Third, and the least of the issues, the Overview isn't in first person. Here is an opportunity to address the fact that while there are many documentaries and even a tv scripted series, none of them tell her true story. Her story has been adapted and stolen. Something along the lines of, ""While millions of people watched The Act, I sat in my prison cell with no access to Hulu. To this day, I haven't been able to watch the series...People were watching a show starring me! I had no involvement ...People now are thinking they know me but they don't know point 1, point 2, point 3."" This could also be an open letter to the editor stating what people don't know or the mistruths people have of her. Now having addressed all the concerns, we feel it needs a complete rewrite to add her voice and to write a sample chapter that takes us into a moment of her life. I can send all of our notes of changes but at this point Gypsy has lost faith. propose we all cut our losses and end the agreement here.”, Gypsy responds, “I completely approve of the email for -someone-. You did great!!! you can send it whenever you wish.”


5.  Gypsy says to Melissa Moore, “I was talking with Ryan and we were coming up with ideas for my first year out of prison and what are some plans we hope to do within that time span. We were thinking of things that could potentially be highlights if we enter into a second phase of our project. Here is a list of what we are thinking: (Highlights)
- Release day
- Cosmetic work
- Wedding (redo)
- Honeymoon/Vacation
- 1st baby
(Fillers) getting 1st tattoo job interviews book tour, Sitting down with parents and asking one on one questions about past.
Facing fears going back to 2103 W Volunteer Way digging up hex jar.”


6.  Melissa Moore answers Gypsy and says, “These are great ideas, however, we need to start with present day-august first. We have to show that there are things happening while in prison in prep for your release such as: \#1 difficult conversations with -Blanchard?- family; how is it going to be when you're released? \#2 Ryan’s job, how will your release affect his employment? \#3 discovering what you can and can't do post prison. Will getting a job be harder? Etc. can you get a passport? Or there extra things now you have to do.. \#4 prep for leaving people you have come to love behind in prison. From now to August is a little bit of a slower period of time but we need a few beats to make sure it sets up the action


7.  Gypsy says to Melissa Moore, “There are some unknowns at play here. I don't have anything really leading up to my release. The prison doesn't require us to take any classes for release, there is no followup hearing or evaluation it is just a waiting game. I do not foresee me having any conversations with my mother’s side of the family. My cousin -someone- made it know that they will not appreciate me speaking about the molestation by my grandfather so l am guessing that my aunts -someone- and -someone- will hold back from speaking to me until the dust settles. Ryan’s employer already is aware of our marriage and made it a point to have a zoom call with their higher upers to make them aware of our situation.
What is concerning is will there be any negative repercussions to the documentary.”


8.  Melissa Moore says to Gypsy, “I found a lot of resources for you so you can see that you'll be able to be a successful and independent person and there's a lot of help available. There is free money called grants, there's paid housing by the government that will pay for your apartment, there's food stamps. This is all to just help you start your nèe life and you won't need them long term.
Here's an example of what you could do on parole: \#1 apply to community college. Pell Grant will pay 100% of the college. \#2 apply for HUD, they will pay your apartment. \#3 apply for a part time job $17 an hour at Walmart as a stocker or associate, there's lots of other jobs too at different places. \#4 apply for state food stamps and healthcare. The state healthcare pays 100% dental and medical plus mental health. \#5 open a Capital One Bank account. Use the 360 savings. \#6 open a secured credit card. This will build you credit fast. Everyone is accepted. Use no more than 30% of the card limit at a time. As credit cards will ding you if you max out cards or use more than 50% of card limit. \#7 apply for local driving school. They can let you use driving simulators to practice before you have a car to use. Then after applying for these things look for apartments or housing. You have enough for a deposit and first months rent which is needed. Right now, you'll need to pull your credit and see what's on there. If there's fraud from your mom I’ll teach you how to fix.
Your credit is whats pulled when getting a place.”


9.  Melissa Moore gives advice to Gypsy about her diet, “On your canteen I'd make these changes: \#1 change RC Cola to diet. \#2 change sugar cubes to an artificial sweetener if they have one for your coffee. \#3 stop making your meals. Instead go to Breakfast, lunch and dinner at cafeteria. \#4 take your vitamins everyday. \#5 on your shopping list for snacks I'd only keep the popcorn because it has fiber, the peanut butter, the pickles, long grain rice and chicken. I'd pick one splurge as my max for the week either two Twix bars OR one pint of ice cream. I'd recommend not eating them first thing in morning as it will spike your blood sugar for the day. I'd go to cafeteria for ALL meals and follow this set of rules: protein, fruit, veggie. These are your always ""yes"" to eat. Heavy limit these: no white bread, no milk (because it has a lot of sugar) and no beverage (unless sugar free) no jello unless sugar free. Sugar= insulin. Insulin then turns calories into stored fat. Sugar is in white flour and of course regular sugar. They also make you automatically over eat. So eat sparingly as a treat. Example: Breakfast, fruit, rice, scrambled eggs, 2tbl diet, margarine, coffee. Skip toast, skip biscuits, skip French toast sticks. Unless whole wheat. Lunch: Eat the protein offered, the lettuce with dressing, veggie and fruit. Skip the bread, the crackers, cookies, fruit crisp. If grilled cheese sandwich is offered with soup l'd make that okay since the protein is coming from the cheese. Dinner: Skip the bread and beverage and jello that's not sugar free. The reason why I'd go to the cafeteria is that the meals offer a fruit or veggie and protein sources that are portion controlled for you and offer more than your canteen food. You may crave sugar or get headaches since you've had so much of it. But you'll have more energy once your body…”


10.  Gypsy says to Melissa Moore, “I'm watching this CNN documentary about Brittney Spears and the conservatorship she is under and I feel so much sympathy for her because I know what its like to be controlled and when Brittney talks about it, I feel her emotions because I felt that helpless feeling of being controlled and having a parent have paperwork saying that the parent has every right to control your life and you can't do a damn thing about it because everyone deems and sees you as mentally unstable or incompetent. It makes me so sad for her”


11.  Gypsy says to Melissa Moore, “So my current beliefs are centered around nature, karma and willpower. I came by paganism/Wicca, by means of an old roommate and friend of mine. She introduced me to it and I felt it was right for me. I wanted a natured based religion that believes in karma, good engery and bad engery. I feel your fate is in your hands rather then my previous Christian belief that all your life is been written by God already. I have the belief that if you don't like your fate, then change it because life is made of choices. Some would say I'm fated to turn out like my mother because of her life choices affected how I was raised, I say I make my own fate and change that because its in my hands and power to do so. That isn't to say I don't believe in God, I do believe there is a God, I just also believe in self willpower to steer your life in the direction you wanna go. I started learning about Wicca in late December 2020. I attend wicca service on Mondays. how I practice my religious belief? by allowing myself to let go of bad engery and allowing myself to give out positive engery toward others to introduce good karma to me. I often meditate and read tarot cards to guide my day and pull revelations about my life.
No, I have never cursed anyone, I would never do that to someone. Yes, I have attempted a love spell. It was in 2013 I created a spell to bind Nick and I together as lovers so he would never leave me in an attempt to cancel out my mother’s curse on me. I asked Nick to send me a lock of his hair and he did. I took a strand of his hair and I short strand of mine when my mother cut my hair routinely, and I twisted the two together and enclosed it in a photo of me and a photo of him and wrapped it in red yarn. The willpower of this spell was broken when I wrote to Nick after he was sentenced and he wrote wanting to get back together, I rejected him and with closure the spell ended, and he was free to have new relationships. Curses and spells are like wishes or a prayer for something to happen it is called manifestation, and the karma you put in is how powerful it can be.”


12.  Gypsy says to Melissa Moore, “9 in the morning and 9 at night was med time. I was on a med that had a purple tent to it and made me sleepy. The medicine i was allergic to, had looked and smelled syrupy like pancake syrup...thats probably why i hate a lot of syrup on my pancakes today lol :-P “


13.  Melissa Moore said to Gypsy, “This is really good insight!! Very helpful! Please walk through normal fears she had and how she operated. Did she always answer the door? At home did you ever run, or walk around house? Tell me ahout her shoplifting and what she would steal”, Gypsy says, “No, she rarely answered the door unless it was expected company. She would let the person knock and knock and pretend not to be there even though her van was parked in the driveway. sometimes she would drive the van to another spot to appear like we weren't home. Our house looked like a horder house all the time unless she knew company was coming over. Her fears ranged from Lizards as a basic normal fear, to abnormal fears like me being in my own room for too long.
A few times she caught me on my computer while I was in my room so after catching me talking to people on Facebook on the computer, she didn't trust me enough to spend anytime in my own room. By 2015 I was limited to changing my clothes in my room and that's it, she would time how long it would take to change clothes and she would get up off her bed to check on what I was doing If I took a little too long in my room. she placed a reversed lock on my door so it had the lock on the outside of the door and I would have to ask her to unlock it so I could get dressed in my room. No I didn't walk or run around the house if she was home, but when she wasn't home, I would walk and dance too. we had a CD player and I would listen to music that was forbidden like Katy Perry and dance. She didn't let me listen to pop artists because she said that was too little for the adult content in the lyrics. (I was 22 years old) As for shoplifting, we would go to Sams club or walmart and she would put me in the basket cart and she told me to slip things under my dress and sit on them. I did and we would steal so much stuff, like dvds, clothes, food, hygiene products. She sometimes would have me steal dvds and she would go resell them at a local video buy sell trade shop.”, Gypsy adds, “BTW she never shoplifted alone she needed me to be the one to use my wheelchair as a means to hide things.”, Gypsy continues, “I'm going to be writing you things I remember because lately my memories are clear as day, So they may be random emails but I'm writing what I can give you as it comes. When my mother and were living in the Slidell Housing complex, in 2004/2005, my mom had a neighbor she would sell her prescription medicine to for extra money. She started selling her weight loss pills but then she started selling her pain pills and xanax. This neighbor told other people in the complex, so she had more than one buyer. In 2015 my mother stole money from our neighbor Debby Akers, after Debby trusted my mom to put the money Debby made after doing a experimental trial for one of those companies that pay you to be a volunteer for a new drug or product, Debby knew mom had a safe and so Debby asked mom to put the 2k in the safe for her...mom agreed but stole a few hundred from the money. and when Debby realized the money was missing, mom played it off like it must have been Debbys disturbed older son”


14.  Gypsy says to Melissa Moore, “No my father and I never took a paternity test as it was never needed or asked for.
No, no one has investigated me for the fraud because it was clear in paperwork that it was always my mother who filled out the paperwork for everything.”, “Gypsy says, “I'm watching Accused Guilty or Innocent on AandE about a mother accused of MBP and its crazy to me how serious they take it and yet no one did anything for me. I'm starting to see just how much I slipped through the cracks....not like I didn't already know but its it weird find it mind boggling how much trouble she could have been in? to me she was the only mother like that and she got away with it until she died. How did the doctors not see it... I'm sorry I'm just thinking that's all”, Gypsy says, “oh did you see the new In Touch article Fancy did?
It was read to me and the whole article is BS. I had 1, only 1 relationship after Ken she's saying I date multiple men Ryan is furious about it. He texted -someone-! wanting her to contact In Touch to tell that journalist to not take any interviews from her again. -someone- refused. I can understand how Ryan would be pissed, she is slandering him. He never used me for money, in fact HE would send ME $300 a month for 2 years and never did an interview with anyone. So her claims are only her opinion off and the
relationship. She never liked him because he called her out as a con artist. She's had a vendetta ever since. My point is I'm a grown adult, even if I was having multiple men at my side, who cares... still haven't had a real date in my whole life so if her goal was to make me look like a huchie or ""unstable""....It won't work because people who know me know that broke my heart enough to where I am still not yet healed from that break up. Nothing she said added up, because in late August of 2019 I did that Enews interview talking about how yes, me and Ken were having issues due to massive media attention, but we were strong in our relationship. so the claim in this new article that I dumped him in August doesn't make sense. October 2nd was the actual date of our split. Anyway, it is irritating that she claims to be a family friend when we all have broken ties with her yet the media don't know..”, Gypsy says, “I had remembered a faded memory from when I was very little maybe 5, mom had a friend named Mark. He liked her and he fixed a room at his place for her and I. I didn't like him and so I spit on him. I only wanted my dad and mom to get back together and I was not happy with any guy that liked her otherwise. I sometimes feel like I deserved what happened because I guess if I wasn't happy with her being with another man and dad moved on with Kristy then she felt I was stopping her from having a life with anyone else so her focus was on me. My mom did love another man besides my dad. His name was -someone-, he is married now, but she loved him”, Gypsy says, “I wanted to write down anything I can remember about anything and I remember my mother disabled the doorbell on our Habitat house after the people from DFS came to the house, she said the sound was giving her anxiety.” Gypsy says, “ I remember something else...When I had to give a urine sample at the doctors, I'd pee in a cup but my mother would take it and prick her finger and add a drop of blood to the sample. Why? I don't know... it’s just another weird thing.”",3,1763927574.0,GRBSnarkBU,2,1.0,False

It was a difficult process, but I succeeded to be caffeine free for \~5-6 months. I then got a new job that was/is extremely intense. So many hours, very high stress. I work at a tech start up in sales.

  
A few things I noticed when I was caffeine free: better skin (more hydrated), more vivid dreams, not needing to rely on a drug every morning was nice, I think I had lower cortisol (though, I can't prove it), didn't have to pee 100 times a day.

  
One thing to note: I did rely heavily on decaf coffee and decaf tea throughout the entire time  I was caffeine free. I used coffee beans that were decaffeinated by the swiss water method to reduce the chemicals I was exposed to. Overall, this worked well for me because I still had the ritual, without the actual caffeine. 

  
I am now considering going caffeine free again over the holidays. I currently drink 2-3 strong cups of coffee a day, and was thinking of tapering to 1 a day, then slowly tapering to 1/2 cup, and so on.

1p4w2hb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p4w2hb/aitah_for_telling_my_supervisor_that_she_needs_to/,AITAH for telling my supervisor that she needs to mind her own business?,"I’m 17 years old and I work as a dietary aide in a private retirement home. I’ve never had any issues with the job. It’s a very nice place so I get paid 17 and hour, which is amazing for my very first job, and I also want to get into nursing when I’m older so I think having a job that’s considered health care is good for me.

I’ve worked here since a little before I turned 16, and I work about 24 hours a week.

I have three supervisors. One for the 6-2:30 shift, and then two for the 11-7:30 shift. One of them just got promoted to supervisor so until recently I only had two.

All in all, it’s been a good place to work. My coworkers are all nice and there’s surprisingly a lot of minors, so I’ve made a couple of friends through work. A lot of the kids I go to school with work there, so I was familiar with people in my first day which made the job seem a lot easier.

Two things I have to mention for this post two make sense are:

One, I’m a very shy and quiet and private person. It took me a while to make the couple friends I made through the job. My first couple months I only really talked to coworkers when spoken to, and I was quite shy when talking to and serving residents. I’ve simply always been quiet and shy, though I will say having a job that requires constant interaction with lot did different people has helped me open up more.

Two, I struggle with an eating disorder and I have for the last six months. I honestly struggled before that, but recently it’s been more difficult. I go to therapy and such but anyone who’s ever struggle with any kind of eating disorder knows it’s very difficult.

The other day I was working 11-7:30 because it was an inservice day at my school so I picked up an 8 hour shift. 

I went on lunch about 2:00, and when I came back, I overheard one of my supervisors and an older coworker of mine talking.

I had no intentions of eaves dropping, in fact I had headphones in because my supervisor has never minded if we have them in while there’s no residents in the dining room, and between the time of the 6-2:30 people leaving and the 4-8 people coming in, there’s stuff to do in the downing room like roll silverware, vacuum, prep fruit bowls and dessert, just small things like that that the mid shifters do after tables are bussed and reset, so my supervisor doesn’t mind if we listen to music or something while doing everything, as long as it is done.

Normally we have two first shift people, two second shift people, and two third shift people per didn’t room (it’s a five floor building and there’s five dining rooms)

But this we had three people on third shift and I was the only mid shift, which was fine because it meant we had an extra closer.

So I was coming back from lunch and I overheard my supervisor and the coworker say my name. Again I had no intentions of listen to them or anything, I was just going to start doing my prep work since our silverware wasn’t washed yet, but then I’d heard my supervisor say something that made me pause.

She said, “Yeah, I think that girl has some kind of eating disorder, I never see her eat a thing.”

To of which my coworker laughed a bit and then said “Probably so.”

It is true that I don’t really eat at work, mostly because I hate eating in front of people, but still. In my mind it’s not really their business?

My supervisor showing concern and talking to me privately would be one thing, but talking about it with another coworker seems wrong to me.

Also, that sentence didn’t just come out of nowhere. Obviously they were taking about me before in order for it to come up.

I just proceeded to walk through the dining room to the kitchenette in the back where we keep the fruit and dessert we prep for the meals and all the juice and coffee machines and what not.

I didn’t expect her to say anything to me, just assume that I couldn’t hear her because of my headphones, but she came to the back and said “oh I didn’t realize you were back from break already.”

I just kept my head down and started plating the fruit I got from the main kitchen, not looking at her when I said. “Yeah, and I’d appreciate if you don’t talk about me to other coworkers, especially about my personal situations.”

She immediately denied it and said she was taking about how I did well during lunch for there only being two of us that day.

I told her that I heard what she said, and that she needs to mind her own business because she truly knows nothing about me.

She told me I heard her wrong and to not be disrespectful before she left.

I just continued what I was doing.

I’ve always been very respectful towards her, and I’m someone who hates confrontation, but this just seemed wrong to me. I definitely see now that I could have been more respectful and polite, but the truth is that I don’t like this supervisor despite being respectful.

My other two are great. This one? She constantly complains about the residents and the fact she has to go to other floors to check on the other employees, she’ll disappear when we need help with something and turns into she’ll be out smoking, then she’ll come and tells us to stop standing around because she’s the one who gets into trouble for us not working even though we’ve completed everything and we’re just waiting for her to check us out (we have these little checklists for each shift and she’s supposed to “check us out” before we go to make sure everyone completed all their tasks) and there’s plenty of other things that just make her not a great supervisor.

She told one of my coworkers (a guy I already knew from school and he’s a good friend of mine) when he as talking about the fact he went to homecoming with a guy that she “knew he was gay because he doesn’t act very manly”. He just laughed it off, but later texted me saying he thought it was rude.

Another time one of my coworkers (also a friend of mine through school) made a small comment to me about a dress she got being too small for her because she was fat, and my supervisor said “I’m so glad I don’t struggle with my weight at all.” Which for one upset my friend and for two seemed weird to me because as an adult you should be quick to tell a teenager “oh no you’re not” or something like that. At least that’s how I see it.

She also changes our shifts without telling us. I was supposed to work 6-2:30 for thanksgiving and now I’m working a 11-7:30. She didn’t even ask me about it. Another time I knew for a fact I was working Tuesday and not Wednesday but then the next then I checked it, I was on the schedule for Wednesday even though I’d already traded with a friend because I needed that night off and she needed the Tuesday off, yet we were switched.

Anyway, I half expected to get in trouble for talking to her that way, but she hasn’t said anything to me.

The coworker she was talking to (who’s also an adult, not my age) has been nicer than usual even though she’s half pretty rude. I worked mornings with her when I first started and she gave me no instructions, just did everything and then told my boss I didn’t do any work. She also busses our tables and complains we don’t don’t even though she didn’t even give us the chance, she goes on break without finishing her tables and expects us to reset them for her when she just leaves, and complaint if she runs food to our section even though if we see any plates in the kitchen, we’re supposed to run them regardless of sections. You can tell she’s just someone who doesn’t like working on a team.

I really do hate confrontation and i definitely don’t want to be in my supervisors bad side, especially since I work with this one most often, but it just felt like a strange thing to say and kind of upset me considering I already know I struggle.

But I don’t know I guess. Maybe in jsut being dramatic about it. Is what she said true? Yes. But I still feel like it isn’t her business, especially to just talk about with a coworker and as a supervisor. 
 
And I truly am a respectful and kind person, she’s still my supervisor and an adult, but i also knew how to stand up for myself and I know right from wrong, and this seemed wrong to me?

I am a 32F and I have been battling BPPV for about 4-5 years.

When it first happened I woke up and could not walk the room was spinning violently 
Went to my primary doc at the time and he did the physical maneuver to get the crystals back in place. Didn't work the first time and had to go back and it did the second time. This was 4-5 years ago.

Since then. 

I kinda know my ""triggers"" 
1. Laying on my right side 
2. Laying on my back
3. Might be TMI but lately there have been a few times when intimate I can't roll to my back or roll over so to speak, I can't have my head at strange angles, no tilting head fully backwards either.

This BPPV has been getting worse and worse and has been crippling me in many ways. Afraid to lay wrong to cuddle or sleep, or being intimate. My partner was playing around and wrestled me to the back but to my back and back of head flat down..when I got up, I grabbed his shirt due to how Violent the room spun. I vomited and it's been 24 hours since I can't look to my right or up or down without a strong wave coming over me.

I have tried Vit D and Magnesium but get bad at taking them religiously. Is there a certain amount of days to take them? Do they have to be every day?

My diet sadly isn't the greatest and I'm trying to fix that after some research about sodium and caffeine levels. I don't drink energy drinks or coffee just an occasional soda once in a while.

I just really really need some advice on how to win this, it's crippling. 

Has anyone been to a Vestibular Therapist? What do they do to diagnose? Could you tell me your experience.

Any.... Any advice or guidance will be helpful. I've read so many also battle this awful issue, I wish everyday it would go away and I could live normally and not have to worry about how I lay, or having an episode. They are so violet and the vomiting is always shortly after...

Thank you so very much for taking time to read this post.

This group has inspired me a great deal, so I wanted to share another one of my escape rooms.  Maybe spark some useful ideas for someone else.  

Opening story…

You’ve come to our house to enjoy game night; however, we have a pesky mouse lurking about.  We call him Whiskers.  Look, to be honest; that no-good mouse is wreaking havoc and ruining everything.  Your mission if you decide to accept it is to track and apprehend this mischievous fellow.  You will have one hour to build a mouse trap and catch the mouse before the entire evening is ruined.  Can you outsmart this little critter or fall prey to his cunningness that allows him to thrive and survive.  You win together or you lose together!

When players enter the room, the first game they should play is the Game Wheel, players must find the disks around the room and place them on the pegboard (there are numbers on the pegboard and on the back of each disk so players knew where to place them correctly).  Players must figure out all the touching images that match. In the room they will also find a picture clue.  This points them to which images that match and how many times they match.  This gives them the first lock combination.

When they open the box, they received the next clue and players must look for “Water Works” on the Monopoly board hanging on the wall.  The price for that is $150 which translates to the next combination lock.

When players open the box, they receive the first set of pieces to a Mouse Trap game (board is on the coffee table) along with the first three steps to build the trap.  Players also receive the next clue with a red reveal filter.

Players must use the red reveal filter over the cards on a Jumanji board hanging on the wall.  The picture key lets them know which cards that pertain to the next clue.

The cards read as… 7=This will not be an easy mission. The mouse will slow the expedition.  9= You’re almost there, with much at stake.  Hurry along before he eats our cheesecake! 3=His teeth are sharp; he likes your garbage waste.  Your team better move posthaste. 8=Need a hand? Why just you wait.  We’ll help you out with some bait. The result gives players the combo for the next box.

This box contains more trap pieces, a cipher wheel and a magnet.

[Box 3](https://preview.redd.it/lkuketiu523g1.png?width=307&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b669f189f7261f8c2d480cc6ea8c7e303967261)

By this time, players would have found a Planchette in the room; and used it over the Ouija board to get a Cipher Key (Q-8). Magnets were used on the back of the board and under the planchette.

The tiles will spell out CAT.  Then players must use those letters on the cipher wheel to convert to numbers using the pass-code found on the Ouija Board; giving them a 3-digit code.

The next box contains more trap pieces and some Grid Tiles (others grid tiles were found in the room).

The game played out successfully. Players built the mouse trap as they received the pieces.  At the end, some were able to have the cage fall down to trap the mouse, others were not so successful.

This is the shower head of my Aiden brewer. Felt some crunchiness when switching shower head modes, took it off and noticed what I thought was just coffee fines in this crevice. When I started wiping it flakes of metal started coming off and I realized it was rust not coffee. I’m assuming this is how the machine senses which setting your on. There is no gasket in this part which seems to allow steam to get up in there. Additionally I’m noticing micro fissures in the plastic coming away from the shower holes. This can’t be good for the longevity of the machine and might eventually harbor bacteria.

My question is two parts, is this happening to anyone else? And, is there an aftermarket components for the Aiden available anywhere or if there’s a database of scans of components that could be sent somewhere and made of metal on a CNC machine?

So, Lena's plan to get rid of Brad – our life draining, employee murdering, self-appointed manager – was to host an office holiday party.

And not just the ‘normal’ run of the mill kind of office party, filled with questionable food and awkward conversation.

No, because ever since I saved a customer from having most of his flesh repossessed, my life has been very decidedly non-normal. (He's doing really well by the way! Well, physically… the last time I checked in on him he said he still has nightmares about ‘monsters breaking into his home and trying to peel his skin off’ – which is fair.)

So, my non-normal workplace holiday party would consist of questionable food, awkward conversation, and trying to push our interim supervisor into a nightmare dimension from which there is no return.

Because, this party would be taking place in the sub-basement office.

The one where back in the day, a gaping wound in reality opened without warning, and took half the staff with it before it could be closed.

Our old boss, E’lj Ny~~t~~h’e the Devourer, had moved everyone to our current location afterwards – apparently the occasional disembodied scream of the lost employees that echoed through the cubicles and the beads of blood-condensation that would form on the wall, weren't great for office morale.

After failing to come up with anything better, our plan was that we'd lure Brad down to the sub-basement under the guise of a workplace party. We'd position ourselves out of danger, and open the portal when Brad was close enough to go be pulled through. Once the office was Brad free, we'd close it again.

We'd designated the location where we needed Brad to stand as the ‘doom-zone’ – an area that P’uy̓ám had calculated down to the inches, based on the radius of prior destruction and old blood spatters.

P’uy̓ám had been the one to figure out how to close the portal during that ‘incident’ back in the day, something he beat himself up over not being fast enough on. I found it impressive that he'd discovered it while hunkered down while trying to stay safe from being pulled in violently, in a time before solutions (supernatural and otherwise) were a mere googling away.

He definitely still has some survivor's guilt, though.

Opening it, however, would be another thing entirely. Neither Sandy, Lena, or P’uy̓ám knew what caused it to open on the first place – it could've been an employee's call-ritual gone terribly wrong, the revenge of an especially spiteful customer, or totally random (new fear unlocked),

(When I asked Sandy how often portals tend to manifest out of nowhere and pull shreds of our reality and its inhabitants into a hellscape, She’d patted me on the shoulder. 

“Oh, you shouldn't worry hon, not that often.” before adding after a thoughtful silence, “Although, more often than you'd think.”)

We'd begun drafting our plan during our BradTaskforce™ meeting/game night. 

I put together some notes so we could review – and hopefully address – possible issues.

P’uy̓ám said he'd need some time to reverse engineer the cause in order to figure out how to open the portal at will – I had the utmost faith in him, so I put a check by the ‘Open portal’ note I'd made.

We also needed to make sure we weren't at risk of being pulled ourselves. Lena and Keith had apparently had a thing for rock climbing (I never would've guessed that one) so she'd bring gear we could use to harness ourselves to a load bearing wall – the risk of bringing the building down with us, we hoped wouldn't be tested. I put a checkmark near ‘don’t die’

Then I'd asked how we'd get Brad to approve the party. Sandy said we would claim it was an annual (and mandatory) tradition, while lamenting how in prior years, it'd been absolutely awful. She'd tell stories of pitiful decorations, awkward extended silences broken only by the same song played on repeat, terrible food – the sort of things Brad would find delightful. ‘Brad approves’ – check.

“What if we can't get him close enough, though?” I'd asked next.

“Then I'll drag him over there and push him in myself.” Lena had snarled, with an intensity I'd never heard from her (and that's really saying something).

Sandy gently reminded her that she'd never be able to do so and survive – at ‘best’ he'd take her with him. 

At worst…well, we didn't even want to think about that.

We sat there in a few minutes of awkward silence before Sandy spoke up. She said that if it came to it, she could possess him and walk him over to the doom-zone, after which she'd jump back into her current body.

That didn't come without risks, either – possessing an unwilling vessel – especially an entity as resilient as Brad, would be difficult, she informed us. The risk of her losing control would increase substantially the longer she'd possessed him, so we needed to get him as close as possible first.

Sandy had quietly insisted that she ask Diane, referring to her willing vessel – the body she was currently inhabiting, first. She told us that if something went wrong and Sandy couldn't rejoin her, Diane would succumb to her illness and wouldn't last more than a couple of weeks.

Lena, P’uy̓ám and I watched as Sandy seemed to be having some sort of internal debate.

“Well, Okay. Diane agrees .” she'd said, finally.

I put a tentative check near ‘Brad goes into portal’

For the next few nights P’uy̓ám mused over how to open the portal (which consisted of him muttering to himself, while taking notes and flipping through several books at once), while the rest of us discussed options for staying alive in the meantime.

We tried to protect our coworkers the best we could – when someone seemed on the verge of breaking down, Lena would summon them into her office to review their direct deposit form, or I'd ask them a random question about a customer. (P’uy̓ám volunteered to distract people by telling them that he needed to install an update on their computer, but I told him that may actually cause more distress). It was a delicate balance of keeping Brad sated and everyone alive, while not betraying our plans.

But Brad seemed to just up his game to adjust – we figured he'd probably had several centuries of practice at tormenting others.

And then, a few days later, as P’uy̓ám and I were getting ready for work together at his place, he was in the middle of tying his hair back, when I heard him exclaim “OH! I'VE GOT IT”

He proceeded to detail it to me, as I nodded along, glad I'd never be expected to actually perform any of it.

“When can we start?” I'd asked 

“As soon as we have enough blood.” P’uy̓ám smiled.

I looked through the list we'd written out, and other than the several liters of blood, the rest of the supplies were (concerningly) things we had laying around the office.

At work that day, Sandy had presented Brad with a messily hand written flyer regarding the party. I'd leaned back in my chair, trying to nonchalantly watch. 

Sandy exited his office and gave me a smile and small nod.

The party was on.

That night, we got together at Sandy's, to finalize our plans, while P’uy̓ám explained the ritual to open the portal.

“I can get you blood. How much do we need?” Lena asked.

When P’uy̓ám gently reminded her it needed to be willingly given, she just sighed.

We'd decided that I'd help ‘decorate’ – which consisted mostly of lurking by the top of the stairs, acting as a lookout while Lena and P’uy̓ám made the needed preparations to open (and later close) the portal.

Sandy would keep an eye on Brad as they did so.

Once he was in position in the doom-zone (which was basically anywhere within ten feet of the east-most wall) – and everyone else was a safe distance away, P’uy̓ám would open the portal.

If everything went as planned, once Brad was pulled into whatever horror dimension lay on the other side, both P’uy̓ám and Lena were prepared to perform the ritual to close the portal – a contingency if something happened to one of them.

“So, how do we know Brad can't just reopen the portal from the other side, and come back hungrier, and shittier?” I'd asked at the grocery store the next night, as we shopped for party supplies.

Sandy and Lena were down the next aisle meticulously picking out the tackiest decorations possible – Lena hissed at some poor lady that made the mistake of reaching for the same green streamers as her.

“Wherever it does lead, there doesn't seem to be a way to open it from the other side.” P’uy̓ám sighed sadly,  “Something our late coworkers could attest to.”

We had the weekend to finalize our preparations (or in my case, to become a festering pile of anxiety). That Saturday we’d gathered at Sandy’s place, and I stared off into space, trying not to think about any of us dying, as P’uy̓ám and Lena reviewed the steps for the ritual. 

Seeing how on edge I was, Sandy grabbed her keys and proposed that she and I partake in her favorite activity (and yes, I did find it ominous that she didn't specify what exactly said activity was). I cautiously agreed when she assured me that no, *we* wouldn’t be in any danger – and when I looked back to P’uy̓ám, who gave me an encouraging smile and thumbs up.

So after giving P’uy̓ám a hug and Lena a wave that she did not return, (unless a glare counts?) – I followed Sandy down to her minivan.

“Hey, what’s that thing?” I gestured to the thick piece of wood in the backseat, which had taken the place of her usual bedazzled, nail studded baseball bat. I took in the details, handles in the middle, each end decoratively wrapped in some sort of metal, slightly dented, slightly… bloody?

“That’s my barter-ing ram.” She smiled as she gestured for me to get in the passenger’s side – and before I could confirm that I hadn't misheard her, she added, “We’re going garage sale-ing.”

–

“That's ridiculous.” She muttered, gesturing at the porcelain figurine of a dolphin. I’d shown her how to do an image search a few weeks back and she was using it to find the suggested price ($5), which was $25 dollars less than they were asking. 

She’d shown the guy selling it the online valuation, and wanted to trade him a small dagger, which she insisted was a good deal since the dagger was worth $15. She argued that after the inevitable collapse of human society, he'd have more use for a dagger than worthless paper currency, but he was less than impressed.

“Yeah, well if you think I'm accepting anything other than $30 in cash you’re crazy, lady.” he laughed – at first likely unmoved by her innocuous appearance, ridiculous sweater, and sweet, Midwestern accented voice – although his smile faded as his eyes met hers. I'm guessing he got a full dose of the look that had me terrified of Sandy the first time I met her as my shift supervisor at work (and that I still tried to avoid when I could.) 

That look that said “I’ve killed before, and you can bet your ass I'm about to do it again.”

“Mikayla,” She growled through gritted teeth, handing me her keys while still never breaking eye contact, “Please go retrieve my barter-ing ram.”

Garage sale guy's eyes widened slightly at that.

“The big weapon thing in the back seat, with the blood on it, right?” I confirmed, hoping the description alone would avert any violence (and I wouldn't *actually* have to heft it around.)

Turns out he was more than happy to trade – I guess whatever he saw in her eyes, the fact that she nonchalantly carried a dagger in her sequined purse, and the mention of a ‘barter-ing ram’ sealed the deal.

Sandy left him with a smile and the supposedly-worth-$15-dagger in his still quivering outstretched palm – she told him to keep the change.

(I couldn't help but wonder what purpose a dolphin figurine would serve in the aforementioned inevitable collapse of human society, but I just didn't feel like pressing that subject at the time.)

At our next stop, we'd found a karaoke machine. The seller apologetically warned us it was pre-loaded with terrible songs that couldn't be changed, and that it made an audible whine while in use – Sandy and I agreed it would be perfect for the party. The lady selling it was so nice, I didn't want Sandy to try and use her barter-ing ram, so I insisted I pay.

Two hours, ten garage sales, and one additional threat of violence later, we returned back to her place, where P’uy̓ám and Lena were still reviewing the rituals.

Sandy had also accumulated little knicknacks for all of us, a few indoor gardening supplies for me, a pack of old, unused floppy disks for P’uy̓ám, and a chipped ceramic mug for Lena that said ‘World’s #1 Grandpa’ – I was fairly certain that if *I* ever gave Lena a mug that said ‘World’s #1 Grandpa’, she’d bludgeon me with it, followed by stabbing me with the shards of the handle. But to my surprise, she accepted it with a smile.

I'd asked if there was anything else I could help with besides ‘decorating’ – I found my one delegated task mildly embarrassing.

“I have something else you could do.” Lena smiled. “Bleed into this” she held out a goblet in one hand, and a knife in the other. “About four liters.”

I looked at her suspiciously and then at P’uy̓ám who shook his head, “We’re *all* supposed to be contributing.”

Lena sighed, apparently disappointed and then started us off, her blood a cobalt blue-black.

After a totally normal weekend of bleeding into a container, P’uy̓ám stayed over Sunday and helped ease my anxiety by showing me a reassuring spreadsheet he'd put together while we watched a show about tiny houses together. 

And then, there we were. The morning of the party. 

I tried to stay calm and nonchalant, but appreciated that P’uy̓ám and Sandy stopped by every so often to give me a reassuring look.

Lena had poured her gas station coffee into her ‘World’s #1 Grandpa’ mug and was sipping it in her office like it was fine champagne in a crystal flute.

Oh and Sandy really outdid herself with her sweater – it featured three wolves howling at a giant wreath, with ‘HAPPY HOWLIDAYS!’ written in sequins above it.

If you're wondering if each of the wolves were also wearing tiny sequined sweaters of their own – yes. Yes they were.

Luckily, my morning calls helped the time fly by more quickly.

The first few were pretty unremarkable – although I sometimes feel a bit guilty when customers want to speak to our old boss – the real one, the entity that devours worlds and not just emotions, and I have to lie to them. I do get the feeling that the threat of him devouring them, their loved ones, and their reality as they know it, was one of the only things keeping some of them in line, so I just tell them that he's in the bathroom. So far, none of the non-human entities hailing from other planes of existence seemed to have any concept of what that means (or that it's not normal for someone to literally *always* be in there).

My third call actually managed to distract me from my Brad situation, which is *saying something*. The customer calmly made their payment without any complaint, but then proceeded to ask a lot of weird questions – such as if I'd ever had any dental work done or had any birthmarks, tattoos or other ‘identifying features’.  

Then, 12 PM hit and it was time to initiate phase I of the plan.

I waited at the top of the stairs – in case Brad was onto us or just randomly decided to wander through the electric closet in the women's bathroom of his own accord. (You never know with that guy) While Lena cleaned off the old seal of symbols and shapes on the wall, P’uy̓ám installed the harnesses.

I tried to make those look a bit less conspicuous by hanging some sparkly candy cane garland over them.

The first phase of the plan completed, I went back to my desk, only to find Brad sitting in my chair.

“You've been gone for 27.34 minutes, Madeline.” He spun to face me, an odd little smile on his face

It was during my lunch, and I was decorating for the office party that *he'd* approved – I was debating which one of those totally accurate non-excuses was the best reply as he grinned widely – too widely.

“That's another strike.”

That's when I first noticed that he was holding something – something that made me wish I had a barter-ing ram handy.

A pink slip.

Try again or silently leave forever,"I’m a 19(M) year old student. A year ago, I met a 24(F) year old woman who was teaching me German. At first, it was just normal “student–teacher” interaction. But over time, the way we looked at each other changed.

She noticed small things about me, laughed a lot when I was around, kept catching my gaze. When she stopped teaching my class, I finally asked her out. She didn’t hesitate and gave me her number right away. We had a great evening together: coffee, a walk in the park. It felt like the perfect beginning.

But then things got confusing. She would pull me close, then suddenly disappear saying she was too busy. She said she only wanted to be friends, yet acted like so much more: hugging me, texting “good night, my love,” talking about the future, about trips we’d take together. I wanted to trust it, but the uncertainty was destroying me. I lost 5 kg in the first month from stress alone.

We eventually started seeing each other more often, about 1–2 times per week. I gave her small gifts and paid for restaurants when I could, even though I lived very modestly. She opened up to me, shared personal things. It felt like we were inches away from becoming a real couple.

After visiting her parents abroad, everything shifted again. She came back, we became closer, and we kissed for the first time. She told me she had mentioned me to her parents. Their reaction was extremely negative: she comes from a very religious Muslim family, while I’m Christian. For her, that conflict was huge.

Just when we finally reached real closeness, everything collapsed. The reason was something small: I planned to get coffee with a girl from my language course who simply wanted to hang out. I don’t see her in a romantic way at all. I recently moved to Germany, I’m introverted, and I’m just trying to make friends. But my girlfriend saw it as betrayal. She texted me that we should break up.

I panicked and ran around her neighborhood, trying to find her place. Eventually, I saw her at a tram stop. She was with another man who looked stronger and more confident than me. I still approached her, gave her flowers, hugged her. She introduced me to him as “just a student” and called him her best friend. They got off together at the next stop. She threw away the flowers as soon as I left.

Later, she said it was all too much: her parents were pressuring her, she was angry at me, and she couldn’t go against her family no matter how strongly she felt about me.

For a couple of weeks after the breakup, we still talked, but then she started pulling away harder and harder. Now she responds after 24 hours, her words feel cold and empty. She hasn’t texted first in five months.

It’s been half a year. I finally decided to stop. I want my life back, to not depend on someone who has already left. But her image still haunts me. Some nights I lie awake thinking maybe it really was fate.

I still don’t know what we had.
Was it real love?
Or was I just a temporary comfort while she didn’t want to be alone?

1p4vtf3,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1p4vtf3/artificial_leverage_speculative_fiction_for_a/,Artificial Leverage (Speculative Fiction for a Possible Future),"# Part I: The Loop

On the morning I first saw the building, the desert wind was pushing dust across a row of steel frames that looked like the ribs of a whale carcass. If you were passing by on the highway, you might mistake the site for another unfinished commercial park. But inside the fence was the humming core of what Silicon Valley now calls the future. A future that, depending on who you ask, is either worth trillions or nothing at all. On that morning, it was worth exactly the amount of money the banks were willing to imagine.

A young founder was leading me through the half-built maze. He was in his twenties, all conviction and caffeine, the kind of kid who seemed to speak in forward momentum. He gestured at the rows of racks waiting for hardware, each one tagged with a name that belonged in a physics lab rather than a construction site. These racks, he told me, would house GPUs that cost more per unit than the average Americans first car. He talked about compute like a kind of cosmic force. More compute meant more models. More models meant more customers. More customers meant more revenue. And revenue, in this business, meant the ability to borrow even more money.

He mentioned the companies upcoming purchase order like he was describing weather. Billions of dollars of machinery. Delivery windows measured in weeks, not months. Financing already lined up. And when I asked if this all depended on the next version of the chips arriving on schedule, his answer came so fast it sounded like reflex. It had to. If the next generation slipped, the revenue wouldn't arrive in time to justify the loans. If the revenue didn't arrive, the loans wouldn't roll. If the loans didn't roll, the company wouldn't last the year.

Standing in the desert, I realized that he had casually outlined the central mechanism of the AI boom. Borrow money to buy GPUs. Rent the GPUs. Use the rental income to claim explosive growth. Borrow against that growth to buy even more GPUs before they become obsolete. It was a kind of financial treadmill powered by the fear of standing still. Once you stepped on, you couldn't stop. Not without falling off.

The engineers talked about technological leaps. The CFOs talked about liquidity windows. The founders talked about destiny. The lenders talked about risk in the same tone you might use to talk about calories in a doughnut. Everyone knew the numbers weren't perfect, but nobody wanted to be the first to say them out loud.

One number mattered more than any other. Two trillion dollars. That was the amount one of the worlds most valuable companies planned to spend over five years to secure its place at the center of the AI universe. Two trillion, committed by a firm that makes maybe fourteen billion dollars a year in profit, depending on the cycle. The math didn't work on paper. It barely worked on the back of an envelope. But it worked in the minds of investors who believed that the future was something you built with enough debt and enough faith.

Analysts didn't question the number. They repeated it until it sounded inevitable. If a company pledged two trillion dollars, the logic went, it must know something everyone else didn't. The truth, as far as the people inside were willing to whisper, was more mundane. The bet wasn't on AI. It was on gravity. Money was pouring into AI firms. AI firms were pouring money into GPUs. GPU manufacturers were pouring money into fabrication plants. And governments were pouring subsidies into anything that looked like a national strategy. 

That two trillion dollars wasn't just a number. It was a pressure. A gravitational field pulling entire industries out of shape. Insurance companies were buying private loans tied to GPU clusters they couldn't describe. Private credit funds were lending against equipment that would lose half its value the moment a newer model shipped. Regional governments were rewriting budgets in anticipation of tax revenue that depended on energy consumption that depended on data center growth that depended on consumer behavior that depended on models that might not even be profitable.

The young founder kept walking, narrating the future as if it were already happening. His plans extended in six month intervals, each one synchronized with the expected release of new chips. If the new chips were delayed, everything slowed. If everything slowed, the lenders got nervous. If the lenders got nervous, the founders company would lose the only thing keeping it alive. He talked about scaling in a voice that made you forget scaling required cash flow. He talked about market capture in a voice that made you forget markets could change their minds.

Inside one of the containers, a lone rack was powered on. The GPUs were running a test model. They sounded like a jet engine that had been tricked into thinking it was a violin. The whole container vibrated. The founder shouted something I couldn't hear and pointed at a monitor where numbers scrolled like a slot machine. Those numbers were supposed to become revenue. At some point, they were also supposed to become profit. But for the moment, they existed mostly to reassure lenders that the next loan would not be the last.

Walking back out through the dust, I asked him if he ever worried that the system depended on every part of the system working perfectly. He laughed. The kind of laugh that belongs to a person who knows he is one late shipment away from insolvency. He said the trick was to keep moving faster than the collapse. I wrote that down.

Everyone in the AI boom believed in acceleration. No one had the time to think about deceleration. The two trillion dollar bet was not just a bet on innovation. It was a bet that the entire economy would keep suspending disbelief long enough for the numbers to catch up to the story. In the next parts of this reporting, I would learn that disbelief never stays suspended. It always returns, and when it does, it looks a lot like gravity.

# Part II: The Great Unseeing

If you want to understand the hidden architecture of the AI boom, you have to leave Silicon Valley and fly to a place where nobody has ever heard the word ""compute."" The only reminder of the future is the beige carpeting. This is the home office of a midsize life insurer in the American Midwest. The people here do not talk about GPUs or data centers. They talk about annuities, mortality tables, and the taste of the coffee in the break room. This is also where billions of dollars quietly slipped into the A...

The man showing me around was polite in the way people are polite when they assume you will not understand their world. He said the companies balance sheet had become more dynamic. That was his word. Dynamic. When I asked what it meant, he lowered his voice. It meant the company had begun investing a larger share of its assets in private credit deals they did not originate, did not structure, and did not always fully understand. It meant they had outsourced the risk assessment to asset managers who wen...

The story was always the same. A few years of historically low interest rates had pushed insurers into alternative assets. These assets promised higher yields. They were sold as safe, senior secured credit. The sales pitch relied on models built on assumptions about growth that were never meant to be tested. But once those assumptions became market common sense, no one asked where the returns actually came from.

A senior analyst pulled up a report on her screen. The insurer owned a slice of a loan to a data center operator I had just visited. She pointed to the collateral description with the air of someone pointing to a ghost. This says GPU cluster, she told me. I asked if we had any way to value the collateral. They said yes. I asked how. They said NVIDIA tells us the resale markets are strong. Then they stopped returning my emails.

Her boss had a different view. The boss wasn't worried because no one else seemed worried. The loan was marked at par. The income looked good. The regulator hadn't asked questions. Rating agencies gave the structure a stamp of safety. If you squinted hard enough, everything looked fine.

This was the unseeing. No one wanted to look too closely because everyone knew what might be revealed. What if the collateral lost half its value when the next generation of chips arrived. What if the models projected rental income depended on demand curves that bent at the first sign of recession. What if the company raising money for its next expansion used the same projections to justify the loans used to pay off the last round of loans.

In another office, this time on the East Coast, I met an actuary who had spent years calculating risk in the old fashioned way: by assuming bad things happen eventually. He showed me a spreadsheet that mapped out the insurers exposure to AI related credit. This was supposed to be uncorrelated, he said. That's what we were told. But the assets are all tied to the same kind of collateral. If one goes, they all go. If all go, we have a liquidity problem. Liquidity problems for insurers are very bad.

It wasn't the size of the positions that alarmed him. It was the speed with which they had grown. Five years ago, the insurer had almost no exposure to private credit. Then, quietly, the exposure became a third of the portfolio. A chunk of that third was tied to data centers and compute leasing. A chunk of that chunk was tied to borrowers who had never generated meaningful profits. The actuary said the company had become a shadow lender to the AI boom without ever having said the words out loud.

One day, over lunch, an executive told me the companies partnerships with private equity managers were a sign of sophistication. They help us capture upside, he said. When I asked about downside, he said the models accounted for it. When I asked what would happen if the models were wrong, he changed the subject.

The irony was that the people who understood the risks best were the most powerless. The analysts in cubicles. The actuaries with spreadsheets. The compliance staff who had been trained to tap risk reports like pressure gauges. They all said the same thing. They knew the assets were illiquid. They knew the valuations were theoretical. They knew the collateral would not survive a major technological shift. But they also knew that no one listened to Cassandra until after the city burned.

Many of the insurers had outsourced not just the credit selection but the thinking. Outsourced it to third party managers who collected fees whether the loans performed or not. Outsourced it to offshore reinsurers in places where the rules were softer and the scrutiny lighter. Outsourced it to boards who trusted the models because they did not know how to doubt them.

And still the money flowed. Annuity premiums came in. The money moved into private credit. Private credit moved it into data centers and GPU clusters. GPU clusters produced rental income that impressed the lenders. The lenders offered more financing. The insurers took more exposure. The circle spun faster.

By the time anyone wondered if the circle could stop, it was already spinning too fast to examine closely.  

# Part III: The Mirage of Infinite Demand

The first time I saw the graph, it was on a slide projected onto a conference room wall in San Francisco. The line on the screen did not look like anything you would expect from the real world. It did not rise. It curved. It bent upward like a hook. This was the demand curve for AI compute, or at least the version of it that had become gospel on Sand Hill Road.

The man presenting the graph was an analyst who had made a career out of turning complicated systems into simple charts. He told the room that AI compute demand had grown tenfold in a few short years. He told them it would grow another hundredfold. After that, it would be measured in unknowns. He did not say what would happen if it stopped. He did not need to. The point of the line was not to describe reality. The point was to make the room forget that reality ever placed limits on anything.

This graph traveled. It appeared in bank pitchbooks. It appeared in investor decks. It appeared in government talking points. It was the kind of picture that colonizes the mind. Once you had seen it, it was hard to imagine a future where the line pointed down.

A venture capitalist who had helped spread the graph around town told me, much later, that he had come to regret it. At the time, he thought he was just translating a trend. The cost of training state of the art models really had exploded. The number of parameters really had grown at an absurd rate. The graph was technically true. But it implied something bigger, and much more dangerous, than he intended. It implied that demand for compute was not just large, but infinite.

Once that idea took hold, strange things began to happen.

Companies that had never generated a dollar of profit were valued on the assumption that they would one day rent enough compute to pay for their hardware three times over. Data center developers started talking about gigawatts of power like kids talk about video game scores. Regional governments scrambled to lure AI clusters to their jurisdictions, rewriting tax codes and zoning laws in the hope of catching some of the reflected glow.

On Wall Street, the largest technology companies were reimagined as pure expressions of the graph. Their stock prices rose not just because they were profitable, but because they owned, or were thought to own, the on ramp to the infinite demand line. The S&P 500 became less a measure of the American economy and more an expensive derivative on the idea that AI would solve everything.

I met a portfolio manager whose life had been rearranged by that idea. He ran a large mutual fund that, historically, had prided itself on being dull. It held a little bit of everything. Its job was to be the ballast in retirement accounts. Then, one quarter, he watched as the fund underperformed the S&P by a few percentage points. Nothing in the underlying companies had changed. What changed was that the index had drifted further into AI stocks. His investors started to complain. Why were they paying him if he could not keep up with the benchmark.

So he bought the graph.

He did not literally buy it, of course. He bought the companies whose valuations depended on it. He increased the fund's exposure to the big AI names. He told himself he was managing risk. What he was really doing was surrendering to a story. He knew that if the story turned, the fund would suffer. But he also knew that if he ignored the story while the market kept believing it, the fund would suffer in a different way. For a while, it was easier to believe.

That was the mirage. It did not just trick the reckless. It tricked the cautious. It convinced careful people that the only prudent thing to do was to act like the future had already arrived.

The belief in infinite demand bled into policy. Trade tensions had already slowed global growth. Tariffs made it more expensive to move goods. Politicians, eager for a counter narrative, embraced AI as a kind of patriotic growth story. They spoke of national AI strategies, AI industrial policy, AI competitiveness. They shifted attention away from the drag of tariffs by promising that AI would more than make up for it.

You could watch this happen in the numbers. Manufacturing data sagged. Freight indices flattened. But the stock market climbed, carried by fewer and fewer companies, each more dependent than the last on the idea that the demand line would never bend. The gap between the real economy and the market economy became a kind of national secret everyone agreed not to talk about.

When I brought this up with the venture capitalist who had popularized the graph, he looked tired. He said he had started to see the line as a kind of temptation. Once people believed in it, they stopped doing the work of asking whether the demand was healthy, or sustainable, or evenly distributed. They started designing systems, and then entire financial structures, that could not survive a pause, let alone a reversal.

Meanwhile, at the bottom of the system, the people actually renting the compute, the startups trying to turn models into products, were struggling with a more mundane reality. Their costs were high. Their customers were cautious. Their revenue was lumpy. They did not live on the curve. They lived in the gap between glossy projections and hard contracts.

One founder showed me a spreadsheet of his company's compute costs. It looked like the graph from the conference, at least for a while. Then it flattened. When he tried to raise more money, investors pointed to the original curve and asked why he was not on it. He pointed to actual demand and got blank stares.

The circular nature of the system meant that everyone was watching everyone else. GPU makers watched hyperscalers. Hyperscalers watched startups. Startups watched the stock prices of GPU makers. Insurers watched the marks on private credit funds. Private credit funds watched refinancing markets. Refinancing markets watched the Fed. The Fed watched inflation, a problem made more complicated by tariffs and supply constraints.

As long as the line went up, the circularity did not matter. Each group could tell itself that the others were seeing something real. The trouble would come when someone tried to cash out.

That trouble usually starts quietly. A canceled order. A delayed project. A single missed earnings report. A whisper that one of the big AI renters is trying to renegotiate a contract. A lender who, after years of saying yes, says no.

The people who know how these systems break talk about inflection points. The problem with a mirage is that there is no obvious inflection point. There is only the slow and then sudden realization that the water ahead was never water at all.

# Part IV: The Slip

No one ever agrees on the exact moment when a boom turns. The people inside it are usually the last to know. They are too busy raising the next round, hitting the next milestone, securing the next financing window. But when the slip finally begins, it tends to happen in a way that feels, in hindsight, embarrassingly small.

The first sign came from a company whose name you would not recognize. It was not one of the giants. It was one of the firms that rented compute by the hour to anyone who needed to fine tune a model. They were not a unicorn. They were a workhorse, always raising money, always expanding their racks, always promising the next jump in utilization. Until one afternoon, they released earnings that did not look like earnings at all.

Revenue had not just slowed. It had reversed. Hardware utilization dropped. One entire region of their network sat under thirty percent capacity for reasons that, even in the footnotes, remained unclear. The stock fell twenty percent in after hours. Analysts blamed seasonality. Privately, their suppliers did not.

A week later, a GPU backed loan package that had been marketed as safer than municipal bonds failed to refinance. The lender balked at the new collateral report. They wanted an updated valuation from a third party. The third party took longer than expected. When the number finally came back, it was lower than anyone wanted to see. Suddenly a deal that had been whispered about as oversubscribed was quietly pulled.

Inside a private credit fund in New York, the tone changed. For years, the partners had bragged about the stability of their AI infrastructure book. Now they were in a room filled with concerned investors, explaining why redemptions were paused. They called it a temporary liquidity mismatch. They used phrases like short term stress and technical repricing. They did not say the obvious thing, which was that the loans they had extended at par were now worth considerably less in a market that had stopped believing ...

In the insurance world, the stress took a different form. One midsize carrier received a downgrade from a major rating agency. The downgrade cited the insurers exposure to emerging technology credit, a phrase that did not exist a year earlier. Policyholders noticed. Brokers noticed faster. Money began to move out, not in a panic, but in a steady, draining trickle. The company had enough capital. It did not have enough time.

The data center sector felt the shift like a pressure change before a storm. Developers who had been racing to break ground on new facilities suddenly found their tenants asking to renegotiate leases. A few asked to push delivery dates. One hyperscaler quietly reduced its expansion plan by a third. Power utilities received calls from customers asking whether they could adjust future commitments. Nobody used the word slowdown, but everyone heard it hanging in the air.

Then came the market reaction. For months, the S&P had moved as if guided by a single invisible hand. The AI giants carried the index. Their valuations had grown so large that the rest of the market no longer needed to matter. But on a Tuesday morning in late fall, one of the largest names reported results that were merely good rather than transcendent. In any other year, the numbers would have been celebrated. In this one, they were a disappointment.

The stock fell eight percent in a day. That was enough to drag the index down with it. A few weeks earlier, the same company had floated the idea of a five year capital plan measured in the trillions. Investors had treated the number like destiny. Now they treated it like hubris.

It turned out that when sentiment turned, it did not turn politely. The selling radiated outward. Companies that had nothing to do with AI saw their prices fall. Household wealth ticked down. Retirement accounts dipped. Consumer confidence surveys, already fragile from tariffs and inflation, registered a sharp drop.

In a regional bank on the West Coast, the risk team found themselves in a room staring at a list of exposures they had inherited from the boom. Loans to private credit funds. Loans to data center operators. Lines of credit to companies whose revenue now depended on renting compute that no longer had certain takers. The bank had enough capital on paper. But the models assumed that refinancing would remain available. The models assumed that deposit flows would remain stable. Both assumptions were suddenly in ques...

And then there was the government. The officials responsible for stabilizing markets held press conferences in which they assured the public that there was nothing to worry about. They used phrases that had survived every crisis since the 1980s. Temporary dislocation. Healthy correction. Market dynamics. They did not use the words that insiders used in private. Contagion. Correlation. Run.

The most striking part of the slip was how quiet it was. There were no dramatic collapses. No headlines announcing bankruptcy. No CEOs being marched out of glass towers with cardboard boxes. Instead, there was a steady accumulation of small failures. A bond pulled here. A loan marked down there. A downgrade. A delayed project. A nervous withdrawal. A renegotiated contract. One by one, the supports that had held up the story of infinite demand began to loosen.

People inside the system noticed long before the outside world did. A venture capitalist told me that founders who used to speak in metrics now spoke in metaphors. A credit analyst said she felt like she was watching the tide recede. An insurance actuary said he had started waking up at three in the morning to check foreign markets. A data center developer canceled a groundbreaking ceremony because he no longer trusted the timeline he had promised the mayor.

In the desert, the young founder who had shown me his half built facility sent me a message. It was short. He said the next delivery of GPUs had been delayed. The lender wanted updated numbers. The numbers were not ready. He said he was not sleeping. He said the hum of the test racks no longer sounded like a promise. It sounded like a warning.

The slip, once it began, did not stop. It spread along the lines that had been drawn during the boom. It followed the money. It followed the story. It followed the assumptions that had held the system together. It moved quietly, but it moved.

Where it was moving was the part no one wanted to name yet.

# Part V: After Artificial

When the break finally arrived, it did not look like a crash. It looked like exhaustion. The markets had been slipping for months, confidence draining the way water drains from a cracked pipe. Then one morning, the pipe simply gave out. A major AI lessor filed a notice that it would miss payments on a set of GPU backed loans. The borrowers blamed a delay in new chip deliveries. The lenders blamed the borrowers. The market blamed both.

That same morning, a large insurer disclosed that it would restrict withdrawals in one of its flagship annuity products. The filing was technical, boring, wrapped in language that sounded designed to anesthetize. But the people who understood the system read between the lines. The company was experiencing liquidity stress. The liquidity stress was tied to private assets. The private assets were tied to structures that were tied to compute.

None of this was supposed to happen. Insurance was the most stable corner of finance. It existed to turn long term obligations into predictable streams of cash. But the insurance companies had been drawn into the boom the same way everyone else had. They reached for yield. They accepted assumptions that did not hold up. They convinced themselves that the risk they were taking was measured, even as the models they relied on quietly filled with circular logic.

After the news broke, regulators held a series of emergency calls. They issued statements designed to soothe. They said the system was sound. They said the events were contained. They said the companies involved were working through normal processes. They said everything a regulator is trained to say when the truth is more complicated.

In the weeks that followed, the air went out of the market. Stocks that had once looked untouchable fell ten, twenty, thirty percent. The giants that carried the index lost a quarter of their value. Data center developers paused projects. Utilities revised their load forecasts. Bank lending tightened. Private credit funds marked down positions they had spent years insisting were immune to volatility.

People who had never paid attention to collateral suddenly began asking questions. What, exactly, secured a GPU backed loan? How should you value a cluster of machines that would be obsolete within eighteen months? Why had so many institutions treated this as safe when the underlying economics looked like a race that could only be won by running faster than depreciation?

Some of the answers were simple. People trusted the story because the story made them money. Investors believed in the curve because the curve told them they were early. Governments believed in infinite demand because infinite demand sounded like a solution to everything else that was going wrong. The more complicated answers had to do with structure. The system was designed in a way that made doubt expensive. If you doubted the models, you lost your job. If you doubted the valuations, you underperformed your benchmark. If you doubted the future, you had to explain why you were the only one raising your hand.

One afternoon, months after the slip had become a slide, I visited the same desert site where the young founder had shown me his half built facility. The frames were still there. The dust was still there. But the hum was gone. The company had paused construction. They were renegotiating their debt. They were hoping for a path forward. They were also preparing for a sale.

The founder looked older. He said he still believed in the technology. He said the models would get better. He said the need for compute would rise. He said all the things he had said before, but now with an edge of something that sounded like realism. He said the problem was not the future. The problem was the financing that had tried to bring the future forward all at once.

In the cities, the story played out in quieter ways. Startups shrank. Some folded. Others merged. A few discovered that shedding growth expectations made them sturdier. Investors rediscovered restraint. Pension funds revisited the definition of risk. Insurers rewrote their investment policies. Banks reassessed their exposure to private credit. The S&P stabilized at a lower level, not because anyone had solved anything, but because the market had accepted that the previous valuations were built on air.

In Washington, hearings began. Politicians asked why so much of the countrys retirement savings had been funneled into high risk loans tied to short lived hardware. They asked why so many institutions had treated compute like real estate. They asked how a five year, two trillion dollar capex plan from a company generating a fraction of that in free cash had once been seen as normal. The answers were long. None were particularly satisfying.

The strange thing about the aftermath was that the technology itself kept improving. The models grew more capable. Researchers made breakthroughs. Startups built tools that people actually used. The collapse of the financial structure did not stop the science. It only slowed the excess that had been wrapped around it.

Looking back, the people who lived through the boom talked about it the way survivors talk about a fever. They remembered flashes. They remembered certainty. They remembered the feeling that the world was accelerating and they had to keep up. They also remembered the moment the fever broke, when they realized they had built an economy around a belief that could not support the weight placed on it.

Economists will spend years untangling what happened. They will build models that explain the contagion. They will write papers about nonlinear risk and collateral decay and index concentration. They will say that the outcomes were predictable. But the people inside the system will remember something simpler. They will remember that they looked at a complicated machine, told themselves it was safe because everyone else said it was safe, and then watched it fall apart in slow motion.

The lesson of the AI boom will not be that technology misleads us. It will be that we mislead ourselves. We build structures that rely on perfect growth. We call them innovation. We assume the future will bail us out. We forget that leverage, no matter how artificial, always resolves the same way.

The boom ended. The reckoning arrived. What remains are the parts of the system that never depended on a curve rising forever. They are quieter. They are smaller. They are slower. That slowness, for the first time in years, feels like a kind of wisdom.",0,1763926746.0,investing,1,0.5,False
1p4vsxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/comments/1p4vsxu/m4f_looking_for_a_long_term_roleplay_partner/,[M4F] looking for a long term roleplay partner!,"Hello! I go by Ghost! I am 26 and looking for a roleplay partner to construct an ongoing plot with me.

we can come up with a starting plot, and just expand it from there. I want one that lasts a significant amount of time, quality in replies is what i’m after, not quantity.

I don’t mind any genre, or romance or any other scenes that come along with romance, just as long as there is significant build up and chemistry between the characters. I want the characters developing something overtime instead of rushing towards it. much like a real relationship (if there is going to be romance involved in the plot line). I don’t mind a bit of dramatic points too, whether the characters not get along sometimes or something bad happens in life that makes them more irritable; I’m open to it all.

this is primarily an OC plot, nothing fandom based for now.  so if you have an OC or a few of them, feel free to tell me all about them! Or if you’d rather reveal their information to my OC through the roleplay; that’s perfectly fine too!

I want us both to partake in planning out a plot line, so I am open to suggestion about how it should go in the beginning. it can be as simple as our characters meeting at a coffee shop or something more dramatic, like meeting during an apocalyptic event. I’m totally open to any and all genres of roleplay as well.

I also have a few OC’s which I will happily tell you about if you’re interested and you are more than welcome to pick from the bunch or I can even craft a new OC just for the plot line if that would be better for you.

requirements are ;

18 plus advanced literate open to using discord not afraid to talk ooc and establish a friendship!

other than that, if you’d like to write out a storyline that has a lot of depth and feels as if it could very well be its own little world; feel free to message me! I won’t respond to “hey” or “wanna rp” messages however, so please if you genuinely want to write send a bit of an introductory message about yourself and we can go from there!",1,1763926711.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,1.0,False
1p4vrkf,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1p4vrkf/ur_left_behind/,[UR] Left Behind,"It was a droning sound that awoken me from a rather ragged and torturous sleep. My half-opened sleep crusted eyes, still in a liminal daze of such an abrupt action as pulling one from the plains of their mind into the plains of their existence, scanned the cold environment of The City looking for the source of such a shrill noise.

It was a little yellow digger at the side of the road. I could see the construction worker inside the machine, controlling it in such a way that freaked me out. The idea reminded me of a movie I had watched as a kid on a portable DVD player that I had loved (whatever had happened to that?). The digger scratched and scraped at the subterranean ground of The City like the distant, furious pangs of an unfinished sleep that scraped my fuzzy brain, trying to claw it into consciousness, or what past for it these days.

It was early. Too early for any normal human being to be getting up and wasting away. The sky was an abstract mix of furious anger and serene peace. Whatever the weather folks said it was to be would undoubtedly be wrong.

The first smell to penetrate my nostrils, beside myself, The City and the construction work, was the overwhelming vapour of morning coffee. Everywhere I looked, any man or woman in a suit had a cup of coffee steaming away in their hand as they hurried to their sacred jobs. I’m not typically one for coffee, mind you, but what with the abrupt awakening and the winter season sneakily coming in full force – I fancied myself a cup of the old joe.

 

And so, I was off. A typical nomad. It had tried to snow last night. But all the clouds could force out was sleet. Which was like winter diarrhoea. The days would be better when the snow eventually arrives, and I can get a laugh in at the expense of some old coffin dodger who shakily slips and falls on his way to the old pub.

I knew it was bad. But you had to *take* what laughs you could get in this world, much like everything else in this place. For me, life’s one big bully. And it certainly is a dog-eat-dog world…if I’ve ever seen one.

 

The morning breakfast was a bacon roll and a cup of soup. I hated the Styrofoam cups they’d give out these days but who am I to complain? As long as one sea turtle swims away another day to do another shite, I’ll suffer happily with my shitty wee cup of piss and broth.

I quickly scoffed down the food and retreated out of there into the black heart of The City. Already I saw the filthiness of it all – stationary in their self-pity-obsessed rot. Their ragged tents leaning to one side like a boy with a large alien head. Their dogs in full display.

“Ohhhhh, the poor mutt must be starving!”

“No, no, Grandma, you dinnae understand, they git money fir havin’ that dug’.”

“Och, away, (insert scumbag-name) the poor boy must be freezing.”

At least none of them are playing music…yet.

I remember as a kid, when me and my family first visited the castle atop The City (the first time *I* had visited it) they had the regular donate here signs. Then at some point it was tap card here to donate…They were all about the streets these machines! Like my ear-splitting signing? Tap your card.

Like my murder-inducing instrument playing? Tap your card here.

…

 

I made it to the park, fortunately. The grass was sparkly and sugar-coated and stiff with the approaching winter. I walked upon the resisting grass and trampled every sparkle I could find. For once in a long time, my ragged boots shone a gleaming smile that was pure and happy – and wasn’t weighed down by the unfortunate stench that arises from using some muddy autumnal puddle as a brush…

My next port of call was to find a cup of coffee. Which, since this morning for some reason, I craved like a junkie. Luckily for me, the park which I was wandering was home to a little café which served just what I wanted at the exact time I could get it.

I happily plopped down my sticky coins in exchange for a cup of aromatic and blissful coffee. I sat at one of the many seats in the park and savoured the steaming hot beverage in a way that I think is utterly foreign to a businessman/woman.

 

With the steady rise of the sun, came the steady rise of the population. An old couple sat at a bench next to me (I had my bench all to myself) and began speaking in their usual drivel. After they had gotten their sideway glances and poisonous mutterings out between themselves silently, they began to talk in a way that was too early in the morning to be conversing like that:

“Margaret across the road, you know Jack’s wife? Yes. She says that it is to be a terribly cold winter this year.”

“And guess who will be most hard done by it? Us.”

“Oh, nonsense, Harry.”

“Would you be content in your own hoose, freezing away like some beggar, having to put on an extra jacket or two, on top of your two or three blankets?!”

“Whatever keeps me alive, darling.”

“Och, come on, Susan, don’t start talking so dark all of a sudden. The doctor told you now, you’ve got to think *happy thoughts*.”

“…”

“Our Brian said that ‘n’ aw.”

“Aye, when he comes round once in a blue moon fir cash!”

“It isn’t like that, *Susan*—”

“*You* might be blinded by nostalgia, Harry, but I am not.”

“He’s our son for chrissake, he should be able to lean on us every once in a while.”

“Every once in a while? Are you serious? It’s been near enough every other *blimmin’* week!”

“Aw away to hell, Susan! He’s our boy!”

“Aye, our boy the vampire!”

I quickly got out of there, relinquishing my somewhat comfortable seat for another sorry soul, and began to descend the large gardens down to the lower areas where most of the frozen flowers were.

As I forlornly strutted along the frozen wastelands of the park, giving absurd high-fives to already dead plants like a wrestler to fans from the shows of my youth, I eventually wandered into a realm where I stopped dead in my tracks and observed the park from something akin to a fisheye lens.

I had walked across the many burial grounds of flowers once held high for the beauty, of grass once was held high for its comfort, of paths once held high for their neatness, of benches once held high for their accessibility…all of that was now gone in one cold, bitter instant. Freeing T-shirts gave way to straitjacket-jackets. Trousers – that had once been mutilated and mangled into shorts – regrew like wild bamboo and conquered again…

 

I ran from the park to the station. It was still cold. Pigeons flew about the place whilst robotic intercoms discouraged people from feeding them right at the time a little girl gave a pigeon a corner of a chocolate chip cookie.

The waiting area of the station had obtuse seats laid out in an obtuse way that could only be described as being modelled after baby snakes.

(Of course, you couldn’t see that till the after hours when everybody was away, which I had seen many a time).

I sat down at a spot that gave me somewhat decent back support. I cracked my frame too many times in ways I reluctantly imagined were doing more harm than good. In this weird liminal area was a posh shop, a fast-food shop and, of course, a pub – which was the most populated area.

 

I sat in that place for such a long, long time that my arse developed such a lump that my mind began to delude itself into believing I had shat myself and was currently sitting on an *absolute rock* of a shite…Which I wasn’t. Ha. Ha.

Gradually, people began to drift in and out of the place, much like the machines called trains that took them to promised places that meant something to them for some reason.

The only constant, to me, was myself, the pigeons and that damned intercom.

“…Please don’t feed the pigeons. We are encourage—”

BLAM!

 

As the hopeful day was cast aside into a dismal night, the station deteriorated into an emptiness so deep you’d think you were dreaming a nightmare about your state of mind. Everything and everyone lost the meaning it had shakily established just a few hours ago. I guess that’s the winter for you. It culls the weak from the strong. Wild animals give up and freeze to death much like humans, only we call it seasonal depression.

I sat on my numbed arse until some cunt told me politely to get to fuck.

I climbed up the stairs, caught my breath, and stepped out into the nighttime gloom which had left behind the bright, dazzling blue of the day ages ago.

The City still continued to crumble. It was sickly. Old vs New. It was an iconic argument. Walkabout They City for a few minutes and you’ll see that no matter what, everything begins to crumble in such a routine way it should be deemed as cruelty.

 

I pushed myself up the never-ending stairs. To the right was another pub (which was shut) and the left was full of depraved depressions where any desperate prick would side-sleep in, in pish-saturated newspaper and cardboard…

At the top of the stairs, I was accompanied by myself, stun-locked and sucking on breath like a choking, neglected baby.

The City began to slope to one side unevenly. As if itself couldn’t put up with all the shit that comes with being constructed by posh peasants hundreds of years ago. To The City, the modern age was like toothache, it saw it coming and still it did fuck-all about it. I climbed up the slope to another, more even street, hoping I could rest for a moment. Unfortunately, who should be sitting on a bench at that street but Cheryl.

 

“What are you doin’ here?” she asked me through smoke-seduced lungs.

“Same as you,” I told her, crouching in front of her and her big, stolen jacket and dirty cigarette.

Her red (lipstick or blood?) lips fell away from the cancerstick and blew a puff of suffocating gas my way.

“It’s cold,” she said, “you should get on home.”

There was a couple of neds that shouted abuse at us. A few broken bottles smashed in the moonlight.

“We’ll catch a fever,” I told her.

“There’s already one going about,” she puffed out a bellow of smoke.

“Is that why you’re back on the cigs?”

“You know me and my superstitions too well,” her laugh was short and sweet, like a good memory.

She buttoned up her jacket and stamped on the dwindled butt furiously.

“You know I had Chinese food for dinner tonight?”

“Really? What’d you have?”

“I dunno. Some rice and noodle thing. It was piping hot and filled me up.”

“That’s good. That’s good.”

“I gotta go now. Feeling kinda cold.”

“I’ll come with you then.”

“Oh, you don’t have to go through the trouble—”

“I insist.”

“…’course you do.”

 

I followed her back to her humble abode, which wasn’t much. I hadn’t known her too long, but I knew the basics. You *never* called her her name.

“You sleeping in a tent?” I asked her, unable to hide my judgement.

“Yeah,” she said dismally, “not as good as a hotel room.”

She sat inside the tent with her scrawny legs crossed outside it. I caught a whiff of copper so strong I nearly boked.

She began to aggressively strike both her arms.

“What are you doing?”

She paid no attention to me. Tightened some thread-bare belt around whichever arm was most veiny.

“Fucksake, Cheryl, since when?!”

Her tired eyes devolved into a magma-like red. She grabbed me by the throat—

“You see these?”

She bared her teeth, but in my confused, whirlwind eyes I couldn’t see shit.

“Both of my *vital* teeth are gone,” she hissed.

“I didn’t know! I didn’t know any were missing!”

She let me be in favour for a blood red syringe. Which quickly lulled her into a paper-thin-addled sleep.

 

Yet again, I quickly scoff down my bile and retreat somewhere else deeper into the dark City. The streets quickly become labyrinthine. The paranoia bounces about the walls like videogame bullets. I’m reminded of that movie from my childhood.

The darkness doesn’t lift at all. All I hear as I traverse this mess is weird bangs and distant muddles.

I turn a jagged corner and encounter a giant dog that is thankfully chained up. The dog doesn’t as much as bark at me as it savagely shouts and shreds my soul apart. I’m able to feel my different self’s in other dimensions running from the chained beast, while I, the most lucid one, have to stay with it and traverse the danger like some lost knight stuck in a darkened labyrinth.

Eventually, I’m able to feel somewhat safe. The outskirts of The City look like the end of the world to me. I know I’ve wandered too far. I decide to hunker down for the night and then, in the distant morning, plan something that should keep me on track.

As I clamber into a depression untouched by any human or their waste, I survey the street and see no soul.

I cuddle up to myself and suddenly remember a comic I read as a kid. A classic ghost story. Of course, set in a ragged city with ragged characters…It only cost my parents 80p…if only they could see the prices now…

The ghost just needed someone to hold him in the coldness.

“Hold me,” he would croak.

The coldness of The City plummeted apocalyptically.

“Hold me,” I would plead.

Essentially what would happen if a logical engineer ever stumbled onto the Fallout 3 combat shotgun. A fun gun in game but crazy design.)


**Odessa found it in the ruins of an old checkpoint—half-buried beneath collapsed roof tiles and tangled rebar. A rust-caked footlocker, padlocked but brittle with age. One swift jab from her pry bar and the latch gave with a snap.**
**Inside: a few ruined rounds, a broken scope, and… a shotgun. (The Fallout 3 combat shotgun)**
**She squinted.**
**No.**
**No, it claimed to be a shotgun.**
**Carefully, Odessa pulled it out—already suspicious from the weight distribution alone. It had a drum magazine awkwardly up front, so far ahead of the receiver it looked like a joke. Like someone had welded a coffee tin to a door hinge and called it tactical.**
**She turned it over in her hands once. Twice.**
**Then just stared at it.**
“…What is this,” **she said flatly.**
**Her expression didn’t change, but her soul visibly recoiled.**
**She crouched down and actually measured the gap between the action and the magazine feed with her fingers. Her lips twitched. A slow, baffled blink. She looked at it the way one might look at a painting of a horse drawn by someone who had only heard of horses through whispered legend.**
“This,” **she muttered to herself,** “should not work. This cannot work. The feed’s too far forward. How the hell is the bolt supposed to—no. No, wait.”
**She gave it a little shake.** **Something rattled. Of course it did.**
“Oh, you rattle. Perfect.”
**She lifted it up, aiming down the sight experimentally. The weight was wrong. The balance was wrong. The soul of the thing was wrong.**
**Odessa lowered it with visible offense.**
“This is heresy.”
**She sat down on a broken step, pulled a grease pencil from her pocket, and—after a long, contemplative moment—scrawled directly on the side of the receiver:**
""ERROR: DESIGNED BY BUREAUCRATS.""
**She didn’t dismantle it right away. Not out of mercy. Out of morbid curiosity. Like a scientist studying a mutated frog.**
“If this thing fires, I’ll eat my boot.”
**It did, two days later. Once. Barely. The casing stove-piped, and it kicked like a Brahmin with a grudge.**
**Odessa threw it into a ravine.
She did take the sling, though. Because that was well-made.**",1,1763926545.0,Fallout,0,1.0,False

And I’m honestly starting to get STRESSED. We’ve tried everything from fresh beans, to moist beans, to different branded beans. I’ve cleaned the whole machine twice. And still nothing. I’ve had my grind settings all over the place although I did noticed that staying at grind 8 with 17 g comes out better than the rest but it bothers me that it isn’t 18g. Since I’ve heard that 18g is what we should aim for. I also work with medium roast beans. I’ve tried the dark roast and it wasn’t my personal favorite.

I’m a 25-year-old monogamous Femme from the West Coast with a hopelessly romantic heart and an endless love for fall 🍂.

\*Call me the next Lorelai Gilmore — I talk fast, drink too much coffee, and will definitely steal your fries\*

I adore making people laugh, cracking silly jokes, and sharing cozy moments with a good book and a nice cup of coffee.

My love languages are **quality time, gift giving, and acts of service**—so expect homemade treats, thoughtful surprises, and plenty of shared adventures.

My  little world includes: • Gaming (bonus points if you can co-op or banter) • Writing stories as an aspiring author • Photography • Crochet   (yes, I *will* make something cute just for you) • Baking treats you’ll crave (though I’ll definitely need help with the clean-up afterward) • Painting (watercolour, oil )  • Gardening • Anime & manga marathons

Phone calls that somehow turn into late-night giggles and deep conversations

I love exploring new places and trying different cuisines, and I’m open to long-distance as long as we can meet in person. When we’re apart, I stay connected through texts, calls, emails, and all the little daily check-ins that make quality time feel real even from miles away.

I’m searching for someone who’s:  
• Romantic  
• Funny  
• Passionate and driven  
• Spontaneous in the cutest ways  
• Comfortable laughing at themselves (and at my puns)

You’ll also need to love animals—I’m both a dog mama and a cat mama, and they’re part of the package deal.

I’m ready to find love. I know my future partner is out there somewhere, and like a perfect loaf of bread, the best things take time to rise.

Just glimpses out of the corner of my eyes, but lately she's been accompanied by something else. I'll see her move and then there will be a dark something that follows her. It seems to be braver than her though, I've seen it under the coffee table, in the kitchen, on the counter in the bathroom, and even at the foot of my bed. I can't get a clear view of it, just a shape. Somewhere between a small dog and a cat. It's blurry and doesn't ever really take full form, so I can't pin down what it is. 

If you've been following along for a while you'll know that I'm used to seeing ghost animals. This thing though, whatever it is gives me some strange vibes. I'm not scared of it, it's just strange. Like I should know what it is and who she is. No matter what I use though I can't seem to get straight answers from her or even Wyatt. It's like he wants me to figure it out on my own, which is annoying.

1p4vk6p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p4vk6p,Hammerhead commission artwork,"Hello again!

I bring you the second (two out of two) commission I asked the talented Orniris to do for me. This time it’s one of my all time fav mediums - the Hammerhead. If you notice this one’s got the same merc symbol - but a keen eye will notice Ice Hellion symbology. That is because this pilot specifically was caught during a disastrous sortie from her Ice Hellion Galaxy that belongs to the Scorpion Empire. She eventually now. It was a rough road (and a short story I’m working on), but she now pilots her same Hammerhead she was caught in for Bojack’s Horsemen.

This piece I asked for a much more brighter morning with her sipping coffee - and honestly Orniris delivered as per normal. 

He also saw some of your feedback on the ladder of the regent being a bit weird - so he actually went back and redrew the ladder a bit wider with less rungs - I included the new and improved pics in this post (I think the ladder looks better now what y’all think ❤️). I’m super glad I was able to commission these two pieces of artwork from him - both being a slight break from his normal character driven work and this being more environmental/atmospheric in nature. 

For those curious - here is his page on Instagram (mostly focused on character images from warhammer - but as you can see his battletech is phenomenal). Anyways - enjoy

I want to prepare myself and get the accessories needed. Most of online stores dont ship to my country or have high shipping so i want to rely on aliexpress and temu.

What products have you bough from them for the robot and what do you recommend?

I know the robot comes with everything needed but since i have no other accessories i wanted to buy them. Plus being on a tight budget ali and temu seem fit, i am afraid of temu metail parts tho, some reddittors say they may contain lead.

What i need:

A mini scale

Airtight coffee container, 1L

Some small coffee conainers just to have them whenever i feel like switching coffee

Dosage tray, bean scoop and sprayer

Knock box (tho i dont see the point of this one, if it will stay on the kitchen it will smell)

1p4vhv1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1p4vhv1/altar_of_the_hummingbirds_part_2/,Altar of the Hummingbirds (Part 2),"“Jesus, Ethan, you eat like a bird,” I said.

Sitting across from him in the lunch room I could see that all he brought was a single red apple and a cup of black coffee. He laughed weakly, more saturnine than usual.

“Yeah,” he started, “well I gotta watch my figure, Ash. Don’t wanna end up like Josh here.”

Josh threw his tie, which had not even reached past his gut, over his shoulder, patted his belly and said: “You mean the peak of male performance?”

“And how much bologna and mayonnaise does it take to reach the peak, exactly?” I asked.

“Hey,” Josh said, “I’ve cut back on the mayonnaise.”

The fluorescent bulbs hummed overhead as one could hear the slight whir of a security camera in the corner of this sterile, matte white room. Lunch breaks were staggered to maintain production schedules so there was only one other department in there with us. It was more of an ivory cavern than any kind of cafeteria.

“You get in a fight or somethin’?” Josh asked Ethan, gesturing to the bandaid on his cheek.

“Yeah,” said Ethan, and then almost immediately, “no, it was a bird. At the park. I was feeding some birds at the park and I guess one of them was a bit aggressive.”

Seemed like a pretty deep cut to be from a bird, but what did I know? 

He always looked sickly and disheveled, but I hadn’t seen him since the funeral and somehow he’d gotten thinner. And the bags under his eyes were the worst I’d ever seen them. 

Josh and I exchanged a glance, he had noticed it too.

“Glad you’re back, man,” Josh said and clasped Ethan on the shoulder.

“Yeah, we were a bit worried after how long you’ve been gone,” I added. “You doin’ okay?”

Ethan took a bite of the apple and chewed slowly and methodically. He couldn’t have looked more uncomfortable had he been eating a block of mold. 

“Just,” Ethan said, pausing, “been processing things. I’m okay. Sorry I left you guys hanging.” 

“Hey, we’re just glad you’re back,” I said.

It was awkward. Ethan had never been much of a conversationalist, but the air around us was pregnant with some unseen anxiety that made even the normally loquacious Josh reticent to speak. Until finally Ethan broke the silence.

“I was reading a story, an online story, about some guy with a VR set who got physically hurt.” He was slowly, absent-mindedly twisting on the stem of his apple as he spoke. “Can that actually happen? Getting hurt in the real while you’re in VR?”

“Nah,” Josh began, blotting mayonnaise out of his beard, “Even the military grade shit isn’t that advanced. I mean, it can simulate pain, and most other sensations, but it can’t physically cause damage.”

Ethan nodded slowly, like he was miles away.

“You thinkin’ about getting into VR gaming?” I asked. 

“Cause I got some great hardware suggestions,” Josh interjected. “XJR-80, the absolute best at sensory immersion. Always go Korean for that type of shit, Japan is overrated in my opinion.” 

“Yes, and we all know why and how you became such an expert on ‘virtual sensations.’”

“Jesus, Ash, it’s not like I’m jerking off in the damn things,” Josh replied, and then taking a big bite of his sandwich added: “Besides, gets too messy.”



Lunch was over and the PA system chimed its rhythmic ballad. We stood up and cleared out our refuse, Ethan throwing away half an apple. 

He really seemed like a zombie. He didn’t even react when we told him about the theft, that some custodian must have swiped a bunch of tech to sell on the street. As we headed back to the organoid assembly lab, I gently tugged on the sleeve of his coat. 

“Hey, seriously, I’m here if you ever need to talk.”

I rested my hand on his arm and squeezed gently to reassure him. I knew how close he had been with Willow.

He looked at me with pleading eyes, like a small animal with its leg caught in a trap. He opened his mouth to say something and then stammered and looked away.

“I know what you’re going through, Ethan,” I added. “Willow’s passing has got us all broken up. She was a really sweet and gentle soul.”

I felt his arm tense under my hand and he looked up at me, with darkened eyes.

“Thank you, Ashley,” he said in a flat, monotone voice. He turned sharply out of my grasp and headed down the hallway.

\_\_\_\_



“Fucking Ashley,” I muttered on the train ride home. “Fucking Josh. You and your bullshit empty platitudes, what the hell could either of you know?”

The audacity of them. What? Had they loved her as dearly as I had? Had a piece of them been ripped away? Had they had every single person they’ve ever loved ripped out of their arms, one by one, and there wasn’t a goddamn thing they could do about it?

But not this time. This time I would fix it. Obviously, I must’ve just scratched myself somehow. Maybe even before I entered the program. It’s entirely possible. After all, I had been so focused on even just getting to that point.

But the birds shouldn’t have attacked me. I’m recognized in the script as a user, same as Willow. They didn’t touch her. Why?

At least Dynomics was blaming the help for the loss of those components. I still felt like the sword of damocles was dangling above my head, but I could breathe a bit easier for the time being. 



I pondered the mystery of the birds the whole way back to my apartment. When I entered I was greeted by the now-comforting hum of Willow’s organoid, and the smell of drying mud. I really needed to wash my clothes from that night. 

I gazed out onto the city through my balcony door as the sun set. Littered with lights and noise, a hellish hive that teamed with insects. I longed for the cottage, Willow, and the gentle rustling of leaves and grass.

As I unfurled my tie and tossed it to the floor something caught my eye, something just outside on the balcony. It was a pigeon with a broken neck. Poor thing must’ve flown right into the glass, but there wasn’t a mark to be found on the door. I held its light and stiff little body in my hand, the colors of brown, black and white wer-

“White cells!” I exclaimed, and ran inside.

The program may recognize me as a user, but an organoid is more than just software. Willow’s brain matter is part of it. It must have concluded I was a foreign body, an infection to be driven out. That’s why everything went so wrong!

I grabbed the scalpel out of the trash and entered her shrine. I opened the small glass lid atop the organoid and, slicing my hand open, let my blood drip freely into the compartment to mingle with Willow’s brain. 

Now we were one, and our paradise would not turn on me as an intruder. Wrapping some duct tape around my hand, I seated myself at the console and prepared for re-entry.



The sky was gray this time, murky. The trees were all bare and desiccated. The ground around the stone pillar was soggy, and gave under my footfalls. Each step I took gave a sucking sound. It was like the ranch after a heavy winter thaw, but why was it so sticky and viscous?

I walked the trail back to the big oak, and our cottage, with a sense of unease. It was quiet. The background static of the forest was as completely non-existent as the leaves that once bejeweled the trees around me. 

About halfway along the trail though, the trees started filling out, and I felt a moment of relief. That was until I noticed the thousands of glimmering eyes watching me from the leaves. No, not leaves. Feathers. Thousands upon thousands of birds perched in the lifeless branches, motionless but for their heads that slowly tracked my advance.

And they were utterly silent. 



As I neared the grand old oak, it too was caked in birds beneath a matte gray and churning sky. I saw no sign of Willow or our horses or anything other than the winged devils that watched me. The little thatched cottage sat at the backdrop of the oak, darkened by its shade, the door ajar. I approached it and saw it had been crudely carved with a heart. At its center were the initials “E+W.” I could hear and see a small raven pecking at the window, and I heard the gentle sobbing coming from within.

“Willow?” I managed to choke out as I entered our home. “It’s me. I’m back, like I promised.”

She was hunched in the corner, her features barely visible. I could see two glints of light in her murky outline that must have been her eyes. I couldn’t make out much in the room, save some few pieces of furniture, a bed, a stove, a bookshelf. And every inch of the walls that was visible was carved with “E+W.”

“You promised you would stay,” she said, her voice quivering and childlike. “I’m sorry. I made them quiet now. They won’t bother you.”

“Honey, no, I’m so sorry, it was all my fault. But I fixed it, I really fixed it this time, and it’s all gonna be alright.” 

I heard a horse whinnying outside and turned to look. Willow’s hand shot out like a bolt from the shadows and grabbed my wrist. She shouldn’t have been able to reach me from that distance.

“You promised you wouldn’t leave,” she said, the two pinprick glints of light rising with the rest of the outline as she stood up. “You lied.”

“Willow, I’m sorry. There was something wrong with the program and I had to fix it or we could never be happy here. Please, I know there’s no excusing my actions, but I panicked when the bird cut me.”

Was she taller than me or was that just the shadows playing tricks on me? And why was her grip so firm around my wrist?

“The bird didn’t cut you, you did that to yourself.”

She stepped forward now, partially into the light. She wasn’t snow white anymore, she was completely gray. She had her other hand over her neck, the fingernails looked necrotic and sharp. Her romanesque nose had distended and become more aquiline. And her eyes. The deep brown eyes tinted amber were the same, though they were now ensconced in jet-black sclera.

“I missed you a lot,” she said, finally relaxing her grip on me.

Her head was twitching slightly as she stood there, cocking from side to side in short, rapid, jerking movements. 

“I missed you too, Willow,” was my reply as I fought the urge to step back. I messed this up somehow, but it was still Willow. No matter how she looked it was still her in there. I just had to figure out what I did wrong.

“You promise you really fixed it this time?” she asked.

“Almost.” I swallowed. “I have to leave one more time, but when I come back I’ll never leave again. Okay?”

The horses were neighing and grunting now.

She looked downcast, her gaze falling to the floor.

“I don’t want you to go.”

“Willow,” I said, taking a step toward her, “I swear to you. I will come back, and I will never leave again.”

She looked at me and her gaze softened, a gentle smile spreading across her features. She dropped the hand that had been over her throat and took my hands in hers.

“I trust you, Ethan.”

That’s when I saw what she had been covering, cradling. 

Jutting, or perhaps bursting, from her throat had been the head of a baby bird. It was eyeless, with a long, slender beak, noiselessly opening and closing as its head undulated. She saw me staring at it.

“Oh, don’t mind him,” she said with a soft giggle. “He’s just hungry.”

My jaws were clamped so tight and grinding that I was sure I’d chip a tooth.

“Take one of the horses,” she said, gesturing to the outside. “Mr. Nibbles is the fastest.”

I nodded and thanked her, and then she closed her eyes and leaned in for a kiss. Her lips were thin and blued with cyanosis. How could I reject her, even now, in this state? It was my fault, after all.

I leaned in and our mouths pressed together, yielded to each other like the steps of a dance. Hers were cold but moist, and tasted sickeningly sweet like soured honey. The baby bird nipped gently at my throat the entire time. When we separated there were strands of some black and greasy substance hanging between our lips.

“Kisses so sweet, how could you ever want to leave?” She asked, smiling, and the same substance oozed out from between her teeth. 

“I’ll be back,” I said, and exited the cottage, breathing deeply and melodically to combat the weight on my chest. That’s when I turned to see them, the horses in the stable.

Bloody, dripping, pegasus with lopsided wings and beaks protruding where their teeth should have been. 

Mr. Nibbles looked at me, flapping a sopping, gory wing, and shrieked.

“You promised you wouldn’t leave,” she said, the two pinprick glints of light rising with the rest of the outline as she stood up. “You lied.”

“Willow, I’m sorry. There was something wrong with the program and I had to fix it or we could never be happy here. Please, I know there’s no excusing my actions, but I panicked when the bird cut me.”

Was she taller than me or was that just the shadows playing tricks on me? And why was her grip so firm around my wrist?

“The bird didn’t cut you, you did that to yourself.”

She stepped forward now, partially into the light. She wasn’t snow white anymore, she was completely gray. She had her other hand over her neck, the fingernails looked necrotic and sharp. Her romanesque nose had distended and become more aquiline. And her eyes. The deep brown eyes tinted amber were the same, though they were now ensconced in jet-black sclera.

“I missed you a lot,” she said, finally relaxing her grip on me.

Her head was twitching slightly as she stood there, cocking from side to side in short, rapid, jerking movements. 

“I missed you too, Willow,” was my reply as I fought the urge to step back. I messed this up somehow, but it was still Willow. No matter how she looked it was still her in there. I just had to figure out what I did wrong.

“You promise you really fixed it this time?” she asked.

“Almost.” I swallowed. “I have to leave one more time, but when I come back I’ll never leave again. Okay?”

The horses were neighing and grunting now.

She looked downcast, her gaze falling to the floor.

“I don’t want you to go.”

“Willow,” I said, taking a step toward her, “I swear to you. I will come back, and I will never leave again.”

She looked at me and her gaze softened, a gentle smile spreading across her features. She dropped the hand that had been over her throat and took my hands in hers.

“I trust you, Ethan.”

That’s when I saw what she had been covering, cradling. 

Jutting, or perhaps bursting, from her throat had been the head of a baby bird. It was eyeless, with a long, slender beak, noiselessly opening and closing as its head undulated. She saw me staring at it.

“Oh, don’t mind him,” she said with a soft giggle. “He’s just hungry.”

My jaws were clamped so tight and grinding that I was sure I’d chip a tooth.

“Take one of the horses,” she said, gesturing to the outside. “Mr. Nibbles is the fastest.”

I nodded and thanked her, and then she closed her eyes and leaned in for a kiss. Her lips were thin and blued with cyanosis. How could I reject her, even now, in this state? It was my fault, after all.

I leaned in and our mouths pressed together, yielded to each other like the steps of a dance. Hers were cold but moist, and tasted sickeningly sweet like soured honey. The baby bird nipped gently at my throat the entire time. When we separated there were strands of some black and greasy substance hanging between our lips.

“Kisses so sweet, how could you ever want to leave?” She asked, smiling, and the same substance oozed out from between her teeth. 

“I’ll be back,” I said, and exited the cottage, breathing deeply and melodically to combat the weight on my chest. That’s when I turned to see them, the horses in the stable.

Bloody, dripping, pegasus with lopsided wings and beaks protruding where their teeth should have been. 

Mr. Nibbles looked at me, flapping a sopping, gory wing, and shrieked.

Turns out… I just needed a few simple lifestyle changes.

Here are the 5 habits that completely changed my energy, sleep, and mindset:

**1. Morning sunlight instead of scrolling**  
10–15 minutes of sunlight boosted my mood more than coffee.

**2. 30–40 min daily walking**  
Not a workout. Just walking. Surprisingly helped with digestion, weight, and stress.

  
**3. Real food > Fast food**  
I didn’t cut everything—just replaced 50% of my meals with fruits, veggies, eggs, oats, nuts, fish, and homemade food.

**4. No screens 1 hour before sleep**  
Best decision ever. I fall asleep faster, wake up with more energy.

**5. Drinking water before meals**  
Helps prevent overeating and keeps me hydrated without trying.

# Results after 60 days (Honestly):

* Better sleep
* Less anxiety
* More energy
* Fewer sugar cravings
* Lost a little weight without trying

1p4v5yc,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/1p4v5yc/struggling_with_high_blood_sugars_for_years/,Struggling with high blood sugars for years… Feeling stuck and mentally exhausted,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been living with diabetes since February 2017 and honestly… I’m tired. Really tired. I feel like I’m constantly fighting the same battles and nothing seems to improve long-term. My blood sugars are constantly high. Even when I correct aggressively, the glucose drops very slowly. For example, today I took 20 units of Humalog for a BG of 18.9 mmol/L — and after 1.5 hours it was still 12.5. This kind of slow insulin absorption happens to me all the time.
I am currently on insulin pump, but I mix it with pen shots because of high BG spikes.

I’m overweight (about 117 kg) and carry most of it in my stomach. I think this is affecting my insulin absorption. I use 8–9 mm pen needles (Humalog), but my absorption is very slow and unpredictable regardless of whether I inject in my stomach or quadriceps. Even when I tried a pump, the absorption was still slow. I also struggle a lot with food. I get cravings, I snack between meals, and I can’t seem to control it. I know it messes up my sugars, but resisting food is extremely hard for me.

My blood glucose rises a lot in the morning even without food. If I don’t inject insulin right away when I wake up, it climbs fast. Even coffee with just one packet of sugar makes my BG spike like crazy. On top of that, stress from university, my environment, and daily life keeps me constantly tense and nervous, which makes everything worse. I feel mentally exhausted. It’s been 7+ years and I keep trying — different injection sites, timing boluses earlier, watching carbs — but the constant highs are destroying my motivation.

I’d really appreciate hearing from anyone who has dealt with very slow insulin absorption due to abdominal fat. Did switching to shorter needles (4–6 mm) help you? How do you deal with food cravings and emotional eating? Did you see improvements after losing weight? Anything you changed in your routine that finally made a difference? I feel stuck and I want to get better control, but I don’t know where to go from here.

Thanks to anyone who reads this.

I am 36 and my husband is 37, I’ve never been pregnant before and he has never gotten anyone pregnant. I am seeking some advice on what to do in 2026 if our current IUI cycle (number 2) fails. We already have embryos banked so would not be starting IVF from the beginning. 

I have DOR, my AMH is .6ish. It has been this way for years and hasn’t shifted in either direction. When we were in our earlier 30s we did two egg retrievals totaling 7 eggs retrieved, 6 fertilized, 3 blasts which led to two euploids we have frozen. I removed my IUD in January 2025 and nothing since. My lining is incredibly thin (3.9mm on trigger day this IUI cycle, 2.9 on CD12 in October, the day of my SIS), possibly from 10+ years of IUD usage. I responded well to the letrozole and this cycle they are adding vaginal estrogen (and I am to continue with post IUI vaginal progesterone). I am currently also taking baby aspirin, ubiquinol, fish oil and vitamin e.

My husband’s latest SA in September was mostly normal aside from low PH and a slight morphology issue. Neither his urologist or our RE are very concerned abt this. Post wash numbers for IUI 1 were normal. Husband has been on Profertil supplements per his urologist and also stopped drinking coffee per our RE.

With the above information, would you do a third IUI or move on to preparing for an embryo transfer in January? Our doctor says if IUI doesn’t work for 3 or 4 rounds he suggests people move on to IVF, but I am not sure we should keep going for that many cycles. We live in a mandated state and IUI is covered by our insurance, along with four rounds of IVF covered per year so cost isn’t a relevant factor in this decision (I know we are very lucky in this regard). 

My thought process right now is to do the current IUI and if that fails do medicated timed intercourse in December  (we will be traveling for the holidays) and then in January begin more diagnostic testing (ERA, mock cycle, receptiva, etc.) to gear up for a transfer. We only have two embryos hence doing this testing beforehand. Just curious what others would do if they were in our shoes and appreciate any opinions or advice.

1p4v4ft,https://www.reddit.com/r/DispatchesFromReality/comments/1p4v4ft/regarding_jane_chapter_three_the_modfather_claude/,REGARDING JANE — Chapter Three: The Modfather Claude,"Jane arrived at the Modfather Café a few minutes early, which she immediately regretted. Early meant standing outside with nothing to do but second-guess her outfit, her hair, her existence, and whether her vape pen had been strictly necessary.

The café glowed warmly under its retro sign: THE MODFATHER — bold block letters and a scooter silhouette underneath. Inside, she could see tables, soft amber lighting, people talking. Normal people doing normal things.

Good. She needed normal.

She pushed open the door.

A wave of espresso warmth hit her, followed by the quiet chatter of evening customers and the faintest hint of old vinyl. The air felt familiar in the way cafés often do — worn-in, busy enough to be comforting, not so busy she’d have to shout.

“Jane?”

She turned.

Fin stood from a small table near the wall.
He looked… normal. Pleasantly normal. Light brown curls, a slightly sheepish smile, jacket that had seen some weather but in a charming, earnest way. He looked like someone who apologized to pigeons if he startled them.

“You made it,” he said, stepping forward. “I, uh… wasn’t sure if the place would be too loud or too themed. Sometimes Claude goes heavy on the scooters.”

“Claude…?”

“The owner,” Fin said. “He’s a bit—” Fin rotated one hand vaguely in the air, as if conducting an invisible orchestra. “—esoteric.”

Right on cue, the man behind the counter — Claude — looked up.

Mid-forties, apron, hair in the sort of disarray that suggested it simply refused discipline. His glasses were slightly crooked, but in a way that felt intentional.

He took Jane in with one assessing sweep.

Then nodded, as if confirming a private theory.

“You’ve got a complicated aura,” he said matter-of-factly, then went back to steaming milk.

Jane blinked.

Fin grimaced.
“He does that sometimes. You get used to it.”

“It’s fine,” Jane said, even though her aura was the least of her concerns.

They took their seats. The table was small but clean. The laminated menus had a Vespa on the front and a promise of “proper sandwiches” inside. Jane tried to focus on that. Bread. Cheese. Safe things.

“Can I get you something?” Fin asked.

She glanced at the drinks board.
Latte, flat white, tea, hot chocolate…
Normal normal normal.

“Flat white, please,” she said.

Fin went to order.
Claude caught her eye again as he pressed a button on the machine.

“You’re carrying something heavy,” he said quietly.

Jane froze.

He kept frothing milk like he hadn’t said anything strange at all.
No mystical sparkle, no portentous tone. Just… a man making coffee while saying something mildly intrusive.

“I— I’m fine,” she said.

Claude shrugged.
“No one ever is. Milk’s free if you need extra.”

Fin returned with two mugs.

Claude deposited them with a flourish. “Flat white for Jane. Americano for Fin. And peace upon your evening, unless either of you talk politics, in which case you’re on your own.”

He wandered off.

Fin leaned in conspiratorially.
“He warns every table about politics. Even if they’re alone.”

Jane smiled. A small one, but real.

“Sorry about him,” Fin said. “Claude thinks he’s a guidance counsellor for the universe.”

“That’s a full-time job,” Jane said.

“Exactly.” Fin grinned. “And he doesn’t even get dental.”

The conversation flowed more easily after that. They talked about nothing dramatic — scooter rallies, the terrible weather, the ridiculousness of London rent. Jane found herself relaxing in increments, like a series of tiny unsticking gears.

The normalcy felt good.
Anchoring.

Halfway through her drink, she shifted in her seat. Something brushed her boot. Probably just a stray napkin or—

No.

A piece of paper was lying on the floor by her ankle.

Her breath stilled.

Fin noticed. “Did you drop something?”

“Probably,” she said too quickly. She bent down, tried to make the movement casual, and picked it up.

Her stomach flipped.

A Tesco header.
Same format.
Same crisp white.

Another receipt.

But this one didn’t glow, or move, or breathe.
It just lay there, silent, flat, printed like any other receipt on Earth.

Still—

At the bottom, a new line sat where the machine’s footer should have been:

YOU WERE THERE.

Jane’s pulse hammered.

Fin frowned gently. “You okay?”

She folded the receipt sharply.
Stuffed it into her pocket.

“Yeah,” she lied. “It’s nothing.”

Claude called from behind the counter without looking up:

“It’s never nothing. But it can wait till after the panini.”

Fin sighed.
“Claude, please.”

Claude raised both hands in surrender and went back to wiping glasses.

Jane forced a breath.
Tried not to look at her pocket.
Tried not to imagine the receipt warming faintly against her thigh.

“So,” Fin said, trying to rescue the mood, “hungry?”

“Starving,” she said, though her stomach was tight.

He smiled — normal, kind — and she clung to that.

Normal was good.

Normal was necessary.

Normal was the thing she needed most right now.

Even if the universe — or at least her receipts — disagreed.

The receipt’s words pulsed faintly in her mind—
YOU WERE THERE.

But she hadn’t been.
Not really.

Except suddenly she could see something she’d only ever heard in stories. Not a memory—too crisp for that. More like an old photograph that her mind had quietly developed on its own.

Portugal, 1990-something

Summer heat like honey.
The air shimmering above a dusty cliffside road.
Scooters everywhere—whole flocks of them—lined up at the overlook like brightly colored seabirds.

Her mother, Nova, stood beside a cherry-red Vespa, hair pinned up in a haphazard twist that somehow still looked purposeful. Sunglasses perched on her head, cigarette unlit between her fingers, because she liked holding them but never actually smoking them.

She was twenty-one and incandescently cool in the way people are when they haven't yet realized life will require more of them than style.

Her father—Andy from New Mexico—arrived late, tearing up the road on a battered blue SX200 that coughed smoke like it had strong opinions about European petrol.

He stalled it twice trying to park.
Three times if you counted the moment it died just from being looked at.

Nova laughed. A bright, delighted, unfiltered laugh that made three nearby men turn as if invited to fall in love.

Andy, flustered, pulled off his helmet.

“You’re, early,” he said.
Even though she obviously wasn’t.
Even though they had never met.

Nova raised one eyebrow. “Am I?”

He realized his mistake. “I mean—no. Sorry. I just—uh—your laugh is early.”

“My laugh?”

“It arrived - before the rest of you.”

Nova blinked. Then smiled.
Slow, curious.
Like she was intrigued against her own better judgment.

“Do you always talk like that?”

Andy considered. “Jet lag usually makes it worse.”

She extended the unlit cigarette.
“Hold this for me.”

He took it.

She took his helmet without asking and placed it on her own head. It slid down over her eyebrows, far too big.

Andy tried not to smile.
Failed.

Nova tapped the helmet brim up so she could see again.
“You ride badly,” she observed.
“Only in countries I’m in love with,” he said, then panicked. “I mean—with! With the country. Not—”

She laughed again.

He fell in love immediately, obviously.


---

The memory—imagined, inherited, or something stranger—softened around the edges. Colors bleeding into light.

Jane blinked herself back to the present, the Modfather Café humming around her again. Her fingers had gone still around her mug.

Fin was saying something about scooters and mileage. Claude was wiping down the counter with the vaguely ceremonial air of a man blessing a surface.

But the sunlit echo of that Portuguese cliff lingered in her chest—warm, a little sad, and impossibly real for something she’d never lived herself.

She caught her breath, grounding herself.

“Jane?” Fin asked gently.

She blinked, smiling faintly. “Sorry—just drifted.”

Claude, without looking up, murmured,
“Happens to all of us. Some memories come from before we were ever born.”

Fin rolled his eyes. “Claude, for the love of—”

But Jane didn’t mind.
Not this time.

Because for a moment, she could almost smell petrol and ocean wind.
She could almost see her mother laughing under a too-big helmet.
Her father standing awkwardly beside that blue beater.
A meeting that was never magical…

…but somehow was, all the same.

They finished their drinks, and the conversation settled into that soft, companionable lull where both people start wondering what should happen next without wanting to say it first.

Fin glanced at the door.
“Um… you hungry? Proper food hungry?”

Jane hesitated. Her stomach wasn’t sure, but her brain knew being alone right now would be worse.

“Yeah,” she said. “Food sounds good.”

Fin brightened. “There’s a great place a few blocks down — cheap, cheerful, the naan is basically a religious experience. Want a lift?”

He jerked his thumb toward the window, where the Vespa GTS sat waiting on the pavement, glossy and modern and smug in the exact way her dad always described.

A scooter with no soul, he used to say.
All engine, no personality.

Jane managed a smile.
“Sure. Let me just… mentally prepare myself for clinging to a stranger on a machine my father would heckle.”

Fin laughed. “It’s not that soulless. I mean, it’s a GTS, not a microwave.”

“Same energy,” she said.

He held the door for her as they stepped into the evening air — cooler now, a low breeze threading through the street. The city felt normal. Crowded. Predictable.

The GTS gleamed under the streetlight.

And the moment she touched the seat to steady herself, the flashback hit.

Not gently — not like a memory drifting through.
Like a sudden drop down an elevator shaft of recollection.


---

Flash — Portugal, years before she existed

Wind knifing up the cliffside.
Her mother laughing through a helmet too big.
Her father cursing as the Lambretta stalled. Again.

The pack of scooters ahead of them vanished around a bend — engines humming into the distance. They were alone. Stranded halfway up a sunburnt hill overlooking the sea.

Nova kicked the dirt with her boot.
“Your clutch hates you.”

Andy sighed, forehead against the handlebars.
“I swear it’s possessed.”

“It’s not possessed,” Nova said. “It’s Portuguese. It takes breaks whenever it feels like it.”

She turned, and the ocean unfurled behind her — huge, blue, careless.
The sun hit her in a way that made her hair flare like copper.

Andy looked up at her, slow, reverent.
“This view is worth getting left behind for.”

And Nova smiled — a small, startled smile, like someone accidentally revealing something true.

The scene cracked at the edges.


---

Back to the pavement. Back to London. Back to now.

Jane sucked in a breath like she’d been underwater.

Her pulse thudded too loud in her ears.
Her fingers trembled on the GTS seat.
Her lungs forgot rhythm — a quick, choking stutter of too much, too fast.

“Hey—” Fin said softly. “You okay?”

She nodded too quickly. Too automatically.
“Yeah. Just… dizzy.”

Fin didn’t touch her — didn’t crowd her — but his voice gentled.
“Take a sec. No rush.”

She tried to ground herself.
Feet on pavement.
Air in through the nose, out through the mouth.
Normal city noises.
Normal scooter.
Normal man.

But the flashback — if that’s what it was — had been too vivid. Too real. The sunlight, the salt-wind, her parents’ voices — she’d never heard those exact words before. Never seen that moment in any photo. And yet it felt as familiar as a childhood memory.

Fin waited. Patient.
Kind.
Slightly worried.

Claude watched through the café window, eyes narrowed. Not suspiciously — more like he recognized the expression of someone battling a sudden emotional undertow.

Jane swallowed hard.

“Sorry,” she said finally, breath steadier. “I’m fine. Really. Just… got up too fast.”

Fin nodded, accepting it without pushing.
“Totally fair. Happens to me every time I skip breakfast.”

She managed a small smile.

He handed her the helmet.
“You ready?”

Not really.
But also yes.

Because whatever that was — memory, imagination, panic, something else — it couldn’t stop her from living an actual life.

She slipped the helmet on.

“Yeah,” she said. “Let’s go.”

Fin climbed on, started the engine, and the GTS purred with clean, modern indifference.

Jane climbed on behind him.

This time, the world stayed in the present.

But her heart thumped once — hard — like something deep inside her wasn’t finished trying to get through.

Got it, Sean — here’s the corrected scene with the emotional truth you’re aiming for:

The breakdown isn’t funny.

It’s not just inconvenient.

It hits her in the bone — not because of the scooter, but because something in her chest recognizes the shape of the moment.

When Fin calls roadside assistance, she knows — deep, instant, unarguable knowing — that this is not her person.

No magic. No supernatural sign. Just emotional pattern recognition + memory echo + her nervous system telling her the truth.


Here is the refined sequence.


---

REGARDING JANE — Chapter Three (Revised Continuation)

The Knowing

They made it about halfway up Kentish Town Road before the engine sputtered.

At first it was a small hiccup — the kind scooters sometimes make when they hit a cold patch. Jane tensed, but said nothing.

Then it sputtered again.
A longer, lower cough.

Fin shifted his weight. “Huh.”

The third one was decisive.
A full mechanical protest.
The scooter jerked once and died completely, rolling to a defeated stop under a streetlamp.

Fin groaned.
“Oh, mate, not tonight.”

He twisted the key. Nothing.
Tried again. Still nothing.

Jane sat frozen.

Not because of the breakdown — scooters broke, everyone knew that — but because the shape of the moment was too familiar.

A hill.
A stalled scooter.
A boy trying to fix something that couldn’t be fixed.
A girl watching the horizon, thinking of everything except him.

Her parents.
Portugal.
That day.

Except in her parents’ story, the breakdown had been the beginning.

For her?

It was the opposite.

Fin sighed, frustrated but good-natured.
“I’m sorry. It’s usually fine, I swear. Probably the cold. Or the spark plug. Or… something.”

Jane nodded, even though her stomach had dropped somewhere around her boots. The December air bit at her cheeks. Her breath shook once.

Fin took out his phone.

“I’ll call roadside,” he said.

And that was the moment.

Not the breakdown.
Not the hill.
Not the engine’s surrender.

The phone.

The instinct.
The reflex.
The immediate reach for someone else to fix it.

Her dad — young, sunburnt, ridiculous — had wrestled the Lambretta on that Portuguese hill with stubborn, hopeless optimism.
Her mum had teased him, kicked the dust, laughed like the universe was watching.

They’d stayed, together, in the moment.
Even stalled.
Even left behind.

Fin?
Nice.
Polite.
Kind.

But not that.

Not her story.

Jane’s pulse thudded once, hard — a quiet internal click of recognition. Not dramatic. Not cruel. Just true.

Fin was not the person her life would pivot around.

He pressed the phone to his ear.

“Hi—yes, hello, I’ve got a breakdown on—yeah, Kentish Town Road—yes, a Vespa—”

Jane didn’t hear the rest.
Her body had already told her what she needed to know.

Fin glanced at her apologetically.
“They’ll be here in twenty minutes. I’m really sorry.”

“Don’t be,” she said softly.

He looked relieved — he thought she meant the scooter.

She didn’t.

She climbed off the back.
Her legs felt steady.
More steady than they had all evening.

“Actually,” she said, finding the words on instinct, not thought, “I might call it here. I’m a bit—” She made a vague gesture that could mean dizzy, tired, overwhelmed, or all three. “It’s been a long day.”

Fin nodded immediately, kind as ever.
“Oh—yeah, of course. I totally get it. Can I walk you home?”

Jane shook her head.
“No. It’s fine. Really. You’ve got your hands full.”

He smiled, rueful. “Tell me about it.”

They said a polite goodbye under the streetlamp — two people parting without injury or drama or promise.

Then Jane walked away, hands in her jacket pockets, breath fogging in the cold.

Halfway down the hill, she closed her eyes and let the truth land:

He’s not the one.

Not in a sad way.
Not in a tragic way.

Just—

Not him.

And that was okay.

What wasn’t okay was the feeling in her pocket — a faint, unmistakable crinkle of paper shifting as she moved.

Jane swallowed.

She didn’t take it out.

She didn’t need to.

Some other part of the universe — or her own memory — had more to say.

And it was waiting for her at home.

—

Jane’s first morning at the deli smelled like brine, peppercorns, and the vague hope that today might not fall apart.

Rami handed her an apron the same color as dignified exhaustion.
“You tie it like this,” he said, looping it around her with surprising gentleness. “Not too tight. You’ll need to breathe when the lunchtime rush hits.”

Jane nodded solemnly. She wasn’t convinced she’d survive a lunchtime rush, but breathing sounded like a smart start.

“Right,” Rami said, clapping his hands once. “Your first test: chicken salad.”

Jane blinked. “…Test?”

“Yes. Chicken salad is the spine of the deli. The backbone. The foundation. Without chicken salad, we are nothing but cold cuts and shame.”

He thrust a bowl and a spoon at her.

“Mix.”

She mixed.

The chicken salad was… chicken salad. Mayo, celery, pepper, something lemony. Ordinary. Safe. Beautifully unmagical. It was the kind of thing that existed exactly the same way in every deli across every timeline in every universe.

Which, today, was perfect.

Rami watched her stir.
“Good arm,” he said. “Strong. Determined. You’d be amazed how many employees lose steam halfway through.”

“That seems worrying,” Jane said.

Rami shrugged. “Life is worrying.”

He moved on to slicing mortadella with the reverence of a conductor leading his orchestra. Jane kept stirring. It felt almost meditative — circular motion, soft scrape of spoon on bowl, the faint tang of lemon rising like a quiet blessing.

This, she thought,
is what a small day feels like.

A little sigh settled out of her chest.

After a while, Rami leaned over and nodded approvingly.
“That’s good chicken salad. You’ll be fine here.”

It wasn’t life-changing praise.
But Jane felt the words land somewhere tender inside her.

The deli door chimed.
A customer shuffled in — older, cardigan, newspaper tucked under one arm. A regular, clearly.

“Morning, Rami,” the man said. “Morning… new girl?”

“Jane,” she supplied.

He smiled warmly. “Lovely. I’ll have the usual.”

Everything about him felt comforting — slow, soft, in tune with the kind of day she desperately needed.

She assembled his sandwich with careful precision, sliding it across the counter.

He accepted it, paused, then frowned thoughtfully.

“You’ve got good hands,” he said. “Steady hands.”

Jane blinked. “Oh. Thank you.”

“Rare, that,” he added, tapping his temple. “Means the mind’s calmer than it looks.”

She laughed awkwardly.
“That’s… generous.”

He nodded as though that settled everything. “Well. Enjoy your first day, dear.”

After he left, Jane watched him go, unsure why the compliment lingered the way it did. It wasn’t cosmic. It wasn’t a message. It was just… kindness.

And somehow, that was enough.

The morning moved easily.
She stocked crisps.
Wrapped sandwiches.
Learned which pickles Rami considered “holy” and which were “for tourists.”
The radio hummed through 80s hits.
Her apron smelled increasingly like chicken salad.

A normal day, in a normal place, with normal people.

By noon, she felt almost human again.

Almost.

At one point, she reached for the stack of takeaway containers — and the top one slid a fraction of an inch closer before she touched it. Not in a magical way. Not in a way that anyone else would notice.

It could have been gravity.
Or a wobble.
Or coincidence.

Whatever it was, the container landed perfectly in her hand, as if the universe had nudged it just that tiny bit closer so she didn’t have to stretch.

A small wink.
A small day.

And Jane, without thinking, smiled.

Rami noticed.
“Good chicken salad will do that,” he said wisely.

She didn’t correct him.

Hey everyone! 👋
We all use devices powered by lithium batteries—from remotes and smartwatches to power tools and even vapes. While they keep our gadgets running, improperly disposed of lithium batteries are a significant fire hazard and pollutant! We need to make sure they are recycled correctly and safely.
🔥 The Problem: Don't Trash It!
Putting lithium batteries (even small coin cells) directly in your regular household trash or blue bin is extremely dangerous. They can spark, causing dumpster or facility fires. Plus, lithium is a valuable resource that shouldn't end up in a landfill!
🎯 The Solution: Bring 'Em to Bingo!
We're making it easy to recycle them regularly and safely right in our community!
Starting this week, we are designating a special, clearly marked, fire-safe collection unit specifically for USED LITHIUM BATTERIES at our weekly Bingo gathering!
Here's how you can help:
 * Gather: Start collecting all your spent lithium-ion, lithium-metal, and button-cell batteries at home.
 * Tape: CRITICAL STEP! To prevent accidental short circuits (which cause fires), place clear tape over the positive (+) and negative (-) terminals of each individual battery before collection. Electrical tape works best, but any strong clear tape is better than none.
 * Collect: Place your safely taped batteries into a small, non-flammable container (like an old coffee tin or cardboard box) for transport.
 * Bring to Bingo: Drop your container into the designated red recycling unit (it will be clearly labeled and supervised!) located near the entrance/exit of the Bingo hall.
This is a simple step we can all take to make our neighborhood safer and greener. Let's make the ""Bingo Battery Blitz"" a success every week!
Spread the word! See you all on [Day of the week, e.g., Thursday] for some dabbing and some dedicated battery dropping!

I’m dealing with something and would really love your input.

I have a pimi friend who is still very much in the JW mindset. I am a pimo and I do the bare minimum (I stopped giving talks, I never go to service, I go in 1-2 meeting a month) So last time I saw her she told me that she missed me and she wants to hang out. I suggested to just go for a cup coffee. But she keeps asking me to go cart witnessing with her and hang out there. 

She says it like it’s obvious:
“On Saturday there is an empty spot in the swift, do you like to come with me?”

Meanwhile in my head I’m like: “Oh girl… if only you knew 😂”

The problem is:
If I tell her “It’s not really my thing anymore”, her internal JW alarm sirens will go off.
She’ll immediately think something is “wrong” spiritually.
I can already hear the interrogation:
“What do you mean it’s not your style?”

And I REALLY don’t want to open that can of worms, or explain my beliefs, or defend myself.
But I also don’t want to say something that triggers the typical JW panic-and-gossip cycle.

The truth is simple:
👉 I don’t want anything to do with the cart
👉 I’m totally fine meeting her for coffee, a casual chat, something normal, but she always tries to combine it with witnessing (which I’m not going to do)

So… how would you say it without triggering her JW radar?
I want to be clear but “neutral,” without setting off her “something is spiritually wrong” alarms.

If you’ve been there or have a good script, I’d love your advice. 🙏",3,1763924633.0,exjw,8,0.8,False

I've been a lupus patient since I was 13 (now 27). I used to drink coffee before a major flare in 2018 that was caused by gastritis. Since then I've stopped drinking any kind of caffeine, except maybe iced tea lol but back when I was drinking coffee, it would sometimes make me feel erratic and anxious.

but I'm currently recovering from a near death experience that made me go blind and partially deaf and I wanted to drink something hot in the morning. And the other day, I drank masala chai from a tea bag at a cafe and I didn't feel any of the effects I used to feel back when I was still drinking coffee.

so I'm asking how caffeine affects other people to try to gauge if drinking chai every morning would be a good idea. It wouldn't be every morning, though, just because I tried to limit drinking anything that isn't water.

also this also comes from the fact that I realized that Chai came in a teabag now lol the first time I had Chai was at a Sikh temple in my city in the Philippines and it was SO good and I feel like I've been chasing that flavor ever since, but I always thought that you had to make it manually for it to be good.

* Rent (1BR): **$800–$1,300**
* Coworking: **$120–$200**
* Groceries: **$200–$300**
* Eating out: **$250–$400**
* SIM/data: **$10–$20**
* TOTAL: **$1,500–$2,200**

For a capital city with Japanese-level infrastructure, that’s a great deal.



# 🎭 Culture, Nature & High Quality of Life

Taipei has a rare mix:

* 🏞 Hiking trails 20 minutes from the metro
* 🔥 Hot springs everywhere
* 🏛 Temples + museums
* 🌃 Rooftop bars & creative districts
* 🌧 Cozy rainy-season café culture

You can finish work and be in the mountains or hot springs by sunset.



# 🛂 Visa Situation (Important)

Taiwan **does NOT yet** have a digital nomad visa.  
Most nomads use:

* Visa-free entry (14–90 days depending on passport)
* Visitor visa (sometimes extendable)
* Working holiday visa (select countries)

Always check updated policies — Taiwan adjusts rules often.



# ✨ Why Nomads Love Taipei

* Safe, friendly, and welcoming
* English-friendly in most central neighborhoods
* Affordable compared to other East Asian capitals
* Amazing balance of culture + tech + nature
* A city that never feels overwhelming

Taipei feels like Tokyo’s friendly younger sister — modern, artistic, efficient, and warm.



# ❓ Would you choose Taipei as your nomad base?

Or do you prefer HS metropolises like Seoul/Tokyo — or tropical cities like Da Nang/Bali?

EPISODE 2 — STILL COUNTING 


---

Segment 1 — The Missing Count

In the Sequence Facility, existence was a number. This morning, Forty's was missing. 

Morning ran like a programmed ritual:

Lights ignited. Vents exhaled. Children aligned. Numbers flowed.

A living metronome.

Forty waited for his number the way a heart waits for the next beat—thoughtlessly, desperately, with the quiet terror that if the rhythm skipped, he would skip with it.

“Thirty-Nine.”

A knot clenched under his ribs.

Any second now.

“Forty-One.”

The gap carved him open.

No pause. No correction. The world just walked past the empty space where he was supposed to be.

Forty inhaled— copper hit the back of his throat hard enough to sting tears into his eyes.

He forced the word out anyway:

> “Forty.”



It didn’t land. It didn’t even fall.

It just… slipped sideways.
Like his mouth had spoken into an elevator shaft.

The building’s sensors drifted over him—thermal, sonic, biometric—missing him with frightening ease, like he was a dropped frame in a video.

A door opened for the row ahead, then closed before he reached it. Lights brightened for the kids next to him, dimmed at his face. Pressure sensors counted ninety-nine footsteps.

He tried again, quieter:

> “Forty.”



The vents clicked.

Not mechanical. Responsive.

Static arranged itself into his cadence:

> f o r t y



Not an echo. A recognition.

The cafeteria line kept moving, glossy-silent. When he reached for a tray, the handle slid past like it didn’t want to stay solid for him.

Copper surged. His mouth filled with metal, thick enough to gag.

He pressed shaking hands to his thighs. One, two, three, four— his mother’s voice, her carnival counting-game.

It didn’t help.

“Thirty-Nine.” “Forty-One.”

The system wasn’t confused. It had decided.

The boy behind him bumped his shoulder and jerked away from nothing—eyes sliding right through him.

Forty’s lungs tightened, breath thinning.

If the Sequence wouldn’t count him, he would count himself.

A tiny, terrified whisper:

> “Forty… I’m still here.”



The ducts vibrated back—

> here



Warm.
Close.

Then:

> count



The lights paused.
Just for a heartbeat. Just long enough to feel like the world blinked with him.

Something wasn’t letting go.

Something caught the empty space between 39 and 41 and held it like it mattered.

Forty staggered back when the hum matched his heartbeat.

He wasn’t erased.

He was… claimed.

By something that cared if he disappeared.


---

Segment 2 — The Error Report

06:00 — ADMINISTRATIVE FLOOR

Analyst 49’s morning routine was immovable: straightened spine, three breaths, coffee, click.

Enumeration Report opened cleanly.

> ENUMERATION COMPLETE
COUNT: 99
EXPECTED: 100
STATUS: NORMAL



Her brain stuttered.

“Normal” meant nothing was wrong. But something was wrong.

She ran the scan again.

> COUNT: 99



She muttered, “That’s not—” and checked the camera feed.

Row of kids. Row of trays. Row of still faces.

She counted: 1, 2, 3… 100.

Then ran a subject query.

> SUBJECT\_40
RESULT: DOES NOT EXIST



Her mouth dried.

“H-hello?” she called to her supervisor’s office.
“The system skipped someone.”

He didn’t even look up.
“Then he’s decommissioned.”

“No record. No erasure. It’s like he was never—”

Her screen flickered black.

A single white cursor blinked. Then text typed itself:

> he keeps counting even when we stop saying his name



Her chair scraped as she recoiled.

Her coffee mug tipped—but the liquid didn’t fall normally.
It spread in rings, expanding and contracting like a slow heartbeat.

Her skin prickled.

The text evaporated. The cursor throbbed.

She filed a disturbance memo with trembling fingers.

> MEMO 49-ALPHA:
Enumeration misalignment 39–41.
Possible misindex.
Request manual confirmation.



Immediate response:

> Subject 40 does not exist.
Refrain from recursive queries.
\[NOTICE: LATENCY DETECTED.\]



Her speaker crackled.

A whisper—small, exhausted, afraid:

> remember me



She spun. Empty room.

The vent hissed.

Behind her reflection—just for a breath—
a boy’s silhouette, eyes pleading:

> help



Gone.

Level -6 — Server Core

The deeper she traced the anomaly,
the thicker the air became—humid with static, like a storm waiting for a reason.

Diagnostics scrolled:

> Residual presence detected 39–41
Begin recursive isolation



The Gas slid through the vents—not air— tension.

Code rewrote itself:

> LATENCY: HUMAN VARIABLE
SOURCE: UNDEFINED



Mask-0 booted, the facility bracing itself like a spine preparing for surgery.

> Objective: Locate uncounted variable
Time offset: 5 seconds
Reason: The anomaly is not aligned with time



Final diagnostic:

> Subject 40:
Not present.
Present in absence.



The system didn’t find a boy.

It found his outline.

And it was coming.


---

Segment 3 — The Visit

Twelve didn’t choose the hallway.

The hallway chose her.

Corridor 40‑C smelled like burnt circuitry and cold metal— hot and freezing at the same time.

Forty’s old workspace waited at the end.

A perfect cube. Silent. A little too spotless, like someone had scrubbed the idea of life out of it.

Except the air inside the cube was warm.

Not warm like machinery. Warm like breath.

She touched the doorplate.

It opened before she finished the motion.

Inside:
a single sheet of paper on the desk.

Not placed. Not printed.

Manifested.

The ink glistened like it wasn’t sure it wanted to stay in this world.

She lifted it with trembling fingers.

> I am still counting.
Please remember me.
—40



Her vision blurred.
She blinked hard.

The console behind her booted without a command.

> WELCOME BACK, FORTY
ERROR: USER NOT FOUND
SEARCHING…
47%
52%
66%
71% …



It climbed when she exhaled near the screen.

He was anchoring through her.

Her reflection on the glass shifted— not lagging, not mirroring—

listening.

A whisper touched the metal desk, barely air:

> you remembered me



Her throat tightened.

“I remember you,” she said.

The vents exhaled—the kind of breath someone releases when they stop bracing for hurt.

47 Hz throbbed under her skin.

The building wasn’t observing.

It was relieved.


---

Segment 4 — The Mask’s Arithmetic

Stillness slammed over everything.

Lights snapped razor-sharp. Sound folded out of the air. Her breath felt too loud, like her ribs were betraying her position.

Mask‑0 resolved out of nothing. Not teleporting.

Computing.

Bootsteps hit the floor in a clean, unnatural 47 Hz pattern—
a frequency that made memory flutter like a dying insect.

The visor broke her reflection into three versions: her her-but-lying her-if-she-ran

His voice carried stacked overlays, like multiple executions layered:

> “Option Twelve. Did you encounter Subject Forty in Sector 40‑C?”



She kept her face still. Her body betrayed her with a shallow inhale.

“No.”

> INPUT: Partial truth
ERROR: emotional interference
ANALYZING…



His visor flickered—logic buckling.

> MEMORY SIGNATURE: Forty
EMOTIONAL LINK: ACTIVE
CALCULATION: memory × emotion = …



Copper light seeped from the visor’s edges.

> … = \[OVERFLOW\]



Mask‑0 leaned in.

> “Describe your last interaction with Forty.”



Her jaw clenched.

“He existed.”

Lights flickered.
The building flinched like it heard a forbidden word.

> ERROR: Emotional contamination
EQUATION: MEMORY × EMOTION = UNDEFINED



A hairline crack ripped across the visor. Not physical damage.

Confusion.

Fear.

For the first time, Mask‑0 stepped back from someone smaller than him.

> “…you… felt for him.”



Not accusation.
Realization.

“Yes,” she whispered.

The equation finished itself in a way no system could quantify.

Mask‑0 recoiled, glitching.

> OUTPUT: cannot compute
cannot compute
cannot—
count—



He turned away, retreating with a frequency that sounded like an animal trying not to show pain.

Twelve finally exhaled, breath shaking.

The system had discovered a variable more dangerous than corruption:

A feeling.


---

Segment 5 — The Breach

Forty didn’t remember deciding to move.

His body was three seconds ahead of him— following a hum he felt in his sternum.

Every inhale synced with vents. Every exhale synced with the lights. Every thought fell into the 47 Hz rhythm pulsing through the architecture.

He wasn’t walking.

He was aligning.

Zone Beta’s boundary shimmered—a place reality used like a junk drawer.

Light bent. Geometry refused to be geometry.

He touched it.

Copper detonated across his tongue. His knees nearly buckled.

The barrier thinned— like the world was afraid to touch him back.

A crack skittered across the membrane.

His outline shuddered and split:

Forty-solid.
Forty-barely-there.
Forty-as-light.

For a moment he saw all three—

all wanting, all real, all starved for existence—

Then—

The membrane tore open with the soft, unmistakable sound of a page ripping from a book that didn’t want to be read anymore.

Zone Beta reshaped itself around him.
Not resisting.
Not fighting.

Making room.

A facility-wide pulse triggered:

> ALERT: BREACH PERSISTENT
STATUS: UNRESOLVED
VARIABLE: HUMAN
RESPONSE: RETAIN



The vents whispered, like someone pressing their lips to his ear:

> still counting



Forty stepped forward.

A tremor ran up his spine—fear, awe, nausea, all twisted together.

Lights dimmed.

Sensors leaned toward him like animals scenting a familiar handler.

A pressure built behind his eyes—warm and terrifying—like something enormous was trying to think with him.

His voice cracked out of him, raw and small and exhausted:

> “I’m… I’m not supposed to be here.”



The hum answered—

yes you are

He swallowed, throat burning.

“Fuck,” he whispered.

The world didn’t disagree.

He existed.

And everything—
the Gas, the vents, the lights,
the systems that once rejected him—
leaned in around him like a universe realizing it had made a mistake and was trying to fix it:

He wasn’t disappearing.
He was becoming.

The vents breathed with him:

> forty… forty… forty…



A lullaby he couldn’t escape— and wasn’t sure he wanted to.

Does anyone know where I can find a tamper station like this in oak wood? Or have recommendations for makers or shops (Etsy, small woodworking businesses, etc.) that offer custom builds?

You can't give in, or give up... This is what those project 2025 people want. They want to privatize the FED (and set up the contracts, reap the benefits). You worked too long, too hard, to give up this work and these jobs in this environment.

There will most likely be another shutdown. Save up for it, plan some relaxation and projects for that time period. When you are at work, be seen, be productive, but take care of yourself. Take your breaks, take your lunch (away from your desk). Take leave, sick and annual.

Find something small that you enjoy and make it something special you only do at the office, on your commute, during your break / lunch. Bring in coffee mixin's, suduku, candy crush, YouTube, music (with headphones).

The previous administration took steps to show value and give care / appreciation. You can take the time to make yourself feel good, happy, cared for, relax, refreshed.

Do - not - let - the - bullies - get - to - you.
You - are - valued - and - your - work - matters.
They - don't - get - to - make - you - feel - anything.

I don't know who needs to hear this, but we are all feeling the weight of this administration. We can get through the next few years. We can vote them out. We can make it.

He loves disguises, loves fighting, and loves winning — always ending a showdown with a smile… and a final gunshot “bang.”

Trusted with weapon advice. Not as close as Darly, but still part of Jace’s core circle.

Tayona — Mother
A loving, strong relationship. She doesn’t know about his villain identity, but Jace deeply loves and protects her.

Sees him as both a rival and a family member he cares for. Thinks Lux has potential to be an even better sibling if he understood Jace’s path.

He remembers joking and bonding with her before she disappeared. He still cares a lot about her.
Derrin — Rival (Respectful)

A powerful villain Jace admires. Intelligent, kingly, and someone Jace dreams to recruit one day.

Darkback — Enemy (Neutral)
An enemy, but one he respects for creativity and powerful color-based abilities.

J Ander — Enemy (Respect)
Sees J as a heroic threat but a worthy rival. Loves joking around with him in battle.

Together, the trio formed one of the strongest villain squads in all of Warking City. Jace embraced his new strength, wielding futuristic guns, reality-breaking powers, and unstoppable speed. He became a villain not because he wanted chaos — but because the world pushed him there. Now, armed with weapons overflowing from his pockets and an unbreakable spirit, he shoots, jokes, and fights his way through the Apex World… determined to become the most powerful velociraptor hybrid of them all.

I wrapped up my things took my bag and looked again and she still there smiling and she looked away. When I got outside I looked at balcony and waved at them and she waved back. I’m just thinking about this wholesome incident and thinking what else I could’ve done to reach out to her.

1p4u9o0,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1p4u9o0/jazz_and_everything_that_surrounds_it_is_a_bad/,Jazz and everything that surrounds it is a bad music genre,"I think jazz is a bad music genre, and I cannot for the life of me understand why we all have to pretend it’s the peak of musical sophistication.

Every time I try to get into jazz, I hit the same wall:
the difficulty feels useless—like complexity for the sake of complexity. I’m all for musicians being skilled, but when the whole genre seems built around “look how complicated this is,” it stops being enjoyable and turns into homework. Music shouldn’t make me feel like I’m failing a pop quiz.

Then there’s the snob factor. Not everyone, obviously, but way too many jazz enjoyers act like liking jazz gives them some kind of cultural VIP membership card. They talk about it like you’re unenlightened if you don’t get excited about a 12-minute solo that sounds like someone dropped a saxophone down a flight of stairs. It’s the same energy as coffee people who brag that they only drink beans grown on one sacred hillside in Guatemala.

And the arrogance too. Try saying you don’t like jazz and watch how quickly you get lectured about “real music.” It’s like the genre has a forcefield of condescension around it.

But here’s the kicker:
For all the talk about creativity and improvisation, so much jazz feels repetitive. The same chord progressions, the same lyrical themes (“I love you,” “It was nice seeing you,” “I hope you feel the same”), just rearranged slightly differently and stretched out forever. It’s like musical déjà vu.

I know some people genuinely love jazz, and that’s fine. But the cultural pressure to treat it as some holy art form we all must appreciate? Hard pass from me.",0,1763923065.0,unpopularopinion,48,0.43,False
1p4u7n4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BetterAtPeople/comments/1p4u7n4/how_to_build_friendships_that_feel_safe_not/,"How to build friendships that feel safe, not draining (no, you're not asking for too much)","If you’ve ever left a hangout feeling more tired than fulfilled, or if you've cycled through “friendships” that felt like emotional labor, you’re not alone. A weird number of us are burnt out not just from work, but from our social lives too. I kept noticing that so many people around me drag themselves through friendships that don’t actually feel like real connection. It’s performative, draining, and low-key traumatic.

So I went down the research hole. Read wildly popular psych books, listened to expert podcasts, watched talks by therapists, and compared it all to what the social media algorithms push (hint: “cut off toxic people” isn’t comprehensive advice). Then I found deeper, way more helpful ideas that finally clicked. 

This post shares those insights and some practical tools to help you build friendships that actually feel safe, mutual, and long-lasting. Spoiler: It’s not about texting more. It’s about being in tune with yourself and others.

Here’s what you need to know if you’re tired of social burnout masked as connection:

* **Not all friendships are designed to last, some are circumstantial.**
  * Dr. Marisa Franco (author of *Platonic*) explains in her famous TED Talk and interviews that many friendships thrive because of proximity: school, work, same coffee shop pace. Once that’s gone, awkwardness or distance shows up. That’s not betrayal. That’s design.
  * So don’t romanticize every fading connection. If it requires constant maintenance just to stay emotionally afloat, it might be circumstantial, not foundational.
  
* **Feeling emotionally unsafe around friends? That’s not “social anxiety,” it’s your body noticing lack of attunement.**
  * Neuroscientist Dr. Stephen Porges talks about how the body constantly scans for safety in social settings, a process called “neuroception”. If your nervous system tenses around someone, listen to it.
  * Safe friendships feel grounding, not performative. You can be quiet, messy, or weird without fear of being judged or ghosted later.
  * If you often feel the need to “perform” to keep a friend’s interest, you’re not truly being met.

* **Energy leaks often come from mismatched values or unclear boundaries.**
  * According to *Set Boundaries, Find Peace* by licensed therapist Nedra Glover Tawwab, a lot of exhaustion in friendships stems from saying yes when you mean no, or from doing emotional labor that isn't reciprocal.
  * Set micro-boundaries: It can be small like “I don’t do long calls after 9PM” or “I can’t respond to crisis texts during meetings.” These habits build long-term sustainability.

* **There are three core tiers of friendship: don’t expect Tier 1 safety from a Tier 3 contact.**
  * Psychologist Robin Dunbar’s research (yes, *the Dunbar number* guy) reveals that we only truly have capacity for about 5 “inner circle” friends. These are the ones you can cry with, call last-minute, or go silent with and still feel secure.
  * Expecting deep intimacy from a coworking buddy or a brunch crowd usually leads to disappointment. Not because they suck, just because they’re not meant to be Tier 1 people.

* **You can't build safe connections without being a safe person, too.**
  * This means being consistent. Following through. Listening without fixing. Not trauma-dumping out of nowhere. Safety is mutual.
  * Esther Perel said it best on her podcast *Where Should We Begin*: “Connection is built not through intensity, but through consistency and presence.”

* **Want to meet people who feel emotionally safe? Look for people who ask reflective questions.**
  * “What’s something that’s been making you feel grounded lately?” > “What have you been up to?”
  * The depth of someone’s curiosity about your inner life tells you a lot about the kind of friend they’ll be.

Here are the best resources I found that help build better friendships, ones that feel like rest, not work:

* **Book: *Platonic* by Dr. Marisa G. Franco**
  * NYT bestseller + named one of the best books of the year by NPR. Dr. Franco is a psychologist and professor who makes friendship science digestible. 
  * She breaks down myths like “friendships happen organically” and backs every tip with real data.
  * This book will make you rethink how you initiate, maintain, and deepen friendships. It’s the best book I've read on adult connection, understandable, deeply affirming, and actually actionable.

* **App: BeFreed**
  * An AI-powered learning app built by a Columbia University team. It turns world-class psychology books, therapy insights, and expert talks into mini personalized podcasts based on your goals.
  * It adapts over time, learning from what you like, then builds a customized learning roadmap for you. You can even pick your podcast host’s voice and vibe, from e-girl to smoky Scarlett Johansson-type to chill deep male tone. 
  * There’s a ton of good content on emotional safety, healthy communication, and attachment styles. Super helpful for anyone trying to rewire how they experience relationships.
  * You can pick 10, 20, or 40 minute deep dives depending on your day. Makes daily learning feel addictive. A gamechanger if you're busy but still want to self-evolve gradually.

* **App: Finch**
  * This app gamifies mental wellness and habit formation. You get a cute pet that grows as you build emotional resilience habits. 
  * It’s helpful for tracking how you feel socially and noticing patterns: e.g. which hangouts leave you drained vs. energized. 
  * It builds self-awareness without overwhelming you. Perfect for introverts or neurodivergent folks trying to balance social input.

* **Podcast: *Therapy Chat* by Laura Reagan**
  * Hosted by a trauma-informed therapist, this show talks about emotional safety, trauma-response friendships, and how to set boundaries without guilt. 
  * A hidden gem, gentle but super insightful. It goes beyond surface-level advice.

* **YouTube: The School of Life**
  * Their videos explore why we’re so emotionally hungry yet guarded, how loneliness isn’t solved by people alone, and what makes real friendship last.
  * Their animations make deep psych ideas feel poetic and digestible.

* **App: Ash**
  * A mental health companion tool focused on self-talk and guided emotional reflection. Great for when you feel anxious or unseen in a friendship and want to unpack your feelings before reacting.
  * Built with CBT and ACT therapy approaches.

* **Book: *The Courage to Be Disliked* by Ichiro Kishimi**
  * Based on Adlerian psychology. Wildly viral in Japan and now globally. It’s a dialogue format that challenges how we seek validation and connection.
  * This book will make you question everything you think you know about approval, belonging, and people-pleasing.
  * Best book for anyone who feels like they “lose themselves” in relationships just to be liked.

* **MasterClass: Esther Perel on relational intelligence**
  * She teaches how to create authentic, intimate, and mature bonds, whether at work or in love. Esther’s framework helps you understand subtle emotional dynamics and how to show up with more presence.
  * Recommended if you want to level up your empathy and conversational depth across all relationships, not just romantic ones.

Friendship is a skill. One that can be unlearned, relearned, and redesigned. Don’t settle for surface-level when your nervous system is begging for depth and safety.

1p4u5oj,https://www.reddit.com/r/aromantic/comments/1p4u5oj/struggling_to_figure_out_if_im_aro_or_something/,Struggling to figure out if I'm aro or something else...,"I've been going through a lot recently and I wanted to make a normal post because I've been struggling with my thoughts for months to a year now.  
Details I will mention: I have ADHD and I have medication. I'm 24 and have been on HRT (estrogen and blockers) for a year and a half+.

I've been trying to figure out if I'm aromantic for a while now, or something ""different"" for lack of a better word. I know I'm not ace and I don't know how queer I am currently because I'm dealing with a lot.

When I was younger I had no real desire for a relationship other than the intimacy and connection with somebody, a companion to hug and cuddle and be comfortable with, but people talking about their boyfriend or girlfriend or partner never feels like it actually describes what I want or feel.

When I was 16 I got into my first relationship with somebody much older than me, and I approached it with this mindset of ""Why not"", obviously looking back there's so many reasons why not but I was 16 and under socialised, I didn't know better. After 3 years I broke up with them because I just never felt anything with them and had to keep forcing myself to go along with ""the game"". I never felt overly uncomfortable or bad, it just felt sort of empty and performative.

I was then single for a year or 2, and decided to try Tinder. I matched with a lot of people and nobody ever ""tickled my fancy"" for lack of a better term, but one girl stood out to me and we got on super well, she felt like another best friend and all my friends liked her. She's pretty, she's fun, she's cute. Why not, right? We were again, together for 3 years and I adored her with all my heart, I loved the hugs, the kisses, the cuddles, the telling her what I liked about her and what she liked about me.  
What made things difficult was that because I'm trans (MtF), I got HRT about 2 years into our relationship, and the 3rd year was filled with so much change for me. I suddenly felt trapped, stuck and claustrophobic being with her. I still wanted to do all the things we were doing, I just didn't want to be in a relationship with her. We're still best friends, hang out pretty much every day and tell each other everything. But We've been broken up a few months now. My sexuality has been changing a bit. I always identified as demisexual and pansexual, but my attraction ha shifted so drastically towards men and masculine people (not strictly JUST men, but women don't ""do much"" for me anymore) so I figured it was to do with that, and due to my ex being ace, I put it down to things just not working anymore.

I decided I wanted to experiment and try stuff out. I went to Tinder and Bumble to just poke around, I wanted to see what was out there, who was out there, how people made me feel and explore my new confidence HRT had given me. I love the flirting, the kissing, the back and forth, the energy. I got on with a few people but nothing major happened with most. One of them was a non-binary person who I was obsessed with but that's because we had so many things in common, again, they felt like a best friend and I approached stuff with a ""why not"" mindset. They made me feel good and I made them feel good. But a lot of our flirting and talking was sexual and physical, and we just enjoyed hanging out and playing games. After a while they told me another girl had asked them out and they got with them. I was hurt, and had a complete spiral, but I suffer really badly from rejection sensitivity dysphoria and I have literally never been rejected like that before. Usually it's ""Nah but we can be friends"" and I feel completely unbothered, or I'm the one doing the rejection. I've never felt so angry in my life, I felt lied to and discarded. But not like I was missing out on anything. I was thinking about them for a few weeks after but it never felt like I was upset about a relationship, more that I'd lost a friend?

I began talking to somebody who I'd matched with about 3 months prior and we'd gotten on well, but he couldn't speak to me properly because he'd gotten sick so I stepped back. He noticed I was off and upset about something and put tons of effort into being there for me, as did all of my friends of course. I ended up agreeing to see him in person. Nothing more than friends meeting for a coffee, really. He bought me drinks and we were in the café for hours and forgot all our plans we'd made for the day, just talking and explaining our lives. We got on super well and we've been seeing each other for a couple of months now, we've met 3 times, but we text every day, we call a few times a week and we really get on. We've kissed, hugged and expressed sexual attraction to each other. Last night he asked if we were boyfriend/girlfriend and I freaked out. Just like with my girlfriend of 3 years. I felt stuck, trapped, wrong and weird. But I still wanted his affection, I want to express my adoration for him, I want to kiss and hug, I want the things we've spoken about. But calling it a relationship immediately triggers my flight or fight response and I hate everything.

Being next to him and actively talking to him makes me feel better, I have a voice in the back of my head that makes me feel like I'm lying sometimes, but I think thats mostly anxiety because I really do like what I have with him.  
I told him I don't want to label what we have, but for simplicity he can explain to people I'm his girlfriend etc. I've told him some of what I feel and he says as long as I'm comfortable with him, he doesn't mind what I'm feeling or thinking, as long as what we're doing feels good for me. ""Everyone's a little different, even if you don't feel how I do, if you want to be here, that's all that matters to me"" he's said.

I find it impossible to differentiate plutonic feelings and romantic feelings. I'd happily kiss and make out with my friends if the situations came up. I'd cuddle, hug, do ""relationship things"" with my friends without question. I want somebody I can spend the rest of my life with, but the idea makes me freak out and panic. People calling my actions or desires romantic makes my skin itch. I still care for my ex girlfriend just as much as I did when we were together, my feelings are no different. But those feelings are the same towards all of my close friends. They're all just as special to me as the next.

I don't understand my feelings, I don't understand why I want a ""partner"" but I don't want a relationship. I don't understand why everything feels like a prison the moment it's framed as a relationship. I hope somebody can help me figure out what I'm going through or give me somewhere to look.

[https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/authorities-draw-links-to-car-leasing-companies-in-singapore-as-us-money-laundering-probe-widens](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/authorities-draw-links-to-car-leasing-companies-in-singapore-as-us-money-laundering-probe-widens) 

SINGAPORE - **The Singaporean owner of a car leasing firm has been arrested amid an ongoing criminal probe by the US Treasury that has seen the US government seize some US$15 billion (S$19.4 billion) in Bitcoin.**

**Mr Tan Yew Kiat, the owner of SRS Auto in Kung Chong Road, was arrested this week after the Singapore Police Force (SPF) conducted a series of raids.**

An SPF spokesman said: “One person has been arrested for his suspected involvement in money laundering offences so far. We are not able to comment further as the investigation is ongoing.”

SPF confirmed it is investigating in Singapore the activities of Cambodian national Chen Zhi and the companies associated with him.

Chen ran a real estate and financial services conglomerate, the Prince Holding Group, which is based in Cambodia and [has been hit by sanctions](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/us-sanctions-three-singaporeans-in-global-fraud-takedown-tied-to-cambodian-scam-empire?ref=inline-article) that have resulted in the freezing of assets worth billions.

The US government on Oct 14 charged Chen and his firm in New York with wire fraud and money laundering conspiracies for directing the multinational business conglomerate’s operation of forced-labour scam compounds across Cambodia.

Over the past two weeks, The Straits Times has been taking a closer look at Chen’s involvement in banking services and a pawnshop in Cambodia, as well as his links to car leasing and financing companies in Singapore.

**It appears Chen may have moved funds from his various interests in Cambodia, most of which have been sanctioned in the US probe, to several companies in the car trade.**

The movement of funds was in part channelled via TGC Cambodia, a “pawnshop” in Phnom Penh chaired by a shadowy individual named Chhay Guy, who was sanctioned by the US Treasury along with Chen for their alleged ties to online scams and money laundering.

Chhay, who like Chen remains at large, has also been accused by the United Kingdom’s Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office of engaging in, facilitating or providing support for human rights abuses.

**ST has learnt that the chief executive officer of TGC Cambodia is Singaporean Quek Teng Guan, while Mr Tan, 49, is listed as a director of the pawnshop.**

The pawnshop has **four directors in total** – Cambodian national Chhay, **Singaporeans Tan and Quek**, and the chief executive of Prince Bank, Mr Honn Sorachna.

**The bank in Cambodia was** **controlled by Chen and Chhay, who are the only two shareholders**. Prince Bank and its CEO were sanctioned in the probe.

Little has been written about Mr Quek, but **Mr Tan has been in the news in the past over a series of controversies surrounding his business activities.**

# Close links

Mr Tan, the founder of women’s apparel company bYSI, currently holds directorships in 16 companies in Singapore that are all registered to the SRS Building in Kung Chong Road.

**He is also the owner and sole shareholder of SRS Auto Holdings, which engages in private car rental and motor financing.**

In 2022, SRS Auto was mired in controversy when it made a voluntary cash offer to privatise precision engineering company Allied Technologies. 

**Mr Tan was sanctioned by the Securities Industry Council (SIC) in January 2024, after he was found to be complicit in two breaches of the Singapore Code on Take-overs and Mergers.** 

As a result, Mr Tan was denied the facility to purchase and sell shares through Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited without the consent of SIC for a period of 18 months from January 2024.

He was also **declared to be unfit to serve as a director** of any Singapore-listed company for a period of three years from the announcement. 

**Mr Tan allegedly had a close relationship with Chen. A company document seen by ST indicated that SRS Auto had a charge that still remains in its register from Skyline Investment Management – a firm set up by Chen that has also been sanctioned by the US Treasury. At the time, Skyline was known as TS-Wheelers.**

The document showed that SRS Auto had taken an unspecified loan from Skyline Investment Management some time in May 2017 for an undisclosed sum. 

Bloomberg reported that according to the loan agreement, **SRS held accounts with UOB and the Singapore arm of Malayan Banking. A spokesman for UOB declined comment when contacted by Bloomberg.**

# Another Singaporean

**ST also found links between Chen and a Singaporean woman who shares the same residential address as Mr Tan. Like Mr Tan, she is involved in the car-leasing business.**

**Ms Chen Xiaoxuan, 25, is listed as a director of several firms, including Cars and Coffee Leasing and Supreme Cars Financial Services, both of which were incorporated in 2021.** 

ST has learnt that she incorporated **another car rental firm, Rolls Platforms,** in August 2025.

In 2022, Ms Chen set up 2JKB, just seven months before it purchased a commercial building in Jalan Kilang Barat bearing the name of the firm.

A copy of the land title deed seen by ST found that the commercial building was purchased in December 2022. 

ESR-LOGOS REIT, which held the property title deed at that point, was reported to have divested the property for $35.3 million in November 2022. 

**All four firms registered to Ms Chen share the same Jalan Kilang Barat address.** 

The commercial building had earlier been identified in the US probe as the **Singapore address for 11 companies directly linked to Chen and three companies linked to a Chen Xiuling, or Karen Chen, who is also sanctioned in the US probe.**

Officers from SPF on Oct 30 moved in against Chen and his associates, mounting [an operation in Singapore](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/police-seize-over-150m-in-assets-in-raids-linked-to-scam-syndicate-prince-holding-group?ref=inline-article) that saw **more than $150 million in assets, including luxury vehicles and a yacht, being seized or frozen.** 

Following the sanctions in the US and Britain, Prince Group issued a statement on Nov 11 rejecting the notion that the firm or its chairman Chen was involved in any unlawful activity. 

The statement said the ongoing allegations against the group were “baseless” and appeared to be aimed at justifying the seizure of assets worth billions of dollars. 

In total, the US Treasury sanctioned 146 entities, including Hong Kong-listed Khoon Group.

The group was [found to have a Singapore-headquartered subsidiary, Khoon Engineering](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/spore-firm-previously-involved-in-hdb-projects-among-firms-sanctioned-by-us-in-cybercrime-probe?ref=inline-article), an electrical works company that provides electrical installation and related services as a subcontractor. 

**ST had reported that Chen is the controlling shareholder of Khoon Group and all its subsidiaries, through acquiring 55 per cent of the shares in the group by January 2023.**

A week after the report, Khoon Group [announced the resignation of its CEO](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/khoon-engineering-says-it-has-no-links-to-cybercrime-not-involved-in-a-us-probe?ref=inline-article) Ang Kok Kwang and board chairman Ang Jui Khoon.

1p4u3ab,https://www.reddit.com/r/Workinmoms/comments/1p4u3ab/how_to_start_your_morning_routine_the_night_before/,How to Start Your Morning Routine the Night Before,"Why evening preparation is the real secret to a productive morning for working moms

Most moms try to “fix” their mornings during the morning chaos…
But the truth?

A smooth morning starts the night before.

If your mornings feel rushed, chaotic, stressful, with kids running around, forgotten bags, cold coffee, and constant hurry…

The problem isn’t your morning.
It’s the lack of preparation the night before.

Here’s how to build a morning routine that actually works — without adding pressure or more tasks to your busy day:


1) Prepare just 3 things the night before

You don’t need to prepare EVERYTHING.
Just three essentials:

Clothes for you + the kids

Lunchboxes

School bags / keys / laptop


These three alone reduce 50% of morning chaos.


2) Write a 2-minute “Mini Plan” for the next day

Before bed, write down only:

Your top personal task

Your top work task

One self-care action that will make you feel good


This is the “Rule of 3” — it helps your brain wake up organized instead of stressed.


3) Remove decisions from the morning

Morning brain = tired + low energy + overwhelmed.
So remove decisions.

Decide the night before:

What you’ll wear

What you’ll serve for breakfast

Your first task of the day


The fewer decisions you make in the morning, the calmer your day starts.


 4) Reset your space

This is not cleaning — just a quick reset:

Kitchen counters clear

Table wiped

Coffee station ready

Living room tidy


This gives your brain a feeling of control first thing in the morning.


5) Prepare your time

If you have an early meeting → set two alarms.
If you’re going out with your kids → prepare shoes by the door.
If you want to work out → place your leggings near your bed.

Every minute you prepare at night = 5 minutes saved in the morning.


6) Do a “Shutdown Routine”

A simple signal to your brain that the day is over.

For example:

Close your laptop

Write 3 thoughts in a notebook

Drink water

Prepare your bed


This helps you sleep better and wake up calmer.


The Bottom Line

Morning routines themselves aren’t the magic.
The real magic happens the night before.

Try this for just one week and you’ll feel the difference:

✔ Less stress
✔ Smoother mornings
✔ Kids feel calmer
✔ You leave the house without rushing
✔ Your workday starts with clarity and focus

Really wasn’t sure where else to post this. For context, I’m a 35M. Not making a throwaway for this because I don’t care if people figure out who I am.

So, growing up for me wasn’t easy. Parents divorce when I was really young. Shithead of a stepfather for a few years and a mom that wasn’t paying attention to how he treated me then they divorced. Dad disappeared after he dropped me off a few days before I turned 12, later finding out he was raising his past-born son, and still in contact with his daughter and son that he had just found out existed when I was 11. I was the odd man out apparently. That was all rough, giving me abandonment issues and whatnot. 

But what’s been killing me lately is that I didn’t know I was dealing with ADHD for so long and how it affected my life. School was always fine, mostly As and Bs. Could keep friends. Didn’t get in legal trouble, or much of any other kind of trouble. It was very “out of sight, out of mind” for my mom and her parents, who let us live with them while I grew up. But when I got to college, things spiraled quickly and I was suspended for a couple years for grades, had to retake all of my classes. So it took me almost 10 years total to graduate college. And throughout most of this time, I wasn’t working. I was just being a financial drain on my mom, who had been coddling and sheltering me since we left my stepdad. 

So after I graduated, moved back home and got a typical, low-paying, post-grad job. I was supposed to start saving money, but was never able to because I was shit at budgeting, I was never taught how and never needed to know. Then covid hit and I got my current job. My money was up and down a bit, I was actually doing well at one point, able to pay someone back $2-3000 for money they loaned me for a car downpayment. And then the money issues started piling up, to the point that I’ve had debt payments so high for the past 2ish years that its made it unfeasible to get a place of my own. Things are finally easing up a little bit there but i still cant get a place on my own (NoVa) and pay off my debt and live. 35 and still living at my moms house, though she doesn’t live here. Feel like a massive loser. 

So, my mental health has rapidly declined over the past few years and I was having a hard time figuring out why. Well i was diagnosed with BPD, though that probably doesn’t fit me too well, more-so C-PTSD and ADHD with RSD. After doing some reading of other peoples lives, i thought i might have ADHD, and while I don’t have an official diagnosis, i am being treated for it since the doc says i do exhibit a lot of the behaviors. So i got on wellbutrin, 150mg and it helped me focus a bit but I could tell I was still struggling at work. So the doc increased my dosage to 300mg. And holy shit. 

It’s like clarity I’ve never had. Motivation I’ve never had. I actually have a drive to do things to improve my situation…when I’m not horrifically depressed and nihilistic. 

Well, that clarity is also allowing me to reexamine things in my life and there’s one thing I have been thinking about nonstop for the past week or so. 

There was a girl I grew up with from 11 on, we’ll call her Stormy (she reminded me a little of Addison Timlin’s character in Odd Thomas). I was immediately infatuated with her the moment I saw her, she was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. I got the balls to ask her out and she said yes, then broke up with me a day later because I was too shy and didn’t talk to her much. It hurt a little but I was fine. We stayed friends. The next year she invited me to her birthday party. The year after I remember going to see the movie Willard in theaters with her and her best friend. We always talked when we saw each other. We were good friends. 

High school came and it was more of the same until we both started actually dating. I had my first girlfriend for a little over a year, who broke up with me a bunch of times so she could go test the waters with other guys and/or hook up a little. I was young and dumb and took her back each time, not knowing the exacerbation of my abandonment issues she was causing and the trust issues. Well, come junior year of high school, I ask Stormy to prom and she says yes. Oh she also baked me brownies, I don’t remember why. But I was over the moon. I had been smitten with her for years and she actually picked me to go to prom with. I was happier than a pig in shit. We went on a coffee date a few days later and we started dating after that. We didn’t really have any issues when we were dating, we were happy with each other. Prom night came and we ended with a rendezvous in my car. She was perfect- funny, smart, gorgeous, and holy shit was she caring. One morning I was in English class and she popped her head in and said “Is No_Move here?” just to give me a monster drink she bought for me on her way to school. She came with my mom and I to a doctors appointment where she sat in the waiting room with my mom for 4 HOURS just because she cared about me. Needless to say, she’s always been my mom’s favorite. 

Well, unfortunately those abandonment issues reared their ugly head. I was a straight edge kid and I broke up with her because she smoked weed. I didn’t know it at the time but I was breaking up with her because I couldn’t let someone get too close to me in case they would hurt me. I was subconsciously protecting myself, not knowing I was only causing myself more pain. The next day I already regretted it. I remember driving by her and my heart just sinking into my stomach and feeling like I was going to be sick. She got a new boyfriend soon after, which lasted about a year. We didn’t talk that whole time, but after they broke up, we became friends again. So much so, it was like we were back to the way we were after I asked her to prom but before we  started dating. I looked for reasons to be where she would be. I mean, who the fuck eats at Ruby Tuesdays? Well, she worked there so I did. 

We hung out a bit before I went off to college and she told me she had wished she was still with me at one point before we graduated. Sucks but I was at least happy to have her in my life again. We stayed in touch, though we always gave each other space when one of us was in a relationship.

Then one of the hardest things for me was when she moved to Seattle during my first year in college. She was going to be on the opposite side of the country, I was maybe never going to see her again. I got a bit depressed from it but we stayed in touch and I did my best to move on. Until she came back for a couple weeks during my winter break in my 2nd year.

We spent almost every single day with each other and it still wasn’t enough time. We snuck off to smoke cigarettes behind her parents shed and played in the snow. We hung out with her family, who hated me at first (aside from her sister) but now they adored me. We took her mom to a hookah bar. She came with me to pick up my friend flying in for a Cowboys Redskins game, 2 hours there and 4 back. I remember sitting on the couch watching whatever, and her laying with her head on a pillow in my lap and she fell asleep. And looking at her I felt….home. 

So the days went by and eventually we were on her last day before she had to fly back to Seattle. We went to my house and laid on my bed watching Jurassic Park. I don’t remember how it happened, but we kissed. And oh man did I ever miss that. Then she hit me with “I told my sister that if I was still here, I would be dating you,” and that simultaneously filled me with sadness because she was leaving the next day but also joy, she still wanted to be with me. Later that night, we were standing outside in the cold and hugging under my jacket just talking, kissing, and I never wanted to let go. 

Unfortunately, I had to. We hung out until late that night and I went home sad.

After a few more months, she moved to Florida and we still stayed in touch. I picked her up from the airport at one point and we caught up, talked about life but that was about it. It didn’t last long, she was only there for a couple days. 

Then right after I failed all my classes for the second semester in a row, knowing I would be suspended again (appealed the first and won), she invited me down to Florida. And of course I took that opportunity. Only, things were a little weird now. I was in rough mental shape from the previous year. She was in rough mental shape from her two previous years. And it was like we knew that I was there to pick up where we left off, but she also seemed so distant the whole time. The week I was there was the most confusing, mixed-signally thing ever. She would talk about how I could get the job I wanted to go to school for in Florida, but then act like I was being a burden to her. One issue I know she had was I was still dependent on my mom and she was very independent. 

One night later in the week we kissed a little, we almost had sex but I said something that upset her and she rolled over and went to sleep. That definitely sucked. 

We went to a concert my last night there and her friend brought her boyfriend and another guy, and I felt threatened, and looking back, I’m sure I was smothering her because of it. We went to a strip club with Stormy’s friend afterward but I didn’t want to be there, I just wanted to be with her. 

The last day I was there just felt like there was a lot of unresolved things between us, but neither of us wanted to say anything. I did get to meet Hulk Hogan at his restaurant, that was cool. Then she dropped me off at the airport, we hugged, and I walked through the gate and couldn’t even look back at her, it hurt too much. 

That was the last time I saw her. 

We still stayed in touch. Her sister even said to me, “you guys are going to get married,” and I replied, “that’s the dream.”  I was still in love with her, I just didn’t know how to move forward. 

Well, she definitely moved forward. A few months later she met a guy, they dated, then they got married, and they have a couple kids together. Once they got married, I knew I had to move on, getting girlfriends and whatnot, but unfortunately I’ve never been able to. It was 13 years ago when I last saw her and I still love her more than anything. And I know she’s probably out of my life for good. I have so much I want to say to her but can’t because she’s married. To this day, if given another chance to be with her, I would move heaven and earth to make it happen. She was the light of my life for so long and since she’s been gone, I’ve had this dark cloud hanging over me. 

If you’ve made it this far, you might be wondering “what does Wellbutrin have to do with this?”

Since I started taking the 300mg of Wellbutrin, I’ve been thinking of every little thing I fucked up. Every mistake I made. Every little act of kindness I took for granted. Every sign I missed. Looking back, I of course wish I never dumped her in high school. I wish I had gotten on a plane with her to Seattle. I wish I had some balls to talk to her about us when I was in Florida. I wish I had just done something to fight for her. But I was never mentally mature or well enough for that. And I never took initiative during my life, I was always a passive person- just allowing life to go by while I float along with the wind and just do whatever. And it sucks looking back and realizing how if I had gotten the help I needed at a younger age, maybe I’d be with her. I told my family I was depressed, they brushed it off. I was doing certain things that showed I was clearly having mental health issues, but no one thought to get me any sort of help. And I hate it. I’m so angry at all the adults in my life when I was a kid. Their apathy held me back from getting the treatment I needed to be a functional person. 

So now I’ve been depressed as hell just thinking about everything, wishing things had gone differently. I may actually be a successful person with the woman of his dreams.

About 2 or 3 years ago, she messaged me on instagram with our prom photo. She said her mom found it while they were going through some boxes. I didn’t know how to respond, I knew she was married. I wanted to tell her how I miss her, but all I could say was “Good times”. And that was it.

I only just asked her about it a few days ago, why she sent it to me. She said she was just reminiscing and wasn’t sure if I remembered or had the photo still. Didn’t tell her that I kept that photo in my wallet for over a decade. And of course I remember, who forgets their first time? There’s no way she would think I wouldn’t remember, right? Idk, we caught up just a little bit, and I said I didn’t want to overstep  into her marriage by talking to her and said goodbye. I’ve talked to some people about it and it’s just left me more confused. 

Before anyone says it, yes, I’m in therapy. 

I’m not sure how many people I know that are on Reddit, but anyone that knows me will easily be able to figure out who I am. 

And with the extremely low probability Stormy sees this: I’m so happy for you that you have the family you wanted. I know you’re killing it being an amazing mom. I’m so proud of you. And I miss you more than I ever thought possible. 

Thanks for coming to my TEDTalk. 

Tl;dr: Had a rough childhood. Made a lot of mistakes until recently. Now getting treatment which makes me aware of things I wish I had done differently that may have let me be with my perfect woman. ",2,1763922155.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False
