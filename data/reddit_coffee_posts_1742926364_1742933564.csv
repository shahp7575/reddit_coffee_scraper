1jjsz52,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jjsz52/aitah_for_starting_to_dislike_my_friend_for_the/,AITAH for starting to dislike my friend for the way she acts?,"So, to start, my friend (lets call her M) and i are both in the last year of high school. And since we became friends the only things we've been talking about is her issues. That is a problem to me because she refuses to take advice or do smt about the situations.

My first problem, she makes up problems in her head at every minor change of tone when a person speaks to her.  I do get people that overthink, as i also do, but the fact that she gets mad at literally the most absurd things, she doesn't ever wanna talk it out, take advice or think rationally about ANYTHING. She literally takes it to such a stupidly absurd level and it's just draining when she's in my ear crying all day about petty shit, friends to listen to problems but i wanna rip my eardrums out when she starts her dramatics.

For example one person she's currently mad at is my best friend, S, we used to be some kind of group with another girl but it fell apart when the 4th girl spread something that M told her and then M got shit for it and it was kind of her fault. The 4th girl already did smt like that once and i can't feel bad for M in the situation tbh. Now every time she sees that girl it makes her blood boil and she thinks the girl is the spawn of Satan istg (that girl def isn't in the right but no reason to hate her guts).

Every time i interact with S, M brings up that i hate her because i did something with S. She once saw me and S when we were going out for coffee and she holds it against me but am i not supposed to have other friends??? We don't have to always be together and she doesn't even consider her behaviour could be the cause for our distancing.

And she also always complains about not having friends and literally guilt trips me by saying I'm the only real person on Earth.. like it's so annoying because she's blatantly lying. She has other friends and she's always stopping to chat with someone on the hallways and its not my fault if they aren't up to her standards like.. get other friends, she just doesn't want to i guess, which also isn't my fault and idc.

  
The second thing is her very childish boyfriend, he's the type of guy that the phrase ""boys will be boys"" applies to. He hits girls as a joke and is generally the most annoying being on Earth. Takes jokes too far ALWAYS and literally made M throw up once (she has emetophobia and he kept making gagging noises till she threw up) DESPITE all of this she puts him on a pedestal likes he's some kind of god and can do no wrong. Whatever he says goes and is always true.

  
The last thing is her stupid fucking behaviour about grades, she asks if i studied ten times and each time i say no, because i didn't study, but then i get an okay grade and all of a sudden I'm a lying bitch. Then she starts about how stupid she is and that she'll never accomplish anything and how is everyone so naturally smart but her, blablabla WELL MAYBE its because I listen and REMEMBER THINGS like its not my fault she's on her phone all day at school and doesn't study at home.

  
so AITA? What should I do about the situation? I'm afraid to confront her because I don't want her to start considering me public enemy number 1.",1,1742933410.0,AITAH,0,0.99,False

I'm down 9lbs so far. I'm largely eating a banana and an apple during the day and a normal meal but smaller portion for dinner. I have a very inactive job - sat at a desk or in a meeting room most of the day, and my job is far from 9-5 so I'm often working in the evening. With a family as well, there is little opportunity for exercise, hence why I'm focusing on diet. At the start, it seemed as though I was loosing a lot of water. I was peeing quite a lot, but that settled down after a few days. I have tea and coffee as well as water through the day. Should I be adding something like a protein shake for lunch?

1jjsxtj,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jjsxtj/my_thoughts_after_two_weeks_in_colombia/,My thoughts after two weeks in Colombia,"I just spent about 16 days in Colombia with my partner and wanted to get my thoughts out about the trip. I hate saying it, but I don’t think I enjoyed the trip as much as I expected. I still had lots of fun, but found the trip to be a bit exhausting at times. I’d describe it overall as dynamic, with lots of ups and downs. I'm wondering if other people can relate, give advice, or have recs for some other places I should try traveling to! Sorry this ended up so long. 

TL;DR - Colombia was a pretty intense trip. I loved the local people and some travelers, the food, and the nature, but found it to be somewhat overwhelming. It wasn't too expensive, but I found myself regretting various bookings or purchases throughout the trip. Wondering if I am not outgoing enough for the country, but overall still had a great time. 

Anyways, here are the positives to start:

**POSITIVES**

NATURE

Eje Cafetero is probably the most beautiful place I’ve seen in my life. Combined with the wildlife in Tayrona and Playa Brava (I highly recommend Playa Brava over San Juan) the outdoors here were just astounding. As a wonderful man in Munich once said to me, “My heart goes out to \[insert place\].” For me that place was Salento. Even if it didn’t have the amazing Valle de Cocora, the rolling hills and tall grass here are things to marvel at and enjoy the serenity in. Extremely happy we spent a decent chunk of time here. Plus, there were tons of beautiful birds to watch. 

PEOPLE

Both Colombian people and many of the travelers we met were some of the nicest people I’ve met on a trip. It was easier for me to approach people and start conversations than probably any other place for me except maybe the Camino de Santiago. When I spoke with our hostel hosts in Spanish, they were always patient, kind, and very willing to help me practice. This part of Colombian culture truly stands out. People almost always meet you with a smile and you feel the warmth of the people around you. 

FOOD

Many people seem to complain about the food, but I actually liked quite a few of the meals we had. It took some time to find the rights spots here and there, but when we did, the freshness and simplicity was great. Lean into eating sopa, lots of juice, and chicharron. The menu del dia was our friend and we could often split one. Plus, the coffee was fantastic, cheap, and didn’t give me jitters. I don’t know how that’s possible, but it’s what happened (could be a lot of Robusta coffee at the shops back home?). 

HOSTELS (some of them)

Yambolombia in Salento may be my favorite hostel ever. It’s 30 minutes out of town walking, but the atmosphere and tranquility were unmatched. Plus it is cheap, the people are incredibly kind, and you can walk to the coffee fincas very easily from there. The Valle Tayrona hostel was probably the coolest hostel I’ve seen. You’re kinda in a jungle and everything is made of bamboo and it’s eco friendly. 

MEDELLIN

Medellin again felt somewhat chaotic for me, but I found it to be very cool. An amazing mix of history, cool neighborhoods, and loving people. We stayed near Laureles and I think that was my favorite area to wander. I recommend seeing Comuna 13, doing a walking tour of the Centro, checking out some museums, and just meandering. The Centro felt a bit sketchy at times, but nothing too crazy. Just watch yourself, don't stand in sketchy areas too long, and listen to the locals if they tell you not to hang out somewhere. 

**NEGATIVES**

I want to preface this by saying that none of this is a reflection on the country of Colombia or its people, but rather a reflection of my experience and possibly some ill-founded expectations. There’s also a factor of comparison involved. A year ago my partner and I went to Japan where we found nearly everything to be extremely convenient and orderly, which made our trip relaxing but also exciting as we got to focus more on fun rather than figuring things out. I speak some Spanish which helped a ton, but I definitely felt out of control for decent chunks of this trip. 

WEALTH DISPARITY

This is just something that felt a little strange, especially in Cartagena and Medellín. It’s also my first time in a country with this much poverty, so that has an impact. Flying into Cartagena, the first thing we saw was comunas that looked very poor. I felt a bit odd in this very touristy area while knowing this isn’t the reality for most people living there. In Medellín, people talked about taking cable cars over poor neighborhoods. This could be powerful for understanding, but also could easily go in a very bad direction. These issues aren’t unique to Colombia, but it was new for me. I did appreciate that it seemed like the government of Medellín was trying to improve many things. I don’t live there so I can’t comment, but that was the revitalization energy expressed in many tours. 

CARTAGENA

Cartagena is a beautiful city (at least the small part that I saw), but it was sadly one of my least favorites cities I’ve visited. It’s extremely touristy, relatively expensive, and very hot. The streets in the walled city are so beautiful, I just wish they would shut some of them down to most traffic. The sidewalks are too small to walk next to someone and it can feel like you have to dodge stuff frequently. There are also constantly people asking you to buy things. I underestimated how much energy this would take out of me. With all that said, Cartagena at 6am when it’s quiet is a beautiful place. Plus, I highly recommend doing a snorkeling tour with the company Diving Planet if you’re willing to pay a bit more than the other Rosario tours. Easily a highlight of the trip for us and we didn’t want a party boat at 9am (or at all really). One last thing, we did a tour that included going to Alquimico and found it to be very overrated. Getsemaní was much cooler IMO. 

PRICES

Colombia is by no means expensive, but I found that the prices of things ranged dramatically and were generally higher than I anticipated. Sometimes you’d have nearly 10x buying power from the US. Other times things would cost the same. Anything with liquor was usually pretty rough. I also found it a bit harder to find quality budget options than in some other countries.

I didn’t fully realize this beforehand, but the frequent need for guides was a major expense. Even free tours asked to tip about the same I was asked in Europe, which I did. It felt like in order to do many of the fun things, you had to be willing to put down more cash than I expected. We wanted to see Barbas Bremen near Filandia but skipped it altogether because you had to have a guide and it was like $40 USD minimum per person from what I saw in about 30 minutes of searching. I get why they do it, but it was frustrating all the same.

Colombia was still quite cheap overall, just more expensive than I thought. These things combined to follow what some of our travel buddies often said: “the money flows like water here.”

NOISE

People often said to us that Colombians like things very loud. Idk if that’s universally the case, but it was definitely the experience we had a lot of the time. I don’t necessarily love the near absolute silence of Japan’s transit system, but I didn’t always appreciate people playing music or videos aloud in tight spaces or in transit. Music in restaurants and bars often made it hard to talk with people, I lost my voice a lot, and my partner couldn’t handle the volume period in certain places. This just wore us down over time. 

SCAMS AND VALUE

In Cartagena especially, we felt like we were getting *sort of* scammed a lot. Not like “oh we paid for a futbol game but they sold our ticket to someone else,” but more like we’d be rushed into a taxi, our shuttle to Santa Marta dropped us at a random spot filled with local taxis, the guide we bought was definitely not worth the price, etc. Much of this could have been remedied with more research, but I found many online guides for Colombia to be either outdated or inaccurate. Get Your Guide seems very hit or miss (even with very good ratings) and generally too expensive, but it was definitely harder for me to figure things out on my own here than other countries. Much of the time when we asked our hostel for help, they would direct us to tours that were just as, if not more expensive than Get Your Guide. If you want a solid online guide, I highly recommend checking out Tom Plan My Trip. It had some of the best info for us the entire journey. 

TOURISTS VS TRAVELERS 

There were a number of people we spent multiple days with and had a good time. Outside of these amazing groups, the tourist scene seemed very party focused. In Cartagena basically every customs booth has signs about illegal sex trafficking and sex tourism. Many people also just want to travel and get drunk, which is fine, but that wasn’t really our vibe. This may have been a big factor in why we didn’t super enjoy Cartagena. We met some great people, but the Viajero hostel was definitely a big party hostel. Being a party hostel is fine, but Hostelworld rankings in Colombia seem a bit skewed towards that style, so atmosphere ratings may need deeper consideration for some travelers. We had better luck later in the trip picking less popular, cheaper hostels (I was sort of kicking myself for not remembering this earlier). 

An annoying side note - Viajero Cartagena was charging 60,000 COP for a pub crawl that very well could have been free if they just allowed people to go and buy drinks on their own. I heard the first stop on the crawl was another Viajero which just feels like another *sort of* scam like I mentioned above. I recommend going to Palenque in Getsemaní for free instead. 

If people wanted to party, I’d hoped there’d be more people who wanted to grab a six pack and go sit on the wall of the walled city or find a place in a park. Then go to a club or bar after. Many people seemed perfectly happy to empty their wallets with watered-down $10 cocktails and overpriced pub crawls. Maybe I just picked the wrong hostel :(

**CONCLUSION**

Colombia felt a bit challenging as a couple who has some introverted tendencies. I try to push my comfort zone while traveling and I think I did okay, but the party scene is everywhere. I still feel incredibly lucky to have met the people we did. 

At the end of the day, I will remember the people and the nature. I would come back to Colombia, but maybe visit some smaller towns in the pacific or Santander, or maybe try Bogotá. I can’t tell if Colombian city culture was just too much for me. I tend to take things too seriously so it’s a good challenge for me to step back like this, but I’ve heard so many people rave about the country, I began to wonder if I wasn’t outgoing enough for it. It’s hard to tell if it’s something wrong with me or if it just wasn’t the right energy for my personality. I don’t know if there’s much I can do about that except continue trying to be open to new experiences. 

Anyways, thank you Colombia for the wonderful experience. I'd probably give the trip a 7.5/10.",1,1742933319.0,travel,1,1.0,False

1jjsvc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/prediabetes/comments/1jjsvc3/feeling_defeated_and_overwhelmed/,Feeling defeated and overwhelmed,"I struggled with insulin resistance prior to pregnancy (and possible PCOS). I had gestational diabetes in my 2nd pregnancy and around 8 weeks postpartum had to take steroids and my baby was hospitalized for 12 days, so life was chaos and I wasn't eating or sleeping well.

At 6 weeks postpartum my a1c was 5.4 and average glucose was under 100. At 12 weeks a1c was 5.7 and average glucose was 117. 

I thought I'd get back to my normal routine of things and start doing better but I've been tracking my blood sugar the past 3 days and I'm really freaked out. My morning fasting number is always around 100, I took it at 5am two nights in a row (after feeding baby) just see and it was 98 and 99. Then it would usually spike an hour after eating but not always come down after 2 hours (was mostly around 110 two hours after eating)... but then one time it went down to 88 and I was just standing around  ?!? 

I'm kind of obsessing/worrying and feel like I'm going to die young. I changed my eating habits big time several years ago (cut soda, stopped eating fast food, incorporated more Whole Foods) but definitely still enjoyed food. Now I feel like I'm going to need to be on a super restrictive diet and not be able to enjoy my life. I love baking with my kids (bread and snacks) and trying pastries at coffee shops, etc. but also I literally crave a chocolate chip cookie every single night... it's literally from childhood and I don't know how to stop! Even on days when I eat well.

Things I've been doing and am trying to be consistent: inositol (I've wondered if I could increase), eating protein before carbs, walking regularly, digestive enzymes before meals. 

Would love thoughts on...

How to enjoy food with others?

Does using things like erythritol (read mixed reviews) outweigh risks of spikes due to sugar?

Are spikes or prolonged raised glucose worse for you?

Hello everyone! My partner and I (lesbians; both 23 year old college grads) still live in our college town of East Lansing and are thinking about finding new places to reside in the near future. For context, we're originally from Metro Detroit and we like it a lot but we want a change of pace, at least for a few years. 

I lurk here a lot and am curious if you all know any cities that fit these ""requirements""  (I'm flexible with most of them). 

Our requirements:

**At least kind of affordable**. She will have a considerable amount of student loan debt, so rent shouldn't take all her paycheck. However, I won't have any debt, so I'm free to spend a tad more on living. The place doesn't have to be dirt cheap, but we don't want to spend NYC prices. 

**Diverse music scene.** My core hobbies/side hustles are music and event planning. I'm a rapper, but I'm more on the alternative side, so I'd like to be around a lot of genres. I love local hip-hop, but I enjoy punk, R&B, EDM, and other genres, too - I'd like to have access to those circles, especially because I plan all sorts of music events currently and would like to continue this in my next location. Ideally, I'd like a city with an easily accessible local music scene with an LGBT and DIY twist to it.

**Close to well-preserved nature.** My partner works in conservation and is obsessed with native ecology, so we'd love a place where there's a a bit of a culture of environmentalism and proximity to ACTUAL nature with well-preserved and conserved spaces that include native plants (not just suburbs with weirdly placed trees). Her conservation job would likely mean that she needs to be close to nature anyways. She's flexible to work in other fields, but her degree is in Plant Biology, so it will have to be something plant related. 

**Culture and history.** We love going to authentic foreign restaurants and visiting queer bars and coffee shops. Definitely don't want to let this go.

**Decent nightlife and community of folks.** There isn't any club like a gay club, tbh! Spaces that I can perform and plan events is essential. I'd prefer having access to touring artists as well, but it's not a requirement. I'm already used to everyone skipping Detroit lol. Friendly people are a must - we're used to the Midwest charm. 

**Safety.** This one's obvious, but in particular, safety for a queer female couple is essential. I drive a Kia, too, so a place with regular car break-ins is a no-go. Even after the anti-theft updates, I've heard anecdotally that Kias are still targets for break-ins more often. I just don't wanna risk it.

**Decent weather.** My partner has Reynaud's (a circulation-related disease) so some place that has better winters than Michigan or Chicago would be nice! Lots of sun is needed as well, as it helps with seasonal depression. I personally like some seasonal variation. I hate humidity but I can learn to deal lol. 


**Nice to have - smaller streets that aren't entirely car dependent.** I honestly love the look of Northeastern and Midwestern cities that are less sprawl-y and more old-school, with a good amount of mid and low rise buildings. Think Brooklyn, Chicago, etc. I'd love decent public transportation and walkability (doesn't have to be perfect, as I'll have a car). I just want to be able to take the bus to the club. This isn't a requirement tbh, but a nice-to-have. I really hate excessive car noises and 4-lane stroads lol.

Do your homework, but it's been hit hard since all time highs last year around $95 and is now in the $30s as it's rebounding from the market wide selloff recently.

1jjstgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1jjstgp/canonical_v_stormagic/,Canonical v Stormagic,"OK, full disclosure: I do have skin in the game, cause I just straight-up F hate the Stormagic guys! I guess IOU the backstory here.

So, let’s rewind about a year and a half, I walk into this absolute horror shit show of an IT setup that I inherited out of pure bad luck or some cosmic joke. We’re talking a sad collection of aging HPE servers, no-name bargain-bin network switches, a crusty and neglected VMware vSphere install, and, saving the worst for last, a complete steaming pile of crap known as Stormagic SvSAN. The previous admin, who clearly had no clue what the hell he was doing, was already out the door, and the whole thing had been cobbled together based on whatever the local MSP was whispering in his ear, which, as it turned out, was basically useless white noise, because both of them were clearly out of their F mind and had absolutely no idea what they were building or maintaining. Anyway, the hardware was long past its prime, dinosaurs, really and extending the warranty past five years was priced so stupidly high that it almost felt like HPE was daring us to throw it all in the trash. So finally, after enough headaches and a bit of executive pushing, we got the green light for a full-blown hardware refresh. Now, you’d think that’s where the nightmare ends, right? Hell no! Because even though we were shelling a truckload of dough on the new servers and switches, big brass, in their infinite wisdom, decided they didn’t want to spend an extra dime beyond the hardware. So, the directive was: Keep all the F software AS IS, just update it where necessary, and everything should magically work on the new boxes. Classic! The new servers were on VMware’s HCL, so no red flags there, I fought like hell and won the uphill battle to replace the network garbage with Arista, and, keep your opinions on that to yourself. Stormagic got all the updated specs, and they looked it over and came back with a confident thumbs-up, saying we were totally good to go. Yeah, well… Wrong! Dead wrong. We got the shiny new gear in, cracked open a few six-packs of Bud Light on a Saturday, and started racking things up and that’s when shit went full pear-shaped and hit the fan at the same time. Turns out, Stormagic SvSAN had a complete meltdown trying to deal with the new 4K native drives. We were completely stuck and tried to get ahold of Stormagic support, but, surprise, surprise, it was the weekend, and nobody was answering. When we finally reached them on Monday, they initially gave us the “it’s a configuration issue” line, but despite all their back and forth, they couldn’t fix a thing. We were left with no way to move forward, we couldn’t migrate any workloads, couldn’t bring up the new cluster, because there was zero shared storage. All thanks to our Stormagic heroes. Weeks later, after our leadership finally leaned on theirs, Stormagic admitted, oh yeah, turns out they actually do have problems with 4K drives, and they’re “working on it.” That fix never saw the light of day... Nothing ever changed. We sat there twisting in the wind. Fast-forward six months. I was beyond done, like burned-with-a-blowtorch done, and finally pushed hard for a switch to VMware vSAN instead, as this was before the Broadcom deal when vSAN still made solid sense. We rebuilt the cluster from the ground up with vSAN, had to mess with some config tweaks and slap those extra SSDs and re-flash RAID cards into HBA mode, but anyway… Everything just worked. Shocker, right? I left the company a few months later, but I still bump into the guy who took over my role from time to time, and last I checked, everything’s been running smooth as hell ever since.

But here’s where it gets extra spicy. Ever since that fiasco, I’ve been keeping an eye on some of the Stormagic crew on LinkedIn, mostly for the cringe factor, and every now and then I catch them trying to hype their stuff like they’re some kinda VMware killer, pushing out fluffy promos, bragging about their “innovative” tech, and basically pretending like they aren’t the same folks that faceplanted on our project. And then just a few days ago, I see a post from their head product dude that made me spill my morning coffee all over the keyboard:

“Can anyone out there refer me to an IP attorney that specializes in open source licensing and has at least some experience working with Canonical. Thanks!”

Here’s the actual post:

Yeah, I took a screenshot too in case they have the good sense to take it down:

[https://imgur.com/a/hCaQ4re](https://imgur.com/a/hCaQ4re)

Apparently these brilliant minds managed to get into some major legal beef with Canonical, you know, the folks behind Ubuntu, probably because they stuffed a bunch of Canonical’s IP into their VSA or HCI stack without understanding (or caring) how open source licensing actually works.

So, let’s rewind about a year and a half, I walk into this absolute horror shit show of an IT setup that I inherited out of pure bad luck or some cosmic joke. We’re talking a sad collection of aging HPE servers, no-name bargain-bin network switches, a crusty and neglected VMware vSphere install, and, saving the worst for last, a complete steaming pile of crap known as Stormagic SvSAN. The previous admin, who clearly had no clue what the hell he was doing, was already out the door, and the whole thing had been cobbled together based on whatever the local MSP was whispering in his ear, which, as it turned out, was basically useless white noise, because both of them were clearly out of their F mind and had absolutely no idea what they were building or maintaining. Anyway, the hardware was long past its prime, dinosaurs, really and extending the warranty past five years was priced so stupidly high that it almost felt like HPE was daring us to throw it all in the trash. So finally, after enough headaches and a bit of executive pushing, we got the green light for a full-blown hardware refresh. Now, you’d think that’s where the nightmare ends, right? Hell no! Because even though we were shelling a truckload of dough on the new servers and switches, big brass, in their infinite wisdom, decided they didn’t want to spend an extra dime beyond the hardware. So, the directive was: Keep all the F software AS IS, just update it where necessary, and everything should magically work on the new boxes. Classic! The new servers were on VMware’s HCL, so no red flags there, I fought like hell and won the uphill battle to replace the network garbage with Arista, and, keep your opinions on that to yourself. Stormagic got all the updated specs, and they looked it over and came back with a confident thumbs-up, saying we were totally good to go. Yeah, well… Wrong! Dead wrong. We got the shiny new gear in, cracked open a few six-packs of Bud Light on a Saturday, and started racking things up and that’s when shit went full pear-shaped and hit the fan at the same time. Turns out, Stormagic SvSAN had a complete meltdown trying to deal with the new 4K native drives. We were completely stuck and tried to get ahold of Stormagic support, but, surprise, surprise, it was the weekend, and nobody was answering. When we finally reached them on Monday, they initially gave us the “it’s a configuration issue” line, but despite all their back and forth, they couldn’t fix a thing. We were left with no way to move forward, we couldn’t migrate any workloads, couldn’t bring up the new cluster, because there was zero shared storage. All thanks to our Stormagic heroes. Weeks later, after our leadership finally leaned on theirs, Stormagic admitted, oh yeah, turns out they actually do have problems with 4K drives, and they’re “working on it.” That fix never saw the light of day... Nothing ever changed. We sat there twisting in the wind. Fast-forward six months. I was beyond done, like burned-with-a-blowtorch done, and finally pushed hard for a switch to VMware vSAN instead, as this was before the Broadcom deal when vSAN still made solid sense. We rebuilt the cluster from the ground up with vSAN, had to mess with some config tweaks and slap those extra SSDs and re-flash RAID cards into HBA mode, but anyway… Everything just worked. Shocker, right? I left the company a few months later, but I still bump into the guy who took over my role from time to time, and last I checked, everything’s been running smooth as hell ever since.

But here’s where it gets extra spicy. Ever since that fiasco, I’ve been keeping an eye on some of the Stormagic crew on LinkedIn, mostly for the cringe factor, and every now and then I catch them trying to hype their stuff like they’re some kinda VMware killer, pushing out fluffy promos, bragging about their “innovative” tech, and basically pretending like they aren’t the same folks that faceplanted on our project.

— we stayed at the Mezzanine for 4 nights absolutely beautiful hotel! It was quiet since it only has 9 rooms. It is located in the jaguar park. 
— I saw mixed advice on this so wanted to clear up, we had to pay the entree fee into the park only once. But you have to show your reservation each day in order not to pay going forward. 
— we had a rental car. However once you are in the Jaguar Park I didn’t find it necessary to have a car because they have a tram type thing that goes up and down. However if you wanted to go to the hotel zone you would need a car. 
— the hotel is small so the pool was small with no pool chairs and there is direct beach access but also no beach chairs 
— they have a few sister properties in Tulum with one being next door which is Mi Amor and you are allowed to use their pool. 
— you aren’t allowed to put toilet paper in the toilet anywhere in Tulum 
— it was really a great stay! It is really quiet though so if you are wanting to stay at a place where you can socialize this isn’t your place 

The restaurant at the hotel was delicious and I would highly recommend. We are Hilton Diamond members so when we checked in they told us breakfast was included. So day 3 comes around and we went to check on the bill at the front desk and asked her why we were charged for breakfast and she only break and coffee was included in the “free” breakfast. I would have still ordered breakfast but would have been nice to know she meant bread only.  

Restaurants we ate at: 
-Mezzanine (twice for dinner) 
-Casa Maria (this was one hotel over and it was delicious) 
-Mi Amor 
-La Zebra 
-Checkpoint Ciao (this was in the hotel zone and absolutely delicious pizza) 
- we originally went to Bak but didn’t have a good experience so after we got our drinks we ended up getting our check and going to checkpoint instead. 

Overall we had a great trip! We probably won’t go back but that’s because it was kind of pricey and didn’t feel worth it. If anything I would go back on a girls trip. But I felt safe everywhere and it was a great relaxing trip! ",1,1742932967.0,tulum,1,1.0,False

\
Craigslist is a favored online marketplace where you can vend anything from furnishings and gadgets to automobiles and garments. It's a fantastic platform for promptly selling merchandise, particularly if you reside in a bustling city like Little Rock, Arkansas. Yet, with so many potential purchasers and merchants, it can be daunting to make an impact and sell your merchandise swiftly. In this article, we'll furnish you with some pointers for swiftly selling merchandise on Craigslist in Little Rock.\
\
1. Capture high-quality images: When it comes to peddling merchandise on Craigslist, an image is worth a thousand words. If you want to entice potential purchasers, you need to capture high-quality images of the merchandise you're selling. Ensure the illumination is good, and the merchandise is spotless and well-organized. Capture images from numerous perspectives to give potential purchasers a lucid notion of what they're getting. Remember, the finer your images, the more likely you are to appeal to potential purchasers.\
\
2. Craft a captivating depiction: In addition to high-quality images, a captivating depiction is crucial for swiftly selling merchandise on Craigslist. Be sure to encompass essential particulars about the merchandise, such as its state, dimensions, hue, and any defects or imperfections. You should also mention any distinctive features or selling points. It's vital to be forthright and transparent in your depiction to dodge any potential misunderstandings with purchasers.\
\
3. Establish a fair price: Pricing your merchandise competitively is pivotal for promptly selling them on Craigslist. Survey similar merchandise being vended in Little Rock to obtain an idea of the market value. You don't want to set your merchandise at too high a price, as this may deter potential purchasers. On the other hand, pricing them too low may prompt suspicion about the quality of the merchandise. Be certain to establish a fair price that reflects the state and value of the merchandise.\
\
4. Be prompt in your responses: Potential purchasers are likely to make inquiries about the merchandise you're vending. It's crucial to be prompt and timely in your communication. If a potential purchaser has a query, be certain to respond promptly and furnish them with the information they require. Being prompt in responses can aid in establishing trust and confidence with potential purchasers, thereby upping the likelihood of a prompt sale.\
\
5. Employ keywords: When posting your merchandise on Craigslist, make certain to utilize keywords in your title and depiction. This will assist potential purchasers in finding your listing when they rummage for specific items. For instance, if you're vending a sofa, make certain to include keywords such as ""comfortable,"" ""like new,"" or ""affordable"" in your depiction. This will augment the visibility of your listing to potential purchasers and bolster the chances of promptly selling your merchandise.\
\
6. Regularly re-post: Craigslist can be a cutthroat marketplace, with new listings being appended frequently. To bolster the visibility of your listings and swiftly sell merchandise, it's advisable to re-post them regularly. This will propel your listings to the top of the search results, rendering them more visible to potential purchasers. Be sure to re-post your merchandise every few days to optimize their visibility.\
\
7. Propose delivery: In some instances, proposing delivery for your merchandise can expedite their sale on Craigslist. Not everyone has access to a vehicle to fetch larger items, so proposing delivery can make your listing more appealing to potential purchasers. However, be sure to levy a fair fee for delivery to ensure it's worth your time and effort.\
\
8. Prioritize safety: When vending merchandise on Craigslist, it's paramount to prioritize your safety and security. Always meet potential purchasers in a public place, such as a coffee shop or shopping mall. Refrain from inviting strangers to your home or sharing personal information, such as your address or phone number, until you feel at ease and assured in the potential purchaser.\
\
9. Exploit social media: In complement to listing your merchandise on Craigslist, it can be advantageous to publicize them on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. This will bolster the visibility of your listings and reach a larger audience of potential purchasers in Little Rock, Arkansas.\
\
10. Extend discounts: Extending a discount or promotion on your merchandise can hasten their sale on Craigslist. For instance, you could offer a 10% discount for merchandise sold within a certain timeframe or bundle multiple items together for a reduced price. Purchasers are often enticed by deals and promotions, so extending discounts can aid in appealing to potential purchasers and swiftly selling your merchandise.\
\
In conclusion, swiftly selling merchandise on Craigslist in Little Rock, Arkansas necessitates a blend of high-quality images, compelling depictions, fair pricing, and prompt communication. By employing these pointers and strategies, you can amplify the visibility of your listings, entice potential purchasers, and promptly and efficiently sell your merchandise. Remember to prioritize safety and security when interacting with potential purchasers and exploit social media to publicize your listings. With these pointers in mind, you'll be well on your way to swiftly selling merchandise on Craigslist in Little Rock, Arkansas.\

Being pregnant is something we manifested for a year and it happened at a very dramatic stage of life. Earlier when we tried, never did it happen despite having good eggs. But in Jan, I lost my father and in extreme grief. End of Jan, we checked the eggs and acc to doc, they were really good. So we just had relation once and boom..14 days after I see two magical pink lines.

I believe it's my dad's love and wishes he wanted to bless us this way.

Tbh I don't have many symptoms except for dizziness and stomach cramps. My scans are good, fetal heart is good and everything is going well. My partner and all family members are happy and supportive too.

However I'm feeling otherwise for the past few days. I feel did I jump into pregnancy too soon or unprepared?! I can't eat as I like (there are specific foods I need to avoid which happen to be my fav). I don't have the energy to travel or even go out for a coffee or dinner. I feel like sleeping in mostly. My appetite decreased. Most of all, my spouse and I are snuggly babies for the longest of time. Now when he snuggles, I move away because body feels so sensitive and I feel like just lying freely without any touch. Though my spouse is very understanding, I miss the touch with him. I push him away ruthlessly and now he just hold my finger or palm just to feel touch.
I'm hating this gap I'm feeling with my spouse. I don't even feel like having sex rn and we haven't done it ever since we conceived. My spouse says we can wait till I feel better...but i honestly don't know if I'm enjoying being pregnant.

1jjsmvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1jjsmvo/canonical_v_stormagic/,Canonical v Stormagic,"OK, full disclosure: I do have skin in the game, cause I just straight-up F hate the Stormagic guys! I guess IOU the backstory here.

So, let’s rewind about a year and a half, I walk into this absolute horror shit show of an IT setup that I inherited out of pure bad luck or some cosmic joke. We’re talking a sad collection of aging HPE servers, no-name bargain-bin network switches, a crusty and neglected VMware vSphere install, and, saving the worst for last, a complete steaming pile of crap known as Stormagic SvSAN. The previous admin, who clearly had no clue what the hell he was doing, was already out the door, and the whole thing had been cobbled together based on whatever the local MSP was whispering in his ear, which, as it turned out, was basically useless white noise, because both of them were clearly out of their F mind and had absolutely no idea what they were building or maintaining. Anyway, the hardware was long past its prime, dinosaurs, really and extending the warranty past five years was priced so stupidly high that it almost felt like HPE was daring us to throw it all in the trash. So finally, after enough headaches and a bit of executive pushing, we got the green light for a full-blown hardware refresh. Now, you’d think that’s where the nightmare ends, right? Hell no! Because even though we were shelling a truckload of dough on the new servers and switches, big brass, in their infinite wisdom, decided they didn’t want to spend an extra dime beyond the hardware. So, the directive was: Keep all the F software AS IS, just update it where necessary, and everything should magically work on the new boxes. Classic! The new servers were on VMware’s HCL, so no red flags there, I fought like hell and won the uphill battle to replace the network garbage with Arista, and, keep your opinions on that to yourself. Stormagic got all the updated specs, and they looked it over and came back with a confident thumbs-up, saying we were totally good to go. Yeah, well… Wrong! Dead wrong. We got the shiny new gear in, cracked open a few six-packs of Bud Light on a Saturday, and started racking things up and that’s when shit went full pear-shaped and hit the fan at the same time. Turns out, Stormagic SvSAN had a complete meltdown trying to deal with the new 4K native drives. We were completely stuck and tried to get ahold of Stormagic support, but, surprise, surprise, it was the weekend, and nobody was answering. When we finally reached them on Monday, they initially gave us the “it’s a configuration issue” line, but despite all their back and forth, they couldn’t fix a thing. We were left with no way to move forward, we couldn’t migrate any workloads, couldn’t bring up the new cluster, because there was zero shared storage. All thanks to our Stormagic heroes. Weeks later, after our leadership finally leaned on theirs, Stormagic admitted, oh yeah, turns out they actually do have problems with 4K drives, and they’re “working on it.” That fix never saw the light of day... Nothing ever changed. We sat there twisting in the wind. Fast-forward six months. I was beyond done, like burned-with-a-blowtorch done, and finally pushed hard for a switch to VMware vSAN instead, as this was before the Broadcom deal when vSAN still made solid sense. We rebuilt the cluster from the ground up with vSAN, had to mess with some config tweaks and slap those extra SSDs and re-flash RAID cards into HBA mode, but anyway… Everything just worked. Shocker, right? I left the company a few months later, but I still bump into the guy who took over my role from time to time, and last I checked, everything’s been running smooth as hell ever since.

But here’s where it gets extra spicy. Ever since that fiasco, I’ve been keeping an eye on some of the Stormagic crew on LinkedIn, mostly for the cringe factor, and every now and then I catch them trying to hype their stuff like they’re some kinda VMware killer, pushing out fluffy promos, bragging about their “innovative” tech, and basically pretending like they aren’t the same folks that faceplanted on our project. And then just a few days ago, I see a post from their head product dude that made me spill my morning coffee all over the keyboard:

“Can anyone out there refer me to an IP attorney that specializes in open source licensing and has at least some experience working with Canonical. Thanks!”

Here’s the actual post:

[https://www.linkedin.com/posts/brucekornfeld\_can-anyone-out-there-refer-me-to-an-ip-attorney-activity-7307572256363163648-m\_xc/](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/brucekornfeld_can-anyone-out-there-refer-me-to-an-ip-attorney-activity-7307572256363163648-m_xc/)

Yeah, I took a screenshot too in case they have the good sense to take it down:

[https://imgur.com/a/hCaQ4re](https://imgur.com/a/hCaQ4re)

Apparently these brilliant minds managed to get into some major legal beef with Canonical, you know, the folks behind Ubuntu, probably because they stuffed a bunch of Canonical’s IP into their VSA or HCI stack without understanding (or caring) how open source licensing actually works. But instead of quietly handling their mess behind closed doors like any sane company would, their C-level exec decides to drag the whole thing out into the open, blasting it across LinkedIn like a teenager! Question… How F stupid does anybody have to be to air his dirty laundry like that in front of customers, partners, and potential investors?!

So, before you put any faith or worse, your infrastructure into anything Stormagic touches, maybe stop and ask yourself how long these “brilliant” people are actually going to be around as a company?

TL;DR: Some sketchy UK-based company called Stormagic is currently tangled in a legal mess with Canonical, the powerhouse behind Ubuntu, over open source licensing, and instead of dealing with it like grown-ass professionals, they’re out here posting desperate lawyer requests on LinkedIn for the world to see.",1,1742932592.0,sysadmin,0,1.0,False

I’ve been delving into proper hydration lately and have been implementing electrolytes (NoordCode, similar to LMNT) during training.

Has anyone tried Dr Berg’s electrolyte mix or sports hydration mix? 

I’ve been reading that as a coffee drinker a lot electrolytes are depleted and taking a basic non-sports (lower in sodium) electrolyte powder in the morning daily is good. I was just curious if this would be overkill to also take the added electrolytes during training?

Have also heard Magnesium and in particular Magnesium Glycinate powder before bed aids recovery and reduces stiffness.

Also wanted to know about glucosamine? Is it beneficial? I’ve seen a lot of people recommend it on here.

We currently assess the possibility of moving to Surrey for work. Husband’s work would be around Guildford whereas I will need to find a new job. So, would like to clarify few questions:

1. I work in IT Consulting - working as Consultant and Business Analyst in digital transformation projects for 10 years.  Would it be possible to find something suitable around this area as non-UK/EU foreigner? Does most people commute to London for work or there are industrial/business hubs nearby? I understand market/pay is not great all around the world, so I am little concerned how long it will take me to land a role.

2. Any recommendations on areas to live as a family of 3? We have a 2 year old - ideally a place nearby a good childcare, primary school and low crime environment.  It does not have to be a very happening place, but we also consider accesibility - if need to commute for work, nearby supermarkets, and maybe few shops/cafes. 

3. What would be the average expenses of a small family living in this area - for a comfortable, not luxurious lifestyle? We are comfortable with our finances currently - dont really look to downgrade. We live a modest life - cooking mostly at home, occasional meal and coffee outings, holidays abroad twice a year.

Long and short of it I shat where I eat, asked out a coworker.
She said no, I said no worries.
But since then she’s been talking to me as much if not even more - bearing in mind not long after I asked her out I said ‘look don’t take this the wrong way, I don’t keep that many female friends and never girls who I’m interested in’.

Kinda had a similar conversation a few times now and by a joined effort we still end up back talking again, and I end up thinking I have a chance, and maybe I do - but she said no, I don’t want to delude myself into thinking that has changed. 

Not sure if she just isn’t attracted to me, or if it’s just because we work together - she mentioned the latter as a ‘yeah but wouldn’t it be a bad idea’ etc. I’m leaning towards the latter but it’s not like it’ll change the end result.

On top of that people at work think there’s something going on between us. Between us making coffees for each other, sitting talking up at each others desks, going making coffees together and walking in in the mornings together.
All of which I’ve said to her and she just says nah they’re just poking fun at you, they don’t think anything’s actually going on.

I don’t want to be a tool, but at the same time - I don’t want to be friends with this girl who I am stupidly attracted to and gives me loads of attention but just doesn’t see me the same way.

In a way - she’s not being fair, she’s wanting friendship from someone who’s told her outright - we can’t be friends.
But I still feel like the ahole who’s the problem here.

But lately I've just become overwhelmed with worry about how others see me and judge my performance. This is partially as I have to do an MSF soon.




I feel like every day I have many spiky interactions with colleagues. Whether this is nursing staff (usually), ward clerks, emails from random secretaries, referrals to 
specialty registrars, questions for consultants, dealing with patients etc. Nurses ""escalate"" any unhappy patient to The Doctor (me) to palm them off on someone else, so I'm always getting the brunt of whatever systemic issue has fucked them over.


I try my best to be polite and friendly, and I know communication skills are my strength, but it feels there's this constant negative tone in everyone's voice and a ""why the fuck are you speaking to me about this?"" attitude. I sat in handover the other day wondering why the nurse running it was talking to everyone like they'd just shat in her coffee, when the day hadn't even begun yet.



I wonder if NHS culture has just normalised being abrupt and rude to people? There's also a hiring freeze at my trust that means everyone is overworked.


It seems to be gradually weighing me down and I don't know if I'm alone in this? I end the day feeling very relieved I don't have to speak to anyone else.

So, I (28M) work in a pretty relaxed office. We’re allowed to listen to music, share memes, and even joke around as long as the work gets done. Last week, I was presenting a quarterly report to my team, which included my boss, a few coworkers, and—unfortunately—one of the HR reps.

I had everything prepared: a nice PowerPoint, some charts, and even a funny meme at the end to lighten the mood. The problem? My personal laptop was connected to the big screen because my work laptop was acting up.

Now, here’s where I fucked up.

Earlier that week, my girlfriend and I had a very fun weekend, and as a little… experiment, I decided to edit together some of our best moments into a private montage. Tasteful, artsy, and for our eyes only. I had even added a cheesy pop song in the background as a joke.

Back to the presentation. I finish my PowerPoint, everyone’s nodding, and I confidently say, “Let me pull up one more thing.”

I open my media player.

And there it is.

Full screen. Crystal clear. My naked ass, smack dab in the middle of the office projector.

At first, there was dead silence. Then, one of my coworkers let out the most primal scream I’ve ever heard. Someone dropped their coffee. My boss muttered, “Oh, Jesus.” And the HR rep? She just stared at me, eyes wide, like she was deciding whether to fire me on the spot.

I scrambled to close the window, but in my panic, I pressed the volume button instead. Suddenly, the speakers blasted, “TAKE MY BREATH AWAYYYY” while my girlfriend and I did things that should never be seen in 4K.

I finally yanked the HDMI cable out like my life depended on it. The damage was done.

No one said a word for a solid ten seconds. Then my boss just sighed and said, “You’re taking the rest of the day off.”

I am now officially the guy who played his sex tape in a meeting. HR called me in the next day for a serious talk about professionalism. Luckily, since it was an accident, I wasn’t fired—but I will never live this down.

I am 29M and he is 25M for reference. We hit it off great and were texting and snap chatting regularly throughout the day.  We went on a lot of dates and he spent the night on Valentine’s, which is something I haven’t experienced before. We live a little over an hour away from each other and distance wasn’t an issue at the beginning, until he got a second job.

He started working at a coffee shop and had less availability to see me, and I felt like I was competing for his time with his other friends when he did have a night off. Towards the end the messages were definitely less flirty and the last time I saw him I could feel him pulling away, and it sucked. This is the longest relationship I’ve had due to a number of reasons, and I’ve only come out and started dating guys a little under a year ago. 

Last night he called me and said that with his life rn and the distance he doesn’t think he can give me what I need and didn’t want to hold me back. And it absolutely sucked. This was the first time I’ve had a relationship end due to circumstances outside of my control and I’m just feeling so down. It’s so hard to find someone that meets your criteria for dating, who was a good communicator, and that I just felt comfortable with. And I know it was early and I couldn’t tell him not to get a second job, and I respect he needed his own free time and space and time with his friends, but it sucks he couldn’t prioritize me. 

In my mind a 1 hour drive may seem like a lot, but it’s not if it’s someone you like. I keep doing this to myself, getting too invested too early and it leaves me in shambles every time. It’s so hard not to, especially since the attraction was mutual. I am planning on moving in October, as I recently got a new wfh job and want to live in a walkable city with more things to do, but I would’ve been willing to move closer to him if we could’ve kept up the relationship for just a few more months.

I’m trying to find the silver lining, but it’s hard to think that right now. All the thoughts of what could’ve been race through my mind, but I do realize with his second job his schedule wasn’t going to change anytime soon. He wants to remain friends, but honestly I’m not interested if I can’t be with him. I just feel like all the effort and energy I put into that relationship was wasted, and it’s not anyone’s fault that this happened. Maybe it’s a lack of dating experience why I’m feeling this way, but I seriously thought I found someone who genuinely liked me and would prioritize me without any red flags. I feel dumb, naive, and abandoned, despite seeing the signs leading up to it. Even in my journal yesterday before the call I was writing about how I need to decide if seeing him once every 2 weeks would be worth continuing a romantic relationship, and it honestly wouldn’t. So maybe he saved me the trouble of coming to the same conclusion, but it still hurts.",1,1742931903.0,askgaybros,0,1.0,False

If she is cheating then let her go. If she wants to come clean or keep it open let it be open. **But DO NOT FKN ACCEPT GASLIGHTING FROM ANYONE.**

# Location Tracking

1. **Google Maps Timeline**
   * Beyond basic location history, export her Timeline data (via Google Takeout if you have her account access) for a detailed spreadsheet of movements over months. Map these against her schedule—unexplained detours to residential areas, late-night stops, or recurring visits to a specific spot could signal something. Check ""Trip Details"" for transit methods (e.g., was she driven?).
2. **Significant Locations (iPhone)**
   * Dig into Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services > System Services > Significant Locations. Enable it if it’s off (requires her passcode), then review timestamps and addresses. Cross-check with her calendar or verbal alibis—frequent “errands” at an odd address might not add up.
3. **Find My Phone or Friends**
   * If she uses Find My (iPhone) or Google’s Find My Device (Android), log into her iCloud or Google account from another device. See her real-time location or last known spot. If she shares her location with you, monitor for inconsistencies (e.g., “at the gym” but pinging elsewhere).
4. **Wi-Fi Connection History**
   * On Android, go to Settings > Network & Internet > Wi-Fi > Saved Networks to see every network she’s joined. On iOS, it’s trickier (no direct list), but if she’s on your Wi-Fi, check the router’s logs for her device’s MAC address and connection times elsewhere. Look for unfamiliar networks like “John’s Wi-Fi.”
5. **Fitness Tracker Sync**
   * If she syncs a Fitbit, Apple Watch, or similar to her phone, open the app (e.g., Fitbit app, Health on iOS). Check step counts, sleep patterns, or GPS-tracked workouts. Sudden activity spikes at odd hours or locations could hint at unreported outings.

# Communication Apps

1. **Text Messages (Deep Dive)**
   * Beyond basic texts, use the search function (magnifying glass in Messages on iOS/Android) to find keywords like “love,” “meet,” or a name she avoids mentioning. Check group chats for flirty side comments. Restore deleted texts via iCloud backup (Settings > General > Transfer or Reset iPhone > Restore from iCloud) if you can access it.
2. **Call Logs and Voicemail**
   * Review call duration and frequency in the Phone app. Call unknown numbers from a blocked line to hear who answers (e.g., a man’s voice). Check voicemail (dial her carrier’s VM number if needed) for saved messages she forgot to delete—some carriers keep them indefinitely.
3. **Email (Hidden Accounts)**
   * Open her email app and check all folders (Inbox, Sent, Trash, Spam) for flirty exchanges or confirmations (e.g., hotel bookings). Search for dating site notifications (e.g., “Tinder match”). If she uses Gmail, go to [myaccount.google.com](http://myaccount.google.com) \> Security > Third-party apps with account access for linked apps she’s hidden.
4. **Encrypted Messaging Apps**
   * Open WhatsApp, Signal, or Telegram. Check “Starred Messages” or “Pinned Chats” for prioritized conversations. Look for self-destructing messages (Signal’s Disappearing Messages setting) or locked chats (WhatsApp’s Chat Lock). Export chat backups (WhatsApp > Settings > Chats > Chat Backup) if synced to Google Drive/iCloud.
5. **Voice Assistants**
   * Ask Siri (iOS) or Google Assistant (Android) about recent queries: “What did I ask yesterday?” or check voice history (Google app > More > Activity). Look for searches like “delete call history” or “hotels nearby.” On Android, go to [myactivity.google.com](http://myactivity.google.com) for a full log.
6. **Screen Time/Digital Wellbeing (Full Audit)**
   * Break down app usage by day/hour. A sudden jump in Snapchat at 2 a.m. or a dating app she claims she doesn’t use is a red flag. On iOS, check Downtime or App Limits for apps she’s restricted—why hide them? On Android, look at app permissions (Settings > Apps > Permissions) for suspicious access (e.g., camera use).
7. **Hidden or Vault Apps**
   * Search for apps like Calculator+, Private Photo Vault, or Keepsafe. Test calculator apps—some require a secret code (e.g., “1234+”) to unlock hidden content. Check Settings > General > iPhone Storage (iOS) or Settings > Apps (Android) for unfamiliar names with high data usage.
8. **Dating App Remnants**
   * Even if deleted, search her email for signup confirmations or payment receipts (e.g., Tinder Premium). On iOS, check Settings > Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions > Allowed Apps for blocked apps. On Android, look in Google Play > Subscriptions.
9. **Two-Factor Authentication Clues**
   * Open Settings > Passwords (iOS) or Google Password Manager (Android) to see saved logins. Look for unrecognized accounts (e.g., a second Instagram). Check her text messages for 2FA codes from apps she doesn’t admit to using.
10. **App Notifications (Silent Mode)**
   * Go to Settings > Notifications. See which apps have alerts disabled—silenced dating apps or messengers suggest hiding. Watch her phone when it’s idle; a locked screen with no buzz might mean selective muting.

# Media and Files

1. **Photo/Video Gallery (Hidden Folders)**
   * Open Photos (iOS) or Gallery (Android). Check “Hidden” or “Recently Deleted” albums for suggestive pics or videos. On iOS, use Face ID-protected Hidden Album (Settings > Photos). On Android, look for .nomedia folders via a file explorer app.
2. **Cloud Storage (Full Sweep)**
   * Log into iCloud, Google Drive, or Dropbox. Search for encrypted ZIPs, oddly named files, or private albums. Check shared folders for exchanges with others. Use [iCloud.com](http://iCloud.com) to restore deleted files if she’s sloppy.
3. **Screenshots and Downloads**
   * Check the Screenshots folder for captured chats or maps she forgot to delete. On Android, Downloads (Files app) might hold PDFs or tickets (e.g., movie stubs for two). On iOS, Files > On My iPhone > Downloads is similar.
4. **Camera Roll Metadata**
   * Open a photo, tap “Info” (iOS) or “Details” (Android) to see when and where it was taken. A selfie at an unknown spot with geotags could contradict her story.
5. **Audio Recordings**
   * Check Voice Memos (iOS) or Recorder (Android) for saved calls or notes. Some cheaters record meetups as mementos—listen for background noise or voices.

# Habits and Patterns

1. **Battery Usage Trends**
   * Settings > Battery shows which apps drain power most. A spike in a messaging app after she’s “asleep” suggests late-night use. Compare daily patterns—sudden shifts might align with new connections.
2. **Browser History (Incognito Fails)**
   * Even in Incognito, autofill (type random letters in the address bar) reveals past searches. Look for specific keywords or gift sites. Check bookmarks for secret logins.
3. **Keyboard Predictions**
   * Open Notes and type random words—her keyboard’s learned phrases (Settings > General > Keyboard > Text Replacement on iOS) might suggest frequent terms like a lover’s name or “hide.”
4. **Alarm and Calendar Check**
   * Look at Clock > Alarms for odd wake-ups (e.g., 3 a.m. for a “call”). Open Calendar for coded events—“meeting” at a hotel. Sync with iCloud/Google Calendar for deleted entries.
5. **Bluetooth Pairings**
   * Settings > Bluetooth > Paired Devices lists car stereos or earbuds. “Mike’s AirPods” when she claims no Mike exists is a clue. Check connection history if available.

# Beyond the Phone

1. **Smart Home Devices**
   * If she uses Alexa/Google Home synced to her phone, check the app’s activity log (e.g., Alexa app > More > Activity). Queries like “turn off lights” at odd hours or locations suggest she’s elsewhere.
2. **Banking/Payment Apps**
   * Open Venmo, Cash App, or bank apps (if you know her PIN). Look for payments to unknown people, coffee dates, or hotel charges. Search her email for e-receipts if she’s logged out.
3. **SIM Card Swap Check**
   * Inspect the phone’s SIM tray (needs a pin) for a second SIM or eSIM (Settings > Cellular > Add eSIM on iOS). A dual-SIM setup could mean a secret number. Call her known number while holding the phone—if it doesn’t ring, she’s rerouting.
4. **Social Engineering via Phone**
   * Text an unknown number from her phone (“Hey, it’s me, new number”) and see who replies. Or call a frequent contact pretending to be a wrong number—gauge their familiarity.

Do this everyday for a few days to find if they are actually cheating or not. Once again gaslighting like this women shown in this video should never be allowed. #**Say NO TO GASLIGHITNG**",1,1742931826.0,onexindia,3,1.0,False

I felt my previous post was biased and I typed it out in a bout of fury and sadness . I want an unbiased , fair judgement about our relationship and roles but the Reddit members ( not a great place to seek relationship advice , I agree . But I’m too broke to go for therapy so this will suffice for now . ) 

My problems : 
1) I am very disorganised. I can get very lazy and forgetful and I sometimes leave the dry laundry in the washing machine without folding  till I get a weekend . ( we are both doctors ) I am generally a messier person compared to my husband even though I’m not “dirty” - I maintain good personal hygiene if you were wondering 😅

This is the biggest and only complaint he has of me - I am trying to rectify it - I have started making time to organise then and there even though the messiness and basic lack of skills in keeping things spick and proper . 
I will confirm with him if there is something else he would want to add in this . 

2) I forgot to wish him at 12 am for his last birthday . I wished him at 9 am morning on the day of his birthday . Mind you , this is annoying because I have been very immature about birthdays - I keep reminding him not to forget mine and I start this one week prior to my birthday . So yes that’s bad . 

3) Bad at technology : I am very bad at technology and am a slow learner - for now he does the process of paying bills and taxes - while I contribute equally . He fought with me once saying I have no clue about these things but refused to teach me when I sat down and asked him to teach . 

His problems : 

1) He does not know how to cook : he does not know how to, does not want to know . I cook all his favourite authentic dishes for him that he loves - referring to the old post , when I fight about him not putting in efforts to cook even one meal for me ( that is my love language ) , he fights back saying he never asked me to cook in the first place . He also does not want us to order from outside more than once a week. He is fine to survive with food like curd rice and water - I am not . 

2) He lacks empathy ( according to me ) : He expects care and love when he is slightly sick / running a temperature / having myalgia - he asks and expects for massages and love - however he has never once checked up on me while I am in pain during my periods . I am having an abortion this coming Saturday and he asked if we could go for car viewing on the same day . 
He heats and makes his own coffee / tea but never once has it occurred to him to pour a cup for me , even when I am sick . 

3) Inconsiderate for my likes and wishes : 

I have always been the first to support him with anything he wants to buy for his wishes - we bought a PS5 for him ( he says us - but it was his longtime wish) - I go for car viewing that takes hours even though I have no interest in the technicalities, we watch his favourite shows on YouTube (different language, men comedy ) . 

My only two loves in life are travel and food . We went for one trip after our marriage but I am more of an outdoor person who considers even a day out to the park as an experience . He mostly likes to sit in and study - he has his reasons to not come out for example - motion sickness , does not like public transport etc . As to food - he is not a foodie , does not enjoy food or the experience of trying new food at all . 

4) introverted with my family as well : His family and culture is way different to mine - however I gelled in and genuinely make an effort to be part of their family . However , he uses his “language barrier “ as a reason to not converse much with my family - he does not have a bond with anyone in my family which is slowly building up resentment in myself against his family . 

All in all I am not saying he is a bad person . I have sat and talked and fought about gifting and pampering me and my love language for so long - he has shown some improvement like bringing me a chain from his last business trip ( which I still wear proudly everyday ) - like I said it’s not about money for me but these efforts , complements etc .

Please provide advice . And kindly be kind . 🌻 thanks ",1,1742931629.0,InsideIndianMarriage,5,0.6,False

1jjs6xk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/1jjs6xk/i_overcame_8_years_of_brain_fog/,I overcame 8 years of brain fog,"Let me tell you about my strange experience. 

I suffered from brain fog for a total of 8 years, from 2013 to 2020. 
In addition, I also suffered from hypersomnia, fatigue, orthostatic tachycardia, and atypical depression. 

I will tell you how I overcame brain fog. In 2020, I drank coffee in the evening and suddenly felt miserable about my reality in the early morning and started to cry. 
During that process, I cried so much that I hyperventilated and calmed down repeatedly. 
Then, I clenched my teeth and pulled my head to the right to stimulate my left sternocleidomastoid muscle. After about 3 seconds, as if it were a lie, I felt the fog in my head clear up in an instant and my head became incredibly clear to the point that my eyes opened wide. 

The feeling was so impressive that my head felt the same way as when you chew mint. 
This refreshing feeling lasted all day, and when I tried to think negative thoughts, the refreshing feeling disappeared. 
However, my head was still clear. It returned to normal. It is still clear even in 2025.  

I thought my brainfog was due to depression, but I realized it was a physical problem. 
In fact, I took physical education classes for 8 years and did neck stretching a lot, but I didn't have this positive reaction back then. 
I still don't know why I got better. And I don't know why I had brain fog. 

If I were to guess the cause, after my father passed away in 2013, I took a Korean herbal medicine for a month. People around me recommended that I take herbal medicine to calm my nerves. After taking it, I started to sleep a lot, and my mother later recommended that I stop taking it. And at some point, I got brain fog without realizing it. 

So I suspect that the herbal medicine was the cause of my brain fog.

Immediately after the brain fog disappeared, the frequency of orthostatic tachycardia decreased significantly and hypersomnia also improved. When I had brain fog, I would fall asleep after sitting at my desk for only 20 minutes, but now I don't nap at all. I used to be that kind of person.

1jjs550,https://www.reddit.com/r/PBDpodcast/comments/1jjs550/adam_was_right_sorry_pat_ツ/,Adam was right. Sorry Pat ¯\_(ツ)_/¯,"Even though today’s podcast was chaotic at the end, at least Adam pushed back with a real issue that men are encountering especially in metropolitan areas. 

Pat thinks Adam’s complaining on the behalf of other men is victimhood. But he doesn’t  realize how feminism in combustion with OF(onlyfans) and the Pandemic have truly created a train to hell for average guys making 38-50k a year at 5’8”. Pat started talking about how he would meet girls on tinder if he was single, but doesn’t know how many onlyfans bots are on tinder, how when real accounts respond, it’s only to 10% of men, when the guy initiates the date, how many more flake. It’s not like the 1950s or even covert promiscuity like in the 90s feminism era.

 Imagine waking up as a lady, your social media is flooded with hundreds of message requests from guys you don’t like, tons of high value men wanting to invite them on a yacht party at night, other guys trying to pay you $5000 to have sex, another asking for your feet pics and shoes with sweaty socks that you’ve worn for the entire week for $300. 
A celebrity like future attempting to fly you out to the Caribbean. The nice guy who your family knows that’s the neighbor telling you how nice you look and you ignoring them because you have hundreds of other compliments in your instagram requests inboxes. 

Then the bad boy credit card scammer that you are really chasing that leaves you on read. And you might think it’s crazy but this is happening to average women, why? Because celebrity men try to one up each other by finding and flying out regular everyday cute girls as a notch under their belt. And here you are trying to take them to Las Olas or Wynwood as a regular guy for a dinner/ coffee date . They are either juggling more guys than 20 years ago with the social media hypergamy. they are were on only fans and you can reverse image their pictures after spending weeks courting just to find out this unsettling truth. Orrr like back when I was single, one would literally tell me her tactic on getting free food from dates with men who she doesn’t like and has saved under her contacts as “free food” (which she told me after she did it on me when I was more naive lol). 

This isnt victimhood, this is an audit on the reality about men which Pbd wouldn’t even escape as a millionaire in this day and age. Like his advice he gave today on finding them in country clubs instead of nightclubs doesn’t work.

Why? Because there’s another feminist evolution forming a year or two ago of conservative women who are not found at these places pbd are talking about, they are “boss babes” like Adam’s said which most of his stuff is echoed by PBDs friend Myron Gaines who he doesn’t want to bring on the show because his truth is disrespectful which is the same truth and crassness that PBD reprimanded Adam today for, and why he read Myron’s $200 super chats towards Andrew “fake intellectual” Schultz on the last ep he was on instead of having a 2/3 hour podcast with Myron or Adam about this topic

But f your feelings these are facts for most average men right now, that even if you step it up and make money and get higher status, like Pat stated, after saying “why should we feel sorry for those men”. After all that hard work and these average men going through these issues finally become above-average,…..
…
…
THEY end up encountering these conservative women grifting the conservative movement and hanging around these high value males that Pat just told guys to be, and they are just the next evolution of the instagram girls, but more discreet!  It’s like evolving a Pikachu into a Raichu,  or evolving from shit coins to stock options. They are evolved by lurking on escort sites not for prostitution but for a chance to encounter these men, on yacht parties and country clubs, at cigar lounges. And at the end of the day it’s the same ones with promiscuous pasts and OF accounts but they just did a better job at hiding it! (Ashley st clair, Toni Lahren, Brett cooper ) with promiscuous pasts especially in their college lives d hopping and their classmates recollections provide evidence of “304lation” like Adam stated (which he got from Myron). Which sounds “disrespectful” to pbds “audience” as he said, but it’s true! Which is Adam’s point! Can’t even believe I’m agreeing with Adam but pbd is not right about this. And bringing up Tom’s daughters and how it’s disrespectful to them makes no sense. That’s like saying calling out drug dealers is disrespectful to my son. How?? I’m raising my son not to be a drug dealer same way Tom has raised his daughters not to be like these normal 304s that have taken over. How is that disrespect, it’s more as a cautionary tale. “Son don’t be like the drug dealer because you will end up in jail or shot, success is your only mfin option, failures not” OR “Daughters, don’t be OF 304s or promiscuous like Adam is talking about, be virtuous, you are born with your value don’t give it away to Everyman that you come in contact with, especially not for money” 

And voila. Even if White-Knights want to refute this, even those guys know it's true, case and point hypocrites like Harry Sisson",1,1742931422.0,PBDpodcast,0,1.0,False

I’ve have had recurrent stomach problems for a few months now. I had an endoscopy and colonoscopy 2 years ago due to blood on my stool and only internal hemorrhoids were found. In my colonoscopy, they tested for celiac disease and chrons but i apparently had neither. I was diagnosed with chronic superficial gastritis with hiatal hernia 2 years ago. 

Symptoms got better over time but recently in the last few months I have new symptoms like loss of appetite, super bad fatigue, unusual burping after eating and lots of trapped gas, and random sharp stomach pains. I haven’t had much nausea and I’ve never vomited anything. I also haven’t lost any weight but I can’t seem to put on anything as I don’t have much appetite. I haven’t had the best of diet ever really and it mostly consists of coffee, milk, chicken, and snacks

I recently went to the gastro doctor again 7 months ago and got a 2nd endoscopy due to my symptoms being worse and was told I had mild inflammation and my hiatal hernia was still present, 4 biopsies were taken and no H Pylori. I noticed I had been having cold hands and feet so I went to the doctor and they said my cbc was normal but I had mild iron deficiency as my ferritin was 27. My Vitamin D was low at 21 and My Hemoglobin was normal so was the rest of the iron panel. 

I don’t have any family history of cancer on my mother’s side and I don’t know my father’s history as I’ve never known him. However I know he’s still kicking in his 60’s so I don’t believe I have any genetics that would predispose me to having cancer. I don’t have any risk factors of stomach cancer as I don’t smoke tobacco and I drink very rarely. I rarely eat processed meats.

5 months ago, I insisted on getting a CT scan as the doctors thought it could be appendix related but the CT with contrast was completely unremarkable with nothing not even any inflamed lymph nodes seen.

Recently, I noticed that the Virchow’s Node and the right side lymph nodes in my collarbone was a little swollen on after I eat or smoke marijuana. I went to the ER as I have a 4 week wait to see my PCP and they thought my lymph nodes were a little swollen on both sides but didn’t seem too concerned.

I’m now really concerned that they could’ve missed something in the 2nd endoscopy. Any suggestions or insight appreciated! I don’t know if I should go back to the ER as I don’t wanna keep using something that’s for urgent emergencies but I don’t wanna wait 4-8 weeks to get in with a gastro doctor then wait even longer for another endoscopy if I do have cancer that’s progressing.",1,1742931380.0,stomachcancer,0,1.0,False

1jjs1r1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1jjs1r1/aio_very_very_odd_first_date/,AIO very very odd first date,"I (23M) went out for a spontaneous date with a girl (23F) I matched with on bumble a few days ago.
We agreed nothing is going to happen but just wanted to meet in person and see how we vibed with each other.

We meet at a coffee spot and I pay for her drink and she doesn’t thank me, which, whatever- I’m from the south so it feels second nature to me. We sit and chat and tbh I feel like I’m carrying the conversation but she finally begins warming up.

We leave to go to a bookstore and she stops me to text her friend saying that she’s safe. Odd she wouldn’t text and walk but whatever. A minute goes by and a girl with a fake mustache and glasses shows up and they start laughing. Her friend was in the cafe with her watching us. I got a chuckle out of it- and she even showed me a newspaper she cut holes out of to spy. 

I assumed she’d say something along the lines of ‘yeah I’ll meet up with you later, yall have fun’- but instead they both ask if she can tag along. I pause but say yes because I’d look like an ass if I said no.

We proceed to walk and talk for a while and go to the bookstore. Several different moments the girl I went on a date on is just talking with her friend and making inside jokes. I really make sure my uncomfortable isn’t on my face lmao- but it was so awkward. 

We finally go to eat at a dennys because we were craving hashbrowns. We chatted and it wasn’t an awful time but at no moment did I think of it as a date anymore. At some moments the friend tells me I’m the favorite guy out of anyone she’s spoken to- and the girl I’m on a date with says I’m the only guy that hasn’t made a comment about her large chest size. (How do you even respond to that lmao) They end up sharing a plate, but I end up paying for all of us. Again, didn’t thank me. I told her I had to go home because I had work early in the morning- I get home and she tells me that she wants to kiss me next time she sees me and she had a great time and her friend really liked me.

I told her I’m kinda offput about the whole situation and although it was funny, I cannot fathom getting into a relationship of any kind with her. She told me it was just a fun thing and to not think of it so deeply. She said that it was a one time thing and it won’t happen again but got more annoyed when I told her I was good. 
Should I have been more open minded to that?? Like is that not really weird behavior or am I just old school. 
Totally fine updating friends how a dates going- but having them join…?

TLDR:
First date, girl brings her friend to playfully stalk us but then proceeds to tag along on the entire date (4 hours that felt like 40). (And also never verbally thanked me for paying for anything- just a little bitter about that lol). I told her I’m not really interested in her cause of that and now she’s saying that it wasn’t meant to be taken in a bad way.

I am a 27 yo man and I would appreciate your dating advice. I used the search option here and was not satisfied with the results, so apologies if you feel otherwise.

I have been texting with a girl that I have very briefly met back at the Unviersity around 3-4 years ago for quite some time now. Things are going pretty good and it's been a very slow burn until last Sunday when we met in person and, to say it lightly, I am very interested in pursuing a relationship with her.

We went to a fancy place for ramen and then moved to a local cafe for coffee. The entire thing lasted around 2,5 hours and we got to know each other more. I think we had a pretty good time. We met and ended the date by hugging and it was pretty chill. Not much more in terms of physical contact; I am quite reserved in that matter (as in: not wanting to scare her away or do something that is unnatural to me or would seem forceful) and, to be perfectly honest, she seems that way as well. She replied enthusiastically to my comment that I had a great time and would like for us to meet again.

The thing is, I am doubting myself where should I invite her next. I do not have a lot of dating experience and this is the first time I am genuinely interested in pursuing someone since high school. I would like to invite her to a fancy italian restaurant that I enjoy (nothing crazy price-wise, but classy). I'd have the option to invite her for a walk in the nearby park in case we would like to extend the date. I am mainly interested in getting to know her more (which would be easy) and naturally intiate subtle physical contact (which would be difficult as it's a dinner date and we would be sitted opposite to each other; and, frankly, I am clueless in that regard).

What do you think? Is another dinner date a bad idea? Does it seem boring? I can hold conversation with her easily and naturally, and have her have a good time, but I would feel awkward trying to touch her in that setting because of my lack of experience. I also thought about inviting her to mini-golf, which would be more casual and less talkative, and would grant me more occassion to naturally show physical interest. Probably no alcohol. I am reserving a classy wine bar idea for the third date.

The main reason I even post here is my emotional state right now, as I am very excited and would like to not f this up. So sorry about that! And thanks in advance!",1,1742931122.0,AskMenAdvice,19,1.0,False

Yesterday was our 3 months and we had plans to go into the city for a nice dinner and to go bowling. Earlier that day she had come over and we watched a movie while cuddling and just chilling and everything seemed to be going great we were laughing and play wrestling all the things that made us happy. Then I dropped her off at her house so she could get ready for tonight while I went to get a haircut. After my haircut was done she text me that she’d like to talk to me about something before we had went on our date. I paid no mind to it as we’re usually pretty open and I assumed it was about the cost of everything as she had mentioned splitting the bill earlier today so I didn’t have to pay for everything. Once I got to her house she came outside and told me “I don’t want to lead you on and I don’t feel a click with you and you deserved a better person” she then walked back inside and sent me a text saying she’s sorry and that was that. It’s been a day now and I got very little sleep last night because all I can do is think about the happy memories I’ve made with her from going to church every Sunday and our little coffee dates. Maybe I’m just overthinking but there was no signs that there was any problems in our relationship and it feels odd to me she didn’t come and talk to me before making this decision she simply said a sentence and left me there.

1jjryee,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleCoffee/comments/1jjryee/overthinking_buying_an_espresso_machine_need_help/,Overthinking buying an espresso machine? Need help w/ WAF.,"First if all, I know this sub is full of buying advices, though often focused on the main coffee lover in an household. 

I’m done pouring Nespresso’s and often don’t like the super automatics, like the Siemens machines. So I have decided to go for a Sage espresso machine as a first espresso machine. 

Currently I’m considering; the Bambino Plus with a grinder or the Touch (impress). But can’t decide since the wife is a huge part of this decision. She wants to be able to pour simple Americano’s, espresso’s and what not for her guests. So a single dose grinder with a scale would be a no-go for her. And the touch  (impress) seems a good fit to guide her through the process.

On the other hand, I think of the Sage as a gateway drug to more. So starting with a good grinder and Bambino Plus might be the best. But what grinder should I get with a hopper and perhaps possibility to get a silicon ballow. 

Though I do not want to spend big time on the grinder. Thinking of a budget of around € 400,-? What do you all use as grinder and how does your wife approve of it? ",2,1742930955.0,BrevilleCoffee,7,1.0,False
1jjry8o,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jjry8o,AIO to the way my girlfriend talks to me,"I'm being genuine with this post.  I've been concerned that I'm being verbally abused at times during my relationship.

Its worse in person and I have other screenshots of conversations where I was being cussed out, and told  she can't trust me ever again. 

For context she read my diary and I wrote about a recent ex girlfriend leading up to my birthday. The writing went like, it's been 2 years since we broke up and its crazy how fast time flies my birthday is in a couple weeks. 


She read it and got upset that I wrote about her in my diary, I never said I missed her and in fact I said on a previous page how happy my life has turned out.


She denied I even had any other pages and made me prove it, or else ""I'd never let it go"" 

On top of that she told me to go date her and be with my ""#1""

 She told me how i should consider how she feels, even though she invaded my privacy in my personal office as well. Not in a public area of the home.

The papers she read were on loose paper because I had filled the journal and she didn't believe me that I did. So I sent her a snapchat video of it. I never got an apology without having to apologize that I wrote about my ex.


Up to recent events.

It was a late night and I was falling asleep in my chair watching some YouTube videos. My dog hanging out with me. 

She came in and was upset,  and sad that she doesn't have friends and feels lonely. I did my best to comfort her. I moved to the couch and rubbed her. Comforted her with words I would want to hear.

She got upset with me I didn't say certain words and phrases. I voiced a concern that I don't say the right things and I had a feeling before sitting down the sadness was going to turn into aggression towards me. Because it has in the past. 

That was how I pushed her away and hurt her.

The argument ensued from there and i walked away because once it's emotionally charged it's not possible to communicate. I walked away and I ended up closing the door to separate us until we could talk again.

She came back and opened the door and cried loudly. Sat on the bed and yelled/talked to me. Telling me how bad I am and how I should've done all these things.

I had to beg her to go away before she finally did. 

I closed and locked the door and went to bed

The following day, I went to the gym got us both coffee on the way home and tried to talk to her.

She doesn't want to talk unless we have a therapist between us.

I wanted to share these texts because she's blaming me for the way I make her feel. But I only am expressing that I don't appreciate the way I'm being talked to. 

Am I over reacting? I'm currently looking for one ",4,1742930943.0,AIO,15,1.0,False

4. They seem even more gassed when they’re home from dinner which they drove to and from.

*** I did not screen record the whole video as there’s no point but in the beginning of it when she’s doing her makeup she says “this has to last all day and after a couple of margaritas” aka she’s planning to drink already and driving there anyways.

Pasadena, CA 91101

2 blocks West of Lake Avenue, which has both East and Westbound exits off of the 210 Freeway.

# What is a Type-in?

[Type-ins](https://type-in.org/) are community-based, family friendly events at which typewriter enthusiasts share their love for the analog art of putting ink onto paper with mechanical marvels of the late 19th through 20th centuries. To do this they bring one or more manual typewriters and their knowledge and love of the machines to share with the community. New friends share stories, history, repair tips, working methods, and other typewriterly ephemera. Typists of all ages and levels of ability are welcome.

**Typewriters optional**  
We definitely encourage those without their own machines to attend. With some luck and the kindness of new friends, you should be able to try out a variety of machines which are present in an effort to decide what styles and feel you might consider for purchasing one of your own one day. (Please kindly ask the owners’ permission before trying a machine out.) If you’ve got multiple typewriters, feel free to bring an extra for a friend.

>“Like a jam session for people who like typewriters. You had unions do sit-ins and hippies do be-ins, so I thought, ‘We’ll do a type-in.’”  
—Michael McGettigan, 56, bike shop owner who coined the phrase

# Vroman’s Bookstore

I recently took my niece to a comic convention. This involved a hotel overnight stay, dinner, train tickets, convention price tickets, ad hoc bits (drinks, snacks, bus etc). My niece is 12 years old. She did not offer to get me a drink, a coffee, nothing all weekend. She got home after the convention and didn’t send me a thank you message. 

Am I being unreasonable for being annoyed? I’m in two minds about her only being 12 but also it has always been ingrained in me to show appreciation to others. I have not spoken to her about it. 

To be clear, I do not expect her to contribute to hotel costs, dinner etc etc I’m just illustrating that it was expensive. She also spent over 200 buying things for herself at the convention (money she had saved from her confirmation etc). ",0,1742930673.0,AmIOverreacting,18,0.4,False

INT - Cassetemen Base - Russia - Blizzard Storm, Afternoon


Representative Casseteman prepares to open the screen for a broadcast. 


Representative Casseteman: Hurry the cleaning everyone, miss administrator is about to stream in a few minutes. We're all gonna be demerited if she finds this place messy!


Some cassette drones rush to carry trash and crumpled paperwork.


Representative Casseteman: Okay agents, gather up because we're going live on her screen in five four three-


Cassette Administrator: Good afternoon cassette men…


Representative Casseteman: Tw- Oh greetings, miss administrator! You are looking great today eh-


It cuts to the screen, it showed the administrator who's very exhausted and had her suit and hair messy. It seemed that she hadn't slept for a while and was holding a mug of coffee.


Cassette Administrator: Tell me about it… I have been finiz-hing this paperwork for 3 straight days, I'm not in a better mood today so better speak up some good news or I'm gonna have to do a wide booting on you!! Just kidding… hehehehe, i think i'm going insane here.


Representative Casseteman: Madame, i think you should rest for a while, our captain could just handle things for you.


Cassette Administrator: No, no no no, this paperwork is too confidential for hardware heads to work on. Im fine


Representative Casseteman: I guess you got a point there…


Cassette Administrator: Now back to the reports, as your Administrator, i have to do a weekly report interview on you once again, might be conflicting on my schedule but those people can't wait!! Anyways, what's the play?

 

Representative Casseteman: To start with madame, The alliance has found a new threat on the horizon… There is an entity from the toilet empire that is said to bring back the dead… Aeolus or what you knew as wumbo reported back to us that the Titan of the alliance was Incapacitated and possesed by someone known as the Toilet Necromancer…


Cassette Administrator: Necromancer?? So your telling me theres a toilet that raises the dead out there in a jiff??


Representative Casseteman: Yes madame…


The cassete Administrator tries to hold back her laughter but she laughed thinking it was a joke. The other cassetes feel concerned about the matter.


Cassete Administrator: oh… ohh (chuckles) im sorry, sorry, thats the very first fun thing i ever heard in the week. Necromancer??


She suddenly become serious.


Cassete Administrator: Thats an absurd statement!! Science and the paranormal shouldn’t coexist like this. It’s against all reason!  


Representative Casseteman: And yet, it happened. It appears this “necromancer” is utilizing an unknown form of energy—perhaps quantum manipulation? Or a biological agent we can’t detect? Its been confirmed these things are aliens, and theres even giant lizards that our titan fought what else could possibly be impossible?


Cassete Administrator: (waving her hand dismissively) Oh, spare me the theories, Mr. 027-43. If someone is truly reanimating corpses, I want answers—and I want them now.


Representative Casseteman: Madame there were alot of footages sent on the administrator archive… there could be a footage in your files madame.


She looked through her computer and found nothing but a beeping sound of refusal.


Cassette Administrator: Access denied… WHAT THE HELL… WHAT IS THIS!!


Representative Casseteman: Madame, please calm down for now… we dont want your blood pressure to raise dont we?? Look I'll just begin another topic that happen… so there's a recent conflict that happened in Britain, the toilets have decided to attack London and destroy the clock tower. Our titan was ordered to go in the battle along with others who answered the war call from chief Clockman. 


Cassette Administrator: Britain? Didn't the admin council say it was a large skirmish? Our titan is not for a full scale war, he hasn't even had upgrades like the other titans did! Why didn't they consult me on this?


Representative Cassetteman: It must've been a sudden battle, I was called and heard that every offensive unit in the main base must attend that battle. But don't worry madame there is some good news about that, Fortunately he was given some refinements by the main alliance base. Some camcorder men from the main base told us it's another welcome gift from them, so that we could save materials. He was also picked as an endorser for the main base military empowerment. Pretty cool right madame?


Casseteman Administrator: I guess that's a relief… I still wonder, I just hope our forces never killed those from the skibidi alliance, those other races might've… but we can make up for it when the day comes. Now how about the neurolink project… how did it go…


Representative Casseteman: Madame, our fellow scientist have spoken… so they said its a private manner…


Cassette Administrator: PRIVATE MANNER? WHAT DO YOU MEAN ABOUT THAT?


Representative Casseteman: Everything from the lab is still under confidential grounds, the camcordermen there told me that the place was under a red alert when something happened inside… I tried talking to our scientists and they never responded…


Cassete Administrator: It must have been something bad… well let's just wait for their matters to finish then, i bet that's what happened to the camera friends we had. Say i heard that-


A hologram tried to load in the middle of the conference room, it was glitchy and unrecognizable.


Cassette Administrator: What now??


Titan Casseteman: Titan… reporting in…


Cassette Administrator: Titan Casseteman! Finally you decided to come by What’s your status?  


Titan Casseteman: (distorted but audible) Mission successful. Britain is safe, and the toilets were driven away.  


Cassette Administrator: That’s excellent news. You do not seem to harm them right?? 


Titan Casseteman: No... But I had to fight back at one, a titan of theirs fattacked me senseless... Not to mention the empire sent a new alien-like titan from somewhere...


Cassette Administrator: that goddamn empire... They've been preparing some terror all this time!! Also Toilets had more titans now? This is difficult... To handle. 


Titan Casseteman: I managed to handle the situation... And leave the toilets alive...


Cassette Administrator: Well done, titan Casseteman. I believe the armor alliance provided was of use?  


Titan Casseteman: It… helped, Madame. But I had to discard it during the battle.  


Cassette Administrator: Discard it? Why?  


Titan Casseteman: It was either that or let those dragon things in that red titan machines melt me into a puddle. Priorities.  


Cassette Administrator: (relieved) Well, as long as you survived and saved the day, that’s what matters. The armor can be replaced—  


Suddenly the hologram slowly become visible, titan cassetemans damaged hologram projection sputters to life, showing his condition. His suit is heavily charred, torn, and barely holding together.


Cassette Administrator: Nanda? …What the hell *happened* to your suit?!  


Titan Casseteman shrugs nonchalantly in the projection.


Titan Casseteman: Like I said miss administrator, fire-breathing dragons in that titans back. Things got a bit… intense.  


Representative Casseteman boots his audio (equivalent to clearing his throat).


Representative Casseteman: Miss administrator, perhaps we should—  


Cassette Administrator: This is a disaster! An utter catastrophe! That suit, knitted by russias FINEST THREADS—WAS JUST TORN TO SHREDS! Titan Casseteman, do you have *any* idea how—  


Titan Casseteman: -How rare the threads are? Yes, Madame. I’ve heard it before.  


Cassette Administrator glares at him.


Cassette Administrator: Oh, you’ve heard it, have you? Then you’ll understand why I’m having this cra—  


Representative Casseteman: Madame, Our titan completed the mission successfully. Perhaps we should discuss this further once he’s returned.  


Cassette Administrator: (deep breath) Fine. Titan, return to this base immediately. And prepare yourself—I have some words for you.  


Titan Casseteman: (chuckling slightly) Understood, Madame. 


The hologram flickers off, leaving the room in silence for a moment.


Cassette Administrator sinks back into her chair, exasperated.


Cassette Administrator: Oh god im gonna have to write 36 sections of pardon for this

... What is happening in the world, Dragons in a machine… necromancers… zombies... and now ruined suits. What’s next, Mr. representative...? Aliens? giant bugs? One eyed abominations? WHAT? 


Representative Casseteman: Let’s hope not, My Lady…


Cassette Administrator: I had to go now… i still had a bunch of paperwork to do… Keep doing what you must! And don't make any things that the administration will not like. Administrator out…


It shows the logo of the Casseteman.


Representative Casseteman: Poor madame…


Suddenly a notification appeared in the screen.


“Romania’s frontlines are getting stronger… All aforementioned elite units must prepare for the battle in a span of a few weeks.”


They saw cassetewoman on the list.


Large Casseteman: It seems like an important mission…


Representative Cassetteman: Get cassetewoman prepared now…


INT - MAIN ALLIANCE BASE, GERMANY - ETERNAL DARKNESS - NIGHT.


Alliance Base - Science Lab - Germany.


The Chief Scientist Cameraman was walking in a hallway full of glass windows. Some toilets are shown to be yelling, going insane and going feral on its camcorder men testers, it was a failed test subject. He facepalms.


Suddenly a scientist cameraman reached him out with a neurolink along with some scientist cassete men.


Chief Scientist Cameraman: Where did you go? I was waiting here for almost an hour now...


Scientist Cam: Sorry sir, the compound testing went difficult and heavy to handle, and sir-


Chief Scientist Cameraman: No no it's okay this anyways is...


Chief Scientist Camcorderman: You're last duty... 


The Scientist Camcorderman walks in with some scientists.


Chief Scientist Cameraman: Excuse me sire?


C.S Camcorderman: Congratulations Mr. Chief Scientist you are finally relieved of duty in the alliance base... 


Chief Scientist Cameraman: What??


C.S Camcorderman: The administrators wanted heroes of the backline to get a good rest, and operating the science team in this base must have tired you out.


Chief Scientist Cameraman: Sir I'm okay with things here I just.


C.S Camcorderman: Hohoho... No need to thank me, take a break my friend... You deserve such a thing. My name is #0125-A6-97, (He shakes the chief Scientist Hands) I am the chief scientist of our good camcorder men of this place. And I am the newly assigned chief of scientists in this area from now on.


Chief Scientist Cameraman: New chief? why didn't the administrators emailed me, this fe-


C.S Camcorderman: Oh, my child... Things happen all the time... Some stuff changes here, new management and new superiors... Take a look at that guard in the gate, he's been promoted to a frontline major… I'll cut to the chase, You my friend, are now promoted back to just the chief scientist of your own base... Your friend with the black tie is relieved.


Chief Scientist Cameraman: u-uh... Okay okay sir... large big camcorder sir…


C.S Camcorderman: you seem to be stuttery my friend. It's okay, that happens in events before a nice retirement. Here, mister scientist you get to test your last samples of the neurolink project and you can finally get to celebrate with your friends. Chop chop mr. chief, I'd like to see a demonstration…


They marched into a lab and entered a chamber.


Chief Scientist Cameraman: I still dont get it sir, why am i being demoted, why am i out of this project, i was voted by the scientist committee of the alliance, the cassetemen had entrusted me with the possible blueprints! This is so sudden that i just…


C.S Camcordermen: I know know, i get what you feel mister scientist, it feels sad being separated from your job and getting out of this, hard as a rock project, all you need to worry about is, right now. Your friends and comrades needs you in the camera base right now… your friend. He's being sent to the strider program right now, without a lead scientist in your base there is no hope for improvement. We all know that. Son, i know you'd do better out there, you are gifted, and in branches of science it's not only one project you need to, there are other branches you have to enter to get to a breakthrough.


He caresses C.S cameraman in the shoulder, comforting him.


C.S Cameraman: I see now, i guess… i guess you're right there sir!


C.S Camcorderman: You know son, I've been through alot, I've become a veteran in my field working as a scientist in soviet union… its not like you people know that but it's not the point! Say, before you go why don't you show me how the water flows here huh?


C.S Cameraman: well then, sure thing!!


They went atop the chamber where a camcorder man in a control panel reveals a captured strider skibidi toilet. It was scanned by the cameraman before getting tested.


C.S Cameraman: So to start, we have some battalions outside the battle capture living and living toilets that fit in the condition of the test subjects in this criteria board… then we use the experimental neurolink pin to puncture it down their brain and supposedly make them passive. 

That is our main goal for this project.


The crane moves the toilet on the platform. It was yelling to be freed. The two chief scientists walked together on the platform, chief Scientist Cameraman punctured the neurolink in the head. They then proceed to wait for the result as the crane moves the toilet away.


The toilet first went idle then it it smiled, it then shaken violently as the neurolink pin sparked, it then screamed in pain


Scientist Casseteman: oh my god, that neurolink is busted!! We have to remove that sample now!!


Scientist Camcorderman #1: No, it's unsafe to go near the test subject…


Scientist: But-


It's head sparked and proceeds to burn. The head exploded after as it screams.


Scientist Casseteman: Holy shit… no!!


C.S Camcorderman: I thought its gonna make the toilet good?


Some parts of the chamber got splattered with blood and bursted parts.C.S Cameraman and C.S Camcorderman watched in horror.


C.S Cameraman: No, no no… i swear we got the compound stable that time- we researched this, we have scanned this on our computers… it should've been-



C.S Camcorderman: Oh son… (chuckles)

Dont feel down on this, its just a usual fumble…


C.S Cameraman: Another big fumble!! For the hundredth time, we couldn't get this right!! And the worse part, i showed a superior like you how i fumbled!! Oh- i-im sorry sir, it's just… i feel really down, we worked on #186th very well with the compounds and virus samples you normally wont get from toilets, but it still a mess, i even stained our uniforms… im really sorry.


C.S Camcorderman: hey, hey, kid dont be like that…  that was actually a good way to end a pre-retirment job, WITH A BANG!! I actually love that experiment! But you know what, dont fret and feel down about it… every experiment experience failures, trials and errors. And i promise you son, i will make the most of it and complete this project, and you kid, just made it easier for it to operate, that's what i see about this.


C.S Cameraman: You do sir? Oh wow, t-thank you sir… thank you!! I appreciate the kind words, you know sir, i want you to have this…


He removes the alliance base badge and places it on the chief scientist camcorderman’s coat.

C.S Camcorderman: Why… thank you kid!


C.S Cameraman: I am looking forward for your way operation on this project! I wish you goodluck on this…


Some scientists in the chamber applaud to the two chief scientists.


Scientist Casseteman: We're gonna miss you sire!! We hope you have a nice time back in the camera base!!


C.S Cameraman: Thank you, and i hope you take care of your new superior… dont let his latex gloves be stained!! (Chuckles).


C.S Camcorderman: Now, kid go wipe and change your attire and you go to the cafetria as your colleagues have offered you a farewell party.


He showed him a tablet with a footage of a cctv with some cassetemen, flatscreenmen and camcorderman waiting as a big cake was prepared.


C.S Cameraman: Thank you all for the service guys, and you too sir…


He went down to the elevator platform and exits the chamber… meanwhile chief scientist Camcorderman enters the breakroom of the chamber alone. He talked to someone in the tablet.


C.S Camcorderman: Sir, it's all done, the little pipsqueak is disposed off…


???: Good job mister scientist… you did handle the matters well.


In the screen, an apparition of a large cameraman with red eyes appear from the dark. He is dubbed as “The Operator” 


The Operator: our people don't need to kill him after all like the two cassetemen who don't mind their own business…


C.S Camcordermen: Oh yeah them, i almost got my armor exposed…


The Operator: for now take the lead of the experiment and obtain their findings and get this neurolink working… Soon the administrators will finally be able to weaponize this and take over the entire world. 


C.S Camcorderman: ohoho, (sarcasticslly) yay! Take over the world… your referring to an actual peace and truce between the alliance and toilets right? Coz thats what the administrators wan-


The operator slams his hands on the table.


The Operator: NEVER TALK ABOUT THE ALLIANCE BUSINESS!! It was never an option… Those aliens living in a shell of filth are the main reason for the fall of earth… humanity never gets a fighting chance… Do you think a chance of truce can even happen? With this neurolink, we will be able to weaponize them, make them fight each other until their empire falls apart. And then the administrators will finally control a hold of all that's left on earth for the great rebirth of this planet…


C.S Camcorderman: i get what you mean sir…


The Operator: things are too hot for you here, so if i were you i will keep my mouth shut from what i heard. Now you get back to your job!!

INT - Uber Toilet Space Station #005 - Eternal Darkness - No sign of day and night.


Inside the Uber Base, there are several Uber toilets upgrading, some are carrying parts into a dock with some kind of a hilt of a sword. While all this happens, An Apprentice of Magnusson wandered around with a clipboard, checking if all the materials are around.


Scientist Apprentice Mutant Toilet: Thats the hilt, 3,475 out of 12,068 parts, Your doing a good job claw guy… keep it up and maybe your superior promotes you.


Laser Upgrader Uber Toilet: Thank you sir.


Scientist Apprentice Mutant Toilet: Now which ones are the necessities back on earth…


While the two discuss the list, it pans away to the space station to the moon. It fades through the dark side of the moon… It was normal and prosper untiiilllll-


Something crashes in the dark… Some kind of… Warship??


The Exterior explodes with it's satellite, causing it to release a loud frequency.


The Uber space station absorbed this frequency. It caused distress in the uber space stations across space.


A distress beep appeared on the uber toielts screens.


Uber Scientist: Impact detected… we have impact confirmed…


Some uber astronomers are stll deciphering what the impact was.


Uber Astronomer: Still unknown if its an astro toilet or another foreign alien life…


Uber Scientist: This is a serious matter, we have the royal scientist’s apprentice on board… Copy the info and send it straight to him right away…


A holographic screen printed out info in a skibidi language. It was then sent to a drive where an uber engineer takes it and exits the room.


30 minutes later, the engineer reaches the stations dock, where the Apprentice Mutant Toilet was observing the supply parts. He reached him out.


Engineer Uber Toilet: Sir… I'm sorry for the interruptions but you need to see this…


The scientist inserts the drive in his watch and views the info, he was shocked to see an impact signal on the moon.


Apprentice Mutant Toilet: This is not just a normal impact… this is crash site, the frequency signal is too high to show a passive impact, this thing. It collided with with the moon!


Engineer Uber Toilet: Collision course?? This is a big news, we have to inform the whole empire about this and act before something happens in the crash site.


Apprentice Mutant Toilet: I had to inform chief about this right now… give me a sec im def sending this info to mr. Magnusson right away…


INT - Toilet Empire Territory


Magnusson gets a message from his apprentice, he gets shocked of the info.


It then cuts to his mech arriving in toilet emperor's throne. Toilet emperor is annoyed by his arrival. Magnusson bows to him.


Toilet Emperor: What are you doing in this ungodly hour… I haven't even got my daily light therapy yet!


Magnusson: Your highness my apologies for arriving in an unfaithful time, but you might wanna hear this. A designation top secret message from our uber friends in space tells us an unidentified object went to a collision course with the moon. It had an unusual signal and we believe it's an astro warship.


Toilet Emperor: Well then, it's a good news. That pesky dolonos must have requested it to invade a part of the earth and failed. I appreciate the ubers for gunning down those astro fools.


Magnusson: your highness, the ubers done zero interference for the crash site, it was on the dark side of the moon, a place Uber Toilets never wandered yet.


Toilet Emperor: Well then, those astros are not as intelligent and innovative as I thought… Send a retrieval team to the crash site, i think the skibidi federation is on to it as well, i fear their faction is unpredictable this time… Those astro samples must be rarer and powerful to rise our might. we need to get to the moon.


INT - Uber Toilet Space Station #005 - Eternal Darkness - No sign of day and night.


Some uber scientists and astronomers gathered around in the space station and talked about the orders of the emperor.


Uber Scientist: We gathered here to talk about an important matter. Our Highness Toilet Emperor has ordered us to retrieve the crash remains before the skibidi federation does.


Uber Astronomer: Sir, their technology is still scarce, it would take atleast 3-7 months before they get there… we have an upper hand.


Uber Scientist: And that's what I needed to hear… I command the astronomers here to perform the operation… we're going to the moon…


Some uber toilets have prepared for the journey to moon. The Scientist Apprentice was given a space suit to join. It then cuts to an uber spaceship igniting and exiting the space station.


Some uber scientists watch the rocket venture to the other side of the moon, soon enough they reached the dark side of it and lands though it.


The Apprentice Mutant Toilet is ready to go down the ship.


Apprentice Mutant Toilet: We have landed sir… I am at the foot of the ladder. And step of the land now… Thats one small step for toiletkind, i wonder why you guys didnt invent legs.


Astronomer Uber Toilet: Good job Mr apprentice!! You and your team can now begin your journey… we just got an unfortunate news for you sir…


Apprentice Mutant Toilet: What is it sir?


Astronomer Uber Toilet: Unfortunately since we provided the only size you have which is earth space suit, you have 45 minutes of air time… And you may not have much on the expedition…


Apprentice Mutant Toilet: Its okay, this is enough for a trip…


Astronomer Uber Toilet: we wish you goodluck on this… You got th-


Signal interruption…


Apprentice Mutant Toilet: Sir?? Sir?? They should really put satellites here… This place is huge, I should've brought a flag in space if i knew im going here… 


The mutant leaps on the moon, 


Apprentice Mutant Toilet: Guys… we have to go now…


Two smaller spaceship uber Toilet gets out of the pod, they nod to him. The Apprentice Mutant grabs onto one of them and they flew through the place until they found the crash site.


Apprentice Mutant Toilet: Holy skibidi… that thing is huge…


They finally arrived in the crash site, they stopped on what supposed to be the entrance. The apprentice landed on the ground. He finds a broke wall that has collapsing moon dust flowing inside, he slides down with some of the spaceship ubers following by.

I was just sitting in the living room when it randomly starts smoking (nothing touched it or got on it) and crackling and got very hot. 

I moved it outside, the smoking has stopped but it’s still warm. 

Wondering how I would dispose of this? I know where to take batteries for disposal but I’m scared it would catch fire or explode in the car during transport, or once I drop it off

Let me start by saying, there should be some sort of special license required to do any kind of counted crafting on a night shift. It was an issue back in my amigurumi phase, I don't know why I thought cross stitch would be any better (that's the fun part - I'm a masochist who knew it wouldn't).

You'd think with my youthful eyes, this wouldn't be an issue (she says as she peers down her nose through magnified progressive lenses).

At this point, I think I've spent more time frogging and recounting than I have actually stitching. Now my brain is hugging it's knees at the bottom of the proverbial shower repeating the phrase ""I do this to relax"".

Doesn’t matter if its just coffee, food, or something expensive. If para sakin ako bumibili I always find myself on the verge of a panic attack and feel so so very guilty after.  I usually think why did I buy this for myself na hindi ko naman kailangan, when there are other more important things to spend on. Or dapat sa parents ko nlng ginastos ito. I remember last week I was thinking whether I should eat dinner or sleep it off to save money lol. 

Whenever I spend for my parents kahit anong amount pa yan I’m alright with it, if directed towards me doon lng tlaga ako nagpapanic. 

Context:  I’m an only child to lower middle class (or upper poor?) family, and my parents fully rely on me for support and money (mom is housewife, dad stopped working due to old age). I earn 16k a month (fresh grad, RN) but may minor sidelines naman ako to tide things over. Sa awa ni Lord, I have leftovers to save and can treat my parents and me at times despite the circumstances. Will add here that my parents never pressured/conditioned me to prioritize them. They always encouraged me na unahin sarili ko, and not to mind them (as if kaya ng konsensya ko 😭) 

 Is anyone experiencing the same as me? How do you cope or what do you do to combat it? Or just your thoughts in general. I know this is probably because of my financial upbringing and the fact that at a young age I had to be very conscious of money. At this point it’s very tiring to think if I deserve to eat or do I deserve this drink or do I deserve to spend anything for myself when I could allocate this somewhere else instead.

Now I wasn't entirely sure of this, and have been taking time to do some research; I found a battery that SLPs administer and, well, I score very high on it.

Fast-forward to just this morning, and the previous night, I had a cup of Jasmine Green Tea.  My throat was dryyyy.  -- What was weird though is that, as a symptom of my LPR, my mucus lining is rather thick, and is one of the things that causes that wretched, constant ""tickle"" below my Adam's apple.

Recently, I was reading this, ""Green tea contains less caffeine than coffee and black tea, but it also has 2 other methylxanthines — theobromine and theophylline.""

I need help narrowing down what all this means because, aside from occasional gagging/choking fits (which is one of the things why I scored so high on the battery aforementioned...), I don't really have a huge symptomatology -- just the ""lump in my throat"", hard time swallowing, some trigger foods exacerbating my mucus build up, and the preceding symptoms...

I (28F) started my current job 5 months ago and was really excited because it paid me much more than my last job, and I’m currently trying to pay off some CC debt and also just save money for the future. It’s not a dream job (general admin work) but it’s been doable. I notice my bosses can be a bit passive aggressive when I make minor errors and it really gets to me. 

The other week I got a stomach flu the morning of a work event. I was there to support my manager for his event (which is to just make sure the coffee order arrives on time) so I messaged him saying I’ll be a little late and he responded saying if I’m not well it’s okay to stay home. I went to work anyways and long story short our boss was sassy towards me and asked me to “step up”. I haven’t taken a day off except the short vacation I took when I started which was agreed upon. I’m starting to get a sore throat and migraines and I’m too afraid to ask for a day off or a day to work from home because I have to come in for another work event till Saturday. I also can’t afford to leave this job because it pays well and I’m still living paycheck to paycheck. It’s honestly not the work that’s hard or is difficult to do, it’s just my bosses who can be really grouchy and passive aggressive. 

Worst part is the boss I did like left last week and we had a final meeting where she mentioned how it can be hard to work with the other two. How can I power through and not let this get to me? Is every job like this?? ",3,1742929598.0,AskWomenOver30,2,0.8,False

Could it be the motherboard, or cpu? Or would this be a fault of the display or display cables?


Without any drivers installed, it doesn't glitch at all. With the latest drivers installed, it is almost unusable because the screen glitches very rapidly and flickers black for 0.5 seconds l, every other second. (I don't have any video of it happening, I've got some work to do and I need to use my laptop tonight).

I've tried a few old graphics drivers. The driver (dated 2022) listed on my laptop manufacturer's website make it as bad as the newest drivers, the oldest driver available on Intel's website (dated late December 2024) isn't as bad as the newest driver, and the current driver I'm using is the oldest driver Intel lists for my processor (dated early December 2024. the link is dead on their website, so I had to download it from somewhere else) and it works the best but it still sometimes glitches (no black flicking though, so it's usable for now).

I made a screen recording when the glitching appeared on screen, but it didn't appear in the screen recording. So I thought it would be a screen issue, but the glitching doesn't happen at all in the BIOS or when booting the computer (this is the case for all of the drivers). Wouldn't it also occur in the bios if the screen had issues?

I'm not really sure what to do. I can't use no drivers since uninstalling the drivers makes it so that the screen is at 100% brightness and doesn't allow the brightness to be reduced or night mode to be enabled.

Before this started happening, the hinge that connects the screen to the body became loose because the hinge is screwed into a plastic tray (which holds the motherboard, and is then screwed into the metal outer shell) and I must have been too rough with it because there was broken plastic bits all around the area that the hitch sits (I've never dropped the laptop or did serious damage to it though, so idk how it happened) . I tried to fix it myself because I didn't want to pay someone to replace the entire tray, so I got the bits that the hinge screws were threaded to (which just sat inside the tray, maybe that's why they broke easily) and super glued them to the unbroken parts of the plastic tray that the motherboard sits in, then screwed the hinge back in and super glued the screws in place (I know, dumb idea, but my laptop was sitting on my coffee table for over 2 weeks and I really needed it for the next day). I used gorilla glue, so it shouldn't be electrically conductive, but maybe that could be the issue. I'm hoping to not take out the motherboard and break the superglue and redo it properly since I have many exams going on for the next month.

Also, the wifi cable was routed right beside the hinge, so windows didn't detect it for a week before I fixed it, and started working again after I  fixed the hinge. Idk if that is important though.

It's an MSI laptop, it has an Intel i5-1135G7 with Intel Iris Xe integrated graphics (no discrete GPU). The operating system is windows 11 Home 24H2.

In short - her aunt, the owner, had an idea about turning a lot of the unused space into a coffee shop. Lots of helpful people essentially told me I might as well withdraw a year's income in cash and burn it. 

But someone did ask ""is there anything else you could utilise the space for?"" and it got me thinking.

There's two, possibly three rooms totally unused of a decent size. 

As photography is my thing (and coffee most certainly isn't), I'm wondering about the possibility of turning one room into a photography studio, and another into a dance studio. The third slightly smaller room could be turned into something else, perhaps a smaller studio or editing space, open to ideas.

There's a few similar spaces in the city (Manchester, UK) but way less than I thought there'd be, and looking at their websites, they're very busy with bookings. One place I cannot seem to find any availability for all of the coming month.

I mainly do events (dance music, DJs, festivals, etc) but wouldn't mind getting into studio stuff, and in this instance it would be for other photographers to hire. Most places simply seem to provide backdrop, lighting, and that's about it. Not expensive to set up.

The city is full of creatives, spaces like this don't seem plentiful, rent is basically free as family rent it long-term anyway. 

So I'm wondering, as in my previous thread, if people have experience with running a studio, what kind of things to expect, is demand there? 

It seems like a very risk-free business idea as there's very little investment needed, especially with the space already there.

But like with the coffee shop idea, I'm happy to be told if this just won't work. ",0,1742929515.0,photography,16,0.5,False

The program's website had a wealth of materials available for download, including summaries of the video segments being shown for each night in the series, plus workbook content.

I downloaded all of it, and ran it through ChatGPT, using the epistles of Paul (Galatians, Ephesians, Colossians, and Philippians) as the gold standard for transformative teaching.  I asked ChatGPT to rate the course content against this standard - and it told me exactly what my take had been the first night.

—
As the day wore on, Avon couldn't shake the unease that had settled in her chest. Tyler had left for work not long after mentioning Jennifer, and now the house felt unbearably quiet. She paced the living room, her thoughts racing as she tried to make sense of what she had just learned. Was she being paranoid? Was she reading too much into this? She wanted to believe that it was nothing, that Tyler mentioning Jennifer was just a normal part of his workday, but the nagging voice in the back of her mind told her otherwise. Avon found herself sitting on the couch, staring blankly at her phone. She hadn't planned on doing this—hadn't wanted to become the kind of person who snooped through her husband's things—but the need for answers was becoming
overwhelming.
With shaky hands, she unlocked her phone and pulled up her search engine. She typed in the name ""Jennifer Lar"" and held her breath, waiting for the results to load.
There were a few hits—social media profiles, a LinkedIn page—but nothing particularly alarming. Jennifer Lar, marketing executive, recently joined Tyler's firm. Avon clicked through the pages, trying to learn more about her, but there was little information beyond her professional credentials. Still, seeing her face—a polished headshot with perfectly styled hair and a confident smile—made something twist inside her. This woman was real. She wasn't just a name on a screen anymore. Avon's hands trembled as she stared at the screen. Was this really happening? Was she sitting here, in her own home, searching for information on a woman her husband worked with? A woman whose name seemed to be creeping into their life in ways Avon couldn't quite understand? She hated how insecure she felt, hated the way her mind jumped to the worst conclusions. But the pieces were starting to come together, and they painted a picture she didn't want to see.
With a sigh, Avon tossed her phone onto the couch and stood up, pacing the room again. She needed to calm down. This was all in her head, right? Tyler had always been loyal, always been the kind of man who would never hurt her. But then again, hadn't she said the same thing months ago, before the late nights, before the secretive phone calls, before... Jennifer?
That evening, Tyler came home later than usual. Avon had already put the twins to bed, and she sat at the kitchen table, nursing a cup of tea as she waited for him. The tension in her chest had grown throughout the day, building with every passing hour. She needed to talk to him, needed to ask him about Jennifer and all the things he hadn't been telling her. But now that he was home, the words seemed stuck in her throat. Tyler entered the kitchen, looking as tired as ever. He loosened his tie and gave her a small smile, though it didn't quite reach his eyes. ""Hey. Sorry I'm late. It's been one of those days.""
Avon nodded, her fingers tightening around the mug. ""It's fine. The kids are already asleep."" He sighed, rubbing the back of his neck. ""I hate that I keep missing bedtime. I'll make it up to them this weekend.""
Avon watched him carefully, her mind spinning. Now was the time. She had to ask. She had to know.
""Tyler,"" she began, her voice quiet but steady. ""Can we talk?""
He looked at her, his expression unreadable. ""Of course. What's going on?""
Avon took a deep breath, trying to keep her voice calm. ""It's about Jennifer Lar.""
Tyler's expression flickered—just for a moment, but enough for Avon to notice. His gaze shifted slightly, and she could see the tension in his posture.
""What about her?"" he asked, his tone neutral. ""I just... I didn't know you were working with her so closely,"" Avon said, choosing her words carefully. ""You never mentioned her before."" Tyler shrugged, though the movement seemed forced. ""She's new. It's not a big deal.""
But it felt like a big deal. It felt like everything. Avon bit her lip, trying to push past the lump in her throat. ""Tyler, I've noticed... things. You've been distant, and you've been working late more often. And now this. I just need to know... is there something going on?""
The silence that followed was deafening. Tyler stared at her, his jaw clenched, and for a moment, Avon thought she saw a flash of guilt in his eyes. But then, he shook his head, his expression hardening.
""Avon, there's nothing going on,"" he said, his voice firm. ""Jennifer is just a colleague. That's it."" Avon wanted to believe him. She wanted to believe that this was all just a misunderstanding, that the distance between them was just a phase. But the doubt had taken root, and no matter how much she tried to push it away, it wouldn't leave her.
""Okay,"" she whispered, though her heart wasn't convinced.
Tyler didn't say anything else. He simply pecked her on the forehead, murmuring something about needing to shower before bed. As he disappeared down the hallway, Avon sat there, staring into her mug, her heart heavy with the weight of unspoken truths.
The name Jennifer Lar echoed in her mind, a reminder that the cracks in their marriage were growing deeper. And she wasn't sure if she had the strength to hold
We were together much longer.
The darkness pressed heavily around Avon as she lay in bed, staring up at the ceiling. The quiet hum of the heater filled the room, but it did nothing to drown out the noise in her mind. She had been awake for hours, her eyes wide open in the dim light of the bedroom, her thoughts a tangled mess that she couldn't seem to unravel.
Tyler lay beside her, his soft, rhythmic breathing the only sound cutting through the suffocating silence. He had fallen asleep quickly, just like every other night. Meanwhile, Avon's thoughts churned, her heart beating far too fast for someone lying still.
Jennifer Lar. The name had taken up permanent residence in her mind. No matter how much she tried to push it away, it always came back, gnawing at her like a persistent itch she couldn't scratch.
Her fingers curled into the bedsheet, gripping it tightly as her thoughts raced. Tyler had been distant for months now, and the more she replayed their conversations, the more it all started to make sense. The late nights, the phone calls he stepped away for, the lingering smell of unfamiliar perfume—all signs that pointed to something Avon was too afraid to confront. She turned her head slightly to look at Tyler, his face barely visible in the faint moonlight filtering through the curtains. He looked peaceful in his sleep, as though the weight of the world wasn't sitting on his shoulders. But that was the problem, wasn't it? The weight was on her shoulders. It was her mind that was filled with doubt and suspicion. Avon sighed softly, careful not to wake him as she rolled onto her back again. Her chest felt tight, constricted, as if every breath she took required too much effort. She wanted to confront him. She wanted to demand answers, to ask him
point-blank if he was having an affair with Jennifer. But every time she opened her mouth to speak, the words got stuck, lodged in her throat by the fear of what his answer might be.
What if he said yes?
The thought sent a cold shiver down her spine. She had imagined this scenario a hundred times in her mind—how she would ask him, how he would react, and what he might say. But none of her imaginings had ever given her the courage to actually go through with it.
The truth was, she was terrified. Terrified that the life they had built together was a lie. Terrified that if she confronted him, she might lose everything. Their home, their family, the life she had worked so hard to create. How could she face that possibility? How could she risk everything on a suspicion, even one that felt so real?
Tyler shifted beside her, rolling over in his sleep. His hand brushed against hers for a brief moment, and she felt a surge of pain in her chest. How long had it been since they had held hands? Since they had touched in any way that felt meaningful? It wasn't just the physical distance between them—it was the emotional chasm that had grown wider with each passing day. Avon could feel it in the way Tyler looked at her, in the way he spoke to her, in the way he had become more of a stranger than the man she had once known.
She closed her eyes, hoping that sleep might come if she just willed it hard enough. But her mind refused to quiet down, the storm of thoughts swirling faster and faster.
Her phone, lying on the bedside table, buzzed softly, pulling her back to the present. Avon glanced at the clock—2:14 a.m. Who would be messaging her at this hour? She reached for the phone, her heart pounding, and unlocked it to find a message from her best friend, Claire.
Can't sleep. You up?
Avon stared at the message for a moment before typing a quick response.
Yeah. Same here.
Within seconds, another message popped up. What's going on? Want to talk?
Avon hesitated. She hadn't told Claire about Jennifer Lar yet. She hadn't told anyone. Admitting it out loud made it too real, and once the words were spoken, she couldn't take them back. But she needed to talk to someone. The loneliness was becoming unbearable, and Claire was the one person she trusted with her darkest thoughts. It's Tyler. I think... I think he's seeing someone else.
She hit send before she could second-guess herself, her heart racing as she waited for Claire's reply. It came quickly.
Oh my God, Avon. What makes you think that? Avon bit her lip, her fingers trembling as she typed out her response.
There's this woman at his work. Jennifer Lar. He's been acting so distant, coming home late, and I've seen her name on his phone a few times. I don't know what to think, but it feels wrong.
Her phone buzzed again almost immediately. You need to talk to him, Avon. You can't keep this bottled up. You deserve answers.
Avon knew Claire was right. She did deserve answers. But the thought of confronting Tyler filled her with dread. She wasn't ready to face the possibility that their marriage might already be over.
I know, Avon typed back. I just... I don't know how to bring it up. What if I'm wrong? What if it's all in my head?
Claire's response was firm, but kind.
And what if you're right? You need to know. You can't live like this—doubting him, doubting yourself. You've been carrying this alone for too long.
Avon's chest tightened at the truth in her friend's words. She had been carrying this alone, and it was slowly eating away at her. The sleepless nights, the constant anxiety, the gnawing feeling that something was terribly wrong.
She glanced at Tyler again, watching the steady rise and fall of his chest as he slept beside her. How could he sleep so peacefully when she was unravelling? Did he even realise what his distance was doing to her? Or worse, did he not care? I'll talk to him, Avon typed, though she wasn't sure she believed her own words. *Just not tonight. The next morning, Avon felt the weight of another sleepless night pressing down on her. She had barely gotten two hours of rest, and now she was dragging herself through the motions of the day, trying to keep up with the twins as they prepared for school.
Lila and Luke, full of energy as always, chattered excitedly about their upcoming field trip while they ate breakfast. Avon smiled at them, though her mind was elsewhere, trapped in the endless cycle of doubt and suspicion that had become her new reality.
Tyler sat across from her at the kitchen table, sipping his coffee and scrolling through his phone. The sight of him so absorbed in his own world made something tighten in Avon's chest. How could he be so disconnected? How could he sit there, day after day, acting like everything was fine when she felt like she was drowning?
""Tyler,"" she said quietly, her voice barely audible over the sound of the kids talking.
He glanced up from his phone, his expression unreadable. ""Yeah?""
Avon hesitated, her heart pounding. This was it. She could bring it up now. She could ask him, confront him, finally get the answers she so desperately needed. But as she opened her mouth to speak, the words got stuck again, her throat closing up with fear.
""I... I'll pick up the kids from school today,"" she said instead, her voice trembling slightly.
Tyler nodded, already looking back at his phone. ""Sure. I've got meetings all afternoon anyway."" Avon stared at him, willing herself to say more, to ask him about Jennifer, to ask him about the late nights and the distance between them. But the fear of what his answer might be was too strong, and once again, she found herself retreating. The rest of the morning passed in a blur, with Tyler leaving for work and the twins heading off to school. Avon stood by the kitchen window, watching the world outside continue on as if nothing was wrong. But inside, she felt like she was slowly unravelling, piece by piece.
That night, as she lay awake once more, Avon realised something: this couldn't go on. The sleepless nights, the endless doubt, the fear that was consuming her—it was all too much. She couldn't keep living like this, stuck in limbo, too afraid to confront the truth but too broken to ignore it.

https://preview.redd.it/s5gkhpfofs061.jpg?width=2064&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c175eb97f2ac90ce1058d2578c321ac507fab89f

Starting the keto diet can be a little overwhelming-the high-fat, low-carb diet, known for its dramatic weight loss results, requires an overhaul of most people's typical shopping lists. That means saying goodbye to some of the easy items you might keep on hand for lazy nights (we're talking to you, quick-cooking rice and frozen french fries), and hello to some slightly more perishable foods that are higher in fat and protein like meat and full-fat dairy. 

But before you go filling your grocery cart with bacon and cheese galore, know that you'll want to opt for good-for-you sources of unsaturated fat and protein-like fish and avocado, instead, says Lyssie Lakatos, RDN, of the Nutrition Twins. ""Since this diet is primarily coming from fat, choosing healthy sources of fat is important,"" she says. So, healthy fat = good; protein = good; but what about everything else? Don't freak-while, yes, tons of stuff is off-limits on the keto diet, there are plenty of yummy things you can eat. To help, a few dietitians weighed in on what they'd put on their keto diet grocery shopping list-so all you really have to do is save it and go to the store.  But first. . . some items to take off your list

There are a few aisles you can skip (the cookie aisle is probably one of them) if you're committing to keto. Here are the non-keto-friendly items you will no longer need to stock your fridge and pantry with. 

Pasta and other grains When you're cutting carbs on keto, pasta, rice, and noodles have to be the first to go (unfortunately). Your local grocery store might have a special health foods section where you can find low-carb or gluten-free pastas and noodles, though. 

Starchy veggiesPotatoes are off limits, and so are other starchy, high-carb vegetables like carrots, believe it or not. Colorful, leafy greens are going to be key staples to add to your basket or cart. 

High-sugar fruitsWhile fruit is something that is usually recommended for a healthy, balanced diet, the keto diet restricts some fruit, says Marisa Moore, MBA, RDN, LD.  Some fruits, like apples, bananas, and pears, are higher in carbs, which break down into sugars, so they're not typically part of a keto eating plan. 

LegumesIf you eat vegan or vegetarian, certain legumes, like beans, lentils, and chickpeas, might be a regular part of your diet for extra protein. On keto, though, they're too high in carbs and too low in fat to be compliant. 

Sugary foodsYou're going to want to bypass any aisle that includes candy, doughnuts, snack cakes, and cookies, as the sugars in any processed sweets should be avoided on the keto diet. Your keto-friendly grocery list

Ok, now that we've gotten the bad news out of the way, here are all the yummy items you can stock up on when you're following a keto diet. There's plenty to be excited about putting in your cart!

Low-carb veggies

Not all vegetables are created equal for keto followers. High-carb veggies are a no-go. Instead, opt for low-carb options like cauliflower, broccoli, spinach, bell pepper, celery, cucumber, eggplant, and asparagus, says Pegah Jalali, RD, a nutritionist with Middleberg Nutrition. 

Frozen veggies are cool, too. Sydney Greene, RD, also of Middleberg Nutrition, recommends frozen cauliflower in particular. ""It's very low carb yet high in fiber and vitamin C. Use cauliflower in place of bananas for a creamy smoothie without the extra carbohydrates,"" Greene says. 

Avocados

Tammy Lakatos Shames, RDN, of Nutrition Twins, describes avocados as one of the very best keto foods, jam-packed with both nutrients and healthy fats. ""I like to have them with some hemp or flax seeds sprinkled on top and some parmesan cheese,"" says Jalali.  

Berries 

Raspberries are a perfect sweet treat for people on the keto diet, since they're the fruit with the fewest carbs, says Jalali-though blueberries and blackberries are great, too. Blackberries and raspberries specifically are a solid option because they contain 8 grams of fiber per cup, too, Moore adds. Salad greens

Pre-washed greens, like spinach, kale and arugula, are a huge timesaver. ""Having greens on hand makes it super easy to throw together a quick salad or add some quick nutrients-folate, vitamin C, fiber, magnesium-to your proteins,"" says Greene. 

For a quick, keto-friendly breakfast, Greene suggests scrambling two whole eggs and a handful of spinach to get a good serving of healthy fat, protein, and fiber. 

Grass-fed beef and organic chicken

Keep grass-fed beef and lamb, along with organic chicken, on hand, recommends Jalali. ""Our clients particularly love Applegate's Great Organic Uncured Beef Hot Dog,"" says Shames-they're non-GMO and made with grass-fed beef, sans nitrates and preservatives. 

Bone broth

Another option? Sip your meat-based protein. Greene loves Bonafide Provisions Bone Broth, which uses bones from grass-fed cows. ""The amino acids found in the broth support a healthy gut,"" says Greene. Tuna, salmon, or sardines (fresh or canned)

If you opt for fresh fish, grill, bake, or pan-fry it in a healthy oil (olive or avocado) and serve with a low-carb veggie like broccoli or cauliflower rice. 

If you choose canned, mix it with mayo and serve over greens, suggests Jalali. For a simple keto lunch, Greene suggests combining a can of tuna with half an avocado in a collard green wrap. 

Cheese

Go for grass-fed, organic, and full-fat options in the dairy aisle, recommends Jalali. For cheese, one easy-to-find option-readily available at groceries and convenience stores alike-is Organic Valley's full fat cheese. ""It fits in the keto diet perfectly,"" says Lakatos. Always read the nutrition info before purchasing pre-shredded cheeses, cautions Jalali, who says they sometimes contain a stabilizer that adds carbs-so just make sure your shredded cheese has zero grams of carbs. 

Greek yogurt and sour cream

These can be used interchangeably on the keto diet, as they all have similar amounts of carbs-Greek yogurt has five grams per serving and sour cream has seven. Just make sure they're plain options-added flavors also add carbs. 

Quark

Quark is a German food that's somewhere in between yogurt and cheese in flavor and consistency-you can add it to smoothies, or use it as a spread or topping. ""It's rich, creamy, and a favorite among our clients who are keto followers,"" says Lakatos. 

Eggs

If you're on a keto diet, opt for Eggland's Best Eggs, says Lakatos. ""They have double the omega-3s and six times the vitamin D of other eggs, thanks to their all-vegetarian hen feed which provides high-quality, keto-friendly nutrients. ""

Moore suggests meal prepping hard boiled eggs and keeping them in the fridge throughout the week for easy on-the-go breakfasts. If properly refrigerated and not cracked, they'll last for 7 days in the fridge. 

Nut milks

Milk can actually have a good amount of carbs, so nut milk is a good alternative on the keto diet, says Lakatos. Unsweetened coconut, hemp, and almond milks in particular are good options, as they contain no carbs and more than four grams of fat-a perfect combo for keto dieters. Almond milk specifically is versatile for a variety of recipes, like a chia seed pudding or a breakfast smoothie, says Moore. ""Simply blend frozen berries with leafy greens and plenty of almond milk for a frosty drink in less than five minutes,"" Moore suggests. 

Avocado, olive, hazelnut, and coconut oil

The keto diet is all about fat, so clearly all healthy oils are welcome on this keto grocery list. Cooking food in the oils is one thing-but you can also amp up your fat intake by drizzling some oil on your cooked meal, as well. 

Grass-fed ghee

Ghee, like the oils above, is a pure fat, which means its free from carbs or protein, says Jalali. ""Ketogenic diets are more than 60 percent fat so having pure fats for all meals helps keep you on track,"" she says. If you can't find ghee, you can also use butter. 

Seaweed

This low-carb snack has just one gram of carbs, and is full of iodine, which supports a healthy thyroid, says Greene. Some even come in individual grab-and-go packets so you can store them in your desk at work or in your purse. 

Olives

You can add olives to salad or have them as an on-the-go snack. ""We find these to be a lifesaver for our keto clients,"" says Shames. Olives offer a healthy monounsaturated source of fat; some even come in different flavors (like taco or sriracha). Pistachios 

Shames recommends single-serving packages of pistachios, too. ""Ninety percent of the fats found in pistachios are the better-for-you mono- and polyunsaturated type,"" says Shames. ""Plus, pistachios provide a good source of plant protein and fiber for a trio that can help to keep you fuller longer. ""

Almonds

Another nut that's high in fiber, healthy fat, and protein is almonds. Moore always recommends them as snacks for clients who are constantly busy and need snacks to keep them satiated throughout the day. You can easily pack single-serve packages ahead of time. 

Nutritional yeast

Nutritional yeast provides B12, a nutrient that many of us-especially vegans and vegetarians-just don't get enough of. It's also a source of protein without many carbs at all, says Lakatos. 

""Keto followers can sprinkle it on their meals for a cheesy flavor and they often use it to make keto-friendly breads and tortillas,"" says Lakatos. 

Chia seeds and flax seeds

You can use these seeds to coat meats, include them in bake goods, or make keto-friendly oatmeal and pudding, says Jalali. These pantry items are high in fiber, but low in carbs. 

Healthy frozen foods

Added items like frozen cauliflower pizza and frozen frittatas can make eating keo simple on mornings and nights when you're strapped for time. Nora Minno, an RD in New York City, loves this pizza, which contains only 16 grams of carbs for the whole pie.  Tofu

""Tofu is a great way to add plant-based protein into a diet that is typically heavy in animal protein and fat,"" says Minno. ""A 3-oz serving contains 80 calories, 4 grams of fat, 9 grams of protein and only 3 grams of carbs. You'll also be getting important micronutrients like calcium, iron, and potassium. ""

Low-carb pasta alternatives

""Shiratake noodles are a great low-carb pasta alternative with only 2 grams of carbs and 0 calories per bag,"" says Minno. 

Nut butter

A high-quality nut butter is a great keto snack, topping for flax crackers, and ingredient for keto fat bombs and desserts, says Lara Clevenger, RD and founder of The Keto Queens. 

Grass-fed beef tallow

Beef tallow is rich in omega 3 and CLA and is a ""high quality saturated fat which has a high smoke point and is great for cooking,"" says Clevenger. 

Chocolate

Yes, you can totally add chocolate to your shopping cart on the keto diet! Clevenger recommends Choc Zero. ""It's sugar-free chocolate, non-gmo, and contains no sugar alcohols or soy lecithin. It's not super bitter like some chocolate bars and tastes great and has a very good texture,"" she says. 

Keto-approved condiments

One of the trickiest things to shop for while keto? Dressings and condiments. Clevenger recommends low-sugar ketchup and BBQ sauce from Alterna Sweets. ""These sauces taste amazing and they all contain only 1 gram net carb per tablespoon,"" she says. As for salad dressing? Clevenger reaches for Primal Kitchen brand. ""These are sugar-free and keto-certified. ""Alternative flours

""Almond flour is one of my favorite baking ingredients,"" Moore says. It's also one of the most common keto-friendly, gluten-free, alternative flours.  ""The almonds provide satiating fiber and protein plus healthy fats,"" Moore adds.  She recommends it for making pie crusts and baking cookies and muffins. 

Coconut flour is another low-carb flour alternative that Moore suggests adding to your pantry. However, keep in mind that you can't just substitute the same amount in a recipe that calls for regular four. ""Because it is highly absorbent, you'll likely need to add more liquid to baked goods that use coconut flour,"" Moore says. 

Keto-friendly sweeteners

For a natural sugar substitute that's keto-compliant, consider stocking up on monk fruit, says Moore. Whether you're baking or looking to sweeten up your coffee, monk fruit is an option that won't take you out of ketosis. Erythritol is another common keto-friendly sugar substitute. Again, you'll want to use in keto-specific recipes since you can't swap in the same amount for a recipe that calls for sugar. 

Keto protein bars

To keep you full during the day, try a keto protein or energy bar that's high in healthy fats (like nuts and oils like avocado oil) and protein, but low in carbs. Keto Bar is a great option-they make a delicious chocolate peanut butter flavor. 

Keto granolas

You won't be able to buy regular cereals, as they'll be too high in carbs, but low-carb or grain-free, low sugar granolas like Lakanto Healthy Quick Breakfast Granola or Lark Ellen Farm Granola are a better choice. You can add milk to them or eat them with yogurt and breakfast is solved.",1,1742929232.0,HealthyZapper,0,1.0,False

No need to answer because the answer is always the same--**-another brewery or coffee shop nobody sent a Bat-Signal for**.

I’m out here dodging hops and espresso shots like it’s the Matrix, just tryna find something to do in this city that seems to get more and more boring by the day.

Did we vote on this, and I missed the memo? I’d kill for a spot that’s not tryna sell me a $15 stout or a latte with my name misspelled on it—like, gimme a new dive bar with a jukebox or a new rooftop bar that isn't cosplaying as fine dining -- Maybe a new golf simulator business/bar or an updated theatre (sorry valley view, you are WAY past your prime).

We’re one craft beer and a large mural away from turning into Portland’s weird cousin.

Are we even capable of attracting/hosting a legitimate thriving business anymore? Or is this lackluster social scene and ever-growing granola culture devoid of white-collar work the city's destiny?

Who’s with me? Or am I just the lone cat in a sea of craft beer bros and granola being pessimistic?

I try to be positive about this city...I really do. But it seems like every year, I am just driving past more coffee shops and breweries while I weave in and out of endless panhandlers standing in front of ""No Begging"" signs.",8,1742928929.0,roanoke,36,0.55,False

We matched on a dating app, had a video call which flowed great, lasted over an hour. Then we were texting daily and discovering more and more similarities in our interests, upbringings etc and it honestly felt like he was the one. We had another video call too which lasted almost 1.5 hours. He couldnt meet for a month due to genuine reasons (I am sure of it) and this talking stage really grew on me. I started to believe he was the one and getting ahead of myself before meeting him.

Then the first date happened, was 2.5 hours long we met over coffee and went for a walk- it was definitely good, we had good conversation and laughs, teased each other, hit some deeper topics and other lighter topics re common interests. He even teased me about me something as we said bye. 

I came out a little unsure though- because I had built him up in my head over the month of talking and there was bound to be a difference between expectations v reality… I decided I wanted to see him again to get to know him more so I asked if he was up to meet again. He said he enjoyed getting to know me etc but doesn’t think it’ll work. 

Its been a couple of weeks since then but I still cant forget him. He seemed pretty much everything I wanted in my partner (though I appreciate I didnt know him well enough to know this for sure). We def would have been great friends if nothing more.

now even though I’m matching with other people and been on one date so far, I just cant help but compare everyone to him and how effortless it felt getting to know him. 

He didnt give me any reason to hate him and as I got too far ahead in my head, makes it harder for me to get over him.

How do I stop comparing new dates to him?
How do I genuinely show an interest in new people?
How do I stop thinking of ways to get him back in my life even as a friend?
How do I bring my original happy self to the dating landscape as I feel defeated and low and hopeless about dating and finding love?

Day 2: unlimited coffee bar, shopping at Isetan, national park, shibuya sky 

Day 3: Nakamise shopping street, Senso-ji temple, Ginza shopping district 

For Kyoto I got nothing so far besides temples? I’d really appreciate some refs for restaurants, bakeries, patisseries, places to go sight see and activities to do etc.

Could it be the motherboard, or cpu? Or would this be a fault of the display or display cables?


Without any drivers installed, it doesn't glitch at all. With the latest drivers installed, it is almost unusable because the screen glitches very rapidly and flickers black for 0.5 seconds l, every other second. (I don't have any video of it happening, I've got some work to do and I need to use my laptop tonight).

I've tried a few old graphics drivers. The driver (dated 2022) listed on my laptop manufacturer's website make it as bad as the newest drivers, the oldest driver available on Intel's website (dated late December 2024) isn't as bad as the newest driver, and the current driver I'm using is the oldest driver Intel lists for my processor (dated early December 2024. the link is dead on their website, so I had to download it from somewhere else) and it works the best but it still sometimes glitches (no black flicking though, so it's usable for now).

I made a screen recording when the glitching appeared on screen, but it didn't appear in the screen recording. So I thought it would be a screen issue, but the glitching doesn't happen at all in the BIOS or when booting the computer (this is the case for all of the drivers). Wouldn't it also occur in the bios if the screen had issues?

I'm not really sure what to do. I can't use no drivers since uninstalling the drivers makes it so that the screen is at 100% brightness and doesn't allow the brightness to be reduced or night mode to be enabled.

Before this started happening, the hinge that connects the screen to the body became loose because the hinge is screwed into a plastic tray (which holds the motherboard, and is then screwed into the metal outer shell) and I must have been too rough with it because there was broken plastic bits all around the area that the hitch sits (I've never dropped the laptop or did serious damage to it though, so idk how it happened) . I tried to fix it myself because I didn't want to pay someone to replace the entire tray, so I got the bits that the hinge screws were threaded to (which just sat inside the tray, maybe that's why they broke easily) and super glued them to the unbroken parts of the plastic tray that the motherboard sits in, then screwed the hinge back in and super glued the screws in place (I know, dumb idea, but my laptop was sitting on my coffee table for over 2 weeks and I really needed it for the next day). I used gorilla glue, so it shouldn't be electrically conductive, but maybe that could be the issue. I'm hoping to not take out the motherboard and break the superglue and redo it properly since I have many exams going on for the next month.

Also, the wifi cable was routed right beside the hinge, so windows didn't detect it for a week before I fixed it, and started working again after I  fixed the hinge. Idk if that is important though.

It hummed when I touched it, vibrated like something alive. I should’ve left it there, but curiosity's a hell of a drug.

When I opened it, the air turned cold. A skeletal creature slithered out, tall and twisted, like a centipede had dressed up in a man's skin and forgotten how many legs it had. Its eyes were deep hollows that oozed smoke, and it smelled like meat left out in the sun.

""You may have one wish,"" it croaked, voice grinding like rusted metal.

I didn’t scream, I just nodded, unable to speak, trying not to gag at the slime trailing from its jaw. Then it slipped back into the box, folding in on itself like wet paper, leaving only silence.

I kept it.

It sat on a shelf in the garage, behind paint cans and old tools. Every time I saw it, my mind wandered. One wish. Anything. Cure cancer. Save the planet. Make a billion dollars. But I couldn’t pull the trigger. One wish is a terrifying thing when you know it’ll come true. What if I messed it up? What if it twisted my words? I decided to wait, think it through.

Then one day my daughter, Emily, burst into the kitchen, face glowing with excitement.

“Daddy! I made a wish!”

My blood ran cold.

“What do you mean, sweetheart?”

“I found a magic box in the garage,” she said, dancing on her toes. “There was a weird man inside, and he said I could have a wish. So I did!”

I dropped my coffee.

“What did you wish for?” My voice came out choked.

She grinned. “A unicorn!”

Before I could stop her, she ran through the sliding door into the backyard, her little feet pounding the deck. I chased after her, heart hammering, bile rising in my throat.

I saw it immediately.

It stood in the middle of the yard, sunlight filtering through the trees and glinting off its pale hide. Hooves, a long spiraled horn, flowing white mane. A perfect unicorn.

Too perfect.

Its eyes were too wide. Too wet. They blinked the wrong way. Its body shimmered like heat off asphalt, and its skin twitched in waves, like something beneath was trying to get out. Muscles shifted wrong under the surface, pulsing like maggots writhing in meat. Its tail wagged, slow and rhythmic, and I realized it wasn’t hair at all. It was a cluster of twitching tendrils.

Emily laughed, running toward it with arms outstretched.

I grabbed her before she could touch it. My hands trembled as I backed away, holding her tight, heart pounding so hard I could barely breathe.

She looked up at me, confused. “What’s wrong, Daddy? It’s just a unicorn.”

No.

Something is wiggling and writhing underneath its skin, I don't know what that thing is, but it's no fucking unicorn.

I'm 34, I've never asked a girl out nor initiated a physical relationship. Not that I've never been with girls - I've almost never been single. I'm just not the pursuing party, which never made sense to me since I think i look like an overgrown chocolate lab. I’m just incapable of taking the jump for all the normal reasons.

Here's another slightly embarrassing bit of info (please don't laugh): I'm semi-retired. I've gotten very lucky and now I'm able to spend my time doing things I like to do. Most of the time it's volunteer work shit and tutoring for sats, lsat, gmat, etc.

At one of the places I volunteer I met a woman who makes me feel like a third grader with his first real crush. She looks like Audrey Hepburn - every time I see her she wears loose blue jeans and a white t-shit tucked in, and she looks absolutely stunning. My godmother, who works in fashion, said once to my sister when she was wearing something a bit gauche that dressing simply while looking beautiful defines elegance. I get that now.

We spend each session together, joking around, teasing, gently shoving one another, finding yams that look like little old people and have them talk to each other. I felt certain that she was waiting for me to ask her out, but i still couldn’t work up the nerve. 

Finally, i just decided to do it. Could hardly get through the sentence, would you like to get a coffee sometime? because my mouth was so dry. And she did maybe the most wonderful thing that’s ever happened to me: she took my hand and led me out of the packing/kitchen area into the hall, kissed me quickly, and suggested dinner instead. 

We’re going out friday - no real plans yet, just meeting up by my building and taking it from there. Usually, this would be no big deal. But she feels like someone who could be truly important in my life, and I’m terrified of blowing it. Don’t know if i should do something casual or something extravagant. Don’t know if i should make an after-dinner plan or just figure it out. Don’t know if i should take her for drinks beforehand (I should mention that i’m pretty abstemious and only drink a few times a year). And tbh, even as i’m writing this i can feel my heart beating in my throat, so this is clearly a moment. 

Like i said, I’m no stranger to relationships, I’ve just never felt so strongly and it’s destroying all sense of proportion and rationality. Any expert suggestions about what I can do to at least make me seem somehow worthy of her will be met with enormous internet hugs and wishes that pizza gets accidentally delivered to your houses and they just tell you to keep it anyway. You deserve it!

TLDR: Met girl. Really like her. Asked her out. She said yes. Never been so nervous about going out with someone. need rational ideas of what to do and how to keep my head.",7,1742927723.0,dating_advice,3,0.77,False

I’m going to do a semester in Prague through an exchange program and I wanted to ask some must know’s about the city, the country, the culture. I know asking vague questions doesn’t elicit a lot of responses, so I will ask some specifics and you can add anything you think is important.

1. What are some good areas with good bars to go out in? I don’t like clubs and nature isn’t my thing so bars and coffee shops will be my main social activity.
2. What’s some areas I should avoid?
3. What’s the dating scene there, do people mind foreigners?
4. Can I get by with english or do I need to know a bit of Czech as well?
5. Is the international community big?
6. How much would you estimate I spend for a meal out/groceries?

Anything else that comes to mind someone should know about Prague?

Found out last week she’s resigning. She’ll be gone next week.,"I (32M) went out with a woman who we’ll call Sarah (25F) about a year and a half ago. We work in the same building, but not the same department. I was very intrigued by her from the first time I saw her. We engaged in small talk for a few months before I finally asked her out for coffee.

The date *seemed* to go well. At the end, I went in for a kiss which she fully reciprocated and we actually ended up making out for a couple minutes. After that she said we should really do it again sometime, to which I said yeah I think that’s a good idea.

I reached out a couple days later asking if she wanted to grab drinks the following weekend. She said she was “busy” and didn’t offer an alternative time. Immediately I knew something was up since she didn’t offer an alternative. I gave the situation some room to breathe and reached out a week later asking again, to which she gave the same response with no alternative. I took the hint and stopped bothering her.

So for the last year and a half I’ve had to see her at least once a week in passing. I’m always professional. I just say “sup” or give her a nod and keep walking. I don’t try to drag her into conversation and I’ve certainly never asked her why she stopped talking to me.

I found out last week she found a new job and is leaving soon. Part of me is ecstatic because I’m tired of seeing her, but part of me is extremely sad because now it means I really have to move on. I guess a part of me always hoped she would reach out at some point, which she never did. I’ll be honest, I really liked her. I know it was only one date, but we can’t help when we catch feelings. I’ve gone out with other women since then but it hasn’t helped.

Now it feels like my whole workplace is tainted. Even once she’s gone, the memory of her is going to linger around this place big time. I started suffering from insomnia after this incident first happened. It hasn’t been persistent, but there have been several weeks since then where I only sleep 2-3 hours per night. I dread going into work because of her presence.

I feel so pathetic. I need to move on. I’m over here obsessing about whether or not she’s going to say goodbye to me before she leaves, meanwhile she’s not thinking about me at all. I’m losing sleep while she’s out there living life.

I know there’s lessons to be learned from this situation. In 5 years, I know I’ll look back on this experience and be thankful that it made me more emotionally resilient. Right now though, it really sucks. 

She made her interest, or lack thereof, loud and clear, and I’ve just been unable to accept it. What’s wrong with me? I thought I was over these types of feelings after high school.

Just to be clear, I am in therapy.",7,1742927498.0,limerence,2,0.9,False

First, please note this race happened almost 5 weeks ago. I thought it's only fair to give something back to this community considering how much I've learnt from here. If you have any questions or think you could benefit from any further insights into my experience, please ask in the comments. I'll be very happy to help!

# Context

M31 from Spain. Even though I always enjoyed running, I never got too much into it. Got the itch of running a marathon at some point during the 2020s lockdowns, but first a pneumothorax and then pure procrastination delayed any effort in serious running until the summer of 2022, where I just thought I'd just sign up for one and force myself to train.

I prepared for it with some generic Runner's World plan blended with a Novice Hal Higdon one, and even though I understood very little about running, I really enjoyed the training and went on to finish my first marathon in 3:40 - aim was 3:30 but I guess I met the wall!

Came back the following year (2024) with a target of 3:20 which ended up in 3:21. For this one I bought the Pfitz book and got more invested into the preparation, which was also very much enriched by many of your threads here in r/AdvancedRunning. Anyway, I was probably strong enough to reach my target but I simply overdid my negative split strategy (lol) and ended up with a nice PR but feeling I just left too much on the table.

In hindsight, this was a great thing to happen: it turned running into a very welcome obsession, and then came the preparation for this year's race.

# Training

As I felt increasingly stronger coming back from the summer and even after a 3-week break between wedding preparation and honeymoon, I thought I could give sub-3 a serious try. If my shape somehow didn't get there, I could always dial the target back to a decent PB - which coming from 3:21 should be fairly feasible anyway.

Trying to make this report useful to others in a similar situation, I'll start by simply listing what I changed in the last year, beginning with the ones I find more generally accepted to be positive for anyone, then ending with some odd ones.

(1) Distance: very obvious one, I know. I went from a 60km weekly average in my previous plan to in excess of 90k this time. So a >50% increase while incredibly remaining injury-free

(2) Training with others: this was completely new for me and proved to be a game changer. I signed up with a local club and was very lucky to find a couple pals chasing a similar goal, and one of them coincidentally in the very same race

(3) Strength training: in the summer heat I found refuge in the air conditioned gym while slightly neglecting my running, making it some sort of 'pre-season' for my marathon cycle which also made me gain almost 10% in body weight. And while this surely hampered my summer running fitness, it's probably helped me remain injury free later in the year, with my highest mileage ever

(4) Variety: following the quality sessions prescribed by the club coach surely had its downsides (see below) but it helped me break free from my previous overly-regimented approach, which basically had me only doing 5 types of workouts and just varying distances

(6) Diet: I decided to go vegetarian right after the summer, and while this obviously isn't necessarily good for performance by itself, it made me pay much more attention to what I eat. Together with Fitzgerald's book, I got to race day in my leanest ever

Training structure was generally as follows, sometimes with a medium-long run on Mon/Wed:

Monday: easy run + short strength session

Tuesday: quality session (club run)

Wednesday: easy run

Thursday: quality session (club run)

Friday: easy run or rest

Saturday: easy run (or 1st part of split long run)

Sunday: long run (or 2nd part of split long run)

Quality sessions included all kinds of stuff: intervals, track reps, fartleks, tempos, hills... while the weekend long runs were either split in two between saturday and sunday, or just one session including marathon pace. A couple weekends I exceeded the marathon distance, but my longest run in the plan was barely above 31km long.

The marathon plan itself began in the first week of December, making it 12 weeks long. Weekly distance was between 75 and 103 km, with an average of 93. I did a half marathon by the end of January which was a huge confidence boost, as I hit just below 1h24m - giving me a VDOT projection of sub-3 just before cutting my mileage ahead of the race.

As I mentioned above, running with a club was great but it made me discover how aggressive the approach of an old-school coach can be. Sometimes enjoyable, but also at some points I really wondered whether I was peaking too soon and risking injory. Some of the most brutal workouts were:

10 weeks before the marathon: 3x3K + 4x400m at something slightly faster than threshold pace 6 weeks before the marathon: 30x300m at \~mile pace with 100m walk recovery, in the track - I must admit I enjoyed it 6 weeks before the marathon (yes, that same one...): 25km long run on Sunday with 16km at marathon pace (4'15""/km) following a progression + hills session (12km total) on Saturday 10 days before the marathon: 2x6K first one at Marathon pace (4'15""), second one all out (3'48"" average) - a classic cornerstone of Spanish athletics, this is called the Gavela test and I personally think it's a really bad idea. That's what tune races are for, right?!

# Pre-race

Worth mentioning I am from Seville myself and my parents still live there, so pre-race accommodation is as easy as can be. It is advertised as Europe's flattest marathon, and indeed the course feels very forgiving.

On race week I followed Matt Fiztgerald's protocol for caffeine fasting from Monday, which seemed like low hanging fruit considering I'm a big time coffee drinker. Nothing too relevant apart from that, just stuff I believe to be common sense: avoided alcohol, tried going to sleep reasonably early and had the healthiest possible diet. I also tried to not overdo carbs until Friday, but to be honest I think >50% of my calories came from carbs everyday anyway.

I had the Maurten marathon pack and tried to make use of most of it. On Saturday, I had a typical Sevillian plate consisting mostly of chickpeas and spinach for lunch, while dinner was a pizza. During the day I also snacked a couple bananas and oranges, a Maurten 320 drink mix and a Maurten solid bar. So my carbo-load wasn't actually that different from what I would've had on a normal weekend.

I had an awful pre-race night's sleep: I don't think I fell asleep before 2:30 due to silly nervousness, and my alarm was set for 6:40. I believe this only highlights how important it is to have proper rest the days -and possibly weeks- leading to a big race - especially for those who tend to be nervous. Also, next time I might just use some sleep pill and forget about it, because this was very annoying to deal with.

Woke up with the alarm sound, and I just felt relieved the night was finally over and I didn't feel tired. My breakfast was a large espresso (finally, coffee!), a white bread toast with some olive oil and a Maurten 160 drink mix. Left my parents' at 7:20 and took the metro, arriving at the starting line area around 8:00.

Did a very light warm-up with just one \~50m stride if I recall correctly, then I met my pals and we passed the pre-race control around 15 minutes before, as our side of the entry was a bit crowded. Got over with the customary pre-race pee and went straight to my starting box, which for some reason was the 3h15-3h30 one. Race staff wouldn't allow me into the 3h one and I was just resigned to comply, but my friends were very insistent for me to just crouch underneath the barricade tape, and I would end up thanking them for this.

I had a Maurten 160 gel right as we heard the starting pistol for the elites and jogged towards the starting line.

# Race

Any remorse about my starting box transgression quickly disappeared as we ran the first kilometer. We had to overtake hundreds of people that were surely running slower than the 3h-3h15m paces, and it was just very crowded in general. My watch already had something like 70m in additional distance as I was passing the official 1K mark.

We made it a priority to get within sight of the sub-3 pacer relatively soon, as we reckoned they had crossed the starting line something like half a minute before us. But we already hit the target pace in the second kilometer, which was reassuring, and reapproached it as just shaving a couple seconds per km when possible and see.

Had my first gel at the 9th kilometer as planned, shortly before the second aid station. Maurten explicitly advertises you don't need water to wash down their gels, but it's something I struggle with and I was keen to make it as easy as possible. Given the relatively high temperatures, the strategy was to take a cup of sports drink in every station if possible, which I managed to do 7/8 times.

Saw my wife on the 13th kilometer - felt a bit bad about how brief every time I saw her was, but obviously it's supposed to be like this in a race! She walked something like 8 kilometers during the race to see me in four different spots, so definitely quite awesome from her side as well! She offered an extra gel every time, but I only ended up taking two.

We had a very steady run up until the half marathon mark, getting within \~100m of the sub-3 pacer by then. At this point there was very little to get anxious about: everything was coming together, the weather was perfect, crowds were very supportive... My only concern left was to avoid getting too excited until the final few kilometers.

Thankfully we played it on the cautious side, as things looked quite different from kilometer 34 onwards. I began to feel my right thigh a bit, which brought intrusive thoughts of whether I was going to make it, and even doing calculations in my head of how I'd end up if I were to drop to my easy pace (\~5min/km) at some point. The last gel felt pretty much impossible to swallow - this is something I should probably practice more in training, because it was the same in my January half marathon.

We still managed to push the pace, and I really felt the boost in confidence of seeing the first marker starting with a 4 by the cathedral. By then we were right by the sub-3 pacers, which were carrying a bit less people than I imagined. I last saw my wife in one of my favourite avenues of the city, which also happens to be the coolest part of the race as it comprises the last couple hundred meters of kilometer 42. She told me I was doing great, and indeed I saw this when I completed the last turn and saw the timer showing 2:59:3X.

I knew I had a bit of a buffer for a sub-3 real time, but I obviously went all out in those last meters to also try and have an official time below 3 hours... and even that came together pretty awesomely, as I crossed the line while the clock showed 2:59:59 - paired with an unbelievable 2:58:53 in real terms.

# Post-race

It was obviously my best race ever, and there's something about the whole prep process that made this one feel really special - particularly how unlikely a sub-3 looked a few months before. The race itself went close to perfection, something I feel lucky for considering the long list of things that can go wrong in a marathon race.

I must admit I caught myself wondering how much I could have shaved off my time if I pushed the pace earlier than kilometer 40. Maybe half a minute or even more, but never worth the risk of getting hurt at that point.

Wherever I read about it, the prospect from >3h20 to sub-3h was unanimously discouraged. Obviously context is key, as my previous PB had come off worse fitness and lesser focus overall. But I still like to think it was a great achievement to improve so much in a few months.

Also, I cannot recommend the Seville marathon enough. I'm obviously biased having been born and raised there, but I really think there's hardly any reason for a non-pro runner to favour Valencia over it.

Looking at what's next: I think I'd like to get faster in shorter distances like 5K and 10K, then maybe have a go at proper qualifying times for World Majors - though Berlin's 2h45 feels outrageous to ever think of, in terms of VDOT it's not as far as this one was from my previous PB.

Chose the Able Carry Max EDC by a very thin margin

**Intro**

So I wanted a black bag that was not X-Pac.  I already have a green Able Carry Max EDC in X-Pac, so I preordered the same pack in black ripstop.  Then Aer had to go mess with my plans by coming out with the City Pack Pro 2 while I was waiting on AC.  I had the excellent CPP1 before the EDC, which replaced it, so I had to compare both, and I ordered the CPP2 also.

Keep in mind here that I'm evaluating both relative to my personal use case.  I use the EDC for work, carrying lunch (Packit), headphones (really, Sony, you couldn't make the WH1000XM5 fold??), a chunky Dell 15"" laptop, a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9, a travel mug of coffee, miscellaneous other mostly small stuff (eyedrops, tide pen, eyeglass wipes, band aids, etc).  We then get in the car, drive near work, and walk about half a mile to the office.  So what I'm saying is, I'm not that tough on bags.  I'm not wearing them all day.   I don't generally access them while walking.   I don't usually get caught in huge rainstorms nor stroll through car washes.  The other use case is for 2-3 day travel, often car trips, when the bag is really filled (clothes, cpap, toiletries, electronics, etc).  So I'm evaluating under those needs

To start, the CPP2 is 5 oz lighter and like $50 cheaper than the EDC.

**Material**

I really like Cordura...that would normally be my preference.  However, The ripstop on the EDC is much more pliable than X-Pac, less crinkly and the ripstop pattern is much more subtle than the X-Pac diamonds (I have never tried Ultra, so can't compare).  Looks good.  As for durability, I have an Eagle Creek suitcase made of the same ripstop material, and after 10 years of crazed baggage handlers, it looks like new.

BTW,, the Xpac version of the EDC has heavy cordura on the bottom.  The Ripstop version is ripstop all the way around.  Not an issue for me, but maybe matters if you have a more rugged scenario

The insides of both bags are gray ripstop.  Had been hoping for the gorgeous cream color lining of the Green EDC X-Pac, but gray's fine

Good mesh padding and ventilation on the back of both and very cushy padding on the straps for both. Some of the best padding in the biz.

**Capacity**

As I described in a previous post, the EDC really does have at least 2 liters more capacity than the CPP2, tested by an actual loadout.  Interestingly, I previously had done the EDC (XPac) against the CPP1, and the volumes were equal.  Clear win for the EDC here

**Comfort**

Both are extremely comfortable.   REALLY comfortable.  If I was forced to make a choice, I'd give it to the CPP2 by a hair.  A thin hair.  They definitely improved the comfort over the CPP1.   Of course, this depends also on your particular body and how high/low you carry the bag.

**Organization**

I used the top convenience pocket on the CPP1 a  lot, but it hung into the main compartment, which always bugged me.  In the CPP2, they made the pocket only 3"" deep, but 12"" wide.  No phones or anything else bulky in there.  However, while the pocket was widened to 12"" long, the zipper is only 8"" long, so there's 2"" on each side that are not under the zipper, and it's kind of a pain to fish stuff out of that part

By contrast, the top pocket (back by the hook) of the EDC is  8 inches deep and 7"" wide.  Much more versatile

Both bags have a stretchy mesh compartment on the inside wall of the main compartment.  Both have 2 zipper compartments on the front flap.  The EDC has 2 zippered nonstretchy compartments, the CPP2 has one zippered stretchy compartment and one non stretchy.  The EDC has a stretchy water-bottle-holder-like compartment on the side wall of the main compartment, nothing on the side wall of the CPP2

The zippers on the main compartment of the CPP2 go all the way to the bottom, so it opens flat in true clamshell style.  On the EDC, the zippers stop a couple of inches above the bottom, so it doesn't open totally flat like the CPP2.  I find this isn't really an impediment to loading or unloading the main compartment.

**Laptop Compartment**

Unless you have a 17"" computer, this is a clear win for the CPP2.  The laptop compartment on the EDC is a single immensely deep pocket...well padded, but keeping, say, a laptop and a tablet in there is having them pressed up next to each other, nothing in between (which, tbh, isn't the most horrible thing).  It's much tighter than the CPP2.  The CPP2 has 3 well padded parts in the laptop compartment, so typically, a laptop, tablet and a document or file folder might go in the 3rd compartment, which runs the length of the bag.  Both compartments are suspended, and the EDC can hold a 17"" Laptop, whereas the CPP2 can hold a 16"" (which usually means a MacBook 16"")

**Admin Compartment/Panel**

The bags take very different approaches to admin compartments.  The CPP2 is more traditional, being inside the top front compartment of the pack.  I believe they shortened it from the CPP1, heightening the lower front compartment.  It has one full width zipper compartment and 2 unzipped pockets.  None are stretch.  I found the CPP2 had a surprising amount of volume in the top front pocket...it was totally useable even when the bag is fully packed out.

The EDC takes a different approach and the ""admin panel"" is more like a built in tech pouch at the top of the laptop compartment.  It doesn't compete for space with the main section. It's also got a small amount of volume beside the 3 slightly stretchy pockets inside.  The section has it's own zipper, but I found that leaving the zipper open lets you access the contents like a real convenience pocket and it's close enough to the laptop compartment zipper that there's no room for stuff to fall out.

And not pen holder to be found in either.

**Front Compartment**

The CPP2 has a bottom front compartment that is larger than the CPP1   I found, as I did with the CPP1, that if the bag is completely filled out, the bottom front panel is pretty useless.  I was surprised because the bottom compartment has pleats, but in reality, has very little independent volume

The front compartment of the EDC is large and has pretty much no organization (it has a single stretchy zipper pocket that runs most of the length of the front compartment).  Good as a ""stuff a jacket"" compartment or shoes (assuming your feet are smaller than mine).  People love this compartment because it lacks organization.  People hate this compartment because it lacks organization!

**Water Bottles**

Two external on the CPP2, 1 concealed on the EDC.  I really don't need 2 water bottle holders, YMMV.  The EDC water bottle holder does take some main compartment space, but not as much as I thought it would.  I don't have any really large (>20oz) water bottle to test it with.

One thing I found annoying on the CPP2 is that the side handles end IN the water bottle holders.  That makes water bottle a bit harder to put in, and interferes somewhat with using the side handles when there's a water bottle on that side.  Not a horrible problem, just one that shouldn't be there

**Side Handles and Top Handle**

Speaking of side handles, the CPP2 has two of them, the EDC has one.   On the CPP2, they're located toward the top of the bag which makes things a bit off balance.  On the EDC, it's more centered.  Padding on both handles are good.  The Top handle on both are also quite comfortable, though the handle on the CPP2 has been moved toward the back, and it's a less cushy than on CPP1.  The EDC handle is centered front to back (and there's a hook on the back of the bag to hang it, which is probably why the CPP2 moved their handle back).  Side handles are interesting in general...I thought they were pretty useless until I got a pack that had them.  Now I find myself using them a lot.

**Zippers**

YKK everywhere, no Aquaguard on the EDC, zippers are very smooth.  Aquaguard on the CPP2, on the Laptop compartment and lower front compartment.  They run smoothly too.  The CPP2 has zipper garages and tabs to grab at the ends of the zippers to give you some leverage when opening or closing the zippers(not sure what these are called).  The EDC does not, though some zippers are protected with flaps that negate the need for garages and you could probably grab one of the bottom lashpoints to do the vertical zippers.

The zipper pulls are stickyish hypalon (or hypalon-like) on the CPP2, a big improvement over those on the CPP1.  The zipper pulls on the EDC are coarse cloth/nylon of approximately the same size  and are color matched to the bag...green bags have green zipper pulls.  Note that the pulls on the EDC form loops, so they might be better if you're wearing gloves.  Both work well.

**Other Stuff**

The EDC has what seems to be a zillion lash points (actually, I counted 10 and I'm sure I missed some), all webbing, whereas the CPP2 has 2 D-Rings and 2 lash points on the strap and 2 Hypalon loops at the bottom of the bag that can double as lash points or zipper tabs.

The CPP2 removed a side pocket that was on the CPP1 to make room for the second water bottle.  The EDC has a fairly large/deep (some say too deep) pocket in the handle side, with the zipper behind a flap which protects from the weather and makes this a kind of ""secret"" compartment

Oh, and there's a  pocket so secret on the EDC that most owner's probably don't know about it...it's a velcro pocket attached to the front of the compartment the contains the frame sheet, accessible by zipper at the back of the inside of the laptop compartment.  I figure if I stick $20 in there now, I'll totally forget about it and be delighted in 10 years when I find it!

Sternum straps on both are magnetic, I think the one on the EDC is very slightly easier to open.  But the one on the CPP2 is much easier to adjust up and down, it's kind of a pain on the EDC.

The straps of the EDC has a hidden place for things like metrocards.  I will probably never use those. Wish I had'em for the years I train commuted to NYC

Luggage passthrough puts the bag vertically on the CPP2.  It puts the bag horizontally on the EDC.  Clear win for the CPP2.  Unless your bag is organized to make use of horizontal access, like the Evergoods CPL line, or is exceptionally tall, your bag should be vertical.  I usually use the Aer Go Pack 2 for a personal item on flights, and this also attaches vertically.  Love that bag!

Both bags stand on their own, with varying degrees of leaning depending on how they're packed out and weight distribution.  The CPP2 seems to be a bit more stable.

The CPP2 has a key leash in the bottom front compartment.  The EDC has one in the side pocket, but it can also be relocated into the front compartment.  I don't keep my keys in the bag, so I don't care.

**Conclusion**

I'm gonna go with the AC Max EDC.  The larger capacity, more organization, more externally accessible and much more useable pockets decided it for me.   I feel Aer really blew it with the new convenience pocket, and yes I have several tech pouches that could compensate, but I prefer it built into the bag.   I also like the aesthetics of having a vertical visual element to the bag, which the front compartment provides.

That being said, these are both superlative bags, and either one would exceed my requirements.  Really comes down to personal preference.  Hope this helps!",4,1742927034.0,ManyBaggers,2,1.0,False

# Entry two

From my window I was able to see the single, individual tree standing in the middle of a yellow field of dry grass. The wind was gentle, but strong enough to move its leafless, thin branches.

Why was it still there? Maintaining itself steady in the middle of that open space. Its trunk was already dark and withered, being nothing more than burnt wood. However, it kept its standing— its lifeless standing. 

I hated that tree. It reminded me too much of myself. Also, it seemed to be an analogy of hope; stay on your feet even in death and adversity, even if times and circumstances aren’t favorable. 

Someone please chop that tree off. It’s useless, it’s dead, it serves no purpose. 

On the other hand, what lay beyond the yellow meadow was even worse: mountains teeming with greenery and life, surrounded by vibrant vegetation. It was pure nature, untouched by the hand of man for hundreds of years, yet still able to be visited. 

Just looking at those peaks made my guts twist. A single glance was enough to make my stomach turn and feel the need to throw up the last thing I had eaten. Remembering the smell of the morning dew on green grass, the noise of leaves hitting against one another thanks to a soft breeze or the cheerful chirping of birds at dawn made me have goosebumps of disgust. 

If you scream at a dog every time it does something it's not allowed to do, its brain will associate that action with a negative stimulus. Or, considering a much more unpleasant experience than a simple yell, if something traumatic happens to that dog and it associates it with a committed act or a nearby object, it might never approach the object or perform that act again, even if it only experienced it once. Humans have that same instinct, even though we consider ourselves much more rational than mere animals.

I am that tree. My presence is meaningless on the dry plain, and I am incapable of approaching the mountains. The roots that bind the tree to the ground are my feet, making it impossible to walk toward what is truly alive.

Really, someone should chop the tree off.

After looking through the window for a minute, I stood up and walked towards the bathroom. It was early in the morning, and I had to get to work. I washed my face, brushed my teeth, and was ready to leave the house without breakfast. Eating was quite a task for me; my stomach was easily hurt and worsened in the mornings. 

“Hapi, are you leaving again without eating? What about coffee?” My mother’s voice was heard from the hallway, along with her small steps. I waited for her to arrive. 

“I’m sorry, mom. You know my stomach gets upset if I eat without being truly hungry.” 

“You’re all bones. You should start to make an effort.” 

I smiled at her and nodded, as I did every morning. Her concerns were justified. I had been thin for quite a few years, but gaining weight would mean eating more than what was necessary to live.

I turned around and opened the door to leave the house. Her hand gently grabbed the sleeve of my jacket, making me stop.

I already knew what she was going to ask me.

“Do you have a syringe on you, son?” Her voice broke me a little. It didn’t carry the same amount of concern that it did while asking me to eat, but more. I shook my head without turning to look at her. She was more worried about me than I was about myself and my wellbeing. 

“Thank you. You know I trust you.” She paused. “And I want you to be safe. It’s better this way, I know you’d get help if you need…” 

“I know, mom.” I interrupted, noticing how my voice sounded somehow harsh. “I’m going to be late.” Trying to make it up for my tone I looked at her with a gentle gaze, making my facial expression seem as genuine as possible. “Don’t worry. I’ll be fine.” 

Not giving enough time for a reply, I rushed out of home, closing the door behind me. I knew she was staring at its frame at the moment, probably wondering if my words carried enough truth. They didn’t. 

I looked at my left wrist, surrounded by a metallic, thick, red bracelet. It was somehow heavy, but I had been wearing it for so long that I couldn't feel its weight anymore. I couldn’t remove it even if I wanted to, but I was glad I had it. This bracelet had a meaning: whoever wore it couldn’t have anesthetic syringes on themselves— the remedy against The Peeling. The bracelet meant that it wasn’t safe for the owner or those around them to have it on their power, and relied on others to get help if it happened that they had a flare. 

This bracelet it’s the reason why I still live with my mother. 

I preferred it that way. I didn’t feel endangered wearing it, but rather lighter. I didn’t carry the weight to save a life, not even my own, and I got to never touch one of these syringes. 

Never again.  

I headed for work. I worked in a small library— cleaning, organizing the books, attending people and helping them find whatever they wanted to read next. It was an easy, calm job. It was placed in a somewhat busy street, so there was always something to do, no matter how small the task was. I enjoyed working there. The simplicity of the chores and the repetitive nature of the work kept my head busy. 

The walk to the library wasn’t so long. Maybe ten, fifteen minutes on the way there. The streets were narrow, surrounded by tall, wide buildings. However, between them, the tenants hung plants, colorful decorations and lights. Everything always had to look alive. 

As stated, the road’s time wasn't very long. And, since it was early in the morning, there weren't many people on the streets; maybe one or two university students trying to get to class or a worker cleaning the pavement. So, feeling a small force pressing on my legs from behind caught me by surprise. It stopped me midway, almost making me fall. Short arms hugged my thighs, and a head was resting on my hips. 

I knew no children, and the times that I’ve had talked to any I sure wasn’t kind enough to be recognized by one, let alone hugged from behind. I quickly turned around, finding a little boy still clinging to me, crying uncontrollably. Words tried to escape his mouth, but the sobs came faster and his babble was practically incomprehensible. My arms quickly rose, avoiding any kind of contact.

“Sir, please, please.” It took him a good ten or twenty seconds to start talking. “Help, please. Mommy, my mommy is acting so strange. She won’t stand up or stop crying. Please, sir. Please.” 

“What are you talking about?” I murmured. He finally let go of me and pointed behind himself, at the right. His whole body was trembling and the tears kept falling nonstop. 

“Please, please come and help mommy.” 

He grabbed my wrist and began walking quickly, turning around to look at me every few seconds as if he was checking that I was still behind him. Unable to leave a child to his own devices (even if I wasn't so fond of them) I followed him for a couple of blocks back to where his supposedly agonizing mother was. 

She was a young woman, probably not even five years older than me. 

Her situation was deplorable. Her hands were on her own throat, and her tongue was out. She was panting like a dog, gasping for air while squeezing her own neck. The sweat had quickly soaked her clothes, drops falling to the ground where she was kneeling, her chest pressed against the walkway. Reality sank in. She raised her head, stared at me, and whispered something I wasn’t able to comprehend. The position of her hands changed, moving towards the sides of her neck, and strongly pushed her nails inside of her skin. They went in like needles, practically effortlessly.

The child screamed so loud my eardrums were almost pierced. He looked at me again, begging and pleading for help. 

My body froze. I looked behind me, hoping that someone heard the commotion and would come to take care of the situation, but none was there. 

“You… didn’t you inject her with…” My voice was barely out of my body. The boy couldn't even answer; he just kept asking me to do something. Did he not even know what I was talking about? Has The Peeling become so normalized that people didn't even warn their kids about it or explain the basis? 

She was going to die if she didn't get her anesthetic quickly. Her blood was pouring out of her neck faster than my legs could move towards her and everything would happen even faster once she found the opening that would allow her to skin herself alive. I threw myself at the floor near her convulsing body, my knees scraping against the pavement. 

“I… I can’t do it… my bracelet…” I was talking to myself, trying to force myself to run away. However, my hands roamed over her clothes, trying to search for the object I was prohibited from having access to. I checked if she was carrying a bag or purse, but there was nothing. 

She didn't have an anesthetic either, but I didn't see any bracelet on her wrists. People were so irresponsible it disgusted me. 

I needed a few seconds to think. Would I have time to call an ambulance? Could I send the child to search for someone else while I checked on his mother? There should be a bit of time left, right? 

I heard a sigh of relief. 

“Fuck!” I shouted. One of her nails was firmly dug under her chin, and a strip of skin was beginning to peel away from her body with the utmost ease. The opening must have been there. I gritted my teeth, looking away to try not to see the scene and wrapped my right arm around her neck, squeezing hard. My other hand went to her mouth and nose, covering both completely, cutting off her airway.

“No! Mom! Let her go!” I saw the boy’s intentions for lunging at me.

“Shut the fuck up!” I screamed so loudly it echoed. He seemed to understand, because he pressed his lips together tightly and simply stared at me, trying to contain the volume of his sobs. Meanwhile, I continued to squeeze the woman's throat tightly, praying to a God I didn't believe in that the lack of oxygen would cause her to faint. At least my arm prevented her from tearing off chunks of flesh by blocking her path. The woman tried to scream and get away from me, but between the pain she must have been in and the fact that I was literally choking her, she couldn't have much strength left.

The next few seconds felt like hours. If I kept squeezing, I would probably break her neck. 

Finally, she stopped moving.",1,1742927008.0,ExtremeHorrorLit,0,1.0,False

My foot moved slightly and it stopped and then jumped back and scuttled away, back under the coffee table. I got the heebie jeebies but left it as is.

I didn't take a pic, but I assumed a jumper just from how quick it's ""jump"" was. It seemed a bit larger than the bright coloured jumpers I've seen and it was all black or at least, very dark coloured. He(?) She(?) had the same type of body shape. I'll just say He

While we were out my friend spotted a couple of baddies across the bar, I was the only guy in the group who had a girlfriend. So I being the wing man went over to the girls to introduce them to my friends. Some of the guys bought them a few drinks and they chilled with us before we ended up moving on to the next bar. As I'm chilling at the bar with my friends a straight 10 walks into the bar and squeals and runs over to her friends that are with my friends. I kept noticing her glancing at me, so I'd look away but then I'd feel her staring again. Finally I walked over and introduced myself, her name was Stephanie but she told me to call her Steph (26F) we started chatting and found that we had a lot in common. She was straight out of a dream, I couldn't have created a better specimen in a lab. As the night went on, and as the drinks kept flowing we ended up hooking up. Now I know that I'm the asshole, for cheating but I feel in my heart this woman is supposed to be my wife. We exchanged numbers and started texting. That's when I noticed the 4 missed calls, and the 13 texts from my girlfriend, Lala(30F).

I knew what I had to do. I told every one good night, and Steph walked me to my car. I asked if I could see her again, she said she was free the next day and I told her that I'd plan everything and to be ready at 6pm. I went home with mixed feelings. The next day I woke up and headed over to Lala's house. I brought her coffee and breakfast, she opened the door visibly upset. She started hollering at me for not responding to her last night and I asked if I could come in so we could talk. 

She sat down at the table we had a few bites in silence before she asked ""Well?"" My heart was pounding, I told her that I was done. I told her that I felt like we weren't working and her reaction to me needing space with my boys last night was the last straw for me. I watched as her anger turned to sadness and she started sobbing. Apologizing profusely, she said she was just worried about me, and that she thought I was cheating on her. My heart dropped to my stomach when she said that. I told her I was sorry but there was someone better for her out there, it just wasn't me. I left her crying at the kitchen table as I gather the few things that I left over, then ducked out before she could say anything else. I do feel bad, but I also felt extremely excited for my date that night. 

That night I picked Steph up and when I saw her I got EXCITED, if you know what I mean. She had this low cut red dress on and it fit her just right. She smiled at me and I swear her eyes sparkled, we had a great time at dinner, she told me more about herself. 

She lives on her own, she has a dog, she's getting her masters in nursing but works a four day week at the hospital as an RN. She loves going to the gym in her free time and teaches a Pilates class, whatever that is. She's from Miami but left to come up to Atlanta to be by her dad and other family. She's a good Christian woman. And did I mention she's a HARD 10. 

NGL I did think about Lala a lot throughout our date, but Steph was so bubbly and interesting that she would quickly take my mind off of it. That night I drove Steph home, she invited me in, and to my own surprise I said nah. Instead i went over to one of my boys houses that had met Steph and told him everything. He said that he agreed that Steph was fine but that it he didn't think it was worth throwing away what Lala and I had. I reminded him of the saying ""never let your girlfriend stand in the way of you meeting your wife"". But he told me I majorly fucked up what I did was a dick move, but idk.

While some waterfalls like Niagara or Iguazu draw millions of visitors each year, there are countless other breathtaking cascades tucked away in remote locations, waiting to be discovered by those willing to go off the beaten path. Whether you're an avid hiker, a nature lover, or simply seeking a serene escape, these unseen waterfalls offer peaceful solitude and jaw-dropping scenery without the crowds. Here are some of the world’s most incredible hidden waterfalls you need to explore.

# 1. Tumpak Sewu, Indonesia



Nestled deep in East Java, Tumpak Sewu (which means ""a thousand waterfalls"") is a natural wonder that remains relatively unknown to most international travelers. The waterfall cascades in a horseshoe shape, creating a massive, misty amphitheater of water. Reaching the base of Tumpak Sewu requires a steep and challenging hike, but the reward is a panoramic view that feels otherworldly.



Why it’s special: Its unique, wide curtain of water cascading into a lush green canyon creates a dramatic and awe-inspiring sight.

# 2. Havasu Falls, USA



Located in the remote Havasupai Indian Reservation within the Grand Canyon in Arizona, Havasu Falls is famous for its vibrant turquoise waters that contrast against the red rock cliffs. The hike to the falls is long and challenging, requiring a permit and a reservation well in advance, but the journey is worth it to see this natural beauty up close. The waterfall’s secluded location has helped preserve its pristine condition.



Why it’s special: The surreal blue-green waters of Havasu Falls, framed by towering cliffs, create one of the most stunning contrasts in nature.

# 3. Kaieteur Falls, Guyana



Tucked away in the remote rainforests of Guyana, Kaieteur Falls is one of the world's most powerful waterfalls. With a single drop of 226 meters (741 feet), it is nearly five times the height of Niagara Falls, yet it remains one of the least visited. The waterfall plunges into the Potaro River, surrounded by lush jungle teeming with unique wildlife. Accessing the falls often involves a short plane ride followed by a trek through the jungle, making it a true adventure for the intrepid traveler.



Why it’s special: The raw power and isolated beauty of Kaieteur Falls make it feel like an untouched corner of the world.

# 4. Plitvice Waterfalls, Croatia



While Plitvice Lakes National Park in Croatia is a UNESCO World Heritage site, some of its stunning waterfalls are still lesser-known compared to Europe’s famous natural landmarks. The park is a labyrinth of interconnected waterfalls and lakes, with some of the most beautiful hidden deep in the forest. The lower lakes, especially in the off-season, offer a serene, almost mystical atmosphere as water tumbles over rocks covered in moss.



Why it’s special: The cascading waterfalls, crystal-clear lakes, and verdant surroundings make Plitvice a fairytale-like setting.

# 5. Gocta Falls, Peru



In the remote northern region of Peru lies Gocta Falls, one of the tallest waterfalls in the world with a staggering height of 771 meters (2,530 feet). For years, the waterfall remained hidden from the world, known only to locals who believed it was protected by mythical creatures. Gocta Falls only became internationally known in 2005, and it still receives far fewer visitors than its height would suggest. The hike to the base of the falls takes you through the dense Amazonian forest, adding to the adventure.



Why it’s special: The combination of its towering height, mysterious history, and remote location makes Gocta Falls a true hidden gem.

# 6. Multnomah Falls, USA



Though not entirely unknown, Multnomah Falls in Oregon’s Columbia River Gorge still flies under the radar for many international tourists. This towering 189-meter (620-foot) waterfall is one of the most picturesque in the Pacific Northwest, with a stone bridge crossing over the lower cascade. While it’s easily accessible by car, the surrounding hiking trails lead to more secluded spots with equally stunning views.



Why it’s special: Its dramatic, dual-drop and iconic bridge make it one of the most photogenic waterfalls in the world.

# 7. Dettifoss, Iceland



Iceland is known for its dramatic landscapes and waterfalls, but Dettifoss, located in Vatnajökull National Park, remains a relatively less crowded destination. As the most powerful waterfall in Europe, Dettifoss is awe-inspiring, with a flow that churns through the volcanic landscape. Its raw power has earned it a spot in films like *Prometheus*, yet it still offers solitude to those willing to explore the northern reaches of Iceland.



Why it’s special: The sheer power and lunar-like surroundings make Dettifoss feel like you’re standing on another planet.

# 8. Fairy Falls, New Zealand



Hidden within the lush rainforests of New Zealand’s North Island, Fairy Falls is a multi-tiered waterfall located in the Waitakere Ranges near Auckland. Despite its proximity to the city, the hike to the falls winds through tranquil forests, and the waterfall itself feels like a hidden paradise. Cascading down a series of moss-covered rocks, the falls create a peaceful and enchanting atmosphere.



Why it’s special: The secluded setting and gentle cascades make Fairy Falls feel like a secret oasis in the forest.

# 9. Tad Fane Waterfall, Laos



Located in the Bolaven Plateau in southern Laos, Tad Fane Waterfall is a striking twin waterfall that plunges 120 meters (394 feet) into a jungle-covered gorge. The surrounding area is rich with coffee plantations and scenic viewpoints, but the waterfall remains relatively undiscovered by mass tourism. Tad Fane’s dramatic drops, surrounded by thick tropical forest, make it one of the most beautiful waterfalls in Southeast Asia.



Why it’s special: The twin streams of water plunging into the dense jungle offer a breathtaking and unique view.

# 10. Ban Gioc-Detian Falls, Vietnam/China



Straddling the border between Vietnam and China, Ban Gioc-Detian Falls is one of Asia's most stunning yet lesser-known waterfalls. The waterfall cascades over three tiers, creating a series of impressive drops surrounded by karst hills. Though it’s the largest waterfall in Asia, Ban Gioc-Detian Falls sees relatively few international tourists due to its remote location.



Why it’s special: The combination of the dramatic karst landscape and the multi-tiered waterfall makes this one of the most visually striking falls in the world.

# Why Visit These Unseen Waterfalls?

While famous waterfalls are breathtaking in their own right, exploring these hidden gems offers something even more special: the opportunity to experience nature’s beauty in solitude. Away from the crowds, these waterfalls allow for a deeper connection with the natural world, whether you’re hiking through dense forests, marveling at misty cliffs, or simply sitting by the water and listening to its gentle roar.

Ugh, I think I overdid it today and all I had was a cup of coffee and a cup of black tea. I think I forget that it can take a little while for Vyvanse to fully take effect because right now it’s all kicking in at once… Also, how long til the med normally kicks in for you personally? For me I feel like it’s like an hour… I wish I would have remembered that today before having that strong cup of black tea (the kind I have is especially strong and I used 2 tea bags) because now I’m having extreme dry mouth, fast pulse, and anxiety which I could only attribute to the combo of Vyvanse and caffeine. It sucks bc I also have asthma & allergies and it can be incredibly difficult to pinpoint the source of my symptoms sometimes but it would be normal to have the side effects of Vyvanse amplified like that with more caffeine right?

I started a new medication that help with hunger, so it easier for me to skip lunch and eat a large early dinner. So I only eat 2 meals. 

In the morning I get a muscle milk protein drink, dunkin med iced caramel coffee, and a glazed donut. dinner is whatever but mostly low carbs and no sugar. I have days where I feel sluggish, I know it’s because my breakfast is not holding up well. 

My mornings are hectic and cooking is not going to happen. I have a tendency to replace carbs with to much fat so Dunkin’s egg bits are high in fat.
