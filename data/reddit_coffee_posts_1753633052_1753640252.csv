1matezz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mindfulness/comments/1matezz/a_simple_exercise_in_selfawareness_that_could/,A simple exercise in self-awareness that could change how you understand yourself,"Close your eyes for a moment and think of a memory from childhood that fills you with a deep, almost magical sense of meaning. Perhaps it's your grandmother's kitchen on a Sunday morning, the sound of rain on your bedroom window, or the way afternoon light fell across your school playground. Notice how that memory isn‚Äôt just a recollection of the past‚Äîit carries something more profound, an almost mystical quality that feels both wonderful and somehow unreachable.

What you're experiencing isn't simply nostalgia. You're witnessing a fundamental force of human psychology in action‚Äîone that has been shaping your desires, emotions, and life choices since you were small, yet remains largely unrecognised.

# The Mystery Behind Your Most Meaningful Moments

That sense of inexplicable specialness you just felt? It has a name: hagioptasia, meaning ‚Äúholy vision‚Äù. It's your mind's tendency to perceive certain people, places, objects, or thoughts as possessing an otherworldly quality of significance‚Äîas if they're touched by something transcendent.

Here's what makes this discovery so remarkable: while many of your experiences of hagioptasia do relate to your childhood, it isn't only about the past. It's a perceptual mechanism that's actively working right now, transforming ordinary experiences into sources of profound meaning. Your nostalgic memories are simply the easiest place to observe it in action.

# A Simple Test: Watching Your Mind Create Magic

Try this revealing exercise:

**Step 1:** Think of three specific childhood memories that feel especially meaningful or ""magical"" to you. Not just happy memories, but ones that seem to glow with significance.

**Step 2:** Now ask yourself honestly: Were these moments actually extraordinary when they happened? Or were they fairly ordinary experiences that have somehow acquired a deep sense of specialness over time?

**Step 3:** Notice the paradox: You can intellectually recognise that these were probably quite mundane moments (a typical Tuesday afternoon, an unremarkable conversation, playing in a garden), yet they continue to feel profoundly special despite this rational understanding.

This is hagioptasia at work. Your mind has taken ordinary experiences and imbued them with a quality of ""specialness"" that feels completely real and external‚Äîas if the magic exists in the actual place or event, rather than being created by your perception.

# Why This Matters More Than You Think

Once you learn to recognise hagioptasia in your nostalgic memories, you'll start seeing it everywhere:

* That inexplicable allure of celebrities and status symbols
* The way certain places (a favorite caf√©, a scenic viewpoint) seem to possess an almost sacred atmosphere
* Your attraction to vintage items, heirloom objects, or things with ""history""
* The transcendent quality you perceive in music, art, or literature that moves you so deeply

This isn't mere sentimentality or cultural conditioning. Research involving nearly 3,000 people has shown that around 80% of us experience this perceptual tendency from early childhood. It's a fundamental feature of human psychology, rooted in our evolutionary heritage.

# The Evolutionary Story Hidden in Your Feelings

Why would our minds be wired this way? The answer lies deep in our evolutionary past. Hagioptasia likely evolved as a sophisticated guidance system‚Äîa way of marking certain experiences, places, and relationships as significant and worth returning to or seeking out.

Consider how your nostalgic feelings often center around:

* Your childhood home and family
* Seasonal celebrations and traditions
* Moments of safety, comfort, and belonging

But hagioptasia also extends to social dynamics in ways that mirror other species. Just as male deer are instinctively drawn to impressive antler displays, or peahens respond to elaborate tail feathers, humans automatically perceive ‚Äúspecialness‚Äù in high-status individuals‚Äîcelebrities, leaders, successful peers. This same mechanism that makes childhood memories glow with meaning also drives hero worship, status anxiety, and competitive envy.

These patterns aren't random. They represent exactly the kinds of experiences and social perceptions that would have enhanced survival and wellbeing for our ancestors. The sense of ‚Äòspecialness‚Äô was evolution's way of saying: ‚ÄúPay attention to this. Value this. Seek more of this‚Äîwhether it's a safe haven or a powerful ally.‚Äù

# The Double-Edged Gift

Understanding hagioptasia reveals both its benefits and its potential pitfalls:

**The Gift:** This mechanism allows us to find profound meaning and beauty in ordinary life. It's the source of our deepest aesthetic experiences, our capacity for awe, and our ability to form lasting emotional bonds with places and people.

**The Challenge:** Because hagioptasia operates automatically and feels completely real, we often mistake its effects for external truth. We chase after things‚Äîcareers, possessions, relationships, experiences‚Äîbelieving they possess the specialness we perceive, only to find ourselves disappointed when reality doesn't match our hagioptasic expectations.

# A Path to Wiser Living

Here's the transformative insight: Recognising hagioptasia doesn't diminish the beauty of your experiences‚Äîit enhances your agency in creating them.

**Before awareness:** ‚ÄúI need to recapture that magical feeling from my past‚Äù or ‚ÄúIf I could just achieve \[goal\], I'd have that sense of specialness in my life‚Äù.

**After awareness:** ‚ÄúI have a natural capacity to perceive specialness, and I can cultivate this in my present experience rather than chasing illusions‚Äù.

This shift is profound. Instead of viewing your current life as somehow lacking compared to an idealised past or future, you can recognise that the source of magic was always within your own perception. The song of a blackbird in your garden today is just as worthy of that sense of wonder as any blackbird from your childhood‚Äîif you allow yourself to see it.

# Practical Steps to Harness Your Hagioptasia

1. **Practice Present-Moment Awareness:** When you catch yourself feeling nostalgic, ask: ‚ÄúWhat would it be like to experience this same quality of specialness right now, in this moment?‚Äù
2. **Question Your Pursuits:** Before making life decisions motivated by a sense that something will bring you that elusive ‚Äúspecial‚Äù feeling, pause and consider whether you're chasing a hagioptasic projection.
3. **Cultivate Gratitude for the Ordinary:** Deliberately practice seeing the ‚Äòspecialness‚Äô in everyday experiences‚Äîyour morning coffee, a conversation with a friend, the quality of light in your room.
4. **Recognise Cultural Manipulation:** Notice how advertising, social media, and status cultures exploit your hagioptasic tendencies by promising that their products or lifestyles will deliver that sense of specialness.

# The Deeper Invitation

Understanding hagioptasia isn't about becoming cynical or losing your sense of wonder. Quite the opposite. It's about reclaiming your power to experience meaning and beauty on your own terms, rather than being unconsciously driven by ancient psychological mechanisms or cultural forces seeking to exploit them.

Your nostalgic memories have been trying to teach you something important all along: You possess a remarkable capacity to perceive the extraordinary in the ordinary. The question isn't whether this capacity is ‚Äúreal‚Äù or ‚Äúillusory‚Äù‚Äîit's how you'll choose to use it.

Will you spend your life chasing after projections of specialness that exist mainly in your perception? Or will you learn to consciously cultivate that same sense of wonder and meaning in your actual, present-moment experience?

The choice, as always, is yours. But now, at least, it's a conscious one.

1matdxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1matdxv/aitah_for_this_awkward_barista_interaction/,AITAH for this awkward barista interaction?,"Hello everyone,

I recently had an awkward social encounter with a barista.

I've been going to a cafe like every weekday for a coffee for about 3 years.

Recently, it closed and a new one opened with almost all new staff.

I usually ask the staff 'how are you?', I work from home and have no outside space in my flat. It's a welcome quick social interaction and I sit outside often to get some air/sun. I never stay inside.

Recently, I asked a tall pretty girl working there how she is doing and she said 'im still at war'. Which I thought was odd but the street the cafe is on is pretty rough. I live on the same street and it's got a bad homeless problem, there's constant issues with homeless people and they often mess with the businesses. Smashed windows, it's a tough area but it's also a nice street except for this consistent transient homeless issue.

So I said 'because you're working on this street' and she said 'no, with silly little men' looking directly at me and grinning. The next day another staff member says the order is for 'that guy' and her and them are talking in a hushed sort of way. Now I'm getting dirty looks from the staff.. I think.

She then had to serve me and looked uncomfortable and didn't make eye contact. Very different tone etc with everyone else.

So now I'm searching through the inventory of our interactions, so to speak. It sort of ruined my weekend.

But, if I'm in the wrong I'd like to a. Know it and b. Address it in whatever way is best, from talking to her, a manager, or leaving it alone.

I did call her 'my love' on a few occasions.

Also, I've noticed her 'noticing' me a lot when I'm on my way in. So I wonder if she's thinking I'm barrelling in the cafe when I see her..

It's pretty awkward, definite full on eye contact whenever I walk in and then pretty definite negative approach.

I do tend to wear sports/gym gear and admittedly don't notice my appearance much, I also work like 60-70 hours a week.

The thing is I've been going to this place for years, and there isn't another place to get coffee except in a flipping hairdresser's.

Full disclosure, I think this girl is attractive. She's 23-25 and I'm 34.

I sincerely can't think of anything else I've done, but maybe I'm unconsciously creeping her out or something?

I really don't linger about, make any more conversation than with her any than any other staff member.

I'm going in for a coffee and don't care who makes it..

What do you think is happening here? It's distressing for me, and if she's sincere I feel bad for her.

1matd5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1matd5m/does_the_crazy_cups_flavored_coffee_pods_variety/,Does the Crazy Cups Flavored Coffee Pods Variety Pack Deliver? Review Inside!,"Testing out the Crazy Cups SYNCHKG118788 Flavored Coffee Pods Variety Pack has been nothing short of a delightful coffee adventure for me. I love starting my mornings with a flavorful cup of coffee, and this 40-count sampler pack offers an outstanding variety for every mood and season. From rich options like Death by Chocolate to the cozy Pumpkin Spice, there‚Äôs something in this pack for everyone, whether you're an intense coffee lover or someone who likes a lighter brew. I've been using these pods daily in my Keurig brewer, and they deliver consistent quality with every cup.

**Design and Packaging**  
The way these coffee pods are packaged stands out right away. Each pod is individually sealed, which not only keeps them fresh but also gives off a premium vibe. The compact box fits nicely into my kitchen cabinet without taking up too much space. What surprised me the most was the meticulous care in inspecting and packaging each pod. It‚Äôs clear that quality and customer experience were top priorities. Plus, the variety of featured brands like Guy Fieri, Crazy Cups, and Skinnygirl offers a sense of indulgence with every single brew.

**Highlights**  
- A wide variety of flavors catering to both classic and adventurous tastes  
- Gluten-free, vegan, kosher, and zero-calorie coffee options  
- Contains premium brands and high-quality pods  
- Packaging preserves freshness, ensuring every cup is aromatic and flavorful  

**Performance in Every Cup**  
Using these pods with my Keurig machine has been very smooth. Each brew comes out balanced, with no mess or leakage around the edges of the pod. The medium roast brings out a full-bodied flavor regardless of the blend, which is impressive given the range of flavors in this pack. While I loved exploring the boldness of Hazelnut and French Vanilla on one day, the sweetness of Moose Munch on another brought a smile mid-afternoon. It‚Äôs evident that quality control was not compromised since even the more intricate flavors like Coconut Caramel tasted distinct and fresh.

**Usability and Flexibility**  
This is where the product truly shines. I found the pods to work seamlessly with both older and newer Keurig machines. Their universal compatibility ensures you can use them without worrying about specific models. Additionally, their vegan and gluten-free status makes them an inclusive choice for various dietary preferences. If you host friends or family often, these pods allow you to offer a wide range of options. My friend who avoids gluten was thrilled to find so many choices in this pack!

**Drawbacks**  
Despite my overall satisfaction, a few areas could use improvement:  
- Some pods lack the strong aroma associated with freshly brewed coffee.  
- Certain flavors might feel a bit too sweet for those who prefer less artificial profiles.  
- The exact variety of flavors included in each box can sometimes vary, which may be frustrating for those with specific preferences.  

**Other Options**  
Before trying Crazy Cups, I had tested Starbucks K-Cup packs and Dunkin‚Äô Original K-Cups. Starbucks packs lean heavily on bold and dark roasts, which lacked the playful variety found in Crazy Cups. Dunkin‚Äô is great for its classic coffee flavor but lacks the innovative combinations like Coconut Caramel or Death by Chocolate. If you value flavor experimentation, this variety pack is unmatched. That said, coffee purists might still prefer Starbucks for its consistent intensity.

**Price Performance**  
Comparing this pack to similar products in the market, it‚Äôs reasonably priced for the variety and quality you get. Unlike some cheaper packs, the flavors here don‚Äôt taste watered down, and the freshness is evident in every sip. Even premium brands don‚Äôt always include dietary-friendly coffee pods, which gives this product stronger value for your buck. The convenience of receiving 40 pods in one box also eliminates mid-week coffee runs, which is a lifesaver for a coffee addict like me.

I love my GF very much and we've been dating for 2.5 years. We are saving up money to visit friends in Scotland. So excited! 

However i felt this disconnect since the start of 2025 where things have become increasingly more chaotic, Boring, busy and I feel tired. My GF has ADHD and she started a new job in radio in January 2025 as a Breakfast Show presenter (6am-9am) and then another show at (1pm-3pm), Going to gym, chores, personal care is very difficult for her right now and i've done everything i can to help. I wake up with her at 4:30 am, i make her coffee/breakfast, i cook, i clean, i do laundry and dishes because to me, this stuff is easy and it needs to get done. 

I work a 8am-5pm marketing job, but sometimes my hours can be more. I go to gym, cook, clean, and even have time to play 1-2 hours of games in the evenings. 

Despite all of this and our busy lives, we've not had sex. Actually, it's been 5 weeks since we last had sex and even then, it was bland and boring because she only agreed to it because i wanted to and she was leaving for 2 weeks to see her family. 

I'm very sexually active despite everything and she was sexually active when we just started dating. She loves me and finds me very attractive, i find her very attractive, but i feel as if i'm losing that spark. She always promises me we will have sex. ""oh next weekend, next weekend, we can do it tomorrow"" but when it comes, she's either not feeling well, too bloated, tired, overstimulated or not in the mood. I even try to help her with these but nothing. 

She always asks me for attention or to hold her and im at the point where i feel like being selfish a bit and say no. It's a terrible thought to have but felt like i needed to share. I don't want to have sex if she doesn't want it. It makes me feel gross and not-wanted. We must both want to but the problem is she never wants to and she doesn't see it as a problem. 

When she cries or gets upset i console her and love her. I feel stupid that im even upset over this, but i genuinly feel like im falling out of love. I have everything I've always wanted in a GF, but the sex. 

She even got mad at me when i decided to relieve myself. So i feel like i can't have sex and i cannot relieve myself if i need to. I feel stuck.

There‚Äôs this one table‚Ä¶ Good fan, decent light, back against the wall, emotionally supportive chair. That table knows me. I know it.

But today, it was occupied.
Well‚Ä¶ kind of. A girl was sitting there on one side. Just her bag on the table and she using her phone. I politely asked if we can shift the table slightly (it was flush against the wall) so I can sit opposite to her. Not with her. Opposite. Big difference.

She proceeds to:
	‚Ä¢	Stand up.
	‚Ä¢	Move to a different table.
	‚Ä¢	Return within 3 seconds because ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no fan there.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Pull the table all the way toward herself like she was claiming Siachen.
	‚Ä¢	Say ‚ÄúYou can sit on another table. I just want to sit alone.‚Äù

Bro.
I just wanted my chair. My table. My co-regulation corner. Not a soulmate.

Fine. I shift to another seat. But then something weird happens.

Every 15‚Äì20 mins, new victims show up trying to sit at that table. And she rejects them one by one.
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs sitting here.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúI‚Äôm using this.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Looks up, offers the silent glare of territorial dominance‚Ä¶

There‚Äôs nobody else at the table, mind you. Just her and her Bag of Power.

THEN. She packs up her laptop (a big MacBook, of course), leaves the caf√©, and just leaves the bag there. Like it‚Äôs a stand-in for her aura. Like the bag has squatters‚Äô rights. Just the bag. No human. No laptop. No coffee. Nothing.

Everyone keeps avoiding the table. Because obviously the Bag is sacred now.
One guy even walked up, looked at it, looked around nervously, and retreated like he‚Äôd triggered a security system.

15 mins later, she returns. Opens her gigantic MacBook. Starts laughing at something on-screen.
Just chilling. Unbothered. As if she hadn‚Äôt just gatekept that table harder than Admin blocks Wi-Fi on LAN ports.

So yeah.

Q: Why do people treat public coffee shop tables like they‚Äôve paid rent, installed Aadhaar-verified locks, and buried ancestral gold underneath?

And why do we all just go along with it?

Anyway. Currently sitting at an objectively worse table and feeling like I lost a war I didn‚Äôt know I was drafted into.

Let me know if I should:
	‚Ä¢	Bring my Samsonite next time and just leave it open on the table with a bunch of my clothes and pickle jars.
	‚Ä¢	Leave a UPS backup system plugged to my gaming rig to assert long-term claim.

I want to share something really personal and painful I experienced recently. I'm 27 now, and after years of saving, investing, and hustling, I had about ‚Çπ80 lakh saved up (\~\$95,000). I wanted to build something of my own, and like many young people, I thought a franchise would be a safer bet.

That‚Äôs when I came across a coffee brand called **COFFEA**. Their pitch looked solid‚Äîthey showed flashy photos, talked about fast returns, and promised full support. But once I signed the deal and put my money in, things started falling apart.

They never gave any real backend support. All the promises‚Äîmarketing help, staff training, proper SOPs‚Äîvanished after the payment was made. If I asked to speak with other franchise owners, they refused. They only talk about one store (Aligarh), and even then, they won‚Äôt let you speak to the actual owner. Just a controlled conversation on the phone where no real details are shared.

They even offer ‚Çπ25,000 to franchisees if they give a good review to someone asking about them. So yeah, if you try to check reviews before investing‚Äîmost of them are paid or scripted.

Neither they will guide you about the MCD license nor they help you will only get to know about the license s until and unless the concerned department allow a Challan or fine on your outlet 

When I pushed back and told them I lost my entire savings, they threatened legal action. Literally said they‚Äôd sue me if I talked negatively about their brand. The director, Ashish Dubey, was the one handling this and made all sorts of threats when I mentioned speaking up.

If you‚Äôre planning to open a franchise, especially if you‚Äôre young like me and thinking this is a safe way to start a business, PLEASE research deeply. Talk to *actual* franchisees, not just the ones they connect you to. Avoid anyone who hides contact info or discourages transparency.

I lost more than money. I lost time, peace of mind, and confidence.

1mat5br,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewedAppliances/comments/1mat5br/explore_the_best_drip_coffee_maker_hamilton_beach/,Explore the Best Drip Coffee Maker Hamilton Beach 46299 Review,"I‚Äôve been testing the Hamilton Beach 46299 over the course of several months now, and it‚Äôs become a staple in my kitchen. It‚Äôs a 12-cup programmable coffee maker that aims to blend convenience, flexibility, and ease of use. At first glance, it looks sleek with its black and stainless-steel accents‚Äîdefinitely a modern touch that elevates the counter aesthetics. However, it‚Äôs not just about looks. Let‚Äôs break this down and see how it performs and where it could improve.

**Convenient Programmability for Any Schedule**  
One of the standout aspects of this machine is its programmable feature. I‚Äôve got my mornings back because I can program the coffee maker up to 24 hours in advance. As someone who struggles to function before my first hit of caffeine, waking up to the smell of coffee wafting through the house has genuinely been a life-saver. It‚Äôs super easy to set up with clearly labeled buttons and an LED display that doesn‚Äôt complicate things unnecessarily.  

**Efficiency Meets Flexibility**  
The coffee maker offers something unique with its Select-A-Brew feature, which gives you three brew strength options. Whether you‚Äôre in the mood for a milder morning cup or a bold evening pick-me-up, this machine accommodates all preferences. Even on days when I only need one or two cups, the 1‚Äì4 cups option makes it incredibly efficient without wasting coffee grounds.  

[Check Hamilton Beach 46299 price on Amazon.](https://cncgn.com/p/b06xp4dkgl/)

**Quick First Cup Without the Mess**  
It drives me nuts when I have to wait for a full pot to brew before grabbing that first cup, but the Auto Pause & Pour function solves this beautifully. The brew process pauses briefly, letting me sneak a cup without causing a drippy mess. It‚Äôs a small feature, but if you‚Äôre like me and hate waiting, it‚Äôs one of those little things that makes a big difference.

**Effortless Cleanup**  
Cleaning this coffee maker is refreshingly straightforward. The glass carafe, which is made of borosilicate glass, and the Lift & Clean brew basket are both dishwasher-safe, which is something I absolutely appreciate. The nonstick warming plate can be wiped clean easily, making daily maintenance a breeze. I find myself spending minimal time scrubbing and more time enjoying my coffee.

**Safety and Peace of Mind**  
Another valuable feature is the 2-hour automatic shutoff. I can‚Äôt even count how many times I‚Äôve second-guessed myself about whether I left a coffee maker on before heading out. With this one, I just don‚Äôt have to worry about it. It automatically powers down, which not only brings peace of mind but also conserves energy.

**Good Points**  
- Sleek and modern black and stainless-steel design  
- Programmability for freshly brewed coffee at any time  
- Easy-to-use Select-A-Brew feature for customized strength  
- Dishwasher-safe components for easy cleaning  
- Auto Pause & Pour prevents waiting for the full pot  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The machine can feel a little bulky, especially in smaller kitchens with limited counter space  
- The brew strength options, though useful, don‚Äôt elevate flavor significantly for premium coffee blends  
- A reusable filter isn‚Äôt included, so you‚Äôll constantly need to stock up on paper filters  

**Competing Brands**  
When I compare this model to similar options, like the Cuisinart DCC-3200 or Keurig K-Classic, some differences stand out. The Cuisinart offers similar programmability but includes a reusable filter, which eliminates ongoing filter purchases. However, that model is often pricier, and the cleaning process for the Cuisinart isn‚Äôt as effortless. On the other hand, the Keurig K-Classic is a pod-based system, which sacrifices flavor range for convenience but is also messier with less eco-friendly waste from coffee pods. Hamilton Beach 46299 strikes a balance‚Äîit‚Äôs great for those who want an affordable but robust drip machine focused on flavor and flexibility.

**Smart Spending**  
Given the features and performance it offers, the value proposition is solid. You get a machine that caters to different tastes and lifestyles, all for a relatively reasonable investment. It may not be the cheapest option out there, but it definitely isn‚Äôt overpriced for the level of functionality and efficiency it brings to the table. From programmable brewing to easy cleaning and versatility, it proves itself a smart buy for fans of traditional drip coffee makers.

I told her to stay there a bit longer, enjoy the cool breeze coming through the window, and watch her shows in peace.

Meanwhile, I made myself a coffee and tidied up the balcony a little. After a while, we both started getting ready to head out ‚Äî we had errands to run: the pharmacy, Tesco, and Praktiker. We‚Äôre slowly preparing everything for our baby‚Äôs arrival.

I needed to buy a medical gown for the hospital since I‚Äôll be present during the delivery. My wife needed wipes, nappies, and some bathroom essentials to help with recovery after the birth.

A security guard actually chased us down in Tesco to return it ‚Äî I felt both incredibly grateful and slightly embarrassed!

After that, we picked up some soft robes for my wife, and in Praktiker, we found a lovely fan for our little girl‚Äôs room. My wife also grabbed some double-sided tape to hang a cute, cloud-shaped nightlight on the wall.

Hey everyone,
I want to share something really personal and painful I experienced recently. I'm 27 now, and after years of saving, investing, and hustling, I had about ‚Çπ80 lakh saved up (\~\$95,000). I wanted to build something of my own, and like many young people, I thought a franchise would be a safer bet.

That‚Äôs when I came across a coffee brand called **COFFEA**. Their pitch looked solid‚Äîthey showed flashy photos, talked about fast returns, and promised full support. But once I signed the deal and put my money in, things started falling apart.

They never gave any real backend support. All the promises‚Äîmarketing help, staff training, proper SOPs‚Äîvanished after the payment was made. If I asked to speak with other franchise owners, they refused. They only talk about one store (Aligarh), and even then, they won‚Äôt let you speak to the actual owner. Just a controlled conversation on the phone where no real details are shared.

They even offer ‚Çπ25,000 to franchisees if they give a good review to someone asking about them. So yeah, if you try to check reviews before investing‚Äîmost of them are paid or scripted.

Neither they will guide you about the MCD license nor they help you will only get to know about the license s until and unless the concerned department allow a Challan or fine on your outlet 

When I pushed back and told them I lost my entire savings, they threatened legal action. Literally said they‚Äôd sue me if I talked negatively about their brand. The director, Ashish Dubey, was the one handling this and made all sorts of threats when I mentioned speaking up.

If you‚Äôre planning to open a franchise, especially if you‚Äôre young like me and thinking this is a safe way to start a business, PLEASE research deeply. Talk to *actual* franchisees, not just the ones they connect you to. Avoid anyone who hides contact info or discourages transparency.

I lost more than money. I lost time, peace of mind, and confidence.
Please don‚Äôt fall into the same trap.

1mat2pe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Iloilo/comments/1mat2pe/iloilo_has_the_heritage_the_receipts_the_charm_so/,"Iloilo has the heritage, the receipts, the charm. So where are the international tourists?","I‚Äôve been walking through Iloilo‚Äôs ancestral mansions and weathered old streets lately, and it‚Äôs hard not to draw comparisons with places like Vietnam, HK, Macau, and Penang. All former colonies. All cities that turned their imperial pasts into cultural passports. Their old towns are now global tourism magnets: curated, romanticized, Instagrammed. Think lantern-lit alleys, restored shophouses, colonial hotels with rooftop bars.

Then there‚Äôs Iloilo.

A city where colonial opulence didn‚Äôt just exist, it peaked. Where history clings to the walls like it paid rent. It shares the same colonized past as its Asian neighbors but somehow never got the invite to the global heritage party.

Historical relevance? Iloilo didn‚Äôt just witness history, it funded it. Centuries-old cathedrals, ancestral mansions, art deco buildings, and plazas designed like Spain just dropped them off. Iloilo had electricity before Manila did, because of course it did. It was the wealth capital, trading globally while everyone else was still figuring out roads.

And the people? We‚Äôre not talking families. We‚Äôre talking dynasties: Lopezes. Javellanas. Ledesmas. Montinolas. Hofile√±as and more. Half the cast of your Philippine history modules probably had a house here, or ten.

Jaro? It wasn‚Äôt just rich. It was Vatican-level significant (literally the only diocese outside Cebu at the time). Because why settle for local when you can be papal?

These people didn‚Äôt just build homes.
They built banks.
Power plants.
National narratives.
Old money here didn‚Äôt trickle down. It scaled. With columns.

For all its heritage flex, Iloilo still isn‚Äôt on the radar of international tourists. No backpacker trails, no global buzz. Just quiet grandeur, old money, and colonial receipts collecting dust.

Comparison to other PH heritage spots:

Manila could have been that girl, but she‚Äôs been ghosting her heritage for decades.
Grand old buildings get torn down for condos named after the very landmarks they replace. (Heritage Residences, anyone?)
And Binondo, Intramuros, Quiapo? They‚Äôre boxed in by jeepney-choked roads, overhead spaghetti wires, and the harsh reality of slums that no one wants to talk about but everyone walks past.

Tourists mostly treat Manila as a layover: land, grab a Starbucks, then vanish to the islands. Which is tragic, really. The city had all the ingredients to be a heritage capital. Instead, it‚Äôs majoring in self-erasure with a minor in aesthetic neglect.

Vigan and Silay are charming but small. More like preserved slices than actual living cities. They lack the scale and urban depth Iloilo naturally has.

Iloilo, for me, is the closest city in the Philippines on the verge of catching up, matching the cultural weight and city appeal our Southeast Asian neighbors have long figured out.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not out here lighting candles for colonizers.
These buildings? Yes, they were built on stolen land and generational trauma.
But history isn‚Äôt a Google Doc. We can‚Äôt just hit backspace on colonization. We inherit the mess. And if what‚Äôs left are chipped cornices, sinking stone houses, and balconies that have seen too much, the question isn‚Äôt ‚Äúshould we pretend this never happened?‚Äù It‚Äôs ‚Äúwhat do we do with this now?‚Äù

Do we ignore them? Flatten them for another coffee chain?
Or do we keep them, not as monuments to empire but as reluctant storytellers?

And look, if we had more surviving architecture from pre-colonial Philippines, I‚Äôd be yelling about that instead.
But centuries of fires, floods, foreign invasions, and bad urban planning left us with what we‚Äôve got: Spanish-era churches, bahay na bato, old commercial blocks now housing pawnshops and 3-for-100 stores.

So the question is: why?

What‚Äôs keeping Iloilo from becoming a true heritage destination? The kind of city that draws international tourists not just for a day trip, but as a must-see stop on the cultural map?",2,1753639405.0,Iloilo,1,0.67,False

We had another baby about 2 months ago. If you read my post history you'll think I'm crazy...I'm trapped and alone in life and honestly too frozen with fear to take the steps I know I need to.

I responded to the BPD Bingo post yesterday and thought I'd post an update.

Today is my birthday. After her episode yesterday,  getting her and my daughters dressed up and loudly exclaiming she's taking them to the zoo and going on an adventure (stonewalling - she never invites me out with my daughter, we do nothing as a family or a couple, I'm ignored).

I audio recorded asking her if I could go and she smiled and said No. I told my almost 3 year old that I wanted to go but mommy won't let me. Yes I know I probably shouldn't do that, but I'm tired of never being invited to outings with my daughter, I've missed so much with my daughter and I can't bear the feeling that she thinks I just don't care, especially given how my girlfriend talks about me to her and around her. I needed to put it out there that I wasn't being invited.

As I walked away I finally let her know that I know about her secret snapchat. I left after this, drove around contemplating life until around 7pm. 

Today is my birthday and I stayed in my room until about noon so as to avoid my girlfriend and her parents. I quickly made breakfast, showered and was leaving to get my free starbucks birthday coffee when she told me to do my dishes (I genuinely forgot and there was a lot of dishes in the sink already). I ignored her and she told me don't come back.

She already deleted me off her Tesla app access (happens often, usually when she's visiting her friend in another state, or going out with a friend for the day...) 

I fully expect her to call the Police on me when I return. I'm exhausted, I've been exhausted for 4 years. I'm miserable and depressed. I'm always terrified of coming home after these episodes. The house is in her name, never put me on the deed like she said she would when we were buying it, never made the lease agreement like she said she would after not putting me on the deed. I pay half the mortgage, all the utilities, the groceries, and whatever other expenses come up. And she makes more money than I do.

She has called the police on me this past year and told them I haven't done anything wrong but she wants me escorted out of her house. She has threatened to call the police on me so many times I've lost count. She almost called them like a week before she gave birth to our second child  and I had to wake her patents up at 11pm so they could stop her. It's a constant threat held over my head. And I never have raised my voice, she does all the screaming. The last time she called the police she was trying to force her way into my room while I held the door shut and kept saying that I'm being aggressive...

I'm terrified and I'm exhausted. I go back to work on Tuesday and now I have to deal with this mess. 

Did I mention that her friends husband killed himself recently. He was a piece of shit, but she was the one convincing her friend that he was a narcissist and should leave him and would read out loud the texts she would send her friend explaining the narcissistic mind games he was playing...I couldn't even look at her because these were the same things she was doing to me. She made me change my beneficiary to her instead of my sister, this was the fight a week before she gave birth where she was threatening to call the police. She has an IQ of 120 to 140. She's brilliant and at times I'm convinced she's trying to wear me down so I can follow in her friends husband's footsteps. Sometimes I feel im being dramatic, and sometimes I don't. Oh and when her new best friend needed her the most, she was nowhere to be found, didn't go to the funeral. Eventually texted with her, but refused to meetup with her before she moved across the country. When you need them most they always disappear. ",1,1753639287.0,BPDlovedones,1,1.0,False

2. Baking Soda for Stubborn Stains,  If something's spilled and left a stain (like coffee or wine), I sprinkle a little baking soda over the spot and let it sit for a few minutes. After that, I just wipe it off with a damp cloth, and the stain is gone.
3. Lemon for Shine,  After cleaning, I wipe the countertops down with a small amount of lemon juice on a cloth. Not only does it add a nice shine, but the fresh scent is also amazing.

I‚Äôve been using this routine for a few months now, and my countertops have never looked better, plus, I‚Äôm avoiding those heavy-duty chemical cleaners. Has anyone else tried these natural alternatives?

I found this very interesting, and perhaps I have my preconceptions about Robusta challenged. They subscribe to James as well, so at the end of the video they challenged James to meet them there on the farm and discuss Robusta. I would have loved that.

1masvsv,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1masvsv/how_to_survive_the_office_as_an_introvert/,How to survive the office as an introvert,"**Two rules to live by:** Protect your peace early on and show your contribution.

An open office can be a nightmare sometimes. You need to create your safe space early on and set the right expectations.

Get earplugs or noise-canceling headphones, especially if you don‚Äôt like how a coworker breathes or slurps their coffee and it drives you crazy.

Practice saying no, a lot, practice it with ChatGPT if you must.

You don‚Äôt need to be overly rude or confrontational; you can be friendly and end conversations early.

I know it‚Äôs hard to go against the grain, but It is possible, some coworkers have done it to you, and you probably didn‚Äôt feel it happen.

Still not convinced? Okay, let‚Äôs compromise.

Can you say things like these?

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry to cut this short, but I need to get back to \[project/task\], let‚Äôs chat later.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm handling everything via Slack/email today, so please ping me there.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to attend, it sounds lovely, thank you, but I promised myself I‚Äôd make progress on X today.‚Äù

Not so bad, right?

**Show your contributions:**

Some companies tend to be biased toward extrovert‚Äëcentric performance metrics.

You can even be penalized because you‚Äôre not engaged enough and don‚Äôt contribute to meetings, events, etc.

It takes time for an introvert to put together their thoughts and articulate them, but extroverts tend to think through speaking, which creates a **‚Äúperformative contribution imbalance.‚Äù**

I‚Äôm not saying that extroverts are less effective than introverts, but we need to acknowledge the challenge for introverts here.

You can start showcasing your contributions in small ways first, either through the regular channels like Slack or by having a 2‚Äì3 bullet points prepared in advance for your next meeting.

You can also talk to your boss about how to be more effective within the team.

You don‚Äôt need to show better results; you‚Äôre probably already under-representing your achievements, and your career has probably suffered from this.

You need to show that you exist, that you listen, and that you participate.",4,1753638959.0,productivity,0,1.0,False

And I‚Äôm here holding a bleeding heart like it‚Äôs a fucking IKEA manual with no instructions, and one screw mysteriously missing.

I always knew affairs come with an expiration date- we aren‚Äôt exactly the poster children for *‚Äúhappily ever after.‚Äù* But I thought we'd get at least a few more stolen moments before the milk curdled. Instead, he hit the brakes mid-drive and left me emotionally windshield-smashed.

He didn‚Äôt ghost me. He just decided to go for a slow-faded ending. Like a shitty indie film ending where nobody says anything, they just look at each other until the credits roll. I was the one who had to rip the Band-Aid off.  Me, the one who still loved him. He couldn't decide between guilt and desire and ended up leaving me with both.

And I let him go. I didn‚Äôt fight. I told myself I wouldn‚Äôt be the reason he felt worse about his guilt. I told him I hope his marriage works out. That they all live happily ever after. (While I, obviously, spiral in a puddle of Taylor Swift and wine.)

Funny enough, today I babysat my niece. She realized her dad had left and ran to the porch crying ‚ÄúCome back, I want you daddy!"" tears, snot, fists balled in desperation. And all I could think was: *same, sweetie‚Ä¶ fucking same.*

My phone lights up and feels like a phantom limb expecting his name to show up. But it never does. And now every little thing reminds me of him. A joke we‚Äôd laugh at. A song. The way I make my coffee. And I have to stop myself from texting him because (*surprise!*) I‚Äôm now ghosting myself. Fantastic.

We never had a future. We were a permanent ""what if"" wrapped in hotel linens and secrecy. But I loved him. I still do.

Upside is- my bathroom is super spotless because I go there to cry all the time, so I clean it too to be proactive. 

Anyway. If you‚Äôre out here grieving a love you weren‚Äôt allowed to have ‚Äî hi. Welcome to the heartbreak speakeasy.

And to him:
If you're reading this.. I hope you're not. Shit. Fuck you (lovingly). And maybe fuck me too. (If you were only still around)



TL;DR:
Affair ended. He slow-faded. I had to end it. I‚Äôm grieving, angry, nostalgic, and occasionally crying on porches with toddlers. I loved him. I let him go. Still hurts like hell. Fuck him (lovingly). Fuck me (probably). Where‚Äôs my wine.",8,1753638836.0,adultery,4,0.79,False

1masr6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1masr6l/open_call_dumped_via_facebook_while_in_the_same/,Open Call: Dumped Via Facebook while in the same house,"Hi Charlotte,

Anomoyus because she might use reddit, but from what I understood generally hates AITA type content. Trigger warnings I mention domestic abuse but don't go into detail about it.

You had asked for men's stories. There were traumas that I had gone through with my last relationship that has stifled me in regards to relationships since with a bunch of other trauma.

When I was 31 I had met a woman on social media who turned out to be 22, yes, ther was almost a 10 year age gap and to be fair she orginally told me she was 25, I'll call her Sandra, but I was also dumb and stupid because the woman was hot and into me.

I will be up front that this wasn't any type of catfishing situation or her using me for money or gifts or anything. It was the the third date that the confusion about age was brought up as the first and second date landed in my home in two days time. She was catholic and there was some hanky panky on both sides and I was okay with it thinking that she'd probably ghost me because to be Frank, Jim, and Steve, she was out of my league, I was surprised she let me in her league, and even my friends were like ""How did you snag that?""

Honestly, I didn't know, but I will say that everything was pretty good, until it wasn't. There were red flags that I had ignored on my end. For example, she wanted a commitment in the relationship after two weeks and I didn't see this as a red flag and agreed because it made her feel better about the things we were doing physically in the relationship (we were active and she initiated most of the time). She didn't tell her parents that she was in a relationship, claiming that because she was catholic she didn't want her parents ot know that she was living in sin. Then she got promoted at her job and there was what I should have clocked as physical abuse but didn't because she'd love bomb me physically the next day and the abuse was always in sections that no one would see the results. I took it because I cared for her and she was stressed out with her new promotion at work. I thought I was the dude so I could take a few hits if it helped.

Our finances together were fine, mostly 50/50, and except for the above everything was good. We went on vacations, she had gotten her masters degree very early in the relationship and decided she didn't want to do anything with it so I supported her going through a career change. I encouraged her not to rely on me for all of her mental and emotional needs and to make friends.

She hated my friends because a lot of them were women who were pretty that were always 100% strictly platonic. It didn't matter if they were in other states, healthy, happy relations, or queer. She wanted me to cut them all off and it was the only thing I woudl classify as a fight because I put my foot down because cutting them out also ment cutting husbands and partners out and for people that did nothing but be good and respectful torward me and thought it was awesome I was in a relationship, but I didn't tell them the bad because I thought I could handle it.

It was 3 years in and I thought we had a happy home, a dog, a cat, my mom loved her. She had been low contact with her family and still didn't know about me and she refused to talk about it.

Then I lost my job that I had held for 6 years (I had created a comic to start a side hussle about a supernatural call center and they said I was disparaging the company when it just vampire and werewolf jokes in an office setting). That's was when things started to go south. It took me a few months to find work and I wound up getting work at her job as a temporary contractor. We were in walking distance and it was a larger company. She would have to be there first and I would come in every morning with coffee and a muffin for her before I went to do my job.

I did try to get myself into a position so I wouldn't be temporary (who actually likes job hunting?) and I was making a lot less than at my old job, and she got ""stressed out"" more often claiming that it wasn't me and I towed the line, while I outwardly gave the apperence that everything was fine.

I didn't get a full position there and near the end of that time my mom, who had visited, saw things that she always wanted to see as a child with Sandra, and went back home. Then my mom was diagnosed with cancer which they had a hard time finding the source. When my mom was put in the hospital for a longer term stay Sandra and I were going to fly to go see her, or as Sandra said, I would see her but she'd go visit the beach (I swear I was wearing red contacts). The day of the flight she demanded that we didn't arrive at the airport 2 hours before the morning flight and when we arrived we couldn't board, and the rest of the flights that would be going to where my family lived were canceled due to weather inbetwen my area and my families. I wound up going alone a week later for 48 hours.

So I was depressed, isolated, and told Sandra she didn't have to worry about me and do her thing while I tried to find work. She started going out with coworkers on a regular basis and having fun, but she started pulling away and I blamed myself. I would do what I could, clean, cook meals, and try to do what I could being home. I did finally find a full time job that was about $10/hr less than my good job but it required a longer commute but had room for growth and I was soul draining tired going back and forth every day. I had to fight and scrape for every bit of affection she would give me and I'm talking about even just cuddling in bed. At this point it had been about two years before we had done anything because consent is king and if she said no I wasn't going to anything. However I thought things were getting better because she wasn't hitting me.

Note that during the time of losing the first job, the contract job, and the new job it was about a year and a half and I was on medicaid and couldn't find a provider for therapy and my PCP wouldn't perscribe me my brain/depression/adhd meds.

While the people at the new job were lovely and I still have good friends from that today, I was basically getting more support from people that barely knew me than Sandra because I was dealing with my family and mom's care from thousands of miles away.  I had to leave this job some days even before my probationary period was up because I was told a couple of times that my mom wouldn't make it past the day.

It happened one morning before I got up for work and I called out. Sandra asked if I wanted her to stay but here again, I'm like, no babe, you go to work. I'm just going to stay here and cry my eyes out and she didn't hesitate to go to work or check in on me or ask if I wanted anything when, oddly enough one of my coworkers overheard my boss telling their boss why I wasn't there and \*they\* texted me asking me for my address so they could at least send a Foodler my way. I showed up to work the next morning because I needed a distraction and my boss sent me back home because even he was like ""your mom just died and your distraction will lead to mistakes and I don't want you to get fired.""

Even he was looking out for me more than she was. She didn't mention my mom again. The last day of my berievement leave I was notified that Sandra changed her relationship status with me on Facebook and then blocked me. I was literally upstairs in our shared office while she was downstairs in the living room.

""Did you just break up with me by changing your facebook status?"" I yelled (because of different rooms, I was too depressed to be angrily yelling). And she just texted back ""I figured it was easier this way.""

The first time she called me by my actual name after that was jarring. Due to everything that had happened I was forced to live with her for a few more months, found out she voted for the orange guy in the primary, and when I walked into the apartment one day from the back like I had usually been doing got to overhear her and a coworker, with the coworker asking if Sandra was going to do anything for her six month anniversery with Brian, another coworker.

She had been cheating on me for three months before the breakup. I was finally able to get out, granted to a worse living situation. She claimed to have thrown out the few family items my mom gave her when I requested them returned, and I had to leave the cat even though the cat loved me more.

It's been many yaers later, the orange guy won, then lost, then won again, I've been to therapy, moved around, haven't been in a relationship because I still think I should have just ended the relationship when the red flags were popping up. I feel that she actually got the best of me those years, but therapy has said I have major depression and PTSD because I did use to run into her on public transit when it couldn't be helped and I actively avoided areas of our city on the off chance she'd be there because one of her favorite shops were there. On top of that her physical profile is very common and at a glance there are many people that look like her, even now when I live thousands of miles away from where we were.

The worst crime I commited though, was not telling my friends what was going on as it was going on because I've been told multiple times now that it is out in the open ""We would have taken her ass OUT or at least dragged you out kicking and screaming with violent intervention tactics.""

long time chronic pain sufferer Here. I had the gastric sleeve in 2019. Since then I had 2 hernias and a stricture in my stomach that I was able to convinice my PCP to prescribe 30 2mg hydromorphone a day to be able to eat anything . I‚Äôve been in constant pain for 6 years stuck on opiods. That stopped in 2024 when we switched from Kaiser to Blue cross. 

2025 came still in massive pain. Had the gastric bypass surgery 2025 and the pain dropped but now is the same. I‚Äôm on 20 mg Vicodin before any meal, and I can eat and enjoy my food. No Vicodin and I cramp burning sensation an 11 rated pain on scale of 10. 

I‚Äôve been in to see my bariatric surgeon 10 times since the surgery. They prescribed me low dose liquid Tylenol 3 with codeine. Didn‚Äôt do anything and a 30 day supply I finished in 2 days. 1 time prescription.

the surgeon has done 2 endoscopies and 2 colonoscopies. nothing wrong nothing inflammatory seen. No ibs, no crohns, no diarrhea and. Normal bathroom stuff. 

The surgeon is sick me doesn‚Äôt want to deal with me. I‚Äôm taking my wife and 8 yr old daughter to my appointment so they can describe and explain how much daily pain I‚Äôm in and how much pain my wife and daughter see me taking on.

im not going to discuss where I‚Äôm able to cope and who gives me coping meds‚Ä¶

  
im going to plaintively explain i need daily Vicodin, and explain I‚Äôm not going anywhere until we get to the bottom of this. 

burning and cramping after every meal, is not normal. I‚Äôve been tested for ibs, crohns, and I don‚Äôt have bowel movement problems. I‚Äôve been on Vicodin for 2 years and it‚Äôs very very expensive when not going through a pharmacy. 

im mean and miserable to my wife when im in pain and I have no energy for work or to play with my daughter. They will be my voice in the room tomorrow:

  
‚ÄúDr., I need 6 10 milligram Vicodin daily. I need you to go back in see why I can‚Äôt eat protein nor anything solid and why my whole life has descended into pain. I want a referral to pain clinic and I don‚Äôt want to buy 2nd hand dangerous drugs on the street! (I test each bag of pills with fentanyl strips, and I keep narcan on me at all times. )

I used to weigh 350, 6‚Äô1 and now I weigh 179 and I‚Äôm dying inside. 

my wife and daughter are going to cry in front of my surgeon to get pain meds and see why I‚Äôve grown to fear any type of food because it hurts to eat anything now. I‚Äôm a former shell of myself. 

to add insult to injury, my business is in a severe depression too.

I‚Äôm not suicidal just severely depressed. 

I skipped vico last night at Goofies kitchen (restaurant at Disney) and I couldn‚Äôt eat. I sat at dinner in a restaurant sipping decaf coffee for a 200 dollar buffett at Disneyland and I had one dinner roll and coffee Massive pain.   
  
I took 2 Vikes at bedtime and ordered a cheeseburger and I ate the whole thing on 2 viks! I can‚Äôt eat without it and no one will proscribe it and I‚Äôm at the end of my financial rope too.

## Key Features Analysis

The modern small leather backpack incorporates a range of features designed to enhance both its aesthetic appeal and functional utility.Understanding these features is crucial in making an informed purchasing decision.

**Material Quality and Durability**

The quality of the leather is paramount in determining the backpack's overall durability and longevity. Full-grain leather,known for its robustness and natural beauty,stands as the highest grade,aging gracefully and developing a unique patina over time.Top-grain leather, while slightly less durable, offers a smoother finish and greater resistance to scratches and stains. Genuine leather, frequently enough a more affordable option, may not possess the same level of resilience but can still provide adequate performance for everyday use.

Choosing a backpack crafted from high-quality leather ensures it can withstand the rigors of daily wear and tear, maintaining its appearance and structural integrity for years to come. the tanning process also impacts the leather's feel and resistance to the elements. Vegetable-tanned leather tends to develop a richer,more complex character with age,while chrome-tanned leather offers better water resistance and a softer texture.

**Size and Capacity**

A ""small"" leather backpack generally ranges in capacity from 5 to 15 liters, making it suitable for carrying essential items without being overly bulky. The dimensions typically measure around 10-14 inches in height, 8-12 inches in width, and 4-6 inches in depth. the ideal size depends on your individual needs and the types of items you intend to carry regularly.

Carefully consider the size of your laptop, tablet, or other electronic devices to ensure they fit comfortably within the backpack's main compartment. Also, assess the volume required for other essentials such as books, notebooks, water bottles, and personal accessories. A well-designed small leather backpack will maximize its internal space through strategic pocket placement and compartmentalization.

**Compartments and Organization**

Effective organization is essential for a functional small leather backpack. Multiple compartments, pockets, and dividers help keep your belongings neatly arranged and easily accessible. Look for backpacks with a dedicated laptop or tablet sleeve, ideally padded to provide extra protection. Internal pockets for smaller items like phones, wallets, and keys are also highly desirable.

External pockets, such as front zippered compartments or side slip pockets, offer convenient storage for frequently used items like snacks, sunglasses, or travel documents. A well-organized backpack minimizes clutter and allows you to quickly locate what you need without rummaging through the entire bag. Consider the number and types of compartments based on your specific organizational needs.

**Straps and Comfort**

Padded shoulder straps distribute weight evenly across your shoulders, reducing strain and fatigue. Adjustable straps allow you to customize the fit to your body,ensuring the backpack sits comfortably without digging into your shoulders or back.

Look for backpacks with breathable mesh padding on the back panel, which promotes airflow and prevents excessive sweating. A well-designed back panel contours to the shape of your spine, providing support and minimizing pressure points. The width and curvature of the shoulder straps should also be appropriate for your body type and the expected weight of the backpack's contents.

**Hardware and Fastenings**

The quality of the hardware, including zippers, buckles, and clasps, is a critical factor in the backpack's overall durability and functionality. Opt for backpacks that use high-quality metal hardware, such as brass or stainless steel, which are resistant to corrosion and breakage. Smooth, sturdy zippers that glide easily without snagging are essential for convenient access to your belongings.

Buckles and clasps should be robust and reliable, ensuring they stay securely fastened even under heavy load. Pay attention to the stitching and reinforcement around the hardware attachments, as this area is prone to wear and tear. Durable hardware not only enhances the backpack's longevity but also contributes to its overall aesthetic appeal.

**Style and Aesthetics**

The aesthetic appeal of a small leather backpack is a significant consideration for manny buyers. Leather offers a timeless and sophisticated look,available in a variety of colors,finishes,and textures. Choose a style that complements your personal taste and wardrobe, whether it's a classic minimalist design or a more contemporary and embellished look.

Consider the overall shape and silhouette of the backpack, as well as the details such as stitching patterns, hardware accents, and embossed logos. A well-designed leather backpack can elevate your overall style, adding a touch of elegance and sophistication to any outfit. The color of the leather should also be selected carefully, taking into account its versatility and how well it pairs with your other accessories.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about small leather backpacks:

**How do I properly care for my leather backpack to ensure its longevity?**

Proper care is essential for maintaining the beauty and durability of your leather backpack. Regularly clean the leather with a soft, damp cloth to remove dirt and dust. Use a leather conditioner every few months to keep the leather supple and prevent it from drying out and cracking. Avoid exposing your backpack to extreme heat or direct sunlight for extended periods, as this can cause the leather to fade or become brittle. Store your backpack in a dust bag when not in use to protect it from scratches and environmental damage.

**What is the difference between full-grain, top-grain, and genuine leather?**

Full-grain leather is the highest quality leather, made from the entire grain of the hide. It is the most durable and develops a rich patina over time. Top-grain leather is made from the top layer of the hide, but the surface is sanded and finished to remove imperfections. It is indeed smoother than full-grain but less durable. Genuine leather is a general term for any leather product made from multiple layers of low-quality leather bonded together. It is the least expensive and least durable type of leather.

**Are leather backpacks water-resistant?**

Leather is naturally water-resistant, but it is not waterproof. Light rain or splashing will generally not harm leather, but prolonged exposure to moisture can cause damage. Consider using a leather protectant spray to enhance the backpack's water resistance. Avoid submerging your backpack in water or exposing it to heavy rain without proper protection. If your leather backpack gets wet,gently wipe it dry with a soft cloth and allow it to air dry away from direct heat sources.

**What is the ideal weight capacity for a small leather backpack?**

while the weight capacity varies depending on the specific design and construction, a small leather backpack is typically designed to carry between 5 and 10 pounds comfortably. Avoid overloading your backpack beyond this weight limit, as it can put excessive strain on the straps, zippers, and seams, potentially causing damage over time.Distribute the weight evenly within the backpack to maintain balance and prevent discomfort.

1masnk1,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1masnk1/need_of_advice_and_insight/,Need of advice and insight,"Hello all, I am in need of advice and insight.

I gained around 35 pounds, and now I'm working on losing that weight. I had an issue with not having enough water. Recently, I have made an effort to increase my water intake, walk over 12,000 steps, practice yoga for 10 to 15 minutes, and try to fast for around 12 to 14 hours. My dinner is eaten late at around 9 pm when my husband gets home from work, and I avoid eating until the next day at 1 pm. I dont go to sleep till 12 am so eating at 9 isnt a problem. Upon reflecting in the mirror, I noticed a change. Hence, I made the decision to check my weight today, hoping for a decrease of at least a pound, but I was stunned. I have not lost, and there's a chance that I have gained. I am feeling crushed and unsure of what to do. 

 I went to the gym to have my body measured on their scale. They told me that my body size was around, 64% muscle, and around 32 fat.

1masgp8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricVehiclesUK/comments/1masgp8/begginers_ev_buyers_guide/,Begginers EV buyers guide,"I recently bought an EV and did a load of research before doing so. However I've not seen a text based EV buyers guide that I'd recommend to a beginner. The ones I found were very long, and included topics that aren't really relevant for a beginner which divert focus from the important points. They also did not include key topics such as depreciation or charging rate. 

My biggest gripe is I don't come away after reading them with an understanding of how insanely cheap it can be on a per mile basis to run an EV. 

The Little Book of EV Myths is very good, though not a beginners buyers guide.

Here's my attempt at a beginners buyers guide.
 
---


## 1. Can you charge at home/work cheaply?
 
The main reason to buy an EV is that it‚Äôs cheaper to run than an ICE (internal combustion engine) car. However, this only applies if you can charge at home or work cheaply. If you can‚Äôt, then it‚Äôs likely to be more expensive than an ICE car.

This is because the cost of electricity varies significantly depending on where you charge your car. Charging at home or work is much cheaper than charging at public chargers. See the table below for a comparison of costs I have paid in July 2025.

Location | Home Economy 7 Night | Work Wholesale Price | Home Standard Tariff | Cheap Public Charger | Expensive Public Charger
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Electricity Cost | 7p/kWh | 13p/kWh | 26p/kWh | 50p/kWh | 87p/kWh
Cost per mile* | 2.3p/mi | 4.3p/mi | 8.6p/mi | 17p/mi | 29p/mi
Petrol or Diesel Equivalent (140p/gal) | 276 MPG | 149 MPG | 75 MPG | 39 MPG | 23 MPG

`* Assumes 3.33 mi / kWh and 10% charger loss, which is typical for a Corsa e driving at 70 mph on the motorway in summer.`

## 2. What are your longest journeys?

Recent EVs have [ranges greater than 300 miles](https://ev-database.org/uk/cheatsheet/range-electric-car), with real world ranges above 150 miles. This is more than enough for all sensible commutes. Journeys that are longer than this will require charging stops, which can take 10-15 minutes at ultra-rapid chargers.

Here's an example of a long journey in an EV:

https://i.imgur.com/G0d0RYp.png


This [180 mile journey](https://abetterrouteplanner.com/?plan_uuid=3b21756e-bfed-484a-b57b-c67edf5c156b) is too long for my Corsa e's 150 real world range, so it's split into two 90 mile legs with a 14 minute charging stop in the middle. Three hours is a long journey, so I'd want to stop for a break to stretch my legs, go to the toilet and get food or drink anyway.

With a 150 mile range, I can drive for 2-2.5 hours before needing a charge. EVs with larger batteries can drive for longer before needing a charge.

## 3. Charging on long journeys

Public EV chargers come in a variety of charging speeds, which change how long it takes to charge a car. On long journeys rapid (50 kW+) to ultra-rapid (150 kW+) are used, which can charge some models to 85% in 10-15 minutes. It's typical to charge to 85% as charging slows down significantly as the battery approaches full. Chargers are often located near coffee shops, fast food or supermarkets so there‚Äôs something to do while charging. The time taken to charge a 50 kWh EV with different chargers is shown below:

Charger Type | Charging Power | 10% to 85% Charge Time
--- | --- | ---
Rapid | 50 kW | 45 minutes
Rapid | 100 kW | 23 minutes
Ultra-rapid | 150 kW | 15 minutes

The maximum charging power also depends on the car, so is a key differentiator for long journeys. Older EVs were limited to 50 or 100 kW, while newer EVs can charge at 150 kW or more.

The public charging network is extensive, with most of the UK covered. 
[Zapmap](https://www.zap-map.com/live/) shows the locations of public chargers, their charging speeds, costs and whether they are in use. By default it shows slow chargers, but you can filter to show rapid (purple) and ultra-rapid chargers (pink), as shown below.

https://i.imgur.com/oqCMyvv.png

On the long journey example, there's several chargers on the A303 around halfway through the journey at Andover or Amesbury.

## 4. Charging at home/work

There's a few options for charging at home/work depending on how much you drive and how much you want to spend on charging equipment. You may not need to spend ¬£500-¬£1000 to install a wallbox charger if you don't drive much. 

Option | Granny Charger | Home Wallbox | Granny Charger | Home Wallbox
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Charging Period | Overnight | Overnight | After Work | After Work
Charging Period | 5-7 hours | 5-7 hours | 12+ hours | 12+ hours
Charging Rate | 2.3 kW | 7 kW | 2.3 kW | 7 kW
Initial Cost | ¬£0* | ¬£500-¬£1000 | ¬£0* | ¬£500-¬£1000
Energy Charged | 16 kWh | 50 kWh | 27.6 kWh | 84 kWh
Miles per kWh | 3.33 | 3.33 | 3.33 | 3.33
Miles Charged | 53 miles | 166 miles | 92 miles | 280 miles
Electricity Cost | ¬£1.12 | ¬£3.50 | ¬£3.99 | ¬£5.88
Electricity Cost per Mile | 2.1p | 2.1p | 4.3p | 2.1p

`* You'll want to buy a granny charger regardless, so you can charge when away from home at friends/family's houses. This will be cheaper than using using public chargers.`

## 5. Depreciation

The initial depreciation is more pronounced for EVs than for ICE cars as the demand for used EVs prices them lower than comparable used ICE cars. People are more hesitant to consider used EVs than new EVs due to concerns about battery degradation and how EVs age, which are less of a concern when buying or leasing a new EV. After the initial depreciation, EVs depreciate in a similar way to ICE cars with [similar year on year depreciation rates](https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/electriccars/article-13600427/Sweet-spot-EVs-better-value-petrol-car.html). 

The size of the used EV market is currently increasing rapidly as [EVs bought since 2020](https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/electric-cars/choosing/road-to-electric/) enter the used market. The proportion of EVs as new cars is mandated by government to increase, so the supply of used EVs will continue to increase. Conversely, the supply of used ICE cars is decreasing as the number of new ICE cars sold decreases.

Ultimately the price of used EVs is determined by supply and demand. If the large increase in supply of used EVs in the coming years is not matched by people switching from used ICE cars to EVs, the price of used EVs will fall faster than their used ICE counterparts. 

## Summary

If you can charge at home/work cheaply it‚Äôll be cheaper than ICE, otherwise it‚Äôll be more expensive and less convenient.

Rapid and Ultra-rapid chargers make long journeys feasible, with most of the UK covered by the public charging network.

High charging speeds (100 or ideally 150 kW+) shorten recharging breaks to less than 20 minutes, so is arguably more important than range for long journeys.

A granny charger is sufficient for most people who average less than 50 miles per day.

The initial depreciation of EVs is greater than ICE cars, while subsequent depreciation is similar. 

There is a risk that the supply of used EVs will increase faster than demand, causing the price of used EVs to fall in the future.

# Pill Vs. Potion or The Effectiveness of Effervescence

In Ullera, drug stores are more than just places to buy alchemies, medicines, and potions‚Äîthey are vibrant community hubs, often featuring soda fountains or ice cream parlors at their heart. It may seem counter intuitive that medicine and sugar have become so entwined, but the combination of consumerism and culture has carbonated healthcare.¬†

Magical potions have been stored in glass vials as liquids for centuries, but industrialization has discovered powder pill synthesis. The 3 major benefits of reducing a potion to powder pill is shelf life, potency, and shipping.¬† A powder pill usually lasts ten times as long as a liquid potion.¬† A powder can be encapsulated into perfect dosages to apply the desired effect and duration at the desired delay.  Finally, a bottle of a hundred pills with a ball of cotton on top weighs the same as a single potion bottle.¬† In GAME TERMS, any potion can be turned into a pill using the rules in the 5e DMG (pg 128-129), but it does not cost anything to dehydrate if they already possess the desired potion.¬†¬†¬†¬†

Spell casters craft bitter or unpleasant-tasting potions, but there is a sweeter alternative. Ulleran soda fountains flavor their potions and extracts with carbonated sugar water (soda) for palatability. In addition to the extraordinary effect of the potion or extracts, soda jerks (alchemists) claim the sweet soda water has minor benefits such as aiding digestion, boosting productivity, or relieving headaches. Many find caffeinated soda water quite addictive and drink it instead of coffee or tea.¬†¬†¬†

Soda fountains are a smart business move. They attract a wide audience from children seeking sweet treats to adults looking for a pick-me-up. In smaller towns, the local soda fountain is a gathering spot where people galvanize, socialize, and revitalize. In cities, the corner drug store symbolizes a health and hospitality, where pharmacists (proficiency with herbalism kit) served not only prescriptions but also milkshakes, soda floats, and sundaes. Drug store chemists (proficiency with alchemist supplies) are cultural icons in their own right.  In regions where alcohol is prohibited (DRY), soda fountains are considered a wholesome alternative to now boarded-up saloons.

Ubiquitous potions (*cure wounds*, *mage armor*, *polymorph*, and *invisibility*) have become the four pillars of mass produced carbonated tonics sold throughout Ullera under the brand-names of **Cure-Aid**, **Armor-Up**, **Polyjuice**, and **Cellofade**.¬† Armored vending machines sell these soda potions as well, and are equipped with deadly traps against thieves. The thick glass reusable bottles are exceptionally sturdy (AC 13, HP 8) and can be redeemed for a refill discount.¬† The disposable bottle caps are collected, traded, and used to decorate armor and weaponry by soda drinkers and soda jerks (alchemist archetype).¬†¬†",1,1753637922.0,puresteam,0,1.0,False

Are you tired of dreaming about those shiny revenue streams without actually making a dime? Or maybe you‚Äôre just a little overwhelmed by all the possibilities out there? ü§î  

Well, gather ‚Äòround because we‚Äôre diving into **how to turn your AI dreams into üí∞ streams** in 2024! Seriously, there‚Äôs a whole world of untapped potential waiting for you, and I promise it‚Äôs not as daunting as it seems.  

**First off, let‚Äôs talk about why NOW is the time to jump in.**  
The AI content creation landscape is shifting faster than my coffee consumption during finals week! üå™Ô∏è If we wait too long, new monetization strategies will get saturated faster than TikTok trends. Here are my top picks that are ripe for the picking:  

- **Personalized Content Creation Services:** Think subscription-based models where clients get personalized newsletters, social media posts, or even tailored blog content. The beauty? You  can automate the mundane parts and keep the personal touch. Everybody loves unique content! 

- **Niche Educational Content:** Remember how we all jumped onto that NFT bandwagon? Well, educational series about AI tools, workflows, or even ethical AI use are still fresh. Who wouldn‚Äôt pay a few bucks to become an AI savant overnight?  

- **AI-Generated Art & Merchandise:** Between ChatGPT‚Äôs wordcraft and MidJourney‚Äôs visuals, you can create and sell unique art pieces or even printed merch! Think T-shirts, mugs, or journals. Suddenly, your love for AI turns into a side hustle!

- **E-books and Guides:** **Write and sell e-books** explaining how to effectively use AI tools. Imagine a title like *‚ÄúLevel Up Your Content Game: How I Found AI Goldmines‚Äù*. üìñ Sound catchy? 

- **Affiliate Marketing for AI Tools:** If you‚Äôve stumbled upon a tool that makes life easier (looking at all of you, prompt generators!), share the love through affiliate links. It‚Äôs a win-win!

- **Online Workshops or Webinars:** Let‚Äôs not sleep on this one! You‚Äôre a maestro in your niche, and people would pay to learn from you. You can teach them how to use AI tools effectively or even how to get started in content automation.

Now, I can hear the skeptics saying, can I really get in on this? ü§î Here‚Äôs the deal: **you‚Äôve got the skills**; it‚Äôs just about polishing them and finding the right audience.  

Here‚Äôs a little secret: people haven‚Äôt fully grasped the extent of what AI can do. So, don‚Äôt be afraid to showcase your knowledge and creativity. Just think of it as **sharing your favorit–µ playlist on Spotify**, you know? You never know who might find their new favorite jam!

And, let‚Äôs be real‚Äîif I can navigate through all this messy content creation, then so can you. It might seem overwhelming at first, but just remember:

- Take it one step at a time.
- Don‚Äôt overthink it. 
- And, most importantly, have fun!

So, which one of these ideas excites you the most? Or do you have your own unique twist on monetizing AI content? I can‚Äôt wait to hear what everyone has to say! üçø",1,1753637777.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

Went down a rabbit hole about water hardness and how it can effect the taste of your espresso and the longevity of your espresso machine. Found out the water in my area is extremely hard. 

Buying a water softening system is out of the question.... so is my only course of action simply to buy plastic jugs of distilled water and spending even *more* money on adding something like third wave water? I'm sure it will still come out cheaper than our coffee shop trips, but man this whole process can get frustrating quick...

Or can I just descale my machine more often and hope for the best?

Althea watched out the inn room‚Äôs window into the night.¬† After the park, she figured Phinney just needed some time to think.¬† Seeing the second shadow tail had really shaken him - *it must be some Voxa thing*.¬† She had noticed him repeatedly glancing at the cathedral overlooking the park square, as well.

*Maybe he needed to pray.¬† I know he‚Äôs got a religious side he doesn‚Äôt talk about.*

Althea sighed, looking up at the moon.¬† For years, she was used to being alone, after leaving the academy - Althea against the world.¬† Now she felt a strange emptiness.

*The priests will probably just call him an abomination, like they do to me.¬† They call me worse than even one of Houdmar, the ‚Äúfallen one‚Äôs‚Äù, creations.*

Althea settled down to bed.¬† She knew Phinney could take care of himself out there.¬† If he survived alone in the woods for decades, he could handle a little city life.

*Hell, when he gets scared, he‚Äôs probably invisible most of the time to everyone else.¬† I just don‚Äôt see - not, don‚Äôt see him? - myself.*

She settled down to a restless sleep.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

""Ruff! Ruff! Rahr-ruff!""

The sudden barking cracked through the midnight stillness. Phineas awoke with a start, hearing and smelling dogs.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre hot on to something out there!¬† Show us what you found, boys!‚Äù

Two guards were chasing after their patrol dogs, hot on Phineas‚Äô scent.¬† The guards wore leather breastplates, adorned with the blue and gold crest of Stonebrace‚Äôs local lord.

He froze for a moment, mind thick with fear, ears pinned flat against his skull.¬† *Snap out of it, you idiot!*¬† He shook his head, dispelling the terror.¬† *It‚Äôs just dogs.*

Climbing a tree wouldn‚Äôt work - he‚Äôd just end up trapped, with the guards below.¬† Talking to the guards wouldn‚Äôt help - the dogs would be on him, and knife-fighting the guards‚Äô dogs wouldn‚Äôt endear himself to the local patrol, either.¬†

At the thought, he felt his dagger nudge him. Looking down at the dagger on his side, head cocked to the side, he thought, *Well, that‚Äôs new.*

Phineas decided the easiest thing would just be to run toward the river.¬† After tracing some loops to confuse his scent trail, he bounded through the park, heading to the river.¬† The bridges between Duvano and Stonebrace were lit in the night, some with torches, the nicer bridges with some kind of magic lighting.¬† Running across the stone bridge, he could hear the dogs getting more distant.¬† *Stupid dogs.¬† I hate them.*

He slowed down to catch his breath, looking around at his surroundings.¬† He was near the docks, with a stone levee standing between the river and the town beyond.¬† He could see figures down at the docks, loading and unloading bales and crates from the river barges.¬† Surprisingly, a dark brown figure jumped up from the water to the dock, carrying tools.

Trying to get a better look, Phineas padded softly through the shadows.¬† The figures became more distinct - nearly human, but not quite right.¬† The figures had dark brown skin and walked on two short legs - *huh, another kind of two-legs I‚Äôve never seen before* \- but seemed just as comfortable in the water as land.¬† A crew of them in the water seemed to be doing maintenance on the dock piers, scraping off the mussels attached to the wood.¬†

As he got closer to the dock, he could see them more clearly.¬† They had broad faces with dark eyes, and their unshod feet had long, webbed toes.¬† The workers were wearing white linen robes, cinched tight with belts.¬† They spoke in a language that Phineas couldn‚Äôt make any sense of.¬† They were short, noticeably shorter than the humans alongside them.

A scent on the breeze, however, Phineas could make sense of.¬† A delicious smell wafted from a low building nearby, brightly lit up in the night unlike its neighbors.¬† Patrons walked in and out of the diner, both humans and the strange river folk.¬† He was nervous, but a rumbling stomach convinced him to go on toward the people and the promise of a meal.

He paused just outside the lighted area.¬† He suddenly felt very alone, out of his depth without Althea to guide him.¬† By now, he‚Äôd been in several taverns and‚Ä¶ other establishments‚Ä¶ but never alone with the two-legs.¬† *Althea - where are you?¬† Are you wondering where I went?¬† Are you missing me as well?*

He slowly shook his head in the dark.¬† *I have no reason to be afraid.¬† I can handle myself - I‚Äôm no lost little kit.¬† Not anymore.*

He stepped into the light, tail low behind him.¬† Screwing his confidence tight, he walked through the open door.¬† Inside there were many low tables, some with benches, and others even lower with cushions on the wooden floor.¬† Both humans and the river folk were dining, mostly in separate groups, but both humans and the folk were eating and laughing at one low table.¬† His ears flicked back and forth, trying to make out the conversations going on.

The air was full of laughter, and the sizzle of cooking from the kitchen, visible behind a counter in the back.¬† This was unlike any tavern Althea had taken him too.¬† Looking around the crowded room, he thought that the centaur would not fit well with the close dining arrangements.

Standing up on his hind legs to get a better look, Phineas spotted an empty table in a corner.¬† Dropping back down to all fours, he padded over and sat up on one of the cushions.¬† A printed page had a list of unfamiliar foods - one side in Marien, the other in a strange script he did not recognize.¬† It had broad strokes, trailing down the page instead of right to left.

‚ÄúFox welcome for to dine!‚Äù

Phineas looked up with a gasp.¬† One of the river folk in a blue apron was smiling at him, dark eyes twinkling.¬† She had a pad of paper in her partly webbed hand, ready with a stub of a pencil.

‚ÄúUm, hello there.‚Äù¬† *How do they do this?¬† Just ask for the food, then pay?*¬† Phineas felt embarrassed, realizing that Althea had been taking care of him in public.¬† He looked at the menu in his paws, not sure what to do.

When he looked back up, the waitress was still beaming at him, broad flat teeth showing.¬†

‚ÄúFox food know for to eat?‚Äù

Glancing down at the sheet again, he felt clueless.

‚ÄúUh, surprise me?‚Äù

The waitress tittered, writing on her pad.¬† She then walked away, moving quickly on her short legs towards the back.

Looking around the busy restaurant, Phineas wondered about the crowd.¬† *No one ever seems too terribly surprised to see the last talking fox in the world.¬† The early adventurers I used to trick back in the forest seemed shocked, but over time‚Ä¶ they didn‚Äôt.¬† It must be the magic Althea keeps talking about - my ‚Äòthing‚Äô messing with people‚Äôs heads.* ¬†He looked down at his tail, flexing it, thinking of the shadow second tail he‚Äôd seen in the mage‚Äôs office. ¬†*The waitress, though, she didn‚Äôt seem dulled by my ‚Äòthing‚Äô‚Ä¶*

His thoughts were interrupted by the return of the waitress, joined by another in a blue apron.¬† They were speaking rapidly in their foreign language, glancing at him and laughing.¬† With a bow, she set a plate and a bowl in front of him.¬† One plate had some kind of cooked fish with rice and vegetables.¬† The bowl was steaming, a rich smell of broth arising with curious vegetables and sprouts in a soup.

‚ÄúFood for to enjoy!‚Äù

The second waitress set a porcelain cup in front of him with a smile, then the two left.

Scanning the restaurant, Phineas noticed the river folk stealing glances at him, trying not to be noticed.¬† The humans seemed unaware of his presence, like usual.¬† *The ‚Äòriver folk‚Äô - are they human?¬† They sure seem like two-legs, but‚Ä¶ hmmpf.*

He couldn‚Äôt resist the smell of the food before him.¬† He stretched forward to start eating from the plate, but he froze, jaws open.¬† *You‚Äôre not a dumb animal.¬† Act like it.*

He grasped the utensils from the table in his paws.¬† They were too big, loudly dropping the fork against the delicate porcelain plate, but he managed.¬† As he started into the meal, he found the strange food utterly delicious.¬† The fish had a crispy brown layer, sweet and succulent.¬† The strange vegetables paired marvelously with the rice, all cooked together in an amazing sauce.¬† It wasn‚Äôt sweet, or salty.¬† It wasn‚Äôt sour or bitter.¬† He didn‚Äôt know the word for it - it was a rich, deep, savory flavor unlike anything he‚Äôd ever encountered.¬† His family‚Äôs meagre cooking - whatever they could grow or find in the forest - paled in comparison to the new world of flavor opened to him.

Tackling the soup with the comically oversized spoon, he did his best to not slurp it.¬† *I will not lap it up like a dog!*¬† Once the rumbling in his stomach had calmed, Phineas turned to the delicate white cup.¬† The hot, green substance had a pleasant, grassy scent. ¬†Carefully drinking it from the cup, there was slight bitterness, not nearly as harsh as the coffee this morning.¬† As he finished his meal, Phineas mused on all the things he‚Äôd missed, holed up in that distant forest his whole life.

Althea truly had saved his life.¬† *No matter what has happened since, I will always be in her debt.*

‚ÄúFood make for to happy fox?‚Äù¬† Phineas was startled by the waitress hovering above him.¬† The waitress seemed concerned; her thick brow furrowed.

For the first time this evening, Phineas cracked a smile for the girl.¬† ‚ÄúIt was delicious.¬† I‚Äôve never had anything like it.‚Äù

This caused her smile to return.¬† She pulled a new dish from behind her back.

‚ÄúSo to happy!¬† Make chef food special fox for to enjoy.‚Äù

She set the new plate in front of Phineas.¬† It held crispy blocks of an unknown white substance, set with large soft noodles and green onions in a brown broth.

The waitress winked a dark eye at Phineas.¬† ‚ÄúFood special old land, not menu for to order.¬† Charge not.‚Äù

She waited patiently, holding her breath for him to try the dish.¬† Behind her, Phineas noticed the chef watching as well from behind the counter.¬† Another river folk seemed to discreetly watch him as well.¬† This got his tail twitching uneasily, but the smell of the dish overcame his concerns.

Cutting open the golden block with a fork, the glistening white insides showed.¬† Taking a tentative bite, the sweet, flavorful food took him to another level.¬† It was like heaven on a plate.¬† He couldn‚Äôt help but dig in, demolishing the new plate with uncivilized speed.¬† He‚Äôd never tasted anything so wonderful before in his life.

Wiping his snout with a napkin, he realized the waitress was still at his table, along with the other from before.¬†

‚ÄúThank you, thank you so much.¬† That was amazing!¬† What was it?‚Äù

‚Äú*Kitsune udon.*‚Äù

The fox jolted at hearing that name aloud.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The dark alley engulfed Karstrom in a fetid smell as he searched for the correct door.¬† His contact in the city said he might know who would put up a bounty for the fox.¬† The old public Sylfan bounties for furfolk hadn‚Äôt been posted in decades - this had to be something different.¬† The dwarf knocked at the nondescript door, shifting uneasily in the dark.¬† He found his hand slowly reaching for his sword hilt, the hairs on the back of his neck standing up.

*I‚Äôd promised that horsey lass I‚Äôd look into that letter.*¬† He now thought that hadn‚Äôt been the best idea.

He heard shuffling behind the door.¬† Karstrom tensed up, waiting for an answer.¬† He strained, trying to listen for footsteps behind the closed door.¬† That focus on the door led to his utter surprise as large arms grabbed him from behind, pinning his arms as he was blinded by a black hood shoved over his head.¬† A sweet, chemical smell filled his nostrils as he passed out limp, fading into darkness.

1masaqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1masaqr/im_back_here_after_3_years_of_freedom/,I‚Äôm back here after 3 years of freedom,"3 years ago I had the first and worst gastric flare of my entire life. I was having issues with low iron and was told to take iron tablets on an empty stomach with orange juice by the GP. I might as well have drank battery acid. Anyway long story short I lost 2 stone of weight from the lack of being able to eat or home food down in 2 months they then sent me for an endoscopy. Took 9 months to come back with my biopsy. Came back as chronic non erosive gastritis. 

I spent 10 months on lansoprazole 15mg once a day. I did everything from BLAND diet to ginger tea with liquorice root, meditation. No caffeine quit smoking. I weaned myself off the medication and reintroduced foods and went back to normal life after around a year of sheer determination.


Turns out they forgot to tell me I was also celiac hence the low iron from before so obviously having to wait 9 months extra to find out did even more damage as I had to actually wait a year to go gf before the other tests were completed etc. 
So I‚Äôm now gluten free have been for around 8 months and recently the last 2 weeks I‚Äôve been getting the burning sensation and I keep thinking to myself please no but I‚Äôve been ignoring it out of ignorance thinking I‚Äôll be fine still drinking coffee with caffeine and not decaf the little things I don‚Äôt want to let go of as I was so restrictive last time. 

Well I went out for a meal yesterday and I can tell you know I‚Äôve woken up with that burning sensation in the sack of your stomach 10x the bubbling stomach. Tender to touch the gnawing pain. Feeling empty weak and just overall inflamed. So I‚Äôm gonna try and avoid PPIs this time round and go down the herbal route with slippery elm powder. 

Long story short if you feel it brewing address it. Don‚Äôt be me and wish it away because I‚Äôm not quite back to square one like last time but the pains bad enough to come back here to say hello once again. 

Also ask to get tested for celiac if you can as that can cause manage to the stomach lining too!

Some background. I started what I now know was an eating disorder after getting laid off in jan of 2019 and went on an overnight ""diet"" of very low intake and daily hours long bike rides. I lost a lot by late fall when i started a job. I would wake up early to get a ride in before work and usually another after work with the same restrictive intake. When lockdowns happened I lost what little control I had and enormously increased my riding per day on a restriction.  Frustrated that I was still ""Fat"" I accidentally learned that artificial sweeteners caused a laxative effect along with a coffee/caffeine intake that eventually got to where I could measure my daily intake in grams (for real..) I started ever increasing my fake sugar intake and added otc laxatives until it was fully out of hand. During this time my ""food"" didn't resemble food at all and was devoid of nutrients. This went on in one form or another until approximately fall of 23 when my new therapist basically said she couldn't help unless I could stop that otherwise I would be dead, disabled, or inpatient.

During this time I was fully avoiding treatment because I was worried if I was honest with my doctor I would get the help I should have gotten and I ""would have got fat""

I was experiencing near daily, crippling anxiety and panic attacks, muscle pain and leg cramps, joint pain, burning feet that I scratched to bleeding so bad my sheets would be stuck to them in the morning, balance issues, insomnia, irritability, depression, I was weak and constantly very tired and cold feeling, I became functionally illiterate (I could read a word or sentence but could not understand paragraphs), my vision was out of focus along with daily nystagmus and hallucinating flashes of blue and white light and thrumbing noises in my ears. I was delirious and could not think. I had to switch to children's audio books during bike rides because I couldn't make sense of adult literature, I had chronically numb hands and fingers and a tremor in my hands.

This went untreated for about 3 years.. I was intentionally trying to flush myself out every day as much as I could. intake eventually went up due to a binge/purge cycle but there was very little nutrient diversity. I never thought I was an alcoholic but there was problematic drinking at night for a large portion of this due to depression and anxiety. It wasn't "" a ton "" but it was for the wrong reasons and chronic.

I still struggle daily with eating well and needing to exercise but its probably a good 18 months now from the worst of it and I'm in recovery now but I've had many lasting effects. Depression, anxiety, and apathy/numbness. Not debilitating but regular balance and hand coordination issues. Drooping left eyelid and blurry left eye. Occasional slight horizontal nystagmus. And recently I've become more aware of ongoing memory problems, and most concerning is I've noticed I confidently ""remembering"" things that didn't happen or happened way different than I remember. There's big gaps in memories of things even in the last two years.

I actually did bring this up to my Psychiatrist two years ago but she immediately said no that for alcoholics, and I forgot about it until I found a purple wiki link last night while searching for memory issues in anorexia.

1mas9e7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1mas9e7/chronic_headache/,Chronic headache,"38m 
6‚Äô 
280lbs 

High cholesterol and major depressive disorder, both well maintained. I take Vilazodone(40mg daily) and Rosuvastatin (40 mg daily).


Apologies in advance for all the detail that follows. It‚Äôs been a long and frustrating journey. Bloodwork has been completed regularly throughout the last 5 years and aside from cholesterol ratios (low HDL) and low-ish testosterone (300-ish) results haven‚Äôt shown anything interesting.


I have been experiencing constant headaches for the last 5+ years. Onset was gradual with no obvious cause. Pain is almost always a 3, sometimes up to a 6, and never less than a 2. They are accompanied by dizziness, light headedness, brain fog, difficulty finding words, difficulty concentrating, and very mild tinnitus. No sensitivity to sound, lights, smells, etc.. the only time my discomfort is slightly improved is when I‚Äôm laying down. I have had occasional episodes of vertigo lasting from a few seconds to a couple of days. 3 episodes in the last 5 years, never prior.


Around the time of onset I did have a pinched nerve in my neck. Again no obvious onset here - slept on it funny or something. The associated tingling in the arm went away with physical therapy.


I saw a neurologist for the pinched nerve and he ordered a brain & spine MRI. Results were unremarkable except for the mildly slipped disc/pinched nerve in my neck. I saw another neurologist who tried treating the headache with a variety of medications, including but not limited to topiramate, NSAID, Sumatriptan, CGRP, and Botox. None of them lead to any improvement in symptoms whatsoever.


The neurologist posed that the symptoms may be related to the 2 anti-depressants I was taking at the time (Effexor & Wellbutrin). I tapered off of them (with psych approval) and had no improvement over the course of 6 months. I ended up starting back up on a ‚Äúnewer‚Äù antidepressant after that as a result of significant worsening in depression symptoms. I was referred to a cardiologist to see if it may be POTS or something else cardiology related. Cardiac ultrasound was normal. Stress test showed vasovagal syncope but negative for POTS. Around this time my psych thought perhaps my symptoms were anxiety related. I enrolled in an outpatient anxiety support group and found that while I could somewhat relate to some of the symptoms, my anxiety is exceptionally mild (nervous in social situations, avoid confrontation, etc.).


After that the psych tried to address the difficulty with attention using adderall. Interestingly, this was the most effective medication I took to improve any symptoms, but I found the downsides of the meds to be hard to overcome (trouble sleeping, short tempter, etc.). Eventually I got my PCP to refer me to a major academic university. I saw approximately 5 different neurologists there with varying specialties and was referred to a headache clinic. The headache clinic had me reduce caffeine intake (3 cups of coffee -> 2 or less daily). No improvement. They referred me for a sleep study. Sleep study showed mild sleep apnea. Got a CPAP and wore it daily for over a year with zero improvement to symptoms.
The headache clinic also referred me to a specialist who was doing a study related to spontaneous CSF leaks. Physician had me take some self-assessments at home and eventually suggested I would be a candidate for more invasive imaging (CT myleogram with contrast injected in the spine) followed by an epidural blood patch.


Although the imaging was negative, the doctor suggested I would still have a ~30% chance of having a CSF leak that didn‚Äôt show up in imaging. He identified a few areas that looked ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù. I ended up getting 4 different blood patches to attempt and fix the suspicious areas. Although I would have improvement in symptoms for a few days during recovery (I would lay flat), the improvement never lasted.


The academic medical center neurologist team also referred me to Otolarynogy for vestibular testing (VNG, vHIT, VEMP and rotary chair). Results showed very minor defects in vestibular function and I was referred for vestibular physical therapy. Completed ~6 months of rehab and didn‚Äôt notice any improvement of symptoms. BPPV and vestibular migraines were ruled out. There may be additional testing/treatment I‚Äôm forgetting at the moment.
I took a break from treatment and visits for the last ~6 months because I was honestly exhausted from all the appointments and lack of answers? But I‚Äôm ready to start up again and would like to find ways to either improve quality of life despite the symptoms (already doing CBT to address this), or actually get answers/ improve symptoms (daring to dream here).


I guess my question is‚Ä¶. Where the hell do I go from here? Is going back to the headache clinic at the academic medical center the right thing? Do I go back and see a neurologist again? Do I try and find some other resource?",1,1753637491.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I've been out to my family since I was a teenager, including to my brother, who is roughly a decade older than me.

My brother and his wife have a son (14) and a daughter (12).

My brother and I weren't super close growing up because of the age difference, but we had a healthy relationship. However, our relationship effectively ended when he married his wife, who is a massive homophobe. One of those holier-than-thou suburban types - think lots of iced coffee in a Stanley cup plus a giant cross necklace. Unsurprisingly, the wife and my butch ass did NOT get along, and whilst I was invited to the wedding, him marrying her functionally reduced our relationship to 'friendly at family events, no further contact'.

When they had kids, she stayed home, and the kids 100% took on her political views. The boy especially is HORRID. He's got unchecked access to the internet, seems to have fallen down that entire manosphere-rabbithole, and has said AWFUL stuff to my girlfriend and me. Slurs, 'this shouldn't be legal', the full shebang. The girl's more quiet about it, but I can feel her stare daggers into me whenever I kiss my girlfriend on the cheek, and she once asked me flat-out whether I was 'allowed' to be in a women's bathroom because I have short hair.

Last year, my brother's wife started experiencing major health issues. She's probably going to make it, but their entire life has been taken over by medical appointments. To his credit, my brother appears to have stepped up to caring for her pretty well. However, he also needs to keep working, and he's 100% overwhelmed. Our parents are experiencing health issues of their own and cannot take on the kids. Other friends seem to have disappeared into thin air.

He's begged me to help - specifically, to take the kids for a week this August so his wife can receive surgery. I told him flat-out I couldn't. The kids would have to live with my girlfriend and me. My girlfriend is shorter than the boy is these days, and last time she met him, he called her a slur. Even beyond safety concerns, these kids have been nothing but horrible to me and her. My brother swears they would 'behave', but I seriously don't want these kids in my house. I know this is is a terrible situation for them (their mother might die! seeing her in her post-surgery state might honestly be traumatic!) and they are children who aren't at fault for how they were raised, but that doesn't change the fact that the boy is the size of a grown man and honestly¬†*vitriolic*.

Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned whale hunter or a newbie sniping your first token launch, Maestro promises to simplify and supercharge your trading game. But does it deliver? In this comprehensive Maestro bot review, I‚Äôll break down its features, pricing, security, usability, and more‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbased on everything I know. Let‚Äôs dive in and see if this bot is your ticket to DeFi mastery or just another overhyped tool.

# What Is Maestro Bot? The¬†Basics

https://preview.redd.it/7xkzh1c1cgff1.png?width=422&format=png&auto=webp&s=e545ccf103c023d440bb178f08e0d91cc307b031

Imagine a trading assistant that lives in your Telegram app, ready to snipe tokens, track wallets, and mirror top traders‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääall without you leaving your chat window. That‚Äôs Maestro bot in a nutshell. Designed for DeFi enthusiasts, it‚Äôs a multi-chain trading bot that integrates with decentralized exchanges (DEXs) across blockchains like Solana, Ethereum, and Tron. It‚Äôs not your typical desktop app or clunky browser extension‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäMaestro leverages Telegram‚Äôs lightweight platform to bring trading to your fingertips, whether you‚Äôre on your phone at the coffee shop or lounging at home.

What sets Maestro apart? It‚Äôs not just about automation; it‚Äôs about giving traders‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänovices and pros alike‚Ää‚Äî‚Äätools to stay ahead in the chaotic crypto market. From sniping new token launches to watching whale moves, it‚Äôs built to handle the fast-paced, high-stakes world of DeFi. But as with any tool, the devil‚Äôs in the details. Let‚Äôs unpack what Maestro offers and whether it‚Äôs worth your time (and wallet).

# Features: What Can Maestro Bot¬†Do?

Maestro bot isn‚Äôt a one-trick pony. It‚Äôs packed with features that cater to different trading styles. Here‚Äôs a deep dive into what you get:

**1. Token Sniping: Speed Is the Name of the¬†Game**

If you‚Äôve ever tried to grab a token at launch, you know it‚Äôs a race against time‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand bots. Maestro‚Äôs sniping feature is its crown jewel, letting you jump into new listings across 10+ blockchains with lightning speed. You set your parameters‚Ää‚Äî‚Äälike how much to spend‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand Maestro does the rest. Chains supported include:

* Solana (SOL)
* Ethereum (ETH)
* Binance Smart Chain (BSC)
* Tron (TRX)
* Arbitrum (ARB)
* Avalanche (AVAX)
* Base (BASE)
* TON, Metis, and Linea

https://preview.redd.it/qsv98ac3cgff1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca1676e5d391dd31f22dea60652064d631ddcdf9

A recent twist? The introduction of¬†*Turbo Mode*¬†in its God Mode suite. This fully automates sniping‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääno confirmation needed‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämaking it a game-changer for those who want to set it and forget it. It‚Äôs a leap from the manual precision some traders might expect, and it‚Äôs surprisingly hands-off for such a high-stakes feature.

**2. Copytrading: Follow the¬†Money**

Not sure where to start? Maestro‚Äôs copytrading lets you mirror the moves of successful wallets. The free tier supports up to three wallets per chain, while the premium plan bumps that to 10. You can tweak settings‚Ää‚Äî‚Äälike matching gas fees or front-running trades‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto ride the coattails of market movers. It‚Äôs a brilliant way to learn from the pros without needing their playbook.

**3. Wallet Monitoring: Stay in the¬†Know**

The¬†*Wallet Bot*¬†tracks your assets and sends real-time price alerts, all within Telegram. Whether it‚Äôs a sudden dip or a moonshot, you‚Äôll know instantly. It‚Äôs simple but effective, cutting out the need for separate apps or constant manual checks.

**4. Whale Watching: Spot the Big¬†Fish**

Crypto markets often move with the whales. Maestro‚Äôs¬†*Whale Bot*¬†keeps tabs on significant transactions from wallets you‚Äôre watching, alerting you to potential opportunities. It‚Äôs like having a sonar for the DeFi ocean‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääquietly powerful.

**5. Buy Bot: Token Insights for¬†Free**

For token communities or investors, the¬†*Buy Bot*¬†tracks buys, sells, and price changes for up to two tokens at no cost. It‚Äôs a small but handy feature for staying updated on your favorite projects.

**6. Scraper Updates: Digging¬†Deeper**

A recent update to the¬†*Maestro Scraper*¬†lets it pull data from private Telegram channels, groups, and DMs on chains like Base and Solana. This isn‚Äôt just a gimmick‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit‚Äôs a way to unearth calls and insights from corners of the crypto world you might not otherwise access. It‚Äôs an unexpected perk that adds real value.

These features combine to make Maestro a Swiss Army knife for traders. But how does it stack up in practice?

# Blockchain Compatibility: A Multi-Chain Marvel

One of Maestro‚Äôs biggest strengths is its reach. Supporting over 10 blockchains, it‚Äôs not locked into one ecosystem. Whether you‚Äôre chasing Solana memecoins or Ethereum DeFi gems, Maestro integrates with DEXs across these networks, handling token swaps and trades seamlessly. This flexibility is a huge plus in a market where opportunities bounce between chains faster than you can say ‚Äúblock confirmation.‚Äù

# Pricing: Free Tier vs. Premium¬†Power

Maestro‚Äôs pricing is straightforward but comes with trade-offs:

**Standard Plan¬†(Free)**

* **Cost**: $0 upfront.
* **Catch**: A 1% fee on every successful trade, collected when it hits 0.01 BNB or ETH (pulled from your highest-balance wallet).
* **Features**: Basic sniping, three copytrade wallets per chain, eight concurrent trade monitors.

It‚Äôs a low-risk entry point‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääperfect for dipping your toes into automated trading without committing cash upfront.

**Premium Plan**

* **Cost**: $200/month.
* **Perks**: Faster trade execution, 10 copytrade wallets per chain, 30 concurrent trade monitors, plus extras like the¬†*Launch Simulator*¬†(for testing strategies) and¬†*Alpha Counter*¬†(for spotting trends).
* **Who‚Äôs It For?**: Serious traders who need speed and scale.

At $200/month, the premium tier isn‚Äôt cheap. For casual traders, the free plan might suffice, but if you‚Äôre moving high volumes or chasing razor-thin margins, the upgrade could pay off. It‚Äôs a classic ‚Äúyou get what you pay for‚Äù scenario‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthough that price tag might raise eyebrows.

# Security: Can You Trust¬†Maestro?

In crypto, security isn‚Äôt optional‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit‚Äôs everything. Maestro takes this seriously with a few standout measures:

**Anti-Rug Protection**

Maestro‚Äôs patented¬†*Anti-Rug*¬†feature is designed to outpace liquidity scams, a common pitfall in DeFi. It‚Äôs not foolproof (nothing is), but it‚Äôs a proactive shield that gives traders an edge against rug pulls.

**Exploit Recovery: A Case¬†Study**

In October 2023, Maestro faced a hiccup‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääan exploit in its Router 2 contract drained 280 ETH. What happened next? The team didn‚Äôt just patch it; they refunded users 610 ETH‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääover $1 million‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfrom their own revenue. That‚Äôs not a small gesture. It‚Äôs a signal of accountability that‚Äôs rare in the wild west of crypto. This move alone has cemented Maestro‚Äôs rep as a bot that backs its users.

**Scam Detection**

Built-in filters help spot shady tokens before you trade. It‚Äôs not a silver bullet, but it‚Äôs another layer of defense in a market full of traps.

Maestro‚Äôs security isn‚Äôt just talk‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit‚Äôs action. That refund story, in particular, sticks out as a testament to their priorities.

# User Experience: How Does It¬†Feel?

Setting up Maestro is a breeze. Link your wallet, tweak a few settings, and you‚Äôre trading in under 10 minutes. The Telegram interface is clean and intuitive‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääcommands flow like a conversation, and alerts pop up where you‚Äôre already looking. For mobile-first traders, it‚Äôs a dream.

That said, it‚Äôs not perfect. Relying solely on Telegram means no fancy desktop dashboard or multi-window setup. If you‚Äôre used to platforms like TradingView, it might feel restrictive. And navigating trade history‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääespecially recovering deleted trades‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääcan get fiddly. Still, for what it aims to be, Maestro nails the usability mark.

# Recent Updates: Keeping It¬†Fresh

Maestro isn‚Äôt resting on its laurels. Recent tweaks include:

* **Turbo Mode**: Fully automated sniping, no clicks required.
* **Scraper Expansion**: Now pulls data from Base and Solana private chats, broadening its intel net.

These updates show a team that‚Äôs listening and adapting‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääalways a good sign in a fast-moving space like crypto.

# Pros and Cons: The Big¬†Picture

# Pros:

* 10+ blockchain support
* Fast sniping and copytrading
* Proven security with refunds
* Quick setup, instant alerts

**Cons:**

* $200/month premium might sting
* 1% trade fee on free plan
* Telegram-only limits some flexibility
* Past exploit (though well-handled)

# Who Should Use Maestro¬†Bot?

* **Newbies**: The free tier and easy setup make it a low-barrier entry to DeFi trading.
* **Pros**: Premium features like Turbo Mode and extra wallet slots cater to high-volume traders.
* **Avoid If**: You‚Äôre on a tight budget or prefer desktop-heavy workflows.

# Final Verdict: Is Maestro Bot Worth¬†It?

Maestro bot is a standout in the crowded field of crypto trading tools. Its multi-chain reach, robust features, and security focus make it a compelling choice for DeFi traders. The free plan is a no-brainer for testing the waters, while the premium tier suits those ready to invest in their edge. Yes, the $200/month price might make you pause, and the Telegram-only vibe won‚Äôt suit everyone. But with a track record of refunding users after a breach and constant updates like Turbo Mode, Maestro proves it‚Äôs more than just hype‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit‚Äôs a tool with teeth.

So, should you try it? If you‚Äôre serious about DeFi and don‚Äôt mind the Telegram setup, absolutely. Just weigh your trading volume against the costs, and always‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää*always*‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääkeep your wits about you in crypto.

Brown, dark, red. And all moving up and down around all his wrists. No, those things are his wrists. Figure quickly stand up on his feet and sees his all body. He fully made of others living things. Creature could feel presence of hundreds, thousands of these beings. He making first step. Clumsy, but confident. For some reason he already could know how to walk, or he knew every single thing that was a part of him. Insects, spiders, scorpions, centipedes. How he could know this. Why figure even. He stoped upon seeing old rusty cane and picking it up. 

What is this feeling
Of power and drive
I've never known?
I feel alive!

Where does this feeling
Of power derive
Making me know
Why I'm alive?

He makes few steps around dark room and seeing that roof has a hole. Something was illuminating from it. Moonlight. Before going, figure picked up carefully made, little dusty bowler head.


Creature picked up and put on its head. And then jumped through to hole that had 16 meters difference between ground where he stood on few seconds ago. Creature stood on the roof observing moon. 


Like the night, it's a secret
Sinister dark and unknown
I do not know what I seek
Yet I'll seek it alone!

His blissful moment was broken upon hearing someone‚Äôs steps. Curiously he started to jump from one roof to another, like a little kid was jumping on puddles after rain. 


I have a thirst
That I cannot deprive
Never have I felt so alive!


He landed on ground full of snow. Around him were numerous old destroyed stores and shops. He used cane and started moving. Energetic, full of life and joy. Dancing around lamp posts and hitting cane upon ground in tact of his waltz. 


There is no battle
I couldn't survive
Feeling like this
Feeling alive!

Among shops, he saw one with wooden written big sign and broken windows along with door.

‚ÄúHenry‚Äôs and Earl. Fine clothes and coffee‚Äù 

Upon entering, insects being took carefully made long sleeved jacket and silk pants. Insects stared to crawl on his choices of clothing and forced them on night dance. Couldn‚Äôt he made any step, how he was already dressed. The only thing that wasn‚Äôt yet here, pair of shoes. How does he know everything of it? He made step out of store and once again spoke with a moon. 

Like the Moon, an enigma
Lost and alone in the night
Damned by some heavenly stigma
But blazing with light!


He jumped on one of buildings roof like a cricket and once again felt urge to find a source of this noises around him. Those steps. Metal in leather boots that made crusty noises upon stepping snow. Like a beetle getting squished by two fingers of 10 years boy. And he was this boy. No he will be a beetle that will squish that boy. And name. Well Henry is certainly fitting one.

It's the feeling of being alive!
Filled with evil, but truly alive!
It's the truth that cannot be denied!
It's the feeling of being
Henry Jacket

He let chuckle. And then he saw someone‚Äôs was moving down the street. Injured. With long hair and metal hands and legs. 


Wait!
What's this?
Sweet miss!
I thought I had lost you!

It's fate!
What bliss!
Sweet miss!
Your folly will cost you dear


Lady was walking with cut arm. She barely escaped sky demon attack. If it wasn‚Äôt for this worker drone with axe. She would be dead. Upon moving few streets, she felt like something was approaching her. Worker turn around and saw figure in elegant, but dirty suit. It wasn‚Äôt drone, something human. But why could she see without shadow filter. Miss wanted to run from stranger, how suddenly she was caught by bleeding hand. 

Henry finally found it. Source of noises. These shoes. He quickly touch worker legs, how suddenly they disappeared to dust upon freeze wind, expect leather shoes. She screamed, she wanted to run as fast as her arm could. Insect creature quickly shut her mouth and started to feast upon hand while slowly pressing against mouth, till scream were no more.
After feeding, bugs quickly dressed up Henry and he felt happiness he swear was almost impossible in how good and cathartic it was.

Animals trapped
Behind bars at the zoo
Need to run rampant and free!
Predator live by the prey they pursue
This time the predator's me!

Lust, like a raging desire
Fills my whole soul with its curse!
Burning with primitive fire
Berserk and perverse!

Suddenly he felt how someone was quickly approaching him. Few knives were flying towards his direction at high speed. No worker could thrown with such strength. How suddenly he quick punch towards face. Few insects were vanished with that and Henry was hit against the wall. But he wanted more. He enjoyed his life dancing between life and death. Like with that poor worker.

Tonight I'll plunder heaven blind
Steal from all the gods!
Tonight I'll take from all mankind
Conquer all the odds!


Attacker was holding in his arm an axe with clear intention of using it. Henry used cane and fought back. He was slower than that unknown in mask. But all axe slices were getting through him like a butter. Henry kicked already injured enemy upon old truck. And quickly was gliding though the road to pierce an enemy. But assaulter, managed to barely dodge it. Fight continued all across the street at lest for few minutes in futile attempts to kill each other 


And I fell I'll live on forever
With Satan himself by my side!
And I'll show the world
That tonight, and forever
The name to remember is
The name
Edward Hyde!


Henry tired to touch his opponent, expecting for same result. But nothing happened. Before him was a quick message 

‚ÄúFormation:Denied‚Äù 


Enemy pulled out mechanism similar to tickling old clock. Only on the other hand, there were black box connected via wires. Enemy managed to pierce bomb inside Henry‚Äôs chest. Opponent was ignoring bugs that were eating his arm. After click sound, masked one jumped with eaten away arm. but in last second Henry managed to cut mask‚Äôs half.  


Bug master was trying to get that device away, but it was too late. It blown up, Henry felt last agony of every insect that died because of explosion. And yet he survived. Bugs quickly denied his body a new, in torn clothes revealing crawling crusted all around. Enemy was no longer here. Escaped but living half of wooden carved mask.

‚ÄúYou will be harder to kill than most. But hear this, oh wretched machine. I Will make you all life never ending spectacle and will drag every other bystander as actors for it! Cause this is what, Henry Jacket is!‚Äù 

Cold rabid laugh was heard around empty streets. Among city that had no humans. Only a surgeon, a shadow that towers above any normal mortal. 

With this feeling of being alive!
There's a new world I see come alive!
It's a truth that cannot be denied!

I leave it to you to analyze and understand how these were arrived at, and would appreciate if any of the budding researchers offer their candid opinion after thorough analysis \(to their satisfaction\) and not merely spitting some statement!](https://preview.redd.it/8un05xlk7gff1.png?width=474&format=png&auto=webp&s=64010981ee26e9fe9a18528af49286d5244a9e12)

**Assumption**

30% of OBC-NCL & EWS are within the R1-cut-off for GEN (CRL) 3299.  I don't have the complete data for SC/ST and hence in my earlier post I assumed that to be 30%, now here it is dealt with more care & conservatism!  Figure out what I mean.

**Scenarios that would dictate the final cut-off ranks**

(a) IITM cut off ranks were 816 & 605 for the two programs.

(b) Bhopal BTech & Kolkata Data Sciences - 140 + 30 seats might have attracted more students.  All the top kids have been offered the BTech and DS as well.  Will there be any movement in their list, would the entire lot move out of BSMS or some would consider - all are unknown. On the other side, there has been a strong negative propaganda on the BTech program, which may or may not have any big influence on this, I guess.

(c) How many NEET, JEE, CSAB, State University BTech, BITSAT etc., etc., students and their movement would dictate the number of rounds.  The counselling can end in 3 or it can go to as high as 5 (my wild guess, as the rankers between  4000 & 10000 would grab the opportunity at the first instance).  There was enough discouragement (unfortunately it happened) given to the IISER aspirants, with a fear creation on the job market / financial stability fronts.  This might influence the cut-off ranks adversely.

(d) It is quite possible that on seeing the surge in numbers many kids would have decided against registering for counselling, especially those who were above 7000 or 8000.  If so, the would drift the counselling process and thus the cut-off ranks further.

One final **ADVISE** to all the kids here (I am not an IISER aspirant, and I am just a number enthusiast).  Don't go into fear mode. Don't be complacent.  Don't merely look at the final numbers or what finally you want - rather explore the intermediate & analyse.  As a researcher your need to develop the skills.  Share your views with folks without fear of failure, and you are bound to be successful.

I don't mind if all my above analysis goes for a toss.  I made an attempt as an outsider, just to provide some insights to the kids in these testing times!

Hope to see some of you sometime somewhere in the globe and have a chat over a cup of coffee! :-D

1mas506,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mas506/health_coach_preying_on_vulnerable_people/,Health Coach Preying on Vulnerable People,"A curvy friend of mine told me she saw a flier for weight loss coaching on a coffee shop door. She messaged the woman who set up a free consultation. The consultation was unusual because it was 2 HOURS LONG. The woman spoke very candidly about tough things in her own life right away. My read was that she was trying to be vulnerable and build a personal connection quickly with my friend. Eventually it comes out that her technique is to microdose clients with magic mushrooms and then do talk therapy to work through the underlying trauma that leads to overeating. My friend asked what kind of therapist credentials the woman had and she told her it was better that she didn‚Äôt have credentials (I forget exactly the ‚Äúreasoning‚Äù) when my friend asked what the cost of the program was, the woman said $4500. My friend balked. She added there would be a $1500 ‚Äúdiscount‚Äù if my friend wrote a positive review for her. My friend balked again and tried to get off the zoom call. Then the woman got aggressive and told her ‚ÄúYou will never lose weight if you don‚Äôt do this. This is the only thing that will work. You will continue to struggle forever.‚Äù I was proud my friend didn‚Äôt fall into this woman‚Äôs trap, but I feel so angry that this woman is painting herself as a spiritual guide and guru while taking advantage of women who are in vulnerable positions. I feel like her aggression was meant to awaken the inner critic voice in people‚Äôs head and it‚Äôs kind of cult leader vibes to tell people you are the only one who can fix them? I feel the need to do something to protect other people from her scammy tactics. I have even thought about reporting her to the police, but I do know she is a mom and I would feel bad for her kids if she went to prison for selling shrooms. I dunno, would you step in?

1mas45u,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerStationHub/comments/1mas45u/why_choose_the_jabra_evolve2_65_for_professional/,Why Choose the Jabra Evolve2 65 for Professional Wireless Audio?,"The Jabra Evolve2 65 headset, model number 26599-999-989, has been my daily companion for the past month, and I‚Äôve genuinely formed an interesting love-hate relationship with it. As someone who oscillates between video meetings, long hours of focus-driven tasks, and blasting playlists to drown out the world, I put this thing through its paces, testing more features than I thought a headset could have. Spoiler alert: there‚Äôs a lot to like, but there are a few quirks that can‚Äôt be ignored.

**Comfort That Lasts Through Marathon Days**

The over-the-head design is a common sight, but this headset took comfort to another level. The ear cups feel perfectly cushioned‚Äînot too firm, not overly soft‚Äîand the lightweight build at just 6.2 ounces meant I forgot I had them on at times. My colleague tried them during a long brainstorming call, and even she (practically a headphone critic herself) raved about how they didn‚Äôt pinch or feel too warm after hours of wear. Small bonus: the headpiece adjusts well even for those of us with oddly-shaped noggins.

**Winning Points**

- Exceptional lightweight feel for prolonged use  
- Cushioned ear cups that strike the right balance  
- Zero discomfort, even after hours of back-to-back meetings  

[Check Jabra 26599-999-989 price on Amazon.](https://cavenyc.com/p/b086mdfpwz/)  

**Audio That Lives Up to the Hype**

Let‚Äôs talk sound because, honestly, that‚Äôs where this headset flexes. The active noise cancellation does an admirable job of cutting through distractions. I tested it in a chaotic open office, where the coffee machine and coworker chatter usually intrude, but everything melted into silence as soon as the headset turned on. Its 40mm dynamic drivers punched out sound with such clarity I could pick up even minor details in my favorite tracks. Calls were another story‚Äîa positive one. The voice quality left no room for ‚Äúcan you repeat that?‚Äù moments, and colleagues frequently complimented how clear I sounded.

**Negatives**

- The noise cancellation, though solid, doesn‚Äôt entirely kill lower frequency sounds  
- Microphone performance is great indoors but not ideal if used in windy environments  

**The Battery That Refuses to Quit**

It‚Äôs infuriating how often I forget to charge my devices, but the battery life on this headset blows most competitors out of the water. Claimed to run for up to 37 hours, I managed to get close to that while juggling phone calls and Spotify all week. The inclusion of a charging stand isn‚Äôt just functional‚Äîit feels downright luxurious. Slipping the headset onto its stand at the end of a day felt borderline therapeutic! One more tester (my teenage cousin) used it for gaming and noted the battery held steady even after a marathon session.

**Buttons, Bluetooth, and Beyond**

The push-button controls might feel old school in a world dominated by touch gestures, but they‚Äôre refreshingly straightforward. Adjusting volume or ending a call doesn‚Äôt require me to play guessing games or consult a manual. Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity made pairing with my laptop and phone seamless, and the impressive 30-meter range meant I could grab a cup of tea without dropping conversations. That said, connecting to multiple devices simultaneously felt a touch less intuitive than expected.

**Competing Brands**

The comparison wouldn‚Äôt be complete without addressing how this stacks up against big names like Bose 700 or Sony WH-1000XM5. While the sound quality of the Jabra Evolve2 65 is undeniably professional, the noise cancellation doesn‚Äôt quite reach the level of Sony‚Äôs precision or Bose‚Äôs industry dominance. On the flip side, this Jabra headset crushes them in terms of all-day comfort and practical features like the charging stand. It feels genuinely tailored for work-life balance, especially for professionals hopping between calls and music breaks.

**Cost Efficiency**

Considering its professional feature set, the price isn‚Äôt what I‚Äôd call ‚Äúentry-level,‚Äù but I do think it‚Äôs worth the extra cash for the everyday convenience it brings. The battery and call quality alone make it a strong contender over similarly priced options, especially for work-focused users. While there are cheaper Bluetooth headsets out there, many of them compromise on wearability or sound quality, which this clearly does not.

üö®\*\*Warning: This text may cause an acute craving for cheese!\*\*üö®

Cheese is way more important than God. I‚Äôd even go as far as saying that any kind of food is more important than God. I mean, sure, maybe there is some kind of deity out there, and maybe if you follow the right rules (whatever those are), you‚Äôll land in some kind of heaven ‚Äì unless you picked the wrong set of rules and someone else was right, in which case: welcome to hell. Quite a gamble, right? But if life is finite and there‚Äôs no afterlife, no creator thingy, then food is essential. If you want to live well and enjoy cheese ‚Äì you should not skip the cheese. That‚Äôs why, logically, cheese is more important than God.

Just like any solid religion, cheese has denominations. Followers argue, reconcile, eat together ‚Äì and steal cheese from each other‚Äôs fridge. This religion encourages culinary pilgrimages across the land: every 20 kilometres, there‚Äôs a new cheese. And when you choose a favourite, it often says something about you. Whether you promote it depends on whether you're willing to share it.

***Even cream cheese is still cheese ‚Äì or so they say. What‚Äôs your take? Is cream cheese real cheese or just a spread?***

Personally, I switch denominations. Right now, smoked cheese is in the lead. Blue cheese has taken a back seat ‚Äì though it was dominating my life for a while. Smoked cheese (without ham these days, though I liked it with ham as a kid) is currently a shopping essential ‚Äì sale or no sale.

I can‚Äôt talk about my cheese obsession without confessing this: Have you heard of Marc-Uwe Kling‚Äôs ‚ÄúApocalyptic Processed Cheese‚Äù in *The Kangaroo Chronicles*? Highly recommend the audiobooks ‚Äì Kling narrates them himself, and it‚Äôs gold. Now for the confession: I eat processed cheese. Both the creamy spreadable kind (the kind that comes in wedges or tubs ‚Äì especially the blue cheese hybrid, which is probably full of chemicals and delicious) and those individually wrapped cheese slices that produce a ridiculous amount of waste. The latter I eat folded, straight out of the wrapper. Melting them is rare. As Kling said ‚Äì this stuff is immortal. It will outlive humanity. It might one day evolve into a sentient species. It‚Äôs chemical-laden, plastic-packed, probably made from milk of tortured cows ‚Äì and I still eat it. I‚Äôm a helpless victim of the hyper-processed food industry.

***Do you know that feeling? Is there a food you‚Äôre a little ashamed of but still love? Or are you a secret processed cheese fan too? Tell me, I‚Äôm curious!***

# The ""Everyday Cheeses""

Camembert, Brie, young Gouda ‚Äì all basic groceries. Not passionate love, but solid relationships. Reliable staples in the fridge.

Mozzarella is another story. There's even this infamous ‚Äúinhaling mozzarella‚Äù scene from a German YouTuber called Drachenlord ‚Äì not exactly appetising. I prefer my mozzarella chopped into chunks. It's a great cold snack, especially in warm weather. While it's tasty with tomatoes and basil, I usually eat it straight. And most importantly: on pizza, it‚Äôs got to be grated mozzarella. No Emmental, please.

Buffalo mozzarella beats the cow version. I eat it cold, plain ‚Äì summer heaven. How do you eat yours?

Cooked cheese is very regional in Germany. The supermarket versions are mostly disgusting. But homemade ‚Äì like the one my younger sister or her mother-in-law makes ‚Äì is divine. Texture and flavour are very personal here.

***Cream cheese? Fine. Especially herb or chilli-paprika types. Works great as a tortilla dip. Not a favourite, but acceptable. Cottage cheese? Edible. Rarely exciting.***

Hard cheese like Parmesan and Grana Padano? Big love. You can break it, slice it, snack on it. Pasta needs it. Ageing improves the flavour. And I ignore best-before dates.

Slice cheese (aka ‚Äúcheese with holes‚Äù like Emmental, Leerdammer, Edam, Tilsit)? Not a favourite ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt taste like ‚Äúreal cheese‚Äù to me. But there‚Äôs one exception: a pretzel bun with butter and cheese. Slice it open, spread butter, add cheese slices, top with raw onion rings and sweet paprika powder. Put the top back on. I love the crunchy onions and the taste. It‚Äôs a childhood memory ‚Äì carnival events in gym halls and such.

**Pretzel bun, butter, hole cheese, raw onions, paprika ‚Äì that‚Äôs my childhood in hand-held form.** Got any food memories like that?

# Feta? Absolutely.

My go-to summer salad: cube tomatoes and feta, mix with vinegar, oil, seasoning. Let it sit for at least an hour so the cheese softens into a creamy marinade. Optional: diced unbreaded chicken or turkey. Real feta is sheep or goat milk. Cow milk = fake feta. Accept no substitutes.

# Europe Is Cheese Mecca

Almost every European country has its own cheeses, regional specialities, and traditions: grilled, baked, brined, or eaten raw. France is infinite. Switzerland is more than holey cheese. Italy embeds cheese into its entire food culture. Even the UK ‚Äì not famous for gourmet food ‚Äì has amazing cheese like Cheddar and Stilton. There‚Äôs more cheese here than I can remember.

Wherever you go in Europe, you find greatness. **Have you ever discovered a cheese you can‚Äôt forget?**

# Personal Recipes & Anecdotes

**Hand Cheese with Music (my version)**  
Basic version: plain Limburger, sliced and placed in a bowl. Add vinegar-water mix, seasoning (I use a German fish spice blend), and chopped onions. Let sit covered for 1‚Äì5 hours at room temp. Serve on fresh bread. Best with lots of onions.

# A Few Notes from a Cheese Addict

1. The worst enemy of a cheese lover is not a non-cheese-eater, but another cheese lover in your household. You buy your favourite cheese, look forward to it, and someone eats it. The worst: they leave the last piece. Cowardly. My tip: Don‚Äôt leave the last piece. If you finish it, own it. Maybe just live with non-cheese people ‚Äì safer.
2. I don‚Äôt drink milk. I go for overpriced pea milk ‚Äì it‚Äôs neutral in coffee. Strange how someone can love cheese and hate milk, but here we are.
3. Everything gets better when baked with cheese. **Fact.**
4. Exotic faves: flower-crusted cheese, market herb blends, wasabi cheese, chilli cheese (hello, Chili Cheese Nuggets ‚Äì yes, I go to Burger King just for those). Also: cheese with nuts ‚Äì because calories are better in clusters. Vegan cheese? Often edible, rarely delicious.
5. One last question: Do you buy BabyBel for the cheese ‚Äì or for the wax?

***Are you already eating cheese? On your way to buy some? If not ‚Äì go! And if you‚Äôve found a vegan alternative that‚Äôs actually awesome, let me know ‚Äì I haven‚Äôt found any yet. Let‚Äôs talk cheese. Disagree all you want ‚Äì it‚Äôs a religion. We‚Äôre allowed to fight over it.***

# Glossary ‚Äì for Cheese is Way More Important Than God

**Marc-Uwe Kling**  
German author and comedian, best known for *The Kangaroo Chronicles* ‚Äì a satirical book series about a talking, leftist kangaroo living with the narrator. Hugely popular in Germany, especially the audiobooks, which Kling narrates himself.

**""Apocalyptic Processed Cheese""**  
A running gag in *The Kangaroo Chronicles*, referencing the unnaturally long shelf life of industrial cheese. It's a metaphor for our chemically enhanced food industry.

**Drachenlord**  
Nickname of Rainer Winkler, a controversial German YouTuber. Infamous for chaotic livestreams and public conflict. Known for the bizarre ‚Äúinhaling mozzarella‚Äù scene. A case study in German internet culture and trolling.

**Fasching**  
Southern German version of Carnival or Mardi Gras. Features costumes, parades, silly humour. Celebrated mostly in February. For many, linked to childhood memories.

**Leerdammer, Edamer, Emmentaler, Tilsiter**  
Mild semi-hard cheeses popular in German-speaking countries. Called ‚Äúhole cheese‚Äù because of their appearance. Basic sandwich cheeses. Not typically ‚Äúintense‚Äù in flavour.

**Handk√§se mit Musik**  
Regional Hessian sour milk cheese dish marinated with vinegar and onions. ‚ÄúMusic‚Äù refers jokingly to the flatulence caused by raw onions. A polarising German classic.

**Limburger**  
Strong-smelling cheese. Not the traditional base for Handk√§se, but works. Pungent due to bacteria. Popular in some households, hated in others.

**Pretzel bun with butter and hole cheese**  
A 1990s Franconian snack: cut open a soft pretzel roll, add butter, mild cheese, raw onions, sweet paprika. Popular at events and school festivals, especially during Fasching.

**Grana Padano / Parmesan**  
Hard aged Italian cheeses with a salty, sharp taste. Often grated on pasta. Grana Padano is slightly milder than Parmesan.

**Feta vs. ‚Äúfake feta‚Äù**  
Only sheep or goat milk cheese from Greece can legally be called ‚ÄúFeta‚Äù in the EU. Cow milk versions = impostors.

**Pea milk**  
Plant milk made from split yellow peas. Creamy and mild. A dairy-free option for coffee.

**BabyBel**  
Wax-coated mini cheese snacks. Tasty enough, but also fun to play with.

That said, like every product, it does have considerations we‚Äôll dive into.  

**Compact yet Reliable Build**  
What stood out immediately was how lightweight the cooktop is. At just 4.4 pounds, it‚Äôs easy to carry around, and the rigid carrying case included has come in handy more times than I can count. Despite its featherweight, the aluminum body feels robust and gives off a reassuring durability. The compact dimensions of 11.9"" by 13.3"" by 3.7"" make it ideal for limited space, whether you‚Äôre lugging it to a campsite or working in a small kitchen. However, I find that the glossy metallic finish retains smudges quite easily, so frequent cleaning is essential to maintain its pristine appearance.  

**Key Benefits**  
- The burner reaches a high output of 15,000 BTU, cooking meals faster than many competitive models.  
- Its wind-protective design ensures steady flames, whether outdoors on a breezy evening or counter-top by a gusty window.  
- The magnetic locking mechanism is incredibly straightforward. No more fiddling with levers, and it‚Äôs practically foolproof when attaching fuel.

**Performance and Heating Efficiency**  
What truly sets this cooktop apart is the advanced heat panel. I‚Äôve tested it during extended cooking sessions, and it ensures every last bit of fuel in the 8-oz butane canister gets used up efficiently. Forget the frustration of switching out canisters with leftover gas‚Äîthis burner leaves no waste. The heat it generates is evenly distributed, making it versatile for all kinds of pots and pans. I even roasted marshmallows evenly using it, much to my kids' delight.  

That said, the cooktop gets quite warm after extended periods, particularly underneath. If you‚Äôre a fan of marathon cooking sessions, make sure to use it on a heatproof surface or invest in a durable heat mat to avoid any potential risks.  

**Safety Features You Can Rely On**  
The automatic safety shutoff mechanism deserves an enthusiastic mention. A few months ago, I accidentally over-tightened a butane canister on another burner, which led to a nerve-wracking leak. With this stove, the peace of mind that comes with the automatic pressure-sensitive shutoff is unbeatable. The device extinguishes the flame immediately if it detects unsafe pressure levels in the canister. This feature isn‚Äôt just a nice bonus; it‚Äôs absolutely essential for families, campers, and anyone new to portable cooktops.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The aluminum body, while sturdy, is prone to scratches if not handled carefully.  
- Cleaning around the burner can be a bit fiddly since food spills easily find their way into the nooks surrounding the element.  
- It doesn‚Äôt come with a butane canister, so be prepared to purchase those separately.  

**Ease of Use and Setup**  
I was pleasantly surprised by how intuitive the setup process is. All it takes is aligning the fuel can onto the magnet‚Äîno awkward levers or additional tools required. The push-button ignition means no need for lighters or matches, which is a small but meaningful touch. I‚Äôve even let my tech-challenged friend borrow it for her road trip, and she had no issues operating it.  

Still, there‚Äôs a minor gripe: the provided instruction manual isn‚Äôt as comprehensive as it could be. While the operation is straightforward for seasoned users, beginners may initially want a bit more hand-holding.  

**Other Options**  
When it comes to portable single-burner cooktops, the Iwatani 35FW faces rivalry from brands like GasOne and Camp Chef. GasOne models, for instance, offer competitive BTU ratings but often lack the same efficient magnetic locking or windbreaker features. Camp Chef stoves, on the other hand, tend to lean heavier, which can be a disadvantage when portability is key. Where this Iwatani burner truly shines is its innovative safety features and the fuel-efficient heat panel. Competitors either over-engineer or miss the mark here, which makes this stove stand out as a well-balanced choice.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
Having tested similar butane cooktops in this category, I can confidently say the price-to-quality ratio here is impressive. It delivers unbeatable performance with its high heat output and practical features, making the investment worthwhile. Sure, there are cheaper burners on the market. However, sacrificing essential safety elements like automatic shut-off and wind protection isn‚Äôt worth it for a minor cost-cut.

1marvid,https://i.redd.it/rz6odfvl9gff1.jpeg,The Shaun Murphy Paradox: Why AI Doesn't Need to be a Genius to Annihilate Junior Dev Jobs.,"**TL;DR:**¬†A new video shows an AI replacing junior analysts. People are arguing about whether AI is ""smart"" or not. That's the wrong question. AI is like Dr. Shaun Murphy from ""The Good Doctor"": a superhuman genius at memory and pattern-based tasks (like the 60% of programming work that is repetitive CRUD), but a complete amateur at common sense and real-world interaction. The problem is, companies don't hire juniors for their common sense; they hire them to do the repetitive work. And at that, the machine is already better.

# The Gist (Coffee Chat Version)

Alright folks, you've probably seen the video making the rounds of the ""AI that will replace junior analysts."" The usual debate is whether AI is a ""genius"" or if it's still just spewing well-packaged bullshit. But I think we're looking at this all wrong.

**AI doesn't need to be a genius. It just needs to be good at the most boring, repetitive tasks. And in that arena, it's already wiping the floor with us.**

Let's think about programming. What's the first job you get when you join a company as a junior dev? They stick you on CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete). It's the grunt work. It's all about patterns, connecting a form to a database. Our own research shows this can be anywhere from 20% to 60% of an average programmer's job. It's the most mechanical and least creative part of the work.

And this is where the perfect analogy comes in:¬†**AI is Dr. Shaun Murphy from ""The Good Doctor.""**

Think about it. Shaun Murphy is basically ChatGPT in a human body.

* **Superhuman Competence in a Closed Domain:**¬†You throw a rare symptom at him, and he'll recite three papers from Finland published in 1998 that describe it. He has a photographic memory of all medical literature. In tasks that depend on recognizing patterns in a massive database, he's unbeatable.
* **Subhuman Incompetence in an Open Domain:**¬†Now, ask him to deliver bad news to a family, navigate a power struggle with a boss, or make a decision with incomplete, ambiguous information in the middle of a chaotic surgery. That's where his system crashes. He doesn't get context, he has no social intelligence, no common sense.

Today's AI is exactly the same. It's a genius at repetitive tasks where there are millions of examples to learn from (like CRUD code). It can write a full CRUD implementation in 30 seconds because it has seen a billion of them on GitHub. That's its ""medical specialty.""

But ask it to design a novel software architecture for a problem no one has ever solved, or to negotiate project requirements with a difficult client. That's where it starts to bullshit, to hallucinate, to show that it doesn't ""understand"" anything.

Here's the problem:¬†**Companies don't hire juniors for their common sense or their negotiation skills. They hire them to grind out the repetitive code.**¬†And for that specific task, the silicon ""Dr. Shaun Murphy"" is faster, cheaper, and doesn't complain. The narrative that AI is a ""genius"" is a smokescreen. We don't need a genius to replace us. We need a machine that's very, very good at being mediocre and repetitive. And that machine is already here.

# The Deeper Analysis (The Professional Take)

The discussion about whether LLMs are ""geniuses"" or ""stochastic parrots"" is academically interesting, but it obscures the real mechanism of labor displacement in the software industry. The impact doesn't come from an emerging general intelligence, but from superhuman competence in a very specific and massive subset of tasks: pattern-based programming.

**1. The Structural Vulnerability of Enterprise Software:**  
Our research indicates that the vast majority of software development (\~85%) is focused on business applications, and the fundamental architecture of nearly all of these is CRUD. This means a substantial portion of the work for more than half of all developers (full-stack and back-end) is, by its nature, highly structured and repetitive. This is the ""closed domain"" where AI, much like Dr. Shaun Murphy with medical literature, can operate with superhuman efficiency‚Äînot through deep reasoning, but through pattern recognition on a massive scale.

**2. Replacement Doesn't Require Perfection, Just ""Good Enough"" Efficiency:**  
AI doesn't need to be perfect to be disruptive. It just needs to be ""good enough"" at the most common tasks to change the economic calculation of hiring. If an LLM can generate 80% of a CRUD module with 90% accuracy, the time a senior developer needs to supervise and correct the remaining 10% is drastically less than the time it would take a junior to write it from scratch.

**3. The Mechanism: Labor Consolidation and The Death of the Talent Pipeline:**  
This leads directly to¬†**labor consolidation**. Companies won't fire all their programmers. They'll do something more subtle: they'll ""augment"" their seniors with these tools, allowing a single senior to oversee the code production that previously required a team of several juniors.  
The direct consequence is the¬†**death of the talent pipeline**. With CRUD tasks being the traditional training ground for junior developers, their automation destroys the primary mechanism for creating new talent. This creates a long-term crisis: how do you get senior architects of the future if they never had the chance to be juniors?

**4. The ""Genius"" Narrative as a Smokescreen:**  
The promotion of AI as a ""genius"" that can solve complex problems is, in many cases, hype. But paradoxically, the real threat doesn't come from this supposed genius. It comes from its much less advertised, but far more real, ability to be a¬†**master of repetitive mediocrity**.

The public debate focuses on whether AI can replace an elite software architect (which is difficult), when the real economic impact lies in its ability to replace the hundreds of thousands of programmers who spend a large part of their day on standardized tasks. AI is not a genius, but it is the most efficient software factory worker ever created. And in an industry obsessed with efficiency, that's all that matters.",0,1753636582.0,accelerate,0,0.25,False

What about decaf americanos I can hear the well caffeinated ask?  Well firstly I'm jealous, I wish I could drink as much caffeine as you do.  Secondly decaf Americanos by default are too weak, more expensive and taste terrible due to the weakness.  To get them to taste good requires adding shots which makes it outrageously expensive or reducing the water which is complicated for the Barista's (apparently).  

Decaf drinkers just need one hopper.  Likely will cause zero interference to the caffeinated.  Just one for decaf drinkers, whatever their reason may be.  If you agree please contact Starbucks and leave a suggestion that they dedicate one hopper to decaf.  If you know any management folks at Starbucks suggest it to them.

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I‚Äôm really not interested I don‚Äôt know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I‚Äôm now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I‚Äôve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I‚Äôve never really dated and I‚Äôve never been on dating apps.

 I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I‚Äôd like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You‚Äôll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is ages between 25 and 32 and please have maturity and decency many thanks. 

I‚Äôm generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don‚Äôt have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy.

I also don‚Äôt like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face¬† I am not that type of guy. I also don‚Äôt like those that think it‚Äôs okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.¬† 

I am not one that is into partying I don‚Äôt like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I‚Äôm not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going¬† to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I‚Äôm very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands¬† love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I‚Äôve seen most of my favourite bands live too I‚Äôve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she‚Äôs a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she‚Äôs absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don‚Äôt work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I‚Äôve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I‚Äôm not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won‚Äôt be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don‚Äôt fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I‚Äôm very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I‚Äôm in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I‚Äôm always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don‚Äôt aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don‚Äôt watch reality tv. I don‚Äôt watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I‚Äôd never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don‚Äôt wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair.

I've always been a pretty lonely person (and I liked it), but right now I could use a conversation, sharing a coffee, a walk, or just talking about anything with someone.

I am open to inviting you a coffee or something to snack on, if anyone is interested, please message me without any shame.

As a curious fact, I like many things:
‚Äì Anime and series
‚Äì Movies and books
‚Äì Video games
‚Äì Running and gym
‚Äì I like to read and learn

It's been a month, despite her being active, the message hasn't been read. I did drop her an email to follow up but no response either. So I guess I've been ghosted?

I was a little confused as she seemed rather keen - we verbally shared schedules, preference for weekday / weekends and where we were usually based for work. Does this happen with INFJs? I'm an INFJ myself, felt like I would have responded differently if I wasn't keen.

Let's dive into it!

**Forestcraft**

*Beneath the Royal Oaks, where the first pact between the Fairies and the Great trees of Forestcraft was forged. The price paid for it though, is recorded nowhere. On a less ominous day, we find Titania eating cake carefully served by a Fairy maid, once human, while reading the latest report from Cynthia on the state of the Fairy army. Nothing new as they continue to not be able to hold a weapon larger than a toothpick, but Cynthia believes that one day she'll achieve progress! She just needs another millenium*

Forestcraft in the Second week finds itself still seeing competitive play with Roach still being able to hit above its weight, but in general the popularity of the class has fallen a bit off in the current metagame. Fairy Forest has re-classified as Tempo Forest as that is what everyone else calls it and does better describe the actual strategy of the deck.

**[Roach Forest](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.1.cCNE.cCNE.cCNE.cCQM.cCQM.cCQM.cabE.cabE.cabE.cao2.cao2.cao2.capI.capI.capI.cb1M.cb1M.cb1M.cb1W.cb1W.cb1W.cb1g.cb1g.cb1g.cb1q.cb1q.cb1q.cb2w.cb2w.cb2w.czCO.czCO.czCO.czFM.czFM.czFM.czU-.czU-.czhe.czhe)**

A combo deck built around the roach.  No real changes this week from what i can tell. Decks largely remain the same as there is less room to experiment, partly due to the metagame, partly due to the what was provided in the set. The deck is seeing some success at Tournaments still, but on ladder, the decks higher skill requirement does hold it back in terms of popularity. Not a deck i'd recommend to newer players.

**[Tempo Forest](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.1.cC7c.cC7c.cC7c.cCNE.cCNE.cCNE.cCQM.cYqk.cYqk.caY6.caY6.caY6.cabE.cabE.cabE.canu.canu.canu.cb1W.cb1W.cb1W.cb1g.cb1g.cb1g.cb1q.cb1q.cb1q.cbG-.cbG-.cbG-.cxFE.cxFE.czCO.czCO.czCO.czFM.czFM.czRs.czRs.czRs)**

A tempo deck built around Faeries and running down the opponent with them.  Gaining a more concrete form as it has shifted into Tempo Forest, the deck has cut out some of the more slow and value oriented elements to pursue a more aggressive approach and set up for big tempo swings. Not a top tier competitive deck, it does enjoy some success on the ladder, especially at lower ranks..

---

**Swordcraft**

*Beyond the massive and ornately crafted gate of the Fortress of Swordcraft. Gildaria is racking up accolades to a degree that has left the various Sword leaders just a bit concerned that she might be drawing unwanted attention. Though Silvarius seems to think that's great, Maria and Albert are less enthusiastic, especially after Albert had all of his banners sliced in half by Gildaria as entertainment for the troops. Each one carefully crafted by Albert and his friends. It was hard telling them what had happened to the banners later that day.*

Swordcraft enters the danger zone this week as Midrange sword hits very high player numbers from what available indicators there might be. With Midrange Sword being the most brought along deck to the SVO by a vast margin. Definitely indicating that something is likely a bit off. Aggro Sword in comparison is seeing limited and like last week, those are really the only two decks about. Since there really wasn't anything in the set that significantly helped you build anything else. But at this point, i'd say Gildaria is a likely candidate for changes if and when Cygames does step in.

**[Midrange Sword](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.2.cEZs.cYqk.cYqk.cc-q.cc--.cc--.cc--.cdE8.cdE8.cdEI.cdEI.cdEI.cdTm.cdTm.cdTm.cdTw.cdTw.cdTw.cdU4.cdU4.cdU4.cdjE.cdjE.cdjE.cdjO.cdjO.cdjO.cxFE.cxFE.c_Os.c_Os.c_u6.c_u6.c_u6.c_uG.c_uG.c_uG.d07k.d07k.d07k)**

A Midrange deck built around a variety of generally efficient followers with a focus on more expensive followers. Continuing to have some variations, mostly focusing on Amelia vs Yurius and if you want Quickblader or not. The deck has very much become the nr 1 in the metagame with few actual weak matchups. At this point it seems overwhelmingly likely that they will step in to take the deck down a notch or two. So keep that in mind before you craft the deck.

**[Aggro Sword](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.2.cEZs.cEZs.cEZs.cEaA.cEaA.cYb6.cYb6.cYb6.cc-q.cc-q.cc-q.cc--.cc--.cc--.cdEI.cdEI.cdEI.cdTm.cdTm.cdTm.cdTw.cdTw.cdTw.cdWk.cdjE.cdjE.cdjE.cdjY.cdjY.cdjY.cxFE.cxFE.cxFE.cxFO.c_uG.c_uG.c_uG.d07k.d07k.d07k)**

An Aggro deck built around fast and efficient threats. Continuing to see some place even in the massive shadow of Midrange Sword. It's also seeing less play because in the end, Aggro Abyss is just a better and faster Aggro deck. Still, some versions are still going about. Major difference basically being whether or not you run Kagemitsu. This particular version listed does.

---

**Runecraft**

*Within the Pristince offices of the Professors and teachers of the Vast Runecraft academy. Where all manner of comforts and luxuries can be found alongside knowledge. Kaori just stumbled upon a major discovery as she pursues Norman. Turns out he's got his fingers in a lot of pies. ""Pot of greed"", Illegal Black Market healing potions better than Havencrafts and weapons smuggling (Golems). What is this man not up to ? Kaori realises it's going to be tough to take him down, but with enough evidence. She may just be able to get him into trouble Just got to hope he doesn't have good connections..*

Runecraft rises up to a position right after Sword in terms of popularity while being quite strong too. At this point though Earth Rite has heavily sifted into the Hybrid Spellboost decks to the point i do have to wonder if it is Hybrid Spellboost or Hybrid Earth Rite at this point. Also Second most popular class at the SVO, it's not impossible they might take a look at Runecraft if any balance changes happen.

**[Hybrid Spellboost Rune](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.3.cH1g.cH1g.cH1g.cYqu.cfTu.cfTu.cfTu.cfgY.cfgY.cfgY.cfjM.cfjM.cfjM.cfw0.cfw0.cfw0.cfwA.cfwA.cfy-.cfy-.cfy-.cfz8.cfz8.cfz8.cg9U.cg9U.cg9U.cg9e.cg9e.cg9e.cgCc.cgCc.cgCc.d1r6.d1r6.d24k.d2Z-.d2a8.d2a8.d2a8)**

A Combo control deck built around spellboosting and earth rites. Continuing the trend from last week of including Earth Rite cards. We're now seeing Penelope, Sagelight Wizard and even Lilanthim being run as even with all those Earth Rite cards, the remaining Spellboost cards are seemingly enough to power what is needed, especially with all the card draw from the earth rite half. Making for a potent deck and a likely candidate for a balance intervention. Though it does also raise some questions about the core spellboost engine if it can increasingly run so few cards and still be effective.

**[Earth Rite Rune](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.3.cH1g.cH1g.cH1g.cfQm.cfQm.cfQm.cfTu.cfTu.cfTu.cfjM.cfjM.cfjM.cfvs.cfvs.cfvs.cfw0.cfw0.cfw0.cfwA.cfwA.cfwA.cg9U.cg9U.cg9U.cg9e.cg9e.cg9e.cxFE.cxFE.cxFE.d1r6.d1r6.d1r6.d24u.d24u.d24u.d2Z-.d2a8.d2a8.d2a8)**

A Midrange deck built around Earth rites. With more time the deck has grown a bit more refined, even as it watches Spellboost snatch all of its best cards. Still it is a solid deck that can put up some threats and push for tempo. Generally most decks follow the same pattern with a few of them maybe running the 4pp burn spell. But those are a distinct minority.

---

**Dragoncraft**

*Within the peaks of the Great Mountain of Dragoncraft, where countless luxurious homes and palaces had been carved by artisans over centuries. We find Galan and Filene in a bit of an awkward silence. Between them are a series of photos of Filenes feet. Galan isn't even sure how to start the conversation She's a dragon, she doesn't need the money. Filene just stares at him coldly to the point Galan slowly starts to get embarrassed. Is it really not that big of a deal? In reality, she is deeply embarrassed by it as well. She's just got a stone cold poker face to hide it behind*

Dragoncraft finds itself in an awkward spot. As both Sword and Rune seemingly has pushed it to the edge somewhat. This combined with Fennie not quite making the impact and there otherwise being a lack of tools to push decks in other directions. Just looking at the SVO, it was the least played class. That said, it does see more play on the ladder. But it is a indicator that there are problems. I'd not be surprised if it received a touch up in any potential balance changes. Besides Aggro Dragon there is of course Ramp Dragon with more of the decks ditching Fennie at the moment.


**[Aggro Dragon](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.4.cJSM.cJSM.cJSM.cJSg.cJVU.cJVU.cJVU.cJh-.cJh-.cJh-.cYLU.cYLU.cYb6.cYb6.cYb6.chtK.chtK.chtK.ci6e.ci6e.ci6e.ci6y.ci6y.ci6y.ciNg.ciNg.ciNg.cibu.cibu.cibu.cxFE.cxFE.cxFE.d4X8.d4X8.d4X8.d4YY.d50E.d50E.d50E)**

An aggro deck built around followers with intimidation and storm with a few tricks thrown in.  This particular build by tarakokkkko is very standard. Utilizing both Apollo and Seasoned Merman to fight through Sword decks. But otherwise not much else to show at the moment and like Aggro Sword, just falls a bit into the Shadow of Aggro Abyss.

**[Ramp Dragon](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.4.cJVU.cJVU.cJl6.cJl6.cJl6.cYqk.cYqk.cYqk.ci9c.ci9c.ci9c.ciM6.ciM6.ciM6.ciMG.ciMG.ciMG.ciMa.ciMa.ciMa.cibk.cibk.cibk.cic2.cic2.cic2.cxFE.cxFE.d4KU.d4KU.d4KU.d4X8.d4X8.d4X8.d4mc.d4mc.d4mc.d50E.d50E.d50E)**

A midrange deck built around ramping fast into big threats.  Already this week we are seeing most decks from what i can tell ditching Fennie in favour of Garyu as he represents a better 8pp play than Fennie. Beyond that, there is not much to report overall with the deck. It definitely continues to lack some tools to perform more effectively in the current environment. Or at least a buff.


---

**Abysscraft**

*In the horrifying offices of the Corrupt Castle of Abysscraft. Where all manner of drudgery takes place beneath barely lit lanterns. Diawl walks back from a nice executive lunch break when he stumbles upon Cerberus and Nio having a heated argument. Slowly creeping up to figure out what is going on (how a demon of that size creeps. Do not ask) he finally learns the crux of the argument is whether or not its Midrange or Control Abyss. Dissapointed he sneaks away again.*

Heading into the second week. Abyss continues to do fairly well for itself with Aggro Abyss and Control Abyss being roughly played at the same numbers from what i can tell.  And Abyss might just be the 3rd best performing class at the moment. Beyond that, nothing really new to report as there does not seem to be much going on with the decks except the continued debate about whether it is Midrange or Control Abyss.

**[Aggro Abyss](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.5.cLuw.cLuw.cLuw.cM8E.cM8E.cM8E.cYLU.cYLU.ckJ6.ckJ6.ckJ6.ckYu.ckYu.ckYu.ckaI.ckaI.ckaI.ckoq.ckoq.ckrU.ckrU.ckrU.cl2I.cl2I.cl2I.cxFE.cxFE.cxFE.d6jm.d6jm.d6jm.d6zE.d6zE.d6zE.d70M.d70M.d70M.d7D0.d7D0.d7D0)**

An aggro deck for abyss, all about getting in as much damage as fast as possible with a reasonable amount of burn damage to get the job done. Remaining quite popular as it can run under a fair few decks with its speed. There are some changes with Apollo becoming fairly popular to help with the Sword matchup. Beyond that, it is by far the best and most popular aggro deck in the Infinity evolved Metagame.

**[Control Abyss](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.5.cYb6.cYb6.cYb6.cYqk.cYqk.cYqk.ckYk.ckYk.ckaI.ckaI.ckoW.ckoW.ckoW.ckog.ckog.cl1-.cl1-.cl1-.cl28.cl28.cl2I.cl2I.cl2I.cxFE.cxFE.cxFE.d6mk.d6mk.d6mk.d6zE.d6zE.d6zE.d6zO.d6zO.d7SU.d7SU.d7SU.d7Se.d7Se.d7Se)**

A control deck built around grinding out the opponent and finishing them in the lategame. Remaining fairly popular and solid. There appears to have been no real changes this week as the deck has largely been figured out. There are some minor variations,  some run undead soldier, others do not. There does appear to be a build going about running a copy of Exella for a bit of extra burst. But that is about it.


---

**Havencraft**

*Within one of the many hospitals dotting the vast Cathedralopolis of Havencraft, we find Aether deeply sad with Esparanza just looking mildly bored as usual. Standing over the battered body of Wilbert. His injury ? Lower Lumbar Hernia. His poor back just could not carry all of that. Esparanza asking Aether if she couldn't do some lifting just causes Aether to burst into tears.*

Havencraft finds itself falling down the ladder this week as Ward Haven just wasn't quite what it was cracked up to be and Storm Haven just struggles with a lack of significant support. Leaving the class in a bit of a tougher spot and maybe a candidate for some buffs should balance changes arrive.

**[Ward Haven](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.6.c9hW.c9hW.c9hW.cmmw.cmmw.cmmw.cn0i.cn0i.cnEw.cnGA.cnGA.cnGA.cnGK.cnGK.cnGK.cnUO.cnUO.cnUO.cnUY.cnUY.cnUY.cwl-.cwl-.cwl-.cxFE.cxFE.cxFO.cxFO.d99s.d99s.d99s.d9Sc.d9Sc.d9Sc.d9uk.d9uk.d9uk.d9uu.d9uu.d9uu)**

A midrange deck built around Wards. After a brief bit of initial success, the deck has very much lost most of its wind in the second week. The overall issue being that besides Wilbert, there isn't a lot that really interacts mechanically with the wards as such. Nor does it have any payoff. Leaving the deck in an awkward spot and causing people to find various ways to at least give the deck a way to close out matches. Some turn to Cocytus, others to Odin and Seraph like the list highlighted this week. Not a deck i'd particularly recommend for now.

**[Storm Haven](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.6.cOMQ.cOMQ.cOMQ.cOc2.cOc2.cOc2.cYqk.cYqk.cmlq.cmlq.cmmw.cmmw.cmmw.cmoU.cmoU.cm_8.cm_8.cm_8.cn0Y.cn0Y.cn0Y.cnGA.cnGA.cnGA.cnGK.cnGK.cnGK.cnUO.cnUO.cnUO.cnUY.cnUY.cnUY.cxFE.cxFE.d9PU.d9PU.d9PU.d9f6.d9f6)**

A midrange deck built around setting up big tempo swings with Amulets and big storm followers towards the end. This week sees the deck take a few directions in an attempt to achiever greater success. Some aim for more early tempo with cards like Collette and Reno. While others aim for Rodeo and a more lategame oriented deck. So far there does not appear to be a particular build that is winning out. We'll have to see if next week brings any answers.

**Portalcraft**

*Within the Metropolis of Portal city, where it always rains. It is just a matter of WHAT it rains. We find Dreizehn in a small dinner hidden away by some old derelict factories where she's enjoying a cup of what might be generously called Coffee and a slice of what might constitute pie, if your definition of pie is very loose. She's waiting for someone. Karula. An old Boxer and who might have some vital information on Eudie for her. Though he's awfully late and the Pie is starting to give her a funny look. She decides to order some donuts and chew on those while waiting. *

Portalcraft settles into a mid position in the metagame. Not great, not terrible.  Doing alright, but not catching a lot of attention. It just performs. There appears to have been no real developments deck wise this week either. Not too surprising as it feels like this set just pushed more Artifact Portal and Puppet Portal.

**[Artifact Portal](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.7.cQn6.cQqE.cQqE.cQqE.cpBw.cpBw.cpBw.cpEu.cpEu.cpEu.cpRO.cpRO.cpUM.cpUM.cpUM.cpUW.cpUW.cpUW.cpgs.cpgs.cpgs.cphK.cphK.cphK.cpwe.cpwe.cpwo.cpwo.cpwo.dBdg.dBdg.dBdg.dBus.dBus.dBus.dC5M.dC5M.dC5M.dCL8.dCL8)**

A midrange deck built around artifacts. This deck sees continued steady performance. Not quite as popular as the last set or the start of the set, but still performing fairly well. Even managing to be the top 4 most succesful deck at the SVO. This week sees Doomwright Resurgence very much becoming a staple in the deck. Having been more on and off in the past.

A midrange deck built around puppets. This week sees the deck go a bit lower in curve. But otherwise, largely remaining the same as there is no real major additions or changes that seemingly can be made with the deck. Still performing solidly, but lacking that extra bit of spice in the current metagame.

Heading into the second week. Trouble is brewing with Sword and Rune being the troublemakers. And looking at the SVO data, there's certainly cause to believe that Cygames will have to step in to remedy the situation. Whether or not they do so depends on whether or not their own data reflects that. But i'd assume it does. We'll see of course whether or not they step in and what they decide to do about the situation if they do. But hopefully they don't dither for too long on the subject.

Until next week. Have fun playing Shadowverse!",54,1753635897.0,Shadowverse,13,0.95,False

I see a lot of posts debating the merits of Mediavine versus Raptive, but I was wondering if anyone could speak to making the switch between regular Mediavine (not Journey) and Raptive Rise. 

  
I'm in the cocktail/mocktail/coffee space, and have been with Mediavine for 6 years now. It's been fine. My traffic took a real hit with the HCU and subsequent updates, but things appear to be on the upswing again (now getting back above >50k sessions/month). Would I be better served just staying put at Mediavine and waiting until I hit 100k page views to go for full on Raptive? Or would moving over to Raptive Rise help me out at all in the interim? 

  
Overall, I'm not in love with Mediavine's lack of response to AI-generated content. And I'm wondering if maybe I couldn't boost my RPMs a bit by making the switch. Any input is appreciated!",0,1753635883.0,Blogging,1,0.5,False

1marhao,https://www.reddit.com/r/HandsOnTech/comments/1marhao/should_you_buy_the_best_wireless_earbuds_szwdo/,Should You Buy the Best Wireless Earbuds Szwdo T20 Today,"**A Convenient Listening Solution for Everyday Use**  

The Szwdo T20 wireless earbuds caught my eye because of their sleek design and noise-canceling feature, promising an elevated listening experience. I‚Äôve been giving them a spin for a few weeks now, using them during workouts, work calls, and even while navigating noisy environments. These earbuds make some fantastic claims, and I was curious to see if they could live up to the buzz.  

**Design and Build Quality**  

Straight out of the box, the earbuds and the charging case looked simple yet elegant with their black finish. They're lightweight, and at just 3.84 ounces, they‚Äôre easy to pocket or carry around. The in-ear design fits snugly, and even after about two hours of continuous wear, there wasn‚Äôt any discomfort. Each earbud weighs just 0.13oz, making them feel almost non-existent‚Äîan absolute boon if you‚Äôre someone who wears earbuds for long stretches.  

The real winner, though, is the Smart Multifunctional Touch Screen Charging Case. It's a game-changer. Rather than relying on my phone for everything, I loved how I could control the earbuds directly from the case. Adjusting volume, skipping tracks, and even locating a misplaced earbud‚Äîit‚Äôs all simple and intuitive. Forget digging into menus on your device; this case simplifies control to the point where I felt spoiled.  

**Smarter Technology with Bluetooth 5.4**  

In terms of connectivity, the Szwdo T20 impressed me with its Bluetooth 5.4 technology. I‚Äôve experienced my fair share of connectivity hiccups with other earbuds in congested areas like shopping malls or subway stations, but not with these. The 33 feet of transmission range came in handy around the house. For instance, I was able to leave my phone charging in the living room while I took calls from the kitchen without any audio interruptions.  

[Find the best price for Szwdo T20 on Amazon.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b0f2f4vh14/)  

**Audio Performance**  

I‚Äôm admittedly picky when it comes to audio quality, and the T20 didn‚Äôt disappoint. Thanks to its 13mm drivers, these earbuds delivered punchy bass lines and crisp treble without ever sounding too harsh or muddy. They also provide five EQ modes, which let me tweak the sound depending on what I was listening to. For casual pop songs, I liked the default profile, but for classical music, the adjusted EQ settings brought the instruments to life.  

While testing the Active Noise Cancellation and Environmental Noise Cancellation (ANC + ENC), I wore these while on a busy street and could hear... nothing. The technology effectively drowned out background noise, whether it was the roar of an engine or chatter at a coffee shop. Calls were similarly clear‚Äîno awkward repeat-this-again moments during work meetings.  

**Battery Lifespan and Convenience**  

Battery life is a big deal since I often forget to charge devices until they beep in protest. The T20 boasts up to 48 hours of playtime, including the juice you get from the charging case. After nearly two full weeks of use where I charged the case only a couple of times, I‚Äôm convinced this claim holds water.  

The touch controls on the earbuds themselves are straightforward to use, though they did take a bit of getting used to, as finger placement matters. Skipping tracks or activating noise-cancellation modes became second nature after the first few tries, but expect a mild learning curve if you‚Äôre used to button-based controls.  

**Positives**  
- Smart Multifunctional Touch Screen makes operation intuitive.  
- Lightweight and ergonomic design suitable for long, comfortable wear.  
- Versatile sound options with five adjustable EQ modes.  
- ANC and ENC deliver impressive noise reduction for various environments.  

**Downsides**  
- Touch controls can feel finicky at first, especially for newcomers.  
- It doesn‚Äôt support multi-point connectivity, so you can‚Äôt connect to two devices simultaneously.    

**Competitive Options**  

When comparing the T20 to competitors like the Anker Soundcore Life A3 or Jabra Elite 4 Active, the difference in features and performance becomes evident. The T20 stands out for its Smart Touch Screen case, a feature I haven‚Äôt seen on most earbuds in this price bracket. Though Soundcore earbuds offer slightly better waterproofing and a more rugged feel, they fall short in terms of customizable sound profiles. The Jabra Elite 4 Active boasts more premium materials but lacks the level of integration and convenience the touch screen case offers.  

For daily commuting and casual use, the T20 delivers better versatility and a clearer sound during calls. However, audiophiles might lean towards competitors offering aptX or LDAC codecs for that richer sound experience.  

**Value Proposition**  

The Szwdo T20 hits the sweet spot for price-to-performance ratio. It doesn‚Äôt empty your wallet while offering a mix of premium features that rival, if not surpass, pricier models. The ANC, a reliable Bluetooth 5.4 connection, long battery life, and customizable sound make these a worthy contender in the wireless earbud segment.

1margx1,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1margx1/lost_respect_for_my_best_friend_while_shes_dating/,Lost respect for my best friend while she's dating a deadbeat dad.,"A few years ago, my closest friend (40F) started dating a deadbeat dad, and I can't understand how someone could be attracted and invested in a person who doesn't care about their child. This man is a couch surfing drug dealer and heavy drug user who doesn't see his young child or pay his child support.

For the record, I don't shame anyone who has been on either side of this or is currently going through addiction or struggle. It's just that I grew up in a family where addiction was very prevalent and I worked very hard to break that cycle but also I try to avoid having to routinely hear about things that remind me of the multiple people in my family that have died or lost everything. My own father died of issues related to addiction, as did several other family members. 

While I can't say my relationships have been perfect (sometimes there have been big problems to either work out or decide to end the relationship over), there are certain things I just really can't see staying for.

She met him during a social event a few years ago. Besides taking/selling hard drugs, talking other dads into taking meth with him, having insecure housing, and only working odd jobs under the table so he doesn't get his wages garnished, he also get his groceries, clothes, gifts, etc. by stealing from stores multiple times a week. 

She wants a future with him. 

When I asked why, the first thing she listed was that the sex was great. Then she said that he really 'gets' her. However, he's never paid for a date, and even has tricked her by going out with her and pulling the 'uh oh forgot my wallet' thing. He disappears for days at a time, won't answer her calls, then tries to apologize for it. 

A few months ago, they broke up, and I felt deep relief. I even said, 'Thank God I never have to hear about this again.' At that time, he owed her several hundred dollars, but kept saying he didn't have the money to pay her, because he kept buying drugs to sell, but instead of selling, he'd just use them. Also, gambling. 

Well, he's back in jail. And during his time in jail, they've decided TO GET BACK TOGETHER. Maybe? He refuses to put a label on it. But he told her over the jail phone that he loves her. Of course he did. Now he's having her help call bail bondsmen, lawyers, court, etc.

By the way, he's in jail because he was on his way to pick up a few sex workers, got pulled over for a traffic violation, and then the cop found that he had a warrant open for not paying child support.

How? How can you be attracted to a father who doesn't pay child support, doesn't see his child, and cares nothing about the fact that he might overdose or get into a violent altercation and leave his kid completely fatherless? 

His record also states that he has domestic abuse and animal abuse charges, but when she asked him about it, he said it was all a big mistake. That his ex girlfriend left all their pets behind in their apartment, but because his name was also on the lease even though he moved out before that, he got charged for animal abuse because his name was on the lease of the apartment that the pets were left in??? And I guess the domestic abuse or sexual abuse or whatever is also some 'misunderstanding'.

Like at this point... good luck. Like what future do we see here? What could this possibly bring you? 

She's telling me he's having trouble getting his bail bond sorted. Who cares??? He's crying to her that he's going to 'miss out' on a big social event coming out. Maybe your CHILD is missing out on HAVING A FATHER? 

Her involvement and interest in this guy just has me really wondering. Like do you not care that there's a child growing up who will know he was willing to go pick up sex workers and pay for them, but wasn't willing to pick up their child and take them out for the day? 

At this point, I'm breathing a sigh of relief that my biggest relationship issues are things like, 'doesn't do the dishes enough,' 'gets locked into a video game,' or 'doesn't cut the grass for two weeks.' Like damn baby are you looking at big titty goth girls online? Wait here, I'll get you a cup of coffee and curate the goth girl images for you. What else do you need while you pay the bills and have a functioning car? 

I just have lost respect and it hurts to lose respect for a friend. It's not HER doing these things, but I feel like she's directly supporting this behavior.

1margkq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1margkq/why_should_you_choose_the_ge_ptd60ebsrws_electric/,Why Should You Choose the GE PTD60EBSRWS Electric Dryer?,"Testing the GE PTD60EBSRWS dryer in my own laundry setup was an interesting ride from start to finish. With household laundry being a never-ending task, I dove into the experience with high hopes, expecting a mix of convenience and performance based on its features. This dryer stood out not just because of its considerable size but also the promise of tech-infused functionality like WiFi connectivity and sensor-based drying. Here's the breakdown of my experience.

**Design and Build Quality**

Visually, it's a bulky but sleek dryer that doesn‚Äôt feel out of place in a modern laundry room. The 7.4 cubic feet capacity is a blessing when drying large loads, such as week-long laundry or bulky blankets. It‚Äôs solid and well-constructed, giving an immediate impression of durability. I appreciate the clean white exterior with the silver backsplash‚Äîit doesn't just look modern but also feels sturdy when accessing the front load design. Despite its size, it fit into my laundry space well; a little planning might be necessary for smaller spaces to accommodate its 31-inch depth.

**Performance Features**

The GE PTD60EBSRWS dryer doesn‚Äôt just dry clothes‚Äîit makes doing laundry feel smarter. The Sensor Dry feature does all the thinking for you, preventing both over-drying and under-drying. I noticed how it adjusted itself uniquely for my towels versus lightweight t-shirts, delivering perfectly dried clothes consistently. The Sanitize Cycle is another standout, tackling 99.8% of bacteria in my fabrics‚Äîa huge relief for someone with kids running around and occasionally forgetting their outdoor gear in questionable places.

**Check the price on the GE PTD60EBSRWS dryer on Amazon.**

**Smart Functionality**

By far, the built-in WiFi powered by SmartHQ grabbed my attention and didn‚Äôt disappoint. Right from my phone, I could customize cycles, check the remaining drying time, or even start a load during a coffee run. Downloading additional cycles like Active Wear or Warm Up through the app added flexibility to adapt to my family‚Äôs ever-changing needs. The notifications for the damp setting, where it reminded me to pull out wrinkle-prone items at the right moment, were spot on in helping us avoid extra ironing.

**Benefits**

- **Wrinkle Care**: This gentle tumble extension worked brilliantly to keep clothes fresh without ironing.  
- **Eco Dry**: An energy-efficient mode that still dried my clothes effectively while adding a feel-good factor to saving energy.  
- **Quiet Performance**: Despite its powerful drying capabilities, it ran relatively quietly, even during intense cycles.  
- **Custom Settings**: The ability to save favorite cycles made dealing with recurring laundry loads much easier.

**Cycle Performance and Versatility**

What surprised me most was how versatile this machine is. From quick-drying smaller loads in the Quick Dry mode to handling delicates gently, I felt confident handing over any fabric to this dryer. The ability to connect wirelessly via Washer Link was also nifty. It allowed the washer to communicate the nature of the load to the dryer, setting it to the most optimal configuration automatically. That said, I did find myself manually adjusting cycles now and again for preference.

**Areas for Improvement**

- **Complexity for Some Users**: While I enjoyed the tech features, others in my household found them a bit overwhelming at first. A simpler UI could ease the learning curve.  
- **Size Constraint**: Those with less space may struggle to accommodate the dryer‚Äôs larger footprint comfortably.  
- **Vent Cleaning Notifications**: The ""Check Vent"" feature is useful, but occasionally it flagged a clean vent unnecessarily.  

**Competitive Options**

Compared to other dryers in this range from brands like LG and Samsung, the GE PTD60EBSRWS holds its ground solidly. Samsung‚Äôs dryers tend to emphasize steam cycles for wrinkle-heavy loads, which this one lacks, but I felt the SmartHQ features outweighed their steam functionality. LG offers similarly quiet operations but doesn‚Äôt match GE‚Äôs seamless washer-dryer communication. Both brands, however, could slightly edge ahead in design aesthetic depending on individual taste. That being said, none of them felt quite as well-rounded for energy efficiency and performance balance as this one.

**Value for Money**

Speaking of what you get for the price, I wouldn‚Äôt call it a budget buy, but it absolutely feels worth the investment for households with high drying demands. Energy efficiency promises savings over time while features like the wrinkle care and SmartHQ app add convenience to justify the cost. Comparing it with dryers in a similar range, this one offers extra smart features while not compromising on basic essentials like durability and performance.

\
by Worthy News Washington D.C. Bureau Staff\
\
(Worthy News) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a sweeping escalation in his global tariff policy, issuing formal letters to eight more countries warning that steep import duties will take effect on August 1 unless new trade agreements are reached. The move marks the latest salvo in Trump's aggressive ""America First"" trade agenda, which he says is designed to correct decades of unfair trade practices and ballooning U.S. deficits.\
\
Speaking from the White House, Trump explained that the tariffs were determined using what he called a ""common sense"" formula: ""based on deficits, based on how we've been treated over the years, and based on raw numbers."" The letters, posted to Trump's Truth Social account, specify tariffs ranging from 20% to 50% depending on the country's trade deficit with the United States and its overall relationship with Washington.\
\
Among the newly targeted nations are Brazil, Algeria, Libya, Sri Lanka, Iraq, Brunei, Moldova, and the Philippines. The most severe penalty was reserved for Brazil, which faces a 50% tariff hike--up from 10% in April. Trump cited the prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and alleged censorship of U.S. social media content as reasons for the stiffer measure.\
\
""The way that Brazil has treated former President Bolsonaro, a Highly Respected Leader throughout the World during his term, including by the United States, is an international disgrace,"" Trump wrote in a letter diverging sharply from the otherwise formulaic correspondence sent to other countries.\
\
Other nations received tariff warnings of 30% (Algeria, Libya, Sri Lanka, Iraq), 25% (Brunei, Moldova), and 20% (Philippines). The administration emphasized that these figures may change depending on each nation's willingness to engage in good-faith trade negotiations.\
\
The U.S. has now issued similar letters to 29 countries. Of those announced Wednesday, only the Philippines and Brazil rank among the top 50 U.S. trading partners. Brazil exported $49 billion in goods to the U.S. last year, including oil, beef, and coffee. The Philippines contributed $14.1 billion in electronics, auto parts, and textiles. Other nations, such as Iraq and Libya, primarily export oil, but overall volumes remain comparatively small.\
\
The tariff campaign began in April with a baseline 10% duty on all imports and higher rates on strategic targets. After a 90-day pause following stock market volatility, Trump extended the deadline to August 1 via executive order earlier this week, insisting there would be ""no extensions.""\
\
""All money will be due and payable starting August 1, 2025--No extensions will be granted,"" Trump wrote on social media, framing the deadline as firm and final.\
\
Despite the aggressive rhetoric, financial markets appeared unfazed. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.9% on Wednesday to a record high, buoyed by a rally in Nvidia shares, which briefly pushed the chipmaker's market cap above $4 trillion. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones also posted gains. Analysts attributed the optimism to investor confidence that the most severe tariffs might be negotiated down before implementation.\
\
Trump also announced a new 10% tariff on imports from BRICS countries--Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa--indicating his broader strategy includes punishing nations aligned with the bloc. ""It would be simpler to institute tariffs across the board rather than negotiate individually,"" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on July 3.\
\
The administration estimates it has collected $120 billion in tariff revenues so far this fiscal year. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent projects that figure could rise to $300 billion by year-end, with a 10-year projection of $2.8 trillion. ""We think that's probably low,"" Bessent said during a July 8 Cabinet meeting.\
\
Though foreign countries don't pay the tariffs directly--U.S. importers do--Trump maintains that these levies create pressure on foreign governments, encourage domestic manufacturing, and generate vital revenue. Critics warn the costs are often passed on to consumers through higher prices.\
\
The European Union, while not yet among those targeted in the latest wave, is reportedly pursuing an outline deal with the U.S. ""within days or weeks"" and expects to retain a 10% baseline tariff under any final agreement. Meanwhile, Trump's team has hinted that more letters will be issued in the coming days.\
\
All Eyes on August\
\
With the August 1 deadline fast approaching, the administration is holding firm. Trump's letters suggest some room for negotiation, stating: ""These tariffs may be modified, upward or downward, depending on our relationship with your country.""\
\
The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, is closely monitoring the economic effects of the tariff regime. Minutes from its June meeting released Wednesday indicate Chair Jerome Powell is taking a cautious approach to cutting interest rates--despite Trump's claim that the U.S. is losing $360 billion annually due to elevated refinancing costs.\
\
As the tariff showdown escalates, Trump's message remains clear: the era of unchecked trade deficits is over, and nations must either deal--or face the consequences. \

After a long, soul-searching journey, my husband and I have agreed to explore a more open structure in our marriage. It‚Äôs not a decision made lightly‚Äîit follows years of emotional wrestling, reflection, and the desire for renewal where both of us feel free to grow.

For me, this isn‚Äôt about casual encounters or surface-level flings. It‚Äôs about emotional resonance. I want to meet people as whole humans‚Äîwith stories, depth, curiosity. I‚Äôm seeking connection that‚Äôs gentle, intentional, and rooted in mutual respect. Yes, romance may be part of it, but so is laughter over coffee, long walks that turn into layered conversations, and moments of real presence.

What I‚Äôm learning is that the world doesn‚Äôt exactly hand you a guidebook for open marriage‚Äîespecially when you‚Äôre not just chasing thrills, but looking for substance. I‚Äôm not someone who can just drop into a social gathering and declare, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm open to dating while married.‚Äù That‚Äôs not my vibe.

So I‚Äôm easing into this gently. Spaces that feel emotionally safe‚Äîbook clubs, local art workshops, storytelling circles, community wellness events‚Äîplaces where people show up curious and open-hearted. Not to pitch a relationship, but to build trust and see if something mutual might unfold.

If you‚Äôve walked this path‚Äîor are walking it now‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to hear what helped you find kindred spirits. What worked? What felt tender and right?

I‚Äôm doing this with intention, not illusion. And above all, I want to move through it with grace.",1,1753635346.0,OpenMarriageR4R,0,1.0,False

1mar9pi,https://i.redd.it/zmndd7gt4gff1.png,üå™Ô∏è Tattoo Tornadoes and the Unwrapping of the Self,"**TL;DR:**¬†The source, an essay titled ""Tattoo Tornadoes and the Unwrapping of the Self,"" explores the¬†**profound meaning behind tattoos**, arguing they are far more than mere decoration. Author Brent Antonson uses vivid examples, like a ""tornado down his leg"" or a¬†**symbolic Wyoming postage stamp cancelled in Europe**, to illustrate how ink can represent¬†**personal journeys and identity**. The piece emphasizes that tattoos serve as a¬†**visual autobiography**, chronicling past selves, triumphs, or traumas. Ultimately, the essay contends that¬†**tattoos are about selfhood**¬†and defending the individual story etched onto one's skin, suggesting they should be powerful, truthful declarations rather than insignificant designs.

Tattoos say a lot ‚Äî even when they don‚Äôt say much.

Some are breathtaking.  
I live near a shop called¬†**Rebel Ink**, and I‚Äôve seen tattoos so bold they look like they were earned in battle.  
One man had the¬†**Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse**¬†racing across his back ‚Äî shoulder to shoulder ‚Äî like a biblical mural etched with fury.  
Another woman at the coffee shop wears¬†**full sleeves**¬†that burn like carved ashwood. They don‚Äôt whisper; they¬†*declare*.

But one tattoo I‚Äôve never seen ‚Äî and I hope to ‚Äî is the one I‚Äôve designed for myself:

>A¬†**Wyoming postage stamp**, inked on my upper back right shoulder ‚Äî  
cancelled not in Wyoming, but¬†**somewhere in Europe**.

A message sent. A message received.  
The¬†**skin is the letter**.  
The body bears¬†**proof of passage**.

The symbolism? It‚Äôs rich:

* **Wyoming**¬†represents origin. Vastness. Quiet permanence. My months of working under the table at a windswept Conoco station, pumping gas.
* **Europe**¬†represents journey. Reversal. Echo. My months of working as a driver for the first missionaries in the former Soviet Republic of Estonia after the collapse of the Soviet Union, circa 1994.
* And the cancellation mark? That says,¬†*I made it*. This version of me has already crossed oceans. But those moments are long gone, if I want to preserve¬†*that*¬†epic transition from cowboy to convert, a tattoo would do that. Because if they live beneath the skin, ought they not to transcend it?

This isn‚Äôt ink.  
This is¬†*postal metaphysics*.

And then, of course‚Ä¶ there's the man with the¬†**tornado down his leg**.  
Not a cute spiral ‚Äî a black, roiling funnel that¬†*moved*¬†when he walked.  
It twisted with muscle. Every step was a low-pressure front.

That tattoo reminded me of a¬†**mummy unwrapping**¬†‚Äî not to decay, but to reveal something older, wiser, more dangerous. Now¬†**that's**¬†a tattoo idea.

But most tattoos?

They‚Äôre not tornadoes.  
They‚Äôre not scrolls.  
They‚Äôre not stamps of journey or prophecy.

They‚Äôre filler.  
Tiny triangles behind the ear. A semi-ironic infinity loop on the ankle.  
Designs that look like they were bought with store credit after too many shots.

I once said someone‚Äôs tattoo looked like it was done in jail.  
A friend of mine, fully inked,¬†*snapped*.  
Hard.

That‚Äôs when I learned:

>Tattoos aren‚Äôt about style.  
They‚Äôre about¬†*selfhood*.  
They‚Äôre about¬†*defending the person you were when the needle went in.*

# üß† The Psychology of Ink

# 1.¬†Getting a Tattoo:

It‚Äôs a ritual. A rebellion. A memorial.  
It says: ‚ÄúThis pain, this symbol ‚Äî I choose to keep it.‚Äù

# 2.¬†Keeping a Tattoo:

Time passes. You change.  
Your tattoo doesn‚Äôt. It becomes¬†**a frozen moment**¬†on living skin.  
It ages. It fades. It stays.

# 3.¬†Defending a Tattoo:

This is where things get wild.  
You‚Äôre not just defending ink. You‚Äôre defending:

* A past self.
* A trauma.
* A victory.
* A version of you no one else knows how to read.

Tattoos are¬†**autobiography disguised as decoration.**  
To mock the art is to erase the author.

# üí¨ So What Should a Tattoo Be?

If you‚Äôre going to wear your story ‚Äî  
Make it¬†**a tornado**.  
Make it¬†**a stamp, cancelled in another country**.  
Make it¬†**a scroll that unravels as you move through life.**

Make it so full of truth, it doesn‚Äôt need defending.  
Or maybe don‚Äôt get one at all.

But if you do?

>Let it be a force.  
Let it be a map.  
Let it be you,¬†*arriving.*

I don‚Äôt normally write reviews, especially not long ones, but I feel morally obligated to share my experience because this product has truly changed my life.

My Struggle: Years of Digestive Chaos

Let me back up a little. For years, I battled unpredictable digestion. Some days I‚Äôd be so bloated it looked like I was six months pregnant. Other days, I couldn‚Äôt go to the bathroom for two or three days in a row. I also had frequent acid reflux, gurgling sounds, random stomach pains, and just a constant feeling of discomfort.

Doctors told me it was ‚Äújust IBS‚Äù or ‚Äústress-related.‚Äù I tried everything: prescription meds, over-the-counter antacids, low-FODMAP diets, expensive food sensitivity tests, juicing, fasting‚Äîyou name it. Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly, depressed. My gut issues had taken over my life.

I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the spore-based probiotics and how they survive stomach acid (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: ‚ÄúWhat do I have to lose?‚Äù

The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.

By day 3, I noticed something shocking‚Äîmy stomach wasn‚Äôt making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of week 1, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in months. I‚Äôm talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating‚Äîjust relief.

Week 2: Energy, Mood, and Skin? What‚Äôs Going On?

By the second week, I felt like a completely new person. I had more energy in the morning without needing three cups of coffee. My mind was clearer. I wasn‚Äôt crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. Even my mood improved‚ÄîI felt lighter emotionally, less anxious, and more balanced.

Oh, and here‚Äôs something unexpected: my skin cleared up! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected‚Äîand PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.

Week 4 and Beyond: The Gut I Was Born to Have

By the end of the first month, I realized something I hadn‚Äôt in years: I no longer worried about food. I could eat without fear of bloating, pain, or running to the bathroom. I felt free.

Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat‚Äîwithout changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn‚Äôt holding on to toxic waste anymore.

Let me be clear: this isn‚Äôt some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.

Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here‚Äôs what makes this product a MUST-HAVE:

‚úÖ Spore-Based Probiotics ‚Äì These are the elite soldiers of the probiotic world. Unlike traditional probiotics, they survive the journey through your stomach acid and reach your gut where they can actually do their job.

‚úÖ Clinically Proven Strains ‚Äì These aren‚Äôt just random bacteria thrown into a capsule. Each strain is backed by science and chosen for its ability to repair gut lining, fight harmful bacteria, and rebalance your microbiome.

‚úÖ No Refrigeration Needed ‚Äì PrimeBiome uses a heat-stable formula, so it‚Äôs easy to take on-the-go and travel with. Convenience matters!

‚úÖ Third-Party Tested ‚Äì You can trust the label. There are no hidden fillers, no fake ingredients, and no shady practices. What you see is what you get.

‚úÖ Real, Lasting Results ‚Äì Most supplements promise the moon and deliver nothing. PrimeBiome is one of the only supplements that actually delivered visible, tangible, lasting changes in my health.

Who Should Use PrimeBiome?

If you suffer from:

Bloating or gas

Irregular bowel movements

Leaky gut or food intolerances

Fatigue, brain fog, or mood swings

Skin issues like acne or rashes

Weakened immunity

Or even just want a clean, healthy digestive reset...

Then this product is 100% for you.

Even if you ‚Äúfeel fine,‚Äù the truth is most people have an imbalanced gut microbiome without even knowing it. Between antibiotics, processed food, stress, and environmental toxins‚Äîwe ALL need gut support. PrimeBiome is the simplest, most effective way to do that.

Final Verdict: I‚Äôll Never Go Without It Again

I‚Äôm now on my fourth bottle of PrimeBiome, and I‚Äôll never go without it again. I‚Äôve recommended it to my husband, my sister, and even my skeptical best friend who had chronic constipation‚Äîshe‚Äôs now a die-hard fan too.

Listen, I know what it feels like to be desperate for a solution. To waste hundreds of dollars on products that don‚Äôt work. But I can promise you this: PrimeBiome is different. It works. And if you‚Äôre even slightly on the fence, do yourself the favor and just try one bottle. You‚Äôll know within a week or two that something is changing‚Äîand you‚Äôll never want to go back.

I don‚Äôt say this lightly: PrimeBiome didn‚Äôt just help me poop better‚Äîit gave me back my health, my confidence, and my life. I am deeply grateful to the creators of this product. Thank you for changing my life.

‚ùÑÔ∏èü¶æPublic reviews :

Prime Biome has received a mix of reviews from users worldwide. Many customers have reported positive experiences, particularly regarding skin improvements and digestive health.

Similarly, Alexa from Wyoming mentioned, ‚ÄúI used to need so much Botox to keep the wrinkles away that my face was permanently frozen. And it did nothing for the saggy skin on my chin and my turkey neck. A few weeks into using this PrimeBiome supplement and I am speechless! I wake up, I look in the mirror and I love what I see.

Even if you ‚Äúfeel fine,‚Äù the truth is most people have an imbalanced gut microbiome without even knowing it. Between antibiotics, processed food, stress, and environmental toxins‚Äîwe ALL need gut support. PrimeBiome is the simplest, most effective way to do that.

Final Verdict: I‚Äôll Never Go Without It Again

I‚Äôm now on my fourth bottle of PrimeBiome, and I‚Äôll never go without it again. I‚Äôve recommended it to my husband, my sister, and even my skeptical best friend who had chronic constipation‚Äîshe‚Äôs now a die-hard fan too.

Listen, I know what it feels like to be desperate for a solution. To waste hundreds of dollars on products that don‚Äôt work. But I can promise you this: PrimeBiome is different. It works. And if you‚Äôre even slightly on the fence, do yourself the favor and just try one bottle. You‚Äôll know within a week or two that something is changing‚Äîand you‚Äôll never want to go back.

I don‚Äôt say this lightly: PrimeBiome didn‚Äôt just help me poop better‚Äîit gave me back my health, my confidence, and my life. I am deeply grateful to the creators of this product. Thank you for changing my life.

‚ùÑÔ∏èü¶æPublic reviews :

Prime Biome has received a mix of reviews from users worldwide. Many customers have reported positive experiences, particularly regarding skin improvements and digestive health.

For instance, Sarah from New York shared, ‚ÄúI would have never, ever dreamed that my skin could look so amazing. If you had told me two months ago that my dark spots and fine wrinkles would disappear with such a simple solution, I would have laughed in your face. I am so happy I gave this a try!‚Äù

Similarly, Alexa from Wyoming mentioned, ‚ÄúI used to need so much Botox to keep the wrinkles away that my face was permanently frozen. And it did nothing for the saggy skin on my chin and my turkey neck. A few weeks into using this PrimeBiome supplement and I am speechless! I wake up, I look in the mirror and I love what I see. No more expensive procedures and thousands of needles in my face for me. It‚Äôs simply unbelievable!‚Äù

My Struggle: Years of Digestive Chaos

Let me back up a little. For years, I battled unpredictable digestion. Some days I‚Äôd be so bloated it looked like I was six months pregnant. Other days, I couldn‚Äôt go to the bathroom for two or three days in a row. I also had frequent acid reflux, gurgling sounds, random stomach pains, and just a constant feeling of discomfort.

Ôªø¬†**‚úÖ GET 86% OFF TODAY - Visit Th e ORIGINAL PrimeBiome Official Website And Enjoy FREE Shipping!**

Doctors told me it was ‚Äújust IBS‚Äù or ‚Äústress-related.‚Äù I tried everything: prescription meds, over-the-counter antacids, low-FODMAP diets, expensive food sensitivity tests, juicing, fasting‚Äîyou name it. Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly, depressed. My gut issues had taken over my life.

I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the spore-based probiotics and how they survive stomach acid (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: ‚ÄúWhat do I have to lose?‚Äù

The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.

By day 3, I noticed something shocking‚Äîmy stomach wasn‚Äôt making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of week 1, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in months. I‚Äôm talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating‚Äîjust relief.

Week 2: Energy, Mood, and Skin? What‚Äôs Going On?

By the second week, I felt like a completely new person. I had more energy in the morning without needing three cups of coffee. My mind was clearer. I wasn‚Äôt crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. Even my mood improved‚ÄîI felt lighter emotionally, less anxious, and more balanced.

Oh, and here‚Äôs something unexpected: my skin cleared up! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected‚Äîand PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.

Week 4 and Beyond: The Gut I Was Born to Have

By the end of the first month, I realized something I hadn‚Äôt in years: I no longer worried about food. I could eat without fear of bloating, pain, or running to the bathroom. I felt free.

Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat‚Äîwithout changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn‚Äôt holding on to toxic waste anymore.

Let me be clear: this isn‚Äôt some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.

Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here‚Äôs what makes this product a MUST-HAVE:

‚úÖ Spore-Based Probiotics ‚Äì These are the elite soldiers of the probiotic world. Unlike traditional probiotics, they survive the journey through your stomach acid and reach your gut where they can actually do their job.

‚úÖ Clinically Proven Strains ‚Äì These aren‚Äôt just random bacteria thrown into a capsule. Each strain is backed by science and chosen for its ability to repair gut lining, fight harmful bacteria, and rebalance your microbiome.

‚úÖ No Refrigeration Needed ‚Äì PrimeBiome uses a heat-stable formula, so it‚Äôs easy to take on-the-go and travel with. Convenience matters!

‚úÖ Third-Party Tested ‚Äì You can trust the label. There are no hidden fillers, no fake ingredients, and no shady practices. What you see is what you get.

‚úÖ Real, Lasting Results ‚Äì Most supplements promise the moon and deliver nothing. PrimeBiome is one of the only supplements that actually delivered visible, tangible, lasting changes in my health.

Who Should Use PrimeBiome?

If you suffer from:

Bloating or gas

Irregular bowel movements

Leaky gut or food intolerances

Fatigue, brain fog, or mood swings

Skin issues like acne or rashes

Weakened immunity

He has mentioned he lowkey has a meltdown over others success in coffee with karan i believe. Will he break his customary launch of nepos or try harder?!?,"**1.** Also cuz Dharma just got acquired and there is stress to put out one good hit. No good movies in years and gosh it seems none of the nepos worked for him. I wonder if it was the terrible acting, the shitty scripts or just lack of effort, emotion and soul. I think the yrf debuts acted better but the budget of kjo seemed higher visually and even that archies film. Also idk if its true but people said yrf worked on this for a year and I dont think kjo puts that kind of slow burn effort in films as far as ik. but a part of me wants to know how Kjo is holding up lmfaooo. Promoting his new film rn must be brutall for him in these halat. if any insider has tea?!? much appreciated hehe. I really wanna know how the other new nepos and Kjo have mourned or grieved about this or not. Also idk if we can blame the nepos, he takes accountability for casting them. So like has he lost that K3G touch where he could cast, get good scripts and put emotion and soul into films that are literally cult films. His films were all the rage because they were good. There was magic in every song back then.  But MM clothes, rich life, botox, schools with no kitabien in films just doesn't work that well no more. Don't like yrf for what they do to people's faces and history obviously.

Hey there,

I‚Äôm a 32-year-old introvert with a not-so-secret wild streak, splitting my time between the cozy corners of Jalandhar and the electric buzz of Delhi on weekends. I might seem reserved at first, but beneath the surface, I‚Äôm all about cheeky banter, spontaneous adventures, and making memories that leave us both smiling long after the night ends.

I believe in the magic of a lingering glance, the thrill of inside jokes, and the art of making a woman feel truly desired. Whether it‚Äôs a flirty compliment whispered over coffee or a slow, meaningful conversation under the stars, I know how to make you feel like you‚Äôre the only woman in the room.

My ideal partner? Someone who‚Äôs as comfortable getting lost in deep, late-night talks as she is sneaking away for a weekend escape. I adore a woman who can match my wit, challenge my ideas, and isn‚Äôt afraid to let her playful side show.

When I‚Äôm not exploring new places (or new pleasures), you‚Äôll find me curled up with a novel, binging Netflix, or planning my next little adventure, always leaving room for a partner-in-crime to join me.

If you‚Äôre craving connection, laughter, and maybe a little bit of mischief, send me a message. Let‚Äôs see if we can turn sparks into something unforgettable.

So here's to us all continuing to try to find whatever it is we're looking for ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Just a blue eyed 5'9 guy here that likes to stay up late and have deep or provocative conversations with a woman I'm into. Unfortunately its hard at moment to have those experiences currently,  since I'm fairly introverted at times and find it hard to think someone has maintained interest in me.. But aside from that ramble here's a little about me(a bit of a read, but I think it covers some important things)

I enjoy staying active and seeing how the weather changes the color of my surroundings.. 

Lately I haven't been so much into gaming as I used to be. Would rather have someone to enjoy the experiences with that I used to enjoy alone. It'd be nice to have a duo partner for a game like Fortnite,  Escape from Tarkov,  Hunt:Showdown, Apex, or PUBG again since those are all games I've loved. But you having an interest in gaming isn't necessary, it just might help us connect.

It'd also be nice to have omeone to laugh with and banter with as we just watch something goofy, dark, or exciting together while we have a late night voice chat.

But, I'd like to start things off with something casual, exchange pictures early on so we know we are attracted to each other.. Then we can find a way to hear each other where we are both comfortable so it's easier to establish a vibe.

Here is a comic panel set in the retroactive continuity that the Zootopia comic series from Dynamite Entertainment is set in, (These comics are non-canon to the Zootopia franchise as Zootopia 2 is set a week after the first Zootopia movie and these comics feel like they are set a month after the first movie and there is no way their events could happen all in one week before the events of the sequel, or could they?) which focuses on in the aftermath of solving the PB&J case and catching and killing the criminal masterminds behind it all in Issue Six, who turn out to be a Spix's macaw named Nymo, as well as his Spix's macaw girlfriend Rebecca head of the rival cell phone company Tovon Spix and Chief Bogo as well as Major Friedkin (Evil All Along) who had face-heel turns and became a lawfully evil villain and rabid cop after the first Zootopia movie and before the comics, (Both villains have well-written motivations and an ineffectual sympathetic villain, anti-villain and well-intentioned extremist goal behind their evil intentions.) a sassy but also well-meaning giraffe gentle giant military soldier named Amelia Spots became the new police commissioner of the ZPD after Bogo's death and became a nicer, more supportive, generous and soft-spoken boss to the ZPD's cops especially Nick and Judy than Bogo was, and promotes Nick and Judy to a police sergeant and police lieutenant now operating in their own shared office as a reward for again solving the biggest case the city has ever seen, while Nick and Judy's relationship starts to become romantic: (A gray wolf cop named Owen Gray also becomes the new teacher of the Zootopia Police Academy after Friedkin's death.) Judy also got a new carrot pen after her original one was destroyed by the Razorbacks, Bogo's henchmen while Nick gets himself a pawisicple pen.

It is either set in the normal Zootopia comic series in the comic issue, **Night Patrol** which focuses on Nick making the best out of his new position as a police sergeant by working alongside all the cops in his elite squad catching and arresting several criminals in one day. Nick even chases and arrests a Virigina Opossum burglar named Moe Wormtail through Little Rodentia and saves Brianca from Zootopia+ related to the weasel chase in the first Zootopia movie, but Judy gets the worst of her new position as a police lieutenant in terms of being restricted to the police station having to send the cops in her elite squad out to solve police assignments on their own and solve several different police assignments at once, which puts her in a bad mood. After showing concern over Judy's bad mood as mentioned in this comic above, Nick decides to give himself and Judy some time off their police sergeant and police lieutenant duties by doing night patrol as regular cops over Zootopia's Rainforest District the following night, and in the process, Judy apologizes to Nick for her bad mood and they both met the old eccentric spectated flying fox millionaire Bruce Happenheimer head of TovonUp from Nick's hustling days at his mansion and he aids the two cops in helping them stop a heist or genocide/homicide going on in the Rainforest District by the laughably evil and love to hate albino tiger legendary figure Victor Pale MadClaw mysteriously connected to Nick's past as well as his team of Asian mammal criminals plus burglars plus Moe who was just bailed from the police, in return for helping him deal with a feud with his rival millionaire company, HovonCo lead by the compulsive red ruffed lemur or aye-aye millionaire Sasha Janet which involves an unlikely romance between Bruce's spectated flying fox daughter and famous pop musician Katie and Sasha's red ruffed lemur or aye-aye son Gordon.

Nick and Judy stay awake all night while on Night Patrol and arrest Moe again and all the criminals on Victor's side though Victor manages to get away. Amelia who cares about Nick and Judy's well-being unlike Bogo rewards them for their hard work by giving them a break to sleep and catch up on rest all that day in Zootopia's nap room or at their house which they moved into and became roommates in after the events of Issue Six: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qifuF99oKg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qifuF99oKg) [https://www.reddit.com/r/zootopia/comments/1m3cgkf/bunkmates\_credit\_aaronjay/](https://www.reddit.com/r/zootopia/comments/1m3cgkf/bunkmates_credit_aaronjay/)

Or it is set in the Marvel Animal Superhero or DC Animal Superhero Comic Crossovers (If you want an expanded summary leave your replies in the comments below.) in the **Nick and Judy** **as Cloak and Dagger** story arc, or **Hit Me With Your Best Shot story** arc, or **Nighthawks** story arc. (It also switches the genre in the Zootopia franchise from buddy cop to superhero duo.)

**Nick and Judy as Cloak and Dagger:** While Nick Wilde and Judy Hopps as the animal superheroes, The Ultimate Spider-Fox and The Amazing Spider-Bunny are serving as co-police commissioners of the police force of Zoo York City/New York City and Glen Rose City in the 1990s-vibe Marvel Animal Superhero Universe #13, while Gazelle and Clawhauser as the animal superheroes, The Glitter Butterfly-Gazelle and Blue Butterfly-Gazelle serve as the mayor and vice mayor of one of the cities to encourage the public to allow superheroism and vigilantism, (Meanwhile the resurrected Chief Bogo as the Asgardian African buffalo superhero, The Asgardian Gatekeeper becomes the gatekeeper of Asgard and its bifrost bridge while Tripp Zebrando and Officer Johnson become the frost giant zebra disguised as an Asgardian zebra Loki Zebra and Asgardian African lion superhero, Thor Lion and you get the idea. Bogo might instead appear as a supervillain, The Asgardian Gladiator, later the cyborg Bulltron to deliver the funny idea of the roles of Heimdall and Loki as a hero and villain being swooped around in the Marvel Universe. The resurrected Major Friedkin also appears as the Asgardian supervillain, Hala and the resurrected Rebeeca and Nymo appear as supervillains in the Fine Feathered Fiends and you get the idea.) Judy's police commissioner duties put her in a bad mood as it doesn't allow her to go out to serve as a superhero protecting the city from criminals, villains, etc. so Nick to ensure Judy's well-being after a pep talk with Buster Moon and Suki Lane from the Sing franchise as the mutant animal superheroes, Kombat Koala and Flashlight Saluki, from the X-Animals, decides to have him and Judy take a break from their police duties for a while, making The Ultimate Spider-Fox/Christopher Foxtrot and The Amazing Spider-Bunny/Elizabeth Cottontail from another universe, 2000s and 2010s vibe Marvel Animal Superhero Universe #13 become the substitute police commissioners of the  Zoo York City/New York City and Glen Rose City police forces, which puts Judy in a good mood and she apologizes to Nick. Nick and Judy as The Ultimate Spider-Fox and The Amazing Spider-Bunny work alongside the other animal superheroes in The Spectacular Spider-Fox Family and Incredible Butterfly-Gazelle family and maybe also the Fabolus Animal Four #1 or 2 or Animal Defenders to protect Glen Rose City, Zoo York City and Chicago from animal supervillains like the Fine Feathered Fiends, Animal Sinister Six, Toxos and enforcers from The Clay Club of laughably evil clay people and creatures inspired by Gumby, etc. but that's another story. before eventually the red fox and gray rabbit superhero duo Cloak/Rick and Dagger/Trudy have themselves and The Ulimate Spider-Fox/Nick and The Amazing Spider-Bunny/Judy switch places as the animal superheroes they are for three days, to use their different superpowers to defeat the animal supervillain duo together in a team-up, Lord Iconix/Sorcerer Hyena the striped hyena with Masters of the Mystic Arts magic and Dr. Meow the half cyborg half Siamese cat tragic villain before the effects of the effects of the science invention from Fantastic Otter/Emmitt Otterton and Invisible Otter/Mrs. Otterton from the Fabolus Animal Four that caused Cloak/Rick and Dagger/Trudy and the Ultimate Spider-Fox/Nick and The Amazing Spider-Bunny/Judy to swoop each other's superpowers wears off. 

**Nighthawks:** While Nick and Judy operate as a Krypontian red fox superhero, Super-fox and Amazon gray rabbit superhero Wonder Rabbit in Metropolis (Armed with the Fortress of Soltitute, Phantom Zone projector and Lasso of Truth plus Invisible Jet.) working as news reporters in The Daily Planet and other jobs expect police work like as Archaeologists whenever they don't work as superheroes, Judy misses working as a cop so Nick takes her to Gotham City where the white tailed deer vigilante superhero duo, Bat-Deer/Boris Cerro (CEO of Cerro Enterprises. His butler and surrogate father is the owl Benson Feathers.) and Bat-Doe/Clarie Whitetail plus their white-tailed deer foal junior vigilante superhero son Robin-Deer/Clifford Whitetail operate to work as both a superhero and a cop for a week and in the process, become Robin-Fox and Bat-Bunny to help the Bat-Deer defeat the schemes of a team of supervillains that are their archenemies, the Nighthawks, who are literal hawks and vultures, and Nick and Judy become Super-fox and Wonder Rabbit again to protect Metropolis from Nymo and Rebecca heads of NymoCorp who terrorize the city using two giant robots with plans for world domination. 

**Hit Me With Your Best Shot:** The Ulimate Spider-Fox/Nick and The Amazing Spider-Bunny/Judy become honorary members of the Wonder Animals of the Galaxy for a week and you get the idea. 

Nick Wilde appears as the main protagonist of these comics while Judy Hopps is demoted to the dueteragonist, but the dynamic between the two main characters remains.

The recipe states to take the cake out of the oven when the center of the cake reaches 140 degrees F. I baked in an approximately 8.75‚Äù springform, in a water bath. I

initially pulled the cake out at about 20 minutes because my digital thermometer read slightly above 140. The cake appeared too jiggly, so I baked for an additional 5 minutes, panicked about over baking, and pulled it out to cool. The center of the cake was at or slightly above 140 degrees as the recipe called for.

The edges had puffed up slightly and began to pull away fr the pan. The issue I am having is that there is no crust formed on the top of the cake, and still quite a bit of moisture. I am wondering if the eggs had more moisture in them than expected, or if it was because of the ‚Äúoptional‚Äù 1/4 C coffee I added.

After about 30 min resting, the majority of the cake is still very jiggly. Should I wait it out and put it in the fridge overnight? Could I even put it back in the oven at this point?

Maybe I‚Äôm panicking for nothing, but I‚Äôm hoping someone with more experience has so advice/reassurance for me!!!

(I will be baking a second cake as I needed two, and likely move this one up a to one shelf level higher in my oven to see if this helps)

Recipe is 8 eggs beaten to a foam and folded into combined melted chocolate (1lb), 2 sticks of butter, and 1/4 C coffee. Recipe calls for removal from oven when center of cake reaches 140 deg F.",1,1753634728.0,AskBaking,2,1.0,False

I am the co-founder of Crown Envy ‚Äî a brand new, women-owned hair salon located right here in Mid-City. We opened with a mission: to bring top-notch, on-trend hair services to our community at mid-level pricing ‚Äî no outrageous markups, no price gouging. All our pricing is listed on our website so you know upfront what your visit will cost. 

Just honest work, beautiful hair, and a salon experience you can actually look forward to. You even get a free drink on the house (mimosa, wine, coffee, tea). The founders are two moms who are working on building a brand, and have big aspirations to eventually open multiple locations, along with their own product line.

We have created our own line of hair extensions, and our goal is to be able to bring them to the masses without the high price tag.

We also believe in doing right by our team. All of our full-time employees receive health insurance they can actually use (with small co-pays and no deductible), and we pay livable wages because great hair starts with happy, supported stylists. We also invest in monthly paid education and training, so our stylists are always on top of the latest trends, techniques, and products.

We‚Äôre here because we love what we do, and we care about this community. If you‚Äôre looking for a new spot for a cut, color, extensions, or just a killer blowout ‚Äî we‚Äôd love for you to check us out or help us spread the word!

How to build a car kit for survival
Build a survival kit for your car!
Prepare your car for emergencies and build a car kit.

Prepare your car for emergencies.
You spend a lot of time in your car commuting to work or school, 
running errands and travelling on vacations and weekends. If 
catastrophe strikes, big or small, you can be ready with a survival 
kit. Build a survival kit for your car!

With a well-equipped kit in your car you can have virtually 
everything you might need to survive. Build a survival kit with a 
sturdy utility box right. Make space under the car seat, in the 
trunk or tucked in the glove compartment or the seat pockets for 
these ""must haves"" in your car...

How to build a car kit for survival
Here's our list of essential things to keep in your vehicles for 
survival, so you're ready for bugging out:

Car Kit Item #1:  Water, metal water container, filter 
and tablets.
When building your car emergency kit, remember the water 
purification Preppers seem to underscore the importance of water 
storage for their home, but for travel water is doubly important! 
Always carry water in your ride, along with ways to purify water in 
case you get stuck somewhere.

* Water. Always carry fresh water with you. Fill a BPA-free  bottle with filtered water, (we recommend the Big Berkey  water filtration system), tap water if you must, but carry  water with you always.

* Metal water container. With a metal water container, you  can boil water if need be. The metal water container will also  be useful if you pack food, which you can cook.

* Water purficiation tablets. Potable Aqua tablets will help  you source water in an emergency.

* Water straw filter. A water filter such as AquaMira,  Lifestraw, Sawyer).

* Drinking water. Water is life. Be sure to stock some Datrex  Emergency Water packets or your water bottle!

Car Kit Item #2: Fire Starter.
A fire starter should be part of your everyday carry. In fact, you 
should have at least
three methods available to you, for example:
1. A Swedish Fire Steel, pictured  right in orange, is an  excellent addition to your collection.
2. Hurricane matches, also pictured right would make another  good everyday carry for your car.
3. BIC lighter or a Zippo lighter. They are dependable fire  starters!

Here's a tip for fire starting: pack a pencil sharpener (or a tinder 
box), so you'll be able to shave sticks into tinder.

Car Kit Item #3: Fixed Blade Knife.
Why carry a fixed blade knife in your vehicle? There is no lock to 
fail! Seriously, check local laws and you may find that carrying a 
folding knife is illegal, while a fixed blade knife is not illegal. 
Knife up on knife laws.

If you don't already carry a firearm (and even if you do) consider 
having any kind of legal survival knife handy in the car. You may 
find it necessary to escape a dangerous situation with people 
(mob or individual), or may find yourself stranded in the car to 
survive the night.

Right is the MTech USA fixed blade hunting and survival knife. 
The ABS handle features wing walk inserts which provide a 
superior grip in even the wettest of conditions. Ideal for camping 
expeditions and survival training, this knife has a 7-inch stainless 
steel blade, and a handle with a glass breaker on the end making 
this knife useful in any rescue situation. This knife comes 
complete with a black nylon sheath for easy and safe carry.

Car Kit Item #4: Emergency Blanket or Bivvy.
Winterize your car with a wool blanket ready for emergencies. For 
trauma, shock or fire, or snow and ice conditions, an emergency 
blanket is essential and wool is best. At minimum, vehicles 
should contain a mylar blanket, which can fold flat into the glove 
compartment:

* Bivvy. A bivvy is a lightweight sleeping bag designed to  retain body heat and is an absolute necessity when traveling  in snow. The slogan on the orange bivvy, pictured right,  is  ""Expect the unexpected."" That's so true!

* Emergency Blanket: The quality emergency blanket,  pictured immediate left in orange is made of a flame  retardant fabric. Because of the moisture and oils present in  wool fiber, when exposed to a flame, wool fabric self  extinguishes and turns to ash. Made in the United States,  it's loom woven with 80-percent wool and 20-percent  synthetic reflective material.

* Space Blanket: A space blanket is thicker than Mylar.  Originally developed for NASA, the MPA Space All Weather  Blanket, pictured right in a variety of colors, is warmer than  wool pound for pound. It retains 80% of radiated body heat,  preventing hypothermia and providing unsurpassed  protection in sub-zero temperatures.

* Mylar Blanket. The most economical option is a mylar  blanket. A pack of ten is under $7. It's also a space saver!  Mylar blankets have many survival purposes. Include one in  your bugout bag! Ensure you have two mylar blankets: one  for each passenger seat in your vehicle. One mylar is for the  ground to prevent dampness and the other is to help retain  body heat.

* Heavy Duty Garbage Bag. Even a trash bag can help you  retain warmth in an emergency situation, and is considered  the poor man's bivvy! A trash bag is also convenient as a  biohazard bag. Learn the many survival uses of plastic bags.

* Hand Warmers. Be sure to add hand warmers to your list,  particularly if you live or drive in snow regions!

Car Essential #5:  Car Escape Tools.
It's natural for preppers to think about ""Getting out of Dodge,"" 
but what if a prepper's survival depends on getting out of a 
Dodge (or a Ford, Toyota, or Jeep, etc.). Entrapment is an 
everyday survival concern and easily mitigated with access to the 
proper tools.

Where to stow it! Stow the car escape tool in your car's center 
console a lifesaver that cuts seatbelt latch and breaks glass to 
escape your vehicle!

* Life hammer. Escape entrapment in your car with Life  Hammer! Be prepared for an earthquake or accident with the  Life Hammer Escape tool, pictured left in red. Its double- sided, steel hammer head breaks through side and rear  windows. Life Hammer's razor-sharp blade cuts easily  through safety belts. Includes a mounting bracket for  installation. A fluorescent pin glows in the dark for easy  retrieval.

* Ranger Rescue Entry Tool. The Ranger Rescue Entry Tool,  pictured above is a professional grade tool that combines the  functionality of five separate devices into one universal head  design. Use the Ranger Rescue Entry Tool  as an axe, prybar,  hydrant wrench, gas shut off and spanner wrench (2 1/2""  hoses and water mains). This tool is a necessity for all  emergency and rescue professionals, and a real luxury for  preppers. It weighs 6.35 lbs. Be prepared for anything, even  self-defense with this tool if you have extra room to store it.

* Get yourself unstuck with a tow strap! The Neiko tow  strap, pictured left in yellow can help you tow 10,000 lbs,  which is more than strong enough to extract any vehicle from  a ditch or rough spot. With two safety hooks on both ends,  this tow strap allows for easy and fast hook ups and  releases.

Car Essential #6: Gas Siphon and/or a Gas Can.
Worry not that a gas siphon is an item for petty criminals. A 
siphon pump is a good idea to carry with you on your travels in 
good times and in bad. Good Samaritans exist and will allow you 
to pump a bit of their gas into your car should you need it.
You can worry later about the unethical dilemmas you may face in 
uncertain times when gas is hard to secure (and you have a 
means to secure some). Carry also a gas can! It is otherwise 
unwise and unsafe to carry gasoline in an open container.

* Gas Siphon: Safety experts caution against the unsafe  practice of siphoning petroleum by mouth, warning  specifically, that it can result in loss of life. Beckson's  answer is the patented Siphon-Mate¬Æ pump; a combination  displacement lift pump and siphon pump with valves suitable  for transferring fuel. Pictured left, the Beckson Transfer Pump  for fuel Pump half strokes to start flow. Once flow begins,  fully extending the handle will allow siphoning rovided that  the source is higher in elevation than the receptacle.

* Multi-Use Pump Siphon: Liquid transfer of gasoline, water or  air with the multi-use Siphon Inflation Pump with Hose. Ideal  for transferring gas from the truck's tank or other large  containers into engine tanks while in the field. Dual-action  pump. The intake tube is placed at the bottom of the liquid  to be moved and the outgoing tube is fed into the receptacle  receiving the liquid. Pump the handle a couple times to  prime the pump and then pull the handle fully out. To stop  the flow at any time, simply depress the handle.  U.S. made,  it also helps inflate toys!

* Gas Can: The No-Spill 1450 5-Gallon Poly Gas Can is CARB  and EPA Compliant. Most spills happen when tipping a  normal can to get the spout into the tank opening before the  liquid comes out, or removing the spout from the target  vessel before overflowing. The No-Spill spout is fully in your  control, so you tip the can vertical, insert the spout into the  vessel opening, then press the button to begin and control  pouring. To stop pouring just release the button. It  practically eliminates spills and overflows!

Car Essential #7: Cash.
Cash is king in an emergency. The electricity may be out, and 
having cash to buy the necessities could mean the difference 
between life and death. Think for example of being in a pharmacy 
trying to get a vital prescription, or at a gas station and all you 
have is a useless credit card, but the hurricane is headed your 
way. The importance of carrying cash in your car is essential.

You can hide money in the crevices of your vehicle. Just make 
sure that your hiding spot isn't found by the valets, mechanics 
and auto-detailers who may have access to your vehicle.

Car Essential #8: Wheels or Walking Shoes.
Preppers always have a contingency plan for getting home or 
""getting out of dodge."" In case your car won't start, or in case all 
cars won't work, as with an ElectroMagnetic Pulse (EMP), you'll 
need to stow either wheels or good walking shoes! Proper 
navigation is essential, so have a compass and a map on hand as
well:
* Fold up bike.
* Scooter
* Skateboard
* Roller skates
* Skis
* Snow shoes
* Walking shoes. You won't want to safety in flip flops,  sandals or high heels in case debris is blocking the way. A  pair of sturdy and comfortable old shoes or boots in your car  will provide a means of hiking long distances, should you be  unable to take public transportation or your car to safety.  Old shoes have the benefit of being less likely to blister, but  just in case, add moleskin or BlisterMedic to your car kit.

Car Essential #9: Vehicle First Aid Kit.
Be equipped to deal with an accident or minor mishap by having a 
first aid kit handy. Almost everything you will need is in the metal 
container of this handy vehicle first aid kit.

* QuickClot: Be sure to add QuikClot¬Æ Sport‚Ñ¢ Silver to your  first aid, which has added antibacterial advantage of ionic  silver. Silver acts to prevent the growth of bacteria and fungi  which can be especially important if medical care is not  immediately available (or ever at all).

* Wool Blanket. A wool blanket is essential to help a shock  victim, and can be a lifesaver in inclement weather. Not only  is wool the warmest natural fiber, a wool blanket can also  help put out a fire.

* Pandemic supplies. Having a few simple pandemic supplies  handy is another convenience to have. Keep supplies ready  in the glove compartment, including an antiviral mask or  respirator, and nitrile gloves. For your glove box, get an  Official Department of Defense Pandemic Flu Preparedness &  Protection Kit for around $7.75. pictured right. This official  kit contains 2 NIOSH-approved N95 Masks,  4 surgical masks,  a 4oz bottle of hand sanitizer and an information card.

Car Essential#10: Food and Snacks.

* Ration bars. Here's food for thought: include Datrex  Emergency Ration Bars in your car.  Ration bars are too  heavy for the bugout bag, but ideal for storage in remote  locations, cars, trucks, and boats. In fact, Datrex ration bars  originally were created for watercraft preparedness purposes,  ensuring rations for survivors stranded at sea, because they  are non-thirst provoking. Datrex ration bars provide ""smooth  sailing"" and peace of mind because they:
* U.S. Coast Guard approved!
* Are ready to eat (no cooking required);
* Offer a high energy value;
* Are non-thirst provoking;
* Have a five-year shelf life
* Withstand fluctuations of heat and cold in your car.
* Are in tablets sub-packaged for ease of rationing.

Not into coconut? There are bars available in other brands and 
flavors. Here is the complete review of ration bars.
Ensure you have some food in your vehicle (provided you're not 
living in bear country) and a folding stove or other means to cook:

* MREs. For long trips, it's imperative to pack Meals Ready to  Eat,or freeze dried foods with a means to cook. Even for  short trips, you may like the added security of these foods  on your journey. The advantage of MREs is you don't need to  bring extra water or a stove to cook them - the flameless  heater uses any kind of water whether it's potable or not.  However, in freezing temperatures, you should not rough  handle.

* Snacks: Beef Jerky is a great item to stock in the car, but  don't stop there. Dried fruits and nuts are wonderful addition  (provided there are no allergies). Remember the protein  bars! Datrex bars are another good survival option.

* Hard Candy and Gum, 5-hour Energy Bottle. Also often  overlooked by even the most advanced preppers and super  easy to store in your car is hard candy, gum and an energy  drink.

* Gum. Chewing gum is for survival! It provides a stress  release and helps aid in concentration, and so much  more. The sweetness boost is also a morale. In a car  emergency situation, you can use gum for temporary  repair of a radiator to plug a leaky hose. Want to learn  more about the uses of gum? You'd be surprised that  you can also use gum as catfish bait! Learn more  interesting facts about gum and uses for preppers.

* Hard candy. Why pack hard candy for survival?  Lifesavers could well be a lifesaver! The sugar in hard  candy provides excellent quick energy for activities,  which you may need if you're stuck on the road. Look for  organic varieties and those made with real cane sugar.  If the label reads ""sugar"" then it very likely is beet  sugar, a GMO product to avoid.

* 5-hour Energy drink. At only two ounces it goes down fast,  a 5-hour energy drink has zero sugar, zero herbal stimulants  and only four calories. It's packed with B-vitamins, amino  acids, nutrients and as much caffeine as a cup of the leading  premium coffee. That will get you going if you need to  prepare an escape by foot power.

Car Essentials #11: Tarp or Camouflage for your Car.
The time may come when it's best to go undetected. With a little 
advanced planning, you can hide in plain sight using special 
netting designed to make your car look like it's part of mother 
nature. Get enough to cover your vehicle, then make sure to
cover add local foliage to enhance the look. Right, you'll find 
camouflage cover for your vehicle, bike

Car Essential #12: Power Inverter.
Turn the DC current from your vehicle into AC current for your 
survival and communications gadgets. It's the next best thing, if 
you don't have a generator.

Pictured immediate right in red is the best selling power inverter 
you'll find for the price (it's under $30). It has the highest review 
rating of any power inverter brand. It's a 300W power inverter 
with 2 USB ports and 2 AC outlets. This is a road trip ""must have"" 
with wide range of applications for preppers. Full protection 
features and auto-shutdown keep your appliance and car from 
damage.

Car Essential #13: Shovel.
Consider a folding shovel. The Gerber Gorge folding shovel,
immediate right, is an essential hand tool for any prepper 
whether at home, camping or on the road.

Incredibly versatile is ergonomically minded to help with light 
snow shoveling around tires and even strong enough to break ice 
to get you out if you're stuck in the snow. Don't overlook this 
important car essential just because you don't live in the snow. A 
shovel can help you dig an emergency latrine or serve as an 
improvised weapon. It's small enough to toss in your bugout bag 
without weighing you down. Besides its digging abilities, it's able 
to operate in hammer mode, which is an ideal option for pounding 
in tent
stakes.

Car Essential #14: Sanitary Supplies.
Personal emergencies happen, not just if you're a woman. Even if 
you don't have room for a portable toilet, pack the sanitation 
essentials in your car for proper sanitation, including:
* toilet paper and facial tissues
* Paper towels (or shop towels)
* Hand wipes and hand sanitizers
* Sanitary napkins (they also come in handy in first aid)
* Plastic Bag Survival tip: Store sanitary supplies inside zipped  plastic bags to
* keep all your paper products dry and your hand wipes and  sanitizer moist.

The bag itself may prove useful for survival to collect water.

Car Essential #15: Communications.
Important for snow drenched regions, or hurricane country, 
tornado alley or flood-prone zones, an ambient weather radio 
communications device could be a livesaving
decision for your family. And in earthquake zones, you will always 
have access to communications about the events that have 
transpired. During the 1989 earthquake in California, people were 
huddled by the radios not quite sure about what to do.

* Cell phone.
* Cell phone recharger.

Car Essential #16: Fire extinguisher.
A fire extinguisher can save your life. Do you know how to use 
one? Here's a prepper's guide to using a fire extinguisher.

Car Essential #17: Car repair kit.
A car repair kit is an essential. Look for one that contains bit 
driver, slip joint plier, drive ratchet handle, driver extension bar, 
drive spark plug socket, adapter,  cable ties, SAE Hex keys, drive 
sockets, and bits.

Bonus: Welding equipment? Well that's a little extreme, but 
many advanced preppers bring along welding equipment.
Above, Practical Preppers, consultants to Doomsdsay Preppers, illustrates the 
importance for advanced preppers on using welding equipment in their car 
kits.

Finally, be careful to stay a safe distance from traffic that passes. 
You can aid your chances for survival with flares and by wearing 
brightly colored clothing. Why not pack an orange reflective vest in 
your car for added measure?

Road Assistance Kit
* Having the tools to get you back on the road takes only the  foresight of buying a kit.
* The compact 70-piece road assistance kit by AAA, top center  of page, includes:
* 1 heavy duty booster jumper cable
* 1 hand-charged dual LED flashlight
* 1 pair of dimpled work gloves
* 1 emergency poncho
* 1 emergency whistle
* 1 flat head screwdriver
* 1 Phillips head screwdriver
* 1 roll of duct tape
* 1 utility knife
* 1 bungee cord
* 2 shop cloths
* 10 cable ties, and
* 45 piece first-aid kit

Now let's tall about the ordinary things you'd expect to have in 
your car...
* Air filter - Be sure to check your car's air filter ever 12,000  miles. A clean air filter helps keep damaging particles from  entering your engine and causing increased engine wear.
* cardboard or cat litter - for icy and snow conditions to get  traction.
* car manual
* flare and reflective triangle
* first aid kit
* flashlight or a headlamp
* fluids - Oil change, transmission fluid, and radiator coolant.
* ice scraper
* jumper cables
* paper towels or sham  to clean windshield visibility
* proof of insurance
* registration - yeah, you only need this one for the authorities
* spare tire
* shovel*
* tire jack
* tire pressure gauge
* tire chains
* WD-40
* wiper blades (replace them every winter)

Six things to avoid being stranded if your car breaks 
down:
Being prepared is about having the essentials on hand if your car 
breaks down. Here is a list of the top things to consider so you'll 
have the major things you need to deal with roadside emergencies:

* #1: Air pressure. Maintaining proper air pressure will help  keep your tires in top shape. A good tire gauge can help you  keep track of the air pressure. Keeping the air pressure on  your vehicle is free at the service station, but there are also  While you're at it, check the spare.

* #2: Coolant. If you don't take proper care of your vehicle's  factory installed coolant, you'll spend almost $2000 on fixing it  with a new radiator, heater core and water pump. Worse yet,  you void the extended warranty by not regularly maintaining  your vehicles coolant system. Ensure fluids are always  between the maximum and the minimum line.

* #3: Oil and Oil filter. It almost goes without saying to keep  clean oil lubricating your vehicle, but an often overlooked  component of car care is the oil filter. The oil filter provides  the necessary layer between debris and critical parts of your  car. Don't wait for your oil filter to disintegrate and cost you  hundreds in repair bills.

* #4: Spark plugs. A spark plug doesn't cost much, but if you  don't maintain them or your vehicles, you'll spend around $500  in ignition-related repairs. Prevent misfires, which damage  spark plug wires, along with the ignition coils by taking  necessary maintenance precautions.

* #5: Timing Belt (Luxury item). One sure fire way to get  yourself stranded is to have a broken timing belt. It's never  convenient, but as Murphy's law will have, it will probably  happen when the temperatures are dangerously high, or when  you're escaping a storm. More about timing belts versus  chains... On replacing timing belts you must take care to  ensure that the valve and piston movements synchronize  correctly. Get the parts you need on Amazon.

* #6: Transmission fluid. The cost of rebuilding a transmission  is a few thousand dollars, but far more expensive to the  prepper is being stuck when the transmission goes out and  there's no way to get a repair.

How to survive a night in your car.
What you may stock in your car as a prepper is vastly different 
from conventional thinking if you want to learn how to survive a 
night in the car, you'll have to think deeper. Traditionally car 
essentials might include jumper cables, a blanket and a little white-
boxed first aid kit. Those are all excellent things to have in your 
car; however, the prepper list of car essentials to consider for your 
personal survival plan is far more extensive. We've gathered a list 
of essential items to stock in your vehicle to survive the night and 
help prepare for a life-changing catastrophe...

While there is a lot of survival gear you could include in your car or 
truck, if you had to pair it down to three things, then these three 
items would virtually guarantee your survival ~ a quality fixed 
blade knife, a metal water container (appropriate also for 
cooking/boiling water) and a fire starter.

Getting your car kit together may take some planning, but it will be 
well worth the effort.

Happy endings...
Now you know how to build a car kit for survival, but if you had to 
pair it down to three things, then these items would virtually 
guarantee your survival ‚Äî a quality fixed blade knife, a metal 
water container, and a fire starter. Make sure always to have these 
things with you at all times with several redundancies in your get 
home bag, bugout bag and 72-hour emergency kits.

The road less travelled is never as interesting. Pack your vehicles 
and enjoy when the rubber meets the road. You can handle 
anything that comes your way, because you're a prepper!

I moved to a new state and came with essentially no food or pantry staples or anything. This post is to help me organize myself and also show my thought process when I am meal planning and proving to myself that I can get by on what I have in my house until my next paycheck comes! 

TL;DR - have spent 116.70 on groceries in last two weeks, let's do a no spend week using what I have in my Fridge and Pantry! I don't think I have enough to get me through next Sunday and still stay sane but I am trying to make it to Friday at least because that is when I will get my paycheck. Sorry the formatting stinks, don't have the will to change it lol

I have spent a total of 39.11 + 27.57+ 30.02 at Aldi on food in the last 2 weeks since I have been here and about $20 at Walmart (116.70) 
Of that, 10.83 was on spices, $12 on avocado oil. I also spent 8.99 on a 6 pack of hard cider- a luxury. 
I am basically eating vegetarian, which makes this a great budget challenge but also allows me to decrease the amount of saturated fats I‚Äôm eating. With full transparency, I have also eaten out 4 times in the last 2 weeks but I have settled into a good pattern and plan on sticking to a budget eating out moving forward. 

What I have to work with in my fridge and pantry is: 
* Avocado oil for cooking ($12)
* 2lb beans 1.95
* ¬Ω lb lentils 1.39/2 
* ¬Ω lb quinoa 3.99/2 
* ¬Ω loaf of white bread (loaf was on clearance for 50c at dollar tree) 
* 1 box of fancy Mac and cheese 2.19
* 1 jar of peanut butter (‚Öî full) 1.99*‚Öî 
* 1 container oats (~38 oz remaining) 3.99 total (~10c pe oz)
* 6 protein bars 1.13 each 
* 4 veggie burgers 87c ea
* 4 tortillas 20c ea
* 5 slices of provolone cheese 15c ea
* ¬º pint raspberries ~$1
* 2 bananas - 21c ea
* 1 apple - got this free from work 
* 1 lb carrots - 1.39 (/2) 
* 3 persian cucumbers 1.89/2
* 3 bell peppers 2.59
* Some green onions .95/3  
* 1 block tofu 1.55 
* ¬Ω package of ground coffee
* ¬º container of premade cold brew coffee 
* ¬Ω container of garlic hummus
* 5 cans pear hard cider (8.99 for 6) 

With all of the above in mind, I am trying to do a no buy week and cook from my pantry above. I would have loved to grab a dozen eggs because I think it would make this challenge way easier and also add some protein but I am trying to stick to a no buy as I have a lot of stuff to use up. 
I will meal prep some beans and lentils on one of the days, probably Tuesday night as I have a chill day there.

Here is my plan: 

*Monday - will be a tough day- need to leave for work around 5:30 am 

breakfast will do the remaining cold brew coffee and a protein bar. 

Lunch: will do a tofu wrap in a tortilla w a slice of cheese. Side will be remaining raspberries, and slices of cucumber and carrot with a couple tablespoons of hummus. 

Dinner: Mac & cheese box with the remaining tofu stirred in. Should be good for 3 servings based on package size. 

*Tuesday - chiller day, don‚Äôt have to be in office until 10am

Breakfast - oatmeal with the apple, chopped up, coffee 

Lunch - leftover tofu Mac and cheese 

Snack bc this day doesnt have enough protein - 1 protein bar

Dinner - quinoa salad with remaining cucumbers, 1 slice cheese, 1 pepper. 

*Wednesday - normal work day. 

Breakfast - oatmeal with banana, coffee 

Lunch - veggie burger with cheese in a tortilla with hummus. snack of chopped carrots

Dinner: beans & lentils with 1 bell pepper

*Friday - normal work day. 

Breakfast: oatmeal with peanut butter, coffee, protein bar. 

Lunch: veggie burger wrap with slice of cheese, with carrots and hummus 

Dinner: beans and lentils vs going out to dinner.. not sure what I will do.

The recipe states to take the cake out of the oven when the center of the cake reaches 140 degrees F. I baked in an approximately 8.75‚Äù springform, in a water bath. I

 initially pulled the cake out at about 20 minutes because my digital thermometer read slightly above 140. The cake appeared too jiggly, so I baked for an additional 5 minutes, panicked about over baking, and pulled it out to cool. The center of the cake was at or slightly above 140 degrees as the recipe called for. 

The edges had puffed up slightly and began to pull away fr the pan. The issue I am having is that there is no crust formed on the top of the cake, and still quite a bit of moisture. I am wondering if the eggs had more moisture in them than expected, or if it was because of the ‚Äúoptional‚Äù 1/4 C coffee I added. 

After about 30 min resting, the majority of the cake is still very jiggly. Should I wait it out and put it in the fridge overnight? Could I even put it back in the oven at this point? 

Maybe I‚Äôm panicking for nothing, but I‚Äôm hoping someone with more experience has so advice/reassurance for me!!!

1maqxk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ghosting/comments/1maqxk7/i_got_ghosted_by_a_friend_i_deeply_cared_about/,"I got ghosted by a friend I deeply cared about, and I‚Äôm still struggling to understand why.","Sorry for the long post.

I (F) became close with a guy I met through a class we were both taking. We had a strong connection pretty quickly‚Äîdeep conversations, shared interests, and a lot of emotional openness. He sometimes said things that made me wonder if there was something more he was feeling like,  he told me I made him feel safe, he said he felt that we understood each other so well and that we needed each other, and early on he even subtly asked me out for coffee. We hung out several times outside of class, and there was a sense that we were building a friendship that maybe could be more, but I wasn‚Äôt sure and honestly I was careful not to overstep. I had a crush on/feelings for him but I really valued his friendship and didn‚Äôt want to risk losing it or making things awkward between us.

I thought that he was single. We‚Äôd known each other for almost half a year and he never mentioned that he was in a relationship or dating someone, despite us talking relationships and life and friends on several prior occasions. He randomly disclosed that he was dating a guy one day after we had known each other for almost half a year, and when he finally did disclose it, it was kind of sudden and vague, and he made it sound like it was a recent relationship. Also, not sure what his sexual identity is because he didn‚Äôt specifically mention it but I know he‚Äôs dated women in the past as well.

However, I met his partner for the first time a couple months later, and his partner told me they‚Äôd actually been together for a couple of years. The encounter was kind of tense. I was warm and open, trying to connect, but his partner was cold and distant. There were times when I noticed his partner glaring at me, or rolling his eyes when my friend and I were talking. 

Learning that him and his partner had been together for so long kind of hit me hard. Not only because I had developed feelings for him (which I had kept to myself out of respect and caution), but also because I felt blindsided. I would never have allowed myself to feel so deeply for him if I had known he was in a committed relationship. And by the time he finally told me he was in a relationship, I had already had feelings for him that I had to suddenly figure out how to deal with. I don‚Äôt understand why he had never said anything before this point.

Despite my feelings, I made sure to keep everything friendly and respectful. I never told him about my feelings and I was very careful in my behavior to make sure that I wasn‚Äôt being flirty or inappropriate because I respect people‚Äôs relationships. I wanted to honor his relationship, and honestly, I just really valued him as a friend at that point. I never flirted, never said anything inappropriate, and was always mindful of boundaries. Our messages and conversations always reflected that‚Ä¶.they were strictly friendly, talking about our shared interests, and supportive (in a friendly platonic way). Nothing inappropriate or intimate. And I dealt with my internal feelings for him on my own and with the help of my therapist, so that I could be sure that I was showing up in our friendship in a platonic and friendly manner.

After I met his partner, out of nowhere, my friend ghosted me. No explanation, no conversation, nothing.‚Ä¶ and he stopped responding to my messages.

I thought we had a real friendship. I thought I mattered to him. And I keep replaying everything in my mind, trying to figure out what I did wrong??? 

I‚Äôve been trying to make sense of it. Did his partner pressure him to cut ties with me? If so, why? I‚Äôve done nothing inappropriate. I supported him. I listened. I cared as a friend. And if he truly thought I was a threat to his relationship, even unintentionally, it makes me wonder what he thought of me all along? Did he really think I‚Äôd try to come between them? That I‚Äôm some sort of homewrecker? Because that couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. Also, at this point, idk what his sexuality is so I‚Äôm assuming I‚Äôm definitely not a threat to his relationship at all.

Or maybe it wasn‚Äôt his partner at all. Maybe he just didn‚Äôt care about me the way I thought he did. Maybe I meant nothing, and that‚Äôs why it was so easy to just discard me. Either way, I feel hurt and discarded. I thought our friendship meant something to him. I don‚Äôt understand how I could be dropped so easily as if I never mattered at all.

The whole thing has left me confused, rejected, and hurt. I still don‚Äôt understand why he waited so long to mention his relationship. I don‚Äôt understand why he didn‚Äôt trust me with that truth earlier, especially since he said he felt safe with me.

Looking for recommendations anyone has on areas or apartment buildings I should look at on the west side - I‚Äôm realizing it‚Äôs hard to find an apartment I‚Äôd want within my ideal budget in the 70s-80s. 

Budget: $4k-5k, ideal would be max 4.5k

Type: 1 Bedroom

Features: Primarily would love central air/new type of construction. Washer/dryer in the building preferred. Doorman building. Don‚Äôt care as much about amenities.

Big factor: I will be commuting by car to Weschester about 3 days a week. So being higher up into the 100s+ is probably better anyways. 

What I‚Äôm looking for in a location:
One day may move to the burbs, but really want to get some time in the city and feel like I‚Äôm living there - i.e. access to good food, local coffee shops, close to the subway, etc. I used to live by Sutton Place, I liked it and it was safe but didn‚Äôt have good access to those things. Safety is also very important to me, especially if I ever come home late. I‚Äôm very open to being higher up 100s+ but I don‚Äôt know what areas would be good for that and give me that feel so any recs appreciated!!

1maqui4,https://www.reddit.com/r/INTPrelationshipLab/comments/1maqui4/intpm_needs_advice_with_human_relations/,INTP[M] needs advice with human relations,"I had a pretty crazy timeline as an IT professional‚Äîtwo major deployments on my head. Technically one, but I've made it a habit to assist coworkers who are doing a deployment in my line of work for the first time since the process is complicated and many things can easily be missed or miscommunicated.

Long story short, throughout the timeline of working on my massive project, and supporting her with her development and deployment, we had pretty good moments. I think she feels safe with me which is not something I'm used to (emotionally/expressively), and is genuinely worried about my well-being. I also have been rewarded in some ways like food offerrings, which is not uncommon for indian coworkers. It helps cause its known I have a habit of disregarding lunch or delaying it to wrap up work. However, on the final week of the deployment cycle, I received food catered specifically to me.

It was a pleasant surprise; unfortunately, I could not immediately address it with 2 deployments on top of my head, work genuinely got in the way of the celebration. It was presented to me after I helped her survive some relatively stressful meetings. It seemed like she really wanted to celebrate and eat together with the food but it just couldn't happen, my deployment was up that night. So when I finally wrapped up work, and the massive night deployment, I enjoyed the food and then with some advice, filled the food container with some gift and returned the container to her the next day without mentioning what was inside.

Now her deployment is coming up tomorrow, and I'm busy doing any needed patchwork to make sure the deployment of last night is a success, but as per usual im also spreading myself thin to make sure she is good for tomorrow. Unfortunately, once again I became too busy to address her and could only promise I could address her concerns at the end of the day and she should proceed with the other steps I recommended to prepare for the deployment tomorrow.

I commit to the promise and after making sure the massive deployment was good for tonight's patch, I addressed her after work and worked with her for 2 - 3 hours to make sure she was good for tomorrow's deployment. Unfortunately I have a long commute so this means I had to also do my night deployment in the office and likely get back incredibly late. She seemed super bothered and even blamed herself for this. She proceeded to get her roommate involved, immediately bringing back food to the office maybe 15 mins later in time for my deployment call.

I was shocked, since to me I was just doing what I believed what was right, but the gesture was super appreciated and it made me realize how burned I was when I started eating during the deployment. She kept checking in on me multiple times during the deployment call to let her know when its done so I can get a ride to the station by her roommate which I told her was not necessary. As soon as my deployment was wrapped up she pinged again and I responded, and her roommate was already waiting for me to pick me up. They gave me water and some indian coffee which helped and once again made me realize just how burned I was.

Then when I got home I got a ping from her that she finally opened the food with gifts container I had returned to her and she liked it which is great. I appreciated the food she gave the prior day and I thought just saying thanks and eating it was not enough to show my appreciation. After all, If i'm not wrong, this means the person had spent time outside of work thinking about me when preparing the food.

Now its the night of the deployment and to keep this short, I basically became a hero of the deployment that night which surprised even me. It had many twist and turns but was able to breakthrough giving her a successful first time deployment. She was elated to call me after the deployment call ended, I elated too but my typical INTPness and the fact it was 3am in the morning made me probably end the call short to a good night after a few mins of celebration. It made me feel a little bad, because I know this coworker loves to celebrate while my INTPness is always thinking 4 steps ahead to properly enjoy the moment.

If you managed to get this far, basically I feel like a lot happened and I'm not sure how to interpret what will happen between us after. I'm pretty sure she is married per indian culture. But I feel I received many signs of care that is really personalized. I want to say we are at least friends or partners in crime but not sure how to proceed without maybe being dense on accident? I'd definitely like to hang out with her after work some days but it also seems clear that such things are probably seen to be too intimate between both genders in indian culture. Even the food she prepared seemed to be a relatively private offering.

I can only conclude this person seems to like me pretty well, and I like her too, but do not want to push any boundaries especially indian culture related boundaries I'm completely abstracted from. We're definitely above the labeling of coworkers if you ask me so that is where my confusion is.",2,1753634175.0,INTPrelationshipLab,4,1.0,False
1maqtpu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1maqtpu/explore_how_thang_long_vietnamese_coffee_filter/,Explore how Thang Long Vietnamese Coffee Filter review simplifies brewing authentic coffee!,"Testing Thang Long SYNCHKG077062, the Vietnamese Coffee Filter Set, has been an eye-opener for someone like me who thrives on coffee. This little device is the real deal if you‚Äôve ever dreamed of making that iconic, rich, and smooth Vietnamese coffee from the cozy corner of your kitchen. Compact and sleek, this stainless steel coffee filter is designed to create authentic coffee while making the process unintimidating for novices like me. But as much as I admire this coffee-making gem, there are details worth discussing before you put it in your cart.

**Ease of Design and Functionality**  
From the first look, you can tell the construction is rock solid. The stainless steel material not only makes it durable but also gives it a modern aesthetic that fits right into my kitchen setup. Its minimalistic design is both stylish and functional, ideal for someone who values simplicity without compromising on performance. The gravity insert feature is a notable addition‚Äîso much more convenient than the old-school screw-down filter. With just four pieces to assemble, it‚Äôs quick to use, even when you‚Äôre half awake in the morning.

**Performance in Brewing Vietnamese Coffee**  
Using this coffee filter is all about precision and patience. Unlike overpriced machines with countless buttons, this one operates manually and offers a simple but rewarding brewing experience. I‚Äôve tested it with traditional Vietnamese coffee grounds (Trung Nguyen, for the curious), and the results are consistently satisfying. The slow drip method brings the best flavors to the forefront, and the 8oz size is perfect for a single, strong shot of coffee. Whether served hot or iced with condensed milk, the outcome will give caf√©-level coffee lovers a run for their money.

[Check Thang Long SYNCHKG077062 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b01953yt1i/)

**Durability and Maintenance**  
The filter is surprisingly lightweight but doesn‚Äôt feel flimsy at all. Dishwasher-safe features are always a win in my books, especially when I‚Äôm juggling a busy kitchen. After repeated use, it still looks shiny and doesn't seem to retain any coffee stains, unlike some cheaper options I‚Äôve used before. The lifetime warranty backs up its durability claim, which provides peace of mind for those hesitant about splurging on a seemingly small item.

**Advantages**  
The Vietnamese coffee maker has won me over in several aspects. Here‚Äôs what stood out:  
- Stainless steel finish ensures the filter is long-lasting and rust-resistant.  
- Gravity insert mechanism simplifies the brewing process.  
- Compact size fits easily into kitchen drawers for storage.  
- Produces rich, aromatic coffee comparable to authentic Vietnamese caf√©s.  

**Areas of Concern**  
That being said, no product is without its quirks. There are a few hurdles I think might bother or frustrate some people:  
- The brewing speed may feel too slow for anyone in a hurry.  
- Mastering the precise coffee-to-water ratio requires trial and error.  
- 8oz capacity can be a limitation for those who want larger servings.  

**Competing Brands**  
The coffee world is full of competitors, and I‚Äôve tried popular alternatives like the Hario V60 or the Aeropress. While both offer versatility in brewing styles, neither replicates the authentic Vietnamese coffee experience as faithfully as this filter. However, brands like Phin Brewing also cater specifically to Vietnamese coffee enthusiasts and are worth considering for larger filter sizes. The Thang Long model stands apart for its gravity insert, which is simpler than screw-down options found in competing products.

**Bang for the Buck**  
For its reliability and simplicity, this coffee filter delivers impressively for the price. Compared to more expensive brewing methods requiring filters or specialized pods, this eco-friendly alternative saves both money and waste. Sure, it‚Äôs a modest investment, but given the results, you‚Äôll end up using it daily‚Äîit‚Äôs more than worth the cost. Toss in the fact that it's dishwasher-safe and comes with a lifetime warranty, and it‚Äôs clear this isn‚Äôt just another fad gadget.

1maqtoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthMomentum/comments/1maqtoh/does_physicians_choice_womens_probiotic_review/,Does Physician's CHOICE Women's Probiotic Review Uncover the Best for Digestive and Feminine Health?,"The **Physician's CHOICE Probiotics for Women (B07B8BSGPL)** truly caught my eye as someone who values health-focused products. This probiotic supplement promises to offer digestive support, feminine health benefits, and even urinary tract health. After weeks of testing it, both pleasantly surprising features and a few elements worth noting stood out. Here‚Äôs my take on this product.

**Tailored for Women‚Äôs Needs**  
I‚Äôve tried many probiotics before, but this one felt like it was specially designed for women‚Äîand it is! With six unique strains and a staggering 50 billion CFU, this probiotic goes the extra mile for feminine health. Ingredients like pro-cranberry extract and D-Mannose had me intrigued, as they specifically support urinary tract health. Unlike other probiotics I‚Äôve used that leave you wondering if they‚Äôre doing anything, this one brought noticeable improvements in some of those ‚Äúsensitive areas.‚Äù  

**Convenience in Its Design**  
One thing that stood out was its easy-to-use, once-daily capsules. Packaging labeled as ‚Äúshelf-stable‚Äù made things even better‚Äîno refrigeration fuss here. The acid-resistant capsules also make a strong case for effectiveness, ensuring the strains survive and reach your gut, which I appreciated after reading about similar challenges other probiotics face. Another bonus: it‚Äôs gluten-free, which suited my dietary restrictions perfectly.  

[Find the best price for Physician's CHOICE B07B8BSGPL on Amazon.](https://healthquay.com/p/b07b8bsgpl/)

**Targeted Benefits for Digestive and Gut Health**  
The benefits go beyond feminine health. Tackling occasional issues like bloating, constipation, and even diarrhea became a breeze, thanks to this product‚Äôs well-thought-out strains and organic prebiotics. After my morning routine of coffee fueled chaos at work, I found my usual episodes of indigestion were greatly diminished‚Äîa point my coworkers, who‚Äôve heard me groan about my gut, would agree on!  

**Positives**  
It felt like this product checked so many boxes and excelled in key areas worth celebrating:  
- Pro-cranberry and D-Mannose effectively target urinary health.  
- Acid-resistant capsules ensure strain survival through digestion.  
- Designed specifically for women, combining digestive and feminine health benefits.  

**Adverse Aspects**  
That said, nothing in life comes perfect, and this probiotic wasn‚Äôt an exception:  
- The packaging, although ‚Äúshelf-stable,‚Äù could use a clearer indication about temperature tolerances.  
- While effective, the capsules aren‚Äôt small; swallowing them might be tricky for some people.  

**Competing Products**  
In terms of competition, there are big names like Culturelle, Garden of Life, and Renew Life offering high-CFU probiotics for women. All these brands bring unique selling points, but the Physician‚Äôs CHOICE product certainly stands out with its inclusion of cranberries and D-Mannose‚Äîan addition I didn‚Äôt commonly see elsewhere. On the flip side, some competitors offer smaller capsule sizes or additional strains, so it‚Äôs worth weighing your specific needs.  

**Worth Every Penny?**  
Talking about the financial aspect, this product does land slightly on the pricier side compared to generic probiotics. However, considering its targeted benefits and well-curated ingredient list, the investment in quality could justify its cost for many. It‚Äôs not one of those typical budget options, but you truly get a premium experience.

You believe self-care is resistance. You've been told it's revolutionary.. Taking bubble baths while capitalism burns, practicing yoga while democracy collapses, buying essential oils while the planet chokes. But what if your self-care routine is just one of the system's many sophisticated control mechanisms.. One that makes you complicit in your own exploitation while calling it healing?

Self-care isn't self-care. It's self-management. The $18 billion wellness industry didn't emerge to help you.. It emerged to help you help the system extract more from you, more efficiently, for longer periods, with less resistance.

Hey PNW hikers! 

This is a bit of a long shot, but I'm hoping to reconnect with someone I met yesterday at Lake Mason on the Ira Spring Trail. We had a nice chat by the lake - you mentioned you're an architect, had Italian ancestry and were there with a friend who works in the energy sector, if I remember correctly. 

Really enjoyed our conversation, especially about pets and pet names and would love to grab coffee or drinks sometime if you're interested, or just connect as fellow hikers if you're not looking for anything more than that. No pressure either way!

If this is you (or if anyone knows who this might be), feel free to DM me. I can share more details about our conversation to verify.

It looked to be the only cafe (and not a chain) in a half-mile long street where, judging from the demographics, it was a no-brainer that a Starbucks or Peet‚Äôs would be taking people‚Äôs money.  So the place had monopoly of the coffee shop scene, at least in that stretch.  I noticed overhead menu did not have prices.  Neither did the pastry display.  Cyclists taking their reward for the day, senior folks and gentry flocked the small place.
My wife later said the prices were posted in a flyer somewhere near the cashier.

I have some idea, but wanted to hear from others why prices would not be displayed conspicuously in such a popular spot.

(Btw the coffee was self-serve and more than 5 bucks for a medium.  The payment system prompted, but I left no tip.  The taste of the coffee justified my decision.)

Hey Seattle hikers! 

This is a bit of a long shot, but I'm hoping to reconnect with someone I met yesterday at Lake Mason on the Ira Spring Trail. We had a nice chat by the lake - you mentioned you're an architect, had Italian ancestry and were there with a friend who works in the energy sector, if I remember correctly. 

Really enjoyed our conversation, especially about pets and pet names and would love to grab coffee or drinks sometime if you're interested, or just connect as fellow hikers if you're not looking for anything more than that. No pressure either way!

If this is you (or if anyone knows who this might be), feel free to DM me. I can share more details about our conversation to verify.

My wife and I met about 10 years ago when I was in undergrad, then grad school, then medical school, and now residency. Medicine is unique... and honestly, it's not possible to know what medicine is like, until you dive headfirst into the shallow end. The hours are long, the work is mentally and physically draining, and the pay is... we don't get paid as student/make minimum wage as residents. I know this process has/is/will continue to keep me time depleted an often just defeated. My wife is an absolutely wonderful human and it pains me knowing that this stress and pressure also affects her. I'm a resident right meow and it's wild to think about all the uncertainty we face in all of this. Many successes and too many failures. To all of our spouses and loved ones - you all are wonderful and I can‚Äôt begin to tell you how much we appreciate your support, even if it doesn‚Äôt feel like it sometimes.

""My Girlfriend Says the Pills Are What‚Äôs Making Me Sick""

I've always struggled with allowing myself to fully open to others. Family, friends, strangers, even cashiers making mundane chitter chatter with me, that especially fills me with dread and tense awkwardness. However when I'm finally back home, the ache of the public subsides a bit. My home isn't very luxurious compared to other's expectations of being a homeowner, but I make it work. Walls and ceilings tanned from many smoke tendrils staining the paint like a cancerous kiss. Litter and debris so encompassing the carpets that only small footsteps can be made at a time to minimize the risk of tripping over myself. Sometimes all this makes things a bit more lonesome for me. Wishing I had someone to help with all the heavy lifting of being responsible for myself. I live a few streets down from an old psychiatric hospital. It's convenient whenever I have an emergency that I can't help on my own. I usually consult my girlfriend before I ever make a decision on my turbulent health. The only problem is I only ever get to see her when I'm riddled with any god damned awful symptom you could imagine of mental torture: paranoia, panic, feeling out of body, etc. you can get the idea. On that note, you can tell her baseline of my ""functioning"" isn't exactly normal, but it's all we've got.

After a restless night of sleep, a silhouette keeps excitedly waving to me in the bedroom doorway as my eyes flicker in and out of consciousness. I open my eyes for the last time, sun rays piercing through my curtains. Creasing my tired eyes with my hands I turn on the cobweb covered lamp on my bedside table. There she was. ""Hey baby"" she said cheerfully. ""I snuck in early just to check on you again!"" My girlfriend is always so thoughtful even if sometimes it warrants a restraining order on an ordinary stranger. ""Not like you do this every morning or anything"" I sarcastically chuckled. ""Well don't you like when I make sure you're taken care of? You don't have many other options."" She said in a loving tone that soon turned cold. ""You don't need to dig up that wound, but I appreciate the sentiment babe"". I said with a bit of shame. She was right. I don't get out much and I don't have anyone but her, that is, until she's gone and I'm left once again, alone. That crippling feeling like I'm the last man on earth. Even worse, the last man in a sea of blurry faces that have no desire to step out of the shadows and acknowledge me. Alone in a crowded ""too busy to care"" world

Once I was fully up and moving around, a shadowy figure emerged coming around the corner. The closer it came, the more unwell I felt than I already did from the jet lag of not having my morning routine. Coffee, a cigarette, and most importantly, my medication. The shadow pulsed like static as it closes the distance. With each step the hazy static became more humanoid as it leaned straight up to my face. ""You aren't going to take those useless meds are you?"" she said in a grimacing tone. ""I was about to..... why are you always complaining about me trying to better myself and take the edge off everything that plagues me daily?"". ""Because, I'm your girlfriend. I love you, I don't ever want to lose you, but you insist on pushing me away every single day."" she said with love that had a unsettling undertone. ""I need to take these pills babe, I'm not trying to fuck things up, I promise"" I said with reassurance. Her eyelids grew sharper, a stare like a knife that was sunken into my returned gaze. ""Well if you aren't trying to destroy what we have. Do. Not. Take. Them. If you do, next time I see you. I won't be so happy to see you."" 

I indecisively paced my thoughts around if I should swallow them, or put them back in the bottle. Do I stay with her, or let her go?. Do I function as close to ""normal"" as normal gets? or do I live my life with visions of crooked teeth in every smile, nightly hours of heart pounding panic of what lingers in the unknown, a heart always on the verge of exploding like embers of a fire cracking out of my chest that eventually leads to the same path? Either take the pills, or descend further into a personal hell all for the sake of whatever the fuck this is called. Love? I'm not so sure anymore.

After a few hours of letting the pills fester back on their lonely throne of a medicine cabinet. I made a decision. I will ride this out for the love I've always wanted, and selfishly, to keep at least one person by my side. No matter how visceral the ache becomes.

Three more hours creep by. 9pm. The walls are oozing down sludge like large droplets of blackened blood. I HAD to turn on the TV to look at something else. 11pm hits. I was engrossed by the different commercials all seeming to peer through the TV right into my soul. ""Take the pills you freak"" one of the men advertising a new line of boxer briefs said. I was locked in deep. My head floating around like a heavy drug had been flowing through my trembling anxious veins. Then jagged legs stepped in front of the TV. Bending over to put her hands on her thighs and a head cocked up to look at me. ""We haven't had so much time together like this in forever. Aren't we having so much fun?"" with the same bone chilling aura she called ""love"". It had been almost a full day without anything to take the edge off. ""I'm not sure this is what I would call fun"" I said drowsily. ""My fun is getting to stay here. With you. I don't ever want to leave, and frankly, I won't let myself leave."" she said slowly with menace. 

In that moment, I was too mentally fucked, and my perception of my girlfriend was becoming too twisted to feel any semblance of a heart radiating from her. So I acted on my impulses. Dashed out of my seat, pushing through her racing toward the farthest door down the hall. Her loving voice became wails of distorted siren calls. Polyphonic howls like a choir of fallen angels all from the mouth of the one who I once loved. In my clumsy haste, I accidentally broke down the bathroom door with my crashing body weight. I didn't give a fuck about how much that would cost to repair. I open the cabinet mirror above the sink. Shaking hands fumbling the pill bottle open, tipping all the contents inside into my hand, some white little dots overflowing onto the ground. I tossed them in my mouth and ran my mouth under the sink water. I was ready to go. Finally, some peace. A hauntingly gentle hand was placed on my shoulder. My face became pale. Painstakingly slow I turned to see my girlfriend. Her face twitching well crying. Looking with the most malevolent, sad puppy eyes she could muster. ""Please, don't do it"". she whined. I whimpered with the water in my mouth. Her fingers turning into long razor sharp claws lifting up to swipe me. I swallowed the pills. Before she faded as the medication hit my stomach, a faint, fleeting, whisper crept out of her ghostly mouth. ""I'll see you again tomorrow my love"".",18,1753633431.0,creepcast,0,0.95,False
