A Suggestion Box Entry from Bob Carter

Dear Anonymous,

I'm not quite sure I understand the concept of this 'Anonymous' Suggestion Box. If no one reads what we write, then how will anything ever change?

But in the spirit of good will, I've decided to offer my two cents, and hopefully Kevin won't steal it! (ha, ha). I would really like to see more varieties of coffee in the coffee machine in the break room. 'Milk and sugar', 'black with sugar', 'extra sugar' and 'cream and sugar' don't offer much diversity. Also, the selection of drinks seems heavily weighted in favor of 'sugar'. What if we don't want any sugar? But all this is beside the point because I quite like sugar, to be honest. In fact, that's my second suggestion: more sugar in the office. Cakes, candy, insulin, aspartame... I'm not picky. I'll take it by mouth or inject it intravenously, if I have to. Also, if someone could please fix the lock on the men's room stall, that would be helpful. Yesterday I was doing my business when Icarus nearly climbed into my lap.

So, have a great day!

Anonymously,

Bob Carter

- i want her to be understanding that i do have a provider mindset and i want to take care of her  but i do want to first recover totally! 
- I want you to support me and give me hope about the future!

1iqssis,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iqssis,How to use the info on a coffee bag to brew,"Please skip to the last two paragraphs if you can't be bothered to read my elongated introduction.

Hello guys, I've been in and around this lovely
community for a few months now. As many of you may have also experienced, as one's coffee hobby grows deeper, creating a cup of coffee you feel satisfied with becomes rarer. Ignorance is well and truly bliss in the world of coffee. Worrying about grind size, temperature, bloom time, swirl or wiggle?!?! is quite frankly enough to drive a man insane.

I'm now too deep in this world to turn back so I thought it was about time I asked you guys for some friendly advice because.. well, i want to be 
able to enjoy my cups of coffee again!

It is no secret that different coffee's brew differently. I know that how you brew, grind, heat the water, may be understood by reading the information on the bags of coffee. The trouble is I still have no idea how to digest the information on a bag of coffee. For example, i recently brewed an Anerobically washed Ethiopian coffee the other day and had absolutely no idea what
an Ethiopian coffee requires to achieve an excellent cup. I spent too long worrying about if i should be using boiling water. But I heard April Coffee tends to brew Ethiopians at 92? Well how about ratios? I should change my water ratio to 1:17 to achieve a higher extraction, right? Or should i just grind finer and get a sweeter up?
Wait! Does the fact its Anerobically washed change anything?!?! You get the jist. I know there's articles out there but quite frankly, finding something specific to your bag is tricky to find. I also understand that is all down to preference at the end of the day, however, im just looking for some pointers that can push me in the right direction when I buy a new bag of coffee.

This brings me to the question I came here to ask all you experts today:

What can i understand about how i should be brewing a cup of coffee based on the information on the bag? Also, how specifically will the effect my cup? I know this probably requirea a long winded answer so i appreciate anything you can add. I understand i may have to do some digging myself. 

I will attach some photos of some coffee ill be brewing in a few days. l'l be extremely grateful if someone can explain how i should be brewing them (not techniques per say but more to do
with grind size, water ratio, temperature etc.)

I’d just like to tell you what’s up and see if anyone can recognize what’s going on. I believe in 2019 I was having a bunch of issues I was also 21 years old. So I was drinking a lot and barley eating and not eating the right stuff and probably not being hydrated- anyways I was drinking one night and I went to go eat some ramen, Please Stomach Forgive Me, and all the sudden it felt like a band snapped in my stomach, I truly thought I was dying but did nothing about it, for probably a month I was in extreme pain (stomach) my friends knew, a lot of people knew, I was a delivery driver so I legit had my friends hop in my car and help me deliver pizza for like 2 weeks straight until I could operate and move easier. (Please understand I grew up in a bad environment and no one around me was ever actually self aware about anything so I got no help.)  after that- digestive issues no oils, seeds,coffee, dairy, gluten, red meat, the WORKS 

Anyways, 6 years later, I still have not actually figured out what’s wrong but became more aware about it, been to a primary talked about it, they obviously want to do a colonoscopy and a EDG 
My digestion had significantly improved, as I can eat seeds, have oils(acid reflux so not much), (small amounts of dairy) red meat are all back on the okay side of things 
On the other hand …Gluten, Processed foods I’m noticing just always hurt, I’m assuming because these things are not good for us. I get food stuck in the track right underneath my ribs if I eat something my stomach doesn’t like and a crap tone of gas. 

Well if all I did was annoy you because I didn’t hop on the chance to figure out what was wrong, life’s hard okay? Honestly giving the circumstances my parents should’ve never had a kid, because quite frankly, they both fucked up another persons life because they couldn’t get their shit together.

Sunday 16th 6:50am.

Hi guys! I just wanted to say first and foremost thank you to everyone far and wide who's offered support and friendship. You've really helped me get through this mess. Here's the update :)

After breakfast Friday morning, we left straight for his place, it was about 7:45am we arrived. He was still home at this point and it was expected. We waited a while longer and eventually maybe about 45 minutes later we see him open the door, step out with his coffee then looks down the street both ways and then just stands there looking at his phone. We thought he was leaving. Wrong!! Omg, guess who was there?. Her, yes her! If I didn’t have anyone to get me through the last few days I would have been fuming red, but naw. It's almost like I expected it. She had walked up from behind him and hugged him but he took her arms off him, looked around and he quickly lead her back inside. I looked at both my dad and brother. My brother just hollers as my dad shakes his head. Guys, I hope you're not going to be upset that we didn't exactly ghost him.  Well i have technically. After they walked in i felt a ping in my chest and and it wasn't just anger anymore, it was finality. It felt as if the last thread of whatever we had snapped inside. I looked away or must have looked sick. I wasnt sure if i wanted to run in there or just tell my brother to drive and leave all my things. I didn't even realize my dad opened the door from the backseat until he shut it behind him. He didn't say a word to us. He just started slowly walking towards the door, he's a police Sergeant so I knew he'd be fine. Omg i remember this moment as if it's happens again each time I think about it. My dad knocked twice. Nothing both times, finally, the door cracked open just enough for me to see his face from afar. His entire expression changed the second he realized who was was at the door. His smug, relaxed look vanished and his face from where we could see too lit up cherry red. Were laughing at this point.

He didn't close the door, just shifted his body in the frame like some pathetic human shield, as if he tried to hide what we just witnessed.

I knew he was scrambling to figure out his next move. At this point I'm not sure what my dad told him but my dad must have told him to move because he stepped aside to let my dad in. I got worried for a second. Because I couldn't see him anymore but not even seconds later SHE comes out. Embarrassed as hell and she walks to apparently her car parked a little down the street. Ugh. Disgusting. We waited to see what happens as the door is still open. As she drives away, my brother gets a text from Dad, he says only my brother come help, we all agreed to just grab my clothes, my art, my records, my pictures, my keep sake jewelry all of which I told them where everything was and as time went by I just kept texting with my brother. Omg guys my brother had texted me saying ""he looks like he's gonna shit his pants"". It kept my spirits up after what i had jst witnessed, yet again. I didn't mind AT ALL not going in. I'm happy it happened this way, it may not have happened the way everyone hoped. But i sure as hell know he was embarrassed as fuck and left wondering. He can keep that hat. My dad is a God send. I told my family about the post and my Dad offered to write his perspective since he was face to face with my ex

He's just the best, my family is just the best I can't even begin to express how much you've guys helped me. Gave advice and just shared some of your experiences as well. God cheaters fucking suck. He can rot inside as he wonders and I'm free now. We left without looking back literally, and I think this is the final Update. Thanks so much guys. 

From my Dad: 

""I approached my daughter's ex’s residence and immediately heard a woman laughing inside. I knocked once. The laughter stopped. I knocked again, and I could hear muffled voices and movement inside. When he opened the door, his expression immediately changed; he recognized me and looked caught off guard.

I told him, 'X, don’t try to hide anything. It didn’t have to be like this. All we want is O’s belongings.' He hesitated but let me inside. As I stepped in, I continued, 'You owe her at least that much—the decency to collect her things after what you’ve done.'

I saw a young woman inside and told her she should leave. She gathered her things and exited without protest. Meanwhile, X kept asking how much my daughter knew, attempting to justify his actions. I ignored his attempts at explanation and texted my son to come help move O’s belongings.

X continued pressing, insisting he had made a mistake and wanting to know exactly what O was aware of. He was visibly anxious. X ran a hand through his hair, eyes darting between me and the door. ""I never meant to hurt her,"" he muttered. ""It just happened.""

I shook my head at him and stated. ""No, X. You made a choice.""

He swallowed hard. ""What does she know?""

I held his gaze. ""Enough.""

A knock at the door; my son had arrived. Without another word, we started gathering O’s things. X stood there, silent, as we moved past him.

As I reached the door to leave, I spotted O’s hat where she left it. I grabbed it, turned to X, and lightly tossed it to the floor. ""You keep this,"" I said, then shut the door behind me.

At some point I left the engagement ring on the island counter. I told my daughter that, if you pawn that ring, some poor couple will be with that ring, it's more of a punishment to him, he lost the real diamond.

I'm wondering if anyone has an inside scoop on the recipe for Pizza Luce's Molly Bars. They are SO GOOD, very fudgey. 

They are described as a vegan and gluten free brownie, but their texture and the presence of some bits of rice krispie makes me think they are probably no bake. There are some recipes for ""molly bars"" online but they are very different, essentially a rice krispie and peanut butter bar with chocolate drizzled on top. Def some minor similarities (no bake bar with rice krispies), but there is no peanut butter in the PL molly bar, they are overwhelming chocolate flavored, not just a drizzle, and the ratio of rice krispies seems very different. The label says contains soy and I'm pretty sure I can taste instant coffee/espresso powder in there.

I’m not necessarily new to Leeds but went to uni here about 10 years ago…moved to Scotland and decided that Yorkshire is the best and returned to my favourite city in the UK. 

I’m a recently qualified (1 year ago) sports massage therapist and trying to build my client base in Leeds (Headingley and Cross Gates). 

I’m doing all I know to do which is flyering, posting on socials, emailing gyms etc but I really miss that element of word of mouth of living somewhere your whole life. 

Basically my question is: can anyone send me some advice which might come in the form of a business connection, networking events, friendly motivation, coffee chat, suggesting friends to me…just anything you can think of. 

I’m trying to target the sports industry but obviously anyone is welcome. Just emailed Andy’s man club to see if I can help there. I’m a graphic designer full time and this is my side hustle currently. I do it because I love helping people and like anatomy. But moving from the creative industries to sports is quite a side step and I literally have zero connections. 😳

A little background history, I took mirtazapine for insomnia back in 2023 I only took it for 4 days and then I quit it made me feel really groggy and tired.
Then in 2024 I took 25mg of zoloft for 2 months, approximately 60 days. After 2 months of use I quit cold turkey. Then that’s when I began to experience symptoms such as: blank mind, severe anhedonia, no endorphins after exercise, no adrenaline, no dopamine, reduced sensation on penis and low libido. 

It’s been 9 months since I quit Zoloft and I’m still struggling with the symptoms. I think my problem may be related to low dopamine because drinking coffee makes me feel a little better. Should I try Wellbutrin? I have heard people getting better from taking it or should I wait at least a year before I try any meds?

Hello guys, I've been in and around this lovely
community for a few months now. As many of you may have also experienced, as one's coffee hobby grows deeper, creating a cup of coffee you feel satisfied with becomes rarer. Ignorance is well and truly bliss in the world of coffee. Worrying about grind size, temperature, bloom time, swirl or wiggle?!?! is quite frankly enough to drive a man insane.

I'm now too deep in this world to turn back so I thought it was about time I asked you guys for some friendly advice because.. well, i want to be 
able to enjoy my cups of coffee again!

It is no secret that different coffee's brew differently. I know that how you brew, grind, heat the water, may be understood by reading the information on the bags of coffee. The trouble is I still have no idea how to digest the information on a bag of coffee. For example, i recently brewed an Anerobically washed Ethiopian coffee the other day and had absolutely no idea what
an Ethiopian coffee requires to achieve an excellent cup. I spent too long worrying about if i should be using boiling water. But I heard April Coffee tends to brew Ethiopians at 92? Well how about ratios? I should change my water ratio to 1:17 to achieve a higher extraction, right? Or should i just grind finer and get a sweeter up?
Wait! Does the fact its Anerobically washed change anything?!?! You get the jist. I know there's articles out there but quite frankly, finding something specific to your bag is tricky to find. I also understand that is all down to preference at the end of the day, however, im just looking for some pointers that can push me in the right direction when I buy a new bag of coffee.

This brings me to the question I came here to ask all you experts today:

What can i understand about how i should be brewing a cup of coffee based on the information on the bag? Also, how specifically will the effect my cup? I know this probably requirea a long winded answer so i appreciate anything you can add. I understand i may have to do some digging myself. 

I will attach some photos of some coffee ill be brewing in a few days. l'l be extremely grateful if someone can explain how i should be brewing them (not techniques per say but more to do
with grind size, water ratio, temperature etc.)

1iqskbz,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthAsianMasculinity/comments/1iqskbz/stop_being_weak_victims/,Stop Being Weak Victims,"I’m genuinely scared for the next generation of South Asians because too many of you come across as whiny losers.

Yes, South Asian hate exists, even amongst ourselves, but instead of complaining, there are things we can do to combat it.



1️⃣ Physicality – Get Stronger & More Athletic

Hit the gym at least 3 times a week, focusing on full-body workouts (our bodies respond best to this).



Nutrition tip:
	•	Cut your carbs in half every meal.
	•	Increase your protein intake.
	•	If you’re Muslim, incorporate higher-fat meats (we respond better to them) – e.g. lamb, chicken thighs/legs, salmon.



If you’re weak, small, or out of shape – fix it. Your physical presence should command respect.




2️⃣ Looks – Present Yourself Better

Looking good isn’t just genetics, it’s maintenance.

✅ Eyebrows: Trim them, pluck the monobrow (break the stereotype).

✅ Facial Hair:
	•	Clean shave if your beard is weak.
	•	Grow a beard that suits your face shape.

✅ Haircuts: Get a proper fade/haircut twice a month – make sure it actually looks fresh.

✅ Line yourself up at home in between (cheap trimmers + YouTube tutorials).

When you look sharp, you feel sharp.






3️⃣ Hygiene – Fix This ASAP

Some of you need to hear this. We already have a stereotype of smelling bad. Don’t reinforce it.

🚿 Shower daily (minimum)

	•	Use proper shower gel (not a 3-in-1 garbage bottle).

	•	Shampoo 1-3x a week, condition every other day (prevents breakage).

	•	Use a loofah – washing with your hands does NOTHING.




🛁 Post-Shower Routine
	•	Use separate oils for hair & beard (if applicable).

	•	Moisturize (face, ears, nose, and body).

	•	Double up on deodorant (Roll-on + Spray).


If you stink at Jummah or have smelly feet, fix it. People notice.






4️⃣ Intellect – Level Up Your Mind

✅ Education matters. Study, study, study.


✅ Social skills matter. Interact with people, especially women, so you don’t act weird around them.
(Asking your mum to make roti doesn’t count.)

✅ Work on your accent.
I was lucky to grow up in a white area, so I don’t have that South Asian twang, but some of you sound fresh off the boat despite being born in the UK, USA, or Canada.

	•	Work on pronunciation – accents affect perception.

	•	Let’s be real: our accents aren’t the most attractive.

✅ Be street smart.

	•	Observe South Asian roadmen – take the good aspects (confidence, presence), not the criminality.

	•	You should never be an easy target for Goreh or Kaleh.


✅ Know your history & be ready for racists.

	•	If someone tries it, physically and verbally check them.

	•	Learn to debate and articulate your points (watch Muslim debaters like M. Hijab).

	•	Remember: India made Britain rich while they were throwing urine into the streets.

	•	Muslim Moors introduced perfume and bathing to Europe. (Google it if you don’t believe me.)






5️⃣ Be Proud of Your History

We’re one of the most successful immigrant groups despite facing racism.
✅ Top CEOs.
✅ Highest-earning households.
✅ Warrior traditions – we’re NOT weak.


Look at:
🥇 The Great Gama (wrestling legend)

🥊 Amir Khan, Adam Azim, Hamzah Sheeraz, Nishant Dev

💪 Pehlwani (stone lifting, kabaddi, wrestling)

Embrace your heritage – there’s nothing weak about it.




6️⃣ Clothing – Dress Like a Man, Not a Teenager

✅ Start fresh with these staples:

👕 T-Shirts (High Quality)
	•	2x Black
	•	2x White
	•	2x Coloured

👖 Jeans/Trousers:
	•	2x Black Jeans
	•	2x Light Blue/Grey Jeans
	•	2x Blue Jeans
	•	2x Cargos

🧥 Jackets/Hoodies:
	•	2x Black Hoodie
	•	2x Black Bomber Jacket
	•	2x Leather Jacket
	•	2x Smart Casual Jacket
	•	2x Winter Puffer

👟 Trainers:
	•	1x Black Trainers
	•	1x White Trainers

📌 Keep it clean, mix & match.
📌 Doesn’t need to be designer, just high quality (Zara, H&M, etc.).




7️⃣ Dating – Stop Moving Like a Victim

🚫 Stop taking dad selfies.

✅ Fix your Instagram (Watch Jack Hopkins’ ‘A G’s Guide to Instagram’).

✅ Use the right dating apps: Hinge, Tinder, Dil Mil, Muzz.

✅ Stop being awkward.

✅ First date = Coffee/Chai, NOT an expensive meal.
(Are you her dad?)






8️⃣ Finances – Secure the Bag

💰 Earning power = Respect.

✅ Make good money.
✅ Invest in stock dividends.
✅ Start a business.
✅ Have 6-12 months’ worth of living expenses saved.
✅ Have an emergency fund your wife doesn’t know about (DTA – Don’t Trust Anybody.).

Being broke is a choice in 2025 – level up.









Final Thoughts – No More Weakness

I shouldn’t have to make this post, but too many of you need guidance.

✅ Stop whining like little kuriya.

✅ Change starts with YOU.

A lot of our women look elsewhere because they don’t see us as leaders and protectors anymore.

Our ancestors provided for entire families, protected their own, and moved with strength.
We need to go back to that.

We weren't in the same friend group but got along pretty well. We talked about 5 minutes and he says we should grab coffee. A couple of months went by and we never connected for coffee. I reach out and say we should at least catch up on old times, even if we don't have time for coffee. Oh, he also just happens to work at a company I really really want to work for. And is in upper management in the department I would be in. During the call, he mentions he saw my Linkedin and would love for me to meet with the hiring manager. 

So he does an intro, and the hiring manager and I have an informal ad hoc interview. I think the ""interview"" went well, or at least it wasn't bad. In fact, in response to my thank you email, the hiring manager responded by saying she would welcome the opportunity to speak with me down the road when there is more headcount and to ""please stay in touch"". She even requested to connect on Linkedin afterwards. 

Fastforward 8 months, I respond to her last email to see how the department is coming along and if she anticipates any headcount being added this year. No response. I follow up a week later. Still no response. So I reach back out to my buddy who is again, a notch or two above her in the organization. He says good to hear from me and he may in fact be adding headcount and will know more within the coming weeks. He told me to feel free to follow up in a couple of weeks for an update. Well, we are at the two week mark.

Any advice on how to navigate this? It seems my buddy is in my corner based off of his actions. However, he isn't the hiring manager and that person went from ""please keep in touch"" to not responding. 

TL;DR  
I have a buddy at my dream company. He put me in touch with the hiring manager who is a peg or two ""under"" him in the org. Did not get the job but thought the ad hoc interview went well. Hiring manager told me to follow up down the road and stay in touch. When I followed up twice, I got no response. Talked to buddy recently and he said he may be adding additional headcount.

By comparison, Devon's characterization is the only element of season 2 that I'm lukewarm on, in a season that's otherwise been pretty phenominal. Her presence in the season has been fairly sparse, but when she is in the show there are two things that bother me about her behavior.

One, she just discovered that the shady company that Devon works for has apparently, somehow, faked her close friend Gemma's death and is keeping her trapped underground. That would cause anyone to freak out and be filled with a sense of urgency to save her! But whenever we see Devon this season she's... generally calm and unbothered? Like she doesn't mention Gemma to her husband Ricken ever, that we see. She's helping Mark with his little experiment to burn an image into his vision, but even that doesn't feel like such a priority to her. If you found out your very close friend who you thought had been killed had actually been kidnapped and imprisoned underground by a shady company, I don't know, I think you'd be spending every day and evening researching the company online, talking to your husband about whether you should go to the police or government, etc. But all we see is her puttering around the house drinking coffee.

Two, she's a lot more passive than she was in season one. She kind of lets Mark walk all over her, like in the early episode scene in her house where she's trying to get Mark to talk about what he said re: Gemma, and he pretty rudely dismisses and mocks her, and she just folds and they move on. I find every scene between her and Ricken odd as well, as she behaves like a fairly passive observer to Ricken becoming involved with Lumen, \*something that both her and Ricken should have zero interest in, and in fact should be revolted by, because they just found out that Lumen has faked the death of and kidnapped their close friend.\* Instead, the scenes with Ricken and Devon about the book he's writing for Lumen involve her saying a passively aggressive dissaproving comment, and then leaving the room. Where is the conversation where Devon gets pissed at Ricken as says ""I supported you completely when you wrote the first version of this book, but it's not acceptable for you to start writting Lumen propaganda when we know that they're human traffficking Gemma and who knows how many other people!""

I love this show and I miss my fiery Devon!

Edit: Something I forgot and another reason that both both Ricken and Devon should be more revolted at the idea of Ricken now basically doing work for Lumen, is that last season a Lumen employee spent weeks? Months? Posing as a nursing-aid to their baby! Which is a massive personal violation. Again, Devon doesn't bring it up after episode 1.",0,1739713369.0,SeveranceAppleTVPlus,2,0.5,False

I’ve had two episodes lately and am a bit concerned. The first of which was on Thursday, and was a couple of hours after having a sugary coffee drink. I feel kind of weak and shaky so I checked my glucose and it was 62. Had some crackers and juice and it normalized. Friday went by with normal eating and without any dips in glucose. 

Yesterday, I worked out in the morning, and then had a protein shake and hydrated. For lunch I had a bowl of pasta (appx 80 carbs) and some chicken and monitored my glucose throughout the afternoon. It peaked at 137 about 2 hours after eating but then dipped to 54 an hour later, though I didn’t feel any symptoms. Within 15 minutes of dipping to 54 it had increased to 77 and stabilized at around 88 within about 25 minutes. I did not consume any carbs after it dipped; it rebounded on its own. 

I’m on 1.7 mg Wegovy for weight loss; my doctor Dxed me with pre diabetes about 2 years ago. Ag that time I had some glucose readings that were in the high prediabetic/borderline diabetic range. I addressed with diet and exercise and have maintained an A1C in the 5.5 range for about 2 years with no diabetic medication. My A1C has been 4.7 since taking Wegovy. 

I have a message out to my doctor expressing my concerns, but it’s Sunday morning so I don’t suspect I’ll hearing back until sometime next week. 

This is all new and overwhelming to me and I don’t have a lot of experience dealing with diabetes so I’m not real well versed on a lot of these things, but it seems like I may be experiencing reactive or postprandial hypoglycemia?

This confused me even more because from what I’ve read, Wegovy and GLP-1’s as supposed to stabilize glucose and prevent reactive hypoglycemia. 

I’ve monitored my glucose fairly regularly over the past two years and have never experienced any episodes of hypoglycemia such as this so I’m guessing that the Wegovy has to somehow be causing this. 

Has anyone else experienced this while on Wegovy? Should I talk to my doctor about stopping the medication?

I read these terrible stories about severe hypoglycemia and people having seizures and falling into comas and stuff, though that seems like it’s mainly type 1 diabetics and severe type 2 diabetics who take insulin, so that’s probably just my imagination running.

Anyway, I’m just a bit freaked out and any insight is much appreciated. ",1,1739713301.0,WegovyWeightLoss,0,1.0,False

Maglalakad lang kami papunta sa coffee shop kahit gabi na at kahit may sakayan naman. Later did I know stressed pala sya sa wedding preparation nya this April. Two nights ago, nagkape kami ulit kasi nga valentine's. While my hot coffee is getting cold napamura ako sa isip ko,

I hope you are doing well.

I just wanted to take a moment to say thank you to everyone in this community. When I first built [RedCoffee](https://pypi.org/project/redcoffee/), it was just a hobby project—something that solved a personal need. I never imagined it would cross 6,000 downloads or that so many of you would find it useful. Seeing the response, the feedback, and the feature requests has been incredibly motivating, and I truly appreciate all the support.

# What my project does ?

Just a quick recap - RedCoffee is a CLI tool that generates PDF reports from SonarQube Community Edition’s code analysis, which lacks a native PDF export feature. While some GitHub projects addressed this need, they are no longer actively maintained. This was my pain point while working with my fellow developers and hence I built this solution.

With that, I’ve just pushed v1.8, which includes a few important fixes:

* Fixed: Duplication % was always showing as 0—this has now been corrected.
* Resolved: The last issue from the API response wasn’t appearing—this is now fixed.
* UI Tweaks: Minor improvements to the PDF formatting.

# Lessons Learned & What’s Next

While building this, I made some classic mistakes—ones that I often advise others to avoid:

1. Not Enough Test Coverage : I focused too much on quick iterations and didn’t invest enough in unit/integration tests. As someone who strongly believes in test automation, this was something I should have done from the start. Fixing this is my top priority for the next update.
2. Code Structure : Needs Work Right now, app . py has way too much logic packed into it. Without proper tests, refactoring is tricky. So, once I have good test coverage, cleaning up the structure is next on my list.

# Upgrade to v1.8

If you’re using RedCoffee, I recommend upgrading to the latest version. v1.1 is still the LTS release, but v1.8 is the most up-to-date and stable.  
If you are already using RedCoffee, here is the command to upgrade it

    pip install redcoffee --upgrade

If you are installing RedCoffee for the first time, here is the command to get up and running

    pip install redcoffee==1.8

# Target Audience:

RedCoffee is particularly useful for:

* Small teams and startups using SonarQube Community Edition hosted on a single machine.
* Developers and testers who need to share SonarQube reports but lack built-in options.
* Anyone learning Click – the Python library used to build CLI applications.
* Engineers looking to explore SonarQube API integrations.

# A humble request

If you find the tool useful, I’d really appreciate it if you could check out the GitHub repo and leave a star—it helps independent projects like this stay visible.

1iqsaaq,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1iqsaaq/that_time_i_tried_polyamory/,That time I tried polyamory…,"This is old news to me but I think it’s an interesting story so here it is. 

I will preface this by stating that I don’t have any issue with polyamory when it is done with clear communication and consent from everyone. I actually think it can be beautiful, it just turns out it isn’t for me. 

A few years back I (then 31F) met let’s call him Josh (then 29M). There was an immediate attraction both physically and emotionally. He was open about being polyamorous after a few dates and I was curious about it and really interested in him so I continued seeing him and after about a month we began officially dating. 

Being brand new to poly I explained that I was excited but also a little nervous and was open about past relationship trauma that I knew could cause some insecurities. We talked about boundaries, letting each other know if we started dating someone else, letting each other know if we were sleeping with anyone else (didn’t have to be a heads up just as soon as reasonable after the fact) and to use protection with anyone else outside of our dynamic. I had done a bunch of research and it all seemed healthy to me and like we were doing well on the communication front. 

He worked a busy job often working doubles and nights so finding time to see each other was difficult from the beginning but we made it work. There were a lot of times we’d only see each other for a few hours every week or two but when we did we would have really intense discussions. As much as it was difficult I really believed I had found the love of my life and after a couple of months when he called me his primary partner I was stoked! We talked about one day settling down in a throuple or polycule dynamic as an ideal however he initially suggested that we built a solid foundation for our relationship first. I followed his lead being very new to things. We had more discussions about poly and I remember one specifically where he said he wasn’t ready for me to start seeing other people yet. Not long after that he said girls were okay but not other men 🚩🚩🚩but a week or so later said he’d thought about it and that wasn’t fair on me. 

One day driving back to his place he told me he was going for coffee with an acquaintance of mine, Grace, and that they had matched on an app. I was caught a bit off guard because I thought we weren’t dating other people yet but it was okay. On the day of their date I did feel quite overwhelmed and insecure, I sent him a message about it and he called me. He was really reassuring and after chatting I felt heaps better about it. They arranged to hang out again and I started messaging an old friend with benefits, let’s call him Jake, we arranged to hang out on the same day as Josh and Grace were seeing each other. 
Unfortunately Grace cancelled their plans but I still hung out with Jake and we had sex. I called Josh afterwards and we chatted about it, it all seemed good but I noticed he started making jokes here and there about “big dick Jake.” I never said anything about size to either of them. 

Things continue and Josh started struggling with his mental health and workload, becoming seriously burnt out. Which meant I saw him less and our sex life became pretty much nonexistent. He wasn’t talking to or dating anyone else for months either. I cared about him, so as much as it felt lonely I stuck by him. I became self employed and tried to make my hours work so we could see each other more but it didn’t help much. 

I saw Jake once more, only fooling around a bit after he helped me sort out something for my business but not having sex and I went on a couple of dates with a guy named Jim but it didn’t go anywhere. I started talking to an old flame James (yes all J names!) but after talking to Josh decided not to pursue it further at that stage. 

Months go by and it’s pretty much the same, I paid for us to get away out of state for a few days, he slept most of the trip but I was okay with it as he needed the rest. At this stage we were barely even affectionate, my love language is physical touch but he said he didn’t have the capacity for that so I accepted that. A couple of weeks before our trip he let me know that Grace was going to come over to his place, he let me know the day before. He had night duty and after thinking about it all day I sent him a message, I didn’t call because he was on night shift, and explained that I was feeling insecure because of the lack of affection and intimacy between us and that while I didn’t want him to change his plans, if he was intimate with someone else when we hadn’t had that in so long would be painful. He called me and chewed me out saying that I was emotionally manipulating him and that I had double standards. This sent me into a spiral of doubting myself. I had actually started becoming friends with Grace and didn’t have any issue with her at all, just insecurities about the relationship with Josh. I checked in with other polyamorous friends who said that I hadn’t done anything wrong but I really beat myself up about it. 

Another few months go by, eventually his work settles down a little but in that time mine work and social schedule picked up. I still made an effort, or thought I did, to make time for Josh. But he began telling me that I never had time for him. 

He began hanging out with Grace again and I happened to bump into James (the old flame) at a friend’s birthday party. He called me a few days later and we hadn’t a massive chat, he asked about polyamory and we decided that I’d talk to Josh about it but if we got the okay we’d like to start hanging out again. I spoke to Josh the next day and explained my past with James, that we had had feelings for each other in the past and that I’d like to start seeing him again. Josh said he was a bit confused because I decided not to peruse it months back but told me to do whatever made me happy. I also had a date lined up with a woman Claire for that night which he knew about. 

My date with Claire went really well, but she is also good friends with Grace and on the date she asked me if Josh and Grace were dating or just having sex. I was a bit taken back by that because Josh hadn’t told me that they were having sex yet. James messaged me after I got home from the date and asked if I was free. I called Josh to check if he was okay with me going to see James and he said he was, so off I went. James and I had a long discussion about where things had gone wrong for us before and how we could avoid that again and ended up having sex. In the morning Josh called to check in and asked about James, I told him and he asked “are you in love with him?” I replied that I wasn’t yet but that I thought the feelings were coming back and it could go that way. Josh blew up at me, telling me he felt cheated on and that he felt like he was losing me. 

The following week Josh saw Grace four times and still hadn’t told me they were having sex. I had a big falling out with a friend so I called him to talk about it, he was very rushed on the phone but still supportive. I messaged in my group chat with Claire and Grace, who I was becoming very close with now and asked if they were free for a group video call which we had started doing a lot of. Grace replied that she wasn’t because Josh was over, but that she assumed I knew that. (Context: a few weeks before Josh had put in a boundary that we let each other know when we were seeing other people so we could respect that time.) 
I called Josh a bit upset and asked why he hadn’t told me, he told me that he didn’t want to make things worse while we were in a rough spot. I then asked why he hadn’t told me that him and Grace were having sex, and he said the same thing but I reminded him that it was going on before I started hanging out with James again. While on the phone to Josh, I got a message from Grace, “just confirming that you know Josh and I had unprotected sex.” I’ll admit I lost my mind a little bit at that and we began yelling at each other. I hung up on him. 
The next day he came past my business and asked if I was going to keep the plans we had for that night, I said no and broke up with him. 

A couple of weeks later we met up and had a big talk were we agreed to be friends and work towards building trust and getting back together. We began hanging out weekly as friends but still told each other we loved each other. Over a couple of months I thought it looked like we were on a good track, we even spent a day in bed cuddling. But about a week before my birthday he went cold on me then on my birthday I didn’t hear from him until night time and he left me a voice note on messenger. I was okay though because Claire and Grace held me through all of it, Grace saw him a couple more times but decided to drop him and they made my birthday so special. 

Another week or so goes by and I get a call from Josh before work telling me that after the breakup he started sleeping with someone he met through work and that she was pregnant which was why he’d gone quiet. He asked me to be his friend through it. Initially I agreed but later told him that I didn’t think I could do it. We went for a walk and had a long talk, I tried to express that I was hurt by the situation which resulted in being lectured for over an hour, being told I should be happy for him and then being yelled at. Now I’ll agree I was emotional about the whole thing but I don’t think I deserved that. By the end of the conversation I decided to go no contact. 

Aside from tying up loose ends and returning property to each other that was the end of that.

So there’s my little story of that time I tried polyamory. I’m actually grateful for it, as much as Josh hurt me I don’t think he is necessarily a bad person just definitely not my person. I learnt a lot for all of it, learnt a lot about myself and I wouldn’t change a moment of it because it all lead me to where I am right now.

Grace, Claire and I became best friends, they are my ride or die girls and we now have matching butt tattoos. 

I closed my business but have just been offered an amazing new career opportunity. 

I had stopped seeing James by the time I went no contact with Josh too, but immediately and I mean immediately (literally minutes) after going no contact with Josh I got a message from another old flame, my literal dream man from a fling years ago that I never thought would come back into my life. 

We started hanging out again and after a few months started dating. We are still together and this is the most beautiful healthy relationship I have ever been in. He treats me like a princess, makes so much time for me and shows so much affection. We are making plans to travel the world, with our first overseas trip in a few months, and plan on getting a house together in the next couple of years. I honestly couldn’t be happier.

I’ve been a night-shift bus driver for over fifteen years. You see all kinds of people when you drive after midnight—drunks, lost souls, tired workers heading home. But what happened on that rainy night still haunts me.

It started like any other shift.

The rain had been falling since sundown, soft at first, then heavy. The kind of rain that made the roads slick and the air thick with mist. My wipers scraped across the windshield, barely keeping up with the downpour. The bus was nearly empty—just one old man sitting in the back, staring out the window, his breath fogging up the glass.

I followed my usual route, stopping at empty stations, the headlights cutting through the rain. The streets were quiet. Only the occasional car passed by, their red taillights glowing like distant eyes.

Then, at a stop near the edge of town, I saw him.

A lone figure stood under the dim streetlight, hood up, shoulders hunched against the rain. He didn’t wave, didn’t move—just stood there, waiting.

I pulled over, the brakes hissing in the cold air. The doors swung open.

He stepped in.

The first thing I noticed was how **soaked** he was. Rain dripped from his clothes, pooling on the floor. His hood was pulled low over his face, but I caught a glimpse of his pale skin, his sharp jawline. He smelled like wet earth, like a basement that hadn’t been opened in years.

“Cold night,” I said, forcing a polite smile.

He didn’t reply. Just nodded and moved to sit near the middle of the bus.

I shut the doors and pulled away, glancing at him in the mirror. He sat stiffly, his hands resting on his knees. He never took his hood off.

Something about him made me uneasy.

Maybe it was how quiet he was. Most people at least muttered a “thank you” or sighed as they sat down. He made no sound, no movement.

The old man in the back shifted uncomfortably, but he didn’t speak. He just kept staring out the window, his face blank, eyes lost in the rain. I could see the reflection of his tired eyes in the glass, following the passing streetlights in silence.

But nothing strange happened.

The bus rumbled along the wet road. The wipers droned on. The old man got off a few stops later, leaving just me and the hooded passenger.

I focused on the drive, trying to shake the odd feeling.

The passenger never moved. Never reached for his phone. Never checked a watch. He just sat there, **staring out the window.**

Fifteen minutes later, he finally stirred.

“Next stop,” he said. His voice was low, hoarse.

I nodded. “Got it.”

A few minutes later, I slowed near an empty stretch of road. No houses. No stores. Just trees and the sound of rain.

The doors hissed open.

He stood up and stepped off the bus without a word.

Then—**he was gone.**

I didn’t see him walk away. One second, he was stepping into the rain. The next, the road was empty.

I stared into the darkness, my heart hammering.

The doors shut. The bus groaned as I pulled away, my hands clammy on the wheel.

But I didn’t think much of it.

Not for **six months.**

# Six Months Later

It was a slow afternoon. I had just finished my shift and stopped by a small diner for coffee. The place had a rack of old newspapers stacked in the corner, free for anyone to read.

I grabbed one randomly, just looking for something to skim while I sipped my drink.

Then my eyes locked on a headline.

**""Unsolved Tragedy: Man Killed in Bus Accident Still Unidentified – 20 Years Later""**

I felt a chill creep up my spine.

My breath hitched as I looked at the grainy black-and-white photo beneath the headline.

It was **him.**

The same sharp jawline. The same hollow eyes.

According to the article, **a man had died on that exact stretch of road one rainy night, 20 years ago.** He had been the only passenger when the accident happened—**the driver lost control in the storm and crashed.** No ID, no family, no name. Just an unclaimed body and a mystery that never got solved.

My fingers tightened around the paper.

The date of the accident?

**The same night I had picked him up.**

I felt sick. My coffee sat untouched as I sat frozen in my seat.

I drove that road every night.

And six months ago, I picked up a passenger [who never left.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQfDJoKMYDE)",2,1739712524.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False
1iqs6tl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iqs6tl,How to use the info on a coffee bag to brew,"Please skip to the last paragraph if you cant be bothered to read my elongated introduction.


Hello guys, I've been in and around this lovely community for a few months now. As many of you may have also experienced, as one's coffee hobby grows deeper, creating a cup of coffee you feel satisfied with  becomes a rarer event. Ignorance is well and truly bliss in the world of coffee. Worrying about grind size, temperature, bloom time, swirl or wiggle?!?! is quite frankly enough to drive a man insane. 

I'm now too deep in this world to turn back so I thought it was about time I asked you guys for some friendly advice because.. well, i want to be able to enjoy my cups of coffee again!

It is not secret that different coffee's brew differently. I know that how you brew, grind, choose a temperature, can be dictated by the information on the bags of coffee. The trouble is I still have no idea how to digest the information on a bag of coffee. For example, i recently brewed an Anerobically washed Ethiopian coffee the other day and had absolutely no idea what an Ethiopian coffee requires to achieve an excellent cup. Should i use boiling water? But I heard April Coffee tends to brew Ethiopians at 92°. Should i change my water ratio to 1:17 to achieve a higher extraction? Or should i just grind finer and get a sweeter up? Wait! Does the fact its Anerobically washed change anything?!?! You get the jist. I know there's information out there but quite frankly, finding something specific to your bag is tricky to find. 

This brings me to the question I came here to ask all you experts today:

Which sets of information on a bag of coffee should i focus on when crafting a cup of coffee and what does changing them effect in my final cup? I know this is probably a long winded question so maybe i have to continue digging myself. I will attach some photos of some coffee ill be brewing in a few days. I'll be extremely grateful if someone can explain how i should ne brewing them (not techniques per say but more to do with grind size, water ratio, temperature etc.) 

All help is much appreciated :)

By chance I did find one mouth wash with all of the good ingredients. It's not cheap but it goes a long way. It comes in a concentrate so you add water which means no huge containers of nasty blue or green mouth wash and it's natural.
It's called 'Hello' mighty and tiny.

(I am in no way affiliated with the brands I mention here)

It comes with a tiny cup that shows you how much water to fill up too.
You can use one or two squirts. I love this stuff. My mouth is feeling so much better. No burning and it feels fresh.
As well it doesn't linger too long. I can have coffee soon after without too much flavor influence from it's lovely flavor. You could always rinse with water. 

On top of that sugar free gum is a must.  I tried Simply Gum.

Gender: Male

 
Age: 24


Height & Build: 5'5"", relatively fit


Relationship Status: Single


Education & Profession:
I have a Bachelor’s in Software Engineering and currently work as a software engineer in Sydney, Australia.


A Little About Me:
I was born and raised in the UAE and I have spent much time in Pakistan tbh, originally from Punjab. These days, I’m living the Sydney life, balancing my tech career with my love for the outdoors(I know it's quite cliche 🤣). I’m a practicing Muslim who doesn’t smoke, drink, or do drugs. I’d call myself a coffee addict and an adventurous soul who enjoys camping, hiking, fishing, and long walks. I also love gaming when I’m not exploring the great outdoors. Romantic at heart, I value honesty, love, and strong family connections.


Family:
I come from a Punjabi family with two older brothers, one younger brother, and my amazing mom and dad. We’re big on supporting each other and value good vibes all around.


Where I Live:
I currently reside in Sydney and family in Pakistan lives in Punjab.


Religion:
I am a practicing Muslim as I pray all the prayers and have done umrah multiple times in my life. I keep all my fasting in order aswell and hopefully you are aligned on the same level as me.


What I’m Looking For:
I’m looking for someone who is kind, beautiful in her own way, and amazing to be around. A partner who values family, has a positive outlook on life, and enjoys the little adventures. Bonus points if you love coffee and are up for camping or fishing trips!


Deal Breakers:
I don’t get along with overly emotional or cold personalities, and I’d prefer someone with no major family issues. Excessive male friendships or negativity in relationships are also not my vibe. I don't mind if you had past relationships as long as you have overcome it.


My Timeline:
I’m hoping to take the plunge in about 1-2 years. In the meantime, I’d love to get to know the right person and grow together. The reason for this is that I wish to build my financial situation a bit more and then get married.


Why You Should Say Yes:
If you’re someone who wants a romantic, caring, and supportive partner who can cook almost everything, I’m your guy. I’ll always prioritize our happiness, keep the spark alive, and make sure life feels like an adventure we’re on together.

As I was waiting for my order, I noticed this older guy at the self-serve station, looking completely lost. He had one of those reusable cups, just staring at the oat milk like it personally offended him.

I hesitated for a sec because, yknow, social anxiety, but then I just asked, “Hey, do you need help?” He looked so relieved and admitted he had no idea how the whole milk-and-syrups situation worked. Apparently, his wife used to make his coffee every morning before she passed, and now he’s trying to “figure out how to make it taste right” but can never get it the same. Thatt alone kinda punched me in the chest.

So I walked him through it two pumps of vanilla, a little oat milk, and a stir (he said because she always stirred it 3 times ToT). He took a sip, smiled, and went, “You just saved me four dollars. This tastes better than what they make behind the counter.” Then he patted me on the shoulder like I just fixed his whole life.

I know it was such a tiny thing, but I’ve been thinking about it all day. Like, one day, the person who knows exactly how you like your coffee might not be there anymore, and that’s just,, life? I don’t know why this wrecked me at 8 AM on a Friday, but here we are.

We finally sit in a coffee shop. She's the most adorable girl ever, gives me a big hug, but for the first 20ish minutes of our discussion she just stress dumps on me. She talks about studying for her MCAT, job, dealing with her friends, and dog sitting. I tried my best to be part of this conversation and pay attention but I could hardly get a word in, one second she was on this topic the next she was on another. I felt like if I were to say something it would've been rude to interrupt her. We had our back and forth from there on but she never really asked a question at all about me, just once or twice. It didn't feel like she was there to get to know me she just wanted someone to talk her woes about. I'm happy that I had the opportunity to get to know her but it felt one sided. She then had to take a call from her brother about something stupid in the middle of a date. 

Admittedly, when I was trying to pick up the conversation I was trying to talk about my passion for dentistry, and how I helped made lives better as a n assistant, and how I got into it thinking it could relate to her. *She started talking about her dental health, which was when things just went south.* I was hoping she'd follow up with why she choose medicine. 

At the end of the date, she hugged me again and said she wanted to see me again. Few hours pass, I text her, she now said she didn't feel a connection....

Bro, the date was at best 50 minutes long; She ran a little late and we got our coffees. It wasn't bad but you're just gonna cut things off after the first date?

Maybe I'm just coping for fucking up.

I love everyday small gestures. I made a coffee for you, I know this is your favorite book so I read it and now we can discuss it type of thing.


Buuut. But. I love valentines day. I usually got to spend time with my SO and be grateful for eachother and make an effort to take time off and just slow down. Appreciate. Admire. Be still for a minute just us. Its a reminder for me to celebrate all love friendships, platonic, whatever. When I was single I would go out with friends. 

If I love someone, ofc I want them to feel loved everyday and extra loved on holidays. And I want celebrations and I want them to feel special. Why all this hatred towards a day that you could spwnd with your SO and be happy and celebrate your relationship?

People on tiktok slandered me for saying that while yes YES, YOU NEED TO LOVE YOUR PARTNER EVERYDAY, VDAY IS SPECIAL. 

I got called shallow, materialistic, showing off.

I've been struggling with anhedonia, which I believe was induced by antipsychotics. Recently, I've been wondering if quitting coffee could make any difference in my symptoms. I know caffeine affects dopamine and adenosine, so I’m curious if anyone here has noticed any improvement after stopping coffee.

Has anyone experienced even a slight relief in motivation, pleasure, or emotional depth after cutting out caffeine? Or did it make no difference at all?

**Tillamook State Forest, Oregon | October 17, 2023 | 06:47 PST**

The fog hung like wet gauze over the Douglas firs, their trunks bleeding rust-colored sap where bark beetles had burrowed. 

Deputy Carla Ruiz’s boots sank into the loam as she picked her way uphill, radio crackling static. 

Her flashlight beam cut through the mist, catching the glint of a Mylar emergency blanket tangled in blackberry thorns. *Hunters* , she thought—until the smell hit her. Not the earthy rot of deer carcasses. This was sweet, metallic, *human* .

“Sheriff? Got something.” Her voice wavered. “Off Trail 12, near Marker 9. Bring CSU.”

**07:22 PST**

Sheriff Ed Corbin arrived with two CSIs in tow, their gear clattering like scrap metal. The scene was textbook rural law enforcement chaos: a rookie vomited into a fern while a paramedic chain-smoked by his rig. Corbin, a walrus of a man with a ’90s-era mustache, squatted beside the body.

The victim—male, late 20s—lay spread-eagled in a mossy clearing. His chest cavity had been split sternum-to-pelvis, ribs pried outward like wings. No blood pooled beneath him; the ground was bone-dry.

“Jesus wept,” muttered CSI Nguyen, adjusting her nitrile gloves. “Livor mortis suggests he’s been here 8–10 hours, but…” She gestured to the wound. “No animal scavenging. No flies.”

Corbin grunted. “What’s that on his forehead?”

Nguyen leaned in. A symbol had been carved into the skin: **ᛉ** . “Elder Futhark rune. *Algiz* —protection, or maybe a warning.” She paused. “Or it’s some TikTok shit. Kid’s got a fresh Blackcraft Cult tattoo on his forearm. Could be LARPing gone wrong.”

“Bullshit. Since when do LARPers yank out a guy’s *heart* ?” Corbin pointed to the hollow chest cavity.

Nguyen’s flashlight trembled. “Who said anything about the heart?”

**09:15 PST | FBI Field Office, Portland**

Special Agent Eleanor Voss scrolled through the crime scene photos on her tablet, her coffee going cold. Across the bullpen, her partner, Special Agent Marcus Rojas, argued with a junior analyst over jurisdictional semantics.

“Look,” Rojas snapped, “if the vic was dragged across state lines *postmortem* , it’s still our circus. *Jones v. California* (2021)—check the damn memo.”

Voss tuned him out. She’d spent six years in Behavioral Analysis, profiling ritual killers from Appalachia to Anchorage. This case reeked of something older. The rune. The excision of the heart—a textbook *macto* offering in certain neopagan traditions. But the precision of the cuts…

“Rojas.” She didn’t look up. “We’re rolling to Tillamook. Tell Quantico to dust off the Franklin County files.”

“The ’98 farmhouse cult thing?”

“They used the same rune.”

Rojas groaned. “You’re gonna make me read *another* 1,200-page casefile, aren’t you?”

“Yep. And you’re driving.”

**11:03 PST | Crime Scene**

The forest hummed with forensics techs and the whine of a portable generator. Voss ducked under the police tape, her blazer snagging on a thistle. Rojas lagged behind, cursing as mud suctioned his Oxfords.

“Agents.” Corbin nodded, arms crossed. “Welcome to the freak show.”

Voss ignored him, zeroing in on the victim’s left hand. The fingers were curled inward, nails caked with soil and… *resin?* She bagged a sample.

“Missing heart’s one thing,” Rojas said, squatting beside her. “But why peel his fingertips? No prints, sure, but that’s overkill.”

“Not if they wanted to send a message.” Voss gestured to the victim’s splayed ribs. “This is a *display* . The heart’s removal suggests a sacrificial offering, but the mutilation… this is rage. Personal.”

Corbin snorted. “You profilers ever just say ‘dude’s fucked up’ and call it a day?”

Rojas stood, wiping his hands. “We’ll need the victim’s dental records sent to our field office. Also, any security cam footage from—”

“Yeah, good luck. Nearest traffic cam’s 20 miles south.” Corbin spat tobacco. “But talk to Old Bill at the Shell station. DVRs everything ’cause of ‘the deep state.’”

**13:17 PST | Shell Station, Highway 6**

Bill Gunderson, a sinewy Vietnam vet with a “DON’T TREAD ON ME” tat peeking from his collar, squinted at Voss’ badge.

“Feds, huh? Here to blame them Antifa kids again?”

Voss forced a smile. “Just need to see your parking lot footage from last night.”

Bill grunted, leading them to a backroom crammed with deer-hunting magazines and a CRT monitor. The footage showed a muddy Subaru Outback pulling in at 22:03. The driver—a woman in a Patagonia fleece—bought a Monster Energy and beef jerky.

“Recognize her?” Rojas asked.

“Nope. City plates, though. Washington.”

Voss froze the frame. The woman’s sleeve had ridden up, revealing a tattoo: **ᛉ** .

**16:49 PST | FBI Mobile Command Unit**

Rojas slammed the van door. “Victim’s ID came through. Jason Hilder, 28. Uber driver from Seattle. Reported missing by his roommate… three days *after* he left for a ‘camping trip.’”

Voss cross-referenced Hilder’s phone data. “Last ping was near Silver Falls. Same area where two hikers vanished in August.” She pulled up a map dotted with red pins. “There’s a pattern. Every 13 weeks—October, July, April. Like a lunar calendar.”

Rojas frowned. “Cult?”

“Or a buyer. Organs, trafficking…”

“Nah. Traffickers don’t do ritualistic carvings. This is *devotional* .”

Voss’ phone buzzed. Nguyen’s lab report: resin from Hilder’s nails matched frankincense. Commonly used in religious ceremonies.

“We need to find that Subaru,” Voss said.

Rojas checked his Glock’s magazine. “And if the driver’s our unsub?”

“Then we’ll ask her why she’s copycatting a 25-year-old murder.”

**19:55 PST | Forest Service Road 14**

The Subaru was parked askew in a pullout, driver’s door ajar. Voss approached low, flashlight in her left hand, Sig Sauer in her right. No footprints. No blood. Just a half-eaten Clif Bar on the dash and a faint hum.

“Smell that?” Rojas whispered.

Frankincense.

Voss’ beam hit a trail of white petals leading into the woods. *Hellebore* . Toxic if ingested.

“They’re baiting us,” she said.

“Yep.” Rojas thumbed his radio. “Sheriff? We’re gonna need SWAT.”

The radio fizzed. No signal.

“Shit.”

Somewhere in the trees, a low chant began.

**Chapter 2: Communion**

**Tillamook State Forest, Oregon | October 17, 2023 | 20:03 PST**

The chant swelled—a guttural drone, more animal than human. Voss motioned Rojas toward a cluster of boulders, their flashlights off now. Moonlight bled through the fog, glinting off the hellebore petals strewn like breadcrumbs. Too obvious, Voss thought. They want us to follow.

Rojas mouthed, Ambush?

She shook her head. Flank left.

They split, Voss crouch-walking parallel to the trail while Rojas hugged the tree line. His Oxfords skidded on lichen; he caught himself silently. Twenty yards ahead, the forest opened into a clearing.

Voss froze.

Six figures stood in a semicircle, cloaked in burlap sacks stitched with red thread. No faces visible—just the glint of a blade in the moonlight. At their feet, a fire pit smoldered, the air thick with frankincense and something acrid. Burning hair.

The center figure raised a deer femur, rattling a string of human molars. The chant shifted to garbled Old Norse: ""Þegi þú, heiðni véurr, ok gefa blóð...""

Rojas edged closer, Glock trained. A branch snapped under his heel.

The chanting stopped.

**20:07 PST**

Voss lunged behind a cedar as the first shot rang out—not Rojas’. A muzzle flash lit the clearing. Revolver, .38 Special. The bullet splintered bark above her head.

""FBI! DROP YOUR WEAPONS!"" Rojas bellowed, voice cracking.

The figures scattered. One bolted toward Voss, burlap flapping. Female, early 30s, machete in hand. Voss sidestepped, sweeping her leg. The woman face-planted into mud, machete skidding away.

""STOP! ON THE GROUND—""

The woman rolled, flinging a handful of powdered lime. Voss gagged, eyes burning. Blinded, she fired twice. A wet thud. A scream.

When her vision cleared, the woman was crawling toward the trees, blood seeping through her cloak. Gut shot. Nonfatal.

""Marcus! STATUS!""

No answer.

**20:11 PST**

Rojas was pinned behind a rotting log, trading fire with two cultists. One wielded a crossbow—homemade, rebar bolts—while the other lobbed Mason jars filled with gasoline. The third jar shattered at Rojas’ feet, flames licking his pant leg.

""FUCK—"" He beat out the fire with his sleeve, sweat blurring his aim.

The crossbowman lunged. Rojas fired. Missed. The bolt grazed his bicep, slicing through fabric and skin.

""Goddamn LARPers—"" He tackled the man, both crashing into a blackberry thicket. Thorns ripped at Rojas’ neck as they grappled. The cultist stank of body odor and myrrh.

""Hann mun eta hjarta þitt!"" the man spat.

""Eat this—"" Rojas headbutted him, breaking his own sunglasses. The cultist went limp.

**20:19 PST**

Voss zip-tied the gut-shot woman’s wrists, her own hands shaking. ""Who’s your leader? Where’s Jason Hilder’s heart?""

The woman laughed, blood bubbling on her lips. ""Þú ert of seint... hann er þegar ofurgestur.""

A twig snapped. Voss spun, Sig Sauer raised.

Sheriff Corbin emerged, shotgun leveled, flanked by three deputies. ""Jesus Christ, Voss! You lit up the whole damn forest!""

""SWAT’s still 10 minutes out!"" a deputy yelled.

""Tell ’em to bring body bags,"" Rojas muttered, limping into the clearing. His arm bled freely, mixing with blackberry juice.

**20:32 PST**

The cultists were gone—all but two. The gut-shot woman bled out en route to the ambulance. The crossbowman, cuffed in the back of Corbin’s cruiser, muttered in Icelandic.

""Ran his prints,"" Voss said, pressing a gauze pad to Rojas’ arm. ""Turns out he’s Björn Þorsteinsson. Deported twice for ecoterrorism. Linked to a neo-Heathen group in Reykjavik.""

Rojas winced. ""Since when do Vikings do human sacrifice?""

""Since never. This isn’t Ásatrú—it’s a blend. The rune, the Old Norse… but the macto ritual’s Roman. They’re mixing pantheons. Improvising.""

Corbin spat. ""So we got a buncha college kids playin’ Dungeons & Dragons too hard?""

Voss stared at the dying fire pit. Amid the ash lay a half-melted Zippo engraved with a logo: RED CROW CONSULTING.

""Jason Hilder’s roommate said he drove for Uber,"" she said slowly. ""But his tax returns show he worked part-time… here."" She showed Rojas the logo on her phone.

""Red Crow. Land development firm. Clearcut half the forest last year.""

""Until the EPA shut them down for arsenic in the groundwater.""

Rojas smirked. ""So our ‘cult’ is pissed-off hippies?""

""Or a smokescreen."" Voss pocketed the Zippo. ""Someone’s using folklore to hide corporate body disposal.""

**21:45 PST | FBI Mobile Command Unit**

The medic stitched Rojas’ arm under a battery-powered lamp. ""Lucky the bolt was rusty. Tetanus shot’s in the fridge.""

""Just give me whiskey,"" Rojas grumbled.

Voss scoured Red Crow’s employee database. Jason Hilder, Björn Þorsteinsson, and two missing hikers all drew paychecks from the same shell company.

""Bingo,"" she whispered.

A shadow passed the van’s window.

Voss glanced up. A figure stood in the tree line—tall, gaunt, wearing a stag skull mounted on weathered wood. It raised a hand, palm outward, revealing the same **ᛉ** rune burned into flesh.

I wonder how often you should exchange the filters. On my model the instructions say once per month but I'm not sure it they could also be used twice as long. Probably also depends on the amount of filtered water. I'm not too concerned about germs because I only use it for coffee and am thus always boiling it but of course it should also not accumulate germs to a point where it gets icky.

It would be really interesting to see some data on how the TDS and mineral composition of the filtered water changes over the weeks. Does someone have any data on this?

And how often do you change your filters if you use such a pitcher?

Because of the slow degradation I don't really notice a difference from cup to cup, maybe only when changing the filter. But then still I can't recall a noticeable difference, so maybe I could really use them for longer.

Have you ever heard of a postman who built a palace?  No, it's not a fairytale. It's the incredible true story of Ferdinand Cheval and his Palais Idéal, a truly unique and unforgettable place to visit in southern France.

This isn't your typical palace – it's a whimsical, fantastical creation built entirely from stones collected over 33 years!  Ferdinand Cheval, a simple postman, dedicated his life to this extraordinary project, sculpting his dreams into a breathtaking monument.  

**What to Expect at the Palais Idéal:**

Imagine a building that defies architectural norms.  Think elaborate towers, intricate carvings, and fantastical creatures sculpted into the very fabric of the stone.  The Palais Idéal is a vibrant tapestry of styles, blending elements of Roman, Gothic, Hindu, and Egyptian architecture – all stemming from Cheval's imagination.

Prepare to be amazed by:

* **The sheer scale of the project:**  It's bigger than you might imagine, with numerous rooms and hidden corners to explore. Allow plenty of time to wander and soak it all in.
* **The intricate detail:**  Every inch of the palace is bursting with intricate details, from tiny carvings to larger-than-life figures. Look closely – you'll discover new wonders with every glance.
* **The unique atmosphere:**  The Palais Idéal has an almost magical aura. It feels otherworldly, transporting you to a realm of fantasy and creativity.
* **The surrounding gardens:** The palace isn't just the building itself; the surrounding gardens are equally captivating, adding to the overall enchanting experience.


**Practical Information for your visit:**

* **Location:** The Palais Idéal is situated in Hauterives, a small village in the Drôme department of France. It's easily accessible by car.
* **Opening Hours:** Check the official website for the most up-to-date opening times and potential closures.  This is crucial, as opening times can vary depending on the season.
* **Admission Fee:**  There's a small entrance fee, well worth the cost for the experience.
* **Getting There:**  While a car offers the most flexibility, public transport options may be available, though potentially less convenient.  Check local bus schedules in advance.


**Beyond the Palace: Exploring Hauterives**

While the Palais Idéal is the star attraction, Hauterives is a charming village worth exploring. Take a leisurely stroll through the streets, enjoying the peaceful atmosphere and perhaps grabbing a coffee at a local café.


**Why you should visit the Palais Idéal du Facteur Cheval:**

This isn't just a building; it's a testament to human creativity, perseverance, and the power of a dream.  It's a place where you can escape the ordinary and embrace the extraordinary.  It's a truly unique experience you won't soon forget. So, pack your bags, plan your trip to southern France, and prepare to be enchanted by the Palais Idéal du Facteur Cheval. You won't regret it!

Hey there,

I’ll be in Bangalore from next week, and while I could just explore the city solo, I think it’d be way more fun with the right company. So, I’m looking for someone who enjoys good conversations, effortless banter, and maybe a little bit of mischief (the fun kind).

A little about me: I’m a doctor, a coffee enthusiast, and someone who can probably diagnose your caffeine addiction while enabling it. I enjoy music, spontaneous adventures, and deep conversations—preferably over a flat white. I also firmly believe in the scientific method, which means we should first test our conversational chemistry online before taking this experiment to real life.

If we vibe, I’d love to take you out—maybe a cozy café, a rooftop bar, or a live music spot. And if the chemistry is undeniable… well, I’m all for seeing where the night (or morning) takes us, with full consent, mutual enthusiasm, and zero awkwardness the next day.

So, if you’re fun, open-minded, and up for making my Bangalore trip a little more interesting, drop me a message! Let’s chat, flirt, and see where this goes.

who has the righteousness to point a finger if someone stops being what they arent? the false being? no one. as all are in false being not realizing true being is divine. should be a good week of people proclaiming shift energies.

I honestly never thought I would be in this situation but genuinely I am conflicted with what I should do. I had a falling out with some of my friends I made in exchange and I’m contemplating if I should attempt to talk it out. 

A bit of backstory;

I went to the uk for exchange last year, and that was when I met D, K and Z. I was happy to meet them as we travelled around the city together. D, K and I are from the same country while Z was from a different one. Admittedly during the exchange, I did decline their invitations to hang out because I wanted to focus on my modules which I assumed they would be okay with since they said it was okay. One of the days which, I didn’t know at the time was K’s birthday to which I was extremely apologetic for. During this period, during hangouts D and K would always be late. Not 5-10 minutes late. But an hour or two late without any notice, which irked me (and I have brought it up)

Fast forward to end January. Z was coming to our country as a holiday, during the lunar new year period which I celebrate. We had all wanted to meet up which I was excited for. I mentioned to D and K that I would be late for the meet up as I had reunion dinner and family commitments but would join soon after. They were supposed to meet at around 7pm, at around 7:30pm, Z called me saying they were late to which I said yeah they always are, that’s why I intend to give them an invitation with an hour earlier so they would arrive ‘on time’. (This comment was made through text). A bit later I joined, I assumed they were finishing up dinner already so I opted to wait outside and shop around, not knowing they were only partially done. As to which one of them ran out to grab me, in hindsight I admit this is weird on my part. 

During the dinner conversation, I tried to make conversation but I don’t know if it was because I was too soft or what they didn’t respond to my questions. K did ask me if I was ok and I said I was simply tired from visitations but still wanted to hang out. At this point I knew they had taken Photobooth pictures without me and assumed we were gonna do it again together. But apparently not? We went straight to a jazz bar, and the entire ride when I was sitting in front I felt like I was being left out of conversation to the point the taxi driver asked if we were friends, and I think this was when I checked out of the conversation. At the bar itself, D did ask me if I was okay and tried to include me but I think a combination of tiredness and frustration just made me seem unapproachable. I decided to leave after the bar, citing I had work the next day. 

On the train ride home, I crafted a paragraph and sent it to Z with me saying that I felt excluded in the activities and also apologised from making myself seem distant, admitting that they did try but I was so in my feels I didn’t respond positively. In hindsight, I REALLY SHOULD HAVE SENT THID AFTER SHE LEFT THE COUNTRY. I sent the same message to D as well. The next morning at 4am, Z responded to my message with an 8 min recording, basically saying that I was negative energy, I brought bad aura and I was the only one at fault and that maybe time apart would be okay. To this I responded that yup that’s fair, I hope you enjoy your time here and I genuinely thought that was the end of it. It wasn’t. A few hours later, she sent a screenshot of me saying that D and K were always late to the group chat claiming I was starting shit. And I was genuinely so frustrated I said bye and deleted her number. She claimed she was just being direct and honest, which to me meant you would have brought it up earlier?? A few hours later, I wrote a message to D and K explaining my side and that I didn’t think me saying they were late was shit talking and that yes I am also to blame. D wrote a message saying that I was selfish for sending that message knowing Z was here a few days. Maybe it’s a difference in lifestyle, but for me I would like to talk it out and that was what D and K claims they like to do as well. D concluded the statement saying that time apart would be good for now. 


I don’t know how this blew up so badly because I really wanted to talk this out and thought this could have been discussed like adults. I cannot be bothered with Z anymore because of her sending screenshots painting me as a bad person when I barely even talk to her in the first place. But I liked my friendship with D and K, where we were all supposed to travel together. 

I am thinking of asking D and K out for coffee in mid March and just talk it out, no matter if we remain friends or not in the end. My close friends says it isn’t worth saving the friendship but my parents are on the side where I should at least try to talk it out. I’m so conflicted on what to do and if I am actually the negative energy and a blight on the friendship. 

I want to reiterate saying I know I’m not completely innocent and I am a cause of the issue, but did it warrant such a big blow up? 

I’m at a loss on what to. Please any advice and insights are appreciated ",1,1739709329.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

comparison to my previous job where i was on my feet all day every day as a barista.

but i am struggling with the difference in workload. in my old jobs you’re expected to be on the ball at all times, you really get so much wrung out of you for minimum wage- serve customers constantly, cleaning, making coffee, closing tasks. 

but now i feel like if i worked wall to wall at my current job i could get all of my stuff done fairly quickly. but the pace is just so relaxed. i can take a 10 minute break every half an hour and it has no consequence. i almost feel bad about it. at my old job toilet breaks were pretty much timed, and if you skived off in the back for 5 minutes it was noticed. 

and furthermore, my current job feels inconsequential to me, like it’s not making any difference in the world. but my previous job where i was a barista in a hospital the results of my work were pretty instantaneous, and sometimes it felt nice to provide a service that people appreciated. i don’t really care a lot about this (i’m **so** glad i no longer have to work a customer facing job) but it’s something i’ve noticed. 

it’s funny that i used to work so hard for pennies- especially when i was 21/22 and feel like i was looked down on for my job- when now that i have a job people might consider more ‘respectable’ it means nothing in the world.

I’ve been doing this for years, but since COVID, it feels like it’s getting harder and harder to make a meaningful profit for the hours I put in.

Costs are rising—van expenses, insurance - van, public liability, tools, calibration of tools, and purchasing spare parts—and at the end of the month, after chasing late payments (which is a constant battle), I sometimes wonder what the point is. If I break down all the hours I work, including admin, weekends, and chasing invoices, I’m earning less than minimum wage. Remember, being self employed, we have no sickness pay, holiday pay or pension contributions from the employer.

Many customers push for cheaper rates, and I often end up caving in, because I feel bad for them. My partner keeps telling me, *“You run a business, not a charity!”* But the worry is that if I charge more, someone else will just undercut me, especially new younger guys coming onto the scene.

I was talking to an old mate—he’s a plumber 59 years old, and he said he’s looking to get out soon because the stress isn’t worth it anymore. He knows younger self-employed tradespeople in their 40's who feel the same.

So, my question is: **Are other self-employed tradespeople in the UK feeling the same pressures? Is this just how it is now, or am I doing something wrong—like not charging enough?**

Would really appreciate any words of advice, comfort, or just knowing I’m not alone in this!

A beige carpet (already installed)

An oak coffee table (which I made and want to display)

An IKEA Besta media wall for extra storage ( this only comes in white, black or grey, but I wouldn't be opposed to painting one) 

Some green accents to tie in with the rest of the house
