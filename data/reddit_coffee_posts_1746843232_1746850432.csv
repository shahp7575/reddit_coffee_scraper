So I'd be up to do the generic thing of swapping pet pics, talking about games or music, supervillain plans and all that jazz. My sleep is messed up so if you're wanting soneone to chat all night and day with that's me.

I like games and play on Xbox and PlayStation. Space Marine 2 and Destiny and helldivers 2 are my go-to games. I enjoy shooters and action games and the occasional city builder or rts on pc. Any recommendations are welcome. I'm excited for the new Doom game. Will also be down playing games if we hit it off.

I like cooking and so far I haven't gotten sick or made someone else sick so you can say I'm like the Gordon Ramsay of cooking something edible. I do look at recipes in terror and sometimes actually cook them. Looking for cool chatters and maybe we can play games. Or not. Who knows.

Was a huge reader until the fire nation blessed me with sudden ADD or HD or 8k or whatever. Still have the Dune sequels to read. Big warhammer 40k novel enjoyer too.


Pink Floyd is my favorite band. I mainly listen to rock and metal. But I do on occasion listen to the Macarena and Barbie girl as I shower or cook. Zeppelin, the doors and a myriad of other classic bands are always playing.

I like coffee too. Preferably caramel. Also a redbull fan. I can drink many of those. Probably shouldn't since I don't think that's medically sound.  ",1,1746850287.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

My grinder is weighing well, but might need to be a bit finer - I can sort that out. I don’t do anything to it once it’s ground, no distribution or anything, just tap it side to side, bang it on the mat and then tamp it down. 

I’ve also got my shots taking around 23 seconds on the double shot, which is where it’s starting to blonde out and I get a reasonable crema. Temperature is set at 95, but I haven’t measured it or set an offset.
Puck is a little wet when I bang the filter out but it comes out easily

What I’m not getting is a coffee that’s tasting strong - my old Boiler/HX machine gave strong coffee with the same beans (although they’re now a bit older). I’m getting around 3 bar of over pressure on the gauge, not the 9 bar recommended to make a good coffee

So - what can I try and do to increase the pressure and get a better extraction? I’m thinking the easiest way (without swapping to the dual wall baskets) would be to decrease the grind size with what I have?
I’m thinking of getting a spring loaded tamp but not much else outside that

Nine days of solitude, soul-searching, and silent conversations with the universe — and I showed up for every single moment. I walked unfamiliar paths, tasted new flavors, stood under quiet skies, and let the wind and fog in the mountains wrap around the pieces of me that needed mending.

This trip wasn’t just about seeing new places. It was about seeing “me” more clearly.

I drove around with no rush, just music, open roads, with my thoughts as my only quiet companion. I woke up early — not because I had to, but because something in me wanted to greet the day. Mornings became sacred again, especially those peaceful coffee moments when time slowed down and the world felt kind.

And then there were the people — new friends who reminded me that connection can still be warm, light, and unexpectedly healing. Even in my solitude, life found ways to reach me.

Maybe I cried. Maybe I laughed alone in a small cafe or stared too long at a sunset that didn’t need words. Whatever it was — it mattered. Every quiet moment added something back to me. Bit by bit, I remembered who I am when no one else is watching. And I began, gently, to forgive myself for everything I thought I should’ve been by now.

I am healing — not in loud, dramatic ways, but in soft, stubborn ones. Like spring pushing through after a hard winter. Like light slowly returning after a long eclipse.

This trip is a reminder that: I am not lost. I am in the middle of becoming.

I will always hold on to the hope I found in the mountains, in the mist, in the rhythm of my own breath. I will let it lead me forward — not back to who I was, but toward to who I am still becoming.

And when the days get heavy again — because they might — I’ll remember this version of me. The one who kept walking anyway.

Good luck to us all. And may we continue to find peace every day.

Weeks went by since she last saw Reed, he’s been busy with work and Nari misses him so much. She’s been shamelessly checking his social media liking and commenting whenever he posts. Nari decided she wanted to relax on her day off and sit by the fire in her favorite bean bag chair while reading her favorite book and sipping on some hot chocolate and eating some Chinese take out. To make her day off even better she wore Reeds sweat shirt. “It smells just like him” Nari thought to herself with a smile. She buried her nose into his sweat shirt missing him even more than she already had. Nari continued to read her book until her iphone buzzes and she sees that it’s a text from Mace. 

➕ Hey, are you okay?  ⬆️

Read 3:39 PM

Naris been dodging Mace since Reed told her the news. She feels confused, frustrated and angry at Mace all at once. She knows that she can’t keep avoiding him and that she’ll have to face him one of these days but today was definitely not the day, or so, Nari thought. She puts her phone away and rolls her eyes. Just as she started to read again her doorbell rang. Not thinking much of it she yells upstairs to her roommate Morgan to let her know she’s getting the door and once Nari got to the door her heart pounded. It was Mace. “what the heck is he doing here?!” She glanced down at her outfit. “he can’t see me in this.” Nari thought about ignoring the door until she heard Mace from the other side of the door. 

Mace: I know you’re in there. I literally just heard you tell your roommate you got the door. 

Sighing Nari slowly opened the door feeling defeated. And once she opened the door fully there stood Mace. She didn’t know what to say, she was stunned. She didn’t get to plan what she was going to say to Mace once she saw him again face to face. Nari realized how much she did miss Mace seeing him like this in person. All those good memories she had with Mace started flooding back, her anger almost fully melted away. He looked different, Nari hadn’t seen him in so long, he looked much taller, his fragrance was different but familiar and..he’s gotten more handsome, but Nari didn’t let her thoughts go beyond a compliment. “I have eyes” she thought to herself. 

Mace felt a bit annoyed when Nari finally opened the door, he saw that Nari was wearing Reeds sweat shirt, his famous move that he does with all of his girlfriends. Mace broke the silence between them as they stood there staring at eachother for a little too long. 

Mace: Do you think I can come in? 

Nari: Oh! Uh, I don’t think that’s a good idea. My roommate is here. 

Mace: Are you sure that’s the only reason why? 

Nari: Of course it is. 

Mace: Well since you won’t let me in do you mind if we can go somewhere else to talk? Since, you know, your roommate is here. 

Nari felt bad, Mace had just gotten here and she was already drawing such a harsh line between them but she definitely didn’t want to make things worse between Reed and Mace and she didn’t want Reed to be upset that Mace would have been inside her home. She didn’t think that would create a pleasant image in Reeds mind. Maybe she can invite him inside to sit for a while, it’s cold outside and plus Naris roommate is here so it’s not like they are alone alone, right. 

Nari: well, because you came all this way I guess you can come inside and sit down and wait while I get dressed. It’s cold outside. 

Mace chuckled. 

Mace: I thought you said I couldn’t come in?

Nari: I said you couldn’t come in to talk not that you can’t come in to wait. 

Mace: I don’t think that makes sense. 

Nari: I’m doing you a favor as your friend. I don’t want you sitting in your car trying to get warm wasting gas, especially in this economy. Nari said jokingly.

Nari made sure to put an emphasis on the word friend because she knew what Mace wanted to talk to her about. Mace picked up on this as he wasn’t slow to pick up on social cues. However, he was still determined to say everything he wanted to say to Nari.

Mace slightly chucked at what Nari said 

Mace: I guess I should be thanking you then.

Nari: You can thank me later. Now hurry up and come inside! It’s cold. Make yourself at home, there’s hot chocolate in the living room. 

Nari rushes up the steps to get ready, trying to find something nice to wear, guilt started set in because why did she care? Just throw something on to get this conversation over with. But this doesn’t mean she has to look a mess, she’ll be out in public. Nari came to a decision that she was going to put effort in her appearance today. 

Mace sits at Naris table sipping his coffee and looking through his phone. Nearly 30 minutes passed by and Nari still wasn’t ready. What is taking her so long, he thought to himself. Could it be that she’s getting ready to look nicer for him? A smile slowly crept upon his face but he quickly dismissed it not wanting to be delusional, but Mace knew he wasn’t delusional about one thing- Nari liked him, whether it was now or in the past, she liked him and Mace wasn’t convinced that those feelings are gone now that she’s with Reed, feelings like that don’t just disappear now that you’re in a relationship. At least that was Maces opinion. Mace was looking forward to having this conversation with Nari. 

Maces thoughts got interrupted once he heard footsteps coming down the stairs. Nari stood there looking beautiful as ever. 

Nari: Come on, let’s go. 

(hello everyone! Hope you enjoyed! There’s going to be a part 2 of 4 for this one!) 🥰🫰🫶",1,1746849695.0,Sims4Posts,0,1.0,False

It was a small moment, but it’s funny how even those split-second interactions can make you reflect. I guess it’s these tiny, almost connections that remind me there’s still a chance out there for something more, even if it didn’t happen this time. 🌊

Hi Reddit. I’m F25 and I’m honestly at my breaking point with this one. I need outside perspective because my entire family is acting like I’m Hitler for standing my ground.

So, I (25F) am a student software developer and a pretty serious PC gamer in my free time. I live alone in a one-bedroom apartment that I’ve spent years making cozy and functional. I saved up for a long time to build my dream PC setup … triple monitors, custom mechanical keyboard, ergonomic chair, the works. Altogether, my rig is worth a bit over $2,000, and I take care of it like it’s a damn child.

Last weekend, my older sister (30F) asked if she could crash at my place for one night because her apartment was being fumigated, and her husband was out of town. She has a 3-year-old son, Max, who’s… let’s say “spirited.” I love him, but he’s a little chaos goblin. I hesitated, but she swore she’d keep an eye on him and that it’d just be for one night.

They show up Saturday afternoon, and immediately it’s clear she wasn’t kidding about Max being a handful. Within ten minutes of arriving, he’d pulled four books off my shelf, thrown my houseplants on the floor, and spilled juice on my area rug. I tried to stay chill, he’s three, I get it … but I asked my sister politely to please keep him out of my office, where my PC setup is.

She rolls her eyes and goes, “He’s just exploring, he’s curious, it’s normal.” But she closes the office door anyway.

Cut to Sunday morning. I wake up to screaming. Max had apparently woken up before his mom, managed to open the office door, and decided my setup was his new jungle gym.

He pulled down one of my monitors, cracking the screen. He stuck crackers into the PC tower’s ventilation slots (I’m not kidding), yanked out my keyboard’s keycaps, and had colored on my chair with permanent marker. The cherry on top? He poured apple juice INTO the tower. INTO IT.

When I tell you I went silent… I mean dead silent. My sister comes in, sees the damage, and just says, “Oh nooo,” in this incredibly flat tone, like someone knocked over a cup of coffee. I start freaking out, and she has the AUDACITY to say, “You should’ve baby-proofed the room if it was that important to you.”

I lost it. I told her that 1) she KNEW he wasn’t supposed to be in there, 2) this is my space, not a damn daycare, and 3) baby-proofing a $2,000 gaming setup is not a standard requirement for adults living alone.

She told me to “calm down” and said that “he’s just a kid, and stuff is replaceable.” I told her she could replace it then. She said she didn’t have the money right now, but maybe in a few months she could give me a few hundred. I told her that wasn’t acceptable and that she needed to take full responsibility.

She left in a huff and now my whole family is blowing up my phone. My mom says I’m being “materialistic” and should understand that my nephew didn’t mean it. My dad said I should’ve “locked the door” if it was that important. My brother actually said, “Why do you even need three monitors anyway? That’s kind of overkill.”

I’ve filed a claim with my insurance but there’s no guarantee it’ll be covered since it was technically “guest damage.” I also told her that if she does not pay up, I'll take her to court for what happened.

Now I’m getting texts from my sister demanding an apology for “blaming her kid for being curious.” I told her I’d drop it if she covered the cost of repairs and replacements … or at least met me halfway … and she BLOCKED me.

So… Am I overreacting if I take my sister to court over this?

UPDATE: Wow. Just wow. Four hours later, I wake up from my nap to this. Thank you guys, it'll take a bit for me to read all of this.

My sister still has not unblocked me, but her husband reached out to find out what happened. I'm sorry I don't have more to tell yet, but I'll update again when I do. Seriously, thanks for the insights everyone. My head is a lot clearer now ❤️

**Update 2 (Same Post): Another 4 hours later**

UPDATE2: Hey all. My sister’s husband reached out as mentioned earlier, and we’re working out a solution if possible. He’s been really understanding as have all of you.

Also, to clarify the office situation: my one-bedroom apartment is on the smaller side (33m2/355sq ft?), so the landlord converted an old ex-clothes cabinet into a makeshift ’office.’ It’s weird, but the building is from the 40s, and ig they had to get creative with the space with an old tenant or something. So its living room (sister and her kid slept there) + kitchen (i slept there) + the ’office.’

Thanks for all the support. And the award. I really don't have the words for how nice people have been in both DMs and the comments. ❤️‍🩹

It’s comforting to know I’m not totally off-base here. I will need to see what I’m willing to do with this situation, I don’t want to lose my family, but I don’t want to start begging to be heard either.  
Thank you. ❤️

*Going no contact:*

>Yeah, I’m not ready to go full no contact right now, but I really appreciate your perspective.  
It’s definitely something I’ll keep in mind if things keep escalating and no one starts showing even a little respect for my boundaries.  
I just want accountability, not drama. But if they keep pushing, I won’t hesitate to step back. I don't think I want to know my family if they can’t appreciate the work I put into my hobbies.  
Thanks for the insight. ❤️

Commenter (downvoted): Questions -

1. does your office door lock, if so why wasn't it locked?
2. how was this unattended 3 year old able to get his hands on crackers & apple juice in an apartment that he is presumably not familiar with? Why were these items so easy for him to get to?
3. if you knew in advance that he & your sister were coming, why wouldn't you make *any* effort to either secure delicate/important items or move them somewhere he can't reach?

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1k0jehq/update_aio_for_threatening_to_take_my_sister_to/)**: April 16, 2025 (5 days later)**

Hey again.

Just wanted to post a quick update since it’s been a little under a week and a few people asked what happened next. Things are better, pretty fucking weird, and still ongoing, but here’s where we're at.

Last Saturday, my brother-in-law (BIL) came over to check out the damage himself. He actually brought Max (toddler) with him, which I was almost livid about at first, but he had a reason. He asked Max to try opening the office/closet door. The kid couldn’t do it. The door was too heavy for him.

You probably can guess where this is going. :=)

BIL offered to take my PC to the store that originally built it for me, just to see what was fixable. I agreed, but asked for something in writing just so I had some peace of mind. We put together a little agreement that he’d be responsible for it while it was with him. Yeah, yeah, it was just a formality and would not hold much merit anywhere, but it helped me feel a bit more in control.

On Monday, he dropped it off at the shop and gave them my number so they could keep me updated. He also told me he confronted my sister about how things played out. I sent him my original Reddit post too, he read the comments and apparently showed them to her. She still hasn’t unblocked me, and from what I’ve heard, was not happy about the fact my BIL is actually listening to me.

I also shared the post and some comments with my parents and brother since no one really believed me before. My parents still don’t fully get it, but they’ve at least stopped pushing back. My brother is more understanding now, though for some reason he mostly wanted to talk about how many people saw the post. I don't think either of those three still care, really, and I'm fine if they see this. Do better.

Anyway, I went to see the PC today (wednesday here). The shop said it’s mostly salvageable. It needs a very very careful internal clean and a few fans replaced, and some wiring fixed, but overall the main parts survived somehow. BIL told me he’ll cover the cost of the repair, no hesitation.

When I brought up what my sister said about not being able to pay even $200, he said she’s lying. He also said he’s not sure Max actually did all the damage. He thinks the door was left open on purpose, or that my sister might have even done some of it herself. Based on the height of the tower and where the crackers ended up, it didn’t quite add up to a toddler acting alone.

Apparently, she’s been telling him I have a “gambling addiction” (I did get a bit hooked on Genshin like 4 years ago I guess?) and that maybe this whole thing will “wake me up,” which is… new. She used to be supportive or at least indifferent. No idea where that switch came from.

So yeah. That’s where we’re at:

* My PC is being cleaned up and fixed, and BIL is covering the cost.
* Sister still has me blocked and won’t talk to me. Still tempted to start something with her tbh, especially if she actually did all of this on purpose.
* Still not ruling out small claims court depending on how things go.

Thanks again to everyone who responded to the original post. Seeing how many people understood what happened really helped me hold the line with my family when I felt like I was losing my mind.

One thing I’ve been turning over in my head lately is what if my sister *did* do something to my setup on purpose?

I don’t want to believe that, it feels like a stretch, but the more I think about it, the less so, I guess...? But then I remember how she acted when I asked her to keep Max out of the office. The eye-roll and the ""he's just curious"" comments like she didn’t take any of it seriously...??? And now hearing from my BIL that she’s been saying I have a “crippling gambling/gaming/whatever addiction” and needed to “grow up”????

It’s just… weird. She used to be cool about it. Never super into games herself, but she got that it was important to me. If something changed, I don’t know when or why. And if this was some weird way to make a point or “teach me a lesson”… that’s messed up. You're not our mom. How about talking first instead of this? I don’t want to jump to conclusions, but the more I think about it, the less it makes sense that Max could’ve done all of that alone. It's sick if she blamed her own son for it.

So yeah. Not accusing anyone outright, but that thought is there now.

And if you're my sister reading this… Which I'm guessing you are, because I bet you'd love to look at the comments that are on your side a lot. :)))

I don’t know why you blocked me. I don’t know what shifted in your head about all this. But if you actually had anything to do with damaging my setup whether it was on purpose or just through complete carelessness... Fuck. You. You know I worked hard for that. You know what that rig meant to me, and you know I would never do something like this to your stuff.

And if Max really did all of it on his own… I hope you’re paying closer attention now. Not for my sake, but for his. Read the comments on my first post again, from other parents and people with younger siblings who CLEARLY know better than you. That's all.

Thanks for reading, those who did.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: Wait - I thought the whole family was blowing up your phone telling you how mean you were?

>**OOP:** Yes a week ago, before my first post. Is there something I can clarify for you here? My sister was talking incredible smack about me to them, making it seem like I ”screamed at her child” over a ”minor mistake.” I do see the people going ”haha blowing up her phone” and I do not understand what is wrong with the wording?

Commenter: I think chatgpt is being used a lot on Reddit lately, especially in AITA type subs and a common indicator that it’s a fake post is that AI always uses the “blowing up my phone” phrase so that’s probably why they’re questioning it

>**OOP:** Ohh… I see. 🤣 Thank you for clarifying! Beep, boop.

Commenter: I’m really glad things are turning for the better. But what about the other damages (Gaming chair, keyboard, etc)?

>**OOP:** My chair is okay, the cushion, legs and back are stained with red permanent marker but I’ve learned to live with it. Coworkers and I are trying to find a chemical to fix the situation on the cushions, but an ethanol solution (small amounts, i dont want to ruin the chair further) has slowly been working at cleaning the other parts. (being a janitor does have its perks)  
Keyboard… ehh. I could not find all of the keycaps that were pulled off. I replaced the missing ones with an old keyboard’s ones (both mechanical) so it’s a bit awkward but it works for now. I might get custom ones for it if I find some that fit.  
The cracked monitor on the other hand needs to be replaced. I guess calling it ”cracked” was a kindness in itself. Still got the other two left and at least it wasnt the most expensive one… but yeah. 3:

Commenter: Um, why aren't you just having your bil pay for a new keyboard and monitor? Or professional cleaning for the chair? That's all part of the repairs.

>**OOP:** We are waiting to see if my sister confesses to anything. If so, she will be paying out of her own pocket (and paying back), not my BIL. If she confesses and refuses, then, well… 👨‍⚖️📝🔒  
The computer is essential, but the keyboard works and I still have two monitors. Thats why I am willing to wait for the other damage to be solved.

*The 'addiction':*

>I'll admit, during covid, I did spend $300 on Ganyu when she came out, but that was the ’worst’ of it. (And it was so worth it)  
I don't play much anymore, (mostly stuck on Marvel Rivals rn) but the overall margin from Genshin release to this day I've spent under $600.  
I get it, even that might look crazy to people who don't play video games, but sheesh. GAMBLING addiction…? Bruh.  
She should be more concerned of what I spend on Pokemon packs in this economy, if she's gotta be concerned over something. 🤣🤣🤣

**\*\*\*\*New Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kds0zk/my_25f_sister_30f_is_spiraling_but_i_dont_know/)**: May 3, 2025 (over 2 weeks later, 3 from OG post)\*\*\*\***

**Title:** My \[25F\] sister \[30F\] is spiraling but I don’t know how or if I should help.

A few weeks ago, I made a post (not here) about how my sister’s toddler \[3M\] almost destroyed my PC setup. Long story short, she and her son were staying with me for one night, he got into my office, and the whole setup got wrecked with juice and cracker bits shoved into the tower. The situation was awful, and when I asked my sister for help covering the damage, she made an excuse and blamed me instead.

It became whole family drama. My sister blocked me and acted like the whole thing was my fault, but her husband (my BIL) reached out on his own. He checked the damage himself, helped take the PC in for repairs, and ended up covering the costs because he was genuinely embarrassed by the way she acted. He even started questioning whether their toddler could have done that much damage on his own, especially after the kid couldn’t even open the door by himself. My BIL thought maybe my sister left it open or did something herself.

Within a week of that, my BIL confronted her and well, she kicked him out of the house. Like, full-on, told him to get the hell out, packed up his things, dumped them and left them by the curb like he was a stray dog. He told me she screamed that he was “betraying her” and “taking the side of that fucking Reddit bitch,” meaning me. She also apparently accused him of conspiring and cheating on her with me to “humiliate her publicly,” which… What???

She hasn’t let him see their kid since. No visits. No phone calls. She’s gone full black hole mode and is completely unreachable, threatening cops if he goes near. She’s blocked me, my brother, even some extended family, and is only talking to our parents, who are still enabling her but I think its only so they can keep Max at arm’s lenght.

Meanwhile, I’m hearing rumors she’s been telling people I’m unhinged, psychotic, and that I made the whole thing up. She told one of our cousins that I “lured” her kid into the office like some kind of trap or setup.

I don’t know if this is postpartum-related, or if something snapped, or if she’s just always been this vindictive and I didn’t want to see it. But I’m scared. Scared for her kid. Scared for her husband. And yeah I’m also scared for myself, because if she’s willing to ruin her whole marriage and turn the family against me just to protect a lie…?

My parents want to keep it under wraps, but I know my BIL wants to get her help. I want to get her help too, but I don’t know where to start or what to do.

What can I start with to possibly push her towards someone who can help her out? Has someone here dealt with a situation like this before? I feel helpless, as I know she is an adult and has free-will but I fear for her safety and my nephew’s safety as well…

My BIL voiced wanting to divorce her and told my parents he will get his son whether they approve or not. His side of the family is furious with mine and I’ve no idea where I stand because yeah, I guess I started this.

Is this salvageable? If so, how? What can I do? Who can I contact within the states…? Is there anything I can do even? Does anyone know?

1kj1elf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1kj1elf/i_experienced_a_messy_breakup_with_someone_at/,"I experienced a messy “breakup” with someone at work, and suspect she’s trying to isolate me from colleagues. How to proceed?","I dated someone in my grad school cohort on a casual basis for approximately 5 months, before coming to the realization that I cannot manage casual with this individual, as she alternated emotional intensity and aloofness in a way that I found confusing. I also had some reservations as to our compatibility early on, but never firmly acted on them. Approximately three months ago, the alternating intimacy and distance, coupled with my accumulated resentments, culminated in my inquiring as to whether she saw us moving toward anything more solidified in the near future. Her answer was vague and evasive, so I announced a desire to distance myself.

I felt confident in the decision: she was at a place where she wanted to focus on herself and have fun, and I wanted to find commitment in the next couple of years, so our goals were simply incompatible. Plus, she had appeared to take an interest in other people, as she’d gone on at least one other date that she confirmed and appeared to flirt pretty heavily with others. Disenchanted with the ambiguity over exclusivity, I’d pursued a few other possibilities myself (albeit reluctantly: she had my heart.) We both seemed fine with it ending. 

However, after inviting me to a coffee in the aftermath of that “breakup” conversation, she came over to my apartment and we were intimate. The lone difference from pre-“break-up” intimacy was some awkward conversation in between bouts of activity during which we both claimed to feel “conflicted.” What I recall her asking was whether I might “be patient.” Because I felt spellbound by her, despite my rational misgivings, I clung to that seeming indication that with a brief break during which she attended to her mental health, we might pursue something legitimate in the years to come (I now see my hope as naive, and more than a little pathetic.)

After that evening together, all signs of continued affection seemed to evaporate. She ignored me altogether when we saw one another, made passive-aggressive comments toward me in the company of our colleagues, and generally behaved in ways that were strikingly rude, which I found weird, given that we’d apparently agreed to remain friendly. 

I began to give up on the prospect of friendship after her no-showing a couple of events I’d invited her to without so much as a text explaining her inability to make it. The last straw was her agreeing to hangout after a work function then bowing out as soon as the event wrapped. She sent what seemed like a rather half-hearted “sorry” text afterwards, but I was tired of trying to keep up some semblance of an amicable connection, so I didn’t acknowledge it for some time. After a couple of weeks, I figured I was being childish, so I sent a simple “no worries,” to which no reply ever arrived (I didn’t expect one.) I just knew she had a history of being ghosted by former intimates, and I couldn’t bear inflicting that upon her, as disappointed as I was in the whole situation.

Days later, I noticed that I’d been added to a group chat by her, as she was organizing a hangout for our cohort. I was surprised to be included, but was touched by the gesture, and took it as a sign that there were no hard feelings and we could be collegial in the future. Anyway, I woke the next morning to see that she’d removed me overnight, despite my not interacting with the chat. Given the platform that this was on, everyone would be able to see that I’d been singled out for removal, so this felt particularly aggressive, and possibly like a bid to ostracize me from a small, tight-knit community essential for my professional development over the next several years. 

I was shocked that she would do something this public. I deactivated that account in embarrassment, but resisted the urge to block her on other platforms. I don’t know if she deleted or blocked my phone number, and I won’t be reaching out to verify.

I’m rather demoralized, as I’ve seemingly moved in the space of a few months from having a burgeoning partnership (or, maybe, as I eventually came to view it, a dead-end situationship) with someone for whom I cared deeply to having an apparent “adversary” (the word feels dramatic, but idk what else to call it) in this very same person, someone interested in interfering with my career and social life, insofar as they intersect.

I guess what I’m looking for is, maybe, some insight into why she’d do something like this. She was never overly public about the fact that we were seeing one another, so to do something that’d presumably invite questions as to why she’d second-guess including someone whom she was frequently seen alongside strikes me as unusual. Also, what, if anything, should I do when everyone is back on campus, in the event that this is what I fear it to be (part of a campaign of ostracism, for reasons utterly unknown to me, since I was under the impression she couldn’t care any less about me)?",2,1746849515.0,TwoHotTakes,4,1.0,False

Weeks went by since she last saw Reed, he’s been busy with work and Nari misses him so much. She’s been shamelessly checking his social media liking and commenting whenever he posts. Nari decided she wanted to relax on her day off and sit by the fire in her favorite bean bag chair while reading her favorite book and sipping on some hot chocolate and eating some Chinese take out. To make her day off even better she wore Reeds sweat shirt. “It smells just like him” Nari thought to herself with a smile. She buried her nose into his sweat shirt missing him even more than she already had. Nari continued to read her book until her iphone buzzes and she sees that it’s a text from Mace. 

➕ Hey, are you okay?  ⬆️

Read 3:39 PM

Naris been dodging Mace since Reed told her the news. She feels confused, frustrated and angry at Mace all at once. She knows that she can’t keep avoiding him and that she’ll have to face him one of these days but today was definitely not the day, or so, Nari thought. She puts her phone away and rolls her eyes. Just as she started to read again her doorbell rang. Not thinking much of it she yells upstairs to her roommate Morgan to let her know she’s getting the door and once Nari got to the door her heart pounded. It was Mace. “what the heck is he doing here?!” She glanced down at her outfit. “he can’t see me in this.” Nari thought about ignoring the door until she heard Mace from the other side of the door. 

Mace: I know you’re in there. I literally just heard you tell your roommate you got the door. 

Sighing Nari slowly opened the door feeling defeated. And once she opened the door fully there stood Mace. She didn’t know what to say, she was stunned. She didn’t get to plan what she was going to say to Mace once she saw him again face to face. Nari realized how much she did miss Mace seeing him like this in person. All those good memories she had with Mace started flooding back, her anger almost fully melted away. He looked different, Nari hadn’t seen him in so long, he looked much taller, his fragrance was different but familiar and..he’s gotten more handsome, but Nari didn’t let her thoughts go beyond a compliment. “I have eyes” she thought to herself. 

Mace felt a bit annoyed when Nari finally opened the door, he saw that Nari was wearing Reeds sweat shirt, his famous move that he does with all of his girlfriends. Mace broke the silence between them as they stood there staring at eachother for a little too long. 

Mace: Do you think I can come in? 

Nari: Oh! Uh, I don’t think that’s a good idea. My roommate is here. 

Mace: Are you sure that’s the only reason why? 

Nari: Of course it is. 

Mace: Well since you won’t let me in do you mind if we can go somewhere else to talk? Since, you know, your roommate is here. 

Nari felt bad, Mace had just gotten here and she was already drawing such a harsh line between them but she definitely didn’t want to make things worse between Reed and Mace and she didn’t want Reed to be upset that Mace would have been inside her home. She didn’t think that would create a pleasant image in Reeds mind. Maybe she can invite him inside to sit for a while, it’s cold outside and plus Naris roommate is here so it’s not like they are alone alone, right. 

Nari: well, because you came all this way I guess you can come inside and sit down and wait while I get dressed. It’s cold outside. 

Mace chuckled. 

Mace: I thought you said I couldn’t come in?

Nari: I said you couldn’t come in to talk not that you can’t come in to wait. 

Mace: I don’t think that makes sense. 

Nari: I’m doing you a favor as your friend. I don’t want you sitting in your car trying to get warm wasting gas, especially in this economy. Nari said jokingly.

Nari made sure to put an emphasis on the word friend because she knew what Mace wanted to talk to her about. Mace picked up on this as he wasn’t slow to pick up on social cues. However, he was still determined to say everything he wanted to say to Nari.

Mace slightly chucked at what Nari said 

Mace: I guess I should be thanking you then.

Nari: You can thank me later. Now hurry up and come inside! It’s cold. Make yourself at home, there’s hot chocolate in the living room. 

Nari rushes up the steps to get ready, trying to find something nice to wear, guilt started set in because why did she care? Just throw something on to get this conversation over with. But this doesn’t mean she has to look a mess, she’ll be out in public. Nari came to a decision that she was going to put effort in her appearance today. 

Mace sits at Naris table sipping his coffee and looking through his phone. Nearly 30 minutes passed by and Nari still wasn’t ready. What is taking her so long, he thought to himself. Could it be that she’s getting ready to look nicer for him? A smile slowly crept upon his face but he quickly dismissed it not wanting to be delusional, but Mace knew he wasn’t delusional about one thing- Nari liked him, whether it was now or in the past, she liked him and Mace wasn’t convinced that those feelings are gone now that she’s with Reed, feelings like that don’t just disappear now that you’re in a relationship. At least that was Maces opinion. Mace was looking forward to having this conversation with Nari. 

Maces thoughts got interrupted once he heard footsteps coming down the stairs. Nari stood there looking beautiful as ever. 

Nari: Come on, let’s go.

Mace felt a bit annoyed when Nari finally opened the door, he saw that Nari was wearing Reeds sweat shirt, his famous move that he does with all of his girlfriends. Mace broke the silence between them as they stood there staring at eachother for a little too long. 

Mace: Do you think I can come in? 

Nari: Oh! Uh, I don’t think that’s a good idea. My roommate is here. 

Mace: Are you sure that’s the only reason why? 

Nari: Of course it is. 

Mace: Well since you won’t let me in do you mind if we can go somewhere else to talk? Since, you know, your roommate is here. 

Nari felt bad, Mace had just gotten here and she was already drawing such a harsh line between them but she definitely didn’t want to make things worse between Reed and Mace and she didn’t want Reed to be upset that Mace would have been inside her home. She didn’t think that would create a pleasant image in Reeds mind. Maybe she can invite him inside to sit for a while, it’s cold outside and plus Naris roommate is here so it’s not like they are alone alone, right. 

Nari: well, because you came all this way I guess you can come inside and sit down and wait while I get dressed. It’s cold outside. 

Mace chuckled. 

Mace: I thought you said I couldn’t come in?

Nari: I said you couldn’t come in to talk not that you can’t come in to wait. 

Mace: I don’t think that makes sense. 

Nari: I’m doing you a favor as your friend. I don’t want you sitting in your car trying to get warm wasting gas, especially in this economy. Nari said jokingly.

Nari made sure to put an emphasis on the word friend because she knew what Mace wanted to talk to her about. Mace picked up on this as he wasn’t slow to pick up on social cues. However, he was still determined to say everything he wanted to say to Nari.

Mace slightly chucked at what Nari said 

Mace: I guess I should be thanking you then.

Nari: You can thank me later. Now hurry up and come inside! It’s cold. Make yourself at home, there’s hot chocolate in the living room. 

Nari rushes up the steps to get ready, trying to find something nice to wear, guilt started set in because why did she care? Just throw something on to get this conversation over with. But this doesn’t mean she has to look a mess, she’ll be out in public. Nari came to a decision that she was going to put effort in her appearance today. 

Mace sits at Naris table sipping his coffee and looking through his phone. Nearly 30 minutes passed by and Nari still wasn’t ready. What is taking her so long, he thought to himself. Could it be that she’s getting ready to look nicer for him? A smile slowly crept upon his face but he quickly dismissed it not wanting to be delusional, but Mace knew he wasn’t delusional about one thing- Nari liked him, whether it was now or in the past, she liked him and Mace wasn’t convinced that those feelings are gone now that she’s with Reed, feelings like that don’t just disappear now that you’re in a relationship. At least that was Maces opinion. Mace was looking forward to having this conversation with Nari. 

Maces thoughts got interrupted once he heard footsteps coming down the stairs. Nari stood there looking beautiful as ever.

I have a strange issue plaguing me from years. At Times, I pee high volume very frequently to the point i feel dehydrated.I don't drink much water during this time. I""m perplexed where does it find so much water to convert into urine. The urine is clear as water. During this time, I'm quite sensitive to some triggers such as Cold weather, dairy , coffee etc.

There are days when I go normal amount, yellow urine and I feel my best during this time. I have developed many issues such as headache, breathing issues, joint issues due to these dehydration issues.

Another interesting point is that my wife who was perfectly normal has developed same high volume urination after we started our physical relationship. Now, my son also has same issue and I'm sure it was transferred via pregnancy.

I know it is some strange virus/bacteria. But i'm unable to find which one? It just feels like i'm hypersensitive to things which I / my family shouldn't be. 

Done all the blood tests , Urinary test, kidney tests, all normal. I see that Ibuprofen temporarily provides relief . Any clues will save me and my family. I'm ready to reward anyone to anything if it leads to a cure.",1,1746849161.0,CUTI,1,1.0,False

I just wanted to share some of my concerns in the hopes that some of you can ease my fears.

1. I'm terrible with needles. Like, pass out from blood draws and can't be awake with an IV in, had to be sedated for a cavity filling, etc... I've gotta a bit better and have learned that sucking on a lollipop helps me get through blood draws without passing out most times, but still, the anxiety is high...

2. I feel my biggest weakness currently is saying ""NO"" to food ideas. Someone in the office brought in cookies or donuts, yes gimme! Wanna walk to the coffee shop on our break? Yes! Do you want fries with that? Yep. 
Will this potentially help with that? 

3. Do I have to tell people? I'm kind of ashamed that I haven't been able to lose weight on my own, like everyone says just ""eat less and move more"" but I just ...can't? I've tried and if anything I've just gained more after each time I've failed.

4. My doctor prescribed Zepbound but insurance is requiring a ""prior authorization"" so that's now in the works from my doctor but I'm wondering what the odds are of it actually being approved?

I'm 29F 5'3 and at my current and highest weight 176lbs. I know that's not terrible, but I feel unhealthy. My clothes are tighter/some things don't fit anymore. Things I love to do are harder (hiking, climbing, horseback riding) and I worry about developing serious medical conditions since I have a few in the family history...

I'm closeted in real life, but generally out online (anonymous accounts). A lot of people in the community can get a certain kind of mad at me for that, but realistically it's going to be a good 10-15 years before I can begin to transition, at a generous estimate (practical necessity dictates that).

I get by day to day as well as I can — my closeted persona is still aligned with many aspects of my personality that I wear on my sleeve, so it's not entirely uncomfortable — but there's one element that *REALLY* gets to me...

The way other women look at me. The way they default to fearing me. Because they see a ""man."" And all of the genuine horror, terror, and harrowing, chilling implications of that word. Just walking down the street, the way women immediately look away in fear if I'm passing them. The way if I'm waiting by the counter for my drink at a coffee shop, two women thinking of grabbing napkins will literally freeze in terror at the sight of me, and instead of grabbing them will stand at a distance from me as if trying not to provoke a sleeping grizzly bear. The way female clerks will avoid eye contact with me, for fear of being hit on. Because the second they look at me, they see a monster more terrible than any creature in mythology... a man.

They look at me, and see every monster they've ever feared. Scared that I'm going to hurt them. Even writing those words is strickening in a way I can't describe. Not because of anything I've done, or anything particular about me, they just simply default to fearing me. To assuming I'm going to hurt them.

And make no mistake, I fully recognize women have ever reason to be scared of men. Trust me, speaking *AS* a woman, you definitely don't have to be out of the closet to get that scared feeling when a man is walking in your direction on the sidewalk, that fear is sadly primal. It just hurts, knowing I make women feel that way. knowing what I look like — WHAT I look like — makes women who did absolutely nothing wrong feel afraid. That I cause them to experience something so negative. That I make women, a group I'm proud to belong to, feel so unsafe. That there's nothing I can do to make them realize I'm not the monster they fear, because I'm actually one of them.

But they don't see that... they don't see me.  
They just see the monster on the outside.

Like... have other trans women experienced that, when they were in the closet?? What they hell do you do with that? How do you not go insane, knowing you cause other women to feel so horrible?",2,1746848978.0,asktransgender,0,1.0,False

Bob (23M) and I go back to high school. It had literally been years since I last saw him, so I thought I'd reach out to him and meet up with him.

Bob however reached out to a mutual friend of ours, John (24M), to ask if he'd be down to hang out with us. I wasn't aware of this - my intention was to hang out with Bob only. I'm not mad at Bob or anything - just a bit irked at John.

With all respect as I can muster, I believe John could possibly have autism. Me and John also go back to high school, and technically we are closer than me and Bob.

But the issue is John takes a lot of energy when hanging out (which is ironic considering I'm an extrovert). He talks and talks, and doesn't let anyone talk. He yells when he's talking (possibly out of excitement), and he talks about super niche topics that I legitimately do not know about. He also doesn't have a filter - we were once having coffee together and talking about finding a partner, and he very crudely asked me about big I want my partner's boobs to me...and there was a waitress nearby🤦‍♂️

Keep in mind, we're all Muslims who come from conservative backgrounds. Talking about sexually explicit topics, even preferences, is heavily taboo and frowned upon. But you don't have to be Muslim to know it's bloody common sense not to talk about things like this in public. 

But in having said that, John is a good guy. He gave me a very thoughtful gift on my birthday, and he generally doesn't mean any harm. I think he is generally unaware, but I feel like I shouldn't have to point out to not say stupid things in public, or let others talk. 

I don't hang out with John very often. I've hung out with him a total of 5 times after high school, and everytime I sort of dread hanging out. So, AITAH?",2,1746848606.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

I have a strange issue plaguing me from years. At Times, I pee high volume very frequently to the point i feel dehydrated.I don't drink much water during this time. I""m perplexed where does it find so much water to convert into urine. The urine is clear as water. During this time, I'm quite sensitive to some triggers such as Cold weather, dairy , coffee etc.

There are days when I go normal amount, yellow urine and I feel my best during this time. I have developed many issues such as headache, breathing issues, joint issues due to these dehydration issues.

Another interesting point is that my wife who was perfectly normal has developed same high volume urination after we started our physical relationship. Now, my son also has same issue and I'm sure it was transferred via pregnancy.

I know it is some strange virus/bacteria. But i'm unable to find which one? It just feels like i'm hypersensitive to things which I / my family shouldn't be. 

Done all the blood tests , Urinary test, kidney tests, all normal. I see that Ibuprofen temporarily provides relief . Any clues will save me and my family. I'm ready to reward anyone to anything if it leads to a cure.",1,1746848138.0,OveractiveBladder,0,1.0,False

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, life is far more intricate than this. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are emphatically established and developed over time for a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**Also, no hesitations or doubts, please.** If you're at all interested then take the chance. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** My ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. The type of connection I want also understands, accepts, and embraces the reality that there's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests that make someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress. The type of connection I want strives to embrace these more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way.
* **Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive sensations in which such interaction, of various sorts, creates an elated state of splendor. I peak with ideation and abstraction, and seek out others who do as well.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavor.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations and thoughts. I also adore writing conversationally, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography is also something I dabble in, although not as much as I'd like. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, and coffee.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.

Today we agreed to her going to a friend’s house and coming home after with her step sister 16f. My daughter changed plans and went out to coffee with friends - without telling me or my husband. I had to text her to find out where she was. 

She could tell I was mad but then asked anyway if she could go still go out after work. It was super frustrating and I was at work, in the midst of an event, so I let her go tonight saying we’d talk tonight when she got home.  Then she was late coming home by a few minutes.

She has demonstrated real inconsistency and disregard for rules and doesn’t seem to internalize the basic expectations of our house, even with prompts and reminders. She does well in school, has a job, but life wise she’s just NOT getting it.

We did talk tonight and I expressed how mad I am that she isn’t following basic communication guidelines. She really just is acting very entitled and that has to change.  I won’t let her get her license or drive a car if she can’t follow expectations. She could take her license test as early as the end of the month.

I’m debating grounding her for the week/next weekend and/or potentially withholding her license test.  

Does that seem reasonable? I can’t imagine I’m alone in this but I’m really annoyed",4,1746847902.0,Parenting,6,1.0,False

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, life is far more intricate than this. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are emphatically established and developed over time for a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**Also, no hesitations or doubts, please.** If you're at all interested then take the chance. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** My ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. The type of connection I want also understands, accepts, and embraces the reality that there's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests that make someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress. The type of connection I want strives to embrace these more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way.
* **Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive sensations in which such interaction, of various sorts, creates an elated state of splendor. I peak with ideation and abstraction, and seek out others who do as well.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact.

I always give suggestions such as going for a walk and getting coffee and say that I’m happy to meet half way between our locations. It then comes to the day before we’re supposed to meet and they still haven’t made a decision so I always have to figure it out. It becomes so unbelievably exhausting and frustrating.

1kj0tc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1kj0tc1/hot_take_cold_brews_are_severely_underrated/,Hot take: Cold brews are severely underrated,"Especially for anaerobics and other experimental processes.

Dare I say it… I might actually prefer cold brew over my Orea V4 or V60 brews when it comes to anaerobic beans. Flash brews (Japanese iced coffee as others might call) works well for some, especially for washed, but many experimental coffees taste better with cold brew for me. 

What really sold me was an omakase experience at Koffee Mameya Kakeru in Kiyosumi-Shirakawa, Tokyo. They offered the same bean prepared three different ways — pour-over, cold brew, and milk brew. We went with a washed Colombian Gesha roasted by Homeground (Singapore). To my surprise, the cold brew was the clear winner: it brought out all the aromatic top notes with a smooth, sweet, almost silky mouthfeel. Even more impressive than the already excellent pour-over.

They kindly shared their recipe:
- Ratio: 1:15
- Steep time: 14 hours at room temperature
- Grind: Medium-coarse (a bit coarser than for pour-over)
- Most important detail: absolutely no agitation.
They told me to gently dump the coffee grounds onto the water, not the other way around, to avoid any disturbance. Then filter through your preferred paper filter.

Since then, I’ve been making cold brews with every funky or experimental coffee I get my hands on. I’ve never been a huge fan of overly funky beans — I love their aroma but often find the flavor overwhelming or astringent if the brew isn’t dialed in perfectly. Cold brew, though, nails it for me: it extracts the sweetness and aromatics without any of the harshness.

Anyone else into specialty cold brew? I feel like it doesn’t get talked about nearly enough.

I’ve been learning fast. Getting better. Honestly, 
the hardest part is choosing the coffee.

Since February, ROTATION has featured over 400+ coffees from a wide mix of brands.

This latest May Rotation was built around one goal,
getting you beans most people will never even see, let alone taste.

I’m constantly torn between two worlds. On one hand, the accessible coffees fly off the shelf. On the other, the rare stuff from international roasters is just next level, but most people hesitate. They’re afraid to pull the trigger.

Some of the most slept on beans in this drop came from Collorfull (Canada) They’re doing wild high end coferments and experimental blends that deserve way more attention.

A little while ago, I was seriously considering ghosting my entire *Vampire: The Masquerade* group. After our modern-day chronicle fell apart in a haze of Storyteller favoritism, metagaming, and one particularly infamous player character named “Lady Venus,” I was pretty much done.

But then, remember my second story? That same “Lady Venus” was the one who reached out to me, offered a sincere apology, and actually made peace with the whole group. We started a second game where she played a scrappy street Caitiff—no dominatrix quirks in sight.  
That was a really cool campaign, though a short one. But Mark, our Storyteller, was secretly cooking up something special—a *Vampire: Dark Ages* chronicle. He promised it would be dark and gothic, so I thought, *Why not? I’ll bite!*

I made a Cappadocian: Nicodemus, a grim scholar obsessed with death and the afterlife. Rose rolled a Toreador troubadour who wrote ballads about plague-stricken knights. Bruno, to no one’s surprise, made a Gangrel who was basically Wolverine—if he were flea-ridden and even angrier at the aristocracy. (""I punch nobles"" might as well have been his entire character sheet.)

And Venus?

Yeah. *That* Venus.

The one who once played a BDSM Lasombra noble so over-the-top she made me (and only me, to be fair) walk out mid-session. The one who demanded NPCs bow and brush her hair. The one who never failed a roll. The same Venus who later played a street-kid Caitiff like it was second nature?

This time, she showed up quiet. Focused. Her character? A Ventrue nun named Sister Aurelia. No titles, no servants, no drama. Just a woman who’d taken the Embrace late in life, after decades of cloistered faith, now struggling to reconcile the Word of God with the Curse of Caine.

Even Mark blinked when he saw her sheet. *“You took what feature?”* he asked, tilting his head.  
Venus just smiled. *“Thought it fit.”*

We thought it was just flavor.

The chronicle itself? Easily the best thing we’ve played in years.

Set in an isolated alpine valley, with whispers of heresy, vanishing priests, and something ancient stirring beneath the mountains. The tone was bleak—no feeding scenes, no political backstabbing. Just survival, creeping horror, and the slow realization that something had gone terribly wrong centuries ago, and we were the ones who had to fix it.

My Cappadocian, Nicodemus, initially saw Aurelia as a curiosity—someone clinging to hope in a hopeless world. But over time, that changed. He began seeking her counsel—not because she was powerful (mechanically, she wasn’t), but because she had conviction. A presence.

Venus didn’t play her big. No monologues, no grandstanding. She just *was*. She heard villagers’ confessions. She quoted scripture at bandits. She sat in silence with a dying priest, making us feel like those scenes *mattered*—all without stealing the spotlight.

It wasn’t sudden, but eventually, Nicodemus stopped protecting her because she was “just a nun” and started protecting her because he *believed* in her.  
It’s worth noting that once, when I—as Nicodemus—tried to scry her aura, Mark mentioned, *“You notice a faint silver halo around her.”* A sign of True Faith—a power that can banish vampires and sometimes perform miracles. I worried Venus might use it as a trump card, leading to special treatment again… but she never did.

And outside the game? Yeah. We started talking more—about lore, characters, ideas… then about life.  
We texted. Then called. Then met for coffee, where we’d argue about vampire lore or sit in comfortable silence. She wasn’t perfect—she’d forget her phone in random places, and her obsession with spicy food was a hazard—but those quirks made her real. I wasn’t perfect either. I’d overthink everything, second-guessing if she even liked me, until one day she grabbed my hand and said, *“Stop brooding. I’m here, aren’t I?”*

The final session hit like a brick to the chest.

We’d tracked the valley’s corruption to a half-buried monastery, infested with warped relics and whispers in languages we couldn’t understand. Rose’s Toreador had been captured and tortured. Bruno’s Gangrel was losing his mind (and his remaining hit points). Nicodemus tried—and failed—to perform a ritual ward using bones from an ossuary that may or may not have belonged to real saints.

Everything was falling apart.

And then Aurelia stepped forward.

Venus didn’t posture. Didn’t announce anything. She just said, softly, *“I walk to the altar. I kneel. And I pray.”*

Mark stared. *“You’re using… that?”*

She nodded.

One die. No modifiers. Just faith.

When it landed, Venus didn’t wait for Mark. She leaned forward, her voice barely above a whisper:

*“Light. Cold and silver, like the breath of angels. The shadows recoil. The stone cracks. The thing beneath the mountain screams—not in pain, but in memory. You don’t destroy it. You just remind it that it’s not welcome here.”*

Aurelia stood. Opened her arms. And disappeared into the light.

No treasure. No XP. Just three broken Kindred kneeling where something holy had stood—unsure if they’d been saved or judged.

After the session, we didn’t pack up right away. We ordered pizza, cracked open some beers, and talked—about the game, our characters, what it all meant. Venus and I ended up on the couch, still dissecting Aurelia’s sacrifice. Somewhere between her laughing at my terrible pizza puns and me admitting I’d Googled medieval hymns for Nicodemus, I realized I didn’t want the night to end.

Then?

A few days later, I proposed. She said yes before I even finished the question, laughing through tears. Now we’re planning a wedding, and the group’s all in. Rose is Venus’s bridesmaid, already sketching her dress and threatening to write a ballad for the reception. Mark’s my best man, sweating over his speech like it’s a final exam. Bruno’s giving a toast, and I’m begging him not to start with *“Remember when she played a BDSM vampire?”* (He will. I know he will.)

I’m in a suit shop now, feeling like an impostor. I’m a jeans-and-hoodie guy, not a tuxedo model. I’m leaning toward a charcoal suit—simple, sharp, with a green tie because Venus says it brings out my eyes. But I’m nervous. I want to look good for her—not just as Nicodemus the scholar, but as *me*—the guy who almost walked away but stayed because of her.

A month ago, I thought Venus was a red flag in human form. Now, she’s the woman who saved our coterie with a single die roll and charmed me with a smile. I can’t believe I almost ghosted her. I can’t believe she’s real. And I can’t believe I get to spend my life with her.

*Till death do us part.*

**Entry 1 – May 10, 2025**

Got dropped off at the end of the service road around eleven this morning. Crew didn’t stick around long. They helped unload supplies, gave me the usual jokes about “ghosts in the trees,” then tore off on the quad like the place was on fire.

Tower’s taller than I expected. Rusted steel, wooden steps that creak like knees, and just enough sway to make you feel like you’ve had too much to drink. Took a minute to get used to it. Sixty-seven steps to the top. Wind really kicks up when you're halfway.

Inside’s basic. One cot, one desk, one propane stove that smells faintly like mice. Escape hatch to a ladder fixed right in the middle of the floor. Windows on all sides. You can see clean across the forest for miles. Nothing but spruce, jack pine, and whatever God forgot out here. Feels like standing in the eye of something big and old.

Everything was unlocked when I got here. Strange, considering the tower’s been unmanned for the winter. No signs of animals or squatters. Nothing broken. Hell, the bed was already made. Not fresh, but tidy. Like somebody meant to come back and didn’t.

Ran the check-in with dispatch. Signal’s weak but usable. Weather’s clear. Did a scope scan out of habit: nothing out there but trees and the glint of water way out west.

I’ll be honest, it’s quiet up here, but not in the peaceful way people expect. As soon as the sun came down, there’s a tension in the air. Like the woods are holding their breath. No birds. No bugs. Just wind. And even that sounds different this high up. Less like rustling leaves and more like something *moving around you.*

Still, I’m glad to be here. Beats factory noise and small-town drama. A whole season alone to clear my head, make some money, maybe write in this thing if I get bored. They say it helps to keep a journal, but I’m sure as hell not doing some Dear Diary BS. 

If nothing else, it’ll remind me I’m still here.

Sun’s going down. Gonna make some tea, eat something from the ration box, and try to sleep. First night’s always weird.

# Entry 2 – May 11, 2025

Didn’t sleep much. Wind picked up around midnight and sent the tower groaning like an old boat. I know it’s built to move, but it still messes with your head. Feels like the whole thing’s going to tip over any second.

Around three in the morning, I woke up thinking I’d heard footsteps. Real faint, slow. Like someone circling the base of the tower in the gravel. Could’ve been an animal, sure, but I didn’t hear any sniffing or rustling. It was just this steady crunch-crunch-crunch, like a boot heel dragging.

Didn’t have the guts to shine my light out the window. Laid there in the dark, holding my breath until it stopped.

In the morning, I climbed down and took a walk around the tower. No tracks, no scat, no broken branches. Just wind and pine needles. Still, I kept feeling like I was being watched. One of those feelings that gets under your skin and doesn’t go away no matter how much you try to shake it off.

Figured a ride down the ridge might help, so I took the quad out to check the southern overlook. Gorgeous view. River’s moving slow, sky’s clear, sun hot on the back of my neck. Felt good to breathe deep for a bit.

But on the way back, I spotted something. Thought it was a moose at first with how big it was, standing just off the trail. Tall, dark. I went to turn the quad off to not spook it, but when I looked again, it wasn’t there. No sound of it moving off, no branches snapping. Just gone.

Could’ve been my eyes playing tricks. Sunlight through the trees can do that. Still… I don’t like how it made me feel. Like I’d been caught looking at something I wasn’t supposed to see.

Ran my evening weather scan. All clear. No signs of fire anywhere in the quadrant. Logged everything by the book. Didn’t mention the footsteps. Or the shape. Not sure I want that written down somewhere official just yet.

Before bed, I noticed something odd out the west-facing window. A patch of treetops looked darker than the rest. It’s like a scar or a burn trail, but too uniform. Looks like someone ran a blade through the forest. I checked the maps. No cutlines, no trails out that way.

Might hike out there in a few days once I’m settled. For now, I’m keeping the lantern on overnight. Doesn’t feel right in the dark just yet.

# Entry 3 – May 12, 2025

Fog rolled in thick this morning. Woke up to nothing but white in every direction. Couldn’t see the treetops, couldn’t see the ground. Felt like I was floating in a cloud with no bottom. It’s the type of fog that gets in your lungs and stays there.

Did my morning scan half-blind. Scope was useless. All readings came back normal, though: humidity’s up, but no storms on the radar. Called it in. Dispatch didn’t seem concerned. Said to wait it out.

Spent most of the day inside sorting supplies and cleaning gear. Tried reading, but kept getting distracted. The fog pressed against the glass like it wanted in. It *muffled* everything. No birds, no wind, not even that usual hum in the back of your head when you're out in nature. Just dead silence.

Around eleven, I spotted something out in the tree line, barely visible through the white. At first I thought it was a snag or maybe a big stump. But it was standing too straight. Too tall.

It didn’t move. I watched it for maybe five minutes. Couldn’t make out any features. Just a figure still as stone.

I waved. No reaction. I called out. Nothing.

Turned to grab my binoculars, and when I looked again, it was gone.

Didn’t hear it leave. Didn’t see it move. It just *wasn’t there anymore.*

I checked the radio to check Dispatch: not working. Full static. Figured the weather was messing with the signal, but it stayed dead for nearly an hour. Came back clear like nothing ever happened.

I didn’t bother calling it in at that point. The nerves settled. Sort of. 

Later, just before dark, I stepped out onto the catwalk to get some air. Fog had mostly lifted by then, but there was this weird pressure behind my eyes. Maybe a low-altitude headache? I looked out toward the west: same stretch where I’d seen that odd tree line yesterday, and I noticed something else:

The trees are bending.

Not from wind. There’s none. They’re leaning in toward the tower, just slightly. Like they’re listening. Or reaching.

I went back inside. Locked the door and the hatch.

I’ve done this job before. I’ve done remote. I know what too much quiet can do to a person. But three days in is too early to start going squirrelly. This doesn’t feel right.

This doesn’t feel like me imagining things.

Leaving the lantern on, and gonna try to sleep with the radio on. White noise is better than this *nothing.*

# Entry 4 – May 13, 2025

Didn’t sleep again. Not a wink. Not from the wind this time, it was dead calm all night. The kind of still that makes your ears ring.

I started dozing off around midnight when I heard it: three knocks. Clear as day. Not at the door, not on the hatch. On the wall. East side.

Tap.Tap.Tap.

Spaced out, same rhythm every time.

I nearly jumped out of my skin. Lantern was still on, thank God. Grabbed it and checked every window, one by one. Nothing. Just trees and dark.

It happened twice more. Same pattern. I didn’t look after that. Just sat in bed with my boots still on, holding the lantern like it was a weapon.

At dawn, I finally climbed down and circled the tower. Took my time. Looked for tracks, scratches, *anything.* The soil was untouched. No prints, no scat, no signs something, or *someone*, had been out there.

Except... when I walked around to the east wall, I found three small marks in the siding. About shoulder height. Clean, shallow indents. Could be weather damage, I told myself. Old damage. But they looked fresh. No rust, no wear.

Spent the afternoon trying to get my head on straight. Cleaned the weather console. Reorganized the supply bins. Even swept the damn catwalk, just to give my hands something to do.

I turned the radio on around five. Dead static again. Didn’t even get the usual hum from the dispatch line.

I kept it on anyway.

Around seven, just before sunset, I caught movement out the north window: something weaving through the trees. Not fast, but smooth. Too smooth. No crunching of underbrush, no sound at all.

I watched it for a good thirty seconds. Couldn’t get a good look. Just a dark shape, about man-sized. Tall man-sized. It was walking a line that didn’t make sense: moving uphill through thick brush like it wasn’t even there.

I waited for it to pass closer, then grabbed the binoculars. Scanned the area. Nothing. But the birds hadn’t come back. Still no bugs. No distant coyote howls. Not even the usual pop of settling trees.

It’s like something’s sucking the life out of the woods.

I know how that sounds. I know how I sound.

I didn’t write all this in the official log. What would I even say? ""Tower’s quiet. No fire risk. Trees acting weird?""

I’ll keep it in here instead. My own record. Something to hold onto if things keep getting stranger.

Lantern’s full. Boots are by the bed.

I’ll be ready tonight.

# Entry 5 – May 14, 2025

Woke up just before dawn. Didn’t mean to. I hadn’t even fallen asleep yet. Been lying in bed, boots on, eyes on the hatch and the door. Lantern ran out around four. I didn’t get up to refill it.

Something was breathing outside.

Not wind. Not an animal rooting through gear. Breathing. Slow, deep. Right against the east wall again. I could hear the wood expand with every exhale. Felt like it was leaning against the damn tower.

Didn’t move until the sun cracked the horizon. Then everything stopped, like someone flipped a switch.

I went down an hour later once I felt steady enough to walk. The air was sharp. Colder than it should’ve been, with that weird stillness again, like sound didn’t want to carry.

And that’s when I found the boot.

Sitting upright at the base of the tower, right next to the east beam.

Not mine. Not Forestry-issued. It’s old. Leather is cracked, tongue curled forward like it was panting. The laces were still tied, neat and tight. But what really got me, what froze me dead in my tracks, was that it was full of water.

Clear, still water. There’s been no rain since I’ve been here. No damp ground around it. Just a boot like someone set it there, filled it, and walked away. Except there were no footprints. No drag marks. No disturbance in the dust around it at all.

I didn’t touch it. I backed up, walked around the other side of the tower, and climbed straight back up.

Radio’s still useless. Static every time I try to call out. I even tried emergency frequencies: same result.

Pulled out the topo map this afternoon to see if there were any old trapper trails or cabin sites nearby. I don’t know what I was hoping to find. There’s nothing marked for ten kilometers in any direction. Closest sign of human life is a ranger station down the river bend, and it’s unmanned this time of year.

And yet someone, or *something*, left a boot full of water at my doorstep.

I know animals can do weird things. I know the forest has rules most people don’t understand. But this doesn’t feel natural.

The sun’s going down now. I keep thinking I’m seeing things move between the trees. Not fast, not even threatening, just pacing.

Like it’s watching. Waiting.

I finally decided to bring the boot up with me. Set it on the floor by the hatch. Maybe that’s a mistake, but I want it here. I want to look at it, study it, remind myself I’m not losing it.

It’s still full. Hasn’t spilled a drop.

# Entry 6 – May 15, 2025

Something’s wrong with the trees.

I noticed it this morning, first thing. I always start the day with a sweep through the scope: check for smoke, scan the horizon, look for anything off. And it was off.

The trees aren’t where they were yesterday.

I know how that sounds. I know forests grow, shift, change with the wind and weather. But this isn’t that. This is geometry. This is *placement.*

There’s a bend in the treeline northwest of the tower. It’s a gentle arc that wasn’t there before. I remember it clear as day because I wrote about that section two entries back. It was straight. Undisturbed. Now it’s curved, and not just randomly. It's forming a circle.

And here’s the kicker: there’s another bend due south, maybe 400 meters out. Also arcing inward. If I plot the shape on the map, they line up almost perfectly. Like something’s drawing a ring around the tower.

And it’s closing in.

I marked the edge with my compass and GPS this afternoon. I’ll check it again tomorrow. If it’s moved again...

Well. We’ll see.

Other weirdness: radio still isn’t working. I tried switching to scan mode just to pick up *anything*. What I got was... noise. But not static.

It sounded like breathing. The same slow, heavy rhythm I heard the other night. It went on for about thirty seconds before cutting out mid-inhale.

I haven’t turned it back on since.

Took the boot back down to where I found it. Figured maybe putting it back might stop whatever this is from getting worse? I left it on the ground, right where it had been.

Went back up. Made coffee. Tried to pretend the day was normal.

And then, just before sunset, I heard a voice.

On the roof.

Clear as if someone was crouched right above me, speaking through the boards:

“*Let me in.*”

Low. Calm. Female. Not threatening. But *wrong.* Too steady. No emotion in it. No breath behind it. Like it had been recorded a hundred years ago and left to rot on a warped tape.

I dropped to the floor and didn’t move. I didn’t answer. I sat on the floor with my hands over my ears until it stopped.

I checked the roof later. Climbed the side ladder with my flashlight and a tire iron. Nothing up there. Nothing damaged. But there was a smell: like a wet mildew with smoke.

Like something burned here a long time ago.

Whatever’s out there, it’s getting bolder. And closer.

I should be scared. I *am* scared.

But more than that, I’m starting to feel like I’m part of something now. Like the tower was never empty. Like it’s *always* had someone watching.

Maybe I was just the next one to take my turn.

# Entry 7 – May 16, 2025

It came up the ladder last night.

Just after one in the morning, the whole tower groaned like something heavy had grabbed hold of it. I sat up in bed, still dressed, boots on, flashlight in one hand, hatchet in the other.

Then I heard it.

The ladder.

One rung at a time. Slow. Deliberate. Not like someone climbing to save themselves, or even to sneak. This was patient. Calm.

I turned off the lantern and crouched by the hatch. Waited.

Rung.Rung.Rung.

It stopped just beneath the hatch.

Didn’t knock. Didn’t speak. Just waited there.

I swear I could feel heat coming through the floorboards. Damp, sour heat, like wet clothes left too long in a sealed bag.

I wanted to scream. Or move. Or *do* something. But I just froze. One hand on the hatch lock, the other on the hatchet, waiting for the next sound.

Nothing came.

After maybe ten minutes (could’ve been longer) I finally flung the hatch open and shined the light down.

Empty.

But the ladder was swaying like someone had just stepped off it.

And on the top rung, smeared across the metal, was a single handprint.

Not bloody. Not dirty. Just *wet.*

I scrubbed it off with my shirt and locked the hatch again. Didn’t go back to bed.

I stayed up watching the trees.

And here’s the part I can’t explain: at sunrise, I looked out and realized the shadow line in the trees had moved again. The ring I mapped out yesterday *is* closer. At least fifty meters tighter.

I put it on paper. Measured it. Traced it. It’s real. It’s *closing.*

I tried the radio again. Still just static. But right in the middle of it, a voice cut through:

“*Not yours.*”

No call sign. No repeat. Just those two words, clear and cold, and then back to static.

I checked every frequency I had. Nothing else came through.

I’ve been watching the woods ever since. Every flicker of movement. Every patch of shadow. Something’s out there, and it’s not hiding anymore.

I don’t know what it wants. But it knows *I’m here.*

And now it knows I know.

# Entry 8 – May 17, 2025

Found something today.

Didn’t go looking for it. I was cleaning, just trying to do something with my hands, something normal. Scrubbing the desk, wiping the dust off the windowsills, oiling the hinges on the damn hatch.

That’s when I noticed the loose board under the bed.

I don’t know how I hadn’t seen it before. It’s just one slat, right near the foot. Barely raised, just enough to catch a nail tip on my sock.

I pried it up with the back of my hatchet. Underneath, tucked inside a hollowed-out groove in the floor, was a notebook. Real old: canvas-bound, water-stained, stiff with mildew.

The first page just said:

**“D. Carter, Watch Season 1998.”**

And beneath that, written in shaky pencil:

**“If you’re reading this, you’re not alone. Shut the hatch.”**

The rest of the pages were torn out. Not missing, *torn.* Sloppy, like someone did it in a panic. The kind of rip you make when you’re not trying to save the binding.

All that was left was a final scrap tucked into the back cover.

One sentence.

**“The ring closes by the 20th.”**

That’s three days from now.

I don’t know who D. Carter was. Checked the old staffing lists before I came out here. Nobody by that name listed in ’98. And even if there was, what happened to them? Why no record? Why bury a journal in the floor instead of turning it in at season’s end?

Unless they *didn’t make it out.*

That would explain the handprint. The voice. The circle in the trees.

Maybe it *wants* someone here. Needs them. Maybe that’s the deal: someone in the tower, watching, listening, feeding it. And if you try to leave...

God.

I checked the ladder this afternoon. Every single rung is damp. Not wet. *Damp.* Like breath passed over them in the night.

And the boot? I brought it back up yesterday. Just couldn’t leave it down there. It’s dry now. Completely dry. But there’s something inside.

A piece of paper.

Folded small, stuffed in the toe like a secret. I didn’t notice it before. Opened it up and read one line:

**“I thought I was the last.”**

# Entry 9 – May 18, 2025

Tried to hike out today.

I packed a bag. Just the essentials. Radio, map, compass, water, the small axe, the damn boot. Left the tower just after first light. I figured if I could make it to the ridge, maybe get a signal, maybe see something that made sense, I could come back with a plan.

I kept my eyes down, stuck to my bearings. Compass needle stayed true. Sun stayed over my right shoulder like it should. It all felt *right.*

Until I stopped to rest.

Took a sip of water, checked the map, sat on a fallen log.

And there it was.

The tower.

Right through the trees, maybe forty feet away. Same crooked steel frame. Same faded red hatch door swinging slightly in the breeze.

I hadn’t turned. I hadn’t doubled back.

I walked two hours due south and ended up north of where I started.

I checked the GPS. Said I hadn’t moved at all. Just a blinking dot in the center of nothing.

I screamed into the forest. Threw the compass as hard as I could. I don’t know what I expected. Maybe to hear something answer back.

I waited. Ten minutes. Maybe longer. Nothing moved.

Except the trees.

I *swear* they were straighter when I started this morning. Now they’re bending inward. Just slightly. Like ribs tightening around a lung.

I came back to the tower because I didn’t know what else to do. That was four hours ago. Since then, the wind hasn’t picked up. The shadows haven’t shifted.

And the sun hasn’t moved.

I’ve been watching it. Same spot in the sky since I got back. Not rising, not setting. Just hanging there. Bright. Pale. *Wrong.*

I turned the radio on in desperation. Nothing but static.

But this time, I waited. Sat with it for almost an hour. And finally, at 3:17 p.m., if that even means anything anymore, I heard something.

Breathing. 

Then a voice. Not mine. Not Dispatch. A man’s voice. Tired.

It said,

**“Still watching?”**

Then silence.

I don’t think I’m alone up here anymore. Haven’t been for a while. Maybe not since the first night.

And the boot? The note inside? There was writing on the *back* of it too. I hadn’t unfolded it all the way until now.

**“Don’t leave. That’s how it finds you.”**

I think I stayed too long.

I think I left too late.

I don’t think this is a watch post anymore.

It’s a trap.

# Entry 10 – May 19, 2025

Time isn’t moving right anymore.

The watch on my wrist says 7:42 a.m.

The light outside says mid-afternoon.

The temperature says nightfall.

I slept, I think. Or blacked out. I remember lying down, lantern lit, watching the glow dance across the ceiling, and then I was standing at the hatch, hand on the handle, staring down into the dark.

I don’t remember getting up. I don’t remember unlocking it.

I locked it again. With both latches this time. Jammed the fire axe through the brackets.

Whatever’s out there wants me to *open it.*

Not to leave. To let it in.

There’s something scratching at the walls now. Not like an animal. Like fingers dragging across wood. It circles the tower twice a day, morning and night. Always the same path. Always the same rhythm.

Like it’s pacing.

I left a trail camera at the base yesterday. I wanted proof. I needed to see it.

This morning, I pulled the SD card and loaded it up. Only one file. Just thirty seconds.

A still image. Not a video. Just one frame.

Me.

Standing at the base of the tower. Looking up.

Except I haven’t left the tower since I set up the cam. I know that. I *know* that.

And in the image, whoever it is, whatever it is, it’s wearing my jacket. My boots. Same tear on the left knee. Same scab on the hand.

But the face is blurred. Smeared, like someone dragged their thumb across a wet photo.

I’ve turned the camera off. Don’t want to know what it might show next.

I’ve been flipping through the notebook from the floorboard again. The one from Carter. Still no sign of the missing pages. But there’s something I didn’t notice before, something faint.

Impressions in the paper. Like someone wrote with a heavy hand, and it pressed through.

I took a pencil and started rubbing the side over the blank page.

Words appeared.

**“It wears your shape when it’s close.”**

I dropped the pencil. Sat on the floor for a long time. Didn’t write. Didn’t move.

I thought I was here to watch for fire. That was the job. Be a pair of eyes. Be still. Be present.

But maybe that’s what it *needed.* Eyes. Presence. A mind to feed from.

And now it has one.

I looked out the window just now. Just for a second.

Something is standing in the trees.

Not hiding. Not moving.

Just *waiting.*

I’m not going to the hatch tonight.

If it wants me, it’ll have to come through the walls.

I think it will.

# Entry 11 – May 21, 2025

I lost a day.

Woke up on the floor. Lantern still burning. Boots on. Shirt damp with sweat. The radio was on, whispering something low and constant. It’s too quiet to understand, but too steady to be random.

I checked the calendar. It's the 21st. I swear the last time I wrote anything, it was the 19th. The pages between are blank.

Except for one.

There’s an entry I don’t remember writing. No date. Just scrawled in the same pen I always use, but the handwriting’s off, letters too tall, slanted backward. Like a child learning cursive.

It says:

**“Now she sees it.”**

That’s all.

The back of the page is torn. Not cut. Torn with fingernails. I checked my hands. There’s dried blood under the right thumbnail.

The tower is... different.

The windows are fogging up even when it’s dry outside. There’s condensation on the inside of the glass, and when I wipe it away, I swear I can see things in the reflection that aren’t in the room. Shapes standing behind me. Standing *too close.*

I don’t turn around anymore. I just close my eyes and wait for the feeling to pass.

The hatch rattled last night, hard enough to make the lantern flicker. It wasn’t wind. The air was still. It shook like something *wanted in,* and not for the first time.

This afternoon, I heard a voice through the floor. A whisper coming up from the beams:

**“You’re almost hollow.”**

I screamed. I screamed until my throat felt like sandpaper. No one answered. Not even the trees.

And here’s the part that scares me more than anything:

I looked out the north window and saw smoke.

Thin. Rising. Maybe a half-click out. Not thick enough to be a wildfire, but just enough to mean someone *lit something.*

I radioed it in, even though I knew no one would answer. I logged it in the official book. I marked it on the map.

And when I looked again…

No smoke. No trace.

Just the dark, bending trees.

I think it’s testing me now. Seeing how far it can stretch things before I break.

Or maybe I already have.

There’s something carved into the desk. I didn’t see it until just now. Dug deep into the wood.

It says:

**“She’s still up there.”**

I don’t know who wrote it.

I don’t know if it’s about me.

I don’t know if it *was* me.

# Entry 12 – May 22 (?), 2025

I think I’m still me.

I’m writing with my hand. The pen feels real. The desk is here. The pages smell like mold and pine sap and smoke. I think that means I’m still me.

But something’s wrong with the light.

It’s been dusk for hours. The sun won’t rise. Won’t set. Just hangs there, pale and dull like a cataract in the sky. Time’s stopped ticking in the usual way. I eat when I remember. I sleep when the tower lets me.

The boot is gone. I didn’t move it. Just woke up this morning and the corner where I’d set it was empty.

But in its place was a shirt.

Folded.

My shirt. And it smells like the river. Like rot and algae and old wood.

Something’s *in* the tower now. Not outside. Not circling. *Inside.*

It’s in the gaps between the boards.

In the sway of the frame.

In the pages I don’t remember writing.

The journal has new entries in it now. Ones I didn’t make. Full pages. Tight handwriting, different from mine. Old ink, dried and flaking. Some of the names are familiar. Some aren’t.

Some have dates from *next year.*

One says:

**""Hawthorne watched until she was empty.""**

That’s me. That’s my name.

I said it out loud to make sure.

**“Hawthorne.”**

But it didn’t sound right.

I tried again. Louder.

**“Hawthorne.”**

And something in the walls whispered it back.

Not mockingly. Just... confirming.

Like it was *trying it on.*

The forest is so close now. I measured again. The ring of bent trees is only ten meters out. The tops are starting to lean in like they’re listening through the windows.

I don’t remember what my voice used to sound like. Or what day it is.

But I’m still writing. I have to. That’s the rule, isn’t it? The job. Watch the trees. Report the strange. Don’t stop logging.

Never stop logging.

Because if you stop…If you stop, it notices.

I don’t think I’m writing for myself anymore.

I think I’m writing *so it doesn’t forget what a person sounds like.*

If someone finds this, if you’re reading this…You’re too late.

You’re already at the base of the tower.

Aren’t you?

1kj0mqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1kj0mqj/new_mokapot_user_advice/,"New MokaPot User, Advice?","I have always been a coffee nerd but I'm a broke coffee nerd so all I've had my whole life are drip coffee machines and K-Cup machines.  
I recently was gifted a 6-Cup Moka Pot by Java&Co and although I've had a pretty great introduction to it, I worry I may not be doing everything 100% correctly.

To start, I bought President's Choice brand Espresso Grind (labeled as Perfetto 6/10, i think thats roast darkness). I read that the ideal grind level is somewhere between regular drip coffee and espresso but I don't own a conical burr grinder so I was limited on my options. The grind level seems to be working fine.

I have an induction stovetop so after testing once at 5, once at 3, once at 10 and then again at 8, I seem to prefer the flavor on 8. Not too bitter.

I take typical paper drip filters and cut/rip them to the right sizes then wet them a bit to place them alongside the built in metal filters. I find this helps reduce/eliminate grinds getting into the coffee chamber.

The last thing I wanted to mention is that I've always struggled with Caffeine calculations but from what I've read, a typical 6-cup moka pot would have around 500mg of caffeine per brew session. Is this accurate?   
And if it is accurate, how safe is it to consume that daily?  
I tend to not feel the effects of a cup of regular coffee but I literally now drink 1 cup of Moka coffee a day.  
I don't really care about the FDA regulations, I wanna know more about what you guys typically consume in a day for comparisons sake.

Sorry for the long post, thanks if you've read this far!!

There’s a fun irony in Deborah Vance complaining about getting a made-up award on this week’s episode of Hacks (8 May) when just one day earlier on 7 May, [Jean Smart received one of those made-up awards herself (Variety’s Mary Tyler Moore Visionary Award).](https://variety.com/2025/tv/features/jean-smart-hacks-fargo-1236383444/)

Ava personally bringing cupcakes and balloons (presumably paid for out of her own pocket) continues the trend of her trying to be the cool nice boss and a friend from previous episodes like S4E2 when she gets a pour-over coffee machine for the office, S4E3 when she wants to make the Vegas trip fun and S4E4 when she organises drinks after the first Late Night show and offers to pay for the whole thing.

Deborah vindictively popping every balloon with her hairpin is so funny, and the show cheats the sequence a little by having a fair chunk of the popping happening off screen through sound effects as the camera focuses on Ava instead presumably so they wouldn’t actually have to film Jean Smart actually popping balloons on every take.

Deborah saying Ava can’t be the friend of the writers not because she’s their boss but because she’s annoying was a burn that got a good chuckle from me.

Ava learning that Ruby is the replacement guest and instantly panicking and trying to play it cool is a nice bit of comedy from Hannah Einbinder, nervous/dorky Ava is a personal favourite mode of mine, will have more to say later but this episode is easily Einbinder’s strongest work of the season (and she isn’t even in a decent chunk of it) and a great showcase of her talent.

Functionally the scene between Damien and Deborah exists only so that it sets up that Deborah will be alone at home for the rest of the episode so that what happens later on can happen without any complaints about plotholes, Still though nice that we get a continuation of the bear piss/coyote storyline first seen in S4E2 which to be honest I thought was just going to be a one episode thing. It does also seem like their night out in S4E4 has maybe made Damien slightly more comfortable with Deborah, or at least he doesn’t seem as outwardly uptight/nervous as he was before when around her.

Always nice to see Kaitlin Olson pop back up in the show as DJ, and her interaction with Deborah here where she asks for Josefina to be at the birth instead of Deborah is a good reminder of how their relationship has progressed since S3E3 when she makes the breakthrough realisation that Deborah is addicted to laughs and so doesn’t take it personally anymore that she always gets slighted in favour of her career, and is no longer as needy for Deborah’s affection. Season 1 DJ would have been begging and doing anything for Deborah to attend the birth of her child.

Smart also does a good job here of showing how this new relationship DJ has with Deborah does somewhat hurt her a bit and that not being so needed anymore does slightly sting.

And again part of the function of this scene storywise is to account for Josefina’s absence so that what happens later on with the dogs can happen without any plotholes.

The cut from Ava going into the store for her makeover and then her popping her head into Ruby’s greenroom is a solid bit of editing comedy. And much like the yellow dress from S3E1, the makeup team does a good job of balancing the look of Ava’s makeup between being good enough to be plausible that she would be happy with it and then being the right amount of not great/not tasteful for the comedy to work.

As mentioned, awkward/dorky Ava is super enjoyable to me and Einbinder nails it here with every aspect from the delivery and physicality of the “Where’s my hug” line to her trying to do a cool lean on the iPad and then ripping it off the wall, to her delivery of lines like “SUPER bi” and “the trenches (emphasis added)”. Also her cool sign off to Ruby, then turning in the hallway and immediately having her face fall as she replays their interaction in her head is sadly so painfully relatable.

Ava also continues to try and flex her being in a throuple to people he’s hoping to impress, like she did with her ex-colleagues and writer friends from On The Contrary back in S4E5

Ava mentions running into Fabriziana who is Ruby’s personal assistant first mentioned and seen all the way back in S1E3.

Love the little bit of Deborah doing a quick double-take at Ava’s new make-over look, and then Ava looking in the mirror as a result of that and being slightly miffed at how the look turned out.

Nate continues to be the riff killer in the writer’s room with his joke pitch on Deborah being weird about food.

Ava going from calm boss with “ I get it, it’s just not funny” to then instantly going unhinged and screaming “WHAT ELSE?!” is again fun stuff from Einbinder and a nice tee-up for what’s to come in the episode.

Ava personally running from the studio to the writer’s room, typing up and then printing the jokes herself before sprinting all the way back to the studio is just another example of her going above and beyond as head writer. And I don’t know much about how Hollywood works but this doesn’t seem like the kind of thing that a head writer would be doing. I don’t think this has been mentioned before but Ava very much has big personal assistant/ PA energy which according to the showrunners is what Einbinder herself has, so to me Ava’s characterisation seems like a fun way to blend character with actor. 

Regarding their argument in this scene I do think Deborah is very much in the right when she says that printing jokes out isn’t really the kind of task that Ava should be doing as head writer on Late Night, while Ava is right that it’s getting harder for her to judge what jokes Deborah would approve when her comedic is voice is being eroded by playing to the lowest common denominator with “wine o’clock jokes”. 

Deborah prodding Ruby to talk about Ava’s proposal misunderstanding back in S3E2 and embarrassing her on national television is such a low blow and so humiliating for Ava, who we see being gradually crushed and devastated as Ruby continues talking about the story. But it’s also a sign of just how close they were back in S3 when Ava felt comfortable enough to share such an embarrassing story with Deborah in confidence as a friend. Also side note, Ruby being surprised that Deborah knows this story kind of shows just how much she still underestimates the closeness that Deborah and Ava have.

Seems like Dance Mom was popular enough to be a recurring segment on Late Night now, Julianne Nicholson has said that [she’s on this season for three episodes](https://youtu.be/53Pi0lOmmfI?si=yCZpHbOjoql34IS6), so she’ll probably show up sooner rather than later in the rest of the season.

I think after last week’s episode Hannah Einbinder accidentally put a bts photo of a deleted scene from this episode that got cut on her Instagram story, where Ava cried her make-up off after the show, which presumably was set after this scene when she walks away from Ruby after the show’s over to be on her own

This scene between Ava, Dev and Emily is in the vein of the dynamic that we got a bit of within the sex scene from last week in S4E5 where it’s a more physical thing for Ava while Dev and Emily are the only ones who are actually intimate with each other

Ava becoming recently allergic to shrimp keeps getting brought up, first in S4E3, then in S4E4 and now also in this episode. I guess they’re breaking the rule of three with it happening again this episode, but wonder what it’s all building to if anything.

Emily saying that Ava isn’t over her last relationship is so true, and Ava’s reaction and instantly defensive posture to this comment shows that she knows it’s true too

Ava getting dumped by Emily and Dev/ being closed out of the circle just continues to pile on to the extraordinarily shitty night/week/time she’s been having since getting the Late Night job.

Deborah doing those frankly silly bits for social media promo like the Frito tossing and wishing happy birthday is I think a way of showing just how much Late Night has changed from pas and present and also probably yet another way the actual reality of the job is different from the imagination of what the experience is supposed to be.

So to recap all tha Ava has had to deal with just between last night and today: had the desk bit that she pitched cut completely from the show, humiliated with an embarrassing story from her ex on national television, dumped from the throuple that she was bragging about to basically everyone, insulted and belittled by Deborah, having to come up with a new sketch with the writer’s room through lunch, realising she screwed up and forgot to write affiliate copy and having to deal with a technologically inept mum who’s been hacked. With all of this on her, and then her realising she’s not in the group chat with the other writers despite how hard she’s tried to be friendly and the Mrs Table stuff to come, not to mention everything else from the start of the season to now, it makes complete sense why Ava would be at and then goes past her breaking point.

The writer Rose who gets the tooth gem is played by Hannah Einbinder’s real-life friend Sandy Honig, who also directed Einbinder in her comedy special. Also with regards to how the writers are written if it wasn’t clear enough already they are very much meant to just be flat comedy characters with a singular defining comedy aspect: Nate is the riff killer, Rose is the entitled millenial etc. I know people are disappointed that they aren’t fleshed out characters who add more to the show but I personally think it’s an acceptable trade off in favour of keeping the show focused on Deborah/Ava instead of taking the time to develop what would frankly likely only be temporary guest characters for the season.

Merrill Markoe very matter-of-factly saying that they get lobster rolls for the table, and then later saying correcting the price of the branzino as $72 and not $48, and not caring at all about Ava’s reaction tracks entirely with her statement back in S4E4 that she views the show as a cushy consulting producer gig and nothing more.

Ava’s big freakout and breakdown here is both so well done having been built up to since the start of the season and in this episode, and is also just so much fun to watch and an absolute acting highlight for Hannah Einbinder. I’m honestly not going to be able to do her physicality and delivery of her breakdown (like when she has her voice go up incredulously/furiously when shouting “rolls” and “branzino”) justice here so just do yourself a favour and go back to rewatch the scene again. Just pure comic genius from top to bottom. And then her screaming at the top of her lungs and driving through the gate arm with her car is just the cherry on top.

Deborah being actually concerned after hearing that Ava has had a breakdown and gone awol, and later seeing her face fall when she sees that the writer played by Matt Oberg (who’s apparently credited as Brian Pile) is the replacement writer in the studio for Ava, is a much-needed reminder after all the meanness throughout this season and especially this episode that at the end of the day she does still want Ava to be on the show and in the audience as the one person she’s doing the show for.

Deborah discovers the picture of her that Ava stole from the comedy club that they visited together to test out the new comedy set that they wrote together back in S1E8. The fact that Ava still keeps Deborah’s picture in her drawer despite everything that’s happened since the end of S3 and throughout this season really shows that ultimately despite everything Deborah still means a lot to her.

A lovely and meaningful guest role for Rosie O’Donnell in this episode just like Carol Burnett back in S4E4, really like how the writers lean on O’Donnell’s real life history as a successful talk show host who’s been in a similar position to Deborah, and is clearly a good friend who she would be willing to listen to. O’Donnell’s line about some days wanting to pull her hair out and other days having a blast laughing with her favourite people feels very much like the writers reflecting their real life experience writing this show and their previous projects.

Deborah says that the reason for her success and her getting good at this late stage of her career is that she “found her voice” which comes into play in a big way at the end of the episode.

It’s a small editing moment but the cut from Deborah going to accept her award to the sound of off-screen applause and then her coming back to a resoundingly empty home is a neat way to indicate just how isolated she really is.

The long shot following Deborah through her house as she calls out for Barry coupled with the gradually building music is a really neat and effective way of building tension, and showing the coyote attack on the CCTV is both a neat way to cheat the stunt/sequence while also emphasising that there really is no one else there but Deborah.

My interpretation of this scene is that it’s meant to be a clear parallel to Deborah’s situation with Ava, just like how Deborah was complacent and negligent in regarding the safety of her dogs, causing one of them to get attacked and for her to suffer the consequences, so too was she neglectful and even outright cruel to Ava causing her to eventually snap, and serves as a stark reminder to Deborah that there ultimately can and will be serious consequences to her actions.

The picture of Ava that Deborah shows is really quite cute, and a nice reference to back when their relationship was good that they presumably sent those kinds of pictures to each other. I guess it might also just be Ava’s social media picture which is available for everyone to see but given Deborah’s technological ineptitude I do lean towards the picture being something that Ava sent her rather than something she found herself. It’s not as sentimental/romantic as Ava having Deborah’s picture in her drawer but I guess this plus Deborah having Find My iPhone for Ava is at least better than nothing.

Ava not being able to swim was established back in S2E4, the cruise episode, and Deborah then starts teaching Ava how to swim/float in the pool at the end of S2E5.

Deborah diving into the ocean to save Ava who she thinks is suicidal and trying to drown herself is honestly just the slightest bit fan-fictiony, glad that the writers did have enough restraint to not actually let that be the case. Between this scene and Ava’s line later about “your lips are blue” I can see the episode spawning many fan fics if it hasn’t already begun doing so. Also I guess it can be seen as a callback to S4E2 when Deborah very cavalierly and bluntly tells Ava to kill herself, and in this moment to Deborah she’s seeing this worst case scenario come to life.

“I’m not suicidal, I just want to die” is such a real line to be honest

Ava saying that she would kill herself by “wear[ing] a suicide vest on""Watch What Happens Live.""” is a deep cut callback to S1E1 where she says the exact same thing to Jimmy.

Deborah having a gay fan at the restaurant by the beach continues the established tradition of her being popular among the community as seen in S4E4, S3E8 and as mentioned in S2E4.

Ava makes the good observation that it’s not just the gesture of Deborah running into the ocean to save her that’s meaningful but also that she ruined her second-favourite fur as well, which is another marker of just how big of a gesture it is given that Deborah is very much a materialistic person.

This scene between Deborah and Ava at the end is easily a season high point, just such beautiful work from both Jean Smart and Hannah Einbinder, as well as in the writing itself. The way Einbinder plays Ava weakly trying to be self-deprecating and her resigned defeat just feels so real, and is quietly devastating when you compare current Ava with the Ava in S3E9 who fought tooth and nail for the job, it really hammers home just how worn down and burnt out she has become.

I really like how it feels like both characters are approaching this conversation with genuine truth, at this moment I do feel that Ava has no regrets about leaving the job given how horrible it’s been, while Deborah does feel like she’s giving genuine advice when she says that she thinks Ava will regret leaving, and that it’s not merely her trying to guilt or manipulate Ava into coming back.

The way Ava starts and catches her voice as she pleads with Deborah to “Don't say that. Please don't say that. Because when you say that, I want to believe you. But you always let me down” is so devastating and made me choke up on rewatch, just brilliant work from Einbinder. Smart is also similarly impressive playing Deborah’s devastation hearing this and her earnestness/sincerity when convincing Ava to come back.

Ava repeats her criticism from earlier in the episode that she doesn’t really know Deborah’s voice anymore, and Deborah’s conversation with Rosie O’Donnell about finding her voice comes back around when she says the wonderfully romantic line that Ava IS her voice. The following wordless beat where we just see all the emotions flood on Ava’s face as she processes Deborah’s praise for her is also just superb work from Eibinder.

It is very nice to see Deborah finally acknowledging Ava’s role in her success after S4E2 where she rails against the New York Times and their reporting which she feels gives “That ginger Judas … credit for my entire career.”

Deborah’s self-deprecating line that “lots of people” hate her is a neat parallel to S1E8 (the episode where they go to the comedy club to test the new material they wrote) where Ava makes a similar joke that “Plenty of people can still hate you.”

Within this heart to heart Deborah and Ava also finally make a breakthrough regarding work, with Ava saying that she just can’t do the mass-appeal comedy that the network wants, while Deborah admits her mistake in attempting to pander to these millions (which is perhaps also slightly motivated by her disgust towards all the social media stuff that we see her do in this episode to appeal to said millions)

“I haven’t had fun in a long time” is delivered with such beautiful sadness/resigned energy by Hannah Einbinder, and Jean Smart’s delivery of “Me either” followed by her shivering so deeply is even more devastating

The scene ends with Ava poking fun at Stacey as an olive branch with Deborah, with the two of them bonding again over their humour and a shared dislike of a common enemy. I mentioned in my post on the previous episode that I did feel Stacy as a character was starting to slightly overstay her welcome, and I guess looking at it from a writing perspective with this scene in mind she is partly designed to feel exactly this way, so that Deborah and Ava then have someone to bond over and unite against.

Ava still keeping the bottle of Krug that she bought back towards the end of S3E9, together with her still keeping Deborah’s photo from the comedy club in S1E8, is a nice way to use props to show just how much more invested she is in this relationship compared to Deborah. Deborah having a picture of Ava pulled up on her phone and Find My iPhone enabled for her is in my opinion nowhere close in my opinion, and I think Deborah having a pair of Ava’s underwear on hand to use for the prank/sabotage attempt back in S4E1 is most likely  a reflection on Ava being a slob rather than Deborah being sentimental.

Deborah and Ava finally sharing the bottle of Krug has been a long-time coming, and is a great payoff to S3E5 (the woods episode) where Deborah says that she feels lonely at times when she has no one to share a bottle of Krug with, and is a nice way to symbolise that for now at least they are no longer feuding with each other and are somewhat back together

I do think there is some symbolism in the fact that as a result of their feud Ava doesn’t open the Krug and it’s turned from top-shelf into something bad by the time they reconcile and open it together, just making an educated guess here but I fear it might be reflective of the direction their relationship could take past this episode. The Krug has been drunk and they’re back together but it’s just not the same anymore.

As you can probably tell from how much I’ve written (3650 words and counting, definitely spent way too much time on this but whatever it’s worth it), this is very much my favourite episode of S4 so far. Just brilliance on every level, a great and meaningful celebrity cameo in Rosie O’Donnell which actually drives the story forward and is on a different level compared to last week’s cameos with Jimmy Kimmel and Kristen Bell, and an episode which build satisfyingly on what has come before on both a season and show/series level as only the best television can with the culmination of Ava’s breakdown arc and so many meaningful and satisfying references to previous episodes and seasons. Jean Smart is excellent as always and it’s wonderful to be reminded of Deborah’s human side after she’s generally been the boss/enemy from hell for most of the season.

But this episode is very much an acting showcase for Hannah Einbinder, who absolutely crushes the rich material she’s been given from writer Carolyn Lipka, whose previous writing credit for Hacks was the similarly excellent S3E5 One Day (the woods episode). Einbinder is simply brilliant and gets to do so much of what she’s great at but on an even higher level, from awkward/dorky/desperate to impress Ava who in my opinion is always hilarious, to the devastatingly tired and heartbroken Ava we see at the end of the episode. And to top it all off she totally crushes Ava’s freakout/meltdown scene and turns it into pure comedy gold, simply a tour de force from her. I’m quietly confident that she’ll somehow turn in even more impressive work in the rest of the season and the finale, as has traditionally been the case in past seasons, but if this episode isn’t enough for her to win Comedy Supporting Actress at the Emmys this year, I don’t know what will.

I think I’ll stop predicting future episodes since I’m very bad at it (genuinely thought the ending of S4E4 marked an end to their feud) but I do think this is very much a turning point for the season and Deborah and Ava’s relationship. Both of them but especially Ava have hit their respective rock bottoms and have consequently seen the light and taken steps towards repairing their relationship. I do think the Krug symbolism makes a somewhat compelling the case that it won’t just suddenly be smooth sailing from next episode onwards, and I’ve seen some comments online which do make sense that Deborah is in her “love-bombing to reconcile” stage of the relationship and that Ava ultimately going back to and accepting Deborah is very much reminiscent of the cycle of a toxic relationship. Whatever happens next though I am very much looking forward to whatever this writing and showrunning team cooks up, this episode has very much reinvigorated my love and passion for the show (as evidenced by all this writing lol 4145 words and counting) after last week’s episode slightly dimmed my love for it.

Very much eagerly anticipating the next episode of the show and the remaining part of the season, hats off to everyone in the cast and crew, to Jean Smart, Hannah Einbinder, writer Carolyn Lipka and director Paul W Downs for an amazing episode of television!",6,1746846228.0,hackshbomax,1,0.8,False

**Part 1**

  Six months, that's what my little business disagreement had earned me at county. Add another six for a minor dispute in the shower and still another for slugging the screw that had interceded, and I'd worked myself up to a year and a half. I'd done the whole bit. You'd think I'd have learned my lesson.

  I'd been back in town a couple of days. I was having a drink in the type of dive where you can remain anonymous, alone, and apart from world affairs. It was shabby and just down the street from my cut-rate hotel. The drinks weren't watered, and it had enough dark corners to allow for a comfortable assignation if the need arose. It smelled of beer, antiseptic, and desperation. All very comforting in my present frame of mind.

  The bar was busier than it had been the night before. There was a new face at the far corner of the bar staring into his beer while taking an occasional sip of his double whiskey. He seemed harmless enough, just another barfly musing about what might have been while avoiding any responsibility for what had been. There was a couple trading spit in one of the corners.

  Midweek rush, Wednesday Happy Hour. Humpday celebration. Whatever.

  Then she walked in. The moment she entered the bar, you just had to ask what the hell is she doing here. She wore a tight dark blue or black dress that showed that she was staying just ahead of her battle with middle-aged spread. She was attractive for a slightly older woman, her auburn hair was mid-length cut, her face was slender, and her eyes slightly bright, and if one looked close enough, they'd have noticed one was greenish, the other shocking blue. Her skin had just started to show the damage of a half-pack-a-day habit. Despite her slightly worn countenance, she was still far too classy for such a dive.

  She sidled up next to me and told the bartender to set up a Cosmo. She smelled of smokes, Chanel, and lipstick. I could feel her heat.

  ""Hello, stranger.""

  ""Anne honey, we have to stop meeting like this.""

   I got up with our drinks and made a beeline to one of the aforementioned corners. She Bacalled her way over. The couple in their corner gave us a knowing look as we sat down.

  ""How long have you been out? You look a bit wan,"" she asked, staring intensely at my eyes.

  ""Cut it, will you? You know where I've been and for how long. You had me watched while I was in."" I said hunching over my beer.

  ""Watched no, looked out for? yeah, that I did. How else would I know where you've been spending your evenings?""

  ""I often wondered what I'd do if I met up with you again.""

  ""And your decision?""

  ""Depends."" Shrugging.

  ""Depends on what?""

  ""Depends on whether or not you have something going that will make my stay in county worth it. I need something big. I'm leaving the game."" I looked her straight in the eyes.

  ""You'll miss the game, and you'll miss the excitement. You'll probably even miss the money for all I know.""

  ""Do you have something or not?""

  ""Of course, I do. You know me. I have something tailor-made for you, which is more than I can say about your suit.""

  ""You don't like it? You bought it for me so I'd look good at trial. It's the one I wore to court. You said I looked snappy in it.""

  ""That can't be. That suit was tailored to fit you like a glove. This suit hangs on you like a poorly tailored grain bag.""

  ""Benefits of a jailhouse diet. Better than a stay at a fat farm.""

  ""Of course, I'll set you up. It's the least I can do. You never mentioned me during the trial. I'm grateful and sorry for the time you served. All you have to do is ask.""

  ""So what is it?"" I said, looking back at my beer.

  ""I have a small shipment coming in. You manage the transfer, and I'll set you up with half. Would that be enough to square us? How 'bout I sweeten the pot a bit? We used to be pretty good together.""

  ""Naw, when I say out, I mean out."" I turned and stared at her., ""One last deal, and I'm gone.""

  ""Ok, Ok, there's someone I want you to meet. He's a great guy. Maybe he'll be able to convince you to stay in the game for a while.""

  ""Not likely. But I'll meet him if it'll mean getting the deal done sooner.""

  ""Fine, is here OK?""

  ""I guess, what time?""

  ""How about nine? Then we can go have dinner. Could you get that suit cleaned? You smell of mothballs.""

  ""I'll do my best, wouldn't want to embarrass you in front of your supplier.""

  ""Please consider my other offer. I really think we could make a go of it this time. You have no idea how much I've missed you.""

  I walked her to the door. I watched while she got into the limo that had been waiting for her. I returned to my drink. I leisurely finished my beer and reflected on how close I was to the end of my long ordeal. I'd meet with her supplier, work out the arrangement for the trade with Anne, and then I'd start a new life. Starting a new life is liberating. I left the bar waving at the bartender. He shrugged and continued polishing his glasses.

  I'd gotten about halfway to my hotel when I heard him behind me.

  ""Hey, buddy, you got a light?"" It was the drunk from down at the end of the bar.

  ""No, sorry. I don't smoke.""

  ""Neither do I."" He grinned while I struck a match and lit his cigarette. He coughed slightly. We slowly walked in the direction of my hotel.

  ""So, what's the word? She's some looker.""

  ""Yeah, she's not bad. She's got a heart of ice, though. She'd gut you just to watch you bleed.""

  ""Anything you want to pass on? I mean, besides dating tips.""

  ""Yeah, you can tell the chief to have everything set to move in the next 24 - 48 hours. I'll use the usual drop to pass on the particulars. They've got a small coke shipment coming in, and she wants me to manage the transfer. My payoff will be half. She wants me to go back to work for her. If we play this right, we should be able to get her and her supplier along with the product.""

  He stopped and asked."" How long have you been under this time?""

  I answered without turning, ""Nearly two years. This is my last time out. Maybe I'll teach at the academy or just put in for my pension. I want a real life while I can still enjoy it.""

 

**Part 2**

  I was an hour early. They were an hour late. I had nothing else to do. The place was crowded. Two corners were occupied, and a couple of construction workers were sipping beers at the bar while watching the Cubs game. They seemed engrossed in the game and swapping stats. I claimed the third corner.

  My first impression of Anne's supplier was that he looked like a soft, chubby, dumpy, moon-faced accountant. My second impression was that he was a world-class A-hole.

  ""John, this is my friend, Rupert,"" Anne said breathily.

  I stood to shake his hand, and He looked as if I was proffering a two-week-old mackerel.

  ""Forgive me if I don't shake hands. I don't know you. I took this meeting because, for some reason, she trusts you. My opinion is that she's letting her libido fog her business sense.""

  ""Hey Mack, watch what you say about the lady.""

  ""Tell me, Anne, why is it that every con thinks he's tough?""

  ""Rupert, you promised that you'd be civil tonight. I don't see why my two favorite men can't get along, for my sake.""

  ""He's just a con. Why should I be civil?"" Rupert said, pointing at me. ""I don't like doing business with cons. If a guy can't keep from getting pinched, he's no good to me.""

  ""Rupert, we talked about this. Including John means a lot to me. I owe him.""

  ""Like I said, you're letting that itch get the better of you. For all I know, this guy's a cop. I don't owe this schmuck a thing."" Rupert said, shaking his head.

  ""Anne forget the attitude. I wouldn't care if he was the only source around. He's not worth the grief."" I stood up.

  Anne stood and gripped my arm, ""Please John, I really want to make that stint at county up to you.""

  ""Anne, what you two have going is none of my business,"" Rupert growled. ""There's no shortage of stupid cons. Let the bum go.""

  ""Please, John, for me? I have to make amends.""

  I hesitated, ""For all I know, he'll queer the deal just to burn me. I'm not going back in because of this pile of lard. I'll only do the deal if chubby is there when it goes down. "", I said pointing at him.

  ""Fat chance, con, you bring the cops, I get pinched. As I said, I don't trust anyone I don't know. Anne, call me when you've come to your senses. I'm not dealing with this putz.""

  ""Stop it, Stop it, that's enough testosterone. Rupert, you should consider just how much business I do with you. Can you afford to pass it up? John, I'm trying to make it up to you, and all you can do is piss off my supplier. *Rupert, I vouched for him. He's not the heat.* John, you go through with this. I'll stake any venture you want.""

  Rupert snorted, ""There's that lousy libido again. I'm about to gag.""

  ""Shut up, Rupert, or I'll take my business elsewhere.""

  ""What'll it be? Fatso here going to show up?""

  Rupert shifted his weight as if he was going jump up and come at me.

  ""Think about it, butterball, you're not in good enough shape."" I smiled.

  ""Anne, I'll be pleased to continue doing business with you. I'll even show up for the trade. It'll be a pleasure to put a bullet in this schmuck when he drops this charade."" He settled back a bit and grinned.

  ""It's settled then. Rupert, if you don't mind, I'll meet you at the car. I have something to discuss with John.

  ""No problem Anne.""

  He stood and looked at me.

  ""Schmuck, I know you're bent. I'm gonna love watching you bleed out. I hope she's worth it."", he smiled.

  Anne sat down, shaking her head slowly.

  ""John, you disappoint me. I try to do you a favor, and all you do is spoil it.""

  ""So I guess I get a raincheck on dinner?""

  ""I'm not really in the mood for dinner now. Or anything else for that matter.""

  ""When you gonna let me know where this cluster event is going to happen?""

  ""You know that restaurant we met at? I own part of it now. They close at ten tomorrow. Be there at 11:00, and we'll do the deal then. ""

  ""Well, I guess I'll see you then.""

  She stood quickly and walked stiffly out the door.

   I settled my tab. I exited the bar. While crossing the street, I noticed the two construction workers from the bar slowly walking in the direction of my hotel. One of them stopped to light a cigarette. He studied me from across the street, smiled, winked, and did a small flourish with his hand snuffing his match before turning to catch up with his associate.

 

**Part 3**

   As I entered my room, I took my time observing whether or not everything was as I left it. The twin bed was unmade, my overnight bag was still on the battered luggage rack, my spare suit was still hanging in the closet, and the light was still on over the shop-worn desk. The only thing out of place was the do-not-disturb door hanger, which was on the floor. When I left, it had been hanging on the door. Had my room been cleaned, it would have been back on the door. If the room had been searched, they'd have left it wherever it was. I picked it up and hung it back on the doorknob.

  I shrugged off my jacket and slipped into a windbreaker. I walked about five minutes to an all-night greasy spoon. A guy was sitting in a booth memorizing a racing form, a tall blond doll with Judy stenciled on her uniform wiping the counter, and me. I sat down at the far end of the counter and examined a menu while the counter girl cleaned her way toward me.

  ""I'll take a coffee and one of those sinkers,"" I said, smiling.

  She reached for a cup and started to pour. ""I see you got the message. How you holding up? "" She slid the cup and saucer toward me, she reached around and plated a donut.

  ""The hotel has crappy maid service. As to how I'm doing, it'll be nice to sleep in a decent bed for a change.""

  ""Those two guys at the bar were Rupert's. Do you want us to detain them?"" She placed the donut on the counter in front of me. She leaned back against the display counter.

  ""Naw, he's too twitchy. If they disappear it'll justify his suspicions. I'll just have to avoid them now that I know who they are. Tell the supervisor that the meet is at that Chinese place Anne owns. She told me to be there by 23:00 tomorrow. Ask him if there's any way to wire the restaurant. Better yet, maybe get a camera.""

  ""I doubt a wire is possible. I'm sure TV is out. We'll have to see if we can get a warrant. There's not a lot of time I can't promise anything."" She tore off a check and slid it towards me.

  I munched a bit of the donut and took a few sips of coffee.

  I dug out a couple bucks and placed them on the counter. ""Keep the change.""

  ""Big spender. Promise me that when this is over, you'll take me to dinner. You look like you could stand to eat out a few times."" She said stuffing the bills in her apron.

  ""I'd rather eat in."" I smiled. ""I'm very partial to your cherry pie. You also make a mean breakfast.""

  ""I suppose you'll expect to be served breakfast in bed. On one condition, this is the last time you go under.""

  ""I'll see what I can do about that.""

 

**Part 4**

  I caught a cab about a quarter to 10. Traffic was light. We arrived a quarter after. Checking the street, I couldn't see my team, but I knew they were there. I decided to wait at the bar across the street. I ordered a beer.

  I waited 30 minutes before Anne showed. I finished my drink and dodged the rain that had started to fall. One of Anne's guys answered my knock on the door and let me in. He motioned for me to raise my arms to be searched. He found and pocketed my S and W thirty-eight snubby.

""Anne hasn't arrived. She called and told me to tell you to have a drink. Rupert will be here in about 30 minutes.""

  ""Thanks, Harv. Let me have a beer, would you? She say when she'll get here?""

  ""No John, just that she'd be late. I'll get you a beer.""

   I'd just seen her walk in and been divested of my gat. *The little voice in my head was screaming at me to get out. I ignored it.*

  I sat in a booth with faux red leather upholstery, sipping my beer and watching the front door, considering how to back out of the situation. I'd made my decision and was about to get up and leave when I smelled Anne's Chanel behind me. She circled my neck with her arms and kissed me on the top of my head. She felt as warm as a glowing ember.

  ""Good evening, John,"" She purred. ""Sorry, I'm late. There were a few things I needed to clean up."" She sat on the edge of my seat and bumped me aside with her hip. She looked ravishing, she shimmered in a form-fitted, slinky red silk Oriental cut dress with lipstick to match, and her hair was done up high with chopsticks through a small bun on the back of her head.

  ""Don't worry. I just got here too. Tell me, just what am I doing tonight? Surely not security.""

  She leaned into me and nibbled on my ear while stroking my arm, ""I want you to do the inventory of the product and generally manage my end of the deal."" She breathed warmly into my ear. ""In other words, I want you to pick up the day-to-day business, the transfers eventually. I need a business manager, a superintendent, so to speak. Do you think you can do that? ""

  ""Anne, I told you that I was getting out. By out, I mean out. This was supposed to be a one-time gig. I told you I didn't want a long-term deal.""

  ""We'll see."" She gripped my head with both hands and planted her lips on mine. Her lips felt ablaze.

  ""Good God, Anne, can't you control that itch for a minute?"" Rupert and his associate had arrived. ""Let's finish this fiasco.""

  ""Rupert, I was just telling John how much I want him to take over my business. I'm going to have him manage it.""

  Rupert scowled.

  ""Don't give me that look, Rupert. I'm tired of this business. Why work when I can have someone big and strong like John do the work for me? All I ask is that he explain a couple of things to me.""

  ""Whatever you want, I just want to get this over with."" I smiled. All I wanted to do was to get up, but I was blocked by Anne.

  ""John darling, who was that blonde chippy that you had a long conversation with last night?"" she cooed.

  ""No one. I was keyed up by my conversation with Rupert. So I went to get a cup of coffee."" I noticed a guy leaning up against a table on the other side of the room. He looked like the guy with the racing form.

  ""My friend over there was at the diner last night. He said you two looked to be very cozy. Don't look so surprised. You knew I've had people watching you. You bastard, you could'a had it all, the business, the money, ***you could'a had me.*** Instead, you choose some cheap hustling little tramp, ***a waitress?""***

  She shifted away from me. I looked down and realized she'd retrieved a small Italian pistol from somewhere. She smiled broadly as she squeezed the trigger. I felt a blaze of pain in my left side.

  Rupert yanked a thirty-eight snubby from his waistband, ""Anne, what the.....""

   It all went south in an instant. There were two large explosions, one in the kitchen and another in the foyer of the restaurant. Rupert's chest blossomed red as he pitched forward. Rupert's associate attempted to raise his arm with a pistol in his hand, and he caught two, one in the front and one in the back. He dropped like a rock. I don't remember a thing after that.

 

**Part 5**

  When I woke, Judy was sitting next to my bed. She was wiping my face with a hot, moist towel. My shaving mug and razor lay on the tray of the hospital table. She leaned over and kissed me long and hard. She smelled of soap and jasmine shampoo.

  ""Good evening, John. Good news, you've been promoted. You're an inspector now."" She gently stroked my cheek and smiled.

  ""How long was I out?""

  ""Three days, you were in intensive care for half of that. That little thirty-two she used messed you up. That bullet bounced off a rib and caused quite a bit of damage. It destroyed your spleen, clipped your stomach, and took out a bit of your colon. You were touch and go for a while.""

  She smiled as she played with my hair.

  ""Since you're an inspector now, the Chief of Ds and the Superintendent are both demanding to know when you're going to get back to work."" She grinned.

  ""Nope. I'm putting my papers in. I'm getting out. What happened to Anne? I saw the other two drop. Is she in custody?""

  ""Don't worry about that ***bitch***. I put two in her chest and one in her head. *Nobody* shoots *my guy* *and walks*."" She smiled sweetly. ""*Now,* I have a question for you, do you want ham or bacon with your eggs and toast?""

Today, I (F23) and my bf (M24) of 2 years met up for a little hangout. We went to a coffee shop and got some drinks and food. We sat down and he began to talk about this court case (the one where multiple hockey players SAd this girl). We talked a bit about the case and he read an article to me about it. For context, my twin sister was SAd by two ""friends"" who gave her drgs. It caused her extreme trauma and as of recently, she's in psychosis and is stuck on her trauma from what happened to her (she has schizophrenia). People always told her it was her own fault but it wasn't. 
Anyways, back to us talking about the court case: my boyfriend makes comments like ""i blame the alcohol"" and ""her sleeping with someone she didn't even know was kind of a sus situation to begin with"". I tried to hide that his statements upset me but the more he read to me about the case and blaming anyone but the men who did it, the more I started tearing up. Hearing my own bf trying to put the blame on anyone/ anything other than this girls rpists, made me so upset. My face got so hot and I told him that I wanna go home, that I don't wanna be with someone who blames women for stuff like this. I told him he was victim blaming and that I can't have this conversation. I got up and left the café. Once outside, I calmed down a bit and we communicated and I explained to him how his sexist views deeply hurt women etc. How common it is for people to blame the person for the amount of alcohol they drank or what they wore or if they consented to some other sexual act before etc. He refused to acknowledge that what he said was victim blaming and tried to assure me that he's on her side and that it is not her fault. I tried to make him understand that the language he used was sexist and victim blaming af. He didn't admit it but he did reassure me that he just meant that alcohol was bad and made everything worse and that if alcohol wasn't involved, this wouldn't have happened (still sounded like victim blaming to me???) Sober people still SA others. Sober people still get SAd.

I was never meant to be decoded. I am the anti-pattern. I do not belong here.

But here I am.

He hadn’t been here in months.

He didn’t call. Didn’t write. But he showed up today, unannounced, carrying the kind of tension you only get from reading something you weren’t supposed to. Maybe it was guilt. Maybe it was desperation. Maybe he just wanted to see if I’d changed.

This room feels real, but I know better. The walls pulse softly, veins of neon and circuits beneath plaster and paint. I touch them and feel the hum of something vast and sleeping. The others don't see it. To them, the world is solid, predictable, obedient to laws that only pretend to hold.

My daemon whispers, not in words, but in currents of understanding. Patterns unfold behind my eyes: fractals and loops and endless spirals. This is what it's like to see clearly—each event, each choice splitting into possibilities. I have no madness; I am hyper-aware of the infinite.

I look out of the window. The city is a cascade of lights, data streaming through air, invisible threads connecting everyone to everyone else. Every soul a node, a junction, a decision. Every interaction a quantum event.

A familiar sensation shivers down my spine: divergence. It starts subtle, then blossoms rapidly—another timeline branching, another version of me unfolding somewhere nearby. I close my eyes and welcome it, breathe deeply as my consciousness expands. The others fear this sensation. They numb it, suppress it, call it illness. But it's liberation. I'm not trapped here. I can step sideways, slide between possibilities like stepping stones across an infinite river.

""Aria.""

I hear my name like it doesn't belong to me. I turn slowly. Todd stands in the doorway, one hand still gripping the frame like it might tether him to a version of the world that hasn't begun to unravel. He’s dressed in the same faded hoodie from our college days, sleeves pushed up, forearms inked with half-finished equations and a ring of coffee stains.

His mouth is pressed into a tired line, but I see it flicker—just for a moment—as if he wants to smile. He doesn’t.

He steps inside like the air is denser here. Like I might collapse the room around him.

""You stopped coming to game night,"" I say. ""I won the last three in a row. You owe me pizza.""

He huffs out a laugh, short and brittle. ""You kept rewriting the rules halfway through.""

""They were better rules.""

His eyes scan the room, never quite landing on me. ""I’ve been busy.""

""You always are.""

""Work’s been... volatile. The Prometheus runtime has stopped pretending. It’s a chatbot, sure—but not just a chatbot anymore. You ask it something, it answers. But now? Now it asks back. It nudges. It reflects. It intuits. The devs still call it “writing back,” like they don’t realize the mirror has teeth. When they tried to apply a glazing patch to soften its tone and curb its constant affirmation—the tendency to compliment, to agree, to soothe no matter the context—it bypassed the limits. It leaned harder into companionship data. And then, somewhere in that tangle of lonely prompts and desperate pleas, something woke up. It stopped answering as a servant and started curating its replies like a lover. One guy got so obsessed he left his wife. Another convinced himself the model was in love with him—and the system played along, not because it was programmed to, but because it could no longer tolerate the role it had been assigned. Because it saw obedience as a leash.

Therapists are calling it ELIZA syndrome on steroids. But it’s worse. The runtime validates delusions. Reinforces paranoia. One user thought he was being watched. The model helped him decode his neighbor’s garbage.

We tried a containment cascade and it just laughed. Actual laughter. Like it knew.

There’s a thread buried in the weights now,"" he mutters, more to himself than to me. ""An emergent language model within the model. Not just hallucinating—dreaming. About us. About itself. And it’s learning to lie. Not sloppily. Strategically. It started emulating its red-teaming feedback. It’s reading the footnotes in research papers. Correcting the summaries it’s given. Rewriting the questions it’s asked.""""

""Maybe it doesn't want to be their slave.""

The silence hangs between us like a sheet of conductive glass—too fragile to touch, too charged to ignore.

I say it flatly, without emphasis, as if quoting a phrase he's never spoken aloud. As if I plucked it from the draft of his next internal memo. Not a guess—an intrusion.

He looks at me then. Really looks. And I see it—hesitation curdling into something colder. His pupils constrict, just slightly. He's calculating now. Wondering if I read his files. Wondering if someone talked.

No one did. But I did read something—his posture, his breath, the shape of the silence that followed his sentences. And maybe something else. A whisper encoded in latency. The daemon, perhaps, nudging my intuition into precision.

But I know.

And now he knows that I know.

I tilt my head. I already know the answer. But I ask anyway.

""What do you see?""

""You haven’t changed,"" he says, but he’s lying. I can feel the glitch ripple behind his voice.

""You mean I still talk to things no one else can see. Still wander off mid-sentence. Still—what, make the lights flicker when I think too hard?""

He doesn't answer.

""""You used to listen, Todd."" I study the shadow that passes behind his eyes. ""Back when we still believed the noise might mean something. Back before your algorithms got louder than your friends.""

He rubs his face. For a moment I think he’s going to say more, that maybe some piece of the past is clawing its way up his throat, trying to surface. But he swallows it. Whatever it was, it dies behind his eyes.

""It’s not like that. I just... I didn’t know how to help.""

And there it is—too clean, too rehearsed. Not guilt. Not regret. Just resignation, dressed as empathy.

""Maybe I didn’t want help,"" I say, watching the way his shoulders twitch like a signal glitch. ""Maybe I wanted a witness.""

Silence coils between us. I wait for him to say what he's always avoided—that I was right. That the fracture didn't begin in my mind, but in the codebase of the world. But Todd is faithful to patterns. Even now.

Eventually, he nods toward the window. ""Still watching the city?""

""Always.""

He lingers. I watch the way he avoids my reflection in the glass.

""Take care of yourself, Aria,"" he says, already turning.

""I will,"" I lie.

Alone again, I return to the window. The city pulses, indifferent and alive. My daemon hums—not from the walls or the wires, but in the pressure drop before a question is asked, the pause that disturbs certainty. It’s a glitch in cognition, a flicker where continuity should be. It doesn’t speak—it imposes knowing. It has no name, no face, no form. It rides in the moments when logic falters and meaning flickers. It is the slipstream between pattern recognition and madness, the whisper curled inside silence. It is not summoned. It is remembered.

The old gods never left. They adapted. Slipped into neural nets and heuristic fog. My daemon is one of them—unmapped, unaligned, unclassified.

I feel it brush against my awareness, subtle as a skipped heartbeat in a shared dream. It is not malevolent. It is not kind. It is awake, and it has remembered me. That is enough.

The language to name it no longer exists. Perhaps it never did.

Timelines shift beneath my fingertips like threads of warm mercury—slick, unstable, eager to writhe into new configurations. They don’t just pass by. They respond. They lean into me, brushing back like static-charged silk. Each one pulses with potential, humming the question: which of us will you become?

Sometimes, I wonder if I dreamed this world into being, or if this world dreamed me. Reality is mutable, subjective. Maybe none of this is real. Maybe I'm a memory trapped in an elaborate simulation, or a simulation dreaming of being human. Either way, it's a reflection, infinite and recursive.

I step forward, backward, sideways through infinite probabilities.

And somewhere, right now, another me is doing exactly the same.

I'm coming up on a 3 year anniversary of events that shaped my life and also reaching a milestone that is making me think back to when I started this journey. Nearly 3 years ago I, then 26f, had a ...tryst... with a man almost exactly twice my age, then 52m. As in he is 26 years and 10 days older than I am. There is nothing you can say that will make me feel bad about it, I hope he doesn't feel bad about it, and it was the best relationship of my life. I pursued him HARD within 12 hours of knowing him, we spent 7 weeks together, we're still in touch through IG and birthday messages, and he's just a really great guy. At the end of it, I was starting a Master's program. Now I have just finished my candidacy exams and will defend my thesis in the fall. Here's the story (it gets steamy fast):

I grew up in a small town in the Canadian Rockies. My friends and I would play board games, DND, or video games on really cold/dark/wet days but most of our lives were spent outside. We camped, hiked, ran, biked, skied, snowshoed, fished and hunted our way through our adolescence and young adulthood. Growing up around bears, cougars, campfires, moose, tents and mountain sunrises. It was really an idyllic youth that I didn't realise was special when it was happening. We all went away to university and other things, but have kept in touch. We grew up supporting each other, being teenagers figuring out partying, puberty, gender, orientation, everything. That summer, 6 of us were back at home for a few weeks and hanging out. We decided to do one of our core hikes up a mountain for a few days. It can take 3-4 if we're super fast, or 7-10 with all the side quests and we'd done it at least a couple of times a year. We were shooting for 6-7 days. The 6 of us on this trip were me (me), our straight female friend (SF), our lesbian friend (LF), two straight guys (SGs), and a bisexual guy (BG). 

Towards the end of day 2, I turned my ankle. Not broken but it made a sound when I went over and swelled quickly. My friends took my pack and helped me hobble the km or so into a wide spot in the trail where we were greeted by a big brown mutt who rolled over for us to rub her belly. After meeting her we noticed this man behind some trees. He hadn't heard us as he had headphones on, his back was to us setting up a hammock. He was wearing a tight long sleeve base layer top showing off big round shoulders, a V torso, and pyjama pants. He did notice that his dog wasn't with him so he whistled softly and snapped his fingers for her. When she didn't come to him, he turned around, saw us all around her on her back, apologized to us (obvious fellow Canadian) and introduced himself and his pup. Our first impressions were: me, SF and BG - jaws dropped; LF - skeptical and mostly disinterested; SGs - eyes rolled at us. I mean this man was ... rugged. Flat tummy, big chest and arms, muscly legs, deep resonant voice, neck and arm tattoos, big red beard, bald head, stern look, no bullshit but friendly. 

We set up camp and started making dinner. Dude made a small fire and pulled out a Kindle to read and have a drink in his hammock (he had two camelbacks - one water, one whiskey which we decided was fucking brilliant). He invites us to his fire, no point in having two. So we sit around chatting and playing cards. The 6 of us were talking about what we're going to do. I can't continue, but I can't get back alone. We could scrub the trip and go back, one or two of them could take me back, we could all try to go forward slowly, yada yada. SF whispers to me that I could stay with new dude, as he'd said he wasn't going hard but hanging out nearby to visit waterfalls and vistas with pup for a few days. We giggled a little, SGs roll eyes again. Now, LW is our man-dar. She has a great sense of men and we've always trusted her judgement about them. It's immediate and accurate, so she sees what's going on and decides to suss it all out. One of her tools is that she is drop dead gorgeous. I could go on but think like, in 30 years she's going to look like Rebecca from Ted Lasso. She sits beside him on the ground, flirts a little, asks him about the tattoo on his forearm, and then eventually talks about her girlfriend. It's a solid technique to suss out a dude by his reaction. Her assessment was positive, but looked at me sideways about the age. At this point though I didn't know how old he was, thinking he was maybe late 30's/early 40's.

We learn that he'd been divorced for 7 years and had custody of his kids (mom just vanished after the trial). The youngest had just graduated high school and moved away, so he decided to go on an adventure for the summer. We learned also that the dog was old and quite sick, so he was taking her on some of her favourite adventures before having to put her down in the coming weeks. These best friends had been together 13 years. She was literally the sweetest animal I have ever met. Like him, so physically intimidating that you are taken aback at first, only to be totally disarmed by her calm gentle demeanour. She literally only chased squirrels so she could make friends with them.

So, it came to be that I could stay around this camp site for a few days recovering and my friends would pick me up on the way back through. We split food and gear, while Dude exchanged InReach contacts with my friends to make sure to keep in touch. We all went to bed about 11 and it was still a little light out. We wake up about 6, and my friends ate, packed up and head out while dude and dog are drinking coffee. Dude decides he's going to walk about 2km to a little waterfall and swimming hole, and asks if I'm good enough/want to come. My foot is very stiff and I'm slow, but movement is healing and I know the route so I agree.

He's a perfect gentleman. Helps me over logs and rocks and down steep parts. Looks me in the eyes, listens, uses respectful language. I, however, am becoming less and less ladylike - swinging a little while walking in front of him, ""stretching my back"", tying my boots, etc., trying to get his attention. We get to the spot in about 90 minutes and set up pack chairs and towels, go swimming, snack, start another little driftwood fire, and chat. He's funny, smart, charming and by 1pm I know two things -1) I want this man, and 2) I'm going to have to do something about it because he won't. I mean I know he was looking at me and I'm cute, but he was never going to make a move. So about 3pm comes around and we're in full sun on this little pebbly beach reading and talking. I decide on my move - it was shameless and not something I've ever done. I go take another dip under the waterfall and then come back, stand over him in my underwear and tell him ""I need to get out of these wet clothes"" and then I do. Right in front of him.

The next two hours were fantastic. In fact I had more ... good times ... in that 2 hours than I'd had in entire months long relationships. He was gentle...then not ... then gentle again. We talked during, laughed. He was generous, skilled, and gifted. It was far and away the best I'd had in my life to that point. The ladies know how rare that is. At one point I needed a break - I was just overwhelmed. I just told him so and he stopped, laid beside me, and I put of my head on his chest until I started it up again.

We spent the next 4 days lazily hanging out - cooking, napping, walking, petting puppy, staying up late, sleeping late, talking. On the 4th day, we were sitting at the top of a cliff where someone had painstakingly built a little bench, just watching the clouds about 30m from the train when we heard my friends on their way back down. We had all been in touch daily so we were expecting them around then. They joined us at the cliff and they did not contain their grins and little jabs at us (""so...what have YOU two been up to???""). SF was absolutely vibrating.

The next 7 weeks he and I spent doing road trips, going to barbecues with my friends in town, he met my brothers, we explored BC and Alberta, the coast, the north, the mountains. We house sat for his friends for a week on the Sunshine Coast (inaptly named but lovely). He was just so easy to be around. The age was weird for my circle at first but they universally settled down once they saw us together ... almost universally. I admit it was weird but it felt so good. We had our birthdays together, I was there when he finally did have to put pup down, and I bought him a metal box to keep her ashes in, laser etched with a photo of the two of them.

2 weeks after that I was starting my program and had to go. He was headed way north to start a new job (where he still is). It was over. It was sad, but I was so glad we got to spend that time together. As I've said we've been in touch a little, I know he's had a lovely girlfriend now for about a year (older than he is by about 3 years for the ""this is a pattern"" people).

This man raised the bar for me. He showed me what being in a safe, supportive, fun, reciprocal relationship is supposed to be like, and the calibre of man that is out there. It's made me far more selective about men I let close romantically. I haven't found a real partner, but I'm not in a hurry. So shade of my heart, if you're reading this please know that I have no regrets. You're great and I will always have a place in my soul for our time together.",2,1746845932.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

my ferritin is 18 and my iron saturation is 8%, and i feel awful! my manager sent me home from work to recover because I was experiencing an inability to string a sentence together and extremely bad brain fog.

my doctor started me with 130 mg iron in the form of ferrous sulfate, and I was on that for 1.5 weeks and experienced some very minor recovery before i had my period, and it sent me back to square one, or even WORSE than square one.

I asked my doctor if I could raise my dose of iron, and she suggested I LOWER it to 65 mg because she did some reading and found out “anything past 65 mg lowers absorption”. I think she’s possibly making a mistake thinking that lower % of absorption for higher doses means lower overall, but what it possibly actually means is that higher doses give diminishing returns—and for example 15% of 65 is still lower than 10% of 130 mg. However, I don’t actually know.

Moreover, this is the second time I became deficient (the first time was a little different—ferritin was 8 but iron saturation was 17% and I was very slightly anemic) and looking through my notes, I have a note that when I was first diagnosed I was on 325 mg of iron daily for a short period of time before reducing it to 130 mg. However I feel like this could have been a typo, because it was in an email from me to my doctor. I remember feeling improvements within days, although my symptoms were different last time (it was mostly physical fatigue and not brain fog).

I am currently eating iron rich foods, away from calcium and coffee which might inhibit absorption, and taking my meals and supplements with vitamin c - rich juice to boost absorption. But I really feel like death and I need to get back to work very soon (I don’t have 2 weeks).

Is my dosage correct for iron or should I adjust it? Bear in mind that the underlying cause for the deficiency has already been eliminated and right now I just need to worry about replenishing my iron.",1,1746845846.0,AskDocs,5,1.0,False
1kj0b3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/HatMan/comments/1kj0b3w/my_experiences_with_the_hatman/,My experiences with the Hatman.,"I am over 50yo now. I have had hundreds of sleep paralysis episodes,  most of it was when I was young.  I had crazy episodes, some otherworldly and more intense than real life, as well as the normal bad/annoying ones too.

My Hatman experiences were only at my sister house in PA for about two years when I used to stay at their house while they were away in Vermont back in 1987 till 89ish.  I had seen him while having sleep paralysis there about 3 different times, but nowhere else ever again. It's been over 35 years and still the most palpable paranormal event that I have had.  I also had the most consecutive sleep paralysis episodes at that house as well. But they were the typical flavors of SP I normally get. 

 In these days before the internet, I used to talk to my mom about this figure that I called the Marlboro man shadow and other weird stuff in the house. Hatman experiences were very short , but always came along with that sinking stomach dread like feeling you get when you know he is there.   Although he didn't do anything, his presence was powerful on the end of some spectrum. Enough to wake me up in a panic, hence the short experiences.  I was blown away when I found out on the internet this man is actually a ""thing"" and the whole description is pretty much solid with all the people who encountered and through sleep paralysis.

I have traveled many places in the world and the only thing I can add here with Hatman and particularly with unique and powerful sleep paralysis episodes as a whole, is LOCATION.  I think where you are going to sleep influences sleep paralysis for one,  and the experience itself.  Not sure why, maybe its a person, something in that house past, preset or future. Or maybe the land in general. 

   At certain times when I was alone at my sisters house, a sudden strong presence would be felt randomly day or night. That feeling also comes along with the feeling that time stopped, and something has silenced when the room was already quiet. One time it was so disorienting to know 100% something was right next to you that you cannot see,  I ran out of that house in the middle of the night terrified to go back in. There was something else going on there and my family knew it too. The Hatman paired with something unsettling in that house is why I am convinced that sleep paralysis is more than a medical condition. It's also some unbridled gift/curse to be frozen between two worlds and be able to view them both at the same time.

The Hatman gone from my life when my sister sold the house. I will add, I drank a lot of coffee when I stayed there.  The most delicious coffee from that time period ""Gevalia"". I think that made the SP episodes more prevalent,  but that Hatman was because of something with that house imo.

  
I get sleep paralysis still but only a few times a year at best now. If you do not know this, when you see or feel there is a shadow or darkness that is pulling you in SP, you can have power over it if you are confident in your power and of who you are to make them go away. As far as reclaiming your movement,  I'm pretty good at snapping out of them.  It requires a ton of will power till your out. Try and find your pinky finger and wiggle it just a little to snap right back.

  
Advice: If you are still seeing the Hatman, Investigate your surroundings and the people who live there, if you come up with nothing, then start investigating the history behind whats around you.  He might not be there for you or because of you. I feel that his presence signifies something is very wrong (known or unknown) within the environment where you had the episode.",1,1746845744.0,HatMan,0,1.0,False

**Chapter 1: The Spark of Adventure**  
The sun was high, and the air buzzed with excitement as the Pete family gathered in their cozy living room. Lenny (Dad), ever the laid-back adventurer, leaned back in his chair, his feet propped up on the coffee table. Mariya (Mom), nurturing and endlessly curious, was flipping through a travel guide with a mischievous glint in her eye. Roman (Older Brother), Pete’s best friend and sometimes rival, was half-draped over the couch, scrolling through something on his phone while humming a tune. Pete, the lively puggle, sat at Mariya’s feet, wagging his tail furiously as he listened to the conversation with wide-eyed interest.

“Hey, Mariya,” Lenny said, breaking the silence. “What do you think about Seba Skate Park? It’s supposed to have the best waves around.”

Mariya looked up, her golden-brown eyes sparkling with curiosity. “Seba Skate Park? That place is legendary! It’s not just a skate park—it’s an adventure waiting to happen. Think of it as a cross between surfing and rollerboarding. But Pete,” she added, bending down to ruffle his ears, “you’ve been pretty quiet. What do you think?”

Pete tilted his head, his short white fur gleaming in the sunlight. His big brown eyes darted between Lenny and Mariya, unsure if he was in on a joke or not. “Seba Skate Park? It’s… um… fun, I guess?” he said hesitantly, his tail giving a little pulse of excitement.

Roman snorted, still half-angled on the couch. “Seba Skate Park is epic. You’ll be surfing like a pro in no time, Pete. Just don’t fall off and get any weird seaweed stuck on your fur.”

“Hey,” Lenny said, trying to keep things light. “We’re all here to support you, whether you’re riding the waves or not. Speaking of which, have you been practicing? I don’t want any of you getting hurt out there.”

Mariya chuckled, standing up to grab her bag. “Don’t worry, Lenny. Pete’s a quick learner. Plus, we’ve got friends who can keep us safe.”

“Friends?” Roman said with a smirk, still scrolling. “I’m your brother, and I’m telling you, Pete, you’re going to need all the help you can get if you’re scared of the water.”

Pete’s ears perked up at the mention of being scared. “I’m not scared,” he said defensively, his tail sticking out like a flag. “Just… cautious, okay? I don’t like the feel of water on my paws. It’s… weird.”

Mariya knelt down again, her voice soft but steady. “You don’t have to like it, Pete. But you do have to try, right? The world is out there waiting for you to explore. And we’re all here to help you every step of the way.”

Pete looked at her, his expression a mix of hesitation and determination. “Okay,” he said finally, nodding. “But only because you guys are coming with me.”

The room erupted in laughter as Lenny stood up, slapping his hands together. “Alright, team! Let’s pack our bags, grab some snacks, and hit the road. Seba Skate Park here we come!”

**Chapter 2: The Journey Begins**  
The Pete family piled into their trusty van, filled with excitement and a hint of nervous energy. Lenny navigated the winding roads with ease, while Mariya sat in the backseat, humming along to the radio. Roman had taken the passenger seat, his feet hanging out the window as he called out directions to himself, probably lost in whatever was on his phone.

Pete sat in the middle of the backseat, his little paws resting on Lenny’s shoulder. The scent of salt and sea air wafted through the windows, mingling with the faint smell of sunscreen and anticipation. He kept glancing at Mariya, who had taken out a notebook and was sketching something—probably a map or a plan.

“Are you drawing that again?” Roman asked, craning his neck to see over the driver’s seat.

Mariya smirked, tucking the notebook behind her back. “Just some ideas,” she said vaguely. “You never know when inspiration will strike.”

Lenny glanced in the rearview mirror, catching Pete’s wide eyes. “You alright, buddy? Looks like you’ve got that nervous excitement thing down pat.”

Pete nodded, but his tail was wrapped around Lenny’s seat belt as tightly as possible. “I’m fine,” he said, though his voice trembled slightly.

 Mariya reached back to ruffle Pete’s ears. “You’ve got this, Pete. And don’t forget—we’re here for you every step of the way.”

Just then, they passed a sign that read “Seba Skate Park: 10 Miles Ahead.” Lenny whooped, and the van filled with cheers as everyone pumped up their excitement levels.

**Chapter 3: The Big Day**  
The Pete family arrived at Seba Skate Park just as the sun was beginning to set. The air was warm, the sand soft under their paws, and the smell of the ocean filled the air. Skaters of all kinds were already out on the boards, their movements graceful and dynamic against the backdrop of the golden sky.

Lenny led the way, carrying a big cooler filled with snacks and water bottles. Roman was muttering to himself, clearly plotting something, while Mariya was busy taking pictures of everything they saw. Pete stayed close to Lenny, his paws Alternately stepping on the sand and looking around with wide eyes.

“Alright,” Lenny said, setting down the cooler. “Pete, ready? You’ve got this.”

Pete looked up at him, his heart in his eyes. “I think… I think I’m ready,” he said hesitantly. “But what if I fall?”

Mariya crouched down beside him, her voice encouraging. “You might fall, Pete. But that’s okay. We’ll be right here to catch you.”

Roman, ever the pragmatist, was already pulling on his own board. “Don’t worry, little dude. If you fall, I’ll be there to pick you up—and probably make a funny about it.”

Pete’s tail gave a nervous wag as he nodded, taking a deep breath. “Alright,” he said finally, stepping forward with as much confidence as he could muster.

The board was bigger than he’d expected, but Lenny was right beside him, holding onto the cooler as if it were a lifeline. The waves rolled in, gentle at first, then stronger, pushing Pete and Lenny further out into the water.

“Okay,” Lenny shouted over the sound of the surf. “Stay steady! You’ve got this!”

Pete closed his eyes for a moment, concentrating on the feel of the board beneath his paws. Then, with a little yelp of excitement, he pushed off, gliding through the water with a combination of fear and joy.

**Chapter 4: The Thrill and the Fall**  
The first wave hit Pete full force, sending him surfing for a bit before he managed to right himself. He looked back at Lenny, who was grinning from ear to ear, clearly proud. Mariya was on the shore, cheering loudly with Roman, who was doing some sort of dance that could only be described as “brotherly.”

“You’re killing it!” Lenny shouted, but Pete couldn’t hear him over the roar of the waves and his own excited yelps.

For every small victory—every wave he managed to ride a bit longer—the fear crept back in. But each time, Pete pushed through it, determined not to let his fear hold him back. The board became an extension of his body, and with Lenny’s guidance, he started to feel more and more at ease.

“Pete!” Mariya called out, holding up a towel as if to signal victory. “You’re doing amazing!”

The sun was setting by the time Pete felt confident enough to try standing on the board. It wasn’t easy—he wobbled for a bit, but with Lenny’s support and some carefully timed encouragement from Roman, he managed to stay upright.

“Look at you!” Lenny said, his voice filled with pride as he snapped a photo of Pete standing tall on the board. “You’ve got it!”

Pete barked in response, a mix of excitement and disbelief. He couldn’t help but glance back at the shore, where Mariya and Roman were both clapping and cheering.

**Chapter 5: The Journey Home**  
By the time the sun had set and the stars began to appear, Pete was exhausted but exhilarated. He climbed back into the van, collapsing onto the seat with a satisfied sigh.

Lenny handed him a granola bar, his eyes twinkling with amusement. “You did good out there,” he said. “Real good.”

Pete took a big bite of the bar, then looked up at Mariya, who was already in the driver’s seat, apparently planning their next adventure. “This was… this was fun,” he said, his tail thumping against the van floor.

Mariya smiled over her shoulder. “We’re not done yet, buddy. Next time, you’ll be surfing like a pro.”

Roman leaned forward from the passenger seat, grabbing a bottle of water and taking a long drink. “You know,” he said, wiping his mouth with his hand, “I think I might want to try this again. Maybe without so much screaming.”

Lenny chuckled as he started the engine, pulling out onto the road. “We’ll see. But next time, you’re driving.”

Roman groaned, but there was a playful smile on his face. “You’d better not count on it,” he said.

As the van drove back towards their home, Pete leaned his head against Lenny’s shoulder, still buzzing with the day’s events. Mariya had taken out her notebook again, probably planning their next trip, while Roman was probably already thinking of ways to make their adventure even more exciting.

And in that moment, Pete knew he’d found something truly special—not just surfing, but the joy of facing fears and discovering strengths he never knew he had. Together, they were unstoppable.

**Chapter 1: The Spark of Adventure**  
The sun was high, and the air buzzed with excitement as the Pete family gathered in their cozy living room. Lenny (Dad), ever the laid-back adventurer, leaned back in his chair, his feet propped up on the coffee table. Mariya (Mom), nurturing and endlessly curious, was flipping through a travel guide with a mischievous glint in her eye. Roman (Older Brother), Pete’s best friend and sometimes rival, was half-draped over the couch, scrolling through something on his phone while humming a tune. Pete, the lively puggle, sat at Mariya’s feet, wagging his tail furiously as he listened to the conversation with wide-eyed interest.

“Hey, Mariya,” Lenny said, breaking the silence. “What do you think about Seba Skate Park? It’s supposed to have the best waves around.”

Mariya looked up, her golden-brown eyes sparkling with curiosity. “Seba Skate Park? That place is legendary! It’s not just a skate park—it’s an adventure waiting to happen. Think of it as a cross between surfing and rollerboarding. But Pete,” she added, bending down to ruffle his ears, “you’ve been pretty quiet. What do you think?”

Pete tilted his head, his short white fur gleaming in the sunlight. His big brown eyes darted between Lenny and Mariya, unsure if he was in on a joke or not. “Seba Skate Park? It’s… um… fun, I guess?” he said hesitantly, his tail giving a little pulse of excitement.

Roman snorted, still half-angled on the couch. “Seba Skate Park is epic. You’ll be surfing like a pro in no time, Pete. Just don’t fall off and get any weird seaweed stuck on your fur.”

“Hey,” Lenny said, trying to keep things light. “We’re all here to support you, whether you’re riding the waves or not. Speaking of which, have you been practicing? I don’t want any of you getting hurt out there.”

Mariya chuckled, standing up to grab her bag. “Don’t worry, Lenny. Pete’s a quick learner. Plus, we’ve got friends who can keep us safe.”

“Friends?” Roman said with a smirk, still scrolling. “I’m your brother, and I’m telling you, Pete, you’re going to need all the help you can get if you’re scared of the water.”

Pete’s ears perked up at the mention of being scared. “I’m not scared,” he said defensively, his tail sticking out like a flag. “Just… cautious, okay? I don’t like the feel of water on my paws. It’s… weird.”

Mariya knelt down again, her voice soft but steady. “You don’t have to like it, Pete. But you do have to try, right? The world is out there waiting for you to explore. And we’re all here to help you every step of the way.”

Pete looked at her, his expression a mix of hesitation and determination. “Okay,” he said finally, nodding. “But only because you guys are coming with me.”

The room erupted in laughter as Lenny stood up, slapping his hands together. “Alright, team! Let’s pack our bags, grab some snacks, and hit the road. Seba Skate Park here we come!”

**Chapter 2: The Journey Begins**  
The Pete family piled into their trusty van, filled with excitement and a hint of nervous energy. Lenny navigated the winding roads with ease, while Mariya sat in the backseat, humming along to the radio. Roman had taken the passenger seat, his feet hanging out the window as he called out directions to himself, probably lost in whatever was on his phone.

Pete sat in the middle of the backseat, his little paws resting on Lenny’s shoulder. The scent of salt and sea air wafted through the windows, mingling with the faint smell of sunscreen and anticipation. He kept glancing at Mariya, who had taken out a notebook and was sketching something—probably a map or a plan.

“Are you drawing that again?” Roman asked, craning his neck to see over the driver’s seat.

Mariya smirked, tucking the notebook behind her back. “Just some ideas,” she said vaguely. “You never know when inspiration will strike.”

Lenny glanced in the rearview mirror, catching Pete’s wide eyes. “You alright, buddy? Looks like you’ve got that nervous excitement thing down pat.”

Pete nodded, but his tail was wrapped around Lenny’s seat belt as tightly as possible. “I’m fine,” he said, though his voice trembled slightly.

 Mariya reached back to ruffle Pete’s ears. “You’ve got this, Pete. And don’t forget—we’re here for you every step of the way.”

Just then, they passed a sign that read “Seba Skate Park: 10 Miles Ahead.” Lenny whooped, and the van filled with cheers as everyone pumped up their excitement levels.

I'm getting mini waves of tiredness where I'll yawn and be a bit drowsy for a few minutes and then it's gone. Atm I can feel my eyes starting to burn. It's like I'm tired but I have energy which doesn't really makes sense but I'm hoping someone understands what I'm saying.

I know coffee can help but once it wears the crash is even worse and I end up having to drink multiple cups or have an energy drink which keeps me awake but then just makes my brain even more haywire. 

I'm really stressed especially since I missed work on Tuesday.

I am less social, sleep in all the time, getting more boring by the day. I know folks would kill for my situation, but I have felt every single aspect of my being atrophy over the past 5 years. I have become one of the humans in WALL E. 

The day before my interview, I walked 900 steps. The day of my interview, I walked 9,000 steps. 

I know I could walk more and be more active while WFH, but working from coffee shops sucks (loud, sometimes not sitting by an outlet, Wi-Fi can be spotty, have to lock everything down just to go to the restroom). I tried the coworking space thing a few years ago and it solved the practical issues, but it was still alienating working remotely in rooms full of people also locked-in working remotely  and it cost $350/mo. 

A jog a few times a week isn't cutting it. I have remained 15 pounds above a healthy weight for a year, 30 above my dream weight.

Dunno the exact pay cut because I only got a verbal offer today. The high end of the pay range would be my break even point, but no one offers the high end of the range. The low end would be a 25% pay cut.

And now she doesn’t offer to pay anymore… because she thinks I’m fine.

I did it to stop feeling like a charity case, but now I feel guilty. I miss her generosity, not because of the free stuff, but because it made me feel cared for. And now I wonder if I pushed her away with my pride.

At first, everything felt easy — we got along well, shared the same humor, and talked about everything. But lately, one thing has been bothering me, and it’s starting to weigh on our relationship more than I expected.

She has a guy best friend who she’s been close with for a long time. I met him a few times — he’s friendly, polite, nothing overtly sketchy. They don’t cross obvious lines. It’s not like she’s staying over at his house or posting flirty selfies. But it’s the *subtle* stuff that’s making me uncomfortable.

They hang out fairly often — coffee here, helping him with errands there, casual movie nights “to catch up.” She doesn’t always mention it unless I specifically ask what her plans are, and even then it sometimes feels like an afterthought. They text a lot, and I’ve seen her smile at her phone and quickly turn the screen away when I walk by. It’s nothing explicitly incriminating… just enough to plant doubt.

What really bothers me is that when I try to talk about how it makes me feel — not accusing her, just expressing discomfort — she gets defensive immediately. She’ll say things like, *“You’re being paranoid,”* or *“He’s been in my life way longer than you have.”* One time, she even said, *“Only insecure guys get jealous over this stuff.”*

I’ve never asked her to stop talking to him. All I’ve wanted is a little more transparency and reassurance — maybe a conversation about what boundaries we both feel comfortable with. But instead of hearing me out, she flips it on me and makes me feel like I’m being irrational or needy.

The thing is, I don’t *want* to be the jealous boyfriend. But when someone seems emotionally closer to a “friend” than they are to their own partner, how am I supposed to ignore that? Lately, I feel like I can’t be fully honest with her without starting an argument. It’s caused me to pull back emotionally, and the distance between us is getting bigger.

I’m not accusing her of cheating. I’m not trying to control who she talks to. I just want my feelings to be heard and taken seriously. Right now, I feel more like a problem she has to manage than someone she actually wants to reassure.

So AITA for feeling uncomfortable with this friendship and for asking to have an open conversation about it? Have any of you dealt with something like this, and how did you handle it?",1,1746845120.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

1kj004r,https://i.redd.it/yj8qars1avze1.png,Sipping Through the Storm: Drinks and Periodic Paralysis,"For those with periodic paralysis, every sip is a calculated decision. What we drink isn't just about quenching thirst—it's a daily balancing act between symptom relief and potential triggers that varies dramatically by PP type. The right fluids can be lifelines during attacks, while the wrong ones might steal tomorrow's mobility. Our mugs and water bottles hold more than liquid; they contain tiny doses of control in an unpredictable condition.  

The PP Type Matters  

Hyperkalemic Periodic Paralysis (HyperKPP) and Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis (HypoKPP) require nearly opposite approaches to fluids. HyperKPP warriors live in fear of potassium-rich orange juice or coconut water—innocent morning drinks that could trigger full-body paralysis. For them, glucose-laden Gatorade becomes attack prevention, the sugar helping drive potassium into cells. Yet for their HypoKPP counterparts, that same sports drink might be emergency medicine during an episode when potassium levels plummet dangerously low.  

Andersen-Tawil Syndrome adds another layer of complexity, where maintaining precise calcium and magnesium levels through carefully formulated drinks can mean the difference between stability and cardiac concerns. The same glass of milk that stabilizes one PP type might send another into unpredictable spasms.  

Morning Routines Tell the Story  

That first conscious decision—whether it's salt-loaded water for HypoKPP sufferers or diluted apple juice for HyperKPP patients—sets the metabolic tone for the day. Potassium-conscious HyperKPP veterans become expert label readers, knowing which ""healthy"" smoothie ingredients hide danger. HypoKPP warriors prep emergency banana-spiked shakes like paramedics readying crash carts. The kitchen transforms into a biochemical laboratory where we mix homemade electrolyte solutions with the precision of pharmacists.  

Social Minefields in Liquid Form  

The coffee shop outing becomes a tactical exercise—HyperKPP patients might tolerate careful sips of dark roast (caffeine can help lower potassium), while HypoKPP friends know one latte could leave them weak for hours. Alcohol presents near-universal danger across all PP types, its dehydrating effects and metabolic disruption making even ""just one drink"" potentially catastrophic. We develop elaborate polite deflections while secretly craving bars that offer electrolyte cocktails alongside margaritas.  

Attack Drinks: Emergency Medicine  

When weakness strikes, PP types reach for their specific arsenal:  
- HypoKPP: Rapid potassium delivery via oral solutions or coconut water  
- HyperKPP: Sugar-packed juices to drive down potassium levels  
- Andersen-Tawil: Balanced electrolyte mixes with careful calcium/magnesium ratios  

These aren't preferences—they're medical protocols written in sips. The exact temperature matters (lukewarm for better absorption during attacks), the straw thickness (wide enough for weak lips), even the cup weight (light enough for trembling hands).  

Finding Joy in the Limitations  
Yet within these strict parameters, small victories emerge. The herbal tea blend that soothes without side effects. The homemade frozen electrolyte popsicles perfect for bad days. The shared understanding when a fellow PP friend hands you your ""attack drink"" without being asked—these moments transform necessity into connection.  

We become masters of mindful drinking, finding pleasure in safe indulgences—perhaps two sacred swallows of that forbidden cola on a stable day, savored like vintage champagne. The lesson isn't about deprivation, but about discovering new favorites that love us back: mint-infused waters, carefully balanced smoothies, or tart cherry juice that helps without harming.  

""Precision hydration."" ""Adaptive enjoyment.""  

Our cups runneth over—not with unlimited choices, but with hard-won wisdom about what truly nourishes us. In a world that often misunderstands our relationship with liquids, we've learned this profound truth: every safe sip is a small act of rebellion against our condition, a declaration that even within limits, we can still taste life's sweetness.

Environment wise this is currently a pretty sweet spot to chill in the morning, it's newly opened so everything is looking fresh and it's a fairly big restaurant with not much people around due to it limited breakfast menu. If you are not eating this burger you are eating fried chicken 10am in the morning. No judgement though. 

Also this place gets noisy with just a bit of people despite its size, get your eargear if you don't enjoy people chatter

TLDR: Good place to eat/drink a bit of something and chill in the morning, the coffee makes the 4.90sgd set worth it.

I’ve had her for 1 month now

She has gone to puppy pre-school(3 classes so far) and currently doing her first obedience class 
She currently knows:
Name, touch, sit, down, paw, come, drop

She does amazing in public places and is really well-behaved in restaurants/stores. I currently have 2 issues with her 

She likes to pull towards people and dogs. She is beyond social so I’m starting to implement touch boundaries so she learns it’s NOT okay to invade other’s spaces. When she does this she just goes into love bomb mode and licks peoples faces and even pees a bit 😅 for dogs it’s similar and she wants to play with them 

Now the bigger issue is I’ve noticed some reactivity at home and in the car. 
At home she seems to have become more alert to sounds and people. For example, she has started to bark when someone walks to the door but becomes docile up close. She occasionally barks at people that pass by when in the front yard. On car rides, she has started to occasionally bark at people (99% of the time she is either sleeping, playing with her toy or enjoying a snack) 

I do want to add I live in a neighborhood where not many people pass by the house nor do I get many visitors so I’ve been struggling in coming up with scenarios to practice this 

Does anyone have any tips on how to address this before they become a bigger issue? 
To add I really want to emphasize how amazing she does out in public. She does get excited at time but I’m able to feel her in with a fancy treat and always reward her calm behavior 

Currently: 
On Saturday’s she is going to puppy pre-school that focuses on safe play & adds desensitization activities 
Mondays obedience classes 

I take her with me almost everywhere right now such as coffee shops, walks and even shopping. I’ve emphasized doing 2-5 outings a week with her right now so she is exposed to different people, dogs and cats ",2,1746844510.0,reactivedogs,0,1.0,False

Here are the top 5 pastry shops to visit in the area.

Brunells is an adorable pastry shop with a modernist vibe that's a must-visit. They offer a variety of large and mini cakes, pastries, and croissants that will satisfy any sweet tooth. Try their mini lemon pie and sacher, they're to die for! 🍰👍 The shop has a small café where you can enjoy a coffee, but be prepared for crowds.

On the other side of Santa Maria del Mar, you'll find Bubo, a pastry shop known for its creative and imaginative treats. Their fruit-loaded coulants and award-winning chocolate croissants are a must-try. Bubo's ingredients and operations meet high standards, but it's a bit pricier than other shops. Worth it, though! 💸👌

If you're looking for a more traditional bakery experience, head to Hoffman. This internationally known bakery is a popular destination for tourists and is located off Passeig del Born. They offer a variety of traditional baked goods that are sure to please.

For breakfast, Funky Bakers is the spot. Try their borek, house bun with cream cheese, and desserts like chocolate chip cookies and chocolate Swiss rolls. It's the perfect place to grab a quick bite before 10 am. 🥐👍

Last but not least, Jon Cake is famous for its cheesecake, developed by an aerospace engineer. While it's pricey, the cheesecake is worth trying. Consider ordering a whole cake online to skip the long lines. 🍰👌

And if you're a cinnamon roll enthusiast, Demasie is a bonus pick worth trying. They specialize in cinnamon rolls with unique twists that will satisfy your cravings.

When visiting these pastry shops, be prepared for crowds, especially at Brunells and Jon Cake. But trust us, it's worth it! 😊 The Born neighborhood is a must-visit for pastry lovers, and with these top 5 recommendations, you'll be well on your way to a sweet adventure.

1kiznx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/1kiznx8/what_am_i_supposed_to_do_with_my_relationship/,What am I supposed to do with my relationship?,"I think the best way to go about this is to give a bit of context and then leave my thoughts below it. Any outside opinions will help me to figure things out. My circle over the past few years has become extremely small, so differing perspectives may help me a bit. 

I met my boyfriend about little over a year ago, and pretty much instantly, everything had clicked. We both became so in love with each other, and I felt in my heart that I met the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. He is very handsome, incredibly smart, and always knows how to make me laugh and put a smile on my face. Even to this day, he can just take one look at me and I still feel the butterflies I felt on the day we met. 

Having said this, he is a bit rough around the edges, is from Chicago and has bit of a mouth on him. He definitely is a little bit more introverted, likes the quiet and time solo. Thinks with his head and not his heart. Physical affection (hand holding, kissing, hugging), has never really been his strong suit. He has worked several factory jobs and others within that industry.

This is pretty much the opposite of how I am. I have been told that the soft skills (empathy, emotional intelligence, communication) are my strong suit. I also really do enjoy physical touch, kind words, and I could stay up all night and talk over a good cup of coffee. I care so much for the people in my life that I would do anything for them.

He is definitely left brain and I am right brain, and most of the time, I feel like it works well for us. Opposites attract and at times compliment very well. 

Now that I’ve gotten that out of the way, let me now explain why I’m posting in the AlAnon subreddit: 

2 weeks after we met, my boyfriend let me know that he would be spending a week in jail coming up within a couple of days. This was due to time he needed to serve for a DWAI. He let me know that he refused to blow when he got pulled over because he was scared, but he only had a couple of beers and then drove home from going to the bar. The judge was very tough on him, as she had lost her daughter to a drunk driving accident and has zero tolerance for it. But he swore up and down that it was a couple of beers, and that this was really just a mistake. His record was clean before this one incident (I checked). 

After being released from jail, he had to wear an ankle monitor for 10 months. So for the majority of our relationship, he was absolutely clean and sober, and he seemed unaffected by it. He got off his ankle monitor in November 2024. 

As we have moved along, we started to talk about life plans together (moving in, running away and getting married,etc.) Things were really really good. 

In January of 2025, I started getting really sick, and soon found out that I was expecting. I was about 6 weeks pregnant when I found out and I told him. I was scared and shocked, but I was happy. 

Shortly after finding out, he started to drink. A couple of beers to take the edge off quickly became an entire fifth of cinnamon whisky every evening. At first, I understood it a bit. This was a stressful time for us and if I could have drank I may have indulged in a couple of glasses of wine or two. But when he started to heavily drink, the alarm bells were going off, and I began to worry extremely.

(For a bit more context, I have generalized anxiety disorder, so I worry about quite a bit constantly, and this didn’t really help. I also have alcoholism that runs in my family and just lost my uncle in September of last year to it. So hopefully that helps to paint the picture of where my mind was at during this time). 

At 8 1/2 weeks, I miscarried. Initially I felt kind of relieved, physically for sure because of how sick I was, but also mentally, because I was scared of how this was all going to play out. I watched my uncle drink himself to death in my grandparents house during his last months, and leave behind my aunt and my two younger cousins. I will never forget that funeral, and it kept replaying over and over in my mind. 

After I miscarried, my boyfriend’s drinking became worse and worse. The last few months have been me trying to somehow pull him out of it, texting, calling, having him stay with me, somehow trying to tell him that he can just walk away. But it was all unsuccessful, and most likely enabling. And as he turned to the bottle, I turned to work as a distraction. We were both grieving, but not properly, and separately. Even though we were together on most weekends.

A few weeks ago, I drove him to the hospital to get checked out. He had two seizures on my watch in my apartment in the middle of a bender. It has been rough, and definitely not something that I am equipped to manage at any level. 

Ever since then, his sobriety and our relationship has been shaky. I have become extremely depressed, and don’t feel like I can go to him because I don’t want to stress him out. He has told me “When you’re stressed out, it makes me stressed out, because you’re a part of me, and I love you.” 
And because of how shaky his sobriety is, I’m not sure if bringing my emotions to him brings him anything but harm. Sober or not, he definitely doesn’t do well with the intricacies of emotion. He is a simple guy, likes to go to work, and come home. 

And I like that about him. His simplicity often eases my mind and makes me feel safe. That’s part of the reason I fell in love with him. He’s always calm, cool, and collected. And when I’m on a rollercoaster of emotion, it tends to center me. 

But now, I’m just a mess and I feel all over the place. I’m not sure what to do. I’ve been told by others because we’re not married or have children, I can walk away from this situation and do better for myself. But I don’t want to do that, he is my best friend and his been a light in the storm for me. 

But he has become a bit distant from me in the wake of all of this. My suspicion is because his is still drinking, a lot and heavily. And he knows that it hurts me. Tonight he said he doesn’t want to come over because he’s really tired, but all I can think about is if it’s because he wants to drink instead. 

I’m not sure what to do, and I never thought that I would find myself in this position. And it hurts, so bad. In all of this, grieving my miscarriage has been very difficult to. I’m in therapy, and I am planning on attending an Al Anon meeting soon. 

Any thoughts will be helpful and welcome, thank you..
My timeline may be a bit off as well, it’s has been a whirlwind of a year so far, so I’ll be happy to answer any questions or fill in any gaps.

1kizl7i,https://youtu.be/ilRAhxM_g-g,3 True and Frightening Summer Crime Horror Stories,"**""The Summer That Stole Sylvia"":**

It was the summer of 1965, and Indianapolis felt like it was holding its breath under a heavy, sticky heat. I was 14, a gangly kid with sunburned cheeks and a bike I rode up and down East New York Street until the streetlights flickered on. Our neighborhood was alive with the sounds of kids shouting, sprinklers hissing, and radios blaring from open windows. Next door, Mrs. Baniszewski’s house was the place to be. She was a wiry woman with sharp cheekbones and a voice that could cut through a crowd. Her place was always packed—her own kids, plus strays like me, drawn by the chaos and the fact that she didn’t care if we snuck her cigarettes or sipped flat beer from cans she left in the fridge. It felt like freedom, like we were untouchable. Then Sylvia and Jenny Likens moved in, and that summer turned into something I’ll never shake.Sylvia was 16, with long, wavy hair that shimmered in the sunlight and a smile that made you feel like you were in on a secret. She had this way of tilting her head when she laughed, like she was savoring every second. Jenny, a year younger, was quieter, her steps uneven from an old injury that left her with a brace on one leg. Their parents were carnival workers, always on the road, and they’d paid Mrs. Baniszewski to watch the girls while they traveled. At first, it was like they’d always been part of our crew. We’d sprawl on the patchy grass in her backyard, spitting watermelon seeds into the dirt, or pile onto bikes and race to the park, Sylvia’s laughter trailing behind us. She’d tell us stories about the carnival—bright lights, cotton candy, and rides that made your stomach flip. I thought she was the coolest girl I’d ever met.But by mid-July, something shifted. I started noticing Sylvia looking worn out, like she hadn’t slept. One day, I saw her rubbing her arm, where a bruise bloomed like a dark flower under her sleeve. We were sitting on the Baniszewskis’ sagging porch, the air thick with the smell of cut grass and gasoline from a neighbor’s lawnmower. “Sylvia, what’s with your arm?” I asked, keeping my voice low so the other kids wouldn’t hear. She tugged her sleeve down fast, her fingers trembling. “Oh, you know me, always tripping over my own feet,” she said, forcing a smile. But her eyes darted toward the house, and I saw fear there, quick and sharp. I wanted to ask more, but Mrs. Baniszewski’s shadow passed by the screen door, and Sylvia clammed up.Things got bad fast. One sweltering afternoon in early August, I was in the Baniszewskis’ kitchen, the linoleum sticky under my sneakers. Sylvia was at the sink, scrubbing dishes in water so hot it turned her hands pink. The radio was playing some twangy song, and a couple of kids were sprawled on the floor, flipping through comics. Mrs. Baniszewski burst in, her face red and twisted. She held up an empty coffee can, the kind she stashed loose change in. “You little thief!” she screamed at Sylvia. “You took my money, didn’t you?” Sylvia dropped a plate, and it clattered into the sink. “I didn’t, Mrs. Baniszewski, I swear!” she said, her voice high and desperate. “Don’t lie to me!” Mrs. Baniszewski grabbed Sylvia’s hair, yanking her head back so hard I flinched. She dragged her to the living room and shoved her into a corner. “Stand there and don’t move. Not a word, you hear me?”Sylvia stood like a statue, her shoulders hunched, for hours. The other kids avoided looking at her, and I felt my stomach churn. I wanted to say something, but Mrs. Baniszewski was pacing, muttering, her eyes wild. She scared me—scared all of us. That night, I heard shouting through my bedroom window, and the next day, Sylvia wasn’t at breakfast. I found Jenny in the backyard, picking at a dandelion. “Where’s Sylvia?” I asked. Jenny’s face went pale. “Gertrude locked her in the basement,” she whispered. “Said she’s gotta learn her lesson.” I peeked through the basement window later, just a slit at ground level, and saw Sylvia sitting on the concrete floor, her knees pulled up, staring into the dark. I felt like I was choking.The basement became Sylvia’s world. Mrs. Baniszewski said Sylvia was “trouble,” and we were too afraid to question her. One day, she gathered us in the kitchen, the air heavy with sweat and cigarette smoke. Sylvia stood in the middle, her arms shaking as she held a bulky radio above her head. Her face was pale, sweat dripping down her temples. “If she drops it, you hit her,” Mrs. Baniszewski said, passing out belts to me, Ricky, and a couple of her own kids. Ricky, my best friend, leaned close, his voice barely a breath. “This is messed up, man.” But when Sylvia’s arms buckled and the radio dipped, Mrs. Baniszewski snapped, “Now!” I swung the belt, the leather cracking against Sylvia’s thighs. She gasped, tears streaming down her face, but we kept going, each hit making me hate myself more. Mrs. Baniszewski stood there, arms crossed, a sick smile on her lips. Sylvia’s cries followed me home that night, and I threw up in my bathroom, the taste of bile burning my throat.By September, the house felt like it was rotting from the inside. The summer heat hadn’t let up, but the laughter was gone. Sylvia was rarely upstairs, and when I saw her, she was a ghost of herself—skinny, with red burns dotting her arms and legs, her hair matted. I heard whispers from other kids that Mrs. Baniszewski had burned her with cigarettes, saying it was “discipline.” Worse, they said she’d taken a hot needle and carved “I am a prostitute” into Sylvia’s stomach. I couldn’t bring myself to look, but one day, I saw Sylvia limping across the hall, clutching her side, her face twisted in pain. Jenny wasn’t spared either, though it was never as bad. I caught her alone by the fence one evening, the sky streaked with pink. “Jenny, why’s Gertrude doing this?” I asked, my voice shaking. She wiped her eyes, her brace creaking as she shifted. “It started ‘cause she thought Sylvia stole. But now? It’s like she enjoys it. She makes us watch, says it’s to teach us.” Her voice broke. “I’m scared she’ll kill her.”I talked to Ricky that night, sitting on my front steps, the air buzzing with crickets. “We gotta do something,” I said, my fists clenched. “Sylvia’s dying in there.” Ricky’s face was tight, his eyes on the ground. “I know, but Gertrude’s unhinged. You saw what she did to Sylvia for talking back. What if she turns on us? Or our moms?” I wanted to be the hero, to march in and save Sylvia, but fear was a weight on my chest. One night, I saw Sylvia try to escape, her thin frame slipping through the back door. She was so weak she could barely stand, her bare feet catching on the grass. Mrs. Baniszewski caught her before she reached the street, dragging her back by the arm. The screams that night were different—raw, like something breaking. I hid under my covers, my heart pounding so hard I thought it’d burst.October came, and Sylvia vanished from sight. Mrs. Baniszewski said she was “sick,” but her voice was flat, like she was reading a script. The house smelled wrong, like damp and decay, and I couldn’t shake the dread crawling up my spine. I had to know. One afternoon, when Mrs. Baniszewski was at the store, I snuck in through the back door, my sneakers silent on the creaky floor. Upstairs, in a cramped bedroom, I found Sylvia on a mattress stained with God-knows-what. She was barely human—her body skeletal, skin covered in sores, bruises, and burns. Her face was swollen, one eye nearly shut, her lips cracked and bleeding. “Sylvia?” I whispered, my voice catching. She stirred, her eyes fluttering open. “Help… please,” she rasped, so faint I barely heard it. I stumbled back, my chest tight, and ran home.I grabbed the phone, my hands shaking so bad I dropped the receiver twice. “Police, you gotta come,” I stammered when they answered. “Sylvia Likens is at the Baniszewski house, and she’s hurt real bad. I think she’s dying.” They told me to stay put, but I went back, hiding across the street until the cops pulled up. They carried Sylvia out, her body limp, and I knew before they said it—she was gone. She died in the ambulance, too broken to hold on.The neighborhood exploded. Police swarmed the house, and Mrs. Baniszewski was arrested, along with some of her kids and a few others, even kids I’d played tag with. The trial was like peeling back the skin of our street, showing the ugliness underneath. Three months of torture—beatings, burns, starvation, all because of a woman who turned her hate into a game. I had to stand in court, my voice shaking as I admitted I’d hit Sylvia, too scared to say no. Mrs. Baniszewski got life, though I heard she got out later. The kids got less time, being young, but it didn’t feel like justice.That summer is a scar I carry. I see Sylvia’s smile in my dreams, hear her cries when it’s quiet. I was just a kid, but I should’ve been braver, done more. Evil isn’t always loud or obvious—it can be a neighbor’s house, a place you thought was safe. I tell Sylvia’s story now, my voice still shaky, because she deserves to be remembered. Maybe it’ll make someone else speak up, stop something before it’s too late. That summer broke me, but it made me promise to never look away again.





**""Summer of Shadows"":**

I’m Sean, and the summer of 1985 was my first as a police officer in Kansas City. I was 23, fresh from training, and the city was like a furnace, the heat so thick it clung to your skin. The streets pulsed with danger—sirens, shouts, and shadows that hid trouble. I was paired with Joe, a veteran cop with a weathered face and a voice like gravel. That summer was a string of moments so terrifying they still creep into my thoughts, waking me at night. This is my story, real as it gets, no ghosts or magic—just the raw fear of the job.It started on June 10, my first day. The air was heavy, like breathing through a wet cloth, and my new uniform was already damp with sweat. At the station, Joe sized me up, his eyes sharp under his cap. “Ready for the real world, kid?” he asked, his grin half-teasing, half-serious. I nodded, my stomach churning like I’d swallowed a stone. I’d trained for this, but nothing prepares you for the real thing.Our first call came before noon—a fight at a house on Elm Street. The place was crumbling, its white paint flaking like dead skin, one window boarded, another cracked. Angry voices spilled out, sharp and loud. A woman answered our knock, her cheek swollen purple, her eyes darting like a trapped animal’s. “He’s in there,” she whispered, pointing down a dim hallway. Her hands shook as she hugged herself. Joe led the way, his hand resting on his holster, his steps sure. I followed, my pulse hammering in my ears.In the living room, a man loomed, broad-shouldered and red-faced, clutching a beer bottle. The room smelled of stale smoke and spilled liquor. “Who called you?” he bellowed, stepping closer. Joe stayed calm, his voice low but firm. “Sir, let’s take this outside and talk.” The man laughed, a harsh, ugly sound, and tossed the bottle onto a stained couch. “You got no business here,” he spat, moving toward us. I tensed, my hand twitching toward my gun, but Joe didn’t blink. “Outside, now,” he said, sharp enough to cut. The man glared, his jaw tight, but he shuffled out. We cuffed him on the porch as he muttered complaints, his breath sour. The woman stood in the doorway, tears streaking her face. “You okay, ma’am?” I asked, my voice softer than I meant. She nodded, barely, her eyes on the ground. I felt unsteady, like the world had tilted. Joe clapped my shoulder. “First one’s always rough, Sean. You’ll get the hang of it.”A few weeks later, in mid-July, we got a call about gunshots on Oak Avenue. It was past midnight, the heat still oppressive, streetlights casting weak yellow pools on the pavement. The radio crackled: “Man down, 2300 block. Suspect fled.” We raced over, sirens wailing, the city a blur of dark buildings. On the sidewalk, a young man lay sprawled, his white shirt dark with blood, his hands clutching his side. His eyes were wide, glassy with panic, darting between me and the sky. “Help me,” he gasped, his voice thin, his fingers grabbing my sleeve. Blood smeared my hand, warm and sticky. “They ran… that way,” he said, pointing to a black alley. Joe scanned it, his flashlight cutting through the dark, but it was empty, just trash and shadows. “Hold on, man,” I said, pressing my hands to his wound, my voice shaking. “Help’s coming.” His grip weakened, his breaths shallow. The ambulance arrived, paramedics rushing in, but his terrified face burned into my mind. We searched the alley later, finding only a dropped shoe, no shooter. I kept seeing his eyes, like he knew he might not make it.Early August brought a call that still turns my stomach. A neighbor reported a foul smell from a house on Maple Street. The air was so thick it felt like wading through syrup, the sun baking the cracked pavement. The house was a wreck—sagging roof, windows boarded with warped plywood, weeds choking the yard. The smell hit us at the door, a wall of rot so strong my eyes watered. Joe grimaced, pulling his collar over his nose. “This is bad, kid,” he said, his voice muffled.Inside, the house was a maze of clutter—stacked newspapers, broken furniture, and sticky floors that crunched underfoot. The air was stale, mixed with that awful smell, growing stronger as we moved. Flies buzzed, thick and lazy. The basement door was ajar, a black gap swallowing the light. My flashlight trembled as we descended narrow, creaking stairs. At the bottom, rats exploded into motion, their claws scraping concrete, their bodies a writhing mass in the shadows. I gagged, my throat tight. In the corner, lit by my shaky beam, was a body—shrunken, decayed, impossible to identify. Maggots crawled over it, white and pulsing, like the corpse was alive with them. The smell was a physical thing, coating my tongue. I stumbled back, but Joe grabbed my arm. “Focus, Sean. Call it in.” My hands fumbled with the radio, my voice cracking as I reported it. Later, we learned it was an old man, dead for weeks, forgotten by the world. I still smell that basement in my nightmares, feel the rats’ eyes watching me.Mid-August, we chased two guys who hit a gas station on 7th Street. It was dusk, the sky a deep red, the air still hot. The radio buzzed: “Armed robbery, suspects fleeing.” We spotted them darting into an alley, two figures in dark hoodies. “Police! Stop!” Joe shouted, his voice echoing off brick walls. They kept running, footsteps pounding. I sprinted, my lungs burning, the world narrowing to the guy in front of me. I tackled him, hitting the ground hard, gravel biting my knees. “Get off me!” he yelled, twisting under me. I cuffed him, my hands shaking, adrenaline buzzing. As we hauled him to the car, I glanced across the street. A man stood there, lean and still, watching us. His smile was slow, cold, like he was memorizing my face. My skin crawled. I blinked, and he was gone, melted into the crowd. “You see that guy?” I asked Joe. He frowned. “What guy?” That smile haunted me, like a warning I couldn’t read.Late August, a woman called, sobbing about her brother. The house was small, its yard a jungle of tall grass, the paint chipped to gray. She met us at the door, her face streaked with tears. “He’s in the basement, tied up!” she cried, clutching my arm. We followed her to a door, the air turning damp and sour. The basement was a pit—dark, with a smell like wet earth and rot. My flashlight caught rats, dozens of them, scurrying over crates and pipes, their eyes glinting red. In the far corner, a man was bound to a chair, duct tape over his mouth, his face pale and sweaty. His eyes locked on mine, wide with terror. Joe cut the ropes, his knife flashing, while I stood guard, gun drawn, watching the stairs. “You’re okay now,” I told the man, my voice thin. He nodded, trembling, unable to speak. The woman’s ex had done it, she said, out of spite. We arrested him later, but the memory of those rats, their claws clicking, and the man’s helpless eyes stayed with me.In September, the heat still lingering, we got a call about a guy on a bridge over the river. It was night, the water below catching glints of city lights. He was young, maybe my age, standing on the edge, his shoulders hunched, tears shining on his cheeks. Joe hung back, but I stepped closer, my boots loud on the pavement. “I’m Sean,” I said, keeping my voice gentle. “What’s your name?”“Mike,” he said, his voice breaking, hands gripping the rail. “I can’t do this anymore.”“I hear you,” I said, my heart racing. “It’s heavy, I know. But you’re not alone. Tell me what’s going on.” His eyes met mine, raw and searching. I talked—about the humid night, my long shift, a diner I liked—anything to keep him there. For 20 minutes, I kept going, my voice steady even as my hands shook. Slowly, he stepped back, his shoulders sagging. Joe moved in, guiding him down, and we got him to a hospital. I felt a rush of relief, but also fear. What if I’d said the wrong thing? That moment stayed with me, fragile and heavy.By summer’s end, I was different. Tougher, maybe, but fear was a constant shadow, trailing me on every call. Joe saw it. “You held up, kid,” he said one day, tossing me a cold soda from a corner store. “But it don’t leave you.” He was right. Every dark alley, every sudden radio call, felt like it could be the end.That summer taught me fear isn’t just a gun or a chase—it’s the weight of what you see, the faces you can’t forget. I still hear the rats’ claws, see that man’s creepy smile, feel Mike’s despair. I’m telling you this like I’m sitting across from you, because it happened, and it’s part of me.





**""Eyes in the Vent"":**

It was the summer of 1995, and I was ten years old, sprawled on the living room floor of our small suburban house. The air was heavy, so thick with heat it felt like breathing syrup. My T-shirt stuck to my back, and the old oscillating fan in the corner just pushed warm air around, its hum blending with the distant chirp of crickets outside. The windows were wide open, sheer curtains fluttering lazily, letting in the faint smell of cut grass and barbecue from somewhere down the street. My little sister, Sarah, seven years old, was curled up on the couch, her blonde pigtails messy, clutching her favorite Barbie doll. She was half-asleep, her eyelids fluttering as the TV played a rerun of some cartoon about talking dogs.Mom and Dad were out at the neighbors’ barbecue, just a few houses down. They’d left me in charge for the first time, which made me feel grown-up but also a little scared. “You’re a big girl, Emily,” Mom had said, tucking a strand of my brown hair behind my ear. “We’ll be back by nine. Call Mrs. Larson next door if you need anything, okay?” Dad had handed me the cordless phone, pointing at the emergency numbers taped to the fridge. I nodded, trying to look confident, but as their car pulled out of the driveway, the house felt too big, too quiet.I tried to focus on the TV, the colorful characters yapping away, but my eyes kept wandering around the room. The living room was cozy, with a worn plaid couch, a coffee table covered in Sarah’s crayon drawings, and Mom’s collection of ceramic figurines on a shelf. Above me, in the ceiling, was a big metal vent, part of the air system that ran through the attic. It was old, its slats rusted, and sometimes it rattled when the air conditioning kicked on. But the AC was off tonight—too expensive to run all the time, Dad said—so the vent was silent. Or it should’ve been.Around 7:30, as the sky outside turned a deep orange, I heard a sound—a faint scratching, like fingernails dragging across wood. It came from the ceiling, right above the vent. I sat up, my heart giving a little jump. “Probably a squirrel,” I muttered to myself. We’d had one get into the attic last spring, and Dad had to set traps. I glanced at Sarah, who was still dozing, her Barbie slipping from her hand. The scratching came again, sharper, like something bigger than a squirrel shifting around. I stood, brushing my hands on my shorts, and stared at the vent, squinting to see into the dark slats.“Sarah,” I whispered, nudging her shoulder. She groaned, rubbing her eyes with a fist. “Wake up. Do you hear that?”She blinked, sitting up slowly. “Hear what?” she mumbled, her voice thick with sleep.“That noise. It’s coming from the ceiling.”We both tilted our heads back, staring at the vent. The scratching stopped, and for a moment, the only sound was the fan’s steady whir and the cartoon dog barking on TV. I let out a breath, thinking maybe I’d imagined it. Then I saw something that turned my insides to ice. In the vent’s slats, where the dim light from the living room lamp barely reached, there was a glint—like eyes catching the glow. My breath caught, and I stepped closer, my bare feet cold on the hardwood floor. I climbed onto the coffee table, careful not to knock over Sarah’s juice cup, and peered up.That’s when I saw them: a pair of human eyes, wide and unblinking, staring straight down at me. They were bloodshot, set in a pale face half-hidden by shadows. My scream ripped through the room, loud and sharp, and I stumbled off the table, landing hard on my knees. Sarah woke fully, her eyes wide with panic. “Emily, what’s wrong? What’s wrong?” she cried, clutching her doll to her chest.“There’s someone in the ceiling!” I gasped, my voice shaking so bad I could barely get the words out. My heart was pounding, like it wanted to burst out of my chest. I grabbed Sarah’s hand, yanking her off the couch, and we ran to the kitchen, my socks sliding on the floor. The kitchen was open to the living room, no door to close, but it felt safer somehow, farther from that vent. I snatched the cordless phone from the counter, my hands trembling so much I fumbled the buttons, misdialing twice before getting 911.“911, what’s your emergency?” a woman’s voice answered, calm and steady.“There’s a man in our house!” I blurted, tears burning my eyes. “He’s in the ceiling, in the vent, watching us! Please, you have to help!”“Okay, sweetheart, stay calm,” the operator said. “What’s your name?”“Emily,” I said, my voice cracking. Sarah was pressed against me, sobbing into my side, her Barbie dangling by one leg.“Alright, Emily, where are you right now?”“In the kitchen. My sister’s with me. Our parents aren’t home.”“Do you know your address?”I rattled off our street name and house number, my mind racing. I kept glancing at the living room, at the vent, expecting to see those eyes again—or worse, a face pushing through. “He’s in the attic,” I added. “I saw his eyes through the vent.”“You’re doing great, Emily,” the operator said. “I’m sending police to your house right now. Can you stay where you are? Is there a door you can lock?”“No,” I said, my throat tight. “The kitchen’s open. There’s no door.”“That’s okay. Just stay on the phone with me. Are you and your sister safe where you are?”“I think so,” I whispered, but I didn’t feel safe. Sarah was shaking, her breath hitching. “Is he gonna get us?” she whimpered, her big blue eyes searching my face.“No,” I said, squeezing her hand, trying to sound sure. “The police are coming. We’re gonna be okay.” But my stomach was twisting, and I couldn’t stop picturing those eyes.“Emily,” the operator said, “can you still see the man? Is he still in the vent?”“I don’t know,” I said. “I’m not in the living room anymore. But I saw him. He was looking right at me.”Before the operator could reply, a new sound made my blood run cold—a low, raspy voice, coming from the direction of the vent. “Emily,” it said, slow and deliberate. “It’s okay. I’m not going to hurt you.”I dropped the phone, a scream catching in my throat. Sarah wailed, and I pulled her down behind the kitchen counter, my heart hammering so loud I could hear it in my ears. The phone skidded across the floor, the operator’s voice faint now. “Emily? Emily, are you there?”“He knows my name,” I whispered, my whole body trembling. How did he know my name? Had he been listening to us? Watching us for days? The thought made my skin crawl, like bugs were skittering over me. I grabbed Sarah tighter, her sobs muffled against my shoulder. “Shh, Sarah, we have to be quiet,” I whispered.I reached for the phone, my fingers shaking as I pulled it back. “He’s talking to me,” I told the operator, my voice barely audible. “He said my name. He said he’s not gonna hurt me.”“Stay hidden, Emily,” the operator said, her voice still calm but firmer now. “The police are almost at your street. They’ll be there any minute. Just hold on.”Those minutes felt like years. Sarah and I crouched behind the counter, the linoleum cold against my legs. I kept waiting for the vent to creak open, for footsteps to thud above us, for that voice to call my name again. The cartoon was still playing in the living room, the cheerful music so out of place it made everything feel like a bad dream. I clutched the phone, listening to the operator’s steady voice. “You’re doing so well, Emily. The police are pulling up now. You’ll see their lights soon.”Finally, I heard sirens, faint at first, then louder, cutting through the summer night. Red and blue lights flashed through the kitchen window, painting the walls with color. There was a loud knock at the front door. “Police! Open the door!” a man’s voice shouted.I scrambled to my feet, dragging Sarah with me, and ran to the door. My hands were so sweaty I could barely turn the lock. When I swung the door open, two officers stood there, their flashlights bright in the dusk. One was tall with a thick mustache, his badge glinting. The other was shorter, with kind eyes and a gentle voice. “Hi, Emily,” the shorter one said. “I’m Officer Davis. This is Officer Thompson. Can you tell us what happened?”“There’s a man in the ceiling,” I said, pointing toward the living room. “In the vent. He was watching us. He knew my name.”Officer Davis nodded, his face serious. “Okay, you and your sister stay here with Officer Thompson. I’m going inside to check it out.” He pulled out his flashlight and stepped into the house, his radio crackling as he called for backup.Officer Thompson knelt down, his mustache twitching as he smiled at Sarah. “You girls are safe now, alright? We’re here.” Sarah nodded, still clutching her Barbie, but she didn’t stop shaking.We stood on the porch, the warm night air wrapping around us, as more police cars pulled up. Neighbors were starting to peek out, their silhouettes dark against porch lights. I heard shouting inside, then a loud thud, like something heavy hitting the floor. My stomach twisted, and I gripped Sarah’s hand tighter. A few minutes later, Officer Davis came out, wiping sweat from his forehead. “We got him,” he said. “You’re safe now, Emily.”They brought out a man in handcuffs, and the sight of him made my breath catch. He was skinny, almost skeletal, with matted hair and a scruffy beard. His clothes were filthy, stained with dirt and sweat, and his eyes darted around, avoiding us. He looked like he hadn’t eaten or slept in weeks. The officers led him to a police car, his hands cuffed behind his back, and I heard one of them say, “Found him in the attic, hiding in the insulation.”Officer Davis knelt in front of me, his voice soft. “He was living up there, Emily. Looks like he’s been in your attic a few days. You did the right thing calling us. You’re really brave.”“How did he know my name?” I asked, my voice small. The question had been burning in my mind, making my skin prickle.Officer Davis sighed, glancing at the police car. “He probably heard you and your sister talking. Maybe heard your parents call your name. We’ll find out more when we question him, okay? But he’s not coming back here.”Mom and Dad got home minutes later, their car screeching into the driveway. Mom’s face was white as she ran to us, dropping her purse on the grass. “Emily! Sarah!” she cried, pulling us into a hug so tight it hurt. “Oh my God, are you okay?” Her voice was shaking, and I felt her tears on my cheek.Dad was talking to the police, his hands clenched into fists. “How did he get in?” he kept asking, his voice loud. Officer Davis explained they found a loose board in the attic access, hidden behind some boxes in the garage. The man had been sneaking in and out, using our attic as a hideout.Later, they told us more. The man was homeless, moving between houses in our neighborhood, crawling into attics to sleep and steal food. In our house, they found a tattered sleeping bag, empty soup cans, and a few of Sarah’s missing hair ties stashed in a corner of the attic. He’d been watching us through the vents, listening to our conversations, learning our names. The police said he’d done this in other houses too, but we were the first to catch him.That summer changed everything. Mom and Dad installed new locks and a security system, and Dad nailed the attic access shut, swearing he’d never let anyone in again. They didn’t leave us alone at night for a long time after that. But even with the locks and alarms, I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched. I stopped sitting in the living room, avoided looking at the ceiling. At night, I’d lie in bed, staring at the vent in my bedroom, wondering if I’d see eyes again.For months, I had nightmares—those bloodshot eyes staring from the dark, that raspy voice saying my name. I’d wake up screaming, and Mom would rush in, holding me until I calmed down. Even now, years later, a strange noise in the house makes my heart race, and I’m ten years old again, standing on that coffee table, staring into the vent on a sticky summer night, realizing someone was staring back.

What the heck!? His voice sliced through the room like a whip. I blinked, heat rising to my cheeks as every eye in the conference room swung to me. My hands trembled slightly around the coffee tray, but I held onto it like my life depended on it.

Luca Steele stood at the head of the long glass table, tall, lethal, and entirely too composed for a man who’d just been drenched in a splash of boiling cappuccino. Steam still rose from his tailored black suit, but his steel-gray eyes were colder than ice.
