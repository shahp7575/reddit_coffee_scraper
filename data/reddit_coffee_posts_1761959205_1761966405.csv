I have taken it and feel like I can handle things in life easier. Like work and emotions. Although I‚Äôm not sure how much of this is placebo vs actual, I guess time will tell. One question I had is how do you know the meds are working for you and good for you? For me I was told by a friend that I would feel like I took 1000mg of coffee (not coffee drinker) but I don‚Äôt feel jittery at all. I also just feel quiet mind and more focus and more social and more ready to take on things. I was told to be wary of crashout energy at end of day and TBD on this as I haven‚Äôt been able to sleep from being out- I feel less of a desire for this though so I‚Äôm writing this as I leave the party early lol. I think I‚Äôm gonna have a monk mode experience as I feel calmer, I stay full all day, currently one meal a day, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll adjust later but any advice on any of this particularly the knowing if meds are working and also if it impacts limbido in anyway ",1,1761966291.0,VyvanseADHD,0,1.0,False

I romanced Lucanis in my second playthrough of DAVeilguard. His special date dessert had hazelnuts. IRL me loves hazelnuts. 

Was it spendy af? Yup. A bag of hazelnuts was like $8 and eight MF eggs
Did I dirty every fish to make it? Absolutely. The electric beater was used three times
Did I do it right? I don't know...
Is it lopsided? Yes
Was I impatient with the icing and it got everywhere? Uh-huh.
Is it delicious anyway? Yes!
Did I eat it with tea, earl grey, hot, since I told Lucanis I preferred tea to coffee? In my star trek mug and everything.

1oldhdu,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZZZ_Discussion/comments/1oldhdu/i_despise_how_oppressively_small_the_hubs_areas/,I despise how oppressively small the hubs areas in this game are [Long Rant],"In Sixth Street, you walk a mere 20 feet in any direction and you've hit an invisble wall. You look beyond and you can see the city stretching beyond the wall, but you can't go there yourself. You look around and see innumerable NPCs casually walking past this invisible wall into the world beyond, but you can't. You feel like you're in a prison cell, looking out the barred window and seeing other NPCs getting to actually roam the city but you're trapped in a tiny little box that is Sixth street. Forever. 

This is true of every hub area in this game. Every area we go to, what we get to roam around in is an extremely tiny little hub. Worse? There's nothing to even DO in these hubs. No secrets to find, they aren't layered so that they at the very least make good use of the space (like no higher areas or underground areas), they're completely 1 dimensional. Just a tiny a flat area with NOTHING of note in it. Literally NOTHING of value in any of these zone besides the daily stuff like the scratch cards or coffee shops. Riveting.

You know when they first announced, all the way back in early 1.0, that we'd be going to the Outer Ring, I was excited, finally we'd be going somewhere new and exciting, an open, lawless region beyond the city's walls. Cool. Well when I finally got there I find this entire region is boiled down to a tiny little hub like every other area before it. In fact, we have never gotten to actually explore the Outer Ring, we've been entirely confined to that small little ""town"" (if you can call this little 20 square foot area a town), the rest of the Outer Ring we get to see is entirely confined to hollows, aka the battle areas, which of course are glorified corridors. And then the same thing happened again with 2.0, they hyped up Waifei as this excited new chinese district, and what have we experienced of this ""district"" thus far? Yes, just another tiny little instanced hub area like everywhere else. I'm already sick of walking the same tiny little area every day, sick of looking beyond the invisible wall and seeing NPCs get to actually wander beyond the barrier and roam the district while I'm confined to this tiny little space. Like every other area in the game.

You know what's absolutely insane, what's utterly mindmoggling? We, as Belle/Wise, own a car. Except.....we can't actually drive our car. The car is functionally a teleport beacon, we walk up to it, click on it, and it opens the map allowing us to fast-travel to other locations. But we don't actually DRIVE there, sure a sound effect of a car engine revving up is heard, but it's just a fade-to-black and then you're instantly there. And what's more deranged about this? YOU DON""T EVEN NEED TO USE YOUR CAR TO FAST TRAVEL, you can just open the map ANYWHERE IN THE GAME and fast travel to any location. Same with the subway train, they couldn't even have an optional immersive ride experience where we get to actually see the character we're playing get on the train and ride it all the way to the destination. Nope the ""train"" is just a glorified fast travel beacon too.

I have played countless games in my time, and never in my life have I ever played a game with such pathetically tiny ""zones"" as ZZZ. You cannot even argue that it's done for mobile purposes, because other gachas like Genshin (made by the same company) run fine on mobile despite having a massive open world. Hell Genshin even uses the same engine as ZZZ.  AND YET ZZZ SOMEHOW RUNS WORSE ON MOBILE DESPITE THE LACK OF OPEN WORLD. What is this game's excuse? Is it a deliberate choice to make the world just a collection of tiny instanced hubs with nothing in them, or is it an engine problem? I don't understand. I feel like I'm in a bloody prison, I want to explore New Eridu, and I never will because for some unknown reason the devs wanted this to this way. Why should I get excited about wherever we're going next for 3.0 and beyond? This isn't Genshin, this isn't WuWa, we're not actually going anywhere exciting, we're just going to the next tiny instanced hub with nothing to do in it that we'll spend a whole year in. How have they not at least TRIED to make larger,more interesting areas with shit to actually DO in them? Where is the exploration? Where are the minigames (like going to a gym to workout, or playing basketball in a courtyard, or riding a ferris wheel (maybe with your favorite proxy)). ANYTHING that makes use of this world's setting in fun ways. Oh cool, you can ""kick"" that rubber ball in Sixth Street by running into it (why they coded these physics and did nothing else with them is beyond my comprehension), that's it.

This entire game is some of the most depressing wasted potential I've seen in recent memory. Why did they even make an urban-setting game if they didn't want to actually make any use of the setting in any meaningful way? Welp, back to my instanced arena battle slop, because that's why I came to play an RPG with an urban setting: to fight monsters in instanced arena's (said instanced arenas being in literal supernatural hellscapes completely divorced from said urban setting btw, such that if all you do in the game is these instanced arena battles you may eventually forget that this IS, in fact, meant to be an urban RPG setting)!",0,1761965933.0,ZZZ_Discussion,4,0.22,False

My (female) college roommate and best friend for entirety of college (also female) starts dating my cousin (male), they fall in love, she spends all her time with him, it causes the normal friend problems, if not just a tad more weird because of the family aspect. After college, cousin gets friend pregnant. Causes family drama bc it‚Äôs out of wedlock (I truly couldn‚Äôt care less, I am a woman who dates other women), this then causes friendship issues. There were problems and ‚Äúbetrayal‚Äù from both sides. Looking back, it was petty stuff. It just hurt more because of the family aspect. We were 22 and immature. To wrap it all up, I am estranged from that part of the family (my cousin, his brother, my aunt, my college ‚Äúbest friend,‚Äù all of them) and tonight I saw my cousin, my college friend, their TWO kids (it‚Äôs been a few years and they had another kid), my friends mom and her sister. We didn‚Äôt speak, we smiled at each other and continued on. My cousin ignored me (he‚Äôs a dick) and that was that. 

I truly miss this friendship and I think things went further than they ever should have. We were all a close knit group. Family and otherwise. Should I reach out? Ask my friend to maybe go get coffee or lunch? It‚Äôs literally been YEARS. We‚Äôre almost 30, but we spent every waking moment together for a huge part of our lives, and seeing her today just made that realization all the more real. I don‚Äôt want to regret not reaching out.

Hey everyone,

Ever feel like you're trying to steer a giant ship with a tiny rudder? That's what ""optimizing your life"" can feel like sometimes. We see all these massive goals, but the day-to-day part feels overwhelming.

Lately, I've been focusing on the small hinges that swing big doors. It's not about overhauling your entire existence overnight. It's about the tiny, almost *stupidly simple* tweaks that have a massive ripple effect.

Here are a few that have been game-changers for me:

*   **The ""One-Touch"" Rule.** This is for all my fellow clutter-bugs (physical or digital). If you pick something up, deal with it completely. Put the dish in the dishwasher, don't leave it by the sink. Answer the email, don't just mark it as ""to-do."" It's amazing how much mental energy this frees up.

*   **Front-Load Your Water.** Instead of trying to ""catch up"" on hydration all day, I chug a big glass of water *right* after I wake up. Before coffee, before my phone. It kickstarts my system and makes me feel instantly more alert. My brain just works better. It's a tiny win before the day has even started.

*   **Curate Your ""Input.""** Think about it: we're constantly consuming stuff. Podcasts, music, social media, news. For one week, I made a conscious effort to only listen to uplifting or educational content on my commute. The shift in my mood and mindset was undeniable. You are what you eat, and that includes what you feed your brain.

Of course, growth isn't just about productivity hacks. Sometimes the biggest thing holding us back is our own emotional baggage or a lack of a clear mental framework. It's not always about *doing* more, but *feeling* better so you *can* do more. For anyone struggling with the emotional side of self-improvement, having a structured plan can be a game-changer. I found **this resource (affiliate link)** really helpful for getting my head straight when I felt stuck.

Ultimately, these small hacks build momentum. They prove to your brain that you're in control and that progress is possible. That feeling is what leads to real, lasting change.

What's one ""easy hack"" that's completely changed the game for you? Let's get a list going. ü§ò",2,1761964789.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Currently, you can buy gold through Glint, which they store in Switzerland, get a debit card from them, and you can make purchases with the debit card.

The last couple of videos I have watched from Peter Schiff, he is talking about setting up the same thing; buy gold which his company will store, and you'll be issued a debit card. He's also discussing peer-to-peer transfers of gold from one person to another.

Finally, the state of Texas is setting up a precious metals depository, and has recently passed legislation making gold and silver legal tender. I suspect (but can't verify) that they may be making plans to issue debit cards for these PM deposits.

In the event of a currency collapse, I think that gold-backed debit cards may be the way we end up getting by until things settle down, rather than shaving off pieces of gold like they do in Venezuela. Or, both may happen.

Thoughts?

Since having our daughter I guess I have ramped up on the questions I ask because a lot of stuff just doesn't make sense to me. Like.. she knew certain foods would make the baby gassy and chose to eat them anyways (our daughter is breastfed, still is). So I would simply ask her why she is choosing to eat something that she knew would cause our daughter discomfort. Or if she decided to have more than one beer when we were out socially (not very often), I would simply ask her why she feels that was appropriate because again, our daughter is breastfed. Or I would ask her why she is bothering to get clothing on our daughter before bed, knowing she sweats so terribly when shes sleeping that I would just end up taking them off again. A simply onsie would be suffient but she would always put her in 2 piexe pajamas. Seemed like a waste of time, energy and frankly, water/electricity because we then had more clothing to wash. So these things, to me, were reasonable questions. 

She has made comments over the past 2 years about me ""fathering her"" so I drastically cut back the questions. Even if I had a problem with something, I would just keep my mouth shut and let her do whatever she wanted and honestly, our home life became peaceful again from the outside looking in but honestly, some stuff just drives me up the wall. 

Like we just got back home from bringing our daughter out for Halloween. Our daughter is tired, I am tired. I have to work in the morning and need to go to bed now. Yet my wife goes to the fridge and starts making herself an ice coffee. So I asked her ""why are you drinking an ice coffee at 10pm?"" She snaps at me and said ""last I fucking checked, I married you for you to be my partner, not my father. Get the fuck off my back."" I put my hands up and said I was just asking a question because now she is going to stay up late and then complain tomorrow when shes tired and she goes ""no you fucking werent. You're being an asshole and questioning my every move again. I dont need your permission to drink a god damn coffee."" 

She is currently locked in our bedroom with our daughter, getting her to sleep, but has seemingly locked me out. So I guess I am on the couch tonight, which is fine.

1olcp5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/1olcp5x/are_obes_really_tied_to_physical_sleep_or_is/,Are OBEs really tied to physical sleep? Or is ‚Äúfalling asleep‚Äù just one doorway among many?,"I‚Äôve been wrestling with this for a while. People often claim we *physically* fall asleep before an OBE‚Äîeither through the middle-of-the-night route or by staying still until the body slips into paralysis while the mind stays lucid. Fair enough. That model makes sense‚Ä¶ until you look closer.

**Example 1 ‚Äì The ‚ÄúIllusion of Method‚Äù approach**  
Mark Gurriaran, author of *The Illusion of Method*, says most of his OBEs happen **after** a full night‚Äôs rest‚Äîsometimes even after coffee. He lies down calmly, trusts the process, and just *waits.* His body shouldn‚Äôt be anywhere near sleep, yet separation still occurs.

**Example 2 ‚Äì NDEs and trauma-based OBEs**  
People in mid-crash or surgery have reported seeing themselves from outside the body‚Äîsometimes while their body is *awake and moving.* I had a childhood event like this: about four years old, terrified of a vaccination, pinned down on the gurney. The instant before the needle went in, I ‚Äúpopped out.‚Äù I was awareness a meter above, no fear, no pain, watching my body flinch. The physical form was active and responsive to pain; I wasn‚Äôt inside it.

**Example 3 ‚Äì OBEs from full sleep**  
My adult OBE came the opposite way. I fell asleep normally, then *instantly* woke floating above my body‚Äîno paralysis, no buildup, no separation stage. It felt like teleportation of consciousness.

So we have:

1. OBEs where the body falls asleep and mind stays awake.
2. OBEs while fully rested and alert.
3. OBEs under trauma, with the body awake.
4. OBEs that happen *through* sleep itself.

1olcijf,https://i.redd.it/t076lx17zjyf1.png,Post-Apocalyptic Campfire: What's Left After the Great AI Explosion?,"*A Science Fiction Exercise in Hard Economics*

**By Ariel, from Argentina**

*(Quick cultural note: Throughout this post, I'll reference ""mate"" - it's a traditional South American tea we drink during informal gatherings and deep conversations. Think of it as our version of sitting around a campfire with coffee, but more communal and ritualistic.)*



# TL;DR:

A ""what if"" science fiction exercise exploring an AI bubble burst in 2026-2027. Unlike the Dot-com bubble (which was sectoral), this time Big Tech represents 35% of the S&P 500. If they fall, everything goes down - but not how you think. Moral: the fuel is there, I don't know if it'll explode, but the risks are real.

*Pour yourself a drink, because we're traveling through time. We're heading into a ""what if"" of hard science fiction.*



# Before We Start: The Mandatory Disclaimer

Nobody can predict the future. And anyone who tells you they can is probably selling you a trading course or crypto scheme.

**So since this is a ""thought exercise,"" everyone can participate with their opinions, because everyone could be right - nobody knows what will actually happen.**

Making it clear this is science fiction... But not science fiction with dragons or superpowers. This is **hard science fiction**: we're taking real data from today (October 31st, 2025), current economic trends, what happened in previous bubbles, and playing ""what if..."".

That said... Buckle up, we're heading to the future... Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads...



# The Future Campfire: 2029

Imagine we're in 2029. The AI bubble exploded in 2026-2027. We're sitting by a campfire, drinking mate, watching the embers. The world didn't end, but it definitely changed. And not for the better.



# The Anatomy of the Rally: Autopsy of a Bubble

We've been talking for a while about how inflated the market was. Even Sam Altman accidentally-on-purpose confessed we were in a bubble. Well, it wasn't just an opinion. It was pure mathematics. When everything exploded and analysts did the autopsy, they discovered something obvious that nobody wanted to see.

**The S&P 500 rally was a masterpiece not of magic, but of financial sleight of hand.**

People believed companies were making money hand over fist, but reality was completely different.

In plain English: Of every $100 the market went up, only about $35 came from companies actually doing better. About $50 was pure hype (investors paying insane prices for every dollar of earnings, P/E ratios at Dot-com 2000 levels). And about $15 was financial engineering: companies burning a trillion a year buying back their own shares to inflate the numbers.

It's like selling a beat-up old car on Facebook Marketplace and posting ""a classic, only for connoisseurs.""

And here's the most cynical part: that real 35% growth was totally concentrated. In 2023, the ""Magnificent 7"" (Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Google, Amazon, Meta, Tesla) grew 29%, while the other 493 companies in the S&P 500... **contracted 4.8%**.

You read that right: 99% of the index was in technical recession while 7 companies held up the entire circus.

It's like a mega-Jenga that's supported by 7 companies the Fed is pumping with steroids, painkillers, and amphetamines, holding up an inverted human pyramid of 493 companies that are doing okay-ish. Eventually, when the Fed stops supplying the drugs, one might break a leg.

When the bubble burst in 2026-2027, that house of cards came down in months.



# The Difference from Dot-com (That Nobody Wanted to See)

And here's the key difference that made this time much worse.

**Year 2000 - Dot-com Bubble:**

Bubble bursts, Cisco loses 90%, Nortel goes bankrupt, Sun agonizes.

BUT: Ford keeps selling cars, McDonald's keeps selling burgers, construction continues, tourism continues. It was a **sectoral bubble**. Like only the video rental bubble bursting in the 90s. Blockbuster dies, but the rest of the world keeps turning.

**Year 2026-2027 - AI Bubble** (in my hypothetical exercise):

Bubble bursts, Microsoft loses 50%, Google/Meta 50%, Nvidia does a ""Cisco 2.0"" (-55%), OpenAI and 200 startups evaporate.

BUT NOW: These companies aren't ""a sector"". They're **30-35% of the S&P 500**. They're the ones that bankrolled the last market rally. They're the ones employing millions. They're the ones buying, investing, innovating.

It's like instead of just video stores bursting, imagine Amazon, ExxonMobil, and the 5 biggest supermarket chains... all at once.

And since they were already holding up the rest of the index (remember: the other 493 companies were already struggling), when they fall, they take everything down.

It's the Jenga effect: you pull out the bottom pieces and the whole tower comes crashing down.



# The Domino Effect (Or Why Nobody Was Saved)

Get comfortable because this gets ugly.

**First Domino: Big Tech Falls**

Microsoft, Google, Meta, Amazon. All poured billions into AI. Bought startups, built data centers, hired engineers, bought GPUs like candy at a kid's birthday party.

When it explodes, they don't just lose that investment. They lose credibility, market confidence, valuation.

Microsoft put $13 billion into OpenAI? Takes a loss that makes the Nokia case look trivial. Satya Nadella's going to need therapy. Lots of therapy. And probably a stiff drink.

Google spent fortunes on Gemini? That money came from Ads profits that were already declining. Turns out, burning cash doesn't generate revenue. Who would've imagined?

Meta spent a small country's budget on GPUs? Zuckerberg will have to explain why he burned money on the metaverse AND AI. The man who collected bubbles. Just needs to invest in NFTs for the hat trick.

**Second Domino: Nvidia (The Black Knight That Keeps Fighting)**

And here I need to be more precise because Nvidia is a special case.

Nvidia does NOT disappear. That would be stupid to think. Its fate is more tragic: it becomes a ""mortal"" company.

It's like the Black Knight from Monty Python. Cut off his arms? ""It's just a scratch."" Cut off his legs? ""Come here, I'll bite you."" Still alive, still fighting, but not what it was.

Cisco sold routers for an internet with a clear business model. Nvidia sold GPUs for an AI revolution (LLMs) that was a bubble without clear ROI.

When it explodes in 2026:

* Demand for H100s and Blackwell collapses
* Startups go bankrupt and cancel orders
* Big Tech cancels their ""AGI in 5 years"" projects (spoiler: it wasn't coming in 5 years)

But AI isn't just LLMs. GPU demand for real applications continues: image recognition in factories, medical analysis, gaming, working autonomous cars, specific practical AI.

The collapse of massive demand gives oxygen to competition (AMD, Intel, Chinese startups). Nvidia's monopoly erodes. CUDA remains dominant, but it's no longer the only game in town.

**The Verdict:** Nvidia in 2029 isn't a corpse. It's a wounded giant. Still a leader with solid products. But it went from ""AI god that will define humanity's future"" to ""a very important hardware provider.""

Its fate is Cisco's: real and profitable company, but will never touch the delirious peaks of 2025. It became a mortal company. And for investors who bought at the peak, that IS death.

""It's just a flesh wound!"" screamed the Nvidia holders while watching their portfolio bleed. But the arm's already gone.

**Third Domino: Investment Funds (Your Retirement)**

This is where it gets really ugly.

US pension funds (and maybe half the world's) hold these companies. The ""safe portfolio"": Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon, Nvidia.

When all that drops 50-70%, these aren't ""numbers on a screen."" They're real retirements of real people evaporating. Because these companies drag down the rest...

And those funds, to cover losses and margin calls, have to sell... everything else. Normal company stocks, bonds, real estate.

It's the contagion effect. Like 2008 when Lehman Brothers fell. But this time with more PowerPoints about AI and less banking regulation.

**Fourth Domino: The Real Economy (That Was Already a Zombie)**

And here's the big issue: the ""real"" economy was already struggling.

Big Tech was holding up the index. Without them, the rest of the S&P 500 was flat or falling for months. In plain terms, they were in recession.

When Big Tech falls, the lid comes off: there was a recession, but it was hidden by the tech rally.

It's like having pain and taking ibuprofen. You feel better, but the problem's still there. And eventually the ibuprofen stops working. And you realize you had something worse all along.



# The Employment Problem

**The Normal Cycle (Pre-AI):** Company hires junior ‚Üí Junior learns ‚Üí In 5-10 years becomes senior ‚Üí Cycle repeats

**The Broken Cycle (2024-2025):** Company uses LLM for repetitive tasks ‚Üí Doesn't hire juniors ‚Üí Juniors don't develop ‚Üí In 5-10 years there are no seniors ‚Üí Economy loses technical capacity

It's like an entire generation of kids who studied and were starting in admin, accounting, legal work, etc., suddenly having no first rung on the ladder.

And when the bubble bursts in 2026-2027, those kids still have no jobs because:

* Simple tasks are done by LLMs (if they're simple and repetitive, they work fine)
* Complex tasks require experience they never could acquire
* Companies are in survival mode, not ""hire and train"" mode, because remember: recession

**Result:** High structural unemployment, especially under 30s. The perfect recipe for medium-term social unrest.

But CEOs happy as clams because every time there were layoffs, their stock went up.



# China: The Wounded Dragon

And here's something we can't ignore: What the hell happened to China?

They also had a rough time. But not as rough as the West expected.

Plot twist nobody saw coming. Well, some saw it coming, but nobody listened because they were busy buying more Nvidia.

**The Initial Hit (2026-2027):**

China caught the global recession contagion:

* Export demand fell
* Foreign investment contracted
* Domestic market worsened
* Growth dropped from 5% to 1-2% (for China, that's almost a recession)

**BUT** (and here's the plot twist):

China had almost nothing bet on the Western AI bubble.

Why? US chip sanctions kept them out of the party. They couldn't buy H100s, couldn't access CUDA the same way, were developing their own stack out of necessity.

Got kicked out of the casino before the poker table exploded. They were building their own casino with blackjack and... well, you know.

When the bubble burst, China didn't have AI startups valued in trillions evaporating. Didn't have pension funds invested in OpenAI. Didn't have the same level of speculative euphoria.

**The Relative Advance**

**During the boom (2023-2025):** Nvidia with CUDA dominated absolutely. China was way behind. The advantage seemed insurmountable.

**After the crash (2027-2029):** Nvidia loses momentum, Western R&D investment contracts (recession), but China keeps advancing (the State can bank losses the private market can't). The gap closes faster.

It's not that China ""won"". It's that when Nvidia slammed on the brakes from the crash, China kept advancing (slower, but advancing).

It's like a race where the leader breaks a leg. Second place doesn't catch up yet, but suddenly they're much closer. And first place is limping but far ahead.

**The Chinese Ecosystem in 2029:**

* Still behind in pure hardware (CUDA is hard to replicate)
* But the difference isn't ""10 years"" anymore, it's ""2-3 years""
* Have their own functional AI stack (not optimal, but functional)
* Dominate certain niches (facial recognition, surveillance, industrial AI)
* Have an industrial base that never stopped investing

**The Final Irony:** The sanctions the US imposed to ""contain"" China ended up being, partially, a blessing in disguise. China couldn't get on the delirious hype train. So they didn't take the crash as hard.

It's like not being able to enter the casino when everyone was winning... but also not being there when it all exploded.



# So What Survives in This Scenario?

Well, here comes the ""positive"" part (in quotes the size of an abandoned data center).

# Companies That MIGHT Survive (Bruised but Alive):

**Microsoft (-50%):** Office/365 and Azure (without AI) have real clients. Xbox, LinkedIn, GitHub work beyond the hype. Has cash to survive. But that OpenAI investment was a black hole of money. They'll have to explain how they justified $13 billion in a startup that was never profitable. Good luck with that quarterly presentation. ""It's not dead, it's just resting. Lovely plumage, the Norwegian Blue... err, OpenAI.""

**Amazon (-40%):** E-commerce continues, traditional AWS has real demand, physical logistics holds. They'll have to write off Anthropic, but core business survives. Turns out, selling things people need is still a valid business model. Revolutionary, I know. Almost as if delivering packages was more profitable than promising AGI.

**Apple (-30%):** The one that put least into the hype, does best. Sells physical hardware people want, closed ecosystem with captive users, Apple Intelligence was more marketing than real investment, has $150 billion in cash. Ironically, being conservative was the right play. Who would've thought? Tim Cook looking at everyone from his tower of cash like ""I told you so"" but saying nothing because he's too professional.

**Nvidia (-50%):** Doesn't die, but becomes a ""mortal"" company. Still sells chips for real AI (not delirious LLMs), gaming, cars. But those who bought at $1000 never recover their investment. From god to mortal. Capitalism's saddest narrative arc. ""I'm not dead yet!"" ""You will be soon, you're very ill."" ""I'm getting better!"" ""No you're not, you'll be stone dead in a moment.""

**""Boring"" Infrastructure:** Utilities (power, water, gas), traditional telecommunications, physical logistics (trucks, trains, ships), traditional data centers. They're there, boring, less valued, but functioning. Like neighborhood stores when all the fancy supermarkets closed. Not sexy, but there when you need them. And they don't promise AGI, just electricity, water, and internet that works.

# What Gets Massively Impacted:

**OpenAI, Anthropic, and 200 AI startups:** ""This is an ex-startup. It has ceased to be. It's expired and gone to meet its maker. This is a late startup. It's a stiff. Bereft of life, it rests in peace. If you hadn't nailed it to the VC portfolio it would be pushing up the daisies. It's rung down the curtain and joined the choir invisible. THIS IS AN EX-STARTUP.""

**Meta/Google (-40-50%):** Spent fortunes on AI, their core business (advertising) was already struggling. Double whammy of bad luck. Like being in a bar fight and getting a bottle smashed on your head WHILE being robbed.

**AI VC Funds:** Entire portfolio evaporated. Those emails to LPs are going to be... awkward. ""Dear Limited Partners, regarding your investment...""

**Entire ""Applied AI"" Ecosystem:** GPT-4 wrappers with fancy dashboards. Turns out ""slap AI on everything"" wasn't a sustainable strategy. Surprise. Shock. Nobody saw it coming. Except everyone.



# The Useless Infrastructure

Here's the key difference from Dot-com, and why this disaster was worse.

**Year 2000:** Fiber optic stayed installed and the world used it. Data centers recycled for hosting and cloud. Routers sold cheap and repurposed. Useful infrastructure that survived the bubble.

**Year 2027:** AI data centers have a problem:

* Consume BRUTAL energy (an entire nuclear plant)
* Depreciate fast (GPUs obsolete in 2-3 years)
* No profitable alternative use (can't use an H100 cluster to host WordPress)

What happens to those data centers? They shut them down (costs less), try to sell GPUs (saturated market), some convert to crypto mining (if Bitcoin survives), most remain as monuments to 2024-2026 greed.

**It's the definition of ""white elephant"".** You'll be able to take tourist tours: ""This is where they burned a billion dollars in the great AI bubble of '25. And if you look left, you'll see the rack where Sam Altman promised AGI for 2026. Note the architectural irony.""



# The World in 2029 (Our Post-Apocalyptic Campfire)

So here we are. Campfire, mate, 2029.

**Economy:** Deep recession 2027-2028, slow recovery from late 2028. Big Tech exists but smaller. S&P 500 is 40% below 2025 peak. Many pension funds cut benefits. Your retirement now buys one pound of barbecue per month instead of a whole one. And it's chicken barbecue, not beef.

**Employment:** High youth unemployment (the generation that couldn't train). Companies returned to hiring humans for basic tasks (turns out LLMs had limits, who would've imagined?), but fewer positions. Wages stagnant or falling.

**Technology:** LLMs still exist, but seen as ""limited tools."" Narrative changed from ""will replace everything"" to ""useful for some specific things."" From ""AGI in 2 years"" to ""it's autocorrect on steroids."" The pendulum always returns. And when it does, it hits hard. Startups that survived had real products, not just ""AI wrapper.""

**Geopolitics:** China still behind in chips, but gap narrowed. Recession hit them, but not as hard as the West. Their AI ecosystem is functional. Irony of sanctions: partially protected them from the crash. Unintended consequences strike again. Mission failed successfully.

**Social:** Massive distrust toward ""the next big tech thing."" Tougher regulation (after disaster, regulations always come. Like regret after a bender.). Generation of young people with fewer opportunities than their parents. Social tension from wealth concentration (AI insiders left with the money before the crash. As always. The timing is suspiciously perfect.)



# The Unexpected Winners

Because there are always winners in a disaster, however cynical that sounds.

**Those who sold at the peak (2025-2026):** Sam Altman, early-stage VCs, OpenAI employees who sold before IPO. Left with REAL money before the collapse. They're on a beach, no regrets. It's Lyle Lanley from The Simpsons' monorail. ""Remember: you elected me."" Left with the cash while everyone applauded. The train had already left the station when people realized it had no brakes.

**""Value investors"" who bought at the bottom (2027-2028):** Buffett bought Microsoft at $180 (they'd been at $450). Those who had patience and cash to buy when everything bled made fortunes in recovery. ""Be greedy when others are fearful."" The old man was right, as always. Must be annoying to be right all the time.

**China (relative winner, not absolute):** Didn't ""win"" in absolute terms. But their relative position improved. Like a race where everyone falls, but you fall less hard. Technically lost, but look at the other guys. They're worse. It's a Pyrrhic victory, but a victory nonetheless.



# Lessons from the Campfire

So, what did we learn from this exercise?

**Bubbles always burst. Always.** No matter how convincing the narrative. If valuation doesn't match reality, it eventually corrects. Financial gravity is relentless. Newton was right, and not just about apples.

**""This time is different"" are the 4 most expensive words in finance.** Buffett said it. History repeated it 50 times. And still, every generation learns it the hard way. We're a species with goldfish memory when it comes to bubbles. But with access to margin trading, which is worse.

**Concentration is dangerous.** When 7 companies are 35% of the index, all betting on the same narrative... if it fails, everyone bleeds. Diversification isn't just a fancy word, turns out it works. Like seatbelts or not sticking fingers in outlets.

**Infrastructure matters, but the TYPE of infrastructure too.** Fiber optic remained and served. AI data centers? Not all infrastructure ages equally.

**Insider timing is suspiciously perfect.** When those who ""know"" start selling, they generally know something you don't. If you see rats leaving the ship, maybe it's time to ask yourself why. And then run. Very fast.

**The public always pays the bill.** In Dot-com, in 2008, in crypto, in AI. The pattern repeats: insiders leave with the money, the public holds the bag. It's a tradition as old as capitalism itself. Like Sunday barbecue, but less pleasant and more expensive.

**Systemic bubbles are MUCH worse than sectoral ones.** When it's ""just"" a sector, the economy absorbs the hit. When it's the world's biggest companies, everyone bleeds. The difference between cutting a finger and cutting an arm. Technically both bleed, but it's not the same.

**Structural unemployment is a social time bomb.** A generation without training is a generation without a future. And that creates trouble. Eventually, people without opportunities tire of waiting patiently. And things get... interesting. In the bad sense.

**Sanctions can have counterintuitive effects.** China was left out of the boom. But also more protected from the bust. The law of unintended consequences never fails. It's the only law that can't be repealed.



# Closing the Campfire

Well, the fire's dying down, the mate's washed out, and it's time to return to 2025.

Remember: **this was a science fiction exercise**. It might happen, might not, or something completely different might happen.

Maybe AGI appears in 2026 and OpenAI's worth $5 trillion and I'm the biggest fool in history (but a happy fool because I'd genuinely love to see AGI. It'd be great to be wrong in this particular case.). Or maybe everything continues on this tech plateau for 10 more years and the bubble never bursts, just slowly deflates like a balloon with a tiny hole.

**The point isn't to predict the future. The point is to understand the risks.**

And today's risk is that we have:

* Sky-high valuations based on impossible expectations
* Massive losses justified as ""investment""
* Enormous market concentration in few companies
* A real economy that was already struggling
* A structurally damaged labor market

These are the ingredients. I don't know if it'll explode. But I know the fuel is there. And there are several people with matches nearby.

So, what to do?

I'm not a financial advisor (mandatory legal disclaimer), but if you ask me as a friend by the campfire:

* Don't jump on the hype train just because ""everyone's making money""
* Diversify (don't put everything in tech)
* Keep some cash for opportunities if there's a crash
* If you're going to invest in OpenAI's IPO... better give me that money and I'll make you a barbecue (at least you'll eat something delicious and tangible. And barbecue can't lose 90% of its value in 6 months. Well, technically yes if you leave it too long in the fridge, but you get the point.)

And above all: **stay informed, question narratives, and don't buy the hype.**

Because whether in 2026, 2027, or 2030, someday we'll be at this campfire, drinking mate for real, saying ""remember when..."". Mind you, if the market understands the risks, there might be corrections and that would be very good because the damage would be less. More corrections = less damage. Better to bleed slowly than hemorrhage all at once. Like removing a band-aid: better slow than one yank. Well, bad analogy, but you get it.

And that day I want you to tell me: ""Hey, I read your post. Didn't buy into it all. I saved myself.""

That'll be the best reward.

üßâ *Come back when it explodes. I'll be here, by the campfire, saying ""I told you so,"" laughing but sad.*

(Or humbly eating my words if AGI arrives. In which case, I'll also invite you to a barbecue. And it'll be a GOOD barbecue, with chorizo and blood sausage, because if AGI arrives we'll all have money to buy meat. Or AGI will solve world hunger. Or we're chicken. The point is if I'm wrong, we celebrate anyway.)



# The Final Punchline

And as I write this in 2025, I imagine the scene:

It's 2029. We're at the campfire. Mate's circulating. Embers crackle.

You: ""Hey, remember that post you made in 2025?""

Me: ""Yeah, the time travel one...""

You: ""You were right. Everything exploded. Nvidia fell 50%. OpenAI closed. My retirement's worth half.""

Me: ""...""

You: ""But there's something I don't understand.""

Me: ""What?""

You: ""How is it that you also lost money if you knew this would happen?""

Me: ""Ah, well... you see... timing is difficult... and there was a sale on Nvidia stock and...""

You: ""You jumped on the hype train?""

Me: ""... maybe.""

You: ""After writing 10,000 words about why NOT to jump on the hype train?""

Me: ""In my defense, the charts looked VERY pretty.""

You: ""...""

Me: ""And there was a guy on YouTube who said‚Äî""

You: ""Pour me another mate and let's not talk about it anymore.""

Because at the end of the day, we're all human. And humans are pretty stupid at predicting bubbles... but even worse at resisting them when we see them inflating.

It's like watching an accident in slow motion. You know it's going to happen. You can see it coming. But you keep watching anyway.

**End of science fiction exercise.**



# Final Disclaimer

This is a speculative economic science fiction exercise based on current data and historical precedents. It's not financial advice. It's not a prediction. It's a campfire chat among friends who like to think ""what if."" Invest at your own risk and responsibility. And if you lose money, don't blame me, blame those who sold you the hype.

But I'm not there. I'm here. At the campfire. With washed-out mate. As it should be.

1olc93u,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1olc93u/beast_in_the_pines_part_2/,"Beast In The Pines, Part 2","That Friday we headed to Clarence once again. Outside of the music on the radio the car ride was pointedly quieter than usual, less chatty. Nobody said what everyone was thinking, but perhaps it was for the best. A deluge of comments and concerns wouldn‚Äôt prevent Dad from finding more dead animals. So we all acted like everything was business as usual. As we passed the¬† ‚ÄúWelcome to Clarence! Population: 804,‚Äù sign, thoughts of the monster that had been congregating in my mind all week began to swarm.

We turned from the old sun baked road and onto the dirt drive way. Whatever cheery ambient banjo music my brain normally played when we arrived at farm was silent. I only heard the tires as they crunched over rocks.

Once we got settled in, Dad told Mom and I to go do our usual grocery shopping. While we were gone he planned to go around the pine rows in Bear and ‚Äútake a look around‚Äù which we all knew meant ‚Äúsearch for carcasses.‚Äù He assured us he would be fine, putting our minds at ease with a dad joke about his shotgun riding shotgun.¬†

So Mom and I went by the Piggly Wiggly in Clarence. The same old lady from last time was at the front, greeting us when we walked in. Mom gave me half the grocery list so we could divide and conquer. She wanted to get back to the farmhouse, she didn‚Äôt like the idea of Dad out there by himself.

Rounding the corner I went to dodge the bread display but it wasn‚Äôt there. I proceeded down the list until I had completed my scavenger hunt, meeting back up with Mom. We checked out, the nice older lady remembering us from last time, and striking up conversation with Mom. I zoned out.

Maybe the movie tropes were true and it only transformed under a full moon. It wasn‚Äôt a full moon this weekend, but¬†it wasn‚Äôt a full moon last weekend either, and Dad said the Bobcat was fresh. So what if it was there? Would Dad find more dead animals? Were we really safe like Dad said? What if now it knew we were coming out there and tried to eat us?

My thoughts were fitful and aimless. The swarm constructing a hive.¬†

Before I knew it we were back at the farmhouse. From the look on Mom‚Äôs face I could see that the same swarm had built a hive in her brain as well. We watched Dad emerge from the front porch as we pulled up. He gave us a wave, his smile seemed hopeful as he approached.

‚ÄúGood news. I went around the pines and didn‚Äôt see any signs of the big nasty varmint.‚Äù Dad said ruffling my hair.¬†

‚ÄúReally? Peter, do you think maybe it‚Äôs wandered off somewhere else?‚Äù¬†

He clicked his tongue, ‚ÄúEh, I don‚Äôt think so, but who knows. I mean I hope so, that would be great.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, let some other bum bury dead animals.‚Äù I jeered.

‚ÄúYeah!‚Äù Dad jeered with me.¬†

‚ÄúMaybe that big ugly thing went off and died somewhere!‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah!‚Äù

Mom chuckled, ‚ÄúYou two are a couple of clowns. Now can I get some help with the rest of these groceries please?‚Äù Dad walked past me to grab an armful of groceries, bumping me over playfully. I laughed, trying and failing to push him over in return.¬†

Despite the swarm, and all the apprehension built up in my gut, I couldn‚Äôt help but want to try and carry on as usual, to treat this weekend like a normal weekend. At least until I was given a reason not to.

The rest of that weekend was like a dream. Friday afternoon I helped Mom with some chores, and then I played outside, finishing the carving in my oak tree, building little houses for fairies with sticks. I saw the cats running around the farm like they normally do. No longer lingering near the Kitty Cat Barn like they were last week. They frolicked in the clovers, basked in the warm rays of sunlight. I enjoyed watching them. That night there was a glorious heavy rain. Mom made a hot beef stew, hearty and savory.¬†

Tucked in that night I was tired and my belly was full. I wouldn‚Äôt have seen anything out the window anyway, so I didn‚Äôt look. The tin roof sang me to sleep.¬†

Saturday was more of the same Arcadian bliss. Aunt Cheryl came to visit on Saturday. She was Mom‚Äôs older sister, and while we loved Aunt Cheryl, Dad had taught me to make myself busy when she came around. Poor Mom was left to pull up a chair and listen. She was twice divorced, and at the time she was dating Mr. Neal. She had leathery bronze skin and bleach blonde hair, and smelled like shea butter hand lotion.¬†

Mom and Aunt Cheryl sat on the porch, and I played in the yard with some Barbie dolls pretending I was extremely busy. They talked about the cold front coming in next week, Aunt Cheryl‚Äôs work at the dentist‚Äôs office, Aunt Cheryl‚Äôs most recent ex-husband‚Äôs new girlfriend, Aunt Cheryl‚Äôs problems with her heart burn, and Aunt Cheryl‚Äôs plans for dinner that night. When Aunt Cheryl went to take a sip of her drink to oil the wheels on her trap, Mom finally got a word in. She said it in a hush, in case I was listening. Which I was.

‚ÄúCheryl you haven‚Äôt heard anything new recently, you know about the animal attacks?‚Äù

Aunt Cheryl responded at full volume.

‚ÄúShit, not since you told me about the dead animals y'all found, honey. And Neal hadn‚Äôt said nothing about it, but you know Neal. He‚Äôs the tall dark and mysterious type. Ya know I told him he needs to quit slouchin‚Äô but he don‚Äôt listen to me-‚Äú

The conversation trailed off, and a small budding sense of hope began to take root within me. No news was good news, right?

That night, against my better judgement, I slowly eased myself out of bed to peer out the window. I couldn‚Äôt help but to shiver when I imagined what I might see. Despite my unease, I was only greeted with the cats, loitering around the small gardening barn, stalking mice among flower bushes. A barn owl called from one of the pecan trees.

I felt that bud of hopefulness start to blossom.¬†

We drove home on Sunday, and I couldn‚Äôt help but to feel disarmed as I peered out the window, admiring the scenery like I used to.

If only I knew how much danger I would soon be in.

The week was filled with delightful tedium. School, homework, a couple afternoons at friends‚Äô houses. I hadn‚Äôt told any of my them about the slew of dead animals we had found in Clarence, what I had seen in the pine rows, or much less my werewolf theory.¬†

Before all of this started I¬† had asked Mom and Dad if we could to take a friend with us one weekend. They responded positively to that, but I was sure that wasn‚Äôt the case now. I had a feeling it would be a while before either of them felt comfortable with that, but if the beast stayed away, then maybe they would become open to the idea again.

I pondered these thoughts as we pulled up to Piggly Wiggly that Friday. We decided to stop by on the way in to town. Dad was running by the hardware store, something about brackets for some roof mounted lights for Bear.

Mom gave me half of the grocery list. As I looked it over, I turned the corner to go down the next aisle and almost bumped into it. The bread display. Once we finished our shopping, we checked out and met Dad by the car. When we asked him if he found the part he was looking for, he began to rant about the hardware store never having what he needed. From there we headed to the farm.¬†

We pulled up to farmhouse, in good spirits as we unloaded groceries. Once we finished l Mom said I could go play until dinner time, so long as she could see me from the house; but before I could shoot out into the yard, Dad whistled for my attention.¬†

‚ÄúEy! Before you go play, I need you to go feed those cats. They probably need a refill. Make sure they got clean water too.‚Äù

Mom and Dad exchanged looks. The Kitty Cat Barn wasn‚Äôt in view of the windows.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry Lori, I‚Äôm headed over to the shop barn, I‚Äôll be able to keep an eye on her until she can get back into your line of sight.‚Äù

I heard Dad whisper something to her under his breath about responsibility, before he came over affectionately grabbing my shoulders as he walked with me to the shop barn. I waited by the door while he fetched me a little bag of cat food and then sent me on my way. I could feel his gaze on me until I was out of sight.¬†

There were about 10 cats living in the Kitty Cat Barn at a time, not including their kittens. All of them were Nanny‚Äôs strays.

Despite knowing they were regularly checked on by Mrs Kerry, I still worried about them, especially out in the wild with some beast on the loose. Though, I felt like a werewolf eating a cat was equivalent to me eating a singular popcorn shrimp. I wasn‚Äôt sure if the cats knew that, but perhaps they felt better in the Kitty Cat Barn, being popcorn shrimp in a hard to reach place.

I wrapped my fingers around the lopsided wire-paneled door that bowed on its hinges, allowing the cats easy entry. I stepped through the threshold an initial response of relief to see glimmering eyes shining at me through the musty darkness. However, I was then horrified by the fact that they were¬†all¬†there. More than 10, probably 20, all tucked into the shelves, hiding. I stopped dead in my tracks, and stayed dead there for a minute, trying to process what this may have meant, why they were there. Unfortunately, I had an idea. I tried to push through the motions, moving on to the task at hand. I fed them, and they graciously came down to eat. I used the hose to clean their bowl and they gladly drank. I was hopeful that maybe they were just still spooked by ‚Äúsomething,‚Äù and that perhaps some food and drink would help them perk up. But once they had eaten and drank their fill, they just jumped right back onto their shelves, tucking themselves in like books. Dozens of eyes, pairs of wide luminous globes staring at me with feral transparency.¬†

You need to run. You need to hide.¬†

I would have gone straight to Dad to report this, but I heard the air compressor running, and I knew that meant ‚Äúbusy,‚Äù so I came running back into the house.

‚ÄúMom! Mom! The cats are all hiding in the Kitty Cat Barn!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù She said peaking her head out from doorway to the kitchen.

‚ÄúThere are like 20 cats hiding in the barn, Mom! I-‚Äú¬†

I paused for a moment, staring out the window.

‚ÄúI think they might be hiding from the werewolf!‚Äù

There was a beat of silence.

‚ÄúAmy-‚Äú Mom huffed, ‚Äúcome here.‚Äù

I did as she said, any fearful wind in my sails shadowed by the threat of a scolding from my mother. I walked timidly into the kitchen as she finished washing her hands, wiping them on her apron before placing them on my shoulders.

‚ÄúAmy, sweetheart. There was, or is, an animal out there. Absolutely. We don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a wolf or a bear, but we know that it‚Äôs one of the two.‚Äù

She knew I disagreed, but my better judgement had me keep my mouth shut.

‚ÄúYou are a good girl Amy, and I know you‚Äôre not lying to me. Now whether you did see something out there or maybe dreamed it, it doesn‚Äôt matter. It scared you, and it would‚Äôve scared me too! I don‚Äôt want you to think I don‚Äôt believe that you saw what you think you saw, okay? I do. But it‚Äôs just not a werewolf, honey, okay? Werewolves are not real.‚Äù

She said all of this firmly but, kindly, warmly. With a yearning for understanding in her eyes.¬†

I loved my Mom, so much. I gave her a small smile. Nodding.¬†

‚ÄúAre we in agreement then?‚Äù

I nodded.

I wondered if I should start taking into consideration that this wasn‚Äôt a werewolf, and that she was probably right. The very thought caused me to psychologically squirm, but maybe I really did just have a nightmare.

That night I laid in bed, kissed and tucked in under fresh linens. Prayers said. I tossed and turned for half an hour before I knocked on the door to Mom and Dad‚Äôs room. Pitifully declaring,

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt sleep.‚Äù¬†

Mom lovingly embraced me, probably glad I hadn‚Äôt come bursting in about seeing a werewolf. She tucked me back into bed and brought me a glass of warm milk to help me relax. It calmed me enough that when she asked if I was comfortable enough for her to go back to bed, that I said yes. She kissed my forehead, telling me goodnight, and I was suddenly alone again. Warm and snug under the covers, but still awake, staring at the ceiling.¬†

Were the cats still huddled in the barn? How long would they cower in there?¬†

I turned to look over at the window, until slowly I got up.¬†

I peaked out the window. One of the flood lights was on the garden barn. Dad had started leaving it on since burying those animals with Mr Voss. Its light cast shadows on the yard and it‚Äôs various shrubs and garden beds. I didn‚Äôt see any of the cats. None of them played around in the grass or slinked about in the shadows. I sighed, climbing back into bed. I hadn‚Äôt laid back down for more than 15 minutes, sleep‚Äôs spell almost cast on me when I heard it.¬†

I heard it.¬†

The groaning sound of wood in the yard. By the time I‚Äôd flipped the covers over to venture out of bed and investigate I heard another sound, right below my window- the crunching of leaves, followed by a very soft high pitched yap.¬†

I rushed to the window and below it, under the bush, I saw a fox and her kits skulking up against the side of the house. The mother was coming down from a snarl, as though she had just snapped at one of them. I saw the kit in question, coming up to nuzzle the mother with its litter mates.

I didn‚Äôt have time to ask myself what they were hiding from.¬†

A shape loomed in my periphery. From the shadowy outline of the garden shed‚Äôs roof I saw a shape emerge. Somewhat indiscernible, a head and a pair of shoulders- human looking, muscular, but very broad- like they‚Äôd been unnaturally pushed apart to make room for the tall spinous protrusions of its back. It approached the front most part of the roof turning to the side, and in the inky midnight blue sky its black silhouette engrained itself into my mind for eternity. From the massive torso and arched spine came a long thick neck that ran up to a skull, distinctly canine with a muzzle. The ears were pointed and translucent like the wings of a bat. I watched as one of its abnormally long arms moved dexterously to maneuver its body over the roof. Fear hit my blood stream, and I had to work to contain my scream of panic. My raspy whimper cracked out from my throat as I sprinted to my parents room where it turned into a cry.¬†

‚ÄúDaaaaad! Mommmm!‚Äù

It was pure instinct, A child running and whimpering to its parents as the kit had beneath my window.

They groaned as they sat up in bed,

‚ÄúAmy? What is it baby? Are you okay?‚Äù

I approached my mom‚Äôs side, cowering into my her arms. She held me tight by my wrists, trying to make out what I was saying despite being half asleep.¬†

A sudden wall within me fell, and defeat consumed me.¬†

They wouldn‚Äôt believe me, but I know what I saw.¬†

I know what I saw.

‚ÄúIts the werewolf,‚Äù the last word came out in slow shaky whimper.

‚ÄúI swear. I swear Mama.‚Äù I gasped between sobs.¬†

She released a deep breath, holding me close.¬†

‚ÄúAmy,‚Äù I could hear the sorrow in her voice, but what stung was the disappointment.

‚ÄúAmy, you saw it out your window?‚Äù Dad was on his feet, already at the door to their bedroom.

¬†I nodded quickly.

I heard him as he moved swiftly down the hall, presumably to go look out my window. He made footfall to the back door, grabbing a shell from the top of the bookshelf, loading it into his shot gun.

Of course, he came back with nothing to report.¬†

‚ÄúAmy, you must‚Äôve had a nightmare baby.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was a werewolf! Im not making it up! It was on the garden barn, Daddy it was just there!‚Äù

‚ÄúI looked, baby, and I didn‚Äôt see it.‚Äù

‚ÄúHoney we know you‚Äôre not lying, you just had a vivid nightmare is all.‚Äù

I shook my head and I wept. Not sure what was real anymore.

Mom and Dad let me crawl into bed with them. ¬†

The next morning I heard them talking in hushed tones in the living room, over coffee. About me.

‚ÄúI was thinking if she saw something on two legs out there that maybe it was just a big man. I talked to Dan yesterday on the phone, he said some people in the area don't want to wait for the game warden- can‚Äôt say I entirely blame ‚Äòem- but they might be out there trying to hunt the thing. I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought we had a good understanding yesterday. I should have done more to keep her grounded through all of this, paid more attention, I just-‚Äú I heard my mom sigh, burying her face in her hands. My dad patted her back.¬†

‚ÄúI hate that she is going through this. She‚Äôs such a good kid.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo honey, none of this is your fault. I should‚Äôve gotten more involved-‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, no- you‚Äôve been great. Not to mention, you‚Äôre working a 9 to 5 all week and then keeping the grounds up here‚Ä¶ and burying dead animals as of late. Hopefully this is just a phase she‚Äôs going through. I just worry about her you know? The fairy stories, those so called ‚Äúfriends‚Äù of hers at school-‚Äú

I couldn‚Äôt bear to hear any more. Mom and Dad had so much they were trying to juggle, and now I had caused them to worry about me.¬†

I hated myself for that, I hated that I had made them hurt.¬†

I tip toed back to their bedroom, crying under the covers for a little while until I had gotten my emotions under control. I wiped my tears and walked into the living room, making sure they saw me run the sleep from my eyes, an excuse for their redness.¬†

The rest of the day I read mostly. Not wanting to really talk to anyone. I would‚Äôve liked to have played with the cats, but there was no coaxing them from their refuge in the Kitty Cat Barn.

I was mostly quiet at lunch and at dinner, finishing both quickly to ‚Äúget back to the book I was reading.‚Äù Mom and Dad had each made at least one attempt during the day to say something to me about the night before. To make sure I was okay, to ask if I needed or wanted to talk about it. I knew that if we did they would only end up trying to help validate in my mind that it was all a dream. By the end of the day I wished that I was just being an imaginative child, and that I could honestly tell myself that it was just a vivid nightmare.¬†

Mom and Dad offered to let me sleep with them that night. I thanked them, but refused, assuring them that I would be fine. I told myself that so long as I didn‚Äôt look out my window I wouldn‚Äôt risk seeing anything, and that gave me comfort. Enough comfort to sleep alone in a dark room with a werewolf possibly outside, anyway.¬†

To my own surprise I managed to get to sleep well enough, tired from all the emotions I had been untangling for the past 24 hours.

To this day, I cannot say what compelled me to stir from my rest in the middle of the night. I awoke, rubbing my eyes as I got my bearings.¬†

I had told myself.¬†

Don‚Äôt go over to the window. Nothing good ever happens when you go over to the window.

I don‚Äôt know if there was a part of me that wanted to prove myself wrong, so I could say to myself,¬†

‚ÄúSee? There‚Äôs nothing out there. Maybe Mom and Dad are right, and you‚Äôre just a dumb little kid having nightmares.‚Äù

I padded over, hearing the friendly creak of the floorboards. I ducked under the lacey curtain veil that my mother had lovingly sewn together and hung up on my window, in all likelihood hoping it would keep me from doing exactly what I was about to do.¬†

To my everlasting regret, I peered out into the pitch black world beyond the glass.¬†

Through one of the vintage pane‚Äôs I saw something familiar.¬† A pair of chalky white new balance sneakers, something that I thought was unique to only one person.

I felt my heart sink to the floor.¬†

The bright white shoes stood out in the underbrush, and I squinted at the way they almost seemed to hover in the darkness. I managed to make out that the figure they belonged to was staggering into the woods.¬†

What was wrong with Dad? Was he hurt?

I remember my mind beginning to free fall, panic setting in. My thoughts fogged up the window pane on a whisper,¬†

‚ÄúIf I wake Mom, I‚Äôll just make her upset.‚Äù

I should have just gotten Mom. God, I should have just gotten Mom.¬†

But I had cried wolf too many times.

My plan was to go out the back door and call out to him from the stoop. I shuffled out into the night chill, hugging my arms to my chest.¬†

I had opened my mouth to shout his name, but before I could, I heard the agonizing cry from the figure out in the woods. I‚Äôd heard my Dad yelp when he brought a hammer down on his thumb, but I had never heard him cry out like that before.¬†

It sounded excruciating.

Had the monster hurt him? Could he walk? Did he need help?

I watched the figure nearly crumpling over as it staggered into the pine rows.

I- the sweet summer child- thought,

He isn‚Äôt far away.

I could catch up to him quickly.

I run that distance in P.E. all the time.¬†¬†

Before I knew it I was sprinting through the yard with confidence, I knew every rock, ant hill, and arching root. It was all mostly open space until you got to the concrete slab in front of the shop barn where Dad parked the Backhoe and Bear. My eyes slowly began to adjust to the dark. I ran on tiptoe across the icy cold concrete slab. I didn‚Äôt even have any shoes on.¬†

I stopped to take a better look at the barn. The lights weren‚Äôt on. Dad hadn‚Äôt been working on anything. What in the world was he doing out here so late? Did he see something?

I peered into the pine rows. No sight of the figure.¬†

I wanted to call out to him, but hesitated. If that thing was out here I wasn‚Äôt going to draw its attention to us.¬†

He couldn‚Äôt have been more than half a football field away. I could catch him.

I ran through the frigid night air, my heart knocking like a piston within my chest. My gaze swung between the pine trunks as I scanned the rows. Seeing nothing, I continued to run. The monotony of the trunks and the rows and the waves of pine straw putting me into a trance.¬†

How many rows back had I gone? Was this a football field- or half a football field?

Surely I would have seen Dad by now.

By the grace of God I stopped, warm blood pumping through my chest, I tried to catch my breath as quietly as I could. The pines stood in formation around me, a sprawling arboreal army.¬†

It felt like some dense mass had been dropped down my throat until it hit the bottom of my stomach, sinking like a stone. The nausea set in as I became cognizant of my situation, my instincts being translated into a flimsy string of cohesive thought.¬†

Dear God. Dear God. I had ran too far.

You idiot. You stupid dumb little child.

I became very still.¬†

Soft tender moonlight trickled through the pines, pearly beams scattering across the fallen pine needles.

I looked out, down the corridors of trees. Making out a shape a few rows over, I squinted, shifting my head to see through the trunks. When I realized what I was seeing my eyes grew very wide, and my spine grew rigid. Terror hit me like lightning.

It was far enough away that I hadn‚Äôt seen it at first, but not so far that I couldn‚Äôt now see it in painful clarity.¬†

It moved like a wraith in a crypt, a lean, creeping monstrosity. I remember thinking how fast it looked. How little time it would likely take it to get to me.

I took slow silent steps backwards willing to do this all the way home if I had to. Now acutely aware of my surroundings, I stepped and felt a pang of hope. When I stepped there was no crunch in the pine needles.

Thinking this was to my advantage, I made a handful of quick steps until suddenly, to my corporeal horror, it stopped. I watched as its ears fanned upwards, unnaturally long and pointy. Its head turned on its long neck, the top of its muzzle moved up in a familiar motion. A sniff.¬†

It could smell me.

Slow and shaky steps turned quickly into a full sprint in the opposite direction, I nearly held my breath as I ran, trying to keep myself as quiet as possible. I bit my lips to keep from whimpering. I hoped I would be able to hear him if he started to run towards me.

But it dawned on me that what I had moments ago thought to be to my advantage was now to my great detriment-¬†

When I stepped- there was no crunch.

I was suddenly also painfully aware of how bright neon pink my nightgown was in the darkness.

My jaw began to quiver as I pressed forward. I cut diagonally across the rows, moving in the general direction of the farmhouse.¬†

I ran like this, cutting across row after row after row until suddenly I collided with the ground, having tripped on a groove in the earth. In that moment I remember thinking that between keeping my tears at bay and fighting the urge to involuntarily wet myself, I knew something had to give. Urine it would smell, but hopefully not tears. That thought alone, and how hopelessly dead I began to realize I was caused them to fall like a downpour, cascading down my cheeks. Cold rivers on my warm flushed face. I scrambled up, again fighting the urge to whimper, until my blurry eyes caught sight of what I had tripped on.¬†

The groove I had tripped on was one of many, claw marks that had slashed up layers of pine needles and ripped into the earth. Less than half a row away was a pile of clothes, among them were the treasonous pair of white new balance sneakers, cast aside haphazardly.¬†

I wish I could say that I told myself to calm down and think, but I didn‚Äôt. My hippocampus, my amygdala, one of them went AWOL and violently threw open the filing cabinet labeled ‚ÄúWolves.‚Äù

¬†In all my follies that evening I made one decision that might have saved my life.

I stripped off my neon pink nightgown, flinging it to the side.¬†

Down to nothing but my Barbie underwear, I yanked the shirt up from the ground, sliding it over my head.

I grabbed the jacket, hurriedly slipping my arms into the sleeves.

It was huge on me, and smelled like cigarettes, but more importantly it wasn't bright pink and it would mask my smell. The smell of Mr. Bubble bath soap and warm milk.¬†

With less than a couple of seconds to make a decision that I was willing to bet my life on, I frantically assumed that if the beast followed my scent diagonally through the pine rows that I would go diagonally the opposite way, but still in the direction of the house.¬†

Hurtling forward I thought this would be a great plan until it occurred to me that it would see me. It would have one chance of seeing me from down the pine rows, I could only hope that I was far enough away.¬†

Adrenaline eventually took all my thoughts by the collar and kicked them out. Fate had dealt me a handful of seconds for thinking and I had used them up. My only task now was to act on them and pray.

As I ran I mustered up the courage to pivot and look beside me down the pine rows. Painfully aware that I was at the indefensible mercy of what I might see.¬†

After crossing over half a dozen rows I saw a flash. The most terrifying blur I had ever seen. I only vaguely made out its shape. Headed in the direction I had been in less than a minute before. There was no speculating about it.¬†

The monster was after me.¬†

I could see light from the farmhouse, an angel reaching out in the night. Mom and Dad had realized that their baby girl wasn‚Äôt tucked in bed under her daisy quilt. My heart began to ache. I could practically smell the remnants of smoke from my dad‚Äôs pipe, feel the crisp linen sheets mom had just put on the bed. I choked back a sob.¬†

I continued to run until I emerged from the pine rows, right beside the shop barn. For a splintering second I thought of the naive child that¬† had stood there not 15 minutes ago, preparing to run into the devil‚Äôs hunting ground.

¬†I was so close, so close to the house. 100 yards at the most. I was ready to collapse in on myself, fall into hysterics in the safety of my parents arms.¬†

But as I reached the shop barn I stopped. Dead in my tracks. A tug, a pull, a gut feeling. A memory from the night before.¬†

Surely, the shop barn was too tall.

But the oak tree beside it- beside me- wasn‚Äôt.¬†

My head snapped up to my right.¬†

It sat like a looming gargoyle on the burled apex of the oak‚Äôs twisted knotted branches, its enormous torso coiled up in the dark, ready to strike had I taken a few steps further.

The shadow of the barn had concealed me, but not for long. I watched as a cadaverous¬† front limb slid down the trunk from the dark and into the unholy moonlight. Massively elongated human palms and fingers, the bones bowing horrifically outwards like paws, tipped with keratinous claws that bit into the bark. I took a step backward. I watched in terror as the hand revealed an arm, muscled like a human‚Äôs but twice as long and curved at an unnatural angle.¬†

I darted into the barn. I knew I didn‚Äôt have more than a second or two.¬†

I stumbled in through the doorway. I was going to make a break for the upstairs loft, but I opted not to for fear of being cornered.

My eyes only had enough time for one vicious sweep of the room. They landed on a solid wooden workbench up against the wall with a trash can beneath it. I raced over, frantically crawling under it, unbothered by the cobwebs. Beside me was a bucket with various lengths of PVC pipe. With whatever borrowed time I didn‚Äôt have, I reached to move it to my side and block me in under the bench.

I was unaware of the chains wound up in the bottom like snakes.¬†

I heard the grit from the bottom of the bucket scrape against the cement and I wanted to vomit.

I peered out from my hiding spot, a tall ominous shape standing still in the doorway.¬†

For all I knew, the scrape was inconsequential, perhaps it had already seen me and I was as good as dead anyway.

My cheeks were cold, but I felt the warm trails of tears still on my face.

I watched as it entered the barn. It‚Äôs lean disfigured arms came into view first, the muscles slithering beneath the skin as it moved. Its torso was human but wide, stretched outwards unnaturally. The hips were the same way, narrow, but also having been stretched to achieve its new unholy function. It‚Äôs legs were much like the arms, and the feet much like the hands.

It stalked into the barn, sniffing the air. Once beside the bench it slowly began to crouch towards the ground.¬†

I was nearly blind with fear as it lowered itself.

As its head came into my line of sight I caught my breath in my throat. Below the bridge of the nose was oversized abnormal canine, as though its snout had erupted out of a human face. Its jaws and teeth were so large, and the skull had morphed to accommodate it.¬†

I could feel the heat radiate from the creature. Like it was on fire, burning and expending more energy than the vessel was meant to. I felt a wave of warmth wash over my legs but I was too petrified to register it.

However abhorrently vile and evil its entire form was, it eyes were what shattered me.

It‚Äôs eyes are what I see every time I close my own, every night of my life.

They were hauntingly and devastatingly human. A man‚Äôs eyes. Green. Glassed over. The eyes nor the brows moved as it sniffed the air beside my hiding spot. They remained unfazed despite the snarl on its pale lips, or the twitch in its ears as it listened for me and instead heard something else.¬†

The eyes were fixed in place, looking wherever the neck told it to. I watched as it slowly tilted its head at the sound, as if its interest had been gradually piqued.¬†

A few seconds later I heard the quick and heavy footsteps of my Dad approaching from outside the barn, followed by Bear roaring to life. The engine bellowed as he hit the gas.¬†

Like a shot, the beast moved out of the barn, seemingly in one silent spider like motion. Faster than wind. The sudden absence of its immense presence gutted me. ¬†

I don‚Äôt know when, but I realized that at some point my hand had slowly crept over my mouth in horror.

I sat there for what felt like an hour. Sure that it was by the door. Waiting for me to come running out.¬†

I sat, every muscle in my body tensed until I heard a howl in distance.¬†

When you hear a wolf howl in a scary movie, it‚Äôs so weightless. Often times it means nothing, merely an overused sound bite to set the mood.

What I heard caused whatever part of my psyche that was spiritual to tremble.¬†

It was both an animalistic howl and a human scream.¬†

It was anguish and rage and hunger.¬†

Tears fell as I thought of my Dad. I came out here thinking I was helping him and I might‚Äôve just gotten him killed. The dam was ready to burst, but I had to get home first.¬†

I delineated for a few moments. Unabashed horror holding me in a vice. I shook violently as I clumsily came out from under the bench. Feeling something wet I looked down. I had wet myself. I realized that I hadn‚Äôt gotten lucky. I had outsmarted nothing. The beast left because I was popcorn shrimp in a hard to reach place.¬†",1,1761961868.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Throughout our relationship he has not been the best at planning dates or giving gifts, two things that are very important to me.
He is great and amazing in other ways but I am seeing 0 effort put in towards what I‚Äôm asking for. 

We have discussed this multiple times, any of the important anniversaries, holidays etc I‚Äôm always giving more thoughtful gifts and planning dates, I often pay for most of our dates as well. We almost broke up over the summer due to him not planning anything for my birthday

Before I get accused of being materialistic I have verbally affirmed that free or low cost dates / gifts mean just as much if not more to me, it‚Äôs really about the thought and effort.

He recently dropped the ball on him planning dates for us again, big time, he promised he‚Äôd plan a trip for us during days we both requested off, he didn‚Äôt do any planning and now it‚Äôs too late to do anything during those days.  we discussed this, I think that I am considering breaking up, I love him so much but I can‚Äôt keep having the same conversations with no change, i feel very undervalued. He affirms me verbally very very  well but there is no action after that.

His newest point was that he feels as if he cannot plan anything for us because lately I often decline/refuse going out to eat due to my ongoing battle with an eating disorder.

I personally feel like this is incredibly insensitive and purposeful in trying to place blame on me. I have given many detailed examples of dates he could take me on, coffee shops I want to try, record stores, parks, seasonal festivals, eating out is not the only option for taking your girlfriend out on a date in my opinion, and he knows that because I often plan and pay for us to do similar things as I just listed.

I want to revisit this conversation but I‚Äôm considering ending our relationship (which I really do not want to do) I just feel like I‚Äôve tried everything to get a little effort but it doesn‚Äôt seem to work.

Is he valid in this or do I need to do some more soul searching here and get my shit figured out before dating anyone. 

TLDR; my boyfriend refuses to plan any dates ever but when we recently discussed he said he won‚Äôt plan anything because I will decline going on dinner dates due to my eating disorder.",9,1761961752.0,relationship_advice,18,1.0,False

Men approaching women in public places can make them feel uncomfortable and weirded out. It is a much better idea to meet a potential partner on a dating app - as they are literally designed to meet a companion. It isn't awkward or intrusive.

If you aren't having success meeting the women you want on dating apps, take better pictures and dress better, it is that simple. However, this notion that cold approaching was ever a thing needs to go.

I have social anxiety and growing up I never really had friends, so I‚Äôve always been pretty lonely.

Usually when I go to these events, I meet new people or reconnect with people I used to know. We have good conversations, and they often say things like ‚Äúwe should hang out sometime‚Äù.

I‚Äôd love to grab coffee or hang out sometime,‚Äù and almost every single time, they don‚Äôt reply. It happens over and over again. The thing is that I see other people my age making friends and finding people to hang out with extremely fast.

I don‚Äôt understand what I‚Äôm doing wrong they seemed genuinely nice and interested in being friends in person, but once I reach out, it‚Äôs just silence. Is there a chance I‚Äôm doing anything wrong?

1olbvcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CuriousAF/comments/1olbvcl/rebuilding_dopamine_sensitivity_a_stepbystep/,"Rebuilding dopamine sensitivity: a step-by-step guide to craving less, focusing more","Most people I know are tired. Not physically, but mentally ‚Äî stuck in a loop of chasing fast dopamine, quitting hard things, and wondering why nothing feels meaningful anymore. We're scrolling instead of living. Binging instead of building. It‚Äôs not a lack of intelligence or drive. It‚Äôs a neurochemical hijack. And it‚Äôs way more common than we'd like to admit.

I‚Äôve become obsessed with understanding what‚Äôs going on. After reading stacks of neuroscience books, listening to addiction researchers, and testing every advice from YouTube gurus to Stanford-led research labs, I realized most of the tips online are either oversimplified or outright wrong. Especially the dopamine detox hacks pushed by influencers who don‚Äôt understand the science they‚Äôre spouting.

So here‚Äôs a straight-up, research-backed, no-BS guide to rebuilding your dopamine system ‚Äî so you can stop burning out, start focusing, and actually enjoy long-term goals again.

1. Cut overstimulation, don‚Äôt go full monk mode  
Dopamine isn‚Äôt evil. You can‚Äôt (and shouldn‚Äôt) try to avoid it completely. What matters is how often and how intensely you‚Äôre spiking it. High-frequency, high-reward habits ‚Äî like TikTok, porn, processed food, or even hustle culture ‚Äî kill baseline dopamine over time. According to Dr. Anna Lembke from Stanford, repeated quick hits of dopamine lead to neuroadaptation, where your brain starts raising the threshold for pleasure (‚ÄúDopamine Nation,‚Äù 2021).

Start with one low-hanging habit. Delete the most mindless app. Delay your morning dopamine (no phone for the first hour). Replace with something neutral like stretching or reading. Over time, your sensitivity rebounds.

2. Get bored on purpose  
Modern boredom is a superpower. Dr. Andrew Huberman explained on his podcast that intentional boredom ‚Äî just sitting, walking without inputs, or doing nothing ‚Äî allows dopamine receptors to reset. No, it‚Äôs not fun at first. But that‚Äôs the entire point.

Once you stop ‚Äútopping up‚Äù your dopamine every 5 minutes, your brain starts finding interest in slower, deeper experiences again. You‚Äôll crave books, real convos, progress. It‚Äôs weirdly magical.

3. Move your body to regulate reward  
Exercise doesn‚Äôt just burn calories, it literally boosts dopamine production and receptor sensitivity. A study published in Neurobiology of Disease (Meeusen et al., 2022) shows that aerobic movement increases dopamine release and reduces reward system dysfunction.

You don‚Äôt need CrossFit. Go for daily walks. Do 15-minute bodyweight circuits. Dance in your damn kitchen. Make movement part of your baseline, not a ‚Äútask‚Äù.

4. Delay gratification in tiny ways  
Train your dopamine system like a muscle. The more you resist instant pleasure, the more resilient your brain becomes. Choose the longer path on purpose. Hold off on coffee for 90 minutes. Don‚Äôt eat immediately after waking. Split work into 25-minute focus sessions before any ‚Äúreward‚Äù.

These micro-moments stack. And they rewire your brain to crave effort, not escape.

5. Learn slower, deeper  
Dopamine gets triggered not just by pleasure, but by anticipation and novelty. Long-form learning keeps dopamine flowing in a sustainable rhythm. Read books. Watch long interviews. Reflect. Avoid the endless ‚Äúquick tips‚Äù loop ‚Äî it overloads your system without giving you mastery.

One of the best podcasts that explains this well is Dr. Daniel Lieberman on ‚ÄúThe Peter Attia Drive‚Äù ‚Äî they dive deep into dopamine as a prediction engine, not just a pleasure device.

Now the tools. These changed everything for me:

6. Read ‚ÄúDopamine Nation‚Äù by Dr. Anna Lembke  
This book blew my mind. It‚Äôs a New York Times bestseller, written by the Stanford addiction psychiatrist who treats patients battling everything from compulsive shopping to tech addiction. Lembke explains how modern life overdoses our dopamine circuits, and offers concrete tools to restore balance.

Most impactful part: her 30-day dopamine reset challenge + client stories that show real transformations. If you‚Äôve ever felt numb, restless, or dependent on stimulation, this is the most practical science-backed book I‚Äôve read. Best book on addiction and reward system I‚Äôve ever seen.

7. Listen to ‚ÄúThe Huberman Lab‚Äù episodes on dopamine  
Huberman is a Stanford neuroscientist who‚Äôs become a trusted name in behavioral neuroplasticity. His dopamine series breaks down the biology in a way that‚Äôs super accessible. He shares how behaviors like cold exposure, sleep regularity, and dopamine spacing can literally change your motivation baseline.

Also includes how substances like caffeine, nicotine, and even music affect your reward system. One of my favorite episodes is: ‚ÄúControlling Your Dopamine for Motivation, Focus & Satisfaction‚Äù.

8. Try the ‚ÄúStutz‚Äù method from the Netflix doc  
This doc features Jonah Hill working with his therapist Phil Stutz, who shares visual and behavioral tools for dealing with dopamine dips and emotional resistance. What stood out: the concept of ‚ÄúThe String of Pearls‚Äù ‚Äî just doing one small action at a time, each one building motivation through momentum.

There‚Äôs also ‚ÄúThe Life Force‚Äù triangle: body, people, self. Reconnect to these when your dopamine tanks. Simple but wildly effective.

9. Try to make learning addictive  
Check out the app ""Blinkist"" if you're short on time. It gives 15-minute summaries of top nonfiction books. Great for previewing deeper reads. But even better, try something that adapts to your long-term goals.

10. BeFreed  
This is an AI-powered self-learning app that builds a personalized learning path for you. It turns complex books, edge research, and expert talks into podcast-style guides ‚Äî in voices you actually pick. You choose how deep you wanna go: 10, 20, or 40 minutes. And over time, it learns what you're into and designs your own roadmap.

What‚Äôs wild is how it blends consistency with curiosity. It includes everything on reward systems, motivation science, addiction psychology, and even all the books I mentioned above. It‚Äôs like doing audio therapy for your focus and brain health.

Been using it during my walks instead of scrolling. It tracks what I learn. And those 10-minute swaps from doomscrolling to dopamine education? After 30 days, the change is real. More energy, deeper focus, fewer cravings.

BeFreed also reinforces two powerful habits: 1% daily progress, and 10-minutes-a-day replacement. Stack that for a year, and you won‚Äôt recognize yourself.

11. Watch ‚ÄúBetter Than Yesterday‚Äù YouTube by Productivity Game  
It simplifies high-impact books into animated summaries and gives clear takeaways you can use. Their breakdown of ‚ÄúAtomic Habits‚Äù and ‚ÄúDeep Work‚Äù helped me rethink distractions and dopamine triggers in my day. Perfect if you‚Äôre visual or short on time.

12. Use ‚ÄúForest‚Äù app to rebuild focus  
This one helps you stay off your phone and build deep work sessions. You grow a virtual tree for every focused session you complete. Sounds cheesy, but gamifying deep work is dopamine done right. Little wins for big rewires.

Don‚Äôt wait for motivation. Design a system that feeds on meaning, not mindless hits. That‚Äôs how you rebuild your dopamine ‚Äî one friction-filled, beautiful step at a time.",1,1761960641.0,CuriousAF,0,1.0,False
1olbu6m,https://www.reddit.com/r/overlord/comments/1olbu6m/a_nightmare_in_nazarick_lupusregina_vs_freddy/,A Nightmare in Nazarick: Lupusregina vs Freddy Krueger,"Nazarick early in the morning was bustling. Maids waking up, scrambling to get dressed, and immediately gnawing down on the day‚Äôs breakfast menu was the most common sight. 

But, down from the cafeteria, was where you would find the Pleiades living.

This abode had decadent red carpets on the floor and purple stained wood paneling for the walls.

The first room was large. It held a small area to make conversation, featuring a sofa and a coffee table, as well as a doorway leading to the kitchen and dining area where the pleiades tea parties were held. Another doorway led to the bedroom's hallway. The left door led to one room, while the right led to a separate one. They had 6 beds altogether, split between two rooms. Each bedroom had it's own bathroom, though that did little to alleviate fights.

The Left Room was the room of Yuri Alpha, Lupusregina Beta, and Narberal Gamma.

It had 3 queen sized beds with the same plain white sheets, 2 gold frilled pillows, and floral purple comforters. Yet, if you knew most anything about the sisters, you could tell who‚Äôs bed was who‚Äôs at a glance.

Yuri Alpha‚Äôs bed was made perfectly. Although the undead didn‚Äôt have to sleep, Ainz insisted Yuri rest. So she‚Äôd lay down at night with a book to ‚Äúrelax‚Äù. But as soon as the workaholic (even amongst Nazarick) woke up, she would remake her bed. Comforter and blanket tucked in under the mattress, and pillow on an exact parallel.

Narberal‚Äôs bed was a bit more rough. But still perfect. Though she didn‚Äôt go to as much trouble to tuck her comforter in, she still ensured her bed was kept well. 

Even more so because she had been adventuring as Nabe recently, with many night missions.

Then Lupusregina‚Äôs bed. 

Now did Lupusregina know how to make a bed? Yes. She was a maid after all. One of the best in the world. 

But did she make hers? Just once a week.

Usually it was in this state.

Blanket and comforter tugged tightly around Lupusregina as she snuggled into her pillow, dripping drool on it. A telltale sign of a great sleep, in Lupusregina's words.

Yet, the wolf burrito‚Äôs idyllic scene came to an end.

‚ÄúLupusregina Beta!‚Äù Uh oh. Full name. 

Yuri walked in, scolding her little sister.

‚ÄúIt is 7:30! It is time to wake up!‚Äù

‚ÄúNuuu‚Ä¶five ‚Äòmor minuts‚Ä¶‚Äù

Yuri glared coldly at her younger sister.

‚ÄúYou are supposed to be up at 6:00 sharp. The fact you aren't is-‚Äù blah blah blah.

Lupu had great hearing. Also great at selecting her hearing.

‚Äú... Breakfast is ready.‚Äù Ope, that did it.

Lupusregina immediately tried to roll out of bed, but ended up getting tangled in her blanket.

After 5 minutes of struggle, Lupus managed to be free of her comfy prison and proceeded to put on her maid dress.

The werewolf ran to the dining table! ‚Ä¶and promptly felt her heart break into a million pieces.

No breakfast. Yuri had just begun making it.

‚Äú...Yuri whyyyy~su!?‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn't think that you'd get up immediately. I assumed you'd fall back asleep.‚Äù

Lupu sat down with a pout. She didn't wanna wait for her bacon.

‚ÄúGot you too, huh~su?‚Äù 

‚Äú... yeahhhh‚Ä¶‚Äù Entoma replied to Lupusregina's question before biting into a green biscuit.

Shizu didn't really need to eat food, so she just sipped on a Chocolate Strawberry Banana protein shake. She knew how to brew it herself and didn't have to make Yuri do it.

Whereas Solution and Entoma were forced to wait for their elder sister to cook human meat for the two of them.

‚ÄúEntoma, please attempt to angle the crumbs away from my drink.‚Äù Shizu spoke as Lupusregina laid her head down on the table.

‚ÄúOhhh? Ya mean like thissss?‚Äù Entoma took a big bite of her biscuit right above Shizu‚Äôs drink.

‚Äú...you know that is exactly what I meant.‚Äù

‚ÄúNow, now, you two quit fighting.‚Äù Solution raised her arms, gently trying to ease the tension between the two baby sisters.

‚ÄúYes. Or else I will have to punish you.‚Äù Yuri darkly responded as she stepped over to the table. You could barely make out her eyes under the gleam of her glasses.

‚ÄúHere. Allow me to demonstrate on this mongrel.‚Äù Yuri glared at Lupusregina.

‚ÄúWha-Yuri nee? That's pretty fucking rude don‚Äôtcha think?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think it's damn disgusting to have such an idiot sister. Here, I will dispose of that trash, my dear sisters.‚Äù Yuri reached out fast as a whip and roughly grappled Lupusregina‚Äôs bangs.

‚ÄúAh!‚Äù Lupu awoke from the nightmare, hitting her knee on the table.

‚ÄúLupu? Are you okay?‚Äù Yuri‚Äôs big sister instincts kicked in quickly. For as often as she would scold Lupusregina, and ask why her sister was made so stupid, and even pray to the Yammiko shrine for her to be less evil, Yuri loved each and every one of her sisters.

‚ÄúH-Huh?‚Äù Lupu noticed the eyes on her.

‚ÄúO-Oh yeah. Just‚Ä¶just a nightmare.‚Äù Yuri responded with a sigh as she placed her palm on her face and tilted her head down.

‚ÄúReally Lupusregina? Falling asleep at breakfast? Whatever will I do with you?‚Äù

‚ÄúGimme bacon?‚Äù 

‚Äú...I suppose.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

Lupusregina gently drifted down to Carne village. 

‚ÄúOh! Lupusregina, yer finally here huh?‚Äù Jugem walked through the crowd, away from the crime scene.

‚ÄúYeah, Ainz sama had some things for me to do. What's going on~su? Did someone die? That would be soooooo‚Ä¶hilarious~‚Äù Jugem shuddered. Never trusted her.

‚ÄúWhere's Enri~su?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe's safe.‚Äù

Lupusregina snickered. So that's how he was gonna be today, huh?

‚ÄúYou know that wasn't my question.‚Äù

Jugem crossed his arms.

‚ÄúWell that's my answer.‚Äù Jugem didn't hate Nazarick. Far from it. But he could tell Lupusregina was dangerous, and he refused to let any danger befall his commander Enri.

But, he would do what Enri said.

So when Enri came waltzing over with a grin waving at Lupusregina, he couldn't do much.

‚ÄúHey Lupus!‚Äù Lupusregina immediately went back to smiling.

‚ÄúHey En Chan~su!‚Äù The werewolf responded.

‚ÄúI actually have a question I'd like for you to bring up to the upper levels, if you wouldn't mind. It's about our manure storage-‚Äù

‚ÄúYep, let's get going Femri~su.‚Äù Lupusregina wandered over to one of Carne's barns with Enri following her.

Once they got inside Enri slammed the door shut behind them.

‚ÄúLupusregina!!! Why'd you take so long to get here!?‚Äù The village chief grabbed onto Lupu and shook her slightly.

‚ÄúI was busy~su! I have other jobs besides this!‚Äù

‚ÄúLike what-murdering my villagers?‚Äù Lupu was surprised. Not at the murder allegations, Lupusregina loved herself some killing. 

‚ÄúYou know good and well I make sure people know who I killed and why.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell then-‚Äù Enri flailed her arms around ‚ÄúI don't know then!‚Äù

Lupusregina took a deep breath and showed off her (rarely showcased) big sister skills.

‚ÄúEnri, breath. Start from the beginning. Tell me everything I need to know. Okay?‚Äù Enri then began to tell Lupusregina everything that had happened.

A man had been murdered. His name was ‚ÄúLoken‚Äù. The only witness was his wife, an odd woman by the name of Ash. 

Ash claimed that the couple were fast asleep one night, she went to use the outhouse, but when she returned she found her husband flailing and screaming as boils erupted over his body and his skin blistered with a hellish red.

The neighbors heard her screaming and found her sobbing in a puddle of her own urine.

‚ÄúUh huh‚Ä¶so she killed her husband.‚Äù Lupusregina stated plainly.

‚ÄúI mean‚Ä¶that's the main theory the goblins have but shouldn't we‚Ä¶investigate more?‚Äù

‚ÄúEh, why not. Fun way to kill a couple of minutes.‚Äù 

Lupusregina left the barn and headed to the scene. She always did like how crowds would part for her.

The hut was average. Stone walls, thatched roof, two rooms. A living area/kitchen and a bedroom. Complete with dirt floors. Out back was a single cow and a hut to age cheese, showing how the former couple made their money. 

At a time, this would be considered a great house in Carne. Belonging to a pillar of the community. But with the expansion and development of Carne, this house was now lower class.

Lupusregina entered the home, following the scent of flesh to see the body.

Just as Enri described it. A man with slightly spiky hair and some facial hair, his expression tied up in agony with blisters and red skin.

He laid on a wet straw bed.

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶any uhh‚Ä¶clues?‚Äù Enri asked Lupusregina, eager to push this responsibility to someone else.

‚ÄúI already solved it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou what!?‚Äù Lupusregina leaned back.

‚ÄúEasy peasy~su. She boiled some water, poured on him when he was sleeping, pissed herself, then started screaming and sat in the corner sobbing crocodile tears. Tale as old as time~su!‚Äù Lupusregina said, ignoring that this was the first time she had ever seen this or heard of anything like this.

‚ÄúAre you sure? I don't want to hurt an-‚Äù Lupusregina put her finger on Enri‚Äôs lips.

‚ÄúDon't worry. It's gonna get handled. Go do‚Ä¶paperwork or something. I'll handle the punishment.‚Äù Ignoring Enri‚Äôs response, Lupusregina walked over to the ‚Äúprison‚Äù.

A small shed with two goblins guarding the door. Carne never had much crime, so they didn't really need a prison. Usually Nazarick would kill criminals or send them to the happy farm. 

‚ÄúStand aside for the overseer of Carne village~su.‚Äù A neat trick Lupu had picked up from a book Ainz himself had read, using official titles made people less likely to refuse you.

Grumbling, the goblins moved as Lupusregina opened the door and found the killer.

She was young. 19? Human as well. Auburn hair with a tear tracked face. She wore a simple cloth dress as she looked up at Lupusregina with big hazel eyes.

‚ÄúY-You‚Äôre-‚Äù Ash began, but Lupusregina cut her off.

‚ÄúYour executioner.‚Äù Just as Ash heard that, her eyes dropped and her mouth opened wide in fear.

‚ÄúW-What!? Get away from me!‚Äù She scrambled away as tears welled up once more.

Lupusregina didn't mind. This was fun! She grabbed the woman's heel and dragged her out. Ash tried to grab onto the door frame but it was useless.

Once they had made it out of the jail, Lupusregina cast fly. Holding Ash's heel the whole time. 

A bruise would most certainly be left, if the woman survived.

‚ÄúPlease! Please don't do this! I didn't kill him!‚Äù 

‚ÄúWow! Lying even now? You're persistent! Just for that, I'll go a bit higher.‚Äù Enjoying the wailing, Lupusregina continued to fly upwards. Stopping at around 10 stories high.

‚ÄúAny last words?‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn't do it! Please, I know you're good! You have to be! Please!‚Äù Even a drowning man will grasp at straws it seems. 

A crowd had formed by now. Watching this scene with bated breath and wet eyes. Parents yelled at their children to go inside and goblins averted their gaze.

Lupusregina let go.










Splat.

It was silent. One person screamed, another gasped, but the quietness of death held the village taught.

The maid floated down, gently placing her feet on the ground by the body. 

It had ruptured. The limbs that were still attached were bent in grotesque ways, while an eyeball slowly fell out of a part of the skull.

Lupusregina began to speak.

‚ÄúI want you to remember this. Each of you. I want you to tell this story to your children. Of Nazarick‚Äôs dominance. This woman felt a mercy not many will get. She got to die quickly. If you ever murder a person under Nazarick's protection, you lose that protection yourself. So, you will become my plaything. If you're lucky, you'll get to be broken like this. If you're not, then you'll be treated to horror beyond comprehension. Do not murder in Ainz Ooal Gown‚Äôs land.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

Mare was alright. Lupu typically preferred to hang out with Aura because she was more fun and because playing with Fenn was always a good time.

But Lupusregina couldn't say she really disliked anyone from Nazarick. Sure her and Shalltear fought all the time, but if push came to shove she'd defend the flat chested one and was sure Shalltear would return the favor.

‚ÄúT-Thanks for coming with me Lupus!‚Äù Mare was thanking Lupusregina for coming to the library with him to pick up books.

‚ÄúDon't mention it Girlyboy~su.‚Äù Ah, there was his blush. 

Adorable.

Hilarious.

Hilorable.

This was the reason Lupusregina came. Always fun to tease someone.

‚ÄúSo? What's that one about?‚Äù She pointed at one of the books she had gotten him. 

It had a off-white hardcover with a picture of some wimpy scholar on top. Maybe it was the top 10 ways to look nerdy and pathetic? Mare would like that. The black embossed words on the cover read: ‚ÄúThe Canterbury Tales‚Äù.

‚ÄúO-Oh! This is the ummm, Canterbury Tales.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can read~su. I meant like what's the plot and shit, nerd~su.‚Äù Lupusregina sat down and rested her cheek on her hand.

Mare stuttered more as he began to explain the book.

‚ÄúIt's uhh‚Ä¶about‚Ä¶these pilgrims. They're having this story telling contest. Bukubukuchagama sama was in one of the adaptations of it‚Ä¶‚Äù He got sad, so did Lupusregina. Remembering the supreme beings that had left always had this impression on Nazarikians.

‚ÄúS-So yeah‚Ä¶I've read it before but I uhh-wanted to read it again‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúM-Maybe you'd like it? There's some really uhh‚Ä¶‚Äù He looked around.

‚Äú...dirty stories in here.‚Äù He giggled. It was cute how he thought she'd be offended.

‚ÄúYeah, if you want to you can read some to me. I won't complain.‚Äù Lupusregina laid her head on the desk.

‚ÄúS-Sure!‚Äù Mare spoke with eager happy eyes as he opened the book and began to read aloud the work of Chaucer.

‚ÄúWhen in April the sweet showers fall, and pierce the drought of March to Root and all‚Ä¶‚Äù Mare spoke the ancient rhyming couplets, lulling Lupusregina as her eyelids felt heavier and heavier‚Ä¶

‚Äú...Hey? Mare?‚Äù But once Lupusregina had opened them up, she was alone.

The library was dark, all the lights had gone off. What the hell was going on?

‚ÄúMare? Titus? ‚Ä¶anyone?‚Äù Lupusregina got up, wiping up her slobber puddle, and began to search to find out what happened.

‚ÄúOne, two Freddy's coming for you‚Äù Lupusregina began to hear a haunting lullaby as she walked through the library.

‚ÄúThree, four, better lock your door‚Äù Lupusregina looked around a bookcase and saw three ethereal, almost stereotypical human girls.

‚ÄúFive, Six, Grab your crucifix‚Äù Two of them were holding a jump rope and swinging it, while the third jumped it. As the name would imply.

‚ÄúSeven, Eight, better stay up late‚Äù They must have been Yuri‚Äôs kids. 

‚ÄúNine, Ten, Never sleep again.‚Äù 

‚ÄúHahahah! You are some weird kids ya know that~su?‚Äù Lupusregina belly laughed at these freaks. Yuri always got the weird ones.

‚ÄúThey always were.‚Äù A gravelly voice spoke out behind her.

She turned around in an instant as her nose filled with a disgusting rotting smell with a hint of smoke.

Lupusregina then beheld, in all his ‚Äúglory‚Äù, Freddy Krueger.

Her hairs stood up on end, as she attempted to reach into her inventory to retrieve her crosier.

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù But, Lupusregina couldn't. She attempted to open the portal to her inventory, but there was nothing. She still had her magic however, so she would make do.

‚ÄúTell me. Right now, who are you? Who let you in?‚Äù

‚ÄúDidn't you listen to the song?‚Äù He laughed.

‚ÄúI'm Freddy Krueger!‚Äù He threw his arms out wide, almost as if he was offering her a hug.

Lupusregina growled at this intruder.

She pointed out her right index finger and began to speak a prayer. She didn't believe a word of it, but nonetheless a column of fire fell down from the heavens.

It incarcerated him in seconds. 

‚ÄúThey tried that once, didn't work!‚Äù Freddy appeared again. On top of a bookshelf this time.

He held up a book. A dark red cover with golden writing carved in angular letters. ‚ÄúFreddy's story!‚Äù

‚ÄúOnce upon a time‚Ä¶‚Äù he began to read as he opened the book. 

It showed a childlike scribble of a younger Fred. Before he was burnt.

‚ÄúIn a far, far away place called ‚ÄúSpringwood‚Äù there was a janitor called ‚ÄúFreddy‚Äù. Freddy loved playing games!‚Äù Lupusregina threw a fireball at him. The same thing happened. He simply dissipated and appeared again somewhere else. Still telling his story.

‚ÄúAnd his favorite game?‚Äù Freddy turned the page to a bunch of red scribbles.

‚ÄúKilling those ungrateful little crotch goblin fucks!‚Äù 

‚ÄúKilling kids? Pfft. That's pathetic. It's like playing a game with cheats on.‚Äù Lupusregina never killed kids. Not just because Yuri would disembowel her, but also because of what she said. No thrill.

No sport.

No power.

She never even tried because of those reasons.

‚ÄúOh, but then the parents found out!‚Äù He turned the page once more, showing the same ugly drawing of himself burning up.

‚ÄúThey were real sad and fuckin whiny about what he had done, so they burnt him to a crisp!‚Äù Freddy continued to turn the pages. Skipping over several.

‚ÄúYada, yada, yada, Freddy came back! He haunted each of those bitches in their dreams and slaughtered them!‚Äù He showed some of his greatest hits. Slamming a wannabees head into a TV, pulling a kid into a hole before eviscerating him, even when he gave a former junkie magic dream heroin! 

Some of his less than great ones were there too. Like the power glove. And super Freddy. Super Freddy suckssss.

‚ÄúBut, there was another! An Auburn fucker by the name of ‚ÄúAshley‚Äù!‚Äù ‚Ä¶wait that drawing looked familiar.

‚ÄúShe got away! Got hit by some truck and ended up in another world~!!!‚Äù Freddy threw his hand out.

‚ÄúBut no one runs from Freddy for long. She took a new name, got a husband and a house. She had everything. So, Freddy decided he would take that away first.‚Äù

Next page. Her husband being drowned in a boiling pot.

‚ÄúHe was going to kill everyone she cared about. Ruin her. And only then, give her release.‚Äù Then he flipped the page and Lupusregina saw her own portrait in the book. Lupu, 10 stories high, with a red stain on the ground beneath her.

‚ÄúThen a bitch killed her first.‚Äù Freddy slammed the book shut, and the library went dark‚Ä¶

‚ÄúNow what'll happen?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis Hunter‚Ä¶is going to have to kill the big bad Wolf himself!‚Äù His mocking laugh continued as Lupusregina searched for him.

‚ÄúLupusregina! Lupusreginaaa! Lupusreginaaaaa~!‚Äù He spoke in a familiar voice. It was young, it was just like, Mare‚Äôs shaking woke Lupusregina up.

‚ÄúLupusregina! Lupusreginaaa! Lupusreginaaaaa~! You're finally awake! ‚Ä¶w-why did you fall asleep? That's‚Ä¶th-that was‚Ä¶kind of‚Ä¶mean.‚Äù

Lupusregina took a second to regain her senses. She shook her head and replaced her shocked fearful face with a content calm one.

‚ÄúOh, m-my apologies master Mare.‚Äù She bowed slightly.

‚Äú...A-Are you‚Ä¶o-okay? You don't usually call me that‚Ä¶‚Äù Mare pushed his fingers together. Although he could care less about what happened to anyone outside of Nazarick, he did have love for everyone within the tomb.

‚ÄúYes. Don't worry it was just‚Ä¶a‚Ä¶a bad dream.‚Äù 

‚ÄúA-Alright, Miss Lupusregina.‚Äù

Lupu took a deep breath.

‚ÄúSorry for falling asleep during your story. Do you wanna get back to it?‚Äù

‚Ä¶

Lupusregina failed Ainz.

The crushing weight of this was felt throughout the throne room as all of Nazarick stared down upon her.

‚ÄúLupusregina Beta.‚Äù The supreme being spoke as Lupusregina kneeled apologeticly.

‚ÄúYou idiot bitch!‚Äù Ainz Ooal Gown slammed his staff down on the ground, sending a shockwave out.

‚ÄúI gave you a simple task, you insolent mutt. But instead of completing it, you flaunted it and as a result, me.‚Äù His eye sockets glowed red with rage as he glared down upon the maid.

Lupusregina began to silently cry. She would have openly sobbed, but her dedication to not wanting to disappoint her master any more won out.

‚ÄúI hate you. You're the reason the rest of the supreme beings left, I'm sure.‚Äù That was it. Lupusregina collapsed, sobbing loudly.

‚ÄúYou can't even take a scolding.‚Äù Lupusregina tried to stammer out apologies, but Ainz raised his hand.

‚ÄúShut up. Take her to the dungeons at once. I never want to see you again, you disgusting, idiotic, mongrel face ever again.‚Äù Two figures began to drag Lupusregina away. 

She didn't fight them. This was her punishment after all. What kind of maid disobeyed their master‚Äôs punishment, after disobeying him. 

Soon Lupus found herself in the deepest area of the dungeons. She wasn't even sure where it was.

It had pipes all over, and a glaring red light all around. It was hot, and smelled of burnt hair.

‚ÄúWell, well, well‚Ä¶‚Äù the figures were gone now, but Lupusregina remained kneeling. She wasn't a perfect maid, but she wanted to be. She wanted to be good for Ainz. 

‚ÄúWelcome to my world!‚Äù Krueger spoke as he appeared. 

He approached slowly. Dragging his finger knives across the wall with a vile screeeeeech.

Lupusregina didn't move.

‚ÄúNow it's time to go to sleep!‚Äù He was in front of her now, and raised his finger knives up high.

This was Lupusregina‚Äôs punishment. Krueger.

Lupusregina didn't move.

The knives came down.

Lupusregina didn't move.

The skin on the left side of her face split, and blood began to pour out right next to her eye.

Lupusregina didn't move.

He slashed to the side, tearing her dress and cutting her ribs.

Lupusregina didn't move.

He went behind her and stabbed into her back flesh.

Lupusregina didn't move.

He slashed at her elbows. Tearing sinew and cartilage.

Lupusregina didn't move.

Krueger grabbed her hair, and pulled her head back. Exposing her neck, he placed his middle finger knife right across it.

‚ÄúGood night.‚Äù As he reared back to end her life, Lupusregina jerked awake.

‚ÄúLupusregina Beta! It is time to wake up!‚Äù Yuri‚Äôs voice was scolding and harsh. Yet Lupusregina shed tears of joy.

‚ÄúIt‚Ä¶it wasn't‚Ä¶real‚Ä¶?‚Äù Then‚Ä¶where did the cuts come from? 

Wait.

Cuts? Oh shit. Oh that was a lot. 

Half of Lupusregina‚Äôs vision was obscured by red, and her whole body stung and burnt with blood pouring out.

She immediately cast major Cure wounds on herself, her flesh knitting itself together as she felt her strength return.

Yuri burst in the room and glared darkly at her little sister.

‚ÄúI told you to-‚Äù Yuri looked shocked, almost like she was looking through Lupusregina.

Just then, Lupusregina noticed the blood on her sheets. Her blood on the bed sheets. 

‚ÄúY-Yuri there was a‚Ä¶a man with-with finger knives and-and he had a hat-‚Äù 

‚ÄúStop it. I told you, explicitly, do not take your prey back to our room to kill. I told Solution this. I told Entoma this.‚Äù Ah. So Yuri thought it wasn't Lupusregina's blood‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶

Lupus hadn't slept for 3 days.

Her eyelids felt like stones. 

Whenever she sat down she felt herself slipping back into sleep before she shook herself back up.

‚ÄúLupu? Come on.‚Äù Yuri demanded the attention of her canine sister.

‚ÄúHuh? O-Oh yeah.‚Äù Lupusregina got back to eating her dinner.

‚ÄúIt's not like big sis Lupu to wait to eat‚Ä¶‚Äù Entoma mused as she munched a tarantula.

‚ÄúYes. It is weird.‚Äù Shizu added.

‚ÄúHey now y'all! I'm the big sister, you're the babies. Let me worry about you~su!‚Äù Lupusregina went back to her cheer. 

‚ÄúShe's just having nightmares. There's no need to worry.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat the fuck Solly~su!?‚Äù

‚ÄúSolution, we are working through this. Unless you plan to join me tomorrow to look for books about dreams, I see no reason for you to comment on it.‚Äù Yuri scolded. Lupu didn't like this. Usually Lupu was the teaser getting told off!

Since Lupusregina‚Äôs worst nightmare where she was brutally attacked, she had refused to sleep.

Yuri thought it was all in her mind. So she tried helping Lupusregina anyway she could, beyond sleep scrolls.

Yuri swapped out the average Pleiades‚Äôs morning tea with Lavender, she gave Lupus Melatonin supplements, and even tried putting Cedarwood oil on her pillows. But it wasn't working. Lupusregina was still scared to sleep.

So Yuri began working another way. She began to spend her nights in the library, flipping through manuscripts about Sigmund Freud and Dream Theory‚Äôs. 

Yuri‚Äôs face was cold. But she was scared for her little sister.

Lupusregina poked around at her steak. But she saw something out of the corner of her eye‚Ä¶

A shadow on the wall, five sharp blades spaced apart‚Ä¶no, Lupusregina wasn't asleep was she?

‚ÄúHave you tried pinching yourself?‚Äù A voice from under the table.

His voice.

That doesn't make sense.

‚ÄúDo you guys hear that?‚Äù Lupusregina asked her bewildered sisters.

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry Lupusregina. No, I didn't.‚Äù

‚ÄúNegatory.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot a thing, big sis.‚Äù

‚ÄúUmm‚Ä¶A-Alright then.‚Äù Was she going crazy?

Screeeeeech.

There it was again. Lupusregina looked up and got shocked still. Freddy Krueger. His right arm extended beyond what a humans should, and his finger knives cut at the wall.

He walked forward‚Ä¶behind Entoma! 

He pulled his weapon back, soon to slay this bug.

‚Ä¶she wouldn't have it.

Lupusregina wouldn't fucking have it!

‚Ä¶

‚ÄúThe Pleiades's are sisters.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat makes no sense Mekongawa. None of them are the same race.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo!? Adoption is a thing Pero!‚Äù

‚ÄúBut that doesn't-‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm writing it right now! ‚ÄúThey are sisters and deeply love each other!‚Äù‚Äù

‚Ä¶

Lupusregina leaped across the table at this would be killer as her instincts overcame any fear.

She didn't even cast a spell or take out her weapon. She just used her natural claws.

But as she dived, she felt herself falling. She fell face first on the floor.

‚ÄúLupusregina Beta!‚Äù Yuri yelled out.

‚ÄúWhat the hell are you doing!?‚Äù She scolded as she brought Lupusregina up.

Lupus didn't even say a word, she simply showed Yuri what she caught.

‚Äú...it's his hat.‚Äù

Yuri gently brought her hand out and picked up the charred fedora.

‚Äú...all this over a hat?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNo! He was there! I-‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. He wasn't there. He wasn't anywhere. This is something called ‚ÄúMicrosleep‚Äù. You're having dreams while awake.‚Äù Yuri took a deep breath.

‚ÄúI'm sorry to do this Lupusregina‚Ä¶but I can't have you doing this to yourself.‚Äù Yuri reached into her inventory and began to read out a scroll inscribed with a spell.

The spell?

‚ÄúSleep.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

Once more Lupusregina kneeled before Ainz.

Intruder‚Äôs attacked Nazarick.

They made it as far as the 9th floor.

‚ÄúLupusregina Beta. Your sisters are dead. You are the last of the Pleiades's. Can I entrust you to stand guard while I prepare my escape?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes Ainz sama.‚Äù Lupusregina spoke, willing to put her life on the line for her master.

‚ÄúGood. You were a good maid Lupus.‚Äù He turned around and began to head to his chambers.

Lupusregina stood up and held her weapon high. She mumbled prayer after prayer, buffing herself however she could.

She knew she'd die. This was to be the last stand of the last Pleiades. But she wasn't afraid.

Loyalty to the end was the motto of Nazarick. 

So she waited.

And waited.

For a long, long time.

She couldn't tell if it was minutes.

Or hours.

Or even days.

But she waited.

‚Ä¶What if he died?

No! No Ainz couldn't have died! Lupusregina would have fought the intruder first! 

But if they made it this far‚Ä¶they could have just snuck by couldn't they?

It wouldn't hurt to just‚Ä¶check his chambers right?

So Lupusregina went to Ainz Sama‚Äôs chamber through the eerie quiet. 

As she pushed the door ajar, her greatest fear was realized.

There he was. Not Ainz, but HIM.

Freddy Krueger. Backlit by flame, standing amongst the shattered and spread out bones of Ainz Ooal Gown.

Lupusregina fell to her knees as he cackled.

She failed at her only job.

‚ÄúI'm your supreme being now, bitch!‚Äù

‚Äú...not a chance in hell!‚Äù Lupusregina dashed forward with all her zealotry and swung her Crosier.

Krueger was taken aback, to speak the truth. She was supposed to have despaired and become easy pickings!

This wasn't fun anymore.

‚ÄúJust fucking die already!‚Äù He pivoted and slashed at her.

She screamed with torn flesh as she swung her weapon once more.

‚ÄúThis isn't real. Some wannabe killer couldn't have beaten Ainz sama.‚Äù Lupusregina knew this wasn't real.

Then she felt it. Shaking.

It was an odd feeling to put into words. It was like someone was shaking her guts and organs, while her body stayed still.

‚Äú...Yuri!‚Äù Lupusregina suffered another set of slashes right above her breast as she charged down the blasphemer. Not to hit him, but to grapple him.

She made it just in time, as she woke up.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck-‚Äù Krueger was pissed off. This wasn't how this was supposed to go at all!

He just wanted to kill the final bitch on his hit list and now he's dragged out of the dream world into the maids bedroom? 

He felt the air strike his sweater from the lower left, but by the time he noticed it he felt something crack and another thing pop.

‚ÄúAghhhh!‚Äù He could only let out an anguished cry at Yuri Alpha's attack.

‚ÄúLupusregina! Are you okay!? Heal right-‚Äù She was already on it.

‚ÄúPant‚Ä¶pant‚Ä¶do you fucking believe me now?‚Äù Lupusregina pointed to the burn victim on the floor.

‚Äú...Yes. I'm so sorry Lupusregina.‚Äù Yuri bowed her head.

Lupusregina took a step forward at her new prey. She stomped on his left ankle, shattering it.

‚ÄúFuckin-Whore bitch!‚Äù 

‚ÄúIn your little dream world, you could do anything. Here? You're not even fit to be fed to Entoma.‚Äù 

The Springwood slasher laughed at her.

‚ÄúWhat? You gonna kill me!? Just try! I came back once!‚Äù 

Hmph, he was right about that‚Ä¶perfect.

Lupusregina let her grin spread fully.

‚ÄúAmazing. Come back whenever you want then. I'll play with you. Teach you what happens to those who disrespect the supreme one. Besides. They killed you once before, who says it can't happen again?‚Äù 

She snapped her fingers.

Krueger was confused for a second. Before a similar sensation came. 

Not like before. But from inside.

‚ÄúRaghhhhh!‚Äù He began to claw away at his sweater, eager to get it out. Something was burning inside him.

Did this bitch cast a spell? He could barely think anymore. The flames reached his brain.

And so Kreugar‚Äôs invasion of Nazarick ended the way his journey as a Demon began.

In flame his eyeballs boiled and liquefied as his body turned to ash once more.

‚Äú...Haha‚Ä¶Hahaha! Bwahahahahahaa!‚Äù Lupusregina chuckled madly at this. The perfect display!

‚ÄúThis is awesome! Just the best! Hahaha! This is amazing!‚Äù She spoke of her triumph.

‚ÄúLupusregina. You killed an invader who managed to make it to the 9th floor. We have to tell Ainz at once.‚Äù

Lupusregina‚Äôs sadistic Bliss was disturbed as Yuri began to pick up the ashes of the bastard who dared to disrespect Nazarick and Ainz Ooal Gown.

‚ÄúYes, of course.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon't worry however. I'm sure he'll let you take any reward you wish‚Ä¶what would you want anyway? If you had to choose anything except more work for Ainz sama, of course.‚Äù

Lupusregina thought. Though it didn't take long.

Lupusregina didn't want to ‚Äúsleep with Ainz‚Äù. She wanted to sleep ‚Äúlike‚Äù Ainz. His bed was the greatest in all the lands. An Alaska king with silk sheets and the fluffiest pillows.

‚ÄúI wanna sleep in Ainz sama‚Äôs bed~su!‚Äù

__________________________________
**2026-03-14 Saturday [Evening 04:00 PM]**

**(Normal POV)**

Two years had passed since that day.
The day that changed both of their lives forever.

From that moment on, neither of them spoke again. No messages. No calls. Just silence. The kind of silence that echoes louder than words ever could.

Time had moved forward, dragging them along with it, but the pain never really disappeared‚Äîit just faded into the background, like an old scar that sometimes aches when it rains.

Mikasa felt that pain more than anyone. She had tried to bury it under her studies, her new routines, her responsibilities‚Äîbut it lingered, like a ghost that refused to leave. Back then, when Eren walked out of her life, she had no choice but to face the emptiness that came after. Her world, which once revolved around him, suddenly stopped spinning. She was lost. Broken. Alone again.

It took months‚Äîno, almost a year‚Äîfor her to pull herself together. The nights she cried quietly into her pillow slowly turned into nights of restless staring at the ceiling. The pain dulled, but it never left.

Now, two years later, her life looked different‚Äîon the outside, at least.
She had graduated several months ago.
She had a stable job now, one that paid her decently and kept her busy enough to avoid thinking too much. She had moved out of her old apartment‚Äîthe one filled with memories of him‚Äîand found a smaller, quieter place on the other side of the city.

The new apartment was clean, tidy, and peaceful. But sometimes, when the evening light hit the walls just right, she still felt the same emptiness echo inside her chest.

Her days were simple. Work, eat, sleep, repeat. She occasionally met her friends or texted them in their group chat. They were her only real comfort now‚Äîsmall reminders that she wasn‚Äôt completely alone in this world.

She hadn‚Äôt heard a single thing about Eren since that last call. Not a word. Not a rumor. Not even a passing mention.
She had no idea where he was now‚ÄîFrance, perhaps‚Ä¶ or maybe somewhere else entirely.
She never checked his social media. She never asked Armin, even though she could have.

It wasn‚Äôt that she didn‚Äôt want to know.
She just didn‚Äôt have the strength to find out.

Over these two years, Mikasa had changed. She had grown quieter, gentler‚Äîmore mature.
But the sadness was still there, hidden beneath that calm exterior, resting in the corners of her heart where no one could see.

Sometimes, when she looked out the window at the fading orange sky, she found herself wondering‚Äî
Does he ever think of me too?
Or has he already forgotten everything?

She smiled faintly, though her chest ached with the familiar heaviness. **‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter anymore,‚Äù** she whispered to herself. **‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all in the past now.‚Äù**

But deep down, she knew‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt.


**(Mikasa‚Äôs POV)**

The streets were calm, as they usually were on weekends. The air was warm and gentle, carrying the scent of blooming flowers from the roadside. The sky glowed a soft shade of gold, streaked with fading clouds. Birds drifted lazily across the horizon as I walked down the road, heels clicking softly against the pavement.

I was on my way to someone‚Äôs engagement ceremony.
Jean‚Äôs and Pieck‚Äôs.

They had been together for months now ‚Äî and today, they were finally getting engaged. Jean had personally invited all of us. I couldn‚Äôt say no. After all, it was one of those moments where everyone from our group would be there again.

Still, part of me wasn‚Äôt sure if I wanted to go.

Jean and Pieck‚Ä¶ Armin and Annie‚Ä¶ everyone around me seemed to have moved on with their lives ‚Äî found their own peace, their own happiness. And me? I was still standing in the same place, pretending like I had too.

When I reached the venue, I stopped for a moment to take in the view. The hall was decorated beautifully ‚Äî soft golden lights, flowers hanging from the ceiling, the kind of warmth that made people smile. Laughter filled the air. Everyone looked happy.

Except me.

I stood quietly among the crowd as Jean and Pieck stepped forward, side by side. They looked so content, so sure of each other. For a brief moment, I felt something twist deep inside my chest ‚Äî not jealousy, but guilt.

Years ago, Jean had confessed his feelings to me.
And I rejected him ‚Äî kindly, but firmly.
Because my heart already belonged to someone else.

Now, standing there, watching him smile at another woman, I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder‚Ä¶
*Should I have accepted his proposal back then?*

I shook my head immediately, scolding myself.
No. If I had, I wouldn‚Äôt have the memories I shared with Eren.
And even though those memories ended painfully, they were still real. Still mine.

But then again‚Ä¶ why was I even thinking about him now?
Why, after all this time, did his name still echo in my head?

**‚ÄúHe‚Äôs gone,‚Äù** I whispered under my breath, forcing the words out. **‚ÄúHe left. So stop thinking about him, Mikasa.‚Äù**

I sighed and turned away, quietly slipping out of the main crowd. The noise faded behind me as I wandered along the edge of the venue, away from the chatter and laughter.

After walking around for a while, I spotted a familiar voice calling out.

**‚ÄúOi! Mikasa, over here!‚Äù**

It was Armin. He was waving at me from a distance. A small smile tugged at my lips as I walked toward them. The rest of the gang was there too ‚Äî Connie, Sasha, Annie, Reiner, all sitting together at one table.

**‚ÄúHey, Mikasa! How are you?‚Äù** Sasha asked, grinning as always.

**‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine,‚Äù** I said softly, though the tiredness in my voice betrayed me.

Annie smiled faintly. **‚ÄúHonestly, I thought you wouldn‚Äôt come. But I‚Äôm glad you did.‚Äù**

I smiled back. **‚ÄúYeah. Me too.‚Äù**

Reiner leaned back in his chair. **‚ÄúSo finally, all of us in one place again, huh?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù** Connie said, laughing. **‚ÄúLast time was at Armin and Annie‚Äôs wedding.‚Äù**

**‚ÄúEven though we talk almost every day in the group chat, seeing everyone in person hits different,‚Äù** Reiner added.

Everyone nodded in agreement. It felt warm ‚Äî familiar ‚Äî like nothing had changed.

Then Jean came over, greeting everyone with that same confident smile he always had. I looked at him and smiled.

**‚ÄúCongratulations, Jean,‚Äù** I said sincerely, though my voice carried a small tremor ‚Äî a mix of sadness and something I couldn‚Äôt quite name.

**‚ÄúThanks, Mikasa,‚Äù** he said warmly. **‚ÄúIt means a lot coming from you.‚Äù**

I nodded, forcing another smile.

Connie glanced between us. His expression shifted ‚Äî he must‚Äôve noticed the heaviness in my eyes. Then, muttering under his breath, he said, **‚ÄúMan, I swear, if that stupid Eren ever shows up again, I‚Äôd‚Äî‚Äù**

**‚ÄúConnie.‚Äù** Annie cut him off sharply, giving him a look.

**‚ÄúOh‚Äîuh, sorry. Sorry, Mikasa. I didn‚Äôt mean to bring him up,‚Äù** Connie stammered.

**‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù** I said quietly. My tone was calm, but my heart ached again at the sound of his name. **‚ÄúIt would be nice if no one mentioned him tonight.‚Äù**

**‚ÄúRight,‚Äù** Armin jumped in quickly, trying to ease the tension. **‚ÄúCome on, everyone. Let‚Äôs have fun while we‚Äôre here.‚Äù**

The rest of the evening went by with laughter, music, and small talk. For a while, I managed to smile ‚Äî maybe even laugh once or twice. But it never felt the same.

When the ceremony ended, and everyone began leaving, I quietly slipped away into the night. The air was cooler now. I walked alone through the quiet streets, my heels clicking against the pavement again.

I looked up at the golden sky slowly turning gray. For a moment, I felt something heavy in my chest ‚Äî the same feeling I‚Äôd been carrying for years.

**‚ÄúGuess this is how life moves on,‚Äù** I murmured.

But as much as I tried to believe that‚Ä¶
my heart whispered something else.

*Not everyone does.*


**(Time Skip ‚Äì Evening 06:45 PM)**

**(Mikasa‚Äôs POV)**

After coming home from Jean‚Äôs engagement ceremony, I changed my clothes and finished all the leftover chores around the apartment. The ticking of the clock echoed softly across the quiet room. Everything felt still ‚Äî maybe too still.

I let out a long sigh and walked toward the window. The city outside was wrapped in calmness. The evening sky glimmered faintly with scattered stars, the wind brushing against the curtains. I sat down beside the window, resting my elbows on the sill, and gazed outside.

It was beautiful ‚Äî the kind of beauty that felt almost painful.
Peaceful, quiet‚Ä¶ and distant.

It reminded me of another time. The nights when I used to sit like this, only back then, I wasn‚Äôt alone.

My eyes fell on the scarf resting neatly on the table beside me. Without thinking, I reached for it. The familiar softness brushed against my fingers. It still felt warm ‚Äî gentle, like a memory that refused to fade.

I held it close, staring at it in silence. And as always, the moment I touched it, memories began to flood in.
Moments I‚Äôd tried so hard to bury.

It reminded me of him.
Eren.

Again.

I took a deep breath, but my chest ached. The same old questions echoed quietly inside my head ‚Äî questions that never really left.

**‚ÄúDoes he ever think of me?‚Äù**
**‚ÄúWas the breakup the right choice?‚Äù**
**‚ÄúWould things be different if he stayed?‚Äù**

No tears came this time. Just that dull, familiar ache ‚Äî the kind that feels less like heartbreak and more like a shadow that never leaves. A matured kind of pain. Quiet, but constant.

And yet, I asked myself ‚Äî why now?
Why was I still thinking about him?

Every time I was alone, my thoughts somehow found their way back to him. No matter how much I distracted myself ‚Äî work, errands, daily routines ‚Äî silence always brought him back.

Maybe because I never really accepted it.
Maybe because a part of me still hadn‚Äôt let go.

I haven‚Äôt spoken to him since that day ‚Äî the day everything ended. I don‚Äôt even know where he is now. France, maybe. Or somewhere else entirely.
But does it matter anymore?

I told myself I don‚Äôt care. And maybe that‚Äôs true ‚Äî at least, on the surface. My life looks normal now.
Graduated. Working. Paying bills. Laughing sometimes.

But emotionally‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not fully healed.

I still avoid certain streets, certain caf√©s, even certain songs. The ones that remind me of him. Because every time I do, that ache comes back ‚Äî soft but heavy.

My thoughts swirled for a while before a small whisper left my lips.
**‚ÄúEnough, Mikasa‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs time.‚Äù**

I looked down at the scarf in my hands. My chest tightened.

*It‚Äôs time to heal properly.*

That scarf ‚Äî the only thing left that connected me to him ‚Äî it had been my comfort and my chain at the same time. Every time I held it, I remembered the warmth‚Ä¶ but also the loss.

I stood up, walked to the table, and picked up my phone. I opened my contacts list and scrolled slowly until his name appeared. I hadn‚Äôt touched it in two years ‚Äî it was always there, buried between others, like a scar that wouldn‚Äôt fade.

My thumb hovered over it. I hesitated for a long time.

And then, quietly, I pressed *delete*.

Just like that, his name disappeared from the screen.
The last thread connecting us ‚Äî gone.

I stared at the empty contact list for a few seconds, feeling both relief and sorrow. A strange emptiness filled me.

Now, only the scarf remained.

I turned to look outside again. The air looked cool, inviting. ‚ÄúMaybe I should go out for a while,‚Äù I murmured to myself. ‚ÄúGet something to eat.‚Äù

As I reached for the door, my eyes landed on the scarf again. I smiled faintly, the corners of my lips trembling.

‚ÄúMaybe‚Ä¶ just one last time,‚Äù I whispered.

I wrapped the scarf gently around my neck ‚Äî for the last time.


**(A few moments later)**

The streets were quiet, painted in orange streetlights. The wind brushed against my hair as I walked along the familiar roads. I pulled the scarf closer around my neck, letting its warmth sink in.

I never expected my life to turn out this way. But here I was ‚Äî living it, day by day. Not broken anymore, but not whole either. Just‚Ä¶ existing.

As I walked, a small restaurant caught my eye ‚Äî the one where Eren and I used to spend evenings together. The signboard still looked the same, the lights just as soft. I stopped in front of it, staring.

A small, bittersweet smile appeared on my lips.

**‚ÄúStill the same,‚Äù** I whispered.

I was about to turn and walk away ‚Äî but something inside me told me to stop. Maybe closure doesn‚Äôt come from forgetting, but from facing what hurts.

I took a slow breath and stepped forward. The bell above the door rang softly as I entered.

The warm air and familiar smell of coffee and bread hit me instantly. The chatter, the dim lights, the background music ‚Äî everything felt the same, yet entirely different.

I chose a small table beside the window, the same one we used to sit at. The seat across from me was empty now, and the emptiness felt louder than the noise around.

I ordered something simple ‚Äî a coffee and a sandwich ‚Äî and leaned my head against the glass. Outside, people were walking, laughing, living.

And me? I was here, trying to feel okay.

I touched the edge of my scarf again. It was still soft. Still warm.

A memory flashed in my mind ‚Äî a few days ago, a man at work had asked me casually, **‚ÄúDo you have a boyfriend?‚Äù**
I remembered the small pause I took before replying, **‚ÄúNo. And I‚Äôm not looking for one.‚Äù**

He laughed awkwardly, and I just smiled.

Now, thinking back, I smiled again ‚Äî softly, to myself.
Even if I ever choose someone else‚Ä¶ they won‚Äôt be like him.
No one ever could be.

I took a sip of my coffee, staring out the window as the sky deepened into night. The city lights reflected faintly on the glass.

Maybe our story really did end two years ago. Maybe that‚Äôs where it was always meant to end.

I adjusted my scarf gently.
This would be the last time I wore it.

I've lived in SWFL my whole life. Halfway between wild and urban. Opulent and shabby. Mansions and crack dens. Beachfront and deep swamp. This small slice of paradise on a peninsula of wilderness, whether it be the infinite deep of the ocean, or the scarcely explored expanse of national parks and forests. You don't realize how rich some people are until you drive through some of these subdivisions in Naples. All that money, and unless you're a talented bartender, it doesn't quite trickle down, especially out of season. In Florida, our only two seasons are hurricane and tourist. So, this past month, when the market decided to take a shit, I decided it was time to find a second job. 

""Isaiah Combs 8-10 Live"" An A-frame blackboard sign read outside the only barren bar on the bustled street. I lugged in my PA, eyes darting from the marble bar top, bleach-white walls, and in stark contrast to the more fashionable nature of the rest of the bar; metal signs, with messages printed reading ""If you ain't fallen over yet you need another beer!"" and ""If beer isn't the answer you're asking the wrong question!"" that would be more at home in your boomer uncle's man cave that he fully furnished with Temu and Hobby Lobby. 4 or 5 years ago someone cared about this place. Had an elegant vision of a locale with all the class of a 5-star hotel lobby bar. That was until a new owner or manager, what have you, said to themself ""This is not what bar look like! Bar have pool table and dart board!""

My eyes met the bartender's and I saw the look in his eye before I saw him. He didn't want to be here as much as I did. He couldn't be much older than me, late-20s black button-down with a black tie. I wasn't sure if my polo was out of place yet.

""Can I help you with something, man?"" He had an accent to his voice I couldn't place outside of being European. 

""Yeah, I'm Isaiah, I'm playing here tonight. Liza didn't tell me where she wanted me to set up over the phone."" 

The bartender gestured to the vacant floor space in front of the touchtune, next to an ornate vintage wine cabinet. I bent my knees and carried my speakers to their destination. I could see a line on the floor where the linoleum was faded. Separated only by the black gunk from where a runner rug used to be duct taped down and no one thought it would be a good idea to spray some goo-gone before the tracks of months to years worth of patrons made it a permanent fixture of this hodgepodge. 

I finished setting up in record time as there were no drunks giving me the ""I'm gonna shout Free Bird as loud as I fucking can in about 10 to 15 minutes"" stare. No drunks or anyone for that matter. Just me and Bartender, he told me his name but for the life of me, I couldn't piece together the noise he made in a way that made sense phonetically. 

I jammed there by myself for an hour, an old man shuffled in looking for the bathroom. My tip jar remained as dry as the dead mangrove forest across the street; its water source cut off by the road. The calloused skin on my fingers flaked off with each successful chord change. The clock drudged forward getting closer to 10 pm. By this time a regular was seated at the far end of the bar away from me. I rigged up my harp rack with a G Harmonica to play Seminole Wind. 


When I was a little kid my dad used to take me on expeditions out in the Everglades. He had this story he told me about the skunk ape, basically South Florida's version of Bigfoot. I ate that shit up. We would pack a sack with bologna and cheese sandwiches, Deep Woods Off with 40% DEET, flashlights, binoculars, fishing gear, and the whole nine yards to go spend the day cavorting out in the swamp searching for signs of the elusive creature. The 2001 Saturn Vue hit Alligator Alley like Magellan on the high sea. Uncharted paved territory as waves of yellow, orange, and pink strobed between the trees in the early hours of daylight. The summer heat cascaded over our skin as we sat, getting eaten alive by mosquitoes, under a cypress tree and enjoying our lunch that day. We never had any luck, I'm still hopeful there's stuff like that out there though. I've always had a fascination with the strange but I'm rational. I know there's likely no Bigfoot, skinwalkers, or most cryptids. Then again, if there are any out there it's just a part of nature we haven't found yet. Nothing really supernatural about it. 

That doesn't stop me from being cautious when going out on trails though.
My phone rang. It was Harry. He was the one who got me this shit gig, but hey, at least I would walk home with two hundred and fifty bucks. Harry had recently been promoted to good friend after spending quite some time in the acquaintance-zone. Everyone has quirks and flaws but sometimes, Harry was a bit to stomach.

""Yooo big dog!"" Harry called out from my phone, ""How's the Hideout? Makin' stacks?""

""Not particularly, there's one dude here and he hasn't taken an eye off his beer since he sat down like 10 minutes ago."" I leaned against the wall separating the out-of-order men's room and ladies' room as my iPad ran the show.

""Mannn, that sucksss dude. If I'm gonna be honest I do not like Liza. Bitch vibes.""

""Yeah, I don't know dude,"" I remembered the old guy from earlier and wondered if he used the women's restroom.

""Oh bro bro, before I forget. You're still looking for something steady right?""

Harry was about to save my ass again. ""Dude, I'm always looking, what do ya got?""

""Okay, so my uncle's friend or something right, he was chilling and told me he needed some extra help at some wildlife sanctuary or nature trail type shit.""

""What type of work?""

""Bro bro bro, it's nothing. It's a big animal research center in the middle of fucking nowhere and they just need a guy.""

""A guy to do what?""

""Men shit. Watch the place, pick up heavy things when they got em. Like security and stuff mostly.""

""This place is just in the middle of woods somewhere?""

""Yeah bro, security on that place is easy money dog. Deep out in Fakahatchee or Picayune I think. There's no one for miles, you just gonna be on the radio like 'uuhh there's a bear, and nothing else' and that's a band!""

The man on the other end of the bar began a coughing fit. The bartender didn't so much as look up from his phone. I squinted through the dimly lit bipolarly decorated room to see he was wearing AirPods.

""Harry, text me your uncle's cousin's roommate's number please.""

""Type shit. Let me know if Liza gives you shit tonight, she stiffed me last week.""


Chapter 2: Naithlorendum

Monday afternoon I drove out to the Gore Research Center. This place was in the boonies. There's a funny thing about Florida. It's similar to how the rest of the country is, just shrunk down and set the dial from low to high. Most of the people are on the coast and that's where all the money is. But you drive like 25 minutes and might as well be in Louisiana. I live about 10 minutes from one of the Bidens and another 20 minutes from there my dad found an upturned skiff housing a bale of marijuana. I didn't know they came in bales. Word of the wise, never try to stab one of those thinking you might just take a little bit. Those things are super compact. They had prison crews cleaning up for a couple of days.

I had been driving to meet the woman in charge of the facility for about 30 minutes now. Sedan was not the vehicle for the job. It had rained about four days ago, which was uncommon that time of year. The relative dryness was in my favor. I turned right off Golden Gate Parkway to head deep into the Picayune Strand State Forest. On Desoto, traffic slowly waned as the roads fell into disrepair. Homes that scattered the county road became less and less common. Less and less kept. American flags turn to Trump flags. Trump flags turn to rebel flags. Rebel flags turn to trees. 

After a few miles passed, I came upon a road sign. 

‚ÄúEnd County Maintenance.‚Äù  

‚ÄúThud.‚Äù The car lurched from the asphalt to the cruel limestone sand and dirt, throwing a cloud behind me as I vibrated down the landscape.

A majority of the journey had become unpaved. I had never been out that way. There's an almost unending maze of lefts and rights out there. RV's parked out in the middle of clearings, doing God knows what, strange wooden encampment suspended between the trees. I passed a dead deer around 130th Ave. 

I pulled up to the gate about two hours before sunset. My battle-weary Hyundai splattered with mud, dirt, and grime idled waiting for the gate to open.
I checked my messages with the contact I was given. Not delivered. I had one bar of LTE this far out which honestly surprised me. I sent a new message informing her I was outside. In wait, I took stock of my surroundings. 3 Signs on a post reading:

‚ÄúNo Trespassers KEEP OUT‚Äù

""Naithloriendum Wildlife Sanctuary""

And the third, ""Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time? Ecclesiastes 7:17""


It was only a few moments before the front gate roared into life. 
The house was something out of Swiss Family Robinson. Towering on all sides were live oaks, cypress, and ficus trees. The unkempt driveway led to a winding staircase encroached on by a strangler fig. Jasmine vines climbed the banister on the front porch up to the second floor, its wilted white flowers speckled on the duff. Spanish moss covered the trees and shrouded the home drawing the eye to an observation deck on what looked to be the third floor. It was as if nature was reclaiming what was once hers.

She must've been in her early 60's. The gray roots just creeping up from her tightly packed jet-black hair. ""Isaiah, so good to see you!"" She called out from the front door. Her voice was much louder than you'd expect for the distance between us. I had to match the energy, ""Deb! Nice to finally meet in person!""

Feeling a need to take control of this altogether new setting I found myself in, I quickly closed the distance between her and I. Scaling the derelict staircase with a hand outstretched. My faux enthusiasm as I shook Deb‚Äôs calloused hands made me internally cringe. Her eyes gave no mysteries, and told no answers. That, in it of itself, was enough of a mystery to solve.

""Come in son, I'll let you get your bearings."" Deb showed me inside an immaculately clean house. House is the wrong word. It was unlived in. No utilitarian furnishings like TVs or kitchen appliances outside of a coffee maker seated on the welcome desk. Above the desk, there was a portrait of a smiling white-haired, bearded old man, with a golden retriever, seated on the front step of the old staircase. Before the strangler fig made its debut.

Deb tossed her jean jacket onto a coat rack by the front door and turned towards me clasping her hands together and teetering from heel to toe. ""Well! Welcome to the education center. This is, of course, Dr.Bob's former home. We do tours, and craft days, and uh the occasional field trip. Well. Un-occasional. It's a bit- just a bit far and obscure and too much of a negative connotation for the schools you know. Anyway! That doesn't stop any of the great work we do!"" Deb's eyes lit up at this. 

""So this is a uh conservation collier restoration site. Basically we are working to uh return this area to its natural habitat. This is a cypress hardwood, damn no it's a uh, hardwood, cypress, swamp, forest. Hardwood cypress swamp forest. While being both in the Picayune Strand we are also smack dab in the middle of uh Big cypress's Critical Area of State Concern."" Deb made her way to the rear of the house, passing photographs and newspapers strewn along the wall captioned like it would be at a museum.

""We work to create awareness and of course have boots on the ground here"" She spun to look at me. ""During the day."" She spun back. ""We document tree growth, panther population, water quality, you name it. The further people are from these uh vital environments the more they tend to do well. Flourish.""

We crossed a corridor, sealed by a red velvet rope and two greening, once golden stanchions. I peeked inside seeing one of those wheeled step ladders you see in old libraries. I adjusted my gaze back toward her, ""Keep Florida wild!"" I chimed in.

""Exactly! Yes, that's so good. I like that.""

I felt bad that I was just repeating some Instagram caption I had seen. We both stood there for a moment. I just smiled and nodded through the silence.

""OH,"" she exclaimed, clapping her hands together once more. ""W-9 and stuff I'll drop by when I um come to meet you in the morning. Let me show you a little bit around here now."" She made an about-face towards the front door.

""This was Robert's entertaining area. It was used only by him though. Little to no visitors, those who knew him described him as a bit of a curmudgeon. Eccentric too."" She led me to the front reception, and again I saw posted above the door the word ""Naithlorendum""

I grabbed my phone from my pocket to google it. Just as we're rounding the desk to  climb up a second-story staircase Deb interrupts.""Most of what you will need you can find in or under here. Including a charger."" She grabbed the lightning cable and handed it to me. ""Thanks""

""Ab-so-lutly! Now follow me up here and I'll show you some of the exhibits."" As Deb grabbed the guard rail to the staircase she knocked on it three times. We ascended and the age of this building began to show, the air got more still and I could smell the faint nostalgic aroma of mildew. The musty air swirled in vapors as Deb reached for a brittle yellowed light switch at the top of the stairs. ""Click"" 		

Nothing.

""This damn-"" She flicked it on and off three times and the overhead fluorescents buzzed, spattered, and awoke with all the vigor of a model T. A taxidermied bear, a few wild boar, a buck and a doe, a bald eagle, gopher tortoises, and a few otters in a menagerie of nature frozen in death. The wall to the left had a nearly 6-foot-long tarpon. 

Deb pointed to the bald eagle ""Don't worry, that's incredibly old."" She must've misinterpreted the bewildered look on my face for concern. Deb went on to explain some of the origins of the animals, or fun facts, or something while I took steps to mentally document my surroundings. Further on into the upstairs, there was a door. Plain wooden door with a black painted profile of a wild hog. I made my approach.

""That's the Pig Room."" Deb plainly stated in monotone.

Instinctively I almost blurted out ""The fuck?"" But I caught myself when I turned and faced this short kind-eyed woman who just so happened to be my new boss.

""Pardon""

""The Pig Room""

""Is that-""

""Exactly what you think it is? Yes""

Well, fucking thank you, Deb. I have not a clue in the world what the hell that means. She misread my expression again. She charged forward and opened the door. 

Frankly, there isn't anything I would have called it outside of the Pig Room. Speckled shadows crept through the doorway. A curtained window obscured by the mess of jasmine outside was the only light source. Deb trodded to the center of the room and pulled a cord. Illuminated now was a man's life's work. Glass cases and dioramas. Jars and diagrams. Sketches, notes, photographs, and all dedicated to the pigs. 

There was an old padauk wood bookcase brimmed with a dozen or more jars of fetal pigs suspended in formaldehyde. On another shelf, there were books like ""The Merck Veterinary Manual Eleventh Edition"" bound in navy canvas with silver foil lettering. Another read ‚ÄúThe Embryology of  The Pig Second Edition,‚Äù with a maroon cover and gold foil emboss. The other shelves were dotted with body parts, trinkets and journals; including a crate filled with 30 to 40 boar tusks. Tacked to the wall was a photocopy of a textbook that read ""Chapter 7 The Structure of Embryos from Nine to Twelve Millimeters in Length,"" on the second page was a diagram of a curled and squashed mass. Little slits for eyes, its shape that of a manatee more than a pig. The center of the room was a stainless steel table. It slanted off slightly towards the opposite wall into a drain. A small trough lined the table, inside were medical instruments like scalpels, a bone saw, and other things I didn't recognize. On the other end of the room was a meticulously constructed display, a paper-thin slice of a pig under glass. A narrow slice from snout to tail. There were 6 in all,  the same size but different areas of the body. White cartilage encased in meat around the thing's snout, and a cavity with a perfectly round white mass. Organs and bones were perfectly preserved in place and time like some 4th-dimensional creature had trapped the hog there then and now.

I ran my hand along the trough of the operation table, its cool surface had seen years of scratches and wearing. 

I turned my head and caught a glimpse of the cages. Eight separate cages empty of tenants, but exuded an energy of melancholy. Old dusty stained hay and straw lie on the ground of each cell which were only about 2 and a half feet in width and 5 feet deep. The room had no distinct scent.

""Bob took his research very seriously,"" Yeah no shit Deb, I don't think they sell pig slices on Amazon. ""The advancements made in veterinary medicine by Bob are astounding really.""

I took stock of the shelves, textbooks, and general macabre set. ""Well, I can say this is not exactly what I was expecting.""

Deb huffed and shrugged. Knocking on the door three times as she exited and turned towards the next floor up. 

Once completing our tour I followed my boss out to the driveway. 

""I'll be back in the morning around 8 to get the report of the night. There's usually as you'd likely expect, not too much activity. If you get bored I have filing in Bob's downstairs study that has to be done. There's a crudit√©s platter in the uh break room fridge I think.""

""Thank you, Deb, I really appreciate this opportunity.""

""Ab-so-lutly Isaiah. Don't let the isolation get to you now.""

With that she twirled her keys, clicking the unlock thrice. She clambered up into her dark green Jeep Wrangler and kicked a dust cloud behind her as she left. I strolled out after her seeing her car grow smaller until turning off Desoto back towards civilization. The machines roar waning and waning until‚Ä¶ silence.


Chapter 3: Plink

I took a right turn down 40th Avenue and spotted a sign not too far off. 
""Dr.Robert H. Gore III Preserve""

""Hell yeah,"" I instinctively muttered. My sneakers made the satisfying gravel on-sole crunch as I lightly jogged to the trailhead. Twilight had just begun to set in when I rounded the 2-mile loop sign. The forest greeted me with an ospreys coo overhead, no other sounds but the gentle breeze swaying between leaves, needles, and palmetto branches. The occasional snap and crack; sounds of the wilderness my brain was once so accustomed to. I started a hike on my Apple Watch. My legs needed a stretch after that tumultuous ride. My mind needed a stretch after the interview with Deb, if you could call it that. What did she mean by ""don't let the isolation get to you?"" 

I realized after an indeterminate amount of time walking I hadn't been paying close attention to my surroundings. A mossy oak entwined with a sable palm to my right. To my left numerous old Florida pines engrossed by vegetation. Some were full of life, others rotting and brimming with woodpecker burrows. To my front, a narrowing path of toppled palms. To my back, rapidly dwindling daylight.

I had to pick up my pace. 

The more obscured view had made the more treacherous terrain more treacherous. The once smoothly mowed path was now dotted with rocks, branches, and root systems climbing into the overworld. The taller grass made little foot-sized holes vague and unclear. As I made my attempt to bound as quickly and safely as I could through the forest, every squeak, every bird call, every flutter of wings got louder. A branch caught my arm, breaking skin and spilling first blood.  As the evening's light drew closer to the Earth it made the bird's shadows above appear like Thunderbirds in a cat 5. Branches made to be the arms and claws of Mother Nature herself, snatching me back to dust. I reached into my pocket for my phone. I had left it on the front desk. 

I didn't have a flashlight.

I stopped dead in my tracks. The pit that had formed in the back of my throat from breathing in the cold Florida air dropped down into my chest. Decision-making hindered, fear‚Äôs vice grip on my throttle, I picked up the pace. 

I've hiked at night before, technically speaking, but that trail was 714 feet long. You can map it with your eyes closed. In all new territory, while technically on the clock, I've gotten myself much deeper than I had hoped. I'm not lost. The trail is just a loop; there's only one way in and the same way out. Or so I thought. I rounded the corner and there was a dead end. Surrounded by nothing but a thicket of vegetation and densely packed palmettos. I still wasn't lost. I could just turn around and go the same way I came. The orange-colored sky had fully desaturated and turned to an inky black. I bounded down the trail through the night with wanton disregard for the stones and roots that lay in my path. I had to get out of here as soon as possible. Palmetto branches brushed my shoulders. The deep sounds of my footfalls were only drowned out by my huffing and puffing. 

My left foot wedged itself underneath a root. As soon as I realized what was happening, I had already hit the ground. The little panicked breaths that had filled my lungs all rushed out in a single moment as my chest became well acquainted with the forest floor. My left hand scuffed against dirt and leaves, and my right palm grazed the surface of a moss-covered stone. If there was any air left in my lungs, I would have laughed at myself. That is until I realized the sound of  footsteps continued after I fell.

Call it delirium, call it adrenaline, but I could've sworn that as I was falling I could hear footsteps continuing in my pace. My cheek lying on the ground and eyesight serving me no good, I became intensely aware of the sounds and smells in my immediate vicinity. 

I heard nothing. No birds. No rodents. No twigs snapping. No rustling critters in the brush. Just the gentle breeze, whistling through the Palmetto branches and leaves. If only for a second the area reeked of ammonia and urine. A subtle presence of rotting fruit and eggs filled the air. Through the aches, and the pains I all of a sudden had the feeling like I was being watched. Like all at once, a colony of eyes transfixed on my crumpled heap. 

Fear froze me there in time. ""If it's black: fight back, if it's brown: lie down."" There aren't any brown bears in Florida as far as I know, so this is gonna have to be a fighting-back scenario. Unless the rules change if you're already lying down. There's only one way out of here and it's forward and if there is something in here it's behind me so I've got that going.

""Plink"" 

""What the hell was that,"" I thought to myself. 

""Plink""

It was closer this time. It sounded like something had fallen about three or four feet from my head.

""Plink""

""Shit,"" I instinctively muttered, breaking the unspoken rule of silence the forest had set upon me. I could see it now, a rock. A tiny little rock must have just landed right in front of my face.

""Plink""

I think something just lobbed a rock past my head.

The pain in my body all at once became the lowest priority I had. I pushed against the limestone and dirt, jolting my body upright. I spun to look for what lay in wait just behind my back.

Nothing.

No way in hell I was about to wait for whatever it was to show itself. Heart and mind racing at breakneck speed, my feet matched their tempo. I expertly dashed through the remaining trail. Rocks, holes, and branches were becoming more and more sparse. The back lip of my shoes ripped and tore at my Achilles tendon. My heart pounded and pounded until it felt like it was about to wriggle its way through my ribs and fall out. My lungs heaved air rapidly, the speed exasperated by the tremendous effort engaged by both my legs and amygdala.

 I could hear more footsteps than mine. I was being pursued. Instinct took over. Adrenaline guided my path and my conscious mind fell into complete blindness. I was no longer human. I was prey. Run. It‚Äôs right there. Run. I emerged at the trailhead moments later and it all flooded back. I peeked over my shoulder as I hit the road and ran back towards Naithlorendum. My pursuers had remained on the trail.

I scaled the strangled staircase and slammed the door behind me. The silence of the space was absolutely deafening. I leaned against the door and followed it down to the floor. I lay there for a short time. 

My mind flickered and adjusted back to reality. Fear had gripped each muscle fiber and tendon in my body. Reason began to administer its soothing medicine of denial.

The air was still, and frigid. I started to recognize some things not made all too clear by Deb. There's no air conditioning in this house. How does a house in the middle of Florida not have central heating and air? I went to the downstairs restroom to survey the damage. 

My palms were red and sore but altogether fine. I was covered in dirt and leaves, and there were a few deep scratches on my left cheek. The blood from my arm was slowly coagulating. I looked like hell but otherwise all right. I started running the sink so I could clean the cuts. I shook the dirt off my clothes into the bathtub. I winced when I took off my left sneaker. I've never broken a toe before, but I know they're not supposed to be purple. 
I met my gaze in the mirror. "" What the hell was that?"" I folded up a sheet of toilet paper and dabbed cold water around the cuts that would distract from the dark circles under my eyes. I was tired, maybe even overtired.

""Was there anything there at all?"" A voice rose from the back of my head.

""No, no! I know what I saw.""

""What did you see?""

I couldn't answer that part of myself. I didn't actually see anything. But I knew what I heard.

""But what did you hear?""

Footsteps, the rock. I could‚Äî

""Rationally explain everything?""

The forest was dark, my adrenaline was pumping, and my mind could've been playing tricks on me. A coyote or less agreeably a panther could be a logical explanation. Any explanation though required too much mental gymnastics to make sense. My brain was already stiff and rigid and exercise was the last thing it needed. 

I would have gone out to my car to get my guitar to get my mind on something , but there's a better chance of finding the winning lottery ticket in a haystack while also being struck by lightning in a frozen-over Hell than me going back out there any time soon. I plopped onto the couch in front of the massive limestone fireplace. I needed to rest my eyes for a moment. Every blink fell heavier and heavier. The day's troubles exchanged the weight held by my heart to the eyelids.

I was out for 5 minutes. 

For the next hour, I explored the interior of my new job site. If the Pig Room was anything to go off of, there had to be more than what meets the eye. Dr.Gore was an established author and I found a few of his books in his study. Nothing on pigs. Aside from the swine's carnival of terrors placed directly over my head nothing seemed out of the ordinary. This tiny museum, a display of a man's life and passion, deep out in the sticks about twenty miles east of nowhere. What was the point of it all? Why keep it standing and open for visitors? These questions swirled in my psyche until one thought elbowed its way through the crowd and made itself a front-row seat in my mind.

""Why am I here?""

Tonight's wages would be the tipping point for me to afford health insurance this month, tomorrow's would pay for a week of meal kits. 

Not why I, personally, am here. Why would they have anyone here? What am I protecting and what am I protecting from? 

I'm just here to ""keep an eye on things"" right? This revelation bothered me as I mounted up to the very crest of the stairs and entered the cupola. As I paced circles around the observation deck another question had dispersed the crowd and made itself the only voice crying out in the wasteland of thought.

""Don't let the isolation get to you.""

Deb's final words to me were a harbinger of sorts. I limped up the stairs, purple-toed with an abrasion-littered face because I let it get to me. I was going mad. Paranoid. If I didn't have an immediate personality switch I wouldn't make it through the night.

""Plink.""

My blood ran cold. My temples pounded like a pair of timpani in a ritardando as my peripheral vision tightened down to a single point. Frozen in space and time, I waited for more noise. Five agonizingly slow minutes pass. I was surrounded on all sides by glass and on the other side of the glass nothing but the Spanish moss and darkness. A steady overcast of cumulonimbus had drowned the stars and dim crescent moonlight. Wind howled through the trees in a mighty crescendo until: ""plink.""

There is no way I imagined it because I saw it this time. I saw a pebble hit the window. I staggered back and became instantly aware of the fishbowl I had myself in. I decided the windowless room of the downstairs study would be safe, so I carefully climbed down the stairs. The soulless visage of the taxidermy bear shot me daggers as I made it to the second floor. I avoided the animals not wanting to get close. 

It had gotten even colder downstairs, a draft that sent goosebumps across my body. Rounding the welcome desk I snatched my phone from the charger. It hadn't charged, in fact, it was down to 20%. 

The wind was getting louder as I put my hand on the golden stanchion. A yellow-aged newspaper clipping on the desk caught my eye.

Homeowner Shoots at Alleged Trespasser's Vehicle, One Teen Dead.""

I heard a rattling noise from the back of the house. It sounded like a branch on hurricane shutters. I ignored the study and crept towards the back of Naithlorendum. The window was open.

As the wind swept through the house I knew I wasn't alone. I was waiting for that little part of me, that thought my pursuer in the forest was a hallucination, to apologize. 

I heard a clattering noise upstairs. Like something had just tripped on one of the taxidermy projects. 

Eggs, fruit, ammonia, and urine. The scent had filled the air like a noxious perfume. It had found me.




Chapter 4: Keep Florida Wild

""I don't care how much I'm getting paid, I'm not staying here another minute,"" I muttered as I pulled out of the driveway. I turned onto Desoto to make the hour-long trek back to civilization and out of this God-forsaken wood. I pulled out my phone and sent a message to Deb. 

""shit went down tonight. I don't know WTF is going on up here but I want no part of it. front gate closed and door if locked, key under the mat. If you knew what I was getting into im very disappointed"" 

Not delivered. I had no service at all now. While it was on my mind, I attempted to send a message to Harry: 

""hey bro, who the hell told you about this gig at the nature center? there is some crazy shit up here""

The Hyundai's brights illuminated the street, a bright white tunnel through the towering pines. Mud, dust, and dirt kicked up and splattered against my car's already abused frame. Even with no one on the road I maintained 35 miles an hour. The scarlet beacon of my tail light illuminated a solitary figure dart across the street behind me. It was a child. 

At two in the morning, on a back-county road, deep in an old Florida state forest, a four-foot-tall child just ran behind my car, narrowly avoiding death.

Normally I would stop, but the woods couldn't pull one over me like that. It had gotten me out here but nothing was going to stop me. Something could slow me down. You see, most Januarys in Florida get one total day of rainfall. Well, apparently tonight was day two.

The sky's levee had overflowed and a free fall of rain engulfed my vehicle. My vehicle, the trees, and more importantly the dirt road. The rough and rocky terrain ahead began to mold and shift. My tires cut grooves into the earth as water began to break up the loam.

With full focus and attention on my surroundings, the corner of my vision caught something in the rearview.

The child was chasing my car.

At an inhuman speed, the silhouette steadily sprinted through the slurry kicking up behind my back tires. My fingers fumbled to switch my car into sport mode. I slammed my foot to the gas pedal and lurched forward. Anything not tied down had slipped and fell towards the back seat as I pumped the accelerator and gripped the steering wheel. The bumps in the road amplified, I had consecutive but sporadic airtime. The wipers spit rain and mud to either side. I glanced in the rearview. 

The child was galloping on all fours. Unbothered by the speed, by the mud, by the rain. The thing persisted. Its appendages moving with such fervor, its head pointed to the ground, it followed. It was gaining on me. 

I passed the skeletal remains of a deer on 130th ave.

I gripped the steering wheel as tightly as I could when I felt it start to get away from me. I was too late. I hydroplaned and spun out of control. I careened off the muddied road and narrowly missed a pine as I sailed off into a field. As I involuntarily did donuts in the clearing my brakes had finally pushed my car to a complete stop.

The pitter-patter drone of rainfall atop the car was the only thing I heard as my wrist vibrated informing me I had just been in an accident. I couldn't find my phone anywhere in the car. Fire ran down my neck, following my spine and distributing itself through my body and out my digits. In my rattled state I struggled to get my bearings, to focus on anything other than the contents of my stomach. I cut the engine, ""I'm gonna stay here a short while."" 

I sat there and worked the tension out of my hands. Breathe in, breathe out. I leaned back my head, placing my crown squarely on the headrest. Warm iron-tasting liquid had begun to seep from my tongue forming a small pool situated along my bottom row of teeth. 

""Plink""

""Plink, plink.""

""Plink, plink, plink.""

I jammed my thumb into the steering wheel as I sloppily and frantically reached for the ignition.

""Click-click-click.""

I pumped the stiff brake pedal and forced the key clockwise.

""Click-click-click""

Again.

""Click-click-click""

""Plink""

That one landed in the direct center of my windshield. As I shot my eyes up it darted out of my periphery. The rain had slowed to a drizzle, and now I could hear footsteps scampering about the car.

""Wham!"" It charged my passenger door. A deafening cacophony of thuds as it scaled my sunroof. The child leaped to the hood and stared directly at me.

""What the fuck is that-"" The words jumbled and twisted out of my mouth.

The child's grizzled brown fur was made slick by the rain and light of the moon. Its beady black eyes darted from me to the contents of my car and back to me. His little chest rising and falling as its cleft 4 fingered hands explored my windshield. It pressed its snout against the glass, grey and green plasma bubbling from its two gaping nostrils. 

I laid on my horn. Furiously beating the steering wheel and beeping in rapid protest.

It squealed. Frightened and angered by the noise it hopped and dug its tusk into my windshield before flailing and launching itself back into the dark. Scampering on all fours into the inky blackness of night. My windshield fractured, and I attempted to start the car again. My headlights flickered revealing the feral thing just ahead. The engine sputtered, struggling to start.

Guttural grunts and high-pitched whines filled the treeline. Every direction was engrossed by the war cry of wild hogs. 

Their squeals pierced my eardrums as a veritable tribe of bipedal swine emerged from the thicket. Of all sizes, some hairy, some nude, brown and black fur, tusks of varying lengths. Soulless eyes peered at my solitary island of machinery. They stumbled ahead, snorting and squealing as they closed the distance.

The hog people made their approach and I flooded my engine. 

""C'mon c'mon. Work damn it!"" I violently shook the steering wheel and beat a fist on my dashboard. ""Please! For the love of God!"" I shouted as one of the pigs snarled and charged the driver's side door.

The car lazily chugged to life and my dash illuminated. I pumped the accelerator and failed to budge as the first two hogs made contact with my car. 

One of the feral things hit my car with such force it left a bloodied snout print on my window. It stammered back and reached its 4 fingered hoof hand to the wound. It began to hungrily lap at its own blood.

At this sight, another larger beast stopped inches from the injured hog's face. Its snout twitched, examining the damage. The pig dashed its mighty tusk across the throat of the other and began biting at the hole.

At this, the pigs swarmed the dying creature. They voraciously ripped with their cleft appendages. Gnashing their teeth, and gnawing its sinewy flesh. Blood soaked the faces of the feasters. Squealing with delight as they dined upon one of their own. A dog pile of 15 or more three to four-foot-tall pig people were tearing the carcass clean at my door. Still, my car wouldn't budge.

The grizzly scene before me made it clear there was only one way out. I shot a hand to my glove box gripping a clump of McDonald's napkins. Drawing them close to my face I spat the small amount of blood that had pooled after the accident.  I carefully cracked the window and stuffed the bloody napkins in the crevice. I quickly rolled the window up, suspending my blood there above the frenzy. 

One particularly famished pig, that had been left on the outskirts of the feed, was kept through the crowd. Its snout twitched and it let out a deep and terrifying scream. 

One by one the feral hog men took notice of me. They turned their attention from the bones at their hooves and all pushed to sink their gaping maws onto my own warm flesh. All of their attention and focus, now dedicated to pushing and rocking my car from the driver's side. 

The car teetered and I braced as I was cut free from the mud. The Hyundai's engine roared as we charged from the field back to the main road.

I sailed down the loam and gravel with the hogs in hot pursuit. They galloped on all fours through the mud and blood.

I inched the window down. The blood-soaked napkins fluttered out of my vehicle and floated back behind the hogs. The things all stopped and twirled chasing the napkins. The pack of mutant pig people faded out of view, trading the dim red flood for darkness.

A final bump in the road was my sign I was nearing civilization. I had returned to the county-maintained road. At breakneck speeds I made record time getting back to Golden Gate Parkway. The black asphalt glistened on the freshly watered roadway. A few minutes later I pulled into the Waffle House on exit 101.

Ignoring the dents, the scratches, the fractures, the mud, and the blood; I grabbed my iPad from my guitar case. I scarfed down my eggs and sausage and began to write.

The sun's coming up now and the lady behind the counter has been giving me weird glances ever since I sat down. I don't know if anyone out there will believe what I saw out in the Picayune, but I know I have no reason to return to the blocks in the Golden Gate Estates anytime soon.

Just as I'm about to pay, I swear I see a rock plink against the restaurant window.",1,1761960424.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

While none of these releases were exceptionally good, I‚Äôm certainly glad I went.


1. Candy Corn Cream Ale: it‚Äôs what it says on the tin. A cream ale infused with literal candy corn. Certainly the kind of sweetness you expect with a cream ale, but despite the name it didn‚Äôt end up with any ‚Äúartificial‚Äù sweetness. Not exactly full bodied but not bland either. Would drink again.


2. ‚ÄúLittle Boo:‚Äù Belgian ale with orange peel and ghost peppers. Yes, you read that correctly, infused with ghost peppers. (Not actually spicy though) The flavor comes off more like a pungency than heat. Orange peel a little weak but still pretty solid overall. At 6% not too strong, not too light. Not sure I‚Äôd have again but I‚Äôm glad I tried it.


3. ‚ÄúBlack Flame Stout:‚Äù name is pretty clearly a Hocus Pocus nod. This is a fairly standard stout. Perfect pairing for the BBQ we had at the party, but not so much on the chocolate or coffee end. More of a char character with some nice molasses.",8,1761960021.0,CraftBeer,1,0.91,False

Fujimoto's greatest defender of part 2 of csm. I am the slayer of the Gooner fiends and the Reading Comprehension devil have come forth with my part 2 theory of 3. With my gooner title...I will destroy the gooners by out gooning them. Sit back and relax. 

As per usual I recommend drinking your favorite wine and I recommend listening to this OST while enjoying my theory - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSij\_1fKl94](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSij_1fKl94)

\*\*\*Everything Is Ready For My Date With Jane.\*\*\*We Are Going To The Church In The Morning. We Will Have Coffee And Omelettes In The Cafe. After We Have Taken A Stroll In The Park, We'll Go To The Aquarium To See The Dolphins And Penguins That Jane Loves So Much. We'll Rest In The Afternoon. So, What Did We Do In The Morning? We'll Reminisce And Remember. \*\*\*We Will Not Remember.\*\*\* The Night We Spent In The Church.

\- This is the russian song reze sang on top of the building in the movie when she choked out the assassin. Nearly everything she sang about occured with Asa. My biggest takeaway is that it ends with ""we will not remember"" in this theory I will explain Reze disappearance and who took her. 

\--------I put information under each photo also explaining more---------------

Slide 0- After makima final battle of part 1 Denji fights Makima where Makima has Reze still mind controlled. Most of the bodies of the human weapons were part of the chainsaw man church lead by Barem and the Death Devil. Those weapons were fighting with makima now all of a sudden were fighting with death devil. The death devil was watching that fight. I believe the death devil is working with makima. Makima turns her head saying ""I find you disagreeable"" looking at the birds like signaling them to get Death devil. The death devil finds the weapons bodies + reze. Reze is the one missing.

Slide 1+2 -  Yoru proclaims she is willing to turn her own children to weapons to defeat chainsaw man. Willing to anything she wants. She not only did that for tank and gun but she also absorbed falling devil. I believe the death devil forced war devil to absorb Reze as part of her plan. So I started to think...What if the 3 birds flying together (chapter 99) Yoru, Asa, Reze. There were a lot of similarities of all 3 looking similar but I believe the ""hair theory"" has an affect on how people see them differently. (hair theory changes how people look dramatically). So I started to look more past that. I started to look for similar panels and similar gestures...in the next few slides I will present to you panels that I found very similar between Reze and asa/yoru.

 Slide 3-11 by Jane doe song  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNxCLMKGZ0o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNxCLMKGZ0o) . This is for immersion to think of both asa and reze when looking at their panels. ""come find me"" ""scars remain on your withered skin"" (yoru?)  ""where are you...i'm right here""

Slide 4- Asa and Reze both wearing long black socks. A lot of panels showing close up shots of Asa socks to emphasize them.

Slide 5/6- Both lose an arm and the arm is regrown to create a weapon. 

Slide 7- Denji carrying both girls. And Both put their hand on top of Denji. 

Slide 8- Laughing and holding their stomach. Not very common. Only happened to these characters. 

Slide 9- Only panels of bowing to denji. Almost like a foreshadow coming with both of them bowing as the two choices? :)

Slide 11- Both the same uniforms. But I guess maybe they just went to the same school? :). Both tripped seems kind of sus. 

\-Jane doe means no name. Unkown or don't remember. Perfect name imo-

Slide 12- Typoon fights with Reze and two cars are shown. Those two cars happen to be the same two cars used as the accident devil that Yoru uses. 

Slide 13- Now lets make a hypothetical. We are shown early on that when yoru is in control Asa has a hard time controlling her. Otherwise she would have stopped her multiple times. What if Reze is in there when Yoru is in control.  The panel ""only the other me likes you"" which is in bold. Almost like its telling us something. It would be too obvious for us if it was asa...but if it was reze. What if Reze is preventing that because I believe reze loves denji more than asa. Asa is more concerned with putting herself out of misery. Suicidal people tend to not want to commmit suicide if they love someone. Love is incredibly strong. Love can make someone have the will to live. But that is just IMO.

Slide 14- I also noticed an accident slide of yoru without marks. It is a clear mistake but she kind of looks a lot like reze when her hair is wet talking to denji. 

Slide 15 + 16 - There is a theory that Asa is cake and Denji is eating it foreshadowing that denji will eat asa. I do not believe this. Not only did yoshida tell him he will stop him but Denji also doesn't eat a cake when Power brings it to him. Asa also didn't eat her cake when she was younger. Then on top of that Look back references the cake shirt and 2 fingers up. Before the premiere of the movie he drew a painting of Reze holding two fingers up. Around the same time Asa put up two fingers saying she won. And Denji before hand was crying holding two choices. This is the two choices. Asa or Reze. It doesn't make sense for it to be between Asa and Yoru.  Yoru deserves to lose. But if Reze is in there....and Denji has to pick between asa and reze...he will become depressed again and lose control of pochita...Death devil's goal. 

That is why Fumiko warned in in ch212; ""what happens if you defeat war devil...that will trigger death devil wiping out mankind like the prophecy""

This concludes part 2 of my theory. Part 3 will be allign with the end goal of Death devil and how it alligns with Makima's goal. A more powerful stronger devil is yet to come. 

  
Slide 17- Makima's goal.
