1r2fqy5,https://i.redd.it/m40zylxisyig1.jpeg,The Word of God [Quick Post],"Another sleepless night, just staring into the abyss of all of the things I have to research.... 

*【Welcome back everyone, how ya doin? Oh how you doing? Come on in and have a seat, because this one is gonna be a bit fun, I'm Ajima ViVi, and this is-】*

- **The Never Existing Word of God**

So we do hear this a lot... especially from Muslims ""Word of God this"" and even from modern day Christians ""Word of God that"".

In reality? This is a theological term that was coined much later after many books of the Hebrew Bible and new testament were composed.... the Bible as we know of today, in all of its canonized 66 books! Does **NOT** call itself the ""Word of God"".

While the term is mentioned multiple times in the new testament, it is not referring to the book, but rather to the preaching of christ or his disciples like in the book of Acts, and it's mainly talking about the preaching of a certain thing, not the ""entire message"". 

But this is important because it actually causes a bit of an issu-

- **The F*ckin ISSUE!**

The Hebrew Bible, and the new testament were originally prophetic texts that includes a message from God, it is ""inspired"", while we can debate all we want on this, what is cut and clear is that the scripture itself doesn't refer to itself as ""the word of god"" nor is it implied that this is a the divine canon, there are some interpretations that attempt to harmonize it, but those fall flat, after all... they are trying to treat the Bible as a unilateral one piece of literature instead 66 different ones. 

So where does this become an issue? 

The Quran, Muhammad, and early Muslims by proxy, existed in a post-biblical interpretation period, most of their theology was influenced by Christian theology, a theology that claimed the Bible is ""the word of god"" so that notion was settled to them in the late 6th to early 7th century... which made this idea that those books were God's exact words that came down from God.

This gave birth to the quranic claim that the Quran is the word of God, sent by God to guide people... then claiming that the Torah and gospel were also the word of God and sent down to guide people... 

Multiple issues here, the Torah is only the first 5 books of the Hebrew Bible, and is basically the 3rd of the story... Tanakh is the whole thing... which is short of Torah (the law) Nevi'im (Prophet stories) and Ketuvim (writings/poetry). And the Gospel is... well its obviously not the entire new testament, which gospel exactly? The testament is made of 4 gospels, 14 letters by Paul (allegedly) and other books as well.... and none of them called this whole jumbled scripture the WORD OF GOD... it's just a claim made through Christian catholic theology that early Muslims were exposed to so they thought it was true.

- **Conclusion**

So yeah, when these books never called themselves the word of god, but the Quran does because that was the known post-biblical theology, further shows why this is not a book from a god... but a book written by a bunch of people who don't know history, and didn't bother to actually read/understand the abrahamic scriptures.

1r2fpid,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1r2fpid/i_hate_my_wifes_new_friend_so_much/,I hate my wife’s new friend so much,"I am 28m and my wife is 26f, we have actually been together since we were 14/16. she has never really had a friend before, not even exaggerating. she’s shy as can be, our families were friends so her and I were close since she was born pretty much. she stuck with me as much as possible, but has struggled to make friends

shes also a housewife now, so she doesn’t meet a lot of people.. she goes out a lot and goes to a ton of beauty related appointments but does it all solo

she recently decided she wanted a girlfriend, and she signed up for some group for girls to socialize.

she made two friends, I love one of them.. the other I want to ban from our house lol

first off, she’s trans. I’m not exactly against it, but I don’t support it either and do not really want her around my wife or future family. I’ve never been transphobic, and I’m not hateful towards anyone for that reason.

i hate the way she talks to her, I’ve overheard more than one conversation I wanted to end.

there are a few examples, but one was just the other night she was trying to convince my wife  to explore more options, and was asking her if being a housewife makes her happy, and asking if she wanted to work. She was just sitting there trying To convince her she’s been brainwashed or something.. while she’s the one trying to brainwash her.

I heard my wife saying she was happy and her “friend” said “are you really happy or is he telling you you’re happy” like what the hell does that even mean. coming into my house, that I bought for her and then trying to convince her i don’t have her best interest. while they’re sitting in the spare bedroom I spent thousands on to turn into her dream walk in closet. this “girl” was quick to compliment her pink car and our home but then tries to tell my wife im holding her back.

  
im 100% sure she is jealous, and wants to be a housewife/stay at home mom One day but obviously cant

good thing my wife is smart and knows whose taking care of her and didn’t fall for any of it. still pissed me off

they met less than 4 months ago. I have known her since the day she was born, yes this lifestyle is perfect for her. She’s happy, she never questioned her happiness. she has said other weird things, that I am positive even my wife didn’t like but she’s way to nice and way too excited to have a new friend.

I can’t stand her, I do not want my wife to be corrupted.. and I also do not want them alone. That’s still a 6’0 tall biological male.. I trust my wife but I do not trust she’s safe to be honest.

but I also feel bad telling her not to hangout with her. I might just suggest she keeps going to the group and hope she finds some normal girls to be around. ive Been asking around at work trying to find her some new friends and thank god I found another guy with a housewife her age.

1r2fp2a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r2fp2a,MAHORAGA IS MILK,"MAHORAGA IS MILK. Now hear me out, it makes sense. Just think about it. Lactose intolerant people, are drawn to milk, maybe drinking it more than people who don’t. Even though they’ll shit their brains out. So, what if Megumi is Lactose Intolerant, what if he’s the 65-70% of Ten Shadow Users who’s lactose intolerant. If Mahoraga is Milk, Megumi would be more enticed to using it. And get this, how does Megumi like his Coffee? Black. No dairy in it.

You still think this is just some conspiracy? Think I wear some Tin Foil Hat? Well guess what, what’s the creation story in Norse Mythology? Let me explain it. In Norse Mythology, Ice and Heat met, creating two beings, Ymir (a giant) and the cosmis Cow Audhumla. Ymir grew with the milk and whatever, but what if when he drank it a drop fell? That was Mahoraga, white and strong like milk. What’s above a Divine Creature? Cosmic. You may say, “oh but how can he be milk, wouldn’t it spoil?”. Your right, so that means, Mahoraga is cheese. What kind? Well Scientists have discovered a cheese about 7,200 years old, called “Ancient Mediterranean Cheese” made from Cow Milk.

What I’m saying with all of this is, I’m in Geges mind rn, Megumi isn’t a bum who just spam his alt but is lactose intolerant and just wants dairy, and I’m the best genius in the world. ✋🥛🤚",3,1770858701.0,Jujutsufolk,3,0.8,False

1r2fnc3,https://v.redd.it/mv7us1qcpyig1,Agent superhuman capability and ether tolerance,"by now I’m sure everyone’s heard of the theory connecting the number of agents with red eyes and ether tolerance. One idea that came to mind recently for me was whether or not ether tolerance can be linked back to the super human nature of the playable agents. The vast majority of New Eridu humans are pretty 1 to 1 with us irl, even the proxies with the exception of their eyes are physically normies. Meanwhile there are dozens of people able to perform feats of strength and speed thats basically demigod levels, cybernetics or not. Every playable agent and a good chunk of the antagonists we’ve faced have a higher than average ether tolerance, so I wonder, could it be linked to these superhuman feat? maybe the hollows have a strengthening effect on their bodies overtime, or they’re heavily tolerant as a side effect of naturally being immensely strong for whatever reason?  

Of course I know zzz inherently plays with cartoon physics and logic, so maybe it might be me looking too deeply into it.

1r2fmsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1r2fmsy/insulation/,Insulation,"“They say the guy who owned this place before me was insane,” Rich said, smirking as he set a box down.

“Who says that,” Tony asked. He did not bother hiding his skepticism.

“The realtor.”

Tony grunted. He was not in the mood for stories. He had agreed to help Rich move in, but after hours of hauling dusty boxes and wrestling couches around corners too tight, his patience was gone.

“Nice place though,” Rich continued, unfazed. “I got a really good deal on it.” There was an edge of excitement in his voice.

“Shame about the view,” Tony said flatly.

Birch Street had once been one of the most desirable areas in Glen Haven, prized for the privacy offered by the surrounding woods. That had changed two years earlier, when a wildfire tore through the forest east of the neighborhood, reducing nearly two hundred acres of trees to ash.

The loss cut deep. The woods were more than scenery to the town. They were history. That stretch of land in particular had been fiercely protected. Residents had fought developers for years, through lawsuits and appeals, through planning boards and city council meetings. Ownership of the development company changed hands so often no one could keep track. Each new proposal was rejected. Each objection upheld.

Until there was nothing left to protect.

With the trees gone, resistance lost its teeth.

Tony and Rich stood at the large side window, looking out over what had once been a quiet natural vista. Now it was a sprawling expanse of concrete and exposed earth. Foundations scarred the ground. Chain link fences and warning signs in every site line. Trucks and heavy equipment sat idle in no particular order. Utility lines lay open and waiting.

Only one house stood complete.

It sat alone in the center of the construction zone, pristine and finished, surrounded by the gray ugliness of progress. 

“Why build just one house,” Tony asked.

“They call that one the Dollhouse,” Rich said. “It’s been there since the eighties, I think. It burned down in the fire, but they rebuilt it. Supposedly it’s so people can see what the developers plan to put here.”

Tony shook his head. “No wonder the last guy sold this place.”

“He didn’t sell it,” Rich said.

Tony looked at him.

“He died.”

Tony left around six that evening, he worked at a hardware store and had to be at work early Monday morning to restock. Rich had every intention of organizing and unpacking, but after dragging his mattress into place and fitting the sheets with aching arms, his resolve faded. He balanced his television on an unopened moving box at the foot of the bed, the cardboard bowing slightly under the weight, and let a movie play more for background than interest. Somewhere around the halfway point he became aware of how still the house was. Not quiet in the way an empty room is quiet, but padded, softened. The warmth held steady, gentle and even, and the silence pressed in just enough to feel intentional. His eyes grew heavy. He did not fight it.

Rich woke the next morning disoriented. His first night in the house may have been the best rest he had ever had. No traffic. No pipes knocking. No distant hums or night sounds creeping in at the edges. The room was perfectly cozy and perfectly silent, the kind of silence that felt protective. Then he noticed the time. His stomach dropped. Moving in on a Sunday had been a mistake after all. He threw on clothes, grabbed his keys, and rushed out the front door.

The moment it shut behind him, his phone came alive in his hand. Buzz after buzz after buzz. Missed calls. Text messages stacked one on top of another. He stopped on the porch, staring down at the screen, confused. Service could be spotty in Glen Haven, sure, but it had never vanished completely. He scrolled through the notifications, all time stamped hours earlier. He glanced back at the house, its windows dark and unreadable.

Strange, he thought.

That night Rich returned home from work under a sky already heavy with early winter. The day had been the first truly bitter one of the season, the kind that burned the lungs and stiffened fingers. Somewhere between hauling boxes, signing paperwork, and the long drive home the night before, it occurred to him that he had never checked the furnace. The thought followed him up the front steps like a bad feeling he could not shake.

He turned the key and opened the door.

Warm air rushed out to meet him, thick and suffocating, as if he had opened an oven instead of his house. It wrapped around his face and chest, stealing his breath for a moment.

“Jesus Christ,” Rich muttered.

His first thought was the gas bill. The kind of heat he was feeling was expensive, reckless even. He dropped his bag and hurried to the thermostat. The display read seventy five degrees. The set temperature below it read sixty eight.

Rich frowned.

“Doesn’t that mean it shuts off once it hits sixty eight,” he said to no one.

*Yes.*

He leaned closer, listening. There was no hum. No click. No familiar churn of a furnace cycling on and off. In fact there was nothing at all. No background noise. No distant rattle of pipes or air moving through vents. Just heat. Heavy, unmoving heat.

He walked into the mudroom that connected the living room to the garage, the small space doubling as a utility room. Washer. Dryer. Furnace. He opened the furnace panel and stared.

The switch was set to off.

There was no heat pumping into the house.

It was just hot.

This was strange, but not really a problem. He told himself, already tallying the money he would save without a gas bill.

Rich glanced down at his phone. Zero bars.

With nothing else to distract him, he spent the rest of Monday unpacking. Furniture shifted, then shifted back again. Cupboards filled with plates and food. The hollow shell of the house slowly softened into something that felt livable.

He set a glass fruit bowl on the kitchen counter. When he turned away, his elbow caught it. The bowl hit the floor and shattered.

The sound died too quickly.

Not faded. Not echoed. It was cut short, like a gunshot fired underwater.

Rich straightened and stared at the shards scattered across the tile. He wasn’t annoyed. He was intrigued.

He lifted a box onto the counter and reached inside, pulling out a coffee mug at random. A gift from his mother.

“Definitely not that one,” he muttered, setting it aside.

He grabbed another cup, old and stained, the kind he would shove to the back of the cupboard and forget about. Closing his eyes, he turned his head away and dropped it.

The crash was loud, violent. And then silence flooded the room before the pieces had finished falling.

It wasn’t quiet. It was smothered.

“Hello,” Rich called out.

His voice vanished the moment it left him.

He laughed, uncertain.

“Helloooooooo,” he tried, stretching the word, pushing it outward. But again the sound was swallowed whole, as if a pillow had been pressed over his mouth before the last syllable could form.

Rich chuckled.

“Weird,” he said to himself.

*Yes.*

Rich grabbed a dustpan and broom and swept the glass into a plastic bag. He carried it outside and tossed it into the trash. As he turned back toward the house, his eyes caught on the shed at the edge of the property. It looked solid. Well kept. And he realized he had not looked inside it once since moving in.

“Might as well,” he said.

As he crossed the yard, his phone buzzed to life again. Two missed calls from Tony and a single text.

‘What was the name of the previous owner again?’

Rich slipped the phone back into his pocket. It was too cold to stand around texting.

He reached the shed with a small surge of excitement.

“Please God, a snowblower,” he said out loud.

Michigan winters were unforgiving. The snow had not started yet, but it never waited long.

He pulled the door open.

The shed was packed solid.

From floor to ceiling, wall to wall, every inch was filled with insulation. Fiberglass batts still wrapped in plastic. Stacked rolls of mineral wool, dense and gray. Rigid foam boards cut to precise sizes, some labeled, some not. Buckets of blown cellulose. Cans of expanding spray foam, dozens of them, arranged neatly like ammunition. Sheets of reflective barrier folded and stacked, their metallic surfaces dull with dust.

There was no room to step inside. Not even a foot.

It was not messy. It was deliberate.

Rich stood there, confused at first, then thoughtful. Maybe the realtor had been wrong. Maybe the previous owner was not insane at all. Maybe he had simply been thorough. Brilliant, even. The house was sealed tighter than anything Rich had ever stepped foot in. Winter felt like summer already.

The thought made him pause.

The house did not have air conditioning. If winter felt like summer, how would summer feel.

Rich closed the shed door and headed back inside. He made himself a sandwich and sat at the small dining table, enjoying the warmth, the stillness.

*Lou.*

Rich looked up.

He thought he heard something but he couldn’t have. If noise was a living being it feared this place, sounds were a thing of the past, he thought to himself jokingly. He shook his head and remembered Tony’s text. Stepping back outside, he pulled out his phone. It buzzed immediately.

‘???’

Why was Tony so urgent about the previous owner’s name.

Rich typed back quickly.

‘His name was Lou something. Don’t remember his last name. Sorry, no service here.’

The cold was already biting through his jacket. He did not wait for a response. He slipped the phone away and returned to his warm, quiet house.

The door closed behind him, and the silence settled back into place.

Rich settled into his newly established living room, sinking into the sofa, eager to finally relax. He pulled out his phone. Still no bars. He scrolled through his previous texts from Tony, the missed calls, wondering why the name of the previous owner had suddenly been so urgent. A landline would fix this, he thought, but until then he might try leaving the phone somewhere in the house that could pick up a signal in case of emergencies.

He wandered from room to room, holding the phone down in front of him, scanning walls, countertops, and windowsills. When he passed the large bay window facing the single solitary Dollhouse in the distance, he froze. The sight was surreal. a lone structure standing like a beacon in the middle of the desolation. No lights were on.

Rich continued his search, placing the phone in strategic corners, opening cupboards, balancing it on desks and ledges, his last stop was the fireplace but even that was a dud. Defeated, he sank down against the hearth.

That’s when he noticed it. Something was off. The glass panels of the fireplace looked wrong. He leaned closer. The inside didn’t reflect light, it swallowed it. With a frown, he opened the small doors. Inside, foam board had been painted black and crudely duct-taped into place.

“Afraid of Santa Claus, huh Lou?” he muttered with a weak laugh, shaking his head at his own joke.

*Not exactly.*

Rich’s head jerked up. Then down again, eyes flicking to the phone, agitated. He froze, holding his breath. He thought he heard something, a faint breath, a whisper, maybe just the house settling, but his heart began to race. He stood perfectly still, listening. Silence.

After a long minute, he forced himself to relax. Being in the house without sound for so long must be playing tricks on him, he told himself. His mind had grown so used to absolute quiet that it was starting to create noises where there were none. That’s what he told himself anyway.

Rich pulled the foam board free from the fireplace. A thin, cool breeze slipped into the room, brushing his face. It felt good. Almost relieving.

His phone buzzed in his hand. Three missed calls from Tony.

“Great,” Rich muttered. He stood and walked toward the kitchen but the signal vanished as quickly as it had appeared. Zero bars again. He frowned and turned back toward the living room. With each step closer to the fireplace, the bars climbed back into place, one by one, as if responding to him.

Rich stopped just short of the hearth and watched the screen steady itself.

“I guess this is where you live for now,” he said, half joking, half resigned.

He sealed the fireplace doors to shut out the cold and threw the painted foam into the middle of his garage to deal with later. He swept up the bits of debris he had kicked loose when removing the foam and then plugged his phone in on the hearth.

The room fell perfectly silent again, warm and silent.

His phone began to charge, and Rich decided it was time for bed. Lately he’d been going to sleep earlier and earlier. Maybe it was the warmth. Maybe it was the silence. The house seemed built for sleep.

That night began like the others. Sleep came quickly, gently, without resistance.

He dreamed.

He was floating in a dark sea, the water calm and warm, thick as bathwater. It carried him without effort. He didn’t need to swim. He was content. Safe. The surface above him was smooth and black, unbroken by stars.

Something pale drifted in the distance.

At first he thought it was foam. A scrap of white caught in the swell. But it rose and fell with intention, bobbing in a slow, patient rhythm. Rich focused on it, and it began to grow larger, closer.

It was a head.

The water around him stirred as the shape lifted higher, revealing a face. Pale. Too pale. The kind of white that belonged underwater. The face was smiling, wide and eager, eyes stretched open as if they had never learned how to blink.

Rich felt his heartbeat quicken. The water responded.

The sea began to roll, slow waves at first, then stronger, heavier. The figure’s bobbing grew faster, almost playful. With every rise and fall it came closer. Fifty feet away now. Then forty. The distance didn’t seem to matter. He could see her perfectly.

She was a woman. Her hair trailed behind her like black ink in water. Her smile never wavered. Her eyes were locked on his, unblinking, thrilled.

Hungry.

Rich turned and tried to swim away, but the water thickened, resisted him. The waves rose black and heavy, shoving him back no matter how hard he kicked. He was moving, but going nowhere.

She laughed.

The sound carried through the water, muffled but sharp, and she surged forward, arms churning, splashing wildly. She wasn’t conserving energy. She didn’t need to. She knew she would reach him.

Rich cried out, choking on seawater. The world beneath him began to shake, not constantly, but in steady pulses. The sea vibrated in a familiar rhythm. One beat. Then another. Over and over.

Twenty feet away.

Her mouth opened wider, the smile splitting, teeth bared like an animal’s. The shaking intensified. The pulses grew stronger, faster, syncing perfectly with the pounding in his chest.

Rich screamed.

The water convulsed.

And then he was upright in bed, more awake than he had ever felt in his life.

“What the fuck was that,” he shouted.

*Me.*

The dream vanished instantly, leaving no soft edges behind. But the rhythm remained.

A faint buzzing filled the room. A vibration, steady and familiar, echoing the pulse from the dream. Sound didn’t linger in this house, but it was never obstructed either.

His phone, he realized.

Still buzzing.

Still calling.

Rich bolted out of bed with sudden, desperate purpose and headed for the phone. He flipped on every light he passed, flooding the hallway and kitchen with harsh yellow pools that did nothing to chase the image of the dark sea still sloshing through his mind. The dream clung to him like wet clothes. His phone continued to buzz, steady and insistent, guiding him forward.

The buzzing stopped the moment he stepped into the living room.

Rich froze.

The fireplace door was wide open.

His phone lay on the mantel directly above it, screen dark now, perfectly still, as if it had never made a sound at all. The black opening of the fireplace yawned beneath it, deep and lightless, swallowing the glow from the room.

Rich felt his stomach drop.

He told himself he was being stupid. Nightmares did that. They blurred things. Air pressure could open doors. Maybe that was why the foam board had been there in the first place. A draft.

He moved slowly, every step careful, listening for anything. Anything at all. The house offered nothing back. No creaks. No settling. No hum of heat or air. Just that dense, padded silence pressing in around him.

When he reached the fireplace he lifted his foot and kicked both glass doors shut without using his hands. They closed with a dull, muffled clack that died instantly. Only then did he grab his phone and step back quickly.

The charging cord ripped free from the phone, the plug snapping back against the wall, but Rich did not look away from the fireplace. He backed up until his calves hit the couch and stopped there, breathing shallowly, waiting.

Nothing happened.

The silence thickened. His heart slowed just enough for him to notice how hard it was to breathe. He forced in a few deep breaths and finally looked down at his phone.

No notifications. No missed calls. No voicemails.

Full bars.

“Ok then,” Rich said out loud, the words brittle and hollow in the air.

The sound vanished immediately. The room swallowed it whole.

He wasn’t sure who he was pretending for. There was no one else here. Just him and the house.

His chest tightened. His hands tingled. He felt like he was breathing too fast and not enough at the same time. Maybe it was a panic attack. He had never had one before, but this felt wrong enough to qualify. He needed to hear another human voice.

Rich called Tony.

Tony picked up on the fifth ring.

“Rich?” Tony said, already annoyed.

“Hey Tony, what’s going on,” Rich said, forcing his voice into something casual.

“Dude, it’s two thirty in the morning. Why are you calling me,” Tony snapped.

The reality of it hit Rich all at once. He suddenly worried how insane he must sound.

“Oh, right, sorry,” Rich said quickly. “I saw I missed a few calls from you and thought I’d check in.”

“At two thirty,” Tony said sarcastically.

Rich scrambled. “Service is bad out here. I thought it might be an emergency.”

“No,” Tony said. He paused. “I called you hours ago. Yesterday, actually. I called you yesterday.”

“Sorry,” Rich said.

His breathing had steadied. The house had not.

There was a long silence on the line.

“So why’d you call me,” Rich asked, needing to fill it.

Tony sighed heavily. “The guy you bought the house from. Yeah. He was insane for sure.”

Rich felt his throat tighten.

“I ran into him a few times,” Tony continued. “Made deliveries to your place back when he owned it. Didn’t recognize the house without all the trees.”

Rich was surprised “Why did you think he was insane,” he asked.

“The guy was convinced someone was talking to him,” Tony said. “Some monster or something, maybe it was the devil, I don’t remember. I think he was schizophrenic. One time he told me his brother wouldn’t talk to him anymore, so to fix it he bought out the store’s entire supply of salt.”

Rich swallowed. “What.”

“Yeah. Every bag we had. Spent thousands. It was December too. We hauled pallet after pallet to your house. Screwed the town over pretty bad. Winter was brutal that year. Guess he thought it would fix things with his brother somehow. My guess is that he doesn’t even have a brother.”

Rich said nothing.

“Anyway, I’m going back to sleep,” Tony muttered.

“Ok” said Rich flatly.

The line went dead.

Rich stood alone in his living room, phone pressed to his ear, surrounded by light that felt thin and useless. The fireplace sat quietly across from him, its doors closed now, reflecting his own face back at him.

The silence pressed in.

Rich could not shake the certainty that somewhere, someone was listening.

His eyes kept drifting back to the fireplace. It no longer looked like part of the room. It felt like a weak point, an exposed seam in a suit of armor that had otherwise held. He did not understand what was happening, or even if anything truly was happening at all, but instinct overruled reason. The foam board had been there for something. If it had kept the dreams away, if it had kept the voice distant, then losing his phone signal felt like a small price to pay.

Rich headed for the garage.

He stopped with his hand on the door handle and listened.

Nothing.

He unlocked the door and opened it just enough to reach inside and flip the light switch. The garage flickered to life, revealing an empty concrete space. No car. No clutter. Just bare walls and oil stained floor. He stepped inside, eyes already searching the center of the room where he was sure he had left the foam board.

It was gone.

His head snapped left and right. His breath quickened. His stomach twisted as panic began to bloom again.

The garage door slammed shut behind him.

The sound exploded through the space, echoing wildly. This room had not been insulated. The noise lingered, bounced, multiplied.

“Fuck,” Rich shouted, the word cracking with fear.

The lights went out.

“What the fuck,” he yelled again, louder now.

“Who’s there.”

He backed away blindly from where he thought the door was, hands outstretched, but the darkness swallowed everything. No edges. No depth. No orientation. He kept stepping back until he hit something solid.

Then nothing.

His hands met only air.

Tears welled in his eyes.

Rich stopped moving.

He listened.

There was nothing.

No footsteps. No breathing. No movement at all.

Moonlight seeped weakly through a small window in the rear garage door, barely enough to suggest shapes. The rest of the room was a void. A blackness so complete it made him think of the sea from his dream. Endless and depthless.

He could hear his heart pounding. He could hear his own sobbing. The sounds died quickly, swallowed the same way everything else did in this house.

It was so dark.

*Rich.*

The word landed softly but perfectly formed.

“Holy fuck,” he screamed, collapsing inward as tears spilled down his face.

“Who are you,” he begged.

*Do you want to see.*

The voice was clear now. The voice was close now.

“No,” Rich shouted. “Please let me go.”

*Come and see me.*

He broke.

His breathing turned frantic, shallow gasps ripping from his chest as he sank to the floor. The black sea surged back into his mind. The pale face. The hunger in her eyes. He could see it more clearly now, forming in the darkness, emerging from the corners of the garage. He rocked back and forth without realizing it, as if caught in a current. The black waves overtaking him again.

Then the noise began.

A violent, grinding roar tore through the air above him. Constant. Mechanical. Unforgiving.

Light flooded the space in jagged pieces.

Rich looked up through blurred vision as the garage door slowly lifted. The ancient motor screamed in protest, the rusted chain rattling as it hauled the heavy door upward inch by inch. Moonlight spilled in, carving the darkness apart.

Then the noise stopped.

Silence returned.

Rich stared out of the open garage.

In the distance, the dollhouse stood alone.

A single light was on in the window. The structure stood in a vast black and grey ocean, glowing like a lighthouse meant to guide something home.

The ringing in Rich’s ears would not stop. His stomach churned. His heart pounded harder than it ever had before.

And the silence pressed in again.

I am fortunate enough to have gotten my psych evaluation while on my mom’s PPO insurance. It hardly cost me anything. Maybe $10 each time I saw the psychologist. We did all of the tests and on my psych evaluation it said I would benefit from medication and that I have unspecified type adhd.

I started dating my bf (m28) and around two months into us dating I went, “hmm… I’ve done all of this before… procrastinating homework to the point that it’s two hours before it’s due and finally doing it, piles of clean and dirty clothes on the floor, time blindness…” a few other things that I’m forgetting. So, I gave him one of my stims for a day during his finals week last semester and boom, he actually had motivation to study, did all of his homework he was behind on, cleaned his entire apartment, and did one more other task. He said that the racing thoughts in his head went away and he noticed instead of shaking his leg in class to focus, he actually sat still and things made so much more sense to him in his head. Also, when he drinks coffee he says it can put him to sleep. Not sure if this one is like factually accurate for adhd symptoms but it’s one he told me which I had too.

He was super excited to meet with the either psychologist or psychiatrist his PCP with Kaiser referred him to. When he met with them they basically said, “Well sounds like you’re lazy. Or, sounds like you have anxiety.”  They wanted to start him on anxiety meds which my bf said no to. He didn’t want to start medication for anxiety. He wanted  psych eval like the one I had.

To be fair, my psychiatrist started me on antidepressants when I first met w him but what do you know, I kept forgetting stuff and the moment I went on adhd meds I felt like I was my childhood self again!!

I was also confused because shouldn’t he have gotten the psych eval like I was offered?? The professional he met with said “you either start on this anti anxiety medication or you start nothing at all. If you want, we can meet in a few months… I guess. But I don’t see what would change if you don’t agree to take the medication I’m recommending.” There was one girl I knew when I was 18 who asked me how tf I got on birth control bc her doctor at Kaiser just straight up told her no. Idk are Kaiser doctors always like this?

Are there like any online psychologists he could meet with that he would pay out of pocket to meet that aren’t super expensive? Idk what his options are. I’m just asking to see if anything could help him get on the right path towards a proper diagnosis.

Today’s thoughts, thoroughly told through tongue twisting tidbits. Thanks

I came to Reddit for some recreational reading and to learn new things and …Nope, not even close. I came to Reddit for the kinky dark side of things to help me get over a rather shitty, long term break-up. After 12 years of open phone privileges, the thought that my phone is now all mine was overwhelming to say the least. The “kids” I work with talk about Reddit, I rarely pay attention to their ramblings. To be honest, the only thing I really remembered one of them saying was the dark side of Reddit will swallow your soul through your screen. Ha! Wowzers, after only a couple days lurking through the dark sides comment section had me shook. I ordered a bible on Amazon, I’m not a religious person, just thought it might be a good thing to have in the house, right beside my brand new gun. Once the shock value wore off I didn’t like Reddit. I was on my way out. Then some random post on my feed in a group called seven word sentences said something like

“His taking time to communicate is everything”

For the life of me, I have absolutely no idea why, I responded with

“Certain characters communication commenced cautiously, calmly; caring”

The person complimented my alliteration…so I googled alliteration…That little compliment sparked something I had no idea I liked. 20 minutes later and half a dozen alliterations articulately adorned almost all available areas that allowed for noobs to post in. I was so hooked. I had people responding with clever comebacks and snappy zingers. Some threads continued for 15-20 replies. I had new friends slide into my DMs in the most polite and friendly ways. Compliments and questions about what I do. Bro, I am dumb. I just like rearranging words so they go beep beep bopbity  bop bop boop bup.

The more I posted in the comment section the braver I got. I decided to post my own and see what would happen.  I had a couple comments left, a few upvotes, but then some random Redditor  matched my replies pretty quickly, so I dug in. I’m an old man, I’m stubborn and I hate to lose. So did they and instead of ending the thread, we started a new one. I made a friend because sometimes silly sentences start sounding so substantial.

I got really brave, I posted

“I am the last great Batman” in a 6 word only sub. I wanted to highlight the structure of the challenge-the first word is 1 letter second word is 2 letters third word is 3 and so on- so I put numbers under each word like a karaoke sing-a-long guide hoping it would standout and get some fun comments. When I posted it, the numbers appeared at the end of the title, a clear violation of the rules. There is also a note on the icon badge saying rules strictly enforced. I did not read the rules. Nor did I understand the value those rules bring. I got a week long ban. The mod reached out to explain, my initial response wasn’t exactly positive. I played in some other groups but couldn’t post in some because of account age. Having made a friend, they gave me some pointers and tips and encouraged me to stay, wait out the ban and come back. I didn’t really want to, but they were pretty convincing.

I decided that I was going to use Reddit just for word games, that’s it. I did not like having the NSFW icon on my page. I decided to delete my account and start a fresh clean SFW account. I mixed up 6words only and 6 word stories and ended up committing ban evasion. This time I reached out to the mod and explained my mistake. I had no intentions of evading my ban, Reddit can prove that by looking through my original conversations. I haven’t deleted the account or the comments left. I just made a mistake, that mistake got me a permanent ban. I created another account just to reach out to let someone know I wouldn’t be back and the only way to reconnect was to commit another ban evasion move lol - side note, I left like some sort of secret spy leaving cryptic messages-  although it wasn’t so cryptic

“I pot perma banned” lol so that account got shut down too.

I decided to read Reddits rules. All of them. I wondered around and read comment sections and noticed the togetherness these games brought random strangers. I noticed a handful of small groups of people who would chat in the comment section. Seeing the type of conversations had, it was easy to get lost in the wholesomeness of their community. I started to see the Reddit Reddit probably wishes it had. And I really liked it. I wanted in. I wanted to post daily alliterations and help build subreddits in a positive and (hopefully, maybe-sorta-kinda) poetic way.

In only a couple days, the positive impact Reddit has had on me has honestly blown my mind. It’s a wonderful place to get away for a quick break and enjoy some fun. The community spirit that Reddit prides itself on is my only hope at any chance of getting my account back. I have no idea why I decided to try posting this or what I expect to happen, maybe some advice? Maybe some silly sentences? Who knows, I can’t post any alliteration without getting another instant ban, so I’m trying to curb that addiction by daily pleas to random redditors to help me get my account back…maybe I should just go get another dog

Tomorrow - rules vs community

Double down. Deliciously dank dissertation described dumbly

Rapidly reacting Reddit robots remove rebellious Redditor

Another new account, same, silly old man.

I had this whole follow-up thing all lined up in my head. I knew exactly how I wanted to start this off and every detail I wanted to share. I was going to talk about community, and how growing up in a small town in northern Canada instilled values I didn’t understand until well into adulthood. I had a childhood story to tell about drinking water from garden hoses and being home when the street lights came on. A story about so many small and seemingly unimportant nuances that occur when the masses care about the individual. I was going to lay it on thick and heavy. I had to if I wanted to make the rules seem like community shattering restrictive behaviour. Somewhere between the couch and the espresso maker, I changed my mind.

I made myself an Americano and let the words roll around in my head. Nothing coherent. Just incomplete alliterations tucked away for later completion - That’s new. Then a notification came through. The person whose comment I used in yesterday’s post had read my ramblings. They reached out with some kind words and we had a quick chat. I ended up on their page and had a peek. 3 maybe 4 thumb flicks down their page and the first tear delicately dribbled downward dripping droplets directly on to the phone screen, one more scrolled page and I was boo-wooing silently. I haven’t cried since that childhood story I was going to tell you about. I spent the next 10 minutes or so gorging myself on their words, they were writing a story, 7 words at a time. I don’t know if they know they are doing it or not, but it was the most beautiful thing I’ve ever read. Not that there was much competition, but moving forward the competition has some serious competition. It wasn’t until somewhere near the end of my scrolling that I realized I had been reading this story backwards. Their first post “brick by brick, His words broke barriers”. I reread the page, this time in the original order. For the second time today and the third time in my life I was crying. The tears streamed down my  weather-withered hardened face and soaked my beard. My lips hurt from the clinched smile I was trying to hide under the mess of facial hair I neglected to tame this morning. I put my phone down and let the emotional flood gates run wild. I don’t know the right words to accurately describe why I had such a strong emotional reaction to their words, I felt completely drained, exhausted but oh so, so satisfied. I loved every 7 word sentence and can’t wait to keep following along. I hope we become friends, until then, I’ll patiently follow.

I swallowed the last sip of my, now cold coffee and had a think. I’m a text book example of a classic over-thinker, but this time my thoughts were straight-line focused and new. Not the same nonsense I typically think about, these thoughts made me think even harder. Thoroughly taking time to think these thoughts through, seemed slightly scary since sometimes, something so sensitive shakes souls. I put on a pair of dirty Carharts and my boots and went outside to chop some firewood. The smooth, hard wood handle of my axe felt familiar. Each swing, comforting. The smell  of the freshly split wood makes me feel like a man again. I drive the axe head deep into my splitting stump. When did I stop feeling like a man? My thoughts scatter and I start to think that this time the thoughts I’m having might not be the types of thoughts to think about. Confused. I stack the wood meticulously.

I head back into the house without even knowing how I got there. Then it hit me. It’s the capital H they use. They is a she but to Him she is not a She. I focused on that little detail. I didn’t understand how such a tiny thing like that could impact her words so greatly. Maybe it’s a coincidence but I think She does it intentionally. I don’t know why She does it, I like to think that perhaps Her love for Him is what turned him into Him. I recently learned the term “love language”, maybe Hers is servitude or maybe it’s just some beautifully worded Reddit kink. Honestly, I don’t care to ever know why, it’s stays so pure without knowing. Her soft, sweet, sensual sentences staged spectacular sights seldom seen in my mind, as I rummaged the fridge for something manly to eat. Tonight’s rib-eye and half a dozen eggs sounds like a manly breakfast.

I really did want to come here and pump out some stupid sentences stated sarcastically subtle, but nope, instead all I did was make a mess in the kitchen and woke up the pooch. As for rules vs community. The rules keep communities safe, and Her safety is important to me. Because of that, I can’t be breaking rules and still expect to be a part of Her community.

I think I’ll turn my phone off for awhile and take the pooch for a long walk.

This story highlights how women have a hard time getting away from their husbands especially in the US deep South. Mrballen could probably even interview her himself if he wanted to. My brother was so stressed out and anxious while representing her. I wish she'd gotten off scot free. She lived a hard enough life under his abuse; she has already done her time and then some. It's a great story and stands to show why women don't leave and how we handle it when there is nowhere to go. This is especially important when you live in the South, which is about 100 years behind the rest of the US. I hope MrBallen considers telling her story. Do NOT flag me for doxxing.

My daughter is a full-time college student and also works a part-time job. She still lives at. Lately I’ve been wondering whether it’s reasonable to charge her rent (or some kind of monthly contribution), or if I should just let her keep saving while she’s in school.

A few details for context:

	•	She feeds herself. She buys most of her own food, but she also spends a good amount on outside meals and coffees (like takeout, café drinks, etc.).

	•	Her schedule is kind of split: she’s here about 4 days a week, and she spends 3 days (usually the weekend) at her partner’s house.

	•	She does buy herself things occasionally, but not constantly—mostly skincare and sometimes a top or bottoms here and there.

	•	She’s generally responsible and not partying or anything like that, but I also want her to learn budgeting and the real cost of living.

I’m torn because:

	•	Part of me thinks: if she’s working and living at home, even part-time, it’s fair to contribute something—utilities, groceries, “adult responsibility,” etc.

	•	The other part of me thinks: she’s in school full-time and trying to build her future, and I don’t want to make things harder if she’s already stretched thin.

So my questions are:

	1.	Is it reasonable to charge rent in this situation?

	2.	If yes, would you do a small flat rent, or more of a “contribute to household expenses” setup (utilities/groceries)?

	3.	If you charged rent, did you keep it, or save it and give it back later (like when they move out)?

I’d really appreciate advice from parents and also from people who were the “kid” in this situation. I want to set her up for success, not create resentment.",1,1770857948.0,AskParents,3,1.0,False

**Memory transcription subject: Vansi, Venlil Civilian**

*Date \[standardized human time\]: November 26th, 2136*

\---

I took in the scene before me. My daughter, arms stained orange with blood. A collar on her neck, marking her as property. Her fresh wounds being treated by dear Vilek. And towering over me, in the doorway, is the human.

That human. Martin. We had barely escaped with our lives, and here it was: Finally showing the real face of mankind.

Glaring down at me with all the intense focus of a predator, it exhales slowly and snarls out with forced calm. “Oh, hey Vansi. This isn’t a good time, Thiva’s feeling stressed an-Whoa!”

I was already lashing out with my claws, swiping toward its face. It took a step back, and I lunged past it. The blood was rushing in my ears as my heart pumped hard enough to hurt, and I grabbed my daughter’s wrist to drag her out and away.

She screamed as my claws dug into the freshly sealed cuts on her arms, the marks of the predator’s torture, but I pulled harder and forced her onto her feet.

We didn’t get more than halfway to the door before it caught us. My arm stuck in its iron grip, it squeezed down on my wrist until I was forced to let go of my daughter with a loud yowl of pain. She drew back from us at once, trying to get away from the predator who gave another deep commanding snarl. “Vansi, you’re hurting her! Calm down!”

I found myself screaming. “I’m hurting her?! You’re the one who-”

“MOM, SHUT UP!” Thiva roared, springing forward again. “Martin didn’t do anything wrong!”

I tried to understand how she could say that, despite the clear evidence… It wasn’t that there was no possible explanation, it’s that there were too many. Was there a literal predator mind-virus: Not a metaphor for the social contagion, but some sort of weaponized delusion they unleashed? Could their eyes really hypnotize people over time? Had Martin brought out and worsened the latent Predator Disease in my child?

Martin held my arm in his grasp, keeping me still. It was breathing heavily, holding back the urge for further violence. “Vilek, would you please close the front door? It appears that Thiva forgot to tell Vansi that I’m staying with you guys. Thiva… you’re still wearing the collar, Jesus Christ. Do you mind taking that thing off. It’s… cute and all but I think it’s freaking your mom out.”

As my child’s hands went up and unlatched the collar around her neck and set it down on the table, my heart ached. My poor darling thought she was cattle willingly. Whatever deception or weapon the human had used... I’d save her. My daughter’s friend walked around, giving the predator a wide berth as she moved to obey the command to shut off our escape path. It was clear to me that Vilek was under its spell too.

“I am going to let you go now. We’re all going to have a talk.”

 

I was allowed to sit down next to Thiva, holding an arm around her protectively. Vilek sat down on her other side, soothingly stroking my child as the human sat opposite us all.

Martin sat perfectly still and stared at the coffee table, pointedly not looking at any of us. I was actually grateful for the small act of mercy. “So, I’m currently living with Thiva and Vilek as my hosts for the refugee program. We had a personal disagreement, and Thiva acquired the collar… somewhere…”

“Online.” She helpfully squeaked out with a small amused twitch of her ears, like the entire situation’s funny.

It nodded. “Right, thank you. She acquired the collar online while in a distressed state, and ended up with a few self-inflicted scratches in the same state. She’s not currently in danger.”

I snarled, leaning forward. The human’s obvious lies weren’t something I wanted to bother with anymore. “Y-You expect me to believe that she got herself a cattle collar, and put it on herself, and then bled herself… and-and that means she’s not currently in danger?! She clearly isn’t safe with you!”

It faltered, its breath catching in its throat as it tried to think up some excuse. Vilek ended up speaking instead. “Vansi, you know these episodes are something that have happened to Thiva before…”

I had to admit that much. Thiva clearly had some form of Predator Disease, but I had kept her from being tested. Ever since she was a pup, she’d come to me with bruises and tears and complaining about Renak playing too rough. Every time I asked him, he of course said that it wasn’t true and she was doing it to herself to get him into trouble.

When I didn’t indulge her and instead called her out over lying about her brother, she escalated. The bruises would be accompanied by scrapes and cuts. I called her out over and over, punished her for lying, and said that if she didn’t stop I’d have to get her assessed and taken to a facility. Eventually she admitted she was doing it to herself.

I realized now that I should’ve sent her to a facility long ago, for her own good. But with the humans openly working to shut down our Predator Disease control programs, that path was rapidly closing.

 

I sighed. My daughter couldn’t be trusted, but Vilek was always level-headed before this. Even if she had been taken in by the humans’ lies… I knew the best path forward was to get Vilek on my side, or get the human caught in its fiction. “So what did she do wrong to cause it this time?”

Thiva stiffened and sobbed once, hurt apparent in her voice. “M-Mom, I…”

“Quiet, Thiva! …What did she do?”

The human looked up at me, now. Inspecting me carefully. Its voice was cold and filled with firm finality on the subject. “That’s a private matter between us. I… unintentionally exacerbated the issue, since I wasn’t aware of her history, but it’s nothing that we couldn’t resolve with a mature dialogue. In the future, I’ll know what to do to help her work through this sort of thing in a healthy way.” Its eyes flicked over to Vilek. “In fact, this is a perfect example of when the Federation’s ‘Predator Disease’ fixation is exactly the wrong solution.”

To my astonishment, Vilek responded to this insult to her own field of study by waving her tail in assent and looking at me encouragingly. “Yeah! Vansi, the humans have some amazing ideas about mental health, and I really think it can be a huge help to Thiva. She needs a supporting, loving environment.”

Vilek thought that living with a flesh-eating monster was a better, safer environment than living with me? Whatever the human had done to the girls was worse than I had thought. “I’m her mother. There’s no more supporting and loving environment than that. Thiva, you should come with me. Renak’s been saying the humans aren’t safe to be around.”

 

My daughter let out a high-pitched whimper. “Y-You’re still in contact with Renak?”

I nodded my ears. “Yes, he’s been saying he’ll take us to safety, away from the predators. Their infiltration was way faster than even he anticipated, or he’d have taken us away at once.”

Thiva squirmed at this, her eye moving between me and the human.

It spoke up again. “Vansi, your son is a danger to your daughter and everyone else.”

A wave of fury bubbled up from within me, and I found myself snarling. “Enough! I-I am done listening to your lies about my Renak, and about heroes like him! I am sorry that you predators are afraid of the Exterminators meant to keep us safe from your kind, but… But maybe you think about why you’re afraid of the people who hunt monsters instead of blaming it on them!”

The human bared its teeth briefly in an unmistakable threat display. “Vansi, you can stop pretending. Everyone here knows what your son is. He beats his sister, he’s fixated on fire, and he kills small animals and keeps trophies of them. Among humans, those are all signs of-”

I would not listen to more, not one more word! “Stop lying! My son is not a predator, and he is not a human! I know my son, Martin! I know what kind of man he is, and I will not sit here and listen to any more of your… your…”

“Mom, he’s not lyin-” Thiva’s confused whimpers were cut off with a gasp as I squeezed her arm firmly.

I could barely hear myself over the sound of my own heartbeat pumping in my ears. “Be QUIET! You’ve been filling the human’s head with lies about your brother, no wonder everything’s turned out the way it did! He-He wouldn’t have goaded me about Renak if you hadn’t told him to begin with, and none of this would have happened! I-I should never have let this get this bad, this is all your fault… I am going to have you assessed for Predator Disease, for your own good! A-And you’ll be safe in one of the facilities!”

Thiva and Vilek both looked at me, stunned. The human instead rose to his feet and snarled, enunciating each word carefully. Even in my rage I found myself quavering in silence under his barely restrained fury. “Thiva, you have nothing to worry about, you are not responsible, and you are not going to be taken anywhere you don’t want to go. Vansi, I am not going to let you threaten or hurt anyone in this household anymore. Your daughter is an adult, she is living with a student assessor who can assert that she’s displayed no signs of your fucking ‘Predator Disease’, and you don’t want any official scrutiny to fall on your son right now. Any further contact between you and Thiva is going to happen at her discretion, not yours. Now get out.”

I cast my eyes toward Thiva and Vilek. Both of them looked at me sadly. My confused daughter was the first to speak. “Mom, please… please leave.”

Vilek followed me to the door and said “Goodbye”, before closing it behind me.

I got halfway down the hallway before I slid down against the wall and screamed.

**Memory transcription subject: Martin Russo, Human Refugee**

*Date \[standardized human time\]: November 26th, 2136*

\---

Jesus Christ, I am so fucking tired.

\---

*Date \[standardized human time\]: November 27th, 2136*

\---

The first thing I do today is make a phone call.

“VRBPN Investigative Journalism Division, how may I help you?”

“Hi, my name is Martin Russo. I’m calling about an article that you published on, uhh… sorry, I’m a human, if I say November 20th 2136, does that translate?” I fumble once I get to the date. I hate fumbling my words. I should’ve had one of the girls tell me the local date ahead of time. Stupid.

The voice on the other side is professional, and rather bored. “Yes, sir.”

“Alright, thank you. The article ran under the headline of ‘An inferno of incredible horror’. It was about Exterminator misconduct in Greenmeadow, but it didn’t have a name attached. Can you tell me who wrote the article?”

The voice remains polite. She doesn’t sound like a Venlil, but definitely not a human either. Or a bird. Maybe a Gojid or Harchen or something, I don’t have enough experience with aliens to tell. May not even be female, though the translator voice is. “If a journalist chooses to publish anonymously, it is often due to there being a credible threat to their safety. The VRPBN will not reveal the identity of our journalists under any circumstances.”

I find myself rather glad; it’s a simple logic that makes sense. Someone who’ll protect their own against the Exterminators? That feels like a sign that this is the right track. “Yes, ma’am, I understand. Can you take a message for them? Leave them my contact information? I have some information that they might want to look at regarding their contact Thomas Sinclair, and the fire at the human refugee center in Greenmeadow.”

“Yes, sir, but I can’t guarantee that anyone will be getting back to you.”

“No, that’s fine, I understand.”

I go through the rigmarole of leaving my number and email with her. “Was there anything else, sir?”

“Yes, actually. I know an article like that must have been very controversial, and I would like to say for the record that… it was necessary, true, and well-written. I want to extend my thanks to the VRPBN and its investigative journalism division.”

She sounds surprised. “Oh, uh. Thank you sir, I’ll make sure that gets forwarded, too. Have a nice day.”

 

The second thing I do is call a town hall with the lambchops.

I can’t say I’ve been looking forward to this one, but the double whammy of Thiva’s meltdown and Vansi’s appearance meant there was a lot of ground I didn’t get a chance to cover. That’s the nature of triage.

They’re both sitting in front of me on the couch. Vilek is looking uncomfortable, and is sitting on an ice pack. Going into heat must be rough. I try to take that into account.

“I’m afraid we’re not quite done talking about yesterday, yet. Oh, don’t give me those faces.”

The two begin looking a bit distressed right away, but calm down with admirable swiftness. Vilek calms down faster than Thiva does, however. I make a note to be careful in my language, even more so than usual.

“Nobody’s in trouble. First of all, Thiva.” She perks an ear at me. “I’m going to ensure that we get you some qualified help. I’ve been… underestimating the extent of your problems, because you’re a strong and courageous and willful woman. Now just to clarify: Human mental health programs are nothing like your Federation facilities: They do not involve any involuntary confinement; mandatory drugs; or, God-help-me, electrical torture.”

*Not technically true, but Thiva’s case doesn’t appear bad enough to require any confinement. At least on Earth, the Feds’ idea of ‘behavioral therapy’ went out of fashion along with trepanning.*

She gives me a nod with her ears, and then with her whole head. I continue. “I would never subject you to anything like that. I promise. Still, getting you access to our mental health treatments might be a slow process simply because every human being in existence is traumatized, and our therapists are swamped. As a result, however, the human universities are taking applications from anyone who is interested…”

Vilek’s ears perk up and I nod at her. “Yeah, you mentioned you were interested. I think we have a real chance of transferring you over to a human school once the next semester starts in January. That’s around 45-50 paws away, give or take. I’ve looked into it, some schools are offering full-ride scholarships to alien assessors looking to jump ship.”

The lamb chops wag their tails. The easy part of the talk is over.

 

“Now, Vilek… What happened yesterday? I mean… I got an apology, but I never got a clear answer because we were all rather agitated. Why did you just… jump on me like that?”

Her ears immediately flatten down over her skull and she hunches over shamefully. “I-I, Um, th-that is…”

I hold up a hand. “Take a breath, please. We’re all calm; you’re not in trouble. Think, then answer. Was it a spur-of-the-moment thing, or was it planned? Does being on your cycle compromise your judgment?” I selfishly add the question that I feel particularly strongly about. “Was it about me as a person, or was I just a convenient male?”

I see her take a couple of deep, steadying breaths before she responds. “It… was planned. I am interested in you, and the cycle seemed like a… a good excuse. Lots of girls do it that way. I didn’t really plan to do it at that exact moment, but I did plan for it to happen at some point. And… yeah, being on your cycle is kind of like being tipsy. For the most part it just brings things that were already there up to the surface.”

Thiva throws Vilek a look for a split second. Vilek hunches down a little again under her friend’s gaze.

I clear my throat. “Alright, well… First of all. I’m going to repeat what we said yesterday: For humans, consent is very important. That means that we talk about these things beforehand, and we wait for an active ‘Yes’. You don’t want me to suddenly pin you to the couch, do you?”

Vilek flushes orange and beeps, clutching her tail to stop it from wagging while squirming in place. Even Thiva whistles out a giggle of amusement at her friend’s reaction. Well then.

I try not to be wrong-footed. “…Okay. But you should still have asked me ahead of time, talked to me, and gotten approval. But that’s the second thing… Let’s say Thiva wasn’t at home, and I hadn’t stopped you.”

She squirms and beeps again. I continue. “What would’ve happened if, after your cycle was over, you decided that it was too weird to still live with me? For that matter, Thiva… If we were to start dating, and it doesn’t work out… what happens to me?”

Vilek pipes up right away. “W-We’d never throw you out just for that!”

Thiva nods immediately and speaks up too. “Yes, even if – if it didn’t work out… it would be awkward, but we would be able to be adults, right? Lots of people are still friends with their exes? Like, you’ll be free to stay as long as you need to, no matter what!”

*Would you still say that if you knew what I am?*

I take a breath. “Yes, but even with my safety taken into account… Would you girls still talk to me? Hang out? Play games? Consent to being touched? Thiva, Vilek… since the shelter fire, you two are all that I have. You are my only friends in the entire galaxy. The risk of a relationship not working out is… Putting it the way the Venlil would, you are my herd. Even if you’d let me stay here, if-if you were to reject me from that herd… I’d have nothing.” My voice starts to quiver toward the end.

Thiva leaps up from the couch and lunges at me in a tight embrace. Vilek whines piteously on her ice pack before slowly getting up to do the same, trembling the whole time. I’m acutely aware of how short a time I’ve known them. I’m acutely aware of how little I deserve to know them.

*You almost murdered someone yesterday, and now you’re whining about how much you need these girls in your life. You’re pathetic.*

*But maybe you can be less pathetic today than you were yesterday. And maybe you can be less pathetic tomorrow than you are today.*

Keep in mind i was walking where you have  access to a lot lot of accommodations, cafés, water, electricity... This would change i you go in a secluded place.

In 2024 i walked the Camino de Santiago from Le-Puy-En-Velay in France to Santiago de Compostella in Spain then some other places. Roughly 800km in France and 800km in Spain.

Did that in 64 days with two full days off, so 1600/62 = 25,8km (16mi) per day at an average.

This is an average, my lowest was 11km (6,8mi) in one day (got super drunk the night before, couldnt walk more) and my highest was 53km (33mi), in the blazing sun of Spain in summer, i was shaking at the end.

Look what i had when i started, what i changed, and what i would do different.

When i started to walk, my backpack was 7.5kg (15.4lbs) without water or food.

Backpack was a **Deuter Aicontact Lite 40L+5L** : just loved it and continue to love it (though i think i could do it again with a 30L pack).  
Then 99% of the rest of the gear was from Decathlon.

My pack had :

**- One pair of pants that you can turn into shorts with a zipper = 40€**

definitely recommend them, even in huge rain and during snow i was walking in shorts mode. But being able to put the long pants on at night when camping or in an albergue (kind of a hostel for pilgrims) is priceless. Having only one pair of pants though, means i had to walk around in my underwear in the hostel when it was in the washing machine lol.

**- 3 t shirts in merino wool =** 35€ each. I fell for the marketing. Yes its true they smell way less than regular shirts. But for the price and the fact they started to get holes where the backpack shoulder straps were rubbing, i would not get them again.  
Regular cheap shirts will be good. On the camino you get water and accomodations every 2h of walking or even less. I could wash my shirts and underwear by hand in a sink every day or two. Putting them back on at 6am still wet is not pleasant but gives you energy and they dry fast. Though, i wont bother will expensive shirts now.

**- 3 underwear and 3 pairs of socks :** regular cheap ones from Lidl or Aldi

\- **An ultralight Decathlon tent (1.2kg) :** Ended up shipping it back home. I planned on wild camping on the way, but out of the 2 months of walking, my first month in France, i just rained everyday and even snowed (during May yes !). I said ""1.2kg for a ""if only"" choice for the tent is too much to carry"". And i sent it back. Because you dont need a tent on the camino. More on that later.

\- **My kitchen pot + gas burner + gas can** = 500g (1.1lbs). It's a toaks titanium pot (35€) + BRS 3000T burner (10€ and only 26g) and a decathlon small gas canister (4€).

Everything including a small sponge and a lighter fits inside the Toaks pot, its super convenient. I only used the thing on the way to make some coffee. And quickly realized you have a lot of of small shops and restaurants. So i ended up shipping it back home. But that combo it top notch for the money and i still use it to this day (although a friend sat on the toaks cup during a drunken night, but i managed to bend it back to pretty good shape).

\- **At first had just two one liter bottles**, but someone on the way gifted me a 1L water bladder. I loved the system so much, i bought a 3L one on the way and gave the 1L to someone else i met. You have to clean those often but they are so much more practical.

\- **Regular decathlon trail inflatable mattress** (45€) : this one i kept all the way and served me many times when albergues didnt have free beds, i just slept on the floor with that thing.  
I also used it to sleep in churches and small chapels left open for pilgrim to sleep in. It was great.

\- **Regular 10° sleeping bag** (30€) : Was enough for the albergues, though i had cold nights sleeping on the hard rock grounds of churches. Though i felt cold only on my back so i think an insulated mattress would be a better future investment than another sleeping bag.

\- **Toiletries :** A tiny towel and aleppo soap that i used to brush my teeth (yes yes you can read on it), wash my clothes, and wash my hairs and body.

\- **Regular things :** Charging cable, charger, phone, a headlamp, a pen, a notebook, swiss army knife, a light cup to drink from water fountains (and also during the camino you walk towards a free and unlimited WINE fountain), some bandaids...

\- **Shoes :** I got the Salomon Saliba (119€), one pair did me 1000km and i bought another in a store for the 600km remaining. And i still use that second pair today. Love those.

\----------------------------------------------------  
**What did i send back :**

\- As i said, i shipped back my tent and cooking kit during the way because i didnt feel i needed those on a way that had that much accommodation and services. But i think its the same with places with less.

**What i got during the way :**

\- I asked from close people to send me : a short pair of pants to live in the hostels when my regular pair of pants was in the washing machine, so i didnt have to walk in my underwear.

\- A nice light shirt for those evening where you eat with all the pilgrims and want to wear something else than one of your hiking shirts you've been wearing for 1 month.

\- With friends i made along the way we each bought a hammock and used them to sleep in a remote forest in Spain one night.

**What i would do differently ?**

No marketing things, no special fabrics shirts of backpacks. They just want your money for less than useful features.

No tent. On a way like that i enjoyed way too much finding an opened church to sleep in, or if its closed, just the church porch. I even did a nap in a cemetery next to some tombs. At least your neighbors wont disturb you and i enjoyed putting back up all flower pots that got knocked out from the wind on the tombs, just to thank my hosts for welcoming me for my nap.

No phone. I mean no smartphone. I recently sold my smartphone anyway, because fuck GAFAM and social medias. Having a super powerful computer in your hand ruins the experience. You can check where is the next store, or the next hostel etc.... i dont like that. I like asking people and see where it takes me.

**Moral of the story** : **YOU DONT NEED SHIT !**

no powerbank, no high end garmin gps watch or some shit, so super good marketed fabric technologies, no ultralight gears....

The only things you need to put some money on are some shoes and backpack. And even those you can find one that fits your needs for not much. I paid 140€ for my backpack new but you can find it for 100€ on sale or used. I also now buy shoes used.

Of course if you're going hiking in the mountains alone for 3 weeks this post might not be the most suitable for you (altought you wouldnt have to change much), but for pure backpacking, hitchiking etc... i still use all of that and it works great.

Do not hesitate to comment or send me a DM if you have some questions on the post or on the Camino de Santiago !

I will finish this post by saying that walking the Camino was the absolute best experience of my entire life and that if you're able to do it in one go or in small parts : absolutely do it !!!",0,1770857500.0,backpacking,1,0.33,False

1r2f5l5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Louisiana/comments/1r2f5l5/in_1937_louisiana_carried_out_the_last_execution/,"In 1937, Louisiana carried out the last execution for attempted murder in the United States. Tommie Howard shot a man, whom he laid in wait for, in the shotgun in the head during a robbery. The victim was left permanently incapacitated and died from his injuries nine months after Howard's execution.","[An article about the victim](https://imgur.com/a/ewDLgfF)

The victim was Dan L. Perkins, 45, a prominent Shreveport geologist and oilman. After the Great War, Perkins came to Shreveport and began his geological work. His activities extended to the Homer field and later to Rodessa. He worked out the geology on the Rodessa area for R. W. Norton who later brought in the first Rodessa gas well in August, 1930. The discovery of gas later led to the discovery of oil in July, 1935, and subsequent development of the field into the fourth largest oil producing area in the United States. Perkins had extensive interests in the field.

On August 10, 1936, Perkins was walking to his garage in his car when he was shot in the head by 38-year-old Tommie Howard, an ex-convict who'd previously served 10 years in prison for second degree murder. Howard laid in wait for Perkins, then shot him in the head. After being in a critical condition for several weeks, Perkins improved to an extent that he was able to go about but was never well. Howard was arrested and later confessed the shooting. He was employed as a yard neighbor boy a neighbor of the Perkins family. Howard said he wanted to kill Perkins because he knew that if he robbed him and did not kill him, Perkins could later identify him.

Perkins did not testify at the trial and went traveling in Cuba. Howard was tried for lying in wait with intent to commit murder, found guilty, and sentenced to death.

[An article about the execution](https://imgur.com/a/BE5cjFY)

Tommie Howard, 38, was executed by hanging at the Caddo Parish Jail on January 15, 1937. He was the first person to be executed for attempted murder in the United States since 1882. His last meal consisted of scrambled eggs, biscuits, and coffee. His last words were, ""Have faith in the Lord."" Howard also released a written statement to the public.

>""I am gone, so I wish you all well. I am praying every day to make heaven my home. You all pray for me. So all you all don't forget your God. He will take care of you.""

In the months after Howard's execution. Perkins's condition worsened. Operations to improve his condition were futile and his health eventually became critical. On April 13, his mother brought him to Barnes hospital, where several operations were made to save his life. The efforts proved unsuccessful. Perkins died at Barnes hospital in St. Louis, Missouri on September 7, 1937.",3,1770857245.0,Louisiana,1,1.0,False
1r2f4oi,https://www.reddit.com/r/stdtesting/comments/1r2f4oi/has_anyone_else_had_these_symptoms_story_inside/,Has anyone else had these symptoms? Story inside.,"If it's not a STI, what could be?

September 28th 2025 I had unprotected oral and vaginal sex with a woman. She said she had a negative test 2 months ago and no partners. 

Before we had sex, I noticed some white stuff on her vagina. It was flakey and not liquidity. After we had sex, I didnt shower or piss after.

I started having symptoms of discharge 2 days after sex, October 1st 2025. The discharge started out minimal, but througout the day it got worse. The discharge was clear and frequent throughout the day. 
The discharge was worse in the morning, being white in the morning instead of clear during the day, so I decided to get a 10 panel STD test with the addition of Mycoplasma, October 2nd 2025. This test consisted of 

Chlamydia & Gonorrhea
Hepatitis A
Hepatitis B
Hepatitis C
Herpes I
Herpes II
HIV 1 & 2 Antibody (4th Gen)
Mycoplasma genitalium, NAA, Urine
Syphilis

They all came out negative, and I know it was too early to test, but I was having symptoms,  so I needed to be tested. 

October 4th 2025 I decided to get another test that included gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomonas, plus a seperete oral test of GC/CHLAMYDIA, PHARYNGEAL
Which were negative as well. 

October 8th 2025, since I was still having discharge, I told the doctor my story and he prescribed me a 7 day course of doxycycline. After treatment, the discharge went away.

After the discharge went away October 15th 2025,  I decided to wait to make sure to test again. during this waiting period,  I can't remember if all symptoms subsided. 

October 23rd 2025, I had uprotected anal sex. I am positive this individual did not have any STIs or infections.

5 weeks later, (November 3rd 2025) I took the same 10 panel test, with the exception of Mycoplasma genitalium, NAA, Urine.

In total the test were,

Chlamydia & Gonorrhea
Hepatitis A
Hepatitis B
Hepatitis C
Herpes I
Herpes II
HIV 1 & 2 Antibody (4th Gen)
Syphilis

All of these test came out negative 5 weeks after exposure.

December 5th 2025 I started to feel irritation.  Like something was blocked or not right in my urethra.

December 9th 2025, I had unprotected vaginal sex. I am sure this individual did not have any STIs or infections.

December 17th 2025, I decided to get a Mycoplasma test. It was negative,  but still have some uncomfortabness in my urethra. 

December 28th 2025 through January 8th 2026, I've been having some slight discharge. And irritation at the tip/head.

Jan 9th 2026 I went in for a ureplasma test. 

January 17th 2026, I'm still having uncomfortabness.  I woke up and notice the tip of my penis seemed glued together in the middle and had to pull it apart gently 

January 18th, I received my Ureaplasma results back. They're negative. 

January 29th 2926,
I'm still feelight uncomfortabness,  but I have been drinking coffee and alchol, but I have been drinking less and drinkng more water. I have been touching myself every other day as well.

February 2nd 2026,I started not touching or pulling myself for 2 weeks. I have been drimking alchol and coffee, but I try to hydrate when I do

February 6th 2026, irritations in middle of urethra and testicles felt weird when driving for an hour. 
When got home, the meatus of my penis was stuck togeher 

February 8th 2026, woke up, with some light staining in my underwear in the morning, and the same irritation in urethea.
I assume that I dont have this during the day, but during the day my underwear is moist, but no evidence of discharge stains or wet stains in underwear 

February 11th 2026, I masturbated abd noticed my semen was very yellow.

My post MBA plans will be either product or strategy in the short term, while pursuing entrepreneurship in the long run. 

After some negotiations, both are full rides (tuition wise) or very little out of pocket tuition costs. COL is similar in both places, so not a huge difference. 

I have had a lot of coffee chats but I am really struggling to pick one given how I feel about each school.

**Memory Transcript Subject: Kyonif. Princess Of No Dynasty**

**Date Standardised Human Time: 2136**

Okay. Okay… I am alone with Brenan, and he is bringing me to show off the luxury of his park. A predator park. Where Brenan determines what happens inside. Oh Celestials, what would even be here in the park? Definitely hunting, right? Focus! Determine your position, and see if Brenan would want me.

*No one truly wants you.*

My attention was caught by the large wooden sign with a depiction of a fish breaching the water and reading Santee State Park. I swallowed hard, partly regretting coming here. Not from fear, as I know Brenan would keep me safe, but from what I might see. 

“Here we are. One of the most beautiful parks in S.C.”

It really was a beautiful sight. Lush trees, blue water, reddish dirt, and already more birds and small prey than I have ever seen in my life! I think my favorite one so far was this little grey thing with a ringed tail that looked like it wore an action hero mask. I took a picture of it with my camera.

Brenan drove up to a small brown building that was smaller than the cabin of his truck, and inside was a thin, black-haired woman that had… multiple metal piercings on her nose and lips. She wore a light blue shirt with a state park patch and tan shorts. Her skin was exceptionally pale, and her lips were purple. She didn't look at us as she was typing away at her personal pad, chewing on something. “Today is a free day at the park; have a safe day and remember your life vest, and watch for alligators if you go swimming.”

“Good afternoon, Abigail.” Brenan barked, causing the woman to jump up and drop her phone.

“That's a write-up you know.” Brenan barked.

“What are you gonna do? Fire-” She looked up, and her black eyes locked onto me and went wide.

“No. Way. You brought an alien?!”

“Yep.”

“G-greetings.” I said with as much confidence as I could.

“I'm Abigail! Can I take a pic!”

“Y-yes.”

“Nice!” She pointed her pad's camera at me, “Move your head, boss.” Brenan leaned his seat back, and I attempted to be in the most elegant pose I could manage. After the shutter, the girl smiled and leaned back in her chair. “Hell yeah!”

Brenan leaned back up, “Just make sure to not get any complaints. And wear your hat.” 

“Yeah, yeah.” The girl said as she now placed a tan, wide-brimmed hat on her head. “Can't believe an alien is actually here.”

Brenan then drove on to a near-empty parking lot. “She seems…”

“Moody?” 

“Yes. Is that allowed? To not take your job seriously?”

“She does. I am just lax about it. She's just a teen anyway. As for it being allowed? Officially, no. I'll probably make her clean the park signs when I get back to work.”

“I see.”

See Dotrix. He *is* very lenient. I chirruped to myself.

“What you laughin’ about.”

“Oh, nothing.”

He parked, and we did the same routine of getting out and unfolding my chair. Well, my *new* chair that *I* can control. On my own. Wherever I want to go. Brenan placed me gently on my seat, and we immediately made our way to the water. 

The heat was far more bearable here. The breeze, the shade, and just the sight of the water easily brought the temperature down. “So this is your park?” I asked.

Brenan chuckled in response, “Not mine, but I determine a lot of things that go on here, and I occasionally go to other parks to help out or for meetings.”

“Sounds like a very important job.”

“I like to think it is.”

“Surely it is. You maintain the beauty and keep humans happy. And you are in charge of others.”

“I guess you are right.” 

I flicked my ears in victory. I just need to keep saucing him before I ask the question.

We were now heading to a dock that stretched far beyond the shore. The wood creaked under my wheels as we pushed on, and the breeze intensified, cooling me even more. Sun rays sparkled and danced over the ethereal blues and greens of the calm water. We were now near the edge of the dock, and in the water were large fish. Just swimming around near the surface. I took the opportunity to take a picture.

“It is all very lovely,” I said, ""and you take care of everything here?”

“I try too.”

“Are there any other sights? I would love to see the rest of your work.”

“Sure. How about we go to my favorite spot?”

“What is to be expected there?”

“A beautiful view that I have prepared and cared for almost entirely by myself.”

Again, the shiver of fear of the idea that I would witness something potentially predatory entered my mind… but I trust Brenan. And I may as well embrace everything in the human way. I just hope he doesn't offer me flesh. I don't think I could eat that currently…

*Currently? No wonder they found you diseased.*

We moved alongside each other on the trail. I was pushing myself on the surprisingly well-kept, and flat path. Are all human trails this easy to traverse? Federation trails are often paved and not dirt.

We continued along the trail, passing bushes, lush trees, and scurrying creatures that resembled Dossur, and I took every picture that I could. “This is very relaxing.”

Brenan hummed as a response and had his calm smile. I think he was enjoying it as much as me, despite me stopping every few ears to take a picture or stretch my increasingly sore arms. Without even thinking, I tugged on his shirt to get him to push me. He happily obliged.

Then, we arrived at where Brenan had wanted. The trail began to wind through several bushes with many, many colorful flowers, whose petals formed perfect balls, lined the pathway. Each one was vibrant, beautiful, and cared for. I took a photo of them.

“Like the snowballs?”

“Snowballs? You mean the flowers?”

Brenan smiled, “They are Viburnums. Probably the most popular plant in the entire state.”

“Really?” 

“Easy to grow, low maintenance, and beautiful. Churches, schools, homes, and golf courses. They are everywhere.”

“I see. Is this what you wanted to show me?”

“Yes. I take it upon myself to keep this trail exceptionally maintained. I am very proud of it. And, probably, the best-smelling spot in the park.”

I sniffed the air, and I think he was right. There was a spicy scent in the air that reminded me of Mama and Yonifer's perfume. “Do they grow naturally here? Or were they imported?”

“They were imported. Came from China, Korea, some places in Europe, and Japan. They gained popularity here around five hundred years ago. Then exploded during Antebellum.”

“Antebellum?”

“It was a period that covered pre- and post-civil war. A *Greek Rival* period.”

“Predator rivalry? Sounds both fascinating and scary. And you mentioned a civil war?”

Brenan chuckled. “Well, the Greek period that Antebellum was rivaling was already gone for almost one and a half thousand years. But it is often regarded as one of the most beautiful times in human history. Many cultures wanted to copy that. As for the Civil War, it was a war fought for many perceived aggressions but ultimately culminated over slavery and preservation of the nation as the two largest and defining reasons.”

Ah. Slavery. Such a barbaric practice. But, understandable for a predatory race. And, well, I must be lucky, as Brenan didn't take me as one. Especially if the institution was valuable enough to wage war about it. “Speaking of slavery, I haven't seen any. Why is that?”

“Ha! There aren't any. Slavery is abolished and punishable with death now because of the war.”

“What?!”

Brenan ruffled my head fur, and I batted away his paws. “You are just too cute, you know that?”

“I am always cute.” I pouted.

Brenan let out a warm hum. “Humans made many mistakes. And unfortunately, human mistakes are corrected through violence more often than words. We had slaves. Now there are no slaves.”

“I see. And I assume your clan fought in this war?” 

“Yeah. There wasn't a family in America that didn't fight. Mine fought on both sides.”

“Really?”

“Yep. The Trappers, Hunds, Seaburgers, McClukin's and so on.”

“You are related to so many Dynasties. Your lineage must be a large one.” 

“I guess it is.”

“Is that why you look so different from Grandma Hund and Amber?”

“Could be.” He simply answered.

I wondered about what exactly Brenan's status was. Work family? Dynasty coalition? He is not the most powerful Dynasty if he is working for the park but still high up to have such a property. Hmm….

We continued to walk through the tenderly cared for trail. “Brenan, can you tell me about Dorothy? I thought she was a plebeian at first, but she seems very close with you and yours.”

“She certainly is a character. She was Grandma's best friend growing up. They did everything together but… She has a few screws loose. Claims she was abducted by grey aliens, and they took her teeth.”

“Do you believe her?”

“Nah. Like I said, she is a nut job, and Grandma doesn't talk about her past. So, she is basically my crazy Aunt.”

“I see. Then I apologize for calling her a plebeian.”

“Thank you. Best to refrain from that language. It can really offend people.”

“Oh. Then I apologize once more.”

“Thank you… But feel free to call her a nut.” He said with a laugh.

“Another question. What did you whisper to her in the restaurant?”

Brenan chuckled, “I told that crazy lady that Venlil are usually grey with dark eyes.”

“Stop! You didn't!”

“Ha! Yeah. She didn't believe me, but… the seed has been planted.” He said with a smirk.

“Sir Brenan, I would appreciate it if you didn't encourage *nuts* to harass my maid and friend.”

“Oh, don't worry. It won't be me.”

I hit him in the thigh, and he just laughed. Ha… predators.

We then both arrived at the base of a small hill. At the top of the hill sat a large tree with a twisted trunk, thick branches pointed downward, and long, deep green leaves that resembled vines. “I don't believe I have ever seen a tree where the branches grow downward.”

“It's a Willow tree. Specifically a weeping willow.” 

“A weeping willow? Why is it called that?”

Brenan and I were now atop the small hill, and we passed through the long and numerous vine leaves that protected the conifer like a curtain. I was able to rest my paw on the trunk.” 

“It's called that because the branches hang low and downward. It is a willow tree that has a specific mutation.”

“I see. But naming it weeping seems so depressing.”

“Well, that is also because of the folklore about it.”

“Oh? A story for this tree? We have stories for trees on Ittel. I would love to indulge you, but I am far more curious about this tree.”

Brenan smiled and sat on the hill with his back against the tree; I decided to join beside him and rest on his shoulder for support.

“There are hundreds of stories about these trees, but they all have the same element. My personal favorite is this one,.” He cleared his throat. “There were two lovers that would meet under the willows. They ate, drank, sang, and loved. The man was a brave warrior, who fought all his enemies, the enemies of his maid. The woman was a maid, who tended the fires of the camp, danced for the warrior, and sewed together the man's armor. The two were inseparable, but the man made many enemies. His strength and bravery that once protected the maid now put her in danger, and soon an arrow had ripped through his lung.”

I gasped at the story. Leaning in closer to hear the tale.

“The man had retreated to the willow and fell. The maid found him, but he had already passed. She began to weep, unable to leave his body. Now, the enemies of the man wished to find his body and desecrate it. The woman, desperate to protect her Brave, pulled down the branches of the willow and sewed the leaves and branches into new armor. This hid them both from their enemies, and the woman soon passed alongside her brave. The spirits moved by her took her tears as seeds and began to grow more of these trees to protect lovers.”

“That… is morbidly romantic.”

“Well. A lot of our stories are. Especially older ones.”

“Why is that?” I asked. Brenan shrugged. “Great answer.” I said as I hit his chest…

We then went silent for a while. Enjoying the cool shade that was offered to us by the tree. I wonder if this is how the two felt under the tree…

My mind instantly remembered Dotrix’s words and my mission. Heat instantly grew on my face. I was certainly blooming now. “Something wrong?” Brenan asked as I turned my face to hide from him.

“S-Speaking of lovers, why don't you have any? Certainly a human such as you would have at least one.”

“Ha! Now you sound like Grandma.” He adjusted himself to be more comfortable. “Well, truth is I don't.”

“Really?”

“Yeah…”

“Why not?”

“I work too much. And I am already a father. I just don't have time. Plus, having a kid already pushes away a lot of women.”

I was confused by his explanation. “Why would being busy affect that? A mate is only expected to hold to their duties in marriage.”

He raised an eyebrow. “Well, we have to get to know each other first. See if we are on the same page. Fall in love. That sort of thing.”

“Why wouldn't you be on the same page? You are of the same culture, right? And why fall in love before? Just do that after. And, well, if you don't have the time to meet someone, can't you just pay the Patriarch or Matriarch of a Dynasty to give you one?” This is all very silly.

“Well, sometimes I wish it was that simple. But, we aren't all that homogeneous. Falling in love is a vital part of human relationships, and well, purchasing a bride has been out of style for, like, a thousand years now.”

“I… I see. And, exactly how long does this process take?”

“Six months to a year. Usually. Sometimes longer.

“S-Six months?!” I shouted, causing some birds I didn't notice to flee.

“Guess that's not normal for you huh?”

“N-no but. Well… Haaa….” I smoothed my ears back with my paws, “I should just accept that you humans are just nothing like I expected.”

“You got that right.” He chuckled, I sank more into his shoulder. “That sounds so time-consuming.”

“I guess it is.” He leaned forward a small bit and began to rub at his knee. I had to adjust myself.

“Feeling sore? You did walk a lot already.”

“Just a bit. I have this weird pinching feeling in my knee.” 

“I see. Well, I don't think you could have picked a better place to rest than here.”

“I suppose not.” He said as he finished rubbing his leg. He then leaned fully back on the tree, adjusted his arm, and began to scratch at the back of my head. It felt so nice that I melted into the divine touch. By the Celestials this feeling… How has he not found a mate by this alone? My tail wagged with intensity, and if my legs worked, I bet they would be stamping the ground like when Papa scratches Mama's or Lady Yonifer's chins.

He closed his eyes, and soon heavy breathing escaped him, and then his heavy growls soon followed. He must have been really tired.

I will let him sleep, and I contemplated my position. So… Humans need to know each other first. Like a smaller Dynasty game. A small hiccup to the plan but not a difficult one.

I let out a heavy sigh and sank further into Brenan's shoulder. How exactly will I convince him to have me as a mate? I closed my eyes, and I too began to sleep.

**\[Advancing Memory Transcript 2 Solar Hours\]**

By the Celestials, that was the most relaxing sleep I have had in so long! The shade, breeze, and view were perfect. And, by the time we awoke, the sun was close to setting.

I rolled into the home of the Hunds and was greeted by a lively sight. Princess Amber was pouting in the living room, wearing her pajamas while Grandma Hund was wagging her finger at her. Dotrix looked as stressed as ever as she watched on.

“I don't wanna go to bed!” The tiny human stopped her foot. 

“You will go to bed! It's almost bedtime and you haven't even brushed!” Grandma Hund responded.

I couldn't help but chirrup. This reminded me all too much about Yonifer chastising my youngest siblings. 

My laughter turned the attention to me, and the mundane tension of children vanished in the air. The Matriarch was the first to speak, “Welcome home, Kyonif. Boy.”

“Hello to you too Grandma.” Brenan responded.

“Good afternoon, Matriarch Hund. As well as Dotrix and little Amber.”

Amber dove onto my lap and nearly knocked my chair over if it wasn't for Brenan bracing me. “I want to stay up with the princesses! And she wants me to too!”

She buried her face into my chest and squeezed her little arms around me as tight as she could. I chirruped some more and began to stroke her hair.

“Rug rat, you gotta go to bed soon.” Her adopted father added gently.

She glowered at him, resulting in the patriarch crossing his arms, puffing up his chest, and giving a stern look that made her rethink any naughty idea she had. Stars, it worked on me too, and I didn't even do anything! 

I cleared my throat, “Amber, how about I help brush you and we go to sleep?” 

Her emerald eyes grew and sparkled like a thousand stars. “Really?! I can stay in your room tonight?!” 

I looked to her father for approval, and he nodded his head. “Always, sweet pea.” She squealed a bit before sliding off and running down the hall.

“I will prepare our room then, Dotrix stated as she too, disappeared down the hall.”

“Goodnight dears.” The matriarch spoke.

“Night bun.” Brenan added.

I flicked my ears in a warm goodnight and wheeled in the direction of the *rug rat* as Brenan had called her. She was standing on a little plastic stool so she could comfortably reach the back of her sink. This restroom was not the same as the one Dotrix and I will be using but it is similar enough. I wheeled next to her and reached for a hair comb. 

She raised an eyebrow at me, “What are you doing? I already brushed my hair.”

“But Matriarch Hund said you need to brush.”

“My teeth, silly.” She giggled as she reached for a silver canister, opened it, and pulled out a pink plastic stick with bristles on one end. A human princess with golden hair and a pink dress was depicted on it. 

“What is that for?” I asked.

“It's to clean teeth!” She declared. 

Oh? Do predators need to do this? She then produced this sweet smelling paste and put it on her brush, and began to brush after running it under some water.

I watched as she cleaned her teeth. The paste became foamy white and was beginning to spill from her mouth. Stars, she looked like a newborn pup trying to eat. I chirruped again.

She then looked at me, “Ahre hew goin’  ta brushh?” 

“Oh, I don't have a brush.”

Her eyebrow raised even higher. “No.”

“No?” 

She spat the paste out, ""Brenan said that all princesses have to brush.” She then hopped down from her plastic stool and opened a cabinet under the sink, pulled out another brush wrapped in plastic, opened it, put paste on it, then handed it to me. “This is so you don't have stinky breath and cavities.” she said with her little chest puffed out to mimic authority. I think she was trying to mimic Brenan's posture. So cute how she tries to imitate him.

I took the brush from her and began to mimic the circular motions that she was doing. She watched me closely to make sure I was brushing correctly. Perhaps her father does the same for her?

After a couple of wicks, or minutes, we both spat out the paste and rinsed with a tart mouth wash. 

“Much better.” She said, “Don't you feel much prettier?” 

I breathed onto my paw and sniffed. My breath certainly smelled minty. Usually we chewed on flavored bark or perfume-scented tubers, but I liked this as well. My teeth certainly looked more pearly. I wonder if humans find white teeth to be more attractive?

We then made our way back to my room. As we walked down the hall, I overheard something that Brenan was whispering to Grandma Hund. “It keeps hurting since my last match.” 

He was sitting on the couch as his other leg was lifted on the coffee table. Grandma Hund was bent over it and prodding it. “Feels normal. Just schedule-”

“Come on Kyonif! I wanna watch a movie with you!” The rugrat was tugging on my sleeve, and so I followed her. 

In my room, Dotrix was already prepared for bed. She was now wearing pink pajamas. They were a onesie and they fit her form exceptionally well, and there was a flap on her rump that allowed her tail to slip out of. “Welcome back. Grandma Hund gave us pajamas to sleep in.”

“You look too cute in those Dotrix!” I shouted, and Amber was giggling. 

“Thank you.” I slid from my chair and crawled over to my bed and retrieved my own pajamas. A top and a bottom. “Dotrix, can you assist me?”

“Always, mistress Kyonif.”

Her and Amber helped me change into the new clothes. A seafoam green color with red trim, white buttons on the chest, and fluff around the wrists and ankles. I felt very regal in them.

“You look quite lovely.” My maid spoke.

“Let’s watch a movie!” The little girl shouted with glee. 

I ruffled her hair, “In just a moment, sweet root. I need to talk to Dotrix.” 

She huffed in response. Ah, a little predator's temperament. How adorable. “I am going to get my coloring books then.” She said with an upturned snout and crossed arms. 

“May I color with you when you return?”

Her pout broke, “You may.” she responded with a haughtiness that could have easily been mistaken for a spoilt Nevok princess.

“Hurry along now, Sweet Root. We don't know how long your father will allow us to be awake.”

With a small gasp, she hurried out of the room, and my attention turned to Dotrix. She looked pretty giddy and was waiting to hear my report.

“Well?” She asked, “How did Sir Brenan react?” 

“Well… I didn't *really* spring the question.” Her ears flopped, and she looked a bit disappointed.

“Oh? Got cold hooves?”

“N-no. It's just, I learned some more information before I could ask.”

“Like what?”

“Like how humans have to engage in friendship to learn about each other before courtship.”

“Sir Brenan said that?”

“Essentially. Humans don't just get married. They have to spend time figuring it out, and if they truly want it.”

“That doesn't sound too bad. Many Federation species are like that.”

“Wait, they are?” I said with surprise. 

“Uh… yeah? Kyonif, did you really not know?” I bloomed at the realization. Dotrix just laughed.

“I-I mean, that's how it is on Ittel and all the movies usually end with marriage…”

 “Oh Stars, Kyonif. You really are such a sheltered girl.”

“I am not.” I pouted.

“Well, how about we start some research? Figure out human courtship?”

“Let’s.”

Dotrix jumped on the bed next to me and pulled up her pad. “How… to… attract… human… males…”

“I'm back!”

Dotrix and I both jumped and let out surprised squeaks. Amber responded by calling me silly and giggling. She then climbed between Dotrix and me and opened her coloring book. 

Eagerly, she opened the pages and landed on a blank page with an outline of a small human girl with a very round nose and a weird, Farsul, Sivkit, alien thing. 

“Brenan must really love you if he bought you such an expensive gift.” Dotrix said. 

“He always loves me.” she simply said as she grabbed a blue-colored stick and started scribbling in the alien. Then she paused and looked up. “Expensive?”

Ah! She doesn't know how wealthy she is! “Art supplies are very expensive. So expensive that most of the galaxy can't get proper supplies, much less for kids. It can take months for commoners to buy low-quality art supplies, let alone be able to sell them.”

She looked reverently at the blue stick in her hands and began to be more tentative with it. Dotrix and I share glances with each other and force ourselves to not laugh. 

Then, with a light knock on the door, Brenan's voice spoke. “Can I come in?” He asked. 

“Of course you may.” I answered.

He opened the door and walked in, “Hey girls. Just checking on you before I head to bed. Just letting you know that Amber can stay up late. No school tomorrow.” Amber kicked her feet with some excitement. 

“No school?”

“I took her out of classes for today and tomorrow so she could spend time with you.” I smiled in a human way. She really is just so cute. “Anyway, got an email a bit ago. Y'all got a doctor's appointment tomorrow.”

I flicked my ears in suspicion. “Why? I feel fine, and I assure you that I feel fine.”

He shrugged his shoulders, “Guess the U.N. just wants to check on you. Make sure all our guests are holding up well. Just because we are immune to each other's germs, however that works, don't mean y'all are immune mentally and physically.”

“I see. Well, I suppose I should thank them for their concerns.” 

Brenan smiled, “Night girls.” He then closed the door and disappeared. 

**\[Advancing Memory Transcript Subject 30 solar minutes\]**

Dotrix, Amber, and I would soon settle into our own beds. With a movie playing on the holo screen. This one was about a young woman being taken care of by many, many short men. Very noble if you ask me. 

I was lying on my side with Amber, who was snuggled tight in my embrace as we watched the movie and fell asleep. Dotrix covered us with a blanket, and she too would drift to sleep. 

Tomorrow, I start my new plan.

I'm putting this out there in case anyone has dealt with anything similar with a wrongful claim through ICBC.

About a year ago someone filed an ICBC claim that I backed into a parked, motorized scooter while pulling out of a parallel parking spot causing over **$2,800** in damages to the scooter.

At the time of the claim I was having coffee with two of my friends at a coffee shop off of Commercial Drive on a quiet street. We all got into my small car afterwards, one of my friends was in the passenger seat, and one in the back seat. I pulled out of the parking spot, and did **NOT** hit a scooter. No one in my vehicle felt an impact or heard any noise.

Two separate witnesses called in to support the claim:

* Witness 1: Provided my licence plate number but described a vehicle of a different colour.
* Witness 2: Did not have my licence plate and described the driver who 'hit the scooter' as having black hair. I'm a blonde.

ICBC says that my two friends in the car *do not count* as witnesses because they are not 'independent' witnesses. Through the two witness accounts provided by the scooter owner and no additional evidence, I have been determined 100% at fault for the 'incident' and my auto insurance has gone up over 1k this year.

I am 99.9999% sure that the owner of the scooter is using ICBC to commit insurance fraud against me, and because ICBC is the overlord here it seems as though there's nothing I can do! I have a spotless driving record other than this claim. If you've dealt with anything similar please let me know!!",4,1770856764.0,legaladvicecanada,1,1.0,False

I know you need a CLP label but this requires you to a) know the weights of the wax/oil etc and b) to put your personal/indetifiable info on it. I’m only one person and don’t have a business, how would I go about making sure the candles I make are safe and legal? What information do I put on the label? I also know you’re only supposed to use up to 10% of the volume (or weight?) of the candle when using the fragrance oils. 

Further info on the jars and candles weights are here for reference in case anyone can help me.

Your muse is an ordinary person by day, superhero by night facing (sometimes monstrous) evil bad guys in a city called Metropolis. 

You can play any gender, any background, any power set within reason. Heroes, anti heroes, vigilantes, even reformed former villains are welcome.

Metropolis never sleeps. By day it is steel and glass, packed streets, classrooms, corner shops, coffee cups held in tired hands. Rent is too high. Professors assign too much reading. Bosses schedule you for shifts you swore you could not take.

You are normal here. A university student cramming for exams.  A barista working double shifts.  An intern at a tech firm that does not know your name.  A paramedic, a journalist, a mechanic, a grad student drowning in debt. You take the subway. You worry about bills. You text friends about plans you might cancel because you are exhausted.

And then the sun sets. Metropolis changes when the skyline goes dark. Sirens echo longer. Shadows stretch higher between buildings. Something monstrous crawls out of the river tunnels. A masked gang with experimental weapons robs an armored truck. A creature made of living concrete smashes through downtown traffic.

And then… and then you are not so ordinary anymore. You have powers. Maybe you were born with them. Maybe it was an accident. Maybe it was something stranger. No one can know who you are.

Full story: 
9m old and I go for a play group once a week. We had a summer break of almost two months and went back for the new term yesterday. My baby took one look at the room of other moms and babies and started screaming. 

Bawled. Tears running down his face, nose pouring, clinging to me screaming “mamamamamamama!” 

We had to leave early because he was upsetting everyone there.

I’m worried it’s because we don’t get out much. I can’t drive (used to, stopped for a while, now too afraid to get behind the wheel again). So we’re pretty much in the house most days. If it’s sunny we go for a walk around the neighbourhood. And we go out to malls etc. on weekends when hubs is there to drive us around. He loves the mall and the park. Just doesn’t like an enclosed room full of people I guess? 

All the other babies in the play group seem so well adjusted. Playing with toys, crawling around each other and generally being a cute group of babies. All the other mums take their kids out daily to parks and coffee shops and libraries and mommy and me gyms. 

I feel like I’m failing as a mother.

1r2evjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurism/comments/1r2evjd/humanrobot_pairing_as_a_possible_solution_to/,Human-robot pairing as a possible solution to massive unemployment?,"Hi fellow futurists,

yesterday, after two sleepless nights (unrelated problems) and a bit more coffee than is humanly recommended, I got to a strange idea that seems to solve the problem of lack of jobs after AI and robots takes over - it seems that the Infographics show fused with ""Learning To Be Me"". It is almost certainly a nonsense but right now I don't see a problem in it - please read and give your opinion if you wish.

Each adult human in a country would be assigned an AI-endowed robot. The robot would go to work instead of their human, or, when applicable, work by the side of their human, and would be formally attached to the humans identity. The robot would be paid for their work just like a human would, and this payment would go to their human ""caregiver""; the human would be responsible for keeping their robot functional and in good working condition. Outside of work, the robot owner could use their robot as they see fit.

This way, the current structures for jobs and payments would stay in place, and the society would function more or less normally. Gradually, as the technical development permits it, some people might choose to partially or fully merge with their robotic counterpart, possibly up to complete upload (if that proves physically feasible). Some might be happier to just keep their robot to do the heavy lifting, yet some might want to upgrade and improve their robot like a favourite car.

The positive of this approach is that it avoids the societal hazards with mass unemployment, and circumvents the problems of universal basic income. Negatives... um... I don't know right now but I'm sure there are some.

1r2ev53,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_commandercalos/comments/1r2ev53/the_linen_room/,The Linen Room,"

**The Linen Room**

This is a work of fiction. It uses real public controversies as atmosphere, not as proof. So, let us begin…

I know how a jail smells when the night goes wrong.

Cold bleach. Old sweat. Burnt coffee that sat too long on a hot plate. And that stale, damp odor that clings to concrete no matter how hard you scrub. You learn it in your first month, and it never leaves you. Years later, you can catch it on a stranger’s shirt in a grocery aisle, and your body tightens before your mind even places the memory.

I did my time on the inside in South Carolina, at the state level, and then again down in Florida. County work. Not federal, but we still held prisoners for the Feds that had detainers. Still, a cell is a cell when the doors lock, and policy turns into habit, and habit turns into survival.

That’s why I couldn’t shake it.

The first time I saw the photos, I didn’t feel shocked. I felt that hard, trained skepticism that comes when a report reads clean but the scene looks dirty. I had worked on suicides and suspicious deaths. I had stood over a man who “fell” in a shower stall and watched a supervisor fight the urge to ask the wrong questions out loud. I had taken statements from officers who swore their rounds were perfect, while the logbook told a different story in ink that looked fresh.

When the story broke about Epstein, every cop I knew had an opinion. Some said he got what he deserved. Some said no way he died like that. Most people just repeated whatever clip they saw last.

I stayed quiet until I saw the linen.

A friend from my old days sent me a link with no message. Just a link. That alone told me he felt uneasy. He was the type who didn’t spook easily. His name was Ray. We’d walked tiers together back when I was still young enough to believe policy was real and not just paper.

The link led to a dump of “files” that bounced around the internet like ash after a fire. Some were obvious junk. Some looked real. Many were redacted so hard they read like black rain.

I clicked through and stopped on a detail that punched me in the gut.

Clothes. Blankets. Linen.

Not because linens are strange by themselves. They’re not. But because the way people talked about them didn’t match how a locked unit works when it’s run the way it’s supposed to be run. In a special housing unit, you control property like you control oxygen. Too much cloth is a problem. Too much of anything is a problem.

I leaned back in my chair and stared at my ceiling fan until it blurred. Then I opened a new document window and started typing notes the way I used to, back when I did reports that could get you sued if you missed a comma.

What do we know?  
What do we assume?  
What do we pretend?

That last line is where the truth hides.

The next morning, I got a second message from Ray.

“Call me when you can. Not text.”

I called.

He didn’t greet me. He didn’t do small talk. He just said, “You ever see a ‘suicide’ where the room looks staged?”

“Yes,” I said. “More than once.”

“Then you know why I’m calling.”

I sat up straighter. “Where are you at?”

“Not important. Listen. I’m not saying he didn’t do it. I’m saying the story they gave the public has gaps you could drive a transport van through.”

I let him talk.

He told me about the federal report people were citing, about cameras that didn’t record, about officers who missed checks, about overtime and staffing and a unit that ran hot with burnout. That part didn’t surprise me. Understaffing is the oldest excuse in corrections, and half the time it’s true.

Then Ray said, “The linen detail is what got you, didn’t it?”

I didn’t answer.

He laughed once, no humor in it. “Same here. You and I both know how linen works. And you know how a noose works. That’s why this doesn’t sit right.”

I told him, “The federal place is different.”

“A little,” he said. “But not that different.”

He lowered his voice. “I got something else. Not from a website. From a person. A person with access.”

My stomach tightened. “Ray. Don’t play games.”

“I’m not. I’m trying to keep you alive.”

That made me go still.

He continued. “You remember how we used to say there are two kinds of cases. The ones that happen, and the ones that get managed.”

“Yes.”

“This one got managed.”

I wanted to dismiss it. I wanted to do what normal people do and walk away. But my career trained that out of me. When you see a gap, you step toward it. Curiosity is a job hazard.

“What are you saying,” I asked, “that he didn’t die?”

“I’m saying I can’t prove he died,” Ray said. “And I’m saying there’s a reason the public never got the kind of clear evidence that shuts everyone up.”

He didn’t say “photos.” He didn’t say “video.” He didn’t have to. I knew the argument. People had wanted the kind of proof that ends debate, and all they got were statements, summaries, and blurry footage arguments that never settled.

I said, “What did your person give you?”

Ray hesitated. Then: “A name, and a place, and a role.”

I held my breath.

“Israel,” he said.

I waited, but the next words came slowly, as they hurt him to speak.

“A MOSSAD agent.”

I almost laughed. It sounded absurd. It sounded like a joke written by a man with too much time and no discipline.

But Ray didn’t laugh. Ray sounded like he wanted to puke.

“He’s supposedly living clean,” Ray said. “Not rich. Not flashy. Like a man who knows the spotlight kills.”

My voice hardened. “This is nonsense.”

“That’s what I said,” Ray replied. “Then I saw the attachment.”

I felt the air in my living room change. “What attachment?”

“A memo,” he said. “One of those sterile, bureaucratic memos. Two paragraphs. No emotion. That’s why it scared me. It read like a shipping notice. Like moving equipment.”

“Show me,” I said.

“I can’t,” he replied. “Not by text. Not by email.”

“Then how?”

A pause.

“Meet me.”

I looked at my hands. I still have the habit of scanning them when I’m stressed, like I’m checking for blood I can’t see.

“I’m not a kid,” I said.

“I know,” Ray answered. “That’s why I’m calling you. You’re the only person I trust to read it like a cop, not like a fan.”

That line got me. It was a direct hit. Because a fan starts with a conclusion and hunts for scraps. A cop starts with a scene and hunts for structure.

I agreed to meet him.

We chose a place with loud air conditioning and bad coffee. A diner off a highway. The kind of place where truckers come in dusty and leave without remembering faces.

Ray arrived wearing a low-crowned ball cap. He looked older than he should. The job does that.

He slid into the booth across from me and placed a phone on the table like it weighed a hundred pounds. He didn’t push it to me yet.

“You ready?” he asked.

“For what?” I said.

“For the part where you can’t unsee it.”

I stared at him. “Let’s stop being dramatic.”

Ray’s eyes stayed dead serious. “This isn’t drama. This is the part where your training becomes a liability.”

He unlocked the phone and turned it toward me.

The memo wasn’t long. It had an official tone. It referenced a “high-risk detainee transfer.” It used phrases like “sanitized corridor” and “non-attributable custody.” It is named without an agency directly. But it used a phrase I’d heard before in the military world, a phrase that means, We’re doing this off the books.

Cut out.

I looked up. “You’re telling me this is real.”

Ray said, “I’m telling you it matches how real people write when they think nobody outside their circle will ever read it.”

I scrolled.

There was a second page. A “support checklist.” Linen. Cameras. Staff rosters. A note about “media pre-brief.” Another note about “draft statement.” A date.

The date was the day before.

My throat went dry.

I looked at Ray. “If this is fake, it’s a good fake.”

“It could be,” he admitted. “But it lines up with something else that just surfaced.”

“What?”

He tapped the screen where the “draft statement” was referenced. “They had an announcement dated the day before the death went public.”

I stared at the date again, feeling that old corrections instinct in my bones. When a statement is drafted in advance, it can mean two things. It can mean you expect an event and you’re preparing for it. Or it can mean you’re about to create an event and you’re preparing for it.

I said, “Or it can mean staff do contingency drafts.”

Ray leaned in. “Sure. And do you draft a death announcement as a contingency for a guy whose case is the most radioactive thing in the country? The kind of case that could burn a president, a prince, a billionaire, and half of Wall Street.”

He didn’t say names. He didn’t have to.

I felt anger rise. Not at Epstein. Not sympathy. Something colder.

If this was staged, it wasn’t mercy. It wasn’t a rescue. It was management. It was the system protecting itself. It was the machine eating the evidence and calling it justice.

I asked, “What’s the story in the memo?”

Ray took the phone back. He looked around the diner. He spoke like a man reciting a prayer he didn’t believe.

“The story is this,” he said. “Epstein was a tool. A predator with a purpose. A handler’s dream. A monster who could bait other monsters. He collected leverage. He created honey traps. He made powerful men stupid. Then he kept records, and that made him valuable.”

He paused.

“Then he got caught in public,” Ray continued. “And once he got caught in public, he became a liability. So the question became: do you silence him, or do you move him?”

“Move him where?” I asked.

Ray’s jaw clenched. “To a place with friends. To a place where the politics are complicated, where intelligence services have long memories and quiet hands.”

“Israel,” I said.

Ray nodded once.

“And the cover story,” he added, “is the only cover story that ends a case with finality. Suicide. No trial. No discovery. No sworn testimony.”

I looked at him. “And your memo says he’s alive there.”

Ray didn’t answer directly. Instead, he said, “It says the extraction was ‘successful.’ It says the ‘asset remains serviceable.’ It says the public narrative was ‘contained.’”

My skin crawled.

The waitress refilled our coffee. I watched the dark liquid pour like oil. She smiled at us like everything in the world was normal. That’s how it always is. The worst parts of the world happen behind closed doors while ordinary people keep eating pancakes.

I lowered my voice. “What about cameras?”

Ray’s eyes narrowed. “The memo lists them like obstacles. ‘Recorder failure.’ ‘Non-recording camera.’ ‘Limited view.’ It reads like someone designing darkness.”

He was right. The language wasn’t. We had an unfortunate technical problem. It was, we created gaps.

I said, “And the uniforms.”

Ray almost flinched, like the word itself was filthy.

“The uniforms are the prop,” he said. “The cloth. The extra blankets, the uniforms. The excuse. You can turn cloth into anything in a cell if you have time and privacy. The memo reads like somebody made sure he had both.”

I pictured the scene. Not from a news clip. From my own head. A man alone. A unit is understaffed. Rounds missed. Cameras useless. Staff are tired, paid, or threatened. A story building itself.

I asked, “What about the body?”

Ray said, “The memo calls it ‘presentation.’”

My stomach rolled.

“Presentation,” I repeated.

“Like a stage,” Ray replied. “Like a photo op for the official record, not for the public. They don’t need to convince the whole country. They need enough paperwork for the machine to move on.”

I thought about every case file I’d ever seen where the paperwork was cleaner than the truth.

Then Ray said something that made my blood run cold.

“You want to know the darkest part,” he asked.

“What,” I said.

“He’s still useful,” Ray answered. “Not as a financier. Not as a celebrity. As a therapist. A trainer. A listener. A man who can read shame and turn it into obedience.”

I stared at him.

Ray’s voice dropped to a whisper. “A pedophile isn’t just a predator. He’s a collector. He collects secrets. He collects fear. He collects leverage. And if you’re an intelligence service that wants to steer people, a monster like that is a weapon you can aim.”

I wanted to punch the table. Not at Ray. At the idea that any government would keep a predator alive because it had value.

I said, “You’re accusing agencies.”

Ray leaned back. “I’m describing a structure. A system. I’m telling you how a cutout works.”

He said the words like he’d learned them from someone who wore a suit, not a uniform.

In my head, I saw seals on doors. I saw signatures. I saw quiet meetings. I saw men who never touch the crime but always profit from it.

I asked, “Why bring this to me?”

Ray’s face tightened. “Because you can write it. And if you write it right, you don’t claim it’s proof. You show it as a pattern. You show how a death can be managed. You show how the public gets just enough to stop asking.”

He slid his phone back toward me.

“And,” he said, “because if this is real, somebody will bury it. They’ll call it insane. They’ll call it hateful. They’ll call it whatever word shuts people up.”

I stared at the memo again. My mind was racing, but my training kept trying to put it in a box.

Facts.  
Assumptions.  
Unknowns.

Then I saw it, tucked near the bottom, like an afterthought.

A single line.

“Gentile channels: active.”

I looked at Ray. “What does that mean?”

Ray swallowed. “It means the story gets laundered through outsiders. People who aren’t in the inner circle. People who will repeat it loudly, so the loudness becomes the reason nobody in power has to answer. They can point and say, Look at the crazies.”

He continued, voice flat. “It means useful fools.”

I hated that phrase. I’d heard it in training and in war stories. It’s what cynics call citizens.

I said, “So we become the noise.”

Ray nodded. “Exactly. And while the crowd argues about suicide versus murder, the machine stays protected either way. Because the trial never happens.”

I sat back and stared at the diner window. Cars flew by in streaks of sunlight.

That’s when I realized the most painful truth of all.

If a conspiracy like this existed, it would not rely on genius. It would rely on weakness. On fatigue. On understaffing. On human error that is easy to create and impossible to prove. It would rely on the fact that prisons are messy places, and messy places make clean lies easy.

Ray stood up.

“Don’t keep that memo,” he said. “Read it. Understand it. Then forget you saw it.”

I looked up. “What are you going to do?”

“I’m going to disappear,” he answered. “Not like Epstein. Like a man who knows too much.”

Then he left me there with the smell of coffee and bleach and the hum of the air conditioner, and a question that felt like a hook in my ribs.

What if the story wasn’t that he died?

What if the story was that his death was the best alibi the system ever wrote?

**What public records say, and what claims remain unproven**

Epstein’s death was ruled a suicide by the New York City medical examiner, and the U.S. Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General documented major Bureau of Prisons failures around staffing and supervision at Metropolitan Correctional Center, including missed rounds and problems with surveillance recording in the relevant area. ([Justice Inspector General](https://oig.justice.gov/sites/default/files/reports/23-085.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

That same Inspector General report notes that only limited video was available for key areas due to a malfunctioning recording system, and that investigators could not recover some recordings and seized hard drives as evidence. ([Justice Inspector General](https://oig.justice.gov/sites/default/files/reports/23-085.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

The “clothes” issue shows up in a more mundane way than internet versions often suggest. The Inspector General report describes a prior cellmate discussing a makeshift clothesline made from torn sheet material and noting multiple blankets in the cell at one point. That detail supports the idea that cloth can exist in a cell without providing any wider plot on its own. ([Justice Inspector General](https://oig.justice.gov/sites/default/files/reports/23-085.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

On the “death notice the day before” point, a fresh wave of reporting says newly released files include a draft statement attributed to the Southern District of New York U.S. Attorney’s Office dated Aug. 9, 2019, the day before Epstein was found dead on Aug. 10. That can be read as routine contingency drafting in a high-profile case, or as suspicious, but the existence of a dated draft alone does not prove foreknowledge of a death. ([The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/epstein-files-reveal-prosecutors-announcement-dated-before-his-death/))

Recent reporting also describes disputes over what a “flash of orange” seen on video near the tier means, with differing interpretations among reviewers and outside analysts, and renewed attention to whether anyone entered the tier that night. ([CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/epstein-files-jail-cell-death-video-logs/))

Claims that Epstein “worked for” the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, British services like MI6, or Mossad are rife with public speculation and recycled rumor. Multiple analyses and reported reviews of available records indicate they do not provide evidence of formal intelligence-tasking relationships, and some commonly repeated “intelligence asset” anecdotes trace back to shaky sourcing. ([Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/jeffrey-epstein-spy-epstein-files-intelligence-asset-trump-bondi-2025-7?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Hey everyone. I was going through my laptop looking for documents to complete my housing application when I came across this thing I wrote a little while ago that I thought I’d finally share today. It really is incredible how much your life can change in just a few months.

\*	\*	\*	\*	\*	\*	\*

**November 8th, 2025**

I don’t really know where to start with all of this, so I guess I’ll just start from the very beginning and hope that this somehow makes sense.

My name is Jonathan. I’m 24 years old, which I know isn’t that old to most people, but it sure feels like it sometimes. I was born in 2001 in an unremarkable medium-sized city in the Midwest. Let’s just say this city has seen better days. What was once a major industrial employer has since been turned into a shell of what it used to be. Most of the major companies closed their factories down, and the few that remained open could never get enough workers due to a years-long population decline. The city entered a financial recession, which to this day it hasn’t fully recovered from, despite new attempts at bringing in modernized industry.

Still, a lot of the old-timers who lived to experience this city’s economic boom wanted to keep the glory days alive, I guess. Them, and those who never had a chance in life. I mean, that’s my only explanation as to why those factories stayed open: clinging on to relics of the past. One of those people was my own father. He was, let’s just say, most people’s idea of what a stereotypical blue-collar worker was. One of those pickup-truck-driving, beer-drinking types who didn’t believe in higher education, claiming that you had to get your hands dirty to be a “real man” and that college was just a scam.

Right off the bat, our relationship was less than ideal. Trust me, you did not want to ever get on his bad side, or else all hell would break loose. I’m sure the death of my mother didn’t do any good for his mental state. That’s why, despite his anger problems, he got full custody of me right from the start. Looking back, I’m pretty sure he was severely depressed on top of it all. I mean, how could he not be? Slaving away at the same factory your whole life, watching any opportunity you had to make something of your life slowly slip away. Even from a young age, I knew that I didn’t want that kind of life.

The problem was that I never really knew what I actually did want. As a kid, I felt completely aimless. I was quiet, shy, the kind of kid everyone else pays extra attention to. This made me a prime target for bullies, who would physically and emotionally torment me every chance they got. I honestly just accepted it. I knew I wasn’t normal. I was a weird kid with no mother and a father who I was honestly afraid of most of the time.

Most days when I got home from school, I’d find my father sitting on the couch in the living room in front of the TV, watching either news reports or some college football game, exhausted from having worked all day. I never said much to him, and he never said much in return. I would spend the rest of the day in my cramped bedroom, either doing homework or escaping into one of my video games, the colourful images and cute characters distracting me from the torment I faced in the real world. When bedtime came around, I’d just lie awake staring out the small window next to my bed at the decrepit old houses out on the cracked street in front of our place, hoping that I would find any sort of direction someday.

Things continued like this for a long time. My father never gave up his tough-guy attitude, and I kept on being the social outcast at school. Honestly, I don’t remember much from that period of my life. What I do remember, though, is the day I thought everything was going to change. It was March 21st, 2016. I was a freshman in high school, still 14 at the time, and it had just been another run-of-the-mill day for me. At 1 p.m., a dozen other kids and I settled into our science class. Our teacher told us that we’d be starting on the biology unit that day and put on a nature documentary for us to watch.

Seriously, I still remember this moment like it was yesterday. The documentary opened on the most beautiful-looking scenery I had ever seen. Deep blue skies and lush green forest as far as you could see, broken up by majestic-looking mountains in the background. The narrator of the documentary stated that we were currently looking at the Olympic Peninsula in Washington. I was entranced by the beauty I was seeing. The scene then switched to a shot of a cat moving slowly through the forest below. The narrator described the scene: a female cougar stalking a lonesome deer, looking for her next meal.

The cougar moved so quietly, barely making a sound as she prepared herself for the kill, and I’ll admit I was silently cheering her on. Suddenly, it jumped up, and the deer had no time to react before it was quickly taken down and suffocated by the large cat. I watched in complete awe as the cougar proceeded to drag the dead deer a short distance to a small area of densely packed trees.

What happened next is the part I remember the most about it all. The cougar let go of the deer and turned her head towards a small bush a few feet away. She meowed quietly, and out from behind the bush emerged several kittens — her babies. The mother cougar returned to the deer carcass, and her cubs ran after her, bouncing along the soft ground and over the exposed tree roots lining the forest floor. I vividly remember feeling my eyes go wide as I watched the kittens bumping into each other as they bounded towards their food, innocent as anything. It took everything in me not to scream. It was the cutest thing I’d ever seen.

I don’t really remember what happened after that; it all felt like a blur to me. I had so many emotions running through my mind, all from a simple documentary, but something changed in me that day. Seeing those kittens ignited something in me, and for the first time in my life, I no longer felt aimless. To this day, I’m amazed at how quickly all of this happened, but I finally knew what I wanted to do with my life. After so many years of wandering aimlessly, I finally had an answer. I wanted to work with animals. I wanted to live in the Pacific Northwest, far away from the industrial wasteland that I was so familiar with. I had finally found my calling, and by God, I was going to do whatever I could to make my new dream a reality.

For the next few months, I was on top of the world. Every night, I’d spend my time researching various canine and feline species, learning as much as I could about them. I’d get lost in nature documentaries and dream about living in the locations they visited. I began researching different schools, taking a liking to one in particular purely based on its proximity to the landscape I was so in love with. I even found myself browsing used cars and trucks online. From Lincoln Town Cars to beat-up GMC trucks, I began imagining myself taking an epic cross-country road trip to college in one of them, exploring the country and never coming back to this place. It was genuinely the best time of my life. I was still bullied at school, but I didn’t care. My relationship with my father was still shaky, but I didn’t care. I finally knew what it was like to have a dream.

I guess what they say is true — good times have to end at some point. I’d never told my father about my plan, as I was terrified of what his reaction would be, but something in me finally convinced me to go through with it. I honestly don’t know what I expected to happen, but I never expected it to go the way it did. On August 2nd, after months of building up the courage to talk to my father, I finally told him about everything. I said that I loved science, I loved animals, and that I wanted to go to college to become a biologist. I even told him I’d take out loans to help pay for it so he wouldn’t have to get stressed over the financial side of it all.

Let me tell you, I’d seen the man blow his top before, but I was not prepared for the reaction I got this time. He grabbed me by the wrist and dragged me through the house and into the garage. I tried to protest, but he never let up on me. We entered the garage, and he grabbed a short but sturdy piece of wood off his workbench. He held me against the workbench as he began hitting me in the shoulders with it. I begged him to stop, but he wouldn’t listen. He shouted at me that I was a fool for getting involved in such nonsense and that at some point I had to learn the value of “honest work” if I ever wanted to be a “real adult.” After what felt like an eternity of tirades, he threw the piece of wood at the wall and stormed back inside the house, slamming the door behind him and leaving me shaking and unable to process anything that had just happened. I remember quietly going back inside the house and shutting myself inside my bedroom, collapsing on my bed and silently crying my eyes out for at least an hour.

Well, if that man’s goal was to instill so much fear in me that I’d never dare have dreams like that ever again, then it really worked. Suddenly, the thought of pursuing a degree in biology was no longer something to keep me going. It was no longer a beacon of light at the end of the dark tunnel I found myself in, metaphorically speaking. Instead, it served as a reminder of what had happened that day.

Not wanting to be reminded of that day, I completely shut down again. The one dream I ever had, completely destroyed. Once again, I found myself wandering aimlessly through life, sometimes wondering what I did to deserve the hand I’d been dealt. I went from pushing myself in class to doing the absolute bare minimum to pass.

On my 16th birthday, my father sat me down to talk to me. He said that I was now “officially an adult” and that it wasn’t his job to take care of me anymore. He told me I had until I turned 18 to “keep freeloading off of him,” and then I’d be out of the house. I wish I could tell you that I was devastated by this news, that I felt my world shatter around me, but to be honest, I didn’t care. I was on complete autopilot at that point, only focused on making it to the next day.

I didn’t dare object to him this time. I immediately began setting myself up for what was coming. I got my driver’s licence later that year and even found myself a part-time job at a fast-food place at a truck stop just outside of the city. My father agreed to drive me, but only until I saved up enough to buy my own car.

I’ll say it straight up: the job sucked. On my first day, I was assigned to the fry station. Having to stand in front of a hot fryer for hours was unbearable, and most of my coworkers were less than friendly. It seemed like most of them were there because they never had the chance at anything more, and all their anger and bitterness seemed to come out on me most days. I remember one of my coworkers, an elderly woman named Barbara, would go ballistic on me every time I made even the slightest mistake or didn’t move fast enough.

The nicer folks were around my age, just there to pick up some extra cash. It probably helped them knowing that one day they’d be off to better things and that this was only temporary for them, and I’ll admit I found myself jealous of them because of that.

In my senior year of high school, I’d finally saved enough money to buy a car. I wasn’t looking for anything particular, just something cheap and reliable to get me to work and back. I settled on a 2002 Honda CR-V that I still have to this day. It had seen better days. It was covered in dents and scratches, and the interior was torn up pretty badly as well, but it was cheap, and the monthly insurance payments wouldn’t break my bank account, and by that point, it was all I cared about.

I don’t know how, but through all of this, I kept my grades above passing. My dreams of college were nothing but a distant relic at this point, but school still meant something to me, I guess. I honestly don’t know why; I mean, it’s not like I saw any point in any of that stuff anymore. Some voice inside of me, barely audible, just told me to keep at it. Still, on graduation day, I felt no pride, no happiness. While everyone else was looking forward to whatever future they had planned, all I had to look forward to was getting the boot from my father.

The past six years went by a lot quicker than I thought they would. I guess once you start living day by day, your perception of time gets distorted. Six years ago, I packed what I could fit into the CR-V and drove away from my father’s place for the last time while he stared at me from the front porch, not even bothering to say goodbye.

I had spent that summer setting myself up with an apartment in the city. It was cheap, but the saying “you get what you pay for” is definitely accurate, especially when it comes to housing. The building was located on the rougher side of town, in one of the main industrial areas. The area wasn’t exactly well-off, and every morning, I’d see another car in the parking lot with its windows smashed in. For once, I was thankful that my car was in the condition it was. They probably didn’t see any reason to go through a car that looked like mine.

After a while, I got used to the smell of the pollution and the constant blaring of police sirens. I kept working at the fast-food place, but after a while, I knew I wasn’t going to be able to afford to keep living off a few part-time shifts a week. Since I was denied a full-time position, I had no choice but to begin looking for another job.

I wouldn’t really say that I got lucky. I mean, with everything that had led me to this point in my life, luck seemed like a completely foreign concept to me. One day, as I was driving back to the apartment after a particularly busy day at work, I noticed one of the factories a few blocks from the apartment was looking for full-time general labourers. By this point, my bank account was already near exhaustion, and since it wasn’t where my father worked, I bit the bullet and applied online later that evening. I was surprised at how quickly I got a job offer. The fast-food place seemed eager to get rid of me, and before I knew it, I was officially an employee of the factory, where I still work to this day.

On my first day one of the plant supervisors took me to the place where trucks were loaded and unloaded, where a small group of people were busy taking boxes out of one of the trailers. He told me that my job would involve working with these people to load and unload each truck that came.



On my first day, one of the plant supervisors took me to the place where trucks were loaded and unloaded, where a small group of people were busy taking boxes out of one of the trailers. He told me that my job would involve working with these people to load and unload each truck that came.

Good lord, I thought working the fryer was backbreaking and mind-numbing work. After something like three days of working at this place, I had already checked out. For eight hours a day, all I did was pick up boxes from the trucks and carry them over to where forklifts would pick them up later. Sometimes the forklifts would bring us pallets stacked with boxes, which we would then carry into the trucks.

My coworkers honestly made me nervous. I heard everything from prison stories to the most ridiculous conspiracy theories imaginable, all day, every day. They constantly insulted me for my lack of physical strength or desire to be a “real man” like they were. Through it all, I just kept my head down and did my best to get to the end of each shift.

Every single night, I would get back to the apartment exhausted to the point of not wanting to do anything. I’d have dinner, watch some videos on YouTube, and fall asleep. Rinse and repeat. Every single day for what actually felt like forever.

I was surprised that there didn’t seem to be much turnover of employees at this place. I guess those guys needed that work as much as I did. Despite getting used to seeing the same folks every day, I never made any effort to try and talk to them. One day, that changed, however. During one of my breaks, I sat down at an empty table across from an elderly man eating a sandwich.

I think it was the fact that I didn’t look or behave like the others that made him do a double take at me. He asked me why someone my age would choose to work in a place like that instead of joining the other young folks who were hitting the highway, looking for opportunity elsewhere. I didn’t say much in return, just that I needed some quick cash. Looking back, I realize I was probably doing a horrible job at pretending that nothing was wrong, but he didn’t press me anymore that day, and I was happy to be left alone.

This guy seemed like he was interested in getting to know me, so he began talking with me more often during breaks, despite my initial disinterest. His name was Ellis, and he’d been working in that factory since 1966. I’ll admit I was a little taken aback when he told me this. He seemed intelligent and well-spoken, not like a lot of the other guys who worked there. I gathered the courage to say more than two words to him for once and asked him how he ended up in this kind of life.

Turns out, we weren’t so different from each other, and for the first time in a long time, I actually felt emotional when Ellis told me about his youth, as it kind of reminded me of my own. He was nine years old when Sputnik launched, igniting his passion for outer space. He worked hard in school to get accepted into college to study astronomy and was apparently all set to go — that is, until his father was killed in an industrial accident. His mother completely broke down after this happened, to the point that she couldn’t even take care of herself anymore.

Ellis, not wanting to just abandon his mother while she was going through all of this, officially shelved his lifelong dream and took a job at this very factory to make ends meet and provide for his mother. For over 40 years, he slaved away at the place, something I had a hard time comprehending. By the time she passed away, Ellis was in his mid-50s, his dreams a distant relic by this point, and he kept his job at the factory to keep getting by.

Hearing all of this made me more comfortable opening up about my own experiences. I told Ellis about how I had dreamed of moving to the Pacific Northwest and going to college and how my father wouldn’t accept it and eventually kicked me out of the house, leading me to take any kind of job I could to get by.

Despite being 53 years older than me, Ellis was honestly the closest I ever had to a friend. I could tell he enjoyed having someone to talk to for once, and I felt the same towards him. Sure, the job never got any better, but the conversations we’d have made the days go by a little faster, and over the years, we grew surprisingly close. He would always tell me that, unlike him, I still had the chance to chase my dreams if I really wanted to and that I’d absolutely regret not doing so. I appreciated that he was trying to help me, but my own fate felt sealed at this point.

It was earlier this year, in March, that everything began to change. The 17th had started out uneventful enough, but then something struck me as odd. I noticed that Ellis hadn’t shown up for work. Ellis had almost never missed a single day of work in all the years I’d been there, but I wasn’t too worried at the time. Maybe he’d just gotten sick and needed a day or two to recover. As the week went on, however, I began to get a little worried. Where was he? It wasn’t until the 21st that I overheard a conversation between a few workers as I was clocking out for the day.

Apparently, Ellis had been out for a drive the previous Sunday, and a drunk driver left their lane and smashed into his car head-on. Both the driver and Ellis were killed on impact. I wish I could tell you I felt sad, but to be completely honest, I couldn’t find it in me to feel much of anything. Way deep down, I felt horrible for that. The only person in my life who ever cared about me was dead, and I couldn’t even be a little bit sad about it.

I just kept working and getting by. Slow as molasses in January is how I’d describe the past few months. I managed, but to be honest, every day seemed to drag on forever without the old man to brighten them up just that much. Imagine spending your whole life working a dead-end job in some run-down factory, never being able to follow your dreams and live your life, only to be killed by someone else’s actions well into what should’ve been his retirement years.

I began thinking back to what he always told me. “Chase your dreams while you still have time.” Despite his death, I still had a hard time thinking seriously about Ellis’ words. By this point, I’d honestly just grown comfortable with my life. I had a routine, and while it certainly wasn’t the life I ever thought I’d have, or wanted to have, it was familiar, and it got me by, which is all I cared about anymore.

Sorry, I know that took a while to go through. I just wanted to give you some context for what led to today’s experience. I’ll also be directly quoting the conversations I had, so apologies if this next part sounds a little weird.

I can’t say anything felt unusual when I woke up, other than the pounding headache I had from the grey, overcast weather. I thought I would be able to silence the headache with a nice cup of coffee, but of course my old coffee maker decided that today would be the day it would stop working. I made my usual breakfast, two scrambled eggs and some bacon, which I ate while staring across the dark, cramped apartment towards the balcony, barely being able to see the other buildings outside due to the fog. The old beat-up CRV reminded me to get it serviced with that piercing orange light, but it still got me to work on time.

I made my way into the factory with the usual crowd, my headache only subsiding slightly as I clocked in. Despite this, I felt a little weird. I couldn’t tell why I felt this way or what caused the feeling in the first place, but something felt off, as if the air in the building was thicker. I just pushed these thoughts aside and got to work. Box after box, I loaded up each truck, listening to my coworkers talking about the latest political drama and conspiracies. As always, I ignored them and did what I was paid to do. Despite being just another normal morning, I still couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. I chalked it up to my headache making my mind play tricks on me.

After what felt like an eternity, the sweet sound of the lunch bell echoed throughout the factory, and I sluggishly made my way to the breakroom, a chance to put down this headache with some caffeine. The breakroom looked as it always had, the dull grey ceiling lights illuminating the faded white walls and tan-coloured tile floor. Of course, the ancient coffee maker was out of order. I silently cursed the universe for having it out for me on this particular morning.

The breakroom was never usually too crowded, as most of the workers would instead eat lunch outside and smoke. Today, however, the room was a lot more crowded than it usually was, no doubt because of the weather. Though I recognized some of them, I’d never spoken to them before. I sat down in a relatively private area in the back corner of the room. By this point, my headache was so bad I could barely see straight or form a coherent thought. I laid my head down in my arms on the table and closed my eyes, hoping I could relax enough to alleviate the pain.

I don’t know exactly when I dozed off, but I remember opening my eyes feeling slightly groggy. I lifted my head and looked around the breakroom, which was completely void of any signs of life. I cursed myself for falling asleep, not having had any lunch, and now being late getting back to work. I tried to check the time on my phone, but it wouldn’t turn on. I’d remembered to charge it the previous night and chalked it up to being an old model.

I left my lunchbox on the table, reminding myself to pick it up at the end of my shift, and quickly left the room to get back to work before anyone noticed I was missing. As I walked down the dimly lit hall back to the factory floor, however, I could tell something wasn’t right. There was no sign of life anywhere. No one was in the hall, and the surrounding rooms were completely empty. It was also unusually quiet. I couldn’t hear the familiar sounds of the machinery or the rumbling of the forklifts’ engines. It was at this point I noticed that my headache had completely disappeared, which I was silently grateful for. I tried not to think about the lack of activity and kept walking.

When I got back to the factory floor, I was in complete shock at what I discovered. The entire factory was completely empty. The machinery had been completely shut down. The doors by the loading bay had all been closed, and forklifts were strewn about all over the place. I just stopped and stared at it all. I looked up to the windows near the ceiling of the loading bay, and outside the sky was pitch black. The possibility that I had slept uninterrupted until nightfall seemed completely crazy.

I ran back to the breakroom and grabbed my lunchbox, then hurried to the factory’s main exit. I tried the door, but it wouldn’t budge. At this point, I began sweating, trying to figure out what the hell was going on. It was then that I noticed something. I guess I was in such a panic that I completely brushed over it. I looked through the small window on the door, and I couldn’t see anything. No lights, no buildings, no cars, literally nothing at all. It was like staring into a black hole. Just a completely black void.

By this point, I was in a full-on panic. I ran to different exits, trying each of them with no success. Hell, I even tried the doors in the loading bay. Again, they wouldn’t budge. I tried calming myself down, telling myself that I’d just fallen asleep and it was all just a bad dream. Still, something in me told me that wasn’t the case. It felt too real, too vivid to be a dream.

I began pacing back and forth, scratching at my skin and hitting myself in the head, trying anything to see if I could wake up from whatever nightmare I was in. It was then that I heard something. The faint sound of footsteps coming from one of the aisles beyond the loading bay. I froze. Honestly, I couldn’t figure out if I should’ve been relieved or afraid that I wasn’t alone in there.

I peered into the aisle where I heard the noise coming from, and I saw a person about halfway down the aisle with their back to me. I was terrified, but I felt like I had no other choice. I slowly began making my way toward them, feeling myself shaking with each step. A few times, I nearly lost my balance and fell over.

When I was maybe twenty feet from the person, I called out to them, my voice trembling so much I was surprised I was able to speak at all.

“H-hello…?” I called out. My heart felt like it was going to explode. The person turned around to look at me, and when they did, I immediately felt cold sweat all over my body. I don’t remember even blinking as I just stared at them. They looked normal, but I was immediately drawn to their eyes, which were pitch-black orbs as dark as the outside. They began walking towards me slowly. I couldn’t move, not only because of the immense fear I felt, but also because I knew exactly who they were.

“...E-Ellis…?” I sputtered. He stopped about five feet from me, and a smile formed on his face.

“Jonathan,” he said, his voice sounding all too familiar. “You made it.” I didn’t move, still trying to figure out exactly what was going on. I tried to speak again.

“W-w-what… w-what is…” I stopped. Like, I couldn’t form thoughts at that moment. My mind was literally blank.

“Don’t worry, kid,” Ellis said. “You’ll be alright. Just don’t go fainting on me, okay?” I’ll admit, hearing his voice again, combined with his usual warm demeanour, somehow calmed me down a little, though I was still thoroughly freaked out over the whole situation. “Come on, let’s sit down. There’s something I want to tell you.”

I hesitantly followed him back to the breakroom, resisting every urge and thought screaming at me to make a run for it. I sat down next to my lunchbox, and Ellis sat down across from me. I couldn’t make eye contact. I mean, how do you make eye contact with someone, or something, that has no eyes? I was still shaking and stuttering like a maniac, but somehow my thoughts came back to me, and I was able to form coherent sentences again.

“W-what the hell is going on?” I stammered through heavy breathing. “What… is this place? Why… w-why am I h-here?” Ellis reached over to me and put his hand on my shoulder. I flinched hard, but something—I don’t know what—finally gave me the courage to look at his face again. I cringed seeing his eyes again, but I also saw that same warm smile, that same smile that told me he cared when no one else did. He patted me on the shoulder a few times, and somehow I began to calm down.

Ellis sat back down in his chair, and I took a moment to breathe. I gathered my thoughts and spoke.

“What the hell is this place?” I asked hesitantly. “Why are you here? Why am I here?”

“Jonathan,” Ellis replied to me with a slight hint of concern in his voice. “There’s something I need to tell you, and you have to listen to me, alright? Don’t ignore me this time, okay?” As he said this, I felt a tinge of guilt creep into my mind, and I had a pretty good idea of what he was going to start talking about. I took a few more breaths, then replied.

“A-alright,” I said.

“So you may have heard about my untimely demise,” said Ellis.

“Y-yeah, I d-did,” I replied. “Y-you were k-killed by a drunk driver, r-right?”

“Damn truck hit me head-on,” Ellis said back, his tone of concern being replaced with mild anger. “Crazy fool must’ve been going around ninety or one hundred miles per hour. Had literally no time to react.”

“J-jesus,” I said, not wanting to even imagine the situation at this point. Ellis continued.

“I only remember a split second of the impact. Next thing I knew, I woke up here. I tried to escape, but just as you did, I found every exit sealed shut. Tried near everything to get out of this place.”

“So…” I said, looking around the confines of the breakroom, “you’ve been trapped in here ever since?” Ellis looked around and sighed.

“Yep,” he replied, sounding defeated. “Sure is lonely here. Wandering the same aisles and rooms aimlessly, over and over again, with not a single soul to talk to.” He looked me in the eyes, at least I think, and continued to talk. “I think I know what happened, and you have to listen to what I’m about to tell you.” At this point, I was immensely curious as to what. I did my best to make eye contact.

“So… what’s going on?” I asked nervously, my voice still trembling slightly. I wasn’t actually sure if I wanted to know, but by now my curiosity was pulling at me for answers, so I went through with it—but what he said next are words that will stick with me until the day I die.

“Kid,” Ellis said as he looked around the breakroom once more, then back to me, his voice laced with sadness. “I think… I think this is my afterlife.” I couldn’t say anything. I was so confused about it all. I tried to talk, but my throat felt frozen in place.

“The universe works in mysterious ways, doesn’t it?” Ellis asked rhetorically. “Seems like since I dedicated my whole life to this place, it decided that I’d stay here forever. Thought I’d finally find peace when I died, but it seems that the universe has a sick sense of humor.”

I stared at Ellis as he stood up from his seat. He walked around to my side of the table and sat down right next to me. I looked him directly in the eye, as much as I could.

“Jonathan,” he began, “I need to ask you something important.” I listened intently as he continued. “You’ve got one life in front of you. Is this really how you want to spend it?”

I looked at the floor, and a strange feeling washed over me. I felt sad. It had been so long since I last allowed myself to feel such emotion that it felt almost alien to me. Every event, every conversation that led me to this point in my life came rushing back to me all at once. The isolation I experienced as a kid. The day my world changed and I had a dream for the first time in my life. The day my father literally beat my dream out of me, which also started my downward spiral, eventually landing me right here in this breakroom.

After suppressing these feelings for so long and believing it was too late for myself to reignite my childhood passion, it felt weird to have them come back like this. I felt something in my eyes. Tears. I guess Ellis noticed too.

“You’re twenty-four, Jon,” he said. “Is this truly what you want to make of your life?” I tried to hide my crying, but the feelings of regret were just too strong. I put my hands over my face, and for the second time in my life, began bawling my eyes out like there was no tomorrow. It truly wasn’t what I wanted, and I couldn’t pretend like it didn’t bother me anymore.

Suddenly, Ellis grabbed me, and I instinctively put my arms around him as he wrapped me in the biggest hug I’d ever felt. I was wailing.

“This isn’t what I wanted at all,” I sobbed as I held an iron grip on Ellis. “But I feel like it’s too late already.”

“Jon, Jon,” Ellis replied.

“I’m sorry,” I said, still crying.

“Hey, hey, it’s okay, it’s okay,” he reassured as he continued to hug me.

I don’t know how long I cried for; honestly, to me it felt like an hour. As I began to calm down, I gently pushed myself off of Ellis, who let me go. I sat back down in my chair and looked at the floor once again.

“Jonathan, listen to me,” Ellis said. I looked up at him as I wiped the tears from my eyes. “You’re twenty-four years old. You still have your entire life in front of you. It’s too late for me, because, well, I’m already dead. But it’s not too late for you. You have so many years ahead of you.”

“I-I guess,” I said, still sniffling. “It’s just been so long. I don’t know if I could do it at this point. It’s been so long.” Ellis sighed, then looked around the breakroom before turning to look at me.

“Felt damn good to talk to you again,” he said warmly, “but I’m afraid I’ve got to send you back to the real world before it’s too late.” I looked at Ellis, not saying anything, as he continued. “Whatever you choose to take away from our conversation today is none of my business, but I’m gonna ask you one more time. Do you really want to spend your only shot, your one chance, endlessly slaving away at this place?” I just sat there, taking everything in, trying to think of anything to say. After an admittedly awkward silence, I spoke.

“I-I’ll think about it, I guess.” Ellis smiled as he patted me on the shoulder.

Next thing I knew, I was jolted awake by the sound of the familiar wail of the buzzer as it echoed throughout the factory. Five minutes to get back to the loading bay. Whatever that was felt like it lasted a lot longer than thirty minutes. I looked around the breakroom. The few people who were in there with me put their lunch boxes away and left the room, one of them impatiently telling me to stop slacking and get back to work before they disappeared. I just sat there, trying to comprehend what had just happened. I got through the rest of the day somehow, with the whole experience basically playing on repeat in my mind the whole time.

When I got back to the apartment about an hour ago, my mind was reeling. I wanted to believe that whatever I’d experienced had just been a really vivid dream, yet something deep inside me was telling me that it wasn’t that simple. The whole experience felt so real, and I’d felt completely awake the whole time.

After spending a few minutes watching the evening set over the city and taking a few moments to collect my thoughts, I lay down in my bed with my laptop, which is where I am right now. Seriously, that university still looks as beautiful as when I first discovered it way back then. Somehow my grades from high school remained good enough that they met the requirements for applying to their biology program—don’t ask me how. I’m hoping the job will pay well enough in the next eight months that I won’t have to apply for loans, but honestly, that’s not even a big concern of mine at this point.

I think I’ll wrap this up now and see about getting to work on my application. I still have a few weeks before the deadline, so if I start now, I should be finished well before then. Again, I’m sorry if this whole thing has come off as a mess and a bit weird, but I just have so many questions. Had I had the most vivid dream of my life? Or did Ellis, by some freak occurrence in the universe, actually bring me into his afterlife?

I guess I’ll never know for sure. I doubt anyone would even believe me if I told them about it. But if by any chance, no matter how slim, I actually did witness Ellis’ afterlife, then let me tell you, I don’t know what I’d do if I ended up like that. Eternally walking the halls of a place I never wanted to be in the first place, all the time in the world to think about what could’ve been.

I’ll end this here. I’m nervous—like, really nervous—right now. I don’t know if this will work. My application could be rejected. I could go into a ton of debt from how much this will cost me that’ll take me years to repay. Hell, maybe this won’t even lead to anything. After all, I’ve heard that biology is a competitive field right now, but I feel like I have to at least give it a shot. I have to at least try. Try to get back the life I thought I’d lost so long ago now. I have to try while I still have time. I have to try before it’s too late. I have to try before I end up walking that empty factory floor for eternity, just like Ellis.",2,1770856409.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I've looked at my other meds (bc, migraine meds, allergy meds, ect) to see if they have anything to do with my stomach issues and no luck. I still drink caffeine and eat sugary food on occasion. I can't stop the caffeine as it helps keep the smaller migraine symptoms away. I have lowered my caffeine intake drastically. I went from 7 cups of coffee down to 3. That took forever and if I completely stop caffeine (I have tried multiple times to slowly come off it) I start getting bad headaches that trigger my migraines. My neurologist highly recommended I not stop caffeine completely as it helps relax parts of my brain. I have ADHD so stimulants calm me down opposed to wire me up.

1r2esth,https://www.reddit.com/r/phhorrorstories/comments/1r2esth/i_grew_up_in_a_haunted_home/,I grew up in a haunted home,"I was around 7 years old when we moved into an old home that used to belong to my grandmother's brother and wife.

It was a dilapidated bungalow with one room and one bathroom, with an open-space layout for the kitchen, living room, and dining room. It was small, it needed repairs, but it was finally ours. We built a small maid's room and closed off the laundry area; we covered the square holes in the ceiling. Closed the terrace for good.

We have heard the stories when we used to visit. Small incidents that we chalked up to hyperactive imaginations of my titos and titas. We slept over occasionally and never really experienced it ourselves. Boy, were we wrong.

It started small: misplaced items, shadows in the corner of your eye, and whispers when you're alone. It was years after we lived in it that we realized that we each had our own experiences.

To make it more succinct, I'll write it in bullet points.

* My 4th Tito would hear heels behind him whenever he played on our desktop. He would ignore it.
* My 5th Tito felt someone brush his hair when he was playing a game on the desktop.
* My lola’s cousin would often smell coffee on the terrace, even when no one was there, and nothing had been brewed.
* I was on the phone with my 1st ex when he panicked and asked if my sister was okay. He said he suddenly heard crying in my background. I was alone.
* My cousin was trying to get into the bedroom, but heard my mom and brother playing. She waited for a bit and even peeked underneath the door. She opened the door, and there was no one there.
* I saw a woman with long dark hair in our laundry area through the kitchen window. When I checked, even though there was only one way out of the room, it was empty.
* There was a black thing reflected on the faucet… I ignored it until it got closer. I ran out covered in suds at 14.
* My cousins and I were playing hide-and-seek when I saw a boy in a white T-shirt pass by one of the jalousie windows. He looked older than all of us. Decades later, my little brother saw the same boy peeking from a corner of the house — the same white T-shirt, the same age.
* My little cousin started sleeping over for siestas. After 3 days, he refused to go. He told us he saw a child with blood in his eyes. A week later, he saw the child peeking from the sala.
* My cousin and I both saw the faucet turn on full blast. We were the only ones awake.
* I was alone with my siblings when a howling dog started roaming outside our room… it tried to talk to me.
* One nanny had someone lie down beside her and play music on her phone at 4 am.
   * I was in the bedroom playing on my laptop when she came in screaming. She was on the phone in the living room when someone blew into her ear. We were the only ones there.
   * She was holding my baby brother and standing near us while we were eating dinner. Suddenly, he leaned down to peek underneath the dining table, waved, and said, “Hi.”
* We woke up one night covered in blood while my Mom was pregnant. The blood wasn't ours.

I grew up thinking this was normal in most households. It wasn't until I reflected on it and realized it was pretty messed up.

I went to another writing group this week. 20-25 writers and we split up into several groups of 4-5 people with as many moderators as there are groups. Its in a crowded coffee shop. Stereotypical hipster, artsy vibe. Downtown near the arts district. Love all the people. Friendly and diverse.

But here is my issue. I keep getting stuck in groups with the same people. There is one guy I knew from a different group from years ago and I trust him. Published author with Penguin Press. The other 3 are different. I like them but they aren't very good writers. One other writer who's feedback I trusted, left the group. The other only comes every few weeks and she always moderates with my friend so no matter what there is no chance I can be in the group with both of them at the same time. So I definitely like the smaller groups better, instead of a bigger split up group.

But here is where I feel like a hypocrite. In the group I ran which I took over when another of my writing friends stepped down. He wanted to host the groups at his house when the bakery we hosted the group at shut down. I resisted and moved us to a new restaurant. I wanted to keep our group public so we could continue to meet new writers. Not just have our core little circle of writers in some private little country club group type of deal. And his reasoning for taking it private invite only off Meetup dot com was he wanted to make sure he was only getting critiques for more advanced writers. I resisted but now I feel like I get his point.

But I still have the desire to meet new writers, network and talk writing. But I don't want critiques from writers who don't know what they are talking about. I don't mind critiques from writers outside my genre as long as they are good writers. Does anyone else feel the same way? Lol",2,1770856140.0,writers,1,1.0,False

I’m 21F from the UK and I’m looking for a genuine friendship — something consistent and kind, not just a few messages that disappear after a day.

I’m quite creative and spend most of my time with quieter hobbies. I love film (watching and analysing), photography, reading, baking, and I crochet and knit a lot too. I’m very much a cosy-evening, tea/coffee, and working-on-a-project type of person.

I’m definitely an overthinker but in a reflective way — I like deeper conversations about life, relationships, culture, random thoughts at 11pm, that kind of thing. I’d love someone I can slowly build a proper friendship with, where we check in on each other and actually care.

There are so many different kinds of humanoids that people see, but are they all aliens? One of the most puzzling enigmas of the UFO phenomenon is the huge variation of reported humanoids. Grays, Mantids, Tall Whites, Nordics, Human-looking ETs, Blue Beings, Dwarves…the list seems endless. Complicating this is the fact that cultures across the world have been reporting a wide variety of supernatural entities. Fairies, elves, gnomes, kobalds…little people of all kinds. These so-called supernatural entities have been reported for thousands of years The question is: could some of these little people be aliens? Or vice-versa, could some of the aliens be little people? There doesn’t appear to be any easy answer to these questions. But the fact remains, there are countless reports of these kinds, and it is still going on today! This video presents ten fascinating cases, reaching back a hundred years to the current day, and coming from across the planet, where people have encountered little people which might be interpreted in different ways, elf or alien!?

AN ELF IN BRANTE, FINLAND. In 1885, a mother of three was picking berries in the forest near her home in Brante, Finland when she saw a large circular object landed on a small hill. Standing next to it was an elf-like creature holding an axe. Terrified, the woman fled the area. She returned a short time later with some other people, but the object and the elf were gone. She kept the secret for many years, finally sharing it with her granddaughter.

THE LITTLE MAN OF MONGAUP VALLEY, NY. Ron Quinn was only ten years old in August of 1942 when he was on vacation with his family in Mongaup Valley, NY. One afternoon, he was inside the cottage when he heard someone tapping on the window. Going to investigate, he was amazed to see a small man only one foot tall with long hair, a dark gray beard and large eyes wearing a green hat, a gray shirt, trousers, and soft brown boots. He was using a little cane to tap on the window. Smiling, the little man studied Ron as if he had never seen human being before. He then gestured for Ron to come closer. Ron opened the window and reached out to touch the man.

MY MYSTERIOUS FRIEND. In 1945, Galen Sharp was just five years old when an elf appeared in his home in Lakewood, CO. The little man was the same height as Galen, with large eyes, a rounded nose, and a bald head. He wore a short jacket, dark square-cut pants and worn leather shoes. He playfully introduced himself to Galen and disappeared. Over the next year, the elf reappeared several times, always when Galen was alone, and would share secret knowledge and  special stories with him and perform playful antics to make Galen laugh. One time, two elves showed up. Galen told his parents who thought he had an active imagination. But Galen got proof that the little elves were solid and real. Later he would write a series of books about consciousness, enlightenment, God and other spiritual subjects.

AN ALIEN ELF IN SAN GABRIEL, CA. It was Christmas morning in 1957 when a seven-year-old boy from San Gabriel, CA woke up to see a four-foot-tall elfish figure looking into the house from the front porch. The witness was “frozen” in bed, but watched in awe. He wanted to jump up and investigate, but was unable to move. Then he heard a message from the creature, “It’s okay now, go to sleep.” Which he did. When morning arrived, the boy shocked his parents when he had little interest in his presents. All he wanted to do was see the elf!

THE FAIRY ELF OF APPLEBY, TX. It was a cold October morning in 1976 when a lady exited her rural home in Appleby, TX to burn some trash. To her shock, a strange tall winged creature with black eyes, long white hair, and gray skin was sitting on the bench in her flower garden. It was making weird humming noises. Suddenly it blazed with a brilliant white light and heat, causing the witness to protect her eyes. As the light and heat faded, the entity was gone, leaving a strange burned spot on her bench.

The GNOME OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CO. One afternoon in 1986, a man was digging up a tree near his home in rural Walsenburg, CO. Looking at a Pinion tree about twenty feet away, he saw a tiny nine-inch-tall figure dressed in a one-piece, brown leather suit wearing a cone-shaped hat. Amazed, he watched the little man for about ten minutes, until a co-worker called out to the witness, scaring the little man away, who ran quick as a rabbit into the nearby brush.

A TINY DWARF IN ROCK CREEK CANYON, CO. It was 10:00 a.m. on Sep 6, 1989 when bow-hunter Juan Maestas was stalking a herd of elk and heard a twig snap to his left. Turning to look, he saw a three-foot-tall fat, ugly-looking dwarf creature with red hair, a wrinkled face and pink skin. The dwarf was clean-shaven and wore green overalls with suspenders and a floppy hat. The little man locked gazes with Juan, smiled at him, and darted behind a tree. He ran to find the figure, but he was gone. Unknown to him, two weeks earlier, a family of five picnicking in the area saw the same or similar figure.

THE LITTLE MAN OF ROSWELL, NM. Early one summer morning in 1997, a lady exited her yard to drink a cup of coffee on her picnic table when she noticed a little man one-foot-tall standing nearby. He had bushy eyebrows and a beard, and wore a gray woolen shirt and pants, and brown boots. The little man walked in a wobbling gait disappearing into a Chinaberry tree, and was gone.

AN ELF IN THE BLACK FOREST OF GERMANY. One day around dusk in Summer 2002, Harmut Schulze was taking a drive with two friends to their home in Mitteltal. Looking outside the window, he saw a small elf-like creature relaxing on a woodpile alongside the road. The elf was smoking a pipe watching the traffic go by. When the elf saw that Harmut could see him, he jumped up in happy surprise and began to run along with the car. He paced the car for a minute or two, but Harmut was so shocked, he continued to drive. He asked his girlfriend if she saw the little guy, and she said yes, she did! The other passenger in the car saw nothing.

THE LITTLE MEN OF ROUGH RIVER STATE PARK, KY. On the afternoon of Jun 24, 2003, a man was canoeing along the river when he found a strange clay pot with tiny little handprints on it. Hearing high-pitched laughter, he looked up and saw two little men, each about ten inches in height, with pale skin, red hair, and blue eyes. They were shirtless but wore leather pants with suspenders and little pointed hats. Soon more little people appeared. The little men were working to pull a stump with ropes. There was a loud banging noise and all of them disappeared.

These encounters with little people of all kinds challenge what we think we know about Earth, the extraterrestrial presence on our planet, and intelligent life in this universe. Perhaps some of the little creatures that people report are not aliens at all, but are elves, fairies, gnomes, and dwarves. Sometimes things are not always what they seem!

I’ve enjoyed our machine for 1.5 years. I’m not perfect about maintenance but I try to keep the brew group clean, change the water filter, and have descaled when the machine has called for it. Recently the taste from the coffee disappeared overnight. It just lacks any coffee characteristics. Lattes that used to have the tasting notes of the coffee come through all that dairy dilution has completely disappeared. So far I’ve tried the following.

1. Cleaned the brew group extensively. 

2. Replaced all the seals using a kit recommended here. 

3. Ran three sessions of oil remover tablets through. Big black flakes/chunks came out in each session but by the last flush in each session they would all run clear. The flavor maybe improved maybe a bit? I started with a 15 minute soak and by the third it was up to 30 minutes of soaking. 

4. Descaled the machine and changed water filter. 

5. Tried different beans.

Is there anything else I try? I have five more oil remover tablets. Do I keep going with those?

The cookies are crisp and buttery, while the chocolate inside is fairly sweet and melts easily. The contrast between the crunchy cookie and soft chocolate makes it fun to eat.

English is not my first language so I apologize for any mistakes!

Backstory:

My BF and I have been living together since june 2022. We are living and renovating an old house, and its been really tough since we literally had to change everything, for example - a house didn’t even have proper flooring, electricity nor proper water system. We did so much in those 4 years, but it’s nowhere near finished. Renovating was financially hard, we had to take out loans and sacrifice so much of our personal wants and needs.

We went on a vacation only once, and we barely ever go on dates - maybe 5 times a year and it’s something simple, such as getting coffee in our local coffee shop..

so, my partner and i talked and he decided to go to another country to work for 6 months a year in the next couple of years so we can finish the house and pay off the loans. I cannot go, as I’m also in college (we are both in our late 20s, and i have 2 more years since i started collage at 24). The pay is like 3 times what he makes here, so that’s the main reason.

I’m an emotional wreck. Like, yeah, I can survive 6 months and can visit him sometime, but it won’t be just this year. Now, I cannot even focus on my studies and work. I think he is accepting the situation way too easly, and even he says it will be easier for him. He also worked on a ship before we met, so it’s not new to him.

I’m feeling kinda hopeless. Maybe it’s me, but I feel like I cannot deal with this. How can partners live together for almost half a decade, and than apart for just as much? How can that be a healthy relationship?

He will go to work in a new country, surrounded by new people, new culture. I know it won’t be as hard for him, he will be preocuppied with all those experiences, majority if not all happy I hope!

I will stay here. In the house we started building our lives, in the city I moved to when we decided to live together, so it’s not even my home town.

I also struggle with anxiety, and I’m really terriefied and I cannot focus on anything.

""Any resemblance to real stories is purely coincidental.""","Chapter 1 – Are You Worth 600 Reais? 

It was the winter of 2025, more precisely June 18th. As usual, I was walking my dog in the afternoon, before it got dark. That’s when I bumped into someone I knew: Antony. He wasn’t looking where he was going. I saw him, but I didn’t step aside or warn him to look ahead. 

He apologized without even looking me in the eyes and kept walking, his face glued to his phone and a smile that suggested he was getting exactly what he wanted. 

The moment his face turned toward me, his expression changed so intensely that even I was startled. The smile gave way to a concern mixed with fear. But we weren’t close enough for me to care about him or what he was feeling. 

I work at a chain of motels in the city. It’s a job that brings laughs and even some embarrassing moments. I’ve attended pastors, conservatives, and curious family men exploring their… “lives.” However, last Thursday, Antony sent me a message on my personal WhatsApp asking about room prices and my working hours. 

I found it strange, but since he was a potential customer, I replied in the standard way:   
standard room, 2 hours – R$ 60; 3 hours – R$ 75.   
Suite, 2 hours – R$ 90, and so on. 

As for my schedule, I was vague: a 5x2 shift rotation, with variable days off. He thanked me and disappeared for a few days. 

Then, suddenly, Antony showed up at the reception of the motel where I work. As soon as he walked through the main door and saw me, he turned pale. You could see the color drain from his face and the smile vanish. 

To my surprise, he wasn’t alone. He was accompanied by an older man, who took the initiative to come to the counter and reserve the room. 

I followed the standard procedure: greeted them and asked for their documents.   
The man’s name was José, he was 57 years old, and judging by the ring on his finger, I assumed he was married.   
Antony was 27 and seemed far too terrified to even look at me. 

I ignored the obvious discomfort and continued working. 

They reserved a standard room and requested one far from the main entrance. I handed over the key and wished them a pleasant stay. 

The day went on normally, with customers coming and going. Antony and Mr. José had already left when I finished my shift. It was a busy and exhausting day. 

One or two days later, I heard a commotion in the street. Antony’s mother claimed she had been robbed: R$ 600 had disappeared from her wallet. My town doesn’t have a frequent history of theft, especially in that area. Because of that, she went from person to person asking who had been to her house. 

Antony helped his mother with the search, appearing very outraged about the missing money. 

Time passed, the search continued amid frustration and suspicion, until the subject began to be forgotten. But the peace didn’t last long. 

One day, Antony’s mother and father began shouting at and assaulting him in broad daylight. In anger, we don’t measure our words. His mother screamed that Antony would have to go to the motel where I worked and demand the money back, because he had no right to steal — after all, she hadn’t raised him for that. 

I watched everything from my house window, drinking coffee, when Antony’s mother looked at me and shouted for me to come outside because she needed to talk to me. 

She questioned what Antony had gone to do at the motel and why I had let him enter. I replied that my job was not to question, but to serve customers, and that he had gone there accompanied by a man for about two hours. 

When she heard that, Antony’s mother slapped him so hard that the sound echoed for two blocks. She demanded to know who the man was, but Antony didn’t answer. His father left shortly afterward, perhaps to avoid doing something worse. 

Later, I saw the mother pushing Antony toward the house, saying he would never see the light of day again. 

That’s when a thought wouldn’t leave my head:   
the room Antony reserved cost R$ 60. 

Where were the other R$ 540? 

Some time later, my sister, who was closer to Antony, cleared up my doubt.   
The money wasn’t just for the room — it was for Mr. José. 

Antony had paid José to have sex with him. 

Neither my sister nor I told José’s wife or Antony’s mother. We didn’t want to get involved in a fight that had already gone too far. 

But the only thing echoing in my mind was:

I was having symptoms but had absolutely no clue that it was my fatty liver. I would have constant headaches, nausea at night, side pain, and felt tired all the time. Thought it was because of all these other reasons and not thinking it was because I had NAFLD. My mom was diagnosed a few months prior to me.

Now, when I eat certain things I can feel the effect it has on me and it will sometimes take 2-3 days before I feel good again. What I find interesting is that one food will make me itch, or another nausea, certain things will make me tired and nauseous. Anyone else notice this?

My absolute no's are hot dogs and Domino's pizza. I feel horrible after each time I eat that. Which is often what is on the menu for family birthday get togethers.

1. Yogurt for breakfast
2. Salad with Protein for lunch
3. A ""Diabetes"" plate for dinner. 1/4 meat, 1/4 carb, 1/2 vegetable

I've learned that fried food is something I need to stay away from.

I now use avocado oil and olive oil at home. Try to avoid using butter.

I need to limit my carbs and aim for no more than 3 serving a day. Even better if I make it myself or get whole grains.

Sugar is a treat but if I need a sweetner I'll use honey or maple syrup.

Red meat is a treat, that I'll have and aim to limit it once a week. I tend to make tuna, salmon, turkey or chicken now. Stay away from processed meat (Bacon was the hard one for me)

About 2 cups a fruit a day. Love berries and melon.

Vegetables I can usually load up on and can make them for half of my plate.

I haven't had alcohol since then, and avoid other sugary beverages. Lots of coffee and green or herbal tea or fruit infused water.

I've lost about 40 lbs since then but have even more to lose to get to a healthy weight.

Lifting weights and swimming was what worked for me for exercise. Hopeful to start that back up again here soon.

This article extends the fractal-holographic architectonic of knowledge, previously articulated on classical analogy, dual categories, and the golden ratio, to the terrain where quantum physics and philosophy of mind converge. It argues that **quantum** and **quale** constitute a dual categorial pair of maximum radicality: the quantum is the minimal unit of *exterior* determination (objective, measurable), while the quale is the minimal unit of *interior* determination (subjective, experienced). Both exhibit, each from their own aspect, fractal and holographic properties that replicate the general structure of the analogical framework. Quantum entanglement and the holographic principle of theoretical physics reveal that the quantum encodes information of the whole in each part; the unity of consciousness and the recursive structure of experience reveal that the quale contains, in each singular lived experience, the reference to the complete field of the conscious. Between both, as between all dual categories of the system, the golden ratio mediates as the formal operator of non-reductive complementarity. The article explores these connections with rigor, points out pertinent historical convergences, and honestly delimits the speculative scope of the proposal.

**Keywords:** quanta, qualia, consciousness, quantum mechanics, holographic principle, fractal, analogy, golden ratio, duality, hard problem of consciousness.

# Introduction

In the preceding article it was established that knowledge can be organized under a **fractal-holographic** architecture articulated by the two classical forms of analogy, proportionality and attribution, and mediated by the golden ratio. The **dual categories** of the philosophical tradition (act/potency, form/matter, one/multiple, essence/existence) functioned as recursive generators of that architecture: each pair, when applied to itself, produced a self-similar branching where the part reproduced the structure of the whole (fractal) and each node retained the reference to being as primary analogate (hologram).

However, a question remains pending that this framework urgently invites us to formulate: **Is there a categorial pair that operates on the very frontier between the objective and the subjective, between matter and consciousness, and that exhibits the same fractal-holographic structure?**

The thesis of this article is that this pair exists and is constituted by **quanta** and **qualia**.

The **quantum,** the discrete and indivisible unit of action, energy, or information in physics, represents the minimal grain of *exterior* reality: the most elementary thing that can be measured, transferred, or objectively exchanged. The **quale,** the irreducible quality of subjective conscious experience, the *what-it-is-like* of red, of pain, of melody, represents the minimal grain of *interior* reality: the most elementary thing that can be lived, felt, or perceived in the first person.

Both share a fundamental property: they are **irreducible**. The quantum cannot be divided without ceasing to be a quantum; the quale cannot be decomposed without ceasing to be experience. And both, as will be demonstrated, exhibit the same fractal and holographic properties that define the general architecture of knowledge, projected respectively onto the plane of the measurable and the plane of the livable.

**Thesis statement.** *Quanta and qualia constitute the dual categorial pair exterior/interior within the fractal-holographic architectonic of knowledge. Each of them replicates, from their aspect, the double fractal structure (self-similarity across scales) and holographic structure (encoding of the whole in each part) of the general analogical framework. The golden ratio mediates between both as the formal operator of a complementarity that is neither identity (reductive materialism) nor absolute separation (Cartesian dualism), but proportional analogy.*

# 1. The Quantum: Minimal Grain of Exterior Reality

# 1.1. What is a Quantum

In 1900, Max Planck introduced the hypothesis that energy is neither emitted nor absorbed continuously, but in **discrete packets** —*quanta*— whose magnitude is proportional to the frequency of radiation. The proportionality constant, *h* (Planck's constant), fixes the scale of the quantum: it is the finest ""grain"" of physical action.

What was revolutionary about this idea was not only its empirical content, but its ontological implication: **physical reality has a discrete texture at its most fundamental level**. There is no perfect continuity; there are jumps, transitions, indivisible units. The quantum is the minimal unit of objective determination: below it, the very notion of ""measurement"" loses meaning.

# 1.2. Quantum Dualities as Dual Categories

Quantum mechanics is traversed by **dualities** that replicate the structure of classical categorial pairs:

* **Wave / Particle.** Every quantum entity manifests as a wave (continuous, extended, potential) or as a particle (discrete, localized, actual), depending on the experimental context. This duality is *functionally analogous* to the pair **potency / act**: the wave function describes the complete spectrum of possible states (potency), and measurement collapses that superposition into a definite state (act).
* **Position / Momentum.** Heisenberg's uncertainty principle establishes that the position and momentum of a particle cannot be simultaneously determined with arbitrary precision. This pair is analogous to **form / matter**: complete determination of one aspect (form) implies indetermination of the complementary (matter), and vice versa.
* **Observable / State.** The distinction between what is observed (the observable) and the system that carries the possibilities of observation (the quantum state) replicates the duality **essence / existence**: the observable defines *what* is measured; the state defines *that* something is there to be measured.

These dualities are not mere terminological coincidences. They are **structural isomorphisms**: the same proportional relationship (determinant : determinable) reappears in each pair, both at the classical ontological level and at the quantum level. This is, precisely, what the analogy of proportionality predicts and what fractal structure requires: **the same relational form is reproduced at a different scale of being**.

# 1.3. The Quantum as Fractal Entity

Quantum physics exhibits self-similarity at multiple levels. The **renormalization group**, developed by Kenneth Wilson, shows that quantum field theories possess an explicitly fractal structure: when changing the scale of observation, the equations transform following a flow that can have **fixed points,** scales at which the theory replicates itself exactly. Physics at a fixed point of the renormalization group is **self-similar**: fluctuations at small scale have the same statistical structure as fluctuations at large scale.

Furthermore, the very structure of the quantum vacuum, with its virtual fluctuations at all scales, has been described as a fractal ""foam"" (John Wheeler, 1955), where the geometry of spacetime becomes irregular and self-similar at the Planck scale.

The quantum, therefore, is not only discrete; it is a **generator of self-similarity**: the minimal unit whose iteration produces the complexity of the physical world following patterns that replicate across scales. This links it directly to the fractal moment of the architectonic.

# 1.4. The Quantum as Holographic Entity

The **holographic principle**, formulated by Gerard 't Hooft (1993) and Leonard Susskind (1995), constitutes one of the most profound results of contemporary theoretical physics. It establishes that **all the information contained in a volume of space can be encoded on its two-dimensional boundary**, analogously to how an optical hologram encodes a three-dimensional image on a two-dimensional plate.

The implication is astonishing: **each region of space contains, in principle, the information of the whole**. Deep physical reality would be, literally, holographic. The developments of the **AdS/CFT correspondence** (Juan Maldacena, 1997) have provided rigorous mathematical evidence that a gravitational theory in an *n*\-dimensional space is exactly equivalent to a quantum field theory on its boundary of *n−1* dimensions. The whole (the volume) is encoded in the part (the surface).

Quantum entanglement reinforces this holographic dimension: two entangled particles, however distant they may be, form an **indivisible system** where the measurement of one instantaneously determines the state of the other. Each particle ""contains"" the information of the other, and, by extension, of the complete system. Quantum non-locality is a direct manifestation of the holographic structure of physical reality.

David Bohm, whose notion of **implicate order** was invoked in the preceding article, was precisely a quantum physicist. His proposal of non-local hidden variables (*De Broglie-Bohm theory*) was an explicit attempt to formulate quantum mechanics as an **unfolding** (explication) of a **folded order** (implication) where each particle is connected with the totality of the universe. The quantum, in the Bohmian interpretation, is a holographic fragment of the whole.

# 2. The Quale: Minimal Grain of Interior Reality

# 2.1. What is a Quale

The term *quale* (plural: *qualia*) designates the **subjective and irreducible quality** of a conscious experience. The red I see when looking at a poppy, the pain I feel when burning myself, the taste of coffee in the morning: each of these lived experiences has a *what-it-is-like* (in Thomas Nagel's expression) that is not exhausted in any objective description of neural processes, wavelengths, or synaptic activations.

The philosopher David Chalmers called the question about the relationship between physical processes and qualia the **""hard problem"" of consciousness**: why and how do objective brain processes give rise to subjective experiences? Why are we not ""zombies"" that process information without feeling anything? The difficulty is not empirical —we know quite a bit about neural correlates— but **conceptual**: no amount of information about the objective functioning of the brain seems to *logically imply* the existence of subjective experience.

The quale is, in this sense, the **minimal unit of interior determination**: the most elementary thing that can be experienced *in the first person*. Just as the quantum is indivisible from outside (it cannot be fractionated without ceasing to be a quantum), the quale is indivisible from inside (it cannot be decomposed into parts that are, themselves, simpler experiences without losing its specific quality).

# 2.2. Dualities of Conscious Experience as Dual Categories

Conscious experience exhibits its own internal dualities, which replicate, analogically, classical categories:

* **Content / Consciousness-of.** Every act of experience has a content (that which is experienced: a color, a sound) and an intentional direction (the fact of *being-conscious-of* that content). This duality is analogous to **matter / form**: content is the determinable; intentionality is the determinant.
* **Figure / Ground.** In perception, there is always a focal element (figure) that stands out against a peripheral field (ground). This duality is analogous to **act / potency**: the figure is what is actually perceived; the ground is what is potentially perceptible.
* **Unity / Multiplicity of Experience.** At each instant, consciousness is **one,** a unified field, and simultaneously **multiple,** it contains a plurality of qualia (color, sound, emotion, thought). This is, directly, the duality **one / multiple** applied to the interior domain.

The same proportional relationship (determinant : determinable) that operates in quantum dualities reappears here, in the domain of subjective experience. **The proportion repeats across a radical change of scale and domain**: from quantum (exterior) to quale (interior). This is analogy of proportionality in its most radical expression, and confirms the fractal dimension of knowledge.

# 2.3. The Quale as Fractal Entity

Conscious experience exhibits **recursive self-similarity**. When examining any quale with introspective attention, one discovers that it contains sub-qualia that replicate the structure of the larger quale:

* The quale of *wine taste* contains sub-qualia of acidity, sweetness, astringency, aroma, temperature, texture. Each of these sub-qualia contains, in turn, finer nuances.
* The quale of *a melody* contains the qualia of each note, and each note contains qualia of timbre, intensity, duration. And each timbre, harmonic sub-qualia.
* The quale of *an emotion* —say, nostalgia— contains components of sadness, sweetness, visual memory, bodily sensation, affective tone, each with its own qualitative texture.

Experience **branches inward** following a self-similar pattern: the structure ""unified field with internal differentiations"" repeats at each level of introspective analysis. Each quale is an **experiential microcosm** that replicates the form of the total conscious field. This is fractal structure applied to the interior domain.

# 2.4. The Quale as Holographic Entity

The most notable property of conscious experience is its **unity**: the multiple qualia that coexist in an instant of consciousness are not isolated fragments, but moments of a **unitary field** of experience. This is the famous **binding problem** in neuroscience: how are the distributed processes of the brain integrated into a unified experience?

From the holographic perspective, the answer is structural: **each quale contains the reference to the complete field of consciousness**. One cannot experience red *without* the background of the entire perceptual field; one cannot feel pain *without* the affective tonality of the present moment in its totality. Each quale is a fragment that *carries* the conscious whole, exactly as each fragment of a hologram carries the complete image.

This intuition was precisely formulated by **William James** in his concept of *stream of consciousness*: each moment of experience is not an isolated atom, but a pulse of the total flow, which contains within itself resonances of the immediate past (*fringes*) and anticipations of the near future. The temporal ""whole"" of consciousness is encoded —with lower resolution— in each singular instant.

Edmund Husserl, from phenomenology, arrived at a convergent conclusion: each intentional act of consciousness implies a **horizon,** a field of perceptual, memoristic, and anticipatory possibilities, that constitutes the ""whole"" of experience, present in latent form in each particular act. **The Husserlian horizon is the hologram of consciousness.**

# 3. Quantum and Quale as Fundamental Dual Categorial Pair

# 3.1. The Exterior/Interior Duality

If quanta are the minimal units of determination of *exterior* reality (objective, measurable, in third person) and qualia are the minimal units of determination of *interior* reality (subjective, experienced, in first person), then **quantum and quale form a dual categorial pair of maximum radicality**: the duality *exterior/interior* or, in classical philosophical terminology, the duality *extension/thought* that Descartes identified as the two irreducible substances.

However, the fractal-holographic framework does not force a Cartesian dualism. Categorial pairs are not separate substances, but **constitutive complementarities**: act and potency do not exist as independent entities, but as co-determining aspects of every real being. Similarly, quantum and quale need not be posited as ontologically separate substances, but as the **two faces of a single reality** grasped from complementary perspectives: the measurable face and the livable face.

This position, which in philosophy of mind is called **dual-aspect monism,** has a venerable history. **Baruch Spinoza** formulated it by identifying extension and thought as two attributes of a single infinite substance. **Wolfgang Pauli and Carl Gustav Jung** explored it in their correspondence about the relationship between quantum physics and psyche, proposing that matter and mind are complementary aspects of an underlying *unus mundus* reality. **David Bohm** took it up again by suggesting that the implicate order could have both a physical aspect (matter) and a mental aspect (meaning), both being partial unfoldings of an undivided totality.

# 3.2. The Analogy of Proportionality Between Quanta and Qualia

The relationship between quanta and qualia satisfies the canonical form of the analogy of proportionality:

>The quantum is to exterior reality what the quale is to interior reality.

Or, with greater precision:

>The wave function is to quantum measurement what the horizon of consciousness is to the focal perception of the quale.  

Quantum superposition is to decoherence what experiential potentiality is to perceptual actualization.  

Quantum entanglement is to physical non-locality what the unity of consciousness is to the co-presence of qualia.

In each case, the **same proportion** (potential : actual, whole : part, indeterminate : determinate) is reproduced in the two domains. This is pure fractal structure: a single relational pattern that appears on both sides of the frontier between the objective and the subjective.

# 3.3. The Analogy of Attribution: Being as Primary Analogate of Quanta and Qualia

Both quanta and qualia **are**: both participate in being, although in radically different ways. Being, understood as the act of existing, functions as **primary analogate** of which both quantum reality and qualitative reality are derivative analogates. Each quantum ""is"" objectively; each quale ""is"" subjectively. Neither exhausts the full meaning of *being*, but both carry and reflect it from their particular perspective.

This is the holographic dimension of the quantum/quale pair: **each encodes, from their aspect, a reference to being in its totality**. The quantum, as the minimal unit of the physical world, contains inscribed the logic of natural order (physical laws, fundamental constants, the structure of spacetime). The quale, as the minimal unit of the conscious world, contains inscribed the logic of meaning (intentionality, valuation, significance). Together, they carry, like two fragments of a hologram, the complete image of being, although with different resolutions and perspectives.

# 4. The Golden Ratio as Mediation Between Quantum and Quale

# 4.1. The Problem of Mediation

If quantum and quale are the two faces of reality —exterior and interior— the question inevitably arises: **how do they relate?** How is it possible for the same reality to admit both a quantum description and a qualitative description without either reducing to the other?

Historical answers have oscillated between two extremes:

* **Reductive materialism** affirms that qualia are ""identical to"" or ""nothing but"" quantum-neural states. This is equivalent to **univocity**: quantum and quale would ultimately mean the same thing.
* **Cartesian dualism** affirms that quantum and quale belong to ontologically separate and irreducible substances. This is equivalent to **equivocity**: quantum and quale would have nothing in common.

Analogy, as *via media*, requires a relationship of **non-reductive proportionality**: quantum and quale are distinct but not unconnected; irreducible but not incommunicado. And the golden ratio, as argued in the preceding article, is precisely the **formal point where this proportionality is optimally realized**.

# 4.2. φ as Proportion of Complementarity

Let us recall the defining property of φ:

φ = 1 + 1/φ

The whole (φ) contains unity (1) plus the reciprocal part of the whole (1/φ). This means that the relationship of the whole to the greater part is **the same** as the relationship of the greater part to the lesser part. There is no unbalanced asymmetry nor trivial symmetry: there is **harmonic asymmetry**.

Applied to the quantum/quale pair, this suggests that:

* The relationship of **total reality** (being) to the **quantum** (its exterior aspect) maintains the same proportion as the relationship of the **quantum** to the **quale** (its interior aspect).
* Neither is subordinated to the other; both **co-implicate** each other according to a constant proportional ratio.
* The ""distance"" between the objective and the subjective is not an unbridgeable abyss nor a hidden identity, but a **proportional difference**—the same difference that, at another level, separates and unites act and potency, form and matter.

# 4.3. Tononi's Φ and φ of the Golden Ratio: A Suggestive Convergence

In 2004, neuroscientist **Giulio Tononi** proposed the **Integrated Information Theory** (IIT), according to which consciousness is identical to the **integrated information** of a system, measured by a quantity he called **Φ** (capital phi). A system is conscious to the extent that it generates information that is simultaneously **differentiated** (each state is distinct from the others: multiplicity) and **integrated** (the system cannot be decomposed into independent parts: unity).

Tononi's choice of the symbol Φ was, according to his statements, conventional and not motivated by the golden ratio. However, the conceptual convergence is notable:

* **Tononi's Φ** measures the degree to which a system integrates differentiation and unification, that is, the degree to which it resolves the one/multiple duality.
* The **φ of the golden ratio** is the mathematical point where the difference between part and whole becomes internally proportional, that is, where the part/whole duality resolves in harmony.

Both φ/Φ designate an **optimum of integration of opposites**: the first in the plane of consciousness, the second in the plane of mathematical proportion. That both share symbol and function—measuring the harmony between unity and diversity, suggests, at least, a **structural isomorphy** that the fractal-holographic analogical framework allows us to articulate with coherence.

# 5. Implications for the Organization of Knowledge

# 5.1. The Complete Map: Dual Categories from Being to Consciousness

Incorporating quanta and qualia into the system of dual categories, we obtain a **chain of complementary pairs** that traverses all levels of reality:

|Categorial Pair|Domain|Fractal Moment|Holographic Moment|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Act / Potency|General ontology|Same proportion at each level of being|Every being refers to pure act|
|Form / Matter|Natural philosophy|Same proportion in each composite being|Every form reflects the formal order of cosmos|
|Essence / Existence|Metaphysics|Same proportion in each finite being|Every existent refers to subsistent being|
|One / Multiple|Transcendentals|Same proportion in each totality|Every unity contains reference to absolute unity|
|Wave / Particle|Quantum mechanics|Same duality at all subatomic scales|Each entangled particle encodes the total system|
|**Quantum / Quale**|**Matter-consciousness frontier**|**Same determinant/determinable proportion in exterior and interior**|**Each quantum and each quale carry reference to total being**|
|Content / Intentionality|Phenomenology|Same proportion in each conscious act|Each act carries the complete horizon of consciousness|

Each row is a **scale** of the categorial fractal. The same proportional relationship (column ""Fractal Moment"") replicates from row to row: this is self-similarity across domains. And in each row, each member of the pair contains the reference to the primary analogate (column ""Holographic Moment""): this is the encoding of the whole in the part.

# 5.2. Interdisciplinarity as Structural Consequence

If quanta and qualia are complementary aspects of the same reality, articulated by the same analogical proportion that governs all other categorial pairs, then the separation between **natural sciences** (which study quanta and their complexifications) and **human sciences** (which study qualia and their articulations) is a **methodologically legitimate but ontologically provisional abstraction**. At bottom, both sets of sciences investigate the same reality from complementary perspectives, and the fractal-holographic structure of knowledge guarantees that **delving sufficiently deep into either necessarily leads, by internal necessity, toward the other**.

This explains phenomena such as:

* The fact that **quantum physics** has been unable to eliminate the reference to the observer (the conscious subject) from its formalism: the quale inevitably appears in the heart of the quantum.
* The fact that **neuroscience** cannot account for qualia without referring to quantum physical processes or, at least, to the objective structure of the brain: the quantum inevitably appears in the heart of the quale.
* The fact that the most ambitious unification proposals —Bohm, Penrose-Hameroff, Tononi's IIT— converge on the intuition that **consciousness and matter are co-original**, not derived from one another.

# 5.3. The Golden Ratio as Integration Criterion

At a practical level, the golden ratio offers a **heuristic criterion** for the integration of knowledge from different domains: an interdisciplinary synthesis is *proportionate* when it preserves the relative autonomy of each discipline (does not fuse them: avoids univocity) without isolating them in incommunicado compartments (does not separate them: avoids equivocity). The equilibrium point —neither fusion nor fragmentation— is the epistemological analogue of the φ ratio: a **harmonic asymmetry** where each part preserves its identity but reflects, in its own way, the structure of the whole.

# 6. Precedents and Convergences

# 6.1. Philosophical Tradition

The idea that interior and exterior are complementary aspects of a unitary reality runs through the history of philosophy:

* **Aristotle** attributed to *nous* (intellect) the capacity to ""become all things"", a holographic property of mind, which replicates within itself the structure of the real.
* **Thomas Aquinas** affirmed that *anima est quodammodo omnia* (""the soul is, in some way, all things""): each act of knowledge intentionally reproduces the form of the known object, so that the mind contains a ""hologram"" of the world.
* **Leibniz** conceived each monad as a ""living mirror of the universe"" that perceives, confusedly or clearly, the totality of the real from its irreducible perspective.
* **Alfred North Whitehead**, in *Process and Reality* (1929), proposed that each ""actual occasion"" is a subjective synthesis that integrates (*prehends*) the totality of its past universe: the whole is encoded in each act of experience.

# 6.2. Contemporary Physics and Neuroscience

* **Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff** (Orch-OR theory, 1996) proposed that consciousness emerges from coherent quantum processes in neuronal microtubules, situating the quantum/quale interface in a specific biological structure. Although controversial, the proposal illustrates the intuition that the contact point between the objective and subjective might be found at the quantum level.
* **David Bohm** explicitly suggested that his implicate order could have a *somatosignificant* aspect (soma = body = quantum; meaning = mind = quale), where matter and meaning mutually co-implicate.
* **Giulio Tononi** (IIT) formalized the idea that consciousness is integrated information, providing a quantitative framework where the differentiation/integration duality (fractal/holographic) generates the measure of consciousness.
* The **holographic principle** ('t Hooft, Susskind, Maldacena) establishes that holographic structure is not a philosophical metaphor, but a demonstrated property of fundamental theoretical physics.

# 6.3. The Pauli-Jung Convergence

The correspondence between physicist **Wolfgang Pauli** and psychologist **Carl Gustav Jung** (1932-1958) deserves special mention. Both sought a framework that would unify quantum phenomena (quanta) and psychic phenomena (qualia) under a common principle they called **synchronicity**: meaningful non-causal connections between physical events and mental states. Although synchronicity remains a debated concept, its underlying motivation —the need for an ordering principle that encompasses both exterior and interior— coincides exactly with the function that the golden ratio fulfills in our framework: **a proportionality operator that mediates between quanta and qualia without reducing one to the other**.

# 7. Cautions and Limits

# 7.1. Controlled Speculation

It is essential to recognize that the connection between quanta, qualia, and the golden ratio has, in its current state, a **programmatic and heuristic character**, not demonstrative. We do not have an equation that derives qualia from quanta nor a mathematical proof that φ governs the relationship between consciousness and matter. What we offer is an **architectonic**: an organizational framework that reveals **structural isomorphies** between domains that are usually treated separately, and that generates hypotheses and intuitions worthy of further exploration.

# 7.2. The Hard Problem Remains

The fractal-holographic framework **does not resolve** the hard problem of consciousness. Describing it as a dual categorial pair (quantum/quale) does not explain *why* subjective experience exists. What the framework does offer is a **conceptual topology** where to situate the problem: the frontier between exterior and interior is not an inexplicable abyss, but a particular case of the categorial duality that runs through all levels of being. This does not dissolve the mystery, but **contextualizes** it within a broader structure.

# 7.3. The Temptation of Pythagoreanism

Attributing to the golden ratio a mediating role between matter and consciousness may sound like **numerical mysticism**. The caution is legitimate. The answer is that φ is not invoked here as the efficient cause of the quantum-quale relationship, but as the **proportional form** that this relationship exemplifies: a harmonic asymmetry where part and whole co-determine each other without reducing to each other. The golden ratio is a *structural model*, not a causal mechanism.

# 7.4. Openness to Non-Dual Structures

As noted in the preceding article, dual categories do not exhaust the real. Peirce's **thirdness**, the **trinity** of Christian theology, the **trialectic** of various traditions, suggest that there are dimensions of reality that resist organization in pairs. The framework proposed here must remain open to extensions that incorporate ternary and more complex structures, without thereby abandoning the fecundity of duality as primary generator.

# Conclusion

This article has extended the fractal-holographic architectonic of knowledge to the terrain where physics and philosophy of mind converge, arguing that **quanta** and **qualia** constitute the most radical dual categorial pair of the system: the *exterior/interior* duality, the frontier between the measurable and the livable.

It has been shown that quanta exhibit **fractal** properties (self-similarity across scales, renormalization group, quantum foam) and **holographic** properties (holographic principle, entanglement, Bohm's implicate order). Parallelly, it has been shown that qualia exhibit **fractal** properties (introspective recursivity, self-similar sub-qualia) and **holographic** properties (unity of consciousness, Husserlian horizon, Jamesian stream of consciousness). Both domains replicate, each from their aspect, the double structure of the general analogical framework: **the same relationship is reproduced at multiple scales** (fractal, analogy of proportionality) and **each part contains the reference to the whole** (hologram, analogy of attribution).

Between both domains —as between all categorial pairs of the system— the **golden ratio** mediates as the formal operator of non-reductive complementarity: neither identity (materialism) nor separation (dualism), but **harmonic asymmetry**, analogous proportion, *via media*.

The convergence between Tononi's Φ of Integrated Information Theory and the φ of the golden ratio, although not deductive, proves suggestive: both measure the **optimal degree of integration between unity and diversity**, the first in the plane of consciousness, the second in the plane of mathematical form. That they share symbol and function invites, at least, deeper investigation.

Ultimately, what this architectonic proposes is that human knowledge —in its totality, from particle physics to the phenomenology of experience— possesses a **unitary deep grammar**: an analogical grammar where each level reproduces the structure of the whole, where each part carries the reference to the principle, and where the proportion between the exterior and the interior, between quantum and quale, obeys the same harmonic ratio that governs the relationship between act and potency, between form and matter, between the one and the multiple.

*That the minimal unit of matter and the minimal unit of consciousness share the same relational architecture does not demonstrate that they are the same thing —analogy is not identity— but it does reveal that they inhabit a single order: an order that is said in many ways, but not equivocally, and whose internal rhythm —fractal in its repetition, holographic in its plenitude— traces, in each fragment of the real, the silhouette of the whole.*

Weather: mild and sunny winter day!

Setting: day off; night at work; grandma’s house

Fragrance House: alloy studio -

“an experimental fragrance house.

based in NYC, the alloy studio creates perfumes and scented goods that feel like an extension of your style. we utilize beauty, fashion, and setting to tell stories through scent. our perfumes are made for invisible glamour. they can be your statement piece, or your armor. 

house codes

we use perfume to subvert, redefine, and glamorize. 

we use rare ingredients of the highest caliber, with a quality over quantity practice. our fragrances are hand batched and bottled in house, in nyc. 

our fragrances are generously dosed and considered ""eau de parfum"" or ""parfum"".

collaboration with artists, craftsmen, and creative talent is always our way. 

our fragrances are vegan & cruelty free.”

On the vision: “In our line, silver and gold respectively represent the spirit of collaboration and yin and yang between my partner and I. As we were creating the alloy studio together, we wanted to reflect our individual tastes and imaginations which resulted in the division of gold and silver. Gold represents my outlook on perfumery, often featuring a sense of ethereality and richness. Silver represents Eddie’s desires in perfume, featuring subversive, experimental concepts and ideas. These two elements form an alloy, something beautiful made through combination.”

Charity: “10% of all sales for the month of February will be donated to the National Immigrant Justice Center, and the Ali Forney Center.”

Gender: unisex

Notes - “hypnotic nectar evokes an encounter with a den in a beautifully overgrown forest. there are no signs of life other than strangely luminous florals and fungi. 

the den is inhabited by an abnormally glamorous shaman dressed in fabulous wooden jewelry. they welcome you warmly with a bitter botanical potion instead of tea or coffee. the shaman promises you the beverage will bring enlightenment and abundance. as you sip, you notice a luminescent glow coming from your chest, and your fingers begin to flower…

I find it fascinating how the florals do read yellow, and yet despite being floral it does give unisex. Though it may lean the direction the wearer presents, so for me it doesn’t feel unfeminine! My partner mentioned it (almost? I forget what he said) smells like cologne, but I disagree! It’s worth noting for sure! It’s like clean but worn and a warming scent I think could work across seasons?

First instinct, would I full size: yes! I love this scent, it smells like me and like a best friend’s mom’s home cooking in childhood that became part of one’s own core being. I can’t stop sniffing.

So this is the part I feel really guilty about. I don’t know what made me do this and I cringe everytime I think about it. The one with the booty was working. We talked a little bit and I ordered my coffee. Then I said something  like “I like the videos of you twerking” at first she didn’t seem phased by it. Then when I paid for the coffee and gave a small tip in the jar. (I didn’t have much cash on me) She got very angry. She gave me a look and said something along the lines of “for the comments you have been making about me you need to tip extra” I just said sorry and left. I felt extreme anxiety that day and thought she was going to call the cops and I was going to get charged with sexual harassment. That was over a year ago and thank god nothing happened. She doesn’t work there anymore and I think I was one of the reasons. (I know I was being a creep and like said earlier I don’t know why I did this) The girl with the boobs also doesn’t work there anymore. I unfortunately sometimes still go there just not as often. The best girls there don’t work there anymore and the new girls aren’t as great. I also still feel guilty after I go there so I stopped.

Then there’s Twin Peaks (it’s a place similar to hooters) I went there a couple times and drank a beer. When I had some cash. I didn’t really go for the beer as you can tell. I ogled them like a creep and felt like creep afterwards. And wondered what I’am doing with my life. I talked with one of the waitresses and told her she had pretty eyes. She said thank you but It was awkward. I don’t really go there that often. Sometimes my horrniness gets the better of me.

i hope you're doing great.

long story short.

i used to study with this girl 9 years ago, we weren't close, we didn't have a proper conversation we did have nothing.

so the year ended i changed the school i lost touch with old classmates including her, but i kept her on Facebook and Instagram, bit w don't talk just sometimes random comments or just responding to a story.

9 years later i saw her by chance at my school, i texted her if it was her, i met her again we had a small conversation, what can i say, man she's so beautiful so lovely so unique.

mhm i invited her for a coffee to catch up. 

the meeting was good we had fun conversations and she did confirm she liked and she would go out again with me sometimes.

now the problem I'm facing is her texts or the conversation we have online, texts are dry and conversations are always dead, it's almost like she doesn't want to talk. but in real life is quite the opposite, her body language is the opposite, she engages conversations... ber actions are quite the opposite of the way she text

so i want your opinions regarding this,

Are there some people who are just bad texters? 

should i just stop texting her or trying to approach her?

i kinda like her i would love to know her better but  our schedules are quite tight and I can't really drag her to a conversation online 

anyway guys sorry for the long paragraph but give me your inputs

To run it down I've been drinking for over 30 years I guess. Not always heavily and I had breaks for a month or two in between. However recently I have become dependant on alcohol. I don't exactly need it physically and I don't crave it body-wise. I do rely on it psychologically which was a tough realisation. I realised that I don't really know what to do with myself without a beer, or how to enjoy the simple things just for their sake.   

I know I always have had alcohol problem but I never had this.. well... no other life. 

It scared the shit out of me and I admit I need extra push.    

I have a decent career, I never call sick, I'm really good at my job, I'm even up for promotion. but my personal life is empty, I go home, open beers, enjoy football (soccer) or throw in a show and just, drink.... Then I wake up, shower, have a coffee, go to work and slowly transform from thinking I won't drink today to buying 8 pints on the way home. 

So anyway, I am getting the implant, and I am happy to do it but I am also a bit worried. Not of not drinking but of being sober with no way out.

Anyone been there, any advice?

I'm in UK so about to sleep, apologies if I don't respond but please share your experience, anything is always appreciated.",1,1770852964.0,stopdrinking,1,1.0,False

It started with the normal stuff - coffee, spices, anything with flavour…

Then when I worked out a selection of safer foods, if I eat anything more than a few times I develop an aversion! For example, I’ve been able to snack on plain salted Pringles no problem, but suddenly today they are the worst thing ever!

The only things I’ve been able to handle more than a few times are satsumas & apples. Besides that, it feels like nothing is safe.

1r2dgbu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1r2dgbu/cold_wet_sensation_in_head/,cold wet sensation in head??,"okay hi this is my first time posting on reddit but I've been sick for the past 2 months and have no idea the cause.

I (f19) went home for winter break (December 13th), and was feeling fine hanging out with friends, and then one day I made this super concentrated coffee on accident 😞 (but only drank maybe half a cup). I felt okay after drinking it, I just wanted some energy so I could clean my room, and I've never had issues with caffeine other than some mild increased anxiety.

 Later that day I went to my siblings middle school band performance and was just sitting with my mom doing the wordle when I started getting heart palpitations. I had started freaking out,,, which did make them worse but my mom is a nurse and was calming me down. They lasted from 7 pm til 11 at night when I started getting symptomatic with chest pains and trouble breathing, so she took me to the ER. 

They did an EKG, and found that I was throwing PACs, and that my orthostatics were positive, and basically told me I was okay and they'd order a heart monitor just to be sure. When we got home I went to sleep, but the next day I was still having them.

Then I started getting sick (with no fever), I couldn't get out of bed or eat and the only thing that would calm me down was smosh reads reddit stories 😭. I could constantly feel my heartbeat and was hyper aware of it along with stabbing pains or numb spots in my chest. Then I started getting this insane pressure in the back of my head with this burning feeling that alternated with the sensation of someone blowing directly onto my brain or pouring water on it. I also got this feeling of all the blood going to the top of my head then popping and then it would fill my head with warmth which was terrifying. And often was scared to sleep because I thought I wouldn't wake up. 

Went to the doctor, she gave me amoxicillin and said I had a sinus and ear infection, finished the antibiotics and it only slightly alleviated the pressure I was feeling. I also had gone to the eye doctor during the break and they told me my eyes were perfectly healthy and my prescription changed minutely. 

I ended up losing 15 pounds in 3 weeks and was feeling really weak and shitty, but I had to go back to college so I had to gather strength to pack up and drive back, which was an okay drive except there was a bunch of pressure at the base of my neck. I tried forcing myself to start eating more, and attending all my classes but my head would constantly hurt and no pain meds would make it go away. Often finding it hard to do basic tasks again, having to take a lot of breaks when cooking, or walking because I wasn't strong enough to keep up and my heart would feel weird. 

Then my vision started being weird. I woke up and everything seemed far away and dim and when I looked down I was either really tall or short and that hasn't gone away since. It also feels like my forehead and eyes are being pushed into the back of my head at all times.

Still having the cold head and the burning sensations, and then sustaining a minor head injury after my friend had accidentally kicked the chair I was sitting on out from under me- I went to the ER again. They did a CT scan and said everything looked normal which was a relief, but they did tell me to see a neurologist. 

I went to another doctor, just to have a physician in the area and she said she recommends I take anxiety meds, which I do agree with because the smallest things give me the biggest senses of impending doom, but only after having the heart palpitations. I will genuinely be just retelling a story to my friends and feel my heart drop to my ass for NO REASON !!!! which has never happened to me before.

Still haven't received my heart monitor, and the the pressure and sensations in my head have become debilitating and I've been having vertigo and it just feels like my whole body keeps lurching. I just don't feel like a real person anymore and I have no idea why😕 

TLDR: Had heart palpitations, spiraled into a sickness that caused pressure and cold sensations in my head that the doctors just keep telling me is unusual but have no clue what it is, my anxiety is skyrocketing like it never did before, and my visions wack -I just want to be normal again.",1,1770852901.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

**7-Day Road Trip from LA to Miami – One of the Best Drives of My Life 🚗🌴**

I finally did it — drove from Los Angeles to Miami in 7 days, and honestly, it was one of the most memorable experiences I’ve had.

**Route:**  
LA → Phoenix → El Paso → Austin → New Orleans → Orlando → Miami  
(with plenty of random coffee stops in tiny towns along the way ☕)

**Day 1: LA to Phoenix**  
Left early to beat LA traffic. The desert landscapes were unreal — wide open roads, dramatic skies, and that golden Arizona sunset hit differently.

**Day 2: Phoenix to El Paso**  
This stretch felt raw and peaceful. Long highways, mountains in the distance, barely any cars at times. Stopped at a small-town café somewhere in New Mexico — those unexpected stops always end up being the most wholesome.

**Day 3: El Paso to Austin**  
Texas is BIG. Like… really big. Austin was such a vibe shift — live music, great food, and that youthful energy. Definitely could’ve stayed longer.

**Day 4: Austin to New Orleans**  
The scenery slowly changed, more green, more humidity. New Orleans was soulful — the architecture, jazz on the streets, and late-night beignets. Felt like stepping into a different world.

**Day 5: New Orleans to Orlando**  
Long drive day but surprisingly scenic once you hit Florida. Lots of coffee breaks to stay sane. Florida highways feel endless.

**Day 6-7: Orlando to Miami**  
Orlando was more of a pause point, but reaching Miami felt like a reward. Palm trees, ocean breeze, pastel buildings — after days of desert and highways, it felt surreal.

I have spent years diving deep into psychology research, behavioral science, and personal development content from podcasts like Huberman Lab and books on habit formation. And here's what I've realized: most people are out here making decisions like they're playing darts in the dark. They think success is random or based on luck. But it's not. Your future is basically getting shaped by three core things right now, and if you're not actively managing them, you're letting life happen TO you instead of FOR you.

Let me break it down because this stuff actually works when you apply it.

**Thing 1: The Information You Consume**

Your brain is basically a sponge soaking up whatever you feed it. Spend hours scrolling TikTok and doom scrolling Twitter? Congrats, your brain is now optimized for distraction and outrage. But flip the script and feed it quality input, and you'll literally rewire your neural pathways.

\*\*Start with what goes into your head.\*\* I'm not saying you need to become some productivity robot who only reads academic journals. But be intentional. Replace one hour of mindless scrolling with a podcast that actually teaches you something. Try Lex Fridman's podcast if you want deep conversations with brilliant minds, or Hidden Brain for understanding human behavior.

\*\*Books matter more than you think.\*\* [Atomic Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299) by James Clear isn't just another self-help book; it's a neuroscience-backed blueprint for behavior change. Clear breaks down why your habits are basically your future on autopilot. This book has sold over 15 million copies because it actually delivers. It'll show you how tiny changes compound into massive results. Insanely practical read.

Another one: Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman (Nobel Prize winner in economics). This book will make you question every decision you've ever made. Kahneman explains how your brain has two systems, one fast and emotional and one slow and logical, and how understanding them prevents you from screwing up your life choices.

If you want to go deeper into this stuff but don't have the time or energy to read through dense books, there's an AI personalized learning app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-anything-befreed/id6739747450) that's been pretty useful. Built by a team from Columbia and Google, it pulls from books like the ones above, research papers, and expert talks to create customized audio podcasts based on what you actually want to learn. 

You just type in a goal, something like ""build better habits as someone who struggles with consistency,"" and it generates a structured learning plan with episodes you can adjust from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives. The voice options are genuinely addictive too; there's a smoky, sarcastic style that makes even dry psychology research entertaining. You can pause mid-episode to ask questions to your AI coach Freedia, and it captures your insights automatically so you're not scrambling to take notes. Makes learning feel way less like work and more like something you'd actually want to do during your commute or at the gym.

\*\*Use apps that support growth.\*\* Try [Ash](https://apps.apple.com/za/app/ash-ai-for-mental-health/id6474862947?see-all=reviews&platform=iphone) if you need help with mental health or relationship patterns. It's like having a pocket therapist who calls out your bullshit thinking patterns. Or use Insight Timer for meditation and mental clarity. Five minutes a day actually changes your stress response over time.

**Thing 2: The People Around You**

This one's uncomfortable but true: you're the average of the five people you spend the most time with. If your crew is constantly complaining, staying stuck, or dragging you into drama, guess what your life is going to look like? Exactly that.

\*\*Audit your relationships.\*\* Not in a cold, calculated way, but honestly ask yourself: are the people around me pushing me to grow or keeping me comfortable in mediocrity? Your environment shapes your standards. If everyone around you thinks staying at a dead-end job is fine, you'll probably convince yourself it's fine too.

\*\*Seek out people who are ahead of where you want to be.\*\* This doesn't mean ditching your friends. It means expanding your circle. Join communities, online groups, or local meetups where people are doing things you want to do. The energy is contagious.

I started hanging out in spaces where people talked about goals and growth instead of just venting about life. Didn't happen overnight, but within months my entire mindset shifted. Suddenly the stuff I thought was impossible started feeling doable because I saw other people doing it.

\*\*Boundaries are everything.\*\* You can't control other people, but you can control how much access they have to your time and energy. If someone consistently drains you or pulls you backward, it's okay to create distance. Your future self will thank you.

**Thing 3: Your Daily Systems (Not Goals)**

Everyone's obsessed with goals. ""I want to lose 20 pounds."" ""I want to make six figures."" Cool. But goals without systems are just wishes. Your daily actions, your routines, and your tiny boring habits—that's what actually builds your future.

\*\*Focus on systems, not outcomes.\*\* Instead of ""I want to get in shape,"" build a system like ""I go to the gym every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 7am no matter what. "" The system is what you control. The outcome happens as a result.

\*\*Start stupidly small.\*\* Want to read more? Don't commit to reading an hour a day. Commit to reading one page. Sounds ridiculous, right? But that's the point. The resistance to starting disappears when the task feels laughably easy. Once you're reading that one page, you'll probably read more. But even if you don't, you still win because you kept the habit alive.

James Clear talks about this exact concept in [Atomic Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299). He calls it the two-minute rule: any habit can be scaled down to a two-minute version. Want to start journaling? Just write one sentence. Want to eat healthier? Just eat one vegetable. The point is showing up, not being perfect.

\*\*Track your progress.\*\* Use apps like Finch for habit tracking. It gamifies your daily routines and gives you a cute little bird companion that grows as you build better habits. Sounds silly, but it works because your brain loves seeing progress, even tiny wins.

\*\*Protect your morning routine.\*\* The first hour of your day sets the tone for everything else. If you wake up and immediately grab your phone to scroll, you're starting the day reactive instead of intentional. Try this: no phone for the first 30 minutes. Use that time for something that builds you up: movement, reading, journaling, or whatever. Your brain will be sharper, and you'll feel more in control.

**Why This Actually Matters**

Here's the thing that took me forever to understand: these three areas (information, people, and systems) aren't separate. They feed into each other. Better information helps you build better systems. Better systems give you energy to show up differently in relationships. Better relationships expose you to better information. It's a compound effect.

The science backs this up too. Neuroplasticity research shows your brain physically changes based on repeated behaviors and environments. You're literally sculpting your future brain right now with every choice you make. That's both terrifying and empowering.

Most people drift through life letting these three things happen randomly. They consume whatever algorithm feeds them, hang with whoever's convenient, and build zero intentional systems. Then they wonder why their life feels stuck.

You don't have to be that person. Pick one area and start there. Swap one hour of Netflix for a good podcast this week. Text one person who inspires you and grab coffee. Build one tiny habit and track it for 30 days.

Your future isn't some distant thing that'll magically appear. It's being built right now, one decision at a time. Make them count.",1,1770852151.0,MindDecoding,0,1.0,False
