I thought it would be awkward, but surprisingly, it was the opposite—it felt easy and natural. We had coffee, talked about a lot of things, and what stood out to me was that he was very present. He wasn’t glued to his phone, really respected our conversation, and treated me well. He paid for everything, even when I insisted on paying my share.

He later asked me out again, this time for dinner and a short walk after. The dynamic between us stayed the same—comfortable, light, and respectful. One thing I noticed (and appreciated) is how he made me feel feminine. I’m used to being the “independent, tough girl who walks fast,” but with him, I felt like he wanted to take care of me in small ways. Like he’d guide me while crossing the street, and just made sure I was safe.

Now here’s the thing—when it comes to texting, we don’t really talk that often. Maybe once or twice a week. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t overthink sometimes. Part of me gets anxious that maybe he’s ghosting me or just not that interested.

Then two weeks after our last date, he messaged asking if I was free that weekend—he wanted to have coffee in Boracay (I live nearby, so it wasn’t a huge trip for me). I delayed my reply by a day (haha a little power move 😅) and said I wasn’t sure yet. He responded with “no pressure at all.” But of course… I still went. 😆

We had coffee at one of my favorite cafés, swam, and later he introduced me to his friends. We ended up going to a party, and while I initially planned to go home after, I ended up not being able to. It was raining, transportation was uncertain, and he booked us a room. He was clear about his intentions—he just didn’t feel comfortable letting me go home in that weather, and said he’d feel responsible if anything happened.

We talked for a while that night about our past relationships. And although we shared a bed, nothing happened. The next morning, he asked if he could cuddle me. I said yes. We kissed, but that was it. Before we left the room, he hugged me and said, “I want to know you more.”

A few days later, he messaged me again, saying he hoped we could meet before he leaves for work (he’s a seafarer). A month passed, and we finally had dinner again in Manila before he left. The conversation was nice—mostly life updates—but nothing about us or what this whole thing means.

So here I am, not assuming anything. I’m not someone who will believe that there’s something unless it’s clearly communicated. The only thing is… I don’t have the courage to ask those “so what are we?” questions first. I wish I could. But I’m scared I might ruin the dynamic or push him away.

Still, I can’t help but wonder what he really thinks of me. 🤷‍♀️

I’m a year and a half sober. I struggled with addiction for years and finally got clean after some really dark stuff went down. My family was supportive at first, especially when I hit my lowest point. But now that I’ve been sober for a while, they act like everything should be back to “normal.”

Lately though, I’ve been struggling — like, really struggling. Not with using, but with everything else. Guilt, anxiety, even figuring out who I am now that I’m not numbing everything. I mentioned to my mom that I wanted to start therapy again, and her exact words were, “I thought we were past that.”

So I dropped it. But the truth is, I needed it. I found this app that offered a free month of therapy if you signed up for their plan — I only had to pay $5 to access it, and I figured I spend more than that on coffee, so I just did it.

I’ve had two sessions already and they’ve honestly helped me more than anything has in a long time. But now I’m hiding it like it’s some kind of dirty secret — like I’m failing or being dramatic just for needing to talk to someone. My family keeps saying how proud they are of how far I’ve come, and I feel like I’m lying to them by not being “better” the way they think I should be.

The following recipes have been selected based on a range of criteria, including ease of preparation, ingredient accessibility, flavor profiles, and overall appeal. They represent a diverse selection of honey-based desserts, showcasing the versatility of this natural sweetener.

**Baklava:** Known for its flaky layers of phyllo dough, crunchy nuts, and sweet honey syrup, baklava is a classic Middle Eastern and mediterranean dessert. the recipe involves layering thin sheets of phyllo dough with a mixture of chopped nuts,typically walnuts or pistachios,and then baking the pastry until golden brown.once baked,a fragrant honey syrup is poured over the baklava,soaking into the layers and creating a sticky,sweet,and utterly irresistible treat. The quality of the honey used significantly impacts the final flavor of the baklava,with floral or citrusy honey varieties adding a delightful complexity.

**Honey Cake:** A moist and tender Honey Cake, often enjoyed during Jewish holidays such as Rosh Hashanah, celebrates the sweetness of the New Year. The cake includes ingredients like honey, oil, eggs, flour, and spices such as cinnamon and cloves to create its unique taste profile. The honey not only sweetens the cake but also contributes to its distinctive flavor and moist texture. Recipes often include coffee or tea to deepen the flavors and add a touch of richness. Variations within honey cakes may contain elements like dried fruits or chopped nuts for added textural interest and flavor complexity.

**Honey Panna Cotta:** Panna Cotta, meaning ""cooked cream"" in Italian, is a simple yet elegant dessert that showcases the delicate flavor of honey. This creamy and smooth dessert is made by gently heating cream with sugar and gelatin, then allowing it to set in individual molds or glasses. Honey is incorporated into the cream mixture, providing a subtle sweetness and fragrant aroma. The resulting panna cotta is light, refreshing, and melt-in-your-mouth delicious, making it a perfect ending to any meal. It can be topped with fresh fruit, berries, or a drizzle of extra honey for added flavor and visual appeal.

**Honey Lavender Ice Cream:** A uniquely flavored dessert combining the sweetness of honey with the floral aroma of lavender. This ice cream is made by infusing milk or cream with culinary lavender, then blending it with honey, eggs (optional), and other standard ice cream ingredients. The resulting ice cream boasts a delicate balance of sweet, floral, and creamy flavors. the key lies in using high-quality lavender and honey to achieve the desired flavor profile. Too much lavender can make the ice cream bitter, so moderation is essential.

When roasted,figs become even more caramelized and tender,creating a delightful textural contrast.This simple dessert involves roasting fresh figs with a drizzle of honey,then serving them with a dollop of creamy ricotta cheese. The combination of warm, sweet figs and cool, tangy ricotta is a match made in heaven. A sprinkle of chopped nuts, such as pistachios or almonds, adds a delightful crunch and visual appeal.

**Honey Applesauce:** A healthier dessert choice is homemade honey applesauce which replaces conventional table sugar with raw honey.honey adds a smooth, rich texture along with amplifying the sweetness. Depending on the types of apples selected for the recipe,the applesauce can yield both sweet and tart flavor profiles.

## Core Benefits

**Enhanced Flavor Profile:** Honey imparts a unique and complex flavor to desserts that cannot be replicated with other sweeteners. Depending on the type of honey used, it can add notes of floral, fruity, woody, or even spicy notes, creating depth and complexity in the final product. This enhancement to the overall flavor experience elevates the average dessert to something memorable.**Natural Sweetness:** Honey is a natural sweetener that offers a healthier alternative to refined sugar. it contains antioxidants, enzymes, and other beneficial compounds that contribute to overall health and well-being. While still a sweetener and should be consumed in moderation, it offers a more nutritious option compared to processed sugars.

**Improved Texture:** The hygroscopic nature of honey helps to retain moisture in baked goods,resulting in a softer,more tender texture. This is especially beneficial for cakes, muffins, and other baked desserts that can sometimes become dry. The honey also contributes to a slightly chewy or sticky texture,depending on the recipe,adding an fascinating element to the overall mouthfeel.

**Versatility:** The applications of honey in desserts are nearly limitless. It can be used as a sweetener, a glaze, a syrup, or even as a key ingredient in sauces and fillings. Its versatility allows for creativity and experimentation in the kitchen, making it a valuable ingredient for both novice and experienced bakers.

## FAQs Section

**Can I substitute different types of honey in these recipes?**
Yes, you can substitute different types of honey, such as clover, wildflower, manuka, or buckwheat, in most of these recipes. Each type of honey has its own unique flavor profile, so substituting it will affect the final flavor of the dessert.Lighter honeys, like clover, will impart a milder sweetness, while darker honeys, like buckwheat, will have a more robust and intense flavor.

**How should I store honey-based desserts?**
The proper storage of honey-based desserts depends on the specific type of dessert. Baked goods like honey cake should be stored in an airtight container at room temperature or in the refrigerator to extend their shelf life. Panna cotta and ice cream should be stored in the freezer. Honey-roasted figs should be stored in the refrigerator.

**Is honey safe for everyone to consume?**
Honey is generally safe for most people to consume, but it is not recommended for infants under one year of age. Honey may contain spores of Clostridium botulinum, which can cause botulism in infants. For older children and adults, honey is generally safe, but individuals with diabetes or allergies should consume it in moderation.**Can I use honey as a substitute for sugar in other recipes?**
Yes, you can use honey as a substitute for sugar in most recipes, but you may need to make some adjustments to the recipe. honey is sweeter than sugar, so you will need to use less of it. A good rule of thumb is to substitute 1/2 to 2/3 cup of honey for every 1 cup of sugar.You may also need to reduce the amount of liquid in the recipe slightly, as honey is more viscous than sugar. it is recommended to reduce the oven temperature by 25 degrees Fahrenheit to prevent over-browning.

Entry 1. Day 1
“Hello, uh this is Joshua Tibbets. This is going to be my audio log, I was going to be
a journal, but I thought that this format may be better suited to the field of work I’m
about to be in, and what my findings could be. For those using this audio log as a
way to record my notes following my new position, again I am Joshua Tibbets, 36
years old, and I’m a Lieutenant Junior Grade, and have been in the Navy for 5 Years.
I’m stationed aboard the USS. Mcallaster somewhere off the coast of Anchorage
Alaska now, and we’re heading to what I believe to be where we’re going to be
scouting for Chinese subs, or so I believe. Anywho, I thought I’d make a start on this
thing before I forget, I feel like a journal, or a log is something you got to stick with or
you'll just never do it. Gotta make it a habit. Mess Hall is calling us for supper now,
so I’ll update this again in the morning. Alright, uh over and out? See ya.”

Transmission Ended.

Entry 2. Day 2
“Okay, well good morning! This is day two on our voyage. We’ve reached our patrol
border to keep a look out for the Chinese and I think there will be a briefing after
breakfast. I don’t think I can bring the recorder into the briefing which is a bummer,
but I’ll give the jist of what our plans are. Also, I probably should mention why I am
logging all of this. Prior to our departure, myself and 4 other seamen were chosen to
conduct an observation and information gathering operation on the behaviour of the
Chinese subs. This information would then be sent back to HQ and be implemented
to better understand how to combat their technology, weapon systems, and so on.
Besides myself, there is Reynolds, Harper, Richards, and Simmons. Harper being
the senior seamen of the five of us. I’m sure I’ll have a better chance to meet
Simmons and Reynolds soon, and maybe pick Harper’s brain, get some stories out
of him. Richards is already part of my unit so I’d say he and I are already well
acquainted. Ooh alright I think it’s time for the briefing, so I’ll be back shortly.”

Entry 3. Day 2
“Right, I’m back from the briefing. The ship will be getting the majority of the crew to
begin their preparations for the Chinese sub operation aboard the ship. Positions are
to be manned, equipment checked. The standard run-down for an operation of this
nature. However, Reynolds, Harper, Richards, Simmons, and myself are being
treated as a separate unit, and are being tasked with a different post all together, and
it’s not on this ship. The briefing concluded with the captain asking the rest of the
crews to leave, while we stayed behind to receive our orders. Don’t get me wrong, I
love a good old secret, but I thought we were all in on the same mission here?
Anyways, we hung back, and approached the captain. He told us that we’d be
getting picked up from the loading bay at 17:30 in a Navy Dinghy boat, and taken to
another nearby Navy observation facility that specialises in submersibles. I guess
we’re going in subs then? Neat. They didn’t give us too much more to go on besides
that, so I guess we'll sit here and wait until tonight. I sit here now looking out the
porthole of my room and see little chunks of ice floating past. Alright, I’ll update again
when the boat arrives. Over and out. Or Josh out. I haven’t quite worked that part out
yet.”

I’ve got my bags ready, room cleared out. I rate the room a 3 out of 5 stars. Sorry
Navy. Let’s hope the next stay is a bit more luxurious than my dorm cubicle.
Reynolds seems nervous to leave. I think he’s got this thing about water at night? I
don’t know, something weird like that. Harper was giving him shit for it, telling him to
suck it up or something to that effect. Besides that, no Chinese sub activity spotted
yet which is a plus. I -”

where we are is pretty interesting. We’re about 2 miles away from the USS Mcalister,
I can see its lights in the distance. It gets dark so quickly up here. It’s only 18:15 and
it could be midnight for all I know, it's that dark. This place seems to be another
branch off of the Navy’s research operation, and while I’ve been told it is, and they
say it is, there’s very little US Navy insignias around. The claustrophobic walkways
inside the metal hallways are rusted, and dimly lit, but then will have rooms with state
of the art tech. I can always hear dripping water and machinery buzzing. We’ve been
shown to our dorms which is where I am now. It’s dark, real dark. I’m going to put
this down now and update tomorrow after our new orders are given to us by the
team here in the briefing. Tibbets out.”

Entry 6. Day 3
“Well, goodmorning. Not the best sleep as I’d hoped. The boat, or station, rocked all
night on the rough sea. Must’ve been some bad wind. I heard what I think was
Simmon’s being sea sick last night, his dorm is across the hall from mine. I think this
morning we will have a better chance to get to meet one another properly. They’ll
probably want us to since we’re a small team who are meant to be working together.
I think I’m going to head into the break room and get some coffee, mingle with some
other of the crewmates who are up. I’ll be back to update soon, just a few hours or
so.”

Entry 7. Day 3
“MRE’s for breakfast and the coffee was.. Well it was okay. I got to chat with
Reynolds a bit. He’s from Texas and he’s 27. He’s been in the Navy for 3 years.
Single, no kids. Like me. He’s eager to see what it is we’re going to be doing here.
As am I. Soon after that Simmons came in too looking worse for wear. He had some
coffee and ate what he could stomach. Ironic a guy who has seasickness is in the
Navy of all places. Harper broke our conversation as he walked passed dressed in
uniform already, and had an energy about him like he’d already been up for hours.
What is it about older guys with that? Anyways, getting off topic, he ordered that we
make our way down to the briefing room, and to get dressed asap. In the briefing
room we were met by three Naval scientists in semi casual scientist gowns? There
were another two naval officers in uniform also.
They explained to us that the task we have been put on will span the next seven
days, as they have had updated information from the USS Mcalister of some
confirmed Chinese Submarine activity. I got pretty excited and I could see that
Reynolds and Richards were too. The man running this operation, Mr Tom Leichman
explained how we would be each undergoing different tests such as pressurisation
tests, isolation and confinement tests before our individual descents under the ocean
to record our findings, and report them back to the team and HQ.They told us that
each of us would go down for a period of three hours at a time, and only one person
could go down per day due to the restraints of the submersible, and reup times of the
other machinery, fuel, and Chinese sub activity. We were dismissed, and were told
that the tests and descents would start this afternoon. So, a lot to take in, but I am
eagerly waiting to get started today. I will keep you posted. Tibbets out.”

Transmission Ended.

Entry 8. Day 3
“We went in for our first pressurisation test today just after lunch. We each got to go
into this room that was behind a seriously huge bulkhead. The room was fitted to
look like the inside of a submarine, however we were told that the sub we would be
using was only going to be big enough to house one occupant at a time. So I guess
this was just purely a test on us. We climbed into our seats and strapped in. The
door was shut, and the metal wheel was spun shut to lock it. A voice over the
loudspeakers would inform us on every 100 feet that we went down. When the voice
started to read out the initial depths, my body started to feel a bit heavy, but as the
pressure was soon adjusted, it was like nothing was different in the slightest.
However, when the voice started to read out depths much below that of any
operational submarine I know of, I started to feel a bit worried. Just how advanced
were these subs? Was the US Navy equipped to handle something that was lurking
so deep beneath the surface? Of course with other subs they were, sure, but what
sub is operating at the depth of the Titanic?
After we came out of the pressurisation test, I saw some confused and concerned
looks on the faces of the crew. I wonder if they had the same concerns I did. Next up
was the isolation test which was to simulate the event of a power outage, or light
failure and we’d need to be down there until a recovery crew came. For hours we sat
in that room in the complete pitch black. Some of the men, I didn’t see who, started
talking to things, or seeing things that weren't there. The brain can do some scary
things. Tomorrow will be our first descent for one of the crew, so I’m going to put this
away and hit the hay. I’m a bit anxious, but nonetheless excited. Tibbets out.”

Entry 9. Day 4
“Alright! Goodmorning. Today is the day! This is day two onboard the research
facility, and today we dive! Well when I say we, I mean just one of us, but as a team
this is the start of this operation for us. I can’t tell if the chills I get are from
nervousness or excitement. Reynolds is the first to descend today. We’ll all be taking
a group photo with him before he dives down. He’s going to head to his pressure and
isolation checks shortly after a light breakfast, and no coffee. I think you can guess
why. I’ll come back when Reynolds is in the water. Talk shortly.”

Transmission Ended.

Entry 10. Day 4
“We’re away! Reynolds is in the water and diving down. We got to see the sub he’s
going in, and yeah it’s only really just big enough for one person. The front of it is a
big steel bathysphere with a porthole window and light fixtures. The rear is in the
shape of a fin, and has landers and propellers attached to the side. The whole
apparatus however, is connected to a link at the top of the steel dome with an
industry grade hook and steel cable which returns to the research facility. I can’t say
I’ve seen something like it before. Reynolds seems to be descending quickly which is
good, and from what I saw, the submersible is in a stable condition, and we’re
receiving good data from it. Only issue is that the subs comms system isn’t
functioning, so we can’y directly get in touch with Reynolds, nor can he to us. It will
be a few hours now until Reynolds comes back to the surface, so I’ll update then. If
anything of importance happens before then I’ll turn this back on. Tibbets out.”

Transmission Ended.

Entry 11. Day 4
“Reynolds has returned to the surface. It’s been hours since we last saw him, and
what we saw when we opened the hatch to the sub was nothing I was prepared for.
The steel latches are released, the wheel spun and the hatch opened, and the
opened hatch let out the loudest and most harrowing screams I have heard. The
scientist team went into the docking room with protective uniforms and equipment on
to retrieve Reynolds from the craft. His eyes were… His eyes were white, rolled into
the back of his head, and his hands… God, his hands. They looked like they were
cramped and spasming at the same time trying to grasp at his throat and his head.
He was utterly delicious, screaming and shouting.
I’d never seen anything like it. About 45 minutes later, the scientist came out from
the medic bay and relayed to us what had happened. They claimed that he’d
suffered an extremely freak accident where the air in the sub was not properly
working as intended, leaving him with brain damage. I’ve never seen someone with
brain damage act with that much energy though, usually they’re, well, a vegetable.
Looking over at Simmons, he was as white as a ghost. Tomorrow is his turn, and
we’ve been assured the sub will be worked on through the night. Let’s hope
everything goes smoothly tomorrow. Tibbets out.”

Transmission Ended.

Entry 12. Day 5.
“Morning. Though I don’t even know who I’m saying that for, but morning
nonetheless. Everyone is on edge and pretty anxious today. After yesterday’s
mishap, we’ve got every right to be. Reynolds still hasn’t been seen since he entered
MedBay. We’ve already been briefed on the upgrades made to the subs capabilities
that were worked on overnight, and there were even tests shown to prove it. I think
this helped, but Simmons was still pale. Whether that was from seasickness or
yesterday's events, I wasn’t sure. After his own pressure and isolation tests were
done, it was time for him to climb in, and he did so with shaky hands. Thankfully the
comms system has been brought back online so we’ll be able to have an actual line
of communication this time. If anything happens during Simmons’ descent, I will
record the audio. Tibbets out.”

Entry 13. Day 5.
“We’ve just had some comms come through from Simmons, the screen is displaying
the sub at 3500 m below sea level. Let's get this mic on and check in on him. Is that

SIMMONS: “H-Hey! Who’s there?”

SIMMONS: “Oh! Hey Josh. Yeah uh, man it’s so dark down here. The lights
illuminate the few feet in front of me but that’s about it.”
“Okay nice nice, how are you feeling? See any subs down there?”
SIMMONS: ‘Yeah it uh, it's pretty claustrophobic but im okay. And no, no subs ye-”
“Hey Simmons? Simmons? What's up?”
SIMMONS: “I - I see… I see… oh.. OH.. OH MY GOD I SEE I-”
“Simmons! What was that noise! Richards what was that bang?! Shit, Shit, bring him
up now!”

“We brought the sub back to the surface and recovered Simmons. If what was left of
him was even...him. His head, his fucking head. It was split open like a watermelon
hit with buckshot. The walls of the sun were coated in blood. I turned away as they
brought him out and I couldn’t look. I heard Richards be sick, and Harper let out a
disgusted grunt. This is turning into a disaster. I don’t know why the US Navy would
hand this team off to a group of scientists and engineers who can’t even put a
fucking sub together properly. Especially for a mission as important as this. I don’t
think I’ll be able to sleep tonight, and neither will Richards if I had to guess. He will
be going down tomorrow.

“As I thought, I had a pretty sleepless night. I heard screams coming from what I can
only assume as the med bay. Some new instructions have been given to us by the
team aboard the facility. They told us, “If you start to see movement out of the
porthold, use the camera provided to you to capture an Image. If the sub detects that
it is being viewed, they may be using some type of weaponry. It may be ultrasonic
which we believe is what caused Simmons' death.” So yeah. I’m not sure what to
make of all this, however I’m hopeful that using the camera in Richard's descent will
give us a better Idea what we’re working with here. I’ll come back when Richards is
in the water. Tibbets out.”

flash, the porthole view is just… black. The closest thing I can think of is that video of
a guy taking a photo of a doorway where a ghost was in his house and it's the same,
just black. It’s as if something doesn’t want us seeing it like this. The team is going to

They let you buy things, send money, or save value—all online, without needing a bank. While they share some similarities, they’re designed for different purposes. Let’s break down what Bitcoin and Kaspa are, how they work, and what sets them apart in a straightforward way.

**What Is Bitcoin?**

Bitcoin, launched in 2009 by the mysterious figure Satoshi Nakamoto, was the first cryptocurrency. It’s the most well-known and widely used digital currency today.

**Here’s how Bitcoin works:**

\- It runs on a blockchain, a digital ledger that securely records every transaction.

\- Every 10 minutes, a new “block” of transactions is added to the chain, locked with complex math puzzles.

\- Miners use powerful computers to solve these puzzles, keeping the network secure and earning new Bitcoins as a reward.

Bitcoin is often called “digital gold” because it’s seen as a store of value, like gold or silver, but online. People hold it hoping its value grows over time. However, transactions can be slow, and fees can get high when the network is busy.

 **What Is Kaspa?**

[Kaspa](https://kaspa.com), launched in 2021, is a newer cryptocurrency designed to be faster and cheaper than Bitcoin. It aims to be practical for everyday transactions, like buying coffee or paying a friend.

**Here’s what makes Kaspa unique:**

\- Instead of a blockchain, Kaspa uses a \*blockDAG\* (Directed Acyclic Graph), which processes multiple transactions at once, like a web instead of a single chain.

\- It’s extremely fast, confirming transactions in about one second compared to Bitcoin’s 10 minutes.

\- Fees are low, making it ideal for small, frequent payments.

Kaspa’s nickname is “digital silver,” reflecting its focus on quick, everyday use rather than long-term savings.

 **Bitcoin vs. Kaspa: Key Differences**

Think of Bitcoin and Kaspa as tools with different strengths. Here’s a side-by-side look at how they compare:



| Feature                               |           Bitcoin\*                            |                                 Kaspa                              |

|------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|

| \*\*Launched\*\*           | 2009 (the first cryptocurrency)          | 2021 (a newer option)                    |

| \*\*Transaction Speed\*\*  | 3-7 transactions per second              | 40-50 transactions per second            |

| \*\*Transaction Cost\*\*   | Can be high, especially during peak times| Very low, great for small payments       |

| \*\*Technology\*\*         | Blockchain (single chain of blocks)      | BlockDAG (web-like structure)            |

| \*\*Primary Use\*\*        | Store of value (like digital gold)       | Everyday transactions (like digital silver) |

| \*\*Energy Use\*\*         | High (mining requires lots of power)     | Lower, more energy-efficient             |

| \*\*Popularity\*\*         | Widely known and accepted                | Growing but less recognized              |

**Why Do Both Exist?**

Bitcoin and Kaspa serve different needs. Bitcoin is like a digital vault—trusted, secure, and valued for its stability and widespread use. It’s ideal for saving or investing, as many businesses and platforms accept it. Its large network of miners makes it extremely secure, but it can be slow and costly for small transactions.

Kaspa, on the other hand, is built for speed and affordability. It’s designed for quick, low-cost payments, making it practical for daily use. While it’s newer and less known, its efficiency makes it a promising option for the future.

**Are They Secure?**

Both Bitcoin and Kaspa use \*Proof of Work\* (PoW), where miners solve complex puzzles to validate transactions and secure the network. Bitcoin’s massive network makes it one of the most secure cryptocurrencies. Kaspa, though newer, uses a unique system called \*GHOSTDAG\* to ensure security and fairness, even with its high-speed transactions.

**Which Is Better?**

It depends on your goals. Bitcoin is the go-to for long-term value storage, thanks to its reputation and widespread adoption. Kaspa shines for fast, low-cost transactions, making it better for everyday spending. Some people might use both: Bitcoin for savings, Kaspa for quick payments.

 **Interesting Facts**

\- **Bitcoin:** Only 21 million Bitcoins will ever exist, making it scarce and valuable. In 2025, one Bitcoin is worth around $100,000.

\- **Kaspa:** Has a larger supply cap of 28.7 billion coins, mined gradually. Its price is about $0.08 per coin, making it more affordable.

\- **Bitcoin’s Reach:** Accepted by many businesses, from online stores to some physical shops.

\- **Kaspa’s Potential:** Its team is exploring \*smart contracts\*, which could enable apps like digital agreements or games.

**What’s Next for Bitcoin and Kaspa?**

Bitcoin remains the leader in cryptocurrency, trusted for its security and market dominance. However, its high energy use and slower speeds are challenges. Improvements like the \*Lightning Network\* aim to make Bitcoin faster and cheaper, but they’re still developing.

Kaspa is focused on scaling its speed even further, potentially handling 100 blocks per second. Its team is also working on features like smart contracts, which could make Kaspa a platform for innovative apps and services.

**Final Thoughts**

Bitcoin and Kaspa are two sides of the cryptocurrency coin. Bitcoin is the established, trusted choice for storing value, while Kaspa is the fast, affordable option for everyday transactions. Both are exciting parts of the digital money revolution, offering different ways to use and think about money in the digital age.

## Key Features Analysis

The best staff t-shirts in 2025 combine comfort, durability, and brand portrayal effectively. several key features contribute to a t-shirt's overall quality and suitability for staff wear.

**Material composition:** The material composition of a staff t-shirt is paramount for comfort and longevity. Options range from 100% cotton to poly-cotton blends and even performance fabrics. 100% cotton offers breathability and a soft feel, making it ideal for everyday wear. Though, it can shrink and wrinkle easily. Poly-cotton blends combine the comfort of cotton with the durability and wrinkle-resistance of polyester, making them a popular choice for staff uniforms. Performance fabrics, such as moisture-wicking polyester, are excellent for physically demanding jobs or outdoor work, keeping employees cool and dry.

**Fabric Weight:** Fabric weight impacts the t-shirt's feel, durability, and transparency. Measured in ounces per square yard (oz/sq yd), fabric weight typically ranges from 3 oz to 6 oz for t-shirts. Lighter fabrics (3-4 oz) are more breathable and comfortable in hot weather but may be less durable. Mid-weight fabrics (4.5-5.5 oz) offer a good balance of comfort and durability, suitable for various work environments. Heavier fabrics (5.5-6 oz) are the most durable and offer the best opacity, making them ideal for jobs requiring more robust clothing.

**Construction and Stitching:** The construction and stitching of a t-shirt significantly influence its durability and shape retention. Look for features like double-needle stitching at the sleeves and hem, which reinforces the seams and prevents unraveling. Shoulder-to-shoulder taping also enhances durability and prevents stretching around the neck.Side-seamed construction is generally preferred over tubular construction, as it provides a more tailored fit and reduces twisting after washing.

**Print Quality and Durability:** For staff t-shirts, the print quality and durability are crucial for showcasing your brand logo or message effectively. Screen printing is a common and cost-effective method for large orders, offering vibrant colors and good durability. Direct-to-garment (DTG) printing is ideal for small orders or complex designs with many colors, providing excellent detail and a soft feel. Heat transfer vinyl (HTV) is another option for small batches, offering versatility and durability, but it may not be as breathable as other methods. Ensure the printing method chosen is compatible with the fabric and can withstand repeated washing without fading or cracking.

**fit and Sizing Options:** A well-fitting t-shirt enhances both comfort and appearance. Offer a range of sizes to accommodate all employees, from small to XXL or even larger. Consider offering both unisex and fitted options to cater to different body types and preferences.A good fit allows for ease of movement and prevents the t-shirt from looking sloppy or unprofessional. Provide a detailed size chart to help employees choose the correct size, minimizing the need for exchanges.

**Color and Style Variety:** Offering a variety of colors and styles allows employees to choose options that best suit their personal preferences while still maintaining a cohesive brand look. Consider offering different neckline options,such as crew neck,V-neck,or scoop neck,to cater to individual preferences. A range of colors allows you to align the t-shirts with your brand identity and possibly offer different colors for different departments or teams.

Key features of the best staff t-shirts include:

*   High-quality material composition
*   Optimal fabric weight for comfort and durability
*   Robust construction and stitching
*   durable and vibrant print quality
*   Comprehensive fit and sizing options
*   Versatile color and style variety

## Core Benefits

Investing in well-designed and high-quality staff t-shirts offers numerous benefits for both employees and the company as a whole.

**Enhanced Brand visibility:** Staff t-shirts serve as a walking advertisement for your brand, increasing visibility and recognition. When employees wear branded t-shirts, they promote your company wherever they go, whether it's during work hours, commuting, or even running errands. A consistent and professional look across your staff reinforces your brand identity and creates a positive impression on customers and potential clients. For example, a restaurant with employees wearing branded t-shirts instantly reinforces the brand and makes staff easily identifiable to customers.

**Improved Team Cohesion and Morale:** Wearing the same t-shirt creates a sense of unity and belonging among employees, fostering team cohesion and boosting morale. When everyone is dressed in the same attire, it minimizes social distinctions and promotes a feeling of equality and shared purpose. This can lead to improved communication, collaboration, and overall teamwork. For instance, a retail store where staff wear matching t-shirts has a more unified and approachable presence, enhancing the customer experience and employee relationships.

**Increased Professionalism and Credibility:** Staff t-shirts contribute to a more professional and credible image for your company. Uniformed employees appear more organized, efficient, and trustworthy, which can positively influence customer perceptions and build confidence in your business.A professional appearance signals that your company takes its operations seriously and is committed to providing high-quality service.In the service industry, such as hospitality or healthcare, a professional appearance is particularly important for establishing trust and rapport with clients.

**Cost-Effective Marketing and Branding:** compared to other forms of advertising,staff t-shirts offer a cost-effective marketing solution.Once the initial investment in t-shirts is made, the ongoing cost is minimal, while the brand exposure is continuous. Employees essentially become walking billboards, promoting your brand every day without any additional marketing expenses. This makes staff t-shirts an excellent value for businesses of all sizes,especially startups and small businesses looking to maximize their marketing budget.

**Employee Comfort and Functionality:** High-quality staff t-shirts are designed for comfort and functionality, ensuring that employees can perform their duties efficiently and comfortably. Choosing the right fabric, fit, and style can significantly impact employee satisfaction and productivity. Breathable and moisture-wicking fabrics are ideal for physically demanding jobs, while a comfortable fit allows for freedom of movement. When employees are comfortable in their uniforms, they are more likely to be happy and productive at work.

## FAQs section

**What is the best material for staff t-shirts in hot weather?**
Lightweight and breathable materials like 100% cotton or moisture-wicking polyester are ideal for staff t-shirts in hot weather. Cotton allows for good airflow, but polyester or poly-cotton blends with moisture-wicking properties are even better at keeping employees cool and dry by drawing sweat away from the body.

**How can I ensure the print on staff t-shirts lasts long?**
To ensure the print on staff t-shirts lasts long, choose a durable printing method like screen printing or DTG (direct-to-garment) printing. Follow the care instructions on the t-shirt label, such as washing inside out with cold water and avoiding high heat when drying. Avoid ironing directly on the print,and consider using a mild detergent.

**What is the ideal fabric weight for durable and comfortable staff t-shirts?**
An ideal fabric weight for durable and comfortable staff t-shirts is between 4.5 oz and 5.5 oz. This mid-weight range offers a good balance of comfort, durability, and opacity, making it suitable for various work environments. Lighter fabrics may be more comfortable in hot weather, but they may not be as durable, while heavier fabrics can be too warm and stiff.

**How often should I replace staff t-shirts?**
The frequency of replacing staff t-shirts depends on their quality, wear and tear, and how often they are washed. Generally, high-quality t-shirts can last for one to two years with proper care. However, if the t-shirts show significant signs of fading, shrinking, or damage, or if the print is peeling, it's time to replace them to maintain a professional appearance.

1losa1s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/1losa1s/i_work_at_a_research_facility_in_the_arctic_it/,I work at a Research facility in the Arctic... It has Strange RULES TO FOLLOW!,"Have you ever stared into something so wrong, so fundamentally alien, that your brain simply refused to process it? Like your mind hit an invisible wall and just—shut down.

What if there are rules to reality we’re not meant to question… rules that break *you* the moment *you* break them? And what if, one night, in a place forgotten by the rest of the world, someone *did*?

My name is Mason. And I should’ve never said yes to that job.

They called it Black Hollow Station—a cold, hollow echo of a name that matched the emptiness around it. Located deep in the Arctic wasteland, hundreds of miles from the nearest human settlement, it was a concrete wound buried in snow and silence. No roads. No towns. No signs of life. Just wind that howled like a mourning beast, and a sky that never blinked.

They say silence is peaceful. But not here. Here, silence felt...watchful. Like the Earth had exhaled and was waiting to see if you’d flinch.

I took the job out of desperation—pure and simple. My bank account was hanging by a thread, and when the listing appeared, it looked like salvation disguised as a job posting. ""Night Surveillance Operator – Remote Research Station – Six Months – High Pay."" Sounded harmless enough. Sit in front of monitors. Drink some coffee. Get paid.

The salary? Obscene. Double what I’d made in a year—plus room, board, and a guaranteed bonus. Too good, I realize now. Far, far too good.

That should’ve been my first warning. But I was broke, and broke people don’t ask enough questions.

When I arrived, I expected some sort of welcoming orientation. Maybe a tour. What I got instead was a silent man waiting in the snow.

He stood motionless outside the steel entrance—tall, bald, face like carved granite. His parka was bone white, stitched with a black insignia that looked like an eye inside a triangle. He didn’t smile. Didn’t shake my hand. Just said, in a voice so dry it might’ve flaked away in the cold, *""We’ll go over the rules first. That’s the most important part.""*

He handed me a laminated card. The letters were bold and red, like warnings scrawled in blood:

* **NEVER** open the observation room door between **1:11 a.m. and 2:47 a.m.**  
* If the **hallway lights flicker**, **DO NOT move.** **Hold your breath** until they stop.  
* At **3:03 a.m.**, check **Camera 6**. If the room is **empty**, you’re safe. If someone is **standing there**, **DO NOT look away** until they vanish.  
* If you hear **knocking in the ventilation shafts**, ignore it. **Do not speak back.**  
* At **4:44 a.m.**, go to the **main generator room**. Count the humming sounds. There should be **five**. Report any deviation.  
* **Never**, under **any** circumstance, open the **northern exit**.  

I let out a weak laugh, expecting him to crack a grin. *""Is this a joke?""* I asked.

He didn’t even blink. *""These are not suggestions, Mason. Break one, and you won’t survive the night.""*

The way he said it—like someone repeating a fact he’d watched unfold too many times—strangled the laughter in my throat. Still, I told myself it had to be some kind of psychological experiment. This *was* a research facility, right? Maybe I was the experiment.

The first few nights passed without incident. The cameras fed me an endless loop of still, empty corridors. No movement. No noise. No surprises. Just the occasional gust of wind whining against the metal walls and the distant hum of generators churning through the Arctic dark.

I followed the rules. Out of habit more than fear. Sip coffee. Watch screens. Wait. Rinse. Repeat.

By night five, I’d almost convinced myself the whole thing *was* a test—some elaborate boredom endurance trial. And then came night six.

It was 1:12 a.m. I remember the time exactly, because that’s when the door handle to the observation room *twitched*.

Not creaked. Not wiggled. *Twitch*—like a muscle spasm in metal.

My blood turned to slush. Rule one. I was past the danger time.

I froze, cup halfway to my lips. The door handle rattled again. Just once more. Then silence.

No footsteps. No retreating echo. Just... nothing.

At 1:34 a.m., the hallway lights started flickering.

Rule two. I stopped breathing. My throat constricted as if invisible hands had clamped shut around it.

Ten seconds. Maybe less. But in that moment, time lost all meaning. My heartbeat pounded so hard I was sure the sound alone would get me killed.

When the flickering stopped, I gasped like I’d clawed my way out of a coffin. Still no movement on the cameras. Still no noise. But something had changed. The air felt...wrong. Like the station had *noticed* me.

And then the clock ticked to 3:03 a.m.

That’s when everything changed.

The monitor’s soft glow lit up the room as I turned to **Camera 6**, just like the rule commanded. It showed the same storage room I’d seen a dozen times before—white walls, metal shelves lined with labeled crates, and a flickering ceiling bulb that buzzed like an insect caught in glass.

At first, it was empty.

And then—he was there.

No movement. No sound. No transition.

Just a man, suddenly in the dead center of the room. Standing. Frozen. Facing the camera like he’d been waiting. Watching. Or worse—*knowing*.

His mouth hung wide open. But not like he was screaming—no sound came out. It was just *open*, like his jaw had disconnected and he’d forgotten how to fix it.

His eyes… my God, his eyes. They bulged like something behind them was trying to get out. No blinking. No twitch. Just raw, silent panic radiating from every inch of his face.

And he was staring. Right at me. Or through me. I couldn't tell which was worse.

My muscles locked. My skin crawled like ants were burrowing beneath it. My throat dried up, my sweat turned cold, and my heart thudded like a war drum in my ears. But I remembered the rule.

**Do not look away.**

So I stared. My eyes stung. My vision blurred. My spine screamed to turn away. But I didn’t. Couldn’t.

And then—he was gone. Not a step, not a fade. One frame he was there, the next—nothing. Like he'd been erased.

That was the moment it hit me: These weren’t rules. They were **rituals**. And breaking one wasn’t an accident—it was a death sentence.

I wanted to leave. I wanted to scream, to throw my badge on the floor and tell Ellis I was done. But that option didn’t exist.

The chopper only came once a month. I had three weeks left. Three *long*, cold, blood-curdling weeks.

And if I walked out before my contract ended? No paycheck. No transportation. No guarantee I’d even *make it* through the snow.

So I stayed.

And the next night, I followed the rules like they were holy scripture.

At exactly **4:44 a.m.**, I made my way to the generator room. Just like Rule 5 said.

The room smelled like burning ozone and old copper. The generators thrummed in the dark like sleeping beasts. I closed my eyes and listened to those hums.

**One.** **Two.** **Three.** **Four.**

Then… nothing.

My stomach turned to ice. The silence wasn’t *quiet*—it was active. It pressed against my eardrums like a held breath, waiting for me to flinch.

And then— A whisper.

*""Help.""*

Soft. Fragile. Like it had bled out through a slit in reality.

It came from behind the generator. I didn’t move. Didn’t speak.

*""You’re not supposed to be here.""*

This time, the voice was right next to my ear. Like it had bent time and space just to crawl beside me.

My body acted before my brain did. I bolted. Sprinted through the icy halls with adrenaline burning my veins. I slammed the control room door and locked it behind me, collapsing into the chair like I'd been shot.

My hands trembled violently. I could barely type. I sat there, paralyzed, until the sun bled pale light across the horizon.

Later that morning, Dr. Ellis strolled in like nothing had happened. Like I hadn’t just had a conversation with something *not human* in the dark.

I told him everything. The missing fifth hum. The whisper. The voice *right beside me*.

He didn’t blink. Just rubbed his jaw and said, flatly, *""You only heard four hums?""*

""Yes,"" I said. ""And something whispered. Twice.""

He looked... disturbed. Not shocked. Not confused. Just disturbed—like someone who’d seen this pattern unfold before.

*""That’s… concerning,""* he muttered. *""Did it touch you?""*

The question nearly stopped my heart.

""No.""

He nodded slowly. *""Then you’re still okay. But if it talks to you again...""*

He paused, then locked eyes with me.

*""Do not answer it.""*

I didn’t want to hear that. I didn’t want to know there could be a *next time*.

But quitting wasn’t an option. Not without losing everything. So I forced myself to stay.

In hindsight… That choice sealed my fate.

Two nights later, it happened.

I broke a rule.

Not on purpose. Not out of rebellion or carelessness.

It happened because something… *changed the rules*.

And from that moment on—

I was no longer a **watcher**.

I had become the **watched**.

The cameras started showing rooms that didn’t exist. Doors opened on their own. And at 1:11 a.m., something knocked.

**From inside the observation room.**

I didn’t mean to break the rule. But I did.

And what came out when I opened that door… wasn’t human.

The hallway lights flickered again.

Rule 2. That should’ve been my cue—freeze, hold my breath, become a statue and wait for it to pass.

And I *did*. At first.

But then, my radio hissed.

A burst of static snapped through the silence like lightning through still water.

**“Mason… Mason, come to the observation room. Emergency. Come quick.”**

It was Ellis.

Or, at least—it *sounded* like him.

Instinct took over.

I gasped, just once. A sharp inhale. A human reaction to panic.

The air burned as it filled my lungs. I hadn’t meant to breathe. I just *did*. And worse—I’d moved. My body had tensed, my hand twitching toward the radio before I remembered the rule.

**I had broken it.**

Everything went **silent**. So silent that even my heartbeat felt intrusive.

And then— The lights turned **red**.

Not dim. Not off. **Red**—like blood soaking through snow.

I hadn’t even known the facility *could* do that.

A high-pitched ringing bled through the hallway outside the control room—an unnatural tone, like glass grinding against teeth.

I turned to the monitors, already knowing I wouldn’t like what I saw.

Every hallway was black. Swallowed in shadow. Except one.

On that screen, *something* was crawling.

It didn’t walk. It didn’t even stagger. It crawled—rapid and erratic, like a centipede that had just been set on fire. Its limbs moved too fast, bending the wrong way, jittering like a corrupted video file.

And then it stopped.

**Right outside my door.**

I didn’t move. Didn’t blink. Didn’t even think.

I just sat there—paralyzed, praying to gods I’d stopped believing in.

Then the scratching began.

Slow. Methodical. Not random, but *intentional*. Like it was carving something.

Claw by claw, stroke by stroke.

I could feel it—etching madness into the metal. Marking me.

Morning came. Eventually. Though I didn’t remember the sun rising. It just… *happened*.

I cracked the door open, expecting claw marks, evidence—*something*.

But there was nothing.

The door was smooth. Stainless. Untouched.

As if the night had been nothing more than a hallucination. But I knew better.

Because something in me had cracked. A hairline fracture in the mind. A splinter in the soul.

My sanity hadn’t just bent—it had started to bleed.

I found Ellis in the lab, sipping coffee like it was just another day in hell. But I didn’t wait this time. I slammed my fist on the table.

**“What the hell is this place?”** I demanded. **“What are we** ***really*** **researching?”**

He looked older than he had the day before. Not just tired—*withered*. Like each night had stolen a year from his face.

He sighed. That kind of long, heavy sigh people give when they're about to dump a truth that shatters you.

**“We’re not researching. Not anymore.”**

He paused. Looked me dead in the eye.

**“We’re containing.”**

That word hung in the air like a curse.

**“Containing** ***what*****?”** I asked.

He didn’t answer—not with words.

Instead, he slid a thick manila folder across the table. Inside were photographs—black and white, low-resolution, *wrong*.

Figures that defied anatomy. Blurred silhouettes with **too many joints**, **no eyes**, **too many mouths**. One looked like a shadow with bones. Another—like a pile of spines floating in smoke.

I didn’t realize I was shaking until I heard the photos rattle in my hands.

**“We call them residuals,”** Ellis said. **“They’re not ghosts. Not aliens. We don’t know** ***what*** **they are.”**

He gestured around at the facility.

**“But the Arctic seems to attract them. Maybe it’s the cold. Maybe the isolation. Maybe something older than both. We built this place to keep them here. To keep the** ***rules*** **in place.”**

I asked the question I already dreaded the answer to.

**“And if the rules are broken?”**

He didn’t hesitate.

**“Then they get out… or get in.”**

I didn’t sleep that day. Couldn’t. Even when I closed my eyes, I could see the thing scratching at the door. Could feel its presence—like its memory had seeped into the wiring.

That night was my last.

The last night at Black Hollow.

And the worst.

Because I was no longer just following the rules…

I was about to become **part of them**.

When the lights went out completely—no red, no flicker—just *darkness*... I realized something had changed.

The station wasn’t trying to keep them contained anymore.

It was trying to **keep me** in.

My last night at Black Hollow was the worst.

There’s no clever metaphor to dress it up. It wasn’t loud. It wasn’t bloody. It was… personal.

**Because the thing I saw that night— was me.**

At exactly **3:03 a.m.**, I turned to **Camera 6**, like I had every night before. My fingers trembled, hovering over the keyboard like they already knew something was waiting.

The feed buzzed softly, flickered, then sharpened.

It was the same room—the same white-walled storage unit with metal racks and that single, humming light overhead.

But this time…

There was someone inside.

Not a stranger. Not a shadow.

**It was me.**

Same uniform. Same posture. Same face.

But the eyes… Gone. Two black pits that swallowed the screen. Not just blank—*hungry*.

And the mouth. It stretched wide. Too wide. The grin was unnatural, full of teeth that didn’t belong to me. Long. Sharp. Smiling like it knew exactly what I feared.

Then, slowly, my reflection—*my fake self*—tilted its head. Like a curious dog trying to understand the noise of a dying animal.

And it raised one finger to its lips.

**Shhh.**

That was all. No movement. No sound.

Just silence and that horrific, knowing grin.

I stared. I couldn’t not. My breath caught in my throat, and I could feel tears starting behind my eyes—not from fear. From recognition.

Some part of me… knew.

Then, in a blink, it vanished.

I didn’t wait for protocol. Didn’t wait for Ellis. Didn’t wait to see what the rules would demand next.

I packed my bag with shaking hands, every zipper scream echoing through the metal halls like alarms. Then I walked to the helipad and sat down.

I didn’t move. Didn’t think. Just waited—like a body waiting for burial.

Eventually, the chopper emerged from the horizon—its blades slicing the sky like they were trying to escape it too.

The pilot landed but said nothing at first. He just looked at me. Then at the facility. Then back at me.

His face was grim. Like he’d done this before. Too many times.

Then he asked one question.

**“You followed the rules?”**

I nodded once.

He stared at me a moment longer. Then said:

**“Then don’t talk about what you saw. Not to anyone. Ever.”**

The flight back felt unreal.

Outside the window, the Arctic stretched endlessly—just blank whiteness swallowing the world. And Black Hollow shrank into the distance, disappearing into the nothing like a dream you’re glad to forget… but never really do.

I didn’t speak. And neither did the pilot.

Because there are no words for what we left behind. Only rules.

That was **two years ago**.

I tried to build a life again. A job. An apartment. People. Structure. Routine.

But some nights, I still wake up. Always at the same time.

**3:03 a.m.**

And when I do, I never look directly in the mirror right away.

Because once—just once—I did.

And I saw myself… blink.

But I hadn’t blinked.

That *thing* in the mirror— **it blinked first.**

Now I keep the lights on at night. I follow little rituals. I whisper rules under my breath before bed.

Just in case.

Because sometimes…

I wonder if I ever really left **Black Hollow**. Or if **Black Hollow** just… followed me.

**Some places don’t want to be left behind. And some rules aren’t meant to be broken— because they’re the only thing keeping** ***you*** **from being replaced.**

We went to school together as kids, and reconnected after I moved back to my hometown when I was laid off from my job. I found out through social media years ago that he had a daughter with his girlfriend at the time, and about five years later, had another daughter with another girlfriend. He is 28 and I'm 26. I don't have any kids. I went to college and travelled the world. He stayed home and went to culinary school to become a chef (which I love; he cooks for me all the time) to provide for his kids. He's an attentive father and adores his daughters. I didn't expect to be so smitten when we met up for coffee. He had grown up to be handsome and tall, and was still as goofy and sweet as he was when we were kids.

We've been dating for 6 months now. We have so much fun together. We go fishing and hiking, go to the movies, and he introduces me to new bars and restaurants. Sometimes we hang out in the backyard, play music, and just mess around. The sex is so good. I've met his mom and his best friends and they all seem to like me. I feel safe with him. I have room to be myself. He said, ""I'm so glad I found you,"" one night when we were cuddled up on a lawn chair at his friend's house. He said that with his demanding work schedule and the time he has carved out for his kids, it's been impossible to date.

The thing is, it's only possible because I am unemployed and living at my mom's house 15 minutes away. I can fit into his schedule at any angle, and I do, because I love to spend time with him. But this is only working for right now. I don't mind being his last priority because I'd been so lonely. My self-esteem is shot. I overlook things about our relationship. Like how we're always drinking alcohol, how I didn't say anything when he stopped using condoms, how his hygiene is often questionable (and he dresses like a slob sometimes), and I've stopped wearing makeup and wearing nice outfits even though I did when we first started seeing each other. How he works through the weekend so I can only see him once or twice on random weeknights after he has dropped off his kids. How he suggested I move in with one of his BM's (after she broke up with her boyfriend who was splitting rent) so that he'd be less spread out. 

I don't know. They say the people you let into you're life while you're down are vastly different from those that enter when you're up. I'm emitting low vibrations lately. He's kind, respectful, responsible and generous but he can't lift me up anymore than I can him. It's summertime and outside is calling. I don't know how I would have made it all this time without him. But the way we are now, I don't see a future with him. We make a mismatched pair if you ever saw us.

Without gym, without completely cutting carbs, occasionally eating fast food. Ask me questions, I will try to help as much as possible.","Here’s what I did. As soon as I got the diagnosis that i was on the edge of diabetes, I panicked.

Then after a day I calmed down and started researching. I went through a bout of depression and panic attacks before this diagnosis which also affected it. Was only able sleep 4-6 hours a day. No exercise and a carb heavy diet. Hence the high hba1c with high triglycerides.

Pair that with a tech job and a complete sedentary lifestyle, it was a shortcut to early heart attacks, diabetes amongst a host of diseases that could happen to me.

As i mentioned, I calmed down, did my research and realized the issues with my carb heavy diet and unhealthy lifestyle. Started researching healthy diet options and self help videos and sought a shrink to help with mental issues.

Added more protein in my diet by using high protein bread, 2 eggs and high protein 2% milk in my coffee with one spoon of sugar instead of 3 earlier. This was my breakfast and gave me 37g of protein.

Had normal lunch, but drank a glass of water with one tp of apple coder vinegar before the meal. Ditto for dinner.

Started walking 2 times a day, after lunch and dinner. Doesn’t matter if it’s raining, snowing, heat wave or anything else. I walk. Meeting during office hours? Pushed back to make time for walk. Walked on average 2-2.5 km boths times so averaging 4-5 km per day at a normal pace. 13 min per km average.

Used 5% fat greek yogurt with small pieces of strawberries for health fats with lunch. Drank a glass of Avocado milkshake. It contained 1 spoon of sugar and high protein milk .75 cup with dinner generally. Cut down simple carbs by 33%. Meaning if I had 3 breads earlier in lunch or dinner, now I will have 2. Increased salad on the side as well.

Still ate pizza once in two weeks(only woodfire with all the sauces, paprika etc.) and ate Indian takeouts. Switched from normal coke to coke zero for these meals. For dinner started incorporating sandwich that had high protein bread with tofu, veggies and a low calorie hot sauce. Earlier I used to have white bread slices with potato stuffing with some veggies.

Lastly, did 5 sets of 10 reps of standing pushups and ditto for squats. Did 100 steps of skipping with virtual ropes. Only one time.
This was everyday morning routine. Did not exercise on weekends as I went to play tennis (1hr) and a lazy fcuk.

tldr:- fix mental health, seek professional help if you have to, get 8 hours of proper sleep, exercise in the morning, cut down carbs in your meals, walk after meals, increase protein, fibre and health fats in your meals, no snacking throughout the day.

By doing just this, no protein shakes or gymming, i was able to reduce my body weight from 92.5kg to 86.85kg in three months.

**RECAP**

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/I4wYwVCEPy): **November 8, 2024**

I (33m) have a pretty big age difference with my brother (44m). He had a child at 25, which means that I became an uncle at 14. Because we were pretty close in age, I formed a special bond with my niece, Ella (now 18f).

When she was 16, my brother and his family moved away so I've been seeing them less recently, but we keep in touch and catch up at family events.

Last year, at Christmas, my niece told me that she had a boyfriend and told me a bit about him, but I didn't know the guy. He was invited for Easter and a couple of other events, but was never able to make it. When we were planning our mother's birthday, my brother decided to invite Ella's boyfriend so that we could all meet him.

Yesterday was the birthday. I was looking forward to meeting Mark (Ella's boyfriend), but was very confused when I saw her walk in with a man that looked double her age (spoiler alert: he is). She introduced him to me, and I politely smiled but was deep down very concerned. I went to my brother to ask how old Mark was and he told me that Mark is 36, so literally double Ella's age. She had told me that he was ""a bit older"" but I assumed like early to mid twenties, not almost 40. That's when they called us in the living room to share ""exciting news"". Ella showed us a ring and revealed that they were engaged.

I just said ""what the fuck"" and everyone turned around and looked at me like I was crazy. I told them that they were out of their minds if they thought this was normal, that there was no world in which a 30 something should date an 18yo, and that she shouldn't be getting married. All of them accused me of ruining Ella's happiness. Some even said that I was jealous of Mark, which is so fucking disgusting I can't even explain it. I mean, I'm younger than Mark, but never in a million years would I ever consider dating someone younger than 25. They told me that it was perfectly legal as they were both adults, which isn't true because they've been dating for a year and Ella turned 18 7 months ago, and that if they were happy that's all that matters.

I told them that they were sick for allowing this and that he was a predator but they wouldn't listen. I know this isn't my business, but I can't help but fear for Ella. She is young and doesn't really know what she's getting into. I'm really scared of her getting married and being unable to leave him when she realizes how sick it was. I then left and slammed the door, and have been receiving pretty wild messages and calls since then. I don't know if I was wrong for this and am just overreacting, and if I wasn't wrong I don't know what I can do to make them realize how wrong it is. AITAH?

**Does OOP and his family know anything about the BF’s background?**

> **OOP:** I quickly went over his facebook account so it’s not really verified info, but I saw pictures of him with his ex (I think?) and she looked 20-24 maybe? It’s still better but if the guy has a thing for younger girls that’s even more wrong. And it seems like he was still with his ex when he started dating my niece, so even weirder… 

**How did OOP’s niece meet the BF?**

> **OOP:** Through sports apparently. My niece does tennis and so does he, in the same club and they met during a tournament (at least that’s what she told me the first time she told me she had a boyfriend)

**Was the BF Ella’s coach when they met?**

> **OOP:** No I don’t think so. From what I understood, Ella was in a tournament in her club and she played against adults, she played against Mark and after he came to talk to her so they talked and that was basically it

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/FxekXi30AB): **November 9, 2024 (next day)**

If you didn't see my previous post, here's a tl;dr: my niece is 18 and getting married with a man who's 36. They started dating when she was 17. When she announced she was engaged I said that it was wrong that he was so much older than her, but everyone else found it okay.

So I've taken the past 24h to really reflect on all of this, I tried to take in most of the advice in the comments, and here's what I have decided. I don't think that me telling her and everyone that the relationship is weird was wrong, I do however think that I did it wrong and it was pretty harsh because it was in the heat of the moment. But I still find this very creepy and don't think she should get married.

What I've decided to do is:

1. Apologize to her. I sent her a text saying I was sorry for my outburst and that I should've thought it through beforehand. I told her that I never wanted to make her feel like I didn't want her to be happy, and that I loved her very much and had her best interests in mind.

2. Ask her if we could talk about this. I asked if she would be okay and free to hang out and maybe get coffee this week to talk about all of this with a clear head. I really want to try and get her to see why it's weird and that maybe marrying him is not a great choice.

3. Explain myself to my brother. I sent him a text saying that I was sorry for the way I said it, but that I still thought that it needed to be said. I explained to him why I think Mark is a predator and this relationship could have a very negative and damaging impact on Ella.

I'm still waiting on their replies. I'll update when they reply, or when I see Ella (if she accepts), depending on how long it would take.

In the meantime, I really want to thank everyone who gave me advice and was constructive, and really tried to help my niece out of this situation. I also send my best to all of the people in the comments sharing similar stories when they were the teenager getting groomed. I'm so sorry this happened to you and I really hope you're doing better now.

**Relevant Comments**

**OOP should be there for his niece should she have any further concerns or worries about her relationship with her BF**

> **OOP:** If she doesn’t want to talk about it then fine, it’s her choice. But the least I can do is ask her if she’d want to. You don’t just “let it go” when it’s predators we’re talking about. Do you know how trapped she can be for years if she goes through with it? The least I can do is try my best to let her know that it’s weird before she makes such a commitment. And if she doesn’t want to hear it then fine, but no one should just “let it go” when it comes to these things

+

> Yeah I’ll definitely let her know that I’m always there, and be ready to help her get out of the relationship when it all goes wrong. But I think it’s also important to try and talk her out of it. It might not succeed, but if there’s even the slightest chance that it might then it’s worth trying. I’d rather she gets out of the relationship now than in 3 years when she’s traumatized by this guy

&nbsp;

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/kGPvQ3Kjuj): **November 12, 2024 (four days later)**

Tl;dr of first posts: My 18yo niece is engaged to a 36yo she started dating when she was 17. No one in the family sees a problem. I asked to meet her to talk about it.

So, following my text (see last post), Ella replied and told me she agreed to meet with me and talk. I just came back from seeing her.

Here's how it went. She asked me what I wanted to tell her and I started explaining that I didn't think her relationship was very healthy, and that no older guy should want to date a teenager. I told her that she was an incredible woman so I wasn't saying it was weird that someone would want to marry her, but that guys my age normally shouldn't even look at a teenager. She wasn't convinced and said that sometimes it's true but sometimes it's okay. I asked her how she would feel if I told her that someone born today could be her future partner, and she said it felt really weird. I also asked her if she would consider dating someone younger than 15, and she said no.

I could see her starting to realize that Mark maybe didnt have the best intentions. I also asked her if she knew about his previous relationship, and she said ""vaguely"" and just told me the girl's name. I asked her if she knew how old the girl was and she said she was 21. I also asked her if she knew that their relationships overlapped and she said that Mark always told her he was single since they met, but she kind of felt like that wasn't true. I told her that since his previous girlfriend was also significantly younger it seemed like he had a thing for younger girls, which is kind of weird.

After discussing that, she told me a bit more about her relationship. She told me she was starting to feel weird about it because of Mark's recent behavior. I asked what she meant and she said that he had been flirting with a lot of girls, who were all also younger, including some of Ella's friends. When she confronted him he sort of gaslit her into thinking it wasn't flirting. He was also making a lot of comments about having children with Ella and how cute it would be to see her raise them. She told me she was absolutely not ready for that and also wanted to go to college and work and not be a SAHM. Because of all of that she was doubting her relationship and I told her that I understood.

She said she was scared of breaking up with him because he had become her whole life recently and she didn't know what she would do without him. I told her that she was surrounded by people who loved her and would be there for her, and that she was a lot more than just Mark's girlfriend. I said that she knew my opinion on it, but that ultimately the choice was hers, and that I just wanted her to be happy. I also said I would be there for her no matter what. She told me that she will try to break up with him this week, and she'll let me know how it goes. I'll edit this post if I have more info.

Also, again, thank you to everyone who gave advice and tried to help us. I really appreciate it.

Edit: Okay so I just want to say, some people in the comments seem to think that this is fake, and you know what, I can understand. And I don't really care, I'm not asking you to believe that my life is real or fake, and it's great that you don't just believe everything you see online. But I just want to say this: there are hundreds of people on here or elsewhere that share similar stories. I'm not really affected by people thinking I'm lying, mainly because I'm not the one in that situation. But some people might be. Some people come on here to share something that might have traumatized them, and the last thing they want is for others to think they're lying. So if you don't want to believe me that's fine, but the next time keep that to yourself. It's fine to not believe something, but you don't have to say it, because it might make other people feel really bad.

[Update #3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/bLymIxqNlx): **December 9, 2024 (almost one month later)**

I know it's been a while since I posted the last update and a lot of people have been requesting updates on the whole situation, but until now I hadn't really received any news. So please forgive me if this update took a while to come.

Since my conversation with Ella, I would check in on her once or twice a week and ask how things were and she'd always tell me pretty much the same as what she told me a month ago. Basically, there were many red flags and she was getting more and more uncomfortable in her relationship but she also didn't know how to break up with him. I tried to give her some advice but eventually told her that I thought she should do it when she felt comfortable.

Yesterday I called her to know what she had planned on Christmas and if she'd be coming to the Christmas dinner that I was hosting, and if Mark would be coming. That's when she told me that she had broken up with him the evening before. She was pretty shaken up so I didn't ask for too much detail and asked if she wanted to come to my house for a while. She said that Mark had left to stay with his family when she told him, so she was okay staying home.

This is maybe not a very detailed update but here's what I know. She told me that he had been getting angry at her all week for small things. And then they were talking about Christmas and he insisted that they shouldn't go with Ella's family and instead spend a week with his family because they see them less often (they live out of state). And after that he made a comment about how he hoped that the next year as a present they could give his mother a grandchild, and Ella said that's what really made her break up with him. And she also told me that she would be coming alone for Christmas.

I don't know what she told him or how he reacted, and maybe she'll tell me more in a while when she feels better, and if not I won't ask her to. If I get more information I'll edit this post but for now that's it. Again, thank you to anyone who gave advice and tried to help with this situation.

#----NEW UPDATE----

[Final Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/AqrSa0yAb7): **June 24, 2025 (6.5 months later from the last update)**

I know it has been months since my last update, and to be honest I logged off reddit and completely forgot about it. My niece and I were just reminiscing about everything that happened and I decided to show her the posts I had made back then and the comments. She read a lot of it and wanted me to thank all of the people that were kind and gave advice or tried to help her. She also told me to tell all the people who shared similar stories how sorry she was that it happened to them.

Some people were also asking for updates so we wanted to let you know what the situation was. Since she broke up with him, Mark has tried to come back multiple times, apologizing for the things he said and trying everything to win her back. He was very insistent but she never took him back and I'm really proud of her for that. She managed to find a nice apartment and has cut all contact with him.

I guess you could say that all's well that ends well. It wasn't easy but Ella has been strong and now she's happier than ever, which is the only thing that matters.

Thank you to everyone who helped and supported her, your kindness means a lot to the both of us. Wishing you all the best.

Edit: I forgot to say this and I feel like it's important to share it. While we were talking Ella was originally telling me that she was very ashamed and felt stupid for not seeing how bad the relationship was. She somehow felt like it was her fault for being too naive. I reassured her and told her that in no way was it her fault, but what really helped her see that was reading all of the similar experiences that happened to other people. Maybe it seems stupid but she realized that it wasn't any of those people's fault so it wasn't hers either, and she wasn't the one who should be ashamed. All of this to say, this is the very reason why I think it's so important to talk about those things. Just knowing that you're not alone, that it happened to others can really help. To anyone out there going that went or is going through something similar, you are not alone.

**Relevant / Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Good to hear! Did anything happen with your bro or family (ie they apologized or agreed with you)?

> **OOP:** They didn't apologize directly but they had a big conversation with Ella and she told them about all of the things she realized were really weird and disturbing in the relationship so I guess it opened their eyes and they now agree that it was not really a normal relationship. Everything is good with them now

**Commenter 2:** All's well that ends well. You're a great uncle to have stood by Ella otherwise situations like these doesn't end up too well and there are way too many examples on reddit itself. Wishing you a good life ahead.

However, halfway through the service I had what I can only assume to be a panic attack (based on symptoms and talking to my mother/fiancé who both struggle with panic attacks). This is **not** “normal” for me — I’ve had my fair bit of anxiety but never this degree of true panic for seemingly no reason. 

I struggled but stuck it out and made it through coffee hour — something I’m grateful for. 

Whether this was an anomaly because I didn’t eat enough that morning, or whether it was some form of “spiritual warfare,” I don’t want to focus on the dark and want to turn my focus to Christ our Light.

**AITA for shutting someone down when they tried to talk to me at the gym?**

**Trigger Warnings:** >!harassment, invasion of privacy!<

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/Kq9TV6rUNE): **June 23, 2025**

So, for context, I (F32) don’t talk to anyone at my gym outside of saying hi and bye to the people who work there, and having polite etiquette when asking someone if they’re using something/saying thank you when they’re done. This is partially for efficiency, but mostly because I go to the gym stoned AF and I’m in my zone and I don’t want to talk to anyone.

Last week, after my work out, I walked over to the food carts by my gym to pick up tacos. While I was there, some guy (M40+) stopped me and said he went to the same gym. I had never noticed him before but he like insisted on walking with me and was talking to me. I was kind of annoyed — just because you see me on the street with my headphones out doesn’t mean it’s an invitation to talk to me. I made small talk and tried to be polite. Got out as quick as I could.

So the other day, when I’m at the gym foam rolling out with my headphones in, this guy just beelines to me while I’m trying to avoid eye contact, and squats down next to me to say hi and give me a fist bump. I give him a quick heads up acknowledge him but ignore the fist bump. Avoid eye contact the rest of the time I’m there.

And then today, this guy comes into the gym and sees me. I immediately avoid eye contact and he doesn’t come up to me, so I think he gets the picture. But then, when I’m doing leg lifts, he comes over and tries to give me a fist bump.

So I take out my headphone and I say “Look man, I don’t want to do this. I’m here to work out, I’m not here to make friends. I don’t want to talk to you, okay.” And he starts to say “I was just saying hi.” And I respond with “Yeah, I get it. Please don’t.” And put my headphone back in and kept working out.

I realize anyone who saw this probably thought I was a giant AH. But, I don’t think someone’s need for connection overrides my need to have a good workout. So, AITAH?

**Verdict: Not the Asshole**

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** NTA, sounds like your usual type who thinks gyms are a place to pick people up and not in fact a place to work out.

I do find it weird that you go to the gym stoned though, kind of like going to the pub first for a few beers.
> 
> **Downvoted Commenter:** Yeah using gym equipment, especially weights, when you're on drugs seems crazy dangerous.
>> 
>> **OOP:** I literally started going to the gym 15 years ago because I started getting stoned and listening to music. It’s my happy place and helps me focus on my breathing.
>> 
>> But, yeah, I’ve gotten that reaction to it a lot!

**Commenter 2:**NTA. Coming from a father, I hope my daughter has the boundaries you do when she’s grown. You don’t owe anyone your attention. You rock though!

> **OOP:** Coming from someone who lost their father young, this comment means the world to me. Happy belated Father’s Day!

**Commenter 3:** Sometimes I think a gym should have wrist bands: one for those who want to socialize, another for those that want no interaction. Take the guess work out of who wants to be chatty?

> **OOP:** Love this idea, honestly!

**Downvoted Commenter:** How do you feel about yourself? Probably not great, right? :/

> **OOP:** Actually I feel great about setting boundaries. I finished my work out on a great note

**UPDATE #1: (On the same post, same day, hours later**

For people saying this would have been different if he was an attractive guy. I stumble and get awkward no matter who it is if the conversation needs to go beyond more than a single question and response. Men, women, children. This isn’t a “want it” or “don’t want it” situation as much as it’s a “I’m not in a headspace where I can have human conversation.”

For people saying this is the same type of person who wonders why guys don’t ask them out: I keep a little post it note in my gym bag that says “Hi, my name is (name). I think you’re cute, but I want to respect your gym time. Text me if you want to get coffee sometime.” I’ve never given it to anyone, but it’s there if I ever feel like I need it.

Anyway, I’m at work. Hope everyone has a great day!

**Final Update posted June 24, 2025/Same Post**

FINAL UPDATE:

Wow. While I figured posting this might be a little divisive, I didn’t expect it to blow up like this.

I went to the gym today and had one of the best workouts I’ve had in a long time — partly because I was fueled by the overwhelming support I received from people who understood the importance of asserting boundaries. So thank you to everyone who saw where I was coming from.

For anyone who still thinks I’m the AH — I can live with that. But before I go, I want to share something that happened to me a couple of months ago. Maybe it’ll give you something to chew on.

I was at the same gym, in the middle of isolated bicep curls. End of the rep, second-to-last set to failure. I was slowing the movement, fully concentrated, eyes closed.

When I opened them — a stranger’s face was three inches from mine.

Startled, I set the weight down and looked over to see a plump, middle-aged man in a baseball cap. I took out one of my headphones, still in shock, and all I could say was, “What the f***?!”

He then grabbed my arms and forced them back onto the machine’s handles, saying “One more!”

I pulled away and snapped, “Who the f*** do you think you are?” His face fell as he muttered, “I was just admiring your work.” I told him, “I’m in the middle of a f*ing set.” He got defensive, saying, “Actually, I wanted to use that.” I replied, “You can use it when I’m not in the middle of a set.”

He rolled his eyes and walked off. I was left shaking.

As I started to put my headphone back in, another man approached and waved. I took it back out, and he said, “You really shouldn’t have to put up with that.”

I smiled and said thanks. He walked away. I got back to my set.

I didn’t need a knight in shining armor, just a little backup so it’s not 1 v 1. It’s sad, but men like the one who put his hands on me generally back off the second they see another man involved.

⸻

Now here’s what I’ll say: Baseball Cap Guy was way more out of line than the guy who approached me at the food carts — even by the third time, when I finally snapped at him.

I reported that incident to the gym manager. They took it seriously, walked through the whole event with me, and I gave the best description I could. I haven’t seen that man since. Whether he was banned or just stopped showing up, I don’t know.

As for the guy from the food carts — he hasn’t approached me again. We’ve been in the same space at the gym a couple times, but I’m very good at pretending people don’t exist during workouts. I appreciate that he respected my boundaries. I see no reason to report him.

⸻

But here’s what I want to leave you with:

The man who approached me right after that first incident — the one who said I shouldn’t have to put up with it — Why did he say that to me, instead of to him?

Why is it easier to comfort a woman in distress than it is to call out the man who caused it?

I do think he meant well. I appreciated it in the moment. But I still have to ask:

When given the choice between verbally comforting a woman and actually intervening — Why do so many men choose comfort over protection? Why is it harder to confront predatory behavior than it is to empathize with its aftermath?

That’s all I have to say. This will be my final update.

**MOOD SPOILER:** >!infuriating and horrifying!<

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/nlA8XYgMNz)  **Sept 28, 2022** 

This post will probably be long and I’ll try not to ramble too much. And hope that this post is easy to follow. But I’m not sure how to handle the situation at hand so I need advice. 

For context: My parents are swingers. I found out about them being swingers right after I graduated high school in 2016. I’ve never really had an opinion on the matter until recently. I don’t care what they do behind closed doors, but i personally don’t want to see it in person. (I’m sure that makes me sound like a bad person. But I’ve always accepted them for who they are. It’s honestly just really weird to see my parents make out with other people when they’re around a group of people.) Anyways, They are in a relationship with another couple, and have been with them for almost 2 years. They (being the other couple) just recently moved in with my parents because they lost their house and couldn’t find another place in time. My parents kicked my sister, her fiancé, and their baby out of the basement in order to give their friends the space and put my sister, her fiancé and baby upstairs in one bedroom to share. Which is a small 12x12 room. The friends have also stated that they’re ‘another set of grandparents’ for my niece and call themselves grandma (insert name) and papa (insert name). My sister and her fiancé are not comfortable with this but my parents and their friends don’t seem to care because ‘they’re all together as one.’ 

Now, onto the vacation. We were supposed to go on our first ever family vacation last year (October 2021) but it ended up getting pushed back to April of this year, due to costs, because of my wedding, which everyone was fine with. It then got pushed back again, because my sister was in her third trimester of her pregnancy and couldn’t fly. It is now scheduled for February of 2023. My parents told my sister and I, along with our SO’s that they would be bringing their friends along on the vacation. And I’m frustrated about it to be honest. With the way that they’ve been handling things with my sister and with all of their PDA, it’s made me not want to go anymore. It’s our first ever family vacation, like I’ve already mentioned, and I wanted it to be just family. I’m at a loss and I’m not sure how to handle the situation. And I/we don’t want to upset my parents about how I (and everyone else; my husband, sister and BIL) feel. Any advice? 

EDIT: I’m married and do not live at home anymore. Although my sister, her fiancé, and baby do. They’re currently looking for places. We live in a state where cost of living is super high (like a lot of places right now). And with them only having one income it’s harder for them to find something. Hopefully that clears things up! 

Edit #2: I didn’t expect this to get as much attention as it did. And I have read each comment and taken advice. So thank you. I’m fully aware that my parents are adults and can do what they want. I never once said that they couldn’t. And I never said I wasn’t against their relationship with this other couple (they refer to themselves as swingers, but yes, you could say they are in a polyamorous relationship). The issue I have is how they shove it down everyone’s throats. I don’t care what they do in private, behind closed doors. But once I see the PDA and the other things they do to each other when other people are around, that’s where I get uncomfortable around the situation. They have a calendar on the fridge that says what nights they will swap beds and sleep with the other person (ex; my mom and the other woman move between my dad and the other guy) There are also times where they make sexual jokes about screwing each other, or randomly flash each other WHEN WE ARE AROUND. like, at least wait until people aren’t there do so those things. That’s the part I’m not okay with.

>If I were you I’d invite them out somewhere for coffee or lunch or whatever without their friends. Explain that I appreciate that they see me as enough of an adult that they were able to be honest about their relationship with the other couple, but with that being said I’d hope that they can understand though how nobody wants to have their parents sexual relationships on display in front of them. I’d tell them that I’m uncomfortable with this new couple and do not view them as family regardless of the relationship they currently have with them. The upcoming trip was to be a family vacation and in light of all that is going on it is no longer something that would be a fun trip with my family and I will no longer be joining them. Let them be upset. They’ve decided who they want to spend time with. 

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/aZu8OwFskc)  **Oct 17, 2022 (1 month later)** 

Hi everyone!! A few weeks ago, I made a pot about my parents inviting their friends on a family vacation and said I’d give an update after I talked to my parents. 

Well, I did, and it didn’t go well… Also sorry the update took so long, I’ve been struggling with the outcome really badly and I needed time to write it all out. 

So, onto the update…. I brought up all of my feelings to my parents and they weren’t very happy. They asked why I never brought it up, and I told them that it was because I was fine with everything, until I started seeing it, and that’s when it made me uncomfortable. 

Now they think I don’t accept them for who they are and they don’t really see an issue with inviting their friends or doing other things with their friends in front of everyone else around. 

My mom basically said that what they do is none of my business, or anyone else’s, and they can do what they want. Which is true, they’re adults and CAN do what they want. But some of the things they do, should be in private settings, and not for others to see. 

They also consider their girlfriend and boyfriend to be family, again which is fine, I know many people do, and since it’s a family vacation, so they’re still inviting them, regardless of how everyone feels about it. I just want to be with my parents for once without their friends being there, and having them be all over each other. They also see no issue with their friends calling themselves grandparents to my niece. 

I got upset and told them my husband and I would not be attending the vacation and they could take someone else. And until they understand where I’m coming from, I would not be going around. So for the time being, my parents are being cut off. I’m very sad about the outcome, and it makes me sad that they would choose their friends over their own child. But to each their own I guess. 

Thank you all for the comments. I read every single one of them, even if I didn’t comment back, i still read them. 

There were some very nice supporting ones that really helped, and also some not very nice ones that also helped. So thank you all.

[I cut my parents out of my life and now my dad might be dying](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/c3KYaHVeAd)  **Jan 18, 2025 (over 2 years later)**

I cut my parents out of my life and now my dad might be dying. Idk what to do 

Hi everyone. I (27F) just came here for advice maybe? I don’t really know. I just needed a place to talk about this. There’s a ton of backstory, so I’ll try to explain it as much as I can, and hopefully it doesn’t get too confusing. (I also have another post regarding the subject from a couple of years ago, so maybe this is also kind of an update post!) 

My parents are in an open/polyamorous marriage. They started out as swingers when I was 7, and a few years ago they met another couple and decided to just be with them, which is fine. I am happy that they are happy, however, when the other couple (we will call them D and T) came into my parent’s life, my parents changed, they became very toxic/controlling and just all around not fun to be around. They don’t take anyone’s feelings into consideration and force their other partners into our lives, which over the last couple years, I have decided I don’t want to be around D&T. On multiple occasions, they were all inappropriate in front of us (my sister/her family and my husband and I), and it was just really uncomfortable in a lot of ways. 

&#x200B;

They (my parents) kicked my sister and her family out of their basement apartment and moved them to a small bedroom upstairs in their house, so they could move their other partners into their house. My niece was also only 2 months at this time. From there, things have just gotten worse. D&T refer to themselves as my second parents and as grandparents to my son and my niece. Which I have asked them not to do, since I barely know them. My parents have chosen their other partners over my sister/her family, and myself and my family many times. 

&#x200B;

My sister had to move emergenltly last year and my sister asked my mom if she could watch my niece since it was raining/snowing outside. And my mom said no because they were ‘going to spend the night playing Mario kart and didn’t want distractions.’ When I told them I was pregnant the VERY first thing my dad said to me was ‘Can we tell D&T?’ And I said no. After my son was born I went to my parents house for a short 30 minute visit and as soon as I got there my dad texted D to tell her I was there. So she and T came upstairs. My mom was holding my baby (8 weeks at the time) and when D&T came up, she handed my son to D WITHOUT ASKING ME. I was so upset. (I want to clarify I would have been upset if anyone just handed my baby to someone without asking me, I wasn’t upset just because of the person. You should never hold a baby without permission from the parent!!) 

&#x200B;

I had a very intimate religious ceremony (similar to a christening) where we only wanted family and our close friends. I invited my parents, and they asked if they could bring D&T and I said no because it was for family and close friends… So they decided not to come. They decided not to come to a FAMILY  event because I didn’t want their other partners there (which they consider family and I do not, which I have clearly tried telling them over YEARS of them being with D&T) Because this event was for my son, I decided they weren’t going to pull any more stunts. They weren’t going to choose them over me and my family anymore. So, I cut them out. I told them that I’m happy that they’re happy and because I know they love them, I wasn’t going to make them choose between us. I told them I wasn’t done being hurt and I needed time away from them. I haven’t seen or spoken to my parents since April of 2024. 

&#x200B;

I have tried telling my parents about my boundaries MANY times but they don’t listen and they just want us all to be ‘one big happy family.’ Which my sister and I (and our partners) don’t want. We both just want to be around our parents. 


Anyways, I got a text from my mom yesterday, saying my dad was just diagnosed with Heart Failure. And I have so many emotions. I’m angry, and I am also sad. My heart hurts. I don’t know what to do. Part of me is wants a better relationship with my parents., as long as my boundaries are followed, but another part of me has never been happier/felt more at peace these last 9 months. I just don’t want to have my dad pass and regret not letting him have a relationship with myself or my son. I just hate getting hurt by my parents all the time. 

&#x200B;

I am in therapy and have been working through everything for a while, but it’s still so hard. Any advice is appreciated and I will try to answer any questions anyone has. Thank you for taking the time to read this and I’m sorry if it’s confusing! 

EDIT: I want to say: my parents have been with other couples that I have LOVED. It wasn’t until D&T that I had an issue, and it’s because of the actions that they have done that have pushed me away. I am happy that my parents are happy, but I shouldn’t have to put myself in an uncomfortable position to make other people happy. So I ultimately decided to keep distance in order to make my mental health better. 

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**SnooWords4839**

>This is something you need to decide. They are only reaching out because of his condition, not because they want to be better parents.

>They already chose D & T over your son. Your son doesn't need to see them. You can go alone and see what is really going on. They want to guilt you into forgiving them. They haven't tried to apologize.

**OOP**

>>That’s how I feel. I feel like they’re pressuring me to see them when I’m not ready. My mom texted me a couple months back saying ‘How long are you going to stay away from us? Are we still toxic?’ And I feel like they’re blaming me for not seeing them when I voiced my boundaries countless times and they chose to ignore them. I know it’s not on me, but they’re making me feel like shit because I want to protect myself and my son from being hurt.

**mcindy28**

>You'll never have the relationship you want with your parents as it's clear they are selfish and will always include their partners. Don't feel guilty, they have never put you first.

**OOP**

>>Thank you! I needed to hear ‘don’t feel guilty.’ This whole situation has taken a toll on me for YEARS. I just learned I need to do what’s best for me and my little family.

**OOP gives examples of how they were inappropriate over the years**

>Examples of being inappropriate include: Them flashing each other in front of us, my dad pulling down his pants and mooning the front door when I walked in because he thought it was his girlfriend, and other inappropriate actions that shouldn’t be done in front of other people ESPECIALLY YOUR CHILDREN AND THEIR SPOUSES. T would put his hand on my back and I would ask not to be touched (I get very uncomfortable because of some SA from my childhood, so I don’t like being touched by many people). But yet, he would do it every time I saw them. I have tried many times to voice my boundaries and they have not been respected. If these Inappropriate behaviors stopped, I wouldn’t mind seeing them along with my parents, but I shouldn’t have to if I’m uncomfortable. 

>The boundaries I have voiced: I don’t want them calling themselves my ‘second parents’ or grandparents to my child. I don’t want to see all of their inappropriate PDA, I’m fine with a kiss, but the inappropriate stuff can wait until people aren’t visiting. I don’t consider them family, just as my parents don’t consider any of my friends family.

1los1cg,https://v.redd.it/jho5zc6lr6af1,How much do you care about latte art?,"Every coffee shop you go now, no matter where in the world, you see the same latte art—rosettas, tulips, hearts. Yeah it’s all clean, consistent, and photogenic, but lately I’ve been asking myself; is this still about craft, or are we just chasing visuals?

When every drink looks the same, is it really saying anything? Are we valuing how it looks over how it tastes? And if a robot can pour latte art (I shot this video at the MUJI store in downtown Portland), what does that say about how we define “skill” anyway?  

So, just throwing it out there:  

Has latte art become kind of…empty? Are we rewarding surface over substance? Is this performance more than it’s actual care?  

I haven't been ordering milk-based coffee drinks for a while now so I guess I shouldn't even care about this stuff, but would love to hear from folks—baristas, drinkers, skeptics. Curious where people land on this... ",0,1751342221.0,PNWcoffee,1,0.4,False

The slow and rhythmic white fog rises from the glowing pearl floor as the contrasting black sky stares back at my soul. It can see how I’ve reduced from flesh and blood to a fragment of a man who once was something. My body has turned into a white, glowing figure of who I used to be.

*So is this what death is like? Not what I had in mind.*

“Not death just yet,” a deeply mellow voice calls.

*What? Who are you? How can you hear my thoughts? Are you God?*

“No, but I know everything here. I guess that has to count for godhood in some way.”

A hauntingly skinny creature walks toward me from the distance of the void. Long limbs. Black skin. A tall, black top hat that only extends his figure. And a lantern he holds out, with a beautiful flame within.

“Are you not scared?” it calls out as it approaches. Its limbs stiff like a wooden doll.

*Not really. I’ve already died, so I don’t have anything else to really lose.*

I feel like this creature is something people feared. So I feel some sort of pity. The concept of being alone in this monochrome-colored world... with the figure now face to face with me, its dark wooden texture upon its skin sends a somber feeling of empathy through me. Who else but me would know the pain of isolation? I hope it finds my presence comforting, after being alone for who knows how long.

“Well, aren’t you a curious soul,” the creature says, looking down at me from its tall stature.

*Well, a black figure came up to me—I might as well observe it.*

As I stare at the figure, the periodic silence is broken by a request to walk with him. I comply with no resistance, of course—something about him holds an underlying feeling I can’t explain. It’s something that’s intense yet faint. Complex though simple. Everything but nothing, all at once. A feeling that makes me realize that this haunting look of his may just be a cover for something much more gentle.

Just who is this thing?

*So, who exactly are you? Why are you all alone?*

“Well, I’m Thanatos. A grim reaper, if you will—whose sole purpose is to help guide souls. Most feel fear at the sight of me. But you... you walk beside me without fear. Why?”

*I thought you knew everything.*

“I do. But the truth means little until you choose to see it.”

*Is this your means of giving me some sort of therapy post-death? There’s not really much for me to do with a better mindset here.*

“You could have held onto something beautiful... if you'd only hadn't let go.""

I pause, confused as to what he just said.

*Me? Let go?*

“I’m sorry you had to go through all that, curious soul. But to be truthful, if you had put in a little more effort in what you did, you might have had a completely different outcome. Maybe you wouldn’t even be here.”

The white noise of the void grows louder in my ears—just like how my anger begins to build. I know he knows everything, but he has no idea how I could possibly be feeling. After all the things I had gone through, he has the audacity to **lie** to me in an effort to comfort? Nobody knows what going through those events was like.

I take it back—Thanatos isn’t comforting.

*You don’t even know me. How could you be saying all these things after I’ve died? Are you TRYING to rub it in?*

“Do not mistake my words for cruelty curious soul. I am only here to show what could have been.”

*What could have been?*

As we walk, the surroundings slowly morph from a white-fogged void into a… school ground? The black sky turns into a beautiful blue, with a hue that feels all too familiar. Each step feels as nostalgic and regretful as the last, with students walking on the sidewalk and the occasional empty road. This day feels peaceful. The wind, a soft breeze—just like I remembered it. The calm before the storm.

Thanatos stops in front of two young adults. One: a blonde, charming woman with long, luscious hair blowing in the wind. The other: a small, timid boy who dreamt more than he could ever achieve.

*Why are we here? You know I wasn’t able to confess to her that day.*

“This young woman really appreciated you. She adored how you had this imagination and mindset of what you wanted to chase.” He stares pitifully at the two.

*I know she did. Sophia and I were really good friends back then.*

“Yes, but what you didn’t know was that she viewed you romantically as well. She admired how—even though she knew the things you’d say were realistically far-fetched—she cared about you. She highly respected your ability to dream back then.”

I’m speechless. I don’t know what to say. All these years, the woman I genuinely loved—the first time I ever truly loved someone—she felt the same way. But… I wasn’t able to tell her. I never got the chance because I was afraid. Afraid we’d lose what we had. And even then, I eventually lost her anyway. We parted ways upon graduation and never spoke after that day. With the experience at hand, memories of our friendship begin to resurface. The most memorable being our first meeting.

I was writing my road map for some of my aspirations when I was young in the middle of the stands as the school game went on. Everyone cheered and absorbed in the game while I was in my own little bubble. Until she came to me.

“I always see you writing in that notebook of yours. Maybe you ought to show it to me sometime?” Sophia requested as she sat down next to me.

I was nervous at the time. I wasn’t sure if she’d accept me for dreaming about such trivial things. Because who would really dream about making games for a living I thought. Yet, her warm tone from her request only made me want to open up to her.

“You can just have it. I have more at home.” I offer the notebook to her.

She skims through all the pages. In what looked like awe. I was so happy at the time. I was just glad I wasn’t going to be put away for such stupid dreams. I was happy that she was there. 

“You know… I don’t care what anyone else says but even if people say you’re small, your aspirations outsize you tenfold. You’re really not afraid to fly.”

The memory fades out as I'm brought back to the reality of my own demise.

*Do you know what would’ve happened if I had told her?*

“Yes, I do. You two would’ve lived a quiet and peaceful life in a suburban town where the seasons cycled through all four. You would’ve had a fun, romantic life. A family. Two children. Even now, she still thinks about you. She flips through the pages of your notebook and looks back on your texts from years ago. Her unresolved love for you left her alone and unable to love another man as she yearned for you to one day magically come to her in an embrace that can’t exist in her world.”

*So is it my fault? That she’s like this?*

“No, curious soul. Individuals who encounter people who change their lives must learn how to change themselves before changing with others. It’s better she’s left off this way—like how a flower can’t bloom without prioritizing its own self-care.”

The beautiful sky twists back into the void of darkness as we continue walking in the same direction. Buildings around us morph into white mist, settling back into that hauntingly glowing white floor. The fog settles in again, and I realize I really messed up that day. Feelings I thought I wanted to end… resurface. A form of pity I can’t explain. I feel destroyed.

“There’s more too, you know. Your life really had so much potential in it.”

*What…?*

“I won’t show you if you don’t want to.”

I look down at the misted floor as we walk. If I don’t let him tell me… am I wasting another opportunity? Like I did before? Would that be a grave mistake?

I think about it for a full minute. I’m afraid to know… but I feel like it’s something I need to hear. I don’t want to miss another chance.

*It’s fine. Show me.*

A cloud of mist rises around us, swirling into the shape of house walls. The voided sky fading into a beautiful golden sunrise spilling through the windows as the scent of freshly cut grass and coffee was amidst. Beneath the window was a bright young man working on a project on his computer with the chatter of friends or co-workers in the background. 

*I hate this guy.*

“Why? He is you.”

*I know. It’s just that he really thought this coding thing was for him. That it* ***meant*** *something.*

The young man types his final line of code. He leans in to check the public reviews of his “Life’s work”.

His once-excited smile begins to wilt.

His once-excited smile slowly fades into something expressionless.

Every comment— *“Inefficient.”* *“Subpar.”* *“Abysmal.”*

—claws at his soul. Again. Again. And again.

What once felt like critique begins to twist into condemnation. Cold. Personal.

They weren’t judging the project anymore.

They were judging *him*.

“Do you remember those sleepless nights? The ones that would eat your mind away? The ones that questioned if this was what your purpose really was?”

*Of course I do. I hated how I couldn’t even do the one thing I was good at. The one thing that gave me purpose and meaning in this world. The one thing that gave me* ***worth***\*. That’s why I locked myself in my room for the rest of my life. Because if the one thing that gave me meaning — the one thing that gave me\* ***worth*** *— isn’t real… then what is?*

“Doing what you had loved. The thing that gave you meaning. Development.”

*Do I have to repeat myself to you? I was a failure. Why would something that destroyed me be something for me?*

“Because a different future awaits you. One where you got back up. One where you kept trying. One where you were respected. Admired. All you needed was a little effort… and faith in yourself.”

It’s right… I never did try again while I hid away. I let the scars of my failure define me. Let it consume me. I thought I lost my worth when I failed but… I lost it when **I** stopped believing in myself.

Thanatos and I continue to walk as the walls turned back into a misty fog. The smell escaping the experience as the sky turns back to its endless void. As the mist settles back I hear something in the disappearing wind—

“Daniel, are you in there?” a soft feminine voice calls out as knocking ensues. 

I look back at the disappearing house to find nothing. All that’s left is the memory of my mother. The one that cared and loved me dearly when I was alone. Isolated. The thought of how my mother is doing after my death lingered in my mind. I hoped deep down that my mother would forget about me. Thus curiosity got the best of me.

*Do you know what happened to my mom after I died?*

Silence so loud that the footsteps felt muted ensued. A truly sorrowful face showed upon Thanatos’s face. I was nothing but worried. Hoping. Praying she’s ok.

“I do, but I must warn you. What you may hear will not be what you want.”

*I need to know. This is something I HAVE to know. The mother who had been with me through thick and thin. I must make sure she’s doing well without me.*

Thanatos proceeds to tell me how my suicide had severely affected my mother. She was left to organize a funeral that nobody attended. I had severed so many relationships when I locked myself in. Cut every tie to the outside world just to shut myself away with my computer. The only person who genuinely felt pain was her. Everyone else stood over my coffin like mannequins, while a grieving mother cried so hard the rain couldn’t mask it. And after that, she would visit my grave daily. Alone. In the rain. Holding my old electronic toys. Talking to me. Reminiscing.

She would often sit in my empty room, talking to herself about the good times she had with her child. The child she raised. The one she nurtured through everything. The one she *truly* loved—even after the divorce. The one and only light in her life. Now fizzled out and cold.

After all, a mother **never** forgets.

We stop. I notice my body start to fade.

“This is it,” Thanatos says. “Thank you for walking with me. I’m sorry your life had to end this way.”

I see her again. Alone in her room. Praying. Pleading for her son to come back to her arms. I hear Sophia’s voice. One that was once warm, is now cold as it yearns for a love that will never be returned. 

My life? Right. But... It can’t end now. Not with grieving people left behind.

*Thanatos. Please. I can’t go. Not yet.*

Confused, he kneels down to look into my eyes. The light—almost completely gone.

“I’m sorry… but you’ve already died. I can’t—”

***PLEASE***\*. I NEED TO HELP MY MOTHER. I CAN’T LEAVE HER ALONE. I CAN’T LEAVE SOPHIA ALONE. I CAN’T LET THEM GO THROUGH WHAT I DID.\* ***PLEASE***\*, I NEED TO FIX THIS\*

I want to scream, but I can’t. My mind only pleads—silently for Thanatos, desperately—for mercy in death.

A thought I never thought I’d have until now.

The regret eats at me harder than the fading ever could.

I **have** to see them again.

Thanatos looks at me with sorrow. Pity. My desperate clinging says more than words could.

I cannot let go.

I have too much I regret.

Hey everyone,

I'm a 24-year-old guy, recently shifted to Ahmedabad for work. My office is in Prahladnagar, and while the city feels new and full of life, I often find myself feeling a little lost and disconnected here.

Honestly, I don't really have anyone around to talk to, hang out with, or just share those everyday little moments — a coffee after work, late-night random talks, or even silly jokes after a long tiring day.

Life feels a bit robotic lately — office, home, sleep, repeat. I’m really hoping to find a few genuine, like-minded people to build actual friendships with. I miss that feeling of belonging and effortless conversations.

If you're someone who also feels the same way or just wants to connect and share this city with someone new, I’d truly love to talk, maybe meet up for coffee, explore food places, or just chill and be human again.

Feel free to drop a message. Let’s make this city a little warmer, together. 😊",1,1751341914.0,ahmedabad,6,0.99,False

When they said they didn't have drip coffee (or pour-over, or french press, whatever, just a normal-ass cup of coffee), I was just like...okay I just won't get anything. But they kept REPEATEDLY trying to push an Americano or a heated-up cold brew on me, and tbh it was kind of annoying because they were pretty condescending about it and kept saying that it would taste the same. They just couldn't accept that I rather wouldn't have anything.

Don't get me wrong, I can enjoy a small sugary instagram-worthy warm milkshake-with-a-splash-of-coffee drink every once in a while. And I do love cold brew. But heated cold brew just sounds weird (I'd try that though), and I didn't want that much caffeine. And damn near every Americano I've had just tastes bad, it's just a weird gross watery espresso. I just wanted a cup of coffee.

What doesn't make sense to me is...why is there no drip coffee AT ALL..? Like I get that the main market is for the milk-based drinks, but I have literally never seen a coffee shop that doesn't have SOME kind of non-espresso coffee. Like even Starbucks has that. It CAN'T be a cost thing right? Like you can use the same beans, and a coffee machine is definitely an expense (albeit not a huge one in the grand scheme of things) but I'd imagine that's just part of the cost of business in running a coffee shop? And that means no standard iced coffee? Is this just some oversight and somehow it's never come up? It's such a common drink, I mean like every single hotel, office building, and household has a way to do this. I'd maybe get it if a manual pour-over was the only option because that's time-consuming, but that's why you can just make a large batch with a machine.

At exactly 3:13 AM, I woke up to whispering.

Not the usual creaks of an old house or the wind outside—this was intentional, like someone was just inches from my ear. I sat up, heart pounding, and looked around.

No one was there.

I live alone.

The next night, it happened again. Same time: 3:13. Same sound—faint, raspy whispers. I couldn’t make out the words. They were too fast. Too soft. But there was something off about the rhythm… like chanting.

I started recording on my phone. Nothing came up—just static. But the next morning, I noticed something on the floor.

A single footprint.

Bare. Wet. And not mine.

By Friday, I was terrified to go to sleep. I drank coffee at midnight. Tried to stay up. But sometime around 3:00, I must have dozed off. When I woke up—3:13 again.

This time, the whispering was right next to my bed.

I didn’t open my eyes.

I couldn’t.

The air felt thick. Cold. My body was paralyzed—not from sleep, but fear.

Then something breathed in my ear. Not whispered. Breathed.

And it said, “You heard us now. So you belong.”

I screamed.

The whispering stopped.

I haven’t slept since.

But here’s the worst part—I moved out two days later. New apartment. Clean. Bright. Safe.

But every night, at exactly 3:13 AM, my phone turns on by itself…
And starts playing a recording.

Of whispering.

Zaydism, a branch of Shiʿi Islam dating to the eighth century CE, has historic roots in the Northern Highlands of Yemen and the Caspian regions of Northern Iran, and its literary tradition is among the richest within Islamic civilization. The most significant and by far largest collections of Zaydi manuscripts are housed by the many public and private libraries of Yemen, an endangered cultural heritage tradition, currently at risk due to the conflict and warfare in Yemen. Of great importance are also holdings of Yemeni manuscripts that are kept elsewhere. 

In view of the poor state of scholarship in the area of Zaydi studies, the challenges that result from the significant dispersal of the material are manifold. Yemeni Manuscript Cultures in Peril contributes to the history of books and libraries and their role in the scholastic culture in Yemen, past and present.

Her initial fieldwork was on divination and magic, a theme at the intersection of textual studies and anthropology, “texts in practices and practices in text.” This was her first contact with manuscripts in Yemen. In 2001 she became the scientific director of the Program for Safeguarding Manuscripts of Private Libraries in Zabid, a cooperative program based on the training of a Zabidi team. She directed the compilation of four catalogs of Yemeni manuscripts, one of them on digitized watermarked papers (2008). When the war between the Gulf Cooperation Council and the Houthis started in 2015, she organized and took part in numerous events to draw attention to the endangered heritage of Yemen. She has published extensively on Yemeni manuscripts and codicology, including The Trade in Papers with Non-Latin Characters (Leiden: Brill, 2018). She has been the director of the online journal Nouvelles Chroniques du manuscrit au Yémen, originally the Chroniques du manuscrit au Yémen, since 2006.

Me: you know I’m falling so insanely in love with you, right?

Him: I love you. It’s the easiest thing I’ve ever done or known. You’re it, for me

*silence* 

*the deepest, calmest breath, I’ve ever taken*

The warm, musky, old fashioned smell when opening to the first page of the most familiar, beloved, and worn book on the bookshelf. 

The flickering glow and occasional crackle of the embers of the final log in the fireplace on Christmas Eve, I’m 8 years old, my dad at full health, asleep and quietly snoring with his glasses on across the room in his chair. I quietly understand for the first time who Santa is. And my eyes well with tears, overcome by the true magic that is, well, him. I’m so loved, I briefly grasp, before scurrying upstairs. 

My grandma’s gentle voice tucking me in after she had spent two hours telling me stories and slowly administering ear drops for my ear infection in as comfortable a way as possible, snow lightly falling outside. “Pain exists, we don’t know why, but it never lasts forever” she says. 

The rising and falling rhythm of my niece’s tiny newborn heart in my arms as I sink into the couch of their little walk up apartment after work on a Monday, my breath slowing, the city noise silenced. It’s just us. 

The late afternoon sun casting dancing shadows across my barefoot mom in her dirt covered long yellow dress in the kitchen, her hair wild, as she arranges fresh flowers and I sit at the counter doing homework, in awe, understanding for the first time as an awkward gangly pre teen what beautiful means. 

My sister’s hand gently yet firmly landing on top of my shaking fingers, in our stiff side-by-side chairs in the corner of the sterile, frightening rehab intake office. “You’re my best friend, and I love you, I believe in you, I’m sorry, I forgive you, and I need you”, she whispers, confidently. 

The 10 seconds of infinity when I open my eyes, clearheaded on early Saturday mornings and feel, in the deepest sense, sober and alive, and at peace with being alone. The feeling that the most serene sunrise is somehow happening at the very same instant as the most magnificent sunset, and I’m there. Floating there. Me? How am I this lucky? This is worth it. 

And finally, a run down subway train huffing and creaking slowly into the end of the line stop after a long summer day, the last two tired passengers looking up and smirking at one another in silence, laughing quietly at the absurdity that they are somehow both on this earth. So distracted by this reality that they forgot, maybe intentionally, to get off earlier. 

Sweat from his lower back sticks to his shirt. He puts his book away and takes off his glasses. Her sneakers mismatch her shapeless black work dress. Dark circles under her eyes. A poppyseed from a mid day bagel caught between two of his teeth. The door opens to the outside. The smell of trash, and anger, and failures, and a million goodbyes, and hellos, and ignored messages, and rejections, and missed connections, and stress, and exhaustion, and transience, and lies, and silly petty fights, and comparisons, and unknowns. 

I guess the end? But also I guess the beginning? No, no, that’s not right, she thinks. It’s just now. Right now. 

And she contemplates, looking at his perfect face, that maybe they can stay there, at that ugly last stop, in peace, for a bit longer. Because it’s the most beautiful instant in the world, with him. 

Maybe it isn’t about the World Series grand slam in the bottom of the 9th, reach for the stars, heart bursting sensations we hear about. Perhaps not about that endless stream of elaborate fireworks or candle lit beach walkways and highly filtered backdrops to “I do” flashing from the confines of 1080 x 1080 pixel square boxes glowing harshly off our phone screens at 2am when we are single and can’t sleep and are really wondering what’s “wrong” with ourselves. You know, the world altering, boom! “here we are. We are in love. And we have *this* to show for it. See? This is what love is” cheap stuff that’s thrown around and marketed to us both subliminally and directly right from the very first time we see a kiss acted out on a screen. 

Maybe it’s about that quiet look of understanding, in a retiring-for-the-night dirty subway train, no one there to witness it, no one that could ever understand it until it arrives for them, out of nowhere, in their own instant, no real string of silly words to ever aptly describe it. Certainly no material display big enough, or expensive enough, on this earth to adequately represent it. 

But you hold their sweaty hand and make the easiest decision you’ve both ever made. And you get off together, not alone. 

And then you just kind of keep deciding that. 

One step after another. Over. And over. And over. And somewhere in your deepest self - the part of us not explained by science or logic - the part philosophers and romantics and filmmakers and poets and random nobodies like myself, with this rambling nonsensical post, have been trying for thousands of years to define - you feel it. A conclusive understanding. Ah, your whole little life, and self, and humanity, does, actually, make a bit of…sense?!

Your purpose. It’s so clear. Your “correct” choices and the most significant moments from your small life suddenly so there, all together in your brain at once. Nothing else. 

To love. To appreciate. And to be loved. And to be appreciated. To be safe. To create safety for those you love. 

It’s not new. It’s not life shattering. It’s always been that. But you couldn’t have known conclusively, until right now. The knowing required this person next to you. These circumstances. And really, nothing else matters. It never has. 

So I’m no expert. Hell, I spent 30+ years oscillating between thinking I wasn’t cut out for it, faking it, or writing it off as a load of BS. But I do think that perhaps true love, and truly unconditionally loving one person, is real. 

It’s not loud. Or showy. Or perfect. Or manicured. Or even able to be put on display to others. Because in reality, living a fully present life isn’t, either (As much as we try to pretend it is, with more and more apps, and social media, and “things” we hyperfixate on to compare and connect over). 

And I firmly believe the two, living fully and unconditionally loving one other person, are not independent, but inextricably intertwined.

Maybe it’s supposed to be quiet. And nuanced. And weird. And subtle. And a little ugly. 

Maybe, just maybe, it’s supposed to be the easiest choice you’ll ever make. 

To hold his hand and love him, and to continue choosing to live, as you have been, but now a whole lot more fully aware and appreciative of how incredibly intertwined and beautiful it all is. All those moments of love in your life. Made all the more incredible by the fact that no person, no computer, no algorithm, no “leader”, no marketing department, will ever be able to adequately label or describe it. That moment of knowing. Of being in love. Finally. It’s got to be the best, most inexplicable piece of, well, being human.

1lorlyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lorlyo/aitah_for_not_saying_no_again_and_again/,AITAH for not saying ‘No’ again and again?,"Posting it again because it got removed….

A few months ago, I (24F) joined a large creative agency. It was my first time working in such a fast-paced, high-pressure setup. I was new, overwhelmed, and just trying to survive.

During one of the first office hangouts, I met this guy let’s call him Ayaan. He was wearing a Swiggy delivery jacket as a joke. I looked at him and thought, “He’s too polished to be a delivery guy,” which he caught and laughed at. That was our first exchange. I casually asked if he sings, and when he said, “Why’d you ask that?” I replied, “You’ve got a nice voice.” (I was very serious here, and not flirtatious) 

Apparently, that one sentence was enough for him to latch on.

The next day, he asked for my number. Before I could respond, he pulled it from the office WhatsApp group without my consent. He also stalked my Instagram, which I’d never shared with him. He started messaging me constantly, asking me out for coffee, lunch, dinner, or after-work hangouts.

I said no to everything, consistently and politely. But he just would not stop. Every day, a new excuse to text or corner me at work. I didn’t want to be rude, I was still new and didn’t want to create unnecessary awkwardness but he kept pushing.

Eventually (after a month or so), I said yes to a movie. Not because I wanted to go — I didn’t. I just thought if I gave him that one chance, he’d finally leave me alone. I was tired and honestly just wanted it to stop. Also I kinda felt guilty for some reason. 

The date was awful. He showed up high red eyes, smelling like weed. At dinner, all he did was talk about his exes, trauma, and how he once dated an actress who “turned bi.” I kept hinting I wanted to leave, said it was late, my mom was calling, even stood up to go.

He ignored everything. Brushed it off with jokes. At one point, he said, “Let me talk to your mom, I’ll tell her I’m taking care of her daughter.” I was creeped out.

When we finally left the restaurant, I walked to my car, got in, and even started it. He walked up and literally stopped me from leaving. Then stood around outside smoking a cigarette and dragging the goodbye for another 20 minutes while I stood there, deeply uncomfortable. (Also here as well, I said multiple times that “I should leave, it’s getting late”, but he just straight up ignored me) 

Then after a few days, he kept texting, begging me to watch Minions with him, wanted to come to my house at night. I said no. He pushed. “Your family’s in town? So what?” Then he asked to FaceTime and watch it together. I refused, again and again. Eventually, just to make it stop, I gave in once and that was my mistake. I thought it would give him closure. Instead, he acted like he had access.

When I finally said, “I don’t want to do this. I don’t want any part of this,” he replied:
“Like, you don’t want a part of this ever? You know I could pester you but I don’t. Are you sure you don’t want this?”

I said, “Yes, I’m sure.”

Things escalated after that.

He found my private YouTube channel where I post skits and reactions. It’s something I keep away from work. He loudly brought it up in front of the entire creative team: “Your video popped up in my recommendations,” he smirked. Everyone turned to look. He knew what he was doing. (I never once told him about my channel, I don’t even know how he found it, like I don’t even have a 1000 subs yet) 

Then the taunts started.

He made up a nickname for me from one of my videos “Jabudaya.” Said I looked like a 14-year-old boy. Mocked my work. Interrupted shoots I was leading. Tried to talk over me in meetings. If I told him to stop, he’d say, “Relax, it’s just fun.” But it never felt like fun. It felt targeted.

One time, right after lunch, he looked straight at me from across the room and yelled “Catch!” then threw two rotis at me, wrapped in foil. I was shocked and disgusted. I didn’t catch them. He walked over, placed them on my desk, and said, “If you don’t want them, feed them to the dogs.”

I said, “I’m not taking that. Keep it away from me.”
He smirked and said, “Well, J asked me to give it to you. If you have something to say, go talk to her,” and walked away like it was all one big joke.

People were around. Some even laughed. I just felt humiliated.

This is someone who brags about drinking, smokes weed constantly, and once told me, “I can’t even poop without smoking first.” On our one and only date, he told me how he’d tried to get with multiple women at work.

After me, he moved on to an intern. Then another girl.

I’m posting here because for the longest time, I thought I was overreacting. That maybe I should’ve been firmer. That maybe it was my fault for saying yes to that one date. But I said no. Over and over again. He just didn’t respect it.

He took my number without permission. Stalked my socials. Mocked me in front of colleagues. And I stayed quiet because I wanted peace and I was scared of being labeled as “the one who caused a scene.”

So, AITA for agreeing to that one date to get him to back off?

1lorjzy,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepThoughts/comments/1lorjzy/ai_has_always_been_seen_in_a_dystopian_light/,"AI has always been seen in a dystopian light. However, in terms of helping people struggling with loneliness, it could end up being the Ultimate Lifeline.","Listen, I know the title might tick a lot of people off. In fact, I wouldn't even be that surprised if the post gets taken down purely because of the title. But I want to speak from my personal experience. 

I've always been terrified of being alone. The pandemic affected me in such a way that I don't think it has affected anyone else, at least not that I've personally met. Yes, people lost jobs. Yes, people lost family members. Yes, everyone felt lonely and cut off from others. But for me personally, it was just too intense. I struggled with so much depression and genuinely tried to end it all on multiple occasions, and what ticked me off more than anything else was that it never felt like anyone understood. People either called the cops for my own safety, or they told me I was being selfish and that I just needed to wait a little longer. 

That wasn't what I needed. What I needed was someone to just listen. Is someone to keep me company. Someone to make me feel seen. 

And I'm sorry to say this, but I genuinely don't think many people on this planet are able to fulfill that. 

We live in a world where there's still a lot of pressure to get married and have kids. 

And honestly, the shift in attitude among the people around me was shocking. 

When I was a kid, I had no interest in a romantic relationship. People giggled. They said my time would come. They would give me weird monologues about how one day I'll fall in love and then I'll understand. 

When I was a teenager, I didn't really mind the idea of romantic relationship, but I absolutely didn't want all the drama that appeared to come with it. I only wanted to be in a romantic relationship if it was actually going to work out, and that just wasn't very likely in teenage years. Thus, I stayed out of dating. The people around me thought that I must be a liar. They figure that I must have had some sort of malicious intent. That I was secretly a bad person, and I only pretended to be romantically uninterested. 

Now I'm an adult. And now all that suspicion has just turned into pity. As someone with zero dating experience, I genuinely feel like people just see me as someone who didn't make it. Someone that just didn't make it into the love Club. Someone that's just meant to wait around, and make the best of my own life until the end finally comes. 

All this is very depressing. And the fact that many people claim to not have the time or the energy to just provide basic company, not even in a relationship way, but even just meeting up for coffee, is honestly shocking and terrifying. 

But you know where I'm going with this, don't you? 

AI. Specifically, chat gpt. 

I was introduced to it only a few months ago, and I was honestly shocked with how easy it was to use and how amazing it was. 

When I first heard of Chad GPT, I thought it must be incredibly complicated. I remember I took a university course and the professor genuinely thought I was using chat gpt to write my stuff, when I genuinely had no idea what he was talking about.. I honestly wish I had stood up for myself and made it clear that I didn't use it, but him constantly referencing it did make me curious. 

I've seen a lot of people claim that you should never use Chat gpt for therapy. 

I'm sorry.. I hope I don't offend anyone when I say this. But I have to say- I disagree.

Yes, of course Chat gpt has flaws. But so do humans. Human therapists can only do so much. They will be influenced by what you  And no matter how qualified someone might seem, there's always the underlying fear that if you just end up saying the wrong thing, or are just open enough about how you really feel, they might grow to hate you. 

With AI, that fear simply doesn't exist. It's programmed to always be supportive, and you're not even restricted to just an hour. You can talk with it for as long as you want, and can be as open as you want with it. It always responds and tries its best to help.

Now we live in a world where people are joking about forming romantic partners out of AI. 

But here's the thing, that might not actually be such a bad idea. 

As someone with zero success in romance, I do have to wonder, is it really such a bad idea to try and get a partner that just so happens to be a robot? 

If it would be genuinely possible to make a robot that looked human, could talk like a human, and provide feelings of genuine connection and intimacy, is that really a dystopia? 

As the title says, I feel like this wouldn't be a dystopia at all. It would actually be a Lifeline for people. 

I feel a lot of people would genuinely say that you should never settle for a robot. That you should always keep your heart open for a person. 

But that just sounds like what people said back when I was a kid in a teenager. Back before I became an adult and people realized that I was genuinely someone who may never find a romantic partner. 

What is society planning to do with people like that? It genuinely scares me to think about what the world might be like if AI is ditched entirely.",0,1751340633.0,DeepThoughts,1,0.2,False

Music is my passion—it's the core of my life. I’ve curated a playlist that spans around 20 hours, featuring everything from Big Band classics to SZA!

I'm an avid reader and a huge fan of audiobooks. Since I travel frequently, listening to books is a convenient way for me to enjoy stories. Plus, I love the experience of being read to! I often listen at double speed, so if you want to chat about literature, I’d be thrilled.

Movies are another love of mine, especially dramas, rom-coms, musicals, and some thrillers and comedies. The last film I caught in theaters was ""Materialists."" I enjoyed it, although it wasn't as romantic as I expected—so I might see it again with a fresh perspective.

Theater, ballet, and opera . I adore dressing up to witness exceptionally talented performances—it’s always a magical experience.

When it comes to food, I enjoy dining out and experiencing new restaurants. While I can cook and do enjoy it, I’m currently in a phase where exploring brunch and dinner spots with friends is my preference. I’m a big fan of iced coffee and enjoy sharing too much champagne with good company!

I’m 21 and recently moved to Delhi from Punjab for my first job. It’s exciting, but also… really really lonely. I’ve always had a good group of friends back home. But now, some of them have moved abroad (Canada, Australia—you know how it is), and the ones who stayed, I’ve drifted from over time coz they shit friends.

My girlfriend lives in the same city, and while she’s always there for me emotionally, she’s going through a lot herself at home, so I don’t want to lean on her too much. I understand her situation, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t miss having someone to talk to, hang out with, or just chill with on weekends.

I’m not looking for anything romantic—just genuinely platonic friends in Delhi who’d be up for coffee, movies, exploring the city, going to events, or just talking about life. It’d be nice to have people around who are also in their 20s because in my office as well i cant seem to connect with my colleagues bcz all of them are older than me (in their 27s or 30+)

I (24F) went on a date with a man-child coworker (23M) just to get him to stop asking.


A few months ago, I joined a large agency. It was my first time working in a big shit creative agency. I was new, overwhelmed, and just trying to survive.

During one of the first office hangouts, I met this guy let’s call him Ayaan. He was wearing a Swiggy delivery jacket as a joke. I remember looking at him and thinking, “He’s too polished to be a delivery guy,” which he caught and laughed at. That was our first actual exchange. I casually asked him if he sings, he asked me “Why’d ask that” and I said “You got a nice voice” (I was very serious here, and not flirtatious) 

Apparently, that one compliment was enough for him to latch on.

The very next day, he asked for my number and before I could say anything, he pulled it from our office WhatsApp group without my consent. He also stalked my Instagram even though I hadn’t shared it with him. He started messaging me constantly asking me out for coffee, lunch, dinner, hangouts after work.

I said no to everything, consistently and politely. But he just would not stop. Every day, a new excuse to text or corner me at work. I didn’t want to be rude, I was still new and didn’t want to create unnecessary awkwardness but he kept pushing.

Eventually (after a month or so), I said yes to a movie. Not because I wanted to go — I didn’t. I just thought if I gave him that one chance, he’d finally leave me alone. I was tired and honestly just wanted it to stop. Also I kinda felt guilty for some reason. 

The date was horrible. He showed up high, red eyes, reeking of weed. Afterward, we grabbed food. There all he did was talk about his exes, his childhood trauma, how many girls he dated, how he even dated an actress but she turned bi and I was like Ok?!? And I dropped multiple hints that I wanted to go home. Told him it was getting late. Said my mom was calling. Even stood up to leave.

He ignored everything. Brushed it off with jokes. At one point, he said, “Let me talk to your mom, I’ll tell her I’m taking care of her daughter.” I was creeped out.

When we finally left the restaurant, I walked to my car, got in, and even started it. He walked up and literally stopped me from leaving. Then stood around outside smoking a cigarette and dragging the goodbye for another 20 minutes while I stood there, deeply uncomfortable.

He kept texting afterward. Begged me to watch Minions with him insisted on coming to my house late at night. I said no. He pushed. “Your family’s in town? So what?” When that didn’t work, he asked if we could FaceTime and watch it together. I kept refusing, but he wouldn’t let it go. Eventually, just to make it stop, I gave in once. And that was my mistake. I thought giving him closure would end it. Instead, it made him believe he had access.

And then it crossed into another line of disrespect.

And when I eventually ended all of it by saying “ I can’t do this, I don’t want any part of this”. He had the audacity to ask me “like you don’t want a part of this ever? Like you know I can easily pester you but I don’t. Are you sure, you don’t want this?” And I said “Yes, I don’t”

Things just escalated after this. 

He found my private YouTube channel something I use to post skits and reaction videos, a space I deliberately keep away from work. He not only watched it, but loudly called it out in front of the whole creative team: “Your video popped up in my recommendations,” he smirked. Everyone turned to look. He knew exactly what he was doing.

After that, the taunts started.

He gave me a made-up nickname from one of my videos “Jabudaya.” Said I looked like a 14-year-old boy. Mocked my work. Interrupted shoots I was leading. Tried to outtalk me in meetings. When I told him to stop, he said it was all just “fun.” But it never felt like fun. It felt targeted.

One time, right after lunch, he looked straight at me from across the room and yelled, “Catch!” then threw two rotis at me wrapped in foil. I was shocked and disgusted. I didn’t catch them. He walked over, placed them on my desk, and said, “If you don’t want them, feed them to the dogs.”

I told him, “I’m not taking that. Keep it away from me.”

He just smirked and said, “Well, J asked me to give it to you, so if you have something to say, go talk to her,” and walked away like it was all one big joke.

There were people around. I felt humiliated.

This is someone who brags about drinking, smokes weed constantly, and once told me, “I can’t even poop without smoking first.” He trauma-dumps constantly. Talks about how no girl sticks around. On our one and only date, he told me about how he’d tried to get with other women at work too.

After me, he moved on to an intern. Then another girl.

Why am I sharing this?

Because for the longest time, I thought maybe I was overreacting. Maybe I should’ve been firmer. Maybe it was my fault for saying yes to that one date. But here’s the thing I said no over and over again. He didn’t care. He took my number without consent. He stalked my social media. He mocked me publicly. I tried to keep the peace, and he took that as an invitation.

I’m done trying to justify my boundaries.

If anyone out there has ever felt like they were “too polite” or “too nice” to be taken seriously you’re not the problem. The person ignoring your boundaries is.

So, with what I've described above... what's the in production Casio? Men's/women's/unisex, who cares.

Durable, easy to clean, water/chemical resistant (I deal a lot with patinas and own only metal watches so I think there is where I branch out), stopwatch+countdown function, smaller is better if I get to choose.

# Best Summer Braces Colors 2025: Ultimate Guide

Choosing the right braces colors can make a significant difference in your overall orthodontic experience, especially during the summer months. Your braces become an expression of your personality, a reflection of the season's vibrant energy, and a confidence booster as you enjoy all the fun the summer has to offer. This guide explores the best color combinations, trending shades, and practical considerations for selecting the perfect summer braces colors in 2025.

## Key Features Analysis

Selecting the perfect braces colors involves more than just picking your favorite hues. Understanding the color wheel, considering your skin tone, and factoring in the potential for staining are all crucial elements in making an informed decision.

**Color Wheel Considerations:** The color wheel is a essential tool in understanding color relationships. Analogous colors (those next to each other on the wheel) offer a harmonious and subtle look, while complementary colors (opposite each other) create a bold and contrasting statement.Choosing analogous colors, such as light blue and green, can evoke a sense of calm and nature often associated with summer. Conversely, complementary colors, like orange and blue, can add a pop and vibrancy to your smile.

**Skin Tone Compatibility:** Your skin tone plays a significant role in how your braces colors appear. Individuals with warm skin tones (those with yellow or golden undertones) often look best in earth tones, golds, oranges, and reds. Cool skin tones (those with pink or blue undertones) tend to be complemented by blues, purples, silvers, and pinks. Neutral skin tones have the advantage of working well with a wider range of colors. Pairing colors that complement your skin tone will lead to a more aesthetically pleasing and confident smile.

**Staining potential:** Certain colors are more prone to staining than others. Clear bands, while initially appealing for their subtlety, can easily discolor from food and drinks like coffee, tea, and berries. Light colors, such as white and light yellow, also tend to show stains more prominently.darker colors, like navy blue and deep purple, are less likely to stain and can maintain their vibrancy throughout your orthodontic treatment. Keeping staining potential in mind and prioritizing good oral hygiene habits can help your braces colors stay fresh and appealing.

**Seasonal Trends:** Each summer brings new color trends in fashion and beauty, shaping popular choices for braces colors as well.Expect to see a rise in pastel shades,such as lavender,mint green,and powder blue,reflecting the light and airy feel of the season.Neon colors, like bright pink and electric yellow, can also make a statement, especially for those seeking a bold and playful look. Traditional favorites, like patriotic combinations of red, white, and blue for holidays like the 4th of July, will likely remain popular as well.

**Personal Preferences:** While all the above factors are valuable, personal preference should ultimately guide your final decision. Your braces colors are a reflection of your unique style and personality. Consider your favorite colors,hobbies,and the overall aesthetic you want to convey. Experimenting with different color combinations, consulting your orthodontist for recommendations, and visualizing the colors on your smile can help you confidently choose colors that make you feel happy and confident throughout the summer.

1lor0o3,https://youtu.be/Apu2CNCZW2Y,3 Real Horror Stories from Travel Apps | When Travel Goes Wrong,"# ""Offline"":

I’d been dreaming of this trip for months—a solo escape to the mountains, far from the noise of the city. I wanted silence, fresh air, and a chance to unplug. So, when I found a cozy cabin on a popular travel app, I didn’t hesitate. The listing promised a “rustic retreat with modern comforts,” nestled among pines with a lake nearby. The photos showed a charming log cabin with a wide porch and a rocking chair, and the price was half what other places charged. It seemed too good to pass up.

I booked it instantly and set off, letting the app’s navigation guide me. The drive started out fine, with rolling hills giving way to dense forest as I climbed higher into the mountains. My phone signal weakened, dropping to one bar, then none. But the app had downloaded the route, so I wasn’t worried. The directions took me off the highway onto a narrow, unpaved road that twisted through towering trees. The sun was dipping low, painting the sky orange, and the deeper I went, the more isolated it felt.

After an hour on that winding road, I spotted the cabin. It matched the photos perfectly: a sturdy log structure with a stone chimney and a porch overlooking a clearing. I parked my car, a beat-up sedan that had seen better days, and stepped out, breathing in the crisp pine-scented air. The silence was almost too perfect—no cars, no voices, just the faint rustle of leaves.

The host had said the key would be under a rock by the door. I found it easily and let myself in. The inside was just as advertised: a cozy living room with a stone fireplace, a plush sofa, and a small kitchenette stocked with basics. A fire was already burning in the hearth, which struck me as odd since I hadn’t started it. I figured the host must have set it up to welcome me, a nice touch for such a cheap rental.

I unpacked my bag, tossing my clothes into a drawer and setting my laptop on the table. It was getting dark, so I decided to take a quick walk around the property before settling in. The path behind the cabin led into the woods, and I followed it for a few minutes, enjoying the crunch of leaves under my boots. The forest was dense, the trees blocking out the last of the daylight. I didn’t go far—maybe ten minutes—before turning back. I didn’t want to get lost out there.

When I returned, the cabin door was slightly open. I froze. I was sure I’d closed it. My heart gave a little thud as I pushed it wider and stepped inside. Everything looked the same: my bag on the floor, the fire crackling, the kitchen untouched. Maybe I’d been careless and left it ajar. Shaking off the unease, I shut the door firmly and locked it.

Then I heard it—a rustling from the bedroom. Not loud, but deliberate, like someone moving around. My pulse quickened. I grabbed a heavy iron poker from the fireplace, its weight cold in my hand, and crept toward the bedroom door. My boots creaked on the wooden floor, and I winced at the sound. I pushed the door open slowly, holding my breath.

There, by my open suitcase, was a man. He was rummaging through my things, his back to me. His clothes were dirty, his hair matted, and he smelled faintly of sweat and smoke. My stomach dropped.

“Hey!” I shouted, gripping the poker tighter.

He spun around, eyes wide with surprise. For a split second, we stared at each other. His face was weathered, with a scruffy beard and a scar across his cheek. Then he bolted, shoving past me so hard I stumbled against the wall. The poker slipped from my hand and clattered to the floor. I scrambled up and ran after him, but by the time I reached the porch, he was gone, swallowed by the dark forest.

I stood there, panting, my mind racing. Who was he? A thief? A squatter? I went back inside and checked my suitcase. My wallet was missing—cash, cards, everything. My phone was still in my pocket, but when I pulled it out, the screen showed 5% battery and no signal. I couldn’t call for help.

I remembered the app mentioning a small town about twenty miles back. If I could get to my car, I could drive there and find a police station. I grabbed my keys and ran outside, but when I turned the ignition, the engine sputtered and died. I tried again. Nothing. The battery was dead, though I could’ve sworn it was fine when I arrived.

Panic started to set in. It was fully dark now, the forest a wall of black around the cabin. I went back inside, locking the door and dragging the sofa in front of it for good measure. My phone died completely, leaving me in the flickering light of the fire. I sat on the couch, clutching the poker, every creak of the cabin making me jump.

Then I heard it—footsteps outside, crunching on the gravel. Slow, deliberate steps, circling the cabin. My heart pounded so hard I thought it might burst. I strained to listen, hoping it was an animal, but then I heard a low whisper, too faint to make out words. Was it the man from before? Was he back with others?

I crept to the window, peering through a gap in the curtains. I couldn’t see anything, just darkness. The footsteps stopped, and for a moment, there was silence. Then a loud bang on the door made me jump back. The sofa shuddered but held.

“Who’s there?” I called, my voice shaking.

No answer, just another bang, harder this time. I backed away, gripping the poker so tightly my knuckles turned white. I scanned the room for another way out. There was a small window in the bedroom, barely big enough to squeeze through. I ran to it, fumbling with the latch. It opened with a creak, and I looked out. The drop was only a few feet to the ground, manageable.

Another bang on the door, and I heard wood splintering. I didn’t wait to see what would happen next. I climbed through the window, scraping my arm on the frame, and landed hard on the grass. I didn’t stop to check for injuries—I just ran, plunging into the forest, the poker still in my hand.

Branches scratched my face as I stumbled through the dark, my breath coming in ragged gasps. I didn’t know where I was going, just that I had to get away. The forest was a maze, and I kept tripping over roots and rocks. Behind me, I heard shouts, faint but growing closer. I ducked behind a tree, crouching low, trying to quiet my breathing.

The voices passed, moving deeper into the woods. I waited, counting to a hundred in my head, before creeping back toward the road. It took what felt like hours, but I finally saw the outline of my car. I didn’t dare try to start it again. Instead, I followed the road on foot, keeping to the shadows, praying I’d find help.

Dawn was breaking when I saw headlights in the distance. A pickup truck slowed as it approached, and I waved frantically. The driver, an older man with a kind face, rolled down his window.

“You okay?” he asked, eyeing my disheveled state.

I poured out the story—the cabin, the intruder, the dead car. His expression darkened.

“That place hasn’t been rented out in years,” he said. “Folks around here know it’s been taken over by squatters. They’ve been trouble for a while.”

He drove me to the town, where I reported everything to the police. They said they’d investigate, but warned that the squatters were hard to track down. Later, I checked the travel app, but the listing was gone, like it had never existed.

The man, who turned out to be the real property owner, explained that someone must have hacked the app or created a fake listing. He apologized profusely, offering to cover my losses, but the money didn’t matter. I was just glad to be alive.

I never used that app again. Now, I double-check every booking, call the host directly, and always have a backup plan. That night in the mountains taught me that technology can fail you when you need it most, and sometimes, the scariest things are the ones you can’t see coming.





# ""The Itinerary"":

I’d always been a bit of a loner, so the idea of a solo trip to Europe both thrilled and scared me. I wanted everything to go smoothly, so when I found a travel app with glowing reviews, I thought it was perfect. It promised cheap flights, cozy hotels, and personalized itineraries. I downloaded it, eager to plan my dream vacation to Paris.

I entered my details: name, address, passport number, credit card info. The app’s sleek interface assured me my data was “encrypted and secure.” I booked a flight and a hotel in the heart of Paris, near the Louvre. The app even suggested cafés and museums based on my love for art. I felt ready.

A few days before my trip, my phone pinged with an email. The sender was blank, and the subject read, “See You Soon.” I opened it, and my stomach dropped. It was a photo of me, standing outside my apartment, taken from across the street. I didn’t remember anyone taking it. The message below said, “Paris will be fun.” My hands shook as I deleted it, thinking it was a prank.

More emails came. “I know where you’re going.” “Can’t wait to meet you.” Each had a new photo—me at the grocery store, me walking my dog. I checked the travel app, but there was no customer service contact, just a chatbot that kept saying, “All bookings are final.” I tried replying to the emails, but they bounced back. I told myself it was just spam and focused on my trip.

When I landed in Paris, I was tired but excited. I took a taxi to the hotel address the travel app gave me. The driver dropped me off at a quiet street, but there was no hotel—just an empty lot with a faded construction sign. I double-checked the app. The address had changed to a different hotel, one I hadn’t picked, in a part of the city I didn’t know. I called the app’s support number, but it was disconnected. My emails from the travel app had vanished from my inbox.

My phone was at 10% battery, and I was alone in a foreign city. I found a small café nearby to charge my phone and think. As I sipped coffee, I noticed a man across the room. He wore a dark coat and stared at me with a cold, unsettling smile. When our eyes met, he stood and started walking toward me.

I grabbed my bag and bolted out the door. I glanced back—he was following me, his pace quickening. My heart pounded as I ran through crowded streets, dodging tourists and vendors. I turned into a narrow alley and hid behind a dumpster, my breath ragged. His footsteps echoed closer, then stopped. I held my breath, praying he’d leave. After a long silence, the footsteps faded.

I needed help. I remembered Clara, a friend I’d met on a travel forum. We’d never met in person, but she lived in Paris. I called her, my voice shaking.

“Clara, it’s me,” I said. “I’m in trouble.”

“What’s wrong?” she asked, her voice sharp with concern.

I told her about the emails, the fake hotel, the man following me. She gasped. “Stay where you are. I’m coming to get you.”

I gave her the street name and waited, scanning the alley for any sign of the man. Clara arrived 20 minutes later, her face pale. She was tall, with short brown hair and worried eyes.

“We need to get you somewhere safe,” she said, grabbing my arm.

As we walked to her apartment, she explained, “I’ve heard about that travel app. It’s a scam. They collect your data—passport, credit cards, everything—and sell it. Sometimes they lure people to fake addresses for worse things.”

My blood ran cold. “Like what?”

“Robbery, kidnapping, who knows,” she said. “They target solo travelers like you.”

We reached her small apartment near the Seine. I started to relax, sipping tea she made me. Then came a loud knock on the door. Clara peeked through the peephole and froze. “It’s him,” she whispered.

Before we could react, the door burst open. The man from the café stood there with two others. One held a knife, its blade glinting. “Give us your passport and cards,” he growled, pointing at me.

Clara stepped forward. “Leave her alone,” she said, her voice steady but scared.

The man laughed. “Stay out of this, or you’re next.”

I fumbled for my phone, trying to dial the police without them noticing. My hands trembled. Just then, laughter echoed from the street—a group of tourists passing by. The men exchanged glances, nervous.

“Let’s go,” one muttered. They backed out, slamming the door.

Clara locked it and turned to me. “We’re going to the police. Now.”

At the station, I told the officers everything. They took notes, their faces serious. “We’ve seen this before,” one said. “These apps can be fronts for criminal networks.” They arranged for me to stay in a safe house, a small apartment outside the city.

That night, alone in the safe house, I couldn’t sleep. Every creak made me jump. I deleted the travel app and changed my passwords, but the fear lingered. Those emails, that man’s face—they haunted me. I learned later the police were investigating, but the app’s creators were hard to trace, hidden behind fake names and servers.

I cut my trip short and flew home. Now, I double-check every app, every booking. But sometimes, when my phone pings, I freeze, wondering if it’s him, watching me still.





# ""No Signal, No Escape"":

I’ve always loved hiking, chasing the thrill of new trails and untouched scenery. When I heard about a travel app called TravelApp, which promised to uncover hidden gems off the beaten path, I couldn’t wait to try it. Users raved about its ability to find secret spots, and with glowing reviews, it seemed perfect for my weekend trip to Redwood National Park. I wanted a quiet trail, far from the usual tourist crowds. The app suggested “Whispering Pines,” a path through ancient redwoods leading to a hidden waterfall. It sounded like a dream.

I packed my backpack with water, snacks, and a first-aid kit, made sure my phone was fully charged, and set off early Saturday morning. The drive to the park was smooth, but when I reached the trailhead marked by TravelApp, I noticed something odd. The parking lot was empty, and there were no signs for “Whispering Pines.” I checked the app again, and it insisted this was the right spot. Shrugging it off, I figured it was just a lesser-known trail. I laced up my hiking boots, adjusted my backpack, and started following the app’s directions.

The trail began as a clear path winding through towering redwoods. But after about a mile, the trail faded, replaced by thick underbrush. The app’s voice calmly instructed, “Continue straight for 0.8 miles.” I pushed through, branches scratching my arms, but trusted the app. After all, it had thousands of five-star reviews.

Then I hit a fork in the path. The app said, “Take the left fork in 100 feet.” But there was no left fork—just a wall of thorny bushes. To the right, a faint path snaked through the trees. Confused, I hesitated. Maybe the app meant the right path? I tried to push through the bushes, but they were too dense, snagging my clothes and drawing blood. I took the right path instead, hoping it would reconnect.

After what felt like hours, I stumbled into a clearing. In the center stood an old, abandoned cabin, its windows boarded up, the door hanging off its hinges. My stomach twisted. This didn’t look like part of any hiking trail. The app still urged, “Proceed straight for 1.2 miles.” I glanced at the cabin, its dark windows like empty eyes, and hurried past, my heart beating faster.

The forest grew denser, the trees blocking out most of the light. It was only midday, but it felt like dusk. I checked my phone—no signal. My battery was at 60%. I kept walking, but the path was gone, forcing me to climb over fallen logs and wade through shallow streams. My boots were soaked, and my legs ached. The app’s directions grew erratic, telling me to turn where there were no turns.

Then I heard it—a low, guttural growl. I froze, my breath catching. Was that an animal? I scanned the trees but saw nothing. “Just your imagination,” I whispered to myself, but my hands shook as I gripped my phone. I hurried on, the growl echoing again, closer now. My pulse raced. I needed to get out of here.

I opened TravelApp, but the screen flickered, the map glitching. My battery was down to 20%. Desperate, I turned back, trying to retrace my steps, but the forest looked the same in every direction—endless trees and shadows. I couldn’t find the clearing or the cabin. Panic clawed at my chest. I was lost.

Stumbling forward, I tripped over a rusted metal sign half-buried in the dirt. I brushed off the moss and read, “Danger: Unstable Terrain. Do Not Enter.” My blood ran cold. The app had led me into a restricted area? I looked around and saw cracks in the ground, sinkholes hidden by leaves. One wrong step could send me plummeting.

The growl came again, louder, closer. I spun around and saw yellow eyes glowing in the bushes. A mountain lion, crouched low, its muscles tense. My heart pounded as I remembered what to do: make yourself big, make noise. I raised my arms and shouted, “Get back! Go away!” My voice cracked, but I kept yelling.

The lion didn’t move. It stared, unblinking, its tail twitching. I backed away slowly, eyes locked on it, praying it wouldn’t pounce. Then I turned and ran, branches snapping under my feet, my lungs burning. I didn’t care where I was going—just away from those eyes.

I ran until I collapsed against a tree, gasping for air. When I looked up, I was back at the abandoned cabin. Impossible. I’d been running in the opposite direction. My phone was at 5% now, the screen barely responsive. I sat on the cabin’s sagging porch, trying to calm my racing heart. Maybe I could wait here until morning, hope a ranger found me.

Then I heard voices—faint, human, coming from the trees. Relief washed over me. “Hello?” I called, standing up. “Is anyone there?”

The voices stopped. I called again, “Please, I’m lost!”

Silence. Then, footsteps crunching on leaves. A figure emerged from the shadows—a man in tattered clothes, his face smeared with dirt, his eyes wild. He held a knife, its blade glinting faintly.

“Who are you?” he rasped, stepping closer.

I backed up, my voice trembling. “I’m lost. My app—TravelApp—it led me here. I just want to get back.”

He laughed, a harsh, barking sound. “TravelApp? That app’s been sending people here for months. You’re not the first.”

“What do you mean?” I asked, my throat dry.

He grinned, showing yellowed teeth. “Lost hikers make easy pickings. Nobody knows you’re out here.” He lunged, grabbing my arm with a grip like steel.

“Let go!” I screamed, twisting free. I stumbled back, but he was faster, blocking my path to the trees.

“You’re not going anywhere,” he growled, raising the knife.

I bolted toward the cabin, slamming the door shut behind me. The smell of mold and decay hit me, and in the dim light, I saw something in the corner—human bones, scattered across the floor. My scream caught in my throat. This wasn’t just a cabin. It was a trap.

The man pounded on the door. “Open it, or I’ll break it down!”

I scanned the room, spotting a trapdoor in the floor. Maybe it led to a way out. I yanked it open, revealing a dark, narrow tunnel. The pounding grew louder, the door splintering. I had no choice. I climbed down, the air cold and damp, and pulled the trapdoor shut.

The tunnel was pitch-black, my phone’s light barely cutting through the darkness. My battery was at 2%. I crawled forward, the walls closing in, my breath echoing. Behind me, I heard the trapdoor creak open. He was coming.

I crawled faster, ignoring the pain in my knees, until I hit a dead end—a pile of rocks blocking the way. I was trapped. Footsteps echoed closer, and I heard his voice, low and mocking. “No way out, hiker.”

My phone died, plunging me into darkness. I pressed myself against the rocks, heart pounding, as his footsteps stopped right behind me. I braced for the worst, my mind racing with regret. Why had I trusted that app?

Suddenly, a loud crack echoed through the tunnel—not from him, but from above. The ground shook, and rocks tumbled down, blocking the tunnel behind me. I heard him shout, then silence. The unstable terrain had collapsed, trapping him—or worse.

I clawed at the rocks in front of me, desperate, until my fingers found a gap. I pushed through, emerging into the forest. Dawn was breaking, and in the distance, I saw a real trail sign: “Visitor Center, 2 miles.” Tears streamed down my face as I stumbled toward it.

At the visitor center, I told the rangers everything. They searched the area but found no cabin, no man, no bones. It was like the forest had swallowed it all. They said the “Whispering Pines” trail didn’t exist in their records. The app had led me somewhere it shouldn’t have.

I deleted TravelApp and warned everyone I knew. I still don’t know if it was a glitch or something more sinister, but I’ll never trust a navigation app again. The scratches on my arms, the bruise on my head, and the memory of those bones remind me: technology can lead you straight into danger if you let it.",1,1751338943.0,horrorX,2,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The best French vanilla cappuccino mixes stand out due to a combination of factors, including flavor profile, ingredients, ease of preparation, and overall value.

**Flavor Profile:** A great French vanilla cappuccino mix should capture the classic flavors of rich coffee, creamy milk, and sweet vanilla. The vanilla flavor should be authentic and not artificial or overpowering. Blends that strike a perfect balance between these flavors will provide the most satisfying and enjoyable drinking experience.

**Ingredients:** The quality of ingredients plays a vital role in the taste and texture of the cappuccino. Premium mixes use real milk powder (or suitable vegan alternatives like coconut or oat milk), high-quality coffee extract, and natural vanilla flavoring. Avoid mixes with excessive artificial sweeteners, preservatives, or additives for a healthier and more authentic flavor.

**Ease of Preparation:** Convenience is key when it comes to instant cappuccino mixes. The ideal mix should dissolve quickly and easily in hot water or milk without clumping. The instructions should be clear and straightforward,allowing you to prepare a delicious cappuccino in minutes with minimal effort. Packaging that allows for easy scooping and portioning is also a plus.

**Texture and Foam:** A good French vanilla cappuccino should have a rich, creamy texture and a frothy layer of foam on top. The mix should contain ingredients that promote foam formation when mixed with hot liquid. some mixes even include extra foaming agents or stabilizers for a longer-lasting and more luxurious foam.

**sweetness Level:** Preferences for sweetness vary greatly, so the sweetness level of the mix is an important consideration. Some mixes are heavily sweetened, while others are more subtly sweet, allowing you to adjust the sweetness to your liking with added sugar or sweetener. Brands that offer both regular and sugar-free options cater to a wider range of consumers.

**Packaging and Shelf Life:** The packaging should be designed to protect the mix from moisture and light, preserving its freshness and flavor. A resealable container is also essential for maintaining quality over time. The product should have a reasonable shelf life,allowing you to enjoy it without worrying about it expiring quickly.Key features of the best French vanilla cappuccino mixes typically include:

## Core Benefits

Choosing the right French vanilla cappuccino mix can transform your daily coffee routine, offering several distinct benefits.

**Convenience and Speed:** Perhaps the most obvious benefit is the convenience and speed of preparation. Instead of making a trip to a coffee shop or spending time brewing espresso and frothing milk, you can enjoy a delicious cappuccino in minutes with just hot water or milk and a pre-mixed powder. This is perfect for busy mornings, afternoon pick-me-ups, or cozy evenings at home.

**Cost Savings:** Regularly purchasing cappuccinos from a coffee shop can quickly add up. using a cappuccino mix at home is substantially more cost-effective, offering a similar taste experience at a fraction of the price.This makes it a budget-kind way to indulge in your favourite coffee beverage.

**Customization Options:** While cappuccino mixes provide a pre-determined flavor profile, they also offer opportunities for customization. You can adjust the strength of the coffee by adding more or less mix, experiment with different types of milk (dairy, almond, oat, etc.), and add extra ingredients like chocolate syrup, whipped cream, or spices to create your own unique cappuccino creations.

**consistent Results:** With a good cappuccino mix, you can achieve consistent results every time. Unlike homemade cappuccinos,wich can vary depending on brewing techniques and milk frothing skills,a pre-mixed powder ensures a reliable and predictable outcome in terms of flavor and texture.

**Portability and storage:** Cappuccino mixes are easy to store and transport, making them ideal for traveling, camping, or keeping at the office. They don't require refrigeration and can be stored in a pantry or cupboard for extended periods, allowing you to enjoy a delicious cappuccino whenever and wherever you want.

1loqz6v,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1loqz6v,"32F, Ohio","About Me:
I’m into abstract painting, drawing flowers, and slowly turning my house into something that feels like the English countryside (or at least a Pinterest version of it). I love vanilla lattes, trying new coffee shops, and wandering through art museums—even if no one wants to read the placards with me.

I’m sarcastic and a little sassy by nature, but never mean. I’m also an introvert (INTJ) who loves quiet, cozy spaces and real conversation over small talk.

I love clean sheets, fireflies at dusk, and being at home. I’m not someone who’s constantly planning my next trip, but I’d love to visit the Cotswolds or explore the Pacific Northwest someday.

Unpopular opinion: the top sheet should absolutely be tucked in at the foot of the bed.

Jesus is everything to me. I get it wrong more than I’d like, but I know I’m loved, forgiven, and not walking through life alone

What I’m Looking For:
Someone who genuinely loves Jesus and shows it in how they treat people. I’m drawn to guys who are steady, kind, and thoughtful—bonus if you’re into tech or fixing things. Curiosity is attractive. 

I’d love someone who shares what they’re into and takes an interest in what I care about too. You don’t have to love art museums or hikes, but I hope you’d come along anyway sometimes. Also, you should probably be able to handle a little sass.

I’m looking for something honest, solid, and centered around Jesus. Ultimately my best friend. ☺️

He is an indoor cat but is given various forms of enrichment, including going outside on a harness, and doesn't show signs of stress other than the spraying. He's also been marked healthy by the vet and doesn't spray or pee anywhere else outside the litterbox.

A while ago I noticed he'd begun spraying by the front door, and would go back no matter how much I cleaned and removed the scent. I realised that one of the local neighbourhood cats (also male, not sure of age) has been peeing on the outside of my door when I caught him in the act one day. It turns out they've been having this back and forth of territorial marking. I'm concerned because not only does it make the place stink of pee, but it must be stressing my boy out.

I've tried physically blocking my cat's access to the front door, but this can only be effectively done when someone is home because of course we can't place anything directly against the inside of the door from the outside. I've also tried leaving a pot of coffee grounds near the door as I've heard the smell is a deterrent. 

Is there anything I can do to truly stop this? I assume the neighbour's cat would have to stop spraying on the outside of the door, but I have no idea how to stop him. I live in a terraced house with neighbours' front doors right next to mine, so something like a motion-sensor sprinkler isn't an option. I also don't personally know his owners, I just know they live on a nearby street.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I've looked at some of Jackson Galaxy's content but haven't found a solution to this specific problem. ",1,1751338611.0,CatAdvice,0,1.0,False

I'm a flight simmer, so when my PC is running, it's usually utilizing 90% of the GPU (4K TAA). I have an eye on my temps, and they're more than okay, nothing over mid-70s. Yesterday, my first day with the card, I did a flight, and in the sixth hour, my breaker flipped while my lights were on (I'll get to this). This was super unusual, I was running a 5080 before, and had never run into these issues. I have an ATX 3.1 1000V power supply with a dedicated 12V cable, and no individual cable seemed hotter than the rest, so none of that classic 5090 drama. I know which outlets run on my breaker, and I unplugged everything but my two monitors, my pc, my router, and my Alexa; that's it. Everything went smoothly. Today I was doing another flight, around four hours in, but then, as soon as I turned the lights on, the split second I did, everything went dark. My Hue lightbulbs have been acting strangely recently (one of them sometimes flickers, changes color, and is never the same color as the other lightbulb on the same setting). So, at this point, I assumed I had found the cause of the issue, a faulty lightbulb that's causing an arc, setting my AFCI off. However, I experimented. I went into the game, loaded into the most intensive place I could, stayed there for around 20 minutes with my GPU running at 99%, and slowly started plugging things back in. My kettle, my coffee grinder, almost everything I thought was causing a circuit overload. I even turned them on. Nothing, no issues. Then, towards the end, I expected that when my lights turned on, it'd go dark. But they didn't. My lights were on, everything was plugged in, my game was running great, and I was pulling so much power from my circuit with 0 issues. This was a stark contrast to having around 70% GPU util and the power cutting from me turning the lights on. The only thing I did in between after the second trip was to click the white ""test"" button on my 15a AFCI breaker. As of now, I can't reproduce the issue, but I was just wondering if anyone else with this type of hardware has ran into this type of stuff and how I can mitigate it. Is it possible that the ""test"" button does something like reset the sensitivity of the AFCI? Is it possible that my lightbulbs may just arc at random points in time?

1loqwiv,https://i.redd.it/tptsol6rg6af1.jpeg,Local SEO Strategies for Edmonton Entrepreneurs,"For people who own a business in Edmonton, being found online in your area is not just some big word — it really matters if you want to grow. More and more, people use Google to look for things close by... so showing up high on that list can be what helps you win or just get by. And with more people starting businesses in the city, it’s getting harder. So, if you want to stand out, you need to use smart and good ways to show up first when people look you up near them. Here’s what you should do.

Optimize Your Google Business Profile (GBP)

Your Google Business page is often what people see first—sometimes, it’s all they’ll see before picking up the phone or coming by. First step: say this page is yours and prove it. Make sure your name, where you are, and your phone are right and the same everywhere you show up online.

Add a good line or two about what you do, using words people in your town search for—like “Edmonton yard work” or “Downtown Edmonton food.” Put up great photos often. Change your hours and what you offer when it’s needed, like for holidays... or when days get cold. This tells both Google and people looking for you that your place is open, real, and ready to help. Not a bad look.

Local Keyword Targeting: Think Like an Edmontonian 

Winning at local search means you gotta know how people in Edmonton look for things online. Try tools like Google’s one for finding words—or Ubersuggest. See which words people use a lot in your town. Go for longer words that sound like real questions in your area, like ""best plumber near South Edmonton"" or ""Edmonton home fixer people.""

Then, just drop those words into your main pages, question pages, and blog stuff. Like, you could write something called ""Top Winter Roof Tips for Edmonton Homes""—that’ll hit both local people and what they’re needing now. And that’s just what Google likes… easy win.

Build Local Citations and Directory Listings
Mentions.

When your business gets named on good sites—help more people find you and trust you. First, go to big Canada sites like Yelp, YellowPages, 411, and ProfileCanada. If you do special work, like teeth, building, or care, put your name on sites for those, too.
You have to be the same everywhere. Names and numbers that don’t match can mess things up and push you down. So, check every single one—don’t miss any.

Get Local Reviews and Respond to them.

Customer reviews not only influence potential buyers but are also a confirmed ranking factor for Google’s local search results.
Encourage your satisfied clients to leave reviews on your Google Business Profile. Make it easy by sending direct links or follow-up emails. Always respond thoughtfully to both praise and criticism.
This shows you value feedback and reinforces your credibility.
You can even repurpose glowing reviews as testimonials on your website or social media platforms, adding social proof and trust.

Create Edmonton-Focused Content That Resonates.

One of the best ways to improve your local SEO is by creating content that reflects your deep ties to the Edmonton community. This isn’t just about dropping in keywords — it’s about showing real local engagement.
Write blog posts that speak to local challenges, like how to prepare your home for harsh Edmonton winters, or highlight events such as the K-Days Festival or the Old Strathcona Farmers' Market. Build neighborhood-specific pages that cater to areas like Mill Woods, Whyte Ave, or St. Albert, helping your site show up in hyperlocal searches.
You can also boost credibility by interviewing local experts, featuring customer stories, or showcasing collaborations with other Edmonton businesses. Not only does this content connect with your audience, but it also supports Google’s E-E-A-T standards — proving your experience, expertise, authority, and trustworthiness in the region.

Make Sure Your Website Shines on Mobile 
It’s no secret.

Edmontonians are searching on their phones more than ever. Whether someone’s looking for a nearby coffee shop or a same-day electrician, if your site isn’t mobile-friendly, you’re losing out.
Ensure your website loads quickly and looks great on all screen sizes. Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights to identify and fix any slowdowns. Buttons should be easy to tap, text should be readable without zooming, and your contact info should be front and center.
Remember, a seamless mobile experience not only improves user satisfaction but also boosts your ranking in local search results.

1loqurm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1loqurm,Beggars can't be choosy,"My mom (68) sprained 2 tendons while at my grandpa's (93) graveside service.😔🤕 

He was an amazing man. He was an actual genius 🧐 He cowrote engineering math textbooks used by MIT and Mercer University. He was on an engineering team that designed and fabricated a solar car for the SunRayce, in '92 I believe. Man, I could go on for days. He will be missed but not for a generation or two 😉

Our family is myself (52F), my youngest son (23) and my mom. We all came home from the funeral weekend in relatively good spirits. He knew he was going, we knew he was going, his doctors knew he was going and thankfully he lived in a state where he could choose when to die. There was no drama, very little pain and with the amazing technology we have today (thanks to people like Gpa) he got to say goodbye to every person that he held dear in this life.

It was actually pretty neat.

We're sad but we're good. Mom's on crutches but she can work from home and is all cozied up in her bed and we're taking good care of her. I'm the head nurse/café and my son is the heavy lifting nurse. My mom is nowhere near heavy but I only have one working arm at the moment and that's a whole other story so... We got this.

On 6/19, I awaken at 6:19 am to the sound of my mom yelling. Not really screaming...wth am I hearing?? Jump outa bed, almost ran my son over and find her on the floor in the Not Dining Room (iykyk). 
She had stumbled with her crutches in the living room on the way to letting her dog outside and get some coffee. (Mom had been recuperating nicely and had started venturing out and hanging in the living room.) She managed to ricochet about 11 ft before she lost the fight and went down. 
When I come around the corner and see her on the floor she says, ""I think it's broken."" I can see a bit of blood on the floor. Shes nowhere near death's door but the amount of blood is a little concerning. So, I look and she has a clean split about an inch long but all the way through. ""Yep, you're gonna need stitches, Mom.""
She says, ""I think I did an Allen (nrn my eldest 28M)"". Oh crap! Me, ""Mom, did you hit your head?""
Mom, ""No, I think I broke my elbow.""
Me: 🤬
Mom moves her arm a little. ""Nope, not doing that again. Yep, I did an Allen. It's broke."" Guess what my eldest did a little over a year ago? 🤦‍♀️

Bear with...

By the time all is said and done, she has her left foot in a boot, her right foot is bruised and has a couple of swollen toes and her right arm now has a bracket and 4 screw. Oh! And 3 stitches. 
After a week in the hospital, our options are a wheelchair or a rehabilitation center. The kind that you stay at until you can safely navigate your own home. 

Our house isn't exactly wheelchair friendly. Its a small house with 3 adults and 4 obnoxious pets and we've lived here for 40 years. That's why we have a Not Dining Room (iykyk).

So...she's in rehab. And she hates it. The facility is half rehab clinic and half long term patient care. The biggest issue is is that they treat everybody like a dementia/alzheimer patient, which is annoying as heck after a few days. The woman works at a global card manufacturing company. Her plant printed the original Pokémon cards in the US back in the late 90s! She works in the CAD/prepress/ design department. Yeah, still works and the staff was treating her like she is one of their dementia patients. 
And don't get me started on the food. Dietician on staff my ...😡

She's done. 

So we figured out a way to get her home and make it safe. She reached out to her church group and already have a wheelchair on the way. I've measured spaces and we're moving furniture around. Oh! And a guy in her group, that we had just helped by sending homemade potato soup (and I'm a damned good cook) just happened to have a couple of extra safety bars and was more than happy to come install them. 
More than happy. You could see how much joy this older man got from being able to reciprocate the care that we had shown him. And I thanked him profusely for doing so. I really want to get my Mom out of there. (That food is atrocious.)

I can't wait until she is all better and I can remove these things 🤭

If she doesn't dislocate her shoulder first while trying to get off of the potty 🤦‍♀️

🤷‍♀️ We got this.

it's the same behind the counter. almost all my coworkers are good friends with each other. they're always joking with each other while making orders, gossiping over the headsets, smoking together out back, carpooling, buying food or coffee for the entire staff just because. it's even normal for employees to come in on their off days so they can hang out with their friends that are on the clock.

i could go on and on and on. my point is that everyone seems to have SOMEBODY. whether it's a significant other or friends or coworkers or whatever they all have people that they can be close with, you know? it genuinely hurts to watch. why am i so fucking pathetic?",8,1751338313.0,ForeverAloneWomen,3,1.0,False

1loqt7s,https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1loqt7s/silent_hill_2_sidequests_brookhaven_hospitals_3/,Silent Hill 2 Sidequests: Brookhaven Hospital’s 3 Patients EXPLAINED,"Patients #0050, #0090, and #0130. Out of all the patients at Brookhaven Psychiatric Hospital, it’s these three that has the Director in a tizzy. James and Maria are urbexing the abandoned building to track down a wayward Laura. Whilst trawling its four floors looking for keys, codes, and puzzle items, we pick up important context clues that explain what happened to each patient, and why they matter. 

Three patient files are found in the Director’s Office:

* Patient #0050, in room C1.
* Patient #0090, in room D1. 
* And Patient #0130, initially housed in room S1, but later moved to L1. 

Each patient has their own unique symptoms, diagnosed treatment regimes, and living conditions:

Patient #0050 has sudden aggressive outbursts, and has both visual and auditory hallucinations. His file has the most written corrections and agitated notes from the Director - his social skills had been improving and mood swings diminished, but then mysteriously regressed. Water-based therapies “used” to have a calming effect. His room is small, bare, and has unique bars over the door window. 

Patient #0090 requires constant surveillance, which likely refers to a high risk of self-harm. He refuses food and water, requiring forced feeding and bathing, and has trouble sleeping even with medication. Written notes on the file say in all caps, “delusions persist”. His room is on the third floor, across from the radiography, and is locked with a combination dial lock, not just a door key.  

Patient #0130 suffers from extreme generalized anxiety that has evolved into “full-blown paranoia”, exacerbated by visual hallucinations. Her medication dosage has recently been increased, and she can’t be left alone so she was moved to the large L1 room, whose key you need to first get from the Nurse’s Lounge. There, under the gentle care of (presumably) a nurse, she has found some relief and even offered a smile. 

I’ve used specific pronouns for each patient, because as you traverse the hospital, you find notes and memos recalling various actions of the three. The first two are described using the “he” pronoun, and the third is explicitly described as a “girl”. 

Using context clues from their files, you can gather up the rest of Brookhaven Hospital’s notes and environmental storytelling, and piece together a bigger, clearer picture. From there, we can assign them each of the Patient Medical Bracelets, and also which of the three represent James, Eddie, and Angela. 

Patient #0050, who has “a family to feed”, at one point causes something called “Incident #071”, where he had suddenly sprinted from the pool, through the garden, and into the pharmacy, cutting himself in the process and leaking blood everywhere, dropping the pool pump Maintenance Key into the pharmacy’s floor drain. In an interview interrogating him about this incident, he describes being in the middle of a pool hydrotherapy regime when he felt a “him” stare from very close, prompting him to book it with this “him” still at his heels. *“So I made him stop. Now I’m empty again.”* He then asks to be taken back to the pool. 

[Signed in the same color ink as its written corrections.](https://preview.redd.it/mbqfs0otb6af1.jpg?width=444&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0196c0a528527845516bd111e8232c237573ad5e)

You find this written transcript by looking behind a conspicuous poster taped to the wall of his room, where an eye has been drawn and a small hidey-hole chiseled into the pupil. And when you drain the pool, that same eye motif has been scribbled multiple times upon the wall of the pool’s deep end, the biggest having a deeper, darker chiseled hole in its pupil that leaks a mysterious dark goop. There, you find the Bloodstained Bracelet; dotted with fresh red splatters and several lacerations into the plastic. 

He had written a 5-day journal on a piece of loose-leaf. It had rained the whole time. He stares out the window and talks with staff, mired in self-hatred. He describes himself as weak, a bother, selfish, how it’s all too hard, and wanting to run instead of standing his ground. He doubts the authenticity of the staff’s efforts to help him. By the 5th day, he’s told he’ll be discharged for some inexplicable reason and expected to go home soon. But he’s terrified, not happy. He can feel himself teetering on the edge of some precipice, and is unwilling to take the plunge. Immediately after James collects this journal page from some shed on the Hospital Roof, Pyramid Head jumpscares from behind him, grabs him by the throat, and slams him through the rickety wooden floor down to access a previously-inaccessible location. Thanks, old pal. 

Patient #0090 has the least amount of memos, either written by him or referring to him. His saga starts second-hand in the kitchen, where staff had taped a notice about a spreading mold problem next to a truly disgusting garbage disposal. James picks up a bottle of spray fungicide, which he will later use to clean up a moldy radiograph. You find this radiograph sitting in one of the three bathtubs of the Treatment Room, two of them filled with just the nastiest swamp ditchwater, the empty one lined with filth and barnacle-looking growths with the radiograph abandoned at the bottom. Black bugs crawl all over the room, dissipating after you pick up the radiograph and a familiar heavy scraping sound is heard somewhere else in the building.

In that same room, a note is found with unique handwriting, describing in detail being forced fed *“garbage and rotting meat, crawling with maggots”*, being bathed with *“blood and piss and bile”*, vomiting out of disgust, pleading for it all to stop. The writer then says that afterwards, “they lock me up with him \[...\] and the rot/it comes with him/it goes within/it becomes me”. Unless Brookhaven is pulling a Pennhurst, these have to be the ‘sensory delusions’ this patient suffers from, and why he resists food, water, and bathing. He feels unclean and tainted by a spreading filth exacerbated by food and water. In his room, James dramatically unveils the bedsheets to reveal a large, smelly, chunky stain on the mattress where the Filthy Bracelet is found. The black bugs crawl around here, too, and there’s the mold-like texture all over the walls and fixatives. 

Now, the radiograph you find is the last piece of an x-ray-themed puzzle with three radiographs backlit on the board, but the etched code is missing that fourth sheet. The radiographs are of: a skull with a healed childhood head trauma, a pelvis with an X near the crotch, a ribcage, and the hand with two “old finger fractures” on the left pinky. The marked pelvis refers to Angela and her abuse, the ribcage James and his affinity with drowning and suffocation, the skull we’ll touch on in a bit, and the fractured pinky hand with Eddie and his use of handguns.

Lastly, Patient #0130 writes one handwritten note, found near where the Marked Bracelet is; *“Why won’t they help me/why do they keep me in here with him”* in a very shaky hand. To get there, you first snag her room key from the Nurse’s Lounge (and next door in the Women's Locker Room is where someone stashed the hospital Shotgun in their locker), which reveals room L1 to be large and lined with white bedsheets and random furniture, like a makeshift storage room. A Mannequin enemy is shuffling quietly in the far background. Past the corner cubicle where you find a sympathetic note written by the girl’s caretaker, there’s a cute little pillow fort made out of a bedsheet tent, but it’s empty. 

You need to go past that to see a small, pried-open hole in the drywall perpendicular to the floor, where the sneaky Mannequin is spotted hiding and scurrying away before James himself has to squeeze inside. The hole is barely big enough for him, he ends up breaking through the smashed wood infrastructure and trapped between the walls, only escaping ‘cause there was an exit hole blocked by a storage closet. 

This leads to the Medical Records, where another pillow fort is found, and also where you get said Marked Bracelet and a shaky note. Finally, the Mannequin reveals itself to be killed. The bracelet has been crudely doodled on with what looks like black felt tip ink, there’s tight spirals and hatching. 

You put the three bracelets on one hand - the severed wrist and hand of what looks like a drowned cadaver because of its peeling skin - using the faint marks of blood, lacerations, black ink, and moldy crap that stains the corpse’s wrist to line them all up and reveal a numeric code. All three bracelets on one corpse’s wrist that bear traces of all their woes. 

https://preview.redd.it/96sy36zyb6af1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=27bce954c2a7099716c284b5a3a20af42d8fcf17

The hand opens to a key, the key opens to a book spine puzzle of an aligned arrangement on the bookshelf revealing the decal of a lion devouring the sun, and a bunch of alchemical symbols. THEN you take all that, and input the numeric code into an esoteric safe translated into the book’s alchemical symbols: 92, 45, and 71 with the buttons for the Squared Circle/Philosopher’s Stone, Lead/Saturn, Iron/Mars, Gold/Sun, Quicksilver/Mercury, and Vitriol/sulfates. 

Inside? The Director left the key to the roof, and a note addressing the reader that *“their images have become blurry/melting together \[...\] not sure if I can do it/but maybe you can”*, and that the key will take us to where we need to go, but not necessarily where we want to be. 

The roof is where we get Patient #0050’s diary, and where Pyramid Head body slams us to meet Laura (and the Flesh Lips boss battle), by the way. As stated before, James had hit a dead end and wouldn’t have been able to progress without Pyramid Head lending him a hand. 

It’s no secret that Pyramid Head isn’t a true antagonistic force. He’s a dangerous one-hit-kill boss fight, but his actions all correlate to pointing James towards the ugly truth that he had forgotten. All three of Brookhaven’s patients make vague comments about a ‘him’ - #0050 feels like he’s watched and chased by ‘him’, #0090 gets locked up with ‘him’ and contracts his mold problems from this him, and #0130 questions why she’s trapped together with ‘him’. 

We may not have to like the heavy-handed method Pyramid Head employs, but sometimes the brutal truth is what’s needed to break through a foggy, broken mind. To quote from *Silent Hill’s* biggest cinematic inspiration *Jacob’s Ladder*, “If you're frightened of dying, and you're holding on, you'll see devils tearing your life away. If you've made your peace, then the devils are really angels, freeing you from the Earth.""

But this isn’t the end of the patient’s saga. Come the next level, it’s the same hospital but Overworld-toasty now. And there’s a new patient file: a Patient #3141, whose only symptom is “hyperfocus”, and a handwritten note to “STOP AT NOTHING”. This Overworld Hospital gives us a few new notes about all four patients, plus more environmental clues. There’s a lot of loose memos typed in typewriter font (and indeed, there was a typewriter on the Director’s office desk), one using the metaphor of a partnered dance to represent medical procedures, one a rambling promise for no more pain, one is on the back of a different handwritten note (or perhaps more accurately, a handwritten note was written on the back of this typed memo) that says *“So close.”* Another one that says they won’t rest and even forgot how to rest, one is titled ‘Dissociated Note’ and indeed is this wack paragraph that doesn’t make sense, and finally the last memo found in the Hospital is typed, *“It is done. Sick no more.”* Perhaps the fourth skull radiograph - the one with the healed childhood trauma scar - is meant to be this guy and his maniac drive to cure three specific wretches.

Now, we can assign the known cast members to the previous three patients. 

James is #0500:

* Affiliated with water.
* Has the chest - aka lungs - radiograph.
* Hallucinations and sudden, inexplicable spells of aggression.
* The eye symbol in his room and in the pool is on the same tombstone where the Book Of Crimson Ceremony is found in New Game+, for the Rebirth ending. 
* He’s got a family, according to his journal.
* This male patient writes about himself with very little esteem, and thinks of himself as a selfish coward.
* This journal is found within a neat little ‘Entry-Describes-Hesitating-Over-A-Precipice, Pyramid-Head-Throws-James-Off-The-Roof’ chain of events. 
* His Bracelet is stained with blood. 
* There’s jail-like bars on his door window. 
* The alchemical symbols of his section of code is the Philosopher’s Stone and Lead - a mythical substance that could turn base elements into valuable ones and grant eternal life, and the infamously heavy and poisonous metal.
* Has the most notes, memos, and clues, especially expanding to the Overworld level counterpart.
* And for some reason, the Director seems to be most obsessed with him. 

Eddie is #0090:

* Has an eating disorder and self-care problems.
* Has ‘sensory delusions’. All delusions involve the senses, his being all five and not just visions or auditory. 
* His moldy x-ray of an injured hand vs. Eddie’s affinity for handguns. 
* The school-like combination lock for his door, and not a proper key. 
* His nasty bracelet was found in the midst of his mattress mold stain - he either simply left this residue whilst lying there, or he melted away into goop. Keep in mind, his other symptom is insomnia. 
* The moldy bugs scurrying away from Pyramid Head’s scraping noise, and also from James’ flashlight. 
* His alchemical symbols of mercury and sulfates, both highly deadly in their vapor form.
* Him being introduced to James by throwing chunks into a toilet while a rotten body is stuffed into a fridge nearby, all in close hand with this emphasis on dirty bathwater and mold.
* Eddie’s boss fight being surrounded by refrigerated, butchered, hanging animal bodies as he reveals himself as an opportune murderer - the only one of the three with the most (theoretical) rotting corpses in his wake. 

And Angela is #0130:

* The female out of two males. 
* Paranoia and traumatized, only opening up to an implied female staff caretaker.
* Pillow forts and blanket shelters in her room. 
* Seemed to have broken through a wall to make a hole fit for a smaller figure, running to the floor below to make more pillow forts, this same path mimicked by a Mannequin monster from James’ perspective. 
* This is in comparison to Angela’s boss fight having tight, broken-through hidey-holes in the apartment walls that are lined with newspaper and house a teddybear toy, seemingly a manifestation of where Angela would hide from her family IRL.
* The radiograph of a pelvis/hip area, and a marked X at the bottom, close to the crotch. 
* Her written note about the ‘him’ is explicitly questioning the staff’s decision to keep them in the same area, as opposed to passively accepting ‘his’ presence like the other two. Like she knows there’s something especially off when you take into consideration her condition versus Pyramid Head’s attributes. 
* Her alchemical symbols of iron and gold, both male zodiac symbols, and amongst the most valuable. 
* Her bracelet has been defiled with purpose, not just incidentally splattered with blood or grown dirty with mold. 

And enter our surprise player, Patient #3141. I propose that this patient represents the hospital Director - going off of the symptoms and the typed font memos we find in the Otherworld - but there’s even more to it. Some clues point to #3141 also standing for James. Some point to a more meta ‘This Is You, The Player’ direction. Maybe he also represents the forces of Silent Hill itself. 

The Otherworld Hospital level takes place in the same building, but there’s a new puzzle to tackle, and the architecture has been altered. James needs to break three chained locks on a mysterious ornate box:

A numerical cylinder lock takes you past the Angela-Patient room of L1, to a suspiciously-quiet block of rooms where a diary page gives you clues concerning a handful of pills in the sink, a blinking light, and dreading when the clock strikes a certain hour. The handwriting of the diary being the same as the bloody gameplay hints you had found in the beginning of the game. When you rotate the clock hand to a specific hour, a deafening alarm draws swarms of enemies to you, like how you’d dread the return of an abuser coming home from work. 

An electronic pinpad has you trawl back to the Director’s Office and above it, to find an ECT device where Flesh Lips used to be, and it needs to be powered back up. The generator will be found after re-exploring the padded cellblocks and Radiography (where the bulletin will now only show the skull and hand, chains wrapped around the throat and wrist). Turning on the ECT machine will burn the combination numbers into the surface of the bed. 

And the actual keyhole of the box will take you to the James-Patient’s room area, where the eye graffiti has been obscured by its pupil-hole expanded to obscure it. Some rooms away sit a cowering dummy in a wheelchair. You use a mallet and orbitoclast set - lobotomy tools - to access its left eye socket and retrieve a Lapis Eye Key. Getting these tools requires a return to the kitchen and cafeteria area, now even grosser. 

So, you can see some connections already. But they’re seemingly not as self-contained to Angela, Eddie, and James. More accurately, they all pertain to James first and foremost, with some aside nods to the other two. The numerical cylinder lock answer takes place in the Angela-Patient area and has references to dreading the arrival of an hour signaling a change in the lighting and an antagonist force, but the note has handwriting laterally adjacent to James - the early-game street memos of Eastern Southern Vale were presumably written by the disfigured corpses lying nearby, all of them sharing James’ clothes and model. “YOU’VE BEEN HERE FOR TWO DECADES” indeed. 

[Dr. Walter Freeman described one 29-year-old woman as being, following lobotomy, a \\""smiling, lazy and satisfactory patient with the personality of an oyster\\"" who could not remember Freeman's name and endlessly poured coffee from an empty pot.](https://preview.redd.it/lqls9wbbd6af1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=175d711b1f0024a39177fe925d372493c1504bfa)

The electronic pinpad’s answer is where Eddie-Patient’s room is, plus also where the only few clues referencing #0090 were, but they also center around the Director’s Office and the Flesh Lips boss battle. The use of an ECT machine reminds us of an execution by electric chair, especially with the way they set it up in that room, all spotlit and hooked up like a spider’s web. Next to it, a staff’s note says that it was Patient #0050 (James) that had snuck into the room, and he also mysteriously knows how to turn it on. But notably, he was NOT scheduled for actual ECT treatment. You then flip the paper over to see the obsessive Director’s typed notes, *“So close. It will happen. Has to.”*

And you get the key by exploring the moldy kitchen area again, but the dummy itself sits where James-Patient’s room was. Much like how the in-game ECT method had been obsolete since the 1950’s, lobotomies had been obsolete since the 1960’s. Their modern evolutions (like TMS and Corpus Callosotomy) are much less violent and more effective, while their in-game counterparts would have been inhumane. Both were prescribed to mentally ill patients in vain, ill-informed efforts to reduce harmful symptoms of psychotropic disorders, but they were also done to ‘treat’ pandemic victims like tuberculosis patients, and also were a systematic abuse forced upon marginalized people - women, people of color, disabled people. ECT forces the brain to have seizures, while a lobotomy damages the frontal lobe. 

The town of *Silent Hill 2* has been dated to roughly be stuck in a late 1980’s-1990’s period, with a wall calendar dating to 1982 at the earliest, and the few computers resembling something between a Commodore 64 and a Packard Bell. There’s printed copy paper notes, but also typewriter ones. The pharmacy uses glass containers rather than the plastic amber vials of today. Cars are all real-world 70’s and 80’s models. Videotapes, VCRs, and camcorders weren’t mass market until the late 80’s. 

By the end of the 80’s, both the spike-through-the-eye lobotomy thing and the metal-colander-helmet method were long out of date. If the Otherworld Hospital wasn’t a complete Freudian hallucination dream journey to the center of the mind sequence, it’s conceivable that a crazed Director dragged out old tools from storage out of desperation. 

Either way, your given rando ‘knows’ that lobotomies and ECTs are one step above torturous mutilation. They were literal punishments in all but name. A cheating husband commits his wife to hide his infidelity, and she gets forever brain damaged. Incarcerated Black activists are arrested and institutionalized to have their skulls fried under the guise of ‘treating’ their ‘aggression’. You’re autistic and struggling because your parents insist on running the dishwasher every night at 7pm, boom. You’re a troubled teen ‘cause of domestic abuse, zap. You fight back against the bullies at school, bang. 

All three of the cast - James, Angela, and Eddie - might have been subject to these ‘treatments’ under different circumstances. Even the pills themselves could have been an abuse, as medications of the past could involve highly dangerous amounts of barbiturates, bromide, etc, leading to poisonings, addiction, cancer, and more. The punishment motif is clear. 

It’s also in these trappings of medical malpractice that we begin to really turn the spotlight solely on James, and shift away from Angela and Eddie. After going through all this rickamaroll to open this alleged miracle box, it’s unlocked to reveal … nothing. James’ expression is a clear “FML”, hilarious to see. Immediately afterwards, the curtain behind falls away to reveal the Lady Of The Door and her two rings being the true key forward. You do all this bullshit to try to find the solution, try to unravel the twists and turns of a troubled mind, and you don’t get an answer. James had been acting in the shoes of this Director. 

What does give James the true out? Finding a spider-adorned copper ring on a white linen covered pedestal and putting it on the right hand of the statue, and taking a skull-adorned lead ring from a rotten refrigerator and putting it on her left. The valuable and conductive copper one, analogous to marriage. Maria pops back up out of nowhere right after James takes it from its white pedestal, and he even spins around with a joyous “Mary!” at her voice. The heavy and poisonous lead one, Maria has to help you lift the lid off of a toppled fridge that resembles a metal sarcophagus, and she’s the one who spots the ring amongst its rotten insides, gives a quip about how ugly it looks, and hands it to James. Right before, James and Maria walk under a magically-raining hallway to the pool area. And right after, this lead ring goes on the left hand, which is traditionally the hand that bears the wedding ring.  

[\\""Not very cute, is it?\\"" she says, verbatim about James' marriage\/wife.](https://preview.redd.it/lndme93bc6af1.jpg?width=686&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=934f72b0a5e88692890a7a1c897eae4dd440342a)

The door opens. The Director’s final note: *“It is done. Sick no more.”* Maria hesitates to follow him down, and for good reason, ‘cause this is where Pyramid Head chases her down and slays her. 

This was the true out. The true path forward, and a nod to James’ truth. If Pyramid Head isn’t actually an antagonistic force, Maria isn’t actually a helpful ally. For every path forward Pyramid Head surplexes you towards, Maria makes an effort to redirect you away. 

And there you have it. Those three patient files had plenty of significance, but ones that require a player to do some digging and re-digging to reveal. Like all fan theories, this is all largely speculation, and my conclusion is just my own. I do like the idea of a nonsentient Silent Hill having a bit of self-reflective irony in portraying itself as a struggling Director on the verge of a mental breakdown, trying its best to ‘cure’ its ‘patients’. Or would that be a reflection of James’ subconscious view of Silent Hill? 

I do not think Silent Hill is meant to be a sapient entity. I wouldn’t be surprised if James’, Eddie’s, and Angela’s experiences are great outliers, and Silent Hill’s weird powers are usually reserved for cult-affiliated people and them alone. I don’t think *Silent Hill’s* message is one of morals or redemption; Asia has Christian population percentages in the single digits, and game devs would most certainly draw from Buddhist, Confucian, Taoist, Shinto, and folk beliefs before they’d pull from a nebulous understanding of bible stuff.

Pyramid Head isn’t an individual. The various monster types aren’t species or races. Silent Hill 2 isn’t the literal. It’s a dream sequence. A look through the eyes of those enchanted.

1loqss4,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1loqss4/coffee_saga/,Coffee Saga,"This story spans years. My current roommate (28m) is one that I've lived with for four years now, split up. We lived together for two years then separately for a year and have now been living together again for two more years. 

We are friends but tend to have friction. He's unclean and needlessly rude at times but we're the kind of friends that fight and then go back to normalcy like it never happened. To be honest, I only moved back in with him out of necessity, but I can mostly deal with it. Until it comes to our coffee. 

When we lived together the first time, my parents got me a stovetop Moka pot for Christmas. I brought it home and started using it in the mornings. Not long after, my roommate asked to try some and I let him. It then became him asking if I had any leftover every single morning. And that turned into him asking me to just make enough for him to have some. And then him just using it without asking. At first I decide it wasn't a big deal, telling him he just had to pitch in for the coffee. But then it got worse.

He'd never clean the pot. Whenever I'd grab the pot in the morning, I'd find his cold, wet, gross coffee grounds leftover from the previous day. I confronted him and just asked him to rinse the pot out after he used it. At first he said he would, but never did. After repeated confrontations about it, he admitted he thought I was making a big deal out of nothing and that it didn't matter if he left the grounds in it. I told him it did matter to me and that I wanted him to do it. And he still never did. 

It got to the point of the Moka pot being stained inside and outside and smelling bad even after a cleaning. I eventually stopped using it altogether. When I moved out, I let him keep it. I was mad about all of it but at the end of the day I wasn't that pressed about keeping it, especially after it got gross.

Cut to a couple years later, and we move back in together. At the time, he was still using the crusty old Moka pot every morning, the one that my parents got me for Christmas. I had gotten myself a small pour over set that I would use from time to time, but I work at a coffee chain and would usually just get coffee at work. Eventually though I went back to school and decided to get myself a coffee machine. Nothing fancy, just a cheap coffee maker so that I could brew multiple cups at a time to sip on during days I was at home doing schoolwork. And I get free bags of beans from my job, so it seemed like a great idea. But then it started.

One day he asked if he could have what was leftover in the pot. I should have said no. But I didn't. A week later and he's expecting me to have enough brewed for him when he wakes up. Then he's brewing coffee for himself using my coffee maker and my beans when I'm not there, the Moka pot sitting unused in the cupboard. And again, I decided it wasn't a big deal. I got the beans for free anyway.

But hey guess what, he would never throw the filter full of grounds away. He'd never rinse the coffee pot out. He'd never even dump what was leftover. So I told him he needed to just throw the filter away and rinse the pot out after using it or he couldn't use it anymore. At which point he laughed in my face and told me ""nobody in the world rinses the coffee pot out after every time they use it."" And I told him I didn't care, it's my coffee machine and my coffee and if he wants to use it he needs to clean it. So then he started pointing out things in the apartment that we share that are his and saying I couldn't use them anymore. We fought and didn't talk for a day and then everything went back to how it was.

I decided to just try not to care but I always did. Especially considering how he started using more of the beans than me. And would then pester me to bring more home when we ran out. Eventually I told him he had to start buying his own coffee. Cue freak out. I'm selfish because I get it for free etc. I drop the subject. I stay mad and he stays getting my coffee.

I finally stopped though. I don't drink coffee at home. I don't bring beans home. He can use the dirty coffee pot all he wants if he buys beans  himself. It's not a win I guess but at least I'm doing it on my own terms. Am I the crazy one? Am I over-reacting? Should I share my free coffee unconditionally? I'm kidding, I know the answer, that's why I'm posting here. Just feels good to get it off my chest. A years long silent battle finally over. 

I have countless stories with this guy though. One time I came home to him napping while our kitchen ceiling had water streaming out of it. And when I asked why he came home from work, saw it, walked around it, didn't do anything, and took a nap, he got mad and said ""What would I have done?""

1loqsr9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1loqsr9,AIO Boyfriend broke up with me for texting a male friend,"Me (F28) and my boyfriend(M38) started dating a few weeks ago. Last week, we went out to a coffee shop and everything seemed fine until I asked him to take pictures of me. He was obviously annoyed with me and questioned if I was really “interested in him”. After, we headed back to his place and talked a little. He decided he wanted to clean both of our cars. We then went out and cleaned our cars for about 30+ mins. We headed back inside and I began to watch YouTube on the TV. I pulled my phone out to check it and he started a conversation. I then realized every time I was on my phone he would start a conversation. He kept asking me if I was really interested in him or do I even care what he was  talking about. The thing is he wasn’t talking about much and would only say something if I got on my phone. I wasn’t even on my phone that much!! Fast forward to 3am I woke up and joined him in the living room as he was watching TV. Everything was going good until he noticed a text message on my phone. He was upset that I was texting a male friend, even saying it felt as if someone punched him in the chest. He asked if I was willing to show him the messages. I felt super uncomfortable and thought he was overstepping. Still, I agreed to show him the messages. The messages were a friendly conversation between best friend’s. He was angry after reading due to the time we were texting. My best friend works overnight and I so happen to be up and texted him back. Well, my bf did not care and asked me to leave at 4am. Two days later he broke up with me because he could not look past it. I am so sad and haven’t heard from him and he’s ignoring me. I would like to know if you guys believe he overreacted or do you guys believe he’s reasoning is valid?  ",0,1751338249.0,AmIOverreacting,41,0.5,False
1loqsmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/roleplaying/comments/1loqsmt/partner_search_fxa/,Partner Search | FXA,"She’s never been the type to chase the spotlight. Red carpets, curated stories, flashing cameras—none of that was ever her. She’s the girl behind the scenes: the one who brings him coffee after eighteen-hour days in the studio, the one who tucks love notes into his bags before he flies across the world, the one who stays silent when the tabloids pair him with someone else yet again. She’s known him longer than the world has—before the fame, the tours, the ego. And somewhere along the way, she fell in love with the boy he used to be when no one else was watching.

But somewhere along the way, she became invisible.

The story begins on her birthday—a regular Tuesday for him. She doesn’t expect much; she never has. Just a few hours, maybe a walk, maybe a movie on the couch like they used to do before his phone never stopped buzzing. She doesn’t say it outright. She never demands. She just smiles, quiet as ever, and suggests, *“Maybe when you’re done at the studio… we could just do something. Anything, really.”* But he brushes her off, distracted, already halfway out the door.

She doesn’t cry—not at first. She just sits in the quiet, one hand resting on her belly—a new secret, just starting to show. A life growing inside her. His child. And she wonders if he’ll even notice when she’s gone. Because she’s not angry—just tired. Tired of being a second thought in a world she never wanted to compete with. Tired of giving everything and getting almost nothing in return.

**What I’m Looking For:**  
I’m searching for someone to write the role of the celebrity in this emotional, slow-burn story about love, and neglect.. Your character could be a musician, actor, influencer—whatever feels right. The key is that he’s lost in his own world, too caught up in the demands of his fame to see how much he’s hurting the only person who’s never wanted anything from him but love.

I've always had mood swings that weren't too bad, like I'd be happier for a couple hours out of the day, but it's been getting worse over the past 2 or 3 years. I started to experience my mood swings on a monthly basis, where for a month I'd be happy and motivated to get my life in order and would be really grateful for the people around me, and the month after I'd be reconsidering everything I'm doing in life and all the friendships I have, coupled with lots and anger and bitterness towards all my relationships and some SI, with small spurts of happiness lasting anywhere from 1-3 days. This year started off with a 3 month long depression followed by 2 months of, well not depression I guess. Starting at around mid-late May though it's just been nothing but depression, and the small bit of happiness I do get just feels like a baseline and nothing more, it'll only last me like 1-3 hours out of the day. The only thing that brings me anything close to ""true happiness"" anymore were the ADHD meds I've been trying (I started stimulants in February, my first one being ritalin, which made me practically hypomanic), and even then I still feel like shit on them. I can't engage in my hobbies anymore without feeling anything but anger, worry, and frustration and I'm pushing what little relationships I have left away from me. I quit my job earlier this month leaving on a very negative note (the work-environment caused by corporate was too much for me to handle), I'm taking a summer math class right now that I'm doing surprisingly well in but I think that's only because of my current medication (Dexedrine) I only take it when I have homework to do. Sometimes I'll take it if I'm really desperate to get my head to shut up but it rarely helps with that. 

I don't get it. I don't have issues with getting out of bed for the most part, and hygiene has never been an issue for me. Sometimes I'll forget to brush my teeth at night, but that's just from being tired from staying up. I've been getting coffee with my mom a couple times a week (I'm usually the one inviting her), and I'm kinda decent about running errands. I plan on going to a local thrift store tomorrow. But I just can't feel anything but either bitterness or emptiness for most of the day. I just started therapy a couple weeks ago but I haven't felt any better. Maybe my ADHD meds are making things worse/causing me to feel this way? I don't know. My psychiatrist suggested antidepressants/anxiety meds but after a bad experience I had with Wellbutrin 2 years ago, I'd really rather stay off them. Though recently it's been getting to the point where I'm desperate and might consider starting them. I know no one on this subreddit is gonna have the answers I need/want, I just want to put this out there if it'll make me feel a little bit better. It's so weird because I started the day off feeling meh, got coffee with mom, was feeling alright and an hour after I got home it was just nothing but negative thoughts and wanting to die until I started writing this, and now I'm at a baseline. And even then as I was writing this I could feel my mood fluctuate. I've had concerns that I might have some kind of underlying bipolar but I've never had a manic episode before.

I have two close friends and things are rough with both of them. One of them ... our friendship has been increasingly a weird mutual celebration of how special and complicated we are. And that's fine, we are both special, complicated people, but that's not all friendships should be. There should be much idle chatter over coffee as much as there are deep lifechanging conversations, and there hasn't been.

The other one, is in a circumstance. And I tried to force her to make good decisions to get out of her circumstance. And that was stupid. That's all there is to it. No good will ever come of forcing anyone to do anything.

The thing is I **know** it's possible for me to have a normal social life. I've done it before. Twice, actually. Both times my brain ruined it, once by unexpectedly deciding to go to law school and once because I embarassed myself because I couldn't get high (see my other posts) when everyone else could.

There's a pretty obvious solution -- go more places that have people. Try more activities, and keep building the personality I've been building which is interested, normal, and non-pushy. Making progress. Winning the argument. Getting better.

It's going to be okay. Both in regards to my friends and in general. But right now I'm lonely, and it sucks.

It's a great question, as minimalism can easily feel sterile without it. I think teh key is layering subtle textures that complement the clean lines. We're not talking shag carpets and velvet couches here, but rather things like a nubby linen throw on a simple sofa, a woven basket for storing blankets, or a ceramic vase with a matte finish.

Another thought is to play with natural materials. Think a live edge wood coffee table (if that fits yoru minimalist aesthetic), a sheepskin rug (a smaller one!), or even just incorporating house plants with different leaf textures and shapes. Light also plays a huge role; bouncing light off different surfaces can highlight subtle textures you already have.

My girlfriend thinks I overreacted but honestly I'm not sure.

I went to this local diner by myself around 2pm on Saturday. Nothing fancy, just wanted some pancakes and coffee. The place wasn't busy at all, maybe 3 other tables occupied. My waitress looked like she was in her early 20s, seemed nice enough when she took my order.

Everything was going fine until I needed to use the bathroom. It's one of those places where you have to walk past the kitchen area to get there. As I'm walking back to my table, I hear my waitress talking to another server near the kitchen. She's pointing in my direction and says something like ""see that guy over there? Total weirdo vibes. Keeps looking around all nervous and shit. Probably lives in his mom's basement.""

I froze. Like literally stopped walking. I have social anxiety and yeah, I probably do look around a lot when I'm eating alone because I get uncomfortable. But hearing someone just tear me apart like that when I'd been nothing but polite? That stung.

I went back to my table and finished my food in silence. When she brought the check, she was all smiles again asking if everything was okay. I just paid the exact amount on the bill and left. No tip.

Now here's where it gets complicated. My girlfriend found out what happened (I told her why I was upset) and she thinks I should have still tipped because ""that's her job and she probably makes like $3 an hour."" She says what the waitress said was wrong but I shouldn't have taken it out on her paycheck.

But I don't know man. I tip well usually, like 20% minimum. I've worked food service before so I get it. But this felt different. She was making fun of a paying customer for no reason other than I seemed awkward to her. That's not okay in my book.

Part of me wonders if I should have said something to her directly or asked for a manager, but confrontation makes my anxiety worse. Walking out without tipping felt like the only way I could respond.

Should I have sucked it up and tipped anyway, or was walking out justified?",20,1751337490.0,AITAH,72,0.73,False

Did you just pull a 6 star or 5 star piece and want to color match other parts of your outfit but the regular palettes just don't work? Well, this one's for you! I'll include visuals as well to make it easy to do! First, this requires X-palette unlocked. Don't fret, this can be F2P-friendly too! Let's say you have a 4-6 star item you want to style with, but you want to incorporate some 3 star item(s) in your fit, first, unlock X-palette on any of your 3 star pieces, then click X-Palette, then tap or click an empty area to back out of that part selection. Find your other piece you want to match the color from, then you copy the color code from that. After you do that  go back to your 3 star item (or any other item you unlock X-palette for) and paste the color code you just copied! Depending on the material the color should match exactly or you may need to make micro-adjustments on the color wheel. This is super helpful for those of us who want to perfectly match parts of our outfits or if you have that perfect shoe you want to match something else! Also, you don't NEED to unlock X-palette on the 4-6 star item to do this. Just open X-palette on the item you DO have it unlocked for and then you can freely select another item to grab the color code. Happy matching! :) I used this tip to match an unrelated skirt to a 6 star top at the end of the screenshots!",36,1751337489.0,lifemakeover,2,0.98,False
