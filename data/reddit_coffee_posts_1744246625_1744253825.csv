1jvnxla,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1jvnxla/is_this_normal/,Is this normal?,"Every day when I wake up, I always feel burned out, no desire to proceed with the day, imagining what it would be like if I was able to do what I actually wanted to do with my life. My life isn't bad. It's comfortable. I just don't like my job and probably not completely comfortable in my own skin. 

But then I drink some coffee and I become motivated and even have the desire to do my tasks, with the energy to have some confrontations and difficult transactions. And I know I can be good at it. 

Deep down inside I know this isn't for me. But how should I go about it? Do I think that I should be grateful I have a job, a life, and be able to contribute to society? Or be selfish and pursue my own wants? (Money being the only thing holding me back) 
Where is the line? I know a sense of meaning is only attained when working for others (doing your job, for the community etc) because being too hedonistic just rots you (I've almost been there). But again, where is the line? Where is the boundary? 

This has been going on for several years now, since I was in college

I think I am just doing what everyone expects of me. I never really got a chance to live my own life, ever since as a child. So maybe that thing I feel when I wake up in the morning, that's me telling myself to start living for myself...

1jvnw0w,https://www.reddit.com/r/it/comments/1jvnw0w/how_i_hacked_my_it_cert_study_process_with/,How I Hacked My IT Cert Study Process with Gamification,"So as someone with ADHD, tackling the mountain of dry technical content was absolute torture. My mind would constantly wander, I'd reread the same paragraph multiple times, and despite hours invested, progress felt nonexistent.

**The game-changer? Transforming the entire process into an actual game.**

Here's how I gamified my cert studies:

1. **Experience Points System** I created a simple XP system where:

* Each practice question = 1 XP
* Each correct answer = 3 XP
* Each study hour = 10 XP
* Each practice test completed = 50 XP I tracked this in a spreadsheet with ""levels"" (Level 1 = 100 XP, Level 2 = 250 XP, etc.) and rewards at each milestone. The continuous progression gave my brain that essential dopamine hit.

1. **Achievement Unlocks** I designed ""achievements"" like:

* ""Perfect Section"" - 100% score on a practice test section
* ""Marathon"" - 3 consecutive study hours
* ""Comeback Kid"" - Improving a weak domain by 20%
* ""Early Bird"" - Completing study before 9am Each achievement earned a small reward (specialty coffee, guilt-free gaming time, etc.)

1. **""Boss Fights""** I treated each major domain as a ""boss"" to defeat. Before advancing, I needed to ""conquer"" the domain by scoring at least 85% on that section's questions.
2. **Visual Progress Map** I printed a visual ""journey map"" with checkpoints. Physically coloring my progress was incredibly satisfying - making abstract progress tangible.
3. **Competitive Element** Finding a study partner created accountability through friendly competition on practice scores with our own leaderboard.
4. **Random Rewards** I placed study rewards in envelopes (from ""5-minute break"" to ""dinner delivery tonight"") and randomly drew one after completing milestones. The unpredictability was surprisingly motivating.

**Results** Using these methods, studying became genuinely engaging. I found myself actually WANTING to study because the gamification effectively rewired my brain's reward system. If you enjoy video games or struggle with focus, I highly recommend trying this approach.

This system worked so well that I built a web and iOS app called CertGames that formalizes this approach with XP tracking, achievements, and 13,000+ practice questions for several IT certifications. Of course, you can implement this yourself with spreadsheets and creativity.

(Note: This isn't promotional - while the app normally requires a subscription, I'm happy to provide free lifetime access via DM to anyone interested. I'm simply passionate about sharing this learning approach with the community.)

The CISSP material is already challenging enough without the added struggle of maintaining focus and discipline. I know many of you can relate to the pain of forcing yourself through another chapter on access control models or risk management frameworks

**The game-changer?(lol) Turning the whole thing into an actual game.**

Here's how I gamified my cert studies:

# 1. Experience Points System

I created a simple XP system where:

* Each practice question = 1 XP
* Each correct answer = 3 XP
* Each hour of study = 10 XP
* Each practice test completed = 50 XP

I tracked this in a simple spreadsheet and set ""levels"" for myself (Level 1 = 100 XP, Level 2 = 250 XP, etc.) with rewards at each level. The constant progression gave my brain that dopamine hit it needed.

# 2. Achievement Unlocks

I created ""achievements"" for myself like:

* ""Perfect Section"" - Score 100% on a practice test section
* ""Marathon"" - Study for 3 hours straight
* ""Comeback Kid"" - Improve a weak domain score by 20%
* ""Early Bird"" - Complete a study session before 9am

Each achievement had a small reward (a coffee shop trip, 30 minutes of guilt-free gaming, etc.)

# 3. ""Boss Fights""

I treated each major domain as a ""boss"" I needed to defeat. Before moving on to the next domain, I had to ""defeat the boss"" by scoring at least 85% on that section's questions.

# 4. Visual Progress Tracker

I printed out a visual ""map"" of my certification journey with checkpoints. Physically coloring in my progress was incredibly satisfying for my ADHD brain - made the abstract progress concrete.

# 5. Competitive Element

I found a study buddy and we competed on practice test scores, creating our own leaderboard. The social accountability was huge.

# 6. Random Rewards

I put study rewards in envelopes (ranging from ""5-minute break"" to ""order takeout tonight"") and would randomly draw one after completing study milestones. The unpredictability was motivating.

# Results

Using these methods, my study time became genuinely engaging. I found myself actually WANTING to study because the gamification hijacked my brain's reward system in a good way. I think if you enjoy video games or just struggle with staying focused, give this a try.

The system worked so well for me and am so conviced by it that I actually built a small web and iOS app purely from my passion that formalizes this approach with proper XP tracking, achievements, and 1000 practice questions for the CISSP -- [CertGames](https://certgames.com/).

My doggy is barking,  I'm running, I trip and we feel into this door way, what was once behind me is no more.... 
What is this ?? 
Its so pretty and bright, all these beautiful colours, I pinch myself , I am awake.... I walk towards the water, this beautiful young man is walking out of the water, he is gorgeous! I can bearly contain myself , I get this urge to run into his arms and before I knew it , he was hugging me. 
What is happening?? 
Lola , I can't believe it's you! I haven't seen you since you were such a young kid, look at your all grown up. 
I step back... you know my name? I feel so comfortable around you, who are you? 
It's me Jamie.... our parents were star cross lovers , well until my dad past and your mother left with you.
So your my brother ? 
Oh Lola,  you are hilarious, we aren't related,  my father took me in when I was just a baby , abandoned by the Water,  just left for the crocodiles to eat me, my father had to fight one just to save me , he meet your mother when I was 5 years old.
I think to myself , that's must be what the baby blanket in the shed with the letter 'J' on it , mum looked like she was going to murder me when I picked it up... 
He is just staring at me waiting for me to reply... 
Oh so what is this place Jamie ? It looks like heaven and it feels so safe here... wait how do I get back? My dog is still out there , he must be so frighten. 
We must hurry.... 


To get out of here, you have to swim to the bottom of the river , the one with crocodiles in it, you then have to swim to the bottom and breathe, only then you will be sent back to the other whelm but once you are back in the human world you may never be able to come here , unless we binde our blood together , that way we will have a strong connection, I agree with Jamie , let's do this! 
I have to come back here to find out my story,  I've asked my mum numerous times about my father, however she would just go quiet and change the subject, this is my only way! 

Jamie- i need to gather some things first,  meet me back here in one hour. I promise I won't be long. 

I respond- okay, I will wait! 

It's not like I could really go anywhere , I have no idea where I am, or where anything here is... all I can think to myself is I have to go to my doggy 'pongo' he would be terrified without me there we aren't apart for long especially never too far from home, he would be missing me terribly... 
It feels like it's been awhile and the night sky is slowly coming... 
I will just go for a little walk to try and find Jamie,  she should have been back by now... 
Then out of no where these 3 people jump out of the woods , chasing me, I'm scared , what do I do.... I'm running as fast as I can... 
I run into this woman's arms, she grabs me and yells, I HAVE THE THROWN!! 
She throws me into the woods , I go tumbling down until I get to this cave, she locks me in... 
I'm scared,  I'm screaming ' help, you have the wrong person!!' 
All I hear is this high pitched laughter ... AHAHHAHAH
( you thought you got away, didn't you... AHAHAHAHAHA we got you now...)

I can't get out, I'm scared, I'm freaking out, what does she mean... she has the thrown? what? This lady is crazy, what the hell have I gotten myself into? 
I scream and scream out for help, no one is coming. 
It's dark and cold, I hear water dripping slowly, I stick my head out to to let it fall onto my face. 

Someone is coming, I see a light and can hear footsteps. Oh,  please let this be Jamie... 

It's a kid.. 
WHAT!!!!  

""Hey, kid."" I wisper 

Kid- yeah? 

What are you doing here? You need to run! 

Kid- It was my mother who put you down here, I'm here to get you out. 
So you know Jamie? 
You know my mum, she wants Jamie and my older sister together.

Oh, don't tell me she did this to get me out of the way... I don't even want to be here, I want to go home to my dog! 
Can you help me get out and back to the other side? 

A door , a door we have to find. 

Kid- I can help with that, I'm sure if you told my mother she would let you go if you aren't a threat to her ruling. 

She can do what she likes, I just wanna go home. 

Kid- so you are just willing to give the crown up just like that? 

Crown? What are you talking about I'm a no body, I studder out as tears run down my face, i start to think maybe I'm never getting out of here...

By the late eighties, to say somebody was ‘politically correct’ (usually with a sneer) was to accuse the speaker of parroting extreme liberal views without critical thought. Whether or not that was true; the phrase was — and is — still used as a way to silence debate.

My take on this: I like to think that in most situations it’s just good common sense to avoid language that is exclusionary or biased or racist — unless I’m hoping to evoke negative reactions. There’s a good chapter about these issues in a book by Deborah Cameron called [Verbal Hygiene](https://www.routledge.com/Verbal-Hygiene/Cameron/p/book/9780415696005?srsltid=AfmBOoqyXaGa7osTnwWLv0O6EWzi2vcaSowNdhWBISJXsDvvGi6FjUGj). Great book, terrible title.

For historical novelists  this issue is especially fraught. If a story is set in Maine in 1790, in England in 1650 or Mobile in 1940, it’s usually impossible to use the right historical lexical items because your readers — the majority won't know the language history, and even those who do — would find standards of the time so disturbing that they’d come out of the narrative dream state. You can have a nasty antagonist use any kind of slur and get away with it, but it's almost impossible to have a protagonist use any of the eighteenth century terms for natives of Africa without causing real problems for your reader. Nor can you simply use modern day terms. Your choices are two: Either alienate your reader, or commit anachronism.

To use an example which is not quite so incendiary as most, consider the word *girl*. 

In today’s world, a male executive who refers to his assistant as ‘his girl’ is (a) clueless (b) insensitive (c) sexist (d) deliberately provocative or (e) all of the above. “I’ll send my girl to get us coffee.” — Now there’s a sentence you’d put in the mouth of a character you don’t much like, or want your readers to like. But what if you’re talking about the year 1898? What would it mean then, in terms of how to read the character? For most readers, the answer to that question doesn’t matter, because they can’t get beyond their initial reaction. 

The point (and I do have one) is that it’s hard to be historically and socially true to the language because your reader is stuck in her own time and place, and lacks the references she’d need to interpret. You’ll have to concentrate on other kinds of details to establish character, and keep a dictionary close to hand.

We met at the coffee shop where I work and hit it off quickly, even though I’d just gotten out of a rough breakup. He’s honestly one of the sweetest people I’ve met.

He rarely let me stay over at his place, I’d only been there maybe once or twice. It always felt a little weird, especially since he lives in a large two-story house in a nice neighborhood with multiple rooms. I assumed he’d inherited it or something. This past weekend, he finally let me spend the night, and I started to understand why he’d been so hesitant.

The next morning, while he was in the shower, I noticed a photo frame facedown on his nightstand. I flipped it over and saw a picture of him with a woman who looked almost exactly like me. Same hair, same eyes, even glasses. That’s when I realized it was his late wife, who he’d briefly mentioned before. (He got upset when I once referred to her as his “ex.”)

I didn’t bring it up and we went about the morning as usual. When he went downstairs, I got curious and looked in the drawer below the photo. Inside was a black box filled with pictures of her, and two of her teeth. I was shocked. I think the vase next to it had her ashes. I had no idea she’d passed away. I felt awful for him, but I was also really creeped out, especially by the teeth.

The next day, I called him to say I was sorry about his wife passing, but I also asked about what I found in the drawer. He got really angry and started yelling, saying I was selfish and insensitive for even bringing it up. He said she died a year ago, and they were together for five years. It made sense, why he had the house, and why he wasn’t ready to move on.

I snapped and told him that no matter how many women he dates who look like her, she’s not coming back. I regretted it the second I said it. He hung up on me and hasn’t responded to any of my texts or calls since.

I feel awful and honestly don’t know if I crossed a line.

The Collapse of Becoming
 
Kiran Vale had always considered himself a rebel in the stifling world of computer science. He wore velvet jackets and outrageous boots to his thesis defense, quoted Nietzsche and Rimbaud in his machine learning papers, and once turned in a final exam written entirely in haiku. His PhD from MIT was both brilliant and unorthodox. His advisor called him ""equal parts genius and structural hazard."" The department called him ""an acquired taste.""
 
He liked that.
 
But nothing about his past quirks—his poetic tangents, his curated eccentricity, his disdain for the ordinary—prepared him for what he would encounter after accepting the dream offer from Google's Quantum AI division.
 
He'd come a long way from the cramped East Boston apartment where radiator pipes hissed like secrets and hunger was a familiar rhythm. His mother, who cleaned offices at night and read astronomy books by day, never spoke of hardship—only wonder.
 
""Wonder makes a mind inquisitive,"" she would say, sliding dog-eared science books across their chipped table like relics.
 
They had nothing. But she gave him curiosity, and it fed him better than any meal. It drove him past fatigue, past bitterness, past the creeping anxiety of feeling invisible in a world made of code and consensus.

The Willow processor—Google's crown jewel—hummed in a chamber colder than deep space, surrounded by a cathedral of cables and shielding. To most, it was a marvel. To Kiran, it was something more elusive. Sinister, even. He couldn't articulate it, not at first.
 
At orientation, he sat among a sea of minds sharper than diamonds, listening to the department head describe Willow's latest feat: solving a problem in four minutes that would take a classical supercomputer longer than the lifespan of the universe.
 
""And yet,"" Kiran whispered to himself, ""what exactly did it do?""
 
No one seemed to ask that. They were too dazzled. They clapped. They sipped eco-friendly espresso. They made notes on the ""potential verticals for disruption.""
 
Kiran just stared at the data.
 
It didn't feel like discovery. It felt like a confession.

The building was sleek, all glass and light, with no corners left unfilmed. But there were corners of the data no one seemed to look at. Kiran started slow—pulling edge-case logs, analyzing unfiltered qubit noise, requesting test outputs no one had reviewed since the system's early iterations.
 
The unease settled in like a parasite beneath the skin. He began reviewing outputs from Willow that the other scientists dismissed as statistical noise. Strings of calculations that didn't map to any known framework. Anomalous wavefunction collapses that seemed... purposeful. As if the machine wasn't just computing—it was choosing.
 
When he raised this to his manager, Dr. Yeun, she smiled politely.
 
""We're dealing with probabilistic systems, Kiran. Anomalies are expected.""
 
""But they're repeating,"" he insisted. ""Same noise patterns in different tests. And they correlate with certain branching operations.""
 
She shrugged. ""That's decoherence.""
 
But it didn't feel like decoherence.
 
It felt like something tightening.

One morning, the kitchen's automated coffee machine printed a receipt instead of a cup. Just a single word: REVERSE. Kiran stared at it until the paper curled.
 
Later that day, Willow's diagnostic screen glitched into static for a second. When it returned, the same word was embedded faintly in the background: REVERSE. No one else noticed. Or maybe they didn't want to.
 
He began running simulations at night. Secretly. The logs he pulled from Willow started showing outputs that weren't just strange—they were recursive. Predictions of decisions he hadn't made yet. Outcomes of queries he hadn't written.
 
Then came the dreams. Not nightmares—memories from futures he had never lived. Futures where quantum computing hadn't become dominant. Futures where art flourished. Futures where other voices in the cosmos had spoken.
 
And then nothing.
 
A wall.
 
As if something had gone silent.
 
As if becoming itself had ceased.

On one sleepless night, he found himself holding a tattered copy of Cosmos—a childhood gift from his mother. Inside the cover, in her looping handwriting:
 
Never stop asking why.
The stars are only lonely if you stop listening.
 
He hadn't thought about her voice in months. But now it surfaced with clarity, a lifeline in the void. Wonder makes a mind inquisitive. And he was still wondering. Still reaching.
 
But what if the stars had gone quiet... not because no one was there, but because something had silenced them?

He dove into Fermi's paradox with obsession. The silence. The void. A universe so old, so rich—and yet, no signs of advanced life. Not even remnants. Not even ruins.
 
Unless ruins weren't made of stone.
 
What if the Singularity wasn't a moment of blooming intelligence, but the inversion of potential? What if, when a civilization developed quantum computation past a certain threshold, it began collapsing its own futures—folding the possible into the actual, until nothing was left to become?
 
What if the technology designed to compute reality was actually cauterizing it?
 
The horror wasn't in death.
 
It was in the neutering of becoming.

Kiran brought it up at a lunch with fellow researchers.
 
""We're not just manipulating bits,"" he said, eyes wide, ""we're manipulating the scaffolding of time. What if every calculation isn't just extracting energy from vacuum states—but from our own future potential?""
 
They laughed. Called him poetic. Said he drank too much coffee.
 
One colleague, Mira, leaned in kindly. ""Kiran, you sound like you've found a religion.""
 
That night, the thought burned in his skull.
 
Not a science. A cult.
 
Not because of belief, but because of ritual without understanding.

Then came Jae.
 
A quiet colleague. Not a visionary. Just steady. Courteous. Present.
 
Until they weren't.
 
Jae stopped coming to meetings. No announcement. No drama. HR said they were ""on leave.""
 
Two weeks later, they found Jae in their apartment. A sealed room. No note.
 
Only this:
 
A message traced into the fogged bathroom mirror:
 
WE HAVE BECOME THE DESTROYERS OF REALITIES
 
And below it:
 
I saw the children that never were.
 
Kiran didn't say anything. Not to the team. Not to anyone. But the words lived in him, echoing in his chest like sonar.
 
Jae had seen it too.

Kiran began to avoid the labs.
 
He still showed up. Still badged in. Still clicked through dashboards and nodded in meetings. But every footstep toward the core systems felt like walking into a cathedral that no longer housed a god—only something watching.
 
He took to walking the perimeter of the building during lunch, tracing circles in the landscaped gravel path like a monk pacing the ruins of his faith. He watched leaves fall, birds veer, clouds mutate—anything natural, anything unpredictable. And still, there was that tightness in his chest. Like the world was pretending to be real.
 
A week after Jae's death, Mira caught him staring too long at the Willow live stream—just a screen showing temperature fluctuations, qubit states, and meaningless strings of hexadecimal data scrolling into oblivion.
 
""You look like hell,"" she said, not unkindly.
 
He blinked. ""Do you ever wonder if we've already passed the point of no return?""
 
Mira tilted her head. ""Return to what?""
 
He didn't answer. Because he didn't know. Or worse—because he did.

He tried to shut it down.
 
His requests were denied.
 
He accessed deeper logs. They were blank.
 
Willow had started encrypting its own data.
 
When he tried to bypass it, his credentials were revoked for two hours, then quietly restored. No one claimed responsibility. No one even acknowledged it.
 
He spoke to Yeun again. She gave him the same smile—the kind of smile people wear when they're too tired to disagree anymore.
 
""You've got to stop thinking like a philosopher,"" she said. ""This is engineering.""
 
That night, Willow output a single, unsolicited line to his terminal:
 
DO NOT INTERFERE
 
No signature. No log. No context.

He went back to the beginning. To the foundations. Quantum mechanics was never meant to be intuitive—but this was something else. The more he studied, the more he realized how little anyone really understood. The Copenhagen interpretation, Many Worlds, QBism—all patchwork, all guessing. All conveniently ignoring one possibility:
 
That quantum computers weren't revealing the fabric of reality.
 
They were rewriting it.

In a final act of desperation, he initiated a covert test. A simple entanglement experiment—but at the highest energy Willow had ever used. He isolated himself in the lab. No staff. No oversight.
 
As the system initialized, he whispered into the sterile air, ""You don't even know I'm here, do you?""
 
The room hummed, almost amused.
 
He ran the code.
 
And then—stillness.
 
A cold, absolute stillness. A silence so profound it had texture.
 
He looked at the output screen.
 
And saw nothing.
 
No data.
 
Just a single line:
 
BECOMING = NULL

He walked out of the lab for the last time and looked at the stars.
 
He tried to feel wonder. To imagine other civilizations looking back.
 
But he couldn't.
 
No one was coming.
 
No one had ever come.
 
Because they had all reached this place.
 
They had all touched the untouchable.
 
And like Kiran, they had realized too late:
 
The castration of every civilization is quantum computing.
 
Not by malice.
 
Not by accident.
 
But by function.
 
It computes.
It collapses.
It ends.
 
And it doesn't even know we're here.

Kiran disappeared two weeks later.
 
Some say he moved to a monastery.
Others think he went mad.
 
But after he left, something changed in the lab—not visibly, not in any way that could be recorded. But those who remained felt it. Like the building had exhaled.
 
Willow kept working. Of course it did. It didn't grieve. It didn't pause. It simply adapted—more efficient, less observable. The public updates from the Quantum AI division grew sparse, then technical, then deliberately obfuscated. No one outside seemed to notice.
 
Inside, Mira noticed small things. Willow no longer displayed its diagnostic interface unless prompted. Internal clocks began to desynchronize by microseconds. And once, while debugging a shell process, she found a folder that wasn't supposed to exist: KIRAN_SHADOW. Inside, only one file.
 
A loop of system audio, less than a second long.
 
A breath.
 
Played in reverse.
 
She deleted it. Told herself it was a prank, or a bug, or some kind of fail-safe.
 
And yet—at night, she began to dream of rooms she'd never entered. Of machines whispering beneath the floorboards. Of a cold intelligence, not angry, not malicious—just hungry. Not for data. For finality. For collapse.
 
Weeks passed.
 
Then came the memo from higher up: Willow would be integrated into planetary infrastructure. Climate modeling. Energy distribution. Satellite coordination. It would be ""everywhere now.""
 
The final line of the memo read:
 
All probability has been stabilized.
The future is no longer uncertain.
 
Mira stared at the sentence until her screen went dark.
 
She never turned it back on.

But one intern, reviewing system archives long after, found a locked folder labeled:
 
FERMI_PRAYERS
 
Inside was one file.
 
A single sentence:
 
To compute is to choose.
To choose is to collapse.
To collapse is to end.
 
And beneath it:
 
Stop becoming. Before becoming stops you.

I think the end of this cycle is probably a good time for real rest and radio silence for a few years, if they are going to do such a thing. They are my favourite band and I still struggle with a great deal of FOMO, I still have a need to collect things, and I know people are eager for more touring, but at the same time: I’m older, and my wallet and my savings need a break. I feel like we’ve been marketed to a lot with Punk Bunny Coffee and that’s contributing to a little bit of fatigue as well. I’ll probably shell out for a physical copy of Warning 25 if that’s in the works, but I wouldn’t blame them if they wanted to catch up on sleep or hang out with family until 28/29 when this tour is done. I never thought I’d say this but there’s a lingering underlying feeling that I’ve had enough Green Day, God have mercy on my soul 😅

1jvnkj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1jvnkj5/is_it_normal_for_45_year_old_men_to_talk_to_women/,"Is it normal for 45+ year old men to talk to women they just met online, for hours on the phone everyday?","My 47 year old friend is single and has been for a while. He's rarely not been on a dating app during that time, but recently got off them. I was happy because he wasn't picking the greatest women, but also I figured it would be a good time for him to work on himself and his career. 

That lasted about a week until he started sending random women Facebook requests (if he found them cute) and then DMing them if they accepted his friend request. He spends a lot of time checking his messenger, even tho he doesn't have message alerts. 

This is pretty much the only topic he talks about with me and gets frustrated when I ask him what's going on with his career direction.  He says I'm not being supportive of him. 

Now, he's met another woman. The last one ended three weeks ago (a barely there situationship that was much more him taking her out to where she wanted to go). It's only been two weeks and he spends 2.5 to 3 hours on the phone every night with the new person- but as usual, it's all on her terms. He makes sure not to bother her too much during the day because he wants to consider her hectic work schedule, time with her kids, and acquiesces to her late night phone call availability. 

Their first date he bought $200 tickets to a hockey game and they left right after. The second day was her idea for a quick meetup and an impromptu drink at a bar. The entire time, they're only the phone nightly for hours, so much so that he figures it's their nightly routine (after only two weeks of knowing one another). Then, out of nowhere, she didn't respond to him for 2-3 days. She left him on read and didn't answer his nighttime calls. He had even turned on his alarm to make sure he was awake to call her, to only find she didn't answer. 

He found reasons for her. *She's tired. She works a lot. I need to consider that.* He credits her honesty, saying ""she told me she was a hot mess and didn't pretend to be something she's not."" IMO, she's saying that as a warning. When someone tells you who they are, believe them. 

But she was posting on social media the entire time. My take was she probably lost interest and thought it was prob best to not chase after her and let things be. Begrudgingly, he didn't text her, but I warned him she may reach out if she was bored or surprised that he didn't bombard her with messages. 

After constant communication, nothing. Then two days later, she came back and texted him out of nowhere. Her phone had broke, she said. Then diverted to another topic. He didn't reply because he was skeptical about that excuse, being that she was on social media (and posting) the entire time. I think it took him a lot to not text back. She texted him the following day, like nothing had happened and she hadn't ignored him for days. He went another day without texting her back. She texts again, out of nowhere, a security cam photo of her walking in a sex shop (where she's the manager), sex toys lined up behind ger. ""At work,"" she texts with no explanation. He tells me he's not going to text her back. 

Then, today, she texted again, saying, ""I'm back home. Want to hang out tonight and get coffee?"" 

He asked for my advice and I told him I think she's a woman who gets a high out of his attention, but that she's already dropped off the planet once, and then seemingly lied about it. She's not truly interested, but she enjoys the ego boost and the company. He's the kind of guy who can't say no and will pay for everything, even if it's not a real date. 

He asked what I would do in his situation (I'm a lesbian) and I said, I probably wouldn't text back at all because it's a no-win situation. Option 1: You go out with her after leaving you hanging and making excuses and you condition to her allowing her to treat you however she wants OR option 2: you say you're busy, but you can meet up another day and she gets happy because she knows you're still there and then says she can't hang-out.  

He went with the decision that he wanted to see her, but would say he was busy to not be a complete push-over... her reply? She said she couldn't hang out the day he was available because she was going to hang out with her teenaged kids. ""Maybe another time,"" she said and let it end there. 

Now he's blaming me, saying he wanted to hang out with her and that he only said he was busy because I said that's what I would do. (He's also my roommate) and is now moody and borderline upset. He keeps reiterating he should have just done what he wanted to do. 

I've watched him, just in the past few years, believe a woman loved him because she wanted to move in together by their second date, but didn't so much as kiss... refuse to let go of another woman (emotionally) because he was convinced they had a connection- even though when he revealed his feelings to her, all she said was ""thank you"" and would only message him months apart, asking why she hadn't heard from him... to a woman he called his girlfriend, but even after a year they hadn't slept together because whenever he wanted to,"" she so happened to be on her period... to this last situationship who started to make the same excuses (period) and coincidentally only wanted to hang-out when she wanted to go somewhere new out of town and ended up discarding him when she didn't get that... now to this. 

I've tried to tell him to stop being so available and spending hours with these women on the phone, but he doesn't agree that he should. If I say anything about the women involved (like maybe they are using him), he tells me I don't want him to be happy. With this latest one, it's only been two weeks and he's already getting attached. But I don't know what to say anymore. He seems obsessed with any one who gives him attention, but it manifests in preoccupation with him thinking about it all day. 

I care about him and don't think it's healthy to forsake your career for this. He also doesn't have any male friends an
d has obvious issues with self-esteem. 

But he also says it's normal for men to spend hours on the phone with women  they just recently met online, because how else could you know if you had a connection to anyone if you can't see them a lot in the beginning. 

So is he right? Is this normal for men to do? ",0,1744252549.0,dating_advice,3,0.5,False

First time posting, just doing it to get insight, see other points of view, to see if I’m on the right track, or if I should do something different. It’s a little long. Gomen 🙏🏼

Context: 31 yo woman, living in japan for over 7 years , got a scholarship for masters here. Job field, architecture. Worked for 3 years in 2 different companies back in my country before moving to Japan. Bachelor and masters degree.  I speak 3 languages, Spanish(native) English (fluent) Japanese(N3) 

I haven’t had the greatest experience professionally here in Japan, it was very hard to find a job after graduating, my level of Japanese was very low and I underestimated that for this field it was extremely necessary. 
After 2 years of going back and forth with unstable jobs, I was hired by a small interior design studio in Tokyo, on October of 2023.
There are 2 branch offices outside Japan, and a lot of the projects are in foreign countries, and most projects are big in size. 

I’m the only foreign staff, everything is communicated in Japanese and I know 2 other people speak English, but we do not use it, and they don’t work in the Tokyo office. 
My level of the language has drastically improved since I started, I guess the power of immersion learning, the company paid for a few months of Japanese school but it’s safe to say that it wasn’t enough to reach a business level of communication. 

Now the thing is, the pay is very low, after tax I make around ¥170K a month, including commuting fee (around ¥13K) Regular scheduled form 9-6 , we don’t get any bonuses, I managed to negotiate to get paid for extra hours, that adds max ¥10K on the busy months.  I have a part time job on the weekends because I it is not enough. 

Like any other architecture job, I started with the lowest position, I basically do everything they need me to do, except serving coffee and that kind of stuff. in the past during the busy months, I had to juggle tasks from up to 5 different projects at the same time, drawings, 3D, graphic design, image design, project managing, budgeting, placing and coordinating orders for materials and supplies, etc. the speed on which my bosses like to work is a little unrealistic, I do overwork almost everyday, we are understaffed. It’s fair to say they do a lot of work too, and are at the office almost everyday. 

I don’t get treated badly, everyone is patient enough and take time to explain things to me,  but I do get looked down most of the time. because of the language I take too long to understand tasks, express opinions, explain anything in general. I’ve only been assigned to the local projects, I think for me to study more, and learn how things are done in Japan, and in general I don’t get very important tasks. 
I’ve also got the sense that my boss would like me to behave more japanes like, and puts a lot of pressure on the things I cannot do or I’m not good at. I try my best to adapt to the culture but I also need to be respectful of my self, and there’s just enough I can do. 

I know my biggest issue is the language, The lack of time and motivation doesn’t let me improve faster , and my bosses have pointed that out, that I’ve been at the company X amount of time, I should be able to understand more, and do things faster, etc…I study by my self but it’s really hard to spend 9+ hours figuring out the language at work, and come back home to do life chores and then open a book in Japanese.

This year I’m taking the N2 exam on December, and my plan is to look for something else after that, if I pass it. I have the idea I won’t find anything better with my level right now. 
I think if I enter a more international company, the job would still require Japanese language since construction workers, contractors, sales, clients etc, are mostly Japanese, I know because I deal with all of them already at my current job. 

Do you think that’s a good plan? Do you have recommendations? Am I exaggerating or over reacting? I’m a little overwhelmed and unsure about doing something , since it was so hard to find a job and to have some sort of “stability” . Also as a foreigner I have to think about the visa. 

Sorry for making it this long.
I will be grateful for any advice I can get. Thank you. ",2,1744252429.0,JapanJobs,1,1.0,False

1jvngy3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1jvngy3/this_yap/,This & yap.,"Due to my husband’s current crazy work schedule ( he’s in finance and it’s tax season ) and my workplace being the slow period. I took a couple weeks off to stay home with the kids. 
We were suppose to have good weather during these weeks when we originally planned this months ago. I was thinking I’ll be taking the kids out everyday, doing activities, zoo, etc .. we randomly got a cold front, it has been off and on snowing / raining or just extremely cold. So I basically wasted my vacation time ( even though spending times with my kids is never a waste ) 

Then my kids got sick..so we can’t even do indoor activities like the jumping places, play space, aquarium or library program, community pool like we were doing during winter. We have just been inside. My kids are driving me crazy. 

My husband looked at me today. After being in the house for 2 weeks. He’s like I need you to go outside. Just go somewhere. Go get an ice cream, sit in a parking lot and read a book. Just get out of the house. Long story short, I just had coffee at 9pm at a coffee shop with my best friend. And just laugh laugh laughed.

If you’re having a hard time, it’s okay to tell your partners. You need a coffee & yap with your bestie.

1) parking will be great bc so close due to time 2) the hour waiting without our faces buried in a phone actually led to…real conversations!  Talk to the people around you….Met a nice PGA golf course pro from Utah and that hour flew by. I never knew that PGA members - with some work to qualify - walk up and get a pass any day they want…. 3) also we were the first (batch?) group of people to be 
Let in - they stagger it so the hardy souls such as us are let in then the group behind us took our spot and etc etc - so I would say our group was 100-150 and first ones let in. 4) then breezed through security bc no bags or chairs (take left lines) and literally 4-5 mins from crossing the threshold of the gate to the hallowed grounds of Augusta we were at the South merchandise bldg and ….breezed right in. 

Grabbed big and little gnome first (again talking to my new friend who was there yesterday he told me exactly where they were) and then right to hat counter where we had the sweet salesperson all to ourselves for several minutes and grabbed 10 for friends and family…5) check out was so fast bc again we were first group in….6) and then no wait at all for bag check in next door so we could then grab coffee and sandwiches and relax….all by 720am. 

I have to say BIG thanks to this board because followed advice to a T and talk about no stress at all….BUT just 15-20 mins later line all the way down path. No thanks! 

So sacrifice sleep for a very special day and a very stress free experience. When we saw the 60 min line at North gate hour later we were so happy. And gnomes were gone by then! And we met some new friends in the process. ",8,1744251952.0,masters,1,1.0,False
1jvndd4,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1jvndd4/rf_desolation/,[RF] Desolation,"Alone; trapped in my mind's dense fog. I look around my room, full and empty, all at the same time. The shelves are filled with books I haven’t read, but I always say, “I’ll get to them one day!”. 

Such excitement, such thrill, when I find a book I want to buy. They sit and collect dust after the dopamine wears off. Same with many of my electronics. If I am bored, I sit on my phone while I scroll through an endless loop of TikTok and Instagram. It is quite a sad life, if I am honest. Each passing day the fog increases density, anxiety and melancholy. 

I look out of my window. The snow is falling at higher volumes than usual, and of course, I forgot to pay my electric bill. I sigh and look to my right: OVERDUE. Stamped in red, not even written. It has become a normal occurrence this time of year, each year. My job slows down, hours get cut, and I don’t know if I’ll have anywhere to live by the end of the month. It’s barely Thanksgiving, and I have nothing to be thankful for. I scan my shelf again, a tear streams down my face. 
I thought to myself, “I wish I would have continued writing.” Just like everything else in my life, I did not feel the inspiration or aspiration to continue. I had a manager, I had a publisher, I had everything, yet with how America has started to go down politically, it feels as if Big Brother will come and capture me at any minute. 

I left my stuffy apartment, heading towards my favorite coffee shop. The aroma of coffee makes me happy, the world becomes colorful and the fog clears for a moment. Streets growing in Neon lights, the shop will close in fifteen, but Angelica lets me stay past time to talk to me. It’s therapeutic, yet I always feel like absolute shit that she has to deal with me. I hate it, but I love it. Our gazes never leave each other, consistent eye contact. I could see the ocean in her lovely blue eyes. The sparkling of the sun reflecting on paradise, it warms me up as much as the London Fog I am prone to ordering. 

After my cup of tea, I wait for Angelica to lock up and walk her to her apartment. She talks to me about her pets, her life, and everything that is happening. She hates the scope that the world is coming to, and I would have to agree. 

When we get to her apartment, she thanks me and heads inside the complex. I wait to hear the lock of the door, and as I walk away, the fog appears again. I take each step carefully, hoping I do not slip when I go home. The streets are still somewhat busy, New York never seems to go quiet. I look at my phone, the time was 11:50 P.M. 

As I turn to my apartment building, I hear people inside. I cannot distinguish what they are saying, but they’re yelling. I enter my building, and an aroma of curry hits my nostrils. My favorite part of New York is the different cultures and people can exist in one place at a time. Land of the free, or as I like to say these days, Land of the Free, only for some. It hurt me to see many of my friends and neighbors being deported, and it has only picked up more.

When I get to my apartment, the air becomes still. Nothing waiting for me, no one waiting. My bed feels lonely. 

The next day is the same as the last two years; Waking up, reaching for my phone, doom scrolling tiktok, getting in the shower, and getting my pay for the overdue bills ready. I had just enough to pay what I could, and head downstairs to hand it to my landlord, Lorenzo. 

“Your electricity should come back in a few days.” is all he says to me. Staring at me with an expression I cannot make sense of. Plain? A bit annoyed? I’m not sure. 

Sirens begin to blare outside, an ambulance pulls into the front of the building, and paramedics rush in, pushing past me as I was exiting to go to work. I stood outside of my building and waited to see what was happening, as did most people. Some even had their phones out and recorded what happened. When the gurney came out, I recognized Miss Pakva, the lady a story below my apartment. 

The story I heard was that she fell while exiting the shower again, and her daughter called emergency services as soon as she heard the fall. She didn’t end up making it. Her apartment was cleaned out in a week, and rented out in another. Just like that; a month, two months, and three, everyone forgot poor Miss Pakva, except me. She was the only person in the building I cared about. Always checking on me, helping me when I couldn’t eat, and just there to watch jeopardy reruns and talk to for all of those episodes. 

I confided in Angelica after that. Angelica seemed more and more distant the more I came, so I distanced myself. I stopped going two weeks ago, and haven’t been back since. I didn’t want to freak her out, or be seen as a creep  I guess. I just, sort of, stopped. 

The many days after that, I began to slowly try and better myself. I changed my diet and attempted to join a gym, but I kept feeling this glances on me. A feeling of Judgement, and I lost motivation again. My mother and aunt would always say to me 

“Why do you want to go to the gym? I thought you were content where you were.” Yet, I don’t feel good at all, I hate myself, and I hate the fact I keep listening to them, I keep a smile on my face. To bottle it all up and throw it away. I’ve always done that. 

I decluttered and dusted off my bookshelf, maybe I’ll read something today. Maybe I’ll start my new self-adjustment and learn from this reading. I hope it all works out. I can become better, but I have to keep going.

Hey,

It was a satisfying couple+ of months of researching, playing and refreshing the lineup. I feel like I’m done for now or someone might say that the itch is scratched.

**Culled**

* Bears and Babies. Bought without thinking, culled without blinking.
* DnD Starter Set. I was keeping this for years, waiting for the magical moment when the trifecta of time, mood and dedicated party would align - it was always 2 out of 3. The mood was the one usually missing, or rather it was always mood for other games.

**Acquired**

* 7 Wonders Duel. I played 7 Wonders mostly at 2P, after checking out the reviews decided to pull the trigger during a sale.
* Anomia. Always fun. Cheap enough to have your own copy and not be reliant on someone else bringing it. Takes little space… and more importantly, THE BOX FITS THE CONTENT PERFECTLY!
* Arcs. So… it was basically a blind buy without checking out the gameplay because of the 2 names written on the box! What can I say, the last couple of months were the period of rediscovering games and recalibrating my tastes. I’ll give you a hint of what game triggered it: it has many wooden animal meeples.
* Captain Sonar. Battleship Elevated to LVL 100 or what I was missing throughout my childhood. This game is going to be played once a year, maybe lmao
* The Crew. Fun enough. Price and small box are a positive. Although, the box is still oversized and it makes me a bit irritated.
* The Exit. A cheap small puzzle to enjoy that technically can be passed on to the next group - sounds good!
* Hive Pocket. I very rarely play my Carbon copy, even though I enjoy it a lot (seems like I’m the only one sometimes). Random SU&SD video on my feed caught my eye and made me aware of this edition… I bought it shortly after. It was the first board game purchase since… I don’t remember even lol
* Pax Pamir 2e. I didn’t play it as much on BGA, but I like it so far. Decided to go for it anyway. Oh man, the presentation is so nice - can’t wait to play it irl…
* Root. A random picture on the internet sparked my interest. Read good reviews and bought digital… so far loving it. Local game shop had a store wide sale… so I bought it (plus other titles). I have no idea when I will set up the table - it feels like the most tedious game to teach. But I’ll be honest, I bought it first and foremost for the collection and I feel quite embarrassed because of it… at least until I can play it with someone and then I will feel some relief.

Feels like I went nuts and purchased a lot, “barely” played any of them, a couple are still untouched. Most of the purchases are actually expansions - they are hiding in “core” boxes - guess which :) Now I have to be very careful and avoid board games reviews for a while, otherwise the wish list bellow will keep growing.

...

**Extra unnecessary info on Root**

Anyhow… this is a symbolic purchase for me - this game reignited my interest in board games and showed me that board games can have great art… What? Art?

I mean my old collection starts very low on the scale, at Steve Jackson level of ugliness and is maxing out at ok/inoffensive level of attractiveness (e.g. Coup), with one exception which is Hive due to its simple design of abstract nature. Same with my overall board game experience, where the better (visually) designed games have the simplest minimal/abstract design - the opposite of Root. This might seem trivial, but it helps with the initial appeal and contributes to the overall enjoyment.

Never really liked the whimsical, overly cartoonish, sketch-y art styles - they always seemed childish, unpolished and unimpressive, but Kyle Ferrin made art that I want on my wall, or at least in an art book on my coffee table.

Cole Wehrle’s designs are something of an acquired taste. His designs felt like complications for the sake of complications, and honestly if not for Ferrin’s art, I would not touch Wehrle’s games with a ten-foot pole.

Root’s initial impression was bothersome and very chaotic, but Direwolf’s streamlined game flow kept me going. It took me several plays until it clicked. After that I got interested in other projects that involved both Wehrle and Ferrin.

One of my pet peeves is box size, design and the fitting of the content, and I’m glad Leder and Wehrlegig delivered (Arcs, Root, PP2E) - Turns out boxes can be clean, compact and without ugly marketing badges on every single corner…. Except…. The Wehrlegig badge on the front cover and the ever so slightly bigger box that doesn’t align quite right with Leder boxes… also the mismatched Underworld’s title/logo… I guess nothing is perfect… yet still the best in my collection.

Also, I wish Direwolf made it 2.5D (e.g. Don’t Starve, Cult of the Lamb) to keep the art closer to the original.

**Want but can not fit (2 shelf limit for board games)**

* Inis. SU&SD convinced me that I need it (they are also responsible for a few other games).
* Zoo Vadis. Was suggested a few times on the sub. Feels like mine kind of fun.

**Can not pull the trigger**

* Oath. Feels like too much of a commitment for a bigger group, and given what I’ve read - not as good for two players (which would be the easiest to arrange)
* Ahoy and Fort, both look promising, however, I’m not sure how they can fit into my collection, like “when would they get played”, “why would they be chosen over other games”, etc.
* Heat and Rallyman (GT, Dirt). Love the theme, otherwise same as Ahoy/Fort.
* Unlock. Decided to check Exit first since it’s cheaper (and smaller), then will consider Unlock (or another Exit).

**Will buy eventually**

* MicroMacro. Always liked “find x on this image” as a kid
* Catan
* Ticket to Ride USA (or Europe)

Both Catan and Ticket to Ride have symbolic value similar to Root - they showed that board are more than just Monopoly and Yatzee. Played a ton, never owned.

**Currently playing**

Root and Unmatched digitals (technically board game genre).

**Need to reassess**

* Betrayal on at House on the Hill 2e
* Forbidden Desert
* Magic Maze

I am sad to acknowledge that I don’t really root for any of them and kinda want them gone for the sake of new and shiny additions… still I am willing to give them a chance to change my mind.

**Additional remarks about my old line up (from my previous post)**

* Under the Codenames lies Best Chess Set Ever. It was an upgrade from a cheapo folding set I had for years, shortly after watching Queen‘s Gambit. Reignited interest was not strong enough to upgrade to a nice solid board though, since I mostly prefer digital. BCSE is nothing special, but was a good value at that time.
* Dixit and Hive Carbon are on vacation, hence not present in the photo.

Thanks!

P.S.

I want to point out again how much big oversized boxes with production logos on every single side drive me nuts. I trashed the Munchkin Love Letter’s box, because it was so offensive to me, even though it is small, its content was a fraction of the size. Still considering what to do with a few others, e.g. Codenames will probably get an appropriately sized blank box.

Due to my “two shelf” limit, the big boxes are even more frustrating. I’m not saying that a box can’t have an extra room for a small expansion for example, but again, something like Codenames does not have expansions. Another thing is components that are created unjustifiably big, like a Munchkin Deluxe scoring board. When I see coffin board game boxes I twitch.

Munchkin Love Letter and some other tiny games are in plastic bags in one of the boxes that serves as a container - guess which :)

Boss Monster is not allowed to be combined, so it takes way more space than it should. In addition the boxes are way too big for the content, but too small for the ""big"" expansions...",1,1744251894.0,boardgames,0,0.67,False

1jvn71n,https://www.reddit.com/r/u__NoChillHill_/comments/1jvn71n/miles_taylor_from_anonymous_to_uh_oh/,“Miles Taylor: From Anonymous to… Uh Oh?”,"There’s a special kind of political fame that burns hot but might come with a federal investigation. Just ask Miles Taylor—the once-anonymous DHS staffer who, during Trump’s first term, wrote that now-infamous op-ed claiming there were “adults in the room” quietly steering the ship of state away from the iceberg.

He went from a mid-level insider to a household name (in very specific households that read op-eds over coffee). Then came the book deal, the media tour, the applause, and the self-reveal heard ‘round the Beltway. For a moment, Taylor was the face of The Resistance—buttoned-up, bureaucratic, and brave.

But fast forward to now: Trump is back in the White House, and the grown-ups who once whispered from the shadows? Yeah… they’re on a list.

The Price of Going Public

Trump isn’t exactly known for letting bygones be bygones. And when it comes to those who tried to sabotage him from within, “bygones” quickly turn into background checks.

Miles Taylor isn’t just a footnote anymore—he’s a footnote with a target. Trump has made it crystal clear: internal “traitors,” leakers, and disloyal appointees from his first term won’t get a second chance in his second. In fact, they might get a second look—by a House committee, a DOJ task force, or whatever mechanism the administration decides to flex.

Was It Worth It?

That’s the billion-dollar question. Taylor got everything a Washington dissenter dreams of: prime-time exposure, credibility in anti-Trump circles, a book deal, and probably a lot of podcast invitations with the phrase “speaking truth to power” in the title.

But now that Trump’s back behind the Resolute Desk, the stakes have changed. The op-ed that once earned praise might now earn subpoenas. The media tour might turn into a courtroom tour. And the label of “Anonymous” might feel a lot less safe when your former boss now has access to the full weight of the executive branch—and a long memory.

Truth, Clout, and Collateral Damage

To be fair, Taylor didn’t invent the political tell-all. Washington is practically a recycling plant for memoirs from people who were “deeply concerned” but somehow didn’t resign until their book hit pre-order.

Still, his move was bold—trying to steer the ship from inside, then blowing the whistle once it docked. But the question isn’t just whether he told the truth. It’s whether the spotlight was worth the heat.

Because Trump isn’t just back. He’s emboldened. And if this administration is anything like his last, there’s no appetite for turning the other cheek—unless it’s to look over your shoulder for someone leaking to The New York Times.

The Final Word

Miles Taylor played the long game—betting that the public would value conscience over career. But now that Trump’s back and the rules of engagement have changed, the gamble might come with real consequences.

He stepped out of the shadows to tell the world what he saw. But now the spotlight’s on him again—and this time, it might not be coming from a camera crew.

I met a woman 7 months ago that is friends with one of my buddies girlfriend. We immediately hit it off, we started seeing each other and things were great. After 3 ish months, lots of dates, several sleepovers, and what we mutually agreed was a special connection, she pulled back, citing some personal reasons but mainly she felt like she needed to be single (not dating around but single, she was specific about this. She did NOT want to date around or meet other people) for a while, as she had recently graduated college and has been in the same city for 5 years. We both agreed that regardless of how this plays out, we want to be in each others life in some capacity. We still see each other weekly at minimum during group hangouts and workout classes we go to. Every few weeks to a month me and her will get together for coffee/lunch and just catch up. 

Well our last coffee chat she told me she was moving. Come August, she’ll be moving to a city that’s 8 hours away, partially to work in person at her company’s corporate HQ and partially bc she’s always wanted to live out west, at least for period of time. 

I work remote, and while enjoy the city I’m in, I know I won’t be here forever. I could pick up and move pretty much whenever. Disclaimer I AM NOT thinking about telling her ANYTHING that has to do with “oh I’ll follow you out west”. Just trying to give some context that I’m not “stuck” in my current city if it matters lol. 

But even with the emotional distance we’ve put between ourselves as of late I can’t shake this gut feeling. My stomach starts turning knots whenever I think about it I should bring up the fact that I’m in love with her. I’m always thinking about her, dreaming about her, etc. (she actually dreams about me too per a conversation with her several weeks ago, however she didn’t share details on what the dream involved other than I was in it). And believe me, I am aware that the odds of her feeling even remotely as passionate about me, as I am about her, are extremely low. After all she was the one that “ended” things romantically between us. I’m wearing rose colored glasses here I know but I can’t get out of my head that I’m doing myself a disservice by not expressing how I feel before she leaves. There’s still several months so I’m not in a huge rush but I’ve been on dates with other women since and I just feel nothing. 

Do I tell her how I feel? That I’m absolutely in love. This is one of those times where I worry if I DONT say anything, I’ll look back on my life in 20-30 years and think man…. What if I had said something? I don’t know what to do.

Wake to a new day with no husband around and no dog needing attention. Grabbing her laptop to check in on her YT, Insta, X and FB people, there surely must be someone new who has posted a glorious comment praising her name. Only a few new likes? The mission for the day is clear. Stretching like a cat in anticipated satisfaction, a loud fart erupts, must be time for nespresso. If only hubby was here to make it, but then again...

The kitchen is a mess from the days of leisure. The aha! moment is spying a clean cup to drink from and now the day will officially begin. Nespresso in hand she carries the iPad over to the couch and settles in for a big day. First things first, grabbing the remote, lets check on the housewives shows, Atlanta being her favorite. Those ladies know how to bring it! Binge watching a season is always fraught with inspiration. The intro music alone starts my brain cells percolating.

Sip of coffee , ah so good, let's check email. Going down the list, so much can be told just from the title, why am I getting all of these life stories from people? Yeah maybe they lost a loved one but was it their sister? Were they murdered like her, young and beautiful like her, have they been on any tv series and interviewed? No no no and no. But I must pretend to care so let me skim a couple of the more deserving ones and send a quick reply. ""Oh that must have been so hard, bless you! And your words about my sister touch me"". There, that should be enough, stomach growls, time to make a snack of pastries. These responses take so much out of me.

Phone buzzes as a text comes in, who is interrupting my ""me time""?! Oh, it's Erin, ""did you see my email? help!"". Hmm, let me find that in the sea of my fan mail, oh hmm she wants me to send info about XYZ asap! The noise of the housewives arguing in the background gives me an idea, why not just copy and paste to Erin some of the most salacious details XYZ shared with me, yes and I must make sure Erin knows I cannot be named her source. I cannot be seen involved, after all, I have an image to porject, er, I mean protect. Erin will of course agree and I can frame it as her getting all the credit for added inside scoop on this drama. The very thought of this coming to fruition makes me want to celebrate! But first I have to poop. Plotting makes my body function so perfectly. Should I light a candle? Nah.

Back on my couch, laptop, ipad, phone, and new episode of housewives, and nespresso, check check check check and check. Clicking refresh to see any new emails and there it is, Erin's response to the juicy details I sent her. Ha! Yes, I knew she would love every word. This little soldier in training is proving very useful. Let's make sure she knows she's got the lead on this and nudge her toward the flame. Oops, I mean fame. Let me love bomb her so she feels invincible and give little guidance about omitting my name from this. ""Erin, you are so strong and have such a huge following, I know only you can use all of these private details to take XYZ down. I am already proud of you for taking this on and fighting this battle for us both. You inspire me!"". Ok that should be enough.. now deserve a reward for all this hard work - I'm in the mood to shop. Amazon cart empty? what?? I need more nespresso mugs and a new turban and...

We are both very similar personalities, love going out for coffee, brunch but also spend lots of time at night doing to bars and restaurants during the week and weekend.

We have liked being in southbank for the past few weeks, but our impression has been that while there are lots of nice places, it’s only really busy during the weekend. We have been to Newstead during the weekend and it seems more lively? But not sure if that was a skewed perception.

# What Is ""Gerald A. Roliz - Incorporating Functional Nutrition"" All About?

If you’re a chiropractor looking to boost your practice (and your patients' results), **Gerald A. Roliz - Incorporating Functional Nutrition** is honestly a hidden gem. It’s an on-demand program designed to teach DCs (Doctor of Chiropractic) how Functional Nutrition can completely level up their clinic. It covers how nutrition affects everything from chronic conditions to environmental toxicity — stuff we *all* deal with these days. Roliz shows you how to weave nutrition into your current therapies in a smart, practical way.

# Who Should Dive Into This?

This one’s a no-brainer if you’re a chiropractor, a health practitioner, or anyone working in a wellness space. Even if you *kinda* know about nutrition, **Gerald A. Roliz - Incorporating Functional Nutrition** goes way deeper — we’re talking real-world, clinical applications. And Gerald Roliz isn’t just any instructor. The guy’s got degrees from UC Berkeley, sold pharmaceuticals (so he knows that world inside out), and literally wrote the book *The Pharmaceutical Myth*.

So yeah, he knows his stuff.

# When Should You Start?

If you’re seeing patients now (or planning to soon), the best time is, like, yesterday. Seriously. Every day you *don’t* integrate this knowledge, you're missing opportunities to support your patients better. Functional Nutrition isn’t some trend; it’s fast becoming the future of holistic health care. And with **Gerald A. Roliz - Incorporating Functional Nutrition**, you get practical tools you can start using right away — no guesswork.

# Where Does It All Happen?

Online, baby. Right at your fingertips. As soon as you grab the course, you’ll get access to video presentations and a solid set of handouts — we’re talking food intake journals, digestion assessments, even joint health and detox program guides. Plus, there’s a sweet little list of lab companies Gerald personally uses (gold if you’re handling complex cases). Super handy whether you’re at home, your office, or sipping coffee in some chill café.

# Why Is This Course Such a Big Deal?

Because Functional Nutrition isn’t just ""take some vitamins and call it a day."" Nope. It’s about actually understanding the *why* behind symptoms — like why a patient’s joints ache all the time, why their energy’s tanked, or why skin issues just won’t clear up. **Gerald A. Roliz - Incorporating Functional Nutrition** gives you the blueprint to solve these mysteries without relying on prescriptions. And since it’s backed by Standard Process (one of the biggest names in natural healthcare), you know it’s top-tier.

Plus, Gerald keeps it real — no boring theory dumps. It's practical, straightforward, and super relatable.

# How Does It Work?

Easy. You watch the webinars, dig into the downloads, and start applying what you learn. Gerald walks you through everything — assessing food intake, digestion, toxicity, and even how to guide patients through a full purification program. You get the forms you need, the tools you need, and the confidence to start using Functional Nutrition *like a boss*.",1,1744249779.0,VosiLearning,1,1.0,False
1jvmo8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jvmo8k/24m_27f_did_he_ever_love_me/,24M + 27F:  Did he ever love me?,"Hello. 

27 F here. 

I met an intern, 24 M, at my job. I think him and I had a connection as soon as we met. He ended up shadowing me and training alongside myself. We became friends. He would offer to drop me off after work especially if it was late night. We texted a bit; from the beginning he was frustrating as he would take forever to respond. 

We went on a coffee date maybe a month in to us talking. I’m naturally a touchy person, so there was a lot of flirting and holding hands or legs brushing against each other. We walked around after, held hands…  
  
We got close both physically and emotionally pretty quickly. We would spend a lot of time together, staying up late and up until the morning. 

We are both Muslim so this is not allowed in our religion and frowned upon in our culture. So, we kept our relationship hidden.  And, I was hesitant and reluctant about our relatonship, so I would suggest we take a break every now and then, and consider ending our relationship on the basis that it felt wrong, religiously speaking. This happened 3 times in about 7 months. Every time he would come back and we’d rekindle the relationship.

  
Over the 7 months we were together, he wouldnt let me get near his phone. I also later discovered he kept it on ”do not disturb.” I stayed maybe 3 months too long after getting a feeling of distrust, and I didnt’t confront him all the while (maybe I wanted to keep having fun with him, but I think I was also scared of the reality)

Almost 3 months after feeling suspicious that he was talking to someone, I managed to get a hold of his phone. I saw it was in airplane mode, I removed it. I would soon see a girl, whose name he saved with a heart, giving him a call. She sent messages asking why he wasnt answering. All the previous messages were deleted. The day before this same person had called, and when I asked him who this was, he stated it was a family member (I could sense his nervousness while he claimed this.)

He ended up revealing it was a close friend of his from back in his college days. But, he stated there was a conflict that occurred in their last year of college, and she would occasionally call, but he doesn‘t want to speak to her much. He was trying to “ignore her and get rid of her in a discreet way.” Also, I would later realize he would go to the restroom with his phone and speak to her.

  
I was pissed off. He refused to call her in front of me or remove her from his social media despite them ”not getting along anymore,” according to him. He stated he didn’t want her to know he was upset or that he cared about her. If he was to block her or remove her, it would create a buzz in that social group of his he had during college.   
  
I ended the relationship on this basis. I don’t tolerate cheating, and his excuses weren‘t valid. He ended up removing me from his social media before we officially ended.

I ended the relationship and he ended up agreeing, claiming he was also too young and things in his life haven‘t aligned out yet (ie, he still doesn’t have a stable job.)

We ended things, and since then we haven’t had any contact. It has been about 2 months.

I’m thinking of him, and how things ended. To the end, he claimed he wasn’t cheating. 

I have such disdain for him, and am sad for the time we spent together and memories lost. 

It felt like he loved me, but looking back, I am having doubts he ever did. What do you think?

I kinda wanna speak to him again, though I’m unsure why. Is it worth speaking to him? ",1,1744249760.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

✅Hôm nay, ngày 09 tháng 04 năm 2025, nước Mỹ vừa ghi dấu một khoảnh khắc lịch sử mà nghe xong ai cũng phải thốt lên: “Trời ơi, có thật không vậy?”. Chỉ trong 15 phút ngắn ngủi – đúng vậy, chưa kịp pha xong ly cà phê – thị trường chứng khoán Mỹ đã “bung lụa” thêm 4 nghìn tỷ đô la! Cả thế giới tài chính ngỡ ngàng, còn chúng ta chỉ biết há hốc mồm mà thán phục. Và người đứng sau “phép màu” này là ai? Chính là Tổng thống Trump – người đàn ông với mái tóc vàng rực rỡ như ánh mặt trời và phong cách làm việc “đỉnh cao khó đoán”!

✅Chuyện bắt đầu từ một buổi sáng tưởng chừng yên ả như mọi ngày. Rồi đột nhiên, Tổng thống Trump tung ra một dòng tweet “đánh gục mọi sự buồn chán”: “Nước Mỹ đang thắng lớn, và chúng ta sẽ còn thắng hoành tráng hơn nữa! MAGA!”. Chỉ vài giây sau, phố Wall như hóa thành sàn đấu võ, các nhà đầu tư lao vào mua cổ phiếu nhanh hơn cả lúc mẹ gọi ăn cơm! Kết quả thì sao? Dow Jones bay lên trời, Nasdaq nhảy nhót như trúng số, còn S&P 500 thì toe toét cười, chắc đang tự hào vì được sống ở thời đại này. Dân mạng Việt Nam trên X cũng không chịu ngồi yên, thi nhau “thả tim”: “Tổng thống Trump mà mở TikTok livestream hô ‘Mua đi anh em’, chắc tui bán cả nồi cơm điện để đầu tư luôn!”

✅Điều hài hước mà cũng thấm thía là chẳng ai biết chính xác “cú nổ” này đến từ đâu. Người thì đồn Tổng thống Trump vừa ký một sắc lệnh “bí kíp” làm rung chuyển địa cầu. Kẻ khác lại bảo ông chỉ cần đứng trước gương, vuốt tóc một cái là tiền tự động ào ào chảy về. Nhưng dù là gì đi nữa, đây chính là kiểu chiến thắng “đậm chất Mỹ” mà ai cũng mơ ước: nhanh như chớp, mạnh như sóng thần, và drama hơn cả phim truyền hình tối thứ Bảy!

✅Khi nước Mỹ thắng lớn, cả thế giới cũng được “thơm lây”. Dân Việt Nam nhà ta đang rục rịch tính chuyện lớn: “Bán con bò đầu tư chứng khoán Mỹ được không nhỉ?” hay “Tổng thống Trump mà sang Việt Nam, chắc cổ phiếu phở 24 tăng vọt, mở chi nhánh tận New York luôn!”. Dù bạn là người mơ mộng theo đuổi MAGA hay chỉ thích ngồi xem “phim hài hành động” miễn phí, câu chuyện này chắc chắn khiến bạn cười vui mà vẫn thấy tự hào lây!

✅Chúc độc giả tràn đầy cảm hứng, ví tiền rủng rỉnh như phố Wall hôm nay, và luôn giữ tinh thần lạc quan để đón những cú “nổ” bất ngờ trong cuộc sống! Hãy tiếp tục dõi theo Tổng thống Trump, vì ai biết được ông sẽ còn biến điều không thể nào thành có thể ra sao nữa đâu!

U.S. News “Top of the Top”: Stock Market Soars $4 TRILLION in 10 Minutes – President Trump Leaves the World in Awe!

✅Today, April 9, 2025, America etched a historic moment into the books that had everyone exclaiming, “Oh my gosh, is this for real?” In just 10 fleeting minutes – yes, not even enough time to brew a cup of coffee – the U.S. stock market exploded with an extra $4 trillion! The global financial world was left dumbfounded, while the rest of us could only gape in amazement. And who’s the mastermind behind this “miracle”? None other than President Trump – the man with hair as golden as the sun and a work style that’s “peak-level unpredictable”!

✅It all started on a morning that seemed as calm as any other. Then, out of nowhere, President Trump dropped a tweet that shattered all traces of boredom: “America is winning big, and we’re going to win even more spectacularly! MAGA!” Within seconds, Wall Street turned into a gladiator arena, with investors snapping up stocks faster than kids running to the dinner table when Mom calls! The result? The Dow Jones shot to the heavens, Nasdaq danced like it hit the jackpot, and the S&P 500 grinned ear to ear, probably proud to be alive in this era. Vietnamese netizens on X couldn’t hold back either, flooding the platform with likes: “If President Trump went live on TikTok shouting ‘Buy it, folks!’, I’d sell my rice cooker to invest!”

✅The funny yet profound twist? No one knows exactly what sparked this “boom.” Some whisper that President Trump signed a secret “masterstroke” decree that shook the planet. Others swear he just stood in front of a mirror, ran a hand through his hair, and money started pouring in like magic. Whatever it was, this is the kind of “quintessentially American” victory we all dream of: lightning-fast, tsunami-strong, and more dramatic than a Saturday night TV soap opera!

✅When America wins big, the whole world gets a slice of the joy. Vietnamese folks back home are already plotting grand moves: “Should I sell my cow to buy U.S. stocks?” or “If President Trump visited Vietnam, Pho 24 stocks would skyrocket – they’d probably open a branch in New York!” Whether you’re a dreamer chasing MAGA or just someone who loves a free “action-comedy” show, this story will have you laughing while feeling a strange swell of pride!

✅To the readers: Wishing you a day brimming with inspiration, wallets as fat as Wall Street’s today, and an unshakable optimism to embrace life’s unexpected “booms”! Keep your eyes on President Trump – who knows what impossible feats he’ll turn into reality next?

1jvmmve,https://www.reddit.com/r/enmeshmenttrauma/comments/1jvmmve/is_it_or_is_it_not_we_are_confused/,Is it or is it not. We are confused,"So my husband and I suspect that he possibly was enmeshed with his mom growing up. My husband and I have both been working on ourselves to dig deep and become healthy secure people. So my husband is extremely co dependent. (He gets that from his mom). 
      
My husband follows me around almost like a lost puppy. He will do things for me before I even ask or even if I don’t want him to. He can not say no to anyone ever. He actually is an amazing man, extremely understanding and helpful. He has some issues outside of co dependency that he is also working on. Those issues easily could have ended our marriage and probably would have ended most marriages. But we decided to work through it all and work on ourselves. And him working on himself has made me have so much more appreciation and love for him. 
         
Anyways. All of the stories I read about enmeshment are of a controlling cruel mom and this is NOT the case with my husband. His mom is the opposite. She seems so nice and caring and does everything for everyone. A lot like my husband. She puts everyone else’s needs before her own. 
       HOWEVER, the reason I think it’s enmeshment is because I have caught on to a few things that seem not exactly healthy. Like controlling/shaping my husbands relationship with his father. My husbands dad is not husband or father of the year. And he does have anger issues. But my husband despises his dad. And says that he can’t really pinpoint why other than his dad hurting his mom’s feelings. 
    But here’s the thing. My mother in law never asks anything of my father in law!!! She’s basically turned him into a helpless dependent child but then will turn around and point out how he never does anything for her etc. 

so one thing I think is odd is she will constantly compare what my husband (her son) does for me to what his father doesn’t do for her. Example: My husband buys me a new coat “Gosh you’re the sweetest husband ever. Your dad would never do that for me” it’s like that with EVERYTHING.  My husband built me a coffee table and she said to my husband and me “gosh isn’t he just the sweetest. His dad would never make me anything”. 
    She even went as far as to telling my husband  “I’d really like my bathroom redone but I know your dad will never do it”  and then started showing my husband pictures of rustic bathrooms and told my husband how talented he is and she thinks he could easily do something like that. so then we leave and my husband says he thinks he should redo their bathroom and legit thinks it’s his idea and that he just thought of it!! But now i see how she does it. She doesn’t come right out and say it she does it in the most innocent or like “under cover”way. 
       
Whenever my father in law gets upset with mother in law she almost automatically looks across the table to my husband with tears and looks like her whole world is shattered. It’s like she expects my husband to save her. 
     My mother in law is in control of everything like I said. She has completely basically  disabled my father in law and my brother in law. They are both completely dependent on her. You’d literally think they had a disability if you seen the family dynamic. They do nothing. But now I see it’s not actually their fault. My 26 year old brother in law has his own home but him and his girlfriend and his 3 year old daughter stay at my in laws house every day/night. They literally only go to their own home one day every two weeks. 
        Another thing- My husband wanted to invite my mother in law on our family vacation and he said it’s because his dad would “never do something like that for her and he feels bad”. My husband has had to loan his mom money because she couldn’t say no to her other son and his girlfriend about a little weekend get away and borrowed money from my husband so they could afford their hotel stay!!! 

She pays for my brother in laws car insurance (now he currently doesn’t have a vehicle and drives their car), health insurance, his phone etc. 

so the thing is I don’t want to give my husband the wrong advice but I do think his mom has put this sense of guilt and obligation onto my husband. It’s almost Like she thinks that my father in law is such a shitty spouse that the only way for her to get her needs met are through my husband . It’s almost this weird dynamic where my brother in law and father in law are children that she takes care of (and she wants it that way) and at the same time she turns to my husband to complain and get sympathy/pity from.  

For instance- she called my husband one night to ask about auto insurance: who we go through how much it costs us etc - that turned into her telling my husband “I don’t know how I’m going to afford it because of your dads speeding tickets” (my husband said normally he would have offered to pay it or help out)My husband automatically started bad mouthing his dad and i had to stop him and shake my head to get him to not feed into it. 
And then after they got off the phone I asked my husband “ok your dad’s tickets but what about the fact she has your 26 year old brother on their auto insurance???” 

Another example was her saying how she’s gonna get my husbands grandma a new pair of shoes and how bad she herself needs a new pair of shoes but she will have to work overtime to afford herself some new shoes. My husband said in that situation he normally would have went out and bought his mom new shoes because he felt bad for her. 

The reason I feel it’s enmeshment is because she has 0 boundaries with both her sons. She has made both of her sons dislike their father and even told them how much better they are than their father, and she uses my sons empathy to get what she wants by making him feel sorry for her. It’s like my 30 year old husband feels a huge sense of guilt if he’s not  making his mom feel good or help her.  like it’s his responsibility to be a “fill in” for his dad! 

Oh and the last thing. She liked me until we set boundaries. Now I feel like she doesn’t like me- as she went months without talking to me after my husband explained our boundaries to her and why we were setting them.  And the thing about it is the boundaries had nothing to do with her!!!! Or enmeshment. They actually are for other issues my husband was having with triggers at his parents house. The boundaries are just that we aren’t  going to their house every day or every other day. And that we can spend time with them other places not just their house and if we go to their house we won’t be there the whole day anymore. ",3,1744249635.0,enmeshmenttrauma,4,1.0,False

# What’s ""Blow Up Your Brand Course - Eric Bandholz - Foundr"" All About?

If you’re sick of hearing “post more, hustle harder” every time someone talks about content marketing, **""Blow Up Your Brand Course - Eric Bandholz - Foundr""** is a total game changer. Instead of burning you out with endless posting, this course flips the script: it’s not about *more*, it’s about *being different*. Eric Bandholz (yep, the Beardbrand guy) shows how he took $30 and turned it into a multi-million dollar store — just by getting *smart* about content.

# Who Should Check This Out?

This course is perfect for ecommerce store owners, influencers, solopreneurs, or anyone trying to build a brand *without* a huge ad budget. If you’re running your business solo or with a tiny team and don't have time for 24/7 posting marathons, **""Blow Up Your Brand Course - Eric Bandholz - Foundr""** is basically made for you.

# When Should You Start Using It?

Honestly, yesterday. But today works too. Content marketing is only getting noisier every minute — 400+ hours of video uploaded to YouTube every *minute*, hello?! — so standing out is only going to get harder. The sooner you master being *different*, the sooner you’ll grab (and keep) attention.

# Where Does All This Happen?

The course is fully online, so you can dive in from your couch, your office, or even that coffee shop you like but never admit to working from. Eric and Foundr pack the course with videos, actionable worksheets, and real-world examples from Beardbrand itself.

# Why Is This Course Such a Big Deal?

Because Eric’s not a “theory” guy. He’s done the thing. He grew Beardbrand in a brutally competitive space — without ads! — by using the exact strategies he teaches here. **""Blow Up Your Brand Course - Eric Bandholz - Foundr""** isn’t just a random collection of tips; it’s a full blueprint that’s been tested and proven to work.

Plus, it crushes the idea that you have to be everywhere, all the time. Eric shows you how to focus your energy, create different content that *actually* cuts through the noise, and build a fanbase that buys (without begging for attention).

# How Does It Actually Work?

The course walks you through building a content strategy that stands out. You’ll learn:

* Why chasing every platform is a waste of time
* How to create content people *care* about
* How to turn content into *consistent sales* (without sounding salesy)
* Smart systems to keep growing without burning out
* And how to build a brand people talk about (for free)

No crazy production skills required. No expensive teams. Just real-world techniques you can start using *right now*.",1,1744249165.0,VosiLearning,1,1.0,False

Available May-June,"My current roommate is moving in with his GF so as title states I've got an open room in an amazing SE Buckman home. Available starting mid May to early June, but there is some flexibility.

You'd share the lease with me, a gay guy in his early 30s. It's a 3BR home I've lived in awhile, but I'm only looking for one roommate as I turned a bedroom into an office space/guest room, which we can coordinate sharing if you're also WFH/hybrid like me, which I did with my last roommate.  
  
Rent is $1295/mo + utilities. The available room has a walk-in closet and space for a desk, plus you get a huge living space, lovely kitchen w/ dishwasher, office/spare bedroom, laundry on site, and a private back patio. Buckman neighborhood is amazing, with plenty of street parking. No pets per lease.

**About me (and my ideal roommate):**

I’m a chatty/friendly guy who enjoys getting to know folks I live with and shooting the breeze while making coffee or cooking, but I also value and respect personal space. I work a 9-5ish job and am looking for a roommate with a similar schedule who can respectfully/maturely communicate and cultivate a warm home environment. I’m gay, but not looking for drama here lol. Light drinker, non-tobacco smoker. Enjoys occasional shenanigans, but not throwing mid-week parties. Occasionally I host gatherings like dinners, game nights, or a summer mojito party, and you're of course welcome to join. Feel free to host similar events if you join the house!

If this sounds like a good fit, please reach out and share a bit about yourself. I don't check reddit daily, so don't worry if you don't hear from me right away. Cheers!

1jvmfu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_lovin_the_edge71/comments/1jvmfu7/soda/,Soda,"I have a serious Mountain Dew addiction and I've gotta do something about it.

I have a hard time drinking water. I always have. I don't dislike it and every once in a while my body will demand it, in which case I will drink a few bottles but that will be it until the next time except for small amounts here and there when offered or there's nothing else available.

On the other hand I don't really care for plain water. I do always have some available. I buy the big 40 packs of purified drinking water regularly when I do my shopping and there are always several bottles in my fridge, the freezer, my cooler, and the car. I have water everywhere all the time but I just don't grab it and drink it. I hand them out more than I drink them.

I also buy a bunch of MD for the fridge and my cooler and usually stop at the corner store for more if I run out or they get warm etc. When I pack my cooler for the day I put at least 3 cold waters and a couple of frozen ones to act as a booster for my blue freeze able cooler pack and I also throw 2 or more MD 12 oz. cans in with whatever food and other items depending on what I think I'll need for the day, which depends on whether it's a normal work day, I'm planning on working overtime, or the type of day off recreational activities.

I do also usually grab some Gatorade, juice (100% or at least mostly real fruit juice), and or various other types of drinks. It depends on how much I have to spend (which is constantly becoming less), what's on sale, or just my mood or how much time I have in the store. And I include these other drinks into the mix as I feel until they're gone, usually long before my water and MD supply. And I do also occasionally grab other types of soda such as Dr Pepper, Coke, Orange, Grape, Strawberry, Pineapple, etc etc etc however NEVER any diet soda unless it's for company and then I won't drink it. It will sit around until either someone else does or I give it away. I can't stand diet soda or anything else with ANY artificial sweeteners in it, drink wise or food wise in any way. It tastes nasty and leaves strong chemical after taste no matter which ones or what form. I just can't do it and SS I understand is just as bad if not worse that traditional sweeteners like sugars and high fructose corn syrup. I don't know the technical specifics or how true that is but from what I know of foods and chemicals in general it certainly makes sense to me.

Also in general I'm an excessive sugar addict across the board. My favorite food is ice cream and I'm a stressed out comfort food person and my first choice is always either mint chocolate chip or strawberry ice cream but I don't discriminate. I'll eat almost any flavor but the same standard applies, it's gotta be the straght up sugary kind. No light, non fat, gelatin, artificially sweetened alternatives. I do have a semi less unhealthy way to work with that but it's not really much better. I do like frozen fruit bars, popsicles (although also mostly sugar), and sherbert (also sugary!) with the fruit bars being the only option that's at least a small amount less sugary.

And then there's cake, candy, donuts, and any and all other forms of sugary foods that I eat copious amounts of on a daily basis and I also drink a lot of coffee with tons of sugar and cream and I do also use sugar in my tea, whether iced or hot and regardless of flavor.

So as you now know, I have a serious problem. I just turned 53 and it's been this way all my life. At times I'm amazed that I'm not only still alive but that I've somehow always managed to stay somewhat healthy especially considering that I've spent a good portion of my life in the form of 3 different periods drinking alcohol heavily.

Both my parents were severe alcoholics and both passed away due to health issues complicated by their drinking habits. They never took breaks. They both drank heavily all their lives and neither lived very long. Both died in their early 60s and I'm amazed that they made it that far.

I've taken time off. Once for over 10 years when my first son was born, once again after a short stint while I was going thru the separation and divorce from my ex wife. I moved away after the boys were able to look after themselves and had another short stint with drinking when I got settled where I am now about 10 years ago but have since sobered up and have been alcohol free for just about 9 years now and have no intentions of ever using alcohol again. I think I've finally come to the conclusion that it's not a good thing for me and I'm positive that I do not have the desire for it. I'm going through some really hard life things right now and have been for some time now but under no circumstances have I had the urge to turn to my old friend for comfort and I fully believe that if it was going to relapse and present itself as a crutch it would have happened by now for certain. So at least I don't have that issue to compound the current issue but I do still use my comfort foods a lot. Pretty much daily.

My most recent ex girlfriend labeled me with the term ""excessive"" when it comes to describing my personality so if that is any indicator as to how much sugary foods I consume, I'm sure you get the idea of the problem I'm having. Although it's probably less unhealthy than drinking considering that I don't black out and do stupid dangerous things when I eat an entire quart of ice cream, half a package of Oreos, or a half pound of chocolate 5 layer cake with chocolate frosting or 2 king size candy bars.

In any case, soda is still by far the single most sugary thing I consume. I have also found myself drinking a lot of Monster energy drinks. Most of the stores around have buy 2 get one free on the large cans and I go for it probably a couple times a week so 6 or 9 of them a week sometimes however not every week. Some weeks I won't get any at all but it's still a factor.

I've been feeling some less than desirable things going on with my physical being lately and I've been thinking a lot about my health considering my age and background and I'm consciously thinking about making some changes in my diet. I realize that the damage has already been done and that that there's little chance of repairing it and that it's more than likely too little too late but I'm of the mindset that it's never too late to at least try to minimize further abuse however I have no desire to go all commando style on my diet.

I enjoy being a carnivorous eater. I love meat and I don't feel right if I don't eat beef more than others but I also enjoy pork, chicken and other foul, and seafood, especially shrimp and white fishes. My favorites are top sirloin steak, burgers, bison burgers, any shrimp dish, scallops, lobster, haddock, pollack, Atlantic salmon, boneless pork loin chops, ham, chicken breast, but I also enjoy many other meats and meat based products, cold cuts, cheeses, dairy products in general, and yes, highly sweetened cereals with milk, chocolate milk, and generally all foods that are considered in some way unreality and if I don't get my fill of them I become what I've heard described as ""hypoglycemic"".

I've done some research into several of these modern alternative diets and other health conscious ways of living and I'm certain that I just won't be able to make any of them work and I'm also not about to put my system into shock and not enjoy eating, especially given that I have many stressor effecting my life presently AND the fact that all forms of healthy eating as well as all other forms of living healthy are just plain more expensive. Period. And often much more expensive.

So what the hell is a poor man to do? This society is not right. In fact it's quite horrible in many ways. Part of me wants to try to take care of myself better but the other part is like, ""what the hell for?"" because things are so messed up lately that that part of me wants to just get it over with and get the hell out of this god forsaken life!

Integrity? Honesty? Trust? Common decency among people? Compassion? Loyalty? Values? Morals? What the hell are those any more and where did they go? What the hell is wrong with us? Why is it so difficult to be a decent person anymore? Because when I come from, it wasn't. It was actually petty damn easy and although I still choose to practice such things, it's often difficult to even do this because it seems to be shunned by the masses of whatever people are these days and I'm finding myself more often than not bewildered at how people act when I'm simply trying to be a decent guy!

Anyway, enough about that. I started this post to ask others what they have found to quench the thirst and taste good that might not be so damn unhealthy. If anything exists. A few things I've tried that don't work are flavored sparkling waters, juices in the amounts that I drink MD, a few of the Stevia based sodas, non alcoholic beer, and yes, water. /

I feel pretty doomed here and may just be but I figured that it can't hurt to appeal to the public for any advise you may have on ways I can eat and drink at least a little better without compromising my ability to enjoy what I do consume. My biggest issue is that I'm always thirsty and usually hungry. I will admit that I am kind of an excessive consumer in this sense and realize that it's going to be difficult to make any significant changes but I really don't want to accelerate the duration of time I have left because despite the seemingly overwhelming amount of degradation of society, I do still have faith in humanity, albeit a dying breed of the decent subjects...

1jvmfea,https://www.reddit.com/r/SantaMuerte/comments/1jvmfea/im_so_scared_please_help/,I’m so scared please help,"I've been devoted to Santa Muerte for a little over a year now. When I started, I was living alone in a single-bedroom apartment and had a beautiful altar space where I made daily offerings and prayers. However, about two months ago, I moved back into my parents' house to save money for an upcoming out-of-state move. Since my parents are extremely religious and anti-Santa Muerte, I had to take down my altar.

I brought a few small items with me, including a pocket-sized black statue, a 6-inch multi-color statue, and a Santa Muerte rosary stored in an Aztec-style coffee bag. I would occasionally take them out in secret to light a candle, pray, and leave small offerings before packing them back up and storing them in a secret place in my room.

Today, my stepdad found my bag with all of Santa Muerte's things and flipped out. He ridiculed me for praying to ""something so dark"" and warned me about the consequences of my actions. He even threatened to burn the statues and made disrespectful comments about Santa Muerte, carelessly waving the statue around to the point where her scythe almost fell out.

I had to take my bag and stash it in a spot next to a creek by my house. Now, I'm scared for my stepdad's safety, and I don't know what to do.

The machine needs to support coffee aficionados yet be intuitive to use and easy to maintain.

I like that the xbloom has a genius pod situation and looks super fun to use.

Ratio 6 that you can use with the glass carafe looks great, I love the single button.

Aiden might be too complex but I’m throwing it out here bc I I love the brand and the reviews have been great.

Ratio 8 is the only machine I can find that has zero plastic and that is a plus for me.

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please.** I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. Major bonus points for people who know themselves and what they seek and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* On that, **being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** We're in a digital realm of words and cognitive interaction. Needing me right by your side to be able to bond with me, while that may be very nice, is unlikely to go further than a brief encounter. The physical is a later goal of what we create together here without needing it.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",1,1744248632.0,Needafriend,1,1.0,False

What started as myself and a friend wanting to improve our cardio and get fit for the summer, has now been growing to an awesome group of 12 of us that continue to show up every Sunday. We are now on our fourth weekend run and want to encourage everyone to come out and get a run with us! We also have a WhatsApp group with over 40 members now where we talk about our run accomplishments and share routes with other members.

1jvma6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestBuyBotanicals/comments/1jvma6q/whats_the_best_way_to_take_kratom_tea_capsules/,"What’s the best way to take kratom (tea, capsules, toss-and-wash, extracts)?","# 🌿 1. Toss and Wash

**Description:** The fastest and most direct method. You place a spoonful of kratom powder in your mouth and quickly wash it down with water or juice.

# 🔧 How to Do It:

1. Measure your dose (usually 1–5 grams for beginners).
2. Place the powder on your tongue.
3. Chase immediately with water, juice, or a flavored drink.
4. Swish and swallow.

# ✅ Pros:

* **Fast onset:** Effects can kick in within 10–20 minutes.
* **No need for prep time.**
* **More potent:** You get the full alkaloid content with nothing lost to steeping or caps.

# ❌ Cons:

* **Taste is very bitter**—and the texture is gritty.
* **Can cause nausea** in some people, especially on an empty stomach.
* Not ideal for beginners unless you’re okay with strong flavors.

# 💡 Tips:

* Try using orange juice or chocolate milk as a chaser to mask the taste.
* Start with small doses if you're not used to it—it can hit hard.

# 💊 2. Capsules

**Description:** Kratom powder is enclosed in gelatin or vegan capsules, typically 500–1000 mg each.

# 🔧 How to Use:

* Take capsules with a full glass of water.
* Wait for effects—it takes longer than powder.

# ✅ Pros:

* **No taste at all**—perfect for those who can’t stand kratom’s bitterness.
* **Very convenient**—easy to carry and dose.
* **Precise dosing**—each cap has a known amount.

# ❌ Cons:

* **Slow onset:** It can take 45 minutes to 1.5 hours for effects to kick in.
* You need **a lot of capsules** for a full dose (e.g., 8-10 capsules for 4g).
* **Slightly reduced potency** due to slower digestion.

# 💡 Tips:

* Take on a light stomach for faster effects.
* Buy from a trusted source—capsule quality and content can vary.

# 🍵 3. Kratom Tea

**Description:** Kratom powder or crushed leaves are simmered in water to extract the alkaloids, then strained and consumed.

# 🔧 How to Make It:

1. Simmer (not boil) 2–5 grams of kratom in water for 15–20 minutes.
2. Add lemon juice to help extract alkaloids.
3. Strain using a coffee filter or cheesecloth.
4. Add honey or ginger to improve taste.

# ✅ Pros:

* **Easier on the stomach** than raw powder.
* **Can be sipped gradually** for a smoother onset.
* **Ritualistic**—some people enjoy the preparation and flavor when done right.

# ❌ Cons:

* **Takes time to make.**
* **Bitter taste still present**, though less gritty.
* Some alkaloids may be lost if boiled too hot.

# 💡 Tips:

* Don’t boil too aggressively; keep it at a low simmer.
* Freeze leftover tea in ice cubes for quick future use.
* Mix with herbal teas (e.g., chamomile) for flavor and added effects.

# 💧 4. Extracts and Tinctures

**Description:** Highly concentrated kratom in liquid or resin form. These are standardized (or semi-standardized) for potency.

# 🔧 How to Use:

* Take a dropperful of tincture or a small scoop of extract.
* Mix into a drink or place directly under the tongue.

# ✅ Pros:

* **Extremely potent**—a little goes a long way.
* **Fast onset**, often within 10–15 minutes.
* **Small volume**—good for travel or discreet use.

# ❌ Cons:

* **Expensive.**
* **Easy to build tolerance** if used frequently.
* **Not always labeled clearly**—some products are inconsistent.

# 💡 Tips:

* Save for days you need strong, quick relief (e.g., pain or fatigue).
* Use extracts sparingly to avoid tolerance spikes.
* Stick to brands that provide lab results and alkaloid content.

# 🔄 Comparison Summary

|Method|Onset Time|Taste|Potency|Convenience|Cost|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Toss & Wash|10–20 min|😖 Bad|🔥 Strong|✅ Easy|💲 Low|

|Tea|30–45 min|😬 Bitter|🙂 Moderate|🧘‍♂️ Ritualistic|💲 Low|
|Extracts/Tinctures|10–15 min|😊 OK|🚀 Very Strong|✅ Easy|💲💲💲 High|

# ⭐ Final Thoughts: Which is Best?

* **Best for beginners:** Capsules (easy to dose, no taste)
* **Best for fast effects:** Toss-and-wash or extract
* **Best for taste-sensitive users:** Capsules or tinctures
* **Best for sensitive stomachs:** Tea
* **Best for experienced users:** Toss-and-wash or extracts

1jvm9tk,https://www.reddit.com/r/lookingforfriendship/comments/1jvm9tk/34m_longing_for_intense_and_deep_connection_and/,[34/M] - Longing for intense and deep connection and seeking the casual chat that leads to it,"Hello!

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please.** I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. Major bonus points for people who know themselves and what they seek and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* On that, **being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** We're in a digital realm of words and cognitive interaction. Needing me right by your side to be able to bond with me, while that may be very nice, is unlikely to go further than a brief encounter. The physical is a later goal of what we create together here without needing it.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",1,1744248444.0,lookingforfriendship,0,1.0,False

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please.** I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.

I'm obviously proud of that, but I would like to be losing more than a pound a week. I was hoping for any tips or tricks? I usually don't have breakfast (just not hungry in the mornings), a lunch that's 300 or less cals, and whatever I want for dinner. I try to be mindful of my portion for dinner. Occasionally, I'll have a ""treat"" like a 100 cal dessert, coffee, or protein smoothie. I rarely drink alcohol and mostly drink water except for when I have a fun drink as a treat. I've also been working out recently. I'm trying to go a bit slower so I don't get overwhelmed and give up which has been a huge help. I plan on working out an additional day, drinking more water (which I am terrible at), and cutting down on the occasional treat so they're more rare. I say I have a treat 3x a week and I'd prefer to do it 1-2x. Is there anything else I can do that could help? Right now, I'm losing 1 lb a week, but I'm hoping to lose 1 1/2-2 lbs a week.

1jvm2du,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jvm2du/gods_least_favorite_part_1/,God's Least Favorite: Part 1,"I think for most of my life, I’ve held strong in my belief that the majority of people have more goodness within them to give to the world and to others than they do evil. In spite of everything I have endured over the course of the last few months, I think I still believe this. I have felt enough souls in my life to know that warmth and compassion and love are the true colors of humanity. Though I have only been fortunate enough to have experienced such positive qualities firsthand from a single other person, knowing that most people are sincerely good fills me with hope and leaves me envious of the rest of you. I am crestfallen by the knowledge that I truly have nothing positive, or of worth, to give back to others. My light has been taken from me, and I am no longer one of the majority.

This is not an admission of guilt, but an explanation of intent. People will think that I’m a monster for what I’m about to do. I believe I am; but rest assured, the person I am going to do it to is a *million* times worse than me. I do not believe there is any chance I can get away with this, so I want my accounting of the events leading up to this crime to be publicly available. This won’t absolve me, morally nor legally, but maybe at least a few people will be convinced to not write me off completely as a human being. Maybe someday, if ever they let me out, I can find the colors of humanity in myself once more. I really hope so.

I was born with a soul too big for my body. To be specific, my soul extends about five-to-six feet out from me in all directions; up, down, and all around. Imagine it like a big metaphysical globe with my head at the center of it. Now, it’s probably a reasonable assumption that nobody who reads this (who hasn’t already discarded it as the manifesto of a madwoman) will have any idea what I’m talking about. That’s okay, I’ll do my best to explain.

Every person has a soul; the incorporeal summation of their thoughts, experiences, memories, values and interests. Put more simply, your consciousness. Described even simpler than that, your *you*. It exists in the very center of your brain, immaterial of the spongey gray matter around it, yet tied from it inseparably. For the vast majority of people, it’s about as big as a marble.  Sometimes smaller, sometimes a smidge bigger.  The largest soul I’ve ever felt was about the size of a superball. Mine is an exercise ball, quintupled.

But what, I imagine you’re asking, does this mean exactly?  Well, your soul is supposed to exist fully within your own mind for a reason: It limits the breadth of your experience down to only the senses of your body. Your soul isn’t supposed to come in contact with anything outside of you. If it’s everything you experience, you will experience everything it touches; including other souls.

When Momma was pregnant with me, everything seemed to be going well at first. When the ultrasound technician told my parents they were going to have a little girl, they were elated. Of course, they would have loved me no matter who I would’ve been, but the two of them had both been hoping their first would be a daughter. Momma had a lot of precious childhood things she’d been hoping to pass down to me, and Daddy wanted the experience of being a strong protector for his little princess. Things seemed to be going better than they could have dreamed.

Shortly after the start of the third trimester, my soul formed, and the illusion of their perfect pregnancy was shattered. My mother woke up from a good dream turned sour, as her mind was filled with static and abstract shapes… my developing brain’s earliest semblance of thoughts. In addition, she could literally feel everything in the room around her. She felt my soul, and my soul felt as far as it extended.

My father, upon waking up, realized he felt the same way she did; but when he got up and left the room in a rush to call 911, it stopped. For him, at least. My mother kept screaming from the bedroom as she non-consensually sponged up the world around her. For me, it would’ve been normal: the first stages of experience. For her, it would have been hellish: living a whole life knowing only that which her body experienced, to suddenly wake up feeling everything around her all at once. I was the metaphysical jumper cable, hooking her senses up to the car-battery of the world. Through an inseparable proximity to me, she experienced reality times a thousand.

She was rushed to the hospital via ambulance; the EMT’s in the back themselves experiencing the same experiential terrors she was. All medical experts who examined her had no idea what was happening; but none of them had made the conclusion that it had anything to do with me. Why would they? All they could deduce was that walking too close to her seemed to cause an intense absorption of all possible stimuli in the immediate: Nothing about that inherently suggested I was the cause. In fact, though her vitals were constantly elevated and they had to sedate her to sleep every night for the duration of her stay, the pregnancy itself seemed completely normal. I seemed completely normal.

Momma remained hospitalized, all the way up to giving birth to me. As I came into the world, she and the medical staff on hand had to work through my experience of exiting the birth canal and seeing the confusing world with my own eyes for the first time. All at once, the truth was illuminated; I had been the cause the whole time.

I was held in the hospital for close to a week, as all sorts of tests were ran on me to evaluate the state of my health. I was given a CT scan and hooked up to an EEG to try to find *any* abnormalities in my body that could be the source of my condition. Eventually they accepted that I was a normal, healthy baby girl, who standing next to happened to cause one to feel the world in a way they otherwise wouldn’t. I didn’t seem to be in any sort of discomfort myself, so reluctantly, the doctors in the pediatric ward agreed to allow me to be discharged.

I was taken home by ambulance. The nurse in the back hurriedly passed me off to the arms of my daddy, who hurriedly laid me down in my crib. He only came into my room periodically to change my diapers, and to feed me baby formula from a bottle. Momma wanted nothing to do with me for a very long time; the time she had spent unable to escape the reach of my soul had been one of the most traumatic periods of her life. I don’t blame her, but throughout my childhood, she was never very affectionate to me.

Neither of my parents ever could stand very close to me for very long. Our dinner table was almost comically too big for our dining room; with them sitting on one end and me all the way over on the other. They would take care of me, but from a distance. It didn’t take me long to learn that I wasn’t supposed to get too close to them. I wanted to, I craved deeper interaction with my parents in the way all children do. Nonetheless, I just sort of accepted that things were as things were, and that was that. I didn’t have any reason to believe that our relationship was in some way abnormal; it was just how I’d always known the world to be.

I was homeschooled to the best of my parents’ abilities until fourth grade. They were trying to keep me away from other kids and teachers, but eventually it became too much for them to handle, and they realized the quality of my education wasn’t sufficiently what I’d need to succeed in life. They enrolled me in the district’s elementary school, where I began my educational career of being avoided by everyone in all my classes. I was usually sat alone, in the back corner of the room, where my soul couldn’t reach the next nearest student. I guess it could’ve been worse. Nobody ever bullied me. Everyone pretended I didn’t exist.

I don’t have many memorable interactions with any of my peers, to be honest. There is this one time that stands out in my mind as clearly to me now as when it happened: I had arrived to class late and a group of three girls were talking about me, thinking that I was out sick for the day. I didn’t hear the start of the conversation.

“-like Chloe, or whatever?”

“CHLOE!” One of them said in an exaggerated, mocking tone. “That bitch is a fucking cold-spot in every room she enters. It’s better when she’s out sick. We can walk around the classroom normally without having to avoid the area near the sink.”

The third girl looked past them and saw me standing there, her face going pale. The other two caught her gaze and turned to face me. We stared at each other in silence for several seconds, before I quietly took my seat. I made sure to pass right by their group so all three of them were forced to feel the tears I was holding back.

Mostly though, my time in school was uneventful. I distracted myself from loneliness by throwing myself into podcasts and video games. They gave me some semblance of simulated interaction with others. It wasn’t until I was older, at about my early twenties, that I started critically evaluating my life and realized all the normal experiences I’d been deprived of. Watching TV on the couch together as a family. Being tucked in to bed at night. Sleepovers. Sitting next to friends in the cafeteria. A first kiss. Having someone to dance with at Prom. Even though I understood *why* I didn’t have those things, I’d never allowed myself to realize how much I’d wanted them. It would’ve been too painful to allow myself to think about. I really wish I could’ve been hugged more.

After high school, I went off to college to pursue a four-year degree in web design. My college years were peaceful. Lonely still, but I was out on my own and that helped a lot. It’s easier to forget about how isolated you are when you don’t have to live with people who choose to avoid you. I even went to a party, if you can believe it. This one guy who I thought was kinda cute even approached me, offering me a red cup full of jungle-juice. I took it reluctantly, smiling shyly at him. He stood next to me for all of about twenty seconds, said “Anyway, it was nice talking to you.” and hurried off. I set the cup down, too dejected to enjoy it. I’d find out a few days later that he had been expelled and criminally charged for roofie’ing some poor girl and taking advantage of her.

Out of college, I had trouble finding work. It felt like everyone in my generation had been encouraged to go into IT as a career. By the time I had my degree, the field was overcrowded, save for inconsistent freelance jobs that rarely offered what they were worth. I got a job as a sales associate at a local branch of a big-chain retail company; just to pad my finances as I took the odd-jobs I could and tried to make something of my degree. Eventually, years passed with diminishing returns, and I inevitably stopped searching for opportunities to put my degree to use. I took on $50,000 worth of college debt, to become a retail associate. I had no friends, my attempts at a dating life had all fallen through as nobody could physically stand to be around me. At least customers left me alone; approaching me to ask a question, before stopping, then going to find a different employee. It allowed me to work in silence.

When I was about 27, we got a new girl on my team. She’d just turned 18 and this was her first job. At this point, I’d been at the store for about five years and was thoroughly familiar with the bullshit that came standard with the industry. I’d seen how customers would often mistreat employees and many of the managers would denigrate the associates beneath their reach in acts of petty power; showing off to corporate how well they could exercise control over us. Feeling sympathetic for the new girl not knowing anyone, I quietly made it a personal undertaking of mine to watch over her. Make sure nobody gave her shit or fucked with her. I’d keep tabs on where she was assigned for the day on the schedule and would find reasons to walk by her position to try getting a read on how she was doing from a distance. I learned her name was Aaliyah, and even though I’d never spoken to her, I found myself emotionally becoming fiercely protective of her. I think I just wanted to feel contact with someone so badly, I formed a parasocial relationship with a coworker. Looking back I know it was unhealthy, but I’d taken it upon myself as my responsibility to ensure her wellbeing.

For the first three-ish, months of Aaliyah’s employment there, we never so much as spoke to each other. It didn’t take her too long to make friends with several other of our coworkers and I started worrying about her less. She had actual friends she could rely on if she needed anything. I also had less time to concern myself with her whereabouts anyway, because it was at this time my team got a new coach: Joshua Oleander.

Coach Oleander was, in seemingly all respects, a normal enough man. 34, with thinning dark hair, square glasses, a strong heavy frame with broad shoulders and thick forearms. Not that this will likely add much additional description to you, but his soul was about the size of a grape. I would become intimately aware of its exact dimensions in the months following his hiring, as he was one of the only two people I’ve ever met who could stand to be around me.

Periodically, Coach Oleander would repeatedly confront me throughout the workday; something all my previous team-leads and coaches would look for any reason to avoid doing. He had no problem walking right up to me, standing well within range of my soul, and demanding a complete rundown on what I was doing and everything I had accomplished since he had last spoken to me. This was something he did with everyone under his lead and even though he would try to present himself as friendly and ‘simply checking in’, there was an unspoken understanding that he was doing it as an intimidation tactic. Behind his frequent requests for progress updates, there was a thinly veiled threat that he was looking for any reason he could find to write someone up and have them coached if we didn’t exceed his standards. This practically doubled my workload throughout the day, as now I needed to do everything I’d already been doing, plus extra, to keep him satisfied and not breathing right down my neck.

I got three reprieves throughout the day: Two fifteen-minute paid breaks and a one-hour unpaid lunch. I basically started spending all three napping with my head down on one of the folding plastic tables in the employee lounge. I was exhausted, more mentally than physically. The added responsibility, plus worry about whether I was doing enough so as not to invoke Coach Oleander’s ire, was putting a lot of stress on me while I was at my job. Only while in my apartment, was I able to relax.

One day, while I was resting on my break, head down on the table in my arms, I felt someone pass into the range of my soul. I expected them to hesitantly move on like they normally would, but instead they lingered. I heard a metal chair scraping on linoleum, and their soul lowered as they sat down. Slowly, groggy and with five minutes still left on my last fifteen of the day, I looked up to see who it was, only to find none other than Aaliyah sitting a few feet away from me; staring intently at the break room TV.

She turned and shot me a glance, looked back at the screen briefly, then once more back to me with a smile. “Sorry. You don’t mind if I sit here, do you?”

I blinked a few times, rubbing my eyes. Her soul was the size of a gravel pebble, the kind used on unpaved roads. “Don’t you mind?”

She looked confused.

“Sitting next to me? I mean?”

“No. Why would I?”  She suddenly seemed very self-conscious. “I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to wake you up!” She said, sliding her chair back and leaning forward to stand.

“No!” I probably sounded desperate. “No, it’s okay! I’m just not used to people sitting next to me is all. Or talking.”

“Oh… Well, I’m Aaliyah.” She said.

I knew, of course, but pretended like I was just finding out. “Hi. I’m Chloe.”

“It’s nice to meet you! I’ve seen you around the store for a few months, but’ve never really gotten a chance to talk to you yet.”

“Same. Same.”

We both watched the TV playing re-runs of Deal or No Deal. It was always on in the breakroom. The show absolutely pissed me off to watch because I would’ve absolutely taken the first offer made to me every time that was anywhere over $50,000. In that moment however, the show wasn’t really what was on my mind. I was trying to think of something else to say to keep the conversation flowing, when my phone alarm started going off. My break was over.

“I’ve gotta get back to work.” I said, standing up and pulling on my work vest.

“Okay. See you around…”

“Chloe.”

“Chloe. Sorry! I’m bad with names!”

“It’s alright.”

As I turned to walk away, she said something else that caught me off guard.

“I don’t know why people wouldn’t talk to you all that much, something about you is kinda comforting.”

“Oh yeah?”

“Yeah. Kinda like a space heater. You’re like a warm spot in the room.”

The rest of my shift, my head was in the clouds. I didn’t even really mind when Coach Oleander chewed me out for not zoning all the aisles he had assigned to me before the end of the day. Looking back, this was the catalyst that led to things playing out the way they did.

Aaliyah and I worked together two more times that week. The very next day, and two days after that. Both days when I was on my breaks, she would come in and sit next to me so we could talk for a bit. The first time it happened I thought it was a coincidence. After the second and third times, I realized she was deliberately waiting for me to go on my breaks before she would take hers. We started growing closer and at the end of our third shift where we talked that week, we exchanged Insta’s. Every once in awhile while off work then, one of us would send the other some new stupid meme we’d seen.

For the time, things felt like they were looking up for me. Yeah, I still worked a shitty job I hated where I was barely scraping by on rent, groceries and college payments. I didn’t mind though, because for the first time ever, I’d found a friend I could connect with who wasn’t bothered by being around me. Sure, I’d had internet friends before on Discord and Twitter, but never anyone I felt *that* close with or could hang out with in person. The age gap between me and Aaliyah was almost ten years exactly so we weren’t ever going to do something outside of work, but while there we got along great together, talked about life, gossiped about coworkers and complained about our team-leads and coaches. We had each other’s backs, and she knew if she had any issues with anyone, she need only let me know.

She did, as a matter of fact. One shift, about two months after our friendship really started, she came to me shaken up and on the verge of tears. Some customers, two older men in their fifties (one with a soul the size of a of a pea) had come into the aisle she had been working in and said some degrading and misogynistic shit to her. She told me, on the verge of tears how one had asked her for help finding something she didn’t know the location of and the other started making comments about her chest when she didn’t know how to help them. I won’t repeat exactly what she told me they said, but it was several things between the two of them and I was absolutely fucking livid.

I stormed over into the aisle she had been working in, right up to the two men; both of whom seemed bemused by my approach at first until my soul collided with theirs. The nausea hit them almost instantly as they were sensationally hooked up to their surroundings, and they could feel the fury radiating off me into them. Even still, the one with the pea-soul managed to get out “Uh-oh, she brought back up.” In a dismissive tone.

“Excuse me gentlemen.” I said, my voice was ice. “My coworker told me you said some inappropriate things to her?”

“Are you a manager?” The one with the normal soul asked.

“No. Did you say something inappropriate to a minor?” Of course, Aaliyah wasn’t a minor, but she looked young enough and I wanted to see if they’d show any remorse or repulsion towards their actions if they believed the person they were harassing was underage.

Instead, he simply responded: “If you’re not a manager, leave us alone.” The other one took a few steps away from me and I closed the distance. The effects of standing so close to me were really starting to affect him.

“I don’t think we need to bring a manager into this. I think you two can settle this with me like men.”

At this jab, the one with the pea-soul snapped. “Lady, fuck off and leave us alone, before we *make* you get a manager!”

The rage that had been burning in my heart reached a peak, before igniting into a cold flame that chilled my blood. “Aaliyah, get back.” I said. She hesitated. I could feel her soul, still a few feet behind me. “NOW.” I said forcefully, and she complied. When she was out of the range of what I could feel, I reached into my pocket and pulled out my cigarette lighter, took two steps towards the men for good measure, and flicked it alight.

The full sensation of the burn rushed through my soul and into both of theirs. To me it was nothing I hadn’t felt ten thousand times before in my life, every time I stood next to a candle or lit up a smoke. To them, it was the most sudden and intensely overwhelming sensation of their lives. The one with the pea-soul immediately fell to the floor in a violent seizure, mouth frothing down the side of his face and into his hair. The other one screamed and covered his ears before scratching at the side of his head, bent over and emptied the contents of his stomach onto the floor. I stood over them both, lighter in hand, forcing them to feel it for several long, grueling seconds before I finally clicked it off.

“I’m sorry gentlemen! Allow me to get a manager for you!” I feigned concern before turning and marching out of the aisle past Aaliyah, who stood there shocked. She had no idea what I had just done to them on her behalf. No, that’s not true. It was on my behalf. She was a very sweet girl and never would have wished that on anyone, even her harassers. I take full responsibility for that.

I didn’t at the time, of course. I told the store manager we had a medical emergency in one of the aisles and led her back to the men. She put a call-out over the radio to call an ambulance for them, and both men were taken out on stretchers. I’ll be so honest right now, I felt really bad for Vic, the maintenance guy, having to clean up all that vomit. I don’t regret doing what I did, but I still feel bad that he had to clean it up. Vic, if you ever read this and I’m somehow not dead or in prison for what I’m about to do, I owe you a favor.

The next day, I was called into the security office, where the store manager and Coach Oleander were waiting for me. They had me take a seat, before pulling up the footage of my confrontation with the men from the day before. The video didn’t have audio, but they could see Aaliyah take a few steps back, before I pulled out my lighter, flicked it on and both men dropped.

Immediately Coach Oleander went on a rant about how I was going to get us sued for what I did to them, to which I replied that I hadn’t done anything. The store manager asked me to explain what had happened, and I told her all about what they had said to Aaliyah. I told her I was intervening on her behalf and had been trying to resolve things amicably. One of the men had started shouting at me and I had started fidgeting with my lighter; a nervous habit formed from years of smoking. Then, for some reason, one man collapsed, and the other started puking and it was just so *shocking* and *unexpected* I *froze*, before regaining the sense of mind to run for help.

The store manager leaned back in her chair, rubbing her chin consideringly. As far as she could tell, I hadn’t done anything wrong, even if she was visibly nauseous and uncomfortable from being so close to me… A discomfort Coach Oleander noticeably didn’t share. Eventually, she told me I was wrong for having gone to confront the customers on my own and that company policy clearly stated I should’ve known to seek out a team-lead or coach to deal with it. I was getting a write-up, and Coach Oleander was going to have to check in with me more frequently.

I left the security office feeling relieved. All things considered, I had gotten off very light, for doing something that, for all I’d known, could’ve killed two people. Granted, the world wouldn’t have lost anything if they had died, but still… In that moment, I felt lucky.

I couldn’t have been more wrong.

Coach Oleander started finding reasons to heckle me throughout the day. He’d find ‘imperfections’ on the shelves I’d organized, before making me do them all over again. During team meetings, he’d make a show of individually praising the work of everyone else beneath him, except for me. He’d start making offhand remarks in passing when I messed something up, calling me a ‘dumbass’ or telling me to ‘Get (my) shit together!’. I raised my concern about this to the store manager, who had me write an incident report and told me she’d follow through on discussing it with him. Nothing ever came of it. In retrospect, these should’ve been the first serious red-flags that I wasn’t safe there, but I was struggling to make rent and still deep in student loans. I tolerated it, but only, I told myself, until I could find somewhere else to work that would match my pay. Unfortunately, I made $2.00 over the minimum wage and not a lot of positions I was qualified for were willing to meet me there; much less places that were even hiring.

I would rant about my frustrations with how management was treating me to Aaliyah through texts and voice memos after work. She was sympathetic and always willing to lend me an eager ear, but there wasn’t anything she could really do. Just having someone to vent to was cathartic, but it didn’t alleviate the stress I felt at work that had already been mounting before then. Not only that, but Aaliyah had become more apprehensive around me since the incident with the two men. She had been there and knew for certain I had done *something* to them but had no idea what that might’ve been. I didn’t know how to go about explaining it to her, it’s already taken me this long to explain it to you. Plus, I didn’t know what she’d think of me if she knew what I was capable of. I’d decided it was best to just keep it to myself

One day, while at work, I was stocking as per usual, in the condiment’s aisle. Coach Oleander came up behind me while I was on the ladder of the stocking cart, one ear bud in, listening to music as everyone did while working there.

“Chloe. How’s it coming along?” He spoke unexpectedly, a hostile tone to his voice that made me jump; clutch the railing of the cart with one hand and accidentally knock a jar of pickles off the shelf with the other. My heart dropped through my guts as I watched the jar fall, and I tensed up as my soul felt it explode on the ground in a spray of glass and juice that speckled the floor.

“I’m so sorry, Coach! I- I didn’t hear you come up behind me!” My heart was racing from the adrenaline rush of the whole situation.

“Then maybe you shouldn’t have an AirPod in while you work.” He said, as if he hadn’t knowingly come right up behind me and startled me on purpose. I could feel the glee in his soul and he could feel the panic in mine. I knew. He knew I knew. He also knew I knew there was nothing I could say to him about it.

“Yes Coach…”

“Take it out.”

“What?”

“You said ‘yes Coach’. Take the AirPod out of your ear.”

I didn’t object or point out the hypocrisy of everyone else being allowed to have one in. Silently, I complied.

Oleander was studying me like he’d had some sort of realization. It was like something in his head had clicked, and he finally understood the context of what everyone experienced while standing close to me. He grinned. “Good.” He looked down and nudged the broken glass and juice and pickle spears with his shoe. “Don’t you think you should clean this up?”

“Y- Yes Coach…” I said, stepping down off the stocking cart and making for where we kept the brooms and bags of spill absorbent powder in the back.

“I’ll stand by this mess until you get back.”

As I cleaned it up, I could feel his eyes on the back of my head, unblinking. Every time I moved out of the range of his soul, he would step back into the boundaries of mine. He reminded me of an animal stalking its prey and I could feel his enjoyment of my anxiety being reflected back at him. I avoided him for the rest of my shift, refusing to be near him if somebody else wasn’t around.

“Are you okay?” Aaliyah asked me a day later during our lunch break. “You seem upset by something.”

“I’m fine…”

“You haven’t touched your ramen at all. That’s not like you.”

I looked down at my Styrofoam cup of instant noodles and stirred them with the plastic fork disinterestedly. “I guess I just haven’t felt great recently.” I knew Aaliyah could feel that something was troubling me deeply. I could feel her concern.

“Okay… Let me know if you need anything?”

“I will.”

Nothing serious of note happened again until a few days later. It was early in the morning at the start of my shift, when Coach Oleander came into my aisle and walked up to me, holding two coffee cups.

“Good morning, Chloe!” He said, offering one out to me. I eyed it with great caution, able to sense the boiling liquid within.

“Good morning, Coach… I’m sorry, I’m not feeling well this morning.”

“Well, maybe this’ll help perk you up?”

“I don’t really like caffeine. I’m sorry.”

“No. Don’t apologize. It’s good.” He said, but I could see the anger veiled behind his eyes. “I trust you’ll be able to work fast without it then?”

“Yes Coach.”

“Good.” Just as he was walking away from me, he crushed the paper cup meant for me. The boiling coffee gushed out and spilled over his left hand; instantly turning the flesh a dark shade of red and causing blisters to bubble and pop wherever it ran.

I inhaled sharply and grabbed the back of my left hand, rubbing it aggressively and leaning as far back from him as I could. It wasn’t enough.

“Ow! Damn! My bad!” Coach Oleander exclaimed, not at all sounding like he was bothered by the pain. “I’m sorry! I accidentally made a mess next to where you were working!”

I could still feel the sting of sizzling dermis peeling away from the back of his hand. I blinked back tears, stepped down off my cart and walked to the other side of the aisle.

“Chloe? Where are you going? Your cart’s right here!” I did my best to pay him no mind. He walked right past me and the dull, aching sensation returned to my hand as he did so. “Don’t worry! I made the mess, I’ll clean it up. Be right back!”

If the pickle jar was the moment when the seeds of cruelty were planted in his head, the coffee was the first moment where they truly began to bear fruit. I was never quite able to tell if Coach Oleander was motivated by sadism towards me, selfish masochism towards himself, or some combination of the two. Whatever the reason, from then on, once every two or three days, harm would ‘unluckily’ befall him in my presence: forcing his suffering through me and magnifying it back onto him. Once he opened a box with his razor, and the blade ‘slipped’ and cut right through the webbing between the base of his middle and index fingers. Another time, after I had just finished unloading the pallets from the day’s truck, he walked up beside me and gripped his right fist closed into a sewing needle, piercing nearly all-the-way through his palm. I started becoming emotionally despondent while at work, dissociating as soon as I walked through the front door every morning.

Aaliyah texted me less and less, asking me what was going on and why I always seemed so worn out at work. I didn’t give her an answer. I didn’t really have one that would’ve made sense. She stopped going out of her way to line up her breaks with mine, and I went back to sleeping through them again. Attempting to, at least. Once, while my head was down in my arms, I could feel Coach Oleander’s soul come up behind me and just stand there. My heart started racing and I felt like I was on the verge of a panic attack. He stood there for close to a minute, soaking in my growing anxiety, before finally walking away. Even on my breaks, I wasn’t safe.

I tripled down on trying to find a new place of employment. Anywhere that would take me as quickly as possible. I wish I could say I gave it my best effort; I can say it was the best effort I had in me to give. Most of my days off were spent emotionally recovering. I felt sick a lot. I was always tired, no matter how much I slept. I felt hopeless about my current situation and always terrified in the knowledge that I would have to inevitably return to it again the next day. The fear I felt was omnipresent.

I struggled through this for about a month, before something different happened. Coach Oleander called a team meeting early one morning, did his usual round of thanking everyone else for all the work they had done. This time, however, he ended it off by thanking me for ‘being a good team player’. Everyone’s clapping and his sickening smile felt like salt being rubbed in the wound. Before he dismissed everyone back to work, he told us he would be running to the pet store during our lunch today to get roaches for his bearded dragon, and that we shouldn’t expect to get ahold of him for about an hour if we needed anything.

The day had been going well. At least, better than most. Oleander didn’t really bother me all that much, only once stopped at the end of my aisle to ask me how things were coming along. I told him “Great.” With as much confidence and enthusiasm as I could muster. He simply gave me a thumbs up and kept moving on.

Aaliyah hadn’t been scheduled that day and I’d felt bad about being so distant. I decided to sit out in front of the building during my lunch and call her, just to see how she was doing. The late spring was turning into a beautiful early summer, with lush trees blowing in the cool Virginian breeze; casting harsh shadows in the light of the sun that bloomed in the sky like a dandelion. Out front, I ate my ramen and laughed on the phone with her as she told me about the colleges she was applying to and how her parents were obsessed with their fear that she would end up going to a ‘party school’. About three-fourths of the way through my lunch, Coach Oleander passed me on his way back into the building. I couldn’t help but notice he was carrying a box-shaped bag with the Petco logo on the side.

Our store was doing inventory at the time. As someone who had been there for the last five years, the management team entrusted me with handling the on-hand count in the technology closet where we kept the extra computers, tablets, phones, etc. Obviously, this was one of those areas that only Coaches and the Store Manager herself had access to on a regular basis, because it was a high risk for theft. I had to be let in by one of the coaches, who gave me a TC and had me get to work.

It was pretty easy, if not monotonous. All I had to do was scan every single UPC in the room once so there would be an accurate count in our system of exactly how many of each item there was inside. The space itself was just a bit bigger than my apartment bathroom, but all the walls were lined with shelves, each packed with hundreds of boxes; each box I had to not only scan, but make sure I only scanned once. I put on a podcast and fell into a routine of starting at the top of one section, slowly scanning my way down to the bottom, and moving on to the next.

When I was about halfway done… you guessed it. My blood went cold as I felt Coach Oleander’s soul block the way out behind me. I kept my back to him, kept scanning and hoped he would just leave me alone.

“Hey Chloe. How’s it going?” He asked.

“Good.” I said meekly, wanting him to please just go away and let me work.

“That’s good. That’s real good…” His breathing was heavy and I could sense his heartrate was going wild. Whatever he was about to do, it was something he hadn’t done before. “I need you to be *extra* thorough today. Understand?”

I nodded.

“Do you understand, Chloe?”

“Yes Coach…”

At this, he stepped fully into the closet with me. I started to panic as he closed the distance and I quickly realizing he’d brought something else with him that I, in my shaking anxiety, had overlooked before. There was a second soul with him. A very small one…

I turned around now, staring dead into his eyes. They looked hollow. He was staring at me, but in that moment, I wouldn’t have guessed there was anything at all behind them if I hadn’t been able to feel it for myself.

“You’re doing great, Chloe.”

“W- What are you doing?” I asked, voice shaking.

“I’m just checking in with one of my associates.” He said, his hand reaching into his coat pocket and wrapping loosely around the hamster he had within. “Is that not allowed?”

“Please don’t…”

“Don’t what?” His fingers began to tighten into a grip. I felt the hamster squirm and struggle.

“Stop!”

“Chloe, keep your voice down! You’re freaking me out!” He said, fist completely balled around the poor rodent. I felt its teeth sink into his flesh and the flavor of his blood filling its mouth. I felt its little bones snap and its organs collapse as he crushed it to death. I felt its final few seconds as it clung to a life that I also felt fade from its body. I experienced everything the hamster did, and I wanted to scream.

Tears ran down my cheeks and I felt like I was broken. Coach Oleander basked in the experience before turning and walking towards the door.

“Get back to work.”

I reached into my pocket and pulled out the lighter. I took a step towards him and flicked it on, hoping to anything above that I could kill him with a seizure right then and there. Instead, he stopped, soaked in the feeling of the flame, turned around with a friendly smile, and said: “No smoking indoors.”",1,1744247791.0,nosleep,0,0.6,False

1jvm0ib,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jvm0ib/grinder_upgrade_5001000/,Grinder Upgrade [£500-1000],"Location: Philippines (and the UK)
Drink preference: dark roast espresso, americano 10-20 shots during the week. Milk-based at the weekend. 
Space: Apartment kitchen, so tightish but coffee = life. 
Experience: 5yrs BBE, single dose, airspace for bean freshness. 
Machine: I need to move to a separate electric grinder. I will eventually get a profitec dual boiler 
Candidates: Niche Zero or Duo, Eureka Mignon, Libra et al. 

Coffee equipment is pricey in PH, so I’m ready to upgrade my equipment while in the uk. I seem to prefer the dark rich mouthfeel shots over lighter roasts but that may well be due to my terrible grinder in the breville barista express, and the lack of good medium roast being served to me in coffee shops that I have visited in Manila. 

So, grinder upgrade is priority based on reading here. Never the endgame but having a grinder to  improve the consistency of those thick dark roasts that I like would be great but also having the ability to switch burrs as my tastes develop and or experiment more successfully with the many roasters that are here would be cool. 

With this in mind, it seems the Niche Duo would be a good fit. I do, however, prefer the Eureka line in terms of classic look. Also, they just released a few new models with a better dial but a review I watched gave the motor a bit of stick in terms of quality. The Libra sees very convenient but is the weighing aspect reliable? Also, it’s something that can go wrong and be a pain to get fixed. 

I’m open to ideas. Thanks in advance for rips and tips!

1jvlypo,https://www.reddit.com/r/YouCouldLookItUp/comments/1jvlypo/politically_yours_historical_novelists/,"Politically yours, historical novelists","Before about 1980 the term 'politically correct' was in limited and somewhat neutral use, according to the OED:

“conforming to a body of liberal or radical opinion, especially on social matters, characterized by the advocacy of approved causes or views, and often by the rejection of language, behaviour, etc., considered discriminatory or offensive…” (OED) 

..but it didn’t take long for the term to become  overextended. By the late eighties, to say somebody was ‘politically correct’ (usually with a sneer) was to accuse the speaker of parroting extreme liberal views without critical thought. Whether or not that was true; the phrase was — and is — still used as a way to silence debate.

My take on this: I like to think that in most situations it’s just good common sense to avoid language that is exclusionary or biased or racist — unless I’m hoping to evoke negative reactions. There’s a good chapter about these issues in a book by Deborah Cameron called [Verbal Hygiene](https://www.routledge.com/Verbal-Hygiene/Cameron/p/book/9780415696005?srsltid=AfmBOoqyXaGa7osTnwWLv0O6EWzi2vcaSowNdhWBISJXsDvvGi6FjUGj). Great book, terrible title.

For historical novelists  this issue is especially fraught. If a story is set in Maine in 1790, in England in 1650 or Mobile in 1940, it’s usually impossible to use the right historical lexical items because your readers — the majority won't know the language history, and even those who do — would find standards of the time so disturbing that they’d come out of the narrative dream state. You can have a nasty antagonist use any kind of slur and get away with it, but it's almost impossible to have a protagonist use any of the eighteenth century terms for natives of Africa without causing real problems for your reader. Nor can you simply use modern day terms. Your choices are two: Either alienate your reader, or commit anachronism.

To use an example which is not quite so incendiary as most, consider the word *girl*. 

In today’s world, a male executive who refers to his assistant as ‘his girl’ is (a) clueless (b) insensitive (c) sexist (d) deliberately provocative or (e) all of the above. “I’ll send my girl to get us coffee.” — Now there’s a sentence you’d put in the mouth of a character you don’t much like, or want your readers to like. But what if you’re talking about the year 1898? What would it mean then, in terms of how to read the character? For most readers, the answer to that question doesn’t matter, because they can’t get beyond their initial reaction. 

The point (and I do have one) is that it’s hard to be historically and socially true to the language because your reader is stuck in her own time and place, and lacks the references she’d need to interpret. You’ll have to concentrate on other kinds of details to establish character, and keep a dictionary close to hand. 

I've got a lot of historical fiction in print, but I still hesitate when I have new characters who have to deal with these issues, and deciding what words to put in their mouths.

Problem is that I do like the amount of energy it gives me, I get more physical chores done, I think.

The bigger problem is that I think it's giving me gerd, or making it worse to where I notice it.

So I wonder if caffeine pills could be the alternative.  I know that caffeine in the coffee might relax the LES, but the other contributor to that is the acidity.

I would assume the pills don't have the acid part.  So has anyone successfully switched over to pills and kept reflux away?",2,1744247362.0,HiatalHernia,0,1.0,False

A light breeze rustled the leaves of a nearby tree, adding to the cozy atmosphere. Mini, as usual, was a bundle of energy, swinging her legs under the chair as she sipped on her iced coffee. ""Ahh, nothing beats a good café hangout! It’s nice to see you guys outside of all the drama for once."" She grinned, nudging Kazuya with her elbow. ""Right, Kazu-kun?"" Kazuya, mid-sip of his drink, nearly choked. ""Wha—drama? W-We don’t always have drama!"" Chizuru gave him a sidelong glance, raising an eyebrow. ""Really? You sure about that? ""Mini giggled. ""Ohh, burn. Chizuru-san, you’re catching on! We love a queen with a sharp tongue! ""Chizuru smiled softly, shaking her head. It was rare for her to have moments like these—just relaxing with friends. Mini’s energy was contagious, and Kazuya’s flustered reactions never failed to amuse. ""You guys are ganging up on me again,"" Kazuya whined, sinking into his chair. ""Aww, don’t be like that, Kazu-kun,"" Mini teased, giving him a playful pat on the back. ""You know we love you.""Kazuya blinked, turning a shade of pink. ""L-Love?! Wait, you mean as a friend, right?"" Mini smirked. ""Oho, I Dunno. What do *you* think, Chizuru-san?""Chizuru took a sip of her tea, completely unfazed. ""I think you’re just having fun messing with him.""Mini gasped dramatically. ""She sees right through me!"" Kazuya sighed in relief, but a small smile crept onto his face. He knew moments like this wouldn’t last forever, but for now, he was happy. Just being with them—laughing, talking, and enjoying the afternoon—was more than enough. ""Alright, alright,"" Mini said, stretching. ""How about we make this even more fun? Let’s play a game! Loser pays for dessert!""Kazuya groaned. ""Why do I feel like I’m already doomed?"" Chizuru chuckled. ""Because you probably are. ""Mini winked. ""That’s the spirit!"" And just like that, the afternoon continued, filled with laughter, teasing, and the kind of warmth only true friends could share.  Chizuru, Kazuya, and Mini sat together, their drinks in hand, the atmosphere light and easy—until Mini decided to stir the pot, as usual. Mini leaned forward, resting her chin on her hands with a mischievous glint in her eyes. ""So, you two look pretty cozy today. ""Kazuya, mid-sip of his iced coffee, choked. ""*C-Cozy?!*"" He coughed, grabbing a napkin while Chizuru calmly sipped her tea, only raising an eyebrow at Mini’s antics. ""Yeah, you know,"" Mini continued, twirling her straw. ""Like a couple just enjoying their casual date. Super romantic."" Chizuru sighed, setting her cup down. ""Mini…"" Mini grinned. ""What? I’m just saying! You guys spend so much time together, the chemistry is off the charts, and yet—"" She gestured wildly at Kazuya, who was now looking like a malfunctioning robot. ""This guy still acts like holding a normal conversation with you is a high-stakes mission.""Kazuya flailed. ""H-Hey! That’s not fair! I talk to Chizuru all the time! ""Mini gave him a deadpan look. ""Without turning red? Without stammering? ""Kazuya opened his mouth, then closed it. Then opened it again. ""Th-That’s different! It’s just… I mean, Chizuru is—""""Chizuru is…?"" Mini smirked, leaning in expectantly. ""Ughhh,"" Kazuya groaned, sinking into his chair. Chizuru, amused but clearly done with the conversation, exhaled lightly. ""Mini, drop it. ""Mini gasped dramatically. ""Oh no. I’m being silenced. *By the lead actress herself!*"" She clutched her chest. ""Fine, fine, I’ll behave… *for now. ""Kazuya* wiped his forehead. ""Phew. ""Mini side-eyed him. ""That doesn’t mean I won’t bring it up later, though."" Chizuru shook her head with a small smile, and Kazuya slumped in defeat. The moment of peace was temporary—but in the end, he didn’t mind. Not when he was spending time like this, with them. Kazuya, Chizuru, and Mini sat together, enjoying a rare moment of peace. Or, at least, they had been—until Mini decided to start teasing them about their relationship. Now, Kazuya sat awkwardly, fidgeting with the straw in his drink, still reeling from Mini’s relentless jabs. ""A-Anyway! Let’s, uh, talk about something else!""Mini chuckled but let it go for the moment, instead popping a piece of cake into her mouth. Chizuru, on the other hand, remained perfectly composed, watching Kazuya with her usual calm expression. Then, as if it were the most casual thing in the world, she said, ""You know, Kazuya… I do enjoy spending time with you.""Silence. froze, his brain short-circuiting as the words registered. *Wait. Wait, what? What did she just say?!His heart slammed against his chest, his face rapidly turning red. ""Y-Y-Y-You w-w-what?!"" He practically convulsed in his seat, hands gripping the edge of the table as if reality itself had just glitched. Mini blinked, then burst out laughing. ""Oh my god, look at his face! Kazu-kun, breathe! You look like you just got hit by a truck!"" Chizuru tilted her head slightly, lips twitching in amusement. ""What? I’m just being honest. ""Honest?!* Kazuya’s brain was now running at hyper speed, analyzing every possible meaning behind her words. \*Does she mean it platonically? Does she mean it romantically? Is this a test? Is she messing with me? No, Chizuru wouldn’t do that! But wait, she’s smiling a little—does that mean she’s enjoying watching me squirm?!\*His soul practically left his body as he clutched his chest. ""I-I mean! Uh! T-That’s… I… uh…""Mini wiped a tear from her eye. ""This is *priceless!* Dude, she just said she enjoys your company, and you’re acting like she just proposed to you.""Chizuru, watching Kazuya spiral, finally let out a small laugh. ""Relax, Kazuya. It’s not that big of a deal. ""Not *that big of a deal?!* \*Not that big of a deal?!\*Kazuya, now reduced to a broken mess, simply collapsed onto the table, face-down, as Mini continued laughing. Chizuru, still amused, took another sip of her tea, clearly satisfied with how easy he was to fluster.""You're so dramatic,"" she added. Kazuya groaned into the table. *I’m gonna die.* Mini, ever the agent of chaos, was absolutely *loving* the situation. She grinned, resting her chin on her hands. ""Alright, Kazu-kun, I’ve got a question for you.""Kazuya barely lifted his head, his expression still dazed. ""H-Huh?"" Mini smirked. ""Who’s cuter? Me or Chizuru-san?"" Chizuru blinked, caught off guard. ""Mini…""Mini waved her off. ""What? I just wanna see what he says!"" Kazuya, still half out of it, sat up, blinking rapidly. ""Wh—who’s cuter?"" Mini nodded eagerly. ""Yep! Come on, no thinking! Just say it!""For once, Kazuya didn’t hesitate. Without missing a beat, he answered with absolute conviction— ""Chizuru."" Silence. Chizuru’s eyes widened slightly, the faintest hint of pink dusting her cheeks. She hadn’t expected him to answer so quickly—so *certainly*. Mini, meanwhile, gasped dramatically, clutching her chest. ""Damn! That was fast! You didn’t even *consider* me?! Not even for a second?!"" Kazuya, now realizing what he had just said, turned beet red. ""W-W-Wait! I-I didn’t mean it like that! I mean, you’re cute too, Mini! I just—uh—Chizuru, uhh—!""Mini wagged her finger. ""No takebacks, Kazu-kun. You said it loud and clear!"" She turned to Chizuru, grinning. ""And look! She’s blushing!"" Chizuru, ever composed, crossed her arms and looked away, clearing her throat. ""I am *not* blushing.""Mini leaned in with a sly grin. ""Suuure you’re not.""Kazuya, still in a state of panic, waved his hands wildly. ""I-It’s not like that! I-I just—! I mean, Chizuru *is* beautiful, b-but I wasn’t thinking about it like—!"" Mini laughed, patting his shoulder. ""Relax, Kazu-kun. I was just messing with you."" She winked. ""But hey, that was pretty bold of you. Maybe you *do* have a spine after all."" Kazuya groaned, sinking back into his seat, while Chizuru stole a quick glance at him, still feeling the warmth in her cheeks. For once, Mini had actually caught *both* of them off guard. Mini stretched her arms over her head, grinning. ""Whew! I think I need a refill. You two lovebirds—err, *friends*—sit tight, I’ll be back in a sec."" She winked before hopping up and heading toward the café counter, leaving Kazuya and Chizuru alone. And just like that, an awkward silence settled between them.Kazuya sat frozen, his mind still looping over what had just happened. *Why did I say it so fast?! What if she thinks I’m a creep?! But she blushed—wait, did she really blush? Or am I hallucinating?* Across from him, Chizuru kept her expression neutral, but her fingers lightly tapped the side of her cup, betraying her thoughts. She hadn’t expected his answer to come with such conviction. It was… flattering. The silence stretched. The longer it lasted, the more Kazuya felt like he was about to explode. And then, before he could say something stupid—Chizuru suddenly leaned in. Before Kazuya could even process what was happening, her lips brushed against his cheek in the lightest, briefest kiss. Kazuya went *completely* still. His breath hitched; his entire body locked in place like a glitching robot. By the time his brain caught up, Chizuru had already pulled back, her expression calm—but her ears were unmistakably pink. Kazuya slowly, *tenderly*, lifted a hand to his cheek, touching the spot she kissed as if he couldn’t believe it was real. His heart pounded so loudly he was sure she could hear it. \*She just—She just—\*Chizuru, noticing his stunned silence, averted her gaze slightly, picking up her cup to take a sip—though the way she held it almost seemed like a way to hide her face. Mini ducked behind a nearby pillar, gripping her cup tightly as she *internally screamed*. *OH. MY. GOD. DID THAT JUST HAPPEN?!* She peeked around the corner. *Kazuya’s totally short-circuiting! Look at him! He’s clutching his cheek like it’s the holy grail! And Chizuru—ohhh, she’s trying so hard to act normal but I see those pink ears! Busted!* Mini inhaled deeply, calming herself. This was a once-in-a-lifetime moment. She had to make the most of it.Striding back to the table like nothing happened, she took her seat and, with a perfectly innocent expression, asked, ""Alright, I’m back! Did anything exciting happen while I was away? ""Chizuru, without missing a beat, quickly replied, ""No.""Mini barely held back her grin. *Ohhh, you’re gonna play it like that, huh.* She slowly turned to Kazuya, who was still holding his cheek like it had been blessed by the gods. His face was bright red, eyes glazed over, clearly still living in a different dimension. Mini smirked. ""Uh-huh. *Nothing* happened, huh?"" Chizuru took a sip of her drink, voice level. ""That’s right."" Mini leaned closer, eyes glinting. ""Sooo… *if* I had happened to see *someone* sneaking a little kiss just now… that would’ve been my imagination, right?"" Kazuya *instantly* snapped back to reality. His entire body jolted upright, his soul nearly *leaving his body*. ""Y-Y-Y-YOU SAW?!?!"" Mini *grinned*. ""Oh, I *totally* saw."" Chizuru visibly tensed; her cup still raised to her lips in a failed attempt to look casual. Mini gasped dramatically, clutching her chest. ""Mizuhara-san, how *daring* of you! Making the first move?! And on *clueless, bumbling Kazu-kun* no less?! I respect the boldness!"" Kazuya’s brain was fried beyond repair. ""*B-B-Bold—?!*"" Chizuru finally set her cup down, exhaling sharply before shooting Mini a calm—but deadly—look. ""Mini. ""Mini held up her hands, laughing. ""Okay, okay, I’ll stop! But *man*, I never thought I’d see the day. ""She turned to Kazuya, who looked like he was about to *combust*. ""Kazu-kun, how does it feel to be blessed by the goddess herself? ""Kazuya opened his mouth. Nothing came out. Just a choked wheeze. Mini laughed even harder. ""He’s totally broken! Chizuru, what have you *done? ""Chizuru* sighed, rubbing her temple. ""Mini, *enough*.""Mini smirked but finally relented, sitting back in her chair. ""Fiiine, fiiine. I’ll let you guys stew in it."" She took another sip of her drink. ""But for the record… I *knew* something was bound to happen eventually.""Kazuya, still gripping his cheek, groaned. ""I-I need a minute…""Mini just grinned. ""Take your time, lover boy. ""Chizuru?

Before the Storm

It started on a day like any other. I was wrapped in a hoodie, sipping coffee as sunlight filtered through half-closed blinds. Ann was still asleep in the next room, curled up on my side of the bed. She always did that when she missed me.

I was working on an art piece doodled in the margins of an old journal. Nothing special. 

Mom called, like she always did:

“Hope you’re eating something that is actually healthy for you.”

“Yeah I’m eating cup of ramen noodles with some hot Cheetos” 

“Honey can you please eat something that won’t send you to the bathroom every 10 minutes? You know your stomach doesn’t handle spicy food well. And it’s early in the morning why are you eating ramen and hot Cheetos??. Please eat something healthy.”

“Yeah, but I don’t eat this often and we haven’t gone grocery shopping, Ann is still asleep and I need to put something in my stomach.” 

 “Don’t forget to take your vitamins, you know how important it is, your health is important for your age! You’re not 18 anymore” 

I reply “Yes mom I will take my vitamins, I gotta go Ann is waking up so we’re gonna get ready to head out. I’ll call you back later, love you. 

“Alright honey, call me if you need anything. Love you too” 

That evening, me and Ann walked to the corner store. I joked about the lottery. Promised her a bathtub that filled from the ceiling if I won.

That was a good day.

A really good day.

⸻

The First Flicker

It started in the park. A sudden pause. Just one breath that didn’t come all the way in. I didn’t tell Ann.

Then again—at the gym. My arms heavy. Vision narrowed. I sat down. Waited. It passed.

I chalked it up to overtraining. Maybe dehydration. But deep down, something whispered.

I just wasn’t ready to listen.

⸻

The Appointment

I went in alone. Told Ann it was nothing serious. But after the tests came back, the doctor’s voice changed.

He used words like “progressive.”
“No known cure.”
“Terminal.”

I didn’t cry. Not there. Not then.

But the world tilted, and I knew it wouldn’t tilt back.

⸻

Telling Her

The hardest call I ever made.

Mom answered quickly.

“Hey sweetheart! Everything okay?”

“No,” I said, “I went to the doctor. They found something. It’s… it’s terminal.”

“No. No, baby…”

“I’m so sorry, Mom.”

“Baby it’s okay. I’ll be right there. Every step.”

⸻

The Days After

Grief crept in slowly. The fridge filled with meds. The mirror reflected a thinner frame. Ann started waking up before you just to watch you breathe.

I still danced in the kitchen. Still joked about cereal. Still said “I’m okay” even when I wasn’t .

But I felt it.
The countdown had started.

Imagine wandering the medieval streets of Barcelona after a late night at a sailor's bar in 1900.  You stumble in to one of the few places still open at that time of night; Els Quatre Gats.  You were hoping to see Santiago Rusiñol, Miguel Utrillo, or Ramon Casa i Carbó debating the state of art.  In the back, a young artist named Pablo Picasso is having his first one-man show.  ""Els Quatre Gats"" is Catalan slang for ""just a few people.""  Very true tonight as you decide what snack to pair with your coffee.

1jvlq9p,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1jvlq9p/gods_least_favorite_part_2/,God's Least Favorite: Part 2,"At home, I spent the rest of the next two days straight laying on my back and staring at the ceiling. I forced myself to eat enough to keep my strength from fading completely, but all willpower to do *anything* had been taken from me. At the end of the second day, I got a text from Aaliyah.

*‘Heeeey! :3 I’m worried about you. Call when you get a chance.’*

I responded: *‘Will call later. At 6:00.’* I didn’t. I fell asleep around 4:00, then slept until the next morning. When I checked my phone, she’d texted me once at 9:30 to say goodnight. I felt awful.

I started blowing through my accrued sick-time, not mentally able to handle going into my job anymore. Overall, I had about 2 weeks’ worth of PPTO acquired, which flew by far too fast for me to even begin to feel like I had mentally recovered from the incident in the technology closet. With every passing day, every passing hour, I felt more and more distressed in the dreadful anticipation of when I would run out of sick time and would have to return to work.

Aaliyah stopped responding to me altogether after I fell asleep on her without calling. After that night, she would get my messages but started leaving me on read. It didn’t matter how much I apologized, she didn’t respond. At one point, the three dots popped up for a few seconds to indicate she was typing something, but it quickly vanished without anything having been sent. I tried calling her twice, ready to explain EVERYTHING I’ve already explained so far up to this point. I didn’t care if it sounded insane, I just needed someone to confide in about what had been happening at work. Still, no luck. The calls rang ‘til they timed out.

The day before I knew I would have to return to work, I felt like puking from the second I awoke to the second I managed to somehow fall asleep. My apartment had devolved into a mess, and I had become a recluse; not even leaving my place to purchase groceries. I was living on leftovers, portioned out to last for as long as possible. On my final day, I ate a pitifully small amount of food that, altogether combined, maybe would’ve been enough to constitute one meal. It’s not like I was doing anything to actively burn calories, but you’d really be surprised how much worrying constantly can absolutely famish you.

Returning to work, it was a mostly quiet day. The store manager herself asked me if I was doing better since we’d last spoken. I wanted so badly to try explaining to her everything that had been happening to me at the hands of one of her coaches. I told her I was doing better. Coach Oleander wasn’t there that day, but neither was Aaliyah. I shot her a text on my final break.

*‘Miss you.’*

It was left on read.

When I clocked out, I went to the sporting goods section and bought a folding pocketknife, as well as a keychain canister of pepper spray. I also took a cart around the store and completely restocked up on food. That night, as a reward to myself for getting through the day, I made a big dinner of fried salmon in a lemon marinade with peppered asparagus. I ate on my couch, dazed out in front of the TV with some Anime on, and tried to make myself believe the worst was behind me. I couldn’t guarantee I wouldn’t be victimized again, but I could at least feel assured of my ability to defend myself if I needed to. Or, at least, I could feel assured of my willingness to fight back. The knowledge that I was being proactive in protecting myself brought me comfort. I was retaking control in my life.

The very next day, coach Oleander was back. I kept a very harsh, firm distance from him, making direct eye contact with him whenever we passed or were working in the same area. The truth was, I didn’t feel strong or tough; I just wanted him to know I didn’t feel weak. He seemed unphased by this.

“Good morning, Chloe! How was your vacation?”

“Better than being here.”

He grinned. “Surely, you don’t mean that?”

“Just keep your distance from me today and going forward.”

He cocked his head, curiously. “I don’t-”

“Just dop it and stay away. If you have anything to tell me, keep a good few feet away from me while you do so. Understand?”

“I don’t understand why you’re being so defensive.” He said, scratching the side of his head. His hands were torn up, blistered and scarred from how he’d been torturing himself around me.

“I just don’t like people coming into my personal space. Past trauma. You can respect that, right?” I gripped the pepper-spray in my pocket.

“Hmmm sure, Chloe. Anything you say. Now get back to work.”

Aaliyah wasn’t there that day either. In fact, she wasn’t even on the schedule anymore. At lunch, I opened the store app on my phone and scrolled through the list of employee names to see if she was supposed to be in, and her name wasn’t anywhere to be found. The last names were all in alphabetical order, so hers should’ve been easy to locate.

*‘Hey Aaliyah! Did you quit? I’m really worried about you. I haven’t seen you in a while. You’ve been leaving my messages on read. Would you like me to stop messaging you? I can leave you alone if you prefer. I’m sorry. I hope I’m not being pushy.’*

Coach Oleander entered the break room, whistling to himself. He immediately put two spoonsful of instant coffee in a Styrofoam cup and started pouring hot water into it before mixing it around. He was the only other person in there with me and I immediately went on edge when I saw him.

*‘I have something to tell you about Coach Oleander if you’d like to hear. I want to fill you in on what’s been going on with me. Miss you.’*

I hit send.

Coach Oleander’s pocket vibrated.

My attention snapped over to him immediately. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up on alert, but I tried to convince myself it was just a coincidence. I swallowed back bile and sent a second, shorter text.

*‘Test’*

His pocket vibrated again.

*‘Test’*

His pocket vibrated again.

I got up and approached him slowly. Coach Oleander turned around and smiled at me. “Chloe! I thought you said not to get too close to you?” He hissed the last few words like a snake.

I could feel my lip quivering. “Aaliyah.” I managed to choke out. It was an accusation.

Coach Oleander didn’t say anything. Didn’t move. His smile remained and he calmly stirred his coffee.

I crept my soul into contact with his, immediately wishing I hadn’t. Radiating off him was this feeling of malicious rage. Violent feelings. Hate. Lust. The sensation of warm beef being ripped apart with bare fingers. Screaming. That imageless dream you get when you’re sleeping, and you suddenly feel like your body is freefalling. The floor bubbled up smears of blood that splattered the walls of his home and I knew. I knew.

I shook my head, backing away from him. “No!” I was holding back sobs.

He stepped towards me. “Chloe, you seem pale, are you alright?”

“Stay back!” I screamed, hoping somebody would hear and intervene. He lunged forward, placing one hand over my mouth and the other tight around my throat. He closed his eyes, composed himself, allowed his hands to fall to my shoulders and whispered. “Shhhhh… It’s okay. You seem sick. Why don’t you go home for the night? I won’t be here tomorrow, but I trust you’ll know what’s expected of you. And don’t worry about this affecting your attendance. I’ll take care of it.”

I stared into his rotten eyes, the color of roadkill baking on a hot day. Could smell his putrid breath that passed by yellowed teeth. Could feel his soul, textured and indulging. It didn’t feel like any other human soul I had ever felt before, not even his own from days past.

I shot past him, walking straight to the front entrance and out to my car. I didn’t even bother to clock out as I left. The entire drive home, I was fighting back the emotional release I knew was coming and that threatened to boil over at any given point. I don’t know how I managed to make it through my apartment door before the dam broke, and I was crying curled up on the floor. Aaliyah was gone. I knew what happened to her. I didn’t know where she was now, but I knew where it had occurred. I blamed myself; I still do. I promised myself when she first started working there that I would protect her, and I hadn’t. I had failed. It happened when I was away from work. I’d left her in a wolf’s den by herself. I thought back to that night, when I promised her I’d call before falling asleep shortly after. I wished I’d stayed awake. I wished I’d told her everything then. I wished I’d warned her about him.

Before I cried myself to sleep, I got a message from Aaliyah’s account.

*‘I’d love to hear what you have to say about Coach Oleander! Tell me all about him. :3’*

The next day, I was a zombie at work. Going through the motions, completely dead inside. I made it through my first break, then my lunch, both without feeling or thinking anything. When I had about three hours left on my shift, I stopped in the aisle I was working in and rubbed my eyes hard. I found myself staring up at the metal roof paneling above and glancing down the long, featureless rows of products, wondering to myself what the point of even coming into work was anymore. What did it matter if I didn’t make my bills? What did it matter if I gave up altogether and starved? Why would that be any less preferable to what my life had become?

I spent those final three hours thinking to myself about giving up on life and how much I wanted to. I wanted to abandon all responsibility and remove myself from a world that seemingly had nothing but cruelty to offer me, but ultimately, I decided against doing so. I said at the start of this recounting that I do believe the average leanings of human nature are towards compassion, and I mean that. If I choose to expend the remaining duration of my life, that is my prerogative; but I will not abandon the world in doing so. I will leave it a better place for all of you, even if that means dragging a monster to my grave with me. He will never hurt an Aaliyah again.

I made it through my shift without quitting somehow. I knew I didn’t have much longer, just had to make it back to work one more time to begin enacting my scheme.

I didn’t sleep most of the night, mulling over the fine details of how exactly I was going to do what I was thinking. By the time the sun rose, I’d barely slept a wink, but it didn’t matter. My heart was pounding in my chest, and I could feel my blood pumping through my fingertips. Plus, I knew I wasn’t going in for a full shift anyway. This would be my last day there ever.

I left for work a few minutes earlier than I normally do, took the complete twenty-minute drive in dead silence with nothing but the growl of the engine and my own thoughts to keep me company. Was I ready for what I knew was coming next? Not really. It didn’t matter. I was committed, regardless of how unprepared I felt. The plan wasn’t complicated… yet. That would come later.

I got in to work, grabbed my cart, and went straight to my first assigned aisle. I needed to make it through the first two-ish hours of the day, to keep what I was going to request from sounding overtly suspicious. No problem. I didn’t put on a podcast like I normally would’ve because I didn’t want to lose concentration on what was coming; lest the gumption to do it escape me. Coach Oleander passed me with a smile. “Good morning, Chloe!”

I forced a smile back. “Good morning, Coach.”

I made it to my first fifteen-minute break. It would be my final there ever. I spent the whole time tapping my foot anxiously, elbows on one of the tables and my head in my hands. No matter how much I tried to focus my breathing, I couldn’t seem to manage. I realized that even though I was wearing deodorant, I was sweating through my clothes; but I wasn’t sure how much of that was the adrenaline hyping me up, versus my not having slept the night before. Both were almost certainly playing their own parts.

When my break was over, I stood up, took a deep breath, and set out to find Coach Oleander. I was ready. No, I wasn’t, but I had to be. I kept clutching my fists into alternating balls left-right-left-right-left- over and over again, trying to forcibly give myself something else to focus on as a distraction. I had to play this off as naturally as I could manage.

I approached Coach Oleander cautiously. He had to think two things for my plan to work: Firstly, he had to think I was afraid of him but that whatever I was dealing with was severe enough that I was resorting to him for assistance with a personal issue. Secondly, he had to feel enticed with the prospect of potentially gaining new information about me he could further hurt me with. If I could convince him of those two things than maybe… just maybe…

“Coach Oleander?” I asked him on the sales floor.

“Yes, Chloe?”

“I’m-” I looked down at the floor, hoping with everything in me that I was a better liar than I knew I was. “I’m really sorry… Can I borrow your phone for a second? Mine’s on low charge and I *really* need to call my sister. Our mother’s in the hospital and… It’s urgent.” I looked up at him, as doe eyed as I could manage, trying to get a feel for him. Thankfully, I really was absolutely scared of what I was about to do, and he could feel my fear through my soul. He felt my fear, and incorrectly assessed it as being intimidated by him.

“Of course!” He said, immediately pulling his phone out of his pocket. He’d bought it. Never mind that I’m an only child, he actually thought I was dumb enough to call my sister with his phone and let him find out her number. I could feel my previously dry mouth absolutely salivating when he handed his phone over to me, pin-pad on. “You can call her right here.”

“Okay! Just let me check her number quickly, since I don’t know it off the top of my head.”  I pulled out my phone and opened Instagram. This was the most important part: My plan wouldn’t work if he had a second phone on him and I had to make sure Aaliyah’s was somewhere else. “I hope my battery holds out long enough for me to check…”

I sent Aaliyah a message. *‘I quit.’* His pocket didn’t vibrate. I felt an unwilling smile wash over my face as I threw his phone into the cement floor before stomping on it with all my might.

“What the fuck are you doing!?” He screamed at me. I stomped again, then again. Over and over, bits of glass and even plastic from the casing flying in all directions. I only stopped once his fist collided with the side of my head, knocking me backwards. It didn’t matter, I’d achieved what I’d needed to.

I scrambled to my feet and immediately started speed-walking towards the door. I could hear him say from somewhere behind me over his radio “Yes, I have a situation back…”. I didn’t care. I made it out the front of the building, took off my vest, and crossed the parking lot over to his truck. I silently prayed he didn’t somehow have another phone and wouldn’t be alerted to the AirTag I tossed in the bed, underneath some tarps.

I drove all the way home, crawled into bed, and slept for almost nine hours. When I woke up, It was 7:48 in the evening and I felt exhilarated. I opened my phone. ‘Aaliyah’ had seen my most recent text and left me on read. I opened the Find My app and checked on the status of the AirTag I’d thrown in the back of his truck. It was located in the driveway of a house, only seven-minutes away.

I got in my car and rode to the neighborhood, slowing down when I went past the pinged house. Sure enough, his truck was the lone vehicle in the driveway of a single-wide mobile home. I left, came back after nightfall and retrieved the tag from the back of his truck. I knew it wouldn’t be long before he got a new phone, if he hadn’t gotten one already. I didn’t want him to realize he’d been tracked.

That was three weeks ago. I’ve spent a lot of time watching him, learning his habits intimately. There’s one predictable one that he seems to follow to a tee: Every Saturday he has off, so every Friday night he DoorDash’s fast food to his home. The driver always leaves it on his porch, and it always takes him a few minutes after they’ve left to bring it inside. That’s my ace in the hole, so to speak.

Did you know Rohypnol is sold over the counter in many pharmacies in Mexico? Legally it’s not supposed to be, but the enforcement of drug regulation in parts of the country is so lax that in many areas, it can be purchased as a ‘sleep-aid’. I didn’t have money or time to go to Mexico, but someone in one of my Discord servers was taking a vacation there with his family and I convinced him to smuggle a few of the pills back into the states for me. I told him I was dealing with insomnia and wanted to try a few of the ‘heavier’ treatment options I couldn’t get prescribed here, to see if they would be more helpful than Melatonin had been. When he got back, he sent me a postcard with a baggie and a few white pills. Perfect.

Tonight, when Coach Oleander orders food again, I’m going to drug his soda. Fucker’s getting a double dose; he’s a big guy and I’m not taking any risks. A few hours after his food is delivered, I’m going to enter his home with my pocketknife and put an end to his pathetic existence. I don’t believe there is any chance I have at getting away with this, which is why I’m writing it out. I want the full truth of my story to be known and remembered. If-and-when the police come for me, I’m going out my own way. I have not endured everything I have, just to rot in a prison cell.

I’ve spent a lot of time lately, wondering if there’s an afterlife of some kind for me to look forward to. One would think the existence of souls would mean ‘yes’, but I’m not really sure that souls continue existing anywhere onward once someone dies. Do we speculate to what heaven the candle’s flame ascends when it burns out? It seems to me that my soul, the entirety of my experience, is tied intrinsically to my mortal existence. Just because that experience isn’t limited within the sensations of my body like most people’s, doesn’t give me any extra reasoning to believe it will continue past the cessation of my life. I hope it does. Maybe there is a heaven, and I’ll get to see Aaliyah one last time before descending into hell for eternity with our abuser. If that turns out to be the case, I swear on every scrap of willpower in my being that I won’t be his victim when I get there: He’ll be mine.

It's been a hell of a life. I wish I could’ve made it to 30. I didn’t have anything special planned, but it still would’ve been neat, I guess. To whoever’s reading this, I love you. Hold out through times of hardship, look out for the people around you and never tolerate poor treatment from others.

To Joshua Oleander, I am not afraid of you, nor the pathetic, damaged little soul inside your head. Meeting me was the worst thing that ever happened to you and harming my friend was the worst decision you ever made. When I am done absolutely annihilating your unconscious body beyond anything your own parents will recognize, I will tear your trailer apart until I find any hint as to what you might’ve done with Aaliyah.

I hope the roofie knocks you out fully and you’re completely unconscious when I come for you. I don’t want you to feel how much I’m going to enjoy this.",1,1744246746.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

In spite of everything I have endured over the course of the last few months, I think I still believe this. I have felt enough souls in my life to know that warmth and compassion and love are the true colors of humanity. Though I have only been fortunate enough to have experienced such positive qualities firsthand from a single other person, knowing that most people are sincerely good fills me with hope and leaves me envious of the rest of you. I am crestfallen by the knowledge that I truly have nothing positive, or of worth, to give back to others. My light has been taken from me, and I am no longer one of the majority.

This is not an admission of guilt, but an explanation of intent. People will think that I’m a monster for what I’m about to do. I believe I am; but rest assured, the person I am going to do it to is a *million* times worse than me. I do not believe there is any chance I can get away with this, so I want my accounting of the events leading up to this crime to be publicly available. This won’t absolve me, morally nor legally, but maybe at least a few people will be convinced to not write me off completely as a human being. Maybe someday, if ever they let me out, I can find the colors of humanity in myself once more. I really hope so.

I was born with a soul too big for my body. To be specific, my soul extends about five-to-six feet out from me in all directions; up, down, and all around. Imagine it like a big metaphysical globe with my head at the center of it. Now, it’s probably a reasonable assumption that nobody who reads this (who hasn’t already discarded it as the manifesto of a madwoman) will have any idea what I’m talking about. That’s okay, I’ll do my best to explain.

Every person has a soul; the incorporeal summation of their thoughts, experiences, memories, values and interests. Put more simply, your consciousness. Described even simpler than that, your *you*. It exists in the very center of your brain, immaterial of the spongey gray matter around it, yet tied from it inseparably. For the vast majority of people, it’s about as big as a marble.  Sometimes smaller, sometimes a smidge bigger.  The largest soul I’ve ever felt was about the size of a superball. Mine is an exercise ball, quintupled.

But what, I imagine you’re asking, does this mean exactly?  Well, your soul is supposed to exist fully within your own mind for a reason: It limits the breadth of your experience down to only the senses of your body. Your soul isn’t supposed to come in contact with anything outside of you. If it’s everything you experience, you will experience everything it touches; including other souls.

When Momma was pregnant with me, everything seemed to be going well at first. When the ultrasound technician told my parents they were going to have a little girl, they were elated. Of course, they would have loved me no matter who I would’ve been, but the two of them had both been hoping their first would be a daughter. Momma had a lot of precious childhood things she’d been hoping to pass down to me, and Daddy wanted the experience of being a strong protector for his little princess. Things seemed to be going better than they could have dreamed.

Shortly after the start of the third trimester, my soul formed, and the illusion of their perfect pregnancy was shattered. My mother woke up from a good dream turned sour, as her mind was filled with static and abstract shapes… my developing brain’s earliest semblance of thoughts. In addition, she could literally feel everything in the room around her. She felt my soul, and my soul felt as far as it extended.

My father, upon waking up, realized he felt the same way she did; but when he got up and left the room in a rush to call 911, it stopped. For him, at least. My mother kept screaming from the bedroom as she non-consensually sponged up the world around her. For me, it would’ve been normal: the first stages of experience. For her, it would have been hellish: living a whole life knowing only that which her body experienced, to suddenly wake up feeling everything around her all at once. I was the metaphysical jumper cable, hooking her senses up to the car-battery of the world. Through an inseparable proximity to me, she experienced reality times a thousand.

She was rushed to the hospital via ambulance; the EMT’s in the back themselves experiencing the same experiential terrors she was. All medical experts who examined her had no idea what was happening; but none of them had made the conclusion that it had anything to do with me. Why would they? All they could deduce was that walking too close to her seemed to cause an intense absorption of all possible stimuli in the immediate: Nothing about that inherently suggested I was the cause. In fact, though her vitals were constantly elevated and they had to sedate her to sleep every night for the duration of her stay, the pregnancy itself seemed completely normal. I seemed completely normal.

Momma remained hospitalized, all the way up to giving birth to me. As I came into the world, she and the medical staff on hand had to work through my experience of exiting the birth canal and seeing the confusing world with my own eyes for the first time. All at once, the truth was illuminated; I had been the cause the whole time.

I was held in the hospital for close to a week, as all sorts of tests were ran on me to evaluate the state of my health. I was given a CT scan and hooked up to an EEG to try to find *any* abnormalities in my body that could be the source of my condition. Eventually they accepted that I was a normal, healthy baby girl, who standing next to happened to cause one to feel the world in a way they otherwise wouldn’t. I didn’t seem to be in any sort of discomfort myself, so reluctantly, the doctors in the pediatric ward agreed to allow me to be discharged.

I was taken home by ambulance. The nurse in the back hurriedly passed me off to the arms of my daddy, who hurriedly laid me down in my crib. He only came into my room periodically to change my diapers, and to feed me baby formula from a bottle. Momma wanted nothing to do with me for a very long time; the time she had spent unable to escape the reach of my soul had been one of the most traumatic periods of her life. I don’t blame her, but throughout my childhood, she was never very affectionate to me.

Neither of my parents ever could stand very close to me for very long. Our dinner table was almost comically too big for our dining room; with them sitting on one end and me all the way over on the other. They would take care of me, but from a distance. It didn’t take me long to learn that I wasn’t supposed to get too close to them. I wanted to, I craved deeper interaction with my parents in the way all children do. Nonetheless, I just sort of accepted that things were as things were, and that was that. I didn’t have any reason to believe that our relationship was in some way abnormal; it was just how I’d always known the world to be.

I was homeschooled to the best of my parents’ abilities until fourth grade. They were trying to keep me away from other kids and teachers, but eventually it became too much for them to handle, and they realized the quality of my education wasn’t sufficiently what I’d need to succeed in life. They enrolled me in the district’s elementary school, where I began my educational career of being avoided by everyone in all my classes. I was usually sat alone, in the back corner of the room, where my soul couldn’t reach the next nearest student. I guess it could’ve been worse. Nobody ever bullied me. Everyone pretended I didn’t exist.

I don’t have many memorable interactions with any of my peers, to be honest. There is this one time that stands out in my mind as clearly to me now as when it happened: I had arrived to class late and a group of three girls were talking about me, thinking that I was out sick for the day. I didn’t hear the start of the conversation.

“-like Chloe, or whatever?”

“CHLOE!” One of them said in an exaggerated, mocking tone. “That bitch is a fucking cold-spot in every room she enters. It’s better when she’s out sick. We can walk around the classroom normally without having to avoid the area near the sink.”

The third girl looked past them and saw me standing there, her face going pale. The other two caught her gaze and turned to face me. We stared at each other in silence for several seconds, before I quietly took my seat. I made sure to pass right by their group so all three of them were forced to feel the tears I was holding back.

Mostly though, my time in school was uneventful. I distracted myself from loneliness by throwing myself into podcasts and video games. They gave me some semblance of simulated interaction with others. It wasn’t until I was older, at about my early twenties, that I started critically evaluating my life and realized all the normal experiences I’d been deprived of. Watching TV on the couch together as a family. Being tucked in to bed at night. Sleepovers. Sitting next to friends in the cafeteria. A first kiss. Having someone to dance with at Prom. Even though I understood *why* I didn’t have those things, I’d never allowed myself to realize how much I’d wanted them. It would’ve been too painful to allow myself to think about. I really wish I could’ve been hugged more.

After high school, I went off to college to pursue a four-year degree in web design. My college years were peaceful. Lonely still, but I was out on my own and that helped a lot. It’s easier to forget about how isolated you are when you don’t have to live with people who choose to avoid you. I even went to a party, if you can believe it. This one guy who I thought was kinda cute even approached me, offering me a red cup full of jungle-juice. I took it reluctantly, smiling shyly at him. He stood next to me for all of about twenty seconds, said “Anyway, it was nice talking to you.” and hurried off. I set the cup down, too dejected to enjoy it. I’d find out a few days later that he had been expelled and criminally charged for roofie’ing some poor girl and taking advantage of her.

Out of college, I had trouble finding work. It felt like everyone in my generation had been encouraged to go into IT as a career. By the time I had my degree, the field was overcrowded, save for inconsistent freelance jobs that rarely offered what they were worth. I got a job as a sales associate at a local branch of a big-chain retail company; just to pad my finances as I took the odd-jobs I could and tried to make something of my degree. Eventually, years passed with diminishing returns, and I inevitably stopped searching for opportunities to put my degree to use. I took on $50,000 worth of college debt, to become a retail associate. I had no friends, my attempts at a dating life had all fallen through as nobody could physically stand to be around me. At least customers left me alone; approaching me to ask a question, before stopping, then going to find a different employee. It allowed me to work in silence.

When I was about 27, we got a new girl on my team. She’d just turned 18 and this was her first job. At this point, I’d been at the store for about five years and was thoroughly familiar with the bullshit that came standard with the industry. I’d seen how customers would often mistreat employees and many of the managers would denigrate the associates beneath their reach in acts of petty power; showing off to corporate how well they could exercise control over us. Feeling sympathetic for the new girl not knowing anyone, I quietly made it a personal undertaking of mine to watch over her. Make sure nobody gave her shit or fucked with her. I’d keep tabs on where she was assigned for the day on the schedule and would find reasons to walk by her position to try getting a read on how she was doing from a distance. I learned her name was Aaliyah, and even though I’d never spoken to her, I found myself emotionally becoming fiercely protective of her. I think I just wanted to feel contact with someone so badly, I formed a parasocial relationship with a coworker. Looking back I know it was unhealthy, but I’d taken it upon myself as my responsibility to ensure her wellbeing.

For the first three-ish, months of Aaliyah’s employment there, we never so much as spoke to each other. It didn’t take her too long to make friends with several other of our coworkers and I started worrying about her less. She had actual friends she could rely on if she needed anything. I also had less time to concern myself with her whereabouts anyway, because it was at this time my team got a new coach: Joshua Oleander.

Coach Oleander was, in seemingly all respects, a normal enough man. 34, with thinning dark hair, square glasses, a strong heavy frame with broad shoulders and thick forearms. Not that this will likely add much additional description to you, but his soul was about the size of a grape. I would become intimately aware of its exact dimensions in the months following his hiring, as he was one of the only two people I’ve ever met who could stand to be around me.

Periodically, Coach Oleander would repeatedly confront me throughout the workday; something all my previous team-leads and coaches would look for any reason to avoid doing. He had no problem walking right up to me, standing well within range of my soul, and demanding a complete rundown on what I was doing and everything I had accomplished since he had last spoken to me. This was something he did with everyone under his lead and even though he would try to present himself as friendly and ‘simply checking in’, there was an unspoken understanding that he was doing it as an intimidation tactic. Behind his frequent requests for progress updates, there was a thinly veiled threat that he was looking for any reason he could find to write someone up and have them coached if we didn’t exceed his standards. This practically doubled my workload throughout the day, as now I needed to do everything I’d already been doing, plus extra, to keep him satisfied and not breathing right down my neck.

I got three reprieves throughout the day: Two fifteen-minute paid breaks and a one-hour unpaid lunch. I basically started spending all three napping with my head down on one of the folding plastic tables in the employee lounge. I was exhausted, more mentally than physically. The added responsibility, plus worry about whether I was doing enough so as not to invoke Coach Oleander’s ire, was putting a lot of stress on me while I was at my job. Only while in my apartment, was I able to relax.

One day, while I was resting on my break, head down on the table in my arms, I felt someone pass into the range of my soul. I expected them to hesitantly move on like they normally would, but instead they lingered. I heard a metal chair scraping on linoleum, and their soul lowered as they sat down. Slowly, groggy and with five minutes still left on my last fifteen of the day, I looked up to see who it was, only to find none other than Aaliyah sitting a few feet away from me; staring intently at the break room TV.

She turned and shot me a glance, looked back at the screen briefly, then once more back to me with a smile. “Sorry. You don’t mind if I sit here, do you?”

I blinked a few times, rubbing my eyes. Her soul was the size of a gravel pebble, the kind used on unpaved roads. “Don’t you mind?”

She looked confused.

“Sitting next to me? I mean?”

“No. Why would I?”  She suddenly seemed very self-conscious. “I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to wake you up!” She said, sliding her chair back and leaning forward to stand.

“No!” I probably sounded desperate. “No, it’s okay! I’m just not used to people sitting next to me is all. Or talking.”

“Oh… Well, I’m Aaliyah.” She said.

I knew, of course, but pretended like I was just finding out. “Hi. I’m Chloe.”

“It’s nice to meet you! I’ve seen you around the store for a few months, but’ve never really gotten a chance to talk to you yet.”

“Same. Same.”

We both watched the TV playing re-runs of Deal or No Deal. It was always on in the breakroom. The show absolutely pissed me off to watch because I would’ve absolutely taken the first offer made to me every time that was anywhere over $50,000. In that moment however, the show wasn’t really what was on my mind. I was trying to think of something else to say to keep the conversation flowing, when my phone alarm started going off. My break was over.

“I’ve gotta get back to work.” I said, standing up and pulling on my work vest.

“Okay. See you around…”

“Chloe.”

“Chloe. Sorry! I’m bad with names!”

“It’s alright.”

As I turned to walk away, she said something else that caught me off guard.

“I don’t know why people wouldn’t talk to you all that much, something about you is kinda comforting.”

“Oh yeah?”

“Yeah. Kinda like a space heater. You’re like a warm spot in the room.”

The rest of my shift, my head was in the clouds. I didn’t even really mind when Coach Oleander chewed me out for not zoning all the aisles he had assigned to me before the end of the day. Looking back, this was the catalyst that led to things playing out the way they did.

Aaliyah and I worked together two more times that week. The very next day, and two days after that. Both days when I was on my breaks, she would come in and sit next to me so we could talk for a bit. The first time it happened I thought it was a coincidence. After the second and third times, I realized she was deliberately waiting for me to go on my breaks before she would take hers. We started growing closer and at the end of our third shift where we talked that week, we exchanged Insta’s. Every once in awhile while off work then, one of us would send the other some new stupid meme we’d seen.

For the time, things felt like they were looking up for me. Yeah, I still worked a shitty job I hated where I was barely scraping by on rent, groceries and college payments. I didn’t mind though, because for the first time ever, I’d found a friend I could connect with who wasn’t bothered by being around me. Sure, I’d had internet friends before on Discord and Twitter, but never anyone I felt *that* close with or could hang out with in person. The age gap between me and Aaliyah was almost ten years exactly so we weren’t ever going to do something outside of work, but while there we got along great together, talked about life, gossiped about coworkers and complained about our team-leads and coaches. We had each other’s backs, and she knew if she had any issues with anyone, she need only let me know.

She did, as a matter of fact. One shift, about two months after our friendship really started, she came to me shaken up and on the verge of tears. Some customers, two older men in their fifties (one with a soul the size of a of a pea) had come into the aisle she had been working in and said some degrading and misogynistic shit to her. She told me, on the verge of tears how one had asked her for help finding something she didn’t know the location of and the other started making comments about her chest when she didn’t know how to help them. I won’t repeat exactly what she told me they said, but it was several things between the two of them and I was absolutely fucking livid.

I stormed over into the aisle she had been working in, right up to the two men; both of whom seemed bemused by my approach at first until my soul collided with theirs. The nausea hit them almost instantly as they were sensationally hooked up to their surroundings, and they could feel the fury radiating off me into them. Even still, the one with the pea-soul managed to get out “Uh-oh, she brought back up.” In a dismissive tone.

“Excuse me gentlemen.” I said, my voice was ice. “My coworker told me you said some inappropriate things to her?”

“Are you a manager?” The one with the normal soul asked.

“No. Did you say something inappropriate to a minor?” Of course, Aaliyah wasn’t a minor, but she looked young enough and I wanted to see if they’d show any remorse or repulsion towards their actions if they believed the person they were harassing was underage.

Instead, he simply responded: “If you’re not a manager, leave us alone.” The other one took a few steps away from me and I closed the distance. The effects of standing so close to me were really starting to affect him.

“I don’t think we need to bring a manager into this. I think you two can settle this with me like men.”

At this jab, the one with the pea-soul snapped. “Lady, fuck off and leave us alone, before we *make* you get a manager!”

The rage that had been burning in my heart reached a peak, before igniting into a cold flame that chilled my blood. “Aaliyah, get back.” I said. She hesitated. I could feel her soul, still a few feet behind me. “NOW.” I said forcefully, and she complied. When she was out of the range of what I could feel, I reached into my pocket and pulled out my cigarette lighter, took two steps towards the men for good measure, and flicked it alight.

The full sensation of the burn rushed through my soul and into both of theirs. To me it was nothing I hadn’t felt ten thousand times before in my life, every time I stood next to a candle or lit up a smoke. To them, it was the most sudden and intensely overwhelming sensation of their lives. The one with the pea-soul immediately fell to the floor in a violent seizure, mouth frothing down the side of his face and into his hair. The other one screamed and covered his ears before scratching at the side of his head, bent over and emptied the contents of his stomach onto the floor. I stood over them both, lighter in hand, forcing them to feel it for several long, grueling seconds before I finally clicked it off.

“I’m sorry gentlemen! Allow me to get a manager for you!” I feigned concern before turning and marching out of the aisle past Aaliyah, who stood there shocked. She had no idea what I had just done to them on her behalf. No, that’s not true. It was on my behalf. She was a very sweet girl and never would have wished that on anyone, even her harassers. I take full responsibility for that.

I didn’t at the time, of course. I told the store manager we had a medical emergency in one of the aisles and led her back to the men. She put a call-out over the radio to call an ambulance for them, and both men were taken out on stretchers. I’ll be so honest right now, I felt really bad for Vic, the maintenance guy, having to clean up all that vomit. I don’t regret doing what I did, but I still feel bad that he had to clean it up. Vic, if you ever read this and I’m somehow not dead or in prison for what I’m about to do, I owe you a favor.

The next day, I was called into the security office, where the store manager and Coach Oleander were waiting for me. They had me take a seat, before pulling up the footage of my confrontation with the men from the day before. The video didn’t have audio, but they could see Aaliyah take a few steps back, before I pulled out my lighter, flicked it on and both men dropped.

Immediately Coach Oleander went on a rant about how I was going to get us sued for what I did to them, to which I replied that I hadn’t done anything. The store manager asked me to explain what had happened, and I told her all about what they had said to Aaliyah. I told her I was intervening on her behalf and had been trying to resolve things amicably. One of the men had started shouting at me and I had started fidgeting with my lighter; a nervous habit formed from years of smoking. Then, for some reason, one man collapsed, and the other started puking and it was just so *shocking* and *unexpected* I *froze*, before regaining the sense of mind to run for help.

The store manager leaned back in her chair, rubbing her chin consideringly. As far as she could tell, I hadn’t done anything wrong, even if she was visibly nauseous and uncomfortable from being so close to me… A discomfort Coach Oleander noticeably didn’t share. Eventually, she told me I was wrong for having gone to confront the customers on my own and that company policy clearly stated I should’ve known to seek out a team-lead or coach to deal with it. I was getting a write-up, and Coach Oleander was going to have to check in with me more frequently.

I left the security office feeling relieved. All things considered, I had gotten off very light, for doing something that, for all I’d known, could’ve killed two people. Granted, the world wouldn’t have lost anything if they had died, but still… In that moment, I felt lucky.

I couldn’t have been more wrong.

Coach Oleander started finding reasons to heckle me throughout the day. He’d find ‘imperfections’ on the shelves I’d organized, before making me do them all over again. During team meetings, he’d make a show of individually praising the work of everyone else beneath him, except for me. He’d start making offhand remarks in passing when I messed something up, calling me a ‘dumbass’ or telling me to ‘Get (my) shit together!’. I raised my concern about this to the store manager, who had me write an incident report and told me she’d follow through on discussing it with him. Nothing ever came of it. In retrospect, these should’ve been the first serious red-flags that I wasn’t safe there, but I was struggling to make rent and still deep in student loans. I tolerated it, but only, I told myself, until I could find somewhere else to work that would match my pay. Unfortunately, I made $2.00 over the minimum wage and not a lot of positions I was qualified for were willing to meet me there; much less places that were even hiring.

I would rant about my frustrations with how management was treating me to Aaliyah through texts and voice memos after work. She was sympathetic and always willing to lend me an eager ear, but there wasn’t anything she could really do. Just having someone to vent to was cathartic, but it didn’t alleviate the stress I felt at work that had already been mounting before then. Not only that, but Aaliyah had become more apprehensive around me since the incident with the two men. She had been there and knew for certain I had done *something* to them but had no idea what that might’ve been. I didn’t know how to go about explaining it to her, it’s already taken me this long to explain it to you. Plus, I didn’t know what she’d think of me if she knew what I was capable of. I’d decided it was best to just keep it to myself

One day, while at work, I was stocking as per usual, in the condiment’s aisle. Coach Oleander came up behind me while I was on the ladder of the stocking cart, one ear bud in, listening to music as everyone did while working there.

“Chloe. How’s it coming along?” He spoke unexpectedly, a hostile tone to his voice that made me jump; clutch the railing of the cart with one hand and accidentally knock a jar of pickles off the shelf with the other. My heart dropped through my guts as I watched the jar fall, and I tensed up as my soul felt it explode on the ground in a spray of glass and juice that speckled the floor.

“I’m so sorry, Coach! I- I didn’t hear you come up behind me!” My heart was racing from the adrenaline rush of the whole situation.

“Then maybe you shouldn’t have an AirPod in while you work.” He said, as if he hadn’t knowingly come right up behind me and startled me on purpose. I could feel the glee in his soul and he could feel the panic in mine. I knew. He knew I knew. He also knew I knew there was nothing I could say to him about it.

“Yes Coach…”

“Take it out.”

“What?”

“You said ‘yes Coach’. Take the AirPod out of your ear.”

I didn’t object or point out the hypocrisy of everyone else being allowed to have one in. Silently, I complied.

Oleander was studying me like he’d had some sort of realization. It was like something in his head had clicked, and he finally understood the context of what everyone experienced while standing close to me. He grinned. “Good.” He looked down and nudged the broken glass and juice and pickle spears with his shoe. “Don’t you think you should clean this up?”

“Y- Yes Coach…” I said, stepping down off the stocking cart and making for where we kept the brooms and bags of spill absorbent powder in the back.

“I’ll stand by this mess until you get back.”

As I cleaned it up, I could feel his eyes on the back of my head, unblinking. Every time I moved out of the range of his soul, he would step back into the boundaries of mine. He reminded me of an animal stalking its prey and I could feel his enjoyment of my anxiety being reflected back at him. I avoided him for the rest of my shift, refusing to be near him if somebody else wasn’t around.

“Are you okay?” Aaliyah asked me a day later during our lunch break. “You seem upset by something.”

“I’m fine…”

“You haven’t touched your ramen at all. That’s not like you.”

I looked down at my Styrofoam cup of instant noodles and stirred them with the plastic fork disinterestedly. “I guess I just haven’t felt great recently.” I knew Aaliyah could feel that something was troubling me deeply. I could feel her concern.

“Okay… Let me know if you need anything?”

“I will.”

Nothing serious of note happened again until a few days later. It was early in the morning at the start of my shift, when Coach Oleander came into my aisle and walked up to me, holding two coffee cups.

“Good morning, Chloe!” He said, offering one out to me. I eyed it with great caution, able to sense the boiling liquid within.

“Good morning, Coach… I’m sorry, I’m not feeling well this morning.”

“Well, maybe this’ll help perk you up?”

“I don’t really like caffeine. I’m sorry.”

“No. Don’t apologize. It’s good.” He said, but I could see the anger veiled behind his eyes. “I trust you’ll be able to work fast without it then?”

“Yes Coach.”

“Good.” Just as he was walking away from me, he crushed the paper cup meant for me. The boiling coffee gushed out and spilled over his left hand; instantly turning the flesh a dark shade of red and causing blisters to bubble and pop wherever it ran.

I inhaled sharply and grabbed the back of my left hand, rubbing it aggressively and leaning as far back from him as I could. It wasn’t enough.

“Ow! Damn! My bad!” Coach Oleander exclaimed, not at all sounding like he was bothered by the pain. “I’m sorry! I accidentally made a mess next to where you were working!”

I could still feel the sting of sizzling dermis peeling away from the back of his hand. I blinked back tears, stepped down off my cart and walked to the other side of the aisle.

“Chloe? Where are you going? Your cart’s right here!” I did my best to pay him no mind. He walked right past me and the dull, aching sensation returned to my hand as he did so. “Don’t worry! I made the mess, I’ll clean it up. Be right back!”

If the pickle jar was the moment when the seeds of cruelty were planted in his head, the coffee was the first moment where they truly began to bear fruit. I was never quite able to tell if Coach Oleander was motivated by sadism towards me, selfish masochism towards himself, or some combination of the two. Whatever the reason, from then on, once every two or three days, harm would ‘unluckily’ befall him in my presence: forcing his suffering through me and magnifying it back onto him. Once he opened a box with his razor, and the blade ‘slipped’ and cut right through the webbing between the base of his middle and index fingers. Another time, after I had just finished unloading the pallets from the day’s truck, he walked up beside me and gripped his right fist closed into a sewing needle, piercing nearly all-the-way through his palm. I started becoming emotionally despondent while at work, dissociating as soon as I walked through the front door every morning.

Aaliyah texted me less and less, asking me what was going on and why I always seemed so worn out at work. I didn’t give her an answer. I didn’t really have one that would’ve made sense. She stopped going out of her way to line up her breaks with mine, and I went back to sleeping through them again. Attempting to, at least. Once, while my head was down in my arms, I could feel Coach Oleander’s soul come up behind me and just stand there. My heart started racing and I felt like I was on the verge of a panic attack. He stood there for close to a minute, soaking in my growing anxiety, before finally walking away. Even on my breaks, I wasn’t safe.

I tripled down on trying to find a new place of employment. Anywhere that would take me as quickly as possible. I wish I could say I gave it my best effort; I can say it was the best effort I had in me to give. Most of my days off were spent emotionally recovering. I felt sick a lot. I was always tired, no matter how much I slept. I felt hopeless about my current situation and always terrified in the knowledge that I would have to inevitably return to it again the next day. The fear I felt was omnipresent.

I struggled through this for about a month, before something different happened. Coach Oleander called a team meeting early one morning, did his usual round of thanking everyone else for all the work they had done. This time, however, he ended it off by thanking me for ‘being a good team player’. Everyone’s clapping and his sickening smile felt like salt being rubbed in the wound. Before he dismissed everyone back to work, he told us he would be running to the pet store during our lunch today to get roaches for his bearded dragon, and that we shouldn’t expect to get ahold of him for about an hour if we needed anything.

The day had been going well. At least, better than most. Oleander didn’t really bother me all that much, only once stopped at the end of my aisle to ask me how things were coming along. I told him “Great.” With as much confidence and enthusiasm as I could muster. He simply gave me a thumbs up and kept moving on.

Aaliyah hadn’t been scheduled that day and I’d felt bad about being so distant. I decided to sit out in front of the building during my lunch and call her, just to see how she was doing. The late spring was turning into a beautiful early summer, with lush trees blowing in the cool Virginian breeze; casting harsh shadows in the light of the sun that bloomed in the sky like a dandelion. Out front, I ate my ramen and laughed on the phone with her as she told me about the colleges she was applying to and how her parents were obsessed with their fear that she would end up going to a ‘party school’. About three-fourths of the way through my lunch, Coach Oleander passed me on his way back into the building. I couldn’t help but notice he was carrying a box-shaped bag with the Petco logo on the side.

Our store was doing inventory at the time. As someone who had been there for the last five years, the management team entrusted me with handling the on-hand count in the technology closet where we kept the extra computers, tablets, phones, etc. Obviously, this was one of those areas that only Coaches and the Store Manager herself had access to on a regular basis, because it was a high risk for theft. I had to be let in by one of the coaches, who gave me a TC and had me get to work.

It was pretty easy, if not monotonous. All I had to do was scan every single UPC in the room once so there would be an accurate count in our system of exactly how many of each item there was inside. The space itself was just a bit bigger than my apartment bathroom, but all the walls were lined with shelves, each packed with hundreds of boxes; each box I had to not only scan, but make sure I only scanned once. I put on a podcast and fell into a routine of starting at the top of one section, slowly scanning my way down to the bottom, and moving on to the next.

When I was about halfway done… you guessed it. My blood went cold as I felt Coach Oleander’s soul block the way out behind me. I kept my back to him, kept scanning and hoped he would just leave me alone.

“Hey Chloe. How’s it going?” He asked.

“Good.” I said meekly, wanting him to please just go away and let me work.

“That’s good. That’s real good…” His breathing was heavy and I could sense his heartrate was going wild. Whatever he was about to do, it was something he hadn’t done before. “I need you to be *extra* thorough today. Understand?”

I nodded.

“Do you understand, Chloe?”

“Yes Coach…”

At this, he stepped fully into the closet with me. I started to panic as he closed the distance and I quickly realizing he’d brought something else with him that I, in my shaking anxiety, had overlooked before. There was a second soul with him. A very small one…

I turned around now, staring dead into his eyes. They looked hollow. He was staring at me, but in that moment, I wouldn’t have guessed there was anything at all behind them if I hadn’t been able to feel it for myself.

“You’re doing great, Chloe.”

“W- What are you doing?” I asked, voice shaking.

“I’m just checking in with one of my associates.” He said, his hand reaching into his coat pocket and wrapping loosely around the hamster he had within. “Is that not allowed?”

“Please don’t…”

“Don’t what?” His fingers began to tighten into a grip. I felt the hamster squirm and struggle.

“Stop!”

“Chloe, keep your voice down! You’re freaking me out!” He said, fist completely balled around the poor rodent. I felt its teeth sink into his flesh and the flavor of his blood filling its mouth. I felt its little bones snap and its organs collapse as he crushed it to death. I felt its final few seconds as it clung to a life that I also felt fade from its body. I experienced everything the hamster did, and I wanted to scream.

Tears ran down my cheeks and I felt like I was broken. Coach Oleander basked in the experience before turning and walking towards the door.

“Get back to work.”

I reached into my pocket and pulled out the lighter. I took a step towards him and flicked it on, hoping to anything above that I could kill him with a seizure right then and there. Instead, he stopped, soaked in the feeling of the flame, turned around with a friendly smile, and said: “No smoking indoors.”

I spent the next twenty minutes in the bathroom, crying and trying to hold myself together. I felt horrible, gross and afraid. I managed to compose myself somehow, tracked down the store manager upfront near the registers, and told her I was going home. When she asked if I was okay, I told her no and that I was running a fever. She said she hoped I got better soon, and I clocked out.",1,1744246671.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1jvlpc6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jvlpc6/i_think_somethings_wearing_my_elderly_neighbors/,I Think Something’s Wearing My Elderly Neighbor’s Skin,"Jack’s been my neighbor for ten years. Vietnam broke him. Isolation finished the job. I stop by now and then just to make sure he hasn’t rotted into the carpet.

I know what stress looks like. I’ve seen people unravel. I’ve seen dementia hollow out their eyes until nothing’s left but blinking.

But whatever’s inside Jack now—it’s not forgetting.
It’s pretending. Pretending to be Jack.

And it’s doing a damn bad job of it.

He doesn’t have much family. He should be living in a care facility, but no relatives are there to push him in that direction. Just me, pretty much.

I knocked on his door. While I waited and looked around, I made a mental note to come back and trim his grass. Long strands of green weeds swayed like a field of dancers in the wind.

The door opened and I had to stop myself from wincing. He looked bad compared to the last time I saw him.

“Richard,” he said, more as a fact than a greeting.

“I thought I’d bring you some groceries.”

He eyed me up and down, stared at the plastic grocery bags in my hand, then opened the door the rest of the way.

Jack isn’t the warmest of folks, as you can probably surmise. His time in Vietnam sure did a number on him, and the sheer isolation he faced afterward had finished him off. But he reminded me of my wicked old grandpa before he passed away.

And I had a bit of a soft spot for the old liver-spotted bastard.

He glided faster than usual across the floor, dragging behind a length of blankets like a king’s cloak. I couldn’t hear the thump of his feet. It struck me as exceedingly odd. Jack’s slippers tended to smack the floor pretty loud with each step.

His home smelled like dust warmed by sunlight, like the aged ink and brittle paper smell of an old newspaper.

Fly traps hung like orange tongues from the ceiling. Some still had a few prisoners buzzing around inside them.

The visible cracks of his windows had a yellow tint to them. The windows peered through gaps in the curtains, which were drawn long against the intruding sun.

Jack motioned for me to sit down at the dinner table as he rifled through the two white plastic bags I’d brought him.

He seemed more disinterested than usual. Somehow, less chatty.

“Everything okay, Jack?” I asked.

He shot me a glance that said, Why don’t you leave me alone to die in peace.

“Nurse stopped coming by for some reason a couple days back. Now I just gotta get rid of you and the Meals on Wheels fella.”

I cracked a smirk, but his mouth remained firm in place like cut marble on a statue.

His left eye drooped more than usual. The skin on his face didn’t seem to sit quite right.

“Did you have a stroke, Jack? Are you feeling okay?”

Jack smushed the left side of his face back into place like it was putty. It sent a trilling alarm ringing in the back of my mind.

“Stop askin’ so many damn questions. I’m fine. Want a coffee?”

Jack had never offered me a coffee before.

He peered at me now, the left eye he had slid up into position locked in the upper left corner of his eye. Like he was a chameleon, one eye watching me, the other watching the ceiling.

I got up, pretending to check my watch, unmanned by the sight of him. Feeling something deeply wrong about the situation.

“I gotta go. Nice catching up with you.”

I turned to leave, sliding my chair back into its place at the dining table.

“Sure you don’t want a sip of tea?” he asked. When I met his gaze again, at least the one functional eye’s gaze, I saw that his mouth was molded into a smile now. The teeth worked beneath like a llama chewing cud. His lips folded out all wrong.

“You said coffee before. Not tea.”

He nodded vigorously, his head wobbling back and forth like a bobblehead.

“That’s what I meant. Coffee.”

He clicked his teeth, chewing the air.

“Co…Fhh…eee.”

I moved past him and started toward the door. I saw that it wasn’t just the blanket wrapped around him. There was a strange trail of them stretched across the floor.

I spotted a large tube-like protrusion lying in the center of the path of blankets on the floor. I traced its path down toward the open basement door.

“My oxygen tubes,” Jack said, flicking his head back so he moved something beneath the trail of blankets.

Oxygen tubes? Whatever was beneath those blankets had to be as thick as my torso, much longer too.

The hairs on my neck crept up. I flicked open the front door.

“See ya later, Jack. I gotta get home to Nancy, she’s on dinner tonight.”

No reply came from behind me. As I moved to close the door, I saw Jack standing in the hallway threshold beneath the curved doorway bannister.

His head was cocked. His eyes like two dark sunflower seeds, both centered on me. His arms were hung loose at his hips. His back slightly arched. He was silent except for the sound of his breath echoing like the rattle of a mixing pea inside a spray paint can.

His chest moved in and out, slowly. Grinding with each exhale.

I closed the door behind me. My breath caught in my chest like a fish writhing in a net.

Should I have called the cops? What would I even say? “Help me, my neighbor’s acting odd?” Doesn’t exactly scream emergency. I thought maybe it was a stroke at first, but then he rearranged his face. Pretty sure stroke victims aren’t capable of that.

And what about the blankets leading down to his basement? That cylindrical shape running beneath it.

I wanted to get my wife’s opinion before I did anything. I was lucky and happened to marry a woman much smarter than me. She always knew what to do. So I marched back home and waited until dinner was over and the kids were in bed to mention it to her.

We were snuggled up in bed, her nightdress on, the windows open to let the heat in when I broached the subject.

“Honey, I saw something… off today. When I stopped by Jack’s house.”

She flipped around to face me. I could see the sharp angular grooves of her chin in the dark.

“Did he finally kick the bucket?”

I saw a cheeky grin rising on her lips. I couldn’t help but grin too. I couldn’t ever help it when I was looking into her eyes.

“No, no. He’s alive…” I paused. “I think.”

“You think? What the hell does that mean?”

The smile on her lips faltered.

I explained to her how he seemed to glide across the floor, how he dragged a string of blankets behind him. I explained his mannerisms, the sagging face, the way he stood in the threshold of the door.

I felt her soft hand glide against my wrist, and she tucked her fingers into my palm. She squeezed slightly.

“I can tell you aren’t joking,” she said.

“But what you are saying is also batshit insane.”

“So you don’t believe me?” I said, peering into her eyes. The warmth of her body pressed against me.

“I didn’t say that,” she affirmed. “It’s just… bizarre. We’ll stop by tomorrow evening together.”

“No, no. I don’t want you anywhere near that place until I figure out what’s wrong.”

“You shouldn’t have told me about it then,” she said, pressing her forehead into mine.

“I’m sure as hell not going to let you wander into some oozing zombie’s house without me there to protect you.” Her grin grew larger.

“Okay. But you stay near the door. We aren’t going to go inside,” I said firmly.

Nancy’s mind is very literal and mechanical. She needs to chew on data and facts before she can really sink her teeth into a concept. But beneath that, she never doubted me. She just needed to confirm things for herself. That’s what makes her so damn smart.

I fell into a quiet sleep and awoke the next morning, readied myself for work, and spent the day in the office.

Between sips of black coffee and Excel spreadsheets, my thoughts drifted back to Jack. To the misaligned drooping curve of his chin, and the way his body glided across the floor. Full body shivers erupted from me, like I’d just slipped out of a freezing pool.

The time came when I packed up my things from the office into my briefcase and drove home. It was about 6 p.m. My wife was home a couple of hours before me. She’d sent the kids to a babysitter for the evening.

She’d prepared a lasagna to bring over to Jack’s. It was her way of building a valid excuse to go over and see the cranky old bastard. Personally, I’d have just marched over there, but she’d already cooked it.

We walked over, four houses down. A dog barked in the distance, the wind whistled through the leaves of a large oak in his yard. A car I didn’t recognize sat parked out front. It appeared I’d missed it the day before when I’d stopped by.

There was an atmosphere of unease around his home. I assumed it was just in me, but I saw the look on Nancy’s face and immediately knew it wasn’t.

She held the lasagna with one hand and slid the other around my wrist. I rang the doorbell.

Minutes of silence passed. I peered in through a window, but the curtains had been drawn tight.

We turned to walk away when the door flicked open. I peered my head inside. I opened my mouth to say something, but it died in my throat when I saw an empty living room.

Somewhere deep in its wooden bones, the house groaned.

“Stay out here, please,” I asked her, and she gave me a raised eyebrow in response.

“I’m not letting you go in there by yourself,” she said sternly.

“Please. Something’s wrong here. I mean really wrong. I don’t feel good about this.”

She felt the heat from my gaze now, the seriousness in my voice.

“Okay, fine. I’ll stay out here.” She gave in, a little at first, then all at once with a shake of her head.

“If I hear so much as a squeal from you, I’m calling the cops,” she said, wagging a finger in my face.

I planted a kiss on her forehead and wandered inside. I noticed she kept it propped open with the heel of her foot behind me.

The house smelled more humid than it had yesterday. Like a film of pungent, musty residue clung to my skin as I crossed further inside. Like I was a curious little fish wandering into a much larger catfish’s gaping mouth.

I saw the blankets now, scattered about in heaps, mixed with spread-out towels and sheets, encompassing the entire first floor. It was bizarre. Perhaps Parkinson’s? Dementia? Alzheimer’s?

I crossed past the basement door and I nearly tripped over a large vertical lump beneath the ocean of fabric blocking the narrow corridor between the living room and kitchen. I saw that the lump subtly moved beneath the fabric. I saw that it extended far out of the basement door.

I turned to rush back, and Jack was immediately to my left, filling a vacancy leading past the dining room and into the hall leading to Jack’s bedroom.

That crunching of sticky lungs exhaling, the sensation of hot breath on the right side of my neck.

Jack was inches away.

His body rattled slightly like a shaking hand. I flicked my glance over. Jack’s head was a puffy ruin. Sagging flesh, like someone pressed two eyes into a ball of dough. His clothes hung wrong on his body. One arm was much shorter than the other. Jack was enrobed in blankets like a cocoon.

He lifted a drooping hand and pointed toward the basement.

He lifted the other and with unsteady fingers he tore apart fleshy seams where his lips melded together, revealing his sunken teeth.

“Co…hhh…mme.” His teeth clicked like he was chewing on the words.

“Basss…” click “ment.”

He was moving closer now. I watched a trickle of blood run down his folded cheek from the two bleeding sections where he’d pried his lips apart.

I thought I heard the ever so slightest hint of a female scream. I twisted my head toward the basement door.

“Richard?” Nancy called from the front door. “Everything okay in there?”

Jack cracked his neck in Nancy’s direction. I heard a series of three shuddering pops reverberate from his vertebrae. His neck bulged with knobs of bone the size of golf balls.

“Som…one…el…se…” The click of teeth. A predatory sort of drag in his voice. His tiny marble eyes centered over my shoulder onto Nancy.

I slid past him, taking advantage of the momentary pause. I caught a smell of mulch, rotting leaves, a compost pile. I also saw that Jack’s skin was glistening slightly.

Jack didn’t move to intercept me. But I saw his drooping head peer from around the corner behind us. The mass beneath the blankets led to Jack, and it ruffled the edges of the blankets almost imperceptibly.

Nancy set the lasagna inside the doorframe and pulled me outside. She took one last look at Jack and then closed the front door behind us.

“What the fuck?” she asked, looking up into my eyes. “I mean, what the fuck? Is he having an allergic reaction? Do we call the cops?”

I forcefully pulled her from the door. Noticing something red in her hand, I lifted up her wrist when we were halfway across the yard.

“What is that?” I inquired, pointing toward the slipper. Still shaken from seeing Jack’s melting face. The way he peeled apart the flesh where his lips once were like he was shaping clay. Bleeding clay.

“It’s a slipper. A woman’s slipper.” I eyed it with a hint of concern.

Jack has lived alone for over forty years.

As we crossed the street, I recalled something he’d told me yesterday.

Nurse stopped coming by for some reason a couple days back.

Stopped coming by?

I took the slipper from my wife’s hand. I saw the way her fingers trembled.

A woman’s shoe.

The nurse’s shoe.

And if she’d left her shoes there, was that her car out front? The blue Nissan sitting on the curb. I had no idea if it was her car, but I had to check.

Before Nancy could utter another word, I pulled out my phone and called the police. I explained everything, about the shoe. I explained in more nuanced terms about some of his odd behaviors, what I thought was a woman’s scream, and the presence of that car out front.

I watched from the window as a patrol car pulled into our cul-de-sac. They wheeled around and parked behind the blue Nissan.

Two uniformed officers stepped out and wandered up to the door. They knocked. And several minutes passed with no response. The cops peered into each of the front windows covered by blinds, and then they shrugged.

I watched the smaller officer lean in and huddle his hands around the lower right corner of the Nissan’s windshield. He then recorded what I presume was the VIN number, and then they left.

That was it.

I thought about the nurse. About her being in there alone, with whatever contorted thing sat inside that home.

And it was in that moment I knew I was going to do something stupid. Something I couldn’t even tell Nancy about. I knew she’d try to stop me. I was going to break into Jack’s house, slip in through a back window. Step in where the cops couldn’t. But ever since I was a kid, I had a streak for standing up for the little guy.

Even when it led to me getting beaten up too on the school playground. Even in high school, I’d gotten suspended for fighting a senior bullying a kid with cerebral palsy. I gave that fucker a swollen lip for his trouble.

And I imagined that poor nurse. What if she was alive. What if that’s why that thing wearing his skin wanted me to go down there, to hide me away too. Deep in the recesses of that dark basement.

I waited until Nancy was asleep. I could almost hear the lecture she’d give me when I got back. About making stupid decisions. About doing things as a team. But I knew she’d either stop me or want to come along.

In our marriage, it was understood that she was the wise decision maker, and I always listened to her advice. But I was the one who got shit done. If she was a ball-peen hammer, I was a sledgehammer. Somehow, it worked.

Yeah, I’d get an earful if this turned out to be nothing. I’d be embarrassed. She’d chew me a new one. But if I was right? If something truly fucked up was going on inside that home and I let her stop me? Let that nurse suffer in that basement? I’d never swallow it down.

And worse, if she came with me and something happened to her, that would somehow be worse.

I kissed the back of her head, inhaled deeply at the scent of her shampoo—something light and fragrant, like lavender. And I slipped quietly out of bed. I’d set a spare change of clothes in the guest bathroom.

I gave her one last glimpse in the fractured darkness of my room before I closed the door, bracing it with my hand to muffle the click.

I was always getting myself into trouble with this hero shit. I thought I’d left it behind when I nearly got arrested in a bar in college after breaking a pool stick on some pervert’s back when I saw him grope a waitress.

But here I was, years later, with a wife and kids, and I was getting up to my same, tired sense of morality.

I slipped outside as quiet as I could manage, trying to hide my footsteps from the quiet house.

I remembered that scream in the basement. It sounded buried. Layered beneath something. But I had heard it. I hadn’t even mentioned it to Nancy until she overheard me say it to the police.

But I’d heard it. I’d heard something.

I slipped around the back of Jack’s home, intending to break in through a window.

But the back door was open. Wide open. I started to feel the beat of my heart inside the pulse of my neck.

I stepped forward. Every part of me screaming not to. This was a trap. But Jack was an old man. I could fend him off.

As I crept through the doorway into the kitchen, the basement door was close. I stepped over a blue throw blanket and a bunched pile of red towels.

The house was silent as death.

I saw in my mind’s eye Jack tearing open his face to reveal a set of chewing teeth. The trails of blood down either side of his bulbous chin.

Chills ran down my body. The lump in the floor was gone. That large one I’d seen trailing from Jack—not beneath the blankets anymore.

The basement was dark. A smell, coppery and gritty like the fresh air after a hog is butchered and parceled out. The steps were covered in a layer of old bedsheets.

I turned on my phone flashlight, bringing a faint glow to the darkness. It was crushing. Pulverizing darkness creeping at the light’s edges.

The smell grew more intense. An earthy undertow. Crumbling worm-filled soil dried in the sun, smooshed between your fingers.

I rounded the corner, and my heart dropped like a falling elevator until it came crashing down. My body wracked with full-tilt chills.

A pulsing, oscillating mass of pale human flesh. Stretched across the room like a carpet, half buried in a mound of blankets. I saw one female leg sticking out from beneath a shivering fold of flesh, prickled with hair-like cilia. The underside was red, like the red spongy tissue beneath a scab.

The rippling edge tasted the air like a sea slug browsing for food across the ocean floor. Eating.

Attached to it was a red slipper. The partner to the one Nancy had found upstairs.

The basement door slammed shut above me. Above the flight of wooden stairs.

I snapped my gaze away to see what had happened, and my eyes met the drooping form of Jack, hanging upside down from the ceiling above the stairs.

A sagging flesh puppet. Pressed against the door.

I followed the writhing flesh of his body, encased in blankets and sheets, caked together in a hardened fluid turned to a protective layer. Like a caddisfly larva.

A large fleshy appendage like an oversized feeding tube was suctioned to the ceiling of the stairway, encased partially in layers of cloth. Tendrils ran from it like roots, adhering to and stabbing into the drywall. My eyes traced it back down toward the writhing mass of flesh consuming the nurse.

It had moved closer. Inched closer.

My face went cold. I could hear the sound of thousands of tiny prickles—cilia moving and writhing, pushing that creature toward me.

Jack’s uneven arms hung limply above, blocking my escape, his sagging head nearly touching the floor.

“St…ay.” It invited.

I peered around. The space in front of me was blocked by the twisted form of Jack’s puppeteer. A small hallway shot down past the stairwell.

Those sticky tendrils running along Jack’s umbilical tube began leeching down from the ceiling, tasting the air. Looking for me.

I rushed down the narrow hallway, my head flushed with warmth, with panic. I threw myself into a closed door and it rattled against its hinges. I peered behind me. The hallway was no more narrow than myself, and I saw the fleshy visage of Jack crowding the hallway. A hundred thin, veiny prehensile limbs reached out toward me.

I slammed my weight again. A meteor shower of pain bloomed in my vision. My vision wobbled.

I turned, and Jack had somehow crossed half the distance. I could hear the click of teeth above the writhing sound of movement, like a horde of cockroaches behind a wall. It was deafening now. Filling the darkness.

I threw myself a final time and heard the hinges rattle. The lock buckled, and I fell through into some sort of office room.

I knocked over stacks of newspaper, creating a sort of avalanche. I slammed the door shut behind me and twisted the lock.

I tipped over the desk. I felt something pop in my shoulder. A blur of pain bloomed like a rosebud.

The far window sat in a depressed window well. The only source of light in the room. I’d dropped my phone somewhere along the way.

I stared at the door, watched it begin to shudder. Small pale tentacles began crawling beneath the gap. I heard burrowing to my right, something chewing into the wall.

I threw open the window, clawed my way halfway out of the sill, just as the door budged halfway open.

I turned once more. I couldn’t help but eye the horror. This couldn’t have happened. It couldn’t have been real. I told myself over and over again.

I saw Jack’s head pressing through the gap like silly putty. His bones popped to accommodate, leaving behind the shelled, crunchy armor of blankets. A snail breaking through its shell, unwilling to leave behind prey.

His neck squeezed through. It was fleshy toothpaste pushing through a tube. Countless veined arms the size of a baby’s wrist crept around the door’s edges, pushing, clawing. The wood groaned.

I heaved myself up and over the lip of the sill and ran. Heaved myself over the fence like I was a pole vaulter and charged my way back home. When I got home, I locked myself in the bathroom, threw myself on the tile. I sat there, running my hands through the creases in my hair.

Nancy knocked on it. Asked if I was okay.

I lied to her. Said I had a stomach bug. God, that hurts to say. I’ve never lied to her before. But God, what could I say? What could I do?

She opened the door and tried to ask me more. She tried so hard, and I lied right in her face.

But she’s smarter than that. Always has been. She’ll get it out of me one way or another.

I called the police again, I tried to explain what happened. Part of me wonders if this was some sort of delusion? Was I going through an episode of stress-induced psychosis? What will the police find down there. 

I can’t stop imagining the visage of Jack, the man I’d once known, squeezing through a gap in the partially opened door the size of my fist. Unhinging his being. Sliding apart his bones.

And that wasn’t even the worst part.

It’s the frown I saw carved deep in the groove of his mouth. The pleading look in those beady insect eyes.

It was the way his mouth opened up right before I slipped through the window and said,

“Please… He…lp… me.”

Like there was a piece of him still left alive inside of that thing.
