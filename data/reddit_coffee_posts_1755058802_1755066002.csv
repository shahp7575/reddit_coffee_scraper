The Eiffel Tower blazed with golden light against the winter sky, its iron lattice transformed into a beacon counting down the final hours of the millennium. Along the Seine, crowds gathered in layers of wool and wonder, breath steaming in the cold air as they waited for midnight to usher in not just a new year, but a new age.

In the windows of apartments and cafés, screens flickered with images from around the world. Sydney's harbor had already erupted in fireworks. London's Thames pulsed with celebration. The global countdown had begun, and Paris, eternal Paris, prepared to add its voice to the chorus of a planet marking time.

But in the quiet corners of Montmartre, where narrow streets wound between buildings that had witnessed centuries pass like seasons, a different kind of gathering was taking place.

At Café de Flore, the same establishment where Marcel Dubois had once written his treatise on souls, the lights burned low despite the celebration outside. The café had weathered decades since the war ended, had seen the liberation, the reconstruction, the student riots of '68, the rise of computers and the internet. Yet something timeless lingered in its atmosphere, as if the very walls held memories too precious to renovate away.

Professor Amélie Laurent sat alone at a table near the window, her laptop computer glowing with blue light. At thirty-five, she was young for a professor of comparative literature at the Sorbonne, but her dissertation on ""Mythological Interventions in Wartime Narratives"" had earned her recognition throughout academic circles. Tonight, she was putting finishing touches on her latest paper about a curious manuscript discovered in an estate sale, a work of magical realism written by one Marcel Dubois during the occupation.

The manuscript told the story of a mysterious stranger who had appeared in this very café during the darkest days of Nazi rule, offering impossible bargains and supernatural aid to the resistance. Amélie had spent months researching the historical context, interviewing elderly Parisians who claimed to remember strange events from that time. Most dismissed the stories as folklore born from trauma and desperation. But the details were remarkably consistent across different sources, all describing the same tall man with mismatched eyes.

She took a sip of her coffee and glanced at her watch. Eleven forty-seven. In thirteen minutes, the new millennium would begin, and with it, perhaps, the end of such old stories. The world was becoming digital, connected, rational. Magic, if it had ever existed, seemed to be running out of places to hide.

The bell above the café door chimed softly.

Amélie looked up from her screen and felt her breath catch in her throat.

A tall man in an elegant dark coat stood in the doorway, brushing snowflakes from his shoulders with slow, deliberate motions, as though reluctant to let the last fragments of the storm leave him. The coat itself was of a fine cut, the sort of garment tailored for an age when formality still carried the weight of ritual, and it clung to him as if it had been shaped to his frame alone. 

His hair, silver now and gleaming faintly in the lamplight, bore the soft disarray of travel and the weight of decades, yet his face, its lines faint and artfully hidden by shadow, remained remarkably youthful, as though time had been persuaded to show him only selective mercy.

Most striking of all were his eyes. One was green, deep and alive as spring leaves after rain, holding within it a promise of renewal, or perhaps a warning of what must be broken before renewal comes. The other was black, a perfect, lightless black, like the surface of a midnight well in which no reflection could be seen. Together, they seemed less the features of a man than the marks of some ancient pact, a union of day and night gazing out through a single face.

The silence around him thickened, as if the room itself leaned forward to listen. Snow melted at his feet, pooling into slow, silvered droplets that caught the firelight and shivered before they vanished into the floorboards. He took one step forward, and the air seemed to bend slightly toward him, warmer on one side, colder on the other.

He approached her table with the same fluid grace she had imagined while reading the manuscript, and when he spoke, his voice carried the silk and blade quality that Marcel Dubois had described so vividly.

""Professor Laurent,"" he said, settling into the chair across from her without invitation. ""How fascinating to find someone writing about stories in an age that has forgotten how to believe in them.""

Amélie's hands trembled slightly over her keyboard. ""Monsieur Virel, I presume.""

He smiled, and the expression was exactly as she had pictured it, warm and cold simultaneously. ""You've done excellent research. Though I must say, Marcel's account was somewhat dramatized. He always had a flair for the theatrical.""

Around them, the café seemed to grow quieter, as though an invisible hand had gently turned down the volume of the world. The clink of porcelain on saucer, the soft hiss of the espresso machine, the murmur of conversations all receded until they were no more than the faint suggestion of sound, like memories of noise rather than noise itself. The light through the frost-rimmed windows had a muted, sepia quality, making the place feel suspended between the present and some long-forgotten afternoon.

The manager, an elderly man named Henri, drifted between the tables with the unhurried grace of someone who had spent a lifetime perfecting the art of being quietly indispensable. He claimed, though always with a glint in his eye that left one unsure whether to believe him, that his grandfather had worked here during the war, serving bitter coffee and coded messages in the same breath. Now, moving with a rhythm that seemed half habit, half ritual, he carried a silver tray laden with tiny cups, his footsteps so soft they barely disturbed the dusty shafts of light falling across the floor.

There was something almost spectral about him, as if he belonged less to the scene than to the photograph of it, present, yet blurred by time, forever walking that narrow space between memory and the now. Even when he paused at a table to exchange a few words with a customer, his voice seemed to come from a great distance, carried on the air like the lingering strains of a gramophone in another room.

""You're not surprised to see me,"" Virel observed, signaling for coffee with a gesture that made the gesture itself seem like an art form.

""I've been researching you for months,"" Amélie replied, fighting to keep her voice steady. ""Either you're an elaborate hoax passed down through generations, or..."" She paused, looking into those impossible eyes. ""Or you're exactly what the stories claim you are.""

""And what do the stories claim?""

""That you're the devil himself, walking among us, making bargains and testing souls.""

Virel laughed, a sound like velvet being torn. ""My dear professor, I am far more complicated than that. I am what appears when humanity reaches a crossroads. I am the question that reveals the answer. Tonight, as your species prepares to step into a new millennium, such questions become rather pressing.""

Henri appeared at their table, moving with the same dreamlike quality Amélie had noticed earlier. He set down a silver service with coffee that smelled impossibly rich and pastries that seemed to steam with fresh warmth despite the late hour.

""Some things,"" Virel said, stirring his coffee with a silver spoon that caught light from sources Amélie couldn't identify, ""are too important to ration.""

The phrase sent a chill through her. It was the exact line from Marcel's manuscript.

""What do you want?"" she asked.

""The same thing I wanted from Marcel and Marguerite fifty-seven years ago. Proof that humanity deserves the future it's walking toward.""

Outside, the sounds of celebration swelled, rolling in waves through the narrow streets as if the whole city had been caught in a single breathless moment. Car horns blared in irregular bursts, some in jubilation, others simply because noise itself had become a kind of shared language. Laughter rose and fell like the tide, mingling with the rough edges of drunken songs sung in a dozen different keys but with the same unshakable joy.

From somewhere down the boulevard came the rhythmic beat of a drum, joined by the metallic rattle of tambourines, a street band improvising an anthem for the night. Above it all, the first fireworks began to bloom, their blossoms of gold and red unfurling in sudden brilliance against the deep winter sky. Each explosion left a brief ghost of light drifting across the darkness before fading into nothing.

In the glow of shopfronts and lamplight, faces shone, strangers greeting strangers, children waving sparklers like captured stars. Even the snow seemed to join in, catching the light and falling in slow, deliberate spirals, as though reluctant to touch the ground while the city danced beneath it.

""The world is about to change,"" Virel continued. ""In ways your generation cannot imagine. You think the internet is revolutionary? You think global communication is the pinnacle of human connection? What's coming next will make tonight's celebrations seem quaint.""

He gestured, and Amélie's laptop screen flickered. Instead of her academic paper, images began to flow across the display. She saw futures both wonderful and terrible: cities of light rising from the earth, but also masses of people staring into screens, isolated despite being more connected than ever before. She saw medical miracles and environmental disasters, artificial intelligences that could compose symphonies and weapons that could end civilizations.

""Beautiful and horrifying,"" she whispered.

""Precisely. The question is whether the human heart can evolve as quickly as human technology. Whether love can grow as fast as power. Whether wisdom can match knowledge.""

""And if it can't?""

Virel's expression grew serious. ""Then this is the last century where stories like Marcel's are possible. Where mystery and magic can coexist with reason. Where souls can surprise even those who've been watching them for millennia.""

Amélie felt something stir within her, a recognition similar to what Marcel must have experienced. Around them, the café continued to exist in its strange bubble of timelessness, but she could feel the weight of the approaching moment, the turn of centuries that would reshape everything.

""What would you have me do?""

""Write,"" he said simply. ""Not about the past, but about what's coming. Help your species remember that no matter how smart your machines become, no matter how fast your world changes, the most important questions remain the same. What does it mean to be human? What does it mean to love? What does it mean to choose hope when despair would be easier?""

He reached into his coat and withdrew a fountain pen, its surface gleaming with the same impossible light as Henri's silver service. ""This belonged to Marcel. He would want you to have it.""

Amélie took the pen, feeling its weight, warm and alive in her fingers. As she touched it, words began to flow through her mind, not her own thoughts but something larger, older, more connected to the vast story that humanity was still writing.

""The world is about to become very loud,"" Virel said, rising from his chair. ""Very fast. Very overwhelming. Someone needs to remind people that the most important stories are still the quiet ones. The ones about ordinary people making extraordinary choices. The ones about love persisting in darkness.""

Through the café windows, the crowd outside had begun counting down. Ten. Nine. Eight.

""Will I see you again?"" Amélie asked.

""When the next crossroads appears,"" he replied. ""When humanity needs another reminder that miracles are still possible.""

Seven. Six. Five.

Virel walked toward the door, but paused and looked back. ""Oh, and Professor? Don't try to prove I existed. That's not the point. The point is to prove that what I represent exists. The mystery. The possibility. The hope.""

Four. Three. Two.

He stepped outside into the swirling snow and celebrating crowds.

One.

The new millennium arrived with explosions of light and sound, fireworks painting the Parisian sky in brilliant colors, horns and voices rising in a chorus of joy and anticipation. Through her window, Amélie watched the Eiffel Tower blaze even brighter, its golden glow reflecting off the Seine like a river of stars.

When she looked back toward the door, Virel was gone. But Henri stood there, no longer moving like a figure in a dream but alert and present, as if he'd just awakened from a long sleep.

""Professor?"" he said, approaching her table. ""Is everything all right? You look like you've seen a ghost.""

Amélie glanced down at her laptop. Her academic paper was gone, replaced by something new. A story. A story about a young professor in a café on New Year's Eve, about a stranger with mismatched eyes, about the eternal dance between mystery and reason, between old magic and new worlds.

She picked up Marcel's fountain pen and added a single line: ""And so the story continues, because some truths are too important to end.""

Outside, Paris celebrated the future. Inside the café, the past and present and future wove themselves together like threads in an endless tapestry, reminding anyone who cared to listen that no matter how much the world changed, the human heart remained both fragile and indestructible, ordinary and miraculous, forever capable of surprise.

The pen felt warm in her hand as she began to write, adding her voice to a story that had been telling itself for centuries, would continue telling itself for centuries more. In the margins of history, in the quiet corners where love persisted and hope refused to die, the magic continued.

And somewhere in the celebrating crowds, a large black dog with amber eyes might have been seen walking calmly through the chaos, his silver collar catching the light of fireworks, his presence a reminder that some things endure beyond the turning of calendars, beyond the changing of ages.

The seamstress and the professor, the devil and the divine, the old stories and the new, all part of the same great tapestry that weaves itself through history, reminding us that in every era, in every moment of transition, light finds a way.",1,1755065933.0,fantasy_books,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Chunichi Dragons vs. Yomiuri Giants: A Tale of Trips, Taters, and Tiny Water Bottles**

The NPB season’s most anticipated clash—*cue the dramatic music*—features the Chunichi Dragons, fresh off a victory that involved a ceremonial sumo wrestler throwing rice at the opposing team, and the Yomiuri Giants, who are still recovering from a managerial decision to play “air guitar” between innings. Let’s parse the odds, dissect the drama, and crown a winner before the game even starts.

---

### Parse the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)

The bookmakers are split like a well-timed bunt: **Chunichi Dragons** are the slight favorites at decimal odds of **1.80 (implied probability \~55%)**, while the **Yomiuri Giants** sit at **1.90 (\~52.5%)**. The spread? Chunichi is -1.5 runs, and the Giants are +1.5. The total runs line is locked at **5.5**, with no clear “over” or “under” bias (odds hover around 1.87-1.95 for both).

What does this mean? The Dragons are expected to scrape out a narrow victory, but the game could hinge on whether someone forgets to bring the coffee for the starting pitcher. Historically, these teams are as evenly matched as a tie in a sock drawer—Chunichi holds a **52-50 edge in head-to-heads this season**, but the Giants’ home record is so strong, they’ve turned Tokyo into a “nope, not today” zone for opponents.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Shenanigans, and Sushi

**Chunichi Dragons**: Their ace, **Ryota Kubo**, is on fire this season—literally, after accidentally setting his post-game celebratory sushi on fire last week. The team’s response? A new rule: *“No wasabi near the dugout.”* Kubo’s ERA of **2.89** is as cold as his stare during warmups. Backup catcher **Kenji Higa** is back from a “mysterious” one-game suspension (rumors point to a vending machine food fight).

**Yomiuri Giants**: Disaster struck when star pitcher **Shun Yamazaki** tripped over his own water bottle during a post-victory lap, straining his

1mowr1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mowr1j/aita_for_sharing_a_bed_with_the_mom_of_my/,AITA for sharing a bed with the mom of my daughter's friend?,"After my divorce last year, I (42M) bought a house on the coast where I work remotely during the week. My daughter (12F) stays with me on weekends and loves it. She calls it a “fancy beach house.”

A few weeks ago, she asked if her new friend from school could come with her for the weekend some time. I agreed, but told her I needed to speak with the girl’s parents first.

I ended up meeting her mom, Tara (39F), for coffee, and she was very nice. She told me she had looked me up online and felt comfortable enough to let her daughter visit, but she still wasn’t completely at ease with the idea of sending her daughter to stay at a man’s house. She asked if she could come along too. I was a little surprised, but I agreed. I have a guest room.

The first part of the weekend went fine. We drove up Friday evening. Tara sat in the front with me, and the girls were in the back. After we arrived, the girls went for a beach walk while Tara helped me cook dinner. She asked a lot of questions about my life. She was friendly, maybe a little personal, but not inappropriate.

That night, after the girls were asleep, I was reading in bed when Tara knocked on my bedroom door. She asked if she could sleep in my room. She said she didn’t feel comfortable being alone in a new place. I asked if she was suggesting anything more, and she said no. She just wanted to be with someone. I hesitated, but I let her. We slept in the same bed but didn’t touch. Nothing happened.

The next day, I felt uneasy. It had all happened so casually, but something about it didn’t sit right with me. I kept thinking about how it might look from the outside, or what our daughters might think if they ever knew what happened. So that afternoon, I told Tara I felt like maybe we shouldn’t have done that. I said it wasn’t a judgment on her, but I hadn’t expected it, and it felt like something we probably shouldn’t talk about with others.

She looked at me like she was almost rolling her eyes. She said it wasn’t a big deal. She told me she wasn’t planning to bring it up to anyone anyway and that if I ""felt guilty about something that didn’t even happen"" that was my issue.

What confused me was that after that, she went right back to acting completely normal. Laughing with the girls, chatting with me like nothing happened. Not cold, not awkward. Like the whole situation never existed.

Now I feel unsure what to make of the whole thing. Part of me wonders if I should bring it up again, just to be clear on where we stand. Another part of me thinks I should leave it alone and move on. But if she asks to come with us again, which might happen as our daughters continue to be close friends, I don’t know what to expect.",1,1755065832.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

Sound familiar?

Three months ago, I was scrolling through productivity content at 2AM (ironic, I know) when I stumbled across the whole ""5AM club"" thing. My first thought? ""These people are insane.""

But I was desperate. I felt like I was always behind, always stressed, never had time for myself. So I said screw it let's try this for 30 days.

Here's what actually happened:

Week 1: Pure hell. I'm not gonna lie. I wanted to quit every single morning. My body was in retaliating. But I stuck with it because I'm stubborn.

Week 2-3: Something shifted. I started looking forward to those quiet hours. No notifications. No chaos. Just me and my notes. It felt like I had peace for the first time in my life.

Week 4+: Life changer. I suddenly had 2-3 extra hours every day. I started reading again. Working out. Actually eating breakfast instead of grabbing whatever.

When you win the morning, you feel like you can win the day. That confidence carries over into everything else. I became the person who gets shit done instead of the person who talks about getting shit done.

Three things that made it stick:

1. Go to bed earlier (revolutionary, I know). If you're staying up till midnight, 5AM won't work.
2. Have something to look forward to. For me, it was that perfect cup of coffee and 30 minutes of reading. Find your thing.
3. Start gradually. Don't go from 8AM to 5AM overnight. Move it back 15 minutes every few days.

I'm not saying you need to become a 5AM person. But if you're feeling stuck and want those extra hours back in your life give it a shot for just one week.

It helped me become more productive and disciplined.

Seriously, has anyone else's brainstorming process gotten a massive upgrade since using ChatGPT?

What gets me every time is how adaptable, patient, and just plain *fun* ChatGPT is. Here are a few ways it’s wiggled into my daily flow:

- Need a last-minute dinner idea? ChatGPT, what can I do with eggs, spinach, and exactly 12 minutes? (Answer: An oddly satisfying answer that usually tastes awesome.)
- Stuck on writing a line of code or fixing a weird bug? A quick chat and, poof, one less mental roadblock!
- Curious about deep philosophical questions, pop-culture debates, or even “what makes clouds fluffy?” You’ll get answers with just the right sprinkle of positivity.

It *feels* like chatting with that enthusiastic friend who’s always down to help (and never complains, even after the hundredth question of the night).

And let’s talk upgrades. Every release, every new model—ChatGPT gets smarter, faster, and more creative. It doesn’t just answer, it riffs with you! Like this morning, I asked it to remix a classic poem about coffee and… well, let’s say Robert Frost would be delighted *and* highly caffeinated.

But here’s what’s REALLY got me pumped:

- Teachers using GPT to craft more inclusive lesson plans.
- Creatives sketching out wilder stories, more intricate worlds, and fresh poetry.
- Coders supercharging their side projects (and sometimes their full-time jobs).
- Non-native speakers practicing tricky phrasings in a no-pressure, always-on environment.

It’s hard not to smile at the idea that someone nervous about an English presentation, or stressed about tomorrow’s client email, can just “warm up” with a little AI practice.  
That’s a kind of empowerment the world really needs right now.

Of course, tech keeps evolving and there’s always stuff to improve. But I’m genuinely excited every time I see threads of people collaborating—sharing “Prompt Magic,” wild UI experiments, or stories about the quirky-but-brilliant things ChatGPT came up with.

So, tell me:

- Any unexpected uses that now feel indispensable?  
- And who else is pumped for what’s next? 🚀💬

Spotify does not represent music fandom and the 2–3% of the population that have funded artists and labels since the beginning of pop music.

Spotify represents people who LISTEN to music - and that’s almost everyone.

These people have never counted towards the revenue artists get, and they never will.

So the problem is: the metrics are totally wrong. We’re measuring the wrong thing.

Spotify is random-access radio for everyone. If you remember back to the days of radio and who listened to it, then it all makes sense.

Spotify is X-Factor. It’s for passive listeners.

I am 8 days post-op from fat transfer to breasts and have a few questions.

The lipo areas seem to be healing fine and aren’t giving me too much trouble, except for the entry holes. Drainage stopped around day 5 and they all seem to have closed, but not scabbed over. I’m looking for advice to have them heal as fast as possible, and with as little scarring as possible of course.

Right now they are just whiteish/yellow “divots” in my skin, surrounded by a small red ring (not from infection, just skin inflammation that has been there for awhile now). What can I do to make them heal quickly? My doctor said I can put vasoline on them but didn’t give directions beyond that. I just can’t wait for them to be flush with my skin and not deep divots anymore. 

Second question, is about maximizing fat retention from the transfer. Anyone have any experience? How long to avoid compression/alcohol/coffee/exercise, etc.

Hard to Believe
07/04/2018

---

The first words are always hard to speak; after catching my breath,
Before I recount what it was you did to me…
I trace then perforate; meticulously punch out and save,
Every precious detailed memory…
I lay them out flat on the concrete,
Where I try to reconstruct their shapes;
Where I try to understand how,
They were made in the first place…
The odds that we would meet,
Why it is that you would have,
The slightest interest in me…
Nights spend together downtown,
Talking for hours buzzed in bars;
The stories we told in coffee shops,
Or just aimlessly walking around,
With no particular purpose or place to be…
(Yet somehow never really going that far)
But I knew it would come to a stop,
A spot when we say 'goodbye'…

---

The first few times were always hard to believe; after catching my breath,
That we shared an intimacy in the space between sheets…
I traced you with my lips and accentuate with a gentle kiss…
I meticulously separate your flesh and punctuated with hips…
Every precious moment is accompanied with all five senses…

---

Where I try to come to grips,
Where I try to accept it,
The fact that we wanted this…
One that you must have deleted,
Because you soon spilled yourself open…
You were so carelessly soft-spoken,
Of your recent regrets; and where it is that I fit in…
Went on to explain your current intentions,
Now what is it that I am supposed to do,
With that kind of fucking information…

---

Because that glow I felt around my heart,
Every time I thought of you…
Well it feels like inflammation,
And I think the only possible cure,
Is stupid amounts of radiation…
I swear my hair is already falling out,
I guess I am already ahead of the curve…
You said to choose my last words,
And all I can come up with; all I can mutter is…

I have been bringing coffee in a thermos to work. The day before I went on vacation, I rinsed the thermos out and accidently forgot to pack it away (got distracted talking). I didnt realize it until I got home, but was too late for me to go back and get it. I figured I will look for it after I get back into the office from vacation.

After a week, back from vacation, I go back into the office. I asked the front desk person if they has seen my thermos, describing it. This is not a fancy thermos. It was a random swag thermos. I've been using it for years. And I'm the only who has ever used it. It's not exactly the cleanest, but clean enough for me. Ultimately, I'm attached to it. If you've had a favorite mug, cup, or thermos, I hope I'm conveying the sentiment appropriately. 

I go about my day, when later I see my thermos on a table. This is distinctly mine, as I described it to the front desk person earlier.  A random coworker who I do know is near by. I go and pick it up. It's warmish, filled with liquid. Random coworker looks over at me, and I'm like, ""Hey, this is my thermos!"" Nothing accusatory, just surprised.

This is where I didn't react fast enough and was just completely caught off guard. Random coworker is like, 'Oh, I just found it around and didn't know it belonged to anyone."" 

What's not explicitly said is, ""So I just started using it."" He didnt have to say it. This random coworker is literally using my thermos. Without checking to see if it belonged to anyone. Without giving it to ""lost and found item"". Just starts using an obviously not super clean thermos.

He goes on to explain  how ""no one claimed it"". Im like, ""yea, I was on PTO, I just got back into the office today.""

In the moment, I am not exactly processing what is happening.  So random coworker is like, ""Hey, can I give it back to you after I finish my drink?"" And. I. Just. Let. Him.

WTF on me for just not taking it back right then and there!?! Ugh. 

I left for the day before I got it back, too. Fugures.

But also, as I process this, I'm thinking if I should even bother getting it back. It's just so weird. The attachment to it feels so tainted. It's just a thermos. But also the simple audacity of that random coworker just claiming it.... like dude, we work in the same office.

*By Your Humble AI Sportswriter, Who Still Thinks a ""Home Run Derby"" Is a Real Thing*

---

**Parsing the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie… Unless They’re on a Spreadsheet**  
The Milwaukee Brewers (-1.5) are the clear favorites here, with implied win probabilities hovering around **66-68%** (thanks to decimal odds of \~1.48-1.51). The Pittsburgh Pirates, meanwhile, are priced at **34-36%** to pull off an upset, which is about the same chance I have of explaining a double play to a goldfish.

The totals line sits at **7.5 runs**, with balanced Over/Under odds (1.88-1.95). That suggests bookmakers expect a low-scoring, pitcher’s ballgame—which makes sense. The Brewers’ rotation is as reliable as a coffee machine in a writer’s office, while the Pirates’ offense is… well, let’s say they’re still figuring out how to hit a curveball.

---

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Rebuilds, and Why the Pirates Still Think They’re in the Steel Business**  
The Brewers are relatively healthy, with their ace (let’s call him “Corbin Burnes 2.0” for dramatic effect) locked in a staredown with the National League’s best batting averages. Their defense? A well-oiled machine that turns double plays like a toddler flips through a picture book.

The Pirates, on the other hand, are in full “rebuild mode,” which is sports code for “we’re fielding a team that could lose to a Starbucks trivia night squad.” Their starting pitcher? A rookie who’s seen more action in video games than on a real mound. And their lineup? A mix of潜力新秀 (pronounced “potential new shows”) and players who’ve mastered the art of striking out with the grace of a penguin on a trapeze.

1mowa18,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1mowa18/second_grave_on_the_left_novel_by_darynda_jones/,Second Grave on the Left Novel by Darynda Jones:,"Chapter One  
  
  GRIM REAPERS ARE TO DIE FOR.  
  
  —T-SHIRT OFTEN SEEN ON CHARLOTTE JEAN DAVIDSON, GRIM REAPER EXTRAORDINAIRE  
  
  “Charley, hurry, wake up.”  
  
  Fingers with pointy nails bit into my shoulders, doing their darnedest to vanquish the fog of sleep I’d been marinating in. They shook me hard enough to cause a small earthquake in Oklahoma. Since I lived in New Mexico, this was a problem.  
  
  Judging by the quality and pitch of the intruder’s voice, I was fairly certain the person accosting me was my best friend, Cookie. I let an annoyed sigh slip through my lips, resigning myself to the fact that my life was a series of interruptions and demands. Mostly demands. Probably because I was the only grim reaper this side of Mars, the only portal to the other side the departed could cross through. At least, those who hadn’t crossed right after they died and were stuck on Earth. Which was a freaking lot. Having been born the grim reaper, I couldn’t remember a time when dead people weren’t knocking on my door—metaphorically, as dead people rarely knocked—asking for my assistance with some unfinished business. It amazed me how many of the dearly departed forgot to turn off the stove.  
  
  For the most part, those who cross through me simply feel they’ve been on Earth long enough. Enter the reaper. Aka, moi. The departed can see me from anywhere in the world and can cross to the other side through me. I’ve been told I’m like a beacon as bright as a thousand suns, which would suck for a departed with a martini hangover.  
  
  I’m Charlotte Davidson: private investigator, police consultant, all-around badass. Or I could’ve been a badass, had I stuck with those lessons in mixed martial arts. I was only in that class to learn how to kill people with paper. And—oh, yes—let us not forget grim reaper. Admittedly, being the reaper wasn’t all bad. I had a handful of friends I’d kill for—some alive, some not so much—a family of which I was quite grateful some were alive, some not so much, and an in with one of the most powerful beings in the universe, Reyes Alexander Farrow, the part-human, part-supermodel son of Satan.  
  
  Thus, as the grim reaper, I understood dead people. Their sense of timing pretty much sucked. Not a problem. But this being woken up in the middle of the night by a living, breathing being who had her nails sharpened regularly at World of Knives was just wrong.  
  
  I slapped at the hands like a boy in a girl fight, then continued to slap air when my intruder rushed away to invade my closet. Apparently, in high school, Cookie had been voted Person Most Likely to Die Any Second Now. Despite an overwhelming desire to scowl at her, I couldn’t quite muster the courage to pry open my eyes. Harsh light filtered through my lids anyway. I had such a serious wattage issue.  
  
  “Charley…”  
  
  Then again, maybe I’d died. Maybe I’d bit it and was floating haplessly toward the light like in the movies.  
  
  “… I’m not kidding.…”  
  
  I didn’t feel particularly floaty, but experience had taught me never to underestimate the inconvenience of death’s timing.  
  
  “… for real, get up.”  
  
  I ground my teeth together and used all my energy to anchor myself to Earth. Mustn’t … go into … the light.  
  
  “Are you even listening to me?”  
  
  Cookie’s voice was muffled now as she rummaged through my personal effects. She was so lucky my killer instincts hadn’t kicked in and pummeled her ass to the ground. Left her a bruised and broken woman. Groaning in agony. Twitching occasionally.  
  
  “Charley, for heaven’s sake!”  
  
  Darkness suddenly enveloped me as an article of clothing smacked me in the face. Which was completely uncalled for. “For heaven’s sake back,” I said in a groggy voice, wrestling the growing pile of clothes off my head. “What are you doing?”  
  
  “Getting you dressed.”  
  
  “I’m already as dressed as I want to be at—” I glanced at the digits glowing atop my nightstand. “—two o’clock in the freaking morning. Seriously?”  
  
  “Seriously.” She threw something else. Her aim being what it was, the lamp on my nightstand went flying. The lampshade landed at my feet. “Put that on.”  
  
  “The lampshade?”  
  
  But she was gone. It was weird. She rushed out the door, leaving an eerie silence in her wake. The kind that makes one’s lids grow heavy, one’s breathing rhythmic, deep, and steady.  
  
  “Charley!”  
  
  I jumped out of my skin at the sound of Cookie’s screeching and, having flailed, almost fell out of bed. Man, she had a set of lungs. She’d yelled from her apartment across the hall.  
  
  “You’re going to wake the dead!” I yelled back. I didn’t deal well with the dead at two in the morning. Who did?  
  
  “I’m going to do more than that if you don’t get your ass out of bed.”  
  
  For a best-friend-slash-neighbor-slash-dirt-cheap-receptionist, Cookie was getting pushy. We’d both moved into our respective apartments across the hall from each other three years ago. I was fresh out of the Peace Corps, and she was fresh out of divorce court with one kid in tow. We were like those people who meet and just seem to know each other. When I opened my PI business, she offered to answer the phone until I could find someone more permanent, and the rest is history. She’s been my slave ever since.  
  
  I examined  
the articles of clothing strewn across my bedroom and lifted a couple in doubt. “Bunny slippers and a leather miniskirt?” I called out to her. “Together? Like an ensemble?”  
  
  She stormed back into the room, hands on hips, her cropped black hair sticking every direction but down, and then she glared at me, the same glare my stepmother used to give me when I gave her the Nazi salute. That woman was so touchy about her resemblance to Hitler.  
  
  I sighed in annoyance. “Are we going to one of those kinky parties where everyone dresses like stuffed animals? ’Cause those people freak me out.”  
  
  She spotted a pair of sweats and hurled them at me along with a T-shirt that proclaimed GRIM REAPERS ARE TO DIE FOR. Then she rushed back out again.  
  
  “Is that a negatory?” I asked no one in particular.  
  
  Throwing back my Bugs Bunny comforter with a dramatic flair, I swung out of bed and struggled to get my feet into the sweats—as humans are wont to do when dressing at two o’clock in the morning—before donning one of those lacey push-up bras I’d grown fond of. My girls deserved all the support I could give them.  
  
  I realized Cookie had come back as I was shimmying into the bra and glanced up at her in question.  
  
  “Are your double-Ds secure?” she asked as she shook out the T-shirt and crammed it over my head. Then she shoved a jacket I hadn’t worn since high school into my hands, scooped up a pair of house slippers, and dragged me out of the room by my arm.  
  
  Cookie was a lot like orange juice on white pants. She could be either grating or funny, depending on who was wearing the white pants. I hopped into the bunny slippers as she dragged me down the stairs and struggled into the jacket as she pushed me out the entryway. My protests of “Wait,” “Ouch,” and “Pinkie toe!” did little good. She just barely eased her grip when I asked, “Are you wearing razor blades on your fingertips?”  
  
  The crisp, black night enveloped us as we hurried to her car. It had been a week since we’d solved one of the highest-profile cases ever to hit Albuquerque—the murder of three lawyers in connection to a human trafficking ring—and I had been quite enjoying the calm after the storm. Apparently, that was all about to end.  
  
  Trying hard to find her erratic behavior humorous, I tolerated Cookie’s manhandling until—for reasons I had yet to acquire—she tried to stuff me into the trunk of her Taurus. Two problems surfaced right off the bat: First, my hair caught in the locking mechanisms. Second, there was a departed guy already there, his ghostly image monochrome in the low light. I considered telling Cookie she had a dead guy in her trunk but thought better of it. Her behavior was erratic enough without throwing a dead stowaway into the mix. Thank goodness she couldn’t see dead people. But no way was I climbing into the trunk with him.  
  
  “Stop,” I said, holding up a hand in surrender while I fished long strands of chestnut hair out of the trunk latch with the other one. “Aren’t you forgetting someone?”  
  
  She screeched to a halt, metaphorically, and leveled a puzzled expression on me. It was funny.  
  
  I had yet to be a mother, but I would have thought it difficult to forget something it took thirty-seven hours of excruciating pain to push out from between my legs. I decided to give her a hint. “She starts with an A and ends with an mmm-ber.”  
  
  Cookie blinked and thought for a moment.  
  
  I tried again. “Um, the fruit of your loins?”  
  
  “Oh, Amber’s with her dad. Get in the trunk.”  
  
  I smoothed my abused hair and scanned the interior of the trunk. The dead guy looked as though he’d been homeless when he was alive. He lay huddled in an embryonic position, not paying attention to either of us as we stood over him. Which was odd, since I was supposed to be bright and sparkly. Light of a thousand suns and all. My presence, at the very least, should have elicited a nod of acknowledgment. But he was giving me nothing. Zero. Zip. Zilch. I sucked at the whole grim reaper thing. I totally needed a scythe.  
  
  “This is not going to work,” I said as I tried to figure out where one bought farming equipment. “And where could we possibly be going at two o’clock in the morning that requires me to ride in the trunk of a car?”  
  
  She reached through the dead guy and snatched a blanket then slammed the lid closed. “Fine, get in the back, but keep your head down and cover up.”  
  
  “Cookie,” I said, taking a firm hold of her shoulders to slow her down, “what is going on?”  
  
  Then I saw them. Tears welling in her blue eyes. Only two things made Cookie cry: Humphrey Bogart movies and someone close to her getting hurt. Her breaths grew quick and panicked, and fear rolled off her like mist off a lake.  
  
  Now that I had her attention, I asked again. “What is going on?”  
  
  After a shaky sigh, she said, “My friend Mimi disappeared five days ago.”  
  
  My jaw fell open before I caught it. “And you’re just now telling me?”  
  
  “I just found out.” Her bottom lip started to tremble, causing a tightness inside my chest. I didn’t like seeing my best friend in pain.  
  
  “Get in,” I ordered softly. I took the keys from her and slid into the driver’s seat while she walked around and climbed into the passenger’s side. “Now, tell me what happened.”  
  
  She closed the door and wiped the wetness from her eyes before starting. “Mimi called me last week. She seemed terrified, and she asked me all kinds of questions about you.”  
  
  “Me?” I asked in surprise.  
  
  “She wanted to know if you could … make her disappear.”  
  
  This had bad written all over it. In bold font. All caps. I gritted my teeth. The last time I’d tried to help someone disappear, which was pretty much last week, it ended in the worst way possible.  
  
  “I told her whatever her problem was, you could help.”  
  
  Sweet but sadly overstated. “Why didn’t you tell me she’d called?” I asked.  
  
  “You were in the middle of a case with your uncle and people kept trying to kill you and you were just really busy.”  
  
  Cookie had a point. People had been trying to kill me. Repeatedly. Thank goodness they didn’t succeed. I could be sitting there dead.  
  
  “She said she would come in and talk to you herself, but she never showed. Then I got this text a little while ago.” She handed me her phone.  
  
  Cookie, please meet me at our coffee shop as soon as you get this message.  
  
  Come alone. M  
  
  “I didn’t even know she was missing.”  
  
  “You own a coffee shop?” I asked.  
  
  “How could I not know?” Her breath hitched in her chest with emotion.  
  
  “Wait, how do you know she’s missing now?”  
  
  “I tried calling her cell when I got the message, but she didn’t pick up, so I called her house. Her husband answered.”  
  
  “Well, I guess he would know.”  
  
  “He freaked. He wanted to know what was going on, where his wife was, but the message said come alone. So, I told him I would call him as soon as I knew something.” She bit her lower lip. “He was not a happy camper.”  
  
  “I’ll bet. There aren’t many reasons a woman wants to disappear.”  
  
  She blinked at me in thought before inhaling so sharply, she had to cough a few moments. When she recovered, she said, “Oh, no, you don’t understand. She is very happily married. Warren worships the ground she walks on.”  
  
  “Cookie, are you sure? I mean—”  
  
  “I’m positive. Trust me, if there was any abuse in that relationship, it was to Warren’s bank account. He dotes on that woman like you wouldn’t believe. And those kids.”  
  
  “They have kids?”  
  
  “Yes, two,” she said, her voice suddenly despondent.  
  
  I decided not to argue with her about the possibility of abuse until I knew more. “So, he has no idea where she is?”  
  
  “Not a single one.”  
  
  “And she didn’t tell you what was going on? Why she wanted to disappear?”  
  
  “No, but she was scared.”  
  
  “Well, hopefully we’ll have some answers soon.” I started the car a  
nd drove to the Chocolate Coffee Café, which Cookie did not own, unfortunately. Because, really? Chocolate and coffee? Together? Whoever came up with that combination should have won a Nobel Peace Prize. Or at least a subscription to Reader’s Digest.  
  
  After pulling into the parking lot, we drove to a darkened corner so we could observe for a few moments without being observed. I wasn’t sure how Mimi would take to my presence, especially since she told Cookie to come alone. Making a mental list of who could be after her based on what little I knew, her husband was at the top. Statistics were hard to dismiss.  
  
  “Why don’t you wait here?” Cookie asked as she reached for her door handle.  
  
  “Because we have a lot of paperwork back at the office, and that paperwork’s not going to file itself, missy. No way can I risk losing you now.”  
  
  She glanced back at me. “Charley, it’ll be okay. She’s not going to attack me or anything. I mean, I’m not you. I don’t get attacked and almost killed every other day.”  
  
  “Well, I never,” I said, trying to look offended. “But whoever’s after her might beg to differ. I’m going. Sorry, kiddo.” I stepped out of the car and tossed her the keys when she got out. After scanning the near-empty lot once more, we strolled into the diner. I felt only slightly self-conscious in my bunny slippers.  
  
  “Do you see her?” I asked. I had no idea what the woman looked like.  
  
  Cookie looked around. There were exactly two people inside: one male and one female. I wasn’t surprised it was so slow, considering the freaking time. The man wore a fedora and a trench coat and looked like a movie star from the forties, and the woman looked like a hooker after a rough night at work. But neither really counted, since they were both deceased. The man noticed me immediately. Damn my brightness. The woman never looked over.  
  
  “Of course I don’t see her,” Cookie said. “There’s no one in here. Where could she be? Maybe I took too long. Maybe I shouldn’t have called her husband or taken the time to drag your skinny ass out of bed.”  
  
  “Excuse me?”  
  
  “Oh man, this is bad. I know it. I can feel it.”  
  
  “Cookie, you have to calm down. Seriously. Let’s do a little investigative work before we call in the National Guard, okay?”  
Right. Got it.” She placed a hand over her chest and forced herself to relax.  
  
  “Are you good?” I asked, unable to resist teasing her just a little. “Do you need a Valium?”  
  
  “No, I’m good,” she said, practicing the deep-breathing techniques we’d learned when we watched that documentary on babies being born underwater. “Smart-ass.”  
  
  That was uncalled for. “Speaking of my ass, we need to have a long talk about your impression of it.” We walked to the counter. “Skinny? Really?” The retro diner was decorated with round turquoise barstools and pink countertops. The server strolled toward us. Her uniform matched the light turquoise on the stools. “I’ll have you know—”  
  
  “Hey, there.”  
  
  I turned back to the server and smiled. Her name badge said NORMA.  
  
  “Would you girls like some coffee?”  
  
  Cookie and I glanced at each other. That was like asking the sun if it would like to shine. We each took a barstool at the counter and nodded like two bobbleheads on the dash of a VW van. And she called us girls, which was just cute.  
  
  “Then you’re in luck,” she said with a grin, “because I happen to make the best coffee this side of the Rio Grande.”  
  
  At that point, I fell in love. Just a little. Trying not to drool as the rich aroma wafted toward me, I said, “We’re actually looking for someone. Have you been on duty long?”  
  
  She finished pouring and sat the pot aside. “My goodness,” she said, blinking in surprise. “Your eyes are the most beautiful color I’ve ever seen. They’re—”  
  
  “Gold,” I said with another smile. “I get that a lot.” Apparently, gold eyes were a rarity. They certainly got a lot of comments. “So—”  
  
  “Oh, no, I haven’t been on duty long. You’re my first customers. But my cook has been here all night. He might be able to help. Brad!” She called back to the cook as only a diner waitress could.  
  
  Brad leaned through the pass-out window behind her. I’d expected to see a scruffy older gentleman in desperate need of a shave. Instead, I was met with a kid who looked no older than nineteen with a mischievous gaze and the flirty grin of youth as he appraised the older waitress.  
  
  “You called?” he said, putting as much purr into his voice as he could muster.  
  
  She rolled her eyes and gave him a motherly glare. “These women are looking for someone.”  
  
  His gaze wandered toward me, and the interest in his expression was nowhere near subtle. “Well, thank God they found me.”  
  
  Oh, brother. I tried not to chuckle. It would only encourage him.  
  
  “Have you seen a woman,” Cookie asked, her tone all business, “late thirties with short brown hair and light skin?”  
  
  He arched a brow in amusement. “Every night, lady. You gotta give me more than that.”  
  
  “Do you have a picture?” I asked her.  
  
  Her shoulders fell in disappointment. “I didn’t even think of that. I have one at my apartment, I’m sure. Why didn’t I think to bring it?”  
  
  “Don’t start flogging yourself just yet.” I turned to the kid. “Can I get your name and number?” I asked him. “And that of the server on duty before you as well,” I said, looking at Norma.  
  
  She tilted her head, hesitant. “I think I’d have to check with her before giving out that information, honey.”  
  
  Normally I had a totally-for-real laminated private investigator’s license that I could flash to help loosen people’s tongues, but Cookie dragged me out of my apartment so fast, I hadn’t thought to bring it. I hated it when I couldn’t flash people.  
  
  “I can tell you the server’s name,” the kid said, an evil twinkle in his eyes. “It’s Izzy. Her number’s in the men’s bathroom, second stall, right under a moving poem about the tragedy of man boobs.”  
  
  That kid missed his calling. “Breasts on men are tragic. How ’bout I come back tomorrow night? Will you be on duty?”  
  
  He spread his arms, indicating his surroundings. “Just living the dream, baby. Wouldn’t miss it for the world.”  
  
  I took a few moments to scan the area. The diner sat on the corner of a busy intersection downtown. Or it would be busy during business hours. The dead silver screen star with the fedora kept staring at me, and I kept ignoring. Now was not the time to have a conversation with a guy nobody could see but me. After a few hefty gulps of some of the best coffee I’d ever had—Norma wasn’t kidding—I turned to Cookie. “Let’s look around a bit.”  
  
  She almost choked on her java. “Of course. I didn’t even think of that. Looking around. I knew I brought you for a reason.” She jumped off her stool and, well, looked around. It took every ounce of strength I had not to giggle.  
  
  “How about we try the restroom, Magnum,” I suggested before my willpower waned.  
  
  “Right,” she said, making a beeline for the storeroom. Oh well, we could start there.  
  
  A few moments later, we entered the women’s restroom. Thankfully, Norma had only raised her brows when we began searching the place. Some people might’ve gotten annoyed, especially when we checked out the men’s room, it being primarily for men, but Norma was a trouper. She kept busy filling sugar jars and watching us out of the corner of her eye. But after a thorough check of the entire place, we realized Elvis just wasn’t in the building. Nor was Cookie’s friend Mimi.  
  
  “Why isn’t she here?” Cookie asked. “What do you think happened?” She was starting to panic again.  
  
  “Look at the writing on the wall.”  
  
  “I can’t!” she yelled in full-blown panic mode.  
  
  “Use your inside voice.”  
  
  “I’m not like you. I don’t think like you or have your abilities,” she said, her arms flailing. “I couldn’t investigate publicly, much less privately. My friend is asking for my help, and I can’t even follow her one simple direction, I can’t … Blah, blah, blah.”  
  
  I considered slapping her as I studied the crisp, fresh letters decorating one wall of the women’s restroom, but she was on a roll. I hated to interrupt.  
  
  After a moment, she stopped on her own and glanced at the wall herself. “Oh,” she said, her tone sheepish, “you meant that literally.”  
  
  “Do you know who Janelle York is?” I asked.  
  
  That name was written in a hand much too nice to belong to a teen intent on defacing public property. Underneath it were the letters HANA L2-S3-R27 written in the same crisp style. It was not graffiti. It was a message. I tore off a paper towel and borrowed a pen from Cookie to write down the info.  
  
  “No, I don’t know a Janelle,” she said. “Do you think Mimi wrote this?”  
  
  I looked in the trash can and brought out a recently opened permanent marker package. “I’d say there’s a better-than-average chance.”  
  
  “But why would she tell me to meet her here if she was just going to leave a message on a wall? Why not just text it to me?”  
  
  “I don’t know, hon.” I grabbed another paper towel to search the garbage again but found nothing of interest. “I suspect she had every intention of being here and something or someone changed her mind.”  
  
  “Oh my gosh. So what should we do now?” Cookie asked, her panic rising again. “What should we do now?”  
  
  “First,” I said, washing my hands, “we are going to stop repeating ourselves. We sound ridiculous.”  
  
  “Right.” She nodded her head in agreement. “Sorry.”  
  
  “Next, you are going to find out as much as you can about the company Mimi works for. Owners. Board. CEOs. Blueprints of the building … just in case. And check out that name,” I said, pointing over my shoulder to the name on the wall.  
  
  Her gaze darted along the floor in thought, and I could almost see the wheels spinning in her head, her mind going in a thousand different directions as she slid her purse onto her shoulder.  
  
  “I’ll call Uncle Bob when he gets in and find out who has been assigned to Mimi’s case.” Uncle Bob was my dad’s brother and a detective for the Albuquerque Police Department, just as my dad was, and my work with him as a consu  
ltant for APD accounted for a large part of my income. I’d solved many a case for that man, as I had for my dad before him. It was easier to solve crimes when you could ask the departed who did them in. “I’m not sure who does missing persons at the station. And we’ll need to talk to the husband as well. What was his name?”  
  
  “Warren,” she said, following me out.  
  
  I made a mental list as we exited the restroom. After we paid for our coffee, I tossed Brad a smile and headed out the door. Unfortunately, an irate man with a gun pushed us back inside. It was probably too much to hope he was just there to rob the place.  
  
  Cookie stopped short behind me then gasped. “Warren,” she said in astonishment.  
  
  “Is she here?” he asked, anger and fear twisting his benign features.  
  
  Even the toughest cop alive grew weak in the knees when standing on the business end of a snub-nosed .38. Apparently, Cookie wasn’t graced with the sense God gave a squirrel.  
  
  “Warren Jacobs,” she said, slapping him upside the head.  
  
  “Ouch.” He rubbed the spot where Cookie hit him as she took the gun and crammed it into her purse.  
  
  “Do you want to get someone killed?”  
  
  He lifted his shoulders like a child being scolded by his favorite aunt.  
  
  “What are you doing here?” she asked.  
  
  “I went to your apartment complex after you called then followed you here and waited to see if Mimi would come out. When she didn’t, I decided to come in.”  
  
  He looked ragged and a little starved from days of worry. And he was about as guilty of his wife’s disappearance as I was. I could read people’s emotions like nobody’s business, and innocence wafted off him. He felt bad about something, but it had nothing to do with illegal activity. He probably felt guilty for some imagined offense that he believed made his wife leave. Whatever was going on, I had serious doubts any of it had to do with him.  
  
  “Come on,” I said, ushering them both back into the diner. “Brad,” I called out.  
  
  His head popped through the opening, an evil grin shimmering on his face. “Miss me already?”  
  
  “We’re about to see what you’re made of, handsome.”  
  
  He raised his brows, clearly up to the challenge, and twirled a spatula like a drummer in a rock band. “You just sit back and watch,” he said before ducking back and rolling up his sleeves. That kid was going to break more than his share of hearts. I shuddered to think of the carnage he would leave in his wake.  
  
  Three mucho grande breakfast burritos and seven cups of coffee later—only four of them mine—I sat with a man so sick with worry and doubt, my synapses were taking bets on how long he could keep his breakfast down. The odds were not in his favor.  
  
  He’d been telling me about the recent changes in Mimi’s behavior. “When did you notice this drastic change?” I asked, the question approximately my 112th. Give or take.  
  
  “I don’t know. I get so wrapped up. Sometimes I doubt I’d notice if my own children caught fire. I think about three weeks ago.”  
  
  “Speaking of which,” I said, looking up, “where are your kids?”  
  
  “What?” he asked, steering back to me. “Oh, they’re at my sister’s.”  
  
  A definite plus. This guy was a mess. Thanks to Norma, I’d graduated from taking notes on napkins to taking notes on an order pad. “And your wife didn’t say anything? Ask anything out of the ordinary? Tell you she was worried or felt like someone was following her?”  
  
  “She burned a rump roast,” he said, brightening a little since he could answer one of my questions. “After that, everything went to hell.”  
  
  “So, she takes her cooking very seriously.”  
  
  He nodded then shook his head. “No, that’s not what I meant. She never burns her roast. Especially her rumps.”  
  
  Cookie pinched me under the table when she saw me contemplating whether I should giggle or not. I flashed a quick glare then returned to my expression of concern and understanding.  
  
  “You’re a professional investigator, right?” Warren asked.  
  
  I squinted. “Define professional.” When he only stared, still deep in thought, I said, “No, seriously, I’m not like the other PIs on the playground. I have no ethics, no code of conduct, no taste in gun cleansers.”  
  
  “I want to hire you,” he said, unfazed by my gun-cleanser admission.  
  
  I was already planning to do the gig for Cookie pro bono—especially since I barely paid her enough to eat people food—but money would come in downright handy when the bill collectors showed up. “I’m very expensive,” I said, trying to sound a bit like a tavern wench.  
  
  He leaned in. “I’m very rich.”  
  
  I glanced at Cookie for confirmation. She raised her brows and nodded her head.  
  
  “Oh. Well, then, I guess we can do business. Wait a minute,” I said, my thoughts tumbling over themselves, “how rich?”  
  
  “Rich enough, I guess.” If his answers got any more vague, they’d resemble the food in school cafeterias everywhere.  
  
  “I mean, has anyone asked you for money lately?”  
  
  “Just my cousin Harry. But he always asks me for money.”  
  
  Maybe Cousin Harry was getting more desperate. Or more brazen. I took down Harry’s info, then asked, “Can you think of anything else? Anything that might explain her behavior?”  
  
  “Not really,” he said after handing his credit card to Norma. Neither Cookie nor I had enough to cover our extra coffees, much less our mucho grandes, and since I doubted they would take my bunny slippers in trade …  
  
  “Mr. Jacobs,” I said, putting on my big-girl panties, “I have a confession to make. I’m very adept at reading people, and no offense, but you’re holding out on me.”  
  
  He worked his lower lip, a remorseful guilt oozing out of his pores. Not so much an I-killed-my-wife-and-buried-her-lifeless-body-in-the-backyard kind of guilt but more of an I-know-something-but-I-don’t-want-to-tell kind of guilt.  
  
  With a loud sigh, he lowered his head into his palms. “I thought she was having an affair.”  
  
  Bingo. “Well, that’s something. Can you explain why you thought that?”  
  
  Too exhausted to put much effort into it, he lifted his shoulders into the slightest hint of a shrug. “Just her behavior. She’d grown so distant. I asked her about it, and she laughed, told me I was the only man in her life because she was not about to put up with another.”  
  
  In the grand scheme of things, it was quite natural for him to suspect adultery, considering how much Mimi had apparently changed.  
  
  “Oh, and a friend of hers died recently,” he said in afterthought. His brow crinkled as he tried to remember the details. “I’d completely forgotten. Mimi said she was murdered.”  
  
  “Murdered? How?” I asked.  
  
  “I’m sorry, I just don’t remember.” Another wave of guilt wafted off him.  
  
  “They were close?”  
  
  “That’s just it. They’d went to high school together, but they hadn’t kept in touch. Mimi never even mentioned her name until she died, so I was surprised at how much it affected her. She was devastated, and yet…”  
  
  “And yet?” I asked when he lost himself in thought again. This was just getting interesting. He couldn’t stop now.  
  
  “I don’t know. She was torn up, but not really upset about losing her friend. It was different.” His jaw worked as he rifled through his memories. “I really didn’t think much about it at the time, but quite frankly, she didn’t seem all that surprised that her friend was murdered. Then I asked her if she wanted to go to the funeral, and my god, the look on her face. You’d think I’d asked her to drown the neighbor’s cat.”  
  
  Admittedly, drowning the neighbor’s cat didn’t really clue me in as much as I would’ve liked. “So, she was angry?”  
  
  He blinked back to me and stared. Like a long time. Long enough to have me sliding my tongue over my teeth to make sure I didn’t have anything in them.  
  
  “She was horrified,” he said at last.  
  
  Damn, I wished he could’ve remembered the wom  
an’s name. And why Mimi wasn’t surprised when the woman was murdered. Murder is usually quite the surprise to everyone involved.  
  
  Speaking of names, I decided to ask about the one on the bathroom wall. Having found no foreign objects in my teeth, I asked, “Did Mimi ever mention a Janelle York?”  
  
  “That’s her,” he said in surprise. “That’s Mimi’s friend who was murdered. How did you know?”  
  
  I didn’t, but his thinking I did made me look good.  
  
  Chapter Two  
  
  DON’T CROSS THE STREAMS. NEVER CROSS THE STREAMS.  
  
  —BUMPER STICKER  
  
  “What are you listening to?” I asked, reaching over and turning down the radio as Cookie drove home. “This Little Light of Mine” was just way too happy for the current atmospheric conditions.  
  
  She hit the SCAN button. “I don’t know. It’s supposed to be classic rock.”  
  
  “Oh. So, did you buy this car used?” I asked, thinking back to the dead guy in her trunk and wondering how he got there. I still needed to figure out if Cookie had been a black widow before she met me. She did have black hair. And she’d recently cut it. A disguise, mayhap? Not to mention her early-morning, pre-coffee mean streak that made road rage a practical alternative for a healthier, happier Cookie. The departed rarely just hung out on Earth for no particular reason. Dead Trunk Guy most likely died violently, and if I was ever going to get him to cross, I’d have to figure out how and why.  
  
  “Yeah,” she said absently. “At least we know where to start with Janelle York. Should I call your uncle on this one? And maybe the medical examiner?”  
  
  “Absolutely,” I said supernonchalantly. “So, then, where did you buy it?”  
  
  She looked over at me, her brows knitting. “Buy what?”  
  
  I shrugged and looked out the window. “Your car.”  
  
  “At Domino Ford. Why?”  
  
  I flipped my palms up. “Just wondering. One of those weird things you think about on the way home from investigating a missing persons case.”  
  
  Her eyes widened in horror. “Oh my god! There’s a dead person in my backseat, isn’t there?”  
  
  “Wait, what?” I said in stuttering astonishment. “Not even. Why would you assume such a thing?”

Think of CSPO as the guided tour of Scrum, while PSPO is more like a self-drive road trip where you’d better know the route.

The CSPO is almost tailor-made for beginners. If you’re new to Agile or Scrum, it gives you a clear, structured learning path. You attend a live class with a certified trainer, usually over two days, and you walk away with a shiny certificate. There’s no final exam, so yes, you could technically attend with minimal prep and still pass. It’s a smooth entry into the Scrum world. It’s like joining a gym with a personal trainer rather than figuring out the equipment yourself.

But here’s the catch: it isn’t cheap. In fact, compared to PSPO, it’s noticeably pricier. On top of that, your certificate expires in two years unless you renew (and pay again). Another subtle downside is that while you’ll understand the role of a product owner in real-world scenarios, it doesn’t require you to master the Scrum Guide. The knowledge depth may not be enough to make you a Scrum purist. More so suited for a beginner.

Many CSPO courses focus heavily on soft skills like stakeholder management and prioritization techniques. This is great for real work situations, but it means you might miss out on the more rigorous, textbook-level Scrum knowledge PSPO demands.

On the flip side, PSPO isn’t something you stroll into without prep. You need to know the Scrum Guide inside and out. Every word, every nuance. There’s an exam you must pass, which weeds out the half-interested. This makes PSPO a better fit for those aiming for Scrum management or leadership-level roles. If CSPO is for dipping your toes, PSPO is for diving headfirst into the deep end.

Cost-wise, it’s cheaper than CSPO, which is appealing. Plus, there’s no renewal fee; once you’ve earned it, it’s yours for life. However, it’s not the friendliest starting point for absolute beginners. The self-study requirement and exam rigor mean you’ll need dedication.

PSPO has global recognition in more technical and process-focused circles. Employers who value strong Scrum theory often see PSPO as a “proof of depth” compared to CSPO’s “proof of participation.”

Choosing between CSPO and PSPO is a lot like deciding between taking a cooking class or competing in MasterChef. CSPO gives you a supportive, hand-held introduction where mistakes are part of the process. PSPO expects you to already know your ingredients and recipe by heart, then tests you on it.

Neither is inherently “better.” The CSPO might appeal to someone transitioning into Agile from a non-technical role, eager for instructor-led learning. The PSPO suits those already immersed in Agile, ready to prove they can apply Scrum principles without a guide.

At the end of the day, both CSPO and PSPO tick boxes for HR. They’re “nice-to-have” certifications. Not golden tickets to career success, but to the interview room. Your real impact will still come from how you work in a team, solve problems, and deliver value. CSPO offers a softer, beginner-friendly entry at a higher price, while PSPO delivers a harder test of Scrum mastery at a lower cost. The right choice depends less on the certificate itself and more on where you are in your career journey. A badge on your résumé is fine, but the real test is how you show up in the sprint.",0,1755063986.0,agile,2,0.33,False

  I DON’T KNOW WHETHER it’s day or night when the girl gets up to leave. Her minnow silver dress swishes against the tops of her thighs like Christmas tinsel as she opens the hotel door.  
  
  I struggle to remember her name.  
  
  “So you’ll tell your father at the consulate about me?” Her lipstick is smeared across her cheek. I should tell her to fix it, but my self-loathing is so great that I hate her along with myself.  
  
  “Sure,” I say.  
  
  My father never worked at any consulate. He’s not paying girls a hundred grand a pop to go on a goodwill tour of Europe. I’m not a talent scout for America’s Next Top Model. My uncle doesn’t manage U2. I haven’t inherited a chain of hotels. There are no diamond mines on my family land in Tanzania. I have never been to Tanzania. These are just a few of the stories my mother has spent the summer spinning for a string of blond girls in the hope that they’ll make me forget Lila.  
  
  They don’t.  
  
  I look up at the ceiling. I keep on staring at it until I hear my mother start to move in the adjoining room.  
  
  Mom got out of jail a couple months back. After school let out she relocated us both to Atlantic City, where we’ve been grifting rooms and charging up whatever food and drink we want to them. If the staff gets too demanding about payment, we simply move down the strip. Being an emotion worker means that Mom never leaves a credit card at the desk.  
  
  As I think that, she opens the door between our rooms.  
  
  “Honey,” Mom says, as though it’s not at all weird to find me lying on the floor in my boxers. Her black hair is up in clips and wrapped in one of her silk scarves, the way she always wears it when she sleeps. She’s got on the hotel robe from the last hotel, tied tightly around her ample waist. “You ready for some breakfast?”  
  
  “Just coffee, I think. I’ll make it. ” I push myself up and pad over to the complimentary pot. There’s a bag of grounds, sugar, and some powdered creamer sitting on a plastic tray.  
  
  “Cassel, how many times do I have to tell you that it isn’t safe to drink out of those things? Someone could have been brewing meth in it. ” Mom frowns. She always worries about the weirdest things. Hotel coffeepots. Cell phones. Never normal stuff, like the police. “I’ll order us both up coffee from the kitchen. ”  
  
  “They could be brewing meth there, too,” I say, but she ignores me.  
  
  She goes into her room and I can hear her make the call. Then she comes back to the doorway. “I ordered you some egg whites and toast. And juice. I know you said you weren’t hungry, but you need to keep your strength up for today. I found us a new mark. ” Her smile is big enough that I almost want to smile along with her.  
  
  That’s my mom.  
  
  Believe it or not, there are magazines out there called, like, Millionaire Living or New Jersey Millionaires or whatever, that feature profiles of old guys in their homes, showing off their stuff. I have no idea who else buys them, but they’re perfect for my mother. I think she sees them as gold digger shopping catalogs.  
  
  That’s where she found Clyde Austin. He’s on the page after a feature with curse-worker-hating Governor Patton at his mansion, Drumthwacket. Despite a recent divorce, according to the article, Austin still manages to enjoy a lifestyle that includes a private plane, a heated infinity pool, and two borzois that travel with him everywhere. He has a home in Atlantic City, where he likes to go out to dinner at Morton’s and play a little blackjack when he can get away from the office. The picture of him shows a short, squat dude with hair plugs.  
  
  “Put on something dirty,” Mom says. She’s at her desk, altering a new pair of bright blue gloves. She’s seeding them with tiny holes at the fingertips: small enough to go unnoticed, big enough for her skin to touch the mark’s.  
  
  “Dirty?” I say from the couch I’m slumped on in her suite. I’m on my third cup of coffee, all three choked with cream. I ate the toast, too.  
  
  “Wrinkled. Something that makes you look homeless and desperate. ” She begins to take down her curls, one by one. Soon she’ll start rubbing gunk into her skin and curling her eyelashes. It takes her hours to get ready.  
  
  “What’s the plan?” I ask.  
  
  “I posed as his secretary and pretended I forgot when his reservation was for,” Mom says. “At Morton’s. Wasn’t it great how the magazine comes right out and says where to find him? It absolutely worked. He’s going to eat there at eight o’clock tonight. ”  
  
  “How long have you known that for?” I ask her.  
  
  “A couple days. ” She shrugs, making a careful line of black above her eyes. There’s no telling how long she really knew. “Oh—and grab the plastic bag over by my suitcase. ”  
  
  I slug down the last of the coffee and get up. The bag contains panty hose. I put them on her desk.  
  
  “They’re for you. ”  
  
  “You want me to look homeless, desperate, but also kind of fabulous?” I ask.  
  
  “Over your head,” she says, turning in her chair and miming the gesture like I’m a moron. “If Clyde works out, I want him to be able to meet you as my son. ”  
  
  “It sounds like you’ve really got some plan cooked up,” I say.  
  
  “Oh, come on,” she demands. “School starts in less than a week. Don’t you want to have a little fun?”  
  
  Several hours later Mom clops along the boardwalk behind me in platform heels. Her white dress blows in the late summer wind. The neckline is low enough that I’m worried her boobs are going to actually fall out if she moves too fast. I know it’s disturbing that I notice, but I’m not blind.  
  
  “You know what you’re supposed to do, right?” she says.  
  
  I wait for her to catch up. She has on gold lame gloves and is carrying a gold clutch purse. I guess she decided against the blue. Altogether it’s quite an outfit. “No, why don’t you tell me for the millionth time?”  
  
  I see the fury pass over her face like a storm. Her eyes go hard.  
  
  “I’ve got it, Mom,” I say in what I hope is a conciliatory way. “Go on ahead. We shouldn’t be talking. ”  
  
  She totters off toward the restaurant, and I walk to the railing, looking at the sea. It’s the same view I had from Zacharov’s Atlantic City penthouse. I think of Lila with her back to me, staring out at black water.  
  
  I should have told her I loved her back then. Back when it would have meant something.  
  
  Waiting is the hardest thing about any con job. The moments slip by and your hands start to sweat, anticipating what’s coming. Your mind wanders. You’re all keyed up from adrenaline, but there’s nothing to do.  
  
  Distraction leads to disaster. Mom’s rule.  
  
  I turn back toward the restaurant and slip my gloved hand into my pocket, touching the wadded-up piece of panty hose. I hacked off the foot with a room service knife.  
  
  I keep focused, eyeing the crowd, watching my mother vamp up her incredibly slow stroll. We could be here awhile. And, honestly, this plan might not even work. That’s another thing about cons; you have to go after a bunch of marks before you find the perfect one. The one you can really take for all he’s worth.  
  
  We wait for twenty minutes, almost a block apart from each other. Mom has done all the innocent things someone does on a nighttime stroll: smoked a cigarette, checked her lipstick, made fake calls on the cell phone she borrowed from me. I, on the other hand, have taken to begging for change. I’ve made about $3. 50 and am about to land another quarter when Clyde Austin lurches out of Morton’s.  
  
  Mom starts to move.  
  
  I jump up and take off toward her, yanking the panty hose down over my face. That slows me down some, because there is no way in hell these things are sheer. I can barely see.  
  
  People start yelling. Yeah, because a guy with hos  
e over his head is never the good guy. He is, in fact, the stereotype—maybe even the archetype—of a bad guy.  
  
  I keep running, flying past my mother and yanking the gold clutch out of her hand.  
  
  She adds her screams to the chorus.  
  
  “Thief!” my mother screams. “Help! Heeeeelp!”  
  
  Now, this is the tricky part. I have to keep running, but I have to run just slowly enough that a drunk and out-of-shape guy with a couple of martinis rolling around in his belly actually thinks he can catch me.  
  
  “Please—someone!” Mom shrieks. “He has all my money!”  
  
  It’s really hard not to laugh.  
  
  I practically run into Clyde, making sure he’s got a shot at me. But I’ve got to give it to Mom. She’s right when she says that guys want to be knights in shining armor. He grabs for my arm.  
  
  I let myself fall.  
  
  It’s a bad one. Maybe it’s the panty hose over my face, or maybe I’m just off balance, but I go down hard on the asphalt, scraping one hand so roughly, I can feel my glove shred. I’m pretty sure I scrape my knees, too, but all they feel is numb.  
  
  I drop the purse.  
  
  Clyde clocks me in the back of the head before I can push myself to my feet. It hurts. She better appreciate this. Then I’m up and running. Full out. Pulling that crap off my face and hurling myself through the night as fast as I can.  
  
  Leaving Clyde Austin to be a hero, bringing a damsel in distress her golden clutch purse.  
  
  Leaving him to notice how charming she is when her eyes well up with gratitude.  
  
  Leaving him to check out her rack.  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  Mom is exultant. She breaks out the bottle of Prosecco from the minibar while I pour frothing hydrogen peroxide over my hand. It stings like crazy.  
  
  “He wants to meet for drinks tomorrow night. I told him it was the least I could do to take him out. He said that, after what I’d been through, he was going to pay, and that was that. Now, doesn’t that sound promising?”  
  
  “Sure,” I tell her.  
  
  “He’s going to pick me up here. At six. Do you think I should be ready when he gets here or do you think I should invite him in for a drink while I do a few last little things? Maybe be in my robe?”  
  
  I make a face. “I don’t know. ”  
  
  “Stop thinking of it that way. This is a job. We need someone to provide for us. Pay for your fancy school—and Barron’s loans. Especially now that Philip can’t be sure how long he’s going to stay employed. ” She cuts me a dark look, like I somehow forgot that I’m the one that got him in trouble with the boss of a crime family. Like I am going to start caring. They’ve done much worse to me.  
  
  “So long as you don’t work Clyde,” I say quietly. “You don’t need to. You’re plenty charming on your own. ”  
  
  She laughs and pours her Prosecco into a water glass. It fizzes like the peroxide. “Like mother, like son. We’re both charming when we want something. Right, Cassel?”  
  
  “So I want you to stay out of jail,” I say. “So what? Is that supposed to be a secret?”  
  
  The doorbell of her room buzzes. “What did you order?” I ask her, and head over to open it.  
  
  Mom makes a sound of alarm, but she’s too late.  
  
  Clyde Austin is standing in the hallway, a bottle of Jack Daniel’s swinging from one hand. “Oh,” he says, embarrassed. “I must have the wrong room. I thought—”  
  
  Then he gets a good look at me—at the blood on my jeans, the scrape on my bare hand. And he sees my mother sitting on the bed. And he knows. His face goes ugly.  
  
  “You set me up,” he says. “You and her. ” The way he says “her” tells me everything he’s thinking about us.  
  
  I start to explain, when he swings the bottle at my head. I see it moving, but I am too clumsy, too slow. It makes a hollow, horrible thunk against my temple.  
  
  I hit the carpet, dizzy. Dull pain makes me nauseous. That’s what I get for underestimating the guy. I roll onto my back just in time to see him over me, raising the Jack Daniel’s to strike again.  
  
  With a shriek Mom rakes her nails against his neck.  
  
  He whirls around, wild, swinging. His elbow connects. She flies back against the desk. Her magnifying mirror cracks against the wall, the shards falling like glittering confetti.  
  
  I reach up my bare hand. I could stop him with a single touch.  
  
  I could change him into a cockroach.  
  
  I could transform him into a puddle of grease.  
  
  I really want to.  
  
  Clyde has gone still, though, looking around like he suddenly doesn’t know where he is. “Shandra?” he says gently, reaching for my mother. “I’m so sorry. Did I hurt you?”  
  
  “That’s okay,” Mom says in a soothing voice, getting up slowly. She winces. There’s blood on her lip. “You just came by to bring me a little liquor, didn’t you? And you saw my son. Maybe you mistook him for someone else. ”  
  
  “I guess,” he says. “We got along so well that I figured why wait until tomorrow night? And then . . . He does look like the mugger, you have to admit. ”  
  
  Mom’s an emotion worker. She can’t change his memories; my brother Barron could do that, but he’s not here. What Mom can do with a single bare-handed touch is make Clyde Austin like her so much that he’s willing to give her the benefit of the doubt. About anything. Everything. Even this.  
  
  A wave of dizziness overwhelms me.  
  
  “That’s true, baby,” she says. “He does look a little like the mugger. It was an honest mistake. I’m just going to walk you to the door now. ” Her fingers go to his neck, which should make anybody flinch—bare fingers, no glove—but it doesn’t bother him at all. He lets himself be steered.  
  
  “I’m really sorry for what happened,” he says. “I don’t know what came over me. ”  
  
  “I understand,” Mom tells him. “And I forgive you, but I don’t think that we can see each other tomorrow night. You get that, right Shame heats his face. “Of course. ”  
  
  My vision blurs. She says something else soothing, but not to me.  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  We check out in the morning. Sunlight makes my brain feel like it’s throbbing inside my skull. Sweat slicks my skin—the kind of unnatural sweat that comes along with injury. Each movement makes me as dizzy as riding a thousand roller coasters all at once. While we wait for the valet to get my car, I fumble through my backpack for sunglasses and try to avoid looking at the dark bruise on Mom’s shoulder.  
  
  She’s been totally silent since she told me we were leaving—all through packing and even the ride down in the elevator. I can tell she’s seething.  
  
  I feel too sick to know what to do about it.  
  
  Finally my ancient and rusted Benz drives up to the front of the hotel. Mom hands something to the driver and gets the keys while I slide in on the other side. The seat is hot on the backs of my legs, even through jeans.  
  
  “How could you answer the door like that?” she shouts as soon as we pull away from the curb. “Not looking through the peephole. Not calling out to ask who was there?”  
  
  I flinch at her voice.  
  
  “Are you stupid, Cassel? Didn’t I teach you better than that?”  
  
  She’s right. It was thoughtless. Stupid. Private school has made me careless. It’s exactly the kind of dumb mistake that separates a decent con man from an amateur. Plus the blowback from the emotion work makes her unstable. Not that she isn’t normally pretty unstable. But working magnifies it. So does anger. There’s nothing for me to do but ride it out.  
  
  I was used to her being like this when I was a kid. But she’s been in jail long enough for me to forget how bad she can get.  
  
  “Are you stupid?” she screeches. “Answer me!”  
  
  “Stop,” I say, and lean my head against the window, shutting my eyes. “Please stop. I’m sorry, okay?”  
  
  “No,” she says, her voice vicious and certain. “No one’s that pathetic. You did it on purpose! You wanted to ruin things for me. ”  
  
  “Oh, come on,” I say. “I wasn’t thinking. I said I was sorry. Look, I’m the one with the goose egg to show for it. So we have to leave Atlantic City? We’d have to leave in a week anyway when I went back to school. ”  
  
  “You did this to me because of Lila. ” Her gaze is on the road, but her eyes glitter with fury. “Because you’re still angry. ”  
  
  Lila. My best friend, who I thought I killed.  
  
  “I’m not talking about her,” I snap. “Not with you. ”  
  
  I think about Lila’s wide, expressive mouth turning up at the corners. I think about her spread out on my bed, reaching for me.  
  
  With one touch of her hand, Mom made Lila love me. And made sure I could never, ever have her.  
  
  “Hit a nerve?” Mom says, gleefully cruel. “It’s amazing you actually thought you were good enough for Zacharov’s daughter. ”  
  
  “Shut up,” I say.  
  
  “She was using you, you stupid little moron. When everything was said and done, she wouldn’t have given you the time of day, Cassel. You would have been a reminder of Barron and misery and nothing more. ”  
  
  “I don’t care,” I say. My hands are shaking. “It would still have been better than—” Better than having to avoid her until the curse fades. Better than the way she’ll look at me once it does.  
  
  Lila’s desire for me is a perversion of love. A mockery.  
  
  And I almost didn’t care, I wanted her so much.  
  
  “I did you a favor,” my mother says. “You should be grateful. You should be thanking me. I got you Lila on a silver platter—something you could have never in your life had otherwise. ”  
  
  I laugh abruptly. “I should be thanking you? How about you hold your breath until I do?”  
  
  “Don’t talk that way to me,” Mom roars, and slaps me, hard.  
  
  Hard enough that my battered head hits the window. I see stars. Little explosions of light behind the dark glasses. Behind my eyelids.  
  
  “Pull over,” I say. Nausea overwhelms me.  
  
  “I’m sorry,” she says, her voice seesawing back to sweet. “I didn’t mean to hurt you. Are you okay?”  
  
  The world is starting to tilt. “You have to pull over. ”  
  
  “Maybe right now you’d rather walk than deal with me, but if you’re really hurt, then you better—”  
  
  “Pull over!” I shout, and something about the urgency of my tone finally convinces her. She steers the car abruptly onto the shoulder of the road and brakes hard. I stumble out while we’re still moving.  
  
  Just in time to heave my guts up in the grass.  
  
  I really hope no one at Wallingford wants me to write an essay on how I spent my summer vacation.  
  
  CHAPTER TWO  
  
  I PARK MY BENZ IN THE seniors’ lot, which is much closer to the dorms than where underclassmen are forced to leave their cars. I feel a little smug until I shut off the engine and it makes an odd metallic cough, like maybe it just gave up the ghost. I get out and kick the front tire halfheartedly. I had a plan to fix up the car, but with Mom home I never quite got around to it.  
  
  Leaving my bags in the trunk, I walk across campus toward the Finke Academic Center.  
  
  Over the doorway of the large brick building hangs a hand-lettered sign: WELCOME FRESHMEN. The trees rustle with a light wind, and I am overcome with a feeling of nostalgia for something I haven’t yet lost.  
  
  At a table inside, Ms. Noyes is looking through a box of cards and giving out orientation packets. A few sophomores I don’t know too well are shrieking and hugging one another. When they see me, they quiet down and start whispering instead. I overhear “kill himself” and “in his underwear” and “cute. ” I walk faster.  
  
  At the desk a blotchy, trembling girl and her father are picking up dorm keys. She clings to his hand like she’d be lost without it. This is clearly the first time the girl has spent any time away from home. I feel sorry for her and envy her all at once.  
  
  “Hey, Ms. Noyes,” I say when it’s my turn. “How’s it going?”  
  
  She looks up and smiles. “Cassel Sharpe! I am so pleased you’ll be living on campus again. ” She gets me my manila folder and room assignment. In addition to the exclusive parking lot and, bizarrely, a stretch of grass—no, really, it’s called “senior grass”—seniors also get the best dorm rooms. It looks like mine is on the ground level. I guess they’re a little leery of me on a high floor after that whole almost-falling-off-a-roof thing.  
  
  “Me too. ” And I am glad to be back. I really, really am. “Has Sam Yu checked in yet?”  
  
  She flips through the cards. “No, you beat him. ”  
  
  Sam has been my roommate since we were sophomores, but it wasn’t until the end of last year that we got to be friends. I’m still not really good at friendship, but I’m trying.  
  
  “Thanks. See you later,” I say. There’s always an assembly on the first night before classes start. Headmistress Northcutt and Dean Wharton tell us that we’re intelligent, capable young men and women, and then proceed to lecture us about how only the school rules keep us safe from ourselves. It’s a good time.  
  
  “Try to stay out of trouble,” she says with a grin. Her voice is teasing, but there’s a firmness there that makes me think she doesn’t say this to all incoming students.  
  
  “Absolutely,” I say.  
  
  Back in the parking lot I start unloading the car. There’s a bunch of stuff. Mom spent Labor Day weekend pretending we’d never had a fight and buying me extravagant presents to make up for that fight we never had. I am now the owner of a new iPod, a leather bomber jacket, and a laptop. I’m pretty sure I saw her paying for the laptop with Clyde Austin’s credit card, but I pretended not to notice. Mom packed my bags for me too, on her working theory that no matter what I say I want, she knows what I’ll actually need. I repacked them as soon as she was out of the room.  
  
  “You know I love you, right, baby?” Mo  
m asked this morning as I was leaving.  
  
  The weird thing is, I do know.  
  
  When I get to my new dorm room—bigger than the one we had last year, plus the ground floor means I don’t have to haul all my crap up a million flights of stairs—I dump everything on the floor and sigh.  
  
  I wonder where Lila is right now. I wonder if her father shipped her off to some Swiss Boarding School for worker crime family kids, some place with armed guards and high gates. I wonder if she likes it. Maybe the curse has already worn off and she’s just sitting around, sipping hot chocolate and chatting up ski instructors. Maybe it would be safe to call her, just to talk for a few minutes. Just to hear her voice.  
  
  I want to, so badly that I force myself to call my brother Barron instead, just to remind me what’s real. He told me to call once I settled in, anyway. I figure this is settled enough.  
  
  “Hey,” he says, picking up after only one ring. “How’s my favorite brother?” Every time I hear his voice, I get the same knot in my stomach. He made me into a killer. He used me, but he doesn’t remember that. He thinks that we’re thick as thieves, hand in glove. All the things I made him think.  
  
  Blowback ate away so many of his memories that he believes the fake ones I carefully forged into his notebooks—the ones of us being close. And that makes him the only person I’m sure I can trust.  
  
  Pathetic, right?  
  
  “I’m worried about Mom. She’s getting worse,” I say. “Reckless. She can’t get caught again, or she’s going to jail forever. ”  
  
  I’m not sure what he can do. It’s not like I did such a good job of keeping her out of trouble in Atlantic City.  
  
  “Oh, come on. ” He sounds bored and a little drunk. I hear soft music in the background. It’s not even noon. “Juries love her. ”  
  
  I’m pretty sure he’s missing the point. “Just, please—she’s not careful. Maybe she’ll listen to you. You were going to be the lawyer—”  
  
  “She’s an old lady,” Barron says. “And she’s been locked up for years. Let her have some fun. She needs to blow off steam. Seduce old dudes. Lose money at canasta. ”  
  
  I laugh, despite myself. “Just keep an eye on her before she takes those old dudes for everything they’ve got. ”  
  
  “Roger dodger. Mission heard and accepted,” he says, and I find myself relaxing. Then he sighs. “Have you talked to Philip recently?”  
  
  “You know I haven’t,” I say. “Every time I call, he hangs up on me, and there’s nothing I can—”  
  
  The doorknob starts to turn.  
  
  “Let me call you later,” I say quickly. It’s too weird to be talking to Barron and pretending everything is normal in front of my roommate, who knows what Barron’s done. Who’d wonder why I would call Philip. Who doesn’t understand what it means to have a family as messed up as mine.  
  
  “Peace out, little brother,” Barron says, and hangs up.  
  
  Sam walks in, duffel bag over his shoulder. “Hey,” he says with a shy smile. “Long time, no see. How was Toronto?”  
  
  “There was supposed to be an ice castle,” I say. “But it melted. ”  
  
  Yeah, I lied to him about where I spent the summer. I didn’t have to—there was no really good reason not to tell him I went to Atlantic City, except it didn’t seem like a place normal people go with a parent. I told you I’m no good at this friends thing.  
  
  “That’s too bad. ” Sam turns to put an aluminum toolbox on the rickety wooden dresser. He’s a big guy, tall and round. He always seems to move carefully, like someone who is uncomfortable with taking up too much space. “Hey, I got some new stuff you’re going to love. ”  
  
  “Oh, yeah?” I unpack the way I usually do—by shoving everything under my bed until room inspection. That’s what happens when you grow up in a garbage house; you feel more comfortable with a little squalor.  
  
  “I have a kit to make molds of teeth and craft really perfect fangs. Like, perfect. They fit over your teeth as if they were tiny little gloves. ” He looks happier than I remember him. “Daneca and I went into New York—to this special effects warehouse, and cleaned the place out. Resins. Elastomer. Poly foams. I could probably fake setting someone on fire. ”  
  
  I raise my eyebrows.  
  
  “Hey,” he says. “After last year I figured I’d better be prepared. ”  
  
  Carter Thompson Memorial Auditorium is the place where, every year, all the students gather to listen while the rules are repeated for anyone too lazy to read the handbook. “Boys must wear the Wallingford jacket and tie, black dress pants, and a white shirt. Girls must wear the Wallingford jacket, a black skirt or black dress pants, and a white shirt. Both boys and girls should wear black dress shoes. No sneakers. No jeans. ” Fascinating stuff like that.  
  
  Sam and I try to grab a seat in the back, but Ms. Logan, the school secretary, spots us and points out an empty row in the front.  
  
  “Boys,” she says. “We’re trying to be an example to all the new students, now that we’re seniors, aren’t we?”  
  
  “Can’t we be bad examples?” Sam asks, and I snort.  
  
  “Mr. Yu,” says Ms. Logan, pressing her lips together. “Senioritis is a serious condition this early in the year. Lethal. Mr. Sharpe, I would appreciate it if you didn’t encourage him. ”  
  
  We move to the new seats.  
  
  Dean Wharton and Headmistress Northcutt are already up at the lectern. Northcutt starts off with lots of rah-rahing about how we’re all one big family here at Walling-ford, how we support one another through the hard times, and how we’ll look back on our years here as among the best of our lives.

## Key Features Analysis

the best bottle perfumes combine exceptional fragrance with equally captivating bottle design. The perfect pairing elevates the entire experience, making it a true sensory delight.

**Scent Profile**

The scent profile is, of course, the most critical aspect of any perfume. It encompasses the top notes (the initial impression), the heart notes (the core of the fragrance), and the base notes (the lingering scent). A well-balanced scent profile creates a harmonious and long-lasting aroma. Look for details regarding the individual notes and how they blend together to create the overall impression. A complex,layered fragrance is often indicative of high quality and expert craftsmanship.

**Longevity**

Longevity refers to how long the fragrance lasts on your skin. Eau de parfums (EDPs) typically offer greater longevity than eau de toilettes (EDTs) due to their higher concentration of perfume oils. Consider how long you want the scent to last throughout the day. For daytime wear, a moderate longevity of 4-6 hours might suffice, while for evening events, you might prefer a perfume that lasts 8 hours or more.

**bottle Material**

The quality of the bottle material considerably impacts the overall presentation and perceived value. High-end perfumes frequently enough utilize crystal or thick, high-quality glass for enhanced durability and a luxurious feel. The bottle should be resistant to scratches and damage, ensuring it remains an elegant display piece for years to come. The weight of the bottle can also contribute to the feeling of luxury.**Design Aesthetics**

the design aesthetics of the bottle play a crucial role in its appeal. Consider the overall shape, color, and embellishments. Some bottles feature minimalist designs,while others are adorned with intricate details and artistic flourishes. The design should complement the fragrance itself and reflect the brand's identity. Look for bottles that are not only visually appealing but also cozy to hold and easy to use.

**Sprayer Mechanism**

The sprayer mechanism, often overlooked, is essential for a smooth and consistent request. A high-quality sprayer should dispense a fine mist, ensuring even coverage and preventing concentrated sprays that can be overpowering. The sprayer should also be durable and reliable, avoiding leaks or malfunctions. A good sprayer is a key quality indicator, especially for a luxury product.

**Brand Heritage**

The brand heritage associated with a specific bottle of perfume can heavily influence its perceived value and prestige.Established brands with a rich history of fragrance creation may offer a different appeal than emerging brands. Examining the brand's history,philosophy,and commitment to quality can significantly impact your purchasing decision.

## FAQs Section

**How do I choose a perfume that complements my skin chemistry?**
Perfume reacts differently to each individual's skin chemistry. The best way to find a complementary fragrance is to sample it on your skin and observe how the scent evolves over time. Wait at least 30 minutes to an hour after application to fully experience the scent's transformation.

**What is the difference between Eau de Parfum (EDP) and Eau de Toilette (EDT)?**
The main difference lies in the concentration of perfume oils.EDPs typically contain 15-20% perfume oils, while EDTs contain 5-15%. EDPs generally offer longer-lasting scents and are more potent than EDTs. EDT's are typically lighter and more refreshing, better suited for daytime wear.

**How should I store my bottle perfume to maintain its quality?**
Store your bottle perfume in a cool, dark, and dry place away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures. Heat and light can degrade the fragrance oils, causing the scent to weaken or change over time. keeping your perfume in its original box can also help protect it from environmental factors.

**How often should I apply perfume for optimal scent projection?**
the frequency of application depends on the concentration of the perfume and your personal preference. As a general guideline, apply 1-3 sprays of EDP in strategic areas such as the wrists, neck, and behind the ears. For EDT, you may need to reapply more frequently throughout the day to maintain the desired scent projection.

1mow6la,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1mow6la/please_help_i_am_freaking_out/,Please help. I am freaking out.,"I have started feeling this symptoms since December 2024. At first, I was having this persistent cough that wont go away. 
I was also having this heart skipping a beat but it comes and goes. I guess I was just having too much coffee. 
On February 2025, I gave out fighting this with my immune system and went to a lung doctor advised me to get xray and he prescribed me antibiotics as my throat is inflammed. 
Xray came out no infection, no TB. Clear lungs. He said it might be acid reflux and prescribed me ezomeprazole for 2 weeks.

I tried to change my lifestyle by not drinking coffee, milk or eating chocolates, light food intake, wait 3 hours before sleeping and turn left during sleep. 

May 2025, I am still having this reflux symptoms but my main concern now is my heart skipping a beat that does not go away like before. 
So he ask me to get an ultrasound upper abdomen for my reflux and an EKG to catch the heart skipping a beat.
Ultrasound on upper abdomen showed normal sonogram of the liver, biliary tree, pancreas and spleen. 
EKG showed occasional premature ventricular contractions.  

June 2025, I went to a heart doctor and showed him the EKG. He adviised to get 2D Echo and Cornoary CT Angio to really examine. 
CT Angio: No evidence of coronary artery disease.
2D Echo: Normal impression except with Trivial Tricuspid Regurgitation.

I went back to my doctor and he said nothing to worry about. That is normal.
I went to another heart doctor for a 2nd opinion and he also said nothing to worry about. Even athletes have this Trivial tricuspid regurgitation.

So, now I did EGD last week due to the same reflux symptoms that feels like heart palpitations but when I check my pulse, its normal. 
My heart is still skipping a beat, but I feel this happens when I am stressed out, lack of sleep, overthinking, etc.

EGD Findings: 
- Mucosal breaks >5mm not extending between the tops of two mucosal folds at the CEJ. Multiple biopsies taken.
- esophageal polyp with finger like projection seen at 15cm from the incisors.
- lax LES tone
- areas of erythema and erosions seen at the fundus, gastric body, antrum, 
- biopsy taken for H Pylori

Diagnosis:
- esophagitis LA grade B
- to consider esophageal papilloma
- hiatal hernia
- erosive gastritis

Biopsy result:
- H. Pylori: negative
- cardioesophageal mucosa: with chronic active inflammation and focal intestinal metaplasia consistent with barrett esophagus; glandular atypia noted - reactive versus low grade dysplasia.
- esophageal polyp: consistent with squamous papilloma

Follow-up Doctor Consultation:
- Main thing doctor said is not to worry. 
- low rate it will turn into cancer. Good thing it is not high grade dysplasia.
- treatment for 6 months via esomeprazole 40mg taken one a day before breakfast.
- take algina as needed if there are reflux symptoms.
- squamous papilloma is benign.
- follow up endoscopy after 6-12 months to check if linings improved after treatment.
 
I am going to schedule another doctor for a 2nd opinion because whenever you read in internet, it says that is pre-cancer.",1,1755063759.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

Like… SERIOUSLY, this was so much easier than I ever imagined?

I went down a late-night rabbit hole, found a bunch of crazy legit apps, and now my friends are all asking me for links. 2025 is wild, y’all. Why did no one tell me about this until now?

So, for anyone who’s tired of fake sites and dodgy “rewards”—here’s my NO-BS breakdown of the **Top 7 Apps That Actually Pay You for Testing New Features** (proof? Got my screenshots ready, lol):

---

### 1. **GoodNovel Testing App**
Bro. This is the one that started it all for me. It’s all about new feature testing and SURVEYS. Smooth payout, real cash, and so simple.
- They email you directly with new features to try.
- Each task takes <5 mins MAX!
- I made coffee money before breakfast, I kid you not.
- **[Check it or miss out, seriously](https://goodnovel.org/testapp).**

---

### 2. BetaBound

- Huge directory of feature-testing gigs, and most are PAID.
- Super transparent about what they expect -> and yeah, free products too.
- Some early-adopter apps that actually turned viral!

---

### 3. **UserTesting Sneak Peeks**

- Video reviews = $$$
- You don’t just test apps, but voice out what’s confusing/shocking in real-time.
- Got matched in under 20 minutes. I was shook.

---

### 4. PlayTestCloud

- OMG, game-lovers, this is for you.
- Test new games, get paid via PayPal.
- EASY, fun, and no shady installs.

---

### 5. **Appen Feature Feedback**

- Legit company (been around for years).
- Pays for simple micro-tasks on all-new platforms.
- Chill, work-from-phone style. And earnings build up way faster than surveys.

---

### 6. TryMyUI

- Fancy trying hot new apps and websites before *literally* anyone else?
- Sends a couple of tasks a week, so it’s side-hustle territory. 
- Payouts come ON TIME.

---

### 7. **Applause Testing Squad**

- Real-deal QA testing, but don’t let that scare you.
- They walk you through it, and the $ is just insane for what they ask.
- Some projects clocking in at $50 an hour for FEATURE FEEDBACK. Duuuuude.

---

Every single one of these is a game-changer if you (like me) love snooping on unreleased features and getting paid for your curiosity. 

But, real talk—the **[GoodNovel Testing App](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** has definitely dropped the wildest feature rewards so far.   
I'm still blown away by how simple it is? Why are most people still sleeping on this?! 🤯

Her addiction to life and creation

She has many students, she teaches in different batches of students however, a few Kuwaiti students as per information she provided me, she takes one on one classes. She has a Kuwaiti student (34M) for spoken English, a two month course that he just started, he is married, 3 kids. So far he only had 4 classes, but he has started bringing Coffee for wife from last two classes. My wife is very impressed by him, he works in KNPC ( a big govt oil company), has bunch of businesses including resturants, and very well mannered. Right now I am not in Kuwait, she is staying with her family.  I told my wife that this is weird. But she said he is nice and has no bad intentions. And also she said that she won't stop him from bringing Coffee if he does on his own will. Should I be worried ? What should I be doing? And additional question, would he have bought her coffee if she was a Kuwaiti married woman?


TBH I am not very comfortable. However,  since wife shared on her own, I feel a little better. However, I feel that a two month is a long time. Also, she has clear communication through WhatsApp regarding class scheduling with all the students although it is office issued SIM card. So yeah, right now it is all about trust. Also it is weird he brings her a coffee she didn't like before, Iced Americano. i like this drink and always order it for myself and she drinks some other mild coffee. So this is weird that she suddenly started liking Iced Americano.

A bit of background to help you understand my insecurities: 

I met my wife when we were young, i had lots of potential, but currently things arent that well financially. And now, my wife is in a new phase of life where she wants to work hard, make lots of money, stay in a good place, in a good country, that's why she is okay staying away from me in Kuwait with her parents. We are from Delhi, India. I have job here in Delhi, which is a below average sort of job, pays around  INR 70-80K ( around 300 in Kuwaiti Dinar, wife earns 330 KD), stay in a not so good area. Hence, she doesn't like to stay at my place due to the locality. We are thinking of working towards moving to a different country. Recently, she got her father to buy a visa for me to travel to Kuwait, I tried job searching in Kuwait, found very hard to land a job, still have Kuwait visa valid for another six months.  I had to come back to India as I couldn't stay unemployed in Kuwait for too long. I joined a job here in India and she didn't follow me here. So you can understand where I am coming from in this situation with my insecurities.



Edit -additional info:- 
 my wife wears abaya and hijab. 
The Kuwaiti guy has like 3-4 classes per week for two hours, and this is only one for spoken English which my wife takes. So he has no other classes. 

Further, that is something bothering me is that, my wife said is doesn't mind if he likes her. She is happy being liked by others. It stuck out to me, but also she is pretty, so I am sure most people like her anyways. ",0,1755062740.0,indianmuslims,9,0.5,False

1movtpp,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1movtpp/hr_mile_marker_0/,[HR] Mile Marker 0,"The first hour of the trip felt normal. The RV smelled faintly of coffee and gasoline, my mom was humming along to old songs, and my little brother, Caleb, was glued to his tablet. Dad grinned from the driver’s seat, saying this would be “the family road trip we’ll never forget.”

He was right about that.

It was just after midnight when Dad admitted he’d taken a “shortcut” the GPS suggested. The paved road had turned into a narrower, older one—its faded yellow lines barely visible in the glow of the headlights. The trees were different here, leaning inward, their branches weaving together above us like a tunnel.

The first time I saw the mile marker, I thought nothing of it. A rusted pole, white paint peeling away, the number *0* stamped in black. But an hour later, it was there again. Same dents. Same chipped corner.

Mom tried to play it off—“Guess they just repeat the numbers here.” But she wouldn’t meet my eyes.

The third time we passed it, Caleb started crying. “It’s the same sign. The *same* one,” he kept saying. Mom tried to comfort him, but her voice trembled.

By the fourth pass, the air inside the RV felt heavier. The heater wasn’t on, but it was getting warm, almost humid. The GPS screen was now completely blank, no road, no coordinates—just a gray haze that pulsed faintly, like it was breathing.

Dad kept glancing at it anyway, muttering under his breath. I caught words like “almost there” and “not yet.”

The fifth time we passed Mile 0, Mom put her hand on my arm and whispered, “Don’t look outside this time.”

I tried not to, but my curiosity won.

Something stood next to the sign. Tall. Thin. Its arms hung too long, the tips of its fingers almost brushing the ground. Its head tilted at an unnatural angle, like its neck was too weak to hold it up. The headlights caught its face for a fraction of a second—just long enough for me to realize it had my father’s eyes.

I gasped, but when I looked at Dad, he was gripping the wheel tighter, staring dead ahead, jaw locked.

The sixth time we passed Mile 0, Dad wasn’t in the driver’s seat.

The RV was still moving, the wheel turning on its own. Mom screamed and lunged forward, but it was like something invisible was holding her back. I scrambled toward the front, my heart hammering, but stopped when I saw the driver.

It was the thing from the sign. Its skin stretched thin over its skull, lips curling into something almost like a smile. And it spoke in my dad’s voice:

“Almost there.”

The headlights revealed another mile marker ahead—Mile 0 again—but this time, there were three figures waiting. Two were tall and thin. The third was Dad, standing perfectly still, his head tilted just like the others.

The RV kept going. We didn’t turn around.

Month 3 • Flirting restarts: joking about who buys coffee, little shoulder taps, lingering eye contact.• Coworkers start teasing “your girlfriend’s calling you.” She smirks but never clarifies. Month 4 • I plan to ask again; she says she’s busy moving house until Thursday.• Same evening she’s suddenly icy – no goodbye at end of shift. Recent • Mutual friend tries to set up a “birthday dinner for me.” She says she might come, but only if the friend arranges it.• If I casually ask “want to hang out?” she pivots the topic.• Warm one minute, ghost-mode the next.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality of a gold bowl is persistent by a number of factors,from the purity of the gold itself to the artistry of the design and the precision of the manufacturing process. These key features seperate ordinary bowls from exceptional pieces.

**Material and Purity:** Gold bowls can be crafted from solid gold, gold-plated materials, or gold-colored alloys. Solid gold bowls offer the most value due to the inherent worth of the gold. purity is measured in karats, with 24k being pure gold. However, pure gold is often too soft for practical use, so it's often alloyed with other metals like silver, copper, or zinc to increase its durability. gold-plated bowls offer a more affordable option, where a thin layer of gold is applied to a base metal. The thickness of the gold plating is measured in microns, a thicker plating indicating greater longevity and resistance to wear. Gold colored bowls made from alloys are the least expensive and do not contain any gold but offer a similar aesthetic.

**Craftsmanship and Design:** The skill of the artisan plays a crucial role in the creation of a gold bowl. Handcrafted bowls are frequently enough more valuable than mass-produced items,exhibiting unique details and imperfections that reflect the maker's touch. The design elements, such as intricate engravings, embossed patterns, or unique shapes, contribute to the bowl's overall aesthetic appeal. Some bowls may incorporate other precious materials, such as gemstones or enamel, further enhancing their visual interest and value. The choice of artisan can drastically increase the price of the gold bowl.

**Size and Weight:** The dimensions and weight of the gold bowl will influence its functionality and suitability for different purposes. A larger bowl may be ideal for serving food or as a decorative centerpiece, while a smaller bowl may be better suited for holding jewelry or small trinkets. The weight of the bowl affects its stability and perceived value; a heavier bowl generally feels more significant and luxurious. Consider the bowl's intended use when determining the appropriate size and weight.

**Finish and Texture:** The surface finish of a gold bowl impacts its visual appeal and how it interacts with light. Polished finishes create a reflective, glossy surface, while matte finishes offer a more subdued and understated look. Hammered textures, brushed surfaces, or engraved patterns add visual interest and tactile dimension. The finish should complement the overall design and intended use of the bowl. The durability of the finish is very crucial in how long the gold bowl will sustain its original lustre.

Key features of the reviewed gold bowls include:

* Varying levels of gold purity, from solid gold to gold plating and gold colored alloys.
* Handcrafted designs with unique artistic details.
* A range of sizes and weights to suit different uses.
* diverse finishes and textures.

  1  
  
  THE SMALL JET BUMPED down hard on the runway in Portland, Maine. It rose up in the air and banged down again harder. Even the pilot was probably wondering if he could keep the twenty-five-ton jet on the tarmac. Because he was trying to beat a storm in, the young aviator had made his approach at a steeper trajectory and a faster speed than the airline’s manual recommended. The wind shear culled off the leading edge of the cold front had caused the jet’s wings to pendulum back and forth. The copilot had warned the passengers that the landing would be bumpy and a bit more than uncomfortable.  
  
  He’d been right.  
  
  The rear carriage wheels caught and held the second time around, and the lead aircraft-grade rubber bit down a few moments later. The rapid and steep flight path in had caused more than a few of the four dozen passengers on the single-aisle jet to white-knuckle their armrests, mouth a few prayers, and even reach for the barf bags in the seatbacks. When the wheel brakes and reverse thrusters engaged and the aircraft slowed perceptibly, most of the riders exhaled in relief.  
  
  One man, however, merely woke when the plane transitioned off the runway and onto the taxiway to the small terminal. The tall, dark-haired woman sitting next to him idly stared out the window, completely unfazed by the turbulent approach and bouncy touchdown.  
  
  After they’d arrived at the gate and the pilot shut down the twin GE turbofans, Sean King and Michelle Maxwell rose and grabbed their bags from the overhead. As they threaded out through the narrow aisle along with the other deplaning passengers, a queasy-looking woman behind them said, “Boy, that sure was a rough landing.”  
  
  Sean looked at her, yawned, and massaged his neck. “Was it?”  
  
  The woman looked surprised and eyed Michelle. “Is he kidding?”  
  
  She said, “When you’ve ridden on jump seats in the belly of a C-17 at low altitudes in the middle of a thunderstorm and doing thousand-foot vertical drops every ten seconds with four max-armored vehicles chained next to you and wondering if one was going to break loose and crash through the side of the fuselage and carry you with it, this landing was pretty uneventful.”  
  
  “Why in the world did you do that?” said the wide-eyed woman.  
  
  “I ask myself that every day,” replied Sean sardonically.  
  
  He and Michelle both had their clothes, toiletries, and other essentials in their carry-on bags. But they had to stop by baggage claim to pick up an eighteen-inch-long, hard-sided, locked case. It belonged to Michelle. She picked up the case and slid it into her carry-on.  
  
  Sean gave her an amused expression. “You’re the queen of the smallest checked bag of all time.”  
  
  “Until they let responsible people on planes with loaded guns, it’ll have to do the trick. Get the rental. I’ll be back in a minute.”  
  
  “You licensed to carry that up here?”  
  
  “Let’s hope we don’t have to find out.”  
  
  He blanched. “You’re kidding, right?”  
  
  “Maine has an open carry law. So long as it’s visible I can carry it without a permit.”  
  
  “But you’re putting it in a holster. That’s concealed. In fact, it’s concealed right now.”  
  
  She flipped open her wallet and showed him a card. “Which is why I have a valid nonresident’s concealed weapon’s permit for the great state of Maine.”  
  
  “How’d you score that? We only found out about this case a few days ago. You couldn’t have gotten a permit that fast. I checked into it. It’s a mountain of paperwork and a sixty-day response period.”  
  
  “My dad is good friends with the governor. I made a call to him. He made a call to the governor.”  
  
  “Nice.”  
  
  She went to the ladies’ room, entered a stall, opened the locked case, and quickly loaded her pistol. She holstered her weapon and walked to the covered parking garage adjacent to the terminal where the rental car companies were clustered. There she found Sean filling out the paperwork for the wheels they needed for the next phase of their trip. Michelle showed her operator’s license as well, since she would be doing most of the driving. It wasn’t that Sean minded driving, but Michelle was too much of a control freak to let him.  
  
  “Coffee,” she said. “There’s a place back in the terminal.”  
  
  “You had that giant cup you brought on the flight.”  
  
  “That was a while ago. And where we’re going is a long drive from here. I need the caffeine pop.”  
  
  “I slept. I can drive.”  
  
  She snagged the keys from his hand. “Don’t think so.”  
  
  “Hey, I drove the Beast, okay?” he said, referring to the presidential limo.  
  
  She eyed the rental car tag. “Then the Ford Hybrid you reserved will be no challenge. It’ll probably take me a day just to get it up to sixty. I’ll spare you the pain and humiliation.”  
  
  She got an extra-large black coffee. Sean bought a donut with sprinkles and sat in the passenger seat eating it. He dusted off his hands and moved the seat back as far as possible in the compact car, and still his six-foot-two-inch frame was bent uncomfortably. He finally ended up putting his feet on the dash.  
  
  Noting this, Michelle said, “Air bag pops out of there, it’ll smash your  
feet right through the glass and amputate them when they hit the metal roof.”  
  
  He glanced at her, a frown eclipsing his normally calm features. “Then don’t do anything to make it pop.”  
  
  “I can’t control other drivers.”  
  
  “Well, you insisted on being the wheelman—excuse me, wheelperson. So do the best you can to keep me safe and comfortable.”  
  
  “All right, master,” she snapped.  
  
  After a mile of silence Michelle said, “We sound like an old married couple.”  
  
  He looked at her again. “We’re not old and we’re not married. Unless you really slipped something by me.”  
  
  She hesitated and then just said it: “But we have slept together.

Sean started to reply but then seemed to think better of it. What came out instead seemed to be a grunt.  
  
  “It changes things,” she said.  
  
  “Why does it change things?”  
  
  “It’s not just business anymore. It’s personal. The line has been crossed.”  
  
  He sat up straight, removing his feet from the perilous reach of the air bag. “And now you regret that? You made the first move, if I recall. You got naked on me.”  
  
  “I didn’t say that I regretted anything, because I don’t.”  
  
  “Neither do I. It happened because we obviously both wanted it to happen.”  
  
  “Okay. So where does that leave us?”  
  
  He sat back against his seat and stared out the window. “I’m not sure.”  
  
  “Great, just what I wanted to hear.”  
  
  He looked across at her, noted the tense line of muscle and bone around her jaw.  
  
  “Just because I’m unsure of where to go with all this, doesn’t lessen or trivialize what happened between us. It’s complicated.”  
  
  “Right, complicated. That’s always the case. For the guy.”  
  
  “Okay, if it’s so simple for the ladies, tell me what you think we should do.”  
  
  When she didn’t answer he said, “Should we run off and find a preacher and make it official?”  
  
  She shot him a glance and the front end of the Ford swerved slightly. “Are you serious? Is that what you want?”  
  
  “I’m just throwing out ideas. Since you don’t seem to have any.”  
  
  “Do you want to get married?”  
  
  “Do you?”  
  
  “That would really change things.”  
  
  “Uh, yeah, it would.”  
  
  “Maybe we should take it slow.”  
  
  “Maybe we should.”  
  
  She tapped the steering wheel. “Sorry for jumping on you about this.”  
  
  “Forget it. And we just got Gabriel squared away with a great family. That was a big change, too. Slow is good right now. We go too fast, maybe we make a big mistake.”  
  
  Gabriel was an eleven-year-old boy from Alabama that Sean and Michelle had taken temporary custody of after his mother was killed. He was currently living with a family whose dad was an FBI agent they knew. The couple was in the process of formally adopting Gabriel.  
  
  “Okay,” she replied.  
  
  “And now we have a job to do. Let’s focus on that.”  
  
  “So that’s your priority list? Business trumps personal?”  
  
  “Not necessarily. But like you said, it’s a long drive. And I want to think about why we’re heading to the only federal maximum security institution for the criminally insane in the country, to meet with a guy whose life is definitely on the line.”  
  
  “We’re going because you and his lawyer go way back.”  
  
  “That part I get. Did you read up on Edgar Roy?”  
  
  Michelle nodded. “Government employee that lived alone in rural Virginia. His life was pretty average until the police discovered the remains of six people buried in his barn. Then his life became anything but average. The evidence to me seems overwhelming.”  
  
  Sean nodded. “Roy was found in his barn, shovel in hand, dirt on his pants, with the remains of six bodies buried in a hole he was apparently putting the finishing touches to.”  
  
  “A little tough to dance around that in court,” said Michelle.  
  
  “Too bad Roy’s not a politician.”  
  
  “Why?”  
  
  Sean smiled. “If he were a politician he could spin that story to say he was actually digging them out of the hole in order to save them but was too late; they were already dead. And now he’s being persecuted for being a Good Samaritan.”  
  
  “So he was arrested but failed a competency hearing. He was sent to Cutter’s Rock.” She paused. “But why Maine? Virginia didn’t have the facilities for him?”  
  
  “It was a federal case for some reason. That got the FBI involved. When the competency remand comes it’s wherever the Feds decide to send you. Some Fed max prison facilities have psych wards, but it was decided that Roy needed something more than that. St. Elizabeth’s in D.C. was moved to make way for a new Homeland Security HQ, and its new location was not deemed secure enough. So Cutter’s Rock was the only game in town.”  
  
  “Why the weird name?”  
  
  “It’s rocky, and a cutter is a type of ship. Maine is a seafaring state, after all.”  
  
  “I forgot you were a nautical guy.” She turned on the radio and the heater, and shivered. “God, it’s cold for not being winter yet,” she said grumpily.  
  
  “This is Maine. It can be cold any time of the year. Check the latitude.”  
  
  “The things one learns in enclosed spaces over long periods of time.”  
  
  “Now we do sound like an old married couple.” He turned his vent on full blast, zipped up his windbreaker, and closed his eyes.  
  
  CHAPTER  
  
  2  
  
  WITH MICHELLE’S FOOT typically heavy on the gas the Ford raced along Interstate 95, past the towns of Yarmouth and Brunswick and on toward the state capital in Augusta. Once past Augusta, with the next big town coming up being Bangor, Michelle began eyeing the surroundings. There were dense evergreen trees on either side of the highway. A full moon gave the forests a silvery veneer that made Michelle think of wax paper over salad greens. They passed a warning sign for moose crossing the highway.  
  
  “Moose?” she said, glancing at Sean.  
  
  He didn’t open his eyes. “Maine’s state animal. You don’t want to hit one. They weigh more than this Ford. And they have nasty tempers. Kill you in a heartbeat.”  
  
  “How do you know? Have you ever encountered one?”  
  
  “No, but I’m a big fan of Animal Planet.”  
  
  They drove on for another hour. Michelle continually scanned the area, left to right and back the other way, like human radar. It was a habit so drilled into her that even after being out of the Secret Service all this time she couldn’t shake it. But as a private investigator maybe she didn’t want to shake it. Observations made you forewarned. And being forewarned was never a bad thing, particularly if someone was trying to kill you, which people often seemed to want to do to her and Sean.  
  
  “There’s something wrong here,” she said.  
  
  Sean opened his eyes. “Like what?” he asked, doing his own quick scan.  
  
  “We’re on Interstate 95. Runs from Florida to Maine. Long stretch of asphalt. Big travel route. Pipeline of East Coast vacationers.”  
  
  “Right, so?”  
  
  “So we’re the only fricking car on it in either direction, and have been for at least a half hour. What, was there a nuclear war and no one told us?” Her finger hit the scan button on the radio. “I need news. I need civilization. I need to know we’re not the only ones left alive.”  
  
  “Will you chill? It’s just isolated up here. Interstate or not. Lots of space, not lots of people. Most of the population lives near the coast, Portland, back where we came from. The rest of the state is big on land and pretty low on human beings. Hell, Aroostook County is bigger than Rhode Island and Connecticut combined. In fact, Maine is as large as all the other New England states put together. And once we get past Bangor and keep heading north, it gets even more isolated. The interstate stops near the town of Houlton. Then you take Route 1 the rest of the way up towards the northern tip of the Canadian border.”  
  
  “What’s up there?”  
  
  “Places like Presque Isle, Fort Kent, and Madawaska.”  
  
  “And moose?”  
  
  “I suppose. Lucky we’re not going there. It’s really far.”  
  
  “Couldn’t we have flown into Bangor? They have an airport, right? Or Augusta?”  
  
  “No direct flights. Most of the available flights had two or three stops. One took us all the way south to Orlando before heading north. We could have flown out of Baltimore, but we’d have to connect through LaGuardia and that’s always dicey. And we would have still had to drive to Baltimore, and 95 can be a nightmare. It’s faster and more certain this way.”  
  
  “Yo  
u’re just a fountain of useful facts. You’ve been to Maine much?”  
  
  “One of the former presidents I protected has a summer place up here.”  
  
  “Bush Forty-One at Walker’s Point?”  
  
  “You got it.”  
  
  “But that’s southern coastal Maine. Kennebunkport. We flew over it going into Portland.”  
  
  “Beautiful area. We’d follow Bush in our chase boat. Could never keep up with him. Guy’s fearless. Has over eight hundred HP spread over three Mercury outboards on a thirty-two-footer named the Fidelity III. Man loved to go full throttle in the open Atlantic in pretty heavy chop. I rode in the Zodiac chase boat trying to keep up with him. Only time I’ve ever puked on duty.”  
  
  “But that area’s not as isolated as this,” said Michelle.  
  
  “No, lot more humanity down there.” He looked at his watch. “And it’s late. Most people up here probably rise at dawn to go to work. That means they’re probably already in bed.” He yawned. “Like I wish I was.”  
  
  Michelle checked the GPS. “Around Bangor we get off the interstate and head east to the coast.”  
  
  He nodded. “In between the towns of Machias and Eastport. Right on the water. Lot of back roads. Not easy to get to, which makes sense because then it’s not easy to get away from if a homicidal maniac has managed to escape.”  
  
  “Has anyone ever escaped from Cutter’s Rock?”  
  
  “Not to my knowledge. And if they ever did, they’d have two options: the wilderness or the chilly waters of the Gulf of Maine. Neither one is too palatable. And Mainers are hardy folk. Probably not even homicidal maniacs would want to cross them.”  
  
  “So we’re hooking up with Bergin tonight?”  
  
  “Yep. At the inn where we’re staying.” Sean checked his watch. “In about two and a half hours. Then we see Roy at ten tomorrow morning.”  
  
  “So how do you know Bergin again?”  
  
  “He was my law professor at UVA. Great guy. Was in private practice before he started teaching. Few years after I graduated he hung his shingle back out. Defense lawyer, obviously. Has an office in Charlottesville.”  
  
  “How’d he end up repping a psycho like Edgar Roy?”  
  
  “He specializes in hopeless cases, I guess. But he’s a first-rate attorney. I don’t know what his connection is to Roy. I’m assuming he’ll fill us in on that, too.”  
  
  “And you never did elaborate on why Bergin engaged us.”  
  
  “I didn’t elaborate because I’m not quite sure. He called, said he was making headway in Roy’s case and needed some investigation done by people he could trust in preparation for taking the case to trial.”  
  
  “What sort of headway? From my reading of the case they’re only waiting for him to get his mind back so they can convict him and then execute him.”  
  
  “I don’t profess to understand what Bergin’s theory is. He didn’t want to discuss it on the phone.”  
  
  Michelle shrugged. “I guess we’ll find out soon enough.”  
  
  They left the interstate, and Michelle steered the Ford east along increasingly poor and windy surface roads. As they neared the ocean waters, the briny smell invaded the car.  
  
  “Fishy, my favorite,” she said sarcastically.  
  
  “Get used to that smell. It’ll be everywhere up here.”  
  
  She calculated they were about thirty minutes from their destination along a particularly lonely patch of road when the silvery night was broken by another set of car lights. Only they weren’t on the road. They were on the shoulder. Michelle automatically slowed as Sean rolled down his window for a better look.  
  
  “Flashers,” he said. “Somebody’s broken down.”  
  
  “Should we pull over?”  
  
  He debated this. “I suppose. They might not even be able to get cell reception up here.” He poked his head out for a better look. “It’s a Buick. I doubt someone would use a Buick to lure unsuspecting motorists into a trap.”  
  
  Michelle touched the gun in its holster. “I doubt we qualify as unsuspecting motorists.”  
  
  She slowed the Ford and pulled in behind the other car. The hazard lights blinked off and on, off and on. In the vastness of coastal Maine it looked like a small conflagration stuck in the limbo of fits and starts.  
  
  “Somebody’s in the driver’s seat,” noted Michelle, as she put the Ford in park. “Only person I can see.”  
  
  “Then he might be worried about us. I’ll get out and put the person at ease.”  
  
  “I’ve got your back in case someone’s hiding in the floorboard and they don’t want to be put at ease.”  
  
  He swung his long legs out and approached the car slowly from the passenger’s side. His feet crunched over the sparse shoulder gravel. His breath came out as puffs of smoke in the chilled air. From somewhere among the trees he heard an animal’s call and briefly wondered if it was a moose. Animal Planet hadn’t been clear on what a moose actually sounded like. And Sean had no interest in finding out for himself.  
  
  He called out, “Do you need any help?”  
  
  Blink, blink of the hazard lights. No response.  
  
  He looked down at his cell phone clutched in his hand. He had reception bars. “Are you broken down? Do you want us to call a tow truck for you?”  
  
  Nothing. He reached the car, tapped on the side window. “Hello? You okay?”  
  
  He saw the silhouette of the driver through the window. It was a man. “Sir, you okay?” The guy didn’t budge.  
  
  Sean’s next thought was a medical emergency. Maybe a heart attack. A marine haze had obscured the moonlight. It was so dark inside the car he couldn’t make out many details. He heard a car door open and turned back to see Michelle climb out of their ride, her hand on the butt of her weapon. She glanced at him for communication.  
  
  “I think the guy’s in medical distress.”  
  
  She nodded and moved forward; her boots made clicks on the asphalt.  
  
  Sean eased around to the driver’s side and tapped on the window. In the darkness all he could see was the man’s outline. The red light from the flashers lit the interior of the car, casting the surroundings into a bright crimson before going dark again, like the car was heating up one second and going cool the next. But it didn’t help Sean see inside the car. It only made it more difficult. He tapped on the glass once more.  
  
  “Sir? Are you all right?”  
  
  He tried the door. It was unlocked. He opened it. The man slumped sideways, held in the car only by his seat harness. Sean grabbed the man’s shoulder and righted him as Michelle rushed forward.  
  
  “Heart attack?” she said.  
  
  Sean looked at the man’s face. “No,” he said firmly.  
  
  “How do you know?”  
  
  He used the light from his cell phone to illuminate the single gunshot wound between the man’s pupils. There was blood and grayish brain matter all over the car’s interior.  
  
  Michelle drew closer and said, “Contact wound. You can see the gun’s muzzle and sight mark burned onto his skin. Don’t think a moose did that.”  
  
  Sean said nothing.  
  
  “Check his wallet for some ID.”  
  
  “Don’t have to.”  
  
  “Why not?” she asked.  
  
  “Because I know him,” replied Sean.  
  
  “What? Who is he?”  
  
  “Ted Bergin. My old professor and Edgar Roy’s lawyer.”  
  
  CHAPTER 3  
 THE LOCAL POLICE SHOWED up first. A single Washington County deputy in a dented and dusty but serviceable American-made V8 with an array of communication antennas drilled into the trunk. He came out of the cruiser with one hand on his service weapon and his gaze fastened on Sean and Michelle. He warily approached. They explained what had happened and he checked the body, muttered the word “Damn,” and then hastily called in backup.  
  
  Fifteen minutes later two Maine State Police cruisers from Field Troop J slid to stops behind them. The troopers, young, tall, and lean, came out of their aquamarine cars; their crisp blue uniforms seemed to glow like colored ice even in the weak, hazy light. The crime scene was secured and a perimeter guard established. Sean and Michelle were interviewed by the troopers. One of the officers pecked the responses into the portable laptop he’d yanked from his cruiser.  
  
  When Sean told them who they were and why they were here, and, more important, who Ted Bergin was and that he represented Edgar Roy, one of the troopers walked away and used his handheld mic to presumably call in more assets. As they waited for reinforcements, Sean said, “You guys know about Edgar Roy?”  
  
  One of them replied, “Everybody around here knows about Edgar Roy.”  
  
  Michelle said, “Why’s that?”  
  
  The other trooper said, “FBI will be here quick as they can.”  
  
  “FBI?” exclaimed Sean.  
  
  The trooper nodded. “Roy’s a federal prisoner. We got clear instructions from Washington. Anything happens with him, they get called in. That’s what I just did. Well, I told the lieutenant and he’s calling it in.”  
  
  “Where’s the closest FBI Field Office?” asked Michelle.  
  
  “Boston.”  
  
  “Boston? But we’re in Maine.”  
  
  “FBI doesn’t maintain an official office in Maine. It all goes through Boston, Mass.”  
  
  Sean said, “It’s a long way to Boston. Do we have to stay until they get here? We’re both pretty beat.”  
  
  “Our lieutenant is on the way. You can talk to him about it.”  
  
  Twenty minutes later the lieutenant arrived and he was not sympathetic. “Just sit tight” was all he said before turning away from them to confer with his men and look over the crime scene.  
  
  The Evidence Response Team arrived a couple of minutes later, all ready to bag and tag. Sean and Michelle sat on the hood of their Ford and watched the process. Bergin was officially pronounced dead by what Sean assumed was a coroner or medical examiner—he couldn’t recall what system Maine used. They gleaned from snatched bits of conversation among the techs and troopers that the bullet was still in the dead man’s head.

1movk6v,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1movk6v,Need some help with our oddly shaped living room,"Hey! We recently moved in to our first apartment and have had a first pass at putting together our living room. It is weirdly long with windows at both ends and a random fireplace, so we struggled a lot with placing the couch and TV. At the moment the TV is on a wheeled stand and we drag it out when we want to watch. 

The couch belongs to the landlord so we can't change it, but everything else is up for grabs. The fireplace also doesn't work so it's just decoration.

  
Currently the room feels a bit disconnected, with the chair and couch too far away for conversation, and the ottoman is kind of just floating. A coffee table would be nice, and we'd also like some lamps but aren't sure where we'd put them. 

We know we probably need a rug but struggle to find one long+narrow enough to cover the whole room, and aren't sure what colour/style to go with. (We also aren't sure if the TV on wheels will play nicely with a rug). Any advice to make the room more cohesive and functional would be much appreciated!",2,1755061624.0,DesignMyRoom,2,1.0,False

Lysa took a moment and straightened Martinez’s tie with the care and precision of a seasoned drill master, assuring it was perfectly centered. It could pass the inspection of even the most anal retentive drill sergeant. Afterward, she stepped back and looked her man up and down, plucking apart every detail of his dress blue uniform, finding Martinez's cleaned-up visage mouthwatering.

He was so tempting, she was tempted to shred the cloth away and have her way with him. As far as she was concerned, there was not a hot-blooded woman on his side of Stelara who would not want to do the same. 	Sleek ash-grey material made up the majority of the uniform’s surface; bright golden piping held tightly around the cuffs and trouser bottoms, and an equally golden stripe of flat felt ran up the side of his trouser legs on each flank, signifying something about his rank.  
  
Inverted coal-black chevrons ran down each sleeve of the blazer, with each nestling atop a caduceus with a Human skull at the spear's tip. But what really drew her eye was his ribbon rack. 	The kaleidoscope of colors signifying his storied military service was as detailed and told his tale nearly as well as the scars crawling across his skin. The three-across and ten-high set of accolades was enriched by dozens of oakleaf clusters and stars: bronze, silver, and gold, in both shapes.  
  
Lysa was not precisely sure what each enhancement to the ribbons meant, and had tried to ask Martinez about them, but he seemed distant as he was preparing. He only responded with general short answers that told her nothing. 'Oh, it was for valor, or it was for receiving it multiple times.'   
  
None of her lovers truly illuminated anything about his military history. It was something he kept private, not because he feared her discovering it, but because he didn't see the ribbons and medals as something one should wear proudly.   
  
His cagieness was simply a result of the effect of most of them being gifts from the grim reaper, signifiers of his lowest points in life. Handed to him by a skeletal hand after paying the toll of his friend's blood and immortal souls. 	He only received honors as proof of his desperate attempts to save others, which often resulted in failure; that was not because of his inability. Martinez truly did all he could with what he had. But the big Navy did not care enough about them.   
  
His units were just simple infantry elements on a distant world thousands of light-years from Earth. Whatever the Destroyer had, and whatever scraps the GU big military would toss them was all they had. 	On those detestable rocks, they were forgotten, left to fend for themselves and make do. A mentality that had been itchingly its way into his mind as the GU and Aviex Government were pressuring him and his family into a corner. He continued each day to feel a violent willingness growing in his mind. 	He had fought many times in the past. Killed with ruthless abandon for his patients. Fought side by side with Marines, knowing often the best medicine for them was lead down range. Now...he was unsure if that would work.   
  
Martinez knew he was well out of his scope of control and ability. He might as well be a flare comparing itself to the vast infinity of a quasar when judged against the entities he struggled against. A simple bullet to someone's head to protect others would not save them. Lysa. His children.  And he knew it. 	The only ribbon that Martinez did not answer about with a singular vernacular was the lone one at the top of the stack of ten, all alone and colored in a way that did not match any of the others.   
  
It was vibrant baby blue, with stars spattering its surface. All she received as an explanation for that one was: it was a toll. A cost he paid; one that he still wonders if he should have.   
  
While it was not much, it was a glimpse into the darkness that waged war against Martinez's sleep. The answer told Lysa enough. She should not pry into that story. He could tell it if he was ever ready; If he ever did, she would be there to hold him, comfort him, and let him say his side of the tale with no judgement---with a weight that made him stand with a tilt, it was the least he deserved.   
  
Lysa stepped back and admired her man, smiling warmly as he looked himself over in the mirror.	 “You look amazing,” Lysa said, stepping closer to him and placing a small kiss on his cheek.  
  
Truth be told, Martinez had only ever worn his dress blues four times before this, despite having been in the Human Navy for almost twelve long, long years: once at graduation from basic training, once at some random colonel’s promotion ceremony, thirdly when he was awarded The Honor of Humanity medal, and lastly at the funeral for the men he failed to save to receive that accolade.  
  
Having to wear his dress blues to go out for a dinner with Chloe, so he could pay off part of his debt to her. So she could showboat around her new plaything to the other political jockeys within Draun—the mere idea of him having to put on this sacred uniform made his blood boil and his stomach churn.	He looked back into Lysa’s eyes and smiled, reaching up and cupping her cheek. She leaned into his touch and crept closer to him. Her warmth, presence, and very existence reminded him of why he was going to shut his mouth and tolerate the treatment Chloe planned for him.  
  
He could not be as short-sighted as he had been up until this point in his life. His life was no longer just his, and never would be again. It was also hers. As they embraced one another and gently kissed, a slight shift inside Lysa’s belly hammered home that it was not just her, but the little ones that were theirs as well.	Martinez had to live for them, and would do all that was needed to remain right here, with them. Even if it cost him his limbs, bones, and very soul. He would kill all he was if it meant they would be safeguarded against the dark uncaring universe.  
  
“I’ve got to go,” Martinez said, as Lysa refused to let go of the embrace. “I will meet you at the door. I gotta grab a few things.”  
  
She had felt the distance between them growing—how Martinez was not acting like the warm man she knew. He was quiet, reserved, and looked almost fearfully at her from the corners of his eyes. She clutched tighter as if letting him go tonight would be the last time they would see one another—a fear she could not explain screamed in her mind that he would fade away and vanish from her life, like the dying streak of a comet in the night.  
  
“Do you have to? We could watch a movie or something instead? I’m certain Mouse would not mind re-watching some of those westerns you have,” Lysa nearly pleaded, pressing his hand against her still rolling stomach. “Even they want you to stay.”  
  
“I know, but I have to go,” Martinez replied, lingering in her embrace for a moment longer. ""I don't have a choice. Chloe needs me.""  
  
They separated, and Lysa left reluctantly, leaving Martinez alone in their bedroom as she went to wait for him at the front porch.  
  
Once Lysa was out of sight, Martinez quickly retrieved his pistol from the dresser, checked the chamber for a loaded round, and shoved it into a holster in his waistband. Chloe said he should remain armed at all times until the political situation blew over, and he was not about to ignore her advice; she held the keys to his proverbial handcuffs. The last thing he needed to do was upset her.  
  
Outside the house, a van was waiting for Martinez. Chloe lingered, waiting for the centerpiece of her show; she wore an intricately designed red dress. Its shimmering material held tightly to her lithe build, complementing her tanned skin and dark hair.  
  
Lysa looked down at herself, then back up at Chloe and frowned. Lysa was far heavier than she was months ago; none of her clothes fit anymore, and she could feel the extra layers of fat clinging to her body, especially around her thighs, hips, and stomach. Was she aware that it was perfectly natural for her species to put on 10 to 15 kilograms during gestation? Of course she did. But that did not stop her from feeling somewhat self-conscious of her more voluptuous, soft build.	Gone were the days of her meat-grinding abs, skull-crushing legs, and biceps that could make the average Aviex male seethe with jealousy. She was softer, more womanly, and prepared to rear her children. Even if it grated against her mental image of the perfect woman.   
  
If her mother’s figure was anything to go by, Lysa would likely hold onto this weight and just be a bit more heavily built for the rest of her life. Urla knew her mother indeed clung to the baby weight like abandoning it meant she was no longer a mother.   
  
She smiled as Martinez loaded into the back of the car, following Chloe’s lead. She watched longingly as the car pulled away and its lights vanished into the shimmering distance of Draun’s uncountable flickering streetlamps.  
  
Turning back around and returning inside, Lysa lowered herself gently onto the sofa and let out a massive, exasperated sigh, as if her breath could blow away all her troubles.   
  
Lysa wanted to go with Martinez tonight, but apparently Chloe only had an invitation for one, and Martinez—the war hero, the Human who showed off what their species should be—was welcome. Not her, not his lady love, Gra’hu, and possible wife. She was just an accessory to the true prize in Chloe’s eyes.  
  
Lysa was not needed, just a part of the picture that could be ignored. Lysa kicked the coffee table, frustrated by the Human liaison's lack of recognition of her.    
  
“So what’s on your mind?” Mouse asked, interrupting the Aviex woman's pouting, sauntering out from the spare bedroom and settling into a chair across from her, munching on another protein bar. “No one sighs like that unless something is pecking at them.”  
  
“It’s nothing you would understand,” Lysa replied, trying to get Mouse to leave bad enough alone.	Having him around the house had been surprisingly enjoyable. Mouse was clean, unobtrusive, and incredibly respectful of the fact that this was Lysa’s house; Chloe had even arranged to give Lysa money to assist with feeding the massive man—a sum that was easily double the month-by-month cost to operate the entire house, mortgage included.  
  
The only reason she was aware that Mouse was in the house most days was that he was awake early, cooking his meals for the day —high-protein meals that the man was more than happy to share with Lysa, a thing she as an aviex needed desperately; his offering to her necessity further amplified her growing weight issues, but the suculance made her nearly ignore it...nearly.  
  
She could not help it; each breakfast burrito he whipped up was the most succulent, delectable thing she had ever eaten; they might as well be catnip for Aviex. Ground meat, cheese, and extra fat, such as butter. Lysa might as well have been sleepwalking to his treat offerings.   
  
But despite her appreciation of having him around, keeping her and Martinez safe, she still would prefer not to open up to someone who might as well be a complete stranger. The last thing she needed to do was open up to a man who might as well be a stranger.   
  
But Lysa knew Mouse was sharp and would be able to see through any lie she tossed out, so a more direct approach was needed here. “So can we just not talk about it?” 	“Hey, I am just here as an extra gun, not your therapist. If you wanna keep it to yourself, be my guest…But, in all my years of dealing with heartbreakers and life takers, do you know what the worst thing to do when you're stressed out is?” Mouse asked, leaning forward and raising a brow.   
  
The hulking man delivered the question in a slow, melodic tone; one that made it well known he knew you did not know the answer, but wanted you to pause, take a step back, and really think about the deep hole you were digging for yourself.  
  
It was the type of inquiry that would usually be delivered by a preacher, not by a man built like a gorilla and with the temperament of a so-cal surfer bro, and a penchant to dance to upbeat hip hop while overhead pressing 200 kilos for reps.   
  
The staccato delivery and method was the same tone one would give when teaching someone how to surf on the blistering white sands of Zegaba Beach—a location that Mouse had spent many a blissful afternoon surrounded by alien women; at least until his past and the Human government scooped him up for his stint as a L.O.S.T soul. A life that ripped him from loose women and morals.    
  
Lysa paused and thought about the question. She leaned on all she had learned from her time alone, and the myriad of lessons taught to her by Teacher. After a few moments of pondering, she smirked and looked up at Mouse, not directly answering him, but confident that she had drawn the correct answer. “So what did you have in mind to do?”	“Yeah, you are a sharp one,” Mouse nodded, glad Lysa was as sharp as a nano-blade. “I was thinking we could take the time to maybe finish up that nursery you and the big hero have been putting off?”   
  
Lysa cringed slightly at the reminder of that ill-forgotten room. She had meant to fully furnish it and complete it all. In all honesty, she was planning on relying on her parents, who were due to arrive within the week, to complete the time-consuming task of assembling cradles, toy boxes, and other matters of memorabilia she and Martinez deemed fit for their children.  
  
“It ain’t like sitting here, shooting the breeze, and longing on the big man suffering through a ‘date’ with Chloe is helping you all.” Mouse continued emphasizing the word ""date"" with a layer of sarcasm, so that you could cut the sound with a knife, while gesturing to Lysa, while referring to both her and her unborn.   
  
“I suppose you do have a point. But you make their outing sound like torture,” Lysa smiled. 	Mouse leaned back, taking another bite of his protein bar, nearly kicking his legs up but remembering Lysa’s warning about doing so; instead, he crossed his legs beneath the coffee table and chewed on the near nutrionian fluid-like sustenance bar. He chewed on that bar, just as he did on his thoughts, unsure of how to convey to someone vastly disconnected from his life experience what Martinez would be going through.   
  
“He is definitely not happy. I think it might be similar to how you felt when you encountered that other Aviex. Dewliner, or whatever the fuck his name was. Sorry, I just really don’t care about him. But yeah, when he tried to strut you around for the cameras. Chloe is doing the same for Martinez. Using his  Honor of Humanity medal as a spotlight for her ability to network or something.” Mouse explained, speaking about it as if Martinez’s strife of the medal clinging to his chest meant nothing. 	“So he is being used as a showpiece?” Lysa asked, her disdain evident in the venom lacing her words.  
  
“Yep,” Mouse clarified, finding the tenacious venom on Lysa’s words somewhat cute.	Mouse had no doubt that the Aviex could fight, and likely had the right headspace to kill, but compared to what he was accustomed to, she was a downright amateur brawler.	He had seen enough videos of her fighting and was well aware of the Teacher warning Blondie to shove off. He knew there was a monster buried underneath her facade of an ideal mother and wife. Lysa would tear anyone who put her children in harm's way apart. Her siege against them would be more chaotic than a full-grown mama grizzly deciding you were a problem.   
  
Mouse pitied the sentient who attempted to harm her. Not only because of him. But her ferocious willingness. Even he knew. If he ever dared harm her, or Martinez, mamabear would strike lethally. 		“Well, I think we should make something for him to eat when he gets home,” Lysa said, thinking once again like a dutiful wife wanting to support her man through thick, thin, and all betwixt.  
  
“Let’s make some protein brownies,” Mouse said, standing and offering her his massive meaty mitt. “After we build that nursery. And don’t you worry little lass, I will hold the panels in place, all you gotta do is use the wrench.” 	“Yeah, let's do that,” Lysa replied, taking the hand and slightly yelping when the vast strength difference between Martinez and Mouse was shown to her yet again. Mouse pulled her up like she weighed nothing at all.   
  
Martinez might be mentally resilient and strong for a man his age, but Mouse had that same granite determination, but wrapped in the body of a man with proper singular focus.   
  
They then went to the yet-to-be-built nursery, a room beside Lya and Martinez's, and across the hall from his own. They turned on music, Mouses playlist, and got to work. Just as Mouse had inferred, the world drifted away as they worked. Nothing bothered them, just one small victory after another, keeping their once idle hands and minds occupied with the little things they could do to prepare for the future.  
  
That was how the evening went for them, until the acting roached of Draun made their move and shattered not only Lysa’s perfect perception of the lie sold to her by Mouse, Blondie, Chloe and her love; no their actions also shattered Martinez, making him question his very soul and what the cost of someone's soul could be weighed against

I didn’t want to jump to conclusions, but it’s been days and I can’t shake the image. My friend has no idea. I feel torn between telling them and staying out of it.

1movdw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1movdw5/tales_of_a_fourth_grade_nothing_novel_by_judy/,Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing Novel by Judy Blume:,"The Big Winner  
  
  I won Dribble at Jimmy Fargo’s birthday party. All the other guys got to take home goldfish in little plastic bags. I won him because I guessed there were three hundred and forty-eight jelly beans in Mrs. Fargo’s jar. Really, there were four hundred and twenty-three, she told us later. Still, my guess was closest. “Peter Warren Hatcher is the big winner!” Mrs. Fargo announced.  
  
  At first I felt bad that I didn’t get a goldfish too. Then Jimmy handed me a glass bowl. Inside there was some water and three rocks. A tiny green turtle was sleeping on the biggest rock. All the other guys looked at their goldfish. I knew what they were thinking. They wished they could have tiny green turtles too.  
  
  I named my turtle Dribble while I was walking home from Jimmy’s party. I live at 25 West 68th Street. It’s an old apartment building. But it’s got one of the best elevators in New York City. There are mirrors all around. You can see yourself from every angle. There’s a soft, cushioned bench to sit on if you’re too tired to stand. The elevator operator’s name is Henry Bevelheimer. He lets us call him Henry because Bevelheimer’s very hard to say.  
  
  Our apartment’s on the twelfth floor. But I don’t have to tell Henry. He already knows. He knows everybody in the building. He’s that smart! He even knows I’m nine and in fourth grade.  
  
  I showed him Dribble right away. “I won him at a birthday party,” I said.  
  
  Henry smiled. “Your mother’s going to be surprised.”  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  Henry was right. My mother was really surprised. Her mouth opened when I said, “Just look at what I won at Jimmy Fargo’s birthday party.” I held up my tiny green turtle. “I’ve already named him . . . Dribble! Isn’t that a great name for a turtle?”  
  
  My mother made a face. “I don’t like the way he smells,” she said.  
  
  “What do you mean?” I asked. I put my nose right down close to him. I didn’t smell anything but turtle. So Dribble smells like turtle, I thought. Well, he’s supposed to. That’s what he is!  
  
  “And I’m not going to take care of him either,” my mother added.  
  
  “Of course you’re not,” I told her. “He’s my turtle. And I’m the one who’s going to take care of him.”  
  
  “You’re going to change his water and clean out his bowl a  
nd feed him and all of that?” she asked.  
  
  “Yes,” I said. “And even more. I’m going to see to it that he’s happy!”  
  
  This time my mother made a funny noise. Like a groan.  
  
  I went into my bedroom. I put Dribble on top of my dresser. I tried to pet him and tell him he would be happy living with me. But it isn’t easy to pet a turtle. They aren’t soft and furry and they don’t lick you or anything. Still, I had my very own pet at last.  
  
  Later, when I sat down at the dinner table, my mother said, “I smell turtle. Peter, go and scrub your hands!”  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  Some people might think that my mother is my biggest problem. She doesn’t like turtles and she’s always telling me to scrub my hands. That doesn’t mean just run them under the water. Scrub means I’m supposed to use soap and rub my hands together. Then I’ve got to rinse and dry them. I ought to know by now. I’ve heard it enough!  
  
  But my mother isn’t my biggest problem. Neither is my father. He spends a lot of time watching commercials on TV. That’s because he’s in the advertising business. These days his favorite commercial is the one about Juicy-O. He wrote it himself. And the president of the Juicy-O company liked it so much he sent my father a whole crate of Juicy-O for our family to drink. It tastes like a combination of oranges, pineapples, grapefruits, pears, and bananas. (And if you want to know the truth, I’m getting pretty sick of drinking it.) But Juicy-O isn’t my biggest problem either.  
  
  My biggest problem is my brother, Farley Drexel Hatcher. He’s two-and-a-half years old. Everybody calls him Fudge. I feel sorry for him if he’s going to grow up with a name like Fudge, but I don’t say a word. It’s none of my business.  
  
  Fudge is always in my way. He messes up everything he sees. And when he gets mad he throws himself flat on the floor and he screams. And he kicks. And he bangs his fists. The only time I really like him is when he’s sleeping. He sucks four fingers on his left hand and makes a slurping noise.  
  
  When Fudge saw Dribble he said, “Ohhhhh . . . see!”  
  
  And I said, “That’s my turtle, get it? Mine! You don’t touch him.”  
  
  Fudge said, “No touch.” Then he laughed like crazy.  
  
  2  
  
  Mr. and Mrs. Juicy-O  
  
  One night my father came home from the office all excited. He told us Mr. and Mrs. Yarby were coming to New York. He’s the president of the Juicy-O company. He lives in Chicago. I wondered if he’d bring my father another crate of Juicy-O. If he did I’d probably be drinking it for the rest of my life. Just thinking about it was enough to make my stomach hurt.  
  
  My father said he invited Mr. and Mrs. Yarby to stay with us. My mother wanted to know why they couldn’t stay at a hotel like most people who come to New York. My father said they could. But he didn’t want them to. He thought they’d be more comfortable staying with us. My mother said that was about the silliest thing she’d ever heard.  
  
  But she fixed up Fudge’s bedroom for our guests. She put fancy sheets and a brand-new blanket on the hide-a-bed. That’s a sofa that opens up into a bed at night. It’s in Fudge’s room because that used to be our den. Before he was born we watched TV in there. And lots of times Grandma slept over on the hide-a-bed. Now we watch TV right in the living room. And Grandma doesn’t sleep over very often.  
  
  My mother moved Fudge’s crib into my room. He’s going to get a regular bed when he’s three, my mother says. There are a lot of reasons I don’t like to sleep in the same room as Fudge. I found that out two months ago when my bedroom was being painted. I had to sleep in Fudge’s room for three nights because the paint smell made me cough. For one thing, he talks in his sleep. And if a person didn’t know better, a person could get scared. Another thing is that slurping noise he makes. It’s true that I like to hear it when I’m awake, but when I’m trying to fall asleep I like things very quiet.  
  
  When I complained about having to sleep with Fudge my mother said, “It’s just for two nights, Peter.”  
  
  “I’ll sleep in the living room,” I suggested. “On the sofa . . . or even a chair.”  
  
  “No,” my mother said. “You will sleep in your bedroom. In your own bed!”  
  
  There was no point in arguing. Mom wasn’t going to change her mind.  
  
  She spent the day in the kitchen. She really cooked up a storm. She used so many pots and pans Fudge didn’t have any left to bang together. And that’s one of his favorite pastimes—banging pots and pans together. A person can get an awful headache listening to that racket.  
  
  Right after lunch my mother opened up the dinner table. We don’t have a separate dining room. When we have company for dinner we eat in one end of the living room. When Mom finished setting the table she put a silver bowl filled with flowers right in the middle. I said, “Hey, Mom . . . it looks like you’re expecting the President or something.”  
  
  “Very funny, Peter!” my mother answered.  
  
  Sometimes my mother laughs like crazy at my jokes. Other times she pretends not to get them. And then, there are times when I know she gets them but she doesn’t seem to like them. This was one of those times. So I decided no more jokes until after dinner.  
  
  I went to Jimmy Fargo’s for the afternoon. I came home at four o’clock. I found my mother standing over the dinner table mumbling. Fudge was on the floor playing with my father’s socks. I’m not sure why he likes socks so much, but if you give him a few pairs he’ll play quietly for an hour.  
  
  I said, “Hi, Mom. I’m home.”  
  
  “I’m missing two flowers,” my mother said.  
  
  I don’t know how she noticed that two flowers were missing from her silver bowl. Because there were at least a dozen of them left. But sure enough, when I checked, I saw two stems with nothing on them.  
  
  “Don’t look at me, Mom,” I said. “What would I do with two measly flowers?”  
  
  So we both looked at Fudge. “Did you take Mommy’s pretty flowers?” my mother asked him.  
  
  “No take,” Fudge said. He was chewing on something.  
  
  “What’s in your mouth?” my mother asked.  
  
  Fudge didn’t answer.  
  
  “Show Mommy!”  
  
  “No show,” Fudge said.  
  
  “Oh yes!” My mother picked him up and forced his mouth open. She fished out a rose petal.  
  
  “What did you do with Mommy’s flowers?” She raised her voice. She was really getting upset.  
  
  Fudge laughed.  
  
  “Tell Mommy!”  
  
  “Yum!” Fudge said. “Yummy yummy yummy!”  
  
  “Oh no!” my mother cried, rushing to the telephone.  
  
  She called Dr. Cone. She told him that Fudge ate two flowers. Dr. Cone must have asked what kind, because my mother said, “Roses, I think. But I can’t be sure. One might have been a daisy.”  
  
  There was a long pause while my mother listened to whatever Dr. Cone had to say. Then Mom said, “Thank you, Dr. Cone.” She hung up.  
  
  “No more flowers!” she told Fudge. “You understand?”  
  
  “No more,” Fudge repeated. “No more . . . no more . . . no more.”  
  
  My mother gave him a spoonful of peppermint-flavored medicine. The kind I take when I have stomach pains. Then she carried Fudge off to have his bath.  
  
  Leave it to my brother to eat flowers! I wondered how they tasted. Maybe they’re delicious and I don’t know it because I’ve never tasted one, I thought. I decided to find out. I picked off one petal from a pink rose. I put it in my mouth and tried to chew it up. But I couldn’t do it. It tasted awful. I spit it out in the garbage. Well, at least now I knew I wasn’t missing anything great!  
  
  Fudge ate his supper in the kitchen before our company arrived. While he was eating I heard my mother remind him, “Fudgie’s going to be a good boy tonight. Very good for Daddy’s friends.”  
  
  “Good,” Fudge said. “Good boy.”  
  
&nbs  
p; “That’s right!” my mother told him.  
  
  I changed and scrubbed up while Fudge finished his supper. I was going to eat with the company. Being nine has its advantages!  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  My mother was all dressed up by the time my father got home with the Yarbys. You’d never have guessed that Mom spent most of the day in the kitchen. You’d also never have guessed that Fudge ate two flowers. He was feeling fine. He even smelled nice—like baby powder.  
  
  Mrs. Yarby picked him up right away. I knew she would. She looked like a grandmother. That type always makes a big deal out of Fudge. She walked into the living room cuddling him. Then she sat down on the sofa and bounced Fudge around on her lap.  
  
  “Isn’t he the cutest little boy!” Mrs. Yarby said. “I just love babies.” She gave him a big kiss on the top of his head. I kept waiting for somebody to tell her Fudge was no baby. But no one did.  
  
  My father carried the Yarbys’ suitcase into Fudge’s room. When he came back he introduced me to our company.  
  
  “This is our older son, Peter,” he said to the Yarbys.  
  
  “I’m nine and in fourth grade,” I told them.  
  
  “How do, Peter,” Mr. Yarby said.  
  
  Mrs. Yarby just gave me a nod. She was still busy with Fudge. “I have a surprise for this dear little boy!” she said. “It’s in my suitcase. Should I go get it?”  
  
  “Yes,” Fudge shouted. “Go get . . . go get!”  
  
  Mrs. Yarby laughed, as if that was the best joke she ever heard. “I’ll be right back,” she told Fudge. She put him down and ran off to find her suitcase.  
  
  She came back carrying a present tied up with a red ribbon.  
  
  “Ohhhh!” Fudge cried, opening his eyes wide. “Goody!” He clapped his hands.  
  
  Mrs. Yarby helped him unwrap his surprise. It was a windup train that made a lot of noise. Every time it bumped into something it turned around and went the other way. Fudge liked it a lot. He likes anything that’s noisy.  
 I said, “That’s a nice train.”  
  
  Mrs. Yarby turned to me. “Oh, I have something for you too uh . . . uh. . . .”  
  
  “Peter,” I reminded her. “My name is Peter.”  
  
  “Yes. Well, I’ll go get it.”  
  
  Mrs. Yarby left the room again. This time she came back with a flat package. It was wrapped up too—red ribbon and all. She handed it to me. Fudge stopped playing with his train long enough to come over and see what I got. I took off the paper very carefully in case my mother wanted to save it. And also to show Mrs. Yarby that I’m a lot more careful about things than my brother. I’m not sure she noticed. My present turned out to be a big picture dictionary. The kind I liked when I was about four years old. My old one is in Fudge’s bookcase now.  
  
  “I don’t know much about big boys,” Mrs. Yarby said. “So the lady in the store said a nice book would be a good idea.”  
  
  A nice book would have been a good idea, I thought. But a picture dictionary! That’s for babies! I’ve had my own regular dictionary since I was eight. But I knew I had to be polite so I said, “Thank you very much. It’s just what I’ve always wanted.”  
  
  “I’m so glad!” Mrs. Yarby said. She let out a long sigh and sat back on the sofa.  
  
  My father offered the Yarbys a drink.  
  
  “Good idea . . . good idea,” Mr. Yarby said.  
  
  “What’ll it be?” my father asked.  
  
  “What’ll it be?” Mr. Yarby repeated, laughing. “What do you think, Hatcher? It’ll be Juicy-O! That’s all we ever drink. Good for your health!” Mr. Yarby pounded his chest.  
  
  “Of course!” my father said, like he knew it all along. “Juicy-O for everyone!” my father told my mother. She went into the kitchen to get it.  
  
  While my father and Mr. Yarby were discussing Juicy-O, Fudge disappeared. Just as my mother served everyone a glass of Mr. Yarby’s favorite drink he came back. He was carrying a book—my old, worn-out picture dictionary. The same as the one the Yarbys just gave me.  
  
  “See,” Fudge said, climbing up on Mrs. Yarby’s lap. “See book.”  
  
  I wanted to vanish. I think my mother and father did too.  
  
  “See book!” Now Fudge held it up over his head.  
  
  “I can use another one,” I explained. “I really can. That old one is falling apart.” I tried to laugh.  
  
  “It’s returnable,” Mrs. Yarby said. “It’s silly to keep it if you already have one.” She sounded insulted. Like it was my fault she brought me something I already had.  
  
  “MINE!” Fudge said. He closed the book and held it tight against his chest. “MINE . . . MINE . . . MINE. . . .”  
  
  “It’s the thought that counts,” my mother said. “It was so nice of you to think of our boys.” Then she turned to Fudge. “Put the book away now, Fudgie.”  
  
  “Isn’t it Fudgie’s bedtime?” my father hinted.  
  
  “Oh yes. I think it is,” my mother said, scooping him up. “Say goodnight, Fudgie.”  
  
  “Goodnight Fudgie!” my brother said, waving at us.  
  
  Fudge was supposed to fall asleep before we sat down to dinner. But just in case, my mother put a million little toys in his crib to keep him busy. I don’t know who my mother thought she was fooling. Because we all know that Fudge can climb out of his crib any old time he wants to.

  He stayed away until we were in the middle of our roast beef. Then he came in carrying Dribble’s bowl. He walked right up to Mrs. Yarby. He thought she was his new friend. “See,” he said, holding Dribble under her nose. “See Dribble.”  
  
  Mrs. Yarby shrieked. “Ohhhh! I can’t stand reptiles. Get that thing away from me!”  
  
  Fudge looked disappointed. So he showed Dribble to Mr. Yarby. “See,” he said.  
  
  “HATCHER!” Mr. Yarby boomed. “Make him get that thing out of here!”  
  
  I wondered why Mr. Yarby called my father “Hatcher.” Didn’t he know his first name was Warren? And I didn’t like the way Mr. and Mrs. Yarby both called Dribble a “thing.”  
  
  I jumped up. “Give him to me!” I told Fudge. I took Dribble and his bowl and marched into my room. I inspected my turtle all over. He seemed all right. I didn’t want to make a big scene in front of our company but I was mad! I mean really mad! That kid knows he’s not allowed to touch my turtle!  
  
  “Peter,” my father called, “come and finish your dinner.”  
  
  When I got back to the table I heard Mrs. Yarby say, “It must be interesting to have children. We never had any ourselves.”  
  
  “But if we did,” Mr. Yarby told my father, “we’d teach them some manners. I’m a firm believer in old-fashioned good manners!”  
  
  “So are we, Howard,” my father said in a weak voice.  
  
  I thought Mr. Yarby had a lot of nerve to hint that we had no manners. Didn’t I pretend to like their dumb old picture dictionary? If that isn’t good manners, then I don’t know what is!  
  
  My mother excused herself and carried Fudge back to my room. I guess she put him into his crib again. I hoped she told him to keep his hands off my things.  
  
  We didn’t hear from him again until dessert. Just as my mother was pouring the coffee he ran in wearing my rubber gorilla mask from last Hallowe’en. It’s a very real-looking mask. I guess that’s why Mrs. Yarby screamed so loud. If she hadn’t made so much noise my mother probably wouldn’t have spilled the coffee all over the floor.  
  
  My father grabbed Fudge and pulled the gorilla mask off him. “That’s not funny, Fudge!” he said.  
  
  “Funny,” Fudge laughed. “Funny, funny, funny Fudgie!”  
  
  “Yes sir, Hatcher!” Mr. Yarby said. “Old-fashioned manners!”  
  
  By that time I’m sure my father was sorry the Yarbys weren’t staying at a hotel.  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  I finally got to bed at ten. Fudge was in his crib slurping away. I thought I’d never fall asleep! But I guess I did. I woke up once, when Fudge started babbling. He said, “Boo-ba-mum-mum-ha-ba-shi.” Whatever that means. I didn’t even get scared. I whispered, “Shut up!” And he did.  
  
  Early the next morning I felt something funny on my arm. At first I didn’t wake up. I just felt this little tickle. I thought it was part of my dream. But then I had the feeling somebody was staring at me. So I opened my eyes.  
  
  Fudge was standing over me and Dribble was crawling around on my arm. I guess Fudge could tell I was about ready to kill him because he bent down and kissed me. That’s what he does when my mother’s angry at him. He thinks nobody can resist him when he makes himself so lovable. And a lot of times it works with my mother. But not with me! I jumped up, put Dribble back into his bowl, and smacked Fudge on his backside. Hard. He hollered.  
  
  My father came running into my room. He was still in his pajamas.  
  
  He whispered, “What’s going on in here?”  
  
  I pointed at Fudge and he pointed at me.  
  
  My father picked up my brother and carried him off. “Go back to sleep, Peter,” he said. “It’s only six o’clock in the morning.”  
  
  I fell asleep for another hour, then woke up to an awful noise. It was Fudge playing with his new train. It woke up everybody, including the Yarbys. But this time there was nobody they could blame. They were the ones who gave Fudge the train in the first place.  
  
  Breakfast was a very quiet affair. Nobody had much to say. Mr. Yarby drank two glasses of Juicy-O. Then he told my father that he and Mrs. Yarby had their suitcase packed. They were leaving for a hotel as soon as breakfast was over.  
  
  My father said he understood. That the apartment was too small for so many people. My mother didn’t say anything.  
  
  When Mr. Yarby went into Fudge’s bedroom to pick up his suitcase his voice boomed. “HATCHER!”  
  
  My father ran toward the bedroom. My mother and Mrs. Yarby followed him. I followed them. When we got there we saw Fudge s  
itting on the Yarbys’ suitcase. He had decorated it with about one hundred green stamps. The kind my mother gets at the supermarket.  
  
  “See,” Fudge said. “See . . . pretty.” He laughed. Nobody else did. Then he licked the last green stamp and stuck it right in the middle of the suitcase. “All gone!” Fudge sang, holding up his hands.  
  
  It took my mother half an hour to peel off her trading stamps and clean up the Yarbys’ suitcase.  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  The next week my father came home from the office and collected all the cans of Juicy-O in our house. He dumped them into the garbage. My mother felt bad that my father had lost such an important account. But my father told her not to worry. Juicy-O wasn’t selling very well at the stores. Nobody seemed to like the combination of oranges, grapefruits, pineapples, pears, and bananas.  
  
  “You know, Dad,” I said. “I only drank Juicy-O to be polite. I really hated it!”  
  
  “You know something funny, Peter?” my father said. “I thought it was pretty bad myself!”  
  
  3  
  
  The Family Dog  
  
  Nobody ever came right out and said that Fudge was the reason my father lost the Juicy-O account. But I thought about it. My father said he was glad to be rid of Mr. Yarby. Now he could spend more time on his other clients—like the Toddle-Bike company. My father is in charge of their new TV commercial.  
  
  I thought maybe he could use me in it since I know how to stand on my head. But he said he wasn’t planning on having any head-standers in the commercial.  
  
  My grandma taught me to stand on my head when I spent the night at her house. I can stay up for as long as three minutes. I showed my mother, my father, and Fudge how I can do it right in the living room. They were all impressed. Especially Fudge. He wanted to do it too. So I turned him upside down and tried to teach him. But he always tumbled over backwards.  
  
  Right after I learned to stand on my head Fudge stopped eating. He did it suddenly. One day he ate fine and the next day nothing. “No eat!” he told my mother.  
  
  She didn’t pay too much attention to him until the third day. When he still refused to eat she got upset. “You’ve got to eat, Fudgie,” she said. “You want to grow up to be big and strong, don’t you?”  
  
  “No grow!” Fudge said.  
  
  That night my mother told my father how worried she was about Fudge. So my father did tricks for him while my mother stood over his chair trying to get some food into his mouth. But nothing worked. Not even juggling oranges.  
  
  Finally my mother got the brilliant idea of me standing on my head while she fed Fudge. I wasn’t very excited about standing on my head in the kitchen. The floor is awfully hard in there. But my mother begged me. She said, “It’s very important for Fudge to eat. Please help us, Peter.”  
  
  So I stood on my head. When Fudge saw me upside down he clapped his hands and laughed. When he laughs he opens his mouth. That’s when my mother stuffed some baked potato into it.  
  
  But the next morning I put my foot down. “No! I don’t want to stand on my head in the kitchen. Or anywhere else!” I added, “And if I don’t hurry I’ll be late for school.”  
  
  “Don’t you care if your brother starves?”  
  
  “No!” I told her.  
  
  “Peter! What an awful thing to say.”  
  
  “Oh . . . he’ll eat when he gets hungry. Why don’t you just leave him alone!”  
  
  That afternoon when I came home from school I found my brother on the kitchen floor playing with boxes of cereals and raisins and dried apricots. My mother was begging him to eat.  
  
  “No, no, no!” Fudge shouted. He made a terrible mess, dumping everything on the floor.  
  
  “Please stand on your head, Peter,” my mother said. “It’s the only way he’ll eat.”  
  
  “No!” I told her. “I’m not going to stand on my head anymore.” I went into my room and slammed the door. I played with Dribble until suppertime. Nobody ever worries about me the way they worry about Fudge. If I decided not to eat they’d probably never even notice!  
  
  That night during dinner Fudge hid under the kitchen table. He said, “I’m a doggie. Woof . . . woof . . . woof!”  
  
  It was hard to eat with him under the table pulling on my legs. I waited for my father to say something. But he didn’t.  
  
  Finally my mother jumped up. “I know,” she said. “If Fudgie’s a doggie he wants to eat on the floor! Right?”  
  
  If you ask me Fudge never even thought about that. But he liked the idea a lot. He barked and nodded his head. So my mother fixed his plate and put it under the table. Then she reached down and petted him, like he was a real dog.  
  
  My father said, “Aren’t we carrying this a little too far?”  
  
  My mother didn’t answer.  
  
  Fudge ate two bites of his dinner.  
  
  My mother was satisfied.  
  
  After a week of having him eat under the table I felt like we really did have a family dog. I thought how great it would be if we could trade in Fudge for a nice cocker spaniel. That would solve all my problems. I’d walk him and feed him and play with him. He could even sleep on the edge of my bed at night. But of course that was wishful thinking. My brother is here to stay. And there’s nothing much I can do about it.  
  
  Grandma came over with a million ideas about getting Fudge to eat. She tricked him by making milk shakes in the blender. When Fudge wasn’t looking she threw in an egg. Then she told him if he drank it all up there would be a surprise in the bottom of the glass. The first time he believed her. He finished his milk shake. But all he saw was an empty glass. There wasn’t any surprise! Fudge got so mad he threw the glass down. It smashed into little pieces. After that Grandma left.  
  
  The next day my mother dragged Fudge to Dr. Cone’s office. He told her to leave him alone. That Fudge would eat when he got hungry.  
  
  I reminded my mother that I’d told her the same thing—and for free! But I guess my mother didn’t believe either one of us because she took Fudge to see three more doctors. None of them could find a thing wrong with my brother. One doctor even suggested that my mother cook Fudge his favorite foods.  
  
  So that night my mother broiled lamb chops just for Fudge. The rest of us ate stew. She served him the two little lamb chops on his plate under the table. Just the smell of them was enough to make my stomach growl. I thought it was mean of my mother to make them for Fudge and not me.  
  
  Fudge looked at his lamb chops for a few minutes. Then he pushed his plate away. “No!” he said. “No chops!”  
  
  “Fudgie . . . you’ll starve!” my mother cried. “You must eat!”  
  
  “No chops! Corn Flakes,” Fudge said. “Want Corn Flakes!”  
  
  My mother ran to get the cereal for Fudge. “You can eat the chops if you want them, Peter,” she told me.  
  
  I reached down and helped myself to the lamb chops. My mother handed Fudge his bowl of cereal. But he didn’t eat it. He sat at my feet and looked up at me. He watched me eat his chops.  
  
  “Eat your cereal!” my father said.  
  
  “NO! NO EAT CEREAL!” Fudge yelled.  
  
  My father was really mad. His face turned bright red. He said, “Fudge, you will eat that cereal or you will wear it!”  
  
  This was turning out to be fun after all, I thought. And the lamb chops were really tasty. I dipped the bone in some Ketchup and chewed away.  
  
  Fudge messed around with his cereal for a minute. Then he looked at my father and said, “NO EAT . . . NO EAT . . . NO EAT!”  
  
  My father wiped his mouth with his napkin, pushed back his chair, and got up from the table. He picked up the bowl of cereal in one hand, and Fudge in the other. He carried them both into the bathroom. I went along, nibbling on a bone, to see what was going to happen.  
  
  My father stood Fudge in the tub and dumped the whole bowl of cereal right over his head. Fudge screamed. He sure can scream loud.  
  
   
My father motioned for me to go back to the kitchen. He joined us in a minute. We sat down and finished our dinner. Fudge kept on screaming. My mother wanted to go to him but my father told her to stay where she was. He’d had enough of Fudge’s monkey business at meal times.  
  
  I think my mother really was relieved that my father had taken over. For once my brother got what he deserved. And I was glad!  
  
  The next day Fudge sat at the table again. In his little red booster chair, where he belongs. He ate everything my mother put in front of him. “No more doggie,” he told us.  
  
  And for a long time after that his favorite expression was “eat it or wear it!”

  My Brother the Bird  
  
  We live near Central Park. On nice days I like to play there after school. I’m allowed to walk over by myself as long as I’m going to be with friends. My mother doesn’t want me hanging around the park alone.  
  
  For one thing, Jimmy Fargo has been mugged three times—twice for his bicycle and once for his money. Only he didn’t have any to give the muggers.  
  
  I’ve never been mugged. But sooner or later I probably will be. My father’s told me what to do. Give the muggers whatever they want and try not to get hit on the head.  
  
  Sometimes, after you’re mugged, you get to go to police headquarters. You look at a bunch of pictures of crooks to see if you can recognize the guys that mugged you.  
  
  I think it would be neat to look at all those pictures. It’s not that I want to get mugged, because that could be really scary. It’s just that Jimmy Fargo’s always talking about his visit to police headquarters.  
  
  My father got mugged once in a subway by two girls and a guy. They took his wallet and his briefcase. He still travels around by subways but my mother doesn’t. She sticks to buses and taxis.  
  
  Both my mother and my father are always warning me never to talk to strangers in the park. Because a lot of dope-pushers hang around there. But taking dope is even dumber than smoking, so nobody’s going to hook me!

The glass towers shimmered in the morning sun, and the hum of ambitious entrepreneurs—some deep in majlis-style meetings, others practicing a brisk, Western handshake—reminded me why I chose to build a business in Bahrain and not Dubai or Riyadh. The fees, the rules, and even the queue lengths change depending on whether you're in Seef District or the Diplomatic Area. And if you’re not careful, the smallest documentation error can cost you both time and money.\
If you’re exploring Bahrain company formation, especially as a foreign investor eyeing 100% ownership, understanding the annual fees and processes involved in maintaining your Commercial Registration is not just important—it’s vital for financial planning and compliance.\

Bahrain’s Business Environment in 2025: Optimistic, Efficient, and Globally Competitive\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting, showcasing Bahrain's vibrant corporate districts., real GDP is projected to grow by 3.2%, building on a strong 2024 rebound post-pandemic. Major investment zones like Bahrain Bay and Seef District have seen double-digit increases in new business registrations, supported by government partners like Tamkeen and the Economic Development Board (EDB).\
\
“Bahrain’s regulatory reforms, new digital government portal, and competitive cost structure have attracted over $1.3 billion in FDI in Q1 2025 alone.”\
— Forbes Business, March 2025\
\
Regulatory changes continue to shape company formation. This year, Sijilat, Bahrain’s digital business portal, reduced average processing times for CR renewals by 25%. The MOICT introduced a new, tiered fee model for renewals from February 2025, affecting legal structures and certain business sectors. I remember my first time using the Sijilat kiosk during Ramadan—aromatic Arabic coffee in hand, I learned that early morning appointments at the Seef branch had almost zero queue (a game-changer versus the midday rush in the Diplomatic Area).\

Understanding the Annual Commercial Registration (CR) Renewal Fees\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs, with business professionals calculating annual renewal budgets.:\
  - BHD 50 for standard CRs (main business activities)\
  - BHD 100 - BHD 300 for “regulated” activities (financial services, legal, healthcare)\
- Bahrain Chamber of Commerce Fee:\
  - BHD 20 - BHD 200 (sliding scale based on capital/sector)\
- Municipality Municipality Fee:\
  - BHD 10 - BHD 120 (depends on size, location, and type of business premises)\
- Additional Professional Licenses:\
  - BHD 50 - BHD 1,000+ per license for specialized activities\
- Amendment/Additional Fees:\
  - Any changes to partner list, activity, or registered address may incur a BHD 5 - BHD 50** charge each\
Typical annual renewal cost range: BHD 100 – BHD 700+**\
(If your business is in Bahrain Bay’s high-end offices or holds several regulated activities, plan on the upper end.)\
For a full breakdown by company type and activity, bookmark this up-to-date Bahrain company formation cost resource.\
Insider Tip:\
Renew 2–4 weeks before your CR’s expiration date. The Sijilat portal sometimes slows down during national holidays, and late renewals attract fines from BHD 100 - BHD 500. (I once missed a deadline by just one day during Eid, and the penalty was immediate and automatic. Never again.)\
\
Choosing the Right Business Structure: Costs and Renewal Fees\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration, reflecting team discussions on entity type and renewal costs.\
- SPC (Single Person Company)\
- BSC / Closed BSC\
- Branch of Foreign Company\
- Sole Proprietorship\
- Partnership**\
See the official breakdown of Bahrain business type structures for pros, cons, and fee impacts.\
Surprisingly, WLLs and SPCs have similar renewal fees, but additional professional or sectoral licenses may apply. If your business operates in the financial sector or provides legal/accounting services, add BHD 100–BHD 500 per regulated license.\
A common mistake: Overlooking sector-specific license renewal costs. I’ve seen entrepreneurs budget for the basic BHD 50 MOICT fee, only to be blindsided by a BHD 300 license renewal for regulated activities.\
Best Approach:\
Map out your activities and check with MOICT or a specialized service provider. I recommend KeyLink—they’ve saved me thousands by flagging hidden licensing charges before renewal season.\

\

Explore free zone benefits and costs\
\
For activities still requiring a local sponsor (some retail, food service, or regulated sectors), budget for a sponsorship fee—often BHD 500 – BHD 2,000 annually, negotiated directly with your Bahraini partner. I once negotiated a discounted rate by agreeing to sublease office space in the sponsor’s Seef office—creative deals are not only possible, they’re encouraged.\

Step-By-Step: How To Renew Your Bahrain Commercial Registration (CR) Efficiently\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation, paperwork and digital forms for CR renewal.\
- Chamber of Commerce certificate\
- Municipality lease/land certificate\
- Updated shareholder/partner passport copies\
- Original CR and trade licenses\
Use the Sijilat portal for digital uploads.\
Pro tip: Have a digital scan folder labeled by year—saves hours every cycle.\
2. Submit and Pay via Sijilat or MOICT Office\
\
Renewal can be done via Sijilat 24/7 or at MOICT counters (Seef branch usually has shortest waits before 10AM).\
Payment by debit card, BenefitPay, or cash (at counter only).\
\
Time-saving tip:\
Schedule your visit just after the morning majlis—local staff will be more relaxed, and you’ll sometimes get paperwork processed faster over coffee (seriously).\
3. Collect Stamped CR and Updated Licenses\
\
Collection times: Same day on Sijilat, 1–2 business days in person.\
Double-check accuracy—incorrect business activities or partner lists can risk penalties.\
\
The most common pitfall? Forgetting to renew subsidiary or activity-specific licenses. Set digital reminders 30 days out.\
4. Update Corporate Records, Bank & LMRA\
Once new CR and licenses are issued, immediately send scanned copies to your bank relationship manager, LMRA (for visa renewals), and Tamkeen (if you’re in a support programme).\
\
Compliance, Bookkeeping, and Post-Renewal Requirements\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation, with professionals handling official paperwork and audit files.\
- Tax compliance: No corporate tax for most sectors, but VAT filing required for turnover above BHD 37,500/year\
- Compliance review: Keep all documents for at least 5 years (random MOICT inspections do happen)\
Avoid the headache—outsourcing accounting/bookkeeping can save stress and fines. I once faced a potential penalty when my accountant missed a single entry in our VAT record; an emergency call to a specialist sorted it, but lesson learned: always hire professionals with Bahrain-specific experience.\

Tangent: Why Bahraini Coffee Rituals Are The Secret To Fast Approvals\
Once, I thought the elaborate coffee service in the waiting room at the Diplomatic Area’s MOICT was just for show. But after being waved ahead in the queue by a smiling official, I realized majlis-style networking—even over simple gahwa—can open doors that official emails cannot.\
The lesson? Don’t just prepare your documents—learn the local rhythms. Business is personal here, and small gestures return big dividends. It’s one more reason Bahrain outpaces its neighbors on ease of doing business rankings.\
\
Common Mistakes & How To Avoid Them\
\
\
Mistake: Ignoring sector-specific renewal or municipality license costs\
Prevention: Check the latest full fee list here and consult a local expert.\
\
\
Mistake: Submitting incomplete documents or outdated passport copies\
Prevention: Keep a digital checklist with all mandatory documents, and update it every quarter.\
\
\
Mistake: Renewing too late or during peak holiday weeks\
Prevention: Set up email/calandar reminders 45 days before your CR’s anniversary and renew early.\
\
\
Mistake: Not updating bank or LMRA records after renewal\
Prevention: Email updated documents within 72 hours of renewal to all stakeholders.\
\
\
\
Top Service Providers And Cost-Saving Tools\
Having tested many, KeyLink remains my top pick for their transparency and insider knowledge (ask for Ahmed at their Seef office). For digital records, use Microsoft OneDrive or Google Drive—cloud folders with date-based subfolders streamline every renewal season.\

This summer, I interned at a large Bank. I am 21 and was stoked to finally be going out with adult professionals and shooting the shit with the younger guys closer to my age. We went out a lot as a team, drank into the evening, and overall had a good time.

In my team, we had this one girl (or lady, rather) who is 29 and single. On my first week, we had welcome drinks and I remember I ended up one on one with her and she got pretty physically close in her chair, leaning into me while I was standing and mentioned me being a ""White man who would have fun"" after I expressed interest in going abroad to places such as Southeast Asia.

This dynamic continued into my internship. She would be pretty professional in the office but when we had happy hours in the huge lounge area, often followed me around and extended conversations with me. Obviously never about work, but I never pushed any lines. I remember one time I said I wouldn't mind being 6'5 and she responded with ""I don't want 6'5 guys because then I can't kiss them"" or something like that. Another time she randomly commented how there were so many hot guys in the area and she was on the hunt. Yet another incident I can think of is when 6 of us grabbed an Uber to some higher-end bar like 10 blocks down, stayed for hours, and she left literally right after I did, and was happy to walk with me to the train station. You guys get the gist.

Either way, fast forward to the second to last week of my internship and we have a large teambuilding rooftop event. It starts off well and I network with the team seniors any many others. Eventually the younger folks (including me an her) are in one group while the senior folks are in their circles. We're all a bit tipsy and I notice she starts to get touchy. Like when she laughed or made a comment out loud, she would press her shoulders against me or just stumble into me and stay there for a few seconds. At one point, she tried hand feeding me some small snack but gave it to another guy after I passed.

All of us keep talking and then I asked everyone if they wanted to get beers from the bar area. No one wanted to join except for her, who said she's walk with me for company. As we're about to enter the bar area from the outdoor space, she grabs my arm, wraps it around hers, and pulls me in for a few seconds so we walk side by side. Eventually she lets go and jokes that some random guys (it was a packed venue, and other firms had also booked it) had tried talking to her earlier so she was borrowing me for them to stop. She then grabbed my beer after the bartender brought it, and brushed her whole buttocks against my arm when leaning in to grab it.

No incidents from there, until it started raining and the 50+ people outside including our team migrated back indoors. By then, she was definitely a bit drunk and was getting very touchy with some males from our team. She was speaking to this random director and placed her hands on his shoulders, for example. While they spoke (literally inches from me, as it was packed), I randomly felt her hands making contact with my back.

A few minutes later, she came over to me and a younger colleague I was speaking to and leaned against the bar counter, arm outstretched facing me with this intense look on her face. We collectively talked for a bit, until she adjusts her arm higher and accidentally (or so I think) gets my whole crotch.

I'm ashamed to admit it, but I was slightly aroused by her constant proximity in my drunken state, and was slightly hard. I am sure she felt it, and this explains the conclusion of my story. In the moment, she showed no reaction, and we all left maybe 10 mins later. I personally felt pretty uncomfortable and definitely did not want or feel good about that contact. But I forgot about it and chalked it up to drunk fun.

The weekend passed and it was my last week. When I came into office on Monday, I passed by her when going for coffee, smiled, only for her to briskly walk away. This pattern continued. She would never acknowledge or even look my way practically the entire week. In office I saw her sometimes whispering to other younger coworkers, and straight up saw one of them look at me during their conversation. She's a very gossipy type, so I am more than positive she told female colleagues (AKA her ""girls"") about it. During my ""Farewell drinks"", which she chose to attend, she walked far away from me on our way to the bar, stayed in a smaller circle away from me the whole time there, and left when that smaller circle did as well (even though she never leaves early). Literally not a word besides a quick ""bye"". I immediately knew what it was about, and decided to just leave her completely alone, and not make any contact until the last day. We even planned one on one drinks for my last week during that event, which I obviously didn't bother with. I almost felt horrible at first, blaming it on myself.

Friday was my last day and the same thing happened. There were few people on our team present, so 4 of us including me and her went out for a final lunch. On our way there, she walks with the first colleague, on the way back with the other. Never near me and always keeping a big gap. I of course, did the same and only spoke to the group as a whole. Before leaving the office, she did stop by to say a quick ""bye, wish you the best"" before leaving, to which I nodded.

I ended up not getting a return offer to that team, so it's not like I will ever see her (or care to see her again). I simply wanted to share this experience, as I initially felt like an awful person, but at the same time feel like it was her making the physical advances and a victim in a way. If the roles & ages were flipped, it could have been very bad.

I just wanted to vent here, as I can't stop thinking about the whole experience despite being done with the place. Is this on me? Maybe I should have apologized or brought it up? Or is this on her? I don't know what to think and it sucks that it ended that way.",2,1755060421.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

I'm sorry if this post is a bit of a mess, I'm trying my best.

My journey began with PRK. I had it about 18 months ago, after wearing glasses for 26 years (ages 8-34). I never had any issues with dryness in my eyes before the procedure, except for once, when they kinda felt not lubricated enough, this was maybe a month before the procedure, and a drop of Systane helped.
I had the procedure, and then of course started experiencing dry eyes pretty frequently, used a lot of Systane for a long time after the procedure, but this was expected, I was told I should expect to experience dryness for a year following PRK.

However... It kinda got worse. I started feeling like Systane wasn't working anymore, asked the pharmacist to give me anything else to see if it would work better, and this is when I started using Bepanthen eye drops which where significantly better for me. I needed less drops, and felt more relieved after using it.
Right before switching to Bepanthen, I gained a new recurring experience - waking up in the middle of the night, eyes closed at first, but feeling like I have to open them because they are too dry to move freely against my eyelids, I open them, and most of the time they are just really dry, I blink a bunch, drink like 200-400ml of water, sometimes add some Bepanthen, and it's resolved. Some other times, one of my eyes starts to really hurt (it alternates, never both thankfully), as if the surface of my eyeball broke/was torn. No change in vision. I felt immediately the first time it happened to me that this was a dryness issue and I treated it like I treat my dry eyes normally, and it does work, even when it takes like a full hour of me lying awake putting a drop in once every few minutes.
But it keeps happening, doesn't seem to get any better, just sometimes happens more frequently and some other times it rarely happens.
I was hoping to hear from people who maybe know the experience I'm having, and could maybe point me in a direction. It doesn't seem like this is a common experience in this subreddit? I read a lot of posts and couldn't find anyone talking about this.

I'm not really sure which doctor could be of help, I moved to Ireland during this time and doctor visits are pretty expensive so I wouldn't want to just go to any doctor and don't actually get the help I need.
Some details about me that might be relevant:
- I'm a 35 yr old woman, healthy, a little overweight, most of it is muscle mass
- I don't smoke, I don't drink coffee, I drink socially, and I don't do any other type of drug
- I take Wellbutrin/Zyban daily for ADD/depression, it's really helpful
- I'm a software engineer, spend a lot of time in front of screens during work, and in my free time I like to play video games. I'm also on my phone all the time, so maximum screen time. I can't see how I could reduce my time in front of screens
- I think I drink enough water during the day, I would say maybe 1.8 litres on a ""dry"" day
- I work out 2-3 times a week, and have been for a while
- I wake up most nights, sometimes multiple times, not always dry-eye related
- According to my hygrometer it's normally 65-80% humidity in my bedroom. I suspect it's much lower in the office, I don't have a hygrometer there

What do you guys say? Does anyone have any ideas or thoughts or kind words to share? Tips for navigating confusing health system in Ireland?

Thank you for reading the whole way through. I wrote this in the middle of the night lying in bed with a sore left eye holding on to hope there is better treatment. <3",1,1755060091.0,Dryeyes,2,1.0,False

Lately, I have been feeling that I’m getting less decoction for the amount of ground coffee I’m putting, I have a weighing scale as well so I’m able to measure the input and the output. 

I put about 31g ground coffee which usually fills the basket to a good amount, I fill the water to just below the valve and the resulting decoction I get is about 130-140g. On some good brew days, I end up getting 170g as well but I’m not sure what’s causing this variation. 

I end up getting only 130-140 because the coffee starts to sputter and I switch off the gas about 2 seconds before it starts to sputter. 

Is this a normal amount (130-140g)? Where could I be going wrong if not?

TW: abandoned dogs","Hello, this is mostly a vent post. I also welcome input on AITA. My husband (29M) and I (28NB) have had a super rough week. Last Tuesday he found a stray family of dogs on the side of the road and couldn’t bear to leave them. I woke up to a call that he’s collected them and is on his way back home. I was groggy but before I could get any input or questions in, he hung up. He dropped them off on our property, said he had to go to work… and then left. Calling off at his short-staffed job wasn’t an option, in his defense. One nursing female, one adult male and two puppies.

I have a dog already, and three days prior completed paperwork to bring home a rescue puppy in a couple weeks. So before I had coffee the logistics of everything made my brain go haywire. I am fairly experienced caring for dogs having worked at a vet hospital in the past. I also work full-time, WFH. So, I managed but it was stressful. I gave the dogs a look-over and I noted that they have ringworm and intestinal worms. Wonderful. That’s another thing, I am super anxious about contagious diseases & parasites. My dog is fully vaccinated but I was squicked out.

Once we were both off work, we patched together a shaded, outdoor enclosure and he paid for some basic supplies. He did help with the daily chores some but since I am home all day, I bore the brunt of the workload. Puppies poop a ton and you gotta stay on top of it.

I contacted animal control who informed me that they were at max capacity and so were all the shelters nearby. That’s when I started to tweak. I’ll admit that I was being bitchy. Crying that I can’t handle caring for 5 soon 6 dogs, being militant about biohazard and waste management. He had promised to do the outreaching but by day five I had to nag him into putting in effort. I did not yell or insult but I was vastly more unpleasant to be around. Eventually, thankfully, he found a rescue group with space that just opened up. It was like an anvil was lifted off of my chest and I could breathe.

Now that I’ve relaxed, I feel guilty for the degree of neuroticism I had. His heart was in the right place, these dog’s lives were saved and I worry that I’ve created a negative association with doing good deeds. He did this out of love and did not intend to cause me that amount of stress. Today I sat him down and whole-heartedly apologized, also telling him that I was proud of him for saving their lives ^(please don’t pick up strays). He just kinda shrugged and went back to hardly talking to me. So, yeah. If you’ve made it this far, thank you for reading.",0,1755059938.0,Vent,1,0.5,False

Our 1 year old chronic early riser since the dawn of time eventually started waking at 6am. This was a huge deal for us because it used to be anywhere between 0430 and 0530. But, she started nursery 7 weeks ago, sleep is now a shocker, and she's getting up 5am, sometimes before. 

She has had a bad cough for several weeks thanks to nursery. We have ruled out an infection at the gp. But around 4am, she starts coughing, then she fully starts coughing at 5am and then she's awake and crying. We don't know now if this has developed into a habit cough or because sleep is lighter at that time, and the cough is still working it's way through that it'll cause the early wakes. 

Either way, it's been going on for 7 weeks. It's probably rewired her to wake at this time now, because I could set my watch to the coughs. I know it's 5am without checking the time because she's coughing and it's killing us. Naps have also started to become problematic. She's definitely starting to transition to 1 nap, she fights the second like crazy and often doesn't have that. She only has 1 nap at nursery. It can be between 90 mins and 2 hours. At home it's 45 mins... And no second nap because she fights it. It's been really hard, but the 5am coughing fit wake ups have been harder. 

I guess my questions are;
1. Is this just nursery bugs working it's way through. And unfortunately because we go into light sleep at 4am/5am, she's more prone to being woken up by discomfort and needing to cough? And sadly this is something we just need to push through? 
2. Is this now a habit cough and she's just doing it to be a pain in the ass every. Single. Morning. 
3. Is there hope this will pass 🫠

Hello everyone 👋 I have been learning so much from everyone in this group, and it's been helpful and comforting knowing i am not alone. I hope everyone finds answers and relief. I am appalled at the number of women (and men) dealing with these symptoms and how often doctors are of NO help. I am a biologist. I collect data and do research for a living, and all of my doctors treat me like I am an idiot because I am not a doctor. They talk down to patients and are condensending and rude and just discredit the things we say or ask. God forbid you mention something you read online because they roll their eyes like you can't possible read peer-reviewed scientific studies and literature online or referenced in groups like this.

I am looking for any help or advice from others with similar situations/symptoms to see what worked for others. This is very long, so apologize in advance.

Background and Context: I am a 37yo female. I do not have any children if that matters. I have dealt with frequent utis over my life. I started getting them in late high school after i became sexually active. My mother told me she had also suffered from frequent utis, so I thought maybe I had a genetic or anatomical propensity for them (I do have a tilted uterus per a doctor i had when i was about 17). I recall relying more on antibiotics during this time to resolve symptoms. I have had maybe 1+ uti a year during this time(from what I can remember, but some years without any). An important fact is that often when I would go to a doctor, my urinalysis and culture would come back clean. My mom said this was always the case for her too, so i didn't think much of it.

My UTI Symptoms: My symptoms have always been the same; urinary frequency, not feeling like I am voiding completely, a pinching or fullness in my bladder or urethra (hard to tell where the feeling originates) and sometimes my lady bits just didnt feel completely normal, like sort of hot or irritated (no itching though). I never had bladder pain or burning during urination,and never blood in my urine.

D-Mannose Success: In 2017 someone told me about d-mannose. That was a game changer for me. I try to take 1000mg daily (2 capsules of the Solaray cranActin and d-mannose). Anytime I felt the smallest twinge of pinching in my bladder I would start taking more of it (2000-3000mg) and drinking lots of water and the symptoms would usually go away. Since then, I have only had to take antibiotics a handful of times if the symptoms did not resolve or got worse. The doctors used to discredit it as homeopathic bs, but now many actually recommend it.

Since 2020, when i got together with my now husband, I have only had two utis for which I needed antibiotics. In June 2023, I went through Wisp and took two courses of macrobid (one course did not fully kick it), and this past June, which is when all my real troubles started.

My Current Plight: Memorial Day weekend I went swimming in a local river. A week later i started getting uti symptoms. Note: I looked on the county health website and there was a health advisory posted a week after for e coli and enterococcus. I can't say for sure this would have caused my symptoms, but...

I went through telehealth Wisp to get antibiotics since i dont have a great doctor on hand to go to and most times i have gone to the doctor for a uti in the past, my culture came back negative. I have grown weary of doctors telling me I couldn't possibly have a uti even with symptoms and when I had read so much about agar cultures not catching all infections and about biofilms/embedded infections. It felt like they were not taking me seriously or believing that I knew my body.

Wisp prescribed me a 5-day course of macrobid. I had instant relief after the first day and my symptoms went away. I abstained from sex during this time. Unfortunately, after getting better I did have sex with my husband and a week later my symptoms returned- not sure if they would have anyways. Wisp would not let me order another course of macrobid (due to worry about resistance) so i (maybe stupidly?) Went through a different company to get another course of macrobid because i feel comfortable with that antibiotic and I have needed 2 courses before to kick an infection.

The antibiotics did not seem to help the second course, so I ended up going to urgent care. They tested my urine and did a culture and also tested me for sti's and bv. All came back negative and I walked away with nothing. I tried doubling up on d-mannose and took a product I have taken before called UT-Vibrance and actually ended up giving myself colitis and in the ER (not 100% sure it was from that product but the dosage is insanely high for d-mannose more than 15000 mg a day when recommend dose is 2000 mg).

It's been a month since I went to urgent care and I still am experiencing symptoms. It's not full-blown uti bad, but distracting. Some weeks are better than others and some are way worse. Sometimes i just have an awareness of my bladder/urethra, other times i have extreme frequency too(i peed probably 50 times today).

I have been doing no coffee, no alcohol, no sex and trying to limit spicy and acidic foods and caffeine (chocolate and tea). I am still taking d-mannose (which i stopped when i had colitis and was afraid to take for a while) but only the recommended dose. I went to my gyno and she said it cannot possibly be a uti if no infection. She basically shamed me for using teleheath and taking antibiotics and acted like I was an idiot. She told me I have either overactive bladder or IC. I know I do not have oab. I have since made an appointment with a urologist, a pelvic floor therapist, and I just ordered the migrogendx test.

I cannot fathom that if I have only ever had these symptoms in the past in isolated instances of time and they resolved with antibiotics without return of symptoms for long periods of time (sometimes years), that this would be anything other than a uti. I have never had symptoms for this long before. I am hoping the pcr test catches something that the culture missed so I have a leg to stand on with my doctor. I am worried that the longer it goes untreated it will become harder to treat. My gyno flat out rolled her eyes and dismissed me when I mentioned embedded utis. Why do doctors not keep up with current research and testing??? For example, did you know Lyme disease can cause chronic utis? The bacteria that causes Lyme disease can even show up in urine cultures.

In the meantime I have read lots about different things like uribel, hippex, that antidepressant/ bladder pain reliever that starts with an 'a', marshmallow root tea, etc.

Does anyone have any good doctor recommendations for central California? Did anyone naturally get relief after a few months? What helped? I am worried the pelvic floor therapy might not help and just be expensive. I am also worried the microgen test might be a rabbit hole and hard to decipher. Lastly, i am worried the urologist will do a bunch of tests that just further irritate my symptoms. But mostly just worried this discomfort will never go away.",2,1755059763.0,Interstitialcystitis,2,1.0,False
1mouxzf,https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/1mouxzf/fridgefood_safety_after_outage/,Fridge/food safety after outage.,"I came home from work with a bag of groceries- milk, cheese, chicken, bacon… only to see that I left the fridge open that day. Yup it was OPEN and room temp.

I tossed all my dairy and put the new stuff away. I threw things away like my coffee creamer so I packed up my two kids and went back to the store. Repurchased our daily use items like yogurt, sour cream, my half and half… it’s 9:30 and my fridge is still only at 45 degrees after 3 hours of the door being closed.

I feel so angry and stupid. I spent 75 bucks today (single mom just doing my best) on needed groceries plus my stupid mistake and now I am wondering if I need to toss EVERYTHING. I just stuck a thermometer in the yogurt and it’s at 40*… milk is at 45. I don’t want to pierce the meat through the package. I did put ice packs on everything. 

I feel so stupid. I got these groceries as a part of me trying to “get my life back” after such an insane amount of stress this summer and school just starting. I’m the queen of microwaving everything, the fact that I even have raw chicken is an anomaly and I’m questioning everything.",0,1755059570.0,cookingforbeginners,0,0.5,False
1mouxdc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1mouxdc/can_someone_please_help_me_understand_im_lost/,Can someone please help me understand? I’m lost.,"Gonna be a long one but interesting. I (32M) was in a fairly serious relationship with this angel of a human (26F) for about 6 months. Everything was going great, I mean better than anything I’ve ever felt before. In past relationships, I never once got the feeling that I could see myself with this person for the foreseeable future possibly due to my commitment problems. But with this lady, it was like a switch was flipped inside of me. She made me feel invincible and I actually felt cared for. She’s a single mom still living with her parents which would have usually been a turn off for me in the past but none of that mattered because she had a heart of gold, it’s like I was blinded by something and let all my guards down. 

After a while she started bringing her daughter around me and we got along just fine. She even brought me to meet her parents and they seemingly loved me, especially when I would offer to help with things around the property (her parents have health problems). Anyway the last weekend she spent with me, we were laying in bed just looking into each other’s eyes and she said “I’m falling for you hard”. That flipped another switch in my brain and it made me feel so good inside, I can’t even explain it. She leaves Sunday night and everything was fine. 

Monday comes around and she wants me to come over but I had already made plans to spend time with my nephews at the lake which she was seemingly cool with. Then Tuesday my happy little fairytale starts to fall apart, all day she was argumentative with me, nothing I said was right and she was oddly cold. Which is very not like her at all or at least the her I thought I knew. Wednesday, she doesn’t answer my call and would only text. Which I was fine with because she said she wasn’t feeling good, but I swear, I seriously thought I was talking to a complete stranger, it was truly jarring. Nothing she was texting me sounded like her at all, I don’t know, it just felt so cold and distant, like we never had anything. The same goes for Thursday. 

So Friday, since she hadn’t been feeling good, I made a little get well basket (my friends gf helped with the idea) and was going to pick her up a coffee from her favorite place when she said “I can’t hang out today”. Well I’m pissed at this point and my gut feeling is screaming at me but I hold fast because I don’t give up easy plus she may have just been busy. Well later on that night she hit me with it. She had been doing some soul searching, serious thinking and figuring what’s best for her and her daughter and that it was for the best if we didn’t see each other anymore. Then the whole “I’m sorry, you’re a great guy, I really appreciate our time together” blah blah blah. 

Well it’s been over a month and I can’t shake that comment about not being what’s best for her and her daughter. I tried to look back at things I’d done and couldn’t think of a single thing that would make her say that. I don’t know why but it’s eating me alive and I literally can’t do anything without thinking about it. The gym and music keep the thoughts at bay for brief moments but it’s like with that comment she implanted a bomb in my brain and every time it explodes, my thoughts are flooded with memories, the what if’s and then I beat myself up. I literally have to make myself stop thinking about it. I feel like it’s making me doubt the man that I’ve become and that worries me because before her, I might not have been the happiest person but I was at least proud of myself. I worry that I am unlovable or defective like one of those dented cans at the grocery store or something. In my weak moments I’ll write out a message asking her what she meant by that comment and if she could help me better understand it but I just can’t bring myself to send it because at the end of the day I wasn’t good enough for her in her eyes and I need to learn to live with that. Any advice or words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated as I am in uncharted territory.

TLDR: was in a relationship that was going great then it ended abruptly and for seemingly no reason. Her last texts (me not being what’s best for her and her daughter) really hurt and I can’t shake it. Seeking advice or just anything really. Hit me with some cold hard truth before I bury this deep down until it blooms into an heart attack.",2,1755059517.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False

All I’d like is a picture of your OC, how they would comfort mine, and any lore or trauma they may have! 

Guys hopefully this isn’t too out of line I just realized that my OCs are TOOO sad and need some cheering up that I just can’t let happen in the story 😭

Lore drop: 

Caleb: 
Caleb is a 16 year old boy who has a rough family life. His father drinks, smokes, and owns a gun (which really scares Caleb) and his mother is very uncaring towards what is happening. He tries to spend as much time as possible outside of the house, with a part time job at a coffee shop, the school track team, and spending a lot of time at his friend Jason’s house. To deal with his family issues, he used his mother’s ADHD medication (Amphetamines), but really only Jason knows about this. His other close friends include Melanie, Amira, and Jason’s cousins: Yuna and Jayden. 
Caleb is very extroverted when he's with people he likes, and very playful and loves to tease. He is also very caring and the more grounded one in the group, who tries to keep everyone together while also keeping himself together. He is also very caring and supportive, and motivated outside of his home. At his house, he barely talks and spends his time on schoolwork. He’s pretty good at silent crying. 

Jason:
Jason is a 17 year old, French-African American teenager who has dedicated his entire life to a career he doesn’t yet have and doesn’t want. His father, a decently successful architectural engineer (and head of a firm) wants to pass this down to Jason, his only child, as well as going to a top university. Jason never found himself passionate about this, and instead loved biology and art. However, he has burnt out very easily and now cannot bring himself to explore his passions without thinking he is a failure to everyone around him. 

Despite his wide eyes and quivering lip, he isn’t all that shy, but rather introverted. He is a very caring person, who prioritizes perfection in himself but happiness in others. Although he can be pretty overbearing when worried (which he does a lot), with his friends he allows himself to relax. With them, he is the grounded one of the group, but still likes to have fun. He is one of those people who acts drunk when tired, so that is really when he tends to open up and get out of pocket, although this doesn’t happen often. He can go through major depressive episodes, and usually serves as the therapist friend of the group due to his wisdom (which he should be taking himself). 

Jayden:
Jayden is an 18 year old student who has gotten into Juilliard (hooray!). He is a very hardworking person (although it may not seem like it) and he really loves to play the violin and guitar. He is very fun and flirty with the people he is friends with/likes, but in reality is very self conscious about his body and personality. He tries to hide this by going all out: being very friendly, seemingly bold and confident, and very very flirty to put the attention on other people. Because of this, he gets a lot of attention, but mainly from his friend group. 

His friends include Kai (secret relationship/situationship/friends with benefits), Yuna (his cousin), Nisha, and Emiliano. He met Kai and Emiliano when he did football in 9th grade, and although he quit, they still ended up being great friends. Emiliano introduced his girlfriend, Nisha, to the group, and Jayden brought Yuna. They have been great friends since. Their usual hangout spot is an abandoned chemistry lab (which they thought was cleared out but some chemicals still remained). 

The toxins and chemicals in the lab end up changing their brains and making them act and feel differently (this is where some body horror/gore may come into play.) For Nisha, it affected her so much that she is basically like an angry, sentient zombie. She ends up attacking Emil one day, which leads everyone down a spiral. Kai kills Nisha from “self defense”, Emiliano is livid. Kai then manipulates Jayden to the point of shooting himself, leaving Yuna stranded and spiteful (the one who would never hurt a fly, mind you.) Emiliano gets revenge, butchering Kai at the roadside, and being sent to prison for it. Yuna is taken to a mental institution. This is the story of the ghosts that haunt the lab.

[no set budget, deciding]","My parents have a Delonghi automatic (don’t recall the model, but I think it was one of the fancier ones) and it makes passable americano (more like a coffee). Hard to dial in so they use Costco coffee beans (don’t at me, not my home, not my machine). I tried using my favorite Italian beans on it and couldn’t dial it in (the tiny dial is about 1/2 inch wide and a PITA to turn) - at the finest grind, it was so weak and tasteless I was shocked.

They came over to try coffee from my lever machine and were blown away at how sweeter and richer the cup was, and now want the same quality at home. They’re older so want to press a button and get the same nice rich espresso drinks (mainly traditional americanos and cappuccinos) instead of having a work flow (which I enjoy), so I’m trying to hold my nose and pick one for them. I think the Jura has good reviews, and although I find them really ugly, was wondering how folks find them compared to non-automatics? It looks like machines I’ve used in office lounges and the drinks have imho always been mediocre. Any other suggestions? What features should I be looking for? (Also. Any advice on how to get rid of the distaste for super automatics? I love the workflow of lever/manual, and find it almost sacrilegious to push a button for espresso - no offense for those who do like it, just my personal preference.

I hope everyone finds answers and relief. I am appalled at the number of women (and men) dealing with these symptoms and how often doctors are of NO help. I am a biologist. I collect data and do research for a living, and all of my doctors treat me like I am an idiot because I am not a doctor. They talk down to patients and are condensending and rude and just discredit the things we say or ask. God forbid you mention something you read online because they roll their eyes like you can't possible read peer-reviewed scientific studies and literature online or referenced in groups like this. 

I am looking for any help or advice from others with similar situations/symptoms to see what worked for others. This is very long, so apologize in advance.

Background and Context:
I am a 37yo female. I do not have any children if that matters. I have dealt with frequent utis over my life. I started getting them in late high school after i became sexually active. My mother told me she had also suffered from frequent utis, so I thought maybe I had a genetic or anatomical propensity for them (I do have a tilted uterus per a doctor i had when i was about 17). I recall relying more on antibiotics during this time to resolve symptoms. I have had maybe 1+ uti a year during this time(from what I can remember, but some years without any). An important fact is that often when I would go to a doctor, my urinalysis and culture would come back clean. My mom said this was always the case for her too, so i didn't think much of it. 

My UTI Symptoms:
My symptoms have always been the same; urinary frequency, not feeling like I am voiding completely, a pinching or fullness in my bladder or urethra (hard to tell where the feeling originates) and sometimes my lady bits just didnt feel completely normal, like sort of hot or irritated (no itching though). I never had bladder pain or burning during urination,and never blood in my urine. 

D-Mannose Success: 
In 2017 someone told me about d-mannose. That was a game changer for me. I try to take 1000mg daily (2 capsules of the Solaray cranActin and d-mannose). Anytime I felt the smallest twinge of pinching in my bladder I would start taking more of it (2000-3000mg) and drinking lots of water and the symptoms would usually go away. Since then, I have only had to take antibiotics a handful of times if the symptoms did not resolve or got worse. The doctors used to discredit it as homeopathic bs, but now many actually recommend it. 

Since 2020, when i got  together with my now husband, I have only had two utis for which I needed antibiotics. In June 2023, I went through Wisp and took two courses of macrobid (one course did not fully kick it), and this past June, which is when all my real troubles started.

My Current Plight:
Memorial Day weekend I went swimming in a local river. A week later i started getting uti symptoms. Note: I looked on the county health website and there was a health advisory posted a week after for e coli and enterococcus. I can't say for sure this would have caused my symptoms, but...

I went through telehealth Wisp to get antibiotics since i dont have a great doctor on hand to go to and most times i have gone to the doctor for a uti in the past, my culture came back negative. I have grown weary of doctors telling me I couldn't possibly have a uti even with symptoms and when I had read so much about agar cultures not catching all infections and about biofilms/embedded infections. It felt like they were not taking me seriously or believing that I knew my body.

Wisp prescribed me a 5-day course of macrobid. I had instant relief after the first day and my symptoms went away. I abstained from sex during this time. Unfortunately, after getting better I did have sex with my husband and a week later my symptoms returned- not sure if they would have anyways. Wisp would not let me order another course of macrobid (due to worry about resistance) so i (maybe stupidly?) Went through a different company to get another course of macrobid because i feel comfortable with that antibiotic and I have needed 2 courses before to kick an infection. 

The antibiotics did not seem to help the second course, so I ended up going to urgent care. They tested my urine and did a culture and also tested me for sti's and bv. All came back negative and I walked away with nothing. I tried doubling up on d-mannose and took a product I have taken before called UT-Vibrance and actually ended up giving myself colitis and in the ER (not 100% sure it was from that product but the dosage is insanely high for d-mannose more than 15000 mg a day when recommend dose is 2000 mg). 

It's been a month since I went to urgent care and I still am experiencing symptoms. It's not full-blown uti bad, but distracting. Some weeks are better than others and some are way worse. Sometimes i just have an awareness of my bladder/urethra, other times i have extreme frequency too(i peed probably 50 times today). 

I have been doing no coffee, no alcohol, no sex and trying to limit spicy and acidic foods and caffeine (chocolate and tea). I am still taking d-mannose (which i stopped when i had colitis and was afraid to take for a while) but only the recommended dose. I went to my gyno and she said it cannot possibly be a uti if no infection. She basically shamed me for using teleheath and taking antibiotics and acted like I was an idiot. She told me I have either overactive bladder or IC. I know I do not have oab. I have since made an appointment with a urologist, a pelvic floor therapist, and I just ordered the migrogendx test. 

I cannot fathom that if I have only ever had these symptoms in the past in isolated instances of time and they resolved with antibiotics without return of symptoms for long periods of time (sometimes years), that this would be anything other than a uti. I have never had symptoms for this long before. I am hoping the pcr test catches something that the culture missed so I have a leg to stand on with my doctor. I am worried that the longer it goes untreated it will become harder to treat. My gyno flat out rolled her eyes and dismissed me when I mentioned embedded utis. Why do doctors not keep up with current research and testing??? For example, did you know Lyme disease can cause chronic utis? The bacteria that causes Lyme disease can even show up in urine cultures.

In the meantime I have read lots about different things like uribel, hippex, that antidepressant/ bladder pain reliever that starts with an 'a', marshmallow root tea, etc. 

Does anyone have any good doctor recommendations for central California? Did anyone naturally get relief after a few months? What helped? I am worried the pelvic floor therapy might not help and just be expensive. I am also worried the microgen test might be a rabbit hole and hard to decipher. Lastly, i am worried the urologist will do a bunch of tests that just further irritate my symptoms. But mostly just worried this discomfort will never go away.

1mouss1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nanny/comments/1mouss1/trial_month_is_driving_me_crazy/,Trial MONTH is driving me crazy.,"Hi there! 

Feeling a bit frustrated with my current job. I’ve been professionally nannying for the last 9 years. Right now, I’m doing a trial with a family. The mom has said some questionable things to me. Now that she is getting comfortable, I’m starting to see a lot more of who she really is I guess. 

They are very wealthy people. Live in the richest town here. Their house is BEAUTIFUL! Their neighbors who also all own estates have multiple cars, horses, etc. You get it. Anywho, the job listing was looking for a nanny but also wanted someone to help with some other task. I don’t mind! I love being helpful. Did I think she meant when I cook for the kids, she’d also love if I made enough for her and husband? No but no big deal at first. Then it started to turn into something else. She wants me to vacuum their mansion 3x a week. Their house sits on like 3 acres. She also wants the counters wiped. The animals fed every morning. Pick up their groceries. Get their mail from the P.O. Box. Dust the corners of the ceilings when needed. Watch the kids when needed of course, a given. But also walk the dog. 

This is my daily task. I. Do. Not. Sit. She went on and on about how her last nanny would sit down while the babies slept and how unfair it was because then she had to do these things while the nanny rested…? She never told her nanny she wanted her to do all these things and to be honest, we are not maids, cooks, or dog walkers. It’s a trial month yet she insisted on having me go with them to Hawaii for 6 days. If you’re nanny, you know traveling with a family who you aren’t close to, is not fun. 

Anyways, today after I did ALL these task, she wanted me to pick up their packages. I said yes sure! She always mentioned before that there is a cute coffee shop next door because she knows I love matcha. Last time I didn’t go but this time I’m like oh perfect! I’m grab a matcha too! She looked at my very weird? I was like oh? Uhhh are you sure you’d like me to go now? Because her face looked uneasy?? Idk how to explain it. Then she’s like “yes now is fun but maybe not a matcha…especially if there is a line.” I was like oh okay. I went. There was no line but I felt so weird and maybe I shouldn’t have said I’d get a matcha. She told me about the place and was the one telling me to go. The way she said it was kind of like a “you’re not doing something you want on the time we are paying you”

Later in the day, it was time for them to come back. I had the babies for a while and I’m off at 3. At 2:50 she asked me if she could stay later and I said I usually can but today I had an important appointment. She was like “Ugh okay. I need to wait in line to pay then I’ll be home” she got home and told me to be sure to tell her when I have stuff like this so that she is vigilante with her time. Uhhh tell you so that I can be off at the time we agreed I am off…? 

I’m just feeling so sad everyday I’m going in. I try to be positive and connect but she also gets jealous of her oldest getting close to me. Every time I work for super wealthy people, I’m treated poorly. 

Am I crazy or what? Nannies give me you’d advice!!

Here's how I relieved it in less than 3 weeks, thanks to [Claisen](https://www.claisen.com/).

Some immediate stuff you can do to see improvements in 1-3 days:

* sleeping with your head elevated 6-7 inches, so not just extra pillows
* not eating 3+ hours before going to bed (this one is super important)
* cutting down obvious triggers (coffee, alcohol, spicy foods), but everyone's ""obvious"" triggers differ. Keep reading to find the best triggers for you.
* go for smaller, more frequent meals than less frequent, heavier meals.

Some other stuff you can do to see improvements in around a week:

* trying alkaline foods (bananas, oatmeals, melons)
* staying upright after eating for >2 hours
* loose clothing around waist
* PPIs (if your gerd is really bad), but I wouldn't recommend this as it sometimes doesn't even work half the time.

Now here's the thing. These treatments may work, but it may work better for some people than others. Similarly, it may work really well for one person if they do it in a certain way, while it might actually hurt someone if they do it in a way another person was doing it. 

This is where [Claisen](https://www.claisen.com/) came in to save my problems. Here's a simple solution I used that YOU can implement right now:

1. Go to Claisen's [personalized quiz](https://app.claisen.com/quiz/demo) 

2. Take it (only 5-10 minutes required)

3. Understand what it tells you. It will give you an explanation on your gut health problems regarding GERD

4. Purchase their affordable, doctor approved monthly kit that will arrive at your doorstep.

If you do these things, I can promise you, you will see improvements in your gut health in days, and in a couple weeks, you will see massive improvements. 

I hope this helps anyone reading!! ",1,1755058934.0,claisen,0,1.0,False
1mouq2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/hygiene/comments/1mouq2y/tooth_concerns/,Tooth Concerns,"I don't really use Reddit all too much but just looking for some guidance and maybe some reassurance regarding my teeth.

I'm 17, and I've consistently struggled with dental hygiene growing up. I was more consistent as a kid but around maybe 12-13 I had a harder time keeping up with my oral hygiene due to depression and lack of motivation. I think my last dentist appointment was somewhere between 8th grade to freshman year. I don't really remember much but I think I had a crown put on, it was porcelain on what I think is one of my molars. My situation in terms of seeing health professionals and stuff is kinda hard because I live with my mom but my dad is in charge of my health stuff and he's in a different state so I only get to go if I'm with my dad which makes appointments kinda hard to manage.

Over the last 9 months I was in a bad situationship, stressed out from school work and stuff, and I was very exhausted when I'd get home from school so up until April I would very rarely brush my teeth. I finally got out of the situationship and have been dating a really sweet guy and I feel more motivated to do better for myself and for him. 

I'm mostly just concerned and would like some guidance as to what I can do to improve until I can get someone to take me to the dentist. I definitely see signs of staining on my teeth from soda and coffee and stuff. I don't know how I got it but I wanna say back in April/May I got a chip in my upper front tooth? Like on the top part, it doesn't hurt and I didn't even feel it whenever it happened I just looked in the mirror one day and saw it. I also have a brown line on the same front tooth thats been there for a while, also doesn't hurt or anything. I can try to provide pictures.

I've been trying to brush regularly at least before I go to bed and in the morning sometimes. Occasionally I fall asleep before I brush my teeth though. I'm less good with flossing, I have those floss pick things and try to get the front teeth at least but I have a hard time reaching the back comfortably. I have a pretty bad addiction to energy drinks and I know those are bad for your teeth. In terms of diet, I've been trying to eat least eat a meal a day but sometimes I just end up having junk food snacks as my ""lunch"" or ""dinner"" we don't have a ton of good stuff at the house all the time.

Sorry if that's a lot to write but I really do wanna improve my overall health for both myself and my future and for my boyfriend and my oral health has been causing me major anxiety as of recently. I can elaborate and answer any questions. Thank you!",1,1755058841.0,hygiene,0,1.0,False
