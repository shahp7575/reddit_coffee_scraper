**The Space in Between**

Life, death‚Äîneither particularly interested Angela, but the one that she really could not stand was the space in between. Regretfully, that was the space she was in. She was probably dying; she could definitely see blood, which was never a good sign.



She had quite simply misjudged the timing a bit. Angela had no rhythm, in fairness, and she was in a hurry. But being hit by a car really changes your perspective on things. She knew she would miss her mother's birthday party. A smile crept onto her face, realizing there's no way her mother could be mad at this excuse.



She stared up into the sky, trying to amuse herself so she wouldn't pass out. She knew that if you fall asleep while bleeding out on the road, you're not asleep‚Äîyou're dead. The problem was, she was an extremely amusing person‚Äîto no one else but herself. She began thinking about Karl Marx and Frederick Engels making out in a 90s rom com. She didn't quite know where this came from but it was hilarious to her. Her own comedic sensibilities mixed with massive blood loss sent her into a giggling fit, much to the dismay of the driver who was on the phone with 111.



As the ambulance came, all they could see was a 19-year-old woman lying in the street in a pool of blood giggling to herself, and a very guilty and upset-looking middle-aged woman. Because of Angela's general vibe, they asked a lot of questions about drugs and which ones she was using.



Angela decided to fake confidence; fake it till you make it, as her doctor always said.



""I'm using most of them,"" she said, lying. She got jittery if she had a full cup of coffee. She was trying to sound cool for the hot ambulance medic. He responded in turn‚Äîvery impressed, I'm sure.



*""Which ones specifically?""*



His face was almost on top of hers, staring down at her and her head trauma.



*""Who cares, man, just go with the flow‚Ä¶ you single?""*



She sounded so chill, which was probably the blood loss.



*""We may be using medication that will conflict with recreational drugs or prescription drugs you are using.""*



He was all business, no fun at all. She responded, delirious as hell:



*""Fine‚Ä¶ You know I'm taking the cool ones. Like the, the, the ones in brat like the‚Ä¶ up-the-nose ones and the, ummm, through-the-shoulder ones.""*



*""Are you saying you are on meth, ketamine, and cocaine?""*



Saying those words out loud sort of grossed her out. She had been taught so long to hate those and the people who use them.



*""What?! No, what are you, a cop?""*



And then she passed out. All things considered, probably the right move. She didn't want to come on too strong. The ball was in his court now.",1,1750572451.0,writingcritiques,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm Chris ‚Äî 23, from Northamptonshire, currently experiencing that unique brand of loneliness where you start giving personalities to your kitchen appliances. My one plan for the weekend just got cancelled, so now I‚Äôm sat here with too many snacks, no social interaction, and the slow descent into boredom-induced madness.

I‚Äôm looking to make genuine new friends (ideally 18‚Äì30) ‚Äî preferably girls, if I‚Äôm honest. I‚Äôm gay and grew up around girls, so I just feel way more comfortable and natural chatting with them. I never quite figured out what to say to guys that doesn‚Äôt involve awkward small talk, gym routines, or pretending to care about football.

üé≠ Theatre nerd ‚Äî musicals, plays, and crying over characters I met 10 minutes ago

üéß Music-obsessed ‚Äî my playlists are chaos: Taylor Swift to techno in 3 songs flat


I‚Äôm hoping to find friends who are up for:

Chatting (random, deep, silly ‚Äî all of it)

Swapping memes and unhinged voice notes

Late-night convos about life, love, and whether ghosts have WiFi

Maybe even meeting up one day for coffee or a theatre trip (if we vibe)

1lhgt20,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1lhgt20/should_i_chase_after_this_girl_the_correct_answer/,Should I chase after this girl? (The correct answer is No.),"I've been hanging out with this girl for about two months but I've known her since Feb/Mar and hung out a few times here and there. She is attractive but what finally made me *attracted* to her is one night when we were hanging out with a group of friends, I bought shots for all of us, then she bought the next round of shots. To me this showed that she's willing to put in an equal amount of work. We also talked about our music tastes and it aligned pretty well. I wasn't sure if she was being honest with her music tastes or just saying that she likes the same bands as me as a sort of flirting. 



Skip forward to now since early May we've been hanging out every other weekend and again I find her attractive because we typically split paying for things. She is physically attractive as well, nice hair, big boobs, good smile, fun personality. She also said that she has a nurturing personality and likes to take care of people, keyword there is said. 



Today her and I talked a little bit more, we were supposed to hangout on Wednesday but she said she had a really hard week at work (regional department heads came in and she had to do a presentation). She then texted me at about noon this morning asking if I wanted to go to this Coffee House Music Festival, she sent the link and on the web page it said it ended at 3PM, I was still in bed and not even close to being ready. She said she'd still be down to go, so we both end up getting ready and get there around 2PM to park. We walk around because neither of us know exactly where it's at, there were 3 different festivals going on in the same area (Music Festival, Vegan Festival, & Coffee House Music Festival). We finally find where it is (same general area as the Vegan Festival). We go in and walk around for a bit, have some vegan food. 



Then we sit down and chat. Up to this point she's been pretty cool in terms of equality but she then starts doing a lot of borderline Andrew Tate quotes with 'I recognize the differences between men & women' and then she says that on dates there should only be one credit card paying for things (the guy's). I even asked her the current rent meme question of 'if one partner makes 400k & other makes 100k, should rent be split equally or by proportion?' She took the answer of proportion. I wonder if she'll stick by that because later in the evening she said that she remembered how old she was the first time her salary hit 100k, I make just over 50k after tax, no problem with her making more money than me but I'd love to see if she'd still think rent should be proportionally paid then. She also had this weird thing where she said 'when we're in a relationship we should be building each other up and that's when payments can be split but not when dating.' I then asked immediately 'when are you no longer dating and now in a relationship?' Did not get a clear answer lol. 



After we got dinner and I would have had no problem paying for it all myself but she pulled out her credit card and slipped it in the bill. We did have a small chat earlier about not making it a big deal to pay for other people, we just pull out our cards and pay. Because I had bought us drinks & ice cream earlier and she had bought lunch when my Zelle was taking too long (wish they had Venmo). I also mentioned how I had gone out on a date with this girl and she had requested that I drop her off at our destination then I park & that I'd get the car then pick her up at the front door. I had remarked how that was a red flag to me but my friend/crush had said she would want that & to have the guy open & close the car door for her. My friend did at least admit that it can be a ""beige flag that turns into a red or green flag."" 



My concern is just when it comes to these sorts of one sided demands, is the equality only in the bedroom to be sexually desired or allowed sex by the female? Equality is very important to me in a relationship and it's been a very rare but occasional thing I get. I'm thinking of just speedrunning and asking my crush out on a date in hopes that she says no or that she says that she doesn't view me like that. 

 

  
Part of me is really hoping that I'm just mistaking her comfort & hanging out with me. Because I do value her friendship and enjoy her company. We always talk about big topics and I super enjoy that with her. But in addition to the above average bumping into each other we do, today we were talking about self maintenance expenses and at one point she asked how much I spend on haircuts and combed her fingers through my hair. And when I parked, she had my phone & was giving directions so I reached my hand over for my phone but my hand was resting on her thighs for a solid ten seconds. 



It is funny because I had left my last girlfriend/thing to pursue this girl. My ex was very physically affectionate, which I adored but I do feel drawn or compelled to my current crush. I can't wait to be disappointed and find out that my crush doesn't like physical affection. However our hands, legs, and bodies are always bumping into each other. This was what made me think that she is open to the idea of dating me. I also get the feeling that she really likes it when we're in a crowd trying to navigate it and I end up just grabbing her and directing her through the crowd, or when we're about to cross the street and I see an oncoming car that could be dangerous, I just grab her hand and walk her across the street. I think she finds that highly masculine and really attractive when I do that. Earlier today we were jaywalking and I saw an oncoming truck but she was still walking, so I just put my arm in front of her then we held hands as we crossed the street. She also said during dinner that she likes it when a guy walks on the side of a street, I had done that earlier mostly due to the sun being extremely hot today and so I told her to walk in the shade (which would put me on the street side). Another thing I had done today which I'm not sure if she liked but I think she did was I had bought two water bottles and I would regularly tell her to drink water. Whenever I tell her to do something for her own wellbeing, she tends to follow it. However I shouldn't let this get to my head, telling a sweating person to drink water on an 80+ degree day isn't really bending their will. I just think she enjoyed me looking after her like that. 



I'm probably overthinking all of this because ultimately my complaint is ""oh no, I don't want to date this girl because she's going to stop paying for herself & wants to be treated very girly."" Even though I've been in plenty of relationships like that. Another reason why I shouldn't date her is because in about 90 days (September) a new facility for her work is going to open up in a different state and she may want to go there. I keep saying every time that I hope she stays in Xplace and she says ""I would like to come back to live in Xplace at some point but I want to prove to myself that I can live in a different state."" Which is odd because she moved here from Yplace and I asked her the question 'what does that really prove? Do you really doubt that you wouldn't be able to live in a different state?' Another red flag is that she's been very flaky with answering her phone recently, she was telling me today about how her sister called her four times and she was upset about it because she would have called her back but didn't want to deal with her sister at that time. Typically though for me I just expect a text back in about 2-3 days if it's a direct question text, if it's a ""I hope you have a nice day"" or ""this meme is funny"" text then I won't expect a response. She says she's been busy with work but it does feel odd because when I first got her number, we were texting a bunch while she was at work. Who knows, maybe she really did get busy. It's actually easier & faster to just message her on snapchat. Which that is a bonus, I feel like we always talking on snapchat. She replies to my photos on my story (this again makes me think she likes me). 



TLDR: Tell me I shouldn't go after her because she's moving away in 90 days and wants to be treated like a princess. ",0,1750572021.0,dating_advice,3,0.5,False

1lhgrvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1lhgrvo/theres_a_clear_cut_way_the_dajjalantichrist_can/,There's a clear cut way the Dajjal/Antichrist can win against Allah,"For those who don't know, the Dajjal is the antichrist in Islamic theology. He's described as a false messiah who'll lead people away from God until the Prophet Isa and the Mahdi will come out and defeat him, claiming victory for the faithful. 

All our sources agree that the Dajjal will be a normal human given superpowers from God in order to test the faithful, this is important because it clearly establishes Dajjal as a Bieng of free-will just like you and me. The hadiths describe him in great detail, his many signs, the things he'll do in order to deceive people. I'll qoute one of them here,

Prophet Muhammad Ô∑∫ said:
‚ÄúHe (the Dajjal) will come to people and invite them (to believe in him), and they will believe in him and respond to him. Then he will command the sky to rain and the earth to bring forth its vegetation, and their livestock will return to them in the evening with their humps very high, udders full of milk, and flanks stretched.‚Äù
[Sahih Muslim 2937]

He'd also be able to raise the dead back to life. 

He will kill a man and bring him back to life, and he will say to the people: ‚ÄòSee! I bring the dead to life. Am I not your Lord?‚Äô‚Äù
The Prophet then said:
‚ÄúBut he will not be able to do that to anyone else.‚Äù
 [Sahih al-Bukhari 1881] also in [Muslim 2938]

 
So from these authentic Hadiths we get a window into Dajjal's strategy but what if I told you that there's a better and fair and square way for Dajjal to achieve his goal. He doesn't have to raise people from the dead or perform false miracles. Heck he doesn't have to do anything at all. He can just sit back on his couch, play video games all day, have coffee, enjoy his life and he'd still win as long as he doesn't do what's been told in the hadiths. He has FREE WILL. And since he didn't do what's been told in the hadiths, this would make Muhammad wrong and Allah a liar, contradicting the scripture itself.

Hey there,

I‚Äôm a 32-year-old introvert with a not-so-secret wild streak, splitting my time between the cozy corners of Jalandhar and the electric buzz of Delhi on weekends. I might seem reserved at first, but beneath the surface, I‚Äôm all about cheeky banter, spontaneous adventures, and making memories that leave us both smiling long after the night ends.

I believe in the magic of a lingering glance, the thrill of inside jokes, and the art of making a woman feel truly desired. Whether it‚Äôs a flirty compliment whispered over coffee or a slow, meaningful conversation under the stars, I know how to make you feel like you‚Äôre the only woman in the room.

My ideal partner? Someone who‚Äôs as comfortable getting lost in deep, late-night talks as she is sneaking away for a weekend escape. I adore a woman who can match my wit, challenge my ideas, and isn‚Äôt afraid to let her playful side show.

When I‚Äôm not exploring new places (or new pleasures), you‚Äôll find me curled up with a novel, binging Netflix, or planning my next little adventure, always leaving room for a partner-in-crime to join me.

If you‚Äôre craving connection, laughter, and maybe a little bit of mischief, send me a message. Let‚Äôs see if we can turn sparks into something unforgettable.

So here's how I use it. I have the three buttons mapped to different programs. I created these by slightly adapting popular recipes I found on the app.

* A: Light roasts (custom)
* B: Dark roasts (custom)
* C: 340 ml of boiling water for tea (custom)

If I want a coffee I just weigh the beans, press A or B and I'm done. So far either A or B have worked great for all 5 coffees I've bought so far. My wife uses it for tea, and hasn't touched the kettle since we got the machine.

The flavors of different coffees really pop, while they were all kind of samey with my AeroPress. The convenience of automation is huge. I can easily make a few cups when family is over, despite it being a 1 cup machine. Having a good grinder integrated is amazing, the xBloom barely takes up any counterspace. I was also debating the Fellow Aiden, but have grinding as a separate, non-automated step, which also takes up counter space is a huge downside for me. I'm very happy I found my niche coffee solution and just want to share in case anyone is also looking or on the fence about buying.",2,1750571787.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

I even got a teapot so I can use loose leaf.

I had a cup of Earl Grey this morning and I was absolutely *wired* all day lol. But it felt so much better than soda. Tea is actually *good* for you. Everything in moderation, of course, but when you compare it to soda? Not even close. Plus I don't put much sugar in it. I like it a bit more bitter.

1lhgjsk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lhgjsk/i_am_in_love_with_my_best_friend_i_know_i_am_the/,"I am in love with my best friend, I know I am the only one who is. Should I confess","I (28M), am in love with my best friend‚Äîsomeone I will refer to as R (25F). We‚Äôve known each other since I was 17 and she was 15. When we first met, she was dating the sister of one of my closest friends who passed away. Our friend moved away, R and I grieved with each other. 

I have always loved R. She has always been the kind of person who brings light into any room: smart, charismatic, gentle, witty, and impossibly kind. She gives generously without expecting anything in return.  The kind of person that collects people into its orbit. 

When R was 16, she entered a deeply toxic relationship with a man (18M). It lasted seven years and ended in 2022. In that time, they married and had three children. The relationship was abusive‚Äîto her, and eventually to their children. While I won‚Äôt recount the details, they‚Äôre heavy enough that even imagining the worst wouldn‚Äôt feel far-fetched.

He stripped her of her connections‚Äîisolating her completely. She was not allowed to have friends; any bond she attempted to maintain was used against her. Despite my many attempts to stay in touch over those years, her world had become an island. 

That changed in 2023. She had just moved back to our home state, and for the first time in years, she allowed me back into her life‚Äîand to get coffee a single time. Then, before I could even understand what it meant, she was gone again, moving out of state. But something about that brief encounter stuck with me: she was still R. Still gentle. Still nurturing. I do not know what I had anticipated, I know her childhood was also deeply unsettling and traumatic.

As a teenager, she had been a live-in nanny, caring for children of addicts so that their parents had a chance at recovery and the children had a safe caregiver. That same love I used to witness her give to those kids; she now gives to her own kids. Supporting them through trauma while learning to soothe her own. She does so without ever losing the softness in her voice or the steady anchor of her presence. She says she was initially dysregulated and not gentle enough with them and it took a lot for her to become who they needed again. It is hard to imagine her any different.

We‚Äôve been in close contact over the past two years, mostly through Discord. She found safety in online gaming throughout the years. Friends helped her find the courage to leave her abuser. I see the way her online world wraps around her protectively. She is fiercely loved in those circles. And I know I‚Äôm not the only one who feels this strongly for her. I know for a fact other men and women are in love with her. 

There are other friendships: a man she frequently bickers with‚Äîplayfully, warmly. Their banter feels like a form of modest, unspoken flirting. I‚Äôve seen the way she opens up to him, trusts him, turns to him. It makes me jealous. I try to join in, but when I bicker, it comes out wrong‚Äî mean. I‚Äôve seen another man, too‚Äîsomeone she jokes with, confides in. I once saw him thank her for rejecting him. Their dynamic feels safe, natural. That stings in a different way: a reminder that I may not be the safe space for her vulnerability.

My jealousy doesn‚Äôt stem from entitlement, just longing. I want what they seem to have. That sense of intimacy. That ease. Though she never treats me poorly‚Äîshe checks in, responds with warmth‚ÄîI can tell she isn‚Äôt as open with me. I know I've made mistakes, tried to mimic a closeness in a way that came off as inconsiderate. She‚Äôs too gracious to say so, but I feel it.

Adding to that R has no patience for those who mistake her kindness for flirtation. She‚Äôs stunning, and men often misread her warmth as invitation for a relationship. She says she'd prefer casual hookups and has mentioned the men interested in her are not interested in casual hook-ups, they only want relationships, and I understand why‚Äî but she says it‚Äôs easier than sorting who‚Äôs safe for her children. She doesn‚Äôt want to gamble with their safety. She‚Äôs on the spectrum; misses signals others pick up on quickly. 

She is careful about everything, including her friends. She makes her friends for life. Says nothing bad about them and only speaks of them in a way full of love, admiration, and support. Even when delivering tough truths, she does it with compassion. She's careful. She is not careful in the way that holds back a single thought, but careful in a way that just shows she cares.

To add to all this, I believe she‚Äôs in love with someone now‚Äî long-distance‚Äîshe‚Äôs taken her time to decide. And I trust that she‚Äôs right. But here I am. Scared. Scared that I‚Äôve missed my moment. Scared that if I tell her how I feel, I‚Äôll fall into that category of friends who couldn‚Äôt just appreciate her without wanting more. 

I wonder sometimes if I‚Äôm good enough for her. She is relentless in her growth, always raising the bar for herself. I try to grow, too‚Äîfor myself, yes, but also because I want to be the kind of man who deserves to stand beside her.

The irony is that I already know what she would say if I confessed: she‚Äôd be gentle. Kind. Thoughtful. But I believe she wouldn‚Äôt feel the same. And even if our friendship survived, that question‚Äîthat quiet ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù‚Äîwould finally go silent. Right now, it's still alive. Still possible. If I speak it, it might die.

Should I tell her how I feel? Or should I stay where I am‚Äîclose enough to love her, too far to lose her?

Side note, she got me into poetry and writing, she loves all art. I kind of get wrapped up in it because we share our writing. It is one of the ways we bond. I realize this is all a bit fervent and I think she would like that. With however all this sounds, if I found out she was dating someone exactly like me, I would be sad for her. Some of the things I said, are direct quotes from her poetry. They stuck with me I love the way she loves and describes things. ",1,1750571040.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

After 4 months of consulting 5 different physicians (including Gastro), 3 endoscopies and multiple tests, they arrived at the diagnosis of Crohn's with stricture at the junction of duodenum & jejunum. After the diagnosis, I found that I had became intolerant to rice and potatoes. My mom and grandmom understood the disease after I explained it to them, but my dad's opinion was that this was not a disease and ""It's all becoz u ate lot of lemons, 3 years ago"".  
After completing the meds and avoiding the specific trigger foods (rice, potatoes), I went into remission.

Around 2 weeks back, I had a flare-up which kept on increasing in severity everyday. Me and my mom saw my dad was adding something like powder to the milk before I drank it. There was no taste or odor change in the milk thou. We had suspicions that he was also adding something to the salt and sugar in kitchen.  
So I stayed in my Granny's place for a few days. During the stay I had no symptoms, not even pain or bloating. Meanwhile my mom threw away everything that was suspicious and bought everything new. I returned back to my home, we are being very careful in locking everything in kitchen and ensuring only we have access to them. After doing all this I feel better and we have seen my dad trying to pry open the things we locked.

There are 2 other things that bothered me during this time which may or may not be related.

1. Just 2 days before my flare-up, I informed that I got selected for Masters in Europe and my dad and elder brother hated that and were against it. When I said I will be going there, he replied ""Something unexpected may happen and your plan may fail""
2. Before this recent Flare-up, there was a incident when like this time my dad was doing something in kitchen (My dad never uses the kitchen). I took a sip of the milk later and there was a strong taste of rust. So I threw it out entirely & didn't think much of it.

I asked about this issue in r/CrohnsDisease around 10 days prior & intended to publish this story here too but couldn't. Here are the events that happened after that.

1. I forgot to lock a jar of cookies inside the cabinet, ate them the next day & got sick again.
2. My mom's coffee has tasted weird multiple times and she also got sick after drinking it too.
3. My Dad broke into the locked kitchen cabinet and the refrigerator.
4. We replaced all the things there and shifted them to my granny's Home.
5. Me & my mom are travelling to my granny's home for every meal.
6. We also have suspicions that my brother knows about this and chose to ignore as he visited home and avoids eating anything at home.

We are taking careful steps to confirm these. (I don‚Äôt want to get into too much detail, but we are trying to get solid evidence before doing anything further.)  
Let me know if I‚Äôm overthinking, or what steps I should take next. I feel very unsafe and emotionally drained, but I just want to make sure I‚Äôm not losing perspective.

I went to my friend's house today and there was this awkward moment when her mom was telling her to put away the dishes. When my friend told her she would do it once I was finished visiting her mom started insisting. Then, my friend announced confidently that her mom says the same thing and that she was being a hypocrite. Obviously, I was terrified that I was going to be caught in the crossfire. To my surprise, her mom actually seemed to reflect and came to the conclusion that it was okay for my friend to do it after I left.

On the other hand, Event #1, I was doing dishes and before washing I have to put away the dry dishes washed earlier. My dad decided to insert himself into the dishwashing and helped put away the dishes even when I told him I wanted to just do it myself. That wasn't horrible. I also have to mention that when my dad washes the dishes he tells me to help and put away the dishes, which I do. So, I figured I should just be grateful. However, he then proceeded to stack the plastic Tupperware to the side and tell me that he doesn't like to put away the plastics. When I pointed out that he expects me to put all of it away even when it's supposed to be the job of the dishwasher and a kind bonus for someone to help, he told me that if I spoke again he'd get angry. Specifically, he said I was making him want to yell at me. So I stopped talking and quietly stewed in my disgust with his hypocrisy.

Event #2, I had gone off to do something in another room and left the TV on because I figured I was going to be right back. I ended up not coming back fast and asked my dad if he could pause the TV. For context, my dad does this often (about once a day) and always asks me to pause the TV for him. He didnt pause it and told me that I shouldve just paused it myself and that it didn't matter since I would have to rewind the show some anyways. I pointed out that I do it for him and he said that it wasn't the same because I'm typically sitting around doing nothing (not always true but some times) but at that moment he was being productive (watching his coffee being made in the Keurig). I told him that he can leave his coffee, pause the TV, and come back before it was finished being made. Again, he told me I was making him angry and I just stopped talking after that.

1lhfyqd,https://i.redd.it/0rdmctctve8f1.jpeg,I did an experiment with aripiprazole and caffeine. Here are the results!,"Hello! I did an interesting experiment. I would like to share the results here. Let's also say I celebrated 15 months of entrainment this month, which is yet another milestone! 

TLDR: there is some controversy regarding caffeine's possible effect on circadian rhythm with a study showing about 40 minute delay from evening caffeine exposure. The interaction between caffeine and aripiprazole is also unknown. I did an experiment to try and find out the answers to the questions. I took about 140 mg caffeine twice in the first half of the day for two weeks and observed about 2 hours of circadian *delay*, according to sleep diary and rectal temperature. After that I switched to around 140 mg caffeine once in the morning every other day and observed about 3 hours of phase *advance* in 9 days. In my case caffeine seemed to cancel out aripiprazole's phase advancing effect and provide a phase delaying effect of its own. Please take the experiment with a grain of salt. 

Now, let's get to the main part, shall we? 

But first, a disclaimer. This is not a scientific article by any stretch of the imagination, and the results should be interpreted carefully as they do not seem to be generalizable. Although I have chosen to format my article as a scientific study, it should not be considered one. It is just a personal article containing a personal experiment I did in a non-controlled environment. I am not a doctor, and this is also not medical advice. I want to be clear in that I want my experiment to be taken with a grain of salt and only considered anecdotal evidence. 

1. **The idea.** A few months ago I made a post here sharing my observations after a year of entrainment. I had noticed a circadian rhythm shifting effect likely coming from caffeine before making the post. However, u/Irq3000 said the effect of caffeine on circadian rhythm is very small and likely negligible. He also said that I could try restarting caffeine consumption without freerunning while continuing all the other parts of my circadian rhythm protocol. The idea was that the effect would be pretty small and insignificant.  

I was also personally curious about the possible interaction between caffeine and aripiprazole. Specifically, I was interested in their effects on circadian rhythm. To date, I haven't managed to find any information regarding the circadian rhythm effects of interaction between caffeine and aripiprazole, which made me curious to investigate it on my own. 

The main idea here is that caffeine can delay circadian rhythm, although likely not so strongly as light exposure in the circadian evening. See this article: [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4657156/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4657156/) . Aripiprazole, on the other hand, produced phase advancing effects in some anecdotal pieces of evidence and some studies like this one: [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5965391/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5965391/) . I have personally been able to get about 12 hours of phase advancing effect from aripiprazole and light/dark therapies in the past year, which is insane and led my from severe DSPD straight to ASPD. I documented it in my last post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/N24/comments/1j48j1p/one\_year\_of\_entrainment\_my\_observations/](https://www.reddit.com/r/N24/comments/1j48j1p/one_year_of_entrainment_my_observations/) . 



2. **The methods.** On May, 26th, I started taking caffeine everyday in the dosage of about 2 teaspoons of instant coffee Nescafe Gold (generally around 140 mg caffeine) twice in the first 6 or so hours of wakefulness and not later than 6 hours before bedtime. From June, 13th, onwards I started taking caffeine every other day in the dosage of about 140 mg just once in the morning. Notice the doses did not exceed the FDA recommended limit of 400 mg caffeine per day even if we take the highest possible dose found in Nescafe Gold (max 90 mg x 4 tsp = 360 mg daily). 

I kept everything else unchanged relative to what it was before the experiment. I did light/dark therapies everyday and took 7.5 mg aripiprazole (Abilify) in the morning. However, the dose of Abilify may have been as high as 15 mg considering I was also taking other drugs metabolized by the same enzymes. It's important to say I didn't change the dose of this drug in any way during the experiment. 

For light therapy, I either opened up my curtains until dark therapy if it was sunny enough outside or used the Luminette v3 glasses for about 5 hours on the brightest setting and opened up the curtains anyway. Light exposure was controlled by measuring my pupil size at home. It seems that having maximally constricted pupils indicated light therapy being most effective.

For dark therapy, I closed the blackout curtains and dimmed down the light in my room while making my computer screen very dim and red. I also made sure my pupils were maximally dilated during this time. Dark therapy started about 2-4 hours before bedtime just as it used to in the past. If I had to leave my room, I wore red tinted laser protection glasses and checked the size of my pupils.

For tracking my circadian rhythm, I used a sleep diary provided by Apple Health and occasional rectal temperature measurements during key periods of time (a few hours before bedtime, wake ups at night and first thing in the morning) that I did not log during the experiment. However, I can say that the pattern represented by the graphs was also represented by rectal temperature. 



3. **The results.** Notice I have attached a graph from my sleep diary to this post. Let's discuss it! 

You can see two trends on this graph. The first one represents a phase delay of about 2 hours in two weeks (8-9 minutes per day), and the second one represents a phase advance of about 3 hours in 9 days (about 20 minutes per day). The first one corresponds to the period in which I was taking approximately 280 mg caffeine each day in two doses, and the second one corresponds to me taking approximately 140 mg caffeine in the morning every other day. 



4. **Discussion.** So, I have observed a very interesting effect worth discussing.

The first thing that comes to mind is that the article I linked says that caffeine's effect on circadian rhythm seems to be dose-dependent, which seems to be confirmed in my case. That means that the higher dose of caffeine produced a much more pronounced circadian delay than the lower dose. 

What does this all mean? Let's first talk about phase delay in the first half of the experiment. Where did it come from? I was doing light and dark therapies each day, and the dose of aripiprazole was not changed, so the only likely cause would be this big dose of caffeine itself, in my opinion. 

Now, what about the phase advancement in the second part of the experiment? You can see my previous post to clarify where it came from. The answer may be light/dark therapy and low-medium dose aripiprazole. The effect was not new for me. In fact, I just used the tactic that had already worked. 

Let's also address the freerunning question here. u/Irq3000 said that I would not freerun if I would start taking caffeine on a regular basis. Provided Non-24 usually has 24.5+ hour long cycles and I had a maximum delay of about 8 minutes per day, I would say that likely I wasn't freerunning. Or at least I wasn't freerunning in the time window of the experiment. However, for me personally, having this ability to shift my circadian rhythm forward with my protocol is absolutely crucial, because I do get delayed from time to time by occasional light exposure in the evening. And messing up circadian rhythm can lead to insomnia and worsen my mental health issues, which can lead to disaster. 

I would also like to say that we could theoretically consider the phase delay from caffeine bigger, because it effectively canceled out the phase advancement seen with aripiprazole. That would mean around 30 minutes of net delay per day compared to smaller doses of caffeine, but I still wouldn't exactly say I developed Non-24 from taking caffeine daily. 

I think this is it for the discussion session. As much as I would like to discuss how aripiprazole actually affects circadian rhythm and theorize how caffeine might do so, I don't really have any data or studies to back up my claims, so I would rather abstain from doing so.  

 

5. **Limitations.** Now let's discuss the limitations of my experiment. 

First of all, small sample size of just 1 person does not provide any generalizability. Secondly, I didn't know the exact caffeine content I was consuming. It was an approximation based on manufacturer's median values. Thirdly, I didn't know the rate of caffeine metabolism in my body, which means it could have stayed in my body for either very long, typical or very short periods of time. Fourthly, there were external sleep disturbances during the second part of the experiment that made the sleep patterns a bit more ambiguous and fragmented. Finally, I updated the sleep tracker app during the experiment, which changed the appearance of the graphs and may have changed the quality of sleep tracking. 

I must say the experiment should definitely be taken with a grain of salt, considering all of the above. 

6. **Conclusion.** Taken with some skepticism, these results may indicate that in some individuals like me with previously diagnosed Non24 and DSPD who are now taking aripiprazole and have managed to entrain with light/dark therapies, caffeine may provide a potentially substantial circadian delay even when taken in the first half of the day and long before sleep, and may cancel out the effects of aripiprazole on circadian rhythm. Reducing caffeine intake seems to restore aripiprazole/light+dark therapy phase advancing effect on circadian rhythm in my case.

**Can someone tranate from toddler-ese? 'bah-bee-tah'**



ETA: oof on the title typo, obviously y'all figured out I meant ""translate"". I guess the toddler speak is spreading to me too.

Our 16 month old has started to say this when he sees some cars. I haven't figured out the pattern yet on which cars, and he says ""cars!"" all the time when he sees other cars on the road or in a picture book.

What word do we think ""bah-bee-tah"" actually is?? It's making me crazy (not actually, more in a fun way) and it's even more remarkable because he has no other three syllable word. Barely any two syllable, to be honest.

I figured I'd workshop this here first, and if we have no luck I'll ask his day care at pickup tomorrow (closed today for Juneteenth).

*I have an undergrad degree in speech pathology and I feel pretty strongly ""tah"" is car. Look up ""phonological processes,"" which will show you charts of common ways that kiddos will alter words to be easier for them to say. It's actually quite sophisticated.*

*""Fronting"" is a very common phonological process, where sounds formed in the back of the mouth, like /k/ and/g/, are fronted to be /t/ and /d/, like ""tat"" instead of ""cat"" or ""dough"" instead of ""go."" The /b/ sound is in the front of the mouth, so it's easier to assimilate the /k/ to /t/ in that phrase. Obviously he can say /k/ if he says ""car"" in isolation, but saying it in a cluster of words is a lot harder. Also /r/ is one of the hardest (latest developing) sounds in English, so I'd be surprised if he actually says ""car"" and not something more like ""cah.""*

*For ""buh-bee"" I'd just consider what you say to him in play or when out and about because at 16 months this is almost surely something he's imitating rather than a thought he created himself. Do you say ""bye bye"" car a lot? Or ""beep beep?""*

>OOP: This is super cool, thank you!! He says bye bye on his own without issue fairly clearly, and same with beep beep. Who knows, lol!

**Update - 2 days later**



Yesterday at day care pick up I asked one of his teachers if she knew what it was, and that he seemed to say it around vehicles, but still also used the word ""car"" too when he spotted a car on the road, or whatever.

She didn't seem to know. I asked if they had a Barbie car since a lot of y'all suggested that one, but she said they don't, at least not in his age group's play area.

She did though then say that they all right now are suuuuuper obsessed with the garbage truck lately that comes through their parking lot. That they get really excited.

So this morning I showed him some pictures of regular cars, and then a couple garbage trucks, and he indeed said ""bah-bee-tah"" unprompted when I got to the trucks!

I'm still confused why his dad's newly acquired 1960s era truck that he's going to renovate is also bah-bee-tah, but I'm wondering if they are the same color as the parking lot garbage truck. His dad's truck is painted over in like a matte beige that I absolutely have seen garbage trucks in a very similar color.

So, for now, I'm considering this mystery solved. Thanks all!

As I became more secure in my attachment and less sacrificial and tolerant of a dynamic that way day-to-day pretty one sided, the relationship slowly collapsed, and I grieved with it. 

I continued healing my attachment, and am I'm probably slightly more so secure than anxious, and I feel ready to date again. 

I met this sweet quiet girl from Colombia in my trig class that clearly likes me and I want to ask her out to coffee then to play pool at the local arcade. My brain is just scanning for red flags that could get me hurt again. If I wasn't like this, asking her out would be easy.

I just want to be with a good girl who is great company that loves cuddles, quality time, and traveling. I find pleasure in the small things like going to the grocery store together or a walk in the park. 

Has anyone in my shoes found a way to get over this?

A little about me:

* I‚Äôm¬†**32 (turning 33 in August)**,¬†**single**, with¬†**no kids**, and moving on my own.
* I‚Äôm currently living in¬†**North New Jersey**, about¬†**30 minutes outside of NYC**¬†(without traffic).
* I‚Äôm an¬†**occupational therapist (**I **work in healthcare)**‚ÄîI‚Äôll likely be doing¬†**travel contracts or PRN work**¬†in the area.
* My¬†**max rent budget is $1,700/month**¬†(preferably before utilities, but flexible for the right fit).
* I¬†**have a car**, so I don‚Äôt need to be right next to public transit, but I‚Äôd love to be somewhere¬†**walkable or near coffee shops, restaurants, parks, etc.**
* **Safety is really important**¬†to me as a woman living alone.
* I‚Äôm also looking to¬†**meet people, make new friends, and date**, so I don‚Äôt want to feel too isolated or tucked away. At least at the beginning.

Neighborhoods I‚Äôve liked so far (please correct me if I am wrong of things I read):

* **Bishop Arts**¬†(my favorite‚Äîlove the vibe and walkability) was looking into the Bishop Ridge area and 212 Melba for example (close to Bishop arts, but quiet area) maybe even Bishop Central (just lacking the gym and pool)
* **Old East Dallas near Lower Greenville**¬†(love the energy, but heard its for the young 20s, I‚Äôve heard it can be super unsafe‚Äîlots of car break-ins, petty theft, etc.‚Äîso that gives me pause)
* **Downtown Plano**¬†(super charming, but it feels more family-oriented and I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd meet like-minded people there. It also seems a bit far if I want to hang out or go out in the city.)
* I also like¬†**Knox/Henderson**¬†and¬†**Uptown**, but they may be out of my budget unless there‚Äôs a hidden gem.

I‚Äôd love to live somewhere that feels¬†**creative, young 30s-friendly, safe, and still has good access to fun or social energy**. Are there any other areas you think I should explore‚Äîeither now or on my next visit?

It may already be common knowledge but I only recently discovered it so I thought I should share.

Up until my mid-late 30s I was able to drink 2-3 cups of coffee a day without issue. Then in recent years to my horror I became so sensitive that a single cup could have me genuinely on the verge of a panic attack. I tried everything - loads of water, never drinking it on an empty stomach, only drinking it as a pre-workout so I'd burn the excess energy off right away etc. Nothing really worked.

Until I discovered from a Chatgpt search that anxiety from caffeine can mean that your CYP1A2 enzyme is slow or deficient and that you can easily raise this by eating cruciferous vegetables. This immediately made sense, as I had cut broccoli, cauliflower & brussel sprouts from my diet years earlier due to me being diagnosed with IBS-C & them being high-Fodmap.

I started having as much as I could manage with every meal - 2 broccoli florets with breakfast, 2 brussel sprouts with lunch etc. After about 10 days I dared to drink my first coffee in weeks & the difference was night & day. It felt like how coffee used to feel in my 20s where it was all positive & zero jitters, irritability, ruminating etc etc. A few weeks in now & I can say it genuinely has been life changing in a small way.

So if my story looks familiar it may be worth a try. I have just ordered a couple of different cruciferous vegetable supplements to see if they work as well without me having to actually eat the veg 3 times a day (which is becoming a pain).

PS a few people I've told this to swear it must be placebo, which I am open to the idea of, but the change has been so profound & (so far) lasting that I really don't think so.

background:

he has PTSD from childhood abuse (which i have just learned commonly correlates strongly with low cortisol). we've been together 25 years so i've seen all this unfold. About 10 years ago, he began waking up nightly, hungry, and eating in the middle of the night, with the feeling that he couldn‚Äôt fall back asleep without being full (blood glucose crash?)¬†

Like lots of folks, he had ongoing heightened anxiety (and bad PTSD flares) during the first several months of COVID. After several months of that, he started to get consistent low mood/freeze state and anxiety at 10 pm, trouble falling asleep, low motivation during the day. Changed antidepressants- started sertraline and then wellbutrin. Sertraline did not help on its own but wellbutrin did. Since then, he's had sustained 10 pm mood crash (it's like a switch flips- i can sometimes see it happen in real time) and then anxiety/agitation/won't sleep/cant really do anything else though. Waking to eat stopped and was replaced by late night binging/cravings for salty food and carbs between 10 pm and 1 am, then sleeping the rest of the night.

He was diagnosed w cancer in fall 2023. four months of intense chemo with steroids; it was rough but the response to the initial steroids seemed typical (high for 2-3 days, then crash/exhaustion). Then he had surgery, then he started getting chemo through a pump that goes directly to the liver (so less gets in the bloodstream and can have very few side effects). That comes with 23 mg dexamethasone that gets released over the course of 2 weeks each round, but he didnt feel it the first cycle of pump chemo. then they added more systemic chemo with 4 mg dex each time. his response to steroids was still pronounced but in the realm of normal. The nighttime low mood/anxiety/binging thing continued but didnt get worse.

He hd a break from treatment and then started systemic again this winter. Nighttime low mood, anxiety, binging and addictive behaviors increased (again only after 10 pm on the dot); daytime low mood and motivation started to become more present and persistent.¬†Since then he's been on and off chemo with this late night thing still TOTALLY persistent throughout, and when he started liver pump chemo again four weeks ago, the reaction to the dex (which had been no big deal a year earlier) was INTENSE. big irritability, mood swings, motivation problems, and the 10 pm switch became super intense. big food cravings and other dopamine-seeking behaviors at night increased too.

A week and a half ago, he had systemic chemo with 4 mg dex. The same day his cortisol was tested and it came back as 0.2.

This, um, seems to explain a lot.

Then, the crash (four days later) when the steroids totally wore off was scary. rage, disorientation, not in touch with reality, etc. He's made his way back from that- currently has no steroids in the pump and the others have worn off, and he saw an ER doctor who told him to start taking his trazodone at 10 pm every night, which he has listened to, and not intermittent fast during the day (which he has done for a long time), and stop drinking coffee after 1 pm, which he has, and he's stabilized in a basic way, though he still feels REALLY off and anxious and low mood/motivation, says he doesnt feel like himself, has no stress tolerance, feels awful.

We are going to an endocrinologist monday morning. IT's pretty clear he has HPA axis suppression, probably for a long time because of the childhood trauma, obviously hugely exacerbated by all these steroids for almost two years. He's on a routine now of taking trazodone before the nighttime crash, and prescribed ketamine helps (as a bandaid) for the acute mood symptoms, and his psychiatrist has discussed low dose naltrexone with me as something that could help. I'm a good advocate and have a big list of tests i want the endo to do on monday.

but he has MORE CHEMO in the pump and systemic coming up on THURSDAY. hopefully there will be enough bloodwork back by then that the oncologist can think about steroids and how they will interface with all of this?

the AI is obviously getting progressively worse especially with the steroids. but we need to balance it out, and some of that has to come quick to keep from increasingly bad crashes every time he has chemo.

Does anyone have any advice about what to ask for, what might be going on, and what things might help right away? I don't think they can give him hydrocortisone and i also dont think that makes sense given all the other steroids hes intermittently on?

my mom's always on my case about not doing enough around the house, like taking out the trash or helping with meals. and my siblings are frustrated with me for not being more present in family convos. they don't get why i'm just withdrawn and quiet all the time.

i know they're hurting too, but it feels like they're expecting me to just ""get over it"" and be the same person i was before. they don't understand that depression isn't something you can just snap out of. it's like i'm drowning in this sea of sadness and i don't know how to keep my head above water.

lately, i've been finding solace in online dating, which sounds kinda weird, i guess. but talking to strangers has helped me feel seen and heard in a way my family isn't right now. been chatting with this one person, and it's been really nice to have someone who doesn't expect anything from me except to be myself.

I cut out sugary drinks and drank alternatives instead. I have tried only water before, but would cave for teas and flavored drinks. Alternatives changed the game for me. I love Zevia drinks, with stevia, and Monk teas, with monk fruit, and got me to a good place. Then I moved on from those to straight up water most days (aim for 64oz or more daily) and use water flavoring packets if want some flavor. Zevia has caffeine versions too. In a pinch at events, I'd do diet or zero versions of sodas or have flavoring handy. 

Never drinking calories, or even having the desire too, has made a huge difference in my mindset. I don't even think twice at coffee shops or places, I am simply not interested.

People gave me mixed opinions about how to go about it. I came clean about my history with him later that day, as I felt she deserved to know. She looked upset that I didn't tell her immediately that he wasn't just a high school friend, but someone I was intimate with.

Surprisingly, she said she doesn't mind us talking again as long as we don't do anything ""inappropriate"" iykwim. Seeing him again has made all those complex feelings that I had back then return. We weren't exclusive back then, he wanted us to be. I wasn't ready so I ended the fwb.

We've started chatting, catching up, and sending (normal) pictures. Although my gf says she doesn't mind, part of me still doesn't want to get too close.

He says he isn't interested in anything sexual and only wants to remain friends. Our history is in the past. He invited me out for coffee yesterday and I said yes. I believe I'm an adult, so I don't need permission to hang out with my friends. But me and my gf likes transparency, so I told her he invited me out.

She said she would like to come join us. I told him that later on and he got upset, claiming he wants to catch up without a ""third party"" (referring to my gf).

I honestly don't see what the big deal is. She never cared to join when it's my other friends inviting me somewhere. Like I know we used to be fwb but it's not like anything is going to happen in a coffee shop. I can't help to feel a bit annoyed by both of them. It feels like she doesn't trust him around me, and I don't know why he is so bothered by her joining.

she has been getting more suspicious with how much we message each other. Part of me feels like ever since I came out as bi and told her he's gay she believes I'm going to cheat on her or something. She won't say it directly, but it's the vibe I'm getting.",0,1750566660.0,AskMenAdvice,33,0.25,False

We‚Äôve been on 3 dates so far, the first we had coffee, second we played mini golf and got ice cream, and the third we went for a walk. Each time has been very enjoyable, we have no issues talking to each other and there‚Äôs never really been awkward silences or moments where the conversation felt forced, but something I can‚Äôt really ignore is that we haven‚Äôt progressed much physically. 

As of the third date we‚Äôve only had some small touches and a hug at the end of the last date. Now normally I would be very worried about this, but I think she‚Äôs either inexperienced, shy, or wants to take things slow. She‚Äôs still agreeing to dates, she makes a genuine effort to keep the conversation going in person and over text, and she has shown some subtler signs of flirting over text (Making a comment on the effort I was putting into planning the third date and saying it was ‚Äúso cute‚Äù, suggesting we watch a movie together, and most recently saying ‚ÄúOkay gentleman‚Äù after suggesting the fourth date, this isn‚Äôt everything but just a few examples that stick out). If she truly was interested I don‚Äôt see why she would keep engaging with me like this instead of pulling away, leaving me only to conclude she‚Äôs just nervous or has a different way of going about dating. It also doesn‚Äôt really help that I‚Äôm an inexperienced and shy person myself and I usually need blatantly obvious signals before I initiate things, so it‚Äôs been an awkward dynamic. After the second date I opened up a bit and said it had been a while since I had dated, she said appreciated the transparency and talked about how she thought it was important to discuss those kinds of things instead of beating around the bush. 

I suggested dinner and drinks for the 4th date, which she agreed to. I am undoubtedly going to ask how she‚Äôs feeling about things and how she‚Äôs approaches dating so we can both get some clarity, I almost want to just text her and ask but I feel it‚Äôs a conversation that‚Äôs better saved for in person. I also want to progress things on this next date, at least kiss which I feel would be reasonable if the mood is there. To some extent I don‚Äôt really care how fast or slow we take things, but I do want to know she‚Äôs interested and comfortable working towards advancing things.

You caught me by surprise 

Coffee, bubbles, curious

A spark in those lost blue eyes

Just another night for you

Tore my world in two

.

In the woods our love grew 

our playtime we'd find

Fancy dinners for two

Your hand in mine

.

Late night snugs

Storytime & hugs

Lay on my chest

Your hand in mine

.

Driving my car

Ivy to my quinn

There's your star

Your hand in mine

.

Long deep kisses at night

Staring into your eyes

Massages by candlelight

Your hand in mine

.

Lap naps & Cabin trips

A little time...

Coloring books & Coffee sips 

Your hand in mine

.

A life we built

Partners in crime

Still so much guilt

Your hand in mine

.

Worked on the flaws

Intentions were pure 

Words felt like claws

Your hand still in mine

.

Too close.

Too honest.

Too much.

It's not, I promise. 

I have your hand in mind. 

.

A Guilt turned to shame

I asked for the truth 

I'm the one to blame

.

The full truth never came

I ask for your hand,

Forever.

I understand your pain.

Acceptance. 

.

Worthy and deserving 

A beautiful soul

Your hand may be fragile

But it's mine to hold. 

.

Trust goes both ways

It grows with time

Just like our love

With your hand in mine. 

...


I'll miss you forever

This feeling stills time.

Nothing seems right

Without your hand in mine. 

.

I'm not there to protect you

And that scares me to death

Enough years after school it seems the pool dries up and there are no 'natural' ways to run into women anymore in the course of everyday life. My problem is 80-90% very few women are interested and maybe 10-20% the few that might be I don't find physically attractive. Just wondering if there was anything I was missing or ways to improve my game.

This is what I am trying so far with no real success:

Online 'dating' apps Tinder/Hinge/Bumble/CoffeeMeetsBagel: Paid for some of them. All I have to show for it is a few likes. Universally the women will either unmatch immediately or stop responding after a couple lines. Not entirely sure why since while I'm no Shakespeare my openings aren't any worse than others I've seen. I think I've gotten one actual date from the years I've been on this shit.

Workplace: Everybody at work seemingly is already in a relationship.

IRL Social Network: I have a very sparse social network. I've tried to cultivate a larger one without much more success than my attempts to court women. Turns out older working adults don't want to hang out that much. Let alone do so to provide an avenue for you to network with someone else.

Hobbies: My true hobbies are mostly internet and computer related or things you sit inside a building often alone on. Not much of the right social potential there.

Going out to Events: Easier said than done. Without a network the only thing I can think of is to scroll through Eventbrite and hit up random events. Usually the result is I awkwardly meander through a bunch of families or random people in their own groups hoping to run into a single woman.

Singles events/speeding dating: Compared to general events and online dating at least I actually meet a few women but success is still very low. Usually I don't have any matches or I'll get a number or match and they won't respond. And to be honest I am not really physically attracted to most of the women that tend to attend these events that I've been to. Yep I understand 'shoe on other foot' But these women don't show much interest in my either.

Family: My family has introduced me to some girls. But either they aren't interested or in other cases I just didn't find them physically attractive. I never 'dump' them. I just don't feel attracted enough to them to go full bore marriage mode right away for someone overseas and apparently that ends my chance.

Walking up to randos: The only way I can consistently 'meet' women I'm attracted to. The problem with this I can't do it outside of a few rare times without coming off as extremely creepy. I'm generally only able to pull it off when I'm in a situation where I see the girl multiple times and/or can strike up a natural long term conversation with them and opportunities for that I find in practice are much rarer than one might think. In order to expand I'll have to master the art of simply walking up to girls and immediately propositioning with no build up and I haven't built up the balls to do that yet. Oh and theres also the everpresent danger that they might have a boyfriend or husband around which makes this even more difficult.

Stuff I'm trying to work on:

Work Out, dressing and being presentable .

Stuff I haven't really done yet:

Start a sidegig/hobby like salsa dancing, yoga, volunteer at a animal shelter etc that women like: This is the advice I hear a lot and I'm sort of confused how to pull it off due to the type of time commitment (at least with events you can knock them out rapidly on your own schedule). If I come in the first day as an animal shelter volutneer and don't see anyone I like can I just drop it since I don't really have an interest in the gig otherwise? Or do I just continue to volunteer for the next few months to not be rude?

So how's my strategy? Is there something big I'm missing or improvement I can make?",3,1750565877.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False
