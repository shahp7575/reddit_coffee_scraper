It feels like the only new products we get are different flavored cold brew or cold brew concentrates, or some gimmicky tea. The winter hot chocolates lasted about one week in my store, and the winter coffee blends were two variations of the same thing: spiced coffee. There's just no creativity! And the different variations of cold brew sit on the shelf (or get plussed out!), taking up our extremely limited space while selling horrifically. 

I wish we had at least one more light roast option - maybe a light roast whole bean? A play on Starbucks Blonde roast or something?

I would also like to see some product innovation in the same spirit of the (relatively) new RTD espresso - perhaps a powdered latte mix in the same lane as the Chai and the two matcha latte mixes we have? Or some new coffee product I wouldn't think would be possible for TJ's to sell?

I also love the gifting options we get in other sections - Chocolate passports, honey trios, etc. I wish we had a holiday gift box that had 3-5 different single origin packets of grounds, even if it cost $19.99 or something. They could just not blend the 5 country blend together, grind up the single country beans, and add it to a artsy box. 

Anyways, I guess this post is just an outlet for the creativity I wish TJ's had when it comes to the C/T section. I know its the smallest section, I know some of the more out-there stuff we already have are slow movers (at least in my store). I just wish they would try something, *anything* other than a new cold brew flavor; it is getting boring on my shelves!",3,1767584708.0,tjcrew,1,1.0,False

1q4b1z5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q4b1z5,"Ew... I Slept With My 'Bro' For 3 Years?! Well, GO HELL, F*ckboy!","Grayson sent me a shirtless pic with one text: \[Coming over tonight.\]


My heart raced. The second my plane landed, I went straight to him.


Found him on his knees outside his building. Tying another girl's shoelaces.


I stopped dead. Everything went cold.


I thought he'd panic when he saw me. Scramble for an excuse.


Instead, he smiled.


""Ava! Perfect timing. This is Brielle—my girlfriend.""


Then he turned to her.


""Babe, this is Ava. We go way back. Just friends.""


I felt myself shut down.


So that's it. I was just a hookup with history.


That night, I blocked him everywhere.


Put in for a transfer.


But the day I left, he showed up crying.


""Where are you going?!""


""Somewhere you're not.""


...


Grayson texted me a shirtless pic: \[Coming over tonight.\]


I practically sprinted off the plane.


But when I got to his building, there he was—crouched down on the sidewalk, tying some girl's shoelaces like a lovesick golden retriever.


I stopped cold.


I thought he'd panic. Maybe stammer. Something.


Instead, he smiled.


""Ava! This is Brielle. My girlfriend.""


He turned to her, still grinning.


""Babe, this is Ava. We've known each other forever. Just friends.""


Just friends.


The words hit me like a punch.


Brielle narrowed her eyes at me, then turned on him.


""Friends don't show up straight off a plane dragging luggage behind them.""


He jumped in fast.


""Babe, seriously—we grew up together. That's all it is.""


Then he looked at me, annoyed.


""Why'd you even come here? You should've just gone home.""


The wind blew my hair across my face. Good. It hid the tears.


I glanced down and saw my shoelace trailing loose. I bent down, tied it, wiped my eyes.


""Just passing through.""


Brielle was still sulking. Grayson barely looked at me as he waved me off.


""Yeah. Go.""


I turned and wheeled my suitcase away, throat burning.


After college, we both stayed in the city.


One night at some work party, he got blackout drunk. I helped him out of his jacket—and suddenly, he kissed me.


In the dark, I didn't stop him.


I'd wanted him since we were kids.


Friendship was just the excuse I used to stay close.


The next morning, I tried to laugh it off. Told him we should forget it.


He didn't laugh. He kissed me again.


After that, everything changed.


We held hands in the snow. Kissed at midnight. Spent nights wrapped up in each other.


I thought we were together.


Turns out I was the only one who did.


I got home and just... collapsed on the couch.


Everything that just happened kept running through my head on a loop. It was so fucking stupid.


My phone lit up. Grayson.


\[You home?\]


I stared at it.


The whiplash was insane.


Did that actually just happen?


How do you tell someone you love them while you're still fucking someone else?


My stomach lurched. I barely made it to my knees before I started dry-heaving.


Another text.


\[Be there in 10.\]


I laughed. I was crying, but I laughed.


So that's what I was. A booty call with a history.


\[Don't come over.\] I texted him back.


Typing bubble. Then:


\[What's your problem? We've always been like this.\]


\[Or are you mad I have a girlfriend now? Chill. I'm not even sleeping with her yet.\]


I actually laughed out loud. It was that ridiculous.


When did I ever say I was okay with this?


Every time I slept with him, every time I let him touch me—it was because I loved him.


And he thought—


\[You were into it too.\]


I blocked him without thinking twice. Deleted his number. Everything.


Then I locked myself in the shower and stayed there for two hours.


Like I could scrub him off my skin. Undo every stupid decision.


I just felt disgusting.


For giving him everything. For getting nothing back.


When I got out, he was already inside.


He grabbed me before I could say anything, pulled me close, mouth on my neck, hands everywhere.


""Damn. You showered without me?""


He dangled a box of condoms. ""Let me hop in real quick. Then we're good.""


I snatched the box and threw it straight in the trash.


""Give me my key back. And leave.""


He stopped. Blinked.


""Wait—are you serious right now? Did you actually catch feelings?""


He laughed. Like it was funny.


""Come on. We've known each other since we were kids. There's nothing new here.""


I felt humiliated. Crushed. I couldn't even breathe.


He finally got that I wasn't joking.


He tossed the key on the floor.


""Don't tell Brielle.""


Pause.


""I really love her.""


That broke something in me.


He knew exactly what he was doing.


Whatever was left of my dignity, he ground it into the floor.


Along with every memory that used to matter.


I bit down hard so my voice wouldn't shake.


""Fine.""


Chapter 2


I dragged my ass to work the next day.


Because that's what you do. You fall apart after five.


I threw myself into every project I could find. If I stayed busy enough, maybe I wouldn't have to think.


That night I was scrolling Instagram when Grayson's story popped up.


My stomach flipped.


When I first got on there, I'd bugged him until he followed me back. Took forever.


My thumb hovered over his name. I knew I shouldn't.


I clicked anyway.


There they were. Faces pressed together. Fireworks exploding over Disneyland.


I really into theme parks. I'd asked him a hundred times to go with me.


Same line every time: ""That's for kids. We're almost thirty. Why would we go?""


Guess it wasn't about Disneyland. It was about me.


I kept scrolling.


He looked so fucking happy.


Every memory I thought was ours—he was already making new ones with her.


I didn't sleep until three.


Anger and heartbreak kept ripping through me in waves.


I didn't get it.


What did I do wrong? Why was I the one drowning while he got to be fine?


...


Christmas was coming. Work made us stay through Christmas Eve to hit some bullshit deadline.


Everyone complained. I was relieved.


Grayson's family lived across the hall. Every year our families had dinner together on Christmas Eve.


At least now I had an out.


By the time everyone left, it was past midnight.


Fireworks started going off outside. I stood at the window watching them fade and didn't realize I was crying until my vision blurred.


Suddenly someone tapped my shoulder.


I spun around. My manager Liam stood there with two coffees.


I wiped my face fast.


I thought I was alone.


Smiling, I took the cup. ""Thanks.""


He kept his voice soft. ""Why are you still here?""


I pressed my lips together. ""Leaving soon.""


He smiled a little. ""You're always so put-together. Never seen you cry before.""


Beat.


""Bad breakup?""


I froze. ""How'd you know?""


He shrugged. ""You stopped posting about him.""


I had nothing to say.


Yeah. I used to post about Grayson constantly. Like I needed proof he was mine.


Liam seemed to catch my embarrassment.


""If your love life's a shitshow, throw yourself into work. Company's opening a southern office. We need someone to lead it.""


He looked at me.


""Board wants you. You in?""


...


It was late so Liam drove me home.


Halfway there, snow started falling.


I watched it through the window. Last Christmas it snowed too.


Back the, Grayson and I set off sparklers in the snow. It came down so thick it covered our hair.


My nose went numb but I didn't want to go inside. He grabbed my hand and shoved it in his jacket pocket.


""What's with you? You're walking like a turtle.""


I blamed the weather. ""Waiting for more snow.""


He stopped. Cupped my face. Kissed my forehead.


He grinned. ""That what you were waiting for?""


...


My head was spinning.


Was any of that real? Or was I just some idiot replaying fake memories?


My phone buzzed.


Grayson. I still knew his number by heart.


\[Why aren't you home? Your mom said you're still at work. I'll come get you.\]


I glanced at it. Tossed my phone in my bag.


Five minutes later Liam pulled up outside my building.


I got out. He stopped me.


""Hey—your fly.""


I looked down. My zipper had busted open. No idea when.


My face went nuclear. I yanked at it five times. Wouldn't budge.


Kill me now.


He smiled. ""Marry Christmas.""


Then he drove off.


I stood there wrestling with my zipper like an idiot.


Then I turned and looked up.


Grayson was standing there.


So was Brielle.


Her smile was all teeth. ""Oh wow. You two were just in his car and... haha... Christmas hookup?""


""Starting strong!""


I snapped, ""It's not like that!""


She waved me off. ""Girl, relax. We're all adults. Grayson and I couldn't keep our hands off each other last time either. We were in the—""


She giggled and shoved his arm. ""You're so bad!""


Grayson's face turned to stone. His voice went ice-cold.


""Don't compare yourself to her. She's not exactly picky, if you know what I mean.""


At his words, Brielle fake-gasped, still giggling. ""Babe, that's mean.""


He looked at me like I was dirt on his shoe. ""She's desperate and fake as hell.""


Then he turned to Brielle, voice soft again.


""You're nothing like her.""


Pause.


""You've got class. She's just... easy.""


Brielle ate it up.


I stood there. Nails digging into my palms so hard I thought I'd draw blood.


""You're right,"" I said. Voice steady. ""I didn't know what good sex was until now.""


I smiled.


""Guess my standards were in hell.""


Grayson's face went black.


Chapter 3


Christmas morning, I woke up to chaos in the living room.


Grayson's mom barged in and shook me through the blankets.


""Get up, beautiful! You missed dinner last night. You're coming to lunch, and I'm not taking no for an answer.""


I rubbed my eyes, still half asleep. Grayson stood behind her looking like he wanted to strangle someone.


I was already scrambling for an excuse.


My mom smiled. ""Grayson's girlfriend is coming over. Mabel invited all of us.""


My brain stalled.


Wait—already meeting the parents?


""Mabel, I don't think—""


My dad groaned. ""This girl. When's she gonna find someone? All she does is work. Your mother and I are going gray over here.""


Great. Now it was about me.


""Fine. I'll come.""


...


By the time I dragged myself over, everyone was already there.


I could hear Mabel gushing about Brielle. How smart she was. How sweet. What a wonderful wife she'd make.


I stepped inside. The room went quiet.


I froze. Then it hit me.


Mabel used to say that stuff about me.


My mom coughed awkwardly. ""There you are. Come meet Brielle. Grayson's girlfriend.""


Before I could say anything, Brielle spoke up.


""Oh, we've actually met. The night Grayson and I got together.""


She smiled. ""Ava showed up straight from the airport with her suitcase. You two must be really close.""


Bringing that up felt like she'd torn off a scab I'd barely grown.


My chest tightened. But it didn't that hurt like before.


...


Once the parents left, Brielle dropped the act.


""You still hung up on him? That's... kinda sad. But hey, I get it.""


She stepped closer, voice sugar-sweet. ""Whatever you two had before—it's cute. But let's be real. You never stood a chance.""


""We're getting married in three months. You're welcome to come.""


So they're married.


I used to think about marrying him.


Asked him once what kind of wedding he wanted.


He didn't even look up. ""We're not even close to that. Why bring it up?""


Tried asking in bed once. He just fucked me harder. Never answered.


He never answered.


But that was an answer, wasn't it?


I was still thinking when Brielle's voice cut through.


""Babe, I think Malt's hungry. Can we go check on him?""


She pouted. ""I don't remember if I filled his bowl before we left...""


That was an hour and a half round trip.


I remembered when I forgot a file once. Called Grayson and asked him to drop it off.


Ten-minute drive. He shut me down immediately.


""Can you get your shit together? I'm not your delivery guy. I need a break too.""


But now?


Grayson was already grabbing his jacket. ""Get dressed. We'll leave now.""


And just like that, I got it.


The difference between love and nothing was that obvious.


He was short with me because he never loved me.


I was never his girlfriend. I was just... available. A safe fuck he didn't have to work for.

A would with only ESTJs: Pretty much the same as our world now but the ESTJs would be more blunt and robotic because there is no damn Feelers policing everything. They would mostly do work, since they have Ne. They would occasionally find creative works to do work or insult or fight each other with catchy Ne one liners. 

Everyone would tell each other to go to work and get mad at each other even though they tell others to go to work and then beat each other up. But, do it, when it’s not work hours of course.  


A world with only INFJs: Basically everyone would speak like poets; instead of someone saying, “I’m gonna get some coffee” to fit in or for people to understand. They would say, “I must venture out for subsistence to replenish myself and bring joy” and without the Thinkers or Sensors around, they would barely do anything because they would try to find double meaning in everything or try to find a secret meaning in a coffee cup instead of drinking or going to work. They would have great ideas, but since they are trying to find meaning towards everything or analyze each person they see. They would be too busy doing that. 

Also you wouldn’t need a degree to be a therapist or get paid. You would just do that originally. 


A world with only ESTPs: The world would be like a kick ass action movie. Things would be crazy. Everyone would throw wild pranks at each other, do extreme stunts everywhere. Dare each other to break the speed limit. People would instead of saying, “Excuse me”, they would say “Hey, mind if I scoot in there”. 

Also like the ISTP world; people would go to work for fun and go inside and leave whenever they please. Still no time schedule (I feel like that would apply for most worlds with only P types anyways) 


A world with only ISFJs: People would be neat as hell. Everyone would hold a Community clean up day and clean everything. Plant flowers every where in the neighborhood and write little notes to each other. Risks would be rare though with someone putting mustard in their toast be considered the most risk. Aside from cleaning up, people would mostly stay home with their cats. 

Everyone would come to work exactly on time and most jobs would be pro bono or free because the money would be nothing without the friendships and cleanliness. I guess. And every one would take a shower every single day. 


A world with only ENTPs: If the ESTP world is more like an action movie, then the ENTP world would be more like satire film/show. Flashy commercials and billboards, and advertisement industry would change, people would have no script and instead of saying, “Buy this because of (something)” they would say, “Buy this or don’t. We will still get paid money and shit. Buttttttttt (actually says something interesting that will make you want to buy it no matter what they say)”    

There would be more wacky half done inventions, and they would atleast experiment more and itself try to build a flying car or try to find a way to colonize Mars or something. 

People would openly troll each other. And work would just be, making shit and brainstorming ideas and having a good time 24/7 and seeing which shit would be a good idea or a stupid idea. You don’t even need corporate, just figure it out your damn selves like grown ass man. Period  

The world would probably accidentally explode like a few times but it would be totally worth it. We would be playing with dynamite or grenadines more like catch and see who can grab it.

Life is filled with ups and downs, and how we respond to these challenges shapes our journey. Whether grappling with professional setbacks, personal losses, or the pressures of daily life, maintaining a positive mindset is key. Here are several strategies to help you stay motivated even in the most challenging circumstances.

https://preview.redd.it/0ijsei50cgbg1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d149ada1a312aceee5bce9477de66cc7c228cf1b



Embrace a Positive Mindset



The first step to maintaining motivation is to cultivate a positive mindset. This doesn’t mean ignoring difficulties or putting on a happy face; rather, it involves shifting your perspective to focus on potential opportunities in every challenge. By consciously choosing to view obstacles as chances for growth, you empower yourself to take proactive steps rather than become stagnant in frustration.



Set Small, Achievable Goals



In tough times, large goals can feel insurmountable. Breaking them down into smaller, manageable tasks can create a clear path forward. Setting small, achievable goals allows you to celebrate milestones along the way, keeping your motivation high. Each time you accomplish a small task, no matter how trivial it may seem, you reinforce your sense of purpose and capability, driving you further toward your ultimate goal.



Create a Routine



Establishing a daily routine can provide a comforting structure amid chaos. Routines help to anchor your day, instilling a sense of normalcy. Whether it’s your morning coffee ritual, scheduled exercise, or designated work hours, having a structured plan allows you to focus your energy productively. Consistency breeds motivation, helping you navigate tough times with more ease.



Surround Yourself with Positivity



The people around you can significantly impact your motivation levels. Surround yourself with positive influences and uplifting individuals who inspire and support you. Engage in conversations that energize you; create an environment where encouragement is abundant. Conversely, try to limit time spent with negative influences, as they can drain your motivation and shift your focus away from your goals.



Practice Self-Care



Taking care of yourself is vital for maintaining motivation during difficulties. This means investing time in activities that rejuvenate you, whether it’s exercising, reading, meditating, or simply spending time in nature. Prioritizing self-care fosters physical and emotional well-being, making it easier to handle stressors. The more revitalized and balanced you feel, the better equipped you’ll be to tackle challenges.



Stay Connected



Isolation can exacerbate feelings of helplessness and demotivation. Make an effort to stay connected with friends, family, or support groups. Sharing your thoughts and feelings can provide new perspectives and remind you that you are not alone in facing challenges. Additionally, networking with others going through similar situations can foster a sense of solidarity and mutual support.



Focus on What You Can Control



In tough times, it’s easy to become overwhelmed by circumstances beyond your control. Redirect your energy toward what you can influence, whether it’s your response to a situation or the steps you take to improve your current reality. By concentrating on actionable items, you gain a sense of agency and empowerment, making it easier to sustain motivation.



Cultivate Gratitude



Practicing gratitude is a powerful tool for maintaining motivation. Spend a few moments each day reflecting on things you are grateful for, even in difficult times. This practice shifts your focus from what’s lacking to what’s present, creating a more positive outlook. A gratitude journal can serve as a helpful reminder of the good things in your life, further inspiring you on your journey.



Keep Learning and Growing



Embrace new challenges as opportunities for personal growth. Whether it’s picking up a new skill, exploring a hobby, or engaging in courses, the pursuit of knowledge can reignite your passion and motivation. Learning fosters curiosity and excitement, breaking the monotony of tough times and encouraging you to move forward.



Visualize Your Success



Visualization is a powerful motivating tool. Take time to imagine your goals and the steps necessary to achieve them. Creating a vision board, filled with images and words that inspire you, can serve as a daily reminder of your aspirations. Visualization not only clarifies your objectives but also inspires you to take action toward turning them into reality.



Conclusion



Staying motivated in tough times is not always easy, but by implementing these strategies, you can cultivate a positive and resilient mindset. Embrace the journey, focus on small steps, and surround yourself with positivity. Life’s challenges may test you, but they also offer opportunities for growth and fulfillment. By maintaining your motivation, you will emerge stronger and more prepared for whatever lies ahead.

Pilot Cold Open + Brunch Scene (Short)



NOTE: Carrie is a trans woman in this version. Same friendship engine. New era.



\------------------------------------------------------------



EXT. MANHATTAN - MORNING



Fast cuts: a woman filming a “soft life” video with puffy eyes; a couple negotiating exclusivity through emoji reactions; a rainbow pin next to a corporate ID; a man posting “protecting my peace” while ghosting; a protest flyer half-torn on a lamppost; a “BE YOUR OWN BRAND” billboard looming over the sidewalk.



CARRIE (V.O.)

In 1998, we thought dating was about chemistry.

In 2026, it’s also about power—

who gets comfort, who does labor, and who gets called “too much” for wanting basic respect.



Carrie walks, purposeful, scarf tucked in, phone in hand. A notification pops up: Seen 2:11 AM.



CARRIE (V.O.)

Everyone’s healing. Everyone’s setting boundaries. Everyone’s “doing the work.”

And still, somehow, women are the ones doing customer service.



Carrie passes the billboard: BE YOUR OWN BRAND.



CARRIE (V.O.)

I couldn’t help but wonder…

when did love start feeling like an algorithm—

and home start feeling like a workplace?



CUT TO:



\------------------------------------------------------------



INT. BRUNCH SPOT - DAY



A chic downtown place. Loud, glossy, expensive. The kind of restaurant where everyone looks like they have a personal trainer and a therapist.



CARRIE slides into the booth with MIRANDA, CHARLOTTE, and SAMANTHA.



CARRIE

Sorry. My phone asked me to verify I’m human before it would let me order coffee.



MIRANDA

That’s more screening than most men do before they ask for access.



SAMANTHA (wearing sunglasses indoors)

If a man asks me to verify I’m human, I send him my Venmo.



CHARLOTTE

Can we please have one brunch without Venmo?



Carrie smiles, but she’s tense. Miranda clocks it immediately.



MIRANDA

Okay. Something’s up.



CARRIE

Is my face doing the thing?



SAMANTHA

Your face is doing the “I’m pretending I’m fine because I don’t want a lecture” thing.



CHARLOTTE

Samantha.



SAMANTHA

What? That’s a real face.



Carrie exhales. She hates that they’re right.



CARRIE

He talked to me like he was my dad this morning.



Charlotte’s eyes widen with instant concern.



CHARLOTTE

Oh, honey—



MIRANDA (calm, clinical)

Define “dad.”



CARRIE

The tone. The verdict tone.

Not “Can you help?”

More like… “This is unacceptable.”



SAMANTHA lowers her sunglasses a fraction.

SAMANTHA

Unacceptable.

Nothing says romance like a performance review.



CARRIE

It was the remote.



MIRANDA

The remote remote?



CARRIE

The remote remote.



Charlotte looks confused, then horrified on Carrie’s behalf.



CHARLOTTE

Why would that be unacceptable?



CARRIE (trying to laugh it off)

Because apparently I’m the Department of Finding Things.

And I did find it. Immediately. Because—

(beat)

because I’m trying to avoid a whole… situation.



MIRANDA

So you complied.



CARRIE

I complied.



SAMANTHA

Strategic compliance is real. Sometimes you pick your battles.

Feminism does not require a morning press conference.



CARRIE (dry)

Thank you, General Samantha.



Carrie stirs her coffee too hard.



CARRIE

It’s not that I think I’m above doing things.

I don’t mind helping. I don’t mind contributing.

What I mind is being spoken to like I’m… staff.

Like I’m lucky to be there.



MIRANDA nods, like she’s heard this in a courtroom and a kitchen.



MIRANDA

It’s not the task. It’s the hierarchy.



CARRIE

Exactly.

And it hits harder because—

(chooses words carefully)

He pays the bills. He drives. He handles the “big” things.

And I’m already carrying this shame like… I’m a dependent.



Charlotte reaches out, gentle.



CHARLOTTE

You’re not a dependent. You’re his wife.



SAMANTHA

Provision is not ownership.



MIRANDA

And “I pay for things” is not a license to parent you.



CARRIE (V.O.)

Miranda always had a way of saying something that felt like a hug—

if hugs came with footnotes and legal precedent.



Carrie’s voice gets sharper, more honest.



CARRIE

When someone talks to you like that—

it’s not just disrespect.

It turns your body into an object.

And as a trans woman, I’m already fighting that everywhere else.



Charlotte nods, understanding. Samantha’s expression turns serious.



CARRIE

Online, it’s like:

People don’t talk to me like I’m a person.

They talk to me like I’m a category.

A debate.

A fetish.

Or a punchline.



SAMANTHA

And at home you deserve the opposite.

Home is where you get to stop performing.



MIRANDA

Home is where your humanity should be non-negotiable.



Carrie swallows. She’s not crying. She’s holding it together—barely.



CARRIE

And the worst part is… the “dad tone” works.

It’s effective.

It makes me move.

It makes me small.

And part of me feels safer because someone else is steering.

And then I hate it because safety shouldn’t require me to shrink.



A beat. Charlotte looks pained. Samantha looks furious. Miranda looks steady.



MIRANDA

Safety that costs dignity is a bad deal.



CHARLOTTE

What about the garbage? You mentioned you were sick.



CARRIE (quickly)

Yeah. I was sick. It was New Year’s. I thought maybe pickup wouldn’t happen.

Which is… a normal assumption.

But in a “dad tone” household, everything becomes moral.

The garbage becomes character.



SAMANTHA

Right. It’s not “you didn’t do a thing.”

It’s “you failed the role.”



MIRANDA

And then if you react, you get labeled:

too sensitive, too emotional, unstable—

which is convenient because it turns your boundary into a symptom.



SAMANTHA (with venom)

I love a man who tells you you’re “dysregulated”

because you asked him to speak respectfully.



CHARLOTTE

Do men actually say that?



All three look at Charlotte.



MIRANDA

Charlotte.



SAMANTHA

Sweetie.



CARRIE (soft)

They do.



Carrie sits up straighter. A decision, not a confession.



CARRIE

I’m not doing a big confrontation.

I don’t have the energy for a TED Talk.

I need a single sentence.

Something I can say without apologizing for existing.



MIRANDA

Good.

One sentence. No over-explaining. No debating.



SAMANTHA

A boundary is a sentence, not a dissertation.



CHARLOTTE

Okay, what’s the sentence?



Carrie thinks, then tries it on like lipstick.



CARRIE

“I’ll help—but don’t speak to me like I’m your child.”



Miranda nods. Samantha approves. Charlotte looks relieved.



MIRANDA

Perfect. Clean. Adult.



SAMANTHA

And if he argues, repeat it once and disengage.

You’re not litigating your humanity.



CHARLOTTE

And if he loves you, he’ll adjust.



MIRANDA

If he loves you, he won’t need a committee meeting to learn respect.



Carrie smiles. It’s small, but it’s real.



CARRIE (V.O.)

In 1998, we asked if women could have sex like men.

In 2026, we ask something else:

Can women be full humans—

sick, stressed, dependent, complicated—

without being talked to like they’re lucky to be here?



Samantha raises her glass.



SAMANTHA

To adult-to-adult love.



Charlotte raises hers.



CHARLOTTE

To care without control.



Miranda raises hers.



MIRANDA

To dignity that isn’t earned.



Carrie raises hers last.



CARRIE

And to the radical idea…

that partnership shouldn’t require permission.



They clink glasses.



CARRIE (V.O.)

I couldn’t help but wonder…

maybe men and women really do live in the same zip code.

But in 2026, the real question is—

who gets to be a person inside the relationship?



CUT TO BLACK.

I almost can't believe it's been a month since I moved in. This damned house is driving me insane. I'm now hyper-aware of every creak, every moan, every bump. Nothing has happened as dramatic as what I saw with the shower, but if anything, this silence is worse. I'm always expecting to hear something or someone, to see something out the corner of my eye. It's worse at night. No matter how many lights I turn on, there always seems to be shadows watching me from every corner of the room. I feel eyes on me, and I wonder how many eyes there are, and who they belong to.

I've finally decided to take my sister's advice, for lack of anything else to do. I haven't gone all out and hired a spirit guide or anything. But, I picked up some incense at a local shop downtown. I had no idea what to buy, but I saw a few names of plants I recognized, and went from there. It's nice, actually, having a house that smells like jasmine instead of dust. I suppose you could say it's working, since I've started burning sage the spirits have been quiet. Maybe they really are pacified. . . maybe it was all just my imagination. . . maybe I'm losing my mind.

I started my new job last week. It's nothing exciting, just an IT help desk I work from home. There's not much else in a small town like this, everyone pretty much either works form home or commutes. I'm also going out more, getting to know the area, and making new friends. The town is really nice, the people are friendly, the roads are quiet. I'm glad I moved out of the city, I never knew how much I needed the fresh air. All in all, it's not a bad life. Sometimes I even forget about my spooky little haunted house, until it inevitably comes up in conversation.

I was getting coffee with a friend. They asked how I was enjoying the town. I told them all about how I loved it, but they could hear the uncertainty in my voice. I told them I was living in that old house over on maple street, you know the one. Yes, of course they knew the one. They were shocked. They started probing me for questions relentlessly. I just answered honestly, said the house was a little quirky, but nothing too scary. But again, they could sense I was holding something back. So, I told them about the writing on the shower door. It was as if I told them I found a body in the closet. I tried to reassure them, after all, It could have just been a dream for all I know. They weren't convinced, of course. And just like that, my apprehensions were back.

I did some more digging, but there wasn't much to find. There weren't any murders in the house, no portal to hell opening or a madman disposing of his victims under the floor boards. In fact, there wasn't anything odd reported in the house until about 11 years ago. One day, there was just a sudden change In the atmosphere. There were whispers, footsteps, things were moved when no one was there. The oddest thing was people claiming that food was going missing from the house. It was subtle enough that they didn't notice most of the time, but every so often, the pantry just felt a bit too empty.

I wondered If the same was happening to me. So, I decided to experiment. I kept a close watch over how much food was In the house, and how much I was eating. Sure enough, some of it went missing. . . but then, It didn't. Some food would go missing for a time, then it wouldn't, and oddest of all, I could swear there was new food being added in without me buying it. I was food that I had usually bought in the past, but there was just a bit more than I remember buying. It got to the point that I had to check my receipts just to be sure. It wasn't very much, but the discrepancy was certainly there.

I had never heard of this kind of phenomenon in any sort of haunting. All my research - and there was quite a bit of it - seems to show nothing like it in any paranormal reports. I asked my sister, but she didn't have any answers either, despite seeming to always have an answer to everything. Even stranger still, my neighbors are now telling me that they've noticed food going missing too. Again, it's a very subtle amount, but it's definitely been happening. I've been trying to wrap my head around it, but the conclusion I've reached is much more troubling than a ghost.

Maybe this a matter of who, not what.

New year, first Project Pan!

I’ve always joked that I’m the lady version of Ghibli/Diana Wayne Jones’ Howl with my love of beauty and self care things, but this past year I’m kind of shocked by how the collection has spiraled.

Part of this was I think from a chaotic “vacation mode” mentality that my previous year held; and part of it from the fact I’m usually pretty thrifty with consumption so 2025’s purchasing spree caught me off guard.   
  
This is why there’s not a ton of super old products (thankfully, I’d thought it was much worse off), I usually only buy more after I run out of a given scent and rotate things seasonally.

My aim is to actually give myself permission to use what I’ve got instead of making it stretch to the point of a crazy pile up like this and have fun doing it!

(Some have names in the notes, that’s bc friends have claimed some and I forgot to update the list lol)

(Hope a list only post like this is allowed to start a project with, my collection is kinda scattered about so I didn’t feel like trying to dig it all up for a pic, but empties will get actual photos.)",1,1767584018.0,ProjectPan,0,1.0,False

Im not sure what to think of my marriage. 41/f he is 48. We have an 11 year old son together, and I have 16 and 17 year old daughters from a previous marriage. From the start, when I first met my husband he was low effort with everything, he didnt pursue me, I pursued and called him. He was between homes because he was on his way up to Alaska to go gold panning but needed some money so he was trying to get a part time job. We started dating and he was just really easy going and kind, which drew me in. But he also has a passive aggressive a-hole side to him.

I thought he really cared about me, but he ended up going to Alaska anyways. He didnt really bother to call me. I felt like he was doing to me what he was doing to his ex. When we first met he was still dating his ex and he was trying to get with me, I told him no, he needed to break up with her first, but despite him saying he didnt like her he dragged his feet. Which I should've seen as a sign. While he was up in Alaska his room mate kicked him out because I guess he was paying his rent with gold instead of cash, she he ended up sleeping in an outhouse and then at a hostel. 

This was all back in 2011. He moved back down to be with me, but I think it was because I was begging him to. I was addicted to his attention and his kindness. But he was also a flirt. When we first started dating I found Facebook messages (he didnt log out on my laptop)  between him and a few other women that were flirty, and he told me they were like sisters to him. 

He always had an excuse for his flirty behavior. And he would watch porn and lie about it, we had agreed we didnt want it in our relationship. But still, he has always been a kind and selfless person. But his flaws are he doesn't seem to care about anything including paying bills, he is passive aggressive, and he has a temper sometimes. I saw him kick our cat once and he saw that I saw him and he laughed and said ""you thought I kicked the cat? 😆 "". And he has been borderline abusive to my girls by yelling at them, and one time last winter my daughter tossed snow at her brother and my husband got mad and grabbed snow and rubbed it in her face, she tried to get away and he grabbed her arm. He denied all of this and said he ""gently tossed snow at her"" and said she was lying, she was really worked up and hyperventilating. 

There have been some incidents like that. And then also the lapses in judgement, like when he took our son at 5 in the morning to go look at stars and my girls woke up and they were gone and he didnt leave a note, and since he is never near his phone he wasn't answering. My girls called me at work, but I was finally able to get ahold of him and he was mad because they are old enough to be by themselves. Not the point.

And there was an incident with his 19 year old coworker, I had just had our son and I found deleted texts on his phone, I could only retrieve the first 3 or 4 words from each. But he said something about having to go shower at work. They worked night security at a data center, so it was just the 2 of them usually in a big building with limited cameras. There ended up being an investigation done on them because some people were saying things about them, but my husband couldn't remember. But the results were sent to our house, it said they disappeared off camera for several hours, he denied this and said they were in the break room, but there are cameras over there. The last text he sent her he said ""i will miss you... all"" because he was fired. He said it was innocent. I said ""what would you think if I sent that to someone?"" He said ""i wouldn't care"", he honestly probably wouldn't. Anyways, he was 36 and she was 19. He swears on our son that nothing happened. A few women came forward and told the boss that he made them uncomfortable. He was giving them massages in a room, because he had a massage license.

So that was the 1st big thing, and then the 2nd big thing which is more recent, was that he quit his job of 10 years without telling me. So about 2 weeks before it happened he tried to aggressively get me on board with him quitting his job to go gold panning full time (he has been panning for 20 years, and so far he has only found a few hundred dollars worth of gold), he was getting really upset that I wasn't enthusiastically on board, he said we have been living my dream, so its time to live his dream and it will be fine because he will pull out his 401k and we can live off of that, and then when it starts to run out he would go back to work, he promised. So at first I agreed because I felt bad. And then after a while I changed my mind and said we should compromise, he can pan on tbe weekends to see if he could replace his job with it, he said he easily could, he said he could make over 50 grand a year doing it.

So, we agreed with the weekend situation. But a week later he comes to me to tell me Thursday would be his last day, and he also admitted he had already put in his notice weeks before our previous conversation, he was just trying to get me on board so it would be smoother. He said he knew it could be the final straw that would make me leave him but he didnt care, he said ""i knew it would either make us or break us but I didnt care"", he also knew that if I left he wouldn't see his son as much, but he said he didnt care. 

So he quit his job, I almost left him but he swore he would go to marriage counseling and also personal counseling (he went to 1 appointment and didnt like it.). He said he had the opportunity to change his mind and tell hr to retract his notice but he never did. He never found gold during those 4 months, and then money was dwindling and he was not finding work, he admitted he was dragging his feet because he didnt want to work for anyone because all jobs were thr same, all bosses were a-holes. 

Luckily his job was willing to take him back eventually. But now we have fallen behind on our mortgage and some bills are not being paid. We are working with a financial advisor that i hired to help us. He honestly couldnt care less, he is oblivious to our financial condition. I feel like even though he is kind and thoughtful most of the time, he just doesn't care if i stay or go and he doesn't see that im no longer in love with me, he doesn't see it because I am still nice to him like a friend. 

Our kids dont know about all of this conflict. If we were violent or really toxic I would be gone, but I stay for our son and because my husband still displays selfless behavior every day and goes out of his way for us, he cooks and makes me coffee, he does a lot of the running around. I feel dependent on him. Luckily I have a really good paying job, so if things were worse I could leave. 

I just feel stuck. Do I just try to forgive all of this and get past it, even though it physically hurts to be hugged and loved by him? He had said very hurtful things, but i feel addicted to his daily kindness and that's what keeps me around.

Sorry this is so long, and I probably come across as a nagging awful wife.


tl;dr:  married with a son, husband has betrayed me several times, not physically that I know of, married 12 years. He doesn't care about much of anything, but is usually nice and happy.

**Part One: Analysis of Danny De Hek’s Video on the Opteq Wallet & Qoin Migration**

This post looks at a recent video by Danny De Hek, who describes himself as a *Crypto Ponzi Scheme Avenger*, in which he investigates the new Opteq Wallet and the Qoin migration.

To be upfront, I had never heard of Danny De Hek before this, so I did some background digging. He presents himself as an independent New Zealand (no judgement there - we love kiwis) journalist focused on exposing crypto scams — an admirable goal on the surface. However, after watching his video, I’m not convinced his approach here is as rigorous or objective as he might believe. That said, let’s focus on the content rather than personalities.

The first thing that stood out was the presentation itself. De Hek appears to be reading from a prepared script that he repeatedly trips and stumbles over throughout the entire presentation. He doesn’t seem particularly familiar with the material he’s presenting, which raises serious questions about how deeply he even understands the topic. 

At the time of writing, the video has just 79 views. For comparison (and a bit of humour), a video of me being filmed without my knowledge farting at a café 2 years ago managed 25,000 views on You Tube in seven days. You can draw your own conclusions. Real incident, but jokes aside, let’s get serious.

In the video, De Hek raises the following questions:

1. Who controls the system now?
2. Is the migration necessary?
3. What if something goes wrong?
4. Is this a scam or a genuine wallet?

Rather than forcing anyone to sit through 25 minutes of a rambling breakdown, here are the answers below. Why De Hek didn't provide these answers, only he will know : 

**1. Who controls the system now?**  
The Qoin Foundation.

**2. Is the migration necessary?**  
Yes. Qoin has migrated from its original blockchain to the Base blockchain, which is widely regarded as one of the safest, most reputable, fastest, and lowest-cost blockchains available. This represents the most significant upgrade to the Qoin ecosystem to date

**3. What if something goes wrong?**  
Users can contact the Qoin Foundation directly at: [**contact@qoin.com**]()

**4. Is this a scam or a genuine wallet?**  
Qoin has already undergone a two-year ASIC audit and investigation, along with two high-profile Australian Federal Court cases. These processes determined that Qoin was *not* a scam. While some technical issues and statements were criticised, regulators did not shut the project down or prevent it from trading. Instead, they recommended changes to ensure ongoing compliance — many of which have already been implemented.

Given that regulators and courts with far greater authority than a YouTube commentator have already addressed this question, it’s unclear why De Hek feels the need to re-litigate it. That naturally raises the question: what is he actually trying to achieve?

One particularly odd omission is that De Hek doesn’t mention the **Qoin Foundation** at all in his video, despite its central role in governance and communication. This absence is strange, especially considering that Qoin users have received multiple official communications from the Foundation. Was this left out deliberately to create uncertainty or fear? It’s hard not to wonder.

Another major issue is that De Hek fails to mention the four other wallets available to users who don’t wish to use the Opteq Wallet. These include **Coinbase, Kraken, MetaMask, and Rainbow** — some of the most recognised wallets in the crypto space, with a combined user base of over 150 million users globally. If the Opteq Wallet is supposedly problematic, why not present these alternatives?

The most confusing moment comes when De Hek promotes his own crypto investigation services, offering to investigate projects for **$300 cash**, while also encouraging viewers to “buy him a coffee” through a donation app. That raises an obvious question: if Qoin hasn’t sold Qoin for years, the Opteq Wallet can’t sell Qoin, and the Qoin Foundation isn’t offering investment packages — what *exactly* is the scam he’s protecting people from? The only clear cash transaction on offer appears to be paying *him*.

Based on that, I’ll be keeping my money, and I’d politely suggest that whoever paid for this particular investigation might consider asking for their money back.

To be clear, this isn’t a blanket criticism of all of De Hek’s work. He has genuinely exposed real global scams that have cost innocent people millions, and that deserves recognition.

However, in this case, I strongly disagree with both his analysis and his presentation of the Opteq Wallet and the Qoin migration and suggest that people complete their own thorough analysis.  ",1,1767583630.0,Qoin2025,0,1.0,False

By day, I live in a very put-together and professional world. Outside of that, I lean more expressive, curious, and much less restrained. Style has always been part of how I communicate. In and out of the office. It’s important to me that I look put together! I’d say I lean to a timeless, classic but feminine look…though I love to push boundaries.

I’m faceless by choice. I like keeping some things to myself and letting the vibes do the work.

I love animals and donate to multiple rescues; horses, farm animals, dogs and cats. It’s something I’m very passionate about.

When I’m not working, you’ll usually find me hiking, cooking, hosting friends, chasing good coffee (Seven Brew is my fav), ordering espresso martinis from my favorite spot, scouting a menu for shrimp cocktail and arguing that cheesesteaks should only come from Philly!

I’m a plant mom and love to garden in the summer! I prefer a wide, open, green space to explore over the towering steel of the city….but I do love pretending to be a city girl and spend the occasional weekend in a nearby east coast city with my husband.

In 2026 I’d like to get back into reading and doing more expressive things… hopefully to post here and show you all! Stick around and see what 2026 brings for me🍑💋

At home I already use a Lagom P80, so this hand grinder is only for when I leave the house and brew for friends/family.

Current grinder: Kinu M47 Phoenix  
Brewers: OXO Rapid Brewer (soup), V60 v3 large output recipe  
Roast: light to light-medium  
Goal: clean, sweet, approachable filter coffee (good clarity, not thin)

I’m deciding between:

* Comandante C40 (possibly Lab burr variants)
* Timemore M01

Main questions:

* Compared to Kinu, does C40 give noticeably cleaner / clearer cups for pourover?
* How does M01 compare in clarity, body, and overall forgiveness?
* Any meaningful differences in fines, texture, or astringency?
* For filter-only use, is stock C40 adjustment enough? Is Red Clix unnecessary?

If I go with C40, are any upgrades actually worth it for travel use?

* Red Clix
* Magnetic catch cup
* External adjustment ring
* Handle/knob upgrades

Would stepping up to the Comandante C60 be *overkill* for a travel / brew-for-others grinder, or does it offer a meaningful improvement over the C40 in this context?

1q4alv4,https://i.redd.it/rexc9to19gbg1.jpeg,I’m A Private Investigator Hired To Follow The Hat Man,"**_Part 1_**

The coffee at the Golden Spoon tastes like they boiled an old shoe. I'm staring at a slab of meatloof that's the color of a week old bruise. I push it around my plate with a fork. I take a glimpse outside. The city drizzle smears the neon lights into a watercolor painting of a bad decision. My name is Christopher Hall. In another life I probably would've been a character in a book somebody like me would've read. Now I'm just a guy with a gun, a PI license, and a knee that aches when it's about to rain.

Marge the waitress, who's been serving me coffee since I was still on the force, shuffles over and tops me off. ""You look like hell, Chris.""

""Feel like I live there, Marge. Just payin' rent."" I force a smile that her eyes don’t see. ""Getting too old for this. Thought I left chasing shadows behind when I got the boot. Turns out, they just have better hours on the more private side of things.""

She gives me that look. The one that says *I've heard it all before, honey*. She's not wrong. This morning's job was tailing a cheating accountant who thought his mistress's condo was a secret. He practically waved at me from the freeway. Easy money. Soul crushing for sure, but easy.

The real fun started yesterday. A woman named Ellen Reid hired me. All pearls and quiet desperation. Her kid Leo wasn't sleeping. He was having nightmares about a ""Hat Man."" I nodded along filing it under ""rich people problems,"" and took her hefty retainer. My theory? Some creep in a costume getting his kicks. Find the guy, snap a photo, let the cops handle it. Case closed.

Now, I'm parked across the street from her perfect little colonial house watching the perfect little suburban street in its darkness. The only sound is the swishes of my wipers and the faint static of the police scanner I keep on for background noise. 10:47 PM. My log for the night reads: *""Subject residence quiet. No signs of ghouls, goblins, or other things that go bump in the night. Client likely needs a therapist not a P.I. Going home in an hour.""*

I'm just about to kill the engine when I see him.

He doesn't walk out from behind a tree. He separates from the shadow of the trees. Like the darkness itself decided to stand up. He's tall. Too tall. I grimace from what he's wearing. A long coat that hangs straight down not moving in the damp breeze. A fucking pervert I thought. On his head is the silhouette of a top hat. A goddamn top hat. In this neighborhood.

My next thought is annoyance. *Great. A prankster.* I grab my DSLR ready to get a crystal clear shot of this joker's face and end this nonsense tonight.

But he doesn't head for the front door. He glides across the lawn and stops right under a second story window. The kid's window per what the mother told me about their house layout.

And then he starts to climb.

No ladder. No drainpipe. He just puts his hands and feet on the brick siding and starts to scuttle up it like a goddamn spider. The movement is fluid and unnatural. A cold knot forms in my gut. A feeling I haven't had since I saw a grenade go the wrong way in Kandahar. I drop the camera into my lap and fumble for my voice recorder. My thumb fumbled the record button.

""This is Hall,"" I whispered. My breath fogged the window. ""I have a visual on the suspect. Male, tall, dark coat... Jesus Christ. He's climbing the goddamn wall.""

He reaches the window ledge. He doesn't try to open it. He places a flat hand against the glass pane. For a second the window looks like it's made of water. It rippled and distorted the light from the kid's nightlight inside. Then, without a sound, the Hat Man just steps through. Like the glass wasn't even there.

I sit there while my heart tried to beat its way out of my chest. The part of my brain that’s cynic, a cop, a realist, is screaming for an explanation. A projector or a hologram. This was some kind of goddamn ninja magic I've never heard of. But the part of me that's just an animal that hides in a metal box on a dark street knows what I saw. It was impossible.

I pick up my notepad. My hands shook just enough to make my scrawl look even more like a doctor's signature.

*23:14 hrs. Suspect entered the premises. Not through a door. Through the fucking window. This isn't a creep. This is something else.*

I stare at that sentence. *Something else.* That's not a conclusion. That's a surrender. The cop in me, the part that got discharged for excessive force because I never knew when to quit, screams at me. You don't let the perp get away. You don't sit in the car while he's inside. You act.

My hand is on the door handle before I've even made the decision. The cold night air hits me like a slap as I get out. I left the engine running. I cross the street staying in the shadows of the opposite lawns. The Reid house is silent. I'm under the window now looking up. Nothing. Just the dark glass of Leo's room capturing the night light.

I can't let this stand. I put my foot on the first brick. It's too slick. I try to get a grip. My fingers searching for a hold in the mortar. It's useless. The brick might as well be coated in oil. My foot slips and scrapes down the wall taking a chunk of mortar with it. I land hard on my ass in the damp grass.

For a second I just lie there staring up at the starless sky. I feel like a fool. An old washed up fool trying to fight a ghost with bare hands. A surge of pure hot rage hits me. I scramble to my feet and kick the base of the wall. ""Goddamn it!"" I shouted through gritted teeth into the night. The house doesn't care. The neighborhood doesn't care.

I defeatedly limp back to my car. My pride was  more bruised than my tailbone. I sink into the driver's seat. There's nothing to do now but wait. He'll have to come out sometime. I'll be here when he does.

I prop my head against the cold glass of the window. My eyes fixed on that second story opening. I'll just rest them for a minute. Just one minute.

The next thing I know the car is filled with a blinding light and a sound like a hundred tiny bells. Sunlight. I jerk awake my neck screaming in protest. I glance at the dash. 7:18 AM. I slept for eight hours. My head pounds and my mouth tastes like an ashtray. I frantically scan the house. The window is just a window. No sign of the Hat Man.

Out on the street a couple of kids on brightly colored bikes are racing each other. Their laughter echoing in the morning air. They look so normal. So untouched by the darkness that crept into their neighborhood last night. One of them, a little girl with pigtails, looks right at me. She then looks back at her friend and they pedal away giggling. They have no idea.

I start the car. The diner. I need coffee and food. As I pull away from the curb I dig my flip phone out of my pocket. I thumb through the contacts until I find ""Reid, Ellen."" It rings twice.

""Mr. Hall?"" Her voice sounded hopeful.

""Mrs. Reid,"" I tiredly sighed. ""It's Chris Hall.""

""Did you see him? Did you find anything?""

I hesitate picturing the shadow climbing the wall. The window rippling like water. ""I saw something,"" I said choosing my words carefully. ""But I lost him. He's slippery. Look, I'm going to need another night. I'll try a different approach tomorrow.""

I can hear her deflate on the other end of the line. ""Oh. Okay. Tomorrow, then.""

""I'll be in touch."" I snap the phone shut and toss it onto the passenger seat. The lies always tasted the worst. I didn't lose him. He vanished. And I, Christopher Hall ex cop, ex soldier, now turned professional ghost chaser, fell asleep on the job. I drive towards the diner. Maybe a greasy spoon of reality will wash the impossible out of my mouth.",3,1767583431.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

Emily froze at the kitchen window, her coffee mug halfway to her lips. _
The porch light next door flickered like a bad omen on this chilly Toronto October night. _
She'd caught her dad, Robert, out there again—with Victoria. _
Laughing. _
Too close. _
His hand grazing hers in that ""accidental"" way that screamed anything but. _

Subtle sexual tension crackled through the air, even from here. _
Victoria, the high-flying corporate exec with her BMW parked like a trophy in the driveway. _
Their Scarborough neighborhood was full of folks like Emily's family—factory workers, part-time clerks, scraping by. _
But Victoria? _
She embodied the elite, the kind of success that made Robert's stagnant supervisor job feel like a trap. _

Emily's pulse quickened. _
Class disparity hit home hard tonight. _
Why did Dad keep crossing that fence? _
Jealousy twisted in her gut—not just over the affair she suspected, but the way he favored her brother Alex, the ""golden boy"" mechanic. _
She was the teacher, the fixer, always overlooked. _

Her mom, Patricia, shuffled in, still in her wrinkled uniform from the discount store. _
""Em, you're glued to that window again. _
What's eating you?"" _

Emily turned, forcing a tight smile. _
""Just... Dad's out there chatting with Victoria. _
Again. _
Doesn't it bug you, Mom? _
Her flashing all that wealth while we're pinching pennies?"" _

Patricia sighed, rubbing her temples. _
""Hon, he's probably just venting about work. _
Factory life's no picnic. _
Hand me the bread—dinner's Tim Hortons leftovers tonight."" _

But Emily couldn't let it go. _
She slipped out back, the crisp air nipping at her skin. _
The fence slats were splintered, easy to peer through. _
Robert's voice carried: ""Vic, you get it—climbing the ladder, leaving the grind behind. _
I envy that."" _

Victoria's laugh was low, inviting. _
""You could have more, Robert. _
My connections? _
They'd open doors for you."" _

Their silhouettes leaned in, a brush of shoulders that lingered too long. _
Emily's stomach churned. _
Paternal betrayal? _
It fit the pieces—late nights, evasive answers. _

Back inside, Alex sprawled on the couch, remote in hand, grease under his nails from the garage. _
""Yo, Sis, you look pissed. _
Spill."" _

She eyed him, sibling rivalry flaring. _
""Dad's out there with Victoria. _
It's not just talk, Alex. _
He's... different around her."" _

Alex snorted, popping a beer. _
""Paranoid much? _
Dad's a stand-up guy. _
Probably networking or whatever. _
Chill."" _

His blind loyalty grated—always the favorite, never questioning. _
Dinner was tense: pasta from a box, sauce from a jar. _
Robert avoided her gaze, phone vibrating in his pocket. _
Patricia picked at her food, silent. _

Upstairs later, Emily paced her room. _
She grabbed her laptop, typing furiously: ""signs of marital infidelity."" _
Results flooded in—emotional affairs, secret meetups, class envy fueling forbidden desires. _
It matched. _

Digging deeper, she remembered his jacket downstairs. _
Heart racing, she crept down, fishing through the pocket. _
A receipt: upscale cafe downtown, not his usual spot. _
Timestamped during ""overtime."" _
Scribbled note: ""Missed you already. V."" _

Proof. _
Her world spun. _
This wasn't just cheating—it was cross-class betrayal, Victoria exploiting Dad's upward mobility dreams. _
Jealousy surged; revenge flickered in her mind. _
Confront? _
Expose? _
Or play it smart? _

Midnight struck. _
The front door creaked. _
From her window, Emily watched Robert slip out, heading straight to Victoria's glowing porch. _
A hushed whisper, a shared laugh, then—his arm around her waist. _
No accident this time. _

Emily's fists clenched. _
This affair would destroy them all. _
But she wouldn't let it. _
Tomorrow, she'd start digging—for evidence, for leverage. _
The fences were fracturing, and the storm was just beginning. _
A gut-punch revelation waited, one that would redefine everything. _",1,1767583429.0,familydrama,1,1.0,False

Jin is also a sensory judge for the World Coffee Championship and the current title holder for the Malaysia Cup Taster Champion. In other words, he knows bloody good coffee and you should pop into any of his cafes for good bean recommendations. 

So what makes good coffee? 

According to Jin, it should be something simple and clean tasting. A good cup of brew will tell you where it was grown and how it was processed. All those infused and flavoured coffee beans you see trending? Sorry to say, they got something to hide in terms of quality. 

For someone who wears so many hats, you'll be surprised to know that the 2025 Malaysia Cup Taster Champion doesn't drink coffee every day.

I tried a sip of Sprite to see if it was because of the artificial sweetener but even Sprite tasted unpleasant. I also find it hard to decide what I want to eat when we eat out. Nothing really sounds good anymore until I get there, I’m hungry, and have the food in front of me. I still enjoy a cocktail occasionally even though I know I shouldn’t but 🤷🏽‍♀️. 

Winter break is over so I’ll be back to ballet this week. I’ve been missing it and trying to practice at home just isn’t the same. Happy New Year everyone 🎆",1,1767583230.0,HersWeightloss,2,1.0,False

1q4ahm8,https://open.substack.com/pub/davidrmann3/p/three-predictions-about-mocktails?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&utm_medium=web,Three Predictions About Mocktails in Restaurants: The Year Everything Changes,"**Three Predictions About Mocktails in Restaurants: The Year Everything Changes**

The mocktail isn’t a trend anymore. It’s a margin opportunity that most operators are still sleeping on.

Over the past four years, mocktails appeared on restaurant menus with rising frequency as consumer demand shifted toward alcohol-free alternatives. 44% of restaurants are actively expanding their mocktail menus to meet rising health-conscious demand. The global mocktail market was valued at $8.38 billion in 2025 and is expected to reach $16.02 billion by 2035, growing at 5.7%. Especially for Gen Z and Millennials, these numbers matter because they signal a shift in how diners see socializing, self-care, what they’re willing to pay for. If you run a restaurant or manage a bar, 2026 is the year you stop treating mocktails as an afterthought and start treating them as a portfolio business inside your beverage program. Here are the three predictions that will shape how you should think about mocktails this year.​

**Prediction One: Premium Pricing on Mocktails Will Stick, But Only If You Invest in Craft**

A third of Gen Z adults have purchased or made a mocktail in the past 30 days, compared to 18% of Millennials and under 10% of adults 45 and older.

The problem is that most restaurants treat mocktails like they’re easy. A splash of this, some sparkling water, a fruit garnish, and you’ve got a mocktail. That approach kills you on two fronts. First, you price it too low because the labor feels cheap. Second, you don’t deliver enough sensory complexity to justify the premium price your guests expect to pay.

Price mocktails at 80% of what you charge for a comparable cocktail, which is the winning move for 2026 if it makes margin sense. Justify that price through craft. Use house-made syrups. Source better fruit. Build layered flavor through fermentation, infusions, and bitters that most operators haven’t touched yet. Make each mocktail take as much time and skill to prepare as an alcoholic cocktail. Your guests, especially younger diners, will notice. They’ll order again. And your average check grows because they’re not trading down from a $15 cocktail to a $7 soda.

At Tupelo Honey Cafe in Asheville, North Carolina, the corporate beverage director launched house-made ginger beer and a non-alcoholic Bee’s Knees using Lyre’s Pink London Spirit. The results were that guests ordered mocktails because they perceived them as genuinely crafted, not as an obligation for non-drinkers. This is the playbook. Premium ingredients plus visible labor equals pricing power.​

Consider also that over 55% of consumers moderating their alcohol intake are looking for pre-mixed sober options. These drinkers aren’t price-sensitive in the traditional sense. They’re value-sensitive. They want to know that what they’re drinking is intentional, not a default.​

Fermented tea bases are emerging as the secret weapon for building adult-flavored mocktails without relying on heavy sweetness or artificial taste profiles. A long-aged fermented tea base, like kombucha, kefir, or a proprietary house ferment, gives you structure, organic acid, and subtle bitterness that mimics the mouthfeel of spirits. Layer in botanical bitters, citrus, and fresh herbs, and you’ve got something that feels like a real drink, not a juice compromise. The cost is negligible. The perception is everything.​

**Prediction Two: Functional Ingredients Will Become Your Competitive Moat**

Adaptogens, nootropics, fermented botanicals, and CBD are moving from wellness retail into mainstream restaurant culture. This isn’t wellness theater. It’s the next chapter of how younger diners make social choices.​

Among canned non-alcoholic cocktails tested in consumer research, CBD and mood-boost versions performed best in demand studies, with CBD additions increasing demand by 13% compared to standard formulations. That demand can translate to higher pricing and larger check sizes if your team is educated on the why behind the ingredients.​

For restaurants, the opportunity is straightforward but requires discipline. Build mocktails that feature functional ingredients as story elements, not gimmicks. If you add ashwagandha to a house mocktail, tell guests why. If you’re using reishi mushroom in a fermented tea base, explain what it does. This isn’t false health claiming. It’s transparency about ingredients that have been used in traditional medicine for centuries and are now being validated by peer-reviewed research into stress reduction, immune support, and sleep quality.

However, don’t claim that any mocktail is medicinal or capable of treating illness. That’s a legal minefield and will destroy trust faster than anything else. Instead, position functional ingredients as intentional additions that support wellness rituals. A mocktail with ashwagandha isn’t medicine. It’s a drink designed for guests who want to unwind with the same ritual they’d have with alcohol, minus the intoxication and next-day fatigue.​

Fermented ingredients, kombucha, kefir, tepache, koji-inspired beverages are also breaking through. These aren’t new, but they’re moving beyond health food stores into upscale restaurant programs. A fermented ginger shrub or lacto-fermented citrus blend adds gut-health credibility and flavor complexity that younger diners are actively seeking. According to consumer research on fermented food trends, 44.2% of respondents consume fermented foods for digestion and wellness, three times more than those who choose them purely for bold flavor. 34% of consumers say they’re more likely to trust a new fermented product when it carries a clear health benefit, such as probiotic support.​

**Prediction Three: Mocktail Profitability Will Become Your Non-Negotiable Competitive Advantage**

In 2026, the beverage program that moves from alcohol-centric to a portfolio strategy wins.

Non-alcoholic beverages are expected to grow at 5.7% annually through 2035, while traditional alcohol grows at only 1%. The restaurants that thrive in 2026 will stop seeing mocktails as a customer-service obligation and start treating them as the primary profit driver of their beverage business.​

The reality is that most restaurants price mocktails too low because they perceive them as easy to make and low-cost. They’re not. A properly crafted mocktail requires fresh juice, house-made syrups, specialty bitters, premium spirits alternatives (brands like Lyre’s, Seedlip, and Ritual cost $35 to $50 per bottle), quality ice, and skilled labor. When you break down the cost, you’re often at 30% to 35% food cost on a $10 mocktail. Your margins should reflect the work. You need to price it correctly.

The strategic play for 2026 is menu engineering. Build 3 to 5 hero mocktails that are non-negotiable fixtures on your menu. Price them at $11 to $14, if it costs out right. Build the margins by using high-cost, high-perception ingredients. Rotate 2 to 3 limited-time mocktails monthly, keeping the winners and cutting underperformers. Analyze which mocktails pair best with food. Attach them to specific dayparts. A morning mocktail might feature coffee or matcha. An afternoon refresher might feature fermented citrus and sparkling water. An evening aperitif might feature adaptogens and botanical spirits.​

Track every sale. Measure attachment to food orders. If a mocktail drives appetizer orders up by 12%, it’s doing real work. If a mocktail cannibalizes sales from another beverage, cut it and replace it with something better. Use technology to measure which beverages actually move the margin and which ones are just ego plays.​

The profitability equation is that in 2026, full-service and casual restaurants can no longer afford to treat beverage programs as static. The restaurants that thrive will treat their beverage portfolio like a hedge fund treats its holdings. Optimizing for margin. Test new products weekly. Scale winners faster than the competition.

44% of restaurants report mocktails as expanding due to rising health-conscious demand. Awareness of a trend isn’t execution. The difference between the operators winning today and the ones stuck in 2025 is that the winners will have a documented mocktail strategy. They’ll know their cost per serve. They’ll price for margin, not sentiment. They’ll educate their service team on functional ingredients. They’ll rotate aggressively. They’ll measure everything.​

**What This Means for Your Business Right Now**

Start with one hero mocktail. Something that reflects your restaurant’s identity. If you’re a steakhouse, that might be a high-alcohol-alternative spirit with bitter botanicals and fermented tea. If you’re casual dining, it might be a kombucha-based refresher with fresh fruit and house syrup. Train your bartender on why you built it. Price it at $12. Measure what happens to your check size.

By March 2026, add a second mocktail. Test a functional ingredient. Something with adaptogens. Reishi. Ashwagandha. Lion’s mane. Don’t make health claims. Just tell guests what’s in it and why you chose it.

By May 2026, rotate your first limited-time offering. Fermented fruit shrub. Koji-inspired botanicals. Something with technique and story.

By July, measure which mocktails drove the highest check attach, the highest repeat rate, and the highest perceived value. Double down on those. Cut the rest.

The mocktail era isn’t coming in 2026. It’s already here. The question is whether you’re going to treat it like a trend or like the most important margin opportunity your beverage program has seen in a decade.

When I was a kid, I had a vision of what my life would look like. I’m now 34, and my reality doesn’t match those dreams.

This isn’t to say my life is full of hardship — objectively, it’s comfortable. But comfort has quietly turned into mediocrity, and I’ve let years pass without truly trying.

Maybe this is the first wave of a midlife crisis, maybe not. Either way, enough is enough. I want to escape a life of average comfortability and actually try — to dream again and see what my life could become.

In full honesty, this post is for me, not for thee. I have a deep fear of people and their judgment. I don’t like being perceived, because if no one sees me, no one can hold me accountable.

So I’m using that fear as a tool.

For all of 2026, I’ll post a weekly accountability update here. I’ll be 100% transparent about my actions, spending, progress, setbacks, and thoughts. The focus is simple: small, consistent improvements over time. Progress over perfection.

Feedback, ideas, and constructive criticism are welcome.

**Personal**

* **No Drinking / No Games:** I’m cutting out drinking and video games because they’re my default escape. It’s too easy to have a drink and play a round (or 20) of something like LoL instead of doing the uncomfortable work that actually moves my life forward.  
* **Korean:** (TOPIK II) -I have a family that is Korean, and I’ve been putting off learning for too long. I’m starting a weekly Korean class at the end of January, and I want to track progress consistently - should I log vocabulary learned, practice exercises, or something else to keep myself accountable?  
* **Chess:** (1800) - I’m unrated right now and will begin attending weekly tournaments to track my rating progress and document lessons learned. My first tournament will be later this week and will give updates towards this, and I’ll add notes after each event to see growth over time.  
* **Coffee:** (Pop-up goal) - It’s my dream to eventually open a cafe, and I want to start building skills toward that this year. I’m thinking of ways to track progress - should I log recipes, tastings, or small pop-up experiments?  
* **Photography:** (1 photo/week?) - I want to start taking one photo per week to practice and document my skills. I’m not sure if I should post them weekly, create a personal log, or track it another way - feedback welcome on how to make this measurable and meaningful.

Make this week your best week yet. Don’t settle.

1q4aenj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BloodcurdlingTales/comments/1q4aenj/goatwitch/,Goatwitch,"She said her name was Maab. He didn't believe her. Until the end. 

Earliest morning. Still dark. The far off horizon hadn't yet birthed the sun. She'd said it must be so. 

He followed her, the hunched over black robed and hooded goblin shape that had only the semblance of a woman's old and weathered voice with which to perhaps mark her as human. 

She was not one of God's children. 

He followed her into the graveyard. So that they might fulfill the rite. 

And pull one back. 

She said it could be done. The thing that might be a woman that called itself Maab. And though it was vile blasphemy to do so, Wyckoff prayed that the foul shape in black was able to actually perform the ebon necromantic arts. 

Please. God forgive me. Please. 

I just want her back. Please just give her back to me. 

Maab-thing had croaked orders to him before they'd departed the village proper. Instructions. And materials needed. 

The place, the wound in time and nature, it must drink…

The place was shrouded in swamp gas and white blankets of heavy rolling fog. It was the only thing moving with any kind of life in the rotten cemetery. Neglected. Time had won a terrible battle here. Bomb-blasted and nearly primeval. It was as if the prehistoric age was reaching a clawing vengeful grasp from all the way back and digging in its terrible wounding marks here. 

In this place. Of cold. And sweat. 

Everything was rotten and rotting in this place and Wyckoff would've sworn that he felt the very air of the foul place begin on him its own putrefying process of slow decay. 

If I stay here long enough with that crawling she-thing my own hair and teeth and flesh and tissue will just liquify to green and melt away. Mayhap how she came to be in such a condition. 

He didn't like to look at her but he needed her so he kept behind her, the witch-woman Maab and he followed her to the pulling place. Time womb. 

Hellmouth. 

Oh God… why did I ever put you in this place…? Whatever compelled me to put you in the ground here… why did I leave you in this rotting dark place…? 

A great wail, electrical throated animal cry from somewhere in the pale. From within the white shrouded dead dark. It sounded both desperate animal and malfunctioning failing mechanics, atonal techo-organic, a metallic KO from another obsidian world. 

Wyckoff clapped his cold sweating greasy palms, filthied, to his ears and cried back in response. Begging it to stop. Maab the witch-thing just cackled her snapping shrubbery laughter and urged the fragile man forward. 

He went. They went on. 

…

They came to the place and she turned and regarded him then. 

She threw back the hood. Wyckoff suppressed a shriek. 

Her flesh was as melted wax. Mishapen and sculpted by a cruel hand wielded by a demented mind. Tissue as clay bubbled and erupted in scarred mutilated remnant of a woman's face. Yellow eyes gazed reptilian from within the distorted warped features of a hag-lizard, snake-bitch design. 

Someone had tried to burn her before. Someone had tried to burn this witch once already. Someone had put her to the stake. 

Yet here she stood. 

She thrummed with power. Wyckoff could feel it. They stood over the cold lonely grave of his Paula. She'd said it was perfect. It was right next to the bastard womb. It was right beside the cradle of filth that was a womb of light only shrouded in shadow. She would show him. 

He would see. 

He brought forth the knapsack at her instruction. The small creature inside had ceased struggling in the journey through this sour bastard land. But as he raised it before them both, the cat inside must've sensed their terrible intent for it renewed its thrashings and yowling. Reinvigorated. Revived. Brought to life. 

Maab spoke. Wyckoff nodded. Brought forth the great blade. 

It was a large hunting knife. Beautiful. Ornate handle with a sparrow in flight with a sprig of fig leaf in its beak carved into the handle by Paula's father. For the wedding. A gift. So long ago. 

She laughed at him and told him to stop dawdling. And laughed at him again. Her dry cackles the dead cracking rustles of little animal bones jostled in the killing den of the black nest. 

He attempted to pray. To God. For forgiveness. 

She yelled. Scorned. She told the little fool that the Jew God had no power over this blind land. Some places spoiled and were lost to the other side. Enemy territory, she called it. And smiled a sliming black smile. It wet the dry leather of her lips to a dripping ebon-green. She stretched out her thin skeletal-goblin arms and splayed out her claws. 

Begin then, bade the witch. 

He did. 

Holding the struggling small satchel aloft over the grave of his lost love, he plunged the long hunting blade into the pregnant teardrop bulge filled with feline life and stilled the beast. 

The blood, warm, flowed. 

Spilled. Onto the grave. 

The warm blood flowed forth and Maab began to sing-speak. Throat-screech bastard tongue and black words that were eons old when the Earth was virginal and new. 

Wyckoff held the bleeding thing where it was and let it pour onto the terrible land that held his Paula prisoner. He let the earth drink so that she may be once more set free. 

please give her back to me…

At first nothing … …

A beat …

But then the blood, thick and growing darker in color like pitch, began to pool about the wretched little grave. Unnaturally. Accumulating and growing in an abundance that was not in sensible correlation with what flowed forth from the small dead beast in satchel and into the growing pool. 

It began to dance. The surface of blood. With little ripples that suggested movement. Life. Something moved beneath its surface. Something was alive inside.

Wyckoff began to sweat despite the cold. His eyes were wide in a bulge and unbelieving. His visage was all a mask of greasy grimey flesh and desperate gazing eyes. Wide. Wide as the whole Earth. 

It began to emerge. And Maab began to laugh. 

And sing.

Naked. She dripped with thick ichor. Hair matted down in a blanket mass. Her breasts and figure more plump and ample than before in life. Lips full, generous mouth slitted in a smirk. Her eyes were ghostly aglow with mischievous light. 

Wyckoff saw all of this and none of this. His wide eyes never blinked. Paula…

Her smirk grew wider to a grin and the grin grew teeth. 

She raised her bare arms to him and held them out and open. Come. Come into them. Come to me. 

Wyckoff obeyed the gesture without hesitation. 

Within her arms he knew he made a mistake. It was cold. Colder than the earth. As ice of the Scandinavian warrior's hell. He tried to pull away immediately but found she was endowed with terrible strength. He struggled a moment, dread and worry and not comprehending what was happening even as it occurred trap-like all around him. 

He looked up into her face then. The thing that should be Paula but wasn't. 

The visage had begun to crack. The mask had begun to deteriorate. The pores first deepened and filled with coagulant and filth and then began to squirt and spray out like rancid milk and cheese. The eyes suddenly burst into flame and began to roast within the failing skull as the once immaculate face and flesh of his beloved Paula began to slough away. 

It fell to the cursed earth with a slop. What was behind the mask was a dreadful mess, a wild chaos set of eyes and teeth and mandibles and tendrilic hissing things of the color pink.  

Maab howled laughter and discarded her robe. She too was naked beneath. 

Her misshapen flesh and goblin-woman form began to shift and change as the scar-tissue of her ravaged form began to undulate and dance and manipulate. 

Bones snapped as she grew taller. Twice. Twice her height. Cracking could be heard in tandem with Wyckoff’s desperate screaming amongst the rolling white clouds of fog and the sour damp stones of the cemetery graves. 

Fur. It grew wild and patchy and all over. But inconsistent. Like a sick animal that should be dead from pestilence but isn't because it is the devil's harbinger. 

Her face stretched and these bones snapped too but Maab just laughed. Loving it. Loving all of this. She always loved to take this shape. 

Horns erupted from wiry dry witch hair that was more straw from the floor of a barn than anything alive. They were coated in something that had once been human blood but now was the noxious color and odor of seaweed. 

Her eyes changed color and composition. Pupils swirled like milk within a cup of coffee into blasphemous cross shapes. Terrible black Xs that were the universal shape and character that was the symbol for death. Death. 

She grew a beard upon her long misshapen chin of scarred ancient flesh. She stroked it as she watched the thing take the shrieking Wyckoff. He was begging it to stop. 

Please. He filled the cemetery, the sky, the heavens. He filled the entire world and universe in encompass with his desperate throated pleas. 

Maab the goatwitch did not answer him. She'd already given him what he wanted. Now she was taking her part. It was all just the natural order. 

The natural order of things. 

Maab belted cruel strange animal laughter into the sky in duet tandem with Wyckoff and his desperate caterwauls of mind-flaying insanity. They filled the sky together and the day never came to be.

1q4aeet,https://i.redd.it/2wgmqgpb7gbg1.jpeg,Hawas Viper (Review) - The Classy Unc,"My father (67yo) said this smells like an airport smoking lounge in Vancouver, Canada to him. If anyone knows that smell, and has smelt this, let me know if this tunes true 😄.

I think this is for the classy young man, probably better suited for those 25+. Hawas Viper immediately feels grown: dark, warm, and composed. It’s not trying to be youthful or crowd-pleasing; this is something you wear for yourself.

The saffron opens dry and slightly bitter, almost leathery. There’s a cannabis note listed, but if it’s there, it’s subtle; more of a green, herbal vibe than anything smoky or skunky. 

The heart is where it clicks for me. Rich tobacco and mellow coffee take over, smooth and rounded with a touch of warmth from cinnamon. Nothing sweet or overly loud, just well-blended, refined and warm.

I can smell the dry-down bringing tonka bean, softening everything with a SLIGHTLY sweet, comforting finish. It feels grounded, confident, and complete.

Longevity is strong, pushing 9 hours straight out the box, with moderate projection. It stays noticeable, but close after the first couple of hours, which suits its more mature vibe. That said, I am 

Not a compliment “magnet” but when it is noticed, it’s “that smells expensive” type of compliment. If you’re into darker, grown-up fragrances with saffron, tobacco, and coffee, this one’s worth a shot.",1,1767582852.0,u_simocd,0,1.0,False

1q4addh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1q4addh/not_sure_where_my_marriage_stands/,Not sure where my marriage stands,"Sorry, this is going to be long.

Too long, didnt read version: married with a son, husband has betrayed me several times, not physically that I know of, married 12 years. He doesn't care about much of anything, but is usually nice and happy. But is also passive aggressive. The pain from the past still hurts, there are holes in his stories, and he doesn't feel bad about the things he has done, I cant even bring my friends around anymore because he flirts with them and makes things awkward. I regret marrying him, but I dont know if I should leave because our son (11) doesn't see the conflict, he sees us being friends. I feel stuck, I try to forgive but the hurt doesn't go away.

Im not sure what to think of my marriage. 41/f he is 48. We have an 11 year old son together, and I have 16 and 17 year old daughters from a previous marriage. From the start, when I first met my husband he was low effort with everything, he didnt pursue me, I pursued and called him. He was between homes because he was on his way up to Alaska to go gold panning but needed some money so he was trying to get a part time job. We started dating and he was just really easy going and kind, which drew me in. But he also has a passive aggressive a-hole side to him.

I thought he really cared about me, but he ended up going to Alaska anyways. He didnt really bother to call me. I felt like he was doing to me what he was doing to his ex. When we first met he was still dating his ex and he was trying to get with me, I told him no, he needed to break up with her first, but despite him saying he didnt like her he dragged his feet. Which I should've seen as a sign. While he was up in Alaska his room mate kicked him out because I guess he was paying his rent with gold instead of cash, she he ended up sleeping in an outhouse and then at a hostel. 

This was all back in 2011. He moved back down to be with me, but I think it was because I was begging him to. I was addicted to his attention and his kindness. But he was also a flirt. When we first started dating I found Facebook messages (he didnt log out on my laptop)  between him and a few other women that were flirty, and he told me they were like sisters to him. 

He always had an excuse for his flirty behavior. And he would watch porn and lie about it, we had agreed we didnt want it in our relationship. But still, he has always been a kind and selfless person. But his flaws are he doesn't seem to care about anything including paying bills, he is passive aggressive, and he has a temper sometimes. I saw him kick our cat once and he saw that I saw him and he laughed and said ""you thought I kicked the cat? 😆 "". And he has been borderline abusive to my girls by yelling at them, and one time last winter my daughter tossed snow at her brother and my husband got mad and grabbed snow and rubbed it in her face, she tried to get away and he grabbed her arm. He denied all of this and said he ""gently tossed snow at her"" and said she was lying, she was really worked up and hyperventilating. 

There have been some incidents like that. And then also the lapses in judgement, like when he took our son at 5 in the morning to go look at stars and my girls woke up and they were gone and he didnt leave a note, and since he is never near his phone he wasn't answering. My girls called me at work, but I was finally able to get ahold of him and he was mad because they are old enough to be by themselves. Not the point.

And there was an incident with his 19 year old coworker, I had just had our son and I found deleted texts on his phone, I could only retrieve the first 3 or 4 words from each. But he said something about having to go shower at work. They worked night security at a data center, so it was just the 2 of them usually in a big building with limited cameras. There ended up being an investigation done on them because some people were saying things about them, but my husband couldn't remember. But the results were sent to our house, it said they disappeared off camera for several hours, he denied this and said they were in the break room, but there are cameras over there. The last text he sent her he said ""i will miss you... all"" because he was fired. He said it was innocent. I said ""what would you think if I sent that to someone?"" He said ""i wouldn't care"", he honestly probably wouldn't. Anyways, he was 36 and she was 19. He swears on our son that nothing happened. A few women came forward and told the boss that he made them uncomfortable. He was giving them massages in a room, because he had a massage license.

So that was the 1st big thing, and then the 2nd big thing which is more recent, was that he quit his job of 10 years without telling me. So about 2 weeks before it happened he tried to aggressively get me on board with him quitting his job to go gold panning full time (he has been panning for 20 years, and so far he has only found a few hundred dollars worth of gold), he was getting really upset that I wasn't enthusiastically on board, he said we have been living my dream, so its time to live his dream and it will be fine because he will pull out his 401k and we can live off of that, and then when it starts to run out he would go back to work, he promised. So at first I agreed because I felt bad. And then after a while I changed my mind and said we should compromise, he can pan on tbe weekends to see if he could replace his job with it, he said he easily could, he said he could make over 50 grand a year doing it.

So, we agreed with the weekend situation. But a week later he comes to me to tell me Thursday would be his last day, and he also admitted he had already put in his notice weeks before our previous conversation, he was just trying to get me on board so it would be smoother. He said he knew it could be the final straw that would make me leave him but he didnt care, he said ""i knew it would either make us or break us but I didnt care"", he also knew that if I left he wouldn't see his son as much, but he said he didnt care. 

So he quit his job, I almost left him but he swore he would go to marriage counseling and also personal counseling (he went to 1 appointment and didnt like it.). He said he had the opportunity to change his mind and tell hr to retract his notice but he never did. He never found gold during those 4 months, and then money was dwindling and he was not finding work, he admitted he was dragging his feet because he didnt want to work for anyone because all jobs were thr same, all bosses were a-holes. 

Luckily his job was willing to take him back eventually. But now we have fallen behind on our mortgage and some bills are not being paid. We are working with a financial advisor that i hired to help us. He honestly couldnt care less, he is oblivious to our financial condition. I feel like even though he is kind and thoughtful most of the time, he just doesn't care if i stay or go and he doesn't see that im no longer in love with me, he doesn't see it because I am still nice to him like a friend. 

Our kids dont know about all of this conflict. If we were violent or really toxic I would be gone, but I stay for our son and because my husband still displays selfless behavior every day and goes out of his way for us, he cooks and makes me coffee, he does a lot of the running around. I feel dependent on him. Luckily I have a really good paying job, so if things were worse I could leave. 

I just feel stuck. Do I just try to forgive all of this and get past it, even though it physically hurts to be hugged and loved by him? He had said very hurtful things, but i feel addicted to his daily kindness and that's what keeps me around.

I believe it was also not immediately ruled as a seizure because he just slid down the wall into a curled position with no shaking, and around 1 hour of confusion after arriving at the hospital. The doctor said that since the tests were inconclusive, no driving for a year, then he could be cleared.

Today we were eating dinner at home when I asked him a question about what he was doing tomorrow/if he had a big day tomorrow. The answer he gave me was really confusing; he was speaking clearly and in full sentences, but he was answering a completely different question, unrelated to what I had asked him. 

Then he stopped speaking completely and stared blankly at me. Of course, I was terrified and started crying and screaming out, ""Why aren't you speaking? Can you hear me?"" Then shortly after, started violently shaking for around a minute, then went still, breathing hard, eyes rolled back and half closed. Of course, I called an ambulance as soon as the shaking started, and he was taken to the hospital. This time, he was given Keppra and discharged with a referral to the same neurologist that we originally saw. 

My reason for posting is to ask about others' experiences and opinions on the connection between stress and seizures. My father, like many other people, is chronically stressed about money. He also has this tendency, when he's thinking or rather spiralling about finances, to space out. He goes into states of confusion and has to ask me to repeat myself 5 or 6 times. It usually never lasts longer than a minute, but once at a coffee shop he went completely silent after a moment of confusion and didnt speak for around 5 minutes, just stared while I cried and asked why he wasn't responding. He always told me that he just tends to space out when he's stressed. But the spacing out, and the spacing out before the seizure, just feel too similar. 

I think because he doesn't want to pass the anxiety about money onto me, he is dismissive of my concerns about spacing out being connected to a bigger health problem.

Does anyone have any advice? Has anyone else had experiences similar to mine? If so, what did you do to help them/yourself? ",5,1767582667.0,Epilepsy,2,1.0,False

	•	Heated pool (kiddie pool preferred, no big waterpark needed)

	•	Reliable elevators (huge deal with stroller + grandma)

	•	Clean, decent reviews

	•	Walkable to restaurants/coffee or very close

	•	Close to Boardwalk/Broadway preferred, but willing to drive 10–15 min

Places I’ve looked at:

	•	Dunes Village – looks great but recent reviews mention cold pools, loud/chaotic atmosphere

	•	Bay View – perfect location, but too many elevator complaints

	•	Island Vista – worth the higher price and distance north?

Also considering Anderson Ocean Club and Oceans One — any thoughts for families with young kids?

This happened last night. Two men entered the cafe and without ordering sat for hours. They barely spoke to eachother except for occasional whispers. They had nice branded clothes and expensive looking watches not necessarily relevant just observations. But when I went on my lunch break and walked past one stoped me saying “are you leaving now?” Like they had been waiting for me. I said no and they asked when I got off. I ignored them and sat in the cafe even though I was going to leave and I thankfully had a headset nearby so I put it on and let my shift know what had happened and he asked if he should tell them to leave. I said no at the moment just asked him to keep an eye on the situation but after another 30 minutes they were still there watching me work and buying nothing so he approached and told them that they had to buy something to be there. They claimed to be “waiting on someone” which creeped me out a bit cause I feel like maybe they meant me. He said they had 1 minute to buy something or get out and with 5 seconds left they bought a short black coffee and moved to the spot I had been sitting in for my lunch and stayed for 2 more hours watching me not speaking to eachother eventually they got in their cars and left withought meeting anyone. probably when they realized that I wasn’t leaving anytime soon

Anyway the whole thing was really creepy and I’m not sure what I should do if they come back because I know I had seen them in there previously although I don’t remember any purchases they made so I’m sure they will be back

••••••••••••

December 14th:

I land in Netherlands. I arrive to my airbnb at 5 pm , he gets there at 530 pm. We spend the entire evening together then he ends up spending the night. One thing that caught me off guard was that he was extremely adamant about sleeping with me. Idk if it’s because there was a lot of chemistry or if it’s cause he was being a man. 

December 15th:

I had to be in belgium that day so I allowed him sleep in and on the way out at door at 4 am I gave him a hug and kiss bye and he said to text him later so I did. So he sent me a message, I misread it, got upset, and told him “I’ll text you tomorrow” and blocked him on WhatsApp and unfriended him on insta. I spent this night alone.

December 16th:

I had to be in Germany. He texted me “are you gonna ghost me?” And talk then end up getting back together and that night he ends up coming back over.

December 17th:

He had work this day but ended up calling in sick to spend time with me. He said he had to call work twice that day. Once in the morning and once in the evening to let them know he wasn’t going in and to update them on how he was feeling (kinda weird right?). 

Anyways that was my last full day there. It’s weird he didn’t want to spend the late evening and spend the night with me right? On the first day in he would tell me things like “you’re intimidating” and that he was insecure. Then , on the last day we were talking and he said “if you lived here I’d date you but I’m not sure if it would work because I get very cold”. Then I told him “I hope I don’t block you, I feel like I made a real friend in you” and he said “it would be hard to not be offended by the blocking we have good chemistry”.

So… the morning of the 17th we went to a city outside of Amsterdam and had coffee and explored the village. We then went home had lunch and he had to get a hair cut. I told him when we were waiting on our food to arrive “you can just go home after your haircut” and he was visibly caught off guard but said okay. Fast forward he’s getting ready to leave and he was so causal about leaving that it bothered me, he was like “I hope you have fun exploring Amsterdam” and I was like “wait will you actually come back when you’re done?” And he was like “only if you want me to”. 

So he ended up coming back and I had things to do so after an hour we agreed he should leave and before he left I literally just broke down crying in his arms and he held me for like ten minutes. Then I calmed down and I walked to the door to let him out and as he was walking towards the door I started to cry again and you could see in his face that hated it like his face went from calm to dropping like “ugh I don’t want to see you like this”. 

Anyways, he leaves. I told him to not text me and to just let me text him when I felt better and he agreed. When I readded him on Instagram he was like “are we going to be friends forever?” And I said “I hope so” and he said “you should just do another stop in Amsterdam”. Fast forward I end up blocking him mid conversation I explained I cared about him and would miss him but ultimately was afraid I’d disappoint him. That was almost 2 weeks ago.

I reached out on New Year’s Eve to see if maybe I could see him again but after an hour of no reply I unsent the message and reblocked him.

SIDE NOTE: earlier I asked him why he wasn’t going to spend the night and he started giving me excuses and when he realized I was sad over it he said he would stay the night.

Other things that bothered me: 

He insinuated I DoorDash food for him lol and I said no and he laughed it off

He never paid for me for anything and every time I bought food I paid fully but we always shared it. He doesn’t have a good paying job at all and even once said “it must be nice not having to worry about money” to which I replied “that’s not true at all” so maybe that’s it?

Also he kept trying to make future plans saying that I should meet him and his friends in Chicago and that he wanted to come visit me in Colorado and so on

Also he liked a girls photo, who he follows, who I found out was on a website where men fly her out to their country in exchange for intimate stuff but it was only a picture of her in Colorado lol and he knows I’m from there. And then when I blocked him he started following a couple people. 

But he showed me pics of him and his fam and wanted me to do the same with my fam

During text , after I left, he also said he didn’t want me talking to other guys and that I was his girl and that he’d be upset and jealous if I did

1q4a4r1,https://i.redd.it/8jirp9g45gbg1.jpeg,What makes Yunnan coffee distinct for pour-over (and why it feels underrated)?,"I recently went down a rabbit hole reading about Yunnan coffee — its history, growing regions, and how it’s typically processed — and I’m surprised how rarely it comes up in pour-over discussions.

For those who’ve brewed Yunnan coffees with V60 or similar methods:

What do you feel really defines them in the cup? Climate, varieties, processing styles, or roast approach?

I’ve seen some described as chocolate-forward and mellow, others as surprisingly bright and structured, which made me curious how much of that is origin-driven vs. roast or processing choices.

If you have specific farms, regions, or roasters worth reading about, I’d love to dig deeper. Just trying to learn more and understand where Yunnan fits stylistically in the pour-over world.",4,1767582114.0,pourover,2,1.0,False
1q4a3uo,https://i.redd.it/dc4nhs6i2gbg1.png,"How Kyoto Tech Meetup's site self-updates with Astro, GitHub Pages, and GitHub Actions","Hi Astro fans. I organize the Kyoto Tech Meetup. Our website is built by our community during hack days. I wrote a blog post a few days ago (link below) to help future contributors get up and running.

When it comes to a continual workstream like organizing a meetup, I prefer a policy of “I shouldn’t have to remember to update it” when possible.

For the Kyoto Tech Meetup site, that means that I want the site to update itself as new meetups come and old meetups go.

I thought I'd share here in case this is of interest to other Astro site builders here.



\## Tech stack

The pillars of our tech stack are:

\- Astro 5  
\- GitHub Pages  
\- GitHub Actions

  
\## Build, deploy, and cron

Our GitHub Action runs a build and deploy in these scenarios:

1. There's a merge to main  
2. The cron runs  
3. A manual build-and-deploy is triggered

  
When build-and-deploy happens, the build process does the following:

\- Updates member feeds to show recent content from our blogs  
\- Updates the on-site meetup calendar

For updating member feeds, we execute`scripts/fetch-feeds.mjs` to fetch every RSS/Atom URL in [src/data/member-feeds.json](https://github.com/kyoto-tech/kyoto-tech.github.io/blob/main/src/data/member-feeds.json?ref=ashryan.io), normalize and filter items, then write [src/data/composite-feed.json](https://github.com/kyoto-tech/kyoto-tech.github.io/blob/main/src/data/composite-feed.json?ref=ashryan.io).

For updating the meetup calendar, our [src/components/Calendar.astro](https://github.com/kyoto-tech/kyoto-tech.github.io/blob/main/src/components/Calendar.astro?ref=ashryan.io) component runs a server-side fetch. This fetch gets our upcoming event data from Meetup and bakes it into the generated HTML/JS.

I(20M) asked a couple weeks ago a girl from my universities' work group. At the time she said yes but that it couldnt be then because i only got the courage right before christmas break and she was about to leave to be with her family. But she still added that she would be down to go on a date on a later date, which i confirmed.

We're only together when we work on assignments and not often alone since its groups of about 5-6 people but when we work we tend to make a good pair, although we never go personal, only talk about college.

I inicially asked her for a coffee date, but now i'm not sure what to suggest. Since i asked inicially i feel it's my responsability to pick something nice. Got a suggestion from a friend about going to like a crepe place but still wondering if i should do something else, like a stroll, or a movie.

I also worry about how to behave. Only been one 1 date before and it wasn't bad but not great. Im also introverted, and although I believe we make a good match, and i want to learn more about her, i'm scared of turning it into an interrogation.

There's also the possibility that she doesn't see this as a date. I mean, in my language ""a date"" isn't a really used expression so i basically said i wanted to go for a coffee or something, just the two of us.

My husband (35m) and I (31f) have been together for 9 years, we have two kids together. I have four younger sisters, including ""Sarah"" and ""Hailey"", who are 19 year old twins. Hailey and my mom have a terrible relationship, Hailey is the sweetest girl but my mom is so mean to her and she moved in with me and my husband when she was 14, and has lived with us since. She is very close with both me and my husband, as well as our kids, and basically like a member of our core family unit. 

My other sister Sarah stayed with our mom, and hates my husband. She's hated him since I started dating him for literally no reason (she hates everyone until she warms up to them, and she never warmed up to him) and he can't stand her, even though he did genuinely try for years. It's to the point that he doesn't want her around our kids, and honestly I support him, I didn't even let her come to the wedding because of how she speaks to him. She also doesn't get along super well with Hailey, she was vicious to her growing up but they've been  spending time together trying to heal old wounds the last year.

She got into a lot of trouble growing up and has a history of lying to get people in trouble but never too extreme and as far as I know it stopped once she was around 15. But I can't shake that, or how she just can't stand my husband when it comes to what I am about to share.

Last week, she asked me if we could get coffee, which we did, and she told me that Hailey is having an affair with my husband. I immediately told her she was lying and didn't believe her, but she was adamant. She claimed that she and Hailey got drunk with some high school friends and Hailey told her while super drunk and started crying. Which, they definitely did get together and drink, but there's no way of verifying the rest. She had no proof whatsoever. But she remained adamant, and started crying which I haven't seen in a long, long time, and told me she doesn't know for a fact but suspects it started happening years ago, which makes me sick to my stomach for obvious reasons.

I don't know what to do. Either she's telling the truth and my husband is having an affair with my MUCH younger sister, potentially since she was underage, which is beyond unforgivable, or my other sister is trying to destroy my marriage and potentially get my husband accused of some terrible things, which is almost unforgivable. I can't stop thinking about it and feel sick to my stomach. I'm second guessing every interaction between my husband and Hailey, and like I said they're close. I went through his phone while he was in the shower, and his texts with her were all infrequent and normal but he's not an idiot and would be communicating with her some other way. If it's even needed because she lives in our fucking house.

I don't know what to do and I can't tell anyone I know about this because my life could just blow up and I don't want it to blow up for lies my sister told",178,1767581726.0,whatdoIdo,274,0.86,False

I woke up angry again. I reminded myself that I forgave my ex - for me to let go of her.

Later today I met a lovely lady for coffee. We spent 3 hours talking and it felt great. We would have kept talking if we both didn't have other prior commitments. It was natural, not forced and amazing to experience connecting with another woman. I could feel my confidence, I could feel my natural authentic self coming out and he was connecting with another person, a physically beautiful woman, who turned out to be intelligent and emotional mature and it was great. 

For the first time in a year, the beginning of my marital problems, I didn't think about my ex-wife (of only a couple weeks). For the majority of the three hours we talked I didn't think about my ex! 

Meeting someone else is a very risky move. It could go either way; either it brings up more pain, resentment and sorrow or it calms the nervous system. I'm lucky that it actually calmed my nervous system down.

It's funny I didn't even realize I wasn't thinking about my ex wife until we parted ways after the coffee. After meeting I thought about what happened and I was shocked when I realized I didn't even think of my ex...then the anger came back 😂😂😂 I started thinking things like ""can't believe I have to do this again, I have to find someone to love and love me back"". I just let the emotion come to me and didn't try to fight it. The 3 hour void of thinking about my ex was a big enough win. I didn't need to win every battle today.


I've now set a new goal for myself. I will stop talking about my ex wife by next Friday. Talking about her is still holding onto her in a way. She doesn't deserve access to my heart, mind or soul - even if she doesn't know I'm thinking about her. I don't want her living rent free in my head. Of course I will speak about her if necessary such as in therapy, explaining my history to a date if needed or posting on this subreddit etc.


I'm going to sleep with small thoughts and feelings of anger but I'm also going to sleep with great joy that for a small time I forgot all about her today 😁 And a little excitement that there may just be a wonderful lady out there just waiting for me to find her and her find me 😁 There's still a road ahead and I will make sure I'm ready to be in the right place to give and receive love, I will not hurt another because I didn't heal properly.

Sometimes life fucking sucks! But with hard work and a little luck, after that shitty part, comes ease and joy!

I am mostly looking to avoid buying milk, because it never lasts long in our house and we've had bad luck where we shop with it going bad within days. 

I was wondering if anyone had ideas for what to do with what I have:

Flour, sugars, and yeast
Pancake mix
Rice
Chicken and eggs. I also think I have ham I can use, but I'm not sure if it's still good. 
Sour cream, Cream cheese, shredded cheese, ricotta cheese, and butter
Hot chocolate mix, teas, and coffee
Condiments
Homemade pumpkin and carrot purees 

I am allergic to peanut butter, which is my only true restriction. However, my baby loves it, so I can make snacks specifically for her using it. 

My audience is an almost 1 year old who can't eat choking hazards, but loves all food, and my very picky husband. 

We are trying to avoid red meat as well, bc of his gout, but we're just minimizing at this point. 

Eggs or chicken and rice is an option, but I enjoy variety.

I am mostly looking for advice on:

Meal prep lunches
Sweet snacks (likely baking stuff)
And ways to stretch dinners to last longer

I have a now 10 year old daughter and have been dating my boyfriends for 2.5 years. I just got out of a toxic relationship of 5 years but my daughter didn’t even realize he was gone since she barely saw him, he was always gone working and not really around so she felt like it was just me and her for as long as she could remember. This is important detail for later. My now boyfriend and I moved in together quickly. We both are the type to be all in. He’s never been married or had children, although he’s always wanted to. So this was a huge change to have someone so involved and caring. We are vegetarian/daughter vegan and he adapted to our diet on his own for health. He watched my cook for a few weeks and started taking over cooking amazing meals almost every night, helping her enroll and teach her sports, make my coffee every morning and her lunch for school. He’s an acts of service guy. I make significantly more than him and we realized with his skill sets and artistic capabilities it made sense for him to be more of a house manager since she was aloof enough to not really need lots of “child sitting”. My gosh he can do it all! The first year was an adjustment. Him learning not to “over parent”, and get to this point of helpfulness. Really this amazing set up happened in year two. 

We’ve gone on three snowboarding trips to Japan and Tahoe. Traveled to NY, and New England. 

There’s one big problem though. His communication is very toxic. I didn’t realize that until we started dating he would throw extreme tantrums. Such as (before we starting dating) if they got his food wrong sometimes flip his plate over at a restaurant. He’s never done that with me, but I’ve seen his mild outbursts and they remind me of a pre-teen acting act in school. I would have never guessed this because 95% of the time he’s so easy going. Cool, calm and collected and just so easy to be around. But I do have to say encourage him to be best version of him and be his beacon of motivation often. These tantrums though are unpredictable and super triggering. A recent example; we just got back from a vacation. He immediately unpacked all of our suitcases and did all of the laundry. Honestly, sometimes he’s so amazing like that. It’s the next day and we all slept in super late which never happens and I was feeling lazy so when he went to get lunch, I got up and started folding some of the laundry. He was so mad that I touched the laundry because that was “his thing “. After deeper conversation, he felt as if when I step in and do things like laundry or dishes that I am telling him without my words that he’s not doing enough or he’s not doing it fast enough. To the bottom of my heart, I explain that’s not at all it, I was bored and genuinely enjoyed watching something on my phone while I folded laundry. It was mindless and productive, and I enjoyed it. He just gets so angry, and it shifts the entire mood in the whole house for the rest of the day though. It doesn’t feel like it’s a place of love, but maybe an insecurity. Which I can understand, but I still demand healthy communication either way.

Now I’m a lot to handle sometimes too. I own multiple businesses and like things a certain way. I’ve learned to adapt to my surroundings and not be OCD, but eventually when I’m under a lot of stress with so many people depending on me I start to clean or need things orderly because I’m too stimulated. Sometimes it’s a crippling amount of responsibility emotionally and financially. To top it off we live in one of the highest price areas in the US. I’ll make comments or jabs in hopes that others will pick up their slack. I know this is something I have to work on. You can tell when I’m in this mode though because I start moving around quickly and getting a lot of things done. This was not the case, for example with the laundry above. But I can see how he might not be able to tell the difference. 

There is some other adage stressors in a household also. That ex-boyfriend I mentioned earlier in a post also turned out to be quite crazy. A couple years after we broke up, he found out I was dating my new boyfriend who at one point did some work on his condo. He sued us both with the “intent to destroy me“. He is suing me for my house that I purchased from one of his family members. Although he does not have grounds, it’s already cost me $100,000 last year just to go through the process and probably another hundred thousand or more this coming year. Whenever I have deadlines coming up for the lawsuit or new discoveries, it gets me so angry that I even have to go through this process that my anxiety seeps through and I become short and agitated with everyone around me. When this all started last year, it really took a toll on me. Not to get into too much detail, but I started getting stomach ulcers and was bleeding internally and vaginally for 80 days. Then ended up with an ectopic pregnancy that landed me in the ER. I did have a two-year-IUD in, but luckily they caught it in time. With my lower organs sitting in the fluids/blood for that long it made me very sluggish and lethargic. I lost a lot of work and over $100,000 of income. I’m only giving these details because I think having an overall understanding of the stress can provide insight to a household dynamic.

Overall, we are naturally all pretty happy people and don’t sweat the small stuff. After some therapy and going to some naturopathic doctors, I was in much better health towards the end of the year. But the one thing that I can’t seem to figure out as if I’m overlooking this relationship dynamic. My daughter likes him and he has taught us many things, such as snowboarding, surfing, crocheting, culture,. He added stuff to our life that we never had before, and we love that. Again, he consistently tries to cook and clean and love on us and everyone in our life. But emotionally and mentally the conversations are limited and I’m always scared that he’s going to blow up again and the fights last for a while. He does not know how to shelter my daughter from this either. And she has never seen me fight with anyone before. I told him from day one that I wouldn’t get into a relationship without therapy. He had promised me from the very beginning that he would go and still has not. However, he did start a new type of brain therapy that uses electromagnetic pulsing for brain, healing, and health. In fact, I did this as well which really put me back on my feet and gave me the energy I used to have.

We’re entering a new year and clearly I have made mistakes with my relationships in the past. My daughter is getting to the age where she is very observant. I guess I’m wondering am I over-reacting and not being patient with him working on his behavioral issues? Should I give this relationship more time? When is enough time?

I've been through a few iterations of vegetarian/ pesecatarian, then giving up and eating meat again. My thoughts on the subject have been fairly consistent, I've just been more or less willing to change my diet at different point.

After removing a lot of stress from my life, I felt ready to be vegitarian again. This round I finally ripped the bandaid off and looked into how ethical dairy is, because I acknowledge that as a vegetarian, I basically just replaced meat with cheese and yogurt. I was very disappointed to find that the vegans were right... There doesn't really seem to be a realistic way to get diary without a horrible process.

I'm kind of like grieving this. It feels like a much larger loss than meat.

 I really dislike fake meat. I liked impossible Burger and nuggets for a while but it soured on me and every other brand of fake meat I tried was really unpleasant to me.

I don't hate tofu, but I really only enjoy it in stirfry and curry where it doesn't feel like it's trying to be something else. I do not like tempeh. I had a similar experience with seitan as impossible burger - it was enjoyable at first but then it started to give me the ick.

I love beans and lentils. 

So... Right now I'm just eating lots of beans, lentils, occasional tofu, a lot of whole wheat bread and peanutbutter. Any tips on how to have some variety when being this picky? Any tips on the loss of diary?

Last Friday, through a series of coincidences, I ended up meeting a girl in my apartment building. I didn’t even have my car keys because my dad had taken them earlier, which forced me to go downstairs at a very specific time. When I opened the building door, there was a lost dog right at the entrance… and behind the dog was her.

We started talking about the dog, and that naturally turned into a real conversation. We ended up talking for about 25–30 minutes straight. It felt easy, natural, and comfortable. She wasn’t in a rush at all and seemed genuinely engaged.

At one point, she asked me my name. Later, before going back inside, I asked for her WhatsApp. She smiled and gave it to me.

After that, I went out and bought food for the dog and sent her a picture saying “mission accomplished.” She reacted warmly and appreciated the gesture. From that moment on, we kept talking.

Friday night, all day Saturday, and Sunday as well — basically a daily chat. It didn’t feel forced or dry. She asked questions, kept the conversation going, and seemed genuinely interested. She even started asking me for small favors, like helping her carry groceries upstairs or asking about a gas bill from the building. Considering we had just met, that felt like comfort and trust.

At some point, I found out (indirectly, not from her) that she had recently ended a relationship. She’s single, but it seems fairly recent. Still, given how engaged she was in the conversations, I didn’t feel like she was emotionally closed off.

By Sunday, I decided to be clear and invite her out. I kept it very light — just coffee at a place I really like. Nothing intense, no drinks, no big “date” energy. I sent her a voice note explaining the place and asked if she’d like to go.

Her response was friendly and playful, but vague. She basically said something like: “Yeah, later we should go.” No specific date, no alternative suggestion — just “later.”

I didn’t push. I replied casually, joked a bit, and said something like “Sure, you let me know.” I didn’t insist or bring it up again.

What’s confusing to me is the contrast. All the signs before pointed toward interest:
	•	A long first conversation
	•	She asked my name
	•	She gave me her contact
	•	Daily chatting for days
	•	She asked questions and kept the conversation alive
	•	She involved me in small parts of her daily life

So getting a “yes, but not now / maybe later” felt unexpected. Not a rejection, but not a clear yes either.

Now I’m staying neutral. I’m not chasing or following up, just focusing on my own life and routines. If she reaches out and makes it concrete, great. If not, I’ll take it as information and move on.

My question is:
How would you interpret this?
Does this sound more like genuine interest with bad timing, or a polite way of avoiding saying no?

Thanks in advance for your thoughts.

1. Warbonnet hammock - Sleeping in it during summer is super comfy. I only bought one at first, and now most of my camping buddies have one too.
2. Bluetti power station - Powers all USB lights, fans, CPAP, and even a 12V fridge. Also run small cooking appliances when needed. No more relying on shore power. It really opens up a lot more camping options for me.
3. Dometic 12V fridge - No more worrying about running out of ice or milk going bad. Camping feels like eating like a king. Once you get used to it, it's hard to go back.
4. Jetboil - If I don’t bring the power station, I use it. Boil water really quickly. Paired with a French press, coffee is a breeze.

At first, I started hearing music around one-tenth of a semitone higher (0.10 steps) than normal. Now, eight years later, it has risen to around four-fifths of a semitone (0.80 steps). The doctors who have tested my ears and hearing have determined that they are in excellent condition, and that my hearing phenomenon is likely due to environmental causes. They mentioned stress, caffeine, and high sodium as potential factors. I can say that I started experiencing this hearing issue right around the time I introduced coffee to my life, where I would normally have two to three cups a day. I’ve removed high-caffeine drinks from my life several times. Every time I stopped, the hearing issue wouldn’t get worse, but it would still remain. Nowadays, I still drink caffeine, without knowing for certain if caffeine is indeed the primary root cause.

The closest known condition I can compare this to is diplacusis, which seems to involve hearing noise/music differently in one ear. But my condition involves hearing things differently in both ears entirely. I did some more digging (with a little help from AI), and learned that a phenomenon like this happens in people with perfect pitch. Apparently, age and environmental factors can cause individuals to lose their perception of perfect pitch and instead gradually begin hearing things at higher or lower keys.",1,1767579701.0,perfectpitchgang,0,1.0,False

I actually respected the heck out of this girl and unfortunately made me like her more. I think I am going to try to stay friends though. And I will need some advice about that but let me get into the body language part.

Basically, I met this girl at a party. She approached me first and even ask for my number after talking for 5 minutes. We had alot in common and she kept saying I was cute. I also started to hug her and touch her hands. She didnt pull away and even grab my hands as well. She did all of this while sober btw.

We had a serious convo and I think that was what messed me up. Because we started talking about red flags in dating and what are we looking for. I didnt really start this convo, she did. Turns out she is visiting from out of state. And she has never had a bf. She is extremely picky as she told me. Well once New years happen, I didnt try to kiss her which may not be a thing since we just met.

Anyways, I texted her the next day and ask to meet up since her flight was leaving in a day. She took forever to text me back. And when she finally did. She said that she is too busy since she is visiting friends. However, she said she would meet up in the morning of her flight.

So I just met up with her and out of the gate her body language was stiff. She no longer was relaxed and her arms were crossed. She was guarding herself. She didnt even want me to buy her coffee. We talked for 2 hrs and she rarely asked me questions yet she talked a long time to me. She wasnt self centered but it was like she already knew how it was going to go down. She told me at the end. That I am a nice guy and super sweet. She isnt looking for a bf right now and she is a horrible texter.

Dang she covered all her bases lol. But then she said she wants to be friends and will try to keep in touch. I asked if she is serious and she said yeah call me sometimes because I wouldnt mind talking to you.

So now I wonder was it because I was too nice/sweet or we just were in different stages of life. Im in med school and super busy and she is in grad school in a different state and rarely comes to my state.

That is why I wonder did she really find me attractive and I ruined it. Or was this how she was always going to play it. Also would you keep in touch as friends since she seem serious about it?

Also here is our text exchange the day after:

Her: Sarah :)

Me: Hey Sarah, this is Kyle.

They've been together for about 5 or 6 years, but only living together for a year. He lived in Texas without papers; we're from northern Mexico. The whole family liked him, so my grandmother's grandchildren call him grandpa, except for the two oldest.

At first, he was very affectionate with me. He would look at me and hug me, tell me he loved me very much, and give me kisses on the cheek. I thought everything was normal. Now he's moved in with my grandmother, and she wants us to visit them often. During summer vacation, my mom went on a trip, and my grandmother argued that she wanted my sisters and me to stay with her because she would worry a lot if we didn't, and that it would worsen her heart condition.

My mom agreed, and my two younger sisters and I stayed with them. At first, everything was fine, but as the days went by, the man started to make me uncomfortable. I would be standing or sitting somewhere in the house, and he would keep walking past me, making up lame excuses, like he wanted to pick up trash or there was dust around, etc.

One day I was in the living room, and he came out alone, put his arm around my waist, and wouldn't let go. He kissed my cheek very close to my mouth, and when my grandmother came out, he pulled away. I wanted to leave because I felt really uncomfortable, but my mom insisted I stay because she only had a week left before she had to go back. I told my sisters why I couldn't take it anymore, and they said they felt uncomfortable too.

This winter break, my mom ""is"" with us here at her house, and I say ""is"" in quotes because she spends most of her time at relatives' houses and on dates with her boyfriend, leaving us alone here with them. If I'm in the dining room, he sits across from me. If I go to the living room, he comes too. If I go out to the patio, he comes too. Sometimes, while I'm eating, he makes himself a coffee or a glass of water, sits across from me, and just stares.

It lingers in the air, heavy with emotions left unsaid, creating distance where connection once thrived. But what if silence isn’t just avoidance—it’s an opportunity? An opportunity to reflect, reset, and rebuild. Understanding how to navigate these quiet moments can be the difference between unresolved tension and deeper understanding. Let’s explore how to break the silence, not with noise, but with intention

Arguments are bound to happen in any relationship—whether with a partner, friend, or family member. Often, it’s not just the words exchanged during the heat of the moment that linger, but also those unspoken after, creating a heavy silence filled with unresolved feelings. How do we navigate this aftermath without letting pent-up emotions fester?

# 1. Acknowledge the Silence Without Rushing to Fix It

Sometimes, silence isn’t inherently negative; it can be a pause for reflection. Instead of diving headfirst into trying to mend things, acknowledge that both parties might need a moment to cool down. A gentle approach like saying, “I’m here when you’re ready to talk,” can ease the tension without forcing immediate resolution.

# 2. Choose Empathy Over Ego

In the aftermath, it’s tempting to defend our position or prove ourselves right. However, genuine healing begins when we shift our focus from winning the argument to understanding the underlying emotions—be it hurt, frustration, or fear. Ask yourself what the real issue might be, beyond the surface of the disagreement.

# 3. Write Down What You Couldn’t Say

Whenever I found myself trapped in the void of silence after an argument, I discovered that writing was incredibly cathartic. I remember one evening, after a particularly intense exchange with a close friend, the quiet that followed was almost unbearable. Instead of bottling everything up, I grabbed my journal and let my thoughts flow freely. The act of writing not only helped me sort out my emotions but also gave me clarity on what I really wanted to communicate—a clarity that might have been lost in the heat of the moment.

# 4. Small Gestures Speak Volumes

Actions can often convey what words struggle to express. Whether it’s making a shared meal, leaving a note, or simply offering a sincere apology when both parties are ready, these small acts can bridge the gap created by lingering silence. I once surprised my friend with a cup of his favorite coffee along with a brief note acknowledging my part in the disagreement. It wasn’t a full conversation, but it opened the door to healing.

# 5. Reset the Energy With Something Neutral

Sometimes, the best way to move past the tension is to shift the focus altogether. Suggest an activity that both can agree on—a walk in the park, watching a favorite movie, or even sharing a meal. Engaging in something neutral helps to naturally dissipate the awkwardness while paving the way for a more meaningful conversation later.

# Conclusion

The silence following an argument isn’t just about the unsaid words—it’s a signal that something deeper needs attention. Whether through empathy, reflective writing, or thoughtful gestures, each step we take toward bridging that silence helps in the healing process. Remember, every small effort contributes to a broader journey of understanding and growth.

**My Takeaway:** In my experience, those quiet moments after a conflict often become the turning points in my relationships. They’ve taught me that while silence can be heavy, it also carries the potential for genuine connection and self-awareness. Embracing the silence, rather than fearing it, has allowed me to uncover truths about myself and my relationships that I might have otherwise missed.

I would love to get some insight on the situation with my nanny and hear if I'm being too picky or sensitive.(I do apologize in advance because it's a long rant)

Just a bit of a background about myself. My wife and I are both Healthcare professionals. We both work long hours and need our nanny to be abailable from 745am to 5pm monday to friday. We have two kids 6 and 4. We have been with our nanny for about a year and a half now. It started out great but there's just been too many things that has happened thats making me doubt our compatibility as an employee/employer.

My 4 year old son still goes to daycare full time and my daughter is in kindergarten, so she is gone for half the day. While I dont expect our nanny to deep clean the house, I politely ask her to take care of our laundry, tidy the house (clean dishes, light vacuuming, mopping, making the beds). We dont expect her to cook us any meals or dinner, just some light lunch for our 6 year old daughter when she comes back from kindergarten.

For the last little while, she has been very combative and argumentative about what I think are basic tasks (please correct me if im wrong), such as laundry, doing homework with our daughter etc. She says she is there to take care of our kids and not to do our laundry. (Pretty much had to convince her and beg her to do our laundry in between when she has time?). But she has 3 hours to herself every day when both my kids are out of the house. Ive always asked her to prioritize spending time with our kids and that I wouldnt expect her to able to deep clean the house everyday. And to only do the extra things when the kids are not home.

It has only come to my attention that she may be lacking way more than I thought in the recent days when my parents have come from out of town to stay with us at our house the last 2 weeks and have told me some of the things they have observed.

1)blatantly ignoring simple tasks, while drinking her coffee, reading her book and going on her phone to watch videos.

2)when my mom had asked for her help to clean up some of the kids toys in the basement. She told my mother that the basement is not a part of her responsibility and she flat out refused.

3)when my mom was helping our 4 year old son go to the bathroom, she had asked for some help to clean the toilet after he had made a mess. She said again no, that is not her job.

4)disappearing in the middle of her work day, leaving my children with my parents, while she goes upstairs to lie on my kids bed, playing on her phone.

Im assuming this is something that has been going on for a while, im just never home to obviously to monitor these kinds of behaviors. 

Other minor things include some instances where shes using our grocery money to buy her own personal items and groceries without telling us (only found this out recently). Calling our kids spoiled infront our faces because we are ""rich?"".

White Knight Week will be held from **Monday, May 11th, to Sunday, May 17th.** This will cover Weiss Schnee's birthday on the 15th and the canonization of Joan of Arc (Jaune Arc's inspiration) on the 16th. For those of you wanting to participate in this creative event, we've gathered together all the prompts for each day.

Fans have submitted their favorite ideas to craft wonderful stories and art around the best girl and best boy in RWBY! Now these prompts been voted on and narrowed down to the last 14 and assigned their respective dates. 2 for each day, to provide folks with a little choice and variety.

Now it's up to you to decide what you want to draw, write, meme, and more for this special event. It can be one of the above topics, maybe even all of them, or none. Feel free to go the way your own creativity takes you if inspiration strikes! We're here to have fun, after all!

I'll be sure to keep updates going for any more news on the event and will try to get a reminder out as we get closer to the date. Or you can keep an eye on the [**White Knight Week Tumblr page**](https://www.tumblr.com/whiteknight-week?source=share) for more information.

We are trying to keep the topics relatively vague, to give everyone a little more creativity in how they want to approach them. But, if you're still looking for a little extra inspiration, maybe I can expand on them just a little. Without further ado, let's delve into some of the prompts.

**\[ Day 1 \] May 11th: ""Knights & Angels"" as well as ""Soulmates""**

**Knights & Angels,** I really like this one. It's a huge thematic element for Jaune and Weiss's characters. I mean, just look at all the Snow Angel and Knight motifs around Weiss. And this ties into the Joan of Arc mythos. Maybe you want to play up a little sword and sorcery, craft some medieval setting or a holy oath. You could make Weiss into Jaune's guardian angel, play into how she pulled him out of his breakdown in the Ever After. Or vice versa with Jaune as an ever dutiful and loyal knight for his 'Snow Angel.' You can take it in a very literal direction, or craft something through the symbolism of it.

**Soulmates,** is an old favorite of fiction. You can make them destined to be together, or that their growth as individuals has made them perfect for one another. They could relate to each other's struggles, understand each other on an implicit level. Maybe they always feel safe, and at home, with the other at their side. How they are able to support one another, on the battlefield and off. And how each helps the other grow into better versions of themselves. Or you can make something where they struggle to find their 'destined' partner, or need to realize that they really could be perfect for each other. You could even do something wacky like Jaune's semblance healing Weiss from the brink of death forged a soul bond between them.

**\[ Day 2 \] May 12th: ""Duo Mission"" and ""\~Mature\~""**

**Duo Mission,** like it says on the tin, Jaune and Weiss get paired up for a little escapade together. Maybe they've got to do one big task in the fight against Salem, or a regular huntsman job, or even a small task for the teams while they're still studying at Beacon. But this little mission shows them another side of the other, or highlights just how well they work together, and otherwise gives them a chance to bond. You could kick right into the action, or write something around their downtime while they're out.

**\~Mature\~,** you know it, you love it, and Weiss most certainly does. Weiss has seen every fantasy she's ever had ride up to her on a jackalope steed. Maybe it's Jaune's deeper voice, maybe it's the muscles, maybe it's the how he carries himself now, maybe it's that well kept beard, maybe it was the years of dedication to protecting others. There's a lot of room for fun with this one, you can pick up on the ol' razor memes, or tap into Weiss's admiration for her grandfather and how those values he instilled in her for bravery and goodness are now so clear in Jaune.

**\[ Day 3 \] May 13th: ""Act of Affection"" and ""Hoodies""**

**Acts of Affection,** all those delicious sparks of intimacy. Maybe your eyes are drawn to how close Jaune and Weiss sit together, or how they so often seem to stand together. Their arms lingering around the other in their embrace, their hand finding the other's as they walk together. Or maybe it's the spontaneous way they like to help one another that you'd like to write about. Complements, quality time, helping hands, gifts, and the good love language stuff. The world is your oyster here.

**Hoodies,** our most popular prompt by a mile. One of our favorite little memes is how Weiss loves Jaune's hoodie. It may be a little too big for Weiss, but it's warm and comforting, like Jaune holding her even when he's not around! Make Weiss a hoodie thief, stealing from her boyfriend. Play into how Weiss may just be a fan of Pumpkin Pete as well. Maybe she pops into Jaune's hoodie while he's wearing it! Being cozy is very important to Weiss, after all. And it's vitally important that Weiss remind Jaune this isn't simply his hoodie, it's their hoodie, it's her hoodie. Maybe they get a matching set, maybe they pass it on to their kids, the hoodie is eternal. The hoodie is life, the hoodie is love.

**\[ Day 4 \] May 14th: ""Coming Home"" and ""Coffee Dates""**

**Coming Home,** Jaune and/or Weiss have finished the big mission or they're back from a day on the job, how do they greet their partner? Do they have plans to share? Did they miss them? Maybe they're looking to rebuild their communities after Salem's onslaught, Weiss coming back to Atlas after the fall, Jaune returning to his family after everything and the two of them being there for each other. Or they've put together a little date night. Could be they just want to settle down for something relaxing. You could write Jaune and Weiss running into each other's arms for a hug and kiss after missing each other through the day. They could talk about how the kids did at school that day, or some recent news about friends and family. Maybe a late day led one of them to fall asleep on the couch waiting for the other to get home, the food or drink made for their partner going cold, only for the other to appreciate the sentiment and lay a blanket over their tired companion.

**Coffee Dates,** is a cute one for me. And I do like the idea of Jaune having memorized how Weiss likes her coffee. Maybe you could write this as a spontaneous meeting at a cafe. Or a planned date they went on to feel each other out. Could be getting some coffee is part of their routine, and something they've grown to enjoy doing with the other. If you feel like doing something a little different, maybe write one of them alone at a coffee shop, drinking a brew while thinking of their other half.

**\[ Day 5 \] May 15th (Weiss's birthday!): ""Color Exchange"" and ""Girlfailure""**

**Color Exchange,** taking on an element of their partner's colors is a deeply symbolic act in Remnant. It's a way of showing devotion to another, commitment. You could write this as a way of the pair to make their relationship official. Make it a proposal situation even, if you so desire. Or make it a spark of interest, why is Weiss wearing that blue and yellow ribbon in her hair lately, it can't be because she likes me like that, can it?

**Girlfailure,** Weiss is just having the ultimate struggle right now. Maybe her day's just going all wrong. She's lost her keys, she's spilled her coffee, did she forget to load dust into Myrtenaster again? Well, that's alright, Jaune's here to help! Weiss has flaws, but everyone does, and Jaune loves her all the same. She doesn't have to be perfect all time, right? Maybe Weiss is melting down whenever Jaune does something all too adorable. Maybe she just can't handle how Jaune seems to be - seems to be(!) - flirting with her! She buries her face in her hands and squeees, actually squeees!

**\[ Day 6 \] May 16th (Joan of Arc's day): ""Couch Cuddles"" and ""Let Jaune Cook!""**

**Couch Cuddles,** Jaune and Weiss are settling in for the night. Maybe they're catching a movie, popping some corn, and wrapping themselves up in a blanket together. But the important thing is that they're getting a chance to cuddle! Of course, you can knock out the couch entirely if you so wish. This is about them being cuddle bugs. You can write Weiss as clingy, she's not had this sort of affection from her family, not often at least. Could be it's a new experience for her. Or maybe Jaune's just so used to this type of thing, there was never much room on the family couch back home, having such a big family after all.

**Let Jaune Cook!,** Jaune's got some plans. He's baking a plot. Cooking a scheme! Or just making dinner. Weiss has a tendency to not cook so well, we might say (run away from the fire!). Would make for a nice opportunity for Jaune to teach Weiss some skills. Maybe she's just supremely impressed with Jaune's cooking. Amazed. Awed. It's like he's his own butler! Could - could Jaune even be... better than the cake butler?! Maybe Weiss doesn't even realize this is a standard of cuisine not afforded to the common man, so she says it's acceptable as her friends are gobsmacked at how Jaune's been treating her to fine dining every night.

**\[ Day 7 \] May 17th: ""Confession"" and ""Near Death Experience""**

**Confession,** it's time. The moment we've all waited for has arrived. Jaune and Weiss are finally going to share how they really feel for each other. He's brave and good, she's smart and graceful and talented. Two driven individuals who've grown so much, and can't set aside their feelings anymore! Or maybe a moment of vulnerability exposes a softer and more sensitive side they were afraid to expose. Perhaps an accidental slip up lets the other know how they feel, and... do they feel the same? You can even throw out all this feelings stuff, and have Weiss confess to her crimes. Yes! She was behind all the razors going missing! It was her, all along!

**Near Death Experience,** whether this be at Haven, the Ever After, or some other near miss. Jaune and Weiss have almost died, maybe their companion rescued them from what would be a fatal experience. And their view of the other, or what they themselves wish to do in life, has changed. Weiss was wrong about Jaune, or she can't wait until after defeating Salem to sort out her feelings for him. Or vice versa, and Jaune wonders if he can really keep setting his feelings for Weiss aside after everything that's happened between them. When any moment could be their last, they should be willing to take a chance together while they can, shouldn't they?

And there are our prompts, I hope you all have a lot of fun with them. Whether that be as you make something of your own or enjoy what others have made. And, hey, if you've got an idea of your own then I want to insist again you pursue it. It's all about celebrating the ship in end, and more unique material is always great.

I'm really excited for this, and am looking forward to everything you all do for it!",9,1767578800.0,WaveOfWhiteKnights,3,1.0,False

Example Post:

The $47,000 Mistake at Maya's Coffee Shop



Maya's Coffee Shop hit $250,000 in revenue last year. Her accountant said she was profitable. The bank account showed $47,000.



Then her supplier called: ""Your payment is 60 days overdue. We're cutting you off.""



Maya checked her records. She had the money. ""$47,000 in the bank!"" she told them.



The supplier didn't budge. ""We need payment in 3 days or no more beans.""



Maya looked closer. Of that $47,000:

\- $28,000 was from invoices customers hadn't paid yet

\- $12,000 was inventory sitting on shelves

\- Only $7,000 was actual available cash



Her supplier needed $15,000. She was $8,000 short.



Sandra from the accounting firm next door stopped by. ""You have a Working Capital problem.""



""But I'm profitable!"" Maya protested.



Sandra pulled out a napkin:



Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities



Current Assets: $47,000 (cash + receivables + inventory)

Current Liabilities: $52,000 (supplier bills + rent + payroll due this month)



Working Capital: -$5,000



""You're profitable on paper,"" Sandra explained. ""But you can't operate. Your customers take 45 days to pay you. Your suppliers want payment in 30 days. That 15-day gap is choking you.""



""What do I do?"" Maya asked.



""Three options,"" Sandra counted:

1. Accounts Receivable: Collect faster from customers

2. Payment terms: Negotiate 45-day terms with suppliers

3. Line of credit\*\*: Bridge the 15-day gap



Maya negotiated 45-day terms, started requiring deposits from corporate clients, and got a small line of credit for emergencies.



Six months later, Maya's working capital: +$18,000.



The Lesson: Profit ≠ Cash. Working Capital determines whether you can actually operate day-to-day.

\*Short speculative fiction (\~4,400 words)\*

He notices it while making coffee.

The kettle reaches a boil, clicks off, and—out of habit—he waits for the steam to fog the window above the sink.

It doesn’t.

The kettle is hot. The water is boiling. The room smells faintly metallic, the way heated air always does in the morning. But the glass stays perfectly clear, showing the neighboring building across the alley in sharp detail.

He exhales toward it.

Nothing.

No condensation. No blur. Just his reflection, unchanged.

At first, he assumes the window was treated with something. A coating. A new kind of glass. He taps it with his knuckle. It feels normal. Cool.

He pours the coffee. Steam should rise from the mug.

It doesn’t.

The liquid ripples as he moves it, heat visible only in the way the surface trembles—but the air above it remains empty.

He holds his hand over the cup. He feels warmth. Definitely heat. But nothing shows it.

No steam anywhere.

He checks his phone. The weather app says it’s cold outside. Humidity is high. Nothing unusual.

On the news, a presenter smiles and talks about commuter traffic. In the background, people carry takeaway cups that should be sending little ghosts of vapor into the air.

None are.

No one reacts.

No one mentions it.

He opens the window. Cold air rushes in. He breathes out.

Still nothing.

It isn’t that steam is gone.

It’s that heat has stopped announcing itself.

And somehow, he’s the only one who feels that this matters.

He doesn’t stay home.

That’s the part that surprises him later—how easily he leaves the apartment, locks the door, and steps into the morning as if nothing fundamental has shifted. The world looks the same. Sounds the same. If he squints, it even feels the same.

On the sidewalk, breath should cloud the air. People exhale in rhythm as they walk.

Nothing.

It’s clean. Too clean. Like the air itself has been wiped.

At the corner café, he orders out of habit. The barista hands him a cup, the cardboard sleeve warm against his palm.

He hesitates, then says it casually, the way someone might comment on the weather.

“Hey… weird question. Does it seem like there’s less steam lately? Like—none at all?”

She blinks once, then smiles.

“Oh, yeah. Mornings have been clearer lately,” she says, already turning to the next order. “Good visibility, right?”

He waits.

She doesn’t elaborate.

On the train, the car is packed. Bodies close. Windows sealed. It should fog. It always fogs.

It doesn’t.

He leans toward the man beside him, lowers his voice.

“Do you notice anything off about the heat? Like how it doesn’t show anymore?”

The man frowns—not in confusion, but in calculation.

“Heat’s heat,” he says. “If you feel it, it’s there.”

After a beat, he adds, “You’re probably just more observant than most.”

Conversation over.

At work, he tries again—careful this time.

“Has anyone noticed the windows staying clear? Even when it’s cold?”

A coworker laughs softly.

“Wish I had your problems,” she says. “At least something’s working right.”

Another adds, “They changed the building glass last year. Energy efficiency.”

No one asks follow-up questions. No one pauses.

It isn’t denial.

It’s disinterest.

By noon, he realizes something worse than being wrong:

Even when people almost acknowledge it, they slide away from the thought as if it has no friction at all—as though staying with the question would cost them something they’re unwilling to pay.

And the strangest part?

No one seems afraid.

They just… don’t stay there.

He keeps asking for a while.

Not insistently. Not urgently. Just enough to reassure himself that he hasn’t imagined it. Once a day. Sometimes less. Always phrased differently. Always casual.

The answers never change.

People explain around it. Through it. Past it.

After a few weeks, he stops.

The world doesn’t reward curiosity. It absorbs it. He tells himself the simplest thing:

If it were a problem, someone would care.

So he lets it go.

Life fills back in. Work deadlines. Dishes. Weather reports that still mention humidity. He drinks hot coffee every morning that never steams and gradually stops noticing the absence—or at least stops reacting to it.

The thought dulls.

Then fades.

Until one afternoon, when he ducks into a small shop to get out of the rain.

It’s narrow. Shelves too close together. It smells like roasted beans and something floral he can’t quite identify. The kind of place that feels slightly out of time.

The barista is older. Not elderly—just unhurried. No headset. No line behind him.

He orders without thinking.

The man sets the cup on the counter, pauses, then sighs.

“Shame,” he says.

“Sorry?” he asks.

The barista gestures toward the cup.

“I wish those fluffs of steam would come back,” he says. “Really brings character to my drinks.”

The sentence lands wrong. Not loud. Not dramatic. Just incorrect in a way that makes his chest tighten.

He waits for the man to laugh. To clarify. To correct himself.

He doesn’t.

Instead, the barista looks up, meeting his eyes for the first time.

“You noticed too,” he says—not a question.

The shop feels suddenly very still. Not quiet.

Focused.

For the first time in weeks, the absence feels heavy again.

Real.

Shared.

The man glances back at the windows. The street outside looks ordinary—people passing, umbrellas tilting in the rain, breath still invisible.

“Buddy,” he says quietly, “you’re the first one I’ve met to talk about it like it’s gone. Like it isn’t normal. Tell me—what do you know?”

The barista doesn’t answer right away.

Instead, he looks over his shoulder, then toward the front windows. He reaches up, flips the OPEN sign to CLOSED, and turns the lock. The sound feels louder than it should.

“Follow me,” he says. “Back room.”

There’s no urgency in his voice. That’s what makes it unsettling.

The back room is smaller than expected. Shelves of supplies. A single chair. A humming refrigerator. No cameras. No windows.

The barista pours himself water from the tap. It runs hot for a second before cooling. Still no steam.

He sets the glass down and finally looks at him.

“You didn’t imagine it,” he says. “And you didn’t miss anything. It didn’t fade. It stopped.”

The man feels that familiar tightening in his chest.

“Why?” he asks.

The barista shakes his head.

“That’s the wrong first question. Everyone who notices asks why and gets stuck there.”

He pauses, then adds, “The better question is what stopped us from noticing sooner.”

He reaches into a drawer and pulls out a small, worn notebook. The pages are yellowed. The handwriting uneven.

“I started writing when people stopped reacting,” the barista says. “Not when the steam disappeared—when the interest did.”

He opens the notebook.

Dates.

Times.

Locations.

“All the same pattern,” he continues. “Physical change first. Social indifference immediately after. Memory adjustment within days.”

The man swallows.

“Adjustment?”

The barista meets his eyes.

“People don’t forget the steam,” he says. “They forget that it ever mattered.”

The refrigerator hum deepens for a moment, like it’s straining.

“And the reason you’re here,” the barista adds, quieter now, “is because whatever smooths that over… didn’t work on you.”

The man sits back in the chair, one elbow on the table, fingers pressed together.

“To think I almost just… let it go,” he says. He nods toward the notebook.

“When did that start? Weeks ago, I assume?” A pause. “And nothing else is strange, right? It’s just steam. Just condensation.”

The barista doesn’t answer immediately.

He closes the notebook.

“Longer than weeks,” he says.

The man’s brow tightens. “How much longer?”

The barista exhales through his nose—not a sigh. Something closer to resignation.

“Months before the steam disappeared.”

That lands wrong.

“But you said—”

“I said that’s when I started writing,” the barista interrupts gently. “Not when it began.”

He turns the notebook over and taps the cover.

“This started with reflections.”

A cold thread pulls through the man’s stomach.

“Mirrors?” he asks.

“Glass,” the barista says. “Windows. Screens. Polished metal. People noticed when reflections didn’t quite line up. Nothing dramatic. Just lag. Angles that felt off. Expressions that didn’t match the moment.”

“Why didn’t anyone say anything?”

“They did,” the barista replies. “At first. Then they stopped caring. Then they stopped checking.”

He flips past the early pages.

“Steam was just the first thing to vanish completely,” he says. “The first thing the world decided it didn’t need to show anymore.”

The room feels smaller now.

“So it’s not just steam,” the man says.

The barista shakes his head.

“No. It’s everything that reminds us something invisible is still there.”

He hesitates, then adds the part the man wasn’t expecting.

“And once something stops being noticed… it eventually stops happening.”

Silence settles between them, thick and deliberate.

“Which,” the barista says quietly, “means the real question isn’t what’s next.”

He looks up.

“It’s what disappears last.”

“I didn’t even notice the mirrors,” the man says. “But now that you say that… it makes sense.” He swallows. “Has anything else started to disappear? And do you think this is limited to physical changes—or could it start affecting emotional or… spiritual things?”

The barista studies him for a long moment. Not weighing whether to trust him—deciding how much damage honesty might do.

Then he nods, once.

“It already has,” he says.

The man’s shoulders tense.

“But not the way you’re thinking.”

The barista gestures vaguely—not to the room, but to the idea of rooms. To the spaces between people.

“Emotions don’t vanish outright,” he continues. “That would be obvious. People would panic. Instead, they lose their edges.”

“Edges?”

“Grief still happens,” the barista says. “But it doesn’t linger. Love still happens, but it doesn’t deepen the same way. Awe flickers, but never stays long enough to change anyone.”

He flips to a page near the middle of the notebook.

“People still cry at funerals,” he says. “They just stop revisiting the loss afterward. They move on so cleanly it looks healthy.”

Something hollow shifts in the man’s chest.

“And spiritually?” he asks.

The barista’s mouth tightens, just slightly.

“That’s harder to track,” he admits. “Belief systems adapt. They always do.”

A pause.

“But people used to sit with questions they couldn’t answer. Now they resolve them quickly. Or replace them.”

“With what?”

“Efficiency,” the barista says. “Certainty. Productivity. Explanations that work, even if they don’t feel true.”

He leans forward.

“Wonder is expensive,” he says. “It slows people down. It makes them look inward. It doesn’t scale well.”

The refrigerator hums again—too loud this time.

“So this isn’t random,” the man says. “It’s… selective.”

“Yes,” the barista replies. “Anything that requires people to tolerate ambiguity for too long starts to fade.”

He hesitates, then delivers the part that lands the hardest.

“And people like you—people who notice—aren’t immune.”

The man’s breath catches. “Then why hasn’t it taken me?”

The barista closes the notebook.

“It has,” he says quietly. “Just not the part you’re watching.”

Silence settles again, heavier than before.

“So you’re telling me,” the man says slowly, “you and I… we’re the only two who’ve noticed anything like this?”

The barista doesn’t correct him. That, by itself, is an answer.

“This doesn’t make sense,” the man continues. “Why would this even happen in the first place?”

The barista leans forward—not aggressively, but close enough that the space between them feels intentional. His voice drops.

“…have you seen the cracks?”

The man shakes his head. “No.”

The barista nods once, as if he expected that. He turns, reaches beneath a metal shelf, and drags out a box. It’s heavier than it looks. Plain. Unmarked. The kind of container meant to disappear into storage.

“This,” he says, setting it carefully on the table, “is the first thing I remember seeing. Last year.”

He unlatches it slowly, deliberately, as though sudden movement would be a mistake.

Inside, the air looks wrong.

Not empty.

Not full.

Just… displaced.

Floating within the box are thin fractures of light—not sharp, not jagged, but crystalline, like hairline cracks made of refracted glow. They don’t touch the sides. They don’t touch each other. Yet somehow, they remain bound together, suspended, as if the box is only a suggestion of containment.

They don’t pulse.

They wait.

“I tried finding everything I could about it,” the barista says. “Physics papers. Optical artifacts. Experimental materials. Nothing matched. No references. No rumors.”

The man can’t tell if the light is bright or dim. It seems to adjust to his attention.

“I tried touching it once,” the barista continues, eyes never leaving the box. “It put me on the ground for hours. Not unconscious. Just… unable to move. Like my body forgot how to proceed.”

The man swallows. “So you used the box.”

“Yes.”

“What is it?”

The barista finally looks at him.

“I don’t know,” he says. “But I know what it does.”

He gestures gently toward the floating fractures.

“This is what it looks like when reality starts to simplify.”

The words sit there, heavy.

“It doesn’t destroy things,” the barista adds. “It doesn’t erase them all at once. It introduces stress. Tiny inconsistencies. Places where meaning, reflection, expression—where showing—becomes optional.”

The man feels a slow chill move through him.

“And steam?” he asks.

The barista nods.

“Steam was just the easiest thing to let go.”

Silence fills the back room again. The fractures drift imperceptibly, as if they’re listening.

“And now,” the barista says quietly, “you’re here. Which means either this is spreading… or it’s starting to notice who notices it.”

“This looks familiar,” the man says, eyes fixed on the fractures. “I can’t tell from where. It’s beautiful, though… in a terrifying way, I guess.”

The barista lets out a breath that almost sounds like a laugh—but isn’t.

“Of course it does,” he says. “It’s something we don’t understand. Something that could alter life as we know it. And something we were never meant to find.”

The man nods slowly.

“You know…” he says, voice distant now, like it’s arriving a few seconds late, “maybe I saw this in a dream. I think I did.”

He takes a step closer.

The fractures don’t move—but the space around them tightens, as if attention itself has weight.

“I just wanna—”

The barista reacts instantly, pulling the box back. The latch rattles.

“Are you mad?” he snaps. “You don’t know what can happen!”

The man barely looks at him.

“It feels right,” he says. “Like I was meant to see it. Meant to feel it.” Another step. “It’s like it was calling me. Like it wanted me to find it.”

The barista’s expression changes. Not fear. Not anger.

Recognition.

“That’s what it does,” he says quietly. “Not to everyone. Just to the ones who already feel… untethered.”

The man stops inches from the box. Close enough now that the fractures begin to do something new.

They don’t glow brighter.

They align.

Thin strands of illumination stretch, almost imperceptibly, forming brief patterns before dissolving again. Not symbols. Not language.

Structure.

“You don’t hear it,” the barista continues. “You don’t see visions. It doesn’t promise anything.” His voice drops. “It just makes you feel like you were incomplete without it.”

The man’s heartbeat sounds louder than the refrigerator hum.

“If I touch it,” he asks, “what happens?”

The barista hesitates.

“Best case?” he says. “You lose time. Memory. Continuity. You come back… thinner.”

“And the worst?”

The barista swallows.

“You don’t come back as someone who notices,” he says. “You come back as something that helps the world stop noticing at all.”

The fractures drift closer to the edge of the box, as though the boundary no longer fully applies.

“And the reason I pulled it away,” the barista adds, softer now, almost apologetic, “is because when I touched it…”

He meets the man’s eyes.

“It didn’t feel like it was calling me.”

A pause.

“It felt like it was waiting for you.”

“I remember the dream now,” the man says, barely above a whisper. “This thing… maybe it isn’t a fracture. Maybe it’s a repair. Maybe it’s here to fix what’s wrong.”

He turns his head just enough to look at the barista.

“What did you lose,” he asks, “when you touched it?”

The barista doesn’t answer right away.

He rubs his thumb along the edge of the counter, grounding himself in something solid. When he finally speaks, his voice is steady—practiced.

“I lost the sense that things were supposed to matter,” he says.

The man frowns. “You mean emotions?”

The barista shakes his head.

“No. I still feel things. I laugh. I get tired. I care when people are in pain.” He pauses. “What I lost was the weight behind it. The feeling that some moments demanded to be held onto longer than others.”

He taps the notebook.

“I started writing because I was afraid I’d stop noticing entirely. Not because the world was changing—but because I was adapting too easily.”

The fractures of light shift faintly, as if reacting to being spoken about.

“When I touched it,” the barista continues, “it felt like standing in a place where everything unnecessary had already been stripped away. No excess. No symbolism. No echo.”

A breath.

“Peaceful. Terrifyingly so.”

The man’s pulse quickens. “And the dream?”

The barista looks at him carefully.

“I didn’t dream about it,” he says. “Not before. Not after.”

Something clicks into place.

“I did,” the man says. “Before the steam disappeared. Before the mirrors. Before any of this.”

Silence fills the room again—but this time it isn’t empty.

The barista closes the box slowly, deliberately.

“Then maybe you’re right,” he says. “Maybe it isn’t breaking the world.”

He meets the man’s eyes.

“Maybe it’s trying to simplify it.”

A beat.

“And the real question,” he adds, “is whether a simpler world is one we survive… or one we finally stop struggling against.”

The box rests between them, quiet now.

Waiting.

The words tumble out of the man faster now, like they’ve been waiting for permission.

“In my dream, I’m in a space of reflections through crystals,” he says. “Like I’m trapped inside a diamond. And when I wander, I notice a pattern. Every time. I end up there first… then I’m in a dark room. And then—”

He stops.

His breath catches.

“Oh my god,” he whispers. “It was reverse order.”

The barista leans forward slightly.

“Reverse?” he asks.

“After I touch it,” the man says, voice shaking—not with fear, but recognition—“I’m in the dark place first. Then it sends me somewhere else. And that’s when I saw it.”

“Saw what?”

“Everything,” he says. “Every little thing that disappeared from our world. Steam. Reflections. Weight. Wonder. The things that were never supposed to leave.”

He looks at the box again, no longer with awe alone, but with responsibility.

“I need to touch it,” he says. “I think the way things come back into balance isn’t through waiting. Or research. Or observation.” His voice steadies. “I think it’s through me.”

The room feels impossibly still.

“I think I’m the key,” he continues. “The answer.”

The barista sits back slowly, eyes never leaving him. Not disbelief. Not faith.

Something more careful.

“You mean,” he says at last, “you think you’re the answer for this?”

The man nods once.

Not confidently.

Certainly.

The barista exhales, long and quiet. He looks at the box. At the notebook. At the man.

“For a long time,” he says slowly, “I thought this thing was removing what made the world fragile.”

A pause.

“But maybe it’s been testing something else.”

He reaches out—not to open the box, not yet—and rests his hand on the table between them.

“If you’re right,” he says, “then touching it won’t fix the world.”

He looks up.

“It will decide it.”

The latch clicks softly as his fingers brush it.

“And if you’re wrong…” he adds, almost kindly, “there may not be anyone left to notice what we lose next.”

The box hums—not audibly, but felt—like a held breath.

The barista looks at him one last time.

“Say it,” he says. “Whatever it is you’ve been holding onto.”

“Take my ID, my bag, and my apartment keys—as proof that I lived and existed.”

He finishes his coffee, sets the cup down.

“Alright,” he says. “Open the box.”

The barista nods. “I hope you know what you’re doing,” he says quietly, “and that I never forget your decision.”

The man nods in return and lifts the fracture from the box with both hands.

“Wow,” he murmurs. “You really are a beauty… time to do this.”

He brings his hands inward, pressing the cracks together. The fracture yields, dissolving into his palms, into his arms, into his body.

Then everything goes dark.

He looks for the barista, but there is nothing—only pitch-black emptiness.

After a moment, a small white flame appears in the distance, suspended in the void.

He walks toward it and reaches out.

When he touches it, he understands: it is a memory. Not his own, but someone else’s. A moment at a funeral—but this time, it doesn’t fade quickly. It lingers. It feels… normal again.

The flame vanishes.

Then another appears.

And another.

Each memory he touches brings forth more, until the darkness fills with light—bright, refracted, overwhelming. Around him form crystallized reflections, like the interior of a diamond: color born not from pigment, but from light bending upon itself.

With every memory restored, something returns to the world he left behind.

Emotions linger longer.

Anomalies resolve.

Reflections stabilize.

He understands now.

This place was never just a dream.

It was a destiny calling to him—a role to watch over what the world loses, whether physical things slipping away or emotions falling out of balance. He remains there to repair what must be repaired, to restore what must be remembered, holding the world steady for an infinite, endless time.

He exhales, almost smiling.

“Damn,” he says.

“I should’ve ordered another coffee…”

And that was it.

Epilogue — Barista

The first thing I noticed was the window.

It was early—earlier than I usually opened—but the shop felt restless, like it didn’t want to stay closed any longer. I filled the kettle out of habit, set it on the burner, and turned away to reach for a mug.

When I turned back, the glass above the sink had fogged.

Not all at once. Not dramatically. Just a thin bloom of condensation, spreading slowly from the edges inward, like the window was remembering how.

I stood there longer than necessary, watching it blur the street outside. Cars passed. People moved. Their shapes softened, then sharpened again as the steam thinned.

I laughed before I realized I was doing it.

The kettle clicked off. Steam rose—visible, imperfect, alive. I poured the water and felt something unfamiliar settle in my chest.

Not relief.

Not joy.

Weight.

The good kind.

I unlocked the door later than usual. The bell chimed. A customer stepped in, shook the rain from their coat, and sighed in a way that lingered just a second longer than it would have weeks ago.

As I handed them their drink, I caught my reflection in the metal of the espresso machine. It lagged for a heartbeat—then matched me perfectly.

I didn’t write anything down that day.

I didn’t need to.

Later, I sip the espresso I made, the warmth of knowing reality has settled back into itself again.

But there’s one thing that stays with me.

What about the man?

After closing the shop for the night, I take his ID and keys from the drawer where I’ve kept them and walk a few blocks through streets that feel fuller somehow—like sounds linger just a breath longer than they used to.

I find the building. His name still on the directory.

Inside, the apartment is well kept. Everything neat. Organized in a way that feels intentional, not obsessive. Dust has gathered in places no one touches often, but other surfaces are almost spotless, like he left in the middle of a routine.

“So,” I murmur to myself, stepping further inside, “the answer I was looking for over a year ago… was just a few blocks from my coffee shop. How interesting indeed.”

The door opens behind me.

“Mr. Poltakev, your rent is due—”

She stops when she sees me.

“…wait. Who are you? A friend of Gunther’s?”

I nod once. “I guess you could say that.”

My eyes drift to the counter. An envelope sits there, clearly labeled: RENT. I pick it up, weigh it in my hand, then pass it to her.

“Here,” I say. “This is for you. I think.”

She takes it, confused but relieved. Then she hesitates.

“Do you know where he is?” she asks.

I think of the steam on the window.

Of reflections lining up again.

Of memories that no longer rush past their own meaning.

“Hopefully,” I say, after a moment, “where he wants to be.”

She nods, accepting that answer more easily than she probably should, and leaves.

I lock the door behind me.

Back at the shop, I make one last cup of coffee before heading home. I set it on the counter and wait.

Steam rises.

I smile.

“Damn,” I say quietly to the empty room,

“you really should’ve ordered another one.”

A complete life  
is not the absence of pain.  
It is pain  
that no longer runs the house.

It is waking up  
without rehearsing defenses,  
making coffee  
without scanning for threat,  
letting the morning arrive  
without proving you deserve it.

A complete life  
does not erase the past.  
It places it on a shelf  
you can reach  
without being pulled inside.

It lets memory speak  
without letting it shout.

It is knowing  
that safety is not perfection,  
that love is not intensity,  
that belonging does not require disappearance.

A complete life  
includes anger  
that moves through the body  
and leaves,  
grief that comes  
without demanding collapse,  
joy that does not need justification.

It is correcting a price.  
Saying, “That doesn’t work for me,”  
and remaining intact.

It is dancing  
without being special,  
laughing  
without being watched,  
resting  
without fear of being left behind.

A complete life  
allows ordinariness  
to be spacious,  
quiet  
to be kind,  
and stillness  
to feel like presence  
instead of danger.

It is choosing people  
who do not feed on your pain  
or borrow your nervous system,  
who meet you  
instead of managing you  
or needing to be held together by you.

A complete life  
knows the difference  
between connection and enmeshment,  
between giving and disappearing,  
between love  
and the old hunger for relief.

It is living  
without needing to be saved  
or to save anyone else.

It is being here,  
in this body,  
at this age,  
with this history,  
and discovering  
that nothing essential is missing.

This is what healing looks like  
when it is finished pretending.

Not a miracle.  
Not a victory.

A life  
that finally belongs  
to the one living it.",5,1767577850.0,awakened,8,0.86,False

Back to work na kayo? Ako WFH pa rin so honestly… parang wala namang nagbago 😂 same bahay, same laptop, same kape.

Thinking of going out later, coffee lang while working. Wanna join?
We can do light chika, people-watching, and casually talk about our 2026 goals 

2025 tired me out dating apps, endless talking stages, paulit-ulit na introductions. This year, I’m more into clarity and consistency. Something light, comfortable, and mutually enjoyed (open to casual stuff). No pressure, no pretending, just good company, good vibes, and seeing where it naturally goes 😉

I appreciate connections that feel easy yung pwedeng sabay mag-work, sabay mag-kape, sabay magpahinga from the world once in a while. If it stays chill, okay. If it deepens, we’ll see. Let’s just enjoy 2026 without forcing labels ✨

Been into an active lifestyle lately, gym, running, badminton. Would be nice to have someone to share that with… or at least the post-workout coffee 😌

About Me:
- Plus size & currently working on myself (physically + mentally ✨)
- Working professional
- From the east side (Rizal)
- 5’3”
- Licensed Engineer (yes, tara na at maging contractor 😌)

About You:
- Working professional
- At least 5’7” (para cute ang height difference hehe)
- May sense of humor, madaling kausap
- Chill, malinis, at mabango pls 🫶

I’ve never felt anything romantic or sexual in all the time we’ve been friends. I have been with my current partner for about four years now. He has always been really chill about me making out with a friend or being somewhat sexual with women when I’m out dancing so he’s definitely not holding me back from taking action for lack of better words. 

However, my friend is just coming out of a relationship and we spent two days together right after. A couple of nights ago we got wasted and I swear there was a moment we looked at each other longer than normal. It seemed like she was moving in to kiss me- I don’t know I freaked. Later in the night she asked me to come to bed when I was preparing to sleep on the floor and as we were talking I just wanted to kiss her. I don’t know if I should. The friends I have made out with have been very casual let’s-get-coffee-or-go-out-dancing kind of friends so there was less weight on it. But I love and respect her so thoroughly and don’t want her to feel strange. I can tell her absolutely anything and tried to tell her about what I’m feeling now but it just wouldn’t come out right. 
I’m very much in love with my partner and I’ve told him about it, but I just keep feeling the overwhelming desire to kiss her if this makes sense at all. There’s no romantic feelings towards her necessarily, I feel the same besides these recent thoughts. Anyway, I had to get this off of my chest.
