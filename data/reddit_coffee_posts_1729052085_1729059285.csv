From what I’ve read online, which my neurologist confirmed, adhd meds (stimulant and other)  can trigger migraines in people who get migraines. I have pretty severe migraines and have one 20-25 days out of the month, and generally for a full day each time, so I have hardly even entertained the idea of taking ADHD meds. Even decaf coffee triggers a migraine for me, and it does so rather quickly. But I’m in the second year of my PhD program and my ADHD symptoms are really negatively impacting me. I’ve always managed to get by, but having chronic pain has really exacerbated my brain fog and intention and reduced my cognitive load. I would love to get some relief with this, but I can’t afford for them to get worse. Does anyone with chronic migraine have experience taking stimulants or other ADHD medication?

I am 5""11"", well educated and I keep in shape with a mix of things like the gym, swimming and I like hiking now and again. Currently building out a campervan in my rav4 to travel and live in as I work remote so trying to make the most of it.
 
I am in a good place career wise, been pretty ambitious my whole life and worked pretty hard to get where I am now. Currently living in Alberta, moved here from the UK back in 2022. I travel to the states for work every couple of months as well. I do not really feel tied down right now where I live. I have done a lot of traveling in the past, did a roadtrip around Iceland and been to a few different states.
 
I would say I am a homebody at heart, I volunteer with cats in my spare time. Been addicted to OSRS again but I also like going out to eat, currently got back into reading at coffee places. I enjoy trying different cuisines as well and chilling on my sofa watching the odd show if I have not already spoiled it for myself already through YouTube clips. Tried a few different things in the past likes streaming, making my own video game on Unity but ADHD (officially diagnosed) stops me in my tracks after a bit. I have been seeing a therapist for quite a few months now to help improve myself. I also put a lot of effort making good food as well.
 
Looking for someone to share experiences with and just enjoy life, feel like I have reached where I need to be in life and I am ready to share that with someone. I am the kind of person that prefers a small group of friends but they are also the ones you can trust and talk too about anything. I enjoy social settings in small doses, I go through phases where I can be around groups of people now and again but other times I can stay at home for days on end and I would just talk to my cat instead if I had one.
 
I will say I am obsessed with cats but I am not a dog person.

30ml cointreau
Pour over ice into rocks glass
Top with sweet cream foam
Garnish with coffee beans

Sweet cream foam recipe:
30ml cream
15ml simple syrup or rich syrup
5ml licor 43
Combine and airate with electric whisk / frother.   
  
- you can replace the 30ml cointreau with a few sweet liqueurs. Baileys could be good here but I haven’t tried it.  
- this doesn’t have a shot of spirit in it because the transition from sipping the rich, sweet cream topping to an espresso/spirit/liqueur base was harsh. I consider affogato’s a very accessible desert cocktail so I felt the drink is elevated by removing the straight spirit like vodka.   
- the syrup used in the sweet cream foam will be the primary flavour so you can get creative with it.   
- you need to add lots of ice to the glass cor structure as it will be what physically holds the cream in place for a fall. Otherwise it can quickly fall into the drink. I filled this almost to the top with ice but it’s hidden behind the ingredients.   
- I did the 3 coffee beans on top but orange zest and grated cinnamon/nutmeg would be nice here.

This drink was also inspired by the mont blanc iced coffee which went viral in Australia a while ago. I thought it would make a good base for an affogato riff.",2,1729057595.0,cocktails,0,1.0,False

Our trip is coming pretty soon! We arrive in San Jose on 11/17. Looking for some advice on vehicle choices. I can scroll back to find a reputable company - I know it has been mentioned some cheaper options have hidden fees so I want to go with one that includes all I need. 

My question at this time - how likely is it we will need 4WD?? We are staying at Airbnb’s and one hotel. I plan to check the air bnb reviews to see whether they’re up a steep hill or something, but our itinerary is as follows: 

1. San Jose
2. Tortuguero 
3. La Fortuna 
4. Monteverde 
5. Playa flamingo (and surrounding beaches to explore - but this will be our “home base” in Guanacaste) 

We have no excursions planned yet because my boyfriend is very Type B and wants to go with the flow (my Type A travel self is screaming inside but it’s fine 😂). 

Hoping to go to a coffee plantation, heard something about the monkey trail? And would love any other suggestions for things to do. But my main concern is getting between locations - are the roads between these locations ok for a non-4WD vehicle or should I just bite the bullet and book 4WD just to be safe??

—------------------

User: Doctor Kvezzs, General Practitioner, Ex-Cattle Quality Specialist

Starting Date: None of your business

\[If you are reading this and you are not me I’m either dead or I’ve stopped caring.\]



\[LOG START\]



\[\*\*/\*/\*\*\*\*\]

\[War and Consequences\]

It’s been a year or two since the Dominion civil war ended and I continue to find myself struggling to get by. No one outside of my own species considers me a real medical professional and even my own kind only see me as a cattle doctor. I’ve performed countless surgeries and repairs on my own kind and cattle, keeping them both alive with no thanks even though they were hanging by a thread thinner than the sinew stuck in their teeth.



It doesn’t matter anyway, with the human’s donations and government subsidies I’ve barely managed to get by, nothing has really changed all that much.



\[\*\*/\*\*/\*\*\*\*\]

\[Pity Work\]

I was approached today by some of the leaders of the insurrection during the Dominion civil war. They are still working to release every cattle in our possession and there are not enough zurulian or human doctors to care for them, so they are looking into people from my profession, or ex-profession, to assist them.



I told them yes.



\[\*\*/\*\*/\*\*\*\*\]

\[Eyes\]

They despise me.

I can see it in their eyes, they hate me with every fiber of their being. They look at me as if I alone were the cause of all this. I cannot deny my part in it and I won’t say I wasn’t involved in this heinous practice but what else was I to do?

I kept them healthy, or as healthy as I could. I fed them Nutrient Paste, sewed up their wounds, tended to lost limbs, gave them antibiotics to reduce infection risk. I saw the worst of this necessity just like the rest of my peers. 

It is easy for someone to say they would never do something so horrible. Easy until they are met face to face with reality. Do what must be done, or accept your weakness and die.

They hate me.

\[\*\*/\*/\*\*\*\*\] 

\[Far and Few\]

I have noticed there are few of my kind here. For every one arxur there are a dozen others. I believe that others in my field of expertise, as few as we were, denied the call for aid.

More likely a call of desperation.

They are understaffed, overwhelmed, and overworked. There are hundreds of thousands of these ex-cattle, and there are only a couple hundred of us. 

My own peers do not look at eachother, we were never social creatures, but even less so with such grim work to be done.

The others look at me with disgust, and my own kind do not interact.

It is isolating.



\[\*\*/\*/\*\*\*\*\]

\[New Techniques\]

Today we had a seminar and training session. It was a good break from the grueling work of making creatures on the brink of death somewhat healthy again. We were trained how to attach new vat cloned limbs to those without them, and how to transplant organs. Unfortunately most of us Cattle Specialists already knew how to transplant organs, taking healthy tissue from ones that died to be transplanted into those that needed it. 

I feel most of us pretended this was new information to us, a smart move.

During the seminar one of the humans made an inappropriate joke about us eating the discarded limbs, he was escorted out of the room by one of the superiors.

At least that part was humorous.



\[\*\*/\*\*/\*\*\*\*\]

\[A Drop in the Bucket\]

This work is tireless, I can see it in their faces, their posture. Even though they wear those stupid masks. I cannot deny it, I am also exhausted. Surgeries day in and day out, through the night most of us are on call and are woken up at all hours. I think I may be developing Insomnia.

I can feel the weight of our actions, with every shuttle full of ex-cattle healed it is another drop removed from this bucket of misfortune.

This is our bucket, and one I must carry until it is empty.



\[\*\*/\*\*/\*\*\*\*\]

\[Pharmaceutical Fabrication\]

Due to a lack of shipments and medication we have had to begin fabricating our own medications. With the help of some engineers and herbalists we were able to set up a hydroponics garden to grow our own medicinal herbs.

It stinks.

The garden is very humid and makes my nostrils leak with discomfort. The others seem to enjoy going inside of it though, there have even been talks of allowing some ex-cattle to visit.

They might find it comforting.



\[\*\*/\*/\*\*\*\*\]

\[Exhaustion\]

I am officially diagnosing myself with Insomnia, I require no second opinions.

This work is miserable, but we have made great strides in righting our wrongs. The humans have started to welcome my presence more often. I believe they held reservations about how we would act around “injured animals”. Thankfully none of their worries came true, we are professionals afterall.

I heard one of the humans talk of fabricating a stimulant inhalant to help us stay awake since coffee is no longer cutting it for them. I cannot drink coffee as it is a plant based beverage. I envy the humans, I have heard pleasant things about this… coffee.

I will look into this stimulant.



\[\*\*/\*/\*\*\*\*\]

\[Convenience\]

I conversed with the other doctors and helped them fabricate the stimulant they were looking for. 

As it turns out many of the natural plants and roots on Wriss could be used in the fabrication of this miracle stimulant.

The ingredients were not hard to source.

We will start fabrication soon.



\[\*\*/\*\*/\*\*\*\*\]

\[Multitasking\]

Between the new wave of arrivals and constant care of those already here most of us have foregone sleeping for days on end, only occasionally getting naps between calls.

During this downtime many of us worked on fabricating the stimulant. We are close and hope it will temporarily solve our problems.

The supervisors do not know we are doing this.

Probably for the best.



\[\*\*/\*\*/\*\*\*\*\]

\[Stimulant Trial\]

We were successful in fabricating the stimulant, and we do not have time to test it.

Not in the traditional sense.

It didn’t take us long to aerosolize the liquid formed, the hardest part was refitting breathing cuffs to fit over the canisters. The canisters being tossed out disinfectant cans we scrounged by and punched a seal into the bottom of. Each one had to be hand filled but it would be worth it.

We hope.



\[\*\*/\*\*/\*\*\*\*\] 

\[Success\]

The stimulants are a success, I feel as if I no longer need sleep, even my appetite is suppressed. This was an unforeseen side effect but one I and I’m sure the others do not mind considering our circumstances.

I feel like I have finally sat down after an eternity of standing.



\[\*/\*/\*\*\*\*\]

\[Great Strides\]

It has been weeks since my last log entry, I have been keeping myself busy with caring for our ex-cattle patients. A sense of togetherness has started to form amongst some of us though they are still wary of what we are.

The ex-cattle look at us no differently than monsters, and begrudgingly accept our help at best, and at worst we work on the unconscious and catatonic.

It could be worse.

This stimulant is the only thing keeping most of us going. What is it the venlil say? 

“Thank the stars”



\[\*/\*/\*\*\*\*\]

\[Concerns\]

I’m sure I am not alone in my worries about this stimulant. I have started to lose weight, and my lack of sleep catches up to me faster and faster leading me to consume more stimulant to avoid falling unconscious.

I no longer feel the need to eat but I know when I should be eating. It is conflicting…

I have been awake for 6 consecutive days without rest, my back aches from standing for so long. This is still a boon, but has had unforeseen consequences.



\[\*/\*/\*\*\*\*\]

\[An Offer\]

I was approached today by one of the project leads, they received a transmission requesting one of our doctors to go on an expeditionary ship to colonize a new planet. I do not know why they chose me, but I was the one they asked.

I told them yes, I would like to think I’m doing this out of kindness but it’s selfish in nature. I’m too tired and can’t keep up this pace of work rehabilitating the ex-cattle

Maybe medbay life would be easier.



\[\*/\*\*/\*\*\*\*\]

\[Convenient Mistakes\]

I feel like there was a mistake with me becoming part of this ship's roster. I got to look at the message while doing paperwork for the transfer. “We require a predator doctor” It said, I assume they meant human predator, not arxur predator.

Either way, not my mistake, and I will use this opportunity to better my own future. I pack my things and leave tomorrow, not that I had many things to pack.



\[\*/\*\*/\*\*\*\*\]

\[Starboud\]

I’m still thankful for this stimulant, though I am afraid I may have formed an addiction. I take a puff at least once an hour now, and most of its stimulating effects have worn off but it’s all I can do to stay awake. My body aches, I may not realize how tired I am but my body does.

I have continued to eat but my rations are limited, they saw fit to only send me dried meat for my meals.

It is not very palatable, I would say this was an error but my nihilism tells me someone noticed the paperwork and is getting their small revenge against me.

  


\[\*/\*\*/\*\*\*\*\]

\[Strange Starfarers\]

We had an introductory meeting today with the rest of the department heads, they called it a…

“Meet and greet”

I found myself astonished that I was not only the head of the medical department but also I was the ONLY doctor aboard the ship.

The captain was by far the shortest specimen I had ever seen, I’ve seen children taller than him. The captain was utterly formal and polite to an extent that it caused my scales to crawl with discomfort. I did not enjoy the way he addressed me, it made me uncomfortable.

The security lead was far stranger.

He was a human from a moon called Titan, he appeared to have several invasive surgeries to replace and augment parts of his body. I could tell his arm was false, it smelled of inorganic parts and lubricants. Not that it was hard to tell by the amount of metal sticking out of his skin in places.

He was amicable enough but distant, perhaps part of himself was lost with all that machinery.



The engineering lead was far less welcoming.

He was a yotul, I haven’t seen many of those but he matched the description. He did not look at me directly, or wish to talk, not that I wanted to talk to anyone either. 



\[2/12/2138\]

\[I Miss Them\]

Today is the anniversary of my daughter’s disappearance and my wife's death. I would normally visit her burial site to pay my respects but I am in space, in a region unfamiliar to me headed to a planet far away.

I hope they can forgive me for not making it this year.",12,1729057439.0,NatureofPredators,3,1.0,False

We’ve had our share of problems. I’ve had a few trust issues that go back early in the relationship. In this recent fight, I found out he lied to me about a text he received from a female coworker. I was able to read the message before he did ( he was making coffee in the kitchen, his phone was in our bedroom) it wasn’t inappropriate what so ever, she was asking for the day off. But when I asked him soon after who had texted him he lied to me saying it was a male coworker. His excuse was that due to my trust issues, he was avoiding conflict. Just this past Sunday he had to leave for a work trip 3 hours away. It’s usual for his colleagues to have dinner and drinks while at these conferences. But he lied again. He called me to say goodnight at around 10pm and just today I found some atm receipts where he withdrew money at 11:05. He was supposed to have been asleep. After I confronted him he confessed they had gone for a few beers at a local bar. I feel he has completely checked out of our relationship. I don’t understand why he would keep lying when he has been given the opportunity to separate and be alone to do as he pleases. To be completely honest, he works for a small state agency in where his department is mostly men. I don’t feel he’s cheating, but his lies are destroying our relationship.

Especially when I'm severely depressed. most examples I looked up about positive reinforcement (adding something to reinforce a habit, or immediately rewarding myself for doing a habit) doesn't appeal to me.

* Awarding myself with money: I'm poor AF
* Candy/food treat: I have an ED. My relationship with food is incredibly stressful.
* Social approval: This may work, but I rather avoid external validation
* Treating myself to a nice coffee/tea/wine/beer: I hate all of these things and alcoholism runs deep in my dna
* Having someone hold me accountable: I plan on doing this anyway, but it's had to get an immediate reward this way if I can't get ahold of the person
* Promotion/raise/career improvement: Habit is not job related. and for my own sanity I'm not turning this habit into a side hustle
* Being able to use social media: I'm losing interest in social media, and it never improves my mood
* Getting to watch a TV show episode/read a book chapter: I have so little interest in shows nowadays, it's hard to get into anything new, or enjoy anything I used to like. I don't laugh or smile, I just feel frustrated or empty. I often quit after a few episodes. and I've been in the deepest book rut this year. I gave up after DNF-ing a dozen books in a row. I've gone through all my favorite authors' books (or they died). I don't like rereading books either even if I loved that book since I already know what's gonna happen.
* Video games/gaming: I don't like gaming all that much. I don't get hooked like most people do. I get bored or frustrated since I can't work a controller to save my life 
* Treating myself to a shopping spree/fun/luxury item: I'm poor AF and there's nothing I'm really desiring. No clothes, makeup, comics, gadgets, games, collectibles, toys, etc that'd make me excited.

He is self made, he works in real estate and is good at what he does. I have a strained relationship with my family. I’m from a more conservative background and men and women are treated differently. Men are usually given a lot of freedom while women aren’t. I get so deeply angry and frustrated by how differently I’m treated vs my other brothers. They are all successful, and have successful wife’s. My dad has said I’m a failure many times and it hurt but I got over it by saying it was just the heat of the moment and he didn’t mean it. However, this turned out not to be true since I heard recently he was saying that to someone, how my brother’s wife at my age was far more successful then I am.

1g4sa1r,https://i.redd.it/aku5sn0k22vd1.jpeg,Lost and Found,"It’s been 3 weeks since I last saw my sister. She’s been missing, officially, for 12 days but no one knows how long for certain. She went on a solo camping trip in the woods on Friday, March 8th. She was supposed to be back the following Wednesday but she said she might stay as late as Saturday if the weather was nice. So no one thought anything of it until Monday when she didn’t show up for work. 
  Sue has always been a little unpredictable. She’s the baby of the family and the favorite, so she practically gets away with murder. Especially after Mom died. They looked so much alike Dad just could never say no to her. And Sue knew it. She’d constantly push curfews and stay out late or randomly take off with her boyfriend for the weekend without telling anyone. Dad would just shrug and say “She’s a free spirit. Like her mom.” 
  When she was old enough to drive Dad got her this old Jeep for her birthday. The thing was a heap but it ran like a dream and she loved it. Once she had the jeep seeing her at home was a rarity. Any chance she got she’d take off for some outdoor excursion. Not always alone, but she didn’t wait around for tagalongs. If she got the urge she would act on it. She enjoyed the solitude, she was at home in nature. She told me once, “You can’t get closer to god than being alone in the wild.” Dad never worried. He grew up poor in a cabin in the woods that didn’t have water. They hunted and foraged for most of their food. Dad is a great hunter. He used to take us on these long camping trips all the time before mom died and he taught us everything he knew about hunting and wilderness survival. So he was confident Sue could handle herself. That’s the Dad side of Sue. They both have a connection to nature. She was an expert in the woods. She would regularly scoff at her friends for overpacking during their outings. 
“All I need is my hatchet, some matches, and my wits” she would boast. 
   She left for her trip Friday afternoon saying she was going about 3 hours west near the coast to this spot we used to go to when we were younger. Security cameras at a local gas station show her pumping gas at around 6 pm Friday night, about 50 miles northeast of where she was headed. That’s the last time anyone saw her. The camera footage was fuzzy but we could tell it was her because she was wearing her lucky jacket. This ugly purple windbreaker from the 90’s. It was our moms. Sue always wore it when she went camping. 
  Local PD organized a search party and they got started right away. The sheriff warned us as gently as he could not to get our hopes up. “There’s no telling how long she’s been lost out there and we’ve already missed the crucial 48-hour period for finding a missing person. Chances of finding her are slim and chances of finding her alive are even slimmer.”
  Dad was a wreck but he insisted they try. So they did. The whole thing was massive, way bigger than I expected. They organized hundreds of volunteers and they covered acre after acre, meticulously scanning every inch of terrain looking for something, anything that might lead to Sue. They searched for 8 days. They called in dogs and helicopters and didn’t find a thing. The Sheriff said there was a storm coming in and they’d done all they could. 
“We’ll keep looking if you want us to but we’ve exhausted every resource at our disposal and can’t risk more lives searching in the storm. We’ll have to wait until it passes to resume and by then there’s no telling the damage done by the weather.” The sheriff said bluntly 
  Dad said “No. I can’t take anymore. Between the media and trips to the morgue identifying bodies I can’t take anymore. Let these people go back to their families” he started weeping softly. 
  “You fucking coward” I growled at him. “How can you just give up on Sue like this?”
  “Hey, go easy son.” The sheriff said with a hint of compassion I hadn’t expected from him. 
  I turned on him. “I’m not your son asshole. This is my sister we’re talking about here. She’s out there somewhere and it’s your fucking job to find her.”
  The sheriff turned bright red. It was obvious that he was angry but he took a breath and spoke calmly. “As I just told your father, we’ve exhausted all of our resources. We’re doing our best but…”
  “Your best?” I cut him off. “Your best clearly isn’t fucking good enough. If it were you would have found her by now.”
  The sheriff sighed and spoke plainly. “Look kid I’m going to level with you here. The odds of finding her are next to impossible. We didn’t know precisely where to look in the first place now with the rain coming and washing away any potential evidence. There isn’t anything else we can do.”
  My anger began to subside at the realization that he was being earnest. “We can move the search south. We haven’t even looked in the area she was headed!” 
 “We pinged her cell phone 20 miles away from the campgrounds and we found her car less than half a mile from the phone. That’s the area we needed to focus our efforts. Anything else would’ve been a waste of time we never had to begin with.” He was starting to shout but he calmed himself and took another breath. 
“What if she crashed or something and went to the camp because we knew she was supposed to be going there?” I pleaded, grasping at any logic that might help my cause. 
“She didn’t crash her car.” He said “You know that. It was just abandoned. No signs of struggle and all of her belongings were there except her cell phone and her jacket. You attested to that yourself.”
“Yeah but listen, you don’t know Sue. She…” 
“No you listen!“ This time he did shout. “It’s been 8 days! Those woods are thick and she had no supplies. With the amount of time she’s been missing and the weather out there, not to mention the wildlife. There’s no way she made it through to the campgrounds. No one could survive that.” 
  “Sue could,” I said defiantly. “If anyone could it’s Sue. She’s a great rock climber, she knows first aid, how to start a fire, how to make shelter, she can hunt and forage. She could be out there still!”
  After a long pause, Dad finally spoke up. “No. It’s over.” He stood and his eyes met mine. They were starting to well up again. “The sheriff is right. It’s been too long. We can’t keep asking these people to devote all of their time to this. It’s not fair to tear them from their families in an attempt to fix ours.”
He sat back down and sunk his head. Just staring at his empty hands.
  “I’m not giving up on her. Mom wouldn’t. And she’d be ashamed of you if she were here.” 
  He didn’t look up. He didn’t even flinch. He just kept staring at those empty hands. I lingered for a moment hoping he’d look up at me. Hoping my slight would garner some response, anything at all. But it didn’t. He just kept his gaze fixed on his hands. I left the police station without saying anything. I was angry but I was determined. I was going to find my sister. 


  I packed a bag of supplies and I hitched a ride headed south. I started searching the campground where she was headed. It was a long shot but this was Sue's favorite place to camp so I figured I’d start there and go north and check the area between here and where the phone was pinged just to be certain. Asking anyone I saw if they’d seen anything, showing them pictures of Sue, and handing out missing posters.  No one had seen a thing. 
On the first day, I saw a couple with a small boy maybe 6 years old camping at a site near the entrance of the grounds. They were struggling to put up their tent. They were arguing with each other and were obviously irritated. I didn’t want to bother them but I couldn’t risk missing any information. I had to talk to everyone. 
“Hey folks! I’m really sorry to bug you but I’m…” 
“Can’t you see we’re busy?” The woman turned and screamed at me. “Yes. I’m sorry ma’am. It’s just I’m looking for….” I started to grab for a missing poster to show them but she interrupted again. 
“I don’t give a fuck what you’re looking for!” She roared. “It’s getting dark and we need to get this done so our kid has a place to sleep tonight!”
I was stunned. But I dared to try again. “I understand that ma’am I just need to ask you if you….” This time it was the husband 
“Dude! She said fuck off! We’re in the woods, so why don’t you take a hike?”
I stared angrily at him for a second and he straightened his posture like he was about to pounce at me. I held up the poster and his posture relaxed. 
“My sister,” I said flatly, all courtesy had left my voice. “She’s missing. I shoved the poster at him. I looked him in the eye and he looked away embarrassed. I stared for a second and then turned to leave. 
He called after me. “Hey man!”
I turned around ready for an altercation “Yeah?”
“I’m sorry. I didn’t know. We haven’t seen anything but if we do…” he held up the poster. “…we’ll give you a call.”
I eased up “Thanks.” 
I left and they returned to their task but they were no longer arguing. They weren’t saying anything. I passed their little boy as I left and shot him a smile. He was drawing a rainbow in the dirt with a stick. He looked at me blankly and pointed at the woods I was headed towards. 
“Billy Crandall at my school says that the woods are haunted. I told him about our trip and he said.”
I smirked and knelt down to talk to him. “I think Billy was just trying to scare you.”
“Not uh! He said his bother came here with his friends and they saw a ghost!” He assured me confidently. 
“Did they? Well you know ghosts can’t hurt you right?” I asked trying to put him at ease. 
“Really?” He asked intrigued by the notion. 
“Yeah, it’s true. They’re just lost people trying to find their way home.” I smiled then I thought of Sue and my smile faded. 
“Like your sister?” He asked as if he was reading my mind. 
“Yeah. How did you know that.” I was a little bewildered. 
“I just heard you talking to my mommy and daddy.”
“Oh. Right.”  Obviously. “Well see ya later kid,” I said a little shaky. “Stay where your folks can see you ok?”
“I will.” He said and went back to his dirt drawing 
“That was weird” I thought. I left but something didn’t sit well. I looked back and the kid looked up from his drawing. He smiled and waved jovially. I returned it. 
“I'm going crazy” I thought and continued on. 

After 3 days of searching I was starting to lose hope. Maybe the sheriff was right. Maybe there wasn’t anything to find out here. I was starting to consider giving up and going home. That’s when I ran into a group of campers walking down a trail out of the woods. 
  “Hey guys I’m looking for my sister. She was coming out this way to go camping by herself. She’s 24, thin, blonde and she was wearing this old purple windbreaker. This is a picture of her. Have you guys seen anything?”
  A tall guy with shaggy hair looked irritated. “Seen anything? No, we haven’t seen much of anything. We were only here one night and now we’ve gotta pack it up and go home 'cause apparently wittle wisa is ascared of ghosts” he said mockingly towards the girl behind him who was visibly shaken. 
  “Give it a rest Mark!” Another girl said while trying to console the quivering Lisa. 
“Lisa is it?” I said to her trying to keep my tone soft and even. “Lisa this is my sister Sue. She’s been missing for a while now and I’m very worried about her. Anything you can tell me would be really helpful here. What did you see out there?” 
   After some consideration, Lisa finally spoke without looking up. “I haven’t seen your sister. I didn’t SEE anyone. I heard…. Something.”
  “Wait. What do you mean?” I asked 
 “It happened last night right after we all went to bed. I heard something. I don’t know. At first, I thought it was someone laughing but it started getting louder and it was the same sound but now it was like someone was crying. I got up to check what it was and as soon as I stepped out of the tent it stopped. I was about to go back to bed when it started again. It was so loud like screaming and it was all around me but there wasn’t anyone there. Then…then….” She trailed off and started crying again. 
  The girl consoling her, Sarah, continued where Lisa had left off. 
“We found her this morning down by the creek. She was just curled in a ball crying. It was an hour before she could tell us what happened. “
  “She’s just doing it for attention! No one else heard anything last night. God, this happens every time! Poor wittle Wisa has to make it all about her and spoil everyone’s good time!”
  “I said shut up Mark!” Sarah snapped back. “We ALL voted and decided to leave and bring Lisa home.” 
  Mark huffed, “Whatever.” And continued down the trail. 
 Sarah looked at me apologetically, “I’m sorry about that” she said with a glance towards Mark. “We haven’t seen anyone else out here. But we’ll keep our eyes open on the way back to town.”
  “Thanks a lot. Here!” I said reaching into my bag for a missing poster. “Take this. If you see anything please call the number at the top.” I tried for a smile but couldn’t manage it. 
  As I started back up the trail Lisa grabbed my arm. She was small but she was strong. I turned to look at her and I was met with her teary eyes wide and full of fear
  “You can’t go up there!” She pleaded, her grip on my arm tightened. 
  “I have to. I have to find my sister!”
I think she could see that I was determined because her grip loosened a bit when I said it but she still had that scared look in her eyes 
  “Just. Be careful.” Her gaze shifted to the woods behind me. “There is something out there. Something in the dark.” 
  I pried her hand from my arm and held it gently. I said “I’ll be ok. I can handle myself out here.”
  She chuckled, exhausted, with no amusement. “Just be careful.” She repeated softly as she began to slowly weep again. 
  “I’ll be careful.” With that, they turned and met their group headed back down the trail. Something inside me said I should keep going. It felt off but it was so strong. So I continued on. 


I hiked for a couple more hours and didn’t see anyone else. 
“I guess the recent weather was more than most folks can handle.” I thought to myself 
The sun was starting to set when I came to a small clearing and collapsed. I was exhausted and defeated. I couldn’t stop the tears from coming. 12 days she’s been missing (officially) and I still hadn’t found anything. Maybe I was crazy. Maybe the sheriff and dad were right. There’s no way she could’ve made it this far. Maybe she really is…*sigh*. I pushed the thought away
“Alright, it’s too late to do anything else tonight. I’ll camp here and push a little further and if I don’t find anything useful by midday I’ll pack it in.”  I said aloud, bargaining with myself. 
So I made a fire and set up my tent. I finished just as the sun had finally set. I had a quick dinner of canned beans and then I was off to bed. I put out the fire and started making my way into the tent. Just then there was a rustling from the trees to my right. I stood straight up and looked in that direction but it was hard to see anything in the dark. I could almost make out the silhouette of a woman but the figure was too tall. My eyes must be playing tricks. What Lisa said must have gotten to me. As I strained to focus on the strange figure in front of me there was another rustling in the trees behind me. I turned around as quickly as I could. Nothing there. 
“I’m just being crazy. Scaring myself with ghost stories. It’s time for bed.” As I was getting in the tent something brushed past me. I whirled around and still, there was nothing but darkness. 
“Ok, I’m really starting to lose it. There’s nothing there.” I halfheartedly tried to convince myself. I got in the tent in a hurry and zipped it up quick. I went in my bag and grabbed a flashlight but I didn’t turn it on. My instincts told me not to announce my location. 
I just laid there for a while gripping the flashlight trying not to think about anything. I started to drift to sleep. 

I couldn’t have been asleep more than ten minutes when the rustling started again and woke me up. It was coming from both sides of the tent now. Still gripping the flashlight I decided to pop my head out and see what was going on. Now armed with my trusty flashlight my confidence began to return and my nerves started to settle. I’ll poke my head out, shine the light, and see nothing but the wind dancing through the trees. Easier said than done. Slowly I reached for the zipper of the tent. Determined to prove it was all in my head but still cautious just in case. I pulled the zipper up as quietly as I possibly could, just enough to fit my head and the flashlight through. I turned the light on and looked to my left where it had started originally and… nothing. I looked to the right. Nothing. Just the wind after all. 
 A mix of relief and embarrassment washed over me. I turned off the flashlight and started laughing at myself as I zipped up the tent. Still laughing softly I lied back down. Then, another laugh, but not my own. It was quiet but it was there, faint yet so familiar. I knew that laugh. SUE! I jumped up and flew out of the tent. Fumbling to get the flashlight back on I was spinning in every direction. 
 “SUE! SUE! Where are you? It’s me! Come on Sue! Tell me where you are!” There was no one there. 
But the laughing continued. It started to fade as if it was running from me. Reason gone, I ran into the woods after it. The only thing on my mind was Sue. I don’t know how far I had run but it wasn’t long before I started to tire. When I started to slow the laughing got louder. 
“SUE! Where are you, Sue? SUUUE!” I shouted into the darkness. 
Then it stopped. I fell to my knees and wept. 
“Oh, Sue! Please! Just tell me where you are!”
I looked up and saw the moonlight glinting off of something on a tree close by. I shined the flashlight over it and my heart sank. There, hanging tattered on a branch was Sue's lucky jacket. I ran to it and scoured over it. It was definitely Sues. She’d written her initials on the tag. But there was something new. Something dried on the inside. It was blood. 
I held the jacket close and started to cry again. Then the laughing resumed. But it was different somehow. Now it was like crying. And it was much louder. And closer. It was coming from everywhere. It was all around me. Mocking me. I shined the flashlight back and forth frantically and found nothing. Just the trees rustling. The trees. It was coming from the trees! It was like the trees were howling at me with Sue's voice. That’s when the flashlight went out. I tried manically to get it to work but it was no good. I got up to run and that’s when I saw it. A set of eyes. Glowing red right in front of me. I can’t be certain about anything after that. I was so scared I don’t remember how I got out of the woods and back to the trail. But I remember those eyes. They didn’t seem to be attached to anything. No body, no face. Just those horrible glowing ruby-red eyes staring at me. Through me. Into the depths of my being. Then a growl. Not like the faux Sue howling from the trees, all around me. No. This growl was from inside. A thought in my head that wasn’t my own. No words. Just a deep angry growl. A warning. It said without speaking. “She belongs to us” 
  I couldn’t take anymore. It was maddening. I had to escape. I had to be gone from that darkness. I dropped the flashlight and Sue's jacket and ran. I wasn’t thinking about where I was going or what direction I was headed. I just ran. Then I blacked out. 

When I woke up it was still dark out in spite of the sun starting to make its way over the hills in the distance. There was a man there. Startled at the sight of him I jumped up and scrambled backwards. 
“Woah! Easy fella! Yer safe now.” He said trying to calm me. 
“who. Who are you? Where am I?”
I asked. My head was swimming. I felt dizzy and I fell back against a tree. I shuttered at the feel of its bark and turned around backing slowly way towards the man. Not taking my eyes off the tree. 
“It’s ok yer safe now.” He repeated, confused by my demeanor. “My names Gerald, friends call me Gerry. I was camping down a piece with the missus” he pointed down the hill. 
“I got up fer my morning glory and heard ya screaming up the way.” He pointed back up the hill towards the trees I had run out of. 
“Ya were babblin! Screaming bloody murder down the hill. Ya kept hollerin’ ‘I’m sorry Sue! I’m Sorry Sue!’  Then ya collapsed here. I was gonna take ya down to the camp but I didn’t want ya frightenin’ the missus. Weak heart ya know.” He looked me over carefully. “Who’s Sue?” He asked cautiously
I was still groggy. I said distantly, still trying to get my bearings on reality. “Sue? Sue. Sue was my sister she went missing a few weeks ago.”
“Oh.” He said with a tinge of regret for the question. “Well, yer safe now. Ya can take yer time and collect yer self. When yer ready come on down to the camp. The missus is brewing some Joe. Cupa Joe’ll do ya some good.” Then he made his way back to his campsite. 
“Thanks,” I said weakly after him. 
When I was certain I wasn’t dreaming I stood up and looked around. The trees were still. There was no more howling. I broke down again and started crying. “I’m sorry Sue. I tried. I’m so sorry.” 
After a while, I wiped my face and headed toward the man’s camp. The smell of coffee was so soothing my eyes started to water again. 

I caught a ride with the couple back to the sheriff's station. I didn’t bother going back for my stuff. I just wanted to be out of the woods. I slept most of the way to the station. The man told me I kept whispering “I’m sorry” while I was asleep. When we got to the station I thanked the couple for their help and they drove off. The sheriff met me at the door
  “Well well. How’d the search…” he got quiet when he saw my face. 
“What happened?” He asked sullenly. 
“I’m not sure. I found… something. But it wasn’t Sue.” 
“What was it?” He asked. “What did you find?”
“I don’t know. I can’t explain it and you wouldn’t believe me. All I know is, that Sue really is gone!” I cried again. 
He grabbed me and pulled me in for a hug I didn’t expect “I’m sorry son.”
“Me too. I’m sorry. I’m sorry Sue!” 

Sue's body was never found. No one knows for sure what happened to her. I can’t be sure of what I saw in the woods that night. I told the sheriff everything that happened. Every detail. I didn’t want to but he insisted. They searched the area, they found my campsite and even found my flashlight. He said it was working fine when they found it. They never found her jacket. 
I can’t be sure it wasn’t just one big nightmare but if it were how’d my flashlight get out there? I don’t know. I try not to think about it. I moved to the city after that. The thought of trees surrounding me still gives me the chills. It didn’t help much. A little but not much. I still see those eyes sometimes late at night hiding in the darkness. And sometimes I can still hear Sue howling in my nightmares, alone in the dark. ",1,1729057128.0,u_SpeedMcLightning95,0,1.0,False

I was mortified and rather pissed off, so I told her to it was a fucking tank top, and if I wanted to show him my tits, I would just do this, and  pulled up my shirt and flashed him my bare breast. 

I immediately realized what I just did and got insanely embarrassed and high tailed it to my room. I instantly heard her got to the guest room, and withing a few minutes I heard their suite cases being wheeled down the hallway, and the front door slammed. I immediately called my husband crying, he soon was crying too, crying from laughter.

I feel terribly, but this lady has always tore me down and has always been hateful towards me for no reason other than the fact I took her little baby boy from her. 

I know I went over the top crazy, but she has been pushing me there for over 20 years.

Wake up, Africa! While our startups soar and our innovators dazzle, a poisonous mindset festers within. Some of our own still cling to the rusty chains of Afro-pessimism, parroting the very stereotypes that have suffocated our continent for generations. But why?

From Nigeria's fintech revolution to Rwanda's agricultural drones, Africa's potential blazes like a wildfire. Yet these naysayers – our homegrown Uncle Ruckuses – wallow in shame, questioning our intellect and echoing white supremacist rhetoric. They insist Africa is doomed without Western saviors. Nonsense!


This defeatist mentality isn't just lazy – it's downright dangerous. It strips us of our agency, feeding a global narrative that salivates at the thought of a helpless Africa. But here's the uncomfortable truth: Do some of us secretly crave pity? Are we addicted to being ""saved""?

It's 2024, for crying out loud! Wake up and smell the coffee!

Resilience, Innovation, Independence: The Real African Story

The evidence screams against Afro-pessimism. We're attracting billions in startup funding, leading in sustainable energy, and birthing world-class tech hubs. Even Ethiopia, once synonymous with famine, now flexes its muscles in telecom and manufacturing. Yet some of us still whisper, ""We can't stand alone.""


When Africans shame each other, we become our own worst enemies. We're not just wounding our pride; we're sabotaging our future. It's time to own our narrative – successes, failures, and everything in between.



Yes, Africa faces challenges. But Afro-pessimism is a toxic, self-fulfilling prophecy. It's time to silence the cynics and amplify the voices of African innovation.

Africa doesn't need saving. It needs the doubt-mongers to step aside and let the believers lead. Stop mimicking white supremacists and start writing our own story – on our own terms.

The future of Africa is ours to claim. ",3,1729056276.0,AfricaVoice,1,0.8,False

1g4s0zz,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomenDatingOverForty/comments/1g4s0zz/listen_to_men_when_they_tell_you_how_they_feel/,Listen to Men When They Tell You How They Feel About Women + Dating App Tip,"I just read the excellent post about specific date invitations, and now I hesitate to post mine because, well, it's just less of a fun read, and it’s more content that's rooted in My Feminist Crap (and admittedly, when I get into ""the nature of men"", I often feel the judgment of the separatists on those of us who date men but also...while I embrace declining to date men as a chosen, valid path, I'm not convinced that total and absolute separatism is necessarily what needs to happen, to get to where we want to go...but I digress). Still, I spent some time on it so, I hope it can inform, nonetheless. 

Two things on listening to men when they speak freely on how they feel about women:

1: I'm here to get into about how coming to grips with and acceptance of male nature, of the sheer amount of them that on some level don’t see us as people, is fundamental…not as some “Men Are Trash LOL” oneupmanship female bonding exercise that misogynists think it is (because that’s the most of their worries, right? dominance, homosocial trash talking, competition). But so you’re not the Shocked Pikachu face later when you find yourself in a harmful situation.

Granted, there is a whole spectrum- everything from criminal predators to >>>those reacting to our outspokenness (about mental load/weaponized incompetence/the disproportionate amount of male violent offenders/etc.) via ripping off their mask and saying “You know what? We’ve always hated you” all the way to >>> those who would *never* say such a thing...but have their moments where they do see you as an object in the sexual context and/or simply in how well you function, along the lines of an appliance (and to be real, most of you are going to get the last option at *best*, and let’s just hope he’s aware of this tendency derived from a mix of biology and male socialization, *and* is actively working to change his thought process…AND is advocating for all women- hot or not- alongside you…not to score points, but because it’s the right thing to do).

But, the fact of the matter is, even if it’s just dribs and drabs, it’s there, yes, even in *your* Nigel. There are male behavioral patterns here. Is it literally every man? No. But it’s enough to where, much like you want to bring bear spray to places where you know there will be bears, you want to be armed with the knowledge of male behavioral patterns, and caution when dating. Side note: this sub is one of few that is so good at not only naming patterns, it also advises on how to respond to them. And we know they are patterns, not isolated incidents due to ""she chose wrong"", when there is a chorus of ""Me too!"" in response to those posts. And again, that is because these patterns run *deep*.

But how do we react to exposure to the patterns? I feel like there needs to be a balance between acceptance of reality, but also managing emotions around it.

One creator I follow, who posts examples of these patterns, has a boatload to mine from, because the truth is that a whole lot of men are reckless enough to advertise the darkest parts of their nature- not just as individuals, but collectively (watch not just who is posting and how, but how *other* men are reacting to it! Are they agreeing? Remaining silent? Doing anything but protesting the content in these spaces?). In my view, it's so important to *listen* to the men. Because this is actually a gift. Wouldn’t you rather know a truth that hurts but that ultimately sets you free, than lose precious time to lies and “trying to figure him out”?

However, I was thinking about how the creator I referred to may be toeing the line of rage baiting, encouraging an emotional reaction. As you would expect, the women reading, as usual, get really, really mad when seeing these posts. And I think that when they're so whipped up, that feeling becomes intolerable, upon which they liken misogyny to a virus they may get, but there is a good chance they won't, so you know, be careful, but probs be ok. I.e. assigning this kind of thing to right wing men (the account attracts lefties of course), to create some sort of mental separation (oh and men on the left totally capitalize on this btw). When women don't take in this stuff in a levelheaded way, the hurt is so unmanageable that they trend towards boxing in misogynists as ""not MY guys"" because the rage makes it too painful to admit, ""hey, maybe...a lot of my guys?"". And then they just don't take all this as seriously when it comes to men that *they* know and like. And I don't think that's good.

I caution against not recognizing that these patterns run deep through male nature no matter *where* they fall politically, and no matter how much you don't want it to be someone close to you. I liken the pattern to an ailment I do indeed have, and knowing something is not quite right, but having doctors gaslight you for a good long time (and gaslighting yourself for a good long time) that it’s not that bad or it’s in your head…and then the utter relief that comes when some doctor comes along and says yes this is real, you’re not imagining it, this is your diagnosis. Now, this diagnosis can be a painful revelation. So too with recognizing patterns in male nature. And I think every woman needs to cry and rage it out to a *point*- you were lied to your whole life after all, your suspicions were minimized to protect men. 

But I don’t encourage staying in that place of despair and, I use this in the most compassionate (not weaponized) way possible…bitterness. It’s not that it isn’t justifiable/you don’t have a right to feel that way! It’s that it either a) causes you to create a mental separation and not take the issue seriously or b) you come to full acceptance and can't get out of the negativity which then eats at you, and I simply don’t think this target is worth that energy in perpetuity. This is a lifelong condition, but it can be managed. Thank your feminist predecessors that, worst case scenario, you can, in fact, leave when you want (but we also need to fight to *keep* such rights and not assume they're written in stone).

Grieve, and then come to acceptance about the ailment, and then decide on a treatment plan. For some, it is total abstention- and to live *happily* single- because it is not worth all the energy it takes to maybe find a needle in a haystack. That is valid. But this is a dating sub, so yes, many would still like to try to give it a go, anywhere from remaining totally emotionally detached and dating solely for the purposes of personal advancement/resource acquisition (Shera7 style), to hoping you’ll find an at least tolerable exception, who is working on his instincts and recognizes when his thoughts are gross. I am not living as a separatist, and so I have no right to deem that conclusion as anything but also valid (although I personally recommend the emotional detachment/""how can he level up my life"" approach, for tangible benefits from these ventures…at worst, if you do “fall in love”, to still always have enough of a foot out the door and your ducks in a row so you can leave if you have to. Ceding total control to a man, no matter how sweet he is, may feel good, but treat this temptation like a hard drug- it is simply unwise to indulge in this as an everyday lifestyle).

However you proceed, come to accept- *again, in a detached manner*- that most men have some form of perversion and inclination towards not seeing women as human beings, but tools. Maybe you’ll never get a front row seat to your man’s dark side. However, if he grew up in a society, it is likely there. Know what you’re dealing with, should at any point he fails to adequately manage that darkness- you are likely smaller, weaker, less aggressive, and less sexually motivated, so your safety depends on it. And from a simple heartache standpoint, it will save you so much in your emotional bank account (which- like your money bank account- is not unlimited funds).

2: How all that translates in apps: I don't recommend them but I know many lurking are doing it, so, here's one practical application of learning male nature, The Dating App Version! (Don't take the tip if you're not dating and/or are already fully awake to the nature of men and are still in that emotional stage)

Reminder: OLD men are men you don't even have common connections with. And they are presenting a version of themselves there that will hopefully get a woman to talk to them (or at least not kicked off the app). Often we find the same men on all the apps, and guess what? One of these is a handy little app called Feeld, that does not discourage men in the least (aside from sexually explicit photos, which they are not allowed to post) from letting it all hang out. It’s actually celebrated. I suggest using this to your advantage if you still need convincing on male nature, and create a burner account to lurk. Here’s a perfect example of undisciplined men recklessly advertising their true nature, on a forum to put it out there on. Again, being in a right or left wing area (like me) is not going to make this venture any more pleasant- it spans the political spectrum. Age, race, looks, no matter. 

I'm not talking about weird but fairly benign kinks like balloon popping or whatever. I'm talking about a common thread of dudes seeking to use women in dehumanizing and physically and/or psychologically dangerous ways. The underlying theme? Men seeking power, from women, because I guess they just can't get enough. In this space that's supposedly for any and all fantasies, you will not see a single fantasy about deferred power in exchange for later, more sustained gains at best and at the very least, deferred power that acknowledges the value of getting acquainted with a charming, polite, intelligent, gracious woman looking her best for an evening. You won't see anything like taking a woman out that doesn't know him yet for a nice dinner date that he planned, arriving with flowers, learning about what she cares about, and then saying goodnight with a sweet kiss, ensuring she returned home safely (Oh God no, equitably matching her own investment, how embarrassing!). But, you may see someone you matched with/went out with in the past. I did!

Feeld Report: A gent that I went out with a couple years back, and we had a lovely dinner in a beautiful setting. I did not go out with him a second time, because he got the sense that I wanted to be courted, and I got the sense that *he* found courtship to be an embarrassing chore, even with a lovely, interested, put together, intelligent woman like me. Because even with all of those positive qualities, (in hindsight, I now realize) intimacy with me was probably going to be far too vanilla for his tastes to be “worth it”. In retrospect, thank God I blocked him.

For any under-40s lurking who don't know already...that old adage about how ""older men are more mature""? This man is 54. Old age is not far off, and to be frank, in his profile he’s also not what I would consider the picture of health. He might want to prioritize a woman with good character who will stick it out for the tough times. But damned if he isn’t prioritizing, and I quote:

“dd/lg, breeding, [insert over a half dozen more kinks here], free use, cnc…”

I will stop there. This man who has had decades to educate himself and really examine why in fuck his brain is so fixated on domination (over a smaller being of a historically oppressed class), has instead created a whole ass public profile where he proudly listed all that shit out. The best I can say is there was nothing there that involved out and out violence, but who knows, it’s probably on the roster, and he just doesn’t want to get kicked off the app. He attempted to soften it with some sweet talk about cuddling and raising farm animals so we would see he he’s just a big ol’ Daddy bear, but at that point it was akin to spraying Santal 33 on unlaundered diabetic socks. 

I sat across the table from this man, who took me to dinner on the first date and was nothing but charming. Yes, I suspected in text after the date that this guy wasn’t into being a gentleman for the long haul, but I had no. f’ing. idea. how bad this was. This is not me saying don't bother with dinner because they could be trash anyway. This is me saying that dinner (or another well-thought out investment of a date on his part) should be the bare minimum, because if he's carrying stuff like this- and there is a good chance he is- at least you had a memorable meal or activity or whatever (and if he can’t be assed to politely converse, news flash! you CAN get up and leave in the middle of dinner!), rather than a forgettable cup of bean juice. In my mind, if a man is taking you to coffee, and writing lazy one word replies, because he finds the whole idea of courting you to be nonsense, I consider this an even *stronger* indication of him being likely anxious to skip to….you being a volunteer sex appliance (oh and for the record, sex workers charge more for this kind of play, and these guys know it). Again, the guys on Feeld are *also on the other apps*...it's just here, you get to see backstage. Don't linger too long, don't hate scroll. Look just enough to fucking *get* it, take a breath, and go about your day.

And that is my diatribe about the nature of men. 


TL;DR

a) LISTEN to men when they’re telling you what they are and how they fantasize about treating you 

b) limited amounts of time in places like Feeld where they speak freely (and often not anonymously) about what they are- yes it may be unpleasant but, better to tour the backstage, the scenic shop, all of this production you will potentially invest in, and know what will be expected of you as an investor, than simply sit pretty during sales pitches with stars in your eyes, fool

c) if you are too disgusted by what you see, yes, log off, grieve, get it all out, then let it go, detach, and decide how you will proceed

d) I’m not saying “don’t date men” on a dating sub, but go into it sober, and being courted/treated with your value in mind is the bare minimum. He should be an add value to your life, conscious of misogynistic impulses, and care about the eradication of such harmful perspectives from a cultural  standpoint as much as you do. For ALL women, not just the hot ones/the ones he benefits from. If a savvy businessman who deeply cares about climate change would only invest in companies with those values, why would you not do the same in your personal life with *your* values? 

Invest wisely. Time is the resource you cannot get back. I hope my own time was well spent in writing this, and that at least one woman benefits. And good luck all, whatever road you take.

1g4rtt6,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1g4rtt6/my_husband_apparently_has_been_having_an/,My husband apparently has been having an emotional relationship with a cabin crew for 4 months and I just found out. ,"Husband is a pilot working in the Middle East. He’s been based there for 8 years. We have two children. The children and I live in our home country. When we came for a visit I was ordering food on his food app and I noticed 3 transactions that were deliveries to another address. One for food and two others for flowers. When I asked him initially he said it was for our apartment then he confessed that it was for a lady he has been talking to. 

He claims that he is quite lonely and all they did was talk. I went through his uber app and saw multiple trips to the same address - at all times of the day. He claimed that all he did was take her out for coffee, lunch, dinner and go for walks. Initially he said they “hung out” for 3 weeks and when I asked to go through uber it was for over 4 months. 

I am both devastated about this means for me and two children. I had tried doing everything I could from a distance. I asked him multiple times him what’s the plan for our family and he would come up with ambiguous responses. I have been going for therapy to understand my emotions of resentment towards him and our current life. 

In August we had gone for a family trip and I got a strong intuition about him being flirtatious. And he argued vehemently that he would never do that to us. The children and I mean everything to him. He has no one else outside of us. But this was all during the duration he was talking to the other lady. 

He claims that it will be different going forward that he’s going to prioritize me and the children. But other than a claimed verbal commitment nothing changes. He still lives in the Middle East and I stay with the children in our home
Country. 

I had been having a strong intuition about his flirtatious behavior and talking to women. But he always said he is “charming”. 

He claims never to have slept with her - but I don’t believe him. 

I am aware he has been lying to me for months. She called him while we were together and he lied and refused to pick up her call. He lied about the duration of their situation-ship. He’s deleted his uber history. When I asked about the call he lied. If he’s lied about all these other things then wouldn’t he be lying about anything physical. 

Ever since finding out I have been oscillating between knowing that our relationship cannot go any further and we have reached then end of the road to maybe we can save it and it’s not as bad (denial). 

I am both venting and trying to figure out our next steps. 

He said he’s sorry and that he won’t do it again. He realizes how stupid it was. He apparently  ended the relationship when the lady wanted more. That his mindset has changed. And what gets me is he’s always claimed to have a strong mindset. That he’s here strictly to get a paycheck and come back home. He’s only home 10 days out of 30. 

In September my therapist has been mentally preparing me for this outcome. She asked me during one of our sessions if I thought he was having an affair and my response was
“I don’t know.” 

Coincidentally this was all happening concurrently- therapy and his relationship. 

I know my thoughts are all over the place - I’m just in shock that everything has come to this. ",11,1729055337.0,survivinginfidelity,3,1.0,False
1g4rt8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1g4rt8i/advice_for_heart_palpitationsshortness_of_breath/,Advice for heart palpitations/shortness of breath?,"I (28F) have anxiety that has been getting progressively worse over the past 6-12 months. I am seeing a psychologist on a weekly basis as of last week, have been to a GP and am going to see a psychiatrist for a medication review.

I have had low-moderate anxiety for about 5 years that wasn’t impacting my daily life, but over the past 6-12 months for reasons unknown to me, it has been spilling out into  other areas of my life such as my health and my work- two things that never used to cause me anxiety. I feel I have zero control over it, nothing that really helps or makes me feel better except time. 

Last week, whilst relaxed and sitting at work, I felt my heart skip a beat. My whole body went hot and I felt like I was going to faint. I left the room and decided to go for a walk to calm myself down. The usual anxiety symptoms occurred for me like nausea and diarrhoea. My heart continued to flutter after skipping a beat, both of which are not a normal occurrence for me. I decided to leave work to go home and started to drive away but soon realised I was having a panic attack and couldn’t drive. I pulled over and went for a walk. I still didn’t feel right in my chest, but I was trying to reassure myself that it had been at least half an hour since my heart skipped a beat, if anything bad was going to happen, it would have happened by now. My reassurance, ‘check the facts’ and self soothing skills weren’t working- I kept spiralling, thinking something was going to happen to me whilst I was out on this walk alone. I had severe dry mouth and the chest fluttering continued. I spent hours out there just walking around in circles. My partner had to come and get me after he finished work as I still felt like it wasn’t safe for me to drive. 

After that day, I cut out my one cup of coffee per day, put it down to anxiety, and avoided seeing a doctor out of fear of not being taken seriously. I now have an accute awareness of my heartbeat and have noticed it skipping a beat 1-2 times per day, as well as some fluttering. I assure myself every time that this is normal, but it is still causing me a great deal of stress. After five days of these symptoms, it progressed to chest tightening and shortness of breath, so I decided to take myself to ED to get checked out. They did an ECG and a chest x-wray and all results came back normal. I felt better being there and felt better by the doctors reassurance. He said if it continued over the next 2-3 weeks, I could look at getting a heart monitor. 

Since then, my awareness of the heartbeat has gotten better and isn’t constant, though I can feel it when my heart skips out of beat. The other day, during a Pilates workout class, it skipped a beat 6 or 7 times and I had to leave class. I pretty much constantly have a tight chest which gets worse when I am sitting or laying down, so I dread night time. I feel like I can’t take a full deep breath through my lungs- only through my stomach. 

I am stressed just thinking about the stress my body is under. If the heart palpitations and tight chest are purely anxiety, what am I putting my poor body through?

So far what I have done that helps (even if only minimally or temporarily) is breathing exercises, particularly exhaling for longer than the inhale. Practicing belly breathing with my hand on my stomach. I am constantly trying to self soothe, practice radical acceptance, check the facts and combat my negative thoughts with positive ones- all skills I have learnt in DBT.

Things have been pretty dark for me recently, constantly feeling like I am dying or about to die, feeling like I can’t take a deep breath. I feel like I’m never going to get over this or feel normal again. I feel anxious 99% of the day, every day. I need help. I’d love to hear from anyone who’s been or going through something similar- what has helped you?

For reference- I am currently on 50mg Agomelatine. This was working well for a few years for my depression, but not anxiety. I have also been prescribed Seroquel but I don’t find myself using it. GP has recommended I switch to Sertraline but given my history with antidepressants in the past not helping much or dealing with too many side effects, I am going to see a psychiatrist for a second opinion.

We never spoke until the last 4 months of school. I always noticed her. Said my best friend how pretty she is and looks like Kiara Advani. But I never approached her because she seemed to be rude and unwelcoming. I once thought to myself, ""Agar ye meri girlfriend bani toh kitna achaa hoga"". But never proceeded.
Later in the 10th grade one of my friends was made to sit on the  first bench and I used to go just casually to pass time during free periods or between periods. She sat right behind him. That's when I first started talking to her. We played ""Bollywood"", a game where you have to guess the name of the movie based on the initials of the characters and the movie. She was a pro in that game dude. Me and my friend were on one time and we always lost. But it was fun. Seeing her laugh and tease me as I lost game after game. That's when I started liking her. Once, when we were playing, she said that she won't be coming to the school for the next couple of days. My heart sank. I wanted to see her everyday. I wanted to confess my feelings for her. 
But, does she like me back? Should I confess to her? What will be her reaction? This might ruin whatever we have right now. 
These thoughts always came to my mind and I stopped myself. 
We had our boards coming up and I thought of focusing on studies rather than getting into this or it might affect both of our studies. 
Boards were done. I never saw her. I thought of asking her if she would like to come with me for coffee on the last day of boards after the exam. I had prepared myself up mentally to ask her out. Everything was set. 
And then, Covid hit. The last paper was postponed indefinitely. And I never saw her back. 
Almost two years passed during lockdown and one day, I was scrolling and I got a follow suggestion. It was HER !!!! I was overjoyed and I sent her a follow request. She accepted. 
She had posted a story and it was a Atif Aslam song. Him being my favourite singer, I replied to her story. That is how the conversation started. We started sending memes, started talking. As time passed she became my best friend. I love talking to her. Sharing my problems with her. I trust her wholeheartedly. She supported me during my saddest time. Gave me a shoulder to cry on. 
One evening, she calls me and tells me her friend proposed to her and she has a boyfriend now. My heart broke. I mean I was happy for her but dude I was damn jealous. I congratulated her. If she's happy, I'm happy. 
That relationship didn't last long. They broke up after around 3-4 months. It was a long distance relationship and she didn't want a long distance. 
Now during this time, I started flirting with her. Teased her. Slowly, I started showing my love for her. I was all into her. 
On 30 August, 2023, we went to see a movie and we kissed for the first time. It was magical. 
After this, I started calling my girlfriend cause we had kissed come on. But she said that ""You have not proposed to me in a proper way yet"".
So on 30th October, 2023, I proposed to her. Wrote a paragraph for her. Read it to her. Asked her to be my girlfriend. She said YES.  
This is how I got the love of my life. I love her man and can't wait to spend whatever moments we have ahead of us. From ""Bhai kash ye meri girlfriend hoti"" to ""Haa bhai ye meri girlfriend hai"" we came a long way.n",10,1729055014.0,indiasocial,8,0.81,False

Picture this: you’re sipping on your favorite coffee, scrolling through crypto news, and out of nowhere, you stumble upon an article about a genius-level move that some savvy businesses and developers are using to boost efficiency, save time, and look like the smartest player in the Bitcoin space. It’s not some top-secret algorithm or insider trading—it’s the **Bitcoin QR Code Generator API**, and using it might just be the ultimate high-IQ move you’ve been searching for.

But what makes this little slice of code wizardry so brilliant? Let’s dive into the reasons why integrating our Bitcoin QR Code Generator API is the smartest move you can make for your business, project, or even your personal crypto stash.

# The Genius Behind QR Codes and Bitcoin

Before we get into the API itself, let’s talk about why Bitcoin and QR codes go together like peanut butter and jelly. Bitcoin, as you probably already know, is all about decentralization and simplicity. Transactions are fast, secure, and global, but without a slick way to handle payments, it can still feel a little clunky. Enter the **QR code**—a simple, scannable graphic that eliminates all the headaches of copying and pasting those long, mind-numbing Bitcoin addresses.

Think about it: when was the last time you typed out a 30-character Bitcoin address by hand? Probably never, because who wants to risk losing their crypto to a typo? With a Bitcoin QR code, users can just scan and go, making transactions fast, easy, and error-free. That’s smart, but the real genius kicks in when you automate this process with our **Bitcoin QR Code Generator API**.

# Why Use the Bitcoin QR Code Generator API?

Using an API—especially one as seamless and versatile as our Bitcoin QR Code Generator API—is like hiring a personal crypto assistant who never sleeps. It’s efficient, reliable, and makes you look like a tech genius. Let’s break down exactly why using this API is a high-IQ decision.

# 1. Time is Money: Automate Your Transactions

Let’s face it—time is the one thing you can’t get back. Manually generating QR codes for each Bitcoin transaction? That’s time you’ll never see again. But with the Bitcoin QR Code Generator API, all that busywork disappears. Whether you’re a developer creating a crypto app, a business accepting Bitcoin payments, or even someone who loves to tinker with tech, the API takes care of the QR code generation for you.

Imagine having an online store where customers can seamlessly pay with Bitcoin. Instead of generating a QR code for each customer manually, our API handles it all behind the scenes. As soon as someone makes a payment request, boom—a Bitcoin QR code is automatically generated and ready to be scanned. You save time, reduce human error, and speed up the payment process. Now that’s a high-IQ move.

# 2. Developer’s Dream: Integration Made Easy

One of the marks of a high-IQ move is knowing how to work smarter, not harder. Our **Bitcoin QR Code Generator API** is designed with developers in mind, making it ridiculously easy to integrate into websites, apps, and custom software.

Whether you’re building a Bitcoin wallet, an e-commerce platform, or a donation page, the API offers flexibility and ease of use. With just a few lines of code, you can incorporate Bitcoin QR code generation into your project, no sweat. The API handles all the heavy lifting, giving you more time to focus on the fun stuff—like building awesome features or getting ahead in the crypto world. High-IQ moves are all about efficiency, and this API is the definition of working smart.

# 3. Security First: Protect Your Transactions

Another hallmark of high-IQ thinking? Never compromising on security—especially when it comes to cryptocurrency. QR codes generated through our API are encrypted and designed to protect your sensitive Bitcoin addresses from prying eyes or potential hacks.

In a world where security breaches make headlines regularly, using a secure Bitcoin QR code generator ensures that your transactions stay private and protected. By implementing this API, you not only protect your users and customers but also enhance your reputation as a reliable, forward-thinking business. That’s next-level thinking right there.

# 4. Flexibility & Customization: Tailored to Your Needs

High-IQ solutions are never one-size-fits-all, and that’s why our **Bitcoin QR Code Generator API** is built to be flexible and customizable. Need a specific format for your QR codes? Want to adjust the size or color to match your brand? No problem.

The API allows you to generate QR codes that suit your exact requirements. Whether you’re running a minimalist tech startup or a vibrant online marketplace, your QR codes can be tailored to fit your style. High IQ isn’t just about being smart—it’s about being adaptable, and this API gives you the flexibility to stay ahead of the curve.

# 5. Scale with Ease: Ready for Growth

Smart thinkers plan for the future, and our Bitcoin QR Code Generator API is built for scalability. Whether you’re handling a few Bitcoin payments a day or thousands, the API can grow with you. That means as your business or project expands, your QR code generation process will keep pace, seamlessly supporting your growing transaction volume without missing a beat.

This kind of scalability makes the API a must-have for forward-thinking businesses. When the crypto world explodes (and trust us, it’s coming), you’ll be more than ready to handle the influx of Bitcoin transactions. Planning ahead and being prepared for growth? Now that’s the hallmark of a high-IQ move.

# The Icing on the Cake: Bitcoin’s Future-Proof Potential

You didn’t think we’d finish this article without giving a nod to the **future-proof potential** of Bitcoin itself, did you? By using our **Bitcoin QR Code Generator API**, you’re not just optimizing your business or project—you’re setting yourself up to thrive in the future of finance.

As more and more people adopt Bitcoin, being able to accept and process Bitcoin payments effortlessly will give you a massive advantage. Whether you’re a business owner, a developer, or just a crypto enthusiast, integrating the API into your workflow is like locking in a VIP ticket to the future of commerce.

Bitcoin is here to stay, and by automating and optimizing your QR code generation with our API, you’re positioning yourself as a leader in the space. And that, my friend, is the definition of a high-IQ move.

Turning eighteen was supposed to be a celebration—a rite of passage.

My mom couldn’t wait for my eighteenth birthday, and it was two weeks away. 

I was less than excited when I arrived at the party, hovering behind her. 

The party was in full swing, but it was the adults who were celebrating, while the birthday boy himself sat alone, his head buried in his lap. 

He was crying. I could tell by his shuddering shoulders, trying to bury himself in his lap and make himself smaller.

Ethan’s father greeted me with a rainbow cupcake and stroking my hair. 

I awkwardly laughed, shoving him away. “I'm seventeen, Mr Harley.”

I was pretty sure he still saw me as a child. 

Mr. Harley was like an uncle to me. He loomed over me at an impressive and slightly intimidating height, dark red hair slicked back, always wearing brightly colored pants and long trench coats. 

According to my mother, Ethan’s dad was the only one who could stop me from crying when I was a baby, pretending my screams were lyrics to a song he liked which cemented my nickname.

Personally, I just think my infant self was so confused by him singing over my screams that I immediately stopped. “Hello, Ruby Songbird!” he laughed, ruffling my hair again.

I inched away. “Still seventeen.”

“Dylan.” My mom’s face crinkled into a smile. “Congratulations.”

Mr. Harley nodded with a grin, his gaze flicking to me. I didn't notice, mesmerized by the huge cake sitting on a metal platter. I didn't see Ethan’s name on it, though. 

The little kids were running around while the adults stood in their own little groups, holding champagne glasses and whispering to each other.

I noticed they kept shooting glances at Ethan, who had moved to the backyard, now sitting on the edge of their pool. Mr. Harley was quick to usher me away so he could talk to my mom.

“All right, my little Songbird! Why don't you take this to my mopey son?” he chuckled, handing me a bowl of ice cream, gesturing to Ethan. “I thiiiiink he needs cheering up.”

I took the ice cream with a nervous laugh. “Uh, what's wrong with him?”

Mr. Harley’s lips twitched, and he and my mother shared a smile.

I was expecting a slightly passive aggressive explanation to why my age group were all *bad*, and that's exactly what I got. 

Mr. Harley nudged Mom playfully, his gaze snapping back to me. “It’s an illness that only affects teenagers, turning them into evil monsters who refuse to do what their parents say.”

He held out the ice cream, covering it with chocolate sauce. “Right now, *this* is the only cure we have. Ethan prefers vanilla, but one bowl of this, and I'm sure his… *symptoms* will clear up.”

I shot Mom a pained look, and she nudged me a little too hard. 

So, I took the ice-cream. “Yeah, um, sure, I'll give him his *cure*.”

Mom’s smile was a warning. 

*Do not push it*. 

I had to resist the urge to outwardly cringe. Ethan’s father was… a lot. 

Ethan himself used to be a great guy. We grew up together, bonding over our birthdays only being two weeks apart, so it was always me and him. 

He was the boy next door, the two of us growing up facing each other's windows. He was that freckled awkward little kid, and then, he made my stomach kind of flutter.

We started junior high hand in hand, promising to stay friends forever. 

Yeah, that lasted maybe two fucking minutes. Boys and puberty don't mix. 

Suddenly, he was drawing his curtains and blocking me out. I called him out, of course, and to my surprise, he apologised for being an asshole. We reconciled and our friendship groups merged together. 

But over the last few months, Ethan stopped knocking on my door and ignored me when I shouted his name across the street. 

When I texted his friends, and then *my* friends, I got no answer. 

Look, I was already a little weirded out by the sudden dramatic change in behavior in some of my classmates when they reached the big one-eight. Jesse Radcliffe and Aris Mora, Ethan’s friends, were the latest casualties. 

In the space of two weeks, the two of them had turned from obnoxious jocks– to– I wasn't even sure.

Was there a word for a complete change in personality/behavior? 

These guys used to spend their Friday nights in the diner, drinking beers and trying to hit on the 20 year old waitress. 

Now, from what I heard, they stayed inside and watched English *golf.*

Whatever happened to them, it freaked Ethan out.

He stopped returning my calls, and just went totally silent. 

At school, he shoved past me, completely ignoring my existence. 

Ethan’s mother called it “typical teenage behavior” when he and a group of guys from school tried to run away from home. 

They were caught, and ever since then, Ethan had become a different person. 

He told me to fuck off a week prior, and I didn’t like the sudden hollowness in his eyes. 

Ethan didn't look happy on his *happy* day, and part of me wasn't surprised

But hey, it was his eighteenth, he should have been at least forcing a smile. 

When his mother gently pulled him into the house to join in on the birthday song, he reluctantly dragged himself inside, rolling his eyes the whole time. I noticed him playing with a keychain, a little Pokémon attached to it, his fingers wrapping around and squeezing it for dear life. 

I was pretty sure it was a gift from Aris. Speaking of, he was keeping his distance for some reason, hanging out with all the parents. 

I did catch looks between them. Ethan, glaring at his friend, and Aris, grinning back at him, saluting his birthday with his glass of… whiskey? 

Didn't Aris hate the stuff? I vaguely remembered him throwing up on my sneakers during a summer camp out. 

When Ethan was told to blow out his candles, the boy refused, and to my surprise, violently shoved his mother away when she tried to pull him into a hug. Mrs. Harley looked hurt, but she maintained her smile.

“Ethan.” Her tone was still gentle, despite her strained grin. “Baby, blow out your candles and thank everyone for coming.”

Ethan didn't move, his face bathed in warm candlelight. 

I tried to meet his eyes, but he refused to look at me. 

I was only met with empty darkness, and a stranger with my best friend’s face.

“No,” he whispered, wrapping his arms around himself.

Ethan’s response was met with low murmurs in the crowd.

“Young man,” Mr. Harley spoke up this time, his smile stretching a little too thin. 

Ethan’s tone terrified me.  He lifted his head, glaring at his parents. “It's not my *fucking* birthday.”

I tried not to notice Jesse smirking at the corner of my eye. 

Ethan’s mother burst into tears, and my own eyes started to sting. 

“Ethan!” Mr Harley chastised. “Apologize to your mother!”

The boy stood very still for a moment, before a smile slowly pricked on his lips. I saw his body relax, his shoulders slumping. His fingers twined around the key chain went limp, and he stuffed it in his pocket. “You're right, Mom,” Ethan smiled brightly, but there were tears in his eyes.

When Ethan was caught running away from home, he freaked out, trying and failing to hide the conflicting emotions. This time, he let the tears fall, soaking the collar of his shirt. But he was still smiling.

“Thanks for the cake, *Mom*,” he said, before plucking a still-lit candle from the frosting and dropping it into his mouth. Luckily, Mr. Harley forced him to spit it out. 

“Relax!” Ethan laughed, “Wow, guys, it's almost like you don't want me to hurt myself!”

Mrs Harley was still trying to smile, her eyes wild. “Ethan, *stop*.”

“Stop *what*?” The birthday boy surprised me with a grin, his gaze meeting mine. 

“What's wrong, *Mom*? Isn't this what you've always wanted?” He started cramming candles into his mouth in a frenzy, choking on them. But that didn't stop him trying to stuff more down his throat. They were quickly taken away.

After a very brief hissing match with his parents, he saluted them with a rebellious grin,  grabbed the cake, and planted his face directly into rainbow frosting before collapsing into hysterical giggles. 

There was a stunned silence, and I think both of his parents were on the edge of their tether, before the crowd, mainly the adults, started laughing, leaving me the only one who wasn't. 

Jesse and Aris were howling, the two of them slapping their thighs, like this was comedy genius. A shiver slowly slithered down my spine. Ethan was sobbing. Through his violent laughter, tears running down his cheeks, choking him. He shot his father a wide grin, licking frosting from his lips and chin. 

“I thought you *wanted* me to celebrate my birthday?” the boy danced over to the cupcakes, stuffing them into his mouth. 

“I'm having a great time!”

I started forwards to stop him, but my mother, who was joining in with the cacophony of shrieking laughter, yanked me back. 

“It's not our business, Ruby.” Mom said, shoving a drink in my face. 

“Sweetie, have a drink!”

I don't think any of us were expecting Ethan to pour the entirety of the chocolate fountain over his head, which set the kids around me into fits of hysterical laughter. 

“Please ignore our son!” Mr. Harley told the crowd. “He's just being a typical teenager!”

The crowd laughed *louder*, and something slimy crept up my throat. 

Ethan was self-destructing, and I couldn't bear watching. 

I turned to Mom to ask if I could leave, but she was already talking to Ethan’s friends, her lips brushing the edge of a wine glass. 

There were several things wrong with what I was seeing, and I remember trying to swallow down soda that was creeping back up my throat. 

Mom didn’t usually talk to the older kids. I remember her telling me to stay away from Jesse and Aris, both of whom she was now deep in conversation with. 

When Ethan ran away from home, Jesse and Aris were caught along with him. 

I wasn’t supposed to be watching out of my window, but I did. I saw a very heated conversation between my mother and the two boys. 

Something about staying away from me and leaving Ethan alone. The last time I saw them, the two were standing on our front lawn throwing bricks at our door. 

Now, however, it seemed like Mom was friends with them. Jesse kept nudging her like they were best pals, while Aris swirled wine around his glass. 

I couldn’t make out their words, but they kept stealing glances at Ethan and whispering to each other. 

Jesse and Aris didn't seem like the gossiping types, but somehow they looked comfortable with the adults, exchanging greetings with other guests and laughing with my mother. 

They were even dressed weirdly, swapping casual hooded sweatshirts and jeans for more formal dress shirts and pants. Jesse’s converse were already dirty from walking around in the foliage. 

When they were caught by their parents, the three were clinging onto each other. Jesse and Aris were dragged away screaming, and Ethan was pulled back inside. Mom caught me peeking, and she was *pissed.* 

Now, the two boys barely even looked at Ethan, except shooting him judgemental glances over their wine glasses. When the party resumed, the music was cranked up, and nobody was paying attention to Ethan Harley except for me. 

My gut twisted, no matter how many times I tried to convince myself that everything was okay. I watched him, still smeared in frosting, hovering over what was left of his cake. 

He was rocking backwards and forwards, unsteady, and I saw it– his fingers twitched, and in one quick motion, he snatched up the abandoned cake knife. I didn't like his smile, the sudden sparkle in his eyes. 

Like he was going to self-destruct even more. 

Mrs Harley, however, was quick to pull the knife from his fingers, and his arms dropped to his sides, his expression crumpling. She was surprisingly gentle with him, wrapping her arms around him and leading him out into the backyard. 

Ethan plonked himself on the edge of the pool, ignoring his mother's attempts to talk to him. She gave him a towel and told him to wipe his face, and he didn't respond, throwing the towel into the pool.

When Mrs Harley rested a hand on his shoulder, the boy jerked away– and she gave up, leaving him alone. I decided to join him, dipping my toes in iridescent water, comforted by the cool temperature. 

“Ethan.” I said. 

“Go away, Ruby.”  he grumbled. 

I shuffled slightly to the left. “What exactly are you doing?”

Ethan surprised me with a sigh, tipping his head back and blinking at the blistering sun. “I'm trying to figure out how to inconspicuously drown myself in a kid's pool.”

“Oh.” I kicked my legs in the water. “Sounds fun.”

Keeping my eyes on water sparkling under late afternoon sunlight, I offered Ethan the dessert, and to my surprise, he took it, offering me a watery smile. “Thanks.”

“Ethan.” I said again. 

I wasn't sure how to ask him what was going on with him, but I didn't need to. 

“I don't want to talk about it.” He leaned back, his mouth pricking into a smile. “If I’m honest, I just want to enjoy the summer breeze on my face,” he leaned over, tracing the water with his fingers, “Maybe go skinny dipping when the kids are gone.”

When he started spooning desert into his mouth, I couldn't resist. “Soooo, what did your candles taste like? Were they as tasty as you were expecting them to be?”

Ethan’s gaze was glued to his friends laughing with the adults. 

Jesse and Aris were embedded in a conversation with my Mom, the three of them drinking  coffee with the other parents. Ethan’s lips curled in disgust, but I also saw hurt, like it *hurt* him to even look at them. “Like fucking rainbows, dude.”

“Ignore them,” I muttered, “They're being assholes.”

The boy turned to me, his eyes swollen red. “Don't say that.”

“What? That your best friends who abandoned you are complete fucking jerks?”

I wasn't expecting him to hide his face, sniffling into his sweater sleeve. “You've got no idea what you're talking about,” he said, his tone hardening. “Just go home.”

I tried to smile, but my stomach was twisting into knots. 

I started to get up, brushing myself down. 
“Well, happy birthday.”

He sighed, planting his cakey face in his lap. “I've told you, it's not my birthday.”

Ethan lifted his head,  but he didn't look at me, his gaze somewhere else entirely. Lost in the sinking rays of the dying sun. “It's my Dad’s.” 

He shuffled closer, leaning his head on my shoulder.

“Can you make me a promise, Ruby?” 
 
“Uh, sure.” 

I felt my cheeks redden. 

When we were little kids, Ethan asked me to marry him. 

I said, “Maybe when we’re adults.”

Ethan was frowning at a pool floaty, his eyes turning impossibly dark, impossibly hollow, Something in my gut twisted, a sliver of ice cream creeping its way back up my throat. 

He reached out and grabbed my hand, squeezing my fingers. “Before you’re eighteen, I want you to do something important,” he said, his voice splintering. Ethan turned to me, his expression twisted with fright, with hopelessness I would never understand. 

I swallowed. “What's that?”

Ethan shuffled away from me. “Can you die for me?” 

Ethan looked up at me–his eyes were red from crying.

He was terrified, and I didn't know why. “No matter what happens, you have to promise me you will die before you turn eighteen.” he held out his pinkie for a pinky promise, just like when we were kids. 

I couldn't resist a laugh, but his expression was serious. 

“I'm sorry, *what*?”

Ethan averted his gaze. His hands were trembling. “Do you want to know a secret?”

“Not really,” I muttered. “Look, I can understand that you're scared to turn eighteen– that it's a big age for responsibility and becoming an adult, but it's also still *young*.” I shivered.

“I'm not excited of the idea of leaving home and being a responsible adult either, *but* we all have to at some point.” 

I was babbling, trying to hide that I was fucking terrified of what my friend was trying to say. I rested my head on his shoulder. I expected warmth, but he was so unnaturally *cold*. The sun was slowly eclipsed by clouds, and all the warmth was sucked from the air. 

It was suddenly so cold, an icy breeze violently blowing my hair back. I wrapped my arms around myself. 

“Just… promise *me* you'll start seeing a therapist.”

I found myself staring into the pool, where the water suddenly didn't look so welcoming. 

“Therapy.” Ethan said it like a joke, tipping his head back. “Sure.”

*“Ethan!""*

Lifting my head, Lila Fabrey was looming over him. 

Ever since *her* eighteenth birthday, Lila wasn't acting like herself either. 

Like the boys, a key member of our gang had turned from a signature potty mouthed cheerleader, to a stranger in the space of a single day. She grabbed him and yanked him to his feet. 

Instead of hanging around with Ethan, she had spent the afternoon drinking with the adults. She wasn't alone. 

Jesse and Aris had joined her. “What is the *matter* with you?” she hissed. “You can't talk to Ruby like that!”

Lila had this weird mother-like tone that was both jarring and frustrating. 

“I'm fine.” I managed to choke out, aware we had an audience. 

Lila shook her head. “No, sweetie, what he said was uncalled for,” she said, folding her arms. “Ethan, apologize to her.” 

When he didn't respond, she tapped her foot. “Now!”

“You're making a fool out of yourself, boy.” Jesse said, shaking his head. 

Ethan looked paralysed for a moment, staring at his friends, his lips parting like he was going to speak, before his expression crumpled.

“Not her face.” He whispered, his wild eyes snapping to all three of them, and then he was moving, stumbling back, his breaths coming out in sharp pants.

“That's not fair.” Ethan broke out into a sob.

When he dropped to his knees, Lila started towards him, he shuffled back, terrified. 

“Ethan—”

“Get the FUCK away from me!”

Ethan’s eyes found mine, and he sputtered out a laugh. “Do you remember our promise?”

I didn't move, my hands were trembling by my sides. 

Ethan’s parents were quick to grab and pull him to his feet, but he was laughing. “I told your daughter to die,” he spat at my mother, struggling in his father’s arms. “Because what’s the alternative, Mrs. Chase?”

Mom didn't respond, which made him laugh harder. 

“Well?” Ethan yelped when his arms were pinned behind his back. “What is the fucking alternative?”

By now, the whole party was watching his breakdown. 

Mom pulled me into her arms when Ethan was dragged away, still screaming. 

I shoved her away, rattled by his words. “What's he talking about, Mom?”

Mom didn't respond for a moment, her lips pursed. “He is… clearly mentally unwell.”

“Answer me!” His wails were like knives stabbing into my spine, his violent struggles, his attempts to rip from his parents embrace, only to scuttle backwards on his hands, and try and run– before Mr Harley scooped him into his arms. 

“Get off of me! Let me go! You assholes!” Ethan kicked and screamed, “He… he's not even my real father–”

Whatever he was going to say was promptly muffled by his mother. 

When Ethan was gone, presumably dragged to his room for a talking to, I tried to follow him. 

Jesse Radcliffe blocked my way, fixing me with a wide smile. 

This was the same guy who used to burp the alphabet. 

He took a step towards me, and I found myself stumbling back towards the pool edge. 

“He's fine,” Jesse said. “Ethan is just in a time-out.”

“Right.” I said, “Well, I just want to talk to him—”

He blocked my way again. “His parents are dealing with him.” The boy slowly cocked his head, his gaze drinking me in, as if for the first time. “When is *your* birthday again, Ruby?” he asked casually.

I tried to sidestep away from him, but Aris was behind me, his breath tickling my neck. These were my friends! But why was I so fucking scared of them?

Why, no matter how hard I tried, couldn’t I recognize their eyes?

“It's in two weeks.” I managed to get out. “You should *know* that.”

Jesse nodded slowly, his smile widening. “I'm excited,” he murmured. 

Jesse had zero concept of personal space, stepping closer, despite just a few months ago, complaining that I gave him eyesores. He was joking. 

Jesse and I were like brother and sister. When we played video games, he tugged out my controller so I couldn't join in. Looking at him now, he was a stranger with my friend’s face, a grinning NPC staring straight through me. Jesse lifted his glass, as if saluting my upcoming birthday too. 

“There's nothing better than seeing a girl blossom into a young woman.”

Definitely not something Jessie would *ever* say. 

Unless he had substantial brain damage.

I had an idea. 

It was a stupid idea, but it was an *idea*. 

Instead of responding to that, I grabbed his arm and tugged him into the hallway. To my surprise, he followed me. 

“Do you know when we, uh, hooked up in the back of your Dad’s car?” I whispered. 

His expression crumpled with *disgust*, but he nodded. “Yes, of course I do.”

“I'm pregnant,” I whispered, and it was when his eyes flew open in terror, and he stumbled away, quickly excusing himself, that I knew I wasn't talking to Jesse Radcliffe.

Jesse is gay, still in the closet– and would rather commit seppuku (his words, not mine) than be intimate with any female - let alone *me*.

I could sense phantom bugs filling my mouth. 

What the actual fuck?

I wouldn't put anything past our close knit tiny community, which thrived on youth. The parents seemed more excited than the kids themselves over turning eighteen.

I spent the rest of the party sitting on the edge of the pool waiting for Ethan to come back. 

I had a conceptual plan. When he did come back, we were going to get the fuck out of town and start a new life somewhere else. 

Party guests started to leave, the sky above me darkening. 

I was watching the sunset, pretty streaks of red and orange, when Mom came to give me a slice of birthday cake. I threw it in the pool when she wasn't looking. 

I kept expecting Ethan to plonk down next to me, but he didn't. I figured the boy was on an *indefinite* grounding; at least until he left for college. 

Mom was still talking to Ethan’s friends, and there was no sign of the birthday boy or his parents. I jumped up, shivering, and headed back into the house, slipping through the sliding glass doors. 

The kitchen was a mess, and I snatched up a plastic cup of orange vodka, downing it. 

I was busy staring at the cracked wallpaper when a sudden shriek rattled my skull. 

Ethan. 

Before I could stop myself, I followed his cries through a door I didn't recognise, which led me onto a long white hallway. 

This part of the Harley household felt cold, almost sterile. 

Untouched. 

“Ethan?” I whispered, cringing when my voice echoed. 

There was a door at the end of the hallway, and something was pulling me toward it. I remember it feeling narrow, almost otherworldly. 

I took slow steps, dragging my fingers down the pale white walls. I remember disliking the texture. It was too clinical, fake, even, like venturing down the hallways of an emergency room. 

When I peeked through the gap in the door, the first thing I saw was… red. Everywhere.

It was wet on the floor, pooling between my bare toes. 

The room was too white, with bright lights shining in my eyes. I don't think I had fully registered the wet warmth between my toes and trickling through the gaps in the floor tiles at that point. I took a single step forward, blinking rapidly. 

Ethan was strapped to a scary looking metal bed. 

“Ruby.” His voice was more of a breath. I heard both relief and terror. 

“You shouldn't… be here.” He let out a wet sounding sob, wrenching at velcro restraints, and I could see him trembling. I took another step, like my body was in control of my mind. 

I might have been screaming, but I couldn't hear anything. All I could hear was the wet-sounding drip of Ethan’s blood hitting the floor. The red was coming from him, slicking his skin like paint. 

Initially, I thought Ethan really *was* scared of being an adult. He was so scared, in fact, that he had tried to hurt himself. I could see the claw marks from his own nails, his teeth trying to tear into his own skin. But Ethan looked strangely calm, like he was meditating.

He twisted his head, and I noticed straps pinning his shoulders to the table. “Can you do me a solid and grab a scalpel?”

I found my voice, standing on my tip-toes to grasp for one on the top shelf above him. 

In person I hesitated, but inside, my mind was screaming. 

When I tried to cut the restraints pinning his ankles, he shook his head violently. 

“No, that's not what I meant. Please *kill* me.” He whispered in a hysterical giggle. When I checked his eyes, his pupils were huge– dilated.

“What did your parents do to you?” I managed to choke out. 

I was met with a giggle. “Parents?” He scoffed. “They're not my parents! More like my great, great, great, great, great, great–”

Footsteps sounded, and I slammed my hand over his mouth. Someone was coming. Ethan was still giggling to himself, muttering, *great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great* into my hand. 

Looking for an escape, there was none. The only place I could hide was— I panicked, dropping to my knees and crawling under the bed. 

Ethan somehow caught hold of himself, sobering up at the sound of his mother's heeled footsteps closing in on us. 

“Ruby.” His voice spluttered into a helpless sob that broke my heart. “Get the fuck *out* of here. I don't want you to see this.”

I wanted to, but the door was already opening and then slamming shut. 

I glimpsed two pairs of shoes. Heels, and white converse smeared with dirt. 

I recognised those shoes, though I wasn't sure where *from*. 

“Please, Mom.” Ethan’s voice was a whimper. “Please don't fucking do this to me.” 

Mrs Harley’s heel clacks sent chills spiking through me. 

In four steps, she was hovering over her son, and I found myself scootching back. 

Something hit the floor with a loud  *clang*, and I had to bite back a cry, my mouth filling with blood when I bit through my tongue. 

The scalpel.

Mrs. Harley’s chuckle was unreal.

“Ethan, sweetie, you know I'm not your mother. I have never seen you as a son.”

“Derek.” Ethan spoke through his teeth. “Jesse fucking hated you.”

It was Jesse’s laugh that sent my thoughts into a whirlwind. 

“Thank you.” Jesse snorted. “I wasn't particularly fond of the boy, either.”

“Ethan, that's rude.” Mrs Harley hissed. “Be nice to your friend.”

“He's not my–” Ethan burst into sobs, the bed rattling with the force of his squirming. 

“Mom, please don't do this.”

The sudden screeching sound of blades was so deafening that I slapped my hand over my mouth, muffling a cry. Ethan let out a single, piercing wail, as if he was trying to cry out, before he... He just… stopped. 

Everything about him stopped—his sharp, panting breaths and his violent struggling. 

I thought Mrs. Harley had shown mercy, had come to her senses. 

But then… it started to rain inside the white room? Ethan Harley had gone deathly silent. It was just a wet spot on my forehead, at first. I swiped at it, and my hand was bright red. My brain processed slower than my body. Blood. 

When I realized what was raining from the sky—or in my case, pooling over the edge of Ethan’s bed—the shrieking screech of blades started up again.

The noise was so loud, ringing in my skull, I thought it would never stop.

Half aware, I clawed at my face to muffle my own hysterical shrieks. I don't know why I couldn't move. I froze, paralysed, watching fleshy white strips of flesh and hair dropping into rapidly spreading red stretching across the floor. 

My stomach was twisting and turning, my mouth filling with bile. When the blades stopped, I was sitting very still, my eyes full of bright red. I barely noticed that I was soaked in blood.

It was dripping in thick rivulets down my face, warm and wet and utterly grotesque.

I don't think I'll ever forget that sensation. 

*Ethan* was in my mouth, in my eyes, running down my chin. 

I couldn't move, my knees pressed to my chest, vomit staining my shirt.

“*Hello*, sweetie.”

Ethan’s mother’s voice slowly pricked something inside me. 

I didn't know I had my eyes squeezed shut, until gloved hands fingers were wrapping around my ponytail, and yanking me from my hiding spot. 

I kept my eyes shut, clenching them against the tears, trying to tug away from her, my mouth full of stale barf. 

When I was politely placed in a plastic chair, I sensed Mrs Harley crouched in front of me. Her breath tickled my cheeks. “Ruby, you can open your eyes,” she hummed, “I've… cleaned everything up.”

I did, against my better judgement. 

Prying open my eyes, I was suddenly aware of Mrs Harley swiping at my face with tissue paper. Behind her was what I was trying to escape, trying to pretend didn't exist. But he was still there, reduced to a limp body covered with a white sheet, his hand hanging off of the surface. 

When his fingers twitched, suddenly, something acrid filled my mouth. 

“All better.” Mrs Harley straightened up, fixing me with a wide smile. “Now, I know you have questions, and all will be answered in due course. But right now, I have a surprise for you.”

The woman turned around and pulled a paper party hat from her pocket, before placing it on my head. I didn't move. I *couldn't* move. I was still watching Ethan’s blood fill the gaps between the floor tiles. “Happy early birthday, Ruby.”

I started to jump up, adrenaline driving me to my feet. 

But then, Mom walked in. 

I screamed for her, immediately wanting my *mother*. 

But her wide, satisfied smile only sent me into hysteria. 

Mom’s gaze flicked to Ethan’s body. “You were careful with the body, correct?” 

“Of course I was.” Mrs Harley said, pulling me to my feet to another empty bed. She slammed me down, pinning my wrists and ankles. “Michael is just resting, Iris. He'll be up and about in no time, do not worry.” 

Mrs Harley nodded to my Mom, who rolled her eyes like a teenager. “Go and get yourself prepared. I will be ready when you are.”

Mom scoffed. 

“Oh, please,” she said, “Derek waited three days before his rebirth into his little brat.” 

Mom started towards me, her face growing monstrous, her eyes flicking up and down my struggling body. This thing had been wearing my mother for as long as I'd known her, and all that time I was nothing but her end goal.

“I've waited so long,” she hummed, pulling at her own cheeks, “Inside this… ancient, stretchy trash bag.” she prodded at my face with her manicure. “I want to watch it happen!” 

Mrs Harley hesitated, before nodding, pulling on fresh gloves.

“Of course, Iris.”

I won't describe what my ‘mother’ did to me, because it fucking hurts. 

What I do remember is her savage grin when spinning blades started up. 

I was too choked up to scream, my body was stuck. 

Paralysed. 

But before those blades could rip me apart, turning me into a second skin, both my mother and Mrs Harley hit the ground. 

Before I knew what was happening, Ethan was looming over me, a metal tray in his hands. He was covered in blood, still dressed in the blue scrubs he died in. His hair had been shaved off, leaving him with bald, rugged skin held together by stitches. 

Ethan blinked rapidly, the tray slipping from his fingers. He looked confused, slowly inclining his head, before grabbing a scalpel. For a moment, it looked like he was going to drag it across his own throat. 

It *wasn't* Ethan. 

He cut through my restraints with trembling hands. I jumped off the bed, reaching to grab him and pull him with me—only to find, to my confusion, that he was kneeling on the floor, helping his mother stand. 

He didn't even look at me, wrapping his arms around his psychotic mother. 

When he *did* lift his head, his lip was curled in disgust, eyes narrowed into slits. 

“Sweetie,” Ethan shook his mother. “Honey, she's getting *away*.”

I had half a mind to finish my mother off right then and there.

But I got out of there. 

Aris Mora stepped in front of me, and I saw it—straight away. 

How did I never *see* it? 

Stitches, just below his hairline. 

So subtle, but right *there*.

I couldn't control myself, quickly shoving past him and running - as fast and far as my feet could take me.

I realized that day, that Aris and Jesse weren't just dead: they were hollow skins filled with monsters. 

Once I was far away from the Harley household, I hid under an old bridge for three days. I stole Mom’s car, with the intention to get the fuck out of dodge. 

I got all the way to the intersection leaving town, before headlights were blinding me. I expected the cops, or *worse*, my mother herself– hunting me down for what she thought was *hers*. But when Ethan Harley stumbled out of his car, I think something inside me snapped in two. 

It was his expression. He looked like Ethan again, wide frightened eyes blinking at me. But I could also see the stitches under thick brown wig, marking him as one of *them*. 

In my mind, there was zero way my neighbor, my best friend, could survive *that*. 

I had come prepared, obviously. 

I didn't know how to use it, but it was just point and shoot, right? 

I pulled out my mother’s gun, pointing it right between the boy's unfocused eyes.

“Why are you here?” was all that I could choke out.

He shrugged. “I don't know.” he kept blinking, like he was genuinely confused. “I was in my backyard planting flowers,” his face crumpled, “and now I'm standing here.”

His words took me off guard. 

I tightened my fingers around the gun, struggling with the trigger. “What did your birthday candles taste like?” I demanded. 

Ethan looked confused, his lips curling into a smile. 

“What?”

I swallowed a shriek. “Your birthday candles! What did they *taste* like?”

“Rainbows.” Ethan said, and when I found myself fingering the trigger, he flinched, throwing his hands up. “Like *fucking* rainbows!” He corrected himself. “Jesus, Ruby, can you please put the gun down?”

I did, letting harsh metal slip through my fingers. 

“I don't have time to explain,” he said. I noticed he was keeping his distance. “But I can get you away from your Mom.”

I didn't realize I was trembling until I was on my knees, my throat clogged with sobs. 

“How did you find out?” I spoke to the ground, my chest aching. 

It wasn't Ethan. 

But it was also *was*?

Ethan’s small smile crumpled, and he lowered his hands. 

“I snuck into Jesse’s house on his brother’s eighteenth birthday,” he said shakily. It started to rain, and I could barely feel it dampening my hair, sticking my clothes to my skin. 

Ethan stepped closer to me. When we were face to face, he prodded the scar that monster gave me. 

“There were four of us, and…” His voice shook. “We saw everything.” Ethan pretended to fold his arms across his chest, but I could see him trembling. “We were fifteen.” he heaved out a breath. “So, we dedicated every year following to escaping this fucking town.”

Something in his eyes turned dark, a shiver sliding down my spine. 

“But, you know,” he shot me a watery smile. “That didn't happen.” 

Ethan gestured to his car. He told me he was going to take me to a safe place. 

When I jumped into the passenger seat, there was a gun sticking from the glove compartment. But I knew it wasn't for me. 

I didn't question his jerking head, or his hands slick with blood wrapped around the steering wheel, every time he gingerly stroked the stitches still lining his forehead. 

He wasn't stable.  I could tell by the way his body moved, like he was fighting his own limbs. But that didn't stop him shooting me a small grin and cranking up the radio, singing along to Fall Out Boy. 

I found myself relaxing in my seat, my eyes flickering, sleep finally biting me. 

But sitting there against the backdrop of a rainy evening, I finally let myself *sleep*. 

I was hesitant at first, but his hand found my arm. It was warm. 

“It's okay.” Ethan’s voice was a low murmur. “You can sleep.”

When he pulled up at a hotel, Ethan tried to drive away. 

But I was pretty sure he was trying to get rid of the monster inside his head. 

I told him to stay with me, and if his behavior turned erratic, I promised I would shoot him. 

The good news is, we've had Ethan’s parents’ cash to afford us being on the run. 

I got a card through the mail, and I knew exactly what it was.

I don't know how she's found me. Maybe Ethan didn't murder his father after all. 

The birthday card was home-made, covered in glitter. 

*Happy birthday, my dearest Ruby! I'm sure by now, you should be feeling the effects of being so far away from me. 

I think we both know I deserve what is mine. I have waited 18 years, sweetheart. Do not make me come and get you myself. You have until your birthday eve, darling. Then I will be taking matters into my own hands.*

*Can't wait to see you again!*

*So much love*, 

*Mommy.*

Ethan tore up the cards and burned them. 

He stays up all night with a baseball bat to protect us.

I'm turning 18 next week, and I'm starting to understand what ‘Mom’ wrote. I've mostly been couch crashing, lying about my age and trying to finish my senior year. 

But over the last few days (weeks, maybe) it's like my body is rejecting me. It took me an hour to get out of bed, to even open my eyes, despite my brain being wide awake. 

My body is getting worse. I woke up this morning, and I can't eat anything. 

My arms are aching even fucking typing this. Fuck, it's like my body is screaming at me. I keep throwing up, and every time, it feels like my body is rejecting *me*. 

ALL of me. 

… 

We’re moving tonight. But I don't think I'm going to get far when I can barely stand. 

What should I do? Do we go home and face this *thing* with my Mom’s face, or run, and let my own body drain me of my strength? 

Ethan called me *Ruby Songbird* this morning. 

I know I promised him, but I can't shoot him. I can't shoot the only person I have left. I love him too much.

But I can't let him lead her to me, either. 

Please help me. 

Edit: 

Another card came. This time, she's intentionally naming establishments near us.

For most of the day I keep a heavy pot on the garbage can, but when I’m cooking dinner and doing dishes I take it off as I frequently need to throw items out. Then she sneaks in and does her tricks. 

She has gotten to a point now where she definitely knows it’s wrong (I use my stern tone of voice in those instances) and she will at least drop the garbage (or other item) to the “drop it” command. And she has a guilty look. But it doesn’t stop the behavior. 

She has a dog door going into the backyard, and if I don’t catch her with the stolen item(s) quickly enough she will run out into the yard and play “keep away.” She will steal anything- a dirty sock, a piece of mail, a magazine. She has a large, open toy basket full of tons of appropriate toys (ropes, squeaky balls, Nyla bones etc); she often will take those out and play with them, which I heavily encourage/reward. I can also sometimes get her to “swap” a stolen item for one of her dog toys. 

I think part of it for her is that she wants me to play with her and she thinks by stealing items, we can engage in “chase” or “tug of war.” She has a naturally very sweet and playful spirit and thinks playtime is all the time.

1g4r2zl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPsychiatry/comments/1g4r2zl/could_this_be_postpartum_psychosis_bpd_or_npd/,"Could This Be Postpartum Psychosis, BPD, or NPD? Seeking Psychiatric Insights on Extreme Behavior Shift?","I’m reaching out here because I’ve been through six months of hell and am trying to make sense of what’s been happening. I’m not sure if this is postpartum psychosis (PPP), borderline personality disorder (BPD), narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), or something else entirely, but something is seriously wrong with my wife, and the cruelty I’ve endured over the past few months has left me struggling to understand what’s going on.

Our daughter was born six months ago, and almost immediately, things changed drastically. My wifes behavior flipped overnight, and it has been extreme and relentless. Out of nowhere, she decided to take our child to her parents’ house (without warning) and filed for divorce. No abuse, cheating, or big fights preceded this—just a sudden decision to leave, sever communication, and begin a custody battle.

The reasons she’s given for the divorce make no sense. She’s accused me of being bipolar and claims I’m a danger to her and our daughter. Here’s the so-called “evidence” she’s cited:

• Drinking coffee one day and not the next.

• Listening to the same song on repeat for too long one evening.

• Discovering that my actual shoe size is 10.5, not 9.5.

• Suggesting we hire a $25/hour nanny instead of a $35/hour one.

• Walking 0.5 miles to pickup a romantic dinner for us.

• Walking too much.

I have no history of mental illness, no violent behavior, no substance abuse. I’ve done everything I can to be a supportive husband and father. These claims feel like they came out of thin air, and the way she’s weaponized them has been devastating.

To make things worse, her parents—especially her mother—have been pulling the strings behind the scenes. Her mother has treated me with contempt since the beginning, undermined me at every turn, and seems to be taking full advantage of my wife’s mental state. I fear that my wife, in this fragile period, is being manipulated into isolating herself from me and anyone who could offer her another perspective.

I knew something was seriously wrong and tried to raise the alarm months ago. I called her OBGYN, hoping to get help, but instead, they just called her directly and told her I was concerned, which only backfired. I reached out to her parents, but they laughed off the idea that she could be struggling with a mental health issue. Meanwhile, everyone outside of this situation asks me if postpartum psychosis or some other mental health episode is at play. They all say what I’ve been living through is not normal.

This whole situation feels like a nightmare I can’t wake up from. I’m being smeared as unstable, cut off from my daughter, and forced to endure the coldness and cruelty of someone I once trusted with my life.

I don’t know if this is postpartum psychosis, BPD, NPD, or something else entirely, but I need to know if anyone here has insight into these kinds of sudden and extreme behavior shifts. If it’s postpartum psychosis, how do you even begin to wake up from that? If this is something like BPD or NPD, what should I expect moving forward?

I’m exhausted, conflicted, and just trying to figure out how to move forward in a way that protects my daughter and helps my wife—if that’s even still possible.

Any thoughts or insights would mean the world to me. Thank you in advance.",2,1729052463.0,AskPsychiatry,0,1.0,False

For background, I was there for 8 months. A week prior, I had gotten my first review and earned a great review, as well as a raise. I was also offered to be promoted to supervisor. I said yes. I was getting trained to be a supervisor the week I got fired. 

Everyone there would make a drink during their shift. It was a given that if we worked there, we could have a drink during our shift. Me and my coworker were having our drinks and the manager stops in and asks if we paid for them. We said no. He then said he was going to “investigate” the situation. A few days later, as me and my coworker were coming in for our shifts (in our work attire, ready to work and clocked in), we got called to the managers office. He asked us what drinks we made and we told him. He said he was terminating us, effective immediately for “violating employee purchase policy”. We both left in our work attire and clocked out.

I called a few months later over the summer and asked if I could have a second chance (I was desperate for a job) and was met with “so that’s a no” and a hang up immediately. 8 months later, I still can’t get this whole situation out of my head. We got fired for making coffee and drinking it at the place we worked at? I hate that someone else got fired, but I’m glad I wasn’t alone, because it was humiliating. So, I just wanted to tell my story. Thankfully I have an amazing job now that doesn’t require food or customer service. ",69,1729052281.0,antiwork,6,0.94,False

We have always compromised on the names. I have NEVER said “this is gonna be their name and that’s it”. When we had them I wanted to add my last name but he refused. We were only bf/gf at the time so I thought it was a fair compromise.. 

He didn’t take the suggestion well. He would get angry and say, “Am I not the dad?” and I’d push back with “Am I not the mom?” I have a very unique last name. While he has a very common popular Hispanic last name. I didn’t want my family name to disappear but long story short the girls only have his last name. 

Our oldest (8y.o) is a mix of the name I wanted and a name he wanted. Our baby (7y.o) is a name we both liked. 

Here is where an issue occurs. My husband also has a unisex name. It can be given to a boy and a girl. We met in HS and during that time I knew he was “fooling around” with a girl that has the same name as him. Me and her didn’t get along. Me and my husband didn’t date til after high school so it had nothing to do with us it was just we didn’t mix. Me and her were good friends for a few years but she was the type to only talk to “pretty girls” and it didn’t sit right with me after a while and we separated as friends.. 

Well he wanted to name our youngest (7y.o) after himself.. I told him I didn’t want her to have his name. I never gave him a reason but SHE was my reason. I feel I would look dumb of giving my child the same name of a girl he was connected to in high school. We were also young when we had her so it was like shortly after high school so it looked like he wanted to name her after her. So at that name I did say “no”. We compromised. So my daughter’s middle name is his name but shortened. 

Now onto AITAH.. 

When we had our first we lived with his parents. We were 18/19. Well, his parents do not help us. Nobody needs to help us. I already have that in my head. It was just they literally do nothing. I’d ask if they can watch my kids for an hour so I can go to the gym and the answer was always “no”.  I’ll ask if I can run down the street to buy milk and if they can just keep an eye on the girls, “no”. My girls are very well behaved and well mannered. 

Where was dad? He was either hanging out with friends/family/or at work. He chose to work in the middle of the day, stood up all night and slept all day. I have come to the realization that although i have a husband that loves me I have basically been a single mom. 

He sees it as since he actually works and isn’t home I have some privilege that he has bestowed on me

He doesn’t give me money. No “allowance”. I don’t ask for things. I am technically a SAHM but I do things that bring in extra income. I work during tax season from home. I also have a side business that brings in great money. I use all of that for groceries, anything the girls need, their copays, their medicine, their school clothes.. I also pay the water, trash, sewer, gas, and electricity.. 

I can’t get a job because we have no babysitter. Which again, these are my kids I can watch them. I have a degree and I can’t put it to use. My MIL tells my husband nobody should be watching our kids cause they will abuse them. My husband listens.. 

Let me add my in laws watch their other grandkids. They pull them out of school for coffee dates, pick them up for breakfasts, do sleepovers with them. Not my kids. Their excuse is “my kids have a good mom and their other grandkids have a bad mom”.. it’s a bs excuse but whatever I stopped caring a long time ago.. 

Now I’m pregnant with baby #3. I told my husband I don’t want to follow his family’s tradition of naming boys after their dads. He agreed because he always thought we’d be girl parents forever. Ever since we found out the gender his mom has been in his ear about how “HE should just name the baby whatever he wants and that’s it”.. because she wants the baby to have his name. I said I don’t want a “jr”. I want him to be his own person. 

Yesterday my MIL rings me and says “ima call the baby “husbands name” regardless what you name him”

Today my husband comes home from work and said “baby is gonna have my name and that’s it”

I said if he gets a name I want the middle. I want to name him after my dad. My husband flipped and I know it’s cause his parents would throw a fit. 

I swear I feel like I’ll divorce him over this. 

I’m just tired of his family having so much say over all our decisions when they do nothing for us.

He said I’m controlling and selfish for wanting to choose a name for our son. 

He said “it’s his first son”

It’s mine too.. 

He said he let me choose the girls so he should just choose our sons. He said I didn’t give him a say in our girls names and that’s not true.. But I gave my reasons for our girls names about being named after him.. 

So AITAH because I don’t want his mom to be the one naming our son? ",7,1729052111.0,AITAH,31,0.82,False
