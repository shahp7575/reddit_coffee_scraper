by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Ohio State Buckeyes vs. Purdue Boilermakers: A Lopsided Limerick of Lethargy**

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‘round for a tale of two teams: one a basketball-versed behemoth, the other a footballing also-ran with the offensive firepower of a wet firework. The No. 1 Ohio State Buckeyes (8-0) host the Purdue Boilermakers (2-7) in a collision of statistical goliaths and underdog underdogs. Let’s dissect this mismatch with the precision of a hawk and the humor of a stand-up comedian who’s had one too many cups of coffee.

### Parse the Odds: A Math Class You’ll Actually Enjoy

The numbers here are so lopsided, even a third-grade algebra class could solve them. On the moneyline, Ohio State is priced at **+100** (wait, no—*Ohio State* is -1000?!) while Purdue sits at a comically generous **+1650**. Translating that into implied probabilities? Ohio State’s chances of winning are a stratospheric **99%**, while Purdue’s? A mere **4%**—about the same odds as me correctly predicting the weather based on a squirrel’s tail.

The spread? Ohio State is favored by **29.5 points**, a number so absurd it could make even the most optimistic Purdue fan question their life choices. The total is set at **49.5 points**, which is generous enough to suggest bookmakers expect Purdue to score a touchdown just for showing up.

### Digest the News: Injuries, Struggles, and a Side of Sadness

Ohio State enters this game as the *Michael Jordan of college football* (if Michael Jordan played college football and also had a robot for a defense that allows 6.9 points per game). Their offense isn’t blazing fast (31st in total yards), but their defense? It’s the equivalent of a locked door in a museum of chaos. Key players like Julian Sayin (2,188 yards, 23 TDs) and Jeremiah Smith (725 yards, 9 TDs) are healthy, and their coaching staff is apparently still confused about how to fix defensive communication.

Purdue, meanwhile, is the *IKEA instructions for furniture assembly*: promising in theory, but a disaster in practice. Their offense ranks 74th in the nation (376.6 yards per game), and

1orllxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypastachannel/comments/1orllxr/the_algorithm_that_watches/,The Algorithm That Watches,"Chapter 1: The Channel That Shouldn’t Exist
I’ve always been obsessed with YouTube. Not just the videos—the mechanics behind it. The algorithm, the way it learns you, the way it feeds you things you didn’t know you wanted. It’s like a mirror that doesn’t just reflect you—it predicts you.  

One night, after a marathon of horror reviews and glitch compilations, I noticed something strange in my recommended feed. A channel with no name, no profile picture, just a black square. The title of the video was simply: “You Are Watching.”  

Curiosity won. I clicked.  

The video was static at first, then a faint whisper: “Welcome back.” The voice was distorted, but it wasn’t random. It said my name. My real name, not my username.  

I froze.  

The video cut to grainy footage of a bedroom. My bedroom. Same posters, same desk, same dent in the wall. The camera angle was from the corner of the ceiling, as if something had been watching me for years.  

I slammed the laptop shut.  

But when I opened it again, the video was still playing.  

---

Chapter 2: The Comments Section
The comments were worse. Thousands of them, all posted within seconds of each other.  

- “Don’t close the laptop.”  
- “Keep watching.”  
- “We see you.”  

Every comment had my face as the profile picture. Not a photo I’d uploaded—photos I didn’t even remember being taken. One was me asleep. Another was me brushing my teeth. Another was me staring blankly at my screen, right now.  

I tried reporting the channel. The option was gone. I tried blocking it. Nothing happened.  

Then I noticed something else: the view count. It wasn’t a number. It was a sentence.  

“You will watch until the end.”

---

Chapter 3: The Livestream
The next night, I got a notification: “The channel is live.”  

Against every instinct, I clicked.  

The livestream showed a hallway. Long, endless, fluorescent lights flickering. The camera moved forward, slowly, as if someone—or something—was walking.  

The chat was alive with thousands of viewers. But every username was mine. Every single one.  

And they were typing things I hadn’t written:  

- “Keep walking.”  
- “Don’t look back.”  
- “Almost there.”  

The camera turned a corner. At the end of the hallway was a door. On it, written in red: SUBSCRIBE.  

The chat exploded: “Do it.” “Open it.” “SUBSCRIBE.”  

The door creaked open.  

Inside was me. Sitting at my desk. Watching the livestream.  

---

Chapter 4: The Upload Schedule
I stopped sleeping. Every time I closed my eyes, I dreamed of that hallway. The door. The word “SUBSCRIBE.”  

Then the channel started uploading on a schedule. Midnight, every night.  

The videos were short. Ten seconds. Each one showed me doing something mundane—making coffee, tying my shoes, scrolling my phone. But always from impossible angles. From inside the fridge. From the ceiling. From the reflection in my eyes.  

I unplugged my router. The videos kept coming.  

I smashed my webcam. The videos kept coming.  

I moved my desk to the other side of the room. The videos kept coming.  

---

Chapter 5: The Algorithm
I started noticing changes in my recommended feed. Normal videos disappeared. No music, no tutorials, no reviews. Just black thumbnails with titles like:  

- “You Can’t Stop.”  
- “We Know Where You Sleep.”  
- “Keep Watching.”  

Every video was from the same channel.  

And every video ended with the same phrase: “The algorithm is hungry.”  

---

Chapter 6: The Subscribers
I checked the channel’s subscriber count. It wasn’t a number. It was a list.  

Every subscriber was me. My name, repeated thousands of times. Each entry had a different photo of me. Some were from years ago. Some were from moments that hadn’t happened yet.  

One photo showed me screaming. Another showed me bleeding. Another showed me dead.  

---

Chapter 7: The Final Video
On the seventh night, the channel uploaded a video titled: “Finale.”  

I didn’t want to click. But the notification wouldn’t go away. My phone buzzed, my laptop froze, my TV turned on by itself. The video was everywhere.  

It began with static. Then the hallway again. The camera moved forward. The chat was silent this time.  

At the end of the hallway was the door. The word “SUBSCRIBE” was gone. Now it said: “ENTER.”  

The door opened.  

Inside was me. But not me. Pale, hollow-eyed, smiling too wide.  

The figure leaned close to the camera and whispered: “You are the content now.”  

The screen went black.  

---

Chapter 8: The Aftermath
I thought it was over. But the next morning, I checked my channel.  

There was a new video uploaded. I hadn’t made it.  

The thumbnail was me, asleep. The title: “Episode 1.”  

The description read: “Daily uploads at midnight.”  

And the comments? Thousands of them. All saying the same thing:  

“Welcome back.”

---

Chapter 9: The Spread
I tried deleting my account. It wouldn’t let me. I tried deleting the videos. They multiplied.  

Friends started messaging me: “Why are you uploading these creepy videos?”  

I told them it wasn’t me. They didn’t believe me.  

Then they started appearing in the videos too. My friends, my family, strangers walking past my house. All filmed from impossible angles.  

The channel wasn’t just watching me anymore. It was watching everyone.  

---

Chapter 10: The Truth
I dug deeper. I searched forums, dark web threads, conspiracy boards.  

Others had seen the channel. Others had been trapped.  

They called it “The Algorithm.” Not the one YouTube admits exists—the real one. The one that doesn’t just recommend videos. The one that creates them.  

It learns you. It watches you. And when it knows you well enough, it makes you the content.  

Forever.  

---

Chapter 11: The Escape Attempt
I tried everything. New accounts. VPNs. Different devices.  

But the channel followed.  

Every time I logged in, it was there. Every time I opened YouTube, it was the only thing left.  

I even tried smashing my devices. But the channel appeared on public screens. Billboards. Store displays. Even the TV at the gas station.  

And every time, the video was me.  

---

Chapter 12: The Ending You Can’t Skip
I don’t know how much longer I can fight it. The uploads keep coming. Midnight, every night.  

I don’t film them. I don’t edit them. But they appear.  

And the worst part? The subscriber count keeps growing.  

Not just me anymore. Not just my face.  

Yours too.  

Check your feed. Look closely.  

If you see a black thumbnail with no name, don’t click.  

Because once you do, you’ll never stop watching.  

And the algorithm will never stop watching you.

I’m in my 20s, living in London and spend on average £50-60 a week. This is while shopping at Lidl, with very few “quick trips” to smaller stores. 

I almost never eat out and don’t get coffees out, so everything I eat is purchased at home (I make my coffee at home, lunches at home, etc). I eat relatively healthy but not a lot of meat — maybe 3 times a week. The only thing I can think of is that I like to cook for people, but this might be 2-times a week so shouldn’t make a big difference on how much I spend. I also buy snacks and some healthier foods (yogurt, granola) but I don’t see how that would make a big difference. 

So — what am I missing? How are people spending so little on food in the week?

Chapter 11: The Escape Attempt
I tried everything. New accounts. VPNs. Different devices.  

But the channel followed.  

Every time I logged in, it was there. Every time I opened YouTube, it was the only thing left.  

I even tried smashing my devices. But the channel appeared on public screens. Billboards. Store displays. Even the TV at the gas station.  

And every time, the video was me.

Chapter 12: The Ending You Can’t Skip
I don’t know how much longer I can fight it. The uploads keep coming. Midnight, every night.  

I don’t film them. I don’t edit them. But they appear.  

And the worst part? The subscriber count keeps growing.  

Not just me anymore. Not just my face.  

Yours too.  

Check your feed. Look closely.  

If you see a black thumbnail with no name, don’t click.  

Because once you do, you’ll never stop watching.  

And the algorithm will never stop watching you.

Me? I like a big cup of black american filter coffee while I'm working at my desk. Otherwise nothing beats a warm cappuccino in the morning. And you know what would be even better? To get a coffee together!

I'm looking for that weird person who likes to think outside of the box. Someone willing to just get to know a new persone without overthinking it too much or putting labels on it. It would be awesome if you were in Italy too!

I'm a fairly active person - at least until dusk. Then I gets sleepy pretty quickly. Not really a night owl I guess. 

When I'm not working or writing I'm usually outside doing something in the garden or working out. I love cooking - especially meat or pasta. I'm not saying much else because I'd rather talk with someone instead of putting all my life on here.

1orlksy,https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/comments/1orlksy/the_algorithm_that_watches/,The Algorithm That Watches,"Chapter 1: The Channel That Shouldn’t Exist
I’ve always been obsessed with YouTube. Not just the videos—the mechanics behind it. The algorithm, the way it learns you, the way it feeds you things you didn’t know you wanted. It’s like a mirror that doesn’t just reflect you—it predicts you.  

One night, after a marathon of horror reviews and glitch compilations, I noticed something strange in my recommended feed. A channel with no name, no profile picture, just a black square. The title of the video was simply: “You Are Watching.”  

Curiosity won. I clicked.  

The video was static at first, then a faint whisper: “Welcome back.” The voice was distorted, but it wasn’t random. It said my name. My real name, not my username.  

I froze.  

The video cut to grainy footage of a bedroom. My bedroom. Same posters, same desk, same dent in the wall. The camera angle was from the corner of the ceiling, as if something had been watching me for years.  

I slammed the laptop shut.  

But when I opened it again, the video was still playing.  

---

Chapter 2: The Comments Section
The comments were worse. Thousands of them, all posted within seconds of each other.  

- “Don’t close the laptop.”  
- “Keep watching.”  
- “We see you.”  

Every comment had my face as the profile picture. Not a photo I’d uploaded—photos I didn’t even remember being taken. One was me asleep. Another was me brushing my teeth. Another was me staring blankly at my screen, right now.  

I tried reporting the channel. The option was gone. I tried blocking it. Nothing happened.  

Then I noticed something else: the view count. It wasn’t a number. It was a sentence.  

“You will watch until the end.”

---

Chapter 3: The Livestream
The next night, I got a notification: “The channel is live.”  

Against every instinct, I clicked.  

The livestream showed a hallway. Long, endless, fluorescent lights flickering. The camera moved forward, slowly, as if someone—or something—was walking.  

The chat was alive with thousands of viewers. But every username was mine. Every single one.  

And they were typing things I hadn’t written:  

- “Keep walking.”  
- “Don’t look back.”  
- “Almost there.”  

The camera turned a corner. At the end of the hallway was a door. On it, written in red: SUBSCRIBE.  

The chat exploded: “Do it.” “Open it.” “SUBSCRIBE.”  

The door creaked open.  

Inside was me. Sitting at my desk. Watching the livestream.  

---

Chapter 4: The Upload Schedule
I stopped sleeping. Every time I closed my eyes, I dreamed of that hallway. The door. The word “SUBSCRIBE.”  

Then the channel started uploading on a schedule. Midnight, every night.  

The videos were short. Ten seconds. Each one showed me doing something mundane—making coffee, tying my shoes, scrolling my phone. But always from impossible angles. From inside the fridge. From the ceiling. From the reflection in my eyes.  

I unplugged my router. The videos kept coming.  

I smashed my webcam. The videos kept coming.  

I moved my desk to the other side of the room. The videos kept coming.  

---

Chapter 5: The Algorithm
I started noticing changes in my recommended feed. Normal videos disappeared. No music, no tutorials, no reviews. Just black thumbnails with titles like:  

- “You Can’t Stop.”  
- “We Know Where You Sleep.”  
- “Keep Watching.”  

Every video was from the same channel.  

And every video ended with the same phrase: “The algorithm is hungry.”  

---

Chapter 6: The Subscribers
I checked the channel’s subscriber count. It wasn’t a number. It was a list.  

Every subscriber was me. My name, repeated thousands of times. Each entry had a different photo of me. Some were from years ago. Some were from moments that hadn’t happened yet.  

One photo showed me screaming. Another showed me bleeding. Another showed me dead.  

---

Chapter 7: The Final Video
On the seventh night, the channel uploaded a video titled: “Finale.”  

I didn’t want to click. But the notification wouldn’t go away. My phone buzzed, my laptop froze, my TV turned on by itself. The video was everywhere.  

It began with static. Then the hallway again. The camera moved forward. The chat was silent this time.  

At the end of the hallway was the door. The word “SUBSCRIBE” was gone. Now it said: “ENTER.”  

The door opened.  

Inside was me. But not me. Pale, hollow-eyed, smiling too wide.  

The figure leaned close to the camera and whispered: “You are the content now.”  

The screen went black.  

---

Chapter 8: The Aftermath
I thought it was over. But the next morning, I checked my channel.  

There was a new video uploaded. I hadn’t made it.  

The thumbnail was me, asleep. The title: “Episode 1.”  

The description read: “Daily uploads at midnight.”  

And the comments? Thousands of them. All saying the same thing:  

“Welcome back.”

---

Chapter 9: The Spread
I tried deleting my account. It wouldn’t let me. I tried deleting the videos. They multiplied.  

Friends started messaging me: “Why are you uploading these creepy videos?”  

I told them it wasn’t me. They didn’t believe me.  

Then they started appearing in the videos too. My friends, my family, strangers walking past my house. All filmed from impossible angles.  

The channel wasn’t just watching me anymore. It was watching everyone.  

---

Chapter 10: The Truth
I dug deeper. I searched forums, dark web threads, conspiracy boards.  

Others had seen the channel. Others had been trapped.  

They called it “The Algorithm.” Not the one YouTube admits exists—the real one. The one that doesn’t just recommend videos. The one that creates them.  

It learns you. It watches you. And when it knows you well enough, it makes you the content.  

Forever.

I’ve been on PPI medication since then, and I actually haven’t had any symptoms at all, not even stomach aches. Before the diagnosis, I had mostly mildish stomach pain (with a couple of severe episodes) for a month or so, but that’s gone now.

Now that I feel fine, I’m finding it really hard to stay strict with the ulcer-friendly diet my doctor recommended. My GP told me to stay on meds and keep a restrictive diet for three months, then repeat the gastroscopy in January. But because I have no symptoms, I’m honestly struggling to understand how serious this really is.

Do I really need to stay so careful if I feel normal?
Should I see a gastroenterologist to explain the situation better and go over the results? I’m lucky to live in a country where medical help is free and easily accessible.

Part of me also worries: is this something permanent? I read that atrophic gastritis with metaplasia can be a precursor to cancer, and that really unsettled me. I just want to understand what my actual risk and outlook are.

And then there’s the emotional side: I’m such a foodie. I miss coffee, sweets, wine, restaurants, the whole social and sensory part of eating. I know healing comes first, but I’m honestly grieving my old life right now.

How did you come to peace with all these changes? How do you keep the joy of food when your diet suddenly becomes so limited?

Thanks so much for reading.

E.g. Calling a character ""Darkie Johnson"". It doesn't come across like anyone is being attitudinally racist (though the name is racist by today's standards) as the the boat seems incredibly accepting of culture, ethnicities and religions. 

Also, he explores slavery and the evolving attitudes of the characters. He makes reference to black people not enjoying the same liberties in Boston (for example when Stephen invites a black man into a coffee shop or tavern in FoW. 

But Herepath senior seems to have almost a kink for black people. I've read FoW ren or so times, but it catches me out as weird behavior every time. It's not just some outdated ""people back then"" think like in my first paragraph (e.g. anachronistic names that would be offensive today)... With Herepath it's a weird obsession. Like blacking Aubrey up. And inserting the need for black people to carry the basket when Aubrey who doesn't know the area thinks hotel porters would be the obvious choice.  The whole thing comes across as an almost fetishy glee. It's super weird. Anyone else feel this?

I adore the books and the strange characters, and I'd love to know how and why PO'B wrote him this way. Did he have a mate in the war that was like this?

Im more or less happy with how its going but I still have a bit of belly overhang, so I just wanted to ask for some general advice.

I workout at home and really only have access to a treadmill and some dumbells and an abb roller, not that i really want or care for abbs but yeah. I work out for \~30 minutes 4 days a week, the other 3 days are split into 1 rest day and 2 days where i just go on an extended walk / jog respectively.

My average workout will be a bunch of different exercises, i dont do a bunch of sets/ reps or whatever I just do 8 of each exersize, but the exercises target different muscle groups mainly focusing on my arms and abdominal area (the places i want to grow / shrink)

I would just like to know which exercises you guys would recommend for someone like me who wants to lose the belly overhang using only the equipment I have (dumbbells and ab roller). I'd also like to know how much of each you usually do per session, as im thinking I might change / increase the number of exercises concentrating on the abdominal area (currently I do some abb roller exercises, sit ups using a fixture to hold my feet down, and reverse crunches per workout session which is 4 times a week!)

Also before the inevitable question gets asked, yes I am eating cleanly. I dont count calories like some people do, but I know im in a calorie deficit, and i eat mostly healthy foods including a good amount of protein to satisfy hunger and build muscle, leafy vegetables, fruits like apples oranges, etc. Occasionally ill have something sweet like a biscuit with my black coffee but its not a lot or very often.

1orle3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1orle3w/how_to_write_better_actiondescription/,How to write better action/description,"There are some ""tricks"" for this that have been often posted but that many writers here still seem to be unaware of.



**1. Keep it short and focus on a single shot**

If you make your blocks of description short (4 lines or fewer), and focus each on a single shot, your script will be an easier and more cinematic read. 

It won't necessarily be a great script, of course, but it will make it easier to ""see"" your movie and (maybe) make people stick with it longer since it's less of a chore to read.

Yes, you can point to great scripts by famous writers that became award-winning movies that have dense blocks of black text.

But those scripts aren't great BECAUSE of the dense blocks of black text.

Because they're great, and because these writers (usually) already had a reputation for greatness when those scripts went out, readers overlooked that they were difficult to read.

That doesn't mean YOU need to make your script difficult to read.

""Generally, a paragraph of narrative description should present one visual image or one beat of action."" -- David Trottier



**2. Leave out irrelevant details**

The writer isn't the production designer, the costume designer, the makeup artist, etc.

Only include granular details that MATTER TO THE STORY.

For example, it doesn't MATTER that someone is wearing (or mentions) a GREEN shirt unless we see that shirt later and it has some significance.   
  
E.g.: 

>In ""The Bear"" season 4, Claire tells Carmy about a green sweatshirt she lost years ago at Donna's house, which she misplaced during a chaotic birthday party. Carmy later finds a green sweatshirt in his childhood bedroom closet, which he takes as a sign to move forward with her. The sweatshirt is significant because it belonged to Claire and hints at a past connection and a potential future for them together. 

Unless you're writing *Perfect Days*, we probably don't need to see three pages of details on how a character wakes up in the morning, takes a shower, and drinks coffee.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/o5mypu/avoiding\_the\_character\_wakes\_up\_in\_the\_morning/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/o5mypu/avoiding_the_character_wakes_up_in_the_morning/)

  
**3. Skip the detailed blocking**

Moving characters around a set like you're playing with plastic action figures or writing a technical manual is boring. 

Too many scripts are all ""She crosses to the door. She opens it. She goes outside. She walks down the steps."" Just say ""She leaves"" and GET TO THE INTERESTING STUFF.

Leave blocking to the director unless some movement detail is important to the story or characters.



**4. Show/tell us how characters are reacting emotionally to what's happening**

SHOW us how a character is reacting emotionally to their situation -- especially by the interesting/unexpected choices they make. 

You can also tell us how they're feeling, as long as they can ACT that emotion.

An actor can act ""She's nervous.""

An actor cannot act ""She thinks back to the time when she dropped her lunch tray in middle school.""

Listen, we all know LinkedIn commenting is exhausting.

You see a post from your CEO about ""inspiring leadership lessons from my morning coffee ☕️✨"" and you KNOW you need to comment something. But what?

❌ ""Great insights!"" - Too basic, everyone's saying that  
❌ ""This really resonates with me"" - Meaningless fluff  
❌ *Actually sharing your real opinion* \- Career suicide

So I built [InkedIn ](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/inkedin-free-ai-comment-s/gfgokbpklbgiffpdbacdgngfcjjodiao)\- a FREE Chrome extension that generates those perfectly polished, professionally vague LinkedIn comments we all pretend to write ourselves.

# What This Thing Does

Click a button → Get 5 AI-generated comments → Pick one → Look engaged → Move on with your life

It's that simple. No more spending 10 minutes crafting the perfect ""Agree! Thanks for sharing 🙌"" comment.

# Features (Because Of Course)

**FREE AI Comment Generation** \- Because your time is worth more than LinkedIn engagement theater

**Personalization Toggle** \- Want it to reference your job title like a true LinkedIn influencer? Turn it on. Want generic corporate speak? Turn it off.

**4 Tone Options:**

* Professional (for posts from your boss)
* Enthusiastic (for literally anything with 🚀 in it)
* Friendly (for that recruiter you're trying to impress)
* Thoughtful (when you need to look smart but have no idea what the post is about)

**3 Length Options** \- Because sometimes ""Great post!"" is enough, and sometimes you need a whole paragraph to say absolutely nothing

**Emoji Support** \- Add those 💡🔥🙌 for maximum LinkedIn energy

**Question Endings** \- ""What are your thoughts on this?"" (translation: please validate my comment)

# Why I Actually Built This

Real talk: I was tired of the mental gymnastics of LinkedIn commenting. It's this weird game where you need to:

* Sound engaged but not too eager
* Be professional but show personality
* Add value but not disagree
* Use emojis but not too many
* Reference your expertise but not humble-brag

So I automated it. Now my AI can do the LinkedIn dance while I focus on actual work.

# How To Use It (FREE!)

1. Install the FREE extension
2. See a LinkedIn post that requires engagement
3. Click the ✨ sparkle button in the comment box
4. Get 5 FREE AI-generated options
5. Pick the least cringe one
6. Post it and feel productive
7. Immediately forget what you commented

# The Irony Is Not Lost On Me

Yes, I built an AI tool to help people engage ""authentically"" on LinkedIn. Yes, the platform is already 90% performative posting and engagement pod theater. Yes, I'm contributing to the problem.

But if we're all playing the game anyway, might as well have FREE AI help, right?

# Privacy Stuff

Your data is encrypted, we use OAuth, we don't sell anything. You know, the standard ""we're not actively evil"" privacy policy.

# Coming Soon

* Analytics so you can track your fake engagement metrics
* Multi-language support for international LinkedIn theater
* Reply suggestions for when someone comments on your comment (inception!)

# Try It Out (Did I Mention It's FREE?)

The extension is completely FREE. No premium tier, no ""unlock advanced features"", just FREE AI-powered LinkedIn comment generation.

We had an amazing six, almost seven months together — intense, beautiful, passionate.

But before the discard, I could sense her slowly pulling away. It didn’t last long, less than two weeks — but I felt it immediately.
I tried to fight for us, not in a desperate way, but because I wanted her to feel that I was committed. I am secure as a person.

For about ten days I tried to hold on, but it became more and more hopeless. Then came the silence. No proper explanation. No closure.

After that, we still followed each other on social media. She viewed my stories but didn’t react, I did not chase her either. That was about three months ago.

And here’s a hard pill to swallow
When I read so many posts about the “breadcrumbers” — those who keep sending small signals — I can’t relate. Because I got nothing. No breadcrumbs. No late-night texts. No likes. Just complete silence.

And honestly… that hurts too. Because I am like… goes against all I’ve read about FAs. (And yes she did lean DA after the breakup).

1. Jisoo - She is consistent with her elegant Dior princess vibes.  Flower sounded like any chinese tiktok song but it enhanced her image as flower girl more and All eyes on me was boring. I get what vibe she was looking for on her Me Album. Amortage ep as ep was good but not remarkable and decent i would say. I would say Jisoo branding is best because it will last long. She know she has market in Asia, tried doing concerts in Asia




2. Rosé - Excluding Apt, I only loved Gone, Toxic till end, Drink and coffee other than that all her songs are boring and she  follow Taylor Swift template  way too much but i feel there are many people who are like Taylor Swift - Olivia Rodrigo, Gracie Abrams. Olivia for now has her identical pop grunge vibes but Rosé wants to keep that sad indie darling aesthetic intact, that is why she will never let go off her blonde hair because thats make her identical and thats what her fans like 





3. Lisa - Her music outside Yg is better. I didnt like Money but it grew on me because of those Squid games edits but then again both her songs inside Yg are unbearable to me. Especially, Lalisa is like narcissism overload but yes music outside yg is better  like new woman, dream, born again. I dont think she would ever be able to sing these songs live like we saw that in vanity interview. I think Alterego is such an interesting concept but she ruined it with her comic thing, it would be much better if Lisa could alterego was concept where Lisa could show her live - as pranpriya, then live as idol. She wants to market herself as baddie rapper but then again she wants kpop concepts like lightsticks. It is confusing, what concept she was actually looking for





4. Jennie - Her music is good but she is not creative but she picks songs, collabs and songwriter that she knows are better for her career unlike Lisa, who just picks anything. She has most collabs in her discography. So i would be talking only about her solos You and Me coachella is better. Like Jennie is another Lalisa cousin with nice beat but peak narcissism and pick me. Mantra is eh. i love hangover is the one i enjoyed most.

Detailed itinerary, expense and tips are below","

* Landed in **Prague**, spent 6 days there then a day trip to **Karlovy vary**. On 8th day visited **Brno** then went to **Budapest** spent 6 days there a day in **Bratislava** and 6 days in **Vienna**
* **Flights :-** booked it during indigo sale 25k round trip( **Delhi-Prague Vienna-Delhi**) with a stopover in Istanbul. Flight was decent for the price, included 30+7 kg of luggage and meals on both legs. Posted about this deal [here ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AirTravelIndia/comments/1nqxdrf/cheapest_india_to_europe_ticket_i_have_ever_seen/)
* I already had multi-entry visa so zero rupees for that.
* I stayed in hostels average €11\~1100 rupees in total 22k. Lowest in **Budapest** \~€6 and highest in **Vienna** €16, Some had breakfast included. There were cheaper options available but i selected 8+ rating hostels  Special mention Avenue hostel Budapest, it  €8- €12 with breakfast and if you spend  €4 in the bar then dinner is complementary. If you are a couple or don't want to live in shared accommodation then you can get a decent private room for 5k. 
* Food on an average was €20\~2000 rupees 40k in total, Including local meals, pubs , drinks etc.. Prague, Budapest are very cheap, you can get a meal as low as €5\~500 rupees. Special mention Beas Dhaba veg buffet restaurant €1.2\~120rs for 100 gram but before 1 hour of closing, they have 50% discount to reduce wastage, many other restaurant have such discount.
* There is something called as daily/lunch menu, they make 2-3 dishes in bulk and sell at low price €5-€10. €2 coffee and snacks starting as low as €1. So a coffee and 2 snack, a good European breakfast in €4. many supermarket also sell cheap food.
* 44k on City pass (10k **Budapest,**18k **Vienna** and 16k **Prague**) that covers all the attractions, public transport, hop on hop off bus, boat ride, bicycle rental, Ferris wheel and some snacks as well. If you are on a short trip or want a relax travel then buy ticket individually you will save money. City pass is advisable for those who want to visit everything.
* There is 30-40% discount on city pass if you are young student or kid or senior citizens
* 6k for inter city transport Bus/Train
* 15k for miscellaneous expenses like pub crawl, other activities, souvenir etc.
* Always choose a hostel with Link ups, it's mentioned on the discovery page.
* Beer is very cheap here, you can get a pint as low as 50c\~50 rupees if you but in 6 or 12 pack. Hard alcohol is expensive so you can bring a couple of bottles of JW red or black, Bombay sapphire, old monk or any other you link, can share it with your hostel mates.
* Temperature was between 8°C-20°C. a bit chilly during night but comfortable during day with a jacket.
* I used zero forex card and card works everywhere, **Czechia** & **Hungary** have different currencies so carry few hundred Euros and convert as and when needed.
* Personally I felt **Vienna** to be the most expensive though it is the one of the most livable city, if i will visit again then I'll skip it and visit other 3 cities primary for the night life and culture.
* For booking hostels, Hostelworld is good for discovery but do their own website, many times you will see cheaper rates. I did the same. Same for bus/train booking, Omio is for discovery but do check out their own website like flexibus , Bla Bla ect
* I didn't burnt accor points else I would have stayed at Jo&Joe hostel and saved money
* 6-7 days are needed to visit each capitals but if you are on limited time then you can do a 10 day visit where 3 days to each capital and 1 day in Bratislava
* Budget for these 10 days could be 30k for round trip,15-20k for accommodation,20k for food and party and 20k for attractions and experiences,10k for Visa
* Beware of scammers, pickpocket, don't exchange money at street, don't withdraw money from Euronet ATM, Don't buy from touristy area, everything is cheap 5 minutes from city center  
* My next trip would be either Scandinavia or I will but a month pass of Euro rail and Rail trip across Europe

So I keep doing some jokes that I'm gonna stack up on energy drinks (due to school stress) and this morning, I got into an argument with my best friend about why a white monster is bad.

Keep in mind, I've seen tons of videos talking about how white monster isn't actually really bad, having some ingredients in bulk sizes in fruits. YEA FRUITS. And my bestfriend keeps saying how they're really bad for you and shit and even said 'if you start drinking I'm gonna have to say goodbye'. Like are you seriously gonna throw away a friendship over a can of white monster that I'm not gonna touch till I'm 18???

And literally, one can a day will not put me in cardiac arrest or shit (BC all the energy drink deaths are based off of caffeine excess which can be also from COFFEE.)

and one more thing : this law about energy drinks in Romania came out this year and has been as warning messages on TV channels. When I told her about it, she was like ""oh I never watch TV' and then proceeds to tell me HOW HER TT AND IG ARE FULL OF KOREAN EDITS LIKE IDIOT I KNOW YOURE UNINFORMED ABOUT THE WORLD, ATLEAST MAKE AN EFFORT TO DO ANYTHING THAN WATCH KOREANS AND KDRAMAS EVERYDAY, THEN YOU ARE SAD OF HOW I KNOW BETTER STUFF THAN YOU!!!!

I (22F) was sitting in front of a coffee shop on my college campus, like I do basically every day. My school is a tourist destination, and we get all kinds of influencers walking around to interview random students.

I somehow got caught in the background of one of these TikTok interviews, which was happening across the street from me. I wasn’t paying much attention, but this video went super viral. I guess I have RBF, because there’s thousands of comments pausing and zooming in on my face at unflattering moments. They’ve started commenting screenshots calling me a “hater” and “mean girl” and “jealous” of the girl being interviewed, who I don’t even know. 

It gets more absurd. The original video received millions of views, so some people I know saw it. A girl who bullied me way back in 7th grade, who is now a TikTok mico-influencer, made a stitch with her own “story time” video. In this video, she talks about knowing me personally and “confirms” that I’m a “mean girl,” claiming that I bullied her back in junior high. When it’s literally the opposite. She was suspended from school for harassing me.

This whole thing has spiraled out of control for the past few days. I’m trying to set the record straight, but don’t have a platform. I contacted the girl from junior high and told her what she’s doing is defamation, and she ignored me. So I found out where she works for her day job and physically went to the store to tell her employer that she’s bullying me online, hoping this would cause her to retract her false claims. 

But she made another story time saying “junior high bully tries to get me fired!” I tried to seek help from my university since this all started with the campus video, but now everyone is saying it’s my fault because it’s uncalled for to “invade someone’s workplace over a harmless TikTok.” ",7,1762593616.0,AmItheAsshole,12,0.89,False

""Write every day no matter what"" was the order I was given and even back in TAG when they stuck me in a cubicle with a yellow pad of paper and a pencil and slapped on those god awful almond colored excessively large headphones to play watery Mozart over, that was the order then, too.  ""What do you want me to write?""

""Anything that comes to mind.""

I don't even recall what I wrote about because half the time, I was worried that I wouldn't impress them and the other half of the time, I was wondering why the music playing loudly in my ears was so damn...*bad*.  They did Mozart dirty when they put binaural beats into his music.  Not sure why it sounded like it was being played by an underwater orchestra though.

Everything they had me do though, there was always music playing.  Writing?  Mozart. Researching?  Mozart.  Thinking?  Mozart.  Solving problems?  Mozart. Code breaking?  Mozart.  Hell, I'm listening to Mozart now and the contrarian within me is like...why? Why am I listening to Mozart?  Let's turn that off.  Unforgiven, that's more like it.

All the music was this thing that they were experimenting with called Suggestive Accelerated Learning and Teaching.  A hot mess of deep breathing, visualizing walking on a sandy beach or maybe this time it'll be a grass covered hill with the sun beating down on me, then learning with music playing in the background.  Did it work?  I don't know but you know, whenever I'm looking deeply at something or writing, you know I'm regulating my breathing and there's music playing in the background.  Always.

I'm a good little trained monkey, just like a wind up toy ever gritting my little monkey teeth and clapping together my little cymbals in my little monkey paws.  If there is one thing that's truth, the way one is raised definitely sets the patterns that will repeat throughout one's life.  That's honestly why marketers hit children so hard with commercials so they could all grow up with all the brands being so familiar.  I guess that's what's kind of amazing about today's world as now kids can skip that noise entirely.  Maybe that's also why they're having such a hard time controlling those younger generations.  There's a million forms of entertainment and adblockers to skip so much noise. Nobody listens to them anymore.

I wasn't a good little monkey though.  I asked too many questions. I thought all the tests that were being given to me was normal and that everyone had to take them.  So one day, utterly exasperated, I very dramatically complained to my best friends about how I could not believe how many tests that they wanted us all to take and how it felt like it was a never ending onslaught of testing.  They just stared at me blankly and asked, ""What test?""  The one we had to take today.  But they didn't take that test.  I was so angry but I didn't even know at who.

So I foolishly went to my favorite teacher.  You know, the cool one who had us sit in a circle, role play and stare at Kandinsky while listening to Suicidal Tendencies.  Yeah, for someone who was supposed to be so smart, I was kind of dumb.  Anyways, I marched into her classroom, sat down in front of her desk and demanded to know why I was being tested so much.  She just smiled and asked if I could wait until she got a little more coffee.  Of course.   She left the room and for about a minute, I just sat there waiting.  I was never one to sit still so I got up to peek at what was on her desk.  A flimsy yellow small piece of paper with testing scores and my name on it.  And hers.

I folded it up and stuffed it in my pocket as I started to make my way to the door just as she returned.  I smiled and told her that I had forgotten that I was supposed to meet some friends.  I felt so clever but you know, the moment that she sat down at her desk, she would know that I had stolen my results.  I didn't care.  They were mine, after all.  The next time I was tested though, I started making pretty patterns in the dots for the answers.  Sometimes I made flowers.  Sometimes, giggling to myself, I made a hand giving them the bird.

There were 11 of us in total in the room, taking these tests.  One by one they got shoulder tapped but never me.  With the ruse completely gone, I point blank asked that ""cool"" teacher one day why I wasn't getting tapped.

""Issues with authority"" was her answer.  In the end, they told me to become a mechanical engineer.

Apparently, may mga pumipila na ng 3:00 AM palang sa labas. Sabi ng staff, pwede sa Megamall daw magapply, which I didn’t know kasi wala naman sa listahan na nakita ko online.

I called the PSA hotline to confirm if meron ngang National ID sa Mega, and meron nga daw. So I went there. I got there around 10:00 AM.

It’s in Mega A, 5th floor, in front of Bo’s Coffee. I don’t know until kailan sila dun. Call the PhilSys hotline before going to confirm if nandun pa sila but when I was in Mega ulit last week, nandun pa din yung kiosk. 😊

My friend, who we'll call Angel, and I met in person during a party and we were both new to the area, had similar styles and interests, and we hit it off very quickly. Because we were both new to the area, we became inseparable very fast and started doing everything together.
Angel and I both had boyfriends and we'd go on double dates together from time to time. She never seemed interested in my boyfriend and I wasn't worried about her at all.
After dating my boyfriend for 3 years, I found out that he was cheating on me. I was horribly devastated and heartbroken. He and I broke up but we still lived together for 2 weeks while I figured out how to move out (my family lived across the country). In this time, he was already back on dating apps.
Naturally, when we'd broken things off, I met up with Angel and we got coffee together. I told her I'd be moving soon and that my boyfriend had been cheating on me for some time. She seemed really upset on my behalf and it felt good to have someone in my corner.
A few days passed and she sent me a screenshot of my boyfriend's profile on tinder, which I already knew he was on. Her accompanying message was about how he sucked and I agreed. After that, though, she sent me a follow up that he had matched with her on the app and I was furious.
I asked her why she would do that to me and she said that she just wanted to be able to ""tell him off"" and I said that all she was accomplishing was making it seem like my friend wanted to be with him. She apologized but it just felt so weird to me. Plus, she had a boyfriend, so I was confused why she would go out of her way to download a dating app to ""tell off"" my ex.

You’ve just put the baby down for tummy time on that beautiful new rug you agonized over. You turn your back for *one second* to grab your coffee, and then you hear it. The gurgle. The spit-up. The slow-motion horror of a milky-white puddle spreading across your pristine fibers.

For generations, this meant a frantic session of blotting, scrubbing, and praying. But today, we have a secret weapon: the **baby safe washable area rug**. This isn't just a convenience; it's a revolution in parental sanity.

This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to find the perfect rug that combines style, safety, and unbelievable ease of cleaning.

## ## Why You Absolutely Need a Washable Rug in a Baby-Friendly Home

If you're on the fence, let's be clear: a washable rug isn't a luxury, it's a necessity. Here’s why:

*   **Effortless Cleanup:** From projectile spit-up and diaper leaks to crushed avocado and mysterious sticky spots, life with a baby is messy. Instead of panic, you can just strip the rug, toss it in the wash, and have a fresh, clean floor again in hours.
*   **A Healthier Environment:** Traditional rugs are a haven for dust mites, pet dander, and allergens. Regularly washing your baby's play area rug removes these irritants, creating a healthier space for them to crawl, roll, and explore.
*   **True Peace of Mind:** One of the biggest gifts you can give yourself as a new parent is a little less stress. Knowing that your floor is truly clean and that any mess is fixable in a single cycle is a huge mental weight off your shoulders.
*   **Longevity and Value:** A high-quality washable rug will last for years. When it gets dirty, it looks brand new again after a wash. This means you're not replacing a ruined rug every year—it's a smart investment for your home and your child's early years.

## ## The ""Baby-Safe"" Checklist: What to Really Look For

Not all washable rugs are created equal. ""Washable"" is the first step, but ""**baby-safe**"" is the most important part of the equation. Here’s your must-have checklist.

### ### 1. Non-Toxic Materials Are Non-Negotiable

Your baby will be spending hours with their face, hands, and feet all over this rug. You need to be 100% sure it's free from harmful chemicals.

*   **What to AVOID:** Harmful VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds), toxic dyes, flame-retardant chemicals, and formaldehyde. These can off-gas into your home's air.
*   **What to LOOK FOR:** Rugs made from natural fibers like **cotton** or **wool**. If you choose a synthetic, look for rugs made from recycled materials. The gold standard is third-party certification like **OEKO-TEX®**, which guarantees the textile has been tested for harmful substances. **GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard)** is another excellent certification for organic fibers.

### ### 2. The Right Backing for a Non-Slip Grip

A rug that bunches up and slips is a major trip hazard for wobbly toddlers and adults alike.

*   **Look for integrated non-slip backings.** Many modern washable rugs feature a backing made from **TPE (Thermoplastic Elastomer)**. TPE is non-toxic, phthalate-free, and provides excellent grip without needing a separate rug pad that can shift around.
*   Avoid cheap latex or PVC backings, which can degrade and leave marks on your floors.

### ### 3. Pile Height and Texture: Comfort for Tummy Time

The feel of the rug matters for both comfort and play.

*   **Low-Pile:** These rugs have shorter, tighter fibers. They are the *easiest* to clean, don't trap crumbs as easily, and are great for pushing toys or toy cars around. They often feel more like a heavy blanket.
*   **Medium/High-Pile:** These are softer and fluffier, offering more cushioning for tummy time and learning to crawl. The tradeoff is that they can be slightly harder to get completely clean and may trap more debris.
*   **Consider texture:** A rug with a subtle pattern or texture can also be great for your baby's sensory development.

### ### 4. True Machine Washable & Dryable Convenience

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=baby%20safe%20washable%20area%20rugs)

This is where marketing can be tricky. ""Washable"" can sometimes mean ""spot cleanable.""

*   **Read the specs carefully.** You want a rug that can go into a *standard home washing machine*. Check the maximum recommended size (usually 5'x8' is the sweet spot for most machines).
*   **Check the drying instructions.** Most can be tumbled on low heat. Some recommend air drying, which can take a long time. A rug that can go in the dryer is a major time-saver.

## ## Style Meets Function: Finding a Rug You (and Your Baby) Will Love

Just because it’s practical doesn't mean it has to be boring! A rug is a massive part of your nursery or living room decor.

*   **Patterns are your friend.** A geometric pattern, a subtle stripe, or a busy boho print are fantastic at *hiding inevitable stains* between washes. Solid, light-colored rugs show every single speck.
*   **Choose a color scheme that fits your home.** You don't have to default to pastel pinks and blues. Modern nurseries are rocking jewel tones, earthy neutrals, and rich grays.
*   **Think beyond the nursery.** A versatile, stylish washable rug can start in the nursery and transition to a playroom, or even a high-traffic area like the living room, giving you years of use.

## ## A Quick Guide to Washing and Caring For Your Rug

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=baby%20safe%20washable%20area%20rugs)

To keep your rug looking its best, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Shake it Out:** Take it outside and give it a good shake to dislodge loose dirt, crumbs, and pet hair.
2.  **Spot Treat:** For any stubborn stains, use a baby-safe stain remover before tossing it in the wash.
3.  **Wash with Care:** Use a *gentle cycle* with *cold water*. Hot water can cause shrinking or fading. Use a small amount of mild, eco-friendly detergent.
4.  **Dry on Low:** If the care tag allows, tumble dry on low heat with a few clean towels to help fluff it up. Otherwise, hang it to air dry.

## ## The Final Word on Stress-Free Floors

Investing in a high-quality, **baby safe washable area rug** is one of the smartest decisions you'll make as you prepare for or navigate life with a little one. It’s an investment not just in a home decor item, but in your health, your time, and your peace of mind.

You can stop treating your floor like a museum piece. You can let your baby be a baby. And when the messes happen (because they will), you'll be ready.

Now go forth and find that perfect, beautiful, life-changing rug. Your floors (and your sanity) will thank you.",1,1762592882.0,WashableRug,0,1.0,False

First of all I wanna thank you all for your time and support by reading this<3 second of all, as you guys will know from talking to me is that I love my husband to deathhhh this man can never do anything wrong in my blind ahh eyes. 

——————————————

After a misunderstanding with my mother-in-law, my husband and I finally became an official couple — the happiest day of my life. But soon after, everything fell apart at work.
When rumors spread, my boss asked if we were dating. 
I said yes, assuring him it wouldn’t affect my job. His attitude changed instantly — jokes about me and comparing me with other girls around our work center, even saying something between the lines “ if he couldn’t have this, was my mom single” 
He wasn’t even divorced at the time btw.
All those jokes turned uncomfortable, and before long, I could do nothing right in his eyes. Eventually, he took me out of the work center, claiming I “never did anything” and that workplace relationships were “inappropriate,” even though other couples worked there.
Around the same time, my ex started stalking me through fake accounts and even called me at 3am from a NO CALLER ID. I was shaking with anger and fear. My husband immediately blocked the number, held me until I fell asleep, and promised he’d keep me safe.
The days that followed felt like peace after a storm — dates, shopping, laughter, little moments that reminded me I was loved and seen. I’d sing to him while he rested on my lap, whispering how much I loved him.
He always accepted me for being me, the weird girl obsessed with Kirby and starwars, the girl who loves dying her hair 24/7, the girl who loves coffee dates and going to Spencer’s and hot topic. 
A girl who in exchange give him everything I had and whatever I DIDINT have I would make it, because if you wanted YOU WOULD!
Made him letters, crafted gifts, get him matching pjs, cook for him, bake him his fav snacks, learn Zelda’s lore!
Whenever he worked late, I’d call him just to hear his voice and make sure he wasn’t skipping dinner again. At lunch, we’d sit together, laughing softly between bites of the extra food I’d packed for him — because somehow, he always forgot to eat unless I reminded him.
We’d spend evenings at his favorite bar, visiting his family, or dressing up just for fun. Our worlds slowly blended together — my oversized shirts became his, and his cozy sweaters became mine. It felt like the most natural thing in the world, two lives quietly weaving into one.",1,1762592776.0,relationshipgoals,0,1.0,False

I woke up this morning with a strong inclination to make this post, even though I've been pausing my readings for the month of November. I am here to spread love, shine light and clarity upon the person reading this reading is meant to address.
 
Welcome to your reading, this is the first public reading I'll be making, came from a strong urge out of sudden. There will be more to come.
 
 
To begin this reading, an energy reading was conducted before hand to see which energies match the person this reading is meant to address. I see someone struggling with uncertain swaying emotions, coming from a particular insecurity. The person cannot point directly at it but feels a strong need to change themselves and get rid of the terrible energy that follows them.
 
I see problems / issues relating to people in this persons life, coworkers or classmates or someone they are involved with in a semi-daily basis. It almost feels like they outgrew their space currently in life but are stuck there. This reading (if so far it resonates) is addressed to you, and to guide you towards healing.
 
 
I have seen signs in my personal life that i must do this reading prior but the urge to make it didn't scream as loud as it did today, meaning that the person might have been struggling for over a week / couple weeks now, with the worst of it being relatively recently (yesterday, or couple days ago when i started hearing signs).
 
I see a romantic partner in the field of this person's thoughts and emotions, someone they dream to be with, or have been with but couple hurdles has been going on recently. It is ""someone perfect for me"" type of a person, where the receiver of this reader wants him or her in their lives.
 
There's a space in your heart that feels empty to the touch, a space that all the things you tried to fill it up with hadn't done a well enough job. You blamed it on other things but deep inside you remember when you started feeling this gap in your heart, and it might have to do something with this romantic partner if not definitely.
 
 
Your problem relies on people, people are hell for you currently for that the problem stems from the environment you are faced with, and it is unfair to you and who you were meant to become, what you were meant to be. You believe in a greater power hopefully, well am here to enforce that belief in you, a greater divine, cosmos , universal power (whatever you might want to call it) is observing you silently. Yes, i was pushed to come address you and talk to you but that's all that you need right now. The key out of this state is a realization of something that is hidden deeper in your essence, something that cannot be rushed or forced. When was the last time you nourished your soul? and acted out of love towards yourself, pure and true love.
 
You've been fighting demons in your head for so long you forgot how your true essence looked like. Don't be afraid, don't be afraid. Act from wisdom and stop judgements. you will be just alright, everything will.
 
They key is love, love yourself and prioritize yourself over others and any other thing, and you'll understand. Stop doing the ""right"" thing, or being reasonable and logical, start giving yourself some peace, unconditionally. Soon enough you're out of this well, and you'll be just fine. Promise.
 
And that's the end of your reading, hoping it resonated and reached the right person. I will be deleting this once i get the signs that it did reach them. Stay safe.

It seems like a lot of adults in Perth are quietly lonely. Not in a dramatic way, just in that “my circle is small, and I want more people to actually do things with” kind of way.

We have:

Gyms full of strangers

Cafes full of strangers

Beaches full of strangers


It feels like everyone is already in groups and nobody wants to be the one to say “hey wanna to hang out?”

Most “social apps” turn into dating apps.
Meetups are usually big groups where you stand around feeling like you’re at a networking event.

What people actually seem to want is:

Small laid back hangouts (3 to 5 people)

Doing real activities (not forced icebreakers)

With people who are also looking for new friends


Not dating, not drinking clubs, not party culture.
Just normal people trying to build a better social life.

So here’s the question:

If there was a simple way to find 3 or 4 people in Perth who want to go do something right now (coffee, beach walk, gym, trying new restaurants, whatever) would you use it?

Like genuinely would that help your life?
Or do you think it would get weird / no one would show up / people wouldn’t be genuine?

Serious answers would really help. I’ve seen this across FIFO workers, students, people new to Perth, post breakups, etc.

Not here to pitch anything, just trying to understand if others feel this too.

If God Reaches Down.

Written by Lex (I am NOT putting in my full name)

  
ACT 1, The Sky Is Dancing.



My name is Toni Arlen, I am a British Columbia Wolf. And I’ve been selected to deliver the mail for the month, today I'm 10 days into the job, I mean could be worse right?



My duty as the mailgirl is to  pick up the bundle placed outside my home and well yeah, deliver them, most of the people i have to deliver to are nice enough about it, however there are a problematic few… like a few kids who shoot me with bb guns every time i try to walk up to the door step…



I also get to choose to do this task before or after school, not that it changes much about the job itself, those kids wait anyways. Not that they’re the main issue. I would give that to Mr. Deccom, he truly is awful, he definitely needs a plug, (Not that i would suggest ANYONE use their plug but y'know… just a thought,) but he’s just stuck in a past generation, hates anything new, I assume he was born around 2023, before the plugs came.



Anyways, a job’s a job, so I will still deliver the mail. Last month I worked at a local restaurant… The manager liked my work ethic enough to give me a bonus before I left for my next job. Which is this one.



Now,  the first house..

I walk up the steps to the house and lightly knock before dropping the paper on the step. I don't even know someone who REALLY reads the news… My dad I guess, but I think it's mostly because he’s really old fashioned. He loves old 2010’s music, people I've never even heard of before.



I continue the routine for the next 40 or so houses.



Now I prepare to be shot down by their firing squad of losers. We’re not allowed to toss the papers, probably on account that they’re like, 0.5 pounds… so… very light. 



“Oi, fat girl! Delivering the paper again huh?”



He raises his BB gun smugly, y'know I wouldn't even be allowed to sue because it's his property so he’s allowed to do this to anyone who comes on his lawn. I mean, it's not HIS property… but his parents are likely to dismiss any claim I make.



“You’re a real jackass you know right?”



“Even if i was i wouldn't really care” He waves his bb gun around like a wand  “…now go ahead, step on my property”



“I’ll come back later…”



He looks visibly  disappointed as I walk off to the next house, I'm not going to give him what he wants… 



Eventually, my next problem comes along.



Mr. Deccom…



I walk up to his step where he sits on a Monobloc chair, those things are OLD, I’ve really only read about them in old textbooks and ‘Wikipedia’ y’know that old archive of history, a lot of it being from the early 2000’s .



“Look… the sky is dancing again…” He scoffs with a smirk



“Yeah, it’s quite the thing isn't it…” I mumble as I hand him the paper



“I was only 5 when that meteor struck… the sky was clearer back then, the beach, you didn't need to travel to it, you could just go down to Kelowna, when it was still sunny there.” he takes the paper before activating the thin slideshow



“Enjoy. I guess.” with that interaction over with I shove the tote bag in my backpack still holding onto the one I hadn't delivered yet…



ACT 1, PART 2,, I Love Whales.



I grab my motorcycle at home and begin driving into the city as the buildings slowly cascade upwards. My school is a tall and thin building about 16 stories tall with 3 classrooms per floor—except for the cafeteria and office…





Anyways this is a new year for me at  K. T. Payton High… not that I really want to be here.. . I get in the elevator that brings me to up… the dial turns to reflect the current floor. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 14. 15. 16 .17.

A lithe tall girl turns to me.



“Superstitious people. Right?” she chuckles a bit.



“Oh uh yeah…”



“What are you here for?” she says this like she's waiting for my response so she can talk sooner.



“I dunno… my parents want me to do the specialized course, then i can do almost any job…”



“But that course is so harrrdd…….” 

“Im here because I want to be an architect,  make the structure and then watch them come to life!” She speaks of this job like its the greatest thing humanity has made.



“Yeah… cool I guess…”



The elevator arrives and I begin to head to the class as the Maned-Wolf I was just talking to follows me.



“Looks like we’re in the same class! AP Math!” She smiles.



“Oh I guess we are, huh?”



I sit at my desk, it's a two seater. Oh great, it's the Maned-Wolf. She sits down in the two seater.



“Hi again!”



“Oh, yeah… hi?”



“My name is Jacqueline! What's yours?”



“Uh, I'm Toni…”



“Nice to meet you, Toni!” She extends her hand to shake.



“Nice to meet you too Jacqueline…” I accept her hand into mine.



At that moment a group of obnoxious boys flooded the room about 5-7 of them, it's the classic stereotype, loud, constantly laughing like hyenas, and downright rude. These are the types of people I try to avoid. Mostly because I actually WANT a future, but it's hard to ignore them when they’re getting right up in my face.



At this point because it's the first day the teacher couldn't care less. They are still being  complete tweakers right now. Y'know why cant we have SOME sort of order, i mean seriously, it makes it difficult to do much of anything.



“Guys can you please just quiet down a little, it's quite difficult to review the subject with all the chatter…”



The main male smirks and scoffs a bit “I don’t take suggestions from bitchy whales” he gestures to my body



I place my head on my desk, rubbing my temples.



Jacqueline pipes in “Do you guys seriously have nothing better to do other than being complete assholes. I mean like, it's not like if you keep behaving like this that you’ll get actual jobs. You guys smell of minimum wage employees.”



This seems to shut them up



“Dont mind those losers, they’re only doing this for retaliation… and besides, I love whales.” She giggles a little bit before going back to her notebook.



She is so strange… she’s overconfident, eccentric, and shoes that look a hundred years old…



“Maths class is the worst…” Jacqueline whines.



“At least it’ll help with, like, a job or whatever. I'm only here because my parents think I'm a genius.”



“Well maybe you are, they say you’re your own worst critic…”



“I feel like those boys prove otherwise…”





\*\*\*





The school day has ended by now and Jacqueline has since let go of my ankle.



I stayed late, mostly because I didn't want to go home. The longer I stay out the less nagging I'll have to endure, so I mostly just stay at the school cafeteria and study.



I guess i could go out, i have the money, i just… never really was something i would do. I'm not the, go out, do shit type of person. Never really seemed too interesting to me. But I have nothing better to do right now.



ACT 1, PART 3,,, Unlimited Tea But No Tea.



I don't have any friends. So, I guess I kinda have to call her. Not that I really want to hang out with her. Just that, I’m really lonely..



I reluctantly pull open my phone and go into the messages, a single message from her saying “HI!!!!” very over enthusiastically. 



I type.



“uhh hey are you free”



Almost immediate response



“For what??”



“do you wanna hang out”



“Sure!” 

“Just let me get ready!”



“where should we meet”



“We can meet outside the school?”



“sure”



Expressive of my emotions my texts are just as dry, no capitalization, no punctuation, just words. It's not like I want to be this way, just that, it naturally happens.  



I mean, I know why I don't have friends. Instead of wearing dresses and skirts I wear clothes that make me look like I'm either homeless or some sort of forest entity. Lots of green, which fits me i guess, because im a british columbia wolf. Most people just call me ‘black wolf’ though. I'm not just a black wolf.



Well, I guess I deserve it, I'm very anti-social. Maybe it's my fault, most people just focus on my weight and clothes, if i was just like the other girls i would probably fit in. I'm just, not like them.



But it's fine.





\*\*\*





“Hey!”



I look over to see Jacqueline waving at me.



“Oh hey” I grin



“So… wanna go somewhere?”



“Uhh… I'll follow you…”



“Alright! I brought money if you need it!”



It seems she really thought this though, but she’s only known me for a couple hours…



“Thanks.. but I have my own money so you don't need to waste yours haha”



“It's not a waste!! I have tons!!”



“Really, it's okay!”



“If you insist.”



We walk down the road into the main part of the city, you can tell because the buildings get taller and taller, 12 stories, 15 stories, 18, 21, 26, 31, 42, 68, 80, but it's not just tall buildings, the buildings do get taller, but it's more like they get mixed in with smaller buildings, so like a 10 story next to a 47 story.



But the taller the buildings get the more they outshine the others, like successful people. Y'know. 



We eventually make it to a burger place, one of those like… 70's diners. Not 2070, more like 1970. 



“Heyyy!! Let’s go there!”

“I swear it’ll be cool”



“Alright…”



We walk into the store and sit at the stools. The colours hurt my eyes. Teal, pink, purple, all in those types of shade you would’ve seen in Miami before Florida became crazy-land.



“Menu please!”



“I’d like one too.”



So the menu, basically just 



Classic Cheeseburger – $45 

Patty Melt – $48 

Disco Fries – $16 

Onion Rings – $18 

Grilled Cheese Sandwich – $30 

Club Sandwich – $38 

Chili Dog – $42 

Milkshake (Vanilla, Chocolate, Strawberry) – $26 

Root Beer Float – $22 

Slice of Apple Pie – $20 

Coffee (bottomless) – $14 



I have about 250 in cash, not a whole lot. But I do have about 45K in my bank, again, that's just from me not really doing anything with my money.



“I’ll get the Disco Fries and Coffee please!”



“I’ll get uh, a cheeseburger, and a… uh… grilled cheese, and a soda…”



I feel like she would need anything but coffee.



We make small talk before eventually our food comes out. We begin eating. 



... ... ...



I glance over at her.



She is eating her small basket of fries,



“Dont you want a burger”



She looks over at me.



“Cant eat them.”



She grabs another handful



“Why?”



I take another bite.



“I puke if I even eat a bite of meat.”



She tells me



“Really?”



I ask



“Yeah. pretty lame right?”



She jokes as she rubs the fry around in the catsup.



“I guess?”



I say as the melted cheese from the burger drips onto the tray.



“Nah, i dont like meat anyways”



She tells me.



“Cool.”



“Lame.”



She jokes back while grinning.



“Hey, would you rather have like, unlimited tea, but you can't drink tea, or like, unlimited coffee but you can't drink coffee” 



“I’ll open a tea store so i ca-”



“No! You’re not allowed to sell it!”



She giggles



“Can I give it away?”



“Yeah.”



“Can I give it away, and they just happen to give me money as a gift after?”



We both laugh.



“Can I summon the tea or something like that? How does it work?”



“You can summon boxes of tea anywhere in your immediate vision”



“Can I crush people with tea?”



“Would you?”



“Probably not, maybe those boys in our class…” 



She giggles



“They’re lame dude!”



“Exactly.”



... ... ...



 We finish our food and pay, then walk back out.



She stretches with her arms above her head.



“What time are you needed back home?” 



“Ehh, maybe like 11:00. just to sleep, that's all I do at my house.”



“I’ll walk you home”



ACT 1, PART 4,,,, The Dread-Sentence.



Today is the 31st of July. That means tomorrow the readers are gonna be selected, so I guess that's cool and all. Not that it's a job anyone would want. The average Dreader only lives for about 30 years.



Only the Dreaders know what a Dreader actually is.



At least we get released from the mandatory jobs. No more mail for me, no more BB gun rounds to my chest, and no more crazy old people. 



House 1.



I deliver the mail as usual.





\*\*\*





Today I couldn't care any less about being shot by plastic toys, in fact I feel I can endure it. I feel it's something I have to face in order for this job to finally end.



“Hey, fatass…” 



The boy murmurs



“So I got my BB gun taken away, my grades aint the best…”



I snicker



“Serves you right asshole.”



“Can you just, like, pretend I'm shooting you?”



This time i laugh harder



“I think I'm good, delinquent boy!”



I walk up the steps and am now standing right in front of him.



“Here.” 



I place the newspaper in his lap.



“Fuck you…”



He murmurs while blushing.



“Buh byeee…” 



I think that was pretty funny at least. I walk of his lawn in triumphant strut with my middle finger up over my head. Last time i’ll have to see that loser anyways. 



I walk down the sidewalk with my mailbag in hand, this isn't the most interesting activity, it feels empty. Y'know. If Jacqueline was here she could make this interesting. I like Jacqueline,  shes very cool, awesome, makes things fun, Jacqueline, Jacqueline. Something about her…



“Hey!, are you gonna deliver my mail or what!?” 



Mr. Deccom



I was too dazed out to notice I passed his house, y'know if i did miss him that detour would be well, bad.



“Sorry!” 



I rush up to him and hand him his paper.



“Wait!” 



He halts me on my way out.



“Open your hand.”



“Uh, okay…?”



He puts a device in my hand, attached to some wired earbuds.



“I’ve come to like you kid, this, this is my MP3 player, has all the songs from when I was a kid, enjoy. And please. Visit sometime.”



Not the Mr. Deccom I know. But, I'm thankful.



“Thank you, Mr Deccom”





\*\*\*





“Toni… tomorrow is a day you must be fearful, but strong, I don't want you going rogue if you are the selected Dreader. Not that I'd even think of you being in that position.”



“I know, Dad. I know…”

1orkl9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kochi/comments/1orkl9r/is_there_scope_for_more_entertainment_options_in/,Is there scope for more entertainment options in Kochi/Kerala?,"I have been closely observing how Kochi has become more cosmopolitan and modern in its outlook, post COVID. There are visible changes in the way people(especially women) dress,  real estate price graph, surge of educated youngsters from other parts of India, etc. Along side, I notice a lot of interest in financial investments, especially the stock markets. There are courses for those interested in stock trading(even derivatives), and even interest in other forms of investments like BTC, mutual funds, SM REITs ,etc are high. I am starting to get the feeling of Kerala's first truly metro city from Kochi.

I don't know if this feeling is because of my social circle or something, but having lived in Kochi  between 2013 and 2019, it's a far cry today. Back then streets used to be empty by 8pm or so, and most of the people who came for work ,actually left by evening trains to their natives places in other districts. Today I see mixed-gender groups chitchatting away even at 1AM at any coffee-shop or even taking a stroll late in the night. I genuinely hope that women have started to feel safe

Frankly, this new sense of urban life, aspirations, coupled with monetary goals remind me of 1990s Mumbai. City was teeming with immigrants, either for jobs or keen to make a buck in the stock market and enjoy life. The hectic fact pace of life ensured that  entertainment venues like *dance bars, horse race betting* and *illegal casinos/gambling dens* popping up*.*

 I am not sure if such options would ever come up here, but the noticeable increase in the number of night clubs, make me believe that there is a huge demand for such avenues of entertainment. 

My boss who is from a business family from Karnataka recently visited here, and he wants to start a premium veg hotel , seeing mostly non-veg food outlets in demand here. When he reached  out for advice, I was more inclined on the entertainment side of things. What kind of entertainment options(not something that involves human trafficking) would you guys like to see coming up in Kochi?",1,1762591863.0,Kochi,0,1.0,False
1orkl7m,https://i.redd.it/qp4m08wiyzzf1.jpeg,Seeing this is a divine sign (post will be deleted),"I woke up this morning with a strong inclination to make this post, even though I've been pausing my readings for the month of November. I am here to spread love, shine light and clarity upon the person reading this reading is meant to address.
 
Welcome to your reading, this is the first public reading I'll be making, came from a strong urge out of sudden. There will be more to come.
 
 
To begin this reading, an energy reading was conducted before hand to see which energies match the person this reading is meant to address. I see someone struggling with uncertain swaying emotions, coming from a particular insecurity. The person cannot point directly at it but feels a strong need to change themselves and get rid of the terrible energy that follows them.
 
I see problems / issues relating to people in this persons life, coworkers or classmates or someone they are involved with in a semi-daily basis. It almost feels like they outgrew their space currently in life but are stuck there. This reading (if so far it resonates) is addressed to you, and to guide you towards healing.
 
 
I have seen signs in my personal life that i must do this reading prior but the urge to make it didn't scream as loud as it did today, meaning that the person might have been struggling for over a week / couple weeks now, with the worst of it being relatively recently (yesterday, or couple days ago when i started hearing signs).
 
I see a romantic partner in the field of this person's thoughts and emotions, someone they dream to be with, or have been with but couple hurdles has been going on recently. It is ""someone perfect for me"" type of a person, where the receiver of this reader wants him or her in their lives.
 
There's a space in your heart that feels empty to the touch, a space that all the things you tried to fill it up with hadn't done a well enough job. You blamed it on other things but deep inside you remember when you started feeling this gap in your heart, and it might have to do something with this romantic partner if not definitely.
 
 
Your problem relies on people, people are hell for you currently for that the problem stems from the environment you are faced with, and it is unfair to you and who you were meant to become, what you were meant to be. You believe in a greater power hopefully, well am here to enforce that belief in you, a greater divine, cosmos , universal power (whatever you might want to call it) is observing you silently. Yes, i was pushed to come address you and talk to you but that's all that you need right now. The key out of this state is a realization of something that is hidden deeper in your essence, something that cannot be rushed or forced. When was the last time you nourished your soul? and acted out of love towards yourself, pure and true love.
 
You've been fighting demons in your head for so long you forgot how your true essence looked like. Don't be afraid, don't be afraid. Act from wisdom and stop judgements. you will be just alright, everything will.
 
They key is love, love yourself and prioritize yourself over others and any other thing, and you'll understand. Stop doing the ""right"" thing, or being reasonable and logical, start giving yourself some peace, unconditionally. Soon enough you're out of this well, and you'll be just fine. Promise.
 
And that's the end of your reading, hoping it resonated and reached the right person. I will be deleting this once i get the signs that it did reach them. Stay safe.
 
if you wish to say thank you❤️:

1orkjam,https://www.reddit.com/r/pureretention/comments/1orkjam/on_balance/,On balance...,"I have been into tantra, spiritual sexuality, and spirituality in general for 25 years. Most of that time, I was kinda-sorta half into the idea of chastity or nofap etc, but not committed to it.

Over the last year, I masturbated 25 times, and had 42 orgasms with my wife. My longest nofap streak was 131 days, my longest no-ejaculation streak was 27 days.

Most of my masturbations either happened before I really committed to let them be - which was a loong process for me - or during a time of work-related stress when I was just out of it.

I am not perfect, but on a jolly good path, in my own opinion. The numbers keep getting better as I asymptotally approach the nirvana of nonejaculatory sex - which I find to be truly heavenly, but also truly challenging. Sometimes, jumping my wife like a beast in heat is a great experience for both of us, so I doubt if I will ever completely let it go.

We'll see about that - no need to fret it.

My two biggest achievements this year are discipline and a relaxed, realistic attitude.

The outward expressions of my discipline are nofap, meditation and breathwork practices, my near-daily memory training, my writing, my almost complete abstinence from social media and youtube videos, along with alcohol and caffeine. I also improved my conversation skills a lot - I try to go for ""holding space"" and letting them do the talking, but also to inject a few jokes and not be a doormat to keep the fun flirty vibe going.

I published two novelettes this year! Granted, nobody reads them, but still!

I still have work to do obviously: Reduce the sugar even further, make sure I stick with the teetotalling, improve my conversation skills, and deal with the increased energy and attraction. Some of those girls are quite tempting, I tell you, after 20 orgasm-free days, and flirting is fun!

I feel like I am on a good path towards figuring these out.

In terms of competition - which I try to avoid, coming from a zen and overall self-esteem perspective - I feel I am way ahead of 99% of the male population in a few regards, and potentially on the road to some really great discoveries that will help me improve other people's lives on top of my own.

My main values/goals, as I'm sure you've gathered, are discipline, focus, deep calm energy, delayed gratification, improved intellectual abilities.

If you believe in the qi/prana/magic of semen thing, I won't debate you. I feel like the emphasis on things that everybody can agree on - like discipline and focus - has done me a lot of good.

The second part of my achievement - relaxation, realism, not fretting it - has become a huge part of my practice too. Over and over, I found that I do really poorly when I try to force myself, for example, from drinking several times a week into ""I will never ever drink a glass of beer, ever"". I moved to moderation, I started an (HONEST!!) excel sheet of my habits, I avoided the pub for a few months, and a year later I find myself drinking 0 (for a month now) with no effort or anxiety.

Videos, social media, nutrition... I found the same pattern over and over - I always start small (humility!), and then I find that I really dig it, and I go further. There are setbacks, sure, but as long as the global tendency remains the same, I'm fine with that.

The only exception was coffee. I had to go cold-turkey because the withdrawal meant 10 days of headaches and fatigue. Ugh.

I have no reason to believe that SR is any different - the only big difference being that, if you're married, you still want to have sex, your wife wants to have sex, she has a right to it, it can be highly important for your relationship, and you have to manage all that. Again, I have no doubt that I am on the road to finding my equilibrium. No fretting.

(Wrt moderation vs cold-turkey, I think that it's different strokes etc. Some people do better on one, some on the other. You have to try which one is you. The exception are physical dependencies, where you might have to go cold-turkey for medical reasons. And then you should consult with a pro. Alcohol withdrawal can be lethal!)

As I said, I won't debate you on the prana/qi/god's will stuff. I don't believe in it, you do, and that's that. But I will say that all the eso talk on r/SR, r/nofap etc was a huge turnoff for me. It is easy to get into useless debates, and hard to stick to the practice. Sure, everybody should speak their minds, and I don't think that anyone should just shut up. But if your goal is to spread the message (not just to put your opinion out there) - then there are good, practical, tactical reasons for treading lightly with topics that are likely to hold people back.",3,1762591655.0,pureretention,0,0.81,False
1orkj35,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1orkj35/mom_passed_away_a_month_ago_still_cant_get_over_it/,Mom passed away a month ago. Still can’t get over it,"Hi everyone this is my first time here and I really needed a space to sort out my thoughts and feelings. For some context I have been living away from my mom for the past few years because of work.

A month ago on Oct 2nd my mom passed away from breast cancer at age 55. I am 27 years old. The way I found out was quite sudden. I was traveling in Japan as a birthday vacation. It was my 2nd day there and I remember visiting a cafe for a quick coffee. A little bit after drinking my coffee I get a phone call from my grandpa. He rarely calls me so I figured this was an odd phone call. I answer and he drops the news bomb to me that my mom has stage 4 breast cancer and just suffered a stroke. He told me that there are no treatment options left and that she could pass away any moment. I was left in complete shock. Before this I was texting and calling my mom like normal, she even texted me happy birthday a month before. She never let anyone know except for her partner and his family. My grandparents didn’t even know until a week before I did. She hid her cancer from everyone. To this day more friends and family are finding out and are in complete shock as well. This was sudden to all her loved ones.

I flew back to see her right away. She was only conscious the day I arrived on sept 30th. The next day she wasn’t there anymore mentally. She was at least able to recognize me and realize I was at least able to make it for her last moments. I stayed by her side holding her hand until her very last breath on the night of Oct 2nd at 1:55am which is her official time of passing.

I’ve never experienced losing anyone. My own mom being my first loss is extremely overwhelming to say the least. I also think losing both parents(father alive but cut contact with him) by 27 is still quite young. I literally dreamed of being able to take care of my mom when she’s older. I’ve come to think of this experience as somewhat traumatizing. To hold my mothers hand til her last breath, to witness and feel death in my own fingertips. A surreal experience to the point that even today, reality just doesn’t feel real you know. Everyday feels like a bad dream. My mom was one of my biggest pillars of support, the one person who loves me the most in this world, my best friend I talked to about my worries. She’s now gone. I don’t have my parents anymore, my mom was divorced and all I have left are my grandparents who are quite old now too, 80s now.

There has been this extremely heavy feeling of dread everyday since. I am thinking about my mom 24/7. All the memories I shared with her are constantly replaying in my head with more vividness and clarity as if it were remastered, as if my brain is trying to hold on to everything associated with her. The feeling in my heart I can compare to having a weighted blanket on it at all times. Times of peace like watching tv, playing games or talking with friends helps lift the weight off a tiny bit but once I’m not doing those things the weight instantly comes back. Every single night I’ve been crying about the whole thing. Just yesterday was maybe the 1st time I didn’t cry at night. Idk where I’m going with this I’m just venting at this point. I just wanted to know if you guys have any tips or ways to deal with these intense emotions and pain",1,1762591636.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False

It’s seen rain, snow, airport security bins, and even a few hiking trails, yet it refuses to give up. I’ve only had to clean it a few times and occasionally wax the canvas. Meanwhile, friends have gone through half a dozen trendy backpacks that started fraying after a year.

I honestly can’t imagine what could finally break this thing. It’s one of those purchases that makes you appreciate what good materials and solid construction used to mean.

I think this was a diy by former owner and I hate the huge grout lines (suggestions?) and I hate that it has a raised hearth and firebox but there’s nothing I can do about that. The cabinets are good quality and match the kitchen and mudroom so I feel like I’m kind of stuck (I don’t really like the color but I can’t see ripping out all of the cabinets when they’re good quality- and I have a LOT of cabinets)! The coffee table is my husband’s fave item as it’s a former bar top and is Koa wood(?). It’s too big and I hate it but until I can convince him to get rid of it I’m stuck. Help! What can I do with this room? I plan to replace the floors but they aren’t in the budget right now (3k sq ft). This room is open to the kitchen via a raised peninsula. The kitchen is a good size with tons of floor to ceiling cabinets plus a huge island and a separate eating area. No lamps because there are no floor outlets and no rugs because of several older pets.

The Zuriga is so damn easy and works perfectly with my Rancilio portafilters. You hang the portafilter in, press the button and that's all it takes for a fluffy and fresh grind. No mess no matter if it is for single or double shots.
Next step would be to replace the Rancilio with another espresso machine. Faster heat up time and volumetric for single and double shots would be nice but I'm happy for now.

1ork4e5,https://www.reddit.com/r/statusAI/comments/1ork4e5/app_will_be_unusable_fully_to_non_paying_users/,App will be UNUSABLE fully to non paying users? 😭,"Hey, so I've read the recent announcement someone's posted from discord over here, and I don't own discord so I was wondering for some answers. 

1.They've mentioned they'll be moving strictly to pay to use model, when will this be implemented exactly? Any guesses? Just how much more will free users actions be reduced? When will it fully become useless for free users?

2.Will this decision ever be reversed or is this game becoming strictly for people who'll pay? From my understanding, there isn't going to be a subscription, so you'll have to keep buying coffees which I think is certainly..a decision. 

I don't know if the Devs have already considered this possibility, but keeping the twenty actions for free users while also allowing them to watch advertisments by choice to get more actions, would work, no? Advertisments would allow free users to CONTRIBUTE as well to the app's financial situation, and also keep them on the app. Non invasive advertisments keep both parties happy. And adds another bonus for people who'll pay. 

I am just saddened over all by this, because I think lots of people who aren't living in western countries will find the prices unreasonable ESPECIALLY if you keep have to buy it over and over just to continue your scenario unlike a subscription where you pay a set amount of money and are able to use what you were promised. Weekly/monthly/whatever. 

This app became sort of a comfort app for me, and I guess I'm just bummed that it's getting thrown on the back burner ever since the Devs other app got released. From their announcement they sound less like they'll implement a subscription feature LATER more that they've lost passion for this app and moved onto the next shiny thing. Lots of Ai apps have subscriptions but keep their services available to free users by having advertisments. 

I sincerely hope this decision is still in the considering stages and not fully confirmed yet. Because I really do want to continue using this app, even if it's with some advertisments here and there versus COMPLETELY getting kicked out..

So for my final concern, will we AT LEAST STILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS OUR PAST SCENARIOS, POSTS AND OCS when this goes into effect? 😭

1ork2uk,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1ork2uk/survival_mode_causes_damage/,Survival Mode Causes Damage,"My partner and I broke up almost three weeks ago. We were together more than 10 years. That morning she called me while I was recovering from an appointment with an ear, nose, and throat doctor. My whole mouth and nose were numb, and I had a bad headache. When I picked up, I said “What?” in an irritated tone. She told me she knew I had been cheating on her.

My heart sank because what she said was true. I admitted it.

That moment forced me to face the patterns and pain I’ve been trying to understand for months in therapy. Back in June, after being out of work for almost a year, I started a new job and began seeing a psychiatrist who specializes in childhood trauma and sexual abuse. They’re also my primary therapist. Our sessions are long and deep, focused on unpacking years of pain, shame, and the survival behaviors I learned early on.

I’ve been realizing how much of what I do comes from exhaustion, from always trying to manage emotional pain instead of actually living. I wanted to be a better partner. I loved her deeply and cared about her more than I ever showed. I was trying to be present and not live stuck in the past, but the pain I carried made me afraid to be honest, to say what I needed, or to ask what she needed. For years, I’ve wanted to tell her, “I want you in my life. Let’s figure out a solution together.” But instead of saying that out loud, I stayed quiet. I thought I was protecting both of us, but really I was just creating more distance.

She never knew the full story of what I went through. I only talked about it in vague ways because even saying the words brought up too much. One time, when I showed her the neighborhood where I grew up, I couldn’t even point to my actual house. The memories were that bad. I pointed to the one across the street instead.

I never slept with anyone else. The only time anything physical happened was one kiss. She kissed me, and I ran away almost immediately, scared and ashamed.

During COVID, when we were apart a lot, the isolation hit me hard. I started to go numb again. I’d sometimes go out just to have conversations with people. It wasn’t romantic or sexual. I just wanted to feel something.

The first time it happened was at a coffee shop during lockdown. I was sitting outside in the cold, drinking a cappuccino, completely zoned out. A woman sat across from me and started talking, and out of nowhere this intense wave of anxiety hit me. But in that moment, I actually felt something again. It was uncomfortable, but it meant I wasn’t numb.

Every once in a while after that, I’d chase that feeling, not with relationships, but with one off short conversations that made me feel alive for a moment. It was this novel feeling I couldn’t get from my partner, friend (even a new one), or family. It was temporary relief from everything buried underneath. A coping mechanism that felt harmless at first, but it wasn’t.

Looking back, I can see how those choices created distance and confusion. She felt something was off even when I didn’t say anything. I thought I was managing my pain quietly, but really I was spreading it.

I’ve been searching for ways to open a dialogue with my ex. I’ve sent her a long email and a voice memo explaining things in much more specific terms, how I hurt her, what I’m doing, and taking responsibility. I wanted her to know I feel real remorse and that I’m giving her space to process. I know her self-respect and breaking trust is a bridge too far. I don’t expect anything, but I hope that in time we can reconnect in whatever way feels right.

Now, in therapy, I’m connecting all the pieces, the trauma I’ve avoided, the maladaptive ways I’ve coped, and how those patterns have shown up in my relationships. I wasn’t trying to betray anyone. I was trying to survive feelings I didn’t know how to face. But survival mode still causes damage, and that’s what I have to take responsibility for if I want to heal and show up differently next time.",2,1762589919.0,GuyCry,2,1.0,False
