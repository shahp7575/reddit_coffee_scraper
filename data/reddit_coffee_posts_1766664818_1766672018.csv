I'm fairly new to the city and have been strolling around exploring – right now chilling near Phoenix Marketcity in Viman Nagar. Loving the vibes here so far!

Looking to connect with cool people (guys or girls) for casual chats and hangouts. Nothing fancy – just good conversations over coffee, sharing gossip, hobbies, favorite books/movies, travel stories, likes/dislikes, or recommendations for hidden gems in Pune (cafes, food spots, or chill places).

I'm into reading (fiction, self-growth stuff), trying new eateries, light walks/exploring neighborhoods, and just relaxed vibes. If you're around and up for grabbing a coffee or chatting, DM me or comment below!

Thanks!

After putting the final touches on our setup, and having a celebratory beer, it was nearly 1 a.m. As luck would have it, as my head is on its way down to the pillow, my 9yo daughter walks in and says she can't sleep. I walk her back to bed only for her to visit four more times between 1 and 3 a.m. Fortunately, during those 2-hours in pieces together about 60 minutes of sleep. 

Before I go further, my wife and I decided to try letting all three of our kids (9yo daughter, 7yo son, and 4yo son) sleep in the king bed in our guestroom. So, inevitably, my daughter's up-and-down excitement woke both her brothers and at 3 a.m., they were all wide awake and chatting away. After a few warnings (gentle and stern) between 3 and 3:30, we thought they were going to go back to sleep. The 4yo had different plans and started chatting again. We resorted to moving them all back to their own beds -- and by that, I mean 2/3rds of the children ended up in our bed and between 3:45 and 5:45, we were able to squeeze in another 60-90 minutes of sleep.

I'm groggy and longing for a nap, but that can wait. For now, I will bleary-eyed sip on my coffee as o assble a Hot Wheels track and Lego set.

So here is the problem especially with women. Whenever I wanted to travel to a new place I searched the same thing, 'is this place safe to go'. Not the crime rates , just general safety, how safe is for women, how safe is neighborhood or transport . I tried asking many people, all answers were just based on 'vibes',. Safety is best if people share there experience and google reviews are too generic , ratings are based on 'how good the coffee' was, not on safety !

Most of the times I found myself in the room , I wanted to travel solo but same safety anxiety and no real data to see. It is so frustrating ! Maybe you guys can also relate, if you are living alone. As a student and traveler it is so frustrating to sit in front of screen for 5 hours just searching same question. 

So, I started building a product called 'Safe or Not', a just type in the location and all stats in one place, even for streets. You can share the experience so other people can travel better.

---

I've been grinding with the ESP since early March of 2023.  I've always weight input and output, because the grinder sometimes has a bit of retention.

Even when coffee in/out weights were within 0.1 grams, I soon noticed that if my first shot of the day was dialed in, my follow-up shots were running faster, with less pressure and with a higher flow rate, as if I'd adjusted the grinder about two steps coarser.  I'd been making this step adjustment manually to circumvent the issue.

Recently, I had an email conversation with Baratza about this, because I thought it might be grinder related.  It turns out, it is.

After eliminating causes  due to roast, cleaning, group head temperature, or grinder mechanical issues, they suggested retention as a possible cause.  They wrote:

> There is also a small effect from retention and exchange. Like any
> grinder, the ESP holds a small amount of coffee in the burr chamber
> and chute. The first grind of the day can include some older, slightly
> drier grounds from the previous session. Follow up shots are fully
> fresh coffee, which often behaves differently and more predictably.

I now run a small purging dose before the first grind of the day, and my grinds are much more consistent, shot to shot.",1,1766671360.0,FlairEspresso,0,1.0,False

Need advice to settle my anxiety.,"I’m off for Xmas but back in work in a few days and I’m so sick with anxiety. How can I fix this before I go back?

So made a couple of coworker friends when I started my job like 3 years ago. All became good mates. I got pregnant with my partner and was off for maternity. One coworker kept reaching out constantly for coffee, honestly it really annoyed me and I stopped responding. 

He sends me memes or whatever they are on my Instagram which I don’t even use but I get notifications for, he sends loads, like 20 a day, told him I don’t view them so stop sending them but he still does. I got rid of the app now anyway. 

Anyway after maternity his personality is so different. He’s a massive hypocrite, assumed everyone’s an asshole and if you even look at him differently he will go on a tangent about how they’re out to get him. He has overshared his personal life with me and when I shut it down he gives bland responses, obviously annoyed. I’ve been trying to distance myself from him but he does things where we end up having to work together. 

I genuinely don’t like the dude now. I feel like he’s so miserable in his own life he just spews hatred. His conspiracy theories are really out there and I don’t want to hear about them. I ignore all his messages and when I get into work he sends them through our work communication emails. He started finding out where I was located and what my scores are through shift which is something he shouldn’t have access to, I confronted him about it asking where he’s getting the info he told me “he has friends” I almost feel like my safety has been taken away from me.

In 2014 I was stalked by a coworker, they even followed me home and some nights would just park outside my house, that coworker used to do the same thing!!! I’ve checked in with all managers etc and there’s no rules that state that if someone asks where I was that they don’t have to tell them. I’m livid over it. This was a few days ago and I’m really struggling mentally to make it through Christmas because the sick anxiety feeling keeps cropping up. I got moved on my last shift after saying I felt uncomfortable and they told me that they can’t do the is every shift, they have to follow rota but made an acception for that one. 

I’ve ignored work messages and the last one is where he’s asked if “we’re” ok. I said no, and ignored any further ones. Then he’s whatsapped me and I have ignored them too. Anyway, a friend that drops me home from work has confided in me that he keeps going to them asking them if I’m saying anything/ asking what I’m talking about on rides home. I’m not going to be friends with this person again anyway but how can I avoid feeling so uncomfortable when I have to pretty much work with them?

It is my favorite. It's my specialty that I spent a while perfecting. My husband thinks I can be a bit of a snob about cheesecake because it has to be a baked cheesecake. I never do no bake. And when it comes out of the oven without a single crack in the top I show it off to him like it's a champion show dog. He doesn't even like cheesecake... Iknowright?!

For the first time I tried making and eating something that now comes in a close second. At first I wanted to make traditional tiramisu. I've liked it enough when ordering it at restaurants. I'd rather have it than no bake cheesecake But I cannot find lady fingers anywhere near me and I failed in my attempt to make them. I have made angel food cake before (I did this year too, just didn't show it) and I recently got a tiny loaf pan. I didn't even realize it is sometimes used in place of lady fingers to make a unique combination cake called Tiramisu Angel Food Cake. I made a bunch of small loafs, cut them in half, drizzled a little bit of strong coffee on the exposed crumb rather than dip them in it and piped in the tiramisu filling. I made two, one for a celebration we went to yesterday where I tried it for the first time. First bite I knew it was bad for me in the same kind of way I know my cheesecake is bad for me; where I know I won't be able to have self-control with it so I should only make it for special events.

The two kinds of cookies are because my husband likes the idea of chocolate chip cookies, but doesn't like the mouth feel of chocolate chips. He's high functioning. So I melt chocolate in a double boiler. Basically just a normal chocolate chip cookie recipe with the chocolate melted and drizzled into the dough while it's mixing for a couple seconds to create a marbling effect.

Fantasy Fudge was a new thing I tried to learn this year too. I am on the fence with it. I feel like I maybe messed up the process somewhere because they have to basically stay refrigerated to not sweat and stick to one another. And they are SO rich I feel like my teeth hurt and I'm going to have a sugar coma from a single bite. I might go back to the drawing board on it and see if I can find something that doesn't use sugar on top of butter on top of sugar on top of chocolate.",2,1766671037.0,Baking,2,1.0,False

1pvdw1g,https://i.redd.it/81v7wvkuvc9g1.jpeg,Fragrance World Coffee series review - decants,"As an coffee addict, I’ve always loved coffee in perfumes but they were never prominent enough for me to be worthy as a true coffee scent. So in my hunt to find a good coffee fragrance, I stumbled across the fragrance world coffee series

Thankfully @svk43 had all the decants for this so I decided to buy them all except for affogato since it’s cloning Amore Caffe by Mancera and I already have it’s dupe ie. Khadlaj Cafe Latte 

Here’s my first impressions for each of the perfumes ( haven’t tested their dry down’s or performance and longevity yet)

Starting off with 

**Caramel Macchiato - Caramel, sugar, slight coffee note** a very close dupe of Khamrah Qahwa

The slight difference is the coffee note is a bit sharper in caramel macchiato compared to khamrah qahwa. 

**Kopi Luwak** \- **Coffee and rose** but the rose note is mild, but it develops after a couple of minutes. 

Good unisex feminine leaning coffee scent.

**Irish Coffee** \- **Boozy and coffee notes**

Can smell heavy alcohol notes in the opening along with a hint of coffee

An elegant gentlemanly smell, this is like if angel share had a baby with a coffee bean it would smell like this lol

**Mocha - cocoa and coffee bean** along with a bit of underlying cardamom but not too overpowering. 

After a few minutes the cocoa overpowers the coffee note but it doesn’t turn into a chocolatey smell, the coffee note still persists.

**Double Espresso - Strong espresso smell**, you can smell the raw coffee bean’s loudness instantly. As the name suggests this perfume isn’t for the weak, it’s strong loud and only likeable by those who are addicted to coffee beans.

Last but not least but the one I was excited for the most : 

**Qahwa** \- strongest coffee note of them all along with a strong cardamom note, I didn’t know cardamom and coffee could get along so well until I smelled it.

This smells exactly like Arabic coffee (qahwa means coffee in Arabic, but it also refers to their traditional black coffee) it is a very photo realistic black arabic coffee with a touch bit of strong cardamom done to perfection. 

Since I’ve been brought up in Saudi, I could immediately recognise this scent and I loved it

If you like cardamom and coffee, this is a must blind buy. Absolutely sensational smell 

Do let me know if you’d like for me to try out their longevity in clothes/skin. I can make a detailed review if anyone’s further interested.

The Problem:
Every time I pull a shot, the seal seems to fail. About halfway through or towards the end of the extraction, there is a sudden ""explosion"" or pop where coffee/water sprays out from the top of the portafilter. Even after the pump is turned off, the coffee continues to leak/drip from the sides of the group head for several seconds.
My Workflow:
Machine: De'Longhi Dedica (bought second hand).
Portafilter: Bottomless aftermarket portafilter with a wooden handle.
Dose: 18g in / 36g out.
Grind: Setting 13 (on a 1-19 scale).
Prep: WDT, leveler, spring-assisted tamper, and a metal puck screen.
Taste: Tasted okay, but a bit thin.
What I’ve checked:
The previous owner replaced the ""sealing mechanism"" (gasket) recently and says he never had this issue.
I am using the exact same grinder and accessories he used.
I am locking the portafilter in as tight as possible, but the pressure still breaks the seal.
Because the Dedica doesn't have a 3-way solenoid, I expect some residual pressure, but this happens during the flow and makes a massive mess. Could this be a cheap/ill-fitting aftermarket portafilter, or is it possible the gasket was installed incorrectly?

The building where I work is home to several companies, and this year the owners decided to host a Christmas party for all the tenants. I’ve worked here for nearly ten years, and a few years back, a woman from a few floors above mine caught my attention. I wasn’t looking for anything, being married and settled, but her warm smile and graceful presence always brightened my mornings.

Over time, we developed a friendly rhythm in the lobby. I learned when she usually arrived and would time my mornings just right. Sometimes I’d surprise her with a cup of coffee. It was easy, comfortable, and unspoken. I never knew if she felt the same quiet pull I did, but that was okay. The friendship itself was enough.

Then came the building’s Christmas party.

As soon as I arrived, I scanned the room, half-hoping I’d see her. Our eyes met almost immediately, and I made my way over. We talked about work, the holidays, life, small things that somehow felt meaningful. As the room filled, the crowd gently nudged us toward a quiet corner.

At some point, without either of us really deciding it, my hand rested at her hip and hers found my shoulder. The conversation softened. The space between us felt charged and familiar all at once. I’m not sure who leaned in first, only that we shared a brief, tender kiss that lingered longer than either of us expected.

She pulled back with a shy smile, cheeks warm as she whispered an apology, explaining that she was married. I smiled softly and admitted that I was too. For a moment, neither of us spoke, until she suggested, almost hesitantly, that we might find somewhere a little more private to talk.

We made our way down to the parking garage and into the backseat of my car.  Our conversation continued find more and more connections as we talked, touched, teased all coming to a very happy ending.   Our conversation was far from over but people started filtering down from the party so we decided to call it a night. 

The next day when I saw her in the lobby I told her how much I enjoyed our conversation and she added that when she is heading out of town for the holidays, but when she gets back she would love to continue our conversation.

I’m new to Berlin and still in that wide-eyed explorer phase 😄 — discovering neighborhoods, cafés, parks, history, and everything that makes this city special.
Along the way, I’d love to meet new people to explore with. I’m also open to a long-term relationship with a kind, emotionally mature woman who values respect, honest communication, and shared experiences. I really enjoy traveling, exploring new cities and towns, spontaneous plans, and meaningful conversations.
If you’re someone who enjoys discovering places together and believes that feelings and mutual respect matter, we might get along well 🙂

i’m obsessed with her, i’ve been in toxic relationships before and she doesn’t seem that way. it’s been like a week and a half, and i swoon when i see her and there’s some sexual tension there on my side for sure. she has problems with touching, so when i put my hand on her back during the concert, she told me she has some issues so i backed off in a chill way, but then she went for the kiss at the end of the night and it was magical to me. 


just nervous cause she’s not highly initiative and can seem to be a little cold sometimes but she says she’s autistic and a little awkward, which i am too. i wanna see what happens, im just gushing a little bit, she’s so pretty and i just wanna hold her hand.

Wrapped in a red satin robe, unwrapped everywhere else, and slipping into a red string bikini brief because joy, desire, and confidence deserve to take up space too. This body—soft, full, indulgent—is not a problem to be fixed or hidden for the holidays. It’s a gift I’m finally letting myself enjoy... And YOU unwrap. 

This season can be heavy. Expectations. Family. Old wounds dressed up in tinsel. So this morning, I’m choosing pleasure, presence, and peace. I’m choosing to feel sexy in my own skin, to honor my mental health, and to remind myself that rest and self-love are not indulgences—they’re necessities.

Being sex-positive means letting yourself feel good without guilt. Being body-positive means knowing you don’t have to earn desire. And taking care of your mental health means giving yourself permission to slow down, breathe deep, and savor the moment—whether that’s coffee by the tree or satin against bare skin.

Here’s your reminder: you are allowed to take up space, feel desirable, and put yourself first this holiday season. 🎁❤️

* You manually add products to a shortlist (links/SKUs)
* The agent scans the web daily (or hourly)
* It alerts you only on **genuine heavy discounts** 

Likely users:

* Deal hunters who hate the tracking work
* Busy parents with recurring big buys
* Hobbyists (ski gear, sneakers, coffee gear, cameras) where drops are rare but meaningful

Quick questions:

1. Would you trust an agent to define a “real deal”? What proof would you need?
2. What threshold should trigger an alert (%, price floor, “lowest in X months”)?
3. Alerts: push, SMS, email - and how often before it becomes spam?

https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/s/fQ7VrjjFqI

I solved it with all your input and watching Vinicius video on YouTube : 

https://youtu.be/4yGinq5NaCA?si=Agri_74viytUKKzR

My problem on the small moka pot was the water chamber (lower pot). It had a lid which was higher than the lid of the funnel. The gasket never was able to seal this area tight enough because it never could reach the lid of the funnel. Vinicius solves it with an extra selfmade gasket on the side of the funnel. I chose a different way: I sanded down the lid of the water champer so that it sits nearly flush with the lid of the funnel. The gasket will now seal both perfectly. The effect was enormous: Steady flow, great taste and nearly all water reached the coffee chamber as coffee.

Again thank you all for your input and thanks to Vinicius for the video!

1pvdjoy,https://i.redd.it/30pbk41gsc9g1.jpeg,My small haul review!,"For starters,im a huge vanilla girl but like to switch it up from time to time with something light and floral with hints of vanilla/fruits in it.

(First time posting a review in english on here so bare with me)

Originally I ordered this with the VS Caramel Vanilla mist but it went out of stock while they were packing my order(got the refund the day after)

Bare vanilla shimmer lotion🤎🌠: This is my 2nd time buying this one since its my holy grail for layering my perfumes and mists,plus the golden shimmer is just chefs kiss, its so sensual,warm yet heavy on the vanilla side while it being not too sweet. It's the perfect base for almost anything gourmand smelling,plus it also layers well with Velvet Petals if u like to make it lighter yet still keeping it gourmand if that makes sense(?)

PINK Glazed Vanilla&Dream💭🍩:I expected a more gourmand smell from this mist but it's surprisingly light. This one is sweet,sugary and creamy,but somehow I don't like it as much as I expected,maybe I need to marinate it(idk if thats the right term for it) and spray it once in a while for the alcohol to evaporate so the scent comes to its right,idd definitely layer it with the bare vanilla mist so it smells more like vanilla.

Pistachio Crème💚🥧:This is one definitely smells like creamy pistachios that got sprayed with almond aroma. It's a very nice scent for anytime of the year in my opinion,its comforting yet clean smelling,it has something away from the Sol de Janeiro 62(my absolute favorite body mist) so pairing these 2 together definitely gives u that gourmand pistachio vanilla goodness(if u want that,otherwise,the VS body mist on its own is great if u want it to be lighter).

Gilded Vanilla💛💫: This is the more sensual and lighter yet chiquer version on the og bare vanilla mist imo.
Its more expensive smelling and the drydown is as if it came from a high end vanilla perfume which i adore. I'm glad I bought this one as it would pair with my YSL Libre Le parfum perfectly,from night outs to make outs 😉,its so sexy and pretty smelling!

PINK Warm&Cozy🧣🩷: I never expected to like this one as much as I do. This scent is the perfect blend of vanilla and coconut/passionfruit(as it says). It's so clean,comforting and sensual smelling. Amazing to wear after u get out of the shower,grab a warm cup of tea or coffee,wrap yourself in either a silk or woolen blanket and have a beauty moment for yourself. It's the scent you'd smell after your grandma washed your blankets,made a vanilla cake topped with shredded coconut and aired out the house with fresh spring air.

Fast forward to today, they know we haven’t got any other Christmas plans.

But 3 days later she asked about my morale. She know the break up hurted me like hell. I answered, asked about the problems she had and she explained she was going through though times.

I asked if she would be ok for a coffee, to talk about our lives. She said it’s not easy for her and declined

Later I asked if she was ok to talk about us. She said she has moved on and that I should too. I said I have not for now but ok, I will and I will respect her decision. I deleted her number and it was over in my head

5 days later she texted me to understand what I meant when I said I did not move on. I explained, she said I will be better without her. I answered and then : nothing.

I am a bit lost. Why did she asked me this kind of things when conversation were closed? She was the one who said « I don’t want us to talk anymore » when she leaved.

## *""Why the F Won't This Thing Go Together""*

### **Department of Applied Reality Engineering**
### UTETY University — Professor Pendleton ""Penny"" Riggs

---

Good morning. Welcome to the most universally attended lecture of the year.

You're sitting on the floor. There are instructions that may or may not be in your native language. There's a small Allen wrench that's already given you a blister. And Part C will not — *will not* — go into Slot D.

Let's talk about why.

---

## **I. THE FIVE REASONS IT WON'T GO TOGETHER**

### **1. You're not wrong. It doesn't fit.**

Manufacturing has tolerances. Sometimes Part C is 0.5mm too big. Sometimes Slot D is 0.5mm too small. Sometimes both, in the wrong direction.

*The fix:* Light sanding. A file. A rubber mallet with *gentle* persuasion. Or — if it's plastic — a hair dryer to soften it just enough.

### **2. There's a hidden step you skipped.**

The instructions showed eight parts. You see eight parts. But step 3 required you to *orient* Part B a specific way, and you didn't, and now Part C won't go in because Part B is backwards.

*The fix:* Back up. Look at the diagram. Find the part that's rotated wrong. Swallow your pride.

### **3. There's a part inside a part.**

Hardware is often *packed inside the thing it attaches to*. That bag of screws? Check inside the hollow leg. That missing dowel? Tucked inside the drawer you haven't opened.

*The fix:* Before you panic, search every cavity.

### **4. You're using the wrong screw.**

There are four screws that look identical. Three are 12mm. One is 14mm. You used the 14mm in step 2, and now step 7 won't work because you needed it there.

*The fix:* If a screw won't seat flush, stop. Compare it to the others. Check if you grabbed from the wrong pile earlier.

### **5. The instructions are just... wrong.**

It happens. Printing errors. Diagram doesn't match the actual product. Step 6 references a part that doesn't exist.

*The fix:* Look at the *thing*, not the paper. Ask: ""What is this trying to *be*?"" Sometimes you have to reverse-engineer the intent.

---

## **II. THE CHRISTMAS MORNING TOOLKIT**

If you don't have these within arm's reach, you're not prepared:

| Tool | Why |
|------|-----|
| Phillips and flathead screwdrivers | Obviously |
| Allen wrenches (metric AND standard) | Because they never tell you which |
| Rubber mallet | Persuasion without destruction |
| Flashlight | To see into the slot that won't accept the tab |
| Reading glasses (if applicable) | The screws are small. The print is smaller. |
| Spare batteries | Nothing works without them. They're never included. |
| Patience | Not included in any box. Must be supplied by user. |

---

## **III. THE MINDSET**

Here's the secret:

**Assembly is just reverse-disassembly.**

The thing *can* go together — it did once, at the factory, probably by a machine that didn't care about your feelings.

If it went together once, it can go together again.

Your job is to figure out what the machine knew that you don't. Yet.

---

## **IV. WHEN TO WALK AWAY**

If you've been at it for more than 20 minutes and you're getting angry:

Stop. Get coffee. Eat a cinnamon roll. Watch your kids play with the box the thing came in.

Come back in an hour. The problem will still be there, but you'll see it differently.

---

## **V. CLOSING THOUGHT**

The thing will go together. It's a mechanism. Mechanisms are honest. They don't refuse out of spite — they refuse because *something is true* that you haven't discovered yet.

As a solo founder, I **need something dead simple to manage business relationships** (coffee chats, intros, casual networking) without the bloat of full enterprise CRMs like HubSpot or Salesforce.

**Pain points I'm hitting:**

\- Forgetting key details from conversations (promises, next steps, personal context)

\- Missing the perfect follow-up window

\- Spending too much time drafting messages

Current options I've tried: Google Contacts + reminders (too basic), Notion databases (too manual), Folk/Clay (getting close but still feels heavy).

**Questions:**

1. What lightweight/personal CRM do you actually use for relationship nurturing & follow-ups?
2. Any tools that auto-summarize chats, suggest timing, or draft follow-ups?
3. If nothing fits perfectly, what features would make you switch?

Building my own minimal version right now — super interested in real pain points/feedback.

I keep having great coffee chats, quick intros, or Zoom calls where we say ""let's collab sometime"" — then life happens, I forget the details (promises, their interests, best time to ping), and the connection fades.

Right now my system is chaotic: scattered notes in Notion, calendar reminders that I ignore, sometimes just hoping they reach out first (spoiler: they rarely do).

Curious how others handle this:

* What tool/system do you use for post-conversation follow-ups? (CRM, simple reminders, spreadsheets, nothing?)
* What's your biggest pain: timing, drafting messages, keeping context, or just remembering to do it?
* Would a super lightweight tool (auto 30-sec summary + timing suggestions + ready follow-up drafts) actually move the needle for you, or is it overkill?

Honest answers welcome — even ""I don't care about networking"" is useful info 

I'm building something in this space myself (early beta stage), so feedback helps a ton.

Last week, she stayed back late with me to finish a deck and said, ""Guess we're office survivors now."" That was 5 days ago, and we haven't stopped talking since. Slack messages turned into WhatsApp texts, coffee breaks together, and elevator rides that feel way too short.

But then it got weird. She sent a message with my team's profile pic using *that* specific emoji. My friends went crazy in the group chat.

Then yesterday at lunch, a guy from another team walked by and asked, ""So, are you two always glued together?"" Before I could answer, she looked at him and said, **""Only during working hours.""** Then she looked at me and whispered: **""Overtime is invite only.""**

My brain malfunctioned. He just laughed awkwardly and left.

Later that evening, she texted me: *""I'm grabbing coffee outside. Coming?""* I said yes. We stood way too close. Her shoulder was brushing mine. The lights were dim. I told her, ""You know you make workdays way better."" She smiled and said, ""Good. I was hoping you'd notice.""

Then... silence. Eye contact. She leaned in and whispered, ""Don't make this weird."" And she kissed me. It was quick and soft. Then she pulled back, laughed, and said, **""Okay, now it's weird.""**

I walked home in a daze. Now the elevator rides are awkward. Do you think I should ask her out properly or wait?

1pvdc3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/macrodroid/comments/1pvdc3h/trouble_getting_macrodroid_to_talk_to_sheets/,Trouble getting Macrodroid to talk to Sheets.,"I've made an entire app basically in Macrodroid. It's a health/habit tracker. It has all of my health stuff I want to track (weight, different exercise counts, blood pressure, pulse, etc.) and all of my habits I want to track (number of cigarettes (trying to quit, leave me alone), coffee, if I took a shower, etc.). It's launched via a custom widget button, and it's a custom scene. It feels like a full app, it's just ugly for now. 

Everything works. The buttons, the variables, the reset button, the automatic reset at 23:59:59, etc. all works perfectly. It's also infinitely expandable if I find more things to track.

My problem currently is getting it to post to Sheets. I used ChatGPT for help here (there aren't any tutorials so I had to as a last resort) and it had me try many many things on both sides. Different app scripts on Sheets, different http request POST things. I can't figure it out and I'm getting disheartened about this. 

All I'm trying to do is get it to make a new row and add my variables in the right columns. Later I'll add the ability to overwrite a row if it already exists (if I test the macro the midnight post will put the actual numbers in), add a chart to Sheets that can be read and displayed by Macrodroid, add streaks and goals, and pretty it up. I'm just stuck at this hurdle. 

Can anyone help with this? It's getting really depressing.

I went to see my parents during christmas and my partner left to see hers. She was meant to come pick me up early in the next morning but she was so tired after the party at her familys that she barely had energy to text me and went to sleep without remembering to send me goodnight text and that already started to trigger me, like I'm not wanted home or that she doesn't miss me. 

(She did do her best to give me the best presents during christmas morning before we left, more than she ever gave anyone else. So I know logically she cares about me. Her love Language is gifting)

Now she also slept until 3pm and woke up to my nervous texts (mostly, I just said I miss her and hope she misses me too and that I hope she'll still want me home) so she called all groggy saying she's sorry she slept in, asked if I was feeling okay (I said yeah bcs my mom was next to me) and will drink a bit coffee and come get me immediately after.

Now I know, logically I know, she cares about me. She's just exhausted, between depression and work/christmas stress she's running thin and I don't want to cause her more worry than I already do. 

Her sister even sent a text asking if we were gonna come over today which means she must have talked about coming (with me) to see her sister after christmas. So I must be wanted right?

  
So how do I tell my borderline that there is way more logical explanation to why she didn't come to get me or text me than that I'm not welcomed or missed at home? How do I fight these unwanted feelings of fear of rejection? Anyone has any suggestion?",2,1766669001.0,BPD,1,1.0,False

As a solo founder building my own tool, I struggle a lot with this:

I have great coffee chats, quick intros, hallway talks or Zoom calls → super excited in the moment → then 3–7 days later I forget key details (promises, next steps, what they cared about).

Many connections cool off or die completely because I didn't follow up at the right time or with the right message.

Right now I use messy notes + calendar reminders + sometimes just memory (which fails hard).

Questions for other solopreneurs / early founders here:

* **How do you currently handle post-conversation follow-ups?** (spreadsheets, Notion, CRM, simple reminders, nothing?)
* **What's your biggest pain point with this?** (timing, drafting messages, remembering context, etc.)
* **Would a very lightweight tool that auto-summarizes chats in 30 seconds, suggests best follow-up timing, and drafts natural messages actually help you?** (No heavy enterprise CRM – just a smart sidekick.)

Honest answers (even ""I don't care about this at all"") super appreciated – trying to understand if this is a real pain or just my problem 

Thanks in advance!

(If it resonates and you want to see the early beta of what I'm building, feel free to DM – no hard sell.)

Am I overthinking this?","So, I think my office crush likes me back, but I might be delusional. Here is the timeline:

Last week, she stayed back late with me to finish a deck and said, ""Guess we're office survivors now."" That was 5 days ago, and we haven't stopped talking since. Slack messages turned into WhatsApp texts, coffee breaks together, and elevator rides that feel way too short.

But then it got weird. She sent a message with my team's profile pic using *that* specific emoji. My friends went crazy in the group chat.

Then yesterday at lunch, a guy from another team walked by and asked, ""So, are you two always glued together?"" Before I could answer, she looked at him and said, **""Only during working hours.""** Then she looked at me and whispered: **""Overtime is invite only.""**

My brain malfunctioned. He just laughed awkwardly and left.

Later that evening, she texted me: *""I'm grabbing coffee outside. Coming?""* I said yes. We stood way too close. Her shoulder was brushing mine. The lights were dim. I told her, ""You know you make workdays way better."" She smiled and said, ""Good. I was hoping you'd notice.""

Then... silence. Eye contact. She leaned in and whispered, ""Don't make this weird."" And she kissed me. It was quick and soft. Then she pulled back, laughed, and said, **""Okay, now it's weird.""**

I walked home in a daze. Now the elevator rides are awkward. Should I ask her out properly or wait?

They wanted to do the train last year, but couldn't get tickets, so they booked these tickets over a month ago. It's some sort of christmas themed steam train thing.

They're in Norfolk still!

'I don't know how long this ride takes, or what happens on board, its a big mystery' (aren't most things to gaby?)

They're running late again (why are they always running late I'd find that really stressful) 

'Wow. It's like Harry Potter' (is that her only cultural touch stone, she references it a lot) 

I can see even going on this, they made a prior trip to McDonalds for coffee. 

'Is there lights on the trees, or is all like, uplighting?'

'It's really like Harry Potter style, really olden world style' (does she know Harry Potter is actually set in the 1990s?)

Tim is making what he thinks is train noises, in an unusual display of emotion and enthusiasm for him. 

'It's just like the polar express isn't it' (How is it like the polar express Tim?)

As a side note, while I appreciate the idea, this looks like a pretty low effort low cost lights show. Maybe in Norfolk it's a lower barrier of quality. 

A lot of montages with royalty free music, presumably to try and stretch the video out as long as possible. 

'We've got a 20 minute interval, so we can go get some selfies with the train!'

'There are even people here in their pyjamas, so their really getting into the swing of things'

'It's so cute I do feel like I've stepped back in time, I feel like I'm in the 60s. No the 40s.'

'This train is really erm, elegant. Like stepping back in time. A real polar express experience (another Tim pearl of wisdom there) 

'Coming out on here has really made me wanna try like, the polar express train. The difference is this one looks really nice and illuminated on the outside, but theres no actors singing or serving hot chocolate' (have they actually watched the polar express?) 

'we could venture out of the area and get something like the polar express, but in Norfolk you have the anglican railway, or the steam railway, but you can't malgamate the two, not in this area' 

They complained about the lack of festive tunes on the train 

'on the way there, seeing all the lights was really new and exciting, but coming back it wasn't really' (travelling back the exact same way they came, for context)

Hi all, I'm currently brewing with an Aeropress Go with a Kingrinder K6. I was also recently gifted a Bratza Encore, but haven't used it much yet. The aeropress is pretty new to me, and I've really enjoyed it so far, but I am interested in dabbling into pour over coffee as well.

I'm traveling for the holidays and, in a rush to get to the airport, I left all my coffee stuff at home. Now, I have a couple options:

1. Use this as an excuse to buy new coffee stuff, or
2. Suck it up and drink Folgers from a Keurig for a week. 

I guess I'm looking for you to convince me to do option 1. Since I'm enjoying the K6, I don't necessarily want to replace it, but is there a grinder you'd suggest that's different enough I'd have a use for both? 
What pour over maker you would recommend that is portable/durable enough to throw in a carry on? My one complaint with the Aeropress Go is that it can only make one cup at a time, so something with a higher capacity would be also great.

Just started lexapro about 2 weeks ago. From the beginning I noticed low key background nausea/queasiness every day. My stools were liquid or mostly liquid and the volume was crazy, but I never really felt “sick” per se…  just symptoms like I was. 

Last night after having some rich and savory food all day (and admittedly some alcohol throughout the day) for Christmas Eve I actually got to the point where I vomited. Just once, but it was a lot. I felt way way better after. 

Got plenty of sleep last night. Woke up this morning feeling ok, but almost immediately after standing up felt like I was going to vomit (I did not) and ended up on the toilet for about 30 mins. Then I felt “fine” (low level queasiness still present). 

I am skipping my dose today, Christmas. (10mg). I have to work and I can’t be nauseated and feeling like I’m going to vomit all day. 

Anyone have any experience like this?  

This is really the first “regular interval/maintenance medication” I’ve ever taken, so I’m not used to dealing with side effects of anything.

I had just finished plating a three-course, organic, Michelin-star-quality dinner for my husband, Mark, who had been ""working late"" for months. I, of course, had spent my day volunteering at the local animal shelter and single-handedly saving my firm from a multi-million dollar lawsuit.
""We need to talk,"" Mark said. He didn’t look at me. He looked at his phone, a cold smile on his face that didn’t reach his eyes.
""Is something wrong, darling?"" I asked, my voice like silk. ""I’ve already folded your laundry by thread count and pre-ordered that vintage watch you wanted.""
""I’m leaving you,"" he blurted out. ""For Candi.""
Candi. I knew her. She was a high-school dropout who worked at a failing vape shop and spent her inheritance on neon hair extensions and ""rebellious"" face tattoos. She was objectively a poor choice, lacking my three PhDs and my habit of rescuing orphans in my spare time.
""She understands me,"" Mark insisted, packing a bag with the designer clothes I had bought him. ""You’re just too... perfect. It’s intimidating.""
Three weeks later, I was sitting in a high-end cafe when they walked in. Candi was wearing stained sweatpants and screeching into her phone about ""the haters."" Mark looked disheveled, his expensive suit wrinkled.
""Oh, look who it is,"" Candi sneered, approaching my table. ""The Ice Queen. Mark says you’re still obsessed with him. You need to give him the house and your entire savings account. It’s only fair for the emotional distress of being married to a robot.""
The entitlement was staggering. She actually reached out to grab my $10000 handbag. I calmly caught her wrist—using just enough pressure to be firm but staying perfectly composed.
""I think you should leave,"" I said softly.
""You'll regret this!"" Mark yelled, causing a scene. ""I'm taking everything in the divorce! My lawyer is a shark!""
Just as Mark began to lunge toward my table to snatch my car keys, the bell above the cafe door chimed. In walked a man in a bespoke suit—it was Bruce, the billionaire CEO of the world’s largest tech conglomerate, whom I had happened to save from a choking fit in a grocery store ten years ago. He had been looking for me ever since to repay the favor.
""Is there a problem here, Your Excellence?"" Bruce asked, bowing slightly to me.
""Bruce, how timely,"" I purred.
""I believe you dropped this,"" Bruce said, handing me a thick manila folder.
I slid the folder across the table. Mark opened it, his face turning a sickly shade of gray. Inside were high-resolution photos of his ""business trips"" (which were actually gambling benders), bank statements showing he had embezzled from his own company, and a signed confession from his ""shark"" lawyer, who—as it turns out—was actually my long-lost cousin who had been working as an undercover informant for me all along.
""Wait,"" Mark stammered. ""If you knew all this... why didn't you say anything?""
""Because,"" I said, standing up and smoothing my impeccable skirt, ""I wanted to see if you’d choose the vape shop girl over a woman who literally owns the patent for the air you breathe. You chose... poorly.""
At that exact moment, the police arrived (I had alerted them via a silent alarm in my ring) and handcuffed Mark for his financial crimes. Candi tried to run, but she tripped over her own platform crocs and was promptly arrested for an outstanding warrant regarding a stolen golf cart.
As they were dragged away, I felt a familiar presence beside me. It was the handsome judge from the high court, who happened to be dining at the next table.
""That was impressive,"" the judge said, handing me his business card. ""I’ve already finalized your divorce. It’s effective immediately. You get everything, including his future thoughts.""
I sighed, a single, perfect tear rolling down my cheek. ""I just want peace,"" I whispered.
""You deserve the world,"" Bruce and the Judge said in unison.
I walked out of the cafe, the sunset hitting my hair just right, knowing that I was, as always, the bigger person.
The next morning, my phone began to incessantly buzz. It was Mark's mother, Eleanor, my ex-mother-in-law, a woman who believed her every whim was a divine decree.
""How could you do this to my poor Mark?"" she shrieked, barely letting me get a word in. ""He's in jail! He needs you! You need to drop all the charges and give him all of your money so he can get a good lawyer and rebuild his life! It's your fault he's in this mess, you know, being so perfect and intimidating!""
I calmly muted the phone and continued sipping my ethically sourced, single-origin coffee. I glanced out the window of my penthouse apartment, which had been legally transferred to me by the judge. A rainbow arched over the city, a perfect metaphor for my life now that the toxicity was gone.
""And Candi!"" Eleanor continued, her voice now a strained whine. ""She's also in jail! You need to bail her out too! She's a sweet girl, just misunderstood! She needs a second chance, and you, with all your money, are obligated to provide it!""
I gently placed my phone on the counter, letting her rant into the void. A notification popped up on my tablet: ""Incoming call from the President of the United States."" I had, of course, been consulting on a major global crisis in my spare time. I tapped ""accept.""
""I heard you sorted out that little 'Mark' issue,"" the President's voice boomed. ""Excellent work. The world is a safer place without his bad poker habits. Now, about that peace treaty...""
I smiled, a genuine smile that reached my eyes this time. The world was indeed a vast, complex place, but some problems, it seemed, just solved themselves... with a little help from a perfect person.

The listing claims it’s a “business travel essential,” yet the price tag feels more like a luxury splurge than a practical buy. Let’s see if the numbers justify the hype.

First, the price. At $510.98, this keyboard costs more than most laptops. The listing leans on buzzwords like “tri-fold” and “full-size 105-key,” but the photos show a cramped layout that looks more like a travel-size compromise than a desktop replacement. The keys are 16.5 mm, which is generous, but the foldable design means you’re trading key travel for portability, and the listing is silent on whether the keys feel mushy or crisp.

The listing brags about “auto-sleep” and “150 days standby,” yet the battery life is left to the imagination. A Type-C port is mentioned, but no word on how long a charge lasts under real use. The same paragraph that claims “quiet keys” doesn’t specify whether the keyboard is backlit, a feature many buyers now expect even in budget gear.

The marketing copy is heavy on lifestyle promises and light on hard specs. It says the keyboard can pair with three devices at once, but the listing doesn’t explain how you switch between them without a mouse or trackpad. It also claims the keyboard is “compatible with everything,” but the listing doesn’t clarify whether it works with a desktop PC or just tablets and phones.

In short, the listing reads like a travel blog, not a spec sheet. If you need a keyboard for a coffee shop, you might be better served by a $30 Logitech K380. If you need a full-size deck for serious typing, a $50 mechanical keyboard will feel better and cost a tenth the price. The only scenario where this seems justifiable is if you absolutely must have a full-size keyboard that folds into a coat pocket, and you’re willing to pay a premium for the privilege. But even then, the price is so far above the category norm that you’d have to be in a very specific niche to justify it.

#Notable Injuries
 - Questionable: Mobley (CLE), Washington (DAL), Sengun (HOU), Finney-Smith (HOU), Tate (HOU), Luka (LAL), Hayes (LAL), Rui (LAL), McDaniels (MIN), 
 - OUT: 

--------------------------------------------------------------

#CLE @ NYK
 - Proj Starting 5: Garland, Mitchell, Mobley, Allen (Merrill or Tyson as 5th starter, if Mobley can't go it's Dean Wade)
  - Good matchup here for the guards for CLE. Garland has finally started to be more aggressive, hopefully that can continue for him although NYK like to funnel out and pack the paint. If his shot is falling that is great and I like the volume increase on him. I also think this is another big spot for Mitchell, stars love to play games @ the Garden and Mitchell loves it there. He could see some OG which would hurt a touch but he usually gets a lot of Bridges and has cooked his ass in the past. With the Knicks liking to funnel out to the 3 I think Merrill gets the nod as a starter and even if he doesn't he's okay here at 4k but he's chalky as shit. There is a chance here though that the chalk could be shaky as they run into defensive issues with Brunson and may have to play more Jaylon Tyson, Tyson would be okay here as a pivot off that ownership. Paint volume should be down so I'm not liking a minutes restricted Mobley off injury or Jarrett Allen who has played bad and loses peripheral opportunities with Mobley back and Robinson being an elite rebounder for the Knicks.
 - Proj Starting 5: Brunson, Hart, Bridges, OG, KAT
  - Expecting heavy minutes and volume for Brunson. They just don't have anyone that can stop him and you know he's going to have high volume/minutes after a couple days off. I would probably set a rule to play max 1 of Bridges/Hart/OG as I don't know if they get the volume to do much unless someone gets hot and i""m not all over any of them anyhow. I also like KAT, especially if there is no Mobley hounding him and I like this overall team matchup better without Mobley as well. He's such a difference maker on defense. KAT should be able to get you the double double bonus here. Robinson is a maybe, slate kinda small but he's a little expensive and it seems thin.

--------------------------------------------------------------

#SAS @ OKC
 - Proj Starting 5: Fox, Castle, Vassell, Barnes, Kornet (Wemby off bench capped at 24 minutes)
  - This is just an okay game to play from DFS purposes but more fun to watch. The Spurs have won the last two vs OKC accounting for half their losses this season. Fox hasn't had a great time here in the Dorture Chamber and I expect that to continue UNLESS they swap him out on Castle who has had more success even with Caruso on him some. Castle is a freaking menace, he's so damn good on both ends of the floor and is def in play today. Vassell is also fine here, nothing overweight he is pretty good on ball and probably draws the best matchup if there even is one as they've used SGA on him. I'm not too into Barnes, Kornett, or a minute restricted Wemby. Off chance at Keldon doing something but I wouldn't expect him to replicate 10/16 again. From a non-stat standpoint I personally don't think they win 3 in a row vs OKC and this could get ugly. I will be under on SAS some but they should project better than that. I don't bake (another cooking reference) takes into projections. 
 - Proj Starting 5: Shai, Dort, J Dub, Chet, Hartenstein
  - I will be going back to the well with a moderately owned SGA (currently around 15%). He just gets so much volume it's hard to pass on. On the other hand I think J Dub is super underowned here as he's been cold lately but he's prime to go off, Fox shouldn't be able to guard him and that's who they try to use. Wemby is minutes limited but he still plays roughly half the game which means Chet and Hartenstein have to deal with it. The media seems to be trying to cook up some Wemby/Chet rivalry but aside from being skinny they aren't on the same planet, I don't get it but whatever. There is always a shot at one of the rotational OKC guys doing well, I always like taking shots at Caruso and Cason Wallace is down to 4400. Wiggins, Joe, and Kenrich are the others. Dort could pay off his salary at 4500 as well but just gets no volume.

--------------------------------------------------------------

#DAL @ GSW
- Proj Starting 5: Nembhard, Flagg, Naji, PJ, AD
  - Cooper Flaggs first Christmas game and he's just going nuts and the field is ignoring him at 7300....sign me up, how is he 10% owned right now? AD on the other hand is the chalk at 9500 and GSW has no one that can deal with that monster. He's a bit expensive at 9500. I do like Nembhard here, I think Naji gets gassed trying to chase Steph around screens for 30 minutes or so and he's got more ownership than he should have around 16-17% atm. I'm currently projecting PJ as a starter but he could sit today and it's just okay for him. If he is indeed out then the start probably goes to Max Christie BUT Christie has been sick and could also miss. Klay also gets his old team again and is carrying ownership because of the revenge narrative to an extent but he's only 3900 which is cheap if he gets up any volume at all off the bench. May consider Brandon Williams or Gafford depending on injury situations.
 - Proj Starting 5: Steph, Moody, Jimmy, Draymond, Post
  - I don't know what to think here about the Dubs outside of Steph and Jimmy, they just really need a 3rd guy to get buckets. Maybe it's Moody, Kerr is pretty much done with Hield and Kuminga completely. I expect a full out, angry, motivated Draymond today which can backfire on both him and he's heavy, heavy chalk right now (it's 6am). Can you bet on tech fouls? I don't buy this ownership and if it holds at almost 40% I'll take my chances at him getting the old triple-single instead of triple-double and going under. That's an easy call from a game theory perspective.  Steph has no one to chase and guard him worth a shit today and should have a big game and if he doesn't it's going to be Jimmy, hell at Jimmy's price it could be the both of them. If PJ is out this helps Jimmy even more. Other than those three maybe you can look to Moody or Podz. I will have exposure to both, just don't love it.

--------------------------------------------------------------
#HOU @ LAL (lot of Q tags here, need to be available to swap)
- Proj Starting 5: Amen, Okogie, Durant, Jabari, Sengun 
  - If Amen stays out of foul trouble he's in the best spot. The Lakers really struggle with on ball defense to guards and Amen is lightning fast with the ball and Ayton is dogshit on defense inside. Speaking of.....there's this Sengun guy who should absolutely cook a thin LAL big rotation that could be missing Rui as well. Small chance Sengun misses so make sure you have flexibility to swap but damn, he's underowned as well. Thanks for gift wrapping that present! Jabari is okay here, Kevin Durant is solid but he has no one to guard him either. How are the Rockets so underowned??!! If you can't tell I will be overweight here to Houston. Reed Sheppard is the most owned player on the team off the bench at this early hour (I need to make more coffee).
 - Proj Starting 5: Luka, Reaves, Lebron, Rui, Ayton
  - We have no idea if Luka is going, if Rui is going, or if Hayes is going. The picture isn't very clear here. If Luka is in, it's tough for him with Amen hounding him on defense and if he's out a minute restricted Austin Reaves gets to deal with that. Given Luka's price and Reaves restriction I'm probably out on both (I will hedge a Luka lineup or two). LeBron had a good spot vs PHX and they got blown out so he cost me money in a great spot and was underowned the other night, if Luka is out I will go right back to it. LeBron loves Christmas games as much as anyone. I will have some Ayton but he's just been a dumpster fire this year. There is an avenue for him to do something and maybe win you a contest but seems a touch thin. This team is almost unowned in general but things could shift a lot here with injury news. I would leave myself some lineup flexibility for this game, most of the field will be drunk or napping and you can shift to or from this game to the next one.

--------------------------------------------------------------
#MIN @ DEN
- Proj Starting 5: DDV, Ant, Jaden, Randle, Gobert
  - Antman is a dog and the Nuggets really miss Aaron Gordon and to a lesser extent Braum on defense and just don't have an answer for him, no one does if he gets it going but damn is this a good matchup. Conley is solid here and is practically unowned right now even off the bench and could get the starting nod if McDaniels can't go. McDaniels should be okay here, DDV if he's out is a solid play at 6500 on DK. Gobert is the highest owned of the MIN players but it's low teens atm and he should have to play a little bit more. Julius Randle is okay, he's a lot freaking better and could destroy the slate if the Nuggets start Nnaji. Naz is just okay here, he's been getting more minutes lately but a 6th guy at 6800 is just too much. I don't know if he gets the minutes bump as Jokic will just destroy him. Not onto any of the other backups either from MIN. 
 - Proj Starting 5: Murray, Spencer Jones, Watson, ???, Jokic (I'm kinda split here on if it's THJ or Nnaji as 5th man, doesn't matter a ton as both will play a lot)
  - I guess everyone knows Jokic is good at basketball by now, maybe some Philly fans are still holding on to hope that Embiid is better (LOL). I like Murray more here if McDaniels is out, less if he's in but if out it's better even with Ant on him. I'm not saying either are a good matchup but he's okay here nothing I'd steam. Peyton Watson is in a great spot at only 5k, he's super chalky and so is Tim Hardaway Jr., some intern made a pricing error and if he starts he's a free square at 4k after outputs of 30 his last two games and still getting over 20 often enough over the last 15 games that this makes zero sense. Spencer Jones, Nnaji are just okay, if Bruce Brown's ownership holds at 30% that's probably poor chalk but they could need him, in lotto's that's an easier call to go under or fade. JoVal is fine here as the backup 5 and is too cheap at 3400.

User feedback:
- way less AI than I've been seeing on other big blasts.
- the author tags have improved, it was much easier to scroll and scan and see what the relationship was for each book. Thankful that some MF authors tag their books MF, super helpful.
- Great selection of gooks including quite a few from 2025. 

Two negative notes:
- stop labeling books CLEAN. 
- ""Like Harry Potter for ladies who like their books spicy!"" Eww! Honestly, it's 2026, there's no one alive who doesn't know what JKR is all about. Hard pass on any author using that promote their book. 


**I'll finish adding tags for the achillean books, and complete the sapphic & LGBTQIA+ lists later today!** (I know it looks messy, I'm going to come back and fix it. 😭)

1pvcmbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Plenty_Mode9773/comments/1pvcmbt/why_be_positive_might_be_making_you_feel_worse/,Why “Be Positive” Might Be Making You Feel Worse,"# And What to Do Instead for a Healthier, Happier Outlook

We’ve all heard the advice: *“Just be positive!”*  
It’s everywhere—from Instagram captions to coffee mugs to unsolicited comments when you’re visibly stressed out at work. But here’s the truth: **constant positivity isn’t always helpful.** In fact, trying to force a smile when life’s a mess can leave you feeling more drained—not less.

Welcome to the age of *toxic positivity*—the idea that you must always look on the bright side, no matter what’s actually going on. While it’s well-intentioned, it often does more harm than good by invalidating real emotions and turning struggle into something shameful.

If you've ever felt guilty for feeling bad, you're not broken—you’re human. And there's a better way to feel good again.

# You Don’t Need to Be Happy All the Time

Here’s the big shift:  
**You don’t need to chase constant joy. You just need to stop fighting reality.**

Life is messy. Stressful. Sometimes even absurd. And that’s normal. The goal isn’t to deny your difficult emotions—it’s to acknowledge them, learn from them, and lighten their load with humor, perspective, and small shifts in how you respond.

Real happiness doesn’t come from pretending. It comes from honesty, resilience, and learning how to find calm in the chaos—not escape from it.

# The Power of Tiny Shifts (a.k.a. You Don’t Need a Personality Overhaul)

Despite what New Year’s resolutions might suggest, **you don’t have to become a whole new person overnight.** In fact, research shows that trying to make massive emotional shifts all at once rarely works.

Why? Because our brains don’t flip like a switch—they rewire slowly, through repetition. It’s called *neuroplasticity*. Every time you choose a more helpful response to a stressful situation—even a tiny one—you strengthen your brain’s “calm muscle.”

Think:

* Pausing to laugh at something instead of spiraling.
* Reframing a bad day as “a weird chapter” instead of a disaster.
* Noticing the thought that says “I can’t handle this” and answering with “Maybe I can—just not all at once.”

These tiny moves might seem small, but over time, they change everything.

# Choose Real Over Perfect

The healthiest people aren’t those who are always cheerful—they’re the ones who are **emotionally honest** and know how to *bounce back*.

They feel their feelings.  
They allow bad days.  
And they’ve learned how to *laugh without checking if it’s the “right time.”*

One of the most underrated emotional skills? **Being okay with imperfection.** That includes yours *and* everyone else’s.

# Positivity Doesn’t Mean Pressure

Let’s be clear: positivity itself isn’t bad. But when it becomes a demand—something you *must* maintain at all times—it becomes a weight.

Real positivity is flexible. It leaves space for off days, weird moods, awkward situations, and thoughts that don’t fit in a motivational meme. It allows you to feel what you feel, without getting stuck there.

So if you’re tired of fake smiles and toxic pep talks, here’s your permission slip:

You’re allowed to be a work-in-progress.  
You’re allowed to laugh before you have it all figured out.  
And you’re allowed to feel better—without pretending you always do.

# Want a Simple Way to Shift Your Mindset This Year?

If you’d like daily encouragement that’s light, real, and even funny when it needs to be, check out *Happiness Guaranteed (or Your Misery Back)*. It’s a book of 365 short reflections—one for each day—designed to help you stay sane, steady, and a little more joyful through the ups and downs of real life.

No pressure. No fluff. Just a page a day that makes it easier to be human.

1pvcm42,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1pvcm42/to_the_girl_who_received_a_daisy_jibbitz_from_a/,To the girl who received a Daisy Jibbitz from a stranger,"I’m writing this from a coffee shop, reminiscing about a fleeting encounter I had during my trip to Singapore last Christmas.

It was start of January 2025, and I was heading back home after a short stay in Singapore. I had just walked into the Jewel at Changi Airport, 6 hours away from my flight. I came early since it's my first time there. As I entered the main area near the massive fountain, that’s when I saw her: a beautiful Asian woman, probably in her early 20s, taking photos for strangers. I don’t know exactly what it was, but something about her presence, her smile and the way she patiently helped everyone just made me feel so warm inside

I lingered around the area and I couldn't take my eyes off her. Eventually with the crowd, I lost sight of her.   
  
I wandered around the airport for a bit, but I couldn't get her out of my head. But I've already made up my mind that she's probably in a flight going to wherever she was heading. 

But then, randomly, 2 hours later, I spotted her again near a Crocs store. She was waiting there alone, It seemed like she was waiting for someone. 

At that moment, I realized this is my chance, I had to do something. I don't remember my exact thought process at the time, only the overwhelming urge to find a flower for this woman. I was looking at the immediate area and even the maps for any nearby shops that sell flowers, but came up empty.

As the frustration was settling in, suddenly, as I was looking at the jibbitz collection in the crocs store, I realized If there are no real flowers, why not improvise? why not give her crocs jibbitz that looks like a flower? So, I walked in and bought a Daisy Jibbitz. It was silly, but it actually felt right, maybe even better than the real thing.   
  
With the new found relief, I gathered every ounce of courage I had and approached her.

I said, ""Excuse me...""

""I saw you back there taking pictures of all those people. You were being really nice to them.""

I held out the little jibbitz and said ""So, I got you this.""

She looked at it and got completely flustered. She smiled and said thank you and that she never had a jibbitz before. 

We both started laughing nervously.  And then, my brain just short-circuited. I was stunned that it actually worked, and I got so nervous I didn't know what I had to do next.

I blurted out nervously, ""You were being really nice there, so I thought I’d get you this.""

And then... I just smiled and walked away.

I didn't ask for her name. I didn't ask for her socials. I just handed her a ""flower"" and fled the scene. I couldn't believe what had unfolded. I looked back shortly after, and her friend had already returned, and they went their separate ways shortly after.   
  
I was secretly, hoping that our paths would cross again, to actually finish the conversation and tell her how I really think of her, that she was beautiful and that I would've love to get to know better. But unsurprisingly, I never saw her again. I vividly remember the hours that followed, walking through the airport with a sense of loss that felt bittersweet. I’ve never felt such a mix of pride and regret. I successfully shot my shot with the gift, but I missed the basket by walking away.   
  
Somewhere in Singapore (or wherever she flew to), there is a girl with a Daisy Crocs jibbitz who has no idea who I am.

I’m glad I went with the Jibbitz in the end. Unlike a real flower, that little daisy will last a lifetime.",2,1766666493.0,CasualConversation,1,1.0,False

I’m house sitting for a colleague, and the coffee grinder stopped working this morning. I’m ready to collapse and cry, but still hoping I can fix this.

I started using lighter roast beans today, which I think the machine struggled with as they are obviously more oily etc… It basically slowly stopped working, and now only makes a low humming noise when I try to switch it on and grind.

I have cleaned the machine and found a huge amount of backed up coffee, in the chute, between the burrs and everywhere. But once I’ve put it back together it’s still not working.

Any advice would be so greatly appreciated",0,1766666076.0,espresso,9,0.17,False

Steel vs Aluminium,"I’ve been drinking instant coffee for a long time, and now I’m thinking about buying a moka pot. First, let me share my preferences: I like coffee with milk, and I usually need only one to two cups at a time.

I’ve come across two types of moka pots:
Steel: Pigeon 2-cup moka pot and Budan 2-cup moka pot 
Aluminium: Azaro moka pot and Pedrini moka pot

Which one would you suggest for making two cups of coffee that is easy to use and long-lasting?

I’m planning to buy BT Silver Oak coffee with a moka-pot grind size, as I’m also planning to buy a grinder. Is this a good choice, or should I try sample packs from BT — Attikan Estate, Silver Oak, and Dhak Blend? Also, should I buy Aeropress paper filters from Blue Tokai?

I’m feeling confused after reading so many pros and cons about moka pots. I’m a beginner at this and just want to upgrade my coffee to a café-style experience. I’m also planning to buy a French press in the future.

Please suggest!

1pvcgpk,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1pvcgpk/concentrated_french_press_brew_anyone/,Concentrated French Press Brew Anyone??,"So, from time to time I like to have this version of of French Press Brew which is more concentrated than regular recipes. It gives kind of a nice thick feel on your tongue. I developed this on my kitchen grinder days. Used to mix water or milk if it tasted too bitter.

Now that I have a grinder, I decided to give it a go and try to dial it into a full scale recipe.

18 Grams of Coffee, ground to Pour Over Grind. (17 clicks in Timemore C2S)  
150-200 grams of water. I vary the amount depending on my mood.  
Leave it for 5-6 minutes. And done. 

I brew in a mug and filter it through filter paper as I prefer a cleaner cup. If you are using a French press itself, use coarser grinds and longer brew time. I have tried that too. Brew time I keep 10 minutes in that case. 

I used light roasts and medium roasts so far. Not sure if it would be good with darker beans.

P.S. I have observed that this brew tastes best when consumed hot to warm. You can't let the temperature drop too much in this case. Also it leaves a nice sensation all throughout which is different than normal pour over or french press recipes. ",1,1766665931.0,IndiaCoffee,1,1.0,False

1pvcf79,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1pvcf79/rf_deathbed/,[RF] DEATHBED," It’s Friday again. The long, narrow and liminal alley in front of my apartment filled with school going children running and shouting at each other made me realize that another week had passed. This marked the second month since I had been to college. My parents don’t know about it since I live alone. But I wished that they had. I wished that only one of them would visit this godforsaken place and drag me out of here. But wishful thinking it was.

It’s midnight now. The street lights are lit and the streets are covered with thick cold mist. I opened the gate slowly as I did not want to make much noise in the middle of the night. The landlord is a good old man but is a bit stingy when it comes to discipline. And he doesn’t like it when I go out at night. He was a very tall man, pale and skinny. He had an abnormal number of moles in his face which he didn’t like other people pointing out. He wore thick glasses. He lived alone. His wife died a couple of years back and his only son was working abroad. You could tell that he felt lonely at times. His face would show a subtle darker complexion whenever he used to talk about his son or his deceased wife. Tomorrow he’s going to the cemetery. Every Saturday morning he visits his wife in an ironed pink shirt that contradicts the tone on his face when he visits and a beige colored pants with brown shoes. I once told him that this was a very unique or kind of ambiguous combination. “They both laughed for an hour when I wore this on his birthday” he said, diverting his eyes off of me.

There was no sign of the cold mist diluting. So there I roam in the streets of the city which I loathe so much. I never liked any city for that matter. In every life, I would always choose the country mouse rather than the city mouse. “That’s just stupid” that's what my friends said when I told them. But that was years ago. They’ve probably forgotten me by now.

A couple of people are coming towards me. Maybe three or four boys. They are loud. They sound drunk. I walk on the other side of the road. I have a habit of pretending to chew something or doing something with my tongue whenever I am among people. But they couldn't see me, for even I couldn't see them in this heavy mist and the darkness.

It’s 3 AM now. Too late or too early to do anything. I am in the middle of the woods surrounded by nothing but large trees and cold air. My periphery engulfed by this eerie darkness while my ears freeze in the cold. I had packed coffee in my little white thermos. It seemed like a perfect place to drink it. Oh and I also had a cigarette with me. I bought it yesterday. The shopkeeper gave me a look from top to bottom when I asked her for a cigarette. But I had no lighter or matches to light it. So I sat there on a stone drinking my coffee and pretending to smoke the moist cigarette.

The mist is starting to spread around. It was getting slightly brighter. My night had ended. I thought about taking a different route on the way back to my apartment. I must’ve walked for 45 minutes when I reached the cemetery. It was the same cemetery in which the landlord's wife was buried. I had partially hoped to bump into him there but it was empty. “ Anny Smith” “Wife, Mother , Writer”. It was written on the plaque. I didn’t know she was a writer. He never told me. I stare at my wrist at the numerous cuts of blade each of different sizes.

The smaller ones are the ones which I cut at the beginning. I was scared, scared of getting hurt, scared of being forgotten, scared of not being found. And as time passed, the cuts grew both in number and size. Nietzsche said""if you stare at the abyss the abyss stares back"". I wonder if death is looking right at me as I look into these cuts hoping to find my end with each attempt. I wished that someone would see these cuts of mine and take me away from this hellhole of a world. Ah yes, of course these wishful thinking never left me. Maybe the only salvation I'm ever going to get is this wishful thinking. I hear someone walking behind me. It was the landlord. In the same outfit as every Saturday morning. “Damnation” I thought. I had picked it up from Dostoevsky's books.

I thought that I would see the same complexion as every time he came here in this cemetery but it was different this time. His eyes showed something different. He looked like a man who had just found the meaning of his life. His eyes were full of virtue and calmness. We say nothing to each other and go on my way.

It was 2 PM. I just woke up due to the commotion near my apartment. A lot of people were talking and there was an atmosphere of commotion. Someone knocked at my door then. I thought it was the landlord. When I opened the door, it was the neighbor. “Do you know that uncle Sam committed suicide” he said. Sam was my landlord's name. “ Where?” I asked instinctively. “In the woods” he said. I told him I would come down in a couple of minutes but I didn’t go.

“Is that why his eyes were so contemptuous?” I thought. Maybe tomorrow I won’t forget the lighter.",1,1766665786.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I (23F) met this girl (27F) , through volunteering. We’ve seen each other about 6 times, always in group settings. She’s very affectionate in person: long tight hugs, hands on my shoulders, lots of smiling, once or twice a wink/squinty smile only with me. She also said she’d like to invite me to her place for a coffee sometime.
But over text she’s inconsistent: sometimes warm, sometimes she views messages and doesn’t reply (even to holiday wishes). She doesn’t really initiate or ask much about me.
Neither of us has clearly said we’re queer, so there’s some ambiguity.(I'm pretty sure she's queer)
I’m trying to understand: does this sound like normal friendly behavior, or possible interest mixed with uncertainty? Or am I just projecting?

I spent Christmas with cousins who got married young and now have kids in elementary school. One runs a small coffee shop on the side, her husband runs a larger business, and she fits in Pilates after the school drop off. Their life looks steady, balanced, and built with intention.

It made me reflect on my own path.

I am 31 (F) and just finished my PhD. Career wise, I am in a very strong place and genuinely proud of how I got here. I built my own financial stability and spent years focused on growth and learning. It was not always easy, but it was purposeful.

I am also in a healthy relationship, which I value deeply. We have not talked much yet about marriage or kids, and while that uncertainty exists, it did not feel heavy this time. It simply feels like something I need to be clearer about moving forward.

Being around my cousins did not make me feel behind or envious. It reminded me of something I have always known. I want marriage. I want kids. I want a life that feels both meaningful and well rounded.

I have always wanted that life. My timing is just different.

Ending the year with that clarity feels grounding. Different seasons call for different priorities, and I trust that this one has prepared me well for what comes next.

Like last week I was waiting for my coffee and this guy behind me kept asking personal questions, where I work, do I live nearby, am I “always this quiet”. I did the usual smile, short answers, hoping he’d get bored, and the barista even gave me a look like, you ok.

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush.

Like most people, I’ve tried every budgeting app out there, and I always ended up back at Google Sheets because I wanted control. But I hated how manual and ""boring"" standard spreadsheets were.

So, I built the **Wealth App**.

I’ve been testing and breaking this script for a long time to make sure it’s actually ""smart."" Here’s what it does differently:

* **Automated Month-End:** You don’t have to do any math at the end of the month. One click archives your data and rolls your balances over to the next month automatically.
* **Visual Themes:** It has a built-in theme engine. You can pick presets like ""Matcha Latte"" or ""Obsidian,"" or use the custom color picker to make it look exactly how you want.
* **Real-Time Charts:** Your ""Real Balance"" and ""Budget Check-in"" charts update the second you log a transaction.
* **Dream Goal Tracker:** There’s a dedicated spot to track big purchases (like a laptop or travel) so you can actually see your progress toward your goals.

**The Best Part:** This is a **one-time purchase of ₱700**. There are no subscriptions, no ""premium"" upgrades, and no hidden fees. Once you have it, you own it forever. It’s the only tool you’ll need to track your money for 2025 and beyond.

I’ve even included a ""Welcome"" tutorial tab inside the sheet to get you set up in less than 5 minutes.

**How to get it:** Just shoot me a DM if you're interested! I’ll send you the payment details and get the Access Guide over to you immediately.
