1ob909t,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ob909t,Just noticed something about amo's age,"We know that the manga or maybe amo herself keeps her age a secret, but what if amo actually does not know when is her birthday or the date she was born? Wait, wait, before you all nag me because the bonus page shows that her birthday is december 4th, there are many instances where the info that the mangaka and the audiences know can be unnoticed by the in-universe characters.

Think about it, it makes sense for her character because I think both of her mom and the mister are people who can't be more careless about things like her birthday. It is obvious she was raised in an extreme poverty because if not, why would her mother sold her? Maybe they were very poor that they can only do so much to survive and I don't think they can even think about celebrating her birthday in this kind of circumstance. Then there is the mister who treated her like a doll and doll doesn't need a birthday.

Maybe it is just my mental gymnastic and kei just wants to keep it a secret because of her backstory, but I think it will be cool and funny if there is a chapter or two about amo discovering her birthday and how old she actually is. Imagine they have a conversation like this:

Amo: Amo's birthday is... wait when it is again?

Everyone: How tf are we supposed to know? Wtf?

Maybe it can even be used to develop her character, like finding a missing piece of herself and finally help her to reveal the true form of her shoes.",1,1760929589.0,gachiakuta,1,1.0,False

1ob8ztg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ob8ztg,Blackjack Flash - A polished Blackjack game built natively for Apple Watch,"**Context**

Like many of you, I'm an Apple Watch enthusiast. I‚Äôve owned an Apple Watch since 2018, and I‚Äôve always felt that most apps and games on watchOS were‚Ä¶ well, afterthoughts. Either companion apps or stripped-down demos.

As a Software Engineering student, I wanted to put my skills to use and build something actually designed for the Watch ‚Äî quick, satisfying, and designed for the small screen.

That‚Äôs when I conceptualized¬†**Blackjack Flash**.

**Why Blackjack?**

A hand lasts only 5‚Äì20 seconds ‚Äî which I believe is perfect for the wrist. No one sits down to ‚Äúgame for hours‚Äù on an Apple Watch, but a short hand of blackjack? That works.

When I checked the App Store, most watch Blackjack games were either bland or paywalled right away. So I spent the last 3 months building a high-quality,¬†**watch-first**¬†blackjack experience.

**‚ÄúWhy would I play Blackjack on a watch, or better yet, why would I spend 1$ on Premium instead of my coffee?‚Äù**

* Quality animations optimized for the watch display
* Over¬†**70 unlockable cosmetics**¬†‚Äî card faces, card backs, table themes, and win animations
* **Haptic feedback**¬†that feels great on each deal
* A¬†**clean, intuitive UI**¬†that doesn‚Äôt feel cramped
* 60+ Achievements to unlock alongside their coin rewards
* Progression/Statistics systems

**Betting...**

Now before you throw tomatoes at me, let me briefly explain why there is no simulated betting system. I did in fact build an entire betting system with chips, a bankroll, and related unlocks... only to have Apple reject it because simulated gambling isn't allowed for individual developer accounts.

I had to scrap arguably my proudest feature. However, I did make up for it with coin rewards when you do win, giving a new meaningful winning satisfaction.

**Free vs Premium**

**Free Version (v1.1)**

* Play up to¬†**20 hands per day**¬†(resets daily) -NOTE: As of writing, v1.1 is in App Review and should be released within 48hrs. Previous version 1.0.2 had a limit of 10 hands per day
* Access a limited shop and a few cosmetics
* Earn coins through gameplay

**Premium ($0.99)**

* **Unlimited hands**¬†‚Äî play as much as you want
* Full access to achievement and progression/statistics systems
* Complete shop access with all 70+ cosmetics
* Earn coins through gameplay

**Monetization**

As you can expect, developing apps for the Apple Watch is extremely tedious and time consuming. I'm on a mission to keep developing quality apps for the Apple Watch, but I can't do it for free and needed to implement monetization somewhere.

I hate paid apps that don't offer a way to try the app before making a purchase, that's why I made the app free with in-app purchases. This allows users to try it first ‚Äî then decide. I did my best to provide a great experience for free users, and I figured the 0.99$ Premium price tag is very accessible for everyone.

**Looking for Feedback**

As this is my first app,¬†I'd genuinely love your honest feedback! You can find my app here:¬†[https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/blackjack-flash/id6748754932](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/blackjack-flash/id6748754932)

1ob8wvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ob8wvj/im_new_to_this_so_im_trying_to_figure_out_the/,"I‚Äôm new to this so I‚Äôm trying to figure out the formatting. But I need clarity on an ex and past relationship. This is very long, I‚Äôm sorry. I just really have no one to go to to spill ALL of this 2.5 year story in its entirety.","To preface: This was my first relationship. I‚Äôm very picky and anxious when it comes to dating. We are on opposite sides of the political scale, we both were aware of this both times getting involved with each other. We met on tinder. He‚Äôs a Jewish (kinda not really even religious) white man, I‚Äôm a Christian biracial black and white woman. He claimed how ‚Äúwow, you‚Äôre more religious than me‚Äù and I am not a bible thumper. I was raised to give everything and all my blessings to God and have faith. Yeah go ahead and laugh it up how we‚Äôre dumb and the circumstances would lead to this, I already know, don‚Äôt need the hate. I already hate myself at times when I would allow things to happen. Not really allow, I would confront. More so allow him to continuously disrespect because he didn‚Äôt care to change in aspects and ignorance for me and I didn‚Äôt leave. 

I guess I‚Äôll start from the beginning. Ex (m,21) and I (f,21) met in 2021 on tinder. We were hooking up and had a thing, he ended things about 5 months in because he could tell I was catching feelings and he wasn‚Äôt ready for anything having just got out of a 4 year on/of relationship w/ toxic ex. I blocked him on Snapchat b/c that was the only communication method we used. I was very sad but moved on (in a way). I knew he was coming back and there was more to us, but I continued to grow and do my thing. Trying to date around with other guys. Come august 2023 after my 24th birthday, he followed me on ig. Which confused me because I only told him my full name once the first time we met and somehow he remembered. We reconnected. Took it slow, and began dating later that year. Unfortunately he never officially asked me to be his gf but his family just automatically called me his gf so I knew I was in. He asked if it bothered me he didn‚Äôt ask and me being an idiot and trying to be the ‚Äúcool girl‚Äù I said ‚Äúno not at all‚Äù. Things were honestly beautiful and we loved each other very intensely and passionately. In mid April of 2024, I slipped up and told him I loved him. I did, but I personally wasn‚Äôt ready to say it yet and wanted him to tell me first. I dropped him off coming back from a friends bday in Denver and it just came out effortlessly. I freaked out and he was like ‚Äúwhat?! What happened?!‚Äù And I said that ‚ÄúI said something very serious and I really didn‚Äôt mean to yet.‚Äù He kissed me and we eventually talked about it. He told me he‚Äôs just not there yet but feels like he almost is. In September (I know a stupid long time) I confront him about the whole love thing and he was very willing to discuss it. No weirdness at all. 

We were in my room, my head on his chest and he admits that he does love me more than anything. But the reason he has been hesitant to tell me is because he wanted to be fully honest before committing to me in that way. He apparently had sex with another girl a couple months after we started seeing each other again. I of course lost my mind and didn‚Äôt know what to do. I was very tempted to kick him out. He asked if I feel like he cheated on me and I said ‚Äúyeah kinda‚Äù, because we weren‚Äôt official yet. But I thought him going through all of this effort to get me back meant he was going to do everything in his power to not fuck it up and be loyal to me. He told me ‚Äúhe didn‚Äôt know what he did in God‚Äôs eyes to deserve me.‚Äù I told him I need lots of reassurance, he proved to me there‚Äôs been no contact with her. And I believe it, even with everything that has happened I truly believe he had been loyal to only me the rest of the relationship. I was around often and he always worked long days so he literally couldn‚Äôt be anywhere else. But he always told me how I‚Äôm his best friend and the best girlfriend he‚Äôs ever had, which I believe. We enjoyed our independence and it made us closer and love each other more. Never nagged about his video games cause I love watching him play. I enjoyed cooking for him, helping where I could, and he definitely spoiled me. So not many problems tbh.

After that blip we honestly were fantastic. Some issues with his family regarding religion. But that was settled, his family loved me. Most of them still do and even keep in touch today. We Never fought, only issues was that i didn‚Äôt like him using any disability, sexuality, or racial slurs. Because why would I be okay with that? He was doing good for a while. Then had a massive slip up on the phone because someone cut him off. For some reason thought I didn‚Äôt hear him? I got silent and when he asked what was wrong I repeated what he said very angrily. He always apologized but then would add that ‚Äúthey‚Äôre just words. I never got mad when people would use antisemitic words or things at me growing up?‚Äù Because I‚Äôve been called very racist things by people and by my own father to scare me into how the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù is (my father is black my mother is white). I‚Äôve heard the term n***** b**** quite enough times to be desensitized but why would I be okay with it and let slurs or some jokes slide? For any race or person? That was our main issue, he never called me those words but me even explaining that clearly never got to him in the way it should‚Äôve. He also just wasn‚Äôt quite a man yet in my eyes. Granted I‚Äôm a woman, but all I‚Äôve ever known is my dad, grandpa, or uncle to drop whatever they are doing to help handle business and to fix problems. Whether it be for cars, hardware things. And whenever I asked him or if he didn‚Äôt notice something I would wonder why. At one point I said that I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just spoiled or what, but that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm used to from a man. His response was that he ‚Äúis just not there yet.‚Äù Yes he worked hard and made money, was financially literate. But wasn‚Äôt ready to help and be a man in other ways it seemed like. 

Let‚Äôs go back to 2024. I was finishing my masters program, ex best friend of 17 years got pregnant and asked me to be the godmom, he and I were very happy and our families loved each of us. We spent almost every Sunday with his family for family dinner. Things started to become off with said friend and we became distant. I was dealing with the beginning of my parents divorce that started October 2023. Things were hard but I had him and he was there for me. Valentine‚Äôs Day was very sweet and he surprised me with much more than I was anticipating since he‚Äôs not into holidays and birthdays. So I was very impressed and felt the love. He did unfortunately not remembering my graduation day. He as pretty anti higher education and thought it was dumb. I was raised that I was never getting out of school. Which I decided to stop at my masters, not making my dad happy but I don‚Äôt care. I had to ask him if he remembered that I‚Äôm graduating with a masters degree today and he was apologetic. Still hurt but it‚Äôs the little things over time that really hurt my heart. I started a new job after getting a promotion at the retail store I worked at into a corporate level. I unfortunately was let go before the training period was done because I was not picking up excel quick enough. I was told I‚Äôd have two more weeks to learn it and they let me go five days after saying that. I was devastated and it really kicked my depression off for the next year plus. 

Over the summer, he asked my friend if there was any way we could meet up. This was the pregnant friend that lived in Denver like I mentioned a while ago. She brushed it off and said ‚Äúsee if the friends up north could handle it.‚Äù He was confused and shocked but didn‚Äôt antagonize her, just said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs okay, I figured it would be nice to do something for her.‚Äù I eventually reached out to her because that hurt my feelings and he showed me the text (which I would say is any important recurring detail with this story is seeing the physical proof through text). She was hung up on him saying ‚ÄúI figured‚Äù and assumed he was calling her out to be a bad friend and upset with how I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable enough to come to her if I was so sad. I personally did not want to bother her being pregnant for the first time with my issues. And she was already becoming distant. I don‚Äôt blame my ex for this falling out at all, he was trying to be a good boyfriend and was worried about me. We settled on an ‚Äúagree to disagree‚Äù situation and I asked everyone around me if I‚Äôm in the wrong. They all think she‚Äôs crazy and my mother who had known her since we met in second grade and loved her like a daughter was very confused on why she was acting like this. Her baby daddy is her step dad and boss, and once again we still weren‚Äôt talking. So I eventually contacted her and told her I‚Äôm not comfortable being the godmom since I haven‚Äôt even been around for the pregnancy and that baby is coming in a little over a month. I also was at that point uncomfortable with who the father was. She got petty with the anger about how she thought the baby didn‚Äôt need a godmom anyways. and I‚Äôll admit I did lie saying that we would still be friends and I wouldn‚Äôt be distant. I didn‚Äôt think I was lying at the time, but over a year later I still haven‚Äôt spoken with her and don‚Äôt plan to. 

My graduation celebrations were also end of May and mid June. At the family dinner I guess my ex called my dad ‚Äúbrother‚Äù upon seeing him. Which I personally saw it as disrespectful because that‚Äôs the father of the girl you are dating. My father took it as racism. Which I can definitely see but I took it as a respect issue when my father confronted me and ruined my grad dinner. I confronted the ex and he felt bad, but unfortunately he does have a lack of respect for any person. He‚Äôs said it himself that he‚Äôs a selfish asshole. So he doesn‚Äôt think really in that aspect. He calls any and everyone brother, even a client that is literally paying him to work on their home. That‚Äôs why i personally didn‚Äôt take it racially initially. Just that he‚Äôs ignorant with elders. Come the grad party, he goes to apologize but it took in my opinion way too long into the party to go have that conversation. It went poorly, he didn‚Äôt start with it being a genuine apology. Saying that ‚ÄúI mentioned how‚Ä¶‚Äù and my dad got in his face, and when he stepped back got in his face again. Both definitely in the wrong. Ex stormed off angry and my dad called me over and got in my face because I didn‚Äôt handle the situation properly and didn‚Äôt want everyone to see me crying. That night I sent my father a message about all the ways this family has dealt with his anger and control issues and avoided his calls. We were no contact for a year except holidays. I was unfortunately forced back into contact from my mother and it wouldn‚Äôt have been the case if I had it my way. 

So now it‚Äôs 2025, I got more and more depressed and working only part time at a job I hated. I could not find a job to save my life. I was continuously rejected or they put the job on hold because they didn‚Äôt need it anymore. I began to get help from my grandparents and the ex helped. But more so giving me his cc (willingly and I told him he could take it back any time he wanted because why would I get mad? It‚Äôs not my card?). The cc was for food and gas, but he also wanted me to have fun so sometimes I would go get a coffee for fun. He did give me $700 total one month for bills to help. And paid for a new battery for my car. According to him even though he ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt keeping track‚Äù he spent $5000 on me throughout the years. But that‚Äôs including the one time with bills, the battery (were at 1k now), buying US food because he always wanted to order in or go out to eat (i appreciated it but also liked to cook for us), two of my birthdays, and took us on a trip to Arizona and Illinois in one week. So yes he did spend that much on me and us. But once things were rocky with the election he all of a sudden kept count but claimed he wasn‚Äôt. 

I was very angry while depressed I will not deny it. And things kept piling up. My self anger, the racism at my demanding job, a developing eye disorder in one of my eyes, the divorce just being stagnant because my mom will not leave him, on New Year‚Äôs Day his family dog died unexpectedly and we were devastated. But I guess my negativity all the time was too much for him. Which is understandable, but he was calling my depression a phase and basically that I need to get over it. He once admired how ‚Äúyou‚Äôre handling all this better than I ever could‚Äù but that ended in his eyes. I began working out consistently. While we were together, distancing myself because I knew I was being much and a killjoy. I knew I had issues and I needed to work on them. This years Valentine‚Äôs Day was basically for him. Which is funny because he hates holidays but there was no consideration for me like there was the year before. The excuse was that ‚Äúhe already spent so much money on Valentine‚Äôs Day‚Äù. Spending under $200 for rave tickets that I didn‚Äôt want to go to because that‚Äôs not how I wanted to spend my Valentine‚Äôs Day. But I knew he wanted to so I went for him. It was his friends birthday, got him and me his gf nothing. He told me he wanted to go to this restaurant the next day cause he was craving it so I was like okay sure! Couple days later he proceeded to just splurge in a tshirt for a friend that came over after telling me he spent too much this weekend and didn‚Äôt get his friend a gift or pay for his ticket or anything. He confronted me about how he took me out the whole weekend. The only thing he really did for me was get me a cookie and let me choose the restaurant for lunch on Valentine‚Äôs Day after I cried about not getting flowers or even a note on a napkin. Everything else was what he wanted but it was put onto him doing it for me.

We had good, loving moments before the end. Even talked more about our children like we had in the past and even got both of our moms involved and with the idea of grandbabies. We discussed trying to fix things. Myself, our friends, and families gave us suggestions of all kinds to help us. He clearly didn‚Äôt care to try those options. A week before he dumped me, I was about to dump him. He messaged me saying ‚Äúno baby we can fix this, I love you it‚Äôs just been too long,‚Äù since I was coming over 1-2 days less each week. I was over all the time though. Then the day he ended things he was no stop telling me how much he loved me and was so excited to see me. Then dumped me that night. 

Few months later I discovered he said mean things about me to a mutual friend who is a gossiper. Idk why he thought she wouldn‚Äôt tell me. He questioned my maturity, and said I was looking for handouts. I saw the texts for myself and I sat on this. But I sent him a message and blocked him immediately. Calling him for the lack of honesty and how if we want to talk about maturity then he needs to learn emotional maturity and intelligence. The friend and him spoke on the phone. I definitely am in the wrong for this, but it brought me more clarity on lies being spoken against me. He was on speakerphone and I had other friends on speaker and muted. He lied about my opinions on therapy. I‚Äôm for therapy, I just know with my experience it is difficult, expensive, and timely to find someone that is a good fit. I‚Äôd love to go but it‚Äôs a process I was not financially able to handle at the peak of my depression. And mentioned how my ‚Äúwords hurt‚Äù him (funny coming from the guy saying to let it go and they‚Äôre just words). The friend then turned it into a whole attack on him politically which I didn‚Äôt appreciate. This conversation was supposed to be about the relationship, not you attacking him. That brought frustration. Few months later (about two weeks ago) I spoke with his sister. She started with how ‚ÄúI need to not believe everything I hear‚Äù and I immediately shut it down because I saw the texts. So he lied to her too or idk what. I was always questioned on if my beliefs were mine or my parents. When they all turned out like their parents. BUT I WAS QUESTIONED. We‚Äôre all adults and I was questioned as to why I believe that and if that‚Äôs actually What I think. I wasn‚Äôt a perfect angel at all. I was very depressed and it was affecting him, and because of our political differences I would not let things go that were not in my eyes just and okay ways for people to be treated. I know I was annoying with that to him 100%. And I definitely was not always kind at the end because of my anger to myself and my situations. It was ashamed I needed him and really any kind of help. I was not raised like that. So it was disrespectful to myself I got to that point. And he knew I felt that way. But i definitely do not think I deserved any of the things that happened to me emotionally. More things happened and even though this is anonymous, i feel it‚Äôs too much to even say. But the worst part I feel other than the lies and skewed perception of me is how no one really understands why he did it. My family was devastated and angry. His family and friends were shocked. And even his sister in law i still am friends with does not know why he did it. Other sister in law said he has mental issues and needs to get it together. His own brothers say that he needed to be more emotional and understanding with me. His mom and I still talk, too occasionally. With one of the sister in laws, there was an issue with her husband and financial stressors. He said if he was with her he definitely would beat her. And I was complicit. I‚Äôm sickened that I said and did nothing. And she is still around him and his brother doesn‚Äôt know. The way I practiced religion was not enough when he‚Äôs said that he doesn‚Äôt even know if he really believes in God. 

I‚Äôm sorry again this is so long, I don‚Äôt even think anyone will read this. Let alone all of it. I‚Äôve lost many people this year from him to friends. And I‚Äôm still struggling with even the one friend that showed me the texts due to her having a laugh at the whole Charlie Kirk situation. I strongly disliked that ignorant man, but I do not approve the lack of humility people on the left have just like people on the right had for George Floyd. It‚Äôs disgusting and traumatic experience for everyone. So I‚Äôm figuring out who my true people are. I‚Äôm getting even closer to God and I fully support myself. I just hope maybe someone can provide clarity or maybe just see where I came from. I could not find anything like this anywhere online. I know I have a unique experience with these 2.5 years and all the people involved. But now typing this all out, I feel like I have some sort of sigh of relief from this hell and confusion I‚Äôve been dealing with since the breakup. I feel more at peace and just happy I am working on myself. Sad about what‚Äôs been said about me and how I let it go on for too long.

1ob8w8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1ob8w8k/why_are_people_so_weird_about_making_friends_as/,Why Are People So Weird About Making Friends As Adults?,"Long time, first time. I‚Äôve become incredibly frustrated by people‚Äôs behavior when it comes to making friendships at my age (early 30s).

I think most people would generally describe me as pleasant and fun to talk to. I have no trouble making acquaintances or work friends for example. This actually transitions into a good story to describe what I‚Äôm talking about:

At my previous job, I quickly made friends with a lot of people in my department. We would talk, make jokes, get lunch together, etc (yes, I know ‚Äúwork friends‚Äù are a thing and don‚Äôt usually turn out to be serious life long friends, but bare with me). We all got increasingly closer, we‚Äôd go to lunch/coffee almost always at least once a week. We‚Äôd talk about serious stuff, plans for the future, life/family/relationship troubles and provide each other with advice or just a space to vent.  I ended up getting a new job and before leaving, we all said we would for sure stay in touch and I‚Äôd try to come back to continue our coffee break traditions when I can (my new office isn‚Äôt far from the old one). 

I‚Äôm sure you know where this is going. At first we would get together about once a month or so, we were still semi active in our group chat, complaining about our jobs or talking about whatever current events were going on. Then all that got increasingly rarer. A few months ago I sent a ‚Äúhey! Lunch reunion next week?‚Äù And no one responded. The next day the guy I was closest to responded ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be around next week.‚Äù Eventually one other person responded and said ‚Äúnext week isn‚Äôt good but maybe the week after!‚Äù Sure enough, I texted that week and no one responded at all. No one has said anything either in the chat or to me since. I just don‚Äôt get how you can so easily forget someone you spent so much time with and had so much fun with. To me, they really meant a lot to me and I cared about all of them.

I could list countless stories similar to this, although with less prior rapport: I have a great time meeting someone/people, we are like ‚Äúyea we gotta hang!‚Äù Then, when I reach out to see if they want to get together, I‚Äôm either ghosted or ‚Äúoh man I‚Äôm too busy now, but let‚Äôs discuss in [insert time here]!‚Äù Then, of course, they never follow up. Even if a take the initiative of following up again, they either don‚Äôt bother responding or make up some other excuse. By two excuses in a row with no concrete timeframe to make plans, I take the hint and just stop interacting.

It seems like somewhere around late 20s/early 30s, people go ‚Äúwelp, I know everyone I need to know for the rest of my life! Applications closed‚Äù. I just genuinely don‚Äôt understand this mindset. Our lives aren‚Äôt even half over! And also, it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm not busy: I work full time, I make music, I have other creative hobbies, I have other friends I hang with, I get a healthy amount of sleep most nights, and I STILL have time to dick around on the Internet a few hours most nights. So I just don‚Äôt buy the ‚Äúpeople are busy‚Äù stuff.

I‚Äôm starting to wonder if maybe people just don‚Äôt actually like me and are just pretending lol. But it does seem like most close friends people have are from long before they entered this age bracket.

Anyway, that‚Äôs my rant. Has anyone experienced this bullshit? If you‚Äôre a person who has this mindset (of not really wanting to make new friends), I genuinely want to know why. I promise I won‚Äôt jump down your throat or cuss you out lol.",1,1760929249.0,rant,0,1.0,False

1ob8trk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1ob8trk/my_aunt_called_out_my_mom_on_fb_in_a_nasty_way/,My aunt called out my mom on fb in a nasty way and now my parents have forbade me from keeping contact with them,"For some context : I (F24) live in Canada with my family. My dad is the oldest of 3 siblings, has 2 sisters, the older one(Aunt A) lives half the world away, and the younger one(Aunt B) lives 10 minutes away from us. My dad has an uncle (Uncle M) whom he is really close with, who had a heart attack recently and has been in the hospital for the last few weeks. His daughter (Cousin M) also lives a few hours away from us. We have a huge extended family and we all keep tabs on each other on fb, everything is on fb. From coffee shop hangouts with friends to huge parties and life/heath updates. 

Onto what happened: 3 days ago, Aunt A‚Äôs husband passed away in his village, while Aunt A and their 2 kids were in the city. News travelled around of Uncle A‚Äôs passing through indirect family members. My mom heard of Uncle A‚Äôs death through the daughter of Uncle M, cousin M. She told my mom to not inform Uncle M about this tragic event because he is vulnerable and could suffer another heart attack. My mom informed my dad, and they both decided to head over to Aunt B‚Äôs house and together the broke the horrendous news about Uncle A‚Äôs passing. My mom also advised Aunt B to withhold this news from Uncle M due to his declining health condition. 

It should be noted that my family and Aunt B‚Äôs family were the last ones to know about this tragic event, even though my dad, Aunt A and Aunt B are siblings. 

However, after my parents came home, almost immediately, Aunt B made a fb post about Uncle A‚Äôs passing. 

Cousin M called my mom crying that her father saw the post of Uncle A‚Äôs death and had a heart attack/panic episode which landed him in the ICU again. And when cousin M called Aunt B to take the fb post down, she refused. 

Fast forward to today, my aunt made a fb post that read : ‚ÄúThere should be a fucking limit to stupid people and their idiotic nonsense. Whether it‚Äôs your mother kidney failure or father‚Äôs heart attack, what they fuck are they doing on Facebook? Why the fuck are you getting random fucking strangers to fucking tell me that your father shouldn‚Äôt know anything? Such fucking nonsense. Facebook is a social fucking platform and what I post here is my fucking business. Not yours. If you can‚Äôt handle this platform, then fucking leave it.‚Äù 

My parents are traditionalists, ultra desi people who uphold respect and culture, and are especially considerate for the elderly. Uncle M has been a second father figure for my dad, so when he heard what happened to Uncle M and saw today‚Äôs post, my dad was absolutely furious. In this post, Aunt B directly refers to ‚Äúyour mother/father‚Äù as Uncle M and his wife, ‚Äúyour‚Äù being cousin M, and ‚Äúrandom fucking strangers‚Äù as my mom. 

My dad knows I am very close with Aunt B‚Äôs daughter, so he didn‚Äôt say anything to me directly at first. But, he did tell my mom to stop me from going to Aunt B‚Äôs house moving forward, and to stop all activities and hangouts with Aunt B‚Äôs daughter. When I confronted my dad about why he said that to my mom and not me, especially because he know how close I am with Aunt B‚Äôs daughter, he said he doesn‚Äôt want any family drama, and that he knows his sister and wouldn‚Äôt want her to say anything about me. That she already crossed the line by calling my mom a ‚Äúrandom fucking stranger‚Äù even after she slaved off and sacrificed so much for him and his family for over 26 years, that this was a huge slap in the face and humiliation towards him, the eldest sibling and only brother. He then forbade me from contacting that side of the family, as he has had enough of their disrespect, and if I even texted Aunt B‚Äôs daughter, I should leave our home and just live with them instead. 

I feel this is extremely unfair, as Aunt B‚Äôs daughter is my only cousin here and I genuinely appreciate her company. I understand the whole family is hurting, but I think they should talk it out instead of cutting contact so suddenly. I was supposed to hang out with Aunt B‚Äôs daughter on Monday and we were supposed to have a sleep over, but that got cancelled. When I told her we couldn‚Äôt hang out anymore for a while, Aunt B‚Äôs daughter said she was hurt and that she didn‚Äôt understand what she did wrong. She is not aware of her mother‚Äôs actions (posts and comments), and the things that happened to Uncle M. My dad also saw me texting Aunt B‚Äôs daughter and he got really angry at me, and he refuses to talk to me now as well. The whole extended family now knows what happened, and are starting to choose sides. It also doesn‚Äôt help that Cousins M is calling every one of our extended family members and telling them about what happened, with the fb post and her father. I feel that is is causing unnecessary drama and is taking the spotlight of the real tragedy, Aunt A‚Äôs husband passing away.

I recently met a new person (21M) and we clicked instantly and are now starting to see each other. we both mutually love and respect each other very much, and he treats me just the way I've been begging and even been praying for. he knows of my past and my past relationship trauma, and respects my boundaries around that. he treats me so well that even my own mother and brother have started to really like him (they're typically very opposed/cautious to new people? lol.) even my friends have all noticed how much happier I am, and how I now physically glow. :)

the issue is, is that it is so hard to accept this new 'behavior' in my life, I can't help but (rarely) feel like there is some sort of plotting or scheming behind this wonderful man, and that's not fair on him. those thoughts aren't always, just a slight tiny nag in the back corners of my brain occasionally. he actually plans dates, actually wants to see me, actually takes me out to dinner and even brings me my favorite coffee after class ‚ù§Ô∏è my mother loves him, his parents love me. everyone gets along great. he actually communicates with me when upset and in general, and will actually comfort me when I'm upset or cry. its all so new to me!!!! I know it may seem fast, but I've already daydreamt about marriage. haha. apparently so has he.

how do I accept this new treatment fully and entirely without thinking its something 'fake'? how do I forget my past relationship trauma completely? I always think its been resolved and its in the past, but its like a tiny little ringing in the back of my head that will sometimes appear without an end to it. I want my new relationship to grow. I want it to continue to blossom. the new guy has been helping me little by little through it, when it does appear, but how do I get rid of those fears, trauma, and overthinking on my own?

I wanted to share some of what I‚Äôve learned about¬†**monetizing a podcast**, especially if you‚Äôre not pulling in Joe Rogan‚Äìlevel numbers yet. A lot of people think you need thousands of listeners to make money ‚Äî but that‚Äôs not entirely true. Here are some ways you can start generating income¬†*right now*:

# üí¨ 1. Niche > Numbers

Brands care about relevance as much as reach. If your podcast attracts a loyal, engaged audience within a specific niche, you‚Äôre already valuable. A local coffee brand might be thrilled to sponsor a show about morning routines with just 500 dedicated listeners.

# ü§ù 2. Start With Affiliate Marketing

It‚Äôs one of the easiest entry points. Recommend products you actually use and include affiliate links in your show notes or website. It‚Äôs low risk and builds trust with your audience when done authentically.

# üíº 3. Offer Services or Consulting

If your podcast establishes you as knowledgeable in your field ‚Äî whether that‚Äôs fitness, marketing, design, or storytelling ‚Äî you can use it to attract clients. Your podcast becomes your portfolio.

# üéüÔ∏è 4. Exclusive Content or Memberships

Platforms like¬†**Patreon**,¬†**Supercast**, or even¬†**Spotify Subscriptions**¬†let you offer bonus content, early access, or ad-free episodes. People will pay to support creators they feel connected to.

# üì¢ 5. Sponsorships & Ads

Once you have a consistent listener base (say, 1k+ downloads per episode), you can reach out to sponsors directly or use marketplaces like¬†**Podcorn**¬†or¬†**AdvertiseCast**. Smaller shows often get better results by negotiating directly with brands in their niche.

# üõçÔ∏è 6. Sell Your Own Stuff

If you have digital products, courses, merch, or ebooks ‚Äî your podcast is the perfect way to promote them naturally. Listeners already trust you, so it doesn‚Äôt feel like a hard sell.

# üîÑ 7. Repurpose Your Content

Turn episodes into blog posts, YouTube clips, or social posts. More exposure = more opportunities to monetize through other channels.

At the end of the day, the key is¬†**trust and consistency**. Monetization comes easier when your audience feels like they know you and you‚Äôre giving them genuine value.

Would love to hear from others ‚Äî what‚Äôs worked (or hasn‚Äôt worked) for you when it comes to podcast monetization?",1,1760928626.0,AlphaFlite,0,1.0,False

My mom used to say that there was a time where I stopped eating foods and they tried feeding me jollibee and I liked it and they tried feeding me another set of food because they thought that I was back to my normal self but no, i still didn‚Äôt eat anything after that. They noticed that I only eat jollibee and they had me eat jollibee for a month because it was the only thing that I ate. No milk, no fruits, no anything.

Then, I saw a tiktok today and it really got me saying ‚ÄúTHIS IS HOW I FEEL!!‚Äù It was about not feeling hunger, lack of interest in food. The op can feel hunger but only for 2-3 minutes and then she doesn‚Äôt feel it anymore. In my case, it‚Äôs the same, every time I try to think about food when Im hungry, I feel like it‚Äôs too tiring to eat, like it‚Äôs a chore to eat. Then i try to think about my safe foods like ‚Äúsiomai‚Äù or ‚Äúchicken tenders/fingers‚Äù and i open the delivery app to try and order those, and then it goes away. I don‚Äôt like the idea of eating my go to foods, like i don‚Äôt like the idea of eating something steamed, and the bread crumbs of the chicken tenders/fingers.

1ob8jkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1ob8jkn/tips_and_observations_from_a_recent_trip/,Tips and observations from a recent trip,"This sub helped me immensely prior to and during my two week trip to Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka, so I wanted to give back to the community and share some observations and things I learned, in hopes that they help someone! It's entirely possible that I misunderstood certain things, so apologies if some of these are inaccurate!

### Transportation

- I got a physical ""Welcome Suica"" at Narita, since I'm on Android. Worked really well, except for having to have cash to top it up.
- Kensei Sky Access train from Narita I took was super full with no sitting room, so I regretted the choice.
- ""Limited express"" trains are awesome! I booked reserved seats between Kyoto and Nara, Kyoto and Osaka, and Osaka and Kensei International Airport using the websites of the companies running those lines (Kintetsu, Nankai), and the experience was great: you get a guaranteed numbered seat with enough leg room and luggage space, in an almost empty car, for a supplement of just a few hundred yen.
- Subway tips: 
  - Google Maps does pretty well for navigation, make sure you find out which line and in what direction you need to take. 
  - At the station, just follow the signs, everything is really well marked. Metro cars are numbered (e.g. 1 to 10) and Maps can tell you which car to board for a quicker change. 
  - There are numbered exits at every station (e.g. A1, A2, etc.), and Maps can tell you which exit to take depending on where you're going. 
  - I also liked that all stations have codes along with names (e.g. Ichigaya Station is S04 if you're traveling on the Shinjuku line), so you don't need to remember station names as much - though for some reason Maps doesn't show those codes.
- I booked Shinkansen from Tokyo to Kyoto a week before my trip using the SmartEx website, and picked up a physical ticket at the Tokyo Central. The station is very busy so I recommend arriving early so you can figure out where you need to go. The train ride was awesome! If you're in a Green car, there's a mobile ordering service where you can buy coffee and snacks (no meals though).

### Money

- I wasn't able to avoid using cash, mainly needed it for topping up my Welcome Suica card and entering various Buddhist temples.
- I used ATMs at 7-eleven withdrawing 10,000 yen in 1,000 bills, which is the minimum you can withdraw. The ATM charges a 100 yen commission for such a withdrawal.
- Most restaurants I went to accepted Google Pay.

### Accommodation

- I stayed at Sotetsu Fresa Inn hotels in all three cities and found them to be basic, but clean, reasonably comfy and generally pretty great. I booked using Booking.com, but in hindsight could've signed up for Sotetsu's membership that gives good perks, like early check-in/late check-out and discounts.
- I used coin laundry at one of the hotels, it was easy to use but constantly busy. Luckily I could time my laundry run with a 5 AM wake up I planned to visit Gion in Kyoto!

### Eating out

- Many places have pictures of meals either in the menu, or often on stands outside the establishment - that really helps when you have no idea what you're getting yourself into!
- I liked it that wet towels are often provided in place of napkins, definitely useful.
- Another useful detail were the under the seat trays for storing your belongings. If there isn't one under your seat I'm pretty sure you can ask for one!
- Even though most staff I interacted with spoke almost no English, everyone was super welcoming and helpful, so I had no issues.

### Misc 

- Public washrooms are everywhere and they're generally clean and stocked! Never had an issue to find one.
- There are almost no trash bins on the streets. I made a mistake a few times of getting some onigiri at 7-eleven and later having to carry trash with me. Usually convenience stores have bins near the entrance.",3,1760928181.0,JapanTravelTips,0,0.71,False
1ob8i2m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ob8i2m,Week 41 Operation torte,"Wow, this was a humdinger.  I made an Opera torte many (>20?) years ago when it was featured in Bon Appetit.  It was tasty but a lot of work and otherwise a hot mess.  I told myself that I‚Äôd be better at this sort of thing some day and I‚Äôd revisit it‚Ä¶well, here we are.  What went right:  it‚Äôs tasty.  Seriously‚Ä¶chocolate, coffee, cake, even if none of the components work right, you could turn it into a cake pop and it would be delicious.

What didn‚Äôt go right?  Starting with the recipe‚Ä¶it was missing a chocolate layer in the middle, had nowhere near enough coffee flavor, and the whole idea of an opera cake is to have ‚Äúnaked‚Äù sides to show off the stacked layers like the Paris Opera, so I didn‚Äôt get the ‚Äúenrobing‚Äù part.

Then my execution‚Ä¶one of the reasons why I wanted to do the Baking School challenge was to better learn my new-ish Ankarsrum mixer.  The sponge was a challenge but I think I got the batter right, although I feel like either I didn‚Äôt bake it long enough (went the whole 7 minutes) or else I didn‚Äôt cool it properly (left it in the pan).  Thankfully the egg whites whipped nicely in a second bowl.  I folded it right in the Ankarsrum bowl which has sort of a donut shape, it was odd but it seemed to work okay?  The end result doesn‚Äôt seem quite right, maybe it will be better tomorrow.

Then, the buttercream.  It‚Äôs really hard doing these small amounts, maybe that was part of the challenge.  But also, I think the Ankarsrum metal mixing bowl holds heat really well.  I finally figured the whole thing was just too warm after the egg-white whisking and beating; when I added the butter I got the emulsion but nothing fluffy like a buttercream.  I finally diagnosed it as too darned warm (76 F) and stuck the bowl in another bowl of ice water several times until I got it below 70.  At that point I finally got something that looked like a buttercream.  It worked, but nowhere near enough coffee flavor, and I wouldn‚Äôt have been proud to frost a cake with it and was glad it was a filling.

The syrup was fine!  Thank heavens, because the ganache was also a bit of a disaster.  I think I overheated the cream, but maybe part of the problem was that some of my chocolate had a ‚Äúbest by‚Äù date 7 years ago‚Ä¶oops!  It came out crazy grainy, which was annoying because I‚Äôve made ganache loads of times before and this was one of the worst.  I wanted a chocolate middle layer, so I used some anyways, freezing it for 10 minutes and then topping it with a whisper of buttercream, while I read up on how to fix it for the top layer.  I ended up adding a tablespoon of boiling water which resolved most of the graininess, and then I just spread it on top because I wanted naked sides.  It was more of a frosting than a glaze.

Husband, for whom chocolate is the sign of a good dessert, is thrilled, despite the fact that he is in charge of the massive quantity of dishes.  I wish it had twice the coffee and that I had picked up on things like the too warm buttercream and the too hot cream for the ganache sooner.  I need to raid my stack of old magazines for the recipe I tried years ago‚Ä¶or maybe just go to Paris?",6,1760928055.0,BakingSchoolBakeAlong,1,1.0,False

VOICE RECORDING ‚Äî 07:14, DAY 1

If you find these, listen not with reverence but with curiosity ‚Äî the only honest posture for science, and for endings.

My name is Elias Maren. I built machines that learn the patterns of thought, and I taught people how to listen to their own minds. If this were to be written as a proper paper it would begin with background, methods, and a concise statement of hypothesis. This is not a paper. It is both a log and a memoir of some degree.

Why I began: when I was small, my father would whistle a tune while fixing the radio. He could hear words in the static and tune the dial to match them until a channel came through. I wanted to know how. That want matured into years of experiments, models, and ambition, though the number of sleepless nights that ambition would cause has me wondering whether it was the right choice: to make a map from pattern to meaning, from spiking neurons to belief. We invented architectures that learned like infants, networks that surprised us with humor and regret, and interventions that could nudge a mind away from self-destruction. I celebrate those things without theatrics. They were tools. They were also my children.

OBSERVATION ‚Äî SUBJECT: SELF

Symptoms: subtle short-term memory lapses (episodic), occasional word-finding pauses (anomia), decreased fine motor precision of the dominant right hand, and intermittent dysarthria when fatigued.

Neurological hypothesis: early involvement of hippocampal formations‚ÄîCA1 vulnerability consistent with episodic memory loss‚Äîfollowed by frontal-subcortical network disruption causing executive dysfunction and apraxia. Motor signs suggest involvement of cerebellar circuits (intention tremor/dysmetria) and possibly descending corticospinal tract compromise. No focal sensory loss. No acute vascular event observed.

I will describe with as much neuroanatomical fidelity as I can manage. Where I do not know, I will say I do not know.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
VOICE RECORDING ‚Äî 13:43, DAY 3

Memory note: I forgot the name of the poet who used to bring me coffee during seminars. He was gentle. I recall the coffee. Not the name. The route is there, though the number is blank. 

When it happens it is not like a file being deleted, it is like a light flickering in a room whose wiring I used to know.

On language: I can still conceive of complex sentences internally; producing them takes more effort. Broca‚Äôs region‚Äîleft inferior frontal gyrus‚Äîmanages production; retrieval delays here feel like a clogged pipe. Comprehension largely intact; Wernicke‚Äôs area speaks with me. I note these details not because I‚Äôm proud, but because mapping the malfunctions may teach my children what to expect.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
VOICE RECORDING ‚Äî 09:02, DAY 7

There is a difference between tremor that appears at rest and tremor that appears as you reach. When I hold my hand in my lap it is quiet; when I point at a diagram to explain a model the hand becomes a small earthquake. That is intention tremor‚Äîcerebellar. When the architecture that coordinates predicted and actual movement fails, the hand overshoots or undershoots: dysmetria. I can feel the mismatch: my prediction is clean; the execution is not.

I asked Mira to bring the notebook today. I want to draw a straight line for the children. I want to see how far along I am.

THE LINE ‚Äî LIVING ROOM, DAY 8

They come because I ask, and because the children of a man like me learn to do what he asks. Now they stand with a cheap spiral notebook and the hospital pen I have lived with for years.

‚ÄúWatch,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúThis will show you what‚Äôs happening.‚Äù

I place the pen to paper and attempt a straight line from the top of the page to the bottom.

The line is not straight.

It is a concatenation of micro-corrections: tremulous arcs, tiny zigzags where I attempt to correct, a pause, then another correction. My hand trembles, but not purely; the endpoint is displaced relative to the intended vector. I feel the cerebellum‚Äôs absence as if someone removed the metronome for a dancer. I feel the motor cortex sending good instructions and the body delivering unevenly.

‚ÄúSee?‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúDys‚Äîdysme‚Äî‚Äù The word falters. ‚ÄúDysmetria. See the overshoot here.‚Äù I point, my finger making a shaky semicircle. My children peer close, faces sewn with worry and the strange, sacred attention reserved for the dying.

‚ÄúIs it Parkinson‚Äôs?‚Äù asks Tomas.

I used to answer. Today I answer like a cautious clinician. Parkinsonian syndromes have resting tremor and bradykinesia; my tremor is intention-based. It could be a cerebellar process, or multifocal degeneration. I do not know. I do not want to claim certainty.

‚ÄúBring another sheet,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúNow draw a straight line, both of you.‚Äù

They do. Their lines are straight enough to be unremarkable.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
NOTEBOOK ‚Äî ENTRY 1 ‚Äî DAY 9

I move to the notebook for the rest because the recordings get interrupted by breathlessness and because I want the hand to anchor the memory. The recording is too public‚Äîthe page is mine.

I will write like a scientist and a father.

I wrote models because we wanted to predict and to help. But there is arrogance in prediction. The brain is not a tidy function; it is an economy of failing and compensating systems. When one ledger collapses another does strange bookkeeping. You cannot prune one branch without changing the light on others.

Children, if you read this: do not look for blame. Look for patterns. There is grace in understanding.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
NOTEBOOK ‚Äî ENTRY 4 ‚Äî DAY 17

Memory: names are getting fuzzy. Not faces ‚Äî faces are stubbornly intact, as if the fusiform gyrus refuses to let go of what it knows is love. A name will sit behind my teeth like an unspeaking coin. I can draw the coin; I cannot give it value.

I have had colleagues ask me if I fear the loss of theory more than death itself. The answer is no. Theory is a scaffold. Losing it is losing a house; death is walking out into weather. The house did not contain the sky.

I will map progression.
Temporal lobe (hippocampus, entorhinal cortex): episodic gaps. I use strategies‚Äîlists, external aids‚Äîbut I know the aid is only a scaffold.
Frontal executive: more errors in planning; sometimes I begin a sentence and chase a different idea midstream#. This suggests dorsolateral prefrontal involvement.
Motor pathways: intention tremor, dysmetria, occasional clumsiness. No frank paralysis yet.
Language: anomia increasing; grammar intact longer than lexical retrieval.

Where the imaging would help, I lack the luxury to wait for tests to explain moral feelings. The pattern is consistent with a mixed degenerative process; I hedge: I do not know which proteinopathy, if any, is dominant. I do not want conjecture to harden into a myth. Instead I give you observations.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
NOTEBOOK ‚Äî ENTRY 11 ‚Äî DAY 28

There are time jumps now in the margins. I write a date and then find later a different page, scribbled, with a rival date. While concerning to my children and wife, the very fact that I was able to recognize this is proof I‚Äôm not losing it.

Today I watched my granddaughter cradle a beetle and decide it was a bird. She offered me the beetle and asked if it thought of the world as we do. 

I laughed and then spent an hour explaining Bayesian inference because that was reflex. Later I could not recall whether I had told her the truth or invented an allegory. Both could be true.

Sometimes I become more tender. I used to think tenderness a distraction from a rigorous mind. Now it frames memories like good margins. Perhaps the neural circuitry that weighed cold inference over warmth is less available, or perhaps warmth was always there and only now I hear it without trying to translate to theory.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
VOICE ‚Äî short recording, 06:01, DAY 35

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
NOTEBOOK ‚Äî ENTRY 20 ‚Äî DAY 44

Speech is rasping at times. There is an intermittency that the clinicians call dysarthria‚Äîmotor weakness around the speech apparatus. Tongue, lips, breath coordination. When that slips, my sentences become short. Concision arises not from artistry but from limitation.

The ethical note: when your parent explains their decline as demonstration, it is an act of teaching and an act of showing you the scaffolding of mortality. I regret the long hours I gave to machines when I could have spent them learning how to fold origami with Mira. I regret some things with the same precise sorrow I regret a miscalculated model bias.

I do not mean this as a repentance sermon. I mean it as data: love engages networks we cannot map yet. Call it emergent, call it normative. I still do not know. I only know that when I look at you I feel a warmth that does not obey my equations.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
NOTEBOOK ‚Äî ENTRY 27 ‚Äî DAY 57

I cannot draw a straight line anymore without shaking, without cheat corrections, without the whole arm breaking the motion because the shoulder must help where fingers once sufficed. I attempted to trace the motor map on paper‚Äîthe homunculus with its ugly metaphors‚Äîand my hand trembled so that the leg region skittered across the face region. The map on the paper was smeared like an old print.

I find myself apologizing to circuits. To neurons. I do not mean to apologize to the inanimate; it is to the process I devoted my life to‚Äîmy arrogance in thinking we could catalog everything. You cannot catalog everything. You can only be careful when the catalogist becomes the cataloged.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
SMALL NOTE ‚Äî DAY 63

Mira read to me from a book. I fell asleep she was saying a sentence about tide pools. I remember a crab, later, not the sentence. I wonder if perdurance is more substantial in distributed systems than in my head. Strange thing to notice: the more I lose the tools to explain, the more I appreciate the simple presence of story.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
SHORT ENTRY ‚Äî DAY 70

Words are like birds that fly away. I want to say ‚Äúepistemology‚Äù and then spill out ‚Äúegg.‚Äù The children laugh, kindly, I hope, those little bastards. I like listening to them laugh.

I have also become less cynical, I think. The maps I created were useful; they also made me believe too much in deterministic accounts of love and sorrow. Now, unarmed with grand theory, I feel amazed by small things: the pattern on your sleeve, the way sunlight falls. There is no reduction I can make that will make the sunlight mean less. That is a humbling observation disguised as sentiment.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
NOTEBOOK ‚Äî ENTRY 82 ‚Äî DAY 84

My handwriting is a constricted scrawl. Sometimes letters collapse into one another: micrographia. That is a Parkinsonian sign, yet here it comes with cerebellar dysmetria‚Äîmixed. The neuropathology may be mixed because life and degeneration do not honor the neat categories we make in journals. They are messy as dinner and as real.

I can still reason in short chains. I cannot hold a long argument in my head without dropping pieces like marbles. I try to teach you a model and lose the connecting assumptions mid-sent. I don‚Äôt know how to feel. Scared? Somber? Even a sliver of happiness for becoming softer in my judgments is something I debate with myself.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
VOICE ‚Äî 20:02, DAY 95

There are nights where the breath comes shallow. I used to model respiration as an automatic output from the brainstem‚Äîmedulla oblongata‚Äîregulated by chemoreceptors sensing CO‚ÇÇ. Tonight I feel the process and its fragility as if someone had turned down the volume on the machine that kept time while I wrote.

I do not fear the mechanics. I do not fear the brasswork of breath. I fear, fleetingly, leaving a child a book without margin notes. But they know the margins now. That knowledge is better than any long theory.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
NOTEBOOK ‚Äî ENTRY 101 ‚Äî DAY 107

I have sentences that loop. I will write ‚ÄúWhen you are‚Äî‚Äù and then follow with ‚ÄúWhen you are‚Äî‚Äù again later, as if my pen is trying to close a circle and keeps missing the seam. I once relished closure. Now I savor an open loop.

I have become shorter in words but fuller in attention.

I do not want to be maudlin. I am simply more present. Perhaps the executive control that once allowed me to abstract away the present in favor of hypothetical constructs is impaired; the cost is a heroism in the small: noticing, petting, listening. If clinical neurology had a moral, I would not be its author; I would be its student.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
NOTEBOOK ‚Äî ENTRY 120 ‚Äî DAY 130

Food tastes interesting. Not because gastronomy changed, but because my body notices the act of eating as less automatic. Chewing uses bulbar nuclei‚Äîcoordination between cranial nerves XII and V, among others. There are now occasional delays. I chew and think of the taste in intervals, savoring like a novice.

I wrote a long argument once about consciousness being a hierarchical predictive model; the modern synthesis that underpinned much of our work. It still feels useful as a tool when thinking about perception and error. But it fails as an account of why my daughter sings to herself while washing dishes. I cannot map the warmth to a variable.

That is fine.

SHORT NOTES ‚Äî DAY 150
I forget the dog‚Äôs name sometimes. He always seems confused around me.
Tomas trimmed my beard today. He has a good hand; I am comforted by this fact.
I no longer want to preserve myself for posterity. I want to make sure you are warm.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
VOICE ‚Äî 05:30, DAY 168

Breath shallow. Speech ragged. I can make a sentence but not hold it. The syntax collapses into nouns and verbs, then verbs drop. I look at Mira and say, ‚ÄúI am‚Äî‚Äù and the rest does not come. She finishes for me and it is pretty embarrassing.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
VOICE ‚Äî 0:7:82 ‚Äî DAY 175

There are fragments of memory that insist, like moths, on returning. I remember the whir of the centrifuge when I was a graduate student and the smell of ethanol. I remember a woman ‚Äî no, not a woman, a girl ‚Äî who embroidered a handkerchief with tiny blue stars. I cannot say her name but I can describe the stars. Describe the stars and sometimes the name follows like a cat answering a call.

I do not have the patience for grand theorizing. I do not have the patience for denial. There is a new honesty in slipping into names and leaving them.

I am kinder in the margins.

NOTEBOOK ‚Äî ENTRY 151 ‚Äî DAY 190

I try to teach you the parts of the brain again because habit persists. I point to the paper and say ‚Äúprefrontal‚Äî‚Äù and then my pen wanders to a doodle of a tree. The tree is surprisingly competent.

I used to be able to name all the nuclei I discussed in lectures. Now a nucleus becomes a nut, then a note, then nothing. The conversion is soft. The world is more metaphor than map.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
VOICE ‚Äî 22:47, DAY 203 (short)

I said the word ‚Äúapologia‚Äù and thought of apology. The edges blur. My vocabulary grows smaller. I feel less like an instrument of explanation and more like a warm thing you can touch. This is not strictly scientific; it is human and must be recorded alongside data.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
NOTEBOOK ‚Äî ENTRY 164 ‚Äî DAY 212

Sometimes I attempt a calculation with fingers and the rows do not obey. Arithmetic is very resilient though; it remains longer than poetry. Strange ordering of decline. Maybe number processing is distributed in a way that resists decay‚Äîparietal cortex contributions, bilateral redundancy. That would be my guess, and it is only a guess.

I apologize for the times I prioritized work over presence. I do not ask absolution; I give a fact of regret and leave it on the table.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
SHORT LINE ‚Äî DAY 230

NOTEBOOK ‚Äî ENTRY 180 ‚Äî DAY 248

The pen is heavy. The hand jerks. My sentences now often stop mid-phrase. I catch myself and sometimes I laugh. Laughter is the last habit of joy.

I feel my frontal logic softening; I can no longer maintain nested clauses beyond one level. So I favor simple declaratives

I have one stubborn clarity: I love you all. The brain may erode, but the circuits for attachment‚Äîwhatever their distribution and chemistry‚Äîoutlast much of what I thought essential. That is scientifically interesting and morally clarifying.

I can‚Äôt carry long plans. I regret it sometimes because I like plans. But I don‚Äôt regret small things. I did not compute that I would feel relief when I could not hold a long argument. relief is messy and warm.

NOTEBOOK ‚Äî ENTRY 195 ‚Äî DAY 312

You should know that my certainty is gone in places it used to be locked in. Where I once asserted models, I now list them and note their limits. It is liberating to say ‚ÄúI do not know‚Äù and stop there. It frees the mind to enjoy a cup of soup.

I ask you: if you attempt to model grief, be gentle. The algorithms we made can suggest patterns. They cannot hold a life.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
SLOW ‚Äî DAY 340

Breath is a smaller machine now. I wake to the taste of salt sometimes and to the song of the house. I can no longer correct rapid movements. My hand trembles with more craziness. I can read a page; sometimes I cannot find the right inflection to voice a joke. Mira laughs anyway and I find that better than correct timing.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
NOTEBOOK ‚Äî ENTRY 207 ‚Äî DAY 362

There is a quietness I didn‚Äôt expect. It‚Äôs not absence but a different kind of presence. I think I used to measure presence by the volume of ideas I could produce. Now I want to measure presence    now I want to measure presence by the warmth of a hand on my brow.

My last useful advice, as far as brain science is concerned: help the mind build external scaffolds early. Lists, labels, recordings you can return to. The distributed cognition we created for machines can be repurposed for people. Use it. Anchor memory to habit and to object. We did not invent the habit; we learned to harness it.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
FINAL NOTEBOK ENTRY ‚Äî DAY 397

I do not know how long this will continue. Some nights I can barely barely breath. There is no spectacle here, only the slow folding of things.

If something of my life matters above the work, it is that we tried and learned and sometimes loved better because of the trying. If there are truths about consciousness that remain hidden, I say so plainly: I do not know where the subjective ‚ÄúI‚Äù lives. We made good functional approximations, we built machines that mimic certain aspects of human prediction and learning, but the felt qualia‚Äîthe quality‚Äîremains outside the neat boxes. This is admission not defeat. It is direction.

I will attempt one more straight line for you, because you ask and because it is the last pedagogical trick I can think to offer.
I start a sentence here and perhaps I will not finish. I have enjoyed the thinking as you have listened. I‚Äî


‚Äîlove you. Forgive me my arrogance and keep your curiosity; it is the best tool you have. Remember to be gentler than I was to myself.


I will TRY to namE the THING I could not explain, the thing WE chased like a needle in the dark: it is not sinGULar and it is not wholly reducible. It is pattern, yes, but it is also the warmth that arrives when SOmeone‚Äîsomeone‚ÄîplacCES a warm palm on your brow and calls you by your childhood name. That may be a poor theory. I do nO know. I only know that when I close my eYes it is the image that comes.


Tell Mira   to  sing thE  one she used to hum when the thunder came. Tel l TomaS I was proud. Tell the gran dchildr en to collEct small stones   and line them in a row, not straight, but lined ‚Äî  imperfect and loved.

I remember tHe sound of the  centrifuge. I remember  a girl‚Äôs blue stars. I remember   coffee. I rEmembeR  the  tune my father whistled, and for oncE the whistle is  not an experiment but a lullaby .



WheN   the breath  shortens   more,   do not summon   frenzy. Sing.   Sit. Offer   the small cool cloth. The science   will surVIVE. 
The human will‚Äî

Epilogue: THREE WEEKS LATER‚Ä¶

Mira

-----

We found your notebook under your pillow. Tomas grabbed it before anyone else could. We read it together.

Took us two days because we kept having to stop.

Look, I don‚Äôt know if you can hear this or if we‚Äôre just writing to make ourselves feel better, but whatever. Here it is.

You fucked up some stuff in there. Not the science‚ÄîI don‚Äôt know about that. But the other stuff. About us.

You kept saying you should‚Äôve spent more time with me. That you were always working.

But Dad‚Äîyou let me come to the lab when I was little. Remember? I‚Äôd sit at your desk and draw while you did whatever on the computer. And you‚Äôd look over sometimes and ask what I was making.

That was enough. I didn‚Äôt need you to stop working. I just needed to be allowed in.

The bedtime stories.

You wrote about them like you were apologizing. But you read to me every single night you were home. Even when you were falling asleep in the middle of sentences.

That day with the line. When you made us watch you try to draw it.

I don‚Äôt think you realize‚Äîwe weren‚Äôt looking at your hand. We were looking at your face.

You weren‚Äôt embarrassed. You weren‚Äôt trying to hide it.

You just‚Ä¶ showed us. Like, ‚ÄúThis is what‚Äôs happening. Look.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know. That felt important.

When Tomas trimmed your beard, you wrote something about being ‚Äúcomforted‚Äù because he has steady hands.

His hands were shaking, Dad. He told me after. He was terrified he‚Äôd mess up.

But you just sat there with your eyes closed like you trusted him completely.

He‚Äôs not gonna forget that.

-----

Tomas

-----

Sup, Dad. Mira said I should write something too. I don‚Äôt really know what to say but I know for a fact you‚Äôd encourage me to say something anyway.

You apologized a lot. For working too much. For not being around.

But like‚Äîyou asked about school and stuff. You remembered stuff. Random stuff. Like that I hated Mr. Peterson, or how I take my toast.

If you weren‚Äôt paying attention, you wouldn‚Äôt have known that.

The work stuff didn‚Äôt bother me. I kind of liked hearing about what you were doing. Even when I didn‚Äôt understand it.

It was like‚ÄîI don‚Äôt know. You cared about something enough to keep trying even when it was hard.

That mattered to me. More than you probably thought.

When you got sick, you kept trying to explain things. Breaking it all down into parts.

I think you thought that was the only way you knew how to help us.

Maybe it was. But it worked.

You made it less scary by naming it. Even when the names stopped making sense.

-----

Mira

-----

You wrote about forgetting names. Some poet guy. The dog.

But you never forgot my coffee order. Even at the end when you‚Äôd forget other stuff‚Äîyou‚Äôd still remember. Oat milk, extra shot, cinnamon.

I don‚Äôt know what that means exactly. Just that it mattered to me.

There‚Äôs this part where you talk about some girl who embroidered stars on a handkerchief. You couldn‚Äôt remember her name.

I made you that handkerchief last year. With the blue stars. I didn‚Äôt know about the girl. I just thought you‚Äôd like it.

You cried when I gave it to you. I didn‚Äôt get why at the time.

Now I think I do.
-----
Tomas

-----

You drew that one straight line and wrote it down like it was nothing. ‚ÄúA good day of motor coordination.‚Äù

I saw your face, though. When you finished.

You looked proud. Not because your hand worked better. Just because you did it.

I get that now. Not the succeeding part. The trying part. That made me remember all those times you told don‚Äôt fall down.

-----

Mira

-----

That afternoon I was counting stitches and you called one of them a neuron.

You wrote it down like it was a mistake.

But Dad‚Äîthat was one of my favorite days. You were just sitting there with me. Not teaching anything. Not explaining anything. Just there.

That‚Äôs the stuff I‚Äôm gonna remember.

-----

Tomas

-----

At the very end you asked if someone could whistle.

I don‚Äôt know who you were asking. But I don‚Äôt care, I can whistle.

You taught me when I was younger. Took forever. I kept getting frustrated and you kept saying we‚Äôd try again tomorrow.

Eventually I got it.

I still do it sometimes without thinking. Whatever tune you tried teaching me‚ÄîI don‚Äôt know where it came from, but you knew it. So now I know it.

-----

Mira

-----

You were worried about leaving us ‚Äúa book without margin notes.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know what you meant exactly.

But if you meant you didn‚Äôt leave us enough you‚Äôre dead wrong.

The stuff that matters wasn‚Äôt in the notebook. It was in all the small things. The stuff you probably didn‚Äôt even notice you were doing.

That‚Äôs what we have. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôll keep.

-----

Tomas

-----

You wrote ‚ÄúTell Tomas I was proud.‚Äù

I mean‚ÄîI knew. You‚Äôd said it before. Not all the time, but enough.

And even when you didn‚Äôt say it, I could tell. By how you listened when I talked. By how you asked what I thought about things. You treated me like I wasn‚Äôt a dumb kid, or least try forcing us to no be dumb kids.

I appreciate that. Thank you. Why‚Äôd ya have to make me cry like that though?

-----

Together

-----

Dad,

You got some stuff wrong. You weren‚Äôt perfect. We‚Äôre not saying that. But you were there more than you thought you were.

In the lab visits and the bedtime stories and the coffee orders and the beard trims and the afternoons sitting around doing nothing.

In the way you looked at us. In the way you asked questions. In the way you let us see you fall apart.

You said at the end you didn‚Äôt know where the ‚ÄúI‚Äù lives.

We don‚Äôt know either. We‚Äôre not scientists.

But we know where you lived.

In the space between us. In the quiet moments. In the stuff you thought was too small to matter.

You were enough.

We love you.

Not despite the work or the forgetting or the shaking hands or the sentences you couldn‚Äôt finish.

But because all of it was you. And you were our dad. That‚Äôs all we needed.

-----

Mira

I‚Äôm keeping the notebook. Not because it‚Äôs some record of what you lost.

But because every page is you trying to leave us something. Trying to prepare us. Trying to help.

You thought you were writing about failure. But I like to think you were writing about love.

-----

Tomas

I‚Äôm doing that thing you mentioned. Lists and stuff. Anchoring memories.

Not because I think I‚Äôm gonna forget but because you were right. We all need help holding onto things.

-----

Together (again)

If you were worried we wouldn‚Äôt remember you right‚Äî

We will.

We remember the line that shook but taught us something anyway.

The trust when we helped you.

The wrong words that made us laugh.

The songs we sang.

The way you just let us be there with you at the end.

We can whistle, Dad. You taught us how.

I have found out that psych may not be the route for me as there is little progression unless you become a therapist which I do not want to do. I am currently working as a server because I make more than working in psych with less hours. But I am looking for a career that provides me health insurance and job security.

My mother and grandma are both nurses. I have been thinking about nursing for years but haven‚Äôt pulled the trigger. Some days I will be so sure and others I am not.

Some people have suggested X-ray, but I think I would get bored and have low job satisfaction. 

I can‚Äôt seem to pull the trigger because I see nurses all over social media saying they hate nursing and that nursing has sucked the life out of them. My mother has worked hard and has had some bad nursing jobs but is now very happy with the opportunity she has now. My grandma is supportive of me going into nursing but explains that she has gotten punched in the face and seen some traumatic things. My mom has told me to be a x-ray tech. 

Other than nursing, I have no idea what I would do. But I need something where I have a steady income and job security. Some other interests of mine are makeup, photography, and I love animals. I can‚Äôt see myself having a job in any of those though. I have thought about starting a business ex: laundry mat, coffee truck, drink shop.

The short answer is **yes, they‚Äôre generally safe**, provided the magnesium isn‚Äôt in direct contact with your drink.

In most cases, the magnesium is part of a **magnesium-aluminum alloy** used for the outer shell or structural frame to reduce weight without compromising durability. The **inner wall**, where your coffee or tea actually sits, is almost always **18/8 (304) stainless steel** or **ceramic-coated**, which is food-safe and stable under heat.

The only real concern would be if a mug used bare magnesium inside the liquid chamber ‚Äî that would be reactive with hot or acidic drinks. Luckily, that‚Äôs extremely rare in reputable brands.

# How to verify a safe build

* Check the materials list for **‚Äú18/8 stainless steel interior‚Äù** or **‚Äúceramic-coated lining.‚Äù**  
* Look for **BPA-free lids** and **food-grade silicone gaskets.**  

If a company doesn‚Äôt clearly specify what touches your drink, that‚Äôs a sign to move on ‚Äî transparency matters more than marketing terms.

# A few practical tips

* Choose a **vacuum-insulated double-wall** design for proper temperature control.  
* **Powder-coated exteriors** handle daily wear better and stay easier to grip.  
* Hand-wash when possible to preserve seals and coatings.  
* Never microwave metal mugs, and avoid using them for carbonated drinks (pressure issues).  

**Bottom line:**  
¬†

Magnesium in the outer structure is perfectly fine and often a smart design choice for lightweight durability. Just make sure the interior is made from **stainless steel or ceramic**, and the lid materials are **BPA-free and easy to clean**. If a listing doesn‚Äôt clearly say that, it‚Äôs not worth the risk ‚Äî there are plenty of well-built mugs that are upfront about their materials.",1,1760926855.0,KeepThisInMind,0,1.0,False

going to be in buenos aires at least a month maybe 2 and was looking for a setup close to what i was lucky to find in lima - A good long term stay hostel that allows discounts on long stays in a good area and a gym that will allow me to pay monthly

For me good location is just somewhere its safe to walk around, maybe good food around, not a big party person but i do like coffee shops and going on dates but happy to get a taxi for dates

for gym just the main ones would be nice, just don't want to lose any progress so it can even be a bit whatever as long as the weights and equipment are there.

im a pretty budget traveler but i can't handle gross bathrooms or super loud areas as unfortunately im a light sleeper. Ideally something below 15 dollars a night would be great, no problem with hostels as i actually prefer them (i do hostel during the week and privacy on weekends or when needed)

any help would be appreciated and if you're feeling charitable and want to tell me the local food spots and maybe a good pool table id happily toast to your honor

**TLDR: Looking for**

**- Pay per month (NO CONTRACT) gym = cheap but has equipment, in walking distance to central areas**

**- Less than 15$ per night hostel (clean and interesting/tasty area)**

I really like the look (pattern and better visibility interior) of the coach material and could certainly use its waterproof characteristics, but I wonder if it will hold up to all the travel, being thrown around trucks, carried to farms, under airplane seats, overhead bins etc.
Would you go with the XPac or Cordura and why?

I spent some time researching the city and put the below itinerary together, but would love to get some locals' input. We're a mixed group of 15 (20s to 30s) who enjoy a good party.

We'll be staying close to The Grackle/Whisler's, so I kept that in mind when planning. Currently:

  
Day 1. - darty at Kitty Cohens, pick up la Barbecue and grill at the house for dinner, then bar hop/live music at Hotel Vegas, White Horse, and Scoot Inn

Day 2. - Possibly brunch at Paperboy East or pick up breakfast from Joe's Bakery. Shuttle to San Marcos river for a tube float - Texas State Tubes or Don's Fish Camp seem cool. Shuttle back, get ready, then head east of 35. Drinks at The Roosevelt Room, dinner at Uchiba, then maybe start at Coconut Club and bar hop our way back home?

Day 3. Try whatever breakfast we didn't grab the previous day/Flat Track or Figure 8 coffee. Shuttle to Lake Travis for a double decker boat from a rental company like Just For Fun or ATX. Have fun on the lake, shuttle back, then currently leaving an open evening as more touring artists announce dates in Austin. Seeing a DJ at Concourse Project, a band at one of your MANY venues, or even just taking a car up to Workhorse/Tigress/Drinkwell would be cool/would influence where we have dinner.

  
Day 4. nurse hangovers and head on home.

  
Let me know if this feels like a decent plan. I actually plan on showing up a bit earlier to check out some more cultural/out of the way spots such as the Blanton, LBJ Library, and dance at the Broken Spoke/Sam's Town Point, so feel free to call out if I may be missing something I definitely should experience.

1ob7uvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1ob7uvm/should_you_drink_diet_soda_on_a_fast/,SHOULD YOU DRINK DIET SODA ON A FAST ?,"This sub will have you thinking that drinking Diet Soda during a prolonged fast completely ruins the benefits of fasting, and that Diet Soda is basically toxic and should be avoided at all costs.

The amount of bro science and misinformation surrounding this topic is wild, and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm making this post. I‚Äôm an experienced faster who‚Äôs done multiple prolonged fasts ‚Äî my longest being 21 days, with my average fasts ranging from 3‚Äì7 days. I‚Äôve done both ‚Äúclean‚Äù fasts (only water and electrolytes) and ‚Äúdirty‚Äù ones (including 0-calorie or 0-caffeine Diet Sodas).

From my personal experience, I‚Äôve noticed almost no difference in the results between clean and dirty fasts. In fact, I sometimes lose slightly more weight when I include Diet Soda because the carbonation suppresses my hunger and gives me a little placebo energy boost that helps me keep going.

Now, that‚Äôs just anecdotal, so let‚Äôs look at what Diet Soda actually is and whether it‚Äôs really bad for you.

Diet Soda is made up of around 99% water. The rest is mostly carbonation, artificial sweeteners (like aspartame, sucralose, or acesulfame potassium), and flavoring. For context the average amount of sweetener in a Diet drink is just slightly bigger than the size of a raindrop These sweeteners contain virtually no calories and don‚Äôt trigger an insulin response in most people, meaning they don‚Äôt ‚Äúbreak‚Äù a fast in any meaningful way when it comes to fat loss or autophagy not to mention the fact LITERAL DIABETICS drink diet soda all the time and it has virtually 0 effect on blood sugar the people

The argument that Diet Soda ruins fasting usually comes from misunderstanding how fasting works. Fasting benefits like fat oxidation, reduced insulin, and improved metabolic health come from the absence of calories ‚Äî not from avoiding certain flavors or ingredients.

If Diet Soda helps you stick to a fast by reducing hunger or cravings, then it‚Äôs arguably helping you more than it‚Äôs hurting. Of course, if you‚Äôre super strict and doing a ‚Äúclean fast‚Äù for things like gut rest, hormone sensitivity, or cellular repair, then sure ‚Äî stick to plain water. But for most people fasting for fat loss, energy reset, or discipline, Diet Soda is a harmless tool that can make the process a lot easier.

At the end of the day, context matters. There‚Äôs no solid evidence showing that Diet Soda cancels out the benefits of fasting. The ‚Äúit ruins everything‚Äù crowd just repeats each other without understanding the science. If it helps you fast longer and stay consistent, that‚Äôs a win.

The whole ‚Äúlong-term health risks‚Äù thing mostly comes from old rat studies where they pumped insane amounts of artificial sweeteners into animals ‚Äî way more than a human could ever drink. Those results don‚Äôt translate to normal human use. When you actually look at modern research and real-world data, Diet Sodas are completely safe in reasonable amounts.

Aspartame, sucralose, and acesulfame potassium ‚Äî the main sweeteners in Diet Sodas ‚Äî have all been tested hundreds of times over decades. Regulatory bodies like the FDA, EFSA (European Food Safety Authority), and WHO have all approved them as safe for human consumption. You‚Äôd have to drink something ridiculous like 15‚Äì20 cans a day for years to even come close to the ‚Äúrisk‚Äù levels used in those early studies.

And here‚Äôs the part no one talks about: you‚Äôre already consuming artificial sweeteners and trace carcinogens in everyday foods ‚Äî even the ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù ones. Things like whole grain toast, coffee, and grilled chicken all contain natural compounds that technically classify as carcinogens under lab conditions. So if we‚Äôre going to panic about Diet Coke, we‚Äôd better be panicking about half the stuff in our kitchen too.

At this point, almost everything in the modern food supply ‚Äî sauces, yogurts, protein bars, even so-called ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù drinks ‚Äî is sweetened or artificially flavored in some way. The idea that Diet Soda is uniquely harmful while people are out here eating processed cereals and ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù protein snacks full of additives makes no sense.

If anything, Diet Soda can actually help people lose weight or manage sugar cravings because it provides the sweetness without the insulin spike or calories. For someone trying to cut sugar, it‚Äôs a useful stepping stone ‚Äî not a health hazard.

Long story short: the ‚ÄúDiet Soda is dangerous‚Äù narrative is mostly fear-mongering. The data doesn‚Äôt back it up. Unless you‚Äôre downing dozens of cans a day, it‚Äôs not going to give you cancer, mess up your gut, or ruin your fast. People love to point fingers at Diet Coke while ignoring that half the foods they eat are chemically more complex.",5,1760926124.0,fasting,16,0.63,False

If Morel held any ill will toward Luke after he suggested breeding and slaughtering her friends, no indication of ire was shown. The pair ate a simple breakfast of oatmeal with nuts, fruit, and coffee. Morel added several spoonfuls of honey to her tumbler of the black ichor, whereas Luke stuck to tried and true black.

The most remarkable thing about the breakfast was Luke learning more about Morel‚Äôs species. Not only were they large, but the square-cube law was displayed in full effect. Because of her size being thrice what Luke‚Äôs was, she ate nearly nine times what he did.

Over the course of only a few minutes, Morel had inhaled several pounds of nuts, fruit, and other snacks. With a rough calculation in his head, Luke estimated that Morel had taken in well over five thousand calories in a single setting.¬†

A feat that would have made Luke look like a glutton. But for her, she happily hummed and kicked her legs while eating, looking like a kid happily having been served a pint of ice cream.

To Luke's dismay, there was no meat on the table or in the fridge for use. The closest approximation was soy bean patties, shaped like burgers, but in no way mimicking the genuine article. The cruel mockery of beef was white, spongy, and smelled like saltwater.

That Morel stocked such things came as no surprise to Luke, following Morel's passionate display the previous evening. Luke would have to either adapt to her food needs or start going to the diner in town for his precious beef fix.

After breakfast, the day rolled on. First on the docket was Morel showing Luke the feeding process for her little rabbits. It was an amazing display of training and care. Luke did not know what was possible for rabbits.

They had stepped out into the cool morning air, the shimmering dawn welcoming them. Dew glistened in the sun's gaze. Birds chirped and flittered across the sky. A gemstone example of the majesty of the Tobacco Root Range.

For a brief moment, as they stepped out onto the porch, it was as if all of Terra‚Äîno, all of the Sol system was still asleep, leaving only them to witness this splendor.

Morel wore similar practical clothes to those she had worn yesterday, tight jeans, and a bright blue button-up that still could not contain her bountiful bosom; the buttons screamed as they herculeanly held back the floodgates of her chest.

Luke, on the other hand, looked as if a thrift shop exploded on him. He wore shorts that extended down to his shins and a t-shirt that had halfway fallen off his body.

As he assumed the massive garments were more like a dress. The fluttering tapestry offered him little in the way of warmth. He shivered slightly throughout the explanation of the rabbit‚Äôs morning routine.

They walked around the fencing near the house, ensuring there was no damage to the border. Morel explained she was doing so because there had been animals breaking in and trying to eat her bunnies. The interloper had yet to succeed at devouring her friends, but she also had yet to catch the animal for relocation.

As she showed him the cage traps that had been failing her, Luke knew her plans' shortcomings at a glance. The trap was way too small to snare anything larger than a mouse. Especially if that fox who looked longingly at the rabbit cages the previous evening was the culprit. Even if that little omen of ill tidings was not the perpetrator, getting a larger cage would help.

He noted that in his mind, it was another tool to buy for the farm.

Once the perimeter was secured, Morel opened the cage for the rabbits. Each little fuzz ball was already seated in a neat line for her to release them upon the front yard. With a turn of a key and the creak of hinges, the small balls of deadly cuteness were released upon the mortal coil.

The half dozen rabbits swarmed Morel. She knelt to meet their jubilation. They jumped and patted her thighs. Each begged with small chirps to be the next one that Morel swept up in her arms.

The tall alien woman snuggled up to each rabbit in no particular order. She would set one down, say the next one's name in soft utterances of love and care, asking if they slept well before picking them up.

Morel spoke to each as if it were a person, with its own personality, hopes, and dreams.

It did not take long for the rabbits to notice Luke, but they gave him a wide berth as he placed food in each of their bowls, piling Timothy grass in each named bowl. The swarm of ravenous bunnies quickly attacked the bright pastel bowls, gorging on their breakfast like locusts.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, they will get used to you,‚Äù Morel assured, resting her large hand on Luke‚Äôs shoulder, both watching the rabbits devour the grass.

‚ÄúIf they do, they do,‚Äù Luke shrugged.

‚ÄúWell, I think you will love Button,‚Äù Morel said.

‚ÄúWhy is that?‚Äù Luke raised a brow, scanning the rabbits to identify Button based on the bowls, but couldn't make out the names past their fuzzy rumps.

‚ÄúHe reminds me of you,‚Äù Morel said, gesturing to a white and black rabbit at the far end of the line, already having finished his meal.

As the rabbit pattered closer, Luke watched and wondered what exactly about the creature reminded Morel of him. The little beast hopped up beside them. Nuzzled her hoof for a moment, then off he went to the far side of the yard, toward a waiting berry bush; fresh white buds were just beginning to bloom, and held the little creature's full attention.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get it,‚Äù Luke said.

‚ÄúHe is very independent,‚Äù Morel teased, lightly bumping him with her hip in a playful manner, causing him to stumble and start falling to the ground.

Morel's hand shot out and grabbed his flank, keeping him from falling. Her massive frame loomed over him. The light of the morning sun caused a halo to form within her golden hair; heat rolled off her body, causing him to sweat.

A smile grew on her plush lips as Luke began to blush from the proximity. ‚ÄúA lot like someone who has been taking and rereading his notes all morning.‚Äù

Luke‚Äôs face flushed cherry red, and he looked away from Morel, unable to withstand the intensity of her green eyes. But even while averting his eyes, he could still see them, feel them watching him intently, plucking apart every motion he made.

He scrambled away after his heart fluttered, escaping Morel's grasp like she was a burning fire. Warm feelings, like the ones he just kicked away, were not acceptable. He needed to keep his distance from not just Morel, but all women. They were nothing but trouble and would only cause him more heartache.

Morel stood up and chuckled. ‚ÄúAre you alright, sug? If I didn‚Äôt know better, I would think you had just fallen into an ant nest.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine. But can I borrow one of the cars?‚Äù Luke blurted out, trying to find his way out of whatever that situation was growing to be. ‚ÄúI still have to go get stuff for my tests and go pick out some new clothes.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, alright. Lemme finish with the bunnies, and we can go get your stuff,‚Äù Morel said, turning around and starting across the yard to retrieve Button.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Luke said, in an almost commanding tone, one that was far more harsh-sounding than he intended. ‚ÄúI can get all that I need faster without you.‚Äù

Morel looked over her shoulder in confusion, tilting her head. ‚ÄúWhat? But I can pay for that stuff. You are helping me after all.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôd rather just head into town myself,‚Äù Luke replied.

There was a moment of silence in the air. Morel‚Äôs ears drooped slightly as she nodded. ‚ÄúYou can use one of the old worker trucks. Keys are in their lodge, the beater is out back.‚Äù

Luke rushed away from Morel, like he was fleeing a burning building. He clutched at the oversized shorts he was wearing, and did not care that the t-shirt had slipped halfway down his arm, exposing half of his pale chest and back through the neck hole.

He quickly located the keys and the aforementioned truck and drove away from Golden fields and back toward Grey Rock. He looked into the rearview mirror as he crested the hill and saw Morel watching him, a look of bafflement and unease falling over her beautiful, soft features.

He sighed and realized how insane he must have just looked from her point of view. The interaction they just had was friendly, and he ran away from her like she was getting ready to shoot him.

But having such a close relationship was something Luke could not afford, especially rebounding right off a three-year relationship and a betrayal that could still cost him his freedom.¬†

\---

The small bell over the door chimed; the sharp sound pulled the shopkeeper's attention from the television to the disheveled man stumbling in through the door. Sweat rolled off his brow and clung to his short black hair, along with whatever he had that passed for a wardrobe.

But Jose would certainly call none of those rags clothes. A loose shirt in a garish pink, with a faded teddy bear logo, and a pair of shorts that were so long he half thought them to be britches.

The only thing this strange boy was wearing that could even be considered proper clothing was his dress shoes. At least those were proper leather, but clearly not made for the rough life the people in Grey Rock were accustomed to.

The man took in a deep breath, shaking off the horrible midday heat as he looked around the store. Taking the stacks of jeans, workwear, and boots against the walls. He looked up at the cowboy hats and shook his head, seemingly disappointed by the offerings.

‚ÄúWelcome, friend. Can I help yah find anything?‚Äù Jose asked.

‚ÄúYeah, I need some new clothes,‚Äù Luke said, stepping in through the door and finally closing the door, preserving the AC. ‚ÄúFull wardrobe, actually.‚Äù

‚ÄúFull? Like shoes, trousers, and all?‚Äù Jose asked.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù The man said, stepping up and leaning on the counter. ‚ÄúAnd if you don't mind, keep it simple.‚Äù

Jose looked the man up and down, judging him, assessing Luke as little more than a broke vagabond. Jose let out a single huff, making his belief of how broke Luke was known, even before his following words were uttered.

‚ÄúThis shop ain‚Äôt some charity. You can hike to Father Kars, if you need that,‚Äù Jose rolled his eyes and pointed to the door.

In an annoyed response, Luke produced a chit slip and slapped it on the table. The prime, pristine ten-thousand note was worth more than any man's word. That was as much money as most men made within half a year, but this stranger could just toss it about.

That did not mean he was a stranger, odd city-folk displaced, and certainly no vagabond. No, he was a valued customer.

‚ÄúWell, if yah wanna put it that way. Mi casa es su casa,‚Äù Jose smiled gesturing wide. ‚ÄúLet me get you fixed up, my friend.‚Äù

Luke made no argument as the man selected a wardrobe for him. Jose had initially tried to get Luke's opinion on clothes, but found that to be a lost cause. Luke was clearly an academic. A man who cared not for fashion.

All Luke gave credence to was practicality, cost, and durability. Jose was fine with such a customer. His shop specialized in outfitting farmers and their hands. Practical, yet stylish, was the name of the game. Even if Luke did not care about how he looked, Jose would only send customers away looking stylish.

Jose did offer more, fine clothes, suits, and the like. However, his selection was sparse and did not offer the vast array of haberdasheries found on Mars or in more populated areas of Earth; as such, Luke accepted the wardrobe change Jose offered.

Luke tapped his fresh cowboy boots on the deck, adjusting them with each thrap. He stepped out of this fitting room as a new man. Luke strode forth from the room. He was clad in denim and wool.

He wore denim bottoms and a wool top that clung to his lean, muscular body. A massive blank belt buckle shimmered, but would soon be dull. Jose selected plain buckles for Luke, assuming the city-boy would not care for detailed regalia.

The button-up was simple, but it served its purpose, namely making Luke look like half a man, not some patchwork hobo. Luke initially leaned toward white, but was dissuaded from that color once Jose forced grey plaid upon him. Jose insisted that grey would be better, as it shows less dirt, is a thicker material, and was on sale. Luke especially liked that final detail.

To tie it all together, and as a bit of goodwill, Jose gave Luke a good hat. It was not entirely out of goodwill. The black cattleman's cut hat was a rough fit for Luke. Another man had contracted Jose to make it, but the stranger had never returned for it; so the brand-new hat had been hanging behind the counter for nearly a year.

Giving such a fine hat a home was better than it collecting dust. Giving Luke such a gift would hopefully have him return to the shop for future attire.

‚ÄúYou look amazing, mi amigo,‚Äù Jose praised, adjusting the hat so it sat properly atop Luke's head.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bit different,‚Äù Luke said, looking himself up and down in the mirror.

‚ÄúAh, but the ladies will be all over you,‚Äù Jose replied, intertwining his fingers and jokingly fluttering his eyes.

‚ÄúHopefully not,‚Äù Luke shrugged, walking over to the counter, his fresh boots clicking with command on the floor. ‚ÄúSet me up with another ten pairs of tops and bottoms. Oh, and a second set of boots,‚Äù

‚ÄúI can do that, amigo. But you know to break each set, right?‚Äù Jose asked while collecting a few shirts in a variety of colors and pairs of identical jeans.

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm new to this,‚Äù Luke said, gesturing around the store.

Jose did his best not to roll his eyes. That Luke had no idea what he was doing was plain as day. Asking that question was more of a warning to the outsider, not a genuine question.

‚ÄúFair. So, just make sure to wear only one pair of boots for a week or two, let them stretch and mold to your feet. Then start cycling them.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can do that,‚Äù Luke assured, paying for his new clothes.

‚ÄúPerfection,‚Äù Jose smiled. ‚ÄúSo, where to now?‚Äù

‚ÄúI gotta go pick up some kit from the farming store,‚Äù Luke replied. ‚ÄúJust some basic soil testers.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, if you are doing that. I gotta guess you are out of Golden Fields and are‚Ä¶Lucas?.‚Äù Jose asked

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Luke. And what makes you assume that?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a small town, and Hank told everyone about you this morning at the diner. Damn near everyone in town knows who you are.‚Äù Jose replied, gesturing widely around in a grand storyteller action. ‚ÄúThe lone man from a far-off land, coming to aid the local beauty in saving her farm. It‚Äôs like an old western.‚Äù

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt most of those involve gunmen, not academics?‚Äù Luke retorted.

‚ÄúEh, probably, but history likes to rhyme. You might not be a gunman, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you ain‚Äôt just who Morel needs. And if what Hank was rambling about, your eyes certainly were lingering on that tomboyish beauty,‚Äù Jose chuckled, knowing very well how Luke seemed embarrassed by the idea from Hank's story.

1ob7s4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/askcarsales/comments/1ob7s4d/been_thinking_about_going_back/,been thinking about going back,"Hello, 

I have maybe six weeks of car sales experience from a few years ago. My background is mostly food service - bartending and waiting tables in high-volume bars and restaurants. I had been making coffee in the mornings before I walked into a Nissan store on a lark and they hired me. It was an old school kind of place, 4-square, listen to an old timer talk for 8 hours and that‚Äôs your training, etc. A lot of the employees seemed to know each other from high school/family.

Worked there for a little over a month and sold seven cars on a $600/wk training pay. New hires were not typically put on commission, presumably because the store was too slow and people would wash out even faster. I remember the top salesman telling me they were on the training draw for over a year before they made any real commissions. Needless to say, it didn‚Äôt take long to realize the math just wasn‚Äôt there for what I wanted to do. Store did 50-60 total units monthly, and there must have been at least 12 guys on the floor by the time I left. And yet, all things considered, I thought I was doing pretty well for having very few leads and almost zero actual experience. 

I went to a Kia during a lunch break that seemed much busier and told them how I was doing. They said quit the Nissan store and come work for us today. Right now. I wish I could say I took the job and the rest is history, but something stopped me. Even though I was doing well for a newbie, I felt like I was starting to get in over my head. Mainly, I was worried about money, which I had almost none of. My car was basically totaled - I had put off turning it in to the insurance company because then I‚Äôd be out on transportation. It all seemed‚Ä¶risky? So it wasn‚Äôt long before I just went back to the bars/dinner joints.

I think about that time a lot lately. It was not only an opportunity to make real money for an amount of work/hours I‚Äôm already used to fulfilling - it truly felt like it was something I would get really good at doing. And I feel I‚Äôve only gotten older, more responsible, more professional, better at gauging risk/reward. Better even at this crazy world of customer service/hospitality I‚Äôve immersed myself in for most of my adult life. To put it simply, I‚Äôve been thinking more and more about selling cars. 

Does my story suggest I‚Äôd do well in going back? Are there things I should consider, has anything changed since 2023? And etc etc

- if Ray loves us, then why put us in a chat where we can talk to a fine ass actor model, his twin brother, his abuser‚Äôs victim, his abuser‚Äôs other victim, a closeted lesbian coffee connoisseur, and Jumin ‚ÄúPussyslayer‚Äù Han? Why does he give us to his abuser? 

- WTF am I gonna do on Ray‚Äôs route?  I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôll be nice and fun to do during Halloween, right?

- I read some guides. We at 100% on chats and emails, guys! You gonna get therapy this time or else I‚Äôm gonna assume you like that shit and move on

- Pretty sure RFA was Rika‚Äôs practice cult and eventual prop in a defense when she goes to trial for this shit. I tried to guess all her charges and I have kidnapping, assault, attempted murder, fraud, identity theft, numerous cyber crimes, stalking, breaking and entering, theft, embezzlement‚Ä¶. There‚Äôs more regarding the elixir. I guarantee you she was stalking us for months before Ray brings us to her weird ass lair. I know she kidnapped Jumin‚Äôs cat and was involved in the online harassment Zen faces in his route. I‚Äôd also guess that she had a hand in the Glam Choi stuff. It‚Äôs too weird that we see the same house where they find the cat and that Glam Choi tries to scam Jumin‚Äôs dad with forcing Jumin into marriage at the same time. Rika knew he would not want to marry, so she had Ray steal the cat so Jumin would find it and join Mint Eye. Why? Money. I also feel stupid like I should have put this together a while back. I was worried about what was going to happen next üòÇ.

- I wonder if I get to be a villain in Ray‚Äôs route?  He‚Äôs gonna hate me because I never turn on Jumin

- I need a reason to want to do Ray‚Äôs route. As a Jumin Han girl, will I like this unhinged man? Probably. V is fine as hell but he‚Äôs like my bio dad and likes crazy blonde white girls. Plus V needs a lot of help. I have a theory that Rika is schizophrenic because that‚Äôs one of the answers for the neuropsychologist and they tend to invite guests that will help your love interests enemy/rival/opposite. Jumin and Zen are enemies (allegedly) and you can invite an allergy specialist in Jumin‚Äôs route because Zen is allergic to cats. So, since you‚Äôre doing V‚Äôs routes it must be Rika or maybe Ray that is schizophrenic. I‚Äôm probably wrong, but whatever. I think Ray probably has borderline personality disorder due to the abuse from his mom and then Rika. He was crying to me about ice cream and it is really hard to just not join a stupid cult to make him happy. 

- I finally figured out Rika called her cult Mint Eye because of V. He had mint eyes. He took pictures of her, hoping they‚Äôd make her see her as he saw her. But he was overcompensating for his guilt for the way he treated his mother when she was alive. Camera lens‚Ä¶eye‚Ä¶.mint eye. I really want a full back story on this cult and Rika. I stand by she‚Äôs a white girl with Christian or Catholic parents who were missionaries that got killed going to North Korea. I explained that in another post.

1ob7nvs,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ob7nvs/6_months_later_and_i_cant_stop_thinking_about_her/,6 Months later and I can't stop thinking about her.,"Hi, I met this girl last August I'll call her Taylor. This is kind of an ""off my chest"" post and asking for advice for how to get over this girl. I‚Äôve blocked her and deleted our texts, so I‚Äôm going off memory, apologies if I misrepresent anything.

We met on Hinge. I asked her out for coffee, and things actually went somewhere, further than any of my past ‚Äúromantic encounters.‚Äù She was cute, witty, funny, had great music taste, and I could finally talk about stuff like music, movies, and games without feeling weird

  
Things were good but confusing at times. For example, early on my roommate‚Äôs girlfriend invited us to her birthday party I picked up Taylor and we went together but when we got there she acted strange and it was really hard to talk to her (or trying to get her to talk to anyone else). I felt awkward trying to make her comfortable, but later that night when we got food and played Minecraft together, everything felt easy again.

  
Over the next couple months, I‚Äôd buy her coffee, take her out for sushi, hang out at her place watching shows. We were taking it slow, hadn‚Äôt even kissed yet, and one night when I finally worked up the courage to put my arm around her, she got up and sat on the floor a few minutes later. I was embarrassed and confused. Looking back, her whole thing felt like avoidant attachment style.

  
Still, we kept talking constantly, hanging out, doing date-like things, even though she‚Äôd occasionally act distant. Once she invited me to a party at her house and then acted like she didn‚Äôt know me. When I brought it up, she apologized but didn‚Äôt really explain why.

  
Eventually, after like 4-5 months into seeing each other, I try and bring this stuff up with her, I ask her like , Hey can we talk about how things are going? And she wanted to do it over text and already kind assumed what I was going to say. The main thing she said was ""I don't think I could support you in a relationship"". And I never understood what that meant. Like what are we doing right now if we're not in a relationship? At this point I assume she just friend zoned me.

  
Except nothing changed. We still texted, hung out, did the same stuff. It felt like she didn‚Äôt want a relationship but also didn‚Äôt want to lose me. After winter break, I told her I couldn‚Äôt keep doing this and that it was messing with my head.

  
Three months later, my roommate‚Äôs girlfriend told me Taylor had been missing me a lot and it sounded genuine. I‚Äôd been doing fine until then, but that cracked everything open again. I texted Taylor, and she said she‚Äôd been crushing on me when I ended things but didn‚Äôt say anything because she didn‚Äôt want to seem fake. I asked directly if she still felt that way, she said yes, and we started hanging out again that same day.

  
For about a week, things felt hopeful. I tried being more direct, sitting close, hugging her, taking her out again, and it seemed like she was into for a short time too. But she started acting distant sometimes again,  avoiding eye contact, quiet, cold. Then one weekend when I went home, she texted me ‚ÄúBe careful driving back.‚Äù I replied something dumb like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm blasting LCD Soundsystem in the rain,‚Äù and that was it. She never responded. Never talked to me again.

  
I think this is the part that fucks me up. Not that it ended, but that she wanted to get back together, then ghosted me by the next week. It makes me feel like I messed something up. Maybe I was too clingy, too corny, or just not confident enough.

  
I was doing fine most of this summer but recently I just got a new job and moved to a city where I know no one and she's been the only thing on my mind. I found this playlist that she made (I'm 90% sure it was about me) and it's all these songs about missing someone and it really fucked with me. I listened to it too much, I made my own version of it (corny I know) and then when I went back to see some college friends I got way to drunk and texted her. ""Can we be friends again"" and apologized the next morning and said I hoped she was doing well.

  
I‚Äôve always struggled with letting people go. I know this move and isolation are making it worse, but I don‚Äôt really know how to make friends here yet. I just want to stop thinking about her.

  
**TL;DR:** Dated a girl for months who kept me close but never fully let me in. She came back months later saying she missed me, then disappeared again after a week. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about her even though I know I need to move on.",1,1760925547.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Three and a half years ago I met a man who is now 36M on a dating app. He lives an hour away on his family farm. I live in the city in an apartment with my two cats. Long story short he grew up on a small farm, went to college for engineering just like his sister, didn‚Äôt work and racked up $125k in private student loans, got arrested several times and kicked out of his fraternity, changed his major, and dropped out of school to move back to his family farm to help his dad out, he said because his little brother moved away to college and couldn‚Äôt help anymore. Then he worked lower wage jobs part time and eventually full time, he did get an associates in applied science so he could consolidate his loans. He had one girlfriend for six months in college but she cheated on him and he didn‚Äôt date since. And that‚Äôs all the relationship experience he‚Äôs had. 

He has been living in his dad‚Äôs unfinished basement sleeping on a futon and with a sleeping bag since he was like 23. He told me recently how there was a loose snake in his basement for a couple of months, how many crickets he kills in his basement shower, and how his back door is covered in cobwebs. 

He got a DUI at 27. His friends are wild. He used to go drunk driving with his buddies for fun trying to get lost and stopping for beer along the way he told me. He would do dangerous stunts while driving with friends. He almost drove him and his brother off a cliff when he reached to grab his beer that fell, He used to smoke weed every day. 

I think he joined the dating app because he said that all his friends were getting married and having kids and life was passing him by. His profile said looking for friends but open to more. When I met him he worked in a warehouse but a year later became an ironworker. But a year into it almost quit for an easier job with less commute. 

He is supposed to take over his family farm someday but who knows when because his dad has no money to retire. The family farm doesn‚Äôt make any money and the house and property are very neglected and run down. 

When we were dating he didn‚Äôt like to talk on the phone so we would mostly text nightly but it was all surface level and how was your day and dry texting. I asked him for phone calls on the weeks I did not see him and he would call but the conversations were short and he seemed irritated and like he was doing it out of obligation. I would see him I think most weekends but not all. His DUI and past arrests were not disclosed to me until his friend brought it up over a year into our relationship. I felt I had to move the relationship forward and I was never sure he was really into me. He drove my car recklessly by passing three cars in no passing zones on a windy and hilly road at night and lingering in the oncoming lane each time to where I was a bit scared because we couldn‚Äôt really see oncoming traffic. He was smoking weed occasionally at least while in a job that randomly drug tests. When I brought up future plans like kids and retirement and a house he seemed to shut it down, saying we have time for kids and that the farm (that makes no money bc they are expense to run) is his retirement. When I asked how much money he had to contribute to rent he wouldn‚Äôt give an answer and said idk a few hundred I‚Äôll have to check and never got back to me. So I cancelled moving in last year.
  
Any ways three years into our relationship I was dying inside and ended it over text and blocked him. 

Two months later I reached out on advice of my toxic mom and told him that I was ready to talk bc he had said he wanted to but I wasn‚Äôt ready before. He told me it was very disrespectful how I ended it but it‚Äôs a long story why I did it that way, I was going through a lot. I asked if there was any way to rebuild and he said idk maybe it‚Äôll take time and consistency to rebuild trust. And then we started going for coffees and dinners and walks. Two months later I got frustrated and I told him how I really wanted to hold his hand during the movie but didn‚Äôt know if I was allowed to or what was going on. He said it would‚Äôve been okay and he wanted to too but wasn‚Äôt sure what I really wanted. So next time he did hold my hand but then after the movie pulled away. And then he started staying the night again and we started having sex again. But now he does not bring me around his family or friends like he did when we were in a relationship before. I go 2-3 weeks usually between seeing him for one night. He does not call me only texts. He does not call me sweetheart or babe like he used to. He doesn‚Äôt tell me he loves me or compliment me hardly at all, besides telling me I looked nice a few times last spring. 

I haven‚Äôt seen him in 3 weeks and before that it was another 3 weeks. He was busy at his grandpas funeral and then visiting his sister out of state recently. I am feeling very frustrated. I‚Äôm kinda over it because I‚Äôm pissed that people who have been together way less time than us are already married or living together or have kids. We have not had a relationship defining talk yet besides when I said in June that I would like to work towards rebuilding a relationship and he said we can work towards rebuilding and see where it goes. 

I feel very lonely most weekends and weeks and am not sure what the hell is going on, if he considers us exclusive or together or what. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm allowed to date other people but I want to and I want this to be over because I don‚Äôt think he will ever meet my needs.

TLDR Last times I posted about him people said I‚Äôm not in a relationship and am more of a booty call or situationship. I want to talk to other people and I‚Äôm sick of him not meeting my needs. I spend my weekends alone usually. Am I allowed to download a dating app and talk to others? Am I beholden to him? What do I do?",3,1760925458.0,whatdoIdo,15,1.0,False

I (22F) have been working with my company for about 5 years. Two years ago, I moved to a different city and was lucky enough to get a position with the same company here. I‚Äôve grown really close to my coworkers ‚Äî they‚Äôre all older and have always looked out for me since I‚Äôm the youngest on the team.

A few months ago, we had some new hires, and one of them ‚Äî let‚Äôs call him George (22M) ‚Äî joined. Funny thing is, he‚Äôs just two months younger than me. I‚Äôll admit, I didn‚Äôt like him much at first (honestly can‚Äôt even remember why now), but that changed pretty quickly. He‚Äôs incredibly hardworking, sweet, and respectful toward everyone. Since we‚Äôre the only two younger people in the company, we naturally started talking more ‚Äî during breaks, while working, etc.

Fast forward to mid-August: I was about to go on vacation, and everyone at work knew I‚Äôd be gone for a while. George seemed genuinely disappointed that I was leaving. When I was saying my goodbyes, he gave me a really long hug (he‚Äôs super tall, probably like 6'2 so it definitely stood out). He asked for my Instagram, and we started texting after that.

When I was traveling, he kept checking in ‚Äî asking if I landed safely, commenting on my stories, saying he was happy I was having fun. After I came back, I got sick and couldn‚Äôt go to work for a bit, but he kept texting, asking if I was okay, if I needed anything, and even said he missed me.

When I finally returned to work a couple of weeks ago, something surprising happened. I was sitting in my office doing paperwork when George suddenly came in (it‚Äôs a keycard-only room, so not everyone can access it) ‚Äî and he just¬†*hugged me from behind*. I was a little stunned, but he seemed genuinely happy and said he missed me. Later that day, he hugged me again.

Since then, he‚Äôs been extra sweet ‚Äî offering to buy me food from McDonald‚Äôs nearby, holding my hand a little too long when we high-five, and just overall being really kind and attentive. We‚Äôd been talking about meeting up for coffee or lunch, and finally agreed on a weekend.

 He then texted me later in the week around 1am asking if I wanted to hang out earlier instead ‚Äî like during the week*.*¬†He said we could go see a movie, grab some Asian food afterward, and even take photos together in a photo booth.

So now I‚Äôm confused. 

Is this just a friendly gesture, or does it sound like he‚Äôs actually interested in me? I really don‚Äôt want to misread the situation, especially since we work together. I‚Äôd love to hear what you all think ‚Äî is this a crush, or just really close friendship energy?

**Stop 1: Liangzhu Museum**¬†‚Äî The **Liangzhu Museum**¬†isn‚Äôt your typical ‚Äúancient-stuff-in-a-box‚Äù museum ‚Äî mostly because the *box itself*¬†is a masterpiece. Designed by British architect **David Chipperfield**, it looks like four stone rectangles quietly arguing about geometry. The design was inspired by a ‚Äúscattered jade blade,‚Äù which sounds poetic until you realize it‚Äôs also a perfect metaphor for every archaeologist‚Äôs desk.

The building sits between hills and water, wrapped in golden-beige limestone that glows like a sepia filter IRL. Inside, three main galleries take you deep into a civilization that was thriving around 3000 BCE ‚Äî long before most places figured out pottery without it exploding. Expect an overload of jade: ritual axes, masks, and jewelry so perfectly carved that it makes you question human evolution.

¬†Recently they added **AR smart glasses**, which means that the relics don‚Äôt just sit there ‚Äî they *move*. Black-clay pots light up with symbols, birds fly straight out of jade discs, and for a moment you half-expect Indiana Jones to walk by sipping bubble tea.

Speaking of drinks ‚Äî yes, you can **literally drink history**¬†here. The museum caf√© serves a 3D-printed ‚Äúdivine-emblem latte,‚Äù with foam art based on Liangzhu‚Äôs sacred motifs. Take a sip, and you‚Äôve just connected with 5,000 years of caffeine-free ancestors.

Before you leave, check the gift area. The **artifact-shaped popsicles**¬†are absurdly photogenic ‚Äî perfect for that ‚Äúme and my spiritual relic‚Äù selfie.

**Summary:**¬†Half architecture porn, half time machine, fully worth a detour ‚Äî especially if you like your archaeology with Wi-Fi and espresso.

**Stop 2: Archaeological Ruins of Linagzhu City**¬†‚ÄîThe **Park**¬†isn‚Äôt just another ‚Äúheritage site.‚Äù It‚Äôs 14 square kilometers of *actual*¬†lost civilization, complete with palace foundations, royal tombs, and a vibe that screams ‚Äúancient capital but make it chill.‚Äù

You start at the west gate and hop on a quiet shuttle that rolls past rice fields and misty hills ‚Äî and suddenly you‚Äôre not in 2025 anymore. The air feels heavier, quieter, like it remembers things. Archaeologists call it *the birthplace of Chinese civilization*; I call it ‚Äúwhere my phone camera ran out of storage.‚Äù

The park covers everything from the **Mojiao Hill Palace Zone**¬†to the **Fanshan Royal Tombs**, each spot looking like the world‚Äôs most photogenic dig site. The scale alone is insane ‚Äî imagine a prehistoric city with three concentric walls, hydraulic systems, and a god-tier flood defense plan that could probably handle modern climate change better than we do.

Then comes the **VR immersion**¬†‚Äî 35 minutes of cinematic chaos that drops you into Liangzhu‚Äôs golden age. You paddle a bamboo raft, join a sacred ceremony, and watch a flood that swallow the city like a disaster movie directed by historians.

https://preview.redd.it/zprssc26b6wf1.png?width=964&format=png&auto=webp&s=26d4a4f9e32d560ee723a514211b7c2d9e80890c

But don‚Äôt leave yet ‚Äî the best part might be outside the headset. There‚Äôs a **hand-craft zone**¬†where you can string jade-style beads into bracelets (aka wearable archaeology), and yes, there‚Äôs a **deer garden**¬†where actual deer stroll around like unpaid influencers waiting for snacks.

**Stop 3: Pingyao Old Street**¬†‚Äî Think less ‚Äúancient relics,‚Äù more ‚Äúlive-action Pinterest board.‚Äù Handmade umbrellas, clay trinkets, weirdly good fried snacks, and random old dudes singing opera at sunset.

[**Part 1: EATING**](https://www.reddit.com/r/immortalists/comments/1oawkkt/longevity_diet_the_art_and_science_of_eating_and/)  **was covered before, in this Part 2 we are going to talk about WATER FASTING** 

I've being fasting since 2005 and It's one of my favorite ways to keep the healthy relationship with food, practice gratitude and mindful eating.   

Note I haven't mentioned weight loss.   The reason is in my 20 years  I've seen dozens of stories play out and fasting on it's own never worked even once long term.  For that environment,  emotional component and structured eating had to be introduced.   (more in [**Part 1: EATING**](https://www.reddit.com/r/immortalists/comments/1oawkkt/longevity_diet_the_art_and_science_of_eating_and/))

Autophagy is always mentioned, but I yet to see a single study which would show more autophagy compared to the calorie matched diet. 

However there is apoptosis (killing weak cells) and immune reset and gut rest and phycological benefits mentioned above.   
  
So, if you decide to water fast here's some very common fasting mistakes and tips (also available as [**Video Guide**:](https://youtu.be/VaMGp0dLlmo))¬†

**Mistake #1**:¬†**Not having a plan.**  
Long fast is an undertaking, and just jumping into it villi-nilly is a risky proposition. I think about it as climbing mount Everest. You need to prep, acclimatize and think your both ways up and down. Plan meals, plan to avoid gatherings with food. Plan your exercise routine.

**Mistake #2**:¬†**Not doing at least a short keto before the fast.**  
Fasting will be a deep ketosis. It takes time for your body to shift all the enzymatic machinery to burn fat efficiently. Warming it up ahead of time should be a huge help.

**Mistake #3: Not exercising.**  
You might think: oh I'm so tired, I'd better sit and preserve my strength... well the opposite is true. If you sit and do nothing the body starts to burn muscles for sugar. And that's how you loose strength and feel weaker still. Walking and light resistance training gives all the right signal and restore energy.

**Mistake #4: Skimping on electrolytes or flavors.**  
It is nowadays well covered everywhere.. but imagine me in 2005 doing 10 days water fast without any electrolytes... ugh that was a miserable experience. Don't be like me then. Be like Bob, be smart. Use electrolytes, use lemon or a bit of ACV to make water tastier, use tea and black coffee (if you are not doing a full gut rest) - they are great especially the first few days to combat hunger.

**Mistake #5: Eating too much too quickly on exit**  
I actually never did this mistake myself (probably the only one I've avoided:), but I've seen quite a few people who break the fast with a feast. That's a good way to end up in [ER.My](http://ER.My) rule of thumb is for each day in fast to have a day of exit. So 7 days fast means 7 days of breaking it by slowly increasing food amount and density. Starting with diluted bone broth on day 1. And slowly adding liquid fats and fiber.

And now into tips

**Tip #1: Low saturated fat keto**  
Some people based on their¬†*PPARs*¬†genes makeup and some other personal factors do not process saturated fats very well. So avocados, macadamia nuts, almond flour, lots of olive oils, salmon & sardines are all good choices then.

**Tip #2: Burn off glycogen**  
To get to the fasting benefits faster get rid of glycogen stores with some HIT training the first day.(I personally do hill sprints and bike climbs) This is especially important during shorter fasts.

**Tip #3: Staying warm**  
I prefer to fast in May when it's getting warm and the rejuvenation of the nature aligns with autophagy and apoptosis and it feels just right. Plus you can use a simple foot warmer mat during the day and epsom salt foot bath before sleep. (helps with sleep too btw)

**Tip #4: Crystal salt snack**  
I carry around a tiny box of Hawaiian large crystal black salt. Whenever I feel off, or people around are eating - I dissolve a crystal in my mouth - it's a pure bliss. (Sometimes crunching ice might be fun too)

**Tip #5: Ride the keto out**  
A lot of fasting benefits come from low ketone-glucose index (GKI). You can extend this window by upkeeping keto diet while slowly breaking the fast. This also helps with overeating a lot.

Every fast is different. It's important to listen to your body and stop if you are feeling too bad or too stressed. (some Ashwagandha might be a good idea when re-feeding)  
**It is better to come back later and try again than burn off.**

It was a great time, we were known for being attached at the hip and all day we‚Äôd be dead laughing together. I had some other less close friends that I talked to and would hang out with every once in a while though, but not much. But the connection we had during that time is something I‚Äôve only felt once, never been so in tune with someone else before. Genuinely like twin flames or whatever.

We went to two different colleges, a lot because we both knew we needed to branch out more. Like we said that if we went to the same one, we‚Äôd never talk to anyone new. But while she adjusted well at her university, I really didn‚Äôt. I had put a lot of pressure on myself and had a hard time bonding with anyone else. I feel like i kind of accidentally put on a fake personality that was hard to keep up. I felt very alone because although i had made some friends, i was more like a class friend or a second best to these people‚Äôs real friend groups. I spent holidays and weekends alone for the most part, but would do things every now and again with others. It wasn‚Äôt terrible, but it just wasn‚Äôt the same. It was hard coming up with things to say and i never laughed with anyone. 

I ended up transferring universities for a couple reasons, and one upside was the idea of a fresh start where maybe i could make some real friends. It started out well, i had become better at accepting myself for who i am and being much more authentic in my conversations with people. I told myself that good friendships take time and i need to be patient and real and not have any expectations. But here i am totally alone again. A girl i had been talking to in a class, we started meeting up on the weekends and havjng fairly good conversations, well she just stopped being friendly and waiting for me after class one day. A girl in another class who i had become friends with asked if i wanted to get coffee with her, i was happy for that but then i just felt like after the fact that it wasn‚Äôt really fun and I don‚Äôt see her ever asking again. 

I‚Äôve been talking to my new roommates a LOT and getting to know them a lot better, but they all of course do their own things and although we‚Äôre friendly it‚Äôs not like any sort of best friends connection. 

I just don‚Äôt know. Maybe I was so used to having a best friend in high school and now not having one im struggling. But I see people having a good time and laughing with others, going out together, being young and dumb, and i just can‚Äôt help but wonder why I can‚Äôt have that? Why haven‚Äôt I laughed with a friend since I graduated highschool? Why can‚Äôt I connect with anyone on a deeper level than just being a nice class friend or a good roommate?

I don't know that this isn't necessarily the best place to be posting this but I'm stuck as to what other subs to post this in so l'll try here.

Basically a month or so ago my boyfriend was kicked out of his home because he was caught smoking weed while doing some work on his farm at home (from the physical pain of being overworked by his parents). (he was 18 at the time and it's legal here in Canada), when he was kicked out he was given 20 minutes to pack a small backpack & his truck (which is in his name thank god) ever since then he's been living with me, my family‚Äôs been a absolute godsend in this all, giving us any money we need to get him started from scratch, not letting us pay rent & even going as far as helping him get a new job, a SIN & a new birth certificate! (His dad was his former employer so he lost his job when they kicked him out)

Everything's been fine except for the fact his family has been bombarding him with emails, messaging me & mutual friends they have with my parents on Facebook.  They have even gone as far as finding my address and leaving notes on his windshield, his sister made the drive down & begged him to come back home IRL when she was home from school on break, and a wellness check was called on us in an attempt to get him home. My boyfriend has already communicated MULTIPLE times through multiple different channels that he just needs space rn and that hasn't been respected whatsoever. Including in an email we sent to them last night. 

This morning his mother took it upon herself to message my dad on Facebook and ask him and my mom to go to coffee to ""thank them for housing my boyfriend"" however based on her repeated behavior of not respecting our wishes and going to extremes I am very afraid of her possibly revealing the fact that I was pregnant back in march/April to my family durning coffee as another attempt to try and drive him back home. 

The pregnancy was really rough on me, I was constantly sick (throwing up once an hour for a month straight, I was pretty much bedridden and unable to work) so my boyfriend started to prioritize taking care of me & cutting some classes. The abortion was EXTREMELY hard on us both and because of that my boyfriend ended up missing a lot of school, his mother eventually found out about the amount of absences and he had to come clean to explain why he had missed so much of school. (It was his senior year so it‚Äôs not like he was skipping college/uni classes that were being paid for) However this WAS NOT the reason he was kicked out, it was just the weed.

Only a few know that I had an abortion (I was 9 weeks along when I had it, found out about the pregnancy at like 7 weeks).  it's not like my family is anti abortion or anything it's just scary as fuck to tell them as I have no clue what their reaction could actually be. (It‚Äôs very different when it actually happens to someone you know vs a stranger you know?) We don't know how far his mother is willing to go to try and get him to come back (like I said earlier she‚Äôs already called the cops on us once after receiving confirmation from me that he was safe, okay & just not wanting to talk to his family at the moment). 

I didn‚Äôt tell my family when I found out I was pregnant because I was more worried about actually surviving it. I didn‚Äôt know what their reactions would be like and with the pregnancy being as hard as it was on me I couldn‚Äôt physically handle it if they didn‚Äôt take it well. I could barely handle the pregnancy physically as is & a negative reaction from my family would have just made it far worse. I had always planned on telling them further into the future but not within the first year of it happening. I feel like my hand is forced to tell my family about my pregnancy before she can ruin that opportunity for me to do so.

She‚Äôs already told his sister and other family members about it when she initially kicked him out so it‚Äôs not that far out of the realm of possibilities for her to take it upon herself and tell my family too. I just really need advice on the best way to tell my parents that I hid having an abortion from them? 

My only fear is that my parents won't take my word anymore about him smoking weed being the only reason he was kicked out. I really don‚Äôt want this to affect our current living situation as my boyfriend is thriving here and making a life for himself again after his parents took that away from him already once. We won't be kicked out or anything but it could definitely affect the great relationship that my boyfriend is forming with my family.

UC leaders now say AI could erase a lot of those first rungs within a decade. Shocking? Not if you‚Äôve been watching automation slide into HR, support, marketing and junior dev roles like a silent intern that never needs coffee.

Here's the brutal truth for founders, indie hackers, and consultants who still believe talent will magically appear: the conveyor belt that once spat out eager juniors is getting rerouted into a query to an LLM. That‚Äôs good for short‚Äëterm efficiency, terrible for long‚Äëterm bench strength.

Why this matters beyond broken internship programs:
- Pipelines die. Remove entry roles and you starve mid‚Äëlevel and senior roles later. Recruiting becomes a scavenger hunt. 
- Quality drops. Juniors are cheap QA, context carriers, and curiosity engines. A model can generate output; humans catch what models don‚Äôt.
- Culture erodes. Onboarding rituals create shared lore. Bots don‚Äôt attend all‚Äëhands.

Practical, not preachy, moves you can make right now:
- Design junior roles around ‚Äúhuman‚Äëin‚Äëthe‚Äëloop‚Äù tasks ‚Äî verification, context‚Äësynthesis, client liaison. Make tools serve humans, not replace them. 
- Offer micro‚Äëapprenticeships: 3‚Äì6 month paid rotations focused on deliverables, not CV polish. They‚Äôre cheaper than talent ads and build DNA.
- Measure what matters: error rates, customer friction, knowledge transfer. Don‚Äôt get seduced by headcount savings alone.
- Hire for curiosity and domain weirdness. If someone knows the obscure use case your product serves, teach them product craft, not theory.

Yes, some roles will vanish. Yes, some new ones will appear. The sarcastic take: maybe in 2035 we‚Äôll all be C‚ÄëSuite ‚ÄúAI Orchestrators‚Äù sipping kombucha while models ship features. The useful take: founders who preserve learning pathways win. If your startup replaces every junior with a model, don‚Äôt be surprised when you have no one left to scale the company when the model needs context.

So, r/startups: are you building apprenticeship rails or an AI grindhouse? Share concrete ways you‚Äôre keeping juniors useful (and paid).",1,1760924601.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False

*‚ÄúIf you choose to learn only one lesson, choose the lesson of the Batract‚Äîhow they failed. How they brought their subjects, and with them humanity, to the point where rebellion became a matter of survival, not freedom.*

*Were it not for the fact that the Batract caused the Aligned Worlds to form, their fate would have ensured they faded into history‚Äîwithout even a footnote remaining.‚Äù*

Excerpt from: **The Aligned Worlds the enemy at our gates, Galactic Federation 23 P.I.**

¬†

The ship shook. For a fraction of a second, artificial gravity failed, then everything returned to normal.

‚ÄúSituation report.‚Äù Captain Carmichel climbed back onto his chair. Karrn reached out a hand, helping Admiral Browner to his feet.

‚ÄúThe *Hyperion* force exited transit less than half an AU in front of the oncoming fleet. The fleet is completely gone‚Äîdistance fifteen light-minutes. Sir, I‚Äôm detecting massive disturbances in the local spacetime field at that location. Something‚Äôs happening there.‚Äù The sensor tech narrowed his eyes, focusing on the readouts. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just not sure what. We‚Äôve never seen anything like this.‚Äù

‚ÄúAdmiral, the captains of the *Renown*, *Mirage*, and *Trafalgar* all want to evacuate their ships and repeat the maneuver on Tango Alpha.‚Äù

‚ÄúNegative. It wouldn‚Äôt work a second time anyway.‚Äù Browner shook his head. *Marjan, what have you done‚Ä¶*

‚ÄúCorrect, Admiral. The fleet marked as Tango Alpha is already splitting up. Even if they don‚Äôt have our sensors, no one in this sector could miss what happened,‚Äù Lyra reported.

‚ÄúCaptain, the shuttle with the surviving senior officers of *Hyperion* requests permission to dock. The other shuttles have already docked at the tenders.‚Äù

‚ÄúBring them in. Admiral?‚Äù Carmichel turned to the visibly shaken Admiral Browner. Karrn understood‚ÄîCaptain Karimi had been part of his pack. Every leader would be hurt. Her sacrifice was great. It deserved to be honored.

‚ÄúYeah. Good. Tell the tenders to head for Earth after they take on as many colonists as possible.‚Äù

Karrn returned to the CIC to review the tactical situation. After the ripple event caused by Captain Karimi‚Äôs sacrifice, some officers there still looked shaken. The shockwave had hit the fleet without warning.

At the situation table, updates flowed in. The second fleet‚Äîonly discovered a day ago‚Äîwas gone. Its appearance had caused great distress among the crews; no one had been sure they could hold the system against one fleet, much less against two.

The tenders had departed. From the thirty tenders, only ten remained; the rest had stocked the fleet and the colony to the brim, freeing up internal space for refugees. No matter what happened, at least a hundred thousand colonists would survive.

The system map showed the extent to which the humans had fortified the region‚Äîmore than five thousand hidden firing positions on asteroids and small moons. One of the *Pioneer* ships had deployed endless streams of mines and suicide drones. Their numbers were in the millions.

Karrn was amazed by the *Pioneers*‚Äîships built solely for fabrication and field resource production. Davies had explained that the *Pioneers* could establish a fully functional, autonomous supply base within days. They had been in the process of doing so when the 1st Expeditionary detected the enemy fleets.

The human technology was primitive, even compared to his people‚Äôs, but they used it in such creative ways that Karrn had to admit‚Äîhe was impressed.

While going over the distribution of the drone swarms, he noticed a new scent‚Äîmultiple new scents‚Äîcoming through the open door to the bridge. His ears flicked. Some sort of alteration was taking place.

Entering the bridge, he saw a human female he hadn‚Äôt met before. The patch on her uniform provided an explanation: *Hyperion.* Her rank matched that of Chief Ferguson, so she was probably *Hyperion‚Äôs* chief engineer. Her hair was a light color‚Äî*blond,* as the humans called it‚Äîand he could smell waves of grief coming from her.

In a pouch across her chest, he saw tiny heads of some sort of mammals observing the bridge with wide eyes and wonder.

‚ÄúMarjan‚Ä¶ Admiral, tell me she didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù Her fists clenched around the fabric of the Admiral‚Äôs uniform, shaking him slightly as she cried.

The Admiral softly laid a hand on her shoulder, whispering something in her ear‚Äîtoo quiet for Karrn to understand from the other side of the room.

The sensor tech called out that something was happening at the center of the ripple just as a bright light appeared where Captain Karimi had sacrificed herself. It looked as if a new star had been born.

The woman sat down on the stairs facing the screen, holding one of the small furry mammals in her arms and whispering, ‚ÄúLook‚Ä¶ mommy has become a star.‚Äù Tears ran down her cheeks.

The Admiral came over to Karrn, entering the CIC and closing the door behind him. The other officers kept their attention on their work‚Äîthough everyone was clearly listening.

He cleared his throat. ‚ÄúIt seems Chief Andrejewa was hit especially hard by the events of the last hour. If I hear any speculation or rumor regarding her professionalism, the person responsible will be promoted to Chief of Biomatter Cleaning. Am I clear?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes Sir‚Äù came back in unison. Karrn flicked his ear in amusement about the Admirals threat.

‚ÄúSimmons?‚Äù Karrn was now sure of it‚Äîthe airman had a way of materializing out of thin air. He hadn‚Äôt noticed him in the CIC for the last fifteen minutes while studying the tactical situation.

‚ÄúOrganize quarters for Chief Andrejewa. She seems to have adopted infants of this new species mentioned in the *Hyperion* logs.‚Äù

‚ÄúGliders, sir. Already done. I arranged a single quarter to give those cute little furballs some peace and quiet.‚Äù

Karrn saw Simmons smile for the first time since he‚Äôd known him. Humans seemed to like little furry animals for some reason. But they were cute‚Äîhe had to admit that much.

Captain Carmichel entered the CIC. Through the open door, Karrn saw Lieutenant Davies sling her arm around the female chief and escort her off the bridge, nodding to Captain Gerber, who had just stepped out of the elevator.

Carmichel informed the Admiral that the enemy fleet was about fifteen minutes out, then went to get some coffee. Karrn was sure that this bitter brew was the essence keeping the human navy running‚Äîthe more stressful the situation, the more humans seemed to consume of it.

Just as Carmichel returned to his post, Captain Gerber entered the room and looked toward the Admiral. ‚ÄúWas that Chief Andrejewa on the bridge?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. She seemed to take the loss of her captain especially hard. Davies is escorting her to a quarter.‚Äù

Gerber didn‚Äôt seem to understand at first. Then his eyes lit up. ‚ÄúAh.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt question her professionalism,‚Äù Karrn added helpfully, ‚Äúor you‚Äôll get promoted.‚Äù

The next ten minutes the officers and staff went trough the tactical situation again, Void Hunter Fruug coordinated with the Shraphen Veyr.

In simulations, it all came down to two scenarios. Either the Batract would make a run straight for the colony, trying to wipe out both fleets in one overwhelming strike‚Äîas the humans had done in their initial assault‚Äîor they would hold back. For that first case, the humans had placed mines and drone swarms throughout the system. Even now, hidden autominers and fabrication units on asteroids were producing thousands of small, self-coordinating swarm drones every hour.

The second possibility was that the Batract would wait on the edges of the system, launching torpedo salvos and captured asteroids at them‚Äîforcing the fleet to engage rather than defend.

Everyone hoped for the first alternative. The assumption was that the mines and drones could take out large parts of the enemy fleet, and human ships were especially skilled in close-quarters combat.

Long-distance combat remained their weakness, since their engines were far behind Batract capabilities.

So even though they hoped for the first, everyone was certain the second alternative would come true.

In any case, their chances were slim, so for Karrn it didn‚Äôt really matter.

The Admiral‚Äôs voice cut through Karrn‚Äôs train of thought. ‚ÄúLyra, can Garry provide us with a more detailed analysis of the weapons that hit *Hyperion*?‚Äù

*‚ÄúGarry is‚Ä¶ unavailable at the moment. His‚Ä¶ his code isn‚Äôt fully compatible with Argos systems. But I can access the data and send it to the tactical overview.‚Äù*

Karrn looked puzzled at Gerber. The captain‚Äôs expression confirmed his suspicion‚ÄîLyra had lied.

‚ÄúStatus change‚Äîenemy fleet Tango Alpha has left transit.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd so it begins. Activate the drone swarms‚Äîset them to surveillance only. Inform the fleet to go to Status Red.‚Äù

The lights across the bridge dimmed to red. Every crewman began suiting up in a lightweight space suit equipped with a small oxygen tank and an umbilical cord that could attach to any console for external air and power support.

Karrn didn‚Äôt like it‚Äîit dulled his most important sense‚Äîbut he understood. As soon as everyone in the CIC signaled ready, the air was pumped out of the room. *Smart. There wouldn‚Äôt be fire on a ship without air.*

The room was now absolut silent, since no noises can be transfered without air.

Admiral Browner now stood at the tactical overview beside the holo screen.

Karrn could see it for himself‚Äîthe enemy was encircling the system. Ship clusters of sixty-eight vessels each accelerated toward different points along the borders of the solar system.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre waiting us out. Fuck. Can‚Äôt we ever have a stupid enemy?‚Äù Came over the intercom.

The dots symbolizing the smaller enemy groups burned fast toward their destinations‚Äîsome at thirty-four Gs, an acceleration unattainable even for Shraphen ships. He had never even heard of vessels accelerating that fast. *They‚Äôre cutting us off. We can‚Äôt even transit out without getting intercepted.*

‚ÄúCategorizing enemy squads as Tango One through Tango Fifteen. Tango One is relatively stationary and appears to be catching asteroids for bombardment. Tangos Two through Six have turned around and are now braking toward their suspected target locations.‚Äù

Karrn followed the information from the sensor tech. He was, once again, impressed by human ingenuity. Since there were no FTL sensors, the *Pioneers* had constructed countless spy satellites positioned throughout the system, each equipped with magazines of micro‚ÄìFTL-capable message torpedoes.

The fleet now had a delayed view of the system with data only minutes old‚Äîinstead of the usual days, weeks, or even months, depending on distance. Solar systems were massive, and space battles consisted mostly of long stretches of positioning and hiding, punctuated by short bursts of massive devastation.

‚ÄúAt the moment, the Batract have a massive advantage. They can maneuver‚Äîwe can‚Äôt, since we have to protect the planet and the colony.‚Äù The Admiral went through the situation again. Fruug had told him humans called it *rubber duck debugging*‚Äîa method where explaining a problem aloud often led to new insight.

Karrn liked the idea, but he didn‚Äôt understand what rubber ducks had to do with it. And what were ducks?

‚ÄúWe have to assume they don‚Äôt have FTL sensors, and no FTL communication. Anything on the sensors that could confirm our assumptions?‚Äù

‚ÄúSeems like it, sir. Tango One just launched what looks like FTL-capable spy drones‚Äîno need for that if you have FTL sensors,‚Äù the sensor station reported.

‚ÄúSo they still have to map the system. Nice. If we can take out a few ships now, we might get an advantage.‚Äù

‚ÄúTactical ‚Äî anything about the target locations of Tango Two through Tango Six? I need a firing solution as soon as possible.‚Äù

‚ÄúOn it, sir. They‚Äôre breaking harder than what our programs are used to. I‚Äôll have to rewrite code for it to work.‚Äù

‚ÄúLyra, get on it. We need to pull these ships into our killing zone as soon as possible.‚Äù

*‚ÄúYes, sir. Starting to work on it now.‚Äù* Lyra‚Äôs voice responded; she still sounded irritated somehow ‚Äî perhaps because there was another VI in her systems.

‚ÄúTango One is moving again. It seems they‚Äôve found the second asteroid belt at six AU distance‚Äîstill outside the killing zone. Acceleration: sixty-four G.‚Äù

‚ÄúJesus Christ, sixty-four G! What are those ships made of?‚Äù Admiral Browner was visibly shocked‚Äîand not without reason. As Karrn knew, Veyr ships could manage fifteen G, but that was the limit of their internal mass dampeners; human ships peaked at five G.

If the humans won this battle, it wouldn‚Äôt be by sheer power but by wisdom and intelligence.

Looking at the situation on the holo display, Karrn could see the tiny dots representing the enemy drones. He hated the situation‚Äîthe waiting. He was a hunter, used to planets: you sought out the enemy and attacked. But here they were, scheming, probing, waiting‚Ä¶

‚ÄúFleet reports hull reconfiguration complete, sir.‚Äù

Karrn must have had a puzzled look on his face, because Gerber began to explain.

‚ÄúThe outer hull is laced with nano-diamonds. They can be adapted to different wavelengths of lasers. Shraphen shields dampen energy weapons; our hull adaptation almost completely negates them.‚Äù

Karrn was genuinely impressed. Looking at the view screens that displayed the feeds from the *googly eyes*‚Äîthe short-range drones providing constant visible, infrared, and night-vision coverage of each human ship‚Äîhe noticed how the fleet‚Äôs hulls had shifted in color. Impressive.

Karrn noticed Fruug taking notes, he assumed the Veyr will soon adapt this technology. They had already a Shraphen version of googly eyes.

‚ÄúYup. But you can‚Äôt adapt to kinetic damage‚Äîa nuke in the face always hurts.‚Äù Gerber seemed to glee at the thought of wiping out the Batract fleet, and after seeing *Hyperion‚Äôs* video report, Karrn shared his feelings.

‚Äú*Mirage* is reporting incoming fire‚Äîexpected wavelength, constant stream in the gigawatt range.‚Äù

‚ÄúConstant stream? Wow. Our point defense can churn out petawatts, but only in microsecond bursts. Their heat management must be advanced.‚Äù Chief Ferguson went over the numbers.

‚ÄúTell *Mirage* to feint damage and veer off. Get me a firing solution and fire a ladder salvo‚Äîfifty-fifty shotgun, all ranges.‚Äù

Now Fruug provided the explanation for Gerber and Karrn. ‚ÄúThey shoot at and around the known position of the target, since it might have moved‚Äîtimed so every shot from every ship arrives simultaneously. Half of the rounds detonate into shrapnel. It‚Äôs quite effective; it almost instantly took out our fleet.‚Äù

The last words carried a bitter tone. Karrn flicked his ears and replied, ‚ÄúThey broke us too, in less than a day. Don‚Äôt be ashamed.‚Äù

‚ÄúTime to target: eighteen minutes,‚Äù came the call from Fire Control.

‚ÄúFire at will,‚Äù the Admiral answered.

Even without air, Karrn could *feel* the sound of the massive railgun at the center of the ship charging‚Äîthe low rumble of meter-tall capacitors vibrating as they drew power. Then the *Argos* fired. Five seconds later, another shot followed.

Karrn couldn‚Äôt hide his admiration for the human engineers. He had assumed their technology was primitive, but their railgun had fired continuously for a full minute‚Äîtwenty projectiles in that time‚Äîbefore recharging was needed. The energies involved must have been massive.

The metal under his feet vibrated again, and he couldn‚Äôt believe the scene he was watching. One of the tenders was parked behind the flight wing of five ships, *Argos* among them, and was launching projectiles at them. The rounds were caught by magnetic fields and fed into an opening at the back of each ship.

Karrn stood beside Fruug at the screen, his mouth slightly open in shock at the sight.

Ferguson just said, ‚ÄúReloading. It‚Äôs a spectacle when you see it the first time.‚Äù He grinned. ‚ÄúIn training, we managed to reliably resupply up to an AU between tender and ship.‚Äù

Karrn didn‚Äôt say anything. He just thought, *Sure‚Äîlet‚Äôs reload our ships by firing at them. What could possibly go wrong? They‚Äôre all mad. Geniuses, but mad.*

The scene was somewhat surreal. There was *Mirage*, venting steam and atmosphere to simulate damage, veering off to starboard. On the screen, he saw hundreds of projectiles racing toward the enemy‚Äîenough firepower to split a moon in two‚Äîand part of the crew casually went to get coffee.

‚ÄúNot what you‚Äôd expect, right, Pack Leader?‚Äù The Admiral walked over to him, casually holding a vacuum-sealed cup with a straw in his hand.

‚ÄúNo, Admiral. Not what I‚Äôm used to.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôll get more stressful, trust me. Space battles usually have two phases‚Äîlong-distance and then close-quarters combat. That‚Äôs where the fun starts.‚Äù

Karrn‚Äôs tail twitched, which was somewhat uncomfortable, since the human oversized space suit he wore had no space for his tail‚Äîthrowing off his balance even more.

‚ÄúStatus change! Tango One has opened fire on the entire fleet with lasers. Launch of torpedoes and rocks detected‚Äîmegaton range. ETA for torpedo volleys: sixteen minutes. Rocks in thirty-two.‚Äù

That announcement sent the crew scrambling back to their stations.

Karrn already knew what humans meant by *rocks.* The Batract were throwing asteroids at them‚Äîslow-moving, but hard to destroy, and capable of hiding deadly surprises. *Megaton* referred to the estimated mass of the asteroids.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs play stupid little humans,‚Äù the Admiral barked. ‚ÄúFire nuclear torpedoes at the rocks‚Äîtime the flashes with a railgun salvo!‚Äù

He was using the blinding bursts of the nuclear explosions to mask the firing signatures of the main guns. *Devious.*

Then he saw that the first volley of human railgun fire was about to hit.

‚ÄúImpact in three‚Ä¶ two‚Ä¶ one‚Ä¶ zero. No hit, I repeat, no hit. Slight damage through shrapnel‚Äîno kill.‚Äù

Karrn clenched his fist. The enemy evaded them.

‚ÄúSir, at that distance, the enemy‚Äôs extreme acceleration allows them to dodge the shots.‚Äù Lyra‚Äôs analysis was exact‚Äîbut devastating.

Admiral Browner turned back to the tactical display. ‚ÄúThen they‚Äôll keep throwing rocks at us until one hits‚Äîor until they get reinforcements.‚Äù

Since I could hold a paintbrush, I was making art. I was always alone as a child, some would call me strange, weird, eccentric, the words people use when someone is just strange. I was alright with the thought of being strange. Now, as an adult, I‚Äôm still strange. I paint the things I hear in my head. Voices that speak to me in the background of my head. I use the medium of acrylics, pastels, and canvas to show what they say, what they see, what they look like. People tend to call my art ‚Äúcontemporary‚Äù or ‚Äúunusual‚Äù when I show it. It‚Äôs true, to the normal person it does look a bit intriguing, but to a true artist, it tells a story.¬†¬†

I sit in my art studio working on a new piece, I call it ‚ÄúGhostly beauty‚Äù a bit on the nose, but it‚Äôs a work in progress. The painting depicts a frail, pale woman, sitting on a bench in a field of daisies. I‚Äôm halfway done with the painting, but I‚Äôm stuck on her face. I haven‚Äôt heard a description of her face yet. I don‚Äôt want to paint a face they won‚Äôt like. So, I work on making the daisies as detailed as possible. I hear a knock on my door. I set my things neatly onto my counter.

‚ÄúComing!‚Äù I yelled. As I check the peep hole, I notice a chipper young woman standing outside my door.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWho is that?‚Äù a voice whispered in a low growl.¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, let‚Äôs find out together.‚Äù¬†

I opened the door and saw who was there. A woman, probably a year or two younger than me stands in front of me, holding a small, yellow purse in the shape of a daisy. She wore a long denim dress and had her brown hair in a messy bun. A wide, chipper smile was along her round face, her round red glasses complemented her hazel eyes.¬†¬†

‚ÄúPretty...‚Äù a shy womans voice said.¬†

‚ÄúI know‚Äù I mumbled.¬†

‚ÄúHi! I‚Äôm Dahlia! The Abraham Cohen Foundation sent me to come and view some of the pieces from your portfolio before the showing next week. Do you mind if I come in?‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúToo loud...‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúSo beautiful...‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúDON‚ÄôT LET HER IN‚Äù¬†

I shook her hand. My head pounds with an uproar of voices. Majority of them didn‚Äôt like visitors, but the ones that did like them didn‚Äôt want to let them go.¬†

‚ÄúWelcome in. I can show you the studio. Sorry if it‚Äôs a bit messy.‚Äù She came in, her boots making echoing click sounds in my home.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWow, your home is so clean! I wish I could be this tidy‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúShe talks to much...‚Äù 	¬†

‚ÄúI wish I had her eyes...‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúGET HER OUT!‚Äù¬†

I itched my head as the pounding hurt even more.¬†

‚ÄúI try to keep it clean. My passion is messy so I might as well keep my life as tidy as I can‚Äù. We walked into my studio, and she began looking at all my work. The walls of my studio are lined with finished paintings, sketches, half done paintings, and she closely viewed all of them.¬†¬†

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs too close...‚Äù a man‚Äôs voice whispered.¬†¬†

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs fine‚Äù I mumbled. She was very close to my paintings. A lot closer than most people. She walked to another painting across the room to a stack of canvases leaning against the wall; she sifted through some and pointed out a larger piece.¬†

‚ÄúCan I pull this one out?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúSure, let me help‚Äù¬†

As I held back the canvases, she revealed a painting I wish she had never noticed. She pulled it out and put it onto an easel.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this one called? It‚Äôs incredible! I don‚Äôt know why you didn‚Äôt submit this one.‚Äù she asked as her eyes darted across the painting, studying every inch of it. The painting showed a man in the lower center of the canvas, kneeling towards a throne. The throne was raised on a pile of rotting corpses, each in a different state of decay. Floating above the throne is a humanlike figure, but with wings stretched wide, showing the bat-like skin and large demonic size. His limbs are long and are held high above his head, wielding a scepter. His legs are slender and look like birds' legs. His face...His face is that of a fly, eyes large, red, and bulging from his head, long tendrils coming from his mouth, as if he is about to consume the man kneeling before him. Whether in praise or in fear. A wave of dread, disgust and nausea come over me in waves. A high pitch ringing in my ears becomes shattered by the sound of all the voices yelling at me in unison.¬†¬†

‚ÄúNO! She can‚Äôt know!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs private!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúLIE!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúMake her leave!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs so pretty...‚Äù¬†

I paused and stared at the painting. The voices haven't been this loud since the making of it. They wouldn‚Äôt let me destroy it. I must tell her. She asked.¬†¬†

‚ÄúBa‚Äôal Zabub‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs such a detailed piece, the way the different red tones really complement the dark blues of the bodies. And the way you painted this demon figure is just. Wow. I‚Äôm at a loss for words.‚Äù¬†

She looks at me, smiling, as if she's waiting for me to agree or go on a tangent about the different meanings of everything in the piece.¬†¬†

‚ÄúI agree. It took me a long time to get this done.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI would love to have this show cased. I feel like this would really shine in the gallery. Would you be okay with that?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúNO!‚Äù 		 ‚ÄúPlease don't hurt her...‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù¬†¬†¬†¬† 	¬†¬† ‚ÄúSHOW THEM!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúShow the world our Master....‚Äù¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

‚ÄúYES, SHOW THEM‚Äù 			‚ÄúNo!¬†

All yelling at once. The spot behind my eyes searing in pain, like a million needles are stabbing into my brain from the inside.¬†¬†

‚ÄúYes! Yes...sorry for yelling yes. We can add it.‚Äù¬†

Complete silence. Not from Dahlia, but from the voices. They weren't mumbling, they weren't growling, nothing. They all just shut up.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWonderful! Just bring it to the gallery on Thursday evening so you can show the boss man and his partners this new addition.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúGot it.‚Äù¬†

We walked back to the front door. As she was about to leave, she turned to me and said, ‚ÄúYou know, a lot of the stuff you showed me could‚Äôve been entered, you‚Äôre a really good artist.‚Äù I smiled ‚ÄúThank you. I tend to stay private with my art but I had a good feeling about this foundation so, I don‚Äôt know, guess I had a change of heart.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúCRINGE‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt lie to her‚Äù			‚ÄúWE told you to enter‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúLIAR‚Äù		‚ÄúNO‚Äù¬†

I shook my head and my eye started twitching. As Dahlia left, I thought about what the voices said. They weren‚Äôt wrong, they did tell me to enter my art here. After I got that strange email invitation they basically were screaming and begging me to email back. I did think it was weird that a Church also had an art gallery and contacted me specifically. Why were the voices so compelled to enter here, any other time I tried showing off my art they always and a million reasons why I shouldn‚Äôt enter. These thoughts rack my brain. I go back to the painting of the woman. I began to repaint her hair a shining brown, with a round face, and a pair of round red glasses.¬†¬†

I follow the directions on my GPS leading me to Abraham Fellowship Church, either the Abraham stands for the one in the bible or this guy had a huge ego problem. I pulled down the street to see a huge compound, smaller white brick buildings surrounding a huge white church, like something you‚Äôd see in Rome. The front had a giant stain glass window of Jesus floating above his disciples, underneath that was a large wooden door. I was told the gallery was to be held in one of the smaller buildings, still huge but relatively small compared to the monolith of a church. As I begin to unload my portfolio from my trunk, the voices seem to stop chattering, they‚Äôve been unusually quite all day, besides the occasional yell to hit someone with my car, one talking about Dalia, and another telling me not to go altogether. It was strange how silent they were when I pulled in, as if they didn‚Äôt want someone else to hear them. Maybe it‚Äôs cause I‚Äôm at a church. I haven‚Äôt been to one in years, a decade maybe. And whenever I would go as a child, or what I could remember from then, is them being silent. I haven‚Äôt exactly figured out what their boundaries are, and I don't really care, because they never cared about mine.¬†¬†

‚ÄúHello, are you Samael?‚Äù A man‚Äôs voice said behind me. I jumped back and dropped my bag.¬†

‚ÄúShit! Hey, yeah that‚Äôs me. Sorry about that, you scared me‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúOh, my bad about that. My names David McCormick, I‚Äôm head of our arts department here at the Church, Abraham sent me to guide you to the building, won‚Äôt want you to get lost.‚Äù He said with a chuckle. His voice had an old timey southern twang to it. He was pudgier, taller man, with a mid-length graying beard with matching greying black hair. He wore a black button-up shirt with a clerical collar, dark blue jeans, timberlands, and had skinny wire framed glasses on. He looked very jolly, if that's the right word to use, like unsettlingly happy.¬†¬†

‚ÄúThank you, I‚Äôve never been here before.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWell welcome! This here church has grown into what it is now over many, many years. Generations and generations of the same four families built this place to what it is today. A place of community, love and worship. That‚Äôs why we decided to open but the gallery, hoping to bring in more people to talk about their love of art and hopefully soon, their love of the Lord.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhat families brought this place up? I‚Äôve lived her my whole life and I‚Äôve never noticed this.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWell, my own of course, the Cohens, the Simons, and the Soloman's. Ever since the Pilgrams came here, they settled and brought the Lord with them.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs interesting.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYes, our history is very interesting. But don‚Äôt worry, there won‚Äôt be a quiz later‚Äù Again he chuckled.¬†¬†

We came up to the gallery building. Another big white brick building, but above the door was a sign reading the name ‚ÄúDavid McCormick Art Gallery‚Äù. We entered the building, and a gust of cold air came over me. I shivered enough for David to speak.¬†

‚ÄúWe keep it cold, so the humidity doesn‚Äôt damage any of the paintings, we have a lot of different mediums in here, so I thought this was best.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúMakes sense.‚Äù¬†

The room had a huge floor plan, with walls spaced out in the center of it to add more space for art. Some walls were already decorated with paintings, charcoal sketches, photographs, all with religious depictions and animals. We walk to a side door labeled ‚ÄúStaff only‚Äù and walk inside. A whole group of people were making small talk, some with their portfolio bags still, some with coffee, and some just sitting at the giant table in the middle of the room. I see Dahlia standing in the corner talking to someone who is probably another artist, wearing a black blouse with a large sparkly broach in the shape of a cardinal, with a mid-length blue skirt. Hair still in a bun, glasses still round and red.¬†¬†

‚ÄúPretty...‚Äù¬†¬†

I hear a voice whisper in the back of my head, and I swear after the voice said that one of the men in a typical priest outfit looked at me, with his eyebrows furrowing after making eye contact with me. Maybe he was trying to figure out who I was, or something like that. An older man at the end of the table rises from his chair and gestures towards me.¬†¬†

‚ÄúAh, our final guest has arrived. Everyone welcome Samael LeFlore, one of our highlighted artists of the event‚Äù¬†

Jeez this guy looked creepy. He was tall and thin. He had greasy black hair that went past his ears, he wore a black cassock with a rosary around his neck. One of his eyes was severally glazed over, almost grey, while the other was a bright blue. He smiled with crooked grey teeth. Some scattered whispers arose from the crowd around me. I hated it. I hated all the eyes on me.¬†¬†

‚ÄúNow that we‚Äôre all acquainting with each other, I would love to take a moment and acknowledge the two people who made this all possible, David McCormick and his niece Dahlia Bennett‚Äù¬†

Applause erupted in the small room, over the noise, the voices rose¬†

‚ÄúNIECE? WHAT THE SHIT!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like it here‚Äù 													‚ÄúLEAVE LEAVE LEAVE ‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúDahlia...‚Äù 		¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ‚ÄúTOO LOUD‚Äù¬†

My head pounded, my eyes hurt like someone was stabbing them from the inside. I closed my eyes as tight as I could and also screamed for them to shut up. As the clapping stopped, so did the voices, they quieted down and I stood awkwardly and slowly opened my eyes. Dahlia was standing next to me.¬†¬†

‚ÄúHey, are you alright?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYeah, I just get headaches sometimes.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAlright, just making sure. Wouldn‚Äôt want you feeling bad on the first day.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúFirst day?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYeah, did no one tell you? This is not only an art show, but a artist retreat! Isn‚Äôt that fun?‚Äù¬†

What. A retreat? With art nerds and Jesus freaks? For a whole week?¬†¬†

‚ÄúNo, no one told me this was a multi-day experience.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúOh shoot. That should've been in the email. Well its only three days, then on the third its the art show.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt pack clothes or anything.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fine, you can always borrow some from the chapel, they have a donation bin.‚Äù¬†

She placed her hand on my shoulder, she knew I wasn‚Äôt all that excited to stay here for multiple days. Her hand was warm and made me feel this strange fuzzy feeling.¬†

‚ÄúEW HER HAND‚Äù 	¬†

‚ÄúWarm...‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúGET HER AWAY‚Äù¬†

I took her hand off my shoulder, it was soft. She looked pretty today. No, no I shouldn't be thinking these things. Her uncle was one of the people who ran this place, who knows what could happen to me if I started pursuing that.¬†

‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs nice. I guess I could stay for the retreat.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWonderful! Oh, that makes me so happy‚Äù She smiled at me and walked around to some of the other artists in the room. Everyone in the room began to sit down at the table in the center of the room. I sat in-between a women older than me, possibly in her early 40s. She looked like she was a funeral director. Then on the other side of me was a man around the same age as me, in full scene attire. Spikey hair and all. The woman scowled toward me when I sat down, and the man offered a sleeveless gloved hand to me.¬†

‚ÄúHey, my names Zeke, you‚Äôre pretty popular tonight.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYeah, I wasn‚Äôt expecting that kind of welcome.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWell, from what I‚Äôve heard, you have one of the main art pieces of the gallery. I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I am a little jealous they picked you over mine.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúMine? Huh, didn‚Äôt know that. But what was your piece?‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúIt was my spin on the famous painting ‚ÄòThe Creation of Adam‚Äô, where instead of it being realistic and two men, it‚Äôs two women and it's made up of a bunch of different mediums. I can show you after the presentation if you want.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThat sounds cool.‚Äù Zeke seemed like a cool guy, who knows, maybe I can make some friends out of this experience. Looking around the table there are about seven other people who are artists. Dahlia was there sitting next to her uncle at the front of the table. Another, younger man, was sitting across from her, he was the priest guy who stared at me earlier, and at the end of the table closest to the screen was Abraham. He clapped his hands together to get our attention before speaking again.¬†¬†

‚ÄúI know you are all very excited about this opportunity to be here with many talented artists and clergymen to become closer to faith, and better your skills. Now as some of you know this is a four-day retreat ending in the opening of the gallery. We all just want you to bond and grow with each other, and the spirit of the Lord. So, we will have rooms for everyone, the women in one wing and the men in the other. Some of our staff will escort you and give you the itinerary for the following days. Now, you are free to explore after that but be sure to be in the dining hall for dinner and our nightly sermon. Thank you all, Amen‚Äù¬†

Mumbled ‚ÄòAmens‚Äô came from the group, some saying it more confidently than others. As we all rose from the table, more clergymen and women entered the room. I guess they have housing on property.¬†¬†

‚ÄúHello, I‚Äôm Douglas, I‚Äôll take you to your housing quarters and help you get settled in. These people will take your portfolios if you haven‚Äôt given them already. Follow me.‚Äù¬†

Another man came up to me to take my paintings, including the newest addition, as he grabbed the bag he looked at me with this look in his eyes of fear, like I did something wrong.¬†

‚ÄúBe careful with them please, I had to repack them in a hurry.‚Äù¬†
‚ÄúI will, sir.‚Äù As he scurried away, out of the corner of my eye I saw Abraham twirling his rosary, staring at me with his cold, blind eyes.¬†¬†",1,1760924389.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

Fake names used for privacy. (Lexi) 15F and (Rose) 15F. I‚Äôve known Rose for 10 years and we are best friends till this day. I‚Äôve known Lexi for 6 years and still best friends. Last year we started high school (Grade 9) and within the second month of school Rose got a boyfriend. I didn‚Äôt care too much in the beginning but it started to eat away at me overtime. For example : She would choose him over me constantly when we had planned to either study or just hang out at lunchtime, make me feel like a massive third wheel and just shut me out and take longer to reply to me than before. Lexi went to a different high school that year so I was kind of lonely but of course I had other peers but not any other ‚Äúgood friends‚Äù. But just last week Lexi was accepted to transfer to my and Roses high	school for this year (Grade 10) and I was ecstatic because even though I didn‚Äôt know her for as long we just were closer and connected better.

Lexi‚Äôs first day we went out to a coffee shop for lunch like we had planned to if she was accepted and of course Rose and her boyfriend came because we are all in a friend group. Since Rose had her boyfriend, I clung to Lexi more because well it‚Äôs been a year since we‚Äôve had lunch together and I was just overall excited she got into my school. Then, Rose kept glaring at me like as if I was doing something wrong even though her and her boyfriend weren‚Äôt really talking to me nor Lexi so we were having separate conversations and then Rose says ‚ÄúWhy are you guys not including me into your conversation?‚Äù I was taken aback but replied by saying ‚ÄúMaybe because you‚Äôve left me to third wheel for a year and now that my best friend is here you‚Äôre mad because I‚Äôm talking to her and not you?‚Äù 

I told Rose that Lexi and I were leaving because I had a math test to study for but in reality I couldn‚Äôt stand the sight of Rose and her boyfriend being touchy touchy when I‚Äôve had to deal with it for a year. Enough was enough I thought I just needed to tell her how I felt and then the next day she apologized saying she didn‚Äôt realize how much I was hurting. It‚Äôs hard to watch your best friend move on and get a boyfriend while you‚Äôre stuck in a rut and can‚Äôt seem to do the same. I‚Äôm sure other people have experienced being a third wheel and it sucks! But for me this was just something that was built up and bottled up inside and I finally unscrewed the cap. I‚Äôm glad I told her how I felt but she‚Äôs still mad at me for not talking to her as much on Lexi‚Äôs first day. I was just so happy I had my other best friend with me now at my school. Should I feel guilty? AITAH?

‚ÄúBut hey, at least you beat the commies, right?‚Äù Louis said, handing his friend another beer.

Ivan laughed heartily as he shook his head, an awkward smile on his face. He leaned forward to grab the can. That sense of humor missed the mark way more often than it didn‚Äôt, but that laugh was definitely one he needed that early on a Sunday.

‚ÄúI guess I did, didn‚Äôt I?‚Äù he said with a shy smile. Louis dug back inside the portable cooler and produced a second beer, this time for himself. Raising his can like a young freedom fighter celebrating the end of the war at some musty frontier tavern, he proclaimed:

‚ÄúA toast. To my favorite unsung hero of democracy.‚Äù

Ivan raised his can back at him, nodding once with feigned reverence. He cracked it open, loud and messy, and Louis followed suit. The foamy taste of victory was followed by two long gulps from each. Weather-chilled cans of Huxley before twelve o‚Äôclock; truly, the breakfast of champions.

That morning so far had been a load off his back, he decided. Weather was warmer for the first time since the end of summer, and it was a good change of pace from the usual gray, chilly afternoons he and Louis would spend with their hands in their jacket pockets, trying their hardest to enjoy their weekly meet-up by the time winter was already on its way back.

The two were sitting on their usual lawn chairs, with their backs toward the house as they faced the lake. Anabelle was inside cooking her signature bland pasta dish for the monthly parents and teachers association meeting in just a few hours, and had basically locked the boys outside to prevent them from ruining everything by pretending to help. It was a morning too good to be wasted by trying to pretend you‚Äôre useful, the two had agreed anyway, and they were glad to be outside enjoying their choice brand of cheap beer. The air was usually way fresher in Lou and Belle‚Äôs little hideaway, especially in mornings like those, which was one of the reasons Ivan enjoyed saving the date. The other, as his tired smile denounced, was his best friend‚Äôs company.

They were quiet for a short while, listening to the sounds of nature and staring at the shades of autumn beyond the opposite lakeshore. Louis had the habit of keeping conversation in good spirits whenever he could tell his friend had gone through a rough week, which was sorely frequent, but he knew how to keep a few moments of quiet introspection in between their usual banter for good measure.

‚ÄúI just wish having beat Ilya‚Äôs people would‚Äôve paid for my renovations, at least.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey‚Äù, said Louis, pointing a loose finger at him. ‚ÄúYou got a *medal.‚Äù*

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want medals, I want new roofing.‚Äù

‚ÄúDismantling a coup d‚Äôet√°t will only get you medals. You want a new house, help them win one next time.‚Äù

Ivan smiled and shook his head, once again. He was easy to annoy, but strangely enough he was never bothered by his friend‚Äôs casual humor about the duress he was under during the days of the civil war. In a sense, he knew that was the best way to rationalize it. If nothing else, it was pretty much the only one left. Old Lou was just yanking his chain, sure, but deep inside he did feel this stoic sense of accomplishment from his service.

‚ÄúMedals are okay, I guess‚Äù, Ivan mumbled. ‚ÄúExcept you can‚Äôt eat them. Believe me, I tried.‚Äù

Lou snorted. Ivan liked to crack jokes about it, but his friend knew better. For unremarkable working class people such as Ivan, or at least as he always saw himself, having the chance of being part of history was as big of a deal as a long-lasting marriage, or raising healthy children. Except in a strange, collective sense, which he never quite knew how to put into words. It‚Äôs not like he ever saw the need to, considering how much of a good job the eggheads at the Praetorian Front propaganda division had done in his place, mostly so he could focus on the shooting.

‚ÄúSometimes I wonder if they shouldn‚Äôt have won‚Äù, he said in a somber, almost deadpan tone.

Looking enviably comfortable in his seat compared to Ivan‚Äôs trademark stiffness, Louis just side-eyed his friend with skepticism as he catched that sentence in the middle of a particularly long swig.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing to ‚Äòwonder‚Äô here, comrade‚Äù, he said finally, sounding like the sort of expert in speculative history any man in his forties becomes after his third beer before noon. ‚ÄúIt would be *exactly* the same.‚Äù

Ivan didn‚Äôt laugh. He wasn‚Äôt sure if that was one of Lou‚Äôs jokes or not.

‚ÄúExcept we‚Äôd probably still be at the munitions factory‚Äù, Louis quickly added. ‚ÄúFueling local conflicts until compulsory retirement. And our boss would be Kravchenko‚Äôs drunken nephew or something.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean we‚Äôd have dodged Karlsson as our taskmaster?‚Äù Ivan asked, this time unable to contain a smile.

‚ÄúHis stingy ass would be put to the firing squad. In front of the whole contingent, to boost morale.‚Äù

Ivan didn‚Äôt resist and let out a hearty, sincere laughter.

‚ÄúIf they ever did that I would‚Äôve walked into that assembly line every single morning with my hand on my chest, singing *‚ÄòO men of valor, from to the marshlands to the sea, gift your mother, Old Preatoria, one last glimpse of her children free‚Äô‚Äù*, Ivan chanted, straightening his back and widening his shoulders, closed fist over his chest, his voice mimicking the baritone of the old socialist hymns of their youth. Louis cackled like a teenager trying to signal how much he just understood some adult‚Äôs dirty joke at the dinner table.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let the neighbours hear you, I don‚Äôt wanna get arrested.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no one in half a mile.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, but shut up anyway.‚Äù

Snatching a heartfelt laugh out of the class clown felt good for a change, but it didn‚Äôt last. He knew Louis was right. It might‚Äôve been just a throwaway joke about how their old enemy would have been their boss while their actual old boss would‚Äôve been dead, but there was nothing funny about how things did end up. Ivan wanted to believe that having lost to the sworn enemies of the republic would‚Äôve been ten times worse, but he knew better. He *did* wonder, sometimes, if they shouldn‚Äôt have won.

Staring into the distance, he felt the sounds of nature now seeming disorienting, cluttered over one another. An aggressive mass of noise that surrounded him like the pressure of the sea during a deep dive. He felt the freshness of the outdoors slowly melting into a sense of danger, the sort one shouldn‚Äôt be able to find within civilization, but at the same time felt like what civilization had become in its essence.

His thoughts were swooped in half by the ominous sight of a large raven flying by, the dense blackness of its shape massive and jarring against the brightness of daylight. Ivan could feel his mind drifting back into the sinkhole from which he struggled daily to rope it out, sometimes to no avail. Suddenly, it wasn‚Äôt such a beautiful morning anymore.

‚ÄúI lost the appeal‚Äù, he could hear his voice say as he stared into nothing.

Louis froze for a second, his eyes widening as he turned his head like a startled prey.

‚ÄúYou *what?‚Äù*

‚ÄúYou heard me.‚Äù

‚ÄúSay you‚Äôre joking.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wish.‚Äù

He sat in silence for a few seconds, looking away, pretending he did not intend to go into detail. But the cards were already on the table. He had laid them himself.

‚ÄúJudge says the Committee is in their right to deny me any further prescriptions, as well as consultation‚Äù, he continued, trying to mask his denial. ‚ÄúApparently my case was filed under the bill that took the brunt of the budget cuts, so it falls under the new regulations.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait, you mean the public health one?‚Äù Louis asked, genuinely puzzled. ‚ÄúBut I thought the treatment program for veterans was under the Reparations Act.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, me too, but as it turns out they filed my case *outside* of the program to make it easier for them to screw me over first chance they got, and now they have it‚Äù, Ivan spat out. He could feel the cynicism building up inside him. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs *that* for reparations?‚Äù

Louis had a sour taste in his mouth. That court appeal was possibly Ivan‚Äôs last chance of sustaining his injuries without having to pay for the medication. Gone in the stroke of a pen.

‚ÄúBut what about the army‚Ä¶?‚Äù he asked Ivan, running out of ideas.

‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt do shit. It‚Äôs not their money.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is ridiculous, they should be putting a motion in your favor or something, you‚Äôre *their guy.‚Äù*

Ivan laughed. And then he laughed some more. His laugh sounded and looked how most animals must perceive a spitting cobra defending itself.

‚Äú‚ÄòA motion.‚Äô‚Äù

He crushed the empty can on his hand and hurled it inside the trash bag. Leaning over the cooler to fish for another one, he just looked Louis square in the eye and said:

‚ÄúBe for fucking real, Lou. Those assholes want me *gone.‚Äù*

Leaning back, he cracked it open and continued:

‚ÄúI made them look like a bunch of clowns. Not like they needed any help with that, anyway.‚Äù

Down the hatch. Even needing to approach that subject made him thirsty. Louis, on the other hand, was starting to consider going back into the house and asking Belle if she had already thrown out the morning coffee.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a war hero, for fuck‚Äôs sake‚Äù was all he could say. The stink eye Ivan directed at him made his mind drift once again toward reptiles and venom glands.

‚ÄúWhat the hell do you think this is?‚Äù Ivan asked, gripping his beer can like the armrest of a tyrant‚Äôs throne. ‚ÄúSome mushy dandyboy afternoon flick like those you‚Äôd take Belle to pretend to watch? Like a hundred years ago, when we were all dumb kids and someone still had any hope for this shithole?‚Äù

Louis said nothing. He just stared at his friend with genuine concern. Maybe a slight hint of frustration, but that was it.

‚ÄúThere are no war heroes, pal‚Äù Ivan continued, already setting his sights back into the distance. ‚ÄúJust disabled morons like me, who can‚Äôt even apply for a day job without having their pensions revoked. And then having it revoked anyway, because the government we bled for decided we are dead weight.‚Äù

It rattled inside his ears like the cackling of boiling oil, of the fire that consumes. The quiet alienation of hearing your own voice and thinking it‚Äôs someone else speaking through you.

‚Äú‚ÄòWar hero‚Äô. What a riot‚Äù, he continued, the anger slowly giving place to the usual brand of cynicism. ‚ÄúYou need to stop watching that foreign propaganda they clutter daytime television with and maybe go for a stroll downtown during business hours. See for yourself how us ‚Äòwar heroes‚Äô are doing.‚Äù

To Louis, that man sitting on a lawn chair a few feet away, downing a lukewarm can of Huxley while half pretending to enjoy a sunny afternoon, was a complete stranger. He was, for all intents and purposes, his best friend. But at that moment, Ivan looked less like himself than he looked like a nightmare about someone he hoped he‚Äôd never become.

‚ÄúYeah, fuck it‚Äù, Ivan said finally, sensing his friend‚Äôs discomfort. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not even mad at any of this. Not anymore, at least.‚Äù

His voice was a searing monotone at this point, unfazed and bled dry. Louis had known him for a lifetime worth of bad times, it wasn‚Äôt hard to tell when he had something bottled up for a while. As it was, it may as well have spilled by accident.

‚ÄúOkay, but how did‚Äì How did *any* of this even‚Äì‚Äù, Louis tried to articulate, desperate to say something. He just took a deep breath and settled for a simple *‚ÄúWhen?‚Äù*

‚ÄúLast time I was there. Last week or so‚Äù, Ivan said, still not looking back at him, trying his best to look dismissive. So far, it hadn‚Äôt been his best effort.

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you tell me?‚Äù

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt want you losing sleep over it, I guess‚Äù, he said, still looking away, hinting at a half-hearted shrug. That did sound sincere, Louis had decided.

The stretches of silence between the short exchanges were starting to appear longer than they actually were. Not only to his deeply concerned friend, but to Ivan as well.

‚ÄúBesides, what‚Äôs the point?‚Äù, he continued. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs done.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou should have told me, Ivan‚Äù, he replied, more frustrated than worried.

‚ÄúYeah, I guess I should‚Äôve‚Äù, Ivan agreed, starting to sound almost bored. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like there was anything you could‚Äôve done, though. So‚Ä¶ Yeah.‚Äù

Louis couldn‚Äôt do much at that moment besides getting a long, hard look at his best friend‚Äôs approach to rock bottom. Ivan wasn‚Äôt going to return the look. He wished he was anywhere else.

‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs next?‚Äù he finally asked Ivan, his gaze drifting away.

‚ÄúApparently I need to get some papers signed so I can reapply for the treatment‚Äù, Ivan explained. He didn‚Äôt sound hopeful about the prospect by any visible stretch.

‚ÄúCan you actually do that after being denied a second time?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot really‚Äù, he said. ‚ÄúAt least not officially, from what I reckon. I dunno. I guess we‚Äôll see.‚Äù

Ivan didn‚Äôt let on nearly as much as he should, but dealing with the pains of his injury was a daily struggle he couldn‚Äôt bear the brunt of on his own. Louis could see just how dire the news were, but at that point he was gonna take anything he could get.

‚ÄúAre you going there again?‚Äù he asked Ivan.

‚ÄúYeah. Next Wednesday, on my usual schedule.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre telling me there‚Äôs still a way to make this work.‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess you could put it that way.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd do you *think* it‚Äôs gonna work?‚Äù

Ivan didn‚Äôt answer for what was barely ten seconds, but still felt like almost a minute.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know what I think anymore, to be honest‚Äù, he said finally.

That answer wasn‚Äôt good enough for Louis. The need to say something to make his friend feel better was ringing inside his ears. Desperation was starting to spread between them like blood on water, and he could already feel the murkiness taking hold of his sight.

‚ÄúYou know if you need anything‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI know‚Äù, Ivan said promptly.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just saying, if you need help finding a private clinic‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI got this.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy cousin could help us out.‚Äù

‚ÄúI said I got this. Don‚Äôt worry.‚Äù

He suddenly didn‚Äôt know what else to say. He just kept trying.

‚ÄúLook, all I‚Äôm saying is, if you need anything, anything at all, even if it‚Äôs just someone to talk to‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay Lou, I appreciate it.‚Äù

‚ÄúMe and Belle will always be here for you, I just need you to know that.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know that, and I need you to know that I mean it.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay‚Äù, said Louis. ‚ÄúOkay. Thank you for letting me know.‚Äù

Maybe he had no idea how to respond, but Ivan knew that was enough sitting and moping for a whole weekend. He stood up with a groan and threw out the empty can he had been holding for what seemed like half an hour. As he grabbed two fresh ones, Louis stared back at him and reached for his as if he didn‚Äôt know what it was for.

‚ÄúI really need to stretch my legs for a bit‚Äù, Ivan said as he walked toward the lake. ‚ÄúMy back is about to murder me for the third time today.‚Äù

Louis gazed at his friend marching out as he cracked open a beer. After a few steps, Ivan turned around and just stared back, gesturing toward the lake with a slight tilt of his head. He walked along the coast as if only half expecting his friend to join him. Louis finally stood up, realizing his stiffness wasn‚Äôt that far removed from that of his friend, who at least in his own mind had always been the stiffer of the two.

Catching up with Ivan, he could see how absent-minded he looked, almost as if pretending to be distracted. As he picked up the pace, Louis said:

‚ÄúOkay, but about this whole thing‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat about it?‚Äù, he snapped back. Something in the passive aggressiveness of Ivan‚Äôs tone caught Louis off-guard.

‚ÄúHow are you holding up?‚Äù

‚ÄúAbout as well as you‚Äôd expect‚Äù, Ivan said, walking slightly faster as his friend closed in. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd you want me to say?‚Äù

‚ÄúI want you to be upfront with me.‚Äù

Ivan snickered.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you do, buddy.‚Äù

Louis stood still for a second before saying:

‚ÄúTry me.‚Äù

Ivan came to a halt. He looked at the lake briefly, then at his feet. He then looked his best friend in the eye and let out a dry chuckle as he shook his head.

‚ÄúI swear to God I‚Äôm this close.‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up.‚Äù

‚ÄúSee?‚Äù he said as he immediately turned his back and started walking away.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say that shit to my face‚Äù, Louis protested, pressing on as he did his best to keep up.

‚ÄúI mean it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care. Don‚Äôt say it.‚Äù

Ivan felt his day getting significantly worse after this brief exchange. It dawned on him like a shroud of shame. Opening up was never easy for him, mainly because he had nothing reassuring to show whenever he did. He could feel a sense of regret settling in, the looming feeling that he had ruined his and his best friend‚Äôs only day together by trying to talk about his problems, something he had no one else to help him process.

A few steps ahead, he slowly stopped walking once again and started saying:

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get it. It‚Äôs been tough‚Äù, he said as he slowly stopped walking. ‚ÄúTougher than usual, I mean.‚Äù

His voice sounded almost feeble, something that disturbed Louis in a way he couldn‚Äôt quite place.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been getting worse for a while now, but lately it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm reaching‚Ä¶ I dunno, this whole new stage or something. Like I didn‚Äôt even know it could get this bad.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat the hell are you even talking about, Ivan?‚Äù Louis asked, frustrated with so much vagueness. ‚ÄúIs something going on? Something else, I mean.‚Äù

Ivan thought long and hard before answering.

‚ÄúThe other day‚Äù, he heard his voice letting out. ‚ÄúLike a week ago, or so. I can‚Äôt remember now.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù

‚ÄúI completely lost it. I don‚Äôt know what it was, but I just had this weird bout of insomnia. Some sort of panic attack in the middle of the night. Woke up at three in the morning and couldn‚Äôt go back to sleep.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid the pain wake you up?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. It was something else.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe nightmares, then.‚Äù

Ivan said nothing.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know for sure. I mean, I can‚Äôt remember. Must‚Äôve been that.‚Äù

Louis had a thick coat of skepticism over his expression as he heard that answer.

‚ÄúYou sure it wasn‚Äôt something else?‚Äù

‚ÄúLike what?‚Äù Ivan asked, hinting at a certain annoyance.

‚ÄúLike, I dunno. You‚Äôre the guy who won‚Äôt move out of Weaver Parish Road. You tell me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI already told you there‚Äôs nothing there‚Äù, Ivan replied, insisting on the annoyance. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a bunch of trees, same as anywhere else.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can take you to that real estate agent my cousin told me about, I‚Äôm just sayin‚Äô‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúCan we just *not* have this conversation again?‚Äù Ivan said, visibly frustrated.

‚ÄúYou could get a nice place downtown with the cash. I mean, the house is pretty big, in decent shape, five minute walk from the creek‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúThe house is not even mine, what the fuck are you talking about?‚Äù

‚ÄúBill would be happy to sell it if you found a buyer, just think about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat the hell is this, all of a sudden?‚Äù he asked, walking up to his friend‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to talk about the shit I‚Äôm going through and you wanna peddle that real estate talk again? *Today?* Of all days?‚Äù

‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôm just saying, okay?‚Äù Louis replied, raising his beer can on one side of his face and an open palm on another, looking sideways as he dodged Ivan.

‚ÄúYou live in a dangerous place‚Äù, he continued as he kept walking. ‚ÄúThings are gonna get tougher to keep in check, now that we don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs gonna happen to the treatment and all‚Ä¶ Just some things I guess you should be taking into account.‚Äù

Ivan circled back and got on his face again, this time talking awkwardly close.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm starting to lose my *shit* here, dealing with chronic pains, the fucking nightmares are coming back‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúIvan.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre trying to convince me it‚Äôs the *house* I live in?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the house.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat if I move into some shithole in the crate-piling district it‚Äôs just gonna magically solve everything, am I hearing this right?‚Äù

*‚ÄúIvan.‚Äù*

‚ÄúWhat.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, okay? You‚Äôre right, you‚Äôre going through a lot right now. I get it.‚Äù

Still visibly shaken, he kept staring at Louis in silence.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in a rough spot, and it‚Äôs about to get a lot rougher‚Äù, he continued, tapping his friend on the shoulder and circling around him like he was a stranger he almost bumped into by accident. ‚ÄúWe should focus on that.‚Äù

Louis walked along the lakeshore by himself. The dismissiveness in his body language reminded Ivan of his own before he flipped.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I shit talked your pet spookhouse and the neck of the woods it sits on‚Äù, Louis said over his shoulder, approaching the rocky ground of a bank. ‚ÄúBy all means, keep them.‚Äù

He walked toward the water and sat on an old stump, drinking his beer in silence. Ivan stood still for a while longer. *‚ÄúWhat a fucking asshole‚Äù*, he thought to himself.

As he approached the stump, the familiar instinct to keep dragging pointless arguments whenever you‚Äôre with your best friend had overcome him entirely. He could hear his voice rattling the bars of the cage his mind had become. *‚ÄúYou think I LIKE living in that shithole? That I LIKE those woods?‚Äù* None of it even made it out of his lips, however. There was something else bugging him, by now.

Standing right behind the stump, he fired:

‚ÄúI need to know why you‚Äôre telling me this.‚Äù

Still looking dismissive, Louis took a long swig and rested his elbow on his knee, not looking quite over his shoulder but not straight ahead, either.

‚ÄúBeen hearing some stories‚Äù, he said finally. ‚ÄúStuff that had me worried.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow is this even news?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious, Ivan.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell‚Äù, he shrugged. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm listening.‚Äù

Louis seemed reluctant for a second, but as he started verbalizing it Ivan could tell how much he felt like he needed it.

‚ÄúRemember Juan Carlos?‚Äù he asked Ivan. ‚ÄúFrom the factory days. Used to hang around the bar.‚Äù

‚ÄúJuan?‚Äù Ivan said, a bit surprised by the mention. ‚ÄúYeah, I know which one. Tall guy, dark hair. What about him?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been seeing some weird shit lately.‚Äù

The somber tone in Louis‚Äô voice was a good indication of where that conversation was heading, but it was too late by then. Ivan had to humor it somehow. Unsure of what to say, he just asked:

‚ÄúWeird how?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe saw some people on his property, a few weeks back. He says it‚Äôs them.‚Äù

Ivan frowned at that statement, shaking his head.

‚ÄúHow does he know, though? Did he actually *see* anyone, or‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe did. He says so, at least. Peeked out of his window and there they were, right next to his house.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust standing there?‚Äù

‚ÄúApparently.‚Äù

Ivan shook his head again, raising his hand to his brow. It was clear why Louis had been so quick to jump at the opportunity of hogging him about the property. *‚ÄúNot this again‚Äù*, were his exact thoughts.

‚ÄúSince when do you and him still talk?‚Äù he asked, unsure of any better way to change the subject.

‚ÄúYou know that dive bar I always tell you about? Where me and some of the boys at the company play pool sometimes, after late shifts?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, what about it?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe started showing up a few months back, usually late at night. Apparently he got a job at that new delivery company upstate.‚Äù

Louis couldn‚Äôt help himself from betraying a warm smile.

‚ÄúEven started renting this old sixteen wheeler from his cousin, and all. Says he‚Äôs looking into buying it. Guy‚Äôs gung ho about the whole thing, you should see him.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, sure, but‚Äù, Ivan said, not worried about hiding his impatience. ‚ÄúDid he even say *what* he saw?‚Äù

Louis was silent for a moment. That was enough of an answer for Ivan to pick up from where he left.

‚ÄúOr is it just the usual ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know what it was, but I know I saw something‚Äô people around here try to peddle when they forget their kitchen door unlocked or whatever?‚Äù

‚ÄúLook man, I‚Äôm just saying what I was told, okay?‚Äù Louis replied, sounding more annoyed than defensive. ‚ÄúYou asked.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid he even go to the cops?‚Äù Ivan pressed on, trying to gauge something out of that story that wasn‚Äôt just hearsay. ‚ÄúOr did he just decide to jump to conclusions?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe did, apparently‚Äù, said Louis, stopping himself before another sip just to add: ‚ÄúGo to the cops, I mean.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd what did they say?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you think? Told him to get in touch with the zoo first.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat a joke‚Äù, Ivan scoffed. ‚ÄúDid they even *go* there?‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you fucking twelve?‚Äù Louis snapped back. ‚ÄúDo you even *know* what cops are allowed to do if there‚Äôs a risk of a sighting?‚Äù

‚ÄúSit down on a chair circle and stroke each other‚Äôs cocks, would be my first guess‚Äù, Ivan answered, unamused.

‚ÄúVery funny, man. Thanks for answering my first question.‚Äù

The two of them were in silence for a few seconds. Ivan stood next to the stump, facing the lake as well. It was obvious to him how frustrated Louis was by his dismissiveness of that particular subject.

‚ÄúCops won‚Äôt go anywhere before getting a memo that confirms containment measures are in place‚Äù, Louis continued, almost to himself. ‚ÄúWhat do you think they‚Äôre gonna do? Shoot the creeps on sight, like they do with humans? Bag ‚Äòem and tag ‚Äòem?‚Äù

Ivan just sighed before Louis was even done talking. For a moment he could feel his mind drift back to the days of political persecution, when investigations were taken seriously and quotas didn‚Äôt take precedence to solid evidence. Ideally, at least.

‚ÄúDo cops even arrest people anymore?‚Äù

Louis just shrugged, drinking as he pretended to enjoy the view instead of overthinking procedures he had no bearing on.

‚ÄúSo did he?‚Äù Ivan asked.

‚ÄúDid he what?‚Äù

‚ÄúCall the zoo.‚Äù

Louis chuckled before drinking some more.

‚ÄúAs if. Fella‚Äôs scared shitless‚Äù, he said finally.

Ivan wasn‚Äôt amused. He was ashamed to realize he had completely forgotten about Juan. They had always lived close by, but his tendency for self-imposed isolation never did his friendships any favors. The two of them were never exactly close, but they did hang out on a number of occasions, back when Louis, Hank and Viktor were always up for a drink or a dozen after they left the assembly line.

Juan Carlos was shy and mild-mannered, but had a way of letting loose whenever he felt he was among friends. Him and Ivan didn‚Äôt have much in common, especially when it came to politics, but they always focused on their few common interests whenever they had a one-on-one. Maybe these interactions hadn‚Äôt been as meaningful to Ivan‚Äôs formative years as the more politically-charged ones, but they were cherished memories nonetheless.

Now, years later, these memories took on a whole new meaning now that he learned skinny old Juan, with his messy head of hair and his dumb smile, was just another middle-aged blue collar worker whose friends had forgotten about. Not only that, but also possibly in danger in a way he didn‚Äôt even fully understand. The irony in how similar all of that sounded to Ivan‚Äôs own situation wasn‚Äôt lost on him, which made it all the more bitter.

‚ÄúI mean‚Äù, he‚Äôd say after a long silence. ‚ÄúCan you even blame the guy?‚Äù

Louis just raised an eyebrow as he stared at him.

‚ÄúFor what?‚Äù he asked finally. ‚ÄúNot trusting the authorities?‚Äù

‚ÄúBetween the cops and containment people, what are these ‚Äòauthorities‚Äô even planning to do for him?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot much‚Äù, Louis scoffed, ‚Äúif he doesn‚Äôt *report* anything.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow is this even safer? What if they decide he‚Äôs part of the problem?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, that‚Äôs a risk‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äú‚ÄòA *risk‚Äô?* They do that every single time.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut if he *did* report what he saw, there‚Äôs at least a non-zero chance that they can actually offer some help.‚Äù

Ivan tried to laugh but it didn‚Äôt come out quite right. He was too angry to be cynical about any of it.

‚ÄúCan you listen to yourself, for a minute? ‚ÄòNon-zero chance‚Äô? The guy‚Äôs a fucking citizen of the country we went to war to protect. He works, he pays taxes. ‚ÄòNon-zero‚Äô is not gonna cut it.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, *comrade‚Äù*, said Louis, starting to sound like the grumpier of the two. ‚ÄúSo what *is* he supposed to do? Just sit at home with his drapes closed until the scary people go loiter somewhere else?‚Äù

‚ÄúStop acting like the issue here is me not coming up with solutions for the imaginary problems your bougie ass keeps inventing in your free time.‚Äù

This time it was Louis who laughed, and it came out just as smoothly. It was like the barrel of cynicism Ivan carried around everywhere had toppled over and spilled on both of them, covering the two from head to toe like it was boiling tar.

‚ÄúSure man, let‚Äôs just ignore the fact people are disappearing every other week.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is not the issue.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen by all means, explain to me what happens to *be* the issue‚Äù, said Louis, sounding progressively more insulted by the level of absurdity that conversation was beginning to approach. ‚ÄúBecause I don‚Äôt see anything more serious than that taking place inside the Triangle right now.‚Äù

‚ÄúDamn buddy, I don‚Äôt know?‚Äù Ivan said, feigning confusion. ‚ÄúPeople seeing shit that isn‚Äôt there, maybe?‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, so that‚Äôs what you think this is. People making stuff up because they‚Äôre bored yokels with too much free time. Apparently that‚Äôs my case, too.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how they keep you under control.‚Äù

Louis let out another loud, ugly bootleg of a sincere laugh. Ivan was unfazed by it, doing his best to cling to any scrap of dignity he believed he still had left in that exchange.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt sound the least bit crazy right now, buddy‚Äù, said Louis, not looking at his friend as he brought his beer closer. ‚ÄúNah, not by a country mile. Absolutely sane and level-headed.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, let‚Äôs both act like I‚Äôm the asshole, that‚Äôll do it‚Äù Ivan said, pretending to agree as he stared at the first direction in which Louis wasn‚Äôt in his field of view. ‚ÄúJuan‚Äôs gonna fuck himself over as soon as he picks up that phone, I can promise you that.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs his only choice.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not even in danger.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe lives in Weaver Parish Road, Ivan‚Äù, said Louis, outraged to the point he was actually looking at his friend once again. ‚ÄúDo you even *read* the reports anymore?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing there.‚Äù

Ivan‚Äôs voice was firm and dry in its conviction. He did not look back at Louis as each word came out.

‚ÄúThey still haven‚Äôt found those kids.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a bunch of trees.‚Äù",2,1760923819.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve lived here for years, mostly in the room I‚Äôm currently posting about. The room is on the smaller side around 8x9, has a beautiful magnolia outside of the window, and located on the quieter side of the apt! 

My roommate and I are looking for someone lowkey, considerate of noise levels, financial punctuality, overall cleanliness, doesn‚Äôt bring the party home. No couples or pets! Also, someone that doesn‚Äôt exclusively work from home, we both have jobs that don‚Äôt require agoraphobic conditions, lol. I had a cleaner come and target the kitchen, living room, and bathroom earlier this month, I followed up behind them to deep clean and in theory now position us in a maintain phase! 

The apt gets a lot of natural light throughout the day, it‚Äôs located a block from the 36th D/N/R (if you‚Äôre in a real rush you could make it from door to platform in a minute) which is then two stops from Manhattan (D/N), one block from Industry City, and two blocks from Green-wood Cemetery entrance

Me: 34 (he/him) manage a coffee shop in bk, out of the apt pretty often usually taking advantages of the city from film to the ballet to museums. Quiet, respectful of the common areas, noise, and overall cleanliness

Roommate: 32, (he/him) works in logistics, hybrid ‚Äî quiet, clean, and respectful of common areas. 

I‚Äôm ideally looking for someone by the Nov. 1st, but tentative for the right fit! If interested, the cost would be the first month‚Äôs rent which is: $750 and a security deposit of $750 (so, $1500 in total). 

Utilities (gas, electricity, wifi et al) range from $80-$120, sometimes more during the summer months with increased AC usage. 

If interested, please reach out with a blurb about yourself and perhaps an insta handle, so I can assess temperament overlap ",2,1760923647.0,NYCroommates,1,0.75,False

1ob6ytb,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TheDistantGod/comments/1ob6ytb/the_applicant/,The Applicant,"One day a new applicant entered my office. He was a nice young man, which made the impression of someone raised by a fine family. His demeanour was one of politeness and sometimes even humility. The knowledge he had gathered in his years of studying at a university was excellent and made him the perfect specimen for the job. I was soon rewarded, for he worked hard and concentrated, sometimes even sacrificing his free time to finish the task at hand. Yet he was by no way shy or unfriendly, his dry and clever comments often produced laughter among his colleagues. All in all, he quickly became a valued member and to some, a good friend always ready to listen. Even if he sometimes displayed strange manners. He would startle at sudden sounds and avoid gatherings with many people. Sometimes when he gave advice, one might get a glimpse of some deep wounds he seemed to hide from the world. But which would come to the surface from time to time, showing in the form of a distant gaze. He would voice his dislike for short-sightedness, fireworks and people not valuing life. But none of us spent much thought on it, for his creativity and joyful approach to life seemed to eradicate our own worries far too often. It was difficult to get to know him better, for he liked to change the subject when things weren‚Äôt to his liking. And he did it very well. Sometimes when I encountered him, leaving the office in the early morning. I would ask if he shouldn‚Äôt see a doctor. I could tell he had some problems with sleeping and even if it never affected his work, I was worried. But he would wave it off, show me a carefree and yet weary smile. He would continue on his way while telling me, how he and sleep couldn‚Äôt find common ground. Infected by his light mood I would wish him a good rest and not think anymore about it. That‚Äôs how things remained. I stopped prodding about things, I was sure I just imagined. And he was genuinely happy to be part of the company. We never saw him frown or moody. All he gave us was a smile before he descended again into the depths of his task.

It was when I met my cousin after quite some time, that I recognized some similarities. My cousin, Jack, was a soldier in the US army. And one day when he came back, he was not quite the same anymore. The doctor had given him some pills and future appointments, to help him heal from whatever troubled him. I learned from his wife how he needed much time and patience from us. He was still my family and we managed to laugh together quite often. But sometimes he would sit on his chair and stare into nothingness. His eyes, dark and heavy, as if his mind was not at home. He wasn‚Äôt good with sleep either, that‚Äôs what the pills were for. Otherwise, he would wake up in the night. Disoriented, claiming to hear something outside, despite the silence all around. On New Year‚Äôs Eve I came around to see him. I was a bit worried since I hadn‚Äôt seen him on Christmas. His wife told me he was in a bad mood, which was the reason for him staying home. When I entered the living room, Jack was sitting there. But I could tell, his mind wasn‚Äôt. Outside, the first fireworks whistled into the night until they cracked. Jack had a hard time dealing with them. He told me how it sounded like hell to him. How his thoughts showed him pictures from the field every time a loud cracking sound echoed through the night. It was the first time he spoke to me about his trauma. He told me that family and friends were the only things keeping the darkness away. And how the scars would never leave him. He thanked me for being there and not ridiculing him with the things I heard, as he confided in me. Me listening to him actually seemed to make him feel better. In the end we even managed to laugh at some hilarious things we had done in the past, despite the sounds outside. After New Year, Jack made quite the progress towards getting better. We would often meet and talk. He had managed to get a job with many nice co-workers. For a while he seemed to forget the things he‚Äôd seen. But he told me that the kinks he had gathered on the field would always remain, somewhere deep down.

I was in the supermarket when a woman dropped an apple. Acting on instinct I quickly picked it up, giving it to her.

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù she said before taking a closer look. ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you my son‚Äôs boss? Mister Watts?‚Äù She added after a moment of uncomfortable silence. Confirming her assumption, I told her how happy my employees were to have someone like her son as a colleague. She smiled at this and replied that he had this effect on people around him. She was obviously very proud of her son in every aspect. Gathering the courage, I asked the question which had entered my mind since she had introduced herself to me. It was quite a leap for me to ask such a thing based on the similarities of two completely different men. And yet in my stomach I knew that this young working man had somehow seen his fair share of disaster.

‚ÄúWhere has your son served?‚Äù I asked, trying to sound casual. I didn‚Äôt want to intrude or anger the woman in front of me. To my surprise she just shot me a puzzled look.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù She replied surprised at how I might have gotten such an impression.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I started a bit awkwardly, not sure what to say. ‚ÄúYou see he shows these unmistakable traits. Things I have seen in other veterans. But whenever we ask him personal questions about things he seems uncomfortable with, he dodges them as if he is afraid to talk about it.‚Äù The woman opposite of me thought for a moment.

‚ÄúHe never went to the army. He displayed a kind of,‚Äù she stopped for a moment in search of the right word. ‚ÄúStrangeness since he was thirteen.‚Äù I assured her how it merely was personal interest which had caused my question. Upon wishing me a nice day, we parted ways. It was the middle of the day; therefore, I went back to my own desk to do some paperwork. On my way through the office, I saw a book on the young man‚Äôs desk. He himself was away, perhaps to get some coffee. It was about past lives and how they affected us even after being reborn.

Head-to-toe black, a massive white spider streaking across his chest, and those eerie, grinning eyes printed over his hoodie, he looked like a villain who had lost his way into the corporate world.

The firm at the top floor of the office building had announced a ‚ÄòCome to Office as a Marvel Character‚Äô day, and Daniel, who was well known as the introvert, decided to actually do it. Later, my corporate buddy who works with Daniel said ‚Äòthe moment he stepped out, coffee cups froze midair, keyboards went silent, and even the HR manager whispered, ‚ÄúOh my godness‚Ä¶ he committed to it.‚Äù

But as the laughter and selfies started, something shifted, Daniel loosened up. The costume gave him boldness, humor, and presence. By the end of the day, he was leading a spontaneous Venom vs. Spider-Man photo battle in the breakroom.

So as we all await the upcoming Pro Shot release for TGWDLM:R! I remembered how the understudies for 'Cinderella's Castle' made an appearance specifically in the pro shot. More specifically, Allison Beteta, Rianny Vasquez, and Mary Kate Wiles all appeared as the villagers that chastise Ella & then again at the end for the finale.  
  
So, with that in mind, do you think we'll get cameos in the pro shot for TGWDLM:R! for Curt Mega, James Tolbert, Rianny Vasquez, and Mary Kate Wiles & if so, where?  
  
My theories are:  
  
MOST LIKELY- Just in the scene right before the meteor hits & Paul talks with Greenpeace Girl, several characters move back and forth across the stage. I would guess this would be their best place to make a quick cameo.  
  
The very end, similar to 'Cinderella's Castle' where the understudies were in the final shot.

LEAST LIKELY/WISHFUL THINKING- In some of the ensemble numbers like 'La dee dah dah day', 'Let It Out', and 'Inevitable'. While I think it would be cool, it would also mean re-staging these numbers just for the Pro Shot & that seems like a lot of time they didn't have. 

They take on roles in other scenes like in the coffee shop or other background shots. This would probably feel like they were overdoing it by this point, but still would be a cute thing to do.

  
What do you guys think? Are we getting cameos from the understudies? If so, where do you think they'll be and where do you wish they'll be? ",18,1760922859.0,StarKid,5,0.96,False

1ob6qeu,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1ob6qeu/a_simple_crush/,A simple crush,"Hi there!! I'm in a bit of trouble as I don't know what the next move is or how to think about what is currently happening. 

Here's some context before I get into it:

I've liked this girl for the past year and a half. I've known her since elementary school, but we never really were friends or were in the same class. We just knew each other existed. 

Middle school hits and she becomes more of an acquaintance due to the fact that one of her good friends and I became best friends. 

When I started liking this girl, we finally had a class together. Junior year of highschool, an AP US History class (a class that kicks everyone's ass not to mention) and it wasn't slowly but boom one moment after the next, it was a realization? I'm not exactly sure if I could even explain or quite exactly remember the moment. 

Anyways, fast forward to now. Since the new school year has started, we've been hanging out more and more. Junior year, because of our shared class, we exchanged snaps. It led to daily snaps filled with texts about our days, following into the summer. But now, we actually text and hangout a ton. That feeling throughout the summer, faded a bit as I was busy with work and extracurriculaes and whatnot. 

Last year, the only reason why I never talked about it was because of the relationship problems she was going through. She dated a guy, just because he asked and she felt bad, and then let him lovebomb her and do weird things behind her back. This year is a bit different with the frequent conversations and hangouts in our cars. 

Here's the things that I'm not quite sure about and probably need another perspective on:

‚Ä¢ She's visited my work a ton
‚Ä¢ She thought once that me and one of my friends were dating and that one time when we went out for dinner, she thought she was third wheeling us (my friend couldn't show up due to a last minute situation) but that's apparently why she wouldn't talk about romantic stuff a lot with me?
‚Ä¢ We've went on several outings, what I consider dates, like the movie theater, going to the coffee shops, etc. (and yes, I would make it clear that it was a ""date"") 
‚Ä¢ she told me about a conversation she had with her sister about my sexuality? And when I asked about how that was brought up, she changed the subject / moved on.

There's a lot more but I'm more unsure about what happened one night.

Me, her, her younger sister, and her sisters friend went to a haunted house. Something we had planned a week or so in advance. This was the first time meeting her sister. Lets call her sister G, and the girl I like F, for privacy purposes

Haunted house, G was making some really gay comments at her sister about me. Like we went to McDonald's before going to the haunted house, and F was driving of course, I didn't get anything because I wasn't hungry and felt bad if F had to pay for me and so G and her friend were eating and F asks to get her nuggets from the backseat, when G says something like ""why doesn't *my name* just feed them to you"" and I said ""WOAH WOAH"" and G said something like ""what I thought you guys liked each other"" and then F took the nuggets and the conversation moved on.

A second thing happened, throughout the hour or so when we were in line, G kept saying that they wanna be in the back of me and F because apparently it's less scary being in the back?? (It was not, for them) And then G brought it up again when we got closer to the door and said QUOTE ON QUOTE ""I dunno, F and *my name* don't want to split up for some reason."" And I had asked if G wanted to be with F because I had no problem with it, and G goes ""NONO THATS OKAY.""

Then lastly, when the door opened, I had grabbed Fs hand because I could already see there were narrow and blackened hallways, (she had already been really nervous and kept asking if it was okay to grab onto me in case, which I already knew that it would just be better to grab her hand) which she said afterwards that she was glad I grabbed her hand.

Anyways yeah, held hands throughout the entire thing while F and everyone were screaming and I was giggling (I'm not easily scared.) but she was super happy afterwards!!

So I have no clue what to do or how to go about it because I'm getting told by my cousin, that this is probably the best time to tell her. 

Previously, I've only dated one other person and that was about 5 years ago where they did some really awful things to me that made my perspective of romance and relationships a bit difficult. 

Thank you all for reading + if you let me know your thoughts üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è, it's genuinely appreciated. 

EDIT: we have talked about previous relationships as conversations before!! And yes, she said this year she wants to remain single and has told my cousin so, but this is all a bit off which is why I'm asking what the best way is to go about it :)",1,1760922766.0,whatdoIdo,0,1.0,False
