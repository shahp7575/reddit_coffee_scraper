1grztsq,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1grztsq/tifu_by_listening_to_michael_lewis_against_the/,TIFU by listening to Michael Lewis' Against The Rules Podcast....,"Today, I went through a drive-through for a coffee. I have poor hearing, so I tend to play my radio at higher than typicalThis particular coffee shop's drive-through window is near the customer seating area, which is relevant.

This season of the podcast deals with sports gambling. This episode is about setting gambling lines/odds, and in particular, about whether you can entice people to make stupid bets by adjusting the line to appeal to fans who think their team is better than they are.

I pull up to the window and hand a $10 bill to a fresh-faced, smiling young woman. Just as she gives me my coffee,  the person Michael Lewis is interviewing relays an anecdote, which ends with him shouting, in a loud and gruff voice, ""Theory? Theory? In theory, a dick don't fit in an asshole...""

The perky young woman's smile instantly vanishes and flips to a look of utter disgust. Looking past her into the cafe, I see customers' heads snap towards the window in surprise. 

Mortified, I mumbled an apology, and drove off without collecting my change. Barista got a 400% tip. 

TL;DR: I played a normally family-friendly podcast at high volume, blasting people with a vulgar sound bite. I drove off, leaving a barista with an $8 tip on a $2 coffee.",2,1731687034.0,tifu,0,1.0,False
1grztf1,https://www.reddit.com/r/LPR/comments/1grztf1/my_journey_with_lpr/,My Journey with LPR,"Its been 5 years of trying to figure out what is happening with my health…….been to 4 ENTs, 2 Family doctors, EKGs, Heart Specialists, Dieticians and more……I finally found the solution online after someone sent me to visit Dr Koufmans Blog.  (I have zero financial or other interest in her practices, or personally)  My issues are tight chest, Sinus infections (7 in the last 2 years that required antibiotics), dental decay, headaches (from Sinus), sore throat, raspy voice and overall feeling terrible.  I even had TMJ from clenching my jaw at night.

I just want everyone to realize that her program, available for free without any purchase, has helped me relieve my symptoms drastically.  It’s been 5 days on the diet and around 3 weeks of drinking alkaline water, and yesterday for the first time in 5 years I had only a single episode.  I felt normal for the first time.  It was great.

Start with Alkaline water - the moment I tried my first store bought alkaline water I knew it was going to help, at least with the symptoms.  Instant relief.  I now spray it in my throat, up my nose, and only drink it, other than one coffee per day which is allowed on the diet.  (To save $$ I bought filters for my water bottles and rotate them, as well as a filter for the brita).  The goal is to drink alkaline water with a PH of higher than 8.5……mine tests at 9.  This will kill the pepsin which is the actual burning that is happening - acid activates pepsin.

I then started the diet (it’s not as hard as you think) and I feel much, much better, even after just 5 days.  Hopefully my LES and UES is healing and in a few weeks I will start to bring back more of the food I miss.  My favourite line from Dr Koufman is when someone asks her what to start introducing into diet after symptoms are under control and she says “well what do you miss most?”  Everyone’s triggers are different…..some have zero issues with bananas and others are triggered (although I think it’s how ripe the banana is that causes issues).

Asorbic Acid is in almost every food in a can, bottle or package.  This I beleive is what has caused so much LPR issues in younger and younger people.  Why do Italians with GERD eat tomatos?  Because they eat fresh with no ascorbic acid added.  I now eat nothing with it added.

I finally see the light at the end of the tunnel - I highly suggest if you or your loved one is having issues, to read what Dr Koufman has online, and her books.  (If $$ is an issue, very good info including the diet is online - [https://jamiekoufman.com/dr-koufmans-reflux-detox-diet-2/](https://jamiekoufman.com/dr-koufmans-reflux-detox-diet-2/)  Good luck!",1,1731687006.0,LPR,1,1.0,False
1grzsyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1grzsyl/aeropress_and_zp6_help/,Aeropress and ZP6: help!,"I have been struggling to get good coffee recently. I just upgraded from a cheap Timemore grinder to a 1zPresso ZP6. So now I have no excuses for bad coffee.

My brews are unfailingly astringent. When I grind coarser, it's still hollow and dry. When I grind finer, it's harsh and leaves a terrible lingering aftertaste.

I'm currently using an anaerobic yeast Nicaraguan coffee. I am using filtered water.

Broadly, I've tried ZP6 grind sizes from 3.8-4.8. My base recipe is below. With finer grinds, I've shortened the brew time by \~30s.

Dose 16g, 240g water (1:15 ratio). Water temp 205 °F / 96 °C.

* 0:00: Pour \~50g, stir, let bloom.
* 0:30: Pour remainder of water. Stir back and forth a few times.
* 2:00: Swirl
* 2:30: Press (so easy, smooth with the ZP6. <30s while pressing gently).

This recipe worked fantastically for a particular natural process coffee from a roaster in my college town, but I'm not nearby them anymore, and want to experiment with different coffees anyway.

**Dose/ratio**: I don't want to do a significantly higher dose (A 30g dose for 250 ml is excessive. Coffee is expensive, I don't want that much caffeine at once, and I want to drink more than 150 ml at a time). Do anaerobics just shine with a lower ratio? I'll finish out this bag with that approach if needed.

**Temp**: I've also tried slightly cooler water (200 °F) with no improvement.

**Grind**: As mentioned, I've tried ZP6 grind sizes from 3.5-5. This seems to be in the ZP6 pourover range, which I think should be on the coarse side for aeropress.

**Method**: Last resort, should I become a pourover person? Would that help me out? I've been contemplating getting an origami air dripper for a while...",1,1731686974.0,AeroPress,0,1.0,False

So I’m looking for an every day bag to bring with me on errands, to work, to the gym, etc. I am currently using a boat and tote bag from LL Bean but I’m starting a new job and I have decided I need something more appropriate! I love the structure and how it just stands up on its own without me doing much. I also love how I can see everything that’s in it. 

I’m a big bag girl and I love being able to fit a yeti (or two) in my purse. I am also looking for a small clutch/wristlet/convertible crossbody to put in the bag if I want to just run into a coffee shop or something. 

Right now I’m loving the look of the Coach Empire Carryall 40 and the Coach Rogue 39. I also love the Cuyana System Tote but have heard iffy things about their quality. For budget, I’d like to stay under $1,200.

1grzqas,https://www.reddit.com/r/tellnoonepod/comments/1grzqas/just_some_recent_observations_regarding_the/,Just some recent observations regarding the podcast ,"Hello once again fellow listeners!

Right off the bat, I PROMISE this will probably be my last post. I feel I've done too many and overstayed my welcome lol. Feel free to read or skip it; I just want to get this off my chest. Some criticism up ahead, but more an observation. I'll wrap up on a good note.

This post is about the pod itself and not about our lovely hosts (unlike that other post from a few months back). I have nothing negative to say about the girls. They do a fantastic job at researching and telling the cases, and the chemistry and everything is, as Alaina would say, *muah!* Chef's kiss. Perfect.

Anyways, I have noticed recently they’ve just been non-existent on social media, especially Instagram. I noticed it BEFORE election season, and I think the election results made it worse. We usually get a few posts, but then they just disappear and are non-existent. No random posts, no reel sharing, nothing. From time to time, I'll check the Patreon page to see if they post notes or updates, and this time I noticed there were two cases from the last couple of weeks, but there was never any announcement or post on Instagram about it. This just looks to me like they’re leaving Instagram behind and maybe just focusing on their Patreon, which to me is disappointing. As someone who's mostly on Instagram, I’m just kind of sad to see it happening.

Let’s talk Patreon for a sec, just cuz I’ve been asked, why not just join? I’m not a big fan of Patreon in general, not just for this pod. In my opinion, it’s a bit unfair for new fans and old listeners who maybe can’t afford to pay. Other ways of helping would be better, like I’ve seen newer or smaller pods have that “buy me a coffee” link or Venmo maybe? Idk. NOT TO COMPARE GIRLS WHO ARE KILLING IT, but the way Wondery and Morbid do their subscription is actually a great and better option. Everyone gets to hear the podcasts, not just a select few. These are NOT suggestions btw, just my thoughts. This podcast clearly found what works for them, and I’m happy. It’s just that I don’t think Patreon alone can get them up there in the charts. This pod is so good, it deserves to be in the top 50 at least, and I want them to reach it. This is starting to sound like a rant, so imma cut it here before I catch Annie’s wrath, and as a guy, we’re already public enemy for some girls 😂

This pod may not be my number one, but it’s the only one I recommend to people. Quick story about that: I went on a couple of dates with a girl who was into true crime, so I mentioned this pod, and she said she’d give it a try. Well, next date I asked her and she hated the pod, specifically the way they feel about men lol. She even questioned why me, a guy, listened to it knowing they hated men 😂 🤣. Didn’t work out.

Anyways, ending on a positive note: I LOVE this pod despite my criticism (which I think is fair). It’s been a rough year for me, but I’m trying to just be positive for others and keep my own issues to myself. One of the things I do to cope is listen to this pod. More specifically, the dolphin lady episode, which I always have downloaded in case I want a quick laugh. So if the girls ever have any doubt about the work they do with this pod, hopefully they know that at least it made a difference in one person’s life.

That’s it. If you made it this far, thanks for reading. I’ll be lurking around while waiting for my monthly episode, but no more posts from me. Hopefully when they reach thousands of followers, this sub will be more active. Until then, happy holidays, happy new years, lots of hugs and best wishes to you all! 😊

I found this sub very helpful when I was doing my planning, so I wanted to offer my contribution in case it was helpful. Since a lot of advice online seems to be repetitive, I'll try and offer relevant insights that I wish I had known in advance. 

**Off the top**

* We were a group of three (mid 20s to early 30s); this made finding hotels more challenging and significantly reduced our options. I was able to find triples everywhere we stayed, but while doing my planning had considered that it was sometimes around the same price or even more economical to book three single rooms rather than stay together. I found most hotel options were either for individuals, couples, or families. 
* I relied on Agoda and [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) for all my hotel reservations. I had zero issues. 
* I used Ubigi to get an eSim, which generally worked without any issue, and cost me about $35 USD for a month and maybe 15 GB. My siblings picked up sim cards at the airport and paid $80 CAD, which got them 50 GB or so for 2 weeks. They never bothered connecting to wifi, but their sim cards were inactive on our last day.
* For our trains, we picked up the JR Sanyo Sannin Area Pass, which was valid for 7 days and covered our trip west of Kyoto. We ended up about breaking even on the trip (we cut a couple of parts of the plan that would have made it a good deal in the end), and I'd say it was equally convenient and inconvenient to have rather than buying tickets separately. 

**General** 

* Everything went very smoothly. I always expect at least some hiccup when I travel, but everything ran on time, all our reservations were fine, things are easy to navigate, and in general you know exactly what to expect. I hope this puts anxious travellers at ease. 
* Popular places are crowded: Senso-ji, Kiyomizu-dera, Arashiyama, Higashiyama, Kinkaku-ji, Harajuku, etc. Use common sense. Get there early, avoid peak hours. Less popular places (To-ji for example) could be surprising empty. 
* One of our party was a vegetarian and found it quite difficult to find food to eat in general -- not a lot of konbini options, not many restaurants. Plan ahead, use Happy Cow, or be flexible with your diet. 
* While train stations and routes were easy to navigate, I found that buying train tickets was often confusing. In larger stations they have separate lines for different machines, different types of ticket holders, and signage up the ass everywhere, which ended up being more confusing than it needed to be. It happened on a few occasions that we were waiting in the wrong queue, and since we didn't have a JR pass specifically, we were often confused about where we should go. While you can easily buy tickets the day of your trip and it makes your travels more flexible, I might have booked more things in advance just to avoid this headache. Because we had the Sanyo Sannin pass, in some cases you don't need a ticket at all and just present your pass; in some cases you absolutely need a ticket. 
* After our flight and accommodation, trains were easily the largest expense, and something to keep in mind if you'd like to see a lot. Logistically speaking, everything worked out for us and we didn't feel rushed, but it costs money to get everywhere. The Shinkansen from Hiroshima to Tokyo was 18000 JPY. 
* I packed myself in a carry-on for two weeks, but could have gotten away with even less. Unless you are fussy about your skincare/hair care products, you don't need to bring anything. Not even a toothbrush, really. 

**Itinerary**

* Friday SEP 27 - Monday SEP 30: Tokyo (Asakusa)
   * Stayed at Tosei Hotel Cocone Asakusa: a short walk from Senso-ji in a quiet neighbourhood. Helpful staff, a coffee machine and laundry on site, clean facilities. A good value. 
   * Getting through customs was time consuming, and getting our eVisa ahead of time barely saved us any time. Frankly, you could fill out the forms while waiting in line. I think 2-3 planes touched down at the same time so we were waiting an hour. 
* Monday SEP 30 - Friday OCT 4: Kyoto
   * Sent a piece of luggage ahead to Osaka with our shopping. This is a more time-consuming process than expected because the hotel will need all your info, will call ahead to confirm your reservation with the hotel (in this case, they called the wrong place and there was some confusion), and there are some forms to fill out. They take cash only. If you're in a rush, do this the night before or set aside time. 
   * Stayed at Tsumugi Shichijo-Kagiyacho, which was a kyomachiya rental. It was a fun experience to stay in one and it had everything we needed on site. The staff were very helpful, but the reception area is a 10 minute drive away from the actual units. It was a good value for a small group. It was also close to Kyoto Station, which I thought would be convenient but isn't. If I could do it again, I would have chosen to be closer to Gion. (This was also the only place that didn't provide pyjamas/lounge wear). 
   * We relied to taxis for nearly the entire stay in Kyoto. It was just more convenient and between the three of us, it wasn't a huge expense (maybe $8-15 for most trips), but it's something to consider when staying in Kyoto -- most attractions are quite spread out and walking/transit isn't always viable. In many cases the ETA for buses was the same as walking. 
   * Since we didn't have a reception, we dropped our luggage at a Yamato location to be sent ahead to Osaka. Easy breezy.
* Friday OCT 4: Kinosaki Onsen
   * Stayed at Kobayashiya, which was a lovely experience. I would absolutely recommend. 
   * Kinosaki is a fun experience, but it's quite small and there isn't much to do other than the onsens. They are also stupid hot, I found them unbearable for more than 5 minutes. 
* Saturday OCT 5: Amanohashidate
   * Was able to combine this and Kinosaki for a couple of days, and was a nice way to get out of the city. Very few foreign tourists here, but still quite busy on a sunny Saturday with locals and Japanese tour groups. It's also very well organized for tourists (maps indicate how many minutes each journey takes), and they offer ticket packages, so worth doing a bit of research in advance if you want to save a few bucks. 
   * Also, the ""prettier"" view is from the top of Viewland, where the amusement park is. 
   * Arrived at our hotel in Osaka in the evening, which was in Shinsaibashi -- a *really* fun neighbourhood, but also quite rowdy. Wouldn't recommend for people who want peace and quiet, or for families. Walking distance from Dotonburi but not right in the chaos.
* Saturday OCT 5 - Tuesday OCT 8: Osaka (Shinsaibashi)
   * We stayed at Osaka Teikoku Hotel, which was a good value in a good location, but not the nicest hotel. But the room was spacious for a triple and had everything we needed. It was like a business hotel but the guests were all rowdy partiers looking for a cheap place to crash. 
   * Forwarded our luggage to Tokyo, and again it was time consuming. They made a fuss about shipping a duffel bag so we had to repack things into a suitcase. Something to keep in mind if you have soft luggage.
* Tuesday OCT 8: Miyajima
   * We stayed at the Hotel Miyajima Villa, which was our favourite of the trip. Wonderful facilities and unpretentious, across the street from the ferry. Would stay here again. 
   * It was nice to stay on the island to give us time to relax and be able to explore early in the morning the next day. The island is busy with day trippers and school groups even into the evening. However, once night falls, there's really nothing to do here -- shops are closed, and restaurants are few and busy. We ended up grabbing our dinner at the Family Mart. If your hotel has dinner as an option, I'd recommend that, and book a nice hotel that you would enjoy spending your evening at.
   * Another thing is that there's a lot more to do here than I expected! I can imagine spending a weekend here and doing some hiking and exploring more of the island. There's a Buddhist temple (Daisho-in) that I didn't even know about until later. 
* Wednesday OCT 9: Hiroshima
   * Caught the Aqua Net Ferry, which is convenient for getting you directly to Hiroshima without having to go around with the JR Ferry > train to Hiroshima Station. It also takes you past the Atomic Dome for some great views. 
   * Stayed at The Knot Hiroshima. This was my least favourite hotel. It's very Western in style and concept, and was popular with predominantly Western tourists. The reception is on the top floor where the rooftop bar is, where they play house music and offer overpriced drinks and snacks. There was also an absurd coin system, where they give you 3 coins for your stay and you can trade them for stuff at the bar, but most drinks would be 5 coins. It was walking distance from the Peace Park, but it felt very pretentious and more like a bougie club than a hotel, I would not recommend. I also felt that for an upscale hotel, there were others that offered better services and facilities. 
   * This was a convenient location as a tourist, but all the restaurants in the area felt very fussy -- mostly Western cuisines (French, Italian) and more upscale. In general this was just not my vibe, and I would have preferred to stay elsewhere more laid back.
* Thursday OCT 10 - Saturday OCT 12: Tokyo (Shinjuku)
   * Stayed at The Knot Shinjuku, which had been recommended on this sub. It's nicely located across from Shinjuku Chuo Park, and not too far from the train station, but honestly it still felt kind of far out. This Knot was much nicer than the Hiroshima one (no silly coins!) but also felt like some European bougie hostel in terms of vibes. It was fine, but wouldn't stay here again. 
   * This was an interesting neighbourhood to be in because it felt like people lived there and wasn't very busy, but it also didn't feel particularly convenient as a tourist. Not a lot of restaurant options nearby, train stations and attractions would be a considerable walk away. I would probably consider staying closer to Shibuya, which is closer to attractions and generally livelier.  
   * On our last night we visited Shibuya Sky and I was lucky to have someone help me get a VIP package before they restricted it to Japanese credit card holders. Absolutely worth the extra cost. 
   * We took a cab to the airport because of our luggage but holy shit Haneda -- the departures and arrivals pick-up/drop-off is all in the same place so the traffic was absolutely unbelievable. It took us 45-60 minutes longer than the ETA on Google because we spent so much time sitting in traffic (and that was with our driver making some questionable calls). I'm not sure if it's always like this, but absolutely account for this if you're taking a taxi to the airport. 

**Other impressions, observations and advice**

* Every city has its own vibe: Tokyo is as you'd expect. Kyoto felt more like a town than a city, and even cold and uptight in some ways; I didn't feel quite at home there. Osaka was super chill and fun, this is where I felt most at ease. Hiroshima felt like a big American city with the urban planning and architecture. It was a pleasure just to take in the vibes, see how people live, enjoy the lifestyle in each place, rather than chasing attractions everywhere. 
* Futons were not always the vibe. It was fun to try, and I'd say some were more comfortable than others, but think twice if you have a bad back or joint issues.

I think that about covers it, and if it doesn't, I'm sure all the other trip reports will have you covered. Happy to answer any questions. ",2,1731686283.0,JapanTravelTips,0,1.0,False

The answer is no, you should not.","Panera is owned by private equity firm Jab Holding. Their whole thing is making Panera appear as profitable as possible at the sacrifice of everything else (especially staff) so they can push the company for sale or IPO -- basically making it as appealing to shareholders as possible if they decide to stick this company back on the stock market so they can make a bunch of money and run. They are known to do this, and have pushed many other once-amazing companies to squalor like Caribou Coffee, Einstein Bros. Peet's Coffee etc. They also have a long history of shady business and try to obfuscate or hide facts to avoid negative optics. Examples include how [the company was founded on slave labor in chemical factories](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/world/europe/nazi-laborers-jab-holding.html) during WWII, how they own subsidiaries that produce the base [responsible for the lemonade deaths](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/panera-lawsuit-charged-lemonade-sarah-katz-death-rcna120785), and how they [quietly retired the clean food narrative to lower ingredient quality](https://www.reuters.com/business/panera-loosens-animal-welfare-ingredients-standards-ahead-ipo-internal-documents-2024-03-06/).

**If you work here, expect:**

* Hour cuts, or they will ignore your availability. There are tons of threads about this, just do a basic search.
* The hours you do work will be long, hard scrambles as you work skeleton shifts.
* As prices have gone up and food quality has gone down, it's also set customer culture on fire. Expect plenty of verbal abuse and straight hostility over things you can't control.
* Nebulous training. I've worked at stores with fresh hires training fresh hires.
* Low pay. They say competitive, but the compensation here isn't approaching anything on the market that is competitive. Don't buy into the ""you'll make this much *with tips!*"" garbage.
* Depending on your store, expect leadership that is inept, has issues with sexual harassment, racism, pedophiliac grooming (all that I've personally witnessed and addressed here), and more.
* Staff turnover here is something like 200%+++ right now. That means for every person they hire, at least two quit. There's a reason they're offering you a job in the door for the skill of having a heartbeat.
* If you need the income, do what you must, but don't make this your career stop. They prey on individuals by tiring them out, and your financial and personal growth will halt. Don't make this mistake and *keep looking*.
* Corporate lurks here and has a history of shill and cyberbullying the staff, including by the CEO Jose. (lol)
* The usual suite of anti-union behaviors. If you're organizing, please ping our modmail and we will support you however we can.

Also another thing is that when im loading these lines seeing myself sluggish and exhausted and just to see the van line getting filled quickly more than i even set the package just puts me down and its not like my walking is diminished its me trying to grab the packages and doing the rest.

This is long, I’m sorry, but I need some advice/insight. 

Some background: My husband and I have two young kiddos (5&3) and we both work full time corporate jobs. I traveled for work for 1 night earlier this week; while I was gone, my in-laws spent then night to help my husband with the kids until their nanny arrived the next day. 

I accidentally slept in this morning and got up about 20 minutes later than I normally do (the sun usually wakes me up but I put a pillow over my face lol). This caused me to get a late start on making the coffee and emptying the dishwasher. My husband makes breakfast (reheats from a big dish he made earlier in the week). He got upset at my tardiness and said that my “decision to sleep in” caused everyone to get a late start. I insisted that everything was fine (because it was…the kids were eating and I got the coffee/dishwasher done), but he started ranting about how he has to do everything and I never pull my weight. 

At this point one kid tells us he is scared. My husband immediately responds “I’m sorry for yelling but your mom doesn’t think she needs to do her responsibilities.” This triggered me and I said, loudly, “stop talking like this in front of the kids.” He insisted he wasn’t doing anything wrong, so I went to a different room to collect myself. I overheard him telling our kids that “mommy walked away because she doesn’t think she has to do anything.” I asked him, again, to stop. He responded by saying “stop acting like a lunatic and scaring our kids. Pull your weight. I had to do everything while you were gone and I still have to do everything now because you won’t get out of bed.” He went on like this for another 10 or so minutes; passive aggressively telling them “daddy has to wait for his breakfast because mommy didn’t get the coffee started on time.” I eventually ignored him and just calmly went about with my morning. We had scheduled lunch together and I informed him that I no longer wanted to go because of how he spoke to/about me. He called me immature. 

My questions:
1. How are my kids (5&3) interpreting what he said about me? they obviously love and trust their dad and I am therefore afraid that they will start seeing me as unreliable and irresponsible…and a bad mom…because of his words. 
2. He claimed that he wasn’t doing anything wrong by saying what he said because he was “stating facts.” I feel like I’m being gaslit because I felt that he was being very derogatory towards me for no reason. Am I overthinking this? 
3. Was it petty to call off lunch? I honestly didn’t do it to punish him; I just didn’t want to go on a date after he had spoken to me like that. ",4,1731685651.0,Mommit,4,1.0,False

College life can be amazing, but let’s be real – some semesters hit harder than others. Between endless deadlines, exams, and extracurriculars, it’s easy to feel burned out or unmotivated.

So, I’m curious: how do *you* stay motivated when things get tough? Do you set small goals, reward yourself, or maybe rely on a great support system?

For me, I’ve found that creating a study schedule and taking regular breaks works wonders. Also, treating myself to something nice after finishing a big task (like my favorite coffee or a Netflix binge) keeps me going.

(Please don't share to other places.)

ICYMI: *I've got CPTSD, and I have a lot of anxiety about receiving gifts from people I don't trust. Since I'm posting in this subreddit, obviously my MIL is not one of them. When MIL asked for birthday gift/Christmas wish list this year, I spoke with her directly and asked for any gifts to me to be donations to a charity instead after some realizations in therapy. MIL said ""Oh, but people have already got you gifts"", I said ""that's fine and appreciated, and moving forward I would appreciate charity donations instead"". MIL talked to DH about it, and DH said ""Okay, part of what is most uncomfortable for OP is opening gifts in front of other people, so this is just a head's up that she would prefer to open gifts privately this year"". MIL protested by saying ""Well there are other factors at play"" and asked to get on a call with him. This is the result of that call and everything afterwards. (""Law and Order"" DUN DUN sound here)*

Thank you to everyone who contributed your thoughts on my previous posts--I sincerely appreciate it. I figured I should follow up to let you know the results of your help. As a spoiler, mission accomplished on not crying on my birthday for the first time in years! :)

UPDATE 2:

DH ended up getting on a call with MIL, and he briefed me on what happened afterwards. The start of it was mainly clarifying questions, with the most bizarre one asking if she was not allowed to get gifts for DH too. Gifts for him were never part of the conversation, and my gut said this was the start of a guilt trip, and boy was I right. The rest of the call was her either on the verge of tears or crying about her relationship with me not being what she wants it to be (especially compared to the relationships her friends have with their DILs), and that getting gifts for me was only one of the ""safe"" ways she could show me she knew me and loved me.

She started asking DH about maybe me hanging out with her one on one. For the past year or so due to previous invasiveness/inappropriate behavior when I'm alone with her (treating me like an unpaid therapist and taking advantage of my tendency to overexplain when I'm anxious and I wind up oversharing more than I meant to), I don't feel comfortable with being alone with her and have explicitly asked DH to **not** leave me alone with her until she is regularly attending therapy. She said she's been grieving this relationship she wanted with me--same here, I've been doing that for the past couple of years. I've tried extending olive branches and opening up over the years, but more often than not I wind up getting hurt by her afterwards. DH said he would talk with me and get back to her. He said that she loves me, and is asking all of this because she loves me.

This doesn't feel like love, this feels like boundary stomping, and I told DH that. I felt like this is a red herring and a guilt trip. She's missing the point--IT'S NOT ABOUT HER. She is not the only one I am putting this boundary into place for. I communicated what I would feel most comfortable with, and I should not have to share all my traumas in order to get compliance with that. I feel icky about her unloading on DH like that rather than talking with me directly since she chose to focus on her relationship with me. However, since this is the message she chose to respond with, I don't know that that I would have received it well even if she had responded to me without making DH play messenger. She is once again centering herself in the situation, and with this kind of validates my concern that it was never actually about giving me a gift or celebrating. It was about the ""show"" that would happen--the tradition of everybody saying something nice about the gift or gift-giver, and when I get anxious about making sure she knows I'm thankful so it won't be held over my head later (as a result of the experiences contributing to my CPTSD). It was about ""buying"" a good relationship with a present--even though I get snide backhanded comments about my weight and rude questions from her the rest of the year. I understand where she might think gifts are a ""safe"" way to show love, but I prefer to receive love through words of affirmation and quality time, and it's really hard to feel comfortable doing that with her when she keeps breaking any progress of trust.

DH and I had a very good conversation afterwards. I did not respond to MIL's tantrum, because I didn't want to play into her triangulation game with DH and I didn't feel ready to address my beef with her directly. I remembered that I do not **have** to do anything. Fast forward to when we planned to see the ILs, and it was a nice visit. Even though she visibly was not happy about it, she did respect my request of opening gifts privately and didn't force it. I thanked her before we left, hugged her, said I really appreciated it, and afterwards I noticed she immediately backed up and went to the other side of the room (from being upset). I opened gifts at home--most of it is random stuff that will probably end up being donated, but one gift really did make me feel known and loved. She had remembered it from a conversation months before, and I wear it daily. I texted her a thank you note, and thanked her for understanding my request to open things privately, saying ""I know it's weird but it really means a lot to me."" She responded that they love me and want me to be comfortable. I didn't feel exhausted afterwards, and didn't need several days to recharge, and it validated the need for this boundary.

All that to say, there have been some definite red flags to me, but I'm cautiously optimistic. If nothing else, I feel more confident in communicating my needs, advocating for myself, and trusting my perceptions in general. I'm working on analyzing my triggers with MIL in therapy, continuing to build confidence, and hopefully eventually getting to a place where I can roll my eyes at her and let her hurtfulness just roll right off. I'm talking through potentially inviting her out to coffee and clearly stating ""I'd like a better relationship with you too, and these are the hurtful things you have done we need to repair in order to move forward"", while not overexplaining or oversharing. Getting more comfortable with saying ""no"", or ""what an odd thing to say out loud"", or ""if you'll forgive me for not answering, I'll forgive you for being rude enough to ask.""

This will be my last update on this. Thanks to everyone for their insight and words of encouragement. Therapy is great, but it's also been really nice to be able to talk to other people going/have gone through similar experiences.

When quarantine came, My grades really dropped, I did the worst in school, It wasn’t just because of that friend group, I had another one in that school during that year, both were encouraging me to not attend online classes and stuff (I was easily influential), Im not blaming them I had trouble too, I had social anxiety, even  turning the mic on during attending was hard, my first friend group during that year were worried about me and my grades (we were nerds)
 
Then I changed school, had depression, my friend group (the one with my cousin) stopped talking, entered high school, got over the depression, changed high school, have really fun friends who are just as nerdy as me to make me a better person, anyway I drifted off from the topic

My cousin and I stopped talking when the friend group stopped talking, we’re not mad at each other right now, it’s just awkward between us now, I know this stuff happens in life, you just change and drift off, but I miss our friendship, she still goes every Friday to my grandparents house, I stopped going every week after quarantine, it was nice having the house to myself for one day, then I got used to it, I visit every month or so, but It’s still awkward between us, I think we both grew up, I remember last year I think, we met  and went out for coffee, we had a fun conversation where we just reminisced about stuff, it’s still awkward between, I’ve always felt that she was stuck with me, She was a very social kid and I was just an autistic kid who had no personality, When people made jokes to me id go “oh, yeah”, plus I’ve always felt like I was a pushover, I still am but not as much, There was a story with the chair, here’s the thing, it was a small thing but it meant more, there was a swinging chair (idk what it’s called) that everyone loved to sit on, we’d constantly fight over it, I remember never sitting on it unless there was no one, But one day I got to it first and my cousin went ‘that’s my seat’, I said ‘no I got to it first’ (if it was her seat why would she race me to it?), everyone expected me to get up, Then I went and cried she followed me, to everyone it was just a seat, but to me it made me realize that I was a fucking pushover, I’d immediately do what someone tells me, I told her that I don’t wanna be stepped on, We made up, she’s not a bad person, we had a good friendship then, but now we changed, I don’t go to my grandparents house that often because I felt like everyone is judging me, I tried to get over it, when I went last time we had some fun, she and I still maintain small talk, or a casual conversation if we met there and the other cousins haven’t arrived yet, we make jokes, but It’s very clearly still awkward between us, I miss her and I think she misses me too, but I don’t think we can go back, we’re not the same people anymore.",1,1731684582.0,Vent,0,1.0,False

Worth getting checked out?,"35 F, 183 cm, 79 kg diagnosed with hEDS, migraine with aura, trigeminal neuralgia, ADHD. 
Medication: Concerta 54 mg. 
Lifestyle: Very low alcohol intake (1-2 light beers a month max), no tobacco products, moderate caffeine intake (around 2 cups of coffee/day). Exercise 5-6x/week (mostly lifting weights, some dance + other cardio)

Tl;dr Have had classic TN affecting the left mandibular branch for 1.5 years, sporadic facial spasms on the same side for ca. 6 months, in the past week I now have near constant spasms and twitching on the same side as the TN and wonder if it's a random coincidence or related and whether it's worth a follow-up. 


Longer version:
I have idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia (classic TN with paroxysmal attacks but no nerve compression or other cause found in an MRI) which started about a year and a half ago. It was suggested that I start with carbamazapine but I've held off for now because the side effects scare me and it's been pretty unpleasant but manageable. In the last couple of months though, the attacks have gotten much more frequent (from a few per week to dozens per day on some days). 

I have also had occasional muscle spasms in the area next to my lip and lower part of my left cheek for maybe half a year. Then this past week or so I've started having almost nonstop twitching in the same area, and also a bit higher up, under my eye. It's gotten to be very disruptive. I've had brief bouts of muscle twitching before around my eye, in my bicep and thigh muscle. Those were much milder and short lived though, and it seems like an odd coincidence that my face is losing its **** twitching constantly in the same general area where I know something is screwed up with my trigeminal nerve. It also seems to have progressed in severity. But then again, it also seems like the left side of my body is just a mess. The trigeminal neuralgia, visual disturbances and partial blindness from migraine auras, icepick headaches, tinnitus, neck pain and tense/shortened neck muscles, way worse joint instability in the upper body, even noticeably shorter limbs and digits, and now this face twitching...all on the left side. So I'll readily accept that my left side is just cursed and there's nothing more to it but a weird coincidence.

However, the early-onset TN and now the aggressive twitching is making me anxious that some underlying neurological BS was missed. I believe that MS is one of the things they ruled out but I'm not totally sure. I do not have the neurologist's report in my electronic records (though it should be possible to request it), I was just told by my doctor that *he* was told that everything was normal with the MRI (no reason to doubt that of course, I just don't have any details). I also got blood tests recently (sodium and potassium levels and some tests for kidney and liver function) so I could start taking carbamazapine with less delay if the TN suddenly gets even worse. Everything was normal there too. 

I don't doubt the competence of the individual doctors involved in my healthcare, but the system (in an unnamed European country) can be a little chaotic. I don't have direct access to any kind of specialist in most cases, everything is through my primary care doctor at a healthcare center which has a high staff turnover, and I've had 3 different doctors since the onset of the TN so it's very hard for them, or me, to really have a coherent picture of things and I don't want to add more chaos and bother my doctor with some random symptom unless it might be significant.

* **Zero dollars** to open an account
* **Zero commission** on stock and ETF trades
* Research tools that actually make sense
* Customer service that doesn't make you want to throw your phone

**Real talk:** This is where most successful investors park their money.

# For the Tech-Savvy Beginner: SoFi Invest

Starting with just a dollar?

SoFi's got you covered.

**Think of it as the Netflix of investing:**

* Clean interface
* No hidden fees
* Start investing with your coffee money ($1 minimum)
* Free financial planning (yeah, actually free)

The only downside? No fancy tax-loss harvesting.

But let's be honest - if you're just starting, that's like worrying about premium gas for your bicycle.

# For the Mobile-First Investor: Webull

This is where the young guns are hanging out.

Zero commissions. Zero minimum deposit. All the fancy charts you could want.

But here's the catch - no mutual funds.

If you're cool with stocks, ETFs, and options, you'll feel right at home.

# For the ""I Want Everything"" Investor: Charles Schwab

Think of Schwab as the Swiss Army knife of investing:

* **$0 account minimum**
* **$0 trading fees**
* Every investment type you can imagine
* Education that actually teaches you something

The best part? Their customer service is legendary.

# For the Absolute Beginner: Robinhood

**Here's why Robinhood exploded in popularity:**

* Dead simple to use
* Commission-free everything
* Crypto trading available
* Perfect for small accounts

But remember - simple doesn't always mean better.

During the GameStop chaos, they showed some cracks in their armor.

# For the Growing Investor: E*TRADE

E\*TRADE is like graduating from high school to college:

* No minimum deposit
* Solid research tools
* Great for options trading
* Strong educational content

But it might feel like drinking from a firehose when you're starting out.

# How to Choose the Right Platform

**Here's the framework successful investors use:**

1. **Know Your Goals**
   * Just starting? → SoFi or Robinhood
   * Long-term wealth? → Fidelity or Schwab
   * Active trading? → Webull or E\*TRADE
2. **Consider Your Budget**
   * Most platforms now offer $0 minimums
   * Watch for hidden fees
   * Check option contract costs if you're into that
3. **Think About Support**
   * Need hand-holding? → Fidelity or Schwab
   * Prefer figuring things out? → Webull or Robinhood
   * Want education? → E\*TRADE

# Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Don't fall for these traps:**

* Picking a platform just because your friend uses it
* Ignoring customer service ratings
* Getting seduced by fancy features you'll never use
* Forgetting to check the fine print on fees

# The Bottom Line

**Here's the truth:** The best platform is the one you'll actually use.

Start with something simple like Fidelity or SoFi.

You can always switch later.

**Remember:** The platform is just the vehicle.

Your investment decisions are what really move the needle.

Get started today.

Even if it's just with a dollar.

Because the best time to start investing was yesterday.

The second best time? Right now.",1,1731684430.0,cliobra,0,1.0,False

1grys7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1grys7o/budget_recap_90_person_sunday_wedding_in_the/,Budget Recap - 90 person Sunday Wedding in the Midwest,"I am a few months out from my August 2024 wedding, and wanted to share a recap of my wedding costs / a couple of insights! I loved reading the different budget breakdowns other brides shared - it really helped me to get an idea of (1) what wedding stuff can actually cost (I feel like you don’t truly know until you start planning/getting quotes) and (2) just how different but equally acceptably a budget can be allocated to different things based on your priorities! 

**Wedding Details**

**Started Planning:** Engaged August 2022, started planning May 2023

**Location**: MCOL city in the midwest

**When**: A Sunday in August 2024 (I know, I know - my thoughts on Sunday are below! lol)

**Guest Count**: 117 invited, 90 attended

**Funding**: We paid for most of our wedding (and planned to pay for the whole thing, we’re established adults in our late 20s), but were graciously gifted a few things by both of our parents :)

**Total Final Cost:** **$24,358.18**

**Budget Breakdown**

Where possible, I included my estimated costs (which I determined via educated guesses / what my ideal budget would be) and final costs. Before I knew anything, I had a budget of $15,000-$20,000 in mind. We initially approached planning with the mindset of let's get a date and a good venue we like locked in for a low/reasonable price, and use that to guide how we allocate for everything else - this might not work for everyone, but it worked for us since the venue we selected impacted our other vendor decisions.

**Venue: Final Cost - $4,350.00** 

* Included space for getting ready, ceremony and reception, and all tables/linens/chairs, and venue support staff. I LOVED having things so centralized. $350 of this total included access to their decor inventory (like signs, candles, cute chairs/tables, yard games - HUGE help that saved a lot of effort/money). It was a beautiful venue that is usually $8,000+ but we got a deal since we had our wedding on Sunday. 

**Catering: Estimated Cost - $6,000.00 | Final Cost - $7,722.68 (including tip)**

* My family gifted us our catering as a wedding present - so kind!! Cost includes cocktail hour appetizers, plated meal, and open bar. We had a served/plated meal (salad, dinner roll, choice between 2 entrees, and potato/vegetable side) and open bar (included water, lemonade, coffee, a local beer keg, wine, and 2 signature cocktails/mocktails). We had to use the venue’s caterer for food/beverage, and it ended up being fine! I was initially hesitant to be locked in, but they really did a nice job, and included catering staff, linens, glasses, plates, etc and there was no cake cutting/dessert fee even though the staff helped cut/serve (we were allowed to bring outside dessert from a registered bakery). Our guests are also not huge drinkers (me and my husband don’t drink at all) and we had our wedding on a Sunday, so people enjoyed alcohol, but weren’t crazy lit lol which was great for the vibe we were going for.

**Florals: Estimated Cost - $3,000.00 | Final Cost - $2,772.87**

* I truly had zero idea how much florals would cost lol after meeting with the florist we used, who I loved, I had a better idea, and ended up feeling really good about what we got for what we paid. The only decor our venue needed was florals, so we didn’t have to spend on anything else. Price includes bride bouquet, 2 corsages, 3 boutonnieres, 9 tables of decor, and ceremony grounded arch (so pretty, basically looks like wildflowers growing!). 

**DJ: Estimated Cost - $1,095 | Final Cost - $1,200.00 (including tip)**

* Our DJ was one of 2 venue-approved vendors we could choose from, and I absolutely LOVED him. He provided all sound equipment for the ceremony and speeches, and really helped emcee and facilitate the day. He was such a calming presence and a true pro. So grateful for him, and didn’t realize how important the DJ is to a smooth day!

**Photographer: Estimated Cost - $2,850 | Final Cost - $3,250**

* This vendor is the one I booked earliest because I got stressed out reading about how all the good photographers book out 2 years in advance lol. In hindsight, I wish I would have not felt rushed because while the photos turned out well, there were issues with communication and the week before the wedding the photog said I should book an extra hour so she’d have time for everything (unexpected cost and annoying, but at that point I was like whatever, I have the room in my budget and want good photos). Most annoying thing is this ended up being almost the same cost as if I would have booked the next tier option which included a bonus photographer and some other extras, but because it was a week before the wedding they said there wasn’t time to find a second shooter. 

**Stationary + Stamps (StD, Invites, Thank Yous): Final Cost - $490.60**

* Adding it all up it seems expensive, but I felt good about the price I paid. Used The Knot for all paper orders and liked the quality. Upon reflection, I could have done virtual Save the Dates to save a bit of money, and then paper invites, but I liked doing paper so no real regrets!

**Dessert: Final Cost - $298.61 (including tip)**

* We had two desserts at our wedding because I LOVE dessert and that was one area I was really excited to have good options for. We had donuts and a cake - we paid for the donuts (I got a discount because I used to work at the bakery) and my husband’s parents gifted us the 3-tiered cake, so I don’t know how much that cost. 

**Hair Stylist: Final Cost - $675 (including tip)**

* Had two stylists do hair for me, my mom, and 4 bridesmaids. We all did our own makeup, which I don’t regret! 

**Wedding Dress: Estimated Cost: $1,000.00 | Final Cost - $1,318.55**

* Bought a sample dress at a discount bridal store and really liked it. I bought a veil when I bought the dress but didn’t end up using it. Sales girl did a good job upselling lol I just didn’t end up liking the look so didn’t use it for my wedding or photos. 

**Dress Alterations: Estimated Cost - $300 | Final Cost - $846.30**

* This was the biggest shock and made my cry lol. I didn’t even have that much done, just a hem, customizing the straps, and slightly bringing in the waist. But the dress looked good so I guess it worked out okay. 

**Bride Shoes: Final Cost - $40**

* I wore Toms lol I am tall and don’t like heels, but loved having a comfy shoe in a bright color to align with our bright color theme! 

**Groom Attire: Final Cost - $600**

* We didn’t really count this cost as a wedding expense because my husband needed a new suit for work anyway! He did get a tie specific to our color scheme, and wore nice dress shoes he already had. He’s very low maintenance ha but looked great!

**Wedding Weekend Hotel for Bride and Groom: Final Cost - $293.57**

* Two nights in a hotel - we got a discount because enough guests booked in our courtesy block. 

**Miscellaneous: Final Cost - $500**

* There are some things we bought that I don’t have specific costs for so I am giving my best guestimate and including this miscellaneous bucket. This includes things like dry snacks for the cocktail hour, printing signs and name cards I designed on Canva, a couple of fancy makeup items I bought to do my own makeup,a gift for our officiant/friend  etc. 

**Final Thoughts**

I am so grateful to have had such a low-drama wedding - both of our families were SO helpful and it was really a fun process for me (lucky, I know!). It was truly overwhelming to see how supportive and willing to help all of our friends and family were, and made our wedding celebrations so special. I still get emotional when I remember all the little moments from the wedding weekend. 

I was a little nervous about having a Sunday wedding, but it really was totally okay and didn’t impact attendance or enjoyment. Many people were traveling from out of town (including us), so just ended up taking a Monday off instead of a Friday. But many were also local, so could go home that night if they wanted. We also kept our invite list fairly narrow, so the people we invited were people who we are close to / would want to attend no matter what. We weren’t trying to have a rager, so we weren’t worried about Sunday from that standpoint, but I was a little concerned people would all leave early (my biggest anxiety through the whole wedding process was wanting people to have fun / not wanting people to be bored lol). We ended up having a solid crew stay until the end (our wedding was 3:30 - 10pm) and truly everyone had a really nice time. We had a good casual / low-key vibe, but everyone still had a lot of energy (we also have really fun friends/family, so people were down to party!). I really think that it is a know your crowd and know your desired vibe decision. 

Note that I did not use a wedding planner/day of coordinator - I planned everything myself (with help from husband and family of course) and really enjoyed it / found it easy since my job requires similar skills. I really only felt stressed during the initial venue search, when I realized how much certain things cost, and then the week of fretting over final details / whether people would have fun. A family friend did help cue people’s walk down the aisle, but the day kind of just flowed, and the DJ helped announce each “phase” of the day. 

We did not have a formal wedding party (i.e. identical bridesmaids and groomsmen) - we did have “bridesmaids” and “groomsmen” that hung out with us the day of and sat at the head table with us, but we didn’t make them wear anything specific, stand up with us at the ceremony, or do any work etc. We were still able to have fun with our friends on our day, but just really didn’t want to put a financial burden on people by making them buy stuff they’d use once - and they all looked great in what they chose to wear! You can really see everyone’s personality in our photos, which I think is cool. This worked for us, but I am sure some people would disagree with this approach. 

**Moral of the story**: 

There’s no one right way to do things, just what’s right for you. Weddings are SO personal and bring up a lot of emotional and financial considerations, and are likely the biggest chunks of money you’ve spent as a couple which can cause sticker shock lol. At the end of the day when I reflect on the process, I don’t have any regrets, just things that I may have done a bit differently in hindsight. Our wedding weekend was SO special and so much more incredible than I could have ever asked for. I promise, it will all be okay! Even if something goes wrong, at the end of the day you’re still marrying your person, and that's all that really matters :)

Your wedding day also goes SO FAST!!! When the music turned off after the final song I was like “what?? It’s over?? NO!!” and got really sad haha. I hope you all enjoy every second of your wedding celebrations - it is more special than I ever could have realized to have everyone you love in the same place, all there to support you and the person you love. ",2,1731684295.0,weddingplanning,0,1.0,False

	•	A tent for the dance floor (no heaters allowed due to fire hazard per rental company).
	•	Blankets and hand warmers for guests.

I don't plan on trying coffee or alcohol for many more months but I want to start getting some normal foods in my diet again more regularly. Anyone get to a point where maybe the last stage was just not being so anxious and anticipating pain? I honestly feel like thats my problem at this point.

There's a lot of back and forth here and elsewhere about the truth of religion, but rarely do they move the dial. Both parties leave with the same convictions as when they came in. Why? My suggestion is that it's because religion is not and never has been about the truth of its doctrines. If we take theism to be ""believing that the god hypothesis is true,"" in the same way that the hypothesis ""the sky is blue"" is believed, that ship sailed a long time ago. No rational adult could accept the fact claims of religion as accurate descriptions of reality. And yet religion persists. Why? I hold that, at some level, theists must suspect that their religion is make-believe but that they continue to play along because they gain value from the exercise. Religion isn't about being convinced of a proposition, it's about *practicing religion*. Going to church, eating the donuts and bad coffee, donating towards a church member's medical bills. 

I'm not saying theists are liars, and I acknowledge that claiming to know someone else's mind is presumptuous- I'm drawing from my own religious experience which may not apply to other people. ",3,1731683757.0,DebateReligion,25,0.58,False

Other generations of the intel audio chipset might be affected as well, but I cannot verify. Gen 8 processor computers may be unaffected if they use a different chipset. 

Setup: Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS on intel Core i7-8700T + B360 chipset

Issue: When attempting a remote desktop connection from a Windows machine, the Ubuntu system may freeze just after logging in, requiring a power cycle. This happens consistently after a fresh [re]start of Linux. If logging in directly first (not via RDP), logging out, then logging in via RDP, it mostly works, though sometimes it freezes anyway.

Looking in kern.log around reboots I found errors almost exclusively from `sof-audio-pci-intel-cnl`, which appears to be a component of the audio driver for the intel Coffee Lake / Cannon Lake processors / chipsets. Specifically:

`grep -iaB25 ""Linux version"" /var/log/kern.log | grep -ia error`

- `""Linux version""` is part of the first line logged by the kernel at each boot, like `Linux version 6.8.0-48-generic [...]`, using it to catch reboots
- `-B25` shows 25 lines before each match
- `-a` deals with non-printable characters in the log
- `-i` case insensitive

This returns a bunch of lines similar to `sof-audio-pci-intel-cnl 0000:00:1f.3: ipc tx error for 0x30210000 (msg/reply size: 12/0): -22`

Indeed, lspci shows `00:1f.3 Audio device: Intel Corporation Cannon Lake PCH cAVS (rev 10)`.

Apparently, this driver has problems with remote desktop connections. It turns out that Microsoft's RDP client defaults to playing remote audio locally (on the Windows machine). Since I have no use for remote audio through RDP I changed this setting to 'no audio', which fixed the problem completely.

If you've ever tried to eat a sandwich while holding a baby, you know that evolution really dropped the ball by not giving humans a kangaroo pouch. So in an effort to correct this, I decided to try out the Infantino 4-in-1 carrier.

Here's what happened.

# First Impressions

When I first unboxed this thing, it looked like some sort of tactical baby gear designed by someone who really enjoys solving Rubik's cubes while blindfolded. 

There were straps. So. Many. Straps. 

But it's actually pretty intuitive once you get past the initial ""which strap goes where and why am I suddenly tied to myself"" phase. The instructions are clear enough that even my sleep-deprived brain could follow along, which is saying something considering I recently tried to put my phone in the refrigerator and spent five minutes wondering why my Instagram wasn't getting colder.

The carrier itself is lightweight. It's made from a sturdy but breathable fabric that doesn't feel like you're wrapping your baby in a camping tent. Also, the padded shoulder straps have a nice, cushiony feel.

The waist belt is wide and substantial, like a supportive hug for your lower back, which is exactly what you need when you're carrying around a small human who seems to gain a pound every time you blink.

And all the buckles click satisfyingly into place with a reassuring snap that says, ""Don't worry, your baby isn't going anywhere."" The whole thing comes in a color that can only be described as aggressively neutral, but it's perfect for those of us who aren't trying to coordinate our baby gear with our outfits or make a fashion statement beyond I successfully left the house today.

# My Favorite Features

**Four carrying positions.** It gives you:

* Narrow seat facing-in for tiny babies (aka the potato phase)
* Wide seat facing-in for when they level up to chunk-a-lunk status
* Facing-out for nosy babies with FOMO
* Back-carry for when you want to pretend you're giving a very small person a piggyback ride to Narnia

**Ergonomic.** The seat adjusts from narrow to wide, which means your baby isn't doing the splits like a gymnast in training. The waist belt distributes weight to my hips, because my back has enough problems from all that pregnancy posture.

**Easy-to-clean fabric.** The material is forgiving when it comes to baby... incidents. I'm talking spit-up, drool, pureed carrots, and those mysterious stains that appear out of nowhere like they're being teleported from another dimension. The fabric wipes clean easily and dries quickly, which is more than I can say for my dignity.

**Adjustable straps.** The straps adjust to fit different body types, which means both my 6'0"" partner and my 5'4"" self can use it without looking like we're wearing hand-me-down baby gear. Though watching my partner try to adjust it the first time was better than premium cable.

**Head support.** The built-in head support is clutch for those early months when your baby's neck strength is comparable to a wet noodle. It folds down later when they develop their own neck gains, which happens approximately three days after you've finally mastered using the head support. 

# Pros

* Actually comfortable enough for longer wearing sessions, including those times when putting the baby down would trigger a meltdown of nuclear proportions
* Easy to put on solo once you've practiced in front of a mirror like it's a dance routine for your high school talent show
* Compact enough to stuff in a diaper bag
* Durable enough to survive multiple washing machine cycles

# Cons

There are more straps than a parachute convention, and while the fabric is durable, it's not exactly runway material. Think more practical parent who hasn't slept in three days than Instagram influencer who somehow manages to look perfectly put together while baby-wearing in heels.

# Final Thoughts

It gets the job done, doesn't break the bank, and won't leave you stranded in the grocery store parking lot with a screaming baby and dead arms.

**It's a good option for:** 

* Parents who want their arms back occasionally for radical activities like eating or texting
* People who understand that baby gear doesn't need to match their outfit
* Anyone who needs something that works for multiple stages because babies grow faster than your sleep debt
* Those who appreciate having money left over for coffee and shampoo
* Practical parents who value function over fashion

**Skip it if you:**

* Have an unlimited budget and dream of being featured in Rich Parents Monthly
* Actually enjoy the arm workout of traditional baby-holding (weird flex, but okay)
* Are looking for something with more bells and whistles
* Think ""basic"" is an insult rather than a lifestyle choice

Madaling araw pa lang umalis na ako ng bahay dahil may business duties akong kailangang asikasuhin. Isinabay ko na rin yung mga errands sa bangko para hindi sayang ang araw. At makalibot manlang sa mall dahil hindi ko na maalala kung kailan ko huling na-treat ang sarili ko. Nagbilin naman ako na luluwas ako sa Metro Manila kaya sila na ang magpakainin ng farm animals, tingnan-tingnan ang mga house pets, magligpit kung may kalat - mga gawing bahay habang wala ako. Bumili ako ng pizza, donut, cake pampasalubong sa bahay. Bilang treat sa sarili ko, bumili lang ako ng iced coffee pamatid-uhaw lang habang byahe pauwi. Nag-burger lang ako kaninang lunch. 

Akala ko, magiging magaan ang loob ko pag-uwi ko. Halos 9pm na ako nakauwi dahil yung travel time na 4 hours, naabutan pa ng Friday-Payday rush hour traffic. Kahit paano nag-eexpect ako ng 'suprise'. Kahit birthday banderitas man lang dahil kapag may birthday sa family namin, ako numero-unonh abala sa pagdecorate, bumibili ng cake. 

Pagpasok ko ng bahay, nakakalat yung pupu at ihi ng aso - wala manlang naglinis. Yung diaper ng isa pa naming aso na in-heat, binihisan ko na ng diaper bago ako umalis, wala manlang nagpalit ng diaper buong araw. Pagpasok ko sa kusina, nakatambak ang hugasin, wala pang sinaing (hindi ako nagsabi na may pasalubong ako - siguro iniisip din nila na may bibilhin ako pang-hapunan, pero dahil sa gabi kami nagpapakain ng pets kailangan by 6pm may sinaing na), at wala pang ulam. Ibinilin ko yan lahat. Yung ulam na tira kagabi, napanis na kasi hindi ipinasok sa ref. Yung bilin kong pakainin ang manok, ibon hindi nangyari dahil yung iginayak kong ipapakain sa kanila ay nandun pa rin kung saan ko iniwan.

Si mother at Tita ko nasa salas nanonood ng BQ. Nagmano ako at tinanong kung kumain na sila. Hindi pa raw at gutom na sila. Magluto na raw ako. Ang kapatid ko, naglalaro ng ML sa kwarto.  Bigla akong nanlumo. 

Bakit pa ako nag-istay dito? Dahil sa mga alaga namin. Kapag umalis ako, walang mag-aalaga sa kanila. Nanay ko hingi nang hingi ng aso at pusa pero hindi naman siya ang nag-aalaga. Kapatid ko, bumili ng golden retriever at nung hindi makayanan ang energetic characteristic ng aso inuwi na dito sa bahay. Bumili naman ng shih-tzu para manageable daw pero inuwi rin dito sa bahay dahil hindi kayang alagaan nung nagkasakit ng leptospirosis. Ang ending, ako na ang nag-aasikaso sa lahat habang nagtatrabaho din. Ayaw naman ng nanay ko na kumuha ng kasama sa bahay dahil hindi siya tiwala sa ibang tao at baka raw i-tsismis sa iba kung ano ang nangyayari sa loob ng bahay. Hindi ako lumaking confrontational dahil kapag nagsasalita ako noon, pinapagalitan ako. Kahit tama ang sasabihin ko, pagagalitan pa rin ako. May mga araw na walang lumalabas na salita sa bibig ko. Hindi ganyan ang trato sa mga kapatid ko.

Anong pinakamasakit? Wala ni isa man ang bumati sa akin. Nauna pa akong batiin ng security guard ng subdivision namin.

Apat kami sa bahay ngayon - ako, nanay ko, si Tita, at ang kapatid kong umuwi dahil ikakasal na this month. Bastos mang sabihin sa nakatatanda, ni isa walang nagkaisip na magsaing, mag-urong kasi diba birthday ko naman. Baka kailangan ko rin ng pahinga. Ni hindi nagluto kahit pancit canton para sa akin pero kapag birthday ng isa sa mga kapatid ko, kuntodo handa ang nanay ko. 

Sinisikap kong maging mabuting anak pero bakit ganito? Dahil ba sa hindi kalakihan ang binibigay ko sa kanila? Nandito ako sa bahay dahil nung nag-usap-usap kaming magkakapatid, line of work ko lang ang hindi crucial sa trabaho - pwede akong magwork from home. Walang kasama sa bahay ang nanay ko. Sinakripisyo ko yung career at buhay ko sa Metro Manila dahil hindi sila nagtitiwala sa ibang tao sa bahay. Kinausap ko na ang tatay ko dito. Able naman kami na magpasahod ng kasambahay pero dahil palaging nagagalit ng nanay ko, walang nakakapalag sa kanya. I guess, I deserve what I tolerate - diba.

Buti pa yung aso ko, kahit balot ng ihi at pupu, excited na sinalubong pa rin ako pag-uwi ko.

So eto ako ngayon, naglabas lang ng sama ng loob tapos magsasaing, magpeprepare ng pagkain ng aso at pusa, maghuhugas ng pinggan, maglilinis ng bahay. Ibinigay ko lang yung pasalubong ko sa kanila. Nakakahiya naman, 9pm na hindi pa rin sila kumakain.

Happy birthday to me, I guess?

TLDR; Birthday ko pero hindi ako binati ng family ko, at ako pa rin ang maghuhugas ng pinggan, maglilinis ng bahay",23,1731683702.0,OffMyChestPH,23,0.96,False

La Claque ☕️ is a small place very close to the cathedral, with few seats on the sofa inside -and you may like to talk to others if you like it-, and a bench outside. 

Coffee there tastes wonderfully good. 😋 

The boss Emmanuel used to be a biochemist and at some point, years ago, he decided to challenge his job and created a barista school. 

In 2023, he set up in Nice and opened this little cosy place and decided to share with customers his passion for that brown little bean. 

Every month or so, providers change but quality remains. Thus you can taste different coffees from different origins.

In La Claque, if you are not a coffee-fan, you may also appreciate other drinks  such as a nice matcha latte 🍵 (with coconut milk it’s my fav), or home made citronnade with mashed strawberry, or fig leave kombucha…
And on top of all those liquids, you have to taste on of their cakes! So yummy!

1grygji,https://www.reddit.com/r/torontoJobs/comments/1grygji/toronto_entry_level_tech_sales_interview_process/,toronto entry level tech sales interview process - weird experience,"i’m currently in the process of interviewing at tech company for an entry level sales role and wondering if anyone has had a similar experience to mine. 

my first interview was with a recruiter and it was very standard (types of questions like “tell me about yourself,” “what do you know about the company and why do you want to work here,” etc.) she got back to me the following business day to set up a second interview with the director of sales and told me i should do some more research on the company as that’s what the interview will mainly focus on. that couldn’t have been further from how it actually went. the second interview started out with the guy asking me about myself but very quickly turned into him sneaking in weirdly personal questions (what my parents do for a living, what industry my partner works in). i found it odd and invasive but didn’t feel like i was in a position to refuse to answer considering the state of the job market right now. we barely spoke about the actual job itself or the hard skills i would be bringing to the table and it felt like the purpose of the interview was to conduct a vibe check more than anything else. the salary range was also not disclosed in the job posting nor in either interview which i thought was a little bit weird as well. regardless of these minor red flags though, the interview went well and the following day i got an email from the recruiter asking me to come into the office as a last step to “meet with the director in person and see the space i would be working out of.” (the first 2 interviews were on teams). 

the following week i go in for my in person interview and meet with the same person from the second interview. he showed me around the office and we sat and had a coffee at the company coffee shop in the lobby. the whole vibe was very casual and conversational which in theory sounds nice and chill for an interview except i walked away from it feeling more confused than anything. firstly, we spoke even LESS about the job/company in this interview than the last one. secondly, i had been given the impression in the previous interview that i would be meeting at least one person who would be my direct manager so i was a little confused as to why they made me come all the way into the office for a third interview just to meet with the same person i had already spoken with for an hour…? finally, the man talked so much i barely got a word in the entire time so if the purpose of this interview was to get a sense of my personality i can’t imagine he was able to get a good read. at the end of the interview he tried to wrap it up without asking me if i had any questions so that’s when i asked when i could expect to hear back and he said by the end of the week. 

i walked away from that final interview feeling so confused and frankly, like the trip into the office was a waste of time….why bring me in just to interview with the same person i’ve already talked to and not give me any opportunity to talk or ask questions?? it felt unprofessional. not to mention this is literally for an entry level tech sales job. i guess this is a broader issue that affects the entire job market right now but personally, i think it’s absolutely insane the hoops employers are making candidates jump through for - let’s face it - probably less than 55k. 

anyways, im wondering if anyone has gone through anything similar in their job hunt and/or if anyone has a different perspective on this situation? just feeling discouraged right now cuz i really thought i had it and after the last interview im not really sure what i could have done differently.

I know a dating app isn’t exactly Cupid’s ideal setup, but hey, I’m open to taking the chance! Who knows, maybe it’ll lead me to you, the “favorite person” who’ll add that extra sparkle to my days. If it’s you, I’ll happily make you the reason behind my smiles, the name on my notifications that makes me look twice, and the thought that sneaks into my daydreams.

I’m not looking for a fairy tale, just someone who’ll be the sunshine in my life—someone to share laughter, silence, small talks, and deep talks. Someone who’ll make even the most ordinary days feel like they mean something. Let’s be each other’s “everyday” from simple study dates  to late-night movies, and quiet moments we’ll remember just because we’re together.

A little about me:
- 5’0 college student who juggles books, chemicals, and a whole lot of caffeine (and somehow still finds time to date)
- I can be your partner in crime, your personal cheerleader, and the one to listen when life feels heavy
- Also, I have a sport, so introduce me to something you’re interested in too—let’s make it a way of sharing our little worlds with each other.

Dreaming of someone who:
- Doesn’t just say “hi” but knows how to keep a conversation going and has a curious mind (bonus points if you’re as random as I am!)
- Bonus if you’re from the yellow school (matic paskuhan date chz)
- Ideally from NCR so we can meet for coffee and long walks; in short, I’m not down for LDRs
- Has a warm heart, patient, and accepting of my quirks, late-night study sessions, and school stress
- I’d prefer someone taller, but honestly, the vibe matters.

If you’re someone who’s looking to build something real, someone who’s up for the small moments and big dreams, let’s make this connection one that we both look forward to every day.

You don't think that I wouldn't tell all you'll be coming for the holidays? Tell me you're coming, or invite me over, I'll book my tickets and will tell all.

I don't hide you. Far from it. Everybody close to me knows my feelings for you. I do love you. In case you wonder or are doubting. You aren't an option. You're my first choice.

I think you're sensing my hurt. I can't get away from it and won't hide it. This situation scares me. It feels dangerous. Let's diffuse, resolve and reconnect. 

Picture this:
You - sitting by the window, cup of coffee, conjuring up another of your fantastic pieces, and thinking about what you'll conquer next.
Me - Dancing and singing in the next room. Putting some finishing touches to my project and getting ready to distract you by plenty squeezing your shoulders or hugging you from behind.
Us - The warm inside will make us forget it's winter outdoors. Some much we can gain in a short amount of time.
Reality - This could be our reality in a matter of days or weeks.

So I'm not being cold or silent, I just don't want to give too much hope to a situation that feels unlikely. But I do want it. I just can't want it for you.

Now you know. It's the truth.
I hope you believe it, even if it's hard to, please know that I mean every word.

So, dummy, will you official be my baby? And, I mean this in/for real life ☺️
Will you spend this year's holiday period with me? 
If there are any difficulties, then let me know. We can work together to find the best solution(s).

Let me know. Preferably soon please.

1grycn4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1grycn4/advice_requested_on_breaching_this_topic_urine/,Advice requested on breaching this topic (urine accidents),"Hi, I am looking for some advice on how to approach this topic with my mother. We have a good relationship but my mother is denial about a lot of things, she has been having ""accidents"" a lot these past years but she refuses to wear something like pads and it is stressing me out.

Why is it stressing me out? When she sleeps over I have to literally towel and clean everything! I just found out I have to clean every layer of bedding down to the matrass because of a stain, I clean up the floor of the toilet and the walkway all the way to the bed where she sleeps because when she gets up at night to pee there are drops everywhere and it stinks of urine. Every seat she has been sitting smells of urine. I've had to run the washingmachine multiple times for her underwear (she goes through 8 slips in 2 days) and pants which were covered with urine. We had a day at the theatre and her entire pants were soaked and it was embarrassing.

I love her to bits, but this is getting out of hand. The same happens at her house and I don't think she even smells the stench anymore because she is so used to it. I tried breaking the subject many times before but she always says: of I just have to pee more because of my diabetic meds, it's the meds that's it. I don't want to wear pads because it makes me feel old, I feel like I am too young to be wearing them (she turns 70 next year and she is very active still).

We finally got to the point where she bought the actual pads, but she then leaves them lying around and doesn't wear them. She forgot to bring them while staying over at my place. I am seriously considering buying a pack and stashing them here.

I feel incredibly frustrated and I don't want to sound malicious or anything, but how can I AGAIN broach this subject without her becoming upset. She becomes upset not because this happened but well.. I don't know why. She really ignores the problem, has no issue walking around with urine drenched pants (yes she is aware that they are drenched, she doesn't have dementia) and waves it off like it is nothing. If she gets upset she says things like ""Oh I will leave then!"" and never understands the issue. ""I can clean that!"" is what she says when she catches me cleaning the floors, but she doesn't prioritize it at all and doesn't make an effort: it stinks, if I have to use the toilet I am standing in her urine drops and when she does clean it she grabs one of my new towels and rubs it down with some water and that is it, afterwards it still smells and I have to redo it anyway (it takes forever before she even moves, first coffee and breakfast and everything else and then she will clean maybe, meanwhile I can't even use the bathroom). Any carpet has to be scrubbed by hand with cleaning supplies, not a nice thing to be doing at 6AM!

It took me months to even convince her to buy those pads and now I have to try and persuade her again to wear them.

I am losing my mind over this, I am now washing all layers of my bedding and will have to sleep on the bare matrass because it will not be dry enough to reuse before nightfall.

What can I do? How can I broach this subject AGAIN without reacting too angry?  
Sorry for any misspellings, the autocorrect does it and I am still very riled up over this. She's out having a good time downtown doing her thing and I am left with this pigsty in my own bloody house.

Update:  
It is, but as feared things kind of escalated.  
She called me up right in the middle of cleaning up the bedding to ask me to pick up things down town, when I said I had no time I explained that I had to wash all the linnen an she went right into denial again: I was wearing a diaper, I was wearing pads, when I come home I am leaving. I told her that is not good and at first she agreed: I am going to do something about it but later she sort of spiralled and got very upset.

I was walking the dog and when I came back she was behaving very distraught, like an upset child almost, carrying all her belongings and snapping at me to put the dog in the car. Then she proceeded to tell me in an upset manner: it was the heater, you had me sitting at 17C all day and didn't turn up the heat and that causes my blader to have issues! Don't you know how I felt <during that theatre night> that evening?! I am going home before I say anything worse!

I tried explaining her that I didn't want her to leave on such bad terms, that I loved her and that I don't understand why she's being like this,s he said she's sorry and just drove off without saying anything. It really feels like it is on her, she's riled up over it and it invokes guilt in me over something I do not control. I never intended to argue over this, I never once raised my voice either and tried being compasionate but she just left me feeling awful over it.",1,1731683118.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

Maybe my title caught your eye, I'm kinda new to this whole r4r thing but I figured I'd give it a shot!!

I'm a busy college student in southern Ohio, feeling pretty lonely and just overall seeking a really good connection with someone! Like, REALLY good connection, I'm practically trying to find myself in another person :'D

I'm ultimately looking for my bestfriend, my ride or die, someone that just absolutely gets me, and I get them, you know?

Anywayyyy, here's a bit about myself!:

I'm a trans guy, I've been on testosterone for almost 4 years now and had top surgery! I'm also queer! I'm short, and I like to dress in an 80's / granola boy aesthetic! 

I'm really into nature, like REALLY into nature. I've kinda struggled with religion my whole life, but recently I've been connecting more with the fact that I have a strong connection to nature and everything in the universe, which maybe sounds dumb? But nature really gives me a lot of comfort, and I feel connected to everything which is so great- but also it HURTS to see how badly our planet is being treated :') I'm really passionate about the climate crisis and environmental protection!

People say I've got golden retriver energy, I get hyper and really excited sometimes, I love going on walks, receiving affection, and I also say the most random stuff, like I have no filter, but I've been told I'm funny because of it :3

I do have ADHD which makes me extra silly, and I also have anxiety that I manage pretty well :D

Some things I like are: drinking tea every morning with my breakfast, procrastinating school stuff by taking a nap on occasion, the journey across campus for a sweet treat, autumn, rustic/nature/cabin aesthetics, listening to music 24/7 to make the world around me much less scary, anddddd getting attention!

Okay sorry LOL some more conventional things I like are going on walks/hikes, video games, shows/movies (currently watching Beastars!), reading, Wikipedia rabbit holes, true crime (like the interviews on the YT channel EXPLORE WITH US), pinterest, anddd recently I've started getting into pokemon cards! :3 I currently just open virtual packs using Pokémon TCG Pocket because I'm broke currently LMFAO but I want to start collecting physical cards very soon >:3

Also, you could also say I'm a furry I guess? I mostly just like the art and silly little fursona drawings, and I chronically use :3 

I don't really want kids, and I dream of one day living in either Oregon or Washington, just somewhere in a blue state where I can keep my rights lol and also be close to a lot of forests and nature to explore!! My dream home is something rustic and durable, while also owning land to grow my own vegetables and be self sustaining in this INSANE world- (maybe unrealistic goal? but that's what a dream home is for!) Also, I really want a golden retriever :D

Phew! If you've read all that and you're still here, here's what I'm looking for!

I'm basically looking for someone really similar to me who I can connect with, talk about literally anything with, text, call, hangout with, play video games, watch movies, explore nature, get coffee or food with, etc. literally whatever! I wanna mutually rant about climate change and the devastating political situation of the country and controversial topics that we both share the same opinions on and just all the stuff like that! 

Hopefully you'd be patient, sweet, funny, gentle, not insane, actually able to text and communicate properly as if it's a conversation instead of that really painful dry texting that feels like I'm texting a robot 😭😭 also like.. I hope you smell really good and also like having a clean space, because I CANNOT deal with super messy or gross spaces or bad smells- I've got a really sensitive nose :'D

Aside from that, I figure the right person will just magically find me 🙏 (PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE IVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU)

SO! If you felt like you really related and connected with what I've written, send me a chat with an introduction of yourself and who you are as a person!! I'll be here :3",1,1731682988.0,r4r,1,0.67,False

1. SSD - 512GB or 1TB
I’m leaning towards 1TB due to photo/video editing although some people have told me not needed due to ability to have external SSD. Any opinions on that?

2. Screen size - 14 or 16 inch? I like my current 15 inch size but considering in sacrificing 1 inch of screen for portability reasons. Although, everything that I’m hearing sounds like I should stick with the larger model due to fans, speakers, and an extra inch of screen real estate. Any additional opinions? 

3. Nanotexture / No nano - mostly just do web browsing, video playback, photo/video editing, and finance work on my computer and most of the time inside an office/home/coffee shop/airport. Probably don’t need the nano, but people have been raving about it so not sure if anyone had difference of opinion here?

Why is it that Vee telling Javi that kail was pregnant is somehow unforgivable even though Kail shit on Vee for YEARS

Why do you guys think all of kails exes are obsessed with her if they ever comment on anything but she can call them out by name on EVERY single podcast she records. She referenced sex with Chris in the first 5 minutes of coffee convos this week but if he mentions her name everyone goes wild and tells him to get over her

She calls out everyone around her for making their money off her “back”… she exploits all of them on her podcast WEEKLY. Called out Lauren by name in today’s podcast for making money off her back … the woman sells Arbonne on instagram and has never used kails name once, she’s making it sound like she makes a living selling stories to tabloids

I got frustrated trying to find good coffee places whilst I was travelling. Every place seemed to have 4.3 - 4.7 star reviews. When I looked in detail, there were people rating these venues based on all kinds of things that were irrelevant to me (matcha, food etc.)

I wanted somewhere that had a rank ordering on narrow topics so I could compare more effectively. 

I built this website to use an Elo scoring system, like in chess, to do this. Elo uses head-to-head rankings to get more accurate results than the general 4 or 5 star ratings that people usually give. It is also faster to respond to changes (e.g. new management) and allows for comparison between places even if no one has directly rated those venues head-to-head.

  
I also wanted to make it so people could make their own ranking competitions, so they could get feedback on whatever is most important to them. For me it is coffee, for someone else maybe it is a quiet place to sit and work. Or maybe someone is interested in something completely different, e.g. ranking the [best finance films](https://rankster.xyz/competition/best-finance-films).

I'll be the first to admit the website isn't great, still a lot of work to do to make it nice, but it would be good to know if anyone finds it interesting. Thanks!

1grxqe2,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1grxqe2/ro_untitled/,[RO] Untitled ,"She was a barista at one of those fancy cafés in the city. Her name was Emily. She always had this bright smile on her face. She came to my table and asked.



\- Want something?

\- Yes, I'd love caramel latte.

\- Would you be interested in some pie too? I recommend our apple pie I baked it this morning.



I looked at the crumbs at her shirt. She noticed, blushed heavily and quickly turned back.



\- I recon It had to be really good.

\- It's the best in town.

\- Then I gotta try it. Please add it to my order.



She nodded and went to prepare my coffee. After a quick wait Emily came back with my order.



\- Is this seat taken?



I didn't even look at woman who asked that question, I could recognise this voice everywhere. I took out two hundred dolar bills and gave them Emily.



\- Thanks Emily, I love talking to you but could you please leave us alone now. No need for change.



She bowed and left.



\- Quite a tip that was Johny. You must like that barista.

\- She's nice, she knows how to not intrude in someone's personal space.



I looked into her azure eyes, she obviously had a job for me. I could read her like an open book. She was playing with gold ring on her hand. Big round emerald looked especially pretty on her pale skin. She was desperate.



\- You're not accusing your boss of stalking her employe of course?

\- How could I. It's just weird how often we meet outside work.

\- It's a small town.



We sat in silence for few minutes. I finished my coffee and stabbed cake with small fork. I looked at my boss sitting uncomfortably in front of me. I looked at the Emily and called her to the table with small nod.



\- How can I help?

\- Could I ask for another serving of this cake for my friend here?

\- Sure, please wait a minute.



Soon enough Emily got back with another piece of cake. I gestured at my boss to go ahead. She nodded and took first bite. Her sad and uncomfortable look instantly changed into big honest smile.



\- So... Why did you look for me?

\- I did not...

\- Yeah as always. So what is it?

\- We must get some insider info from this one conference in LA.

\- Sure.



I said unbothered.



\- Just like that?

\- Yeah, on one condition.



She started nervously playing with her right earring and looking outside the window on the left.



\- What is it?



I smiled slightly. I already knew I had her. She was desperate.



\- You need to go with me Angela.

\- It's not possible.

\- Oh it sure is. You'd make some time. I'll be waiting for the call.



I took that last bite, left 50 dollars on the table and left. Two hours later I got a call.



\- John?

\- Mhm.

\- I'll go.

\- Good I'll pick you up 9pm.



When I arrived in front of her apartment she was already standing there. Angela had beautiful maroon lips and black wavy hair. I got out of the car and opened the door for her.



\- Stunning dress.

\- Thank you John. I see that you wore your favourite suit for today.



I got back into car and gently drove off. Soft hum of V8 barely disturbed the quiet ride to the venue. Once we arrived I gave her small earphone.



\- Who's our handler today John?

\- Denise. She's on channel 9.

\- Let's do radio check.



She put on the earphone and switched into the channel.



\- Angela to Denise do you read me?

\- Denise here loud and clear. Let's go over your backstory for today.

\- I'm Ana María Martínez I'm cartel's accountant here to strike deal with local mafioso Vincenzo Moretti.

\- What cartel?



Angela visibly turned pale.



\- I remembered 5 minutes ago.

\- And that could have been your demise. You must be sure of such details.

\- It's all right Denise, it's not her first.

\- She spend two years at desk. I told you she's rusty.

\- She's not. Unit Alpha 2 code 10-23 at the venue, standing by.



I opened the glove box and gave Angela new phone, credit card and gun.



\- Gun?

\- Unregistered one, another addition to your cover.

\- I only get small glock while you get to keep uzi under suit's jacket

\- What can I say, life's not fair.



I got out of the car and gave keys to Hotel clerk.



\- Welcome Ms. Martinez. And welcome Mr. Morales. Please deposit your firearm at the front desk.

\- No.



Clerk went pale. He never expected to hear rejection. His hand was reaching to localise the panic button.



\- May I ask why?

\- Due to Ms. Martinez position she prefers to keep armed security close.

\- I understand. Still our hotel is one of the safest in the state.



I took out small roll of 100 dollar bills.



\- To compensate for this inconvenience.



He took the bills and gave me the card.



\- Room 2137.



We walked into elevator and pressed the button. After quick ride we saw our room. It was big penthouse with rooftop pool. I took Angela's coat and hanged it on the hanger.



\- I shall commence room safety check Ms. Martinez.

\- Go ahead Pedro.



I went through all rooms and checked them for wires. Room seamed clear but we still kept our cover. It was going to be a long weekend playing a security guard / errand boy.



\- When are we meeting buyer Pedro?

\- 12 am tomorrow.

\- Great. Now fetch me bottle of Château.



Great, looks like role of ruthless crime princess is natural to her. With my luck imma end up as personal sex toy in no time. Though it sure gonna keep our cover story solid. 



\- Denise to Unit Alpha 2. Two cars, bmw m4 with four armed suspects and maybach with heavy tint.

\- Looks like we have visitors Ana.

\- Our buyer?

\- They heaven't texted me about any early visits.



Angela took out her gun from holster on her thigh. I wore my uzi on my back under the jacket.



\- Waiting for visual identification. Target Moretti in the lobby.

\- Great. Not announced visit. I love those.

\- John to Beta one, I need your status

\- Beta one on position, standing by.



Okay Ana put back your gun its probably this shitty Italian way of saying hi.



\- Target in the elevator, heading your way unit one.



I heard knock on the door. I opened the door slightly, and instantly got pushed back as Moretti and his guys made their way into the room.



\- Mr. Moretti? I thought we were supposed to visit tomorrow.

\- We were. But Uncle Luciano doesn't trust you Ms. Martinez. We ran your papers them little lacking. So we called our friends at La Familia.

\- Why should I care pendeja?

\- Why so harsh. Our friends told us some good words about you Ana Martinez. We want to renegotiate our deal.

\- There is nothing to negotiate Vincenzo. Luciano already struck a deal with my boss.

\- Maria, such beautiful name. Why are you so stiff bella? You there, Pedro! get us some of that vine.



I stayed still. Angela nodded to me. I poured a glass for Vincenzo.



\- Everyone out.



Said Vincenzo and all his people left. He looked at me but I stayed still.



\- Ana?

\- Eh.. You too Pedro.



I walked out to the lobby.



\- How's the day fellas?



I had no answer.



\- Should I throw a joke about a pineapple pizza or would it be to gross?



I heard a silent chuckle of one of Vincenzo guys.



\- My boss is really on the edge about this deal. I was to visit my folks tomorrow after the meet but it seems we're out of luck.

\- You'll have time...

\- Perdo.

\- You'll have time Pedro. Our boss just came early cos his daughter has wedding tomorrow.

\- Silenzio Tony.



I bowed apologetically to the second one.



\- Sure I'm not pressing.

\- Denise to John, deal is up. You need to bring money from room 2140, Unit Beta notified.



I soon got a call from Ana. Just as those two from Vincenzo crew.



\- I'm guessing you two are my escort?

\- You're goddamn right.



We walked in silence. I stopped behind room 2140 door and knocked some made up rhythm. Agent Carter opened the door, he was wearing loose unbuttoned shirt and glued on moustache with glasses. He looked like real junkie.



\- Got everything?

\- You already know Pedro my dude.

\- Great, now piss off.



I took suitcase from him and showed the insides to Vince guys. They nodded and let me back into my room.



\- I like your dog. He's quite obedient one.

\- Pedro's one of my most trusted guys.



I placed suitcase on the table. Vincenzo looked inside and smiled. Then he called one of his guys with similar suitcase.



\- Fresh from restaurant for fresh from cartel.

\- Exactly, now show me the bills.

\- What there is to look at?

\- I need to check if they're clean.

\- As clean as they get. All from pizza and taxi.



Ana opened the suitcase and checked random bills. Then she counted estimate.



\- It's 20K short.

\- Call that provision, any problem?

\- Boss wont be happy.

\- Then explain your boss that we clean your money then we can set rates.

\- 20K is unacceptable.

\- Not like you have better offer.

\- What about Chinese?



Vince got stunned. He didn't think we'd talk to those crazy bastards. And he was right, we never consulted them but Vince couldn't knew that. He rushed over here once his daughter reminded him of her wedding tomorrow. It's hard to lead life of crime and to be present father.



\- They.. Well you won't get better rates.

\- 10K Vince and we're set.

\- No 15K or no deal.

\- 12K and you can keep rest of the vine.

\- Deal.

\- Lovely making business with you Vince.



Vince stood up, took suitcase and walked out. Angela sighed loudly and so did I. It was hella close.



\- Alpha one to Denise, deal successful, target Vincenzo Moretti left the scene.

\- Understood, Delta one tailing target now. Preparing for arrest.

\- Denise to John, wait 15 minutes and get out of the hotel. We're meeting in extraction point in one hour.

\- Understood, over and out.



Angela closed the door.



\- Angela to Denise, make that two hours. We suspect Vince has more guys at hotel.

\- Permission granted, see you at 2am at extraction point.



I was surprised. I never saw any Vince guys aside from those that left with him. I started walking to the door. Angela grabbed my waist and pushed me to the wall.



\- Looks like we have some time on hand.

\- We should check up with Beta.

\- Shhh! We are still at the hotel it can be tapped.

\- But they are arresting Vince right now.



She slapped me lightly on the cheek. I never saw her face this close, her maroon lipstick and those azure eyes you could get lost at.



\- Angela..



She kissed me passionately, her warm, soft lips tasted like strawberry. She had this strong hypnotising flowery smell. It was like kissing mother nature herself.



\- I want you John.



She took out her earphone then removed mine.



\- Do you want me?

\- I do Angela.



She slapped me harder.



\- Say it properly.

\- I want you Angela.

\- Do you need me John?

\- I need you Angela.



She kissed me again, but this time only briefly. She ripped off my shirt.



\- Undress John.



I tried to touch her dress zipper but the slapped my hand off.



\- You haven't earned it yet. Now carry me to the bed.



I grabbed her and carefully carried to the bed.



\- Adore me.



I kneeled and took her left foot. I removed her black heels. And gently kissed her feet. She looked amused. It's like she was provoking me to go harsher. I reached for the zipper again. She instantly flipped me onto bed.



\- Not yet.



She unzipped my pants and run her hands over my chest and arms. She kissed my chest, then my neck then she bit my ear gently.



\- What a big boy you are. Quite a treat indeed.



She whispered softly.



\- Can I...

\- Yes you can.



I finally removed zipper of her dress. Her body was as beautiful as her face. She had soft skin and slim waist. I couldn't take my eyes off her. She was stil smiling as I heavily blushed. It amused her. She slowly and painfully run her sharp nails across my sternum down to my waist. It was like she was making an incision.



\- What now then? Wanna go forward John? I'm waiting.



I quickly switched positions. I pinned her to bed and unclipped her black bra. Her chest was stunning. I blushed even more. She switched positions again.



\- Aren't you shy Sgt. John. I thought FBI's star wouldn't be a kissless virgin. What a great news, to add agent superstar to my collection.



I wanted to say something but I couldn't find any suitable words. She had me in the palm of her hand, and frankly I was beginning to like that.



\- Let's see that beast then. Woah, rumours didn't lie you truly pack a big one in here. Let's see if you can wield it as well.



She took off her black panties. Grabbed my thing and showed me inside. It felt different that I thought can't really say if I was positively surprised or disappointed. What can say though is that I let her take the lead. She was great, she knew what makes me feel good and what didn't. She read me like a book and used me skilfully. It was the best experience I ever had. I came like two or three times. I don't know I felt too light headed. But then suddenly she told me it's over and I should shower. I slowly stumbled inside. She pinned me to the wall again but this time lighter.



\- Ey. No passing out man. I know it was much for the first time but now we have to leave the place.

\- Mhm.



She was so sweet. It was like she was a different person. When I got out and got my senses back I asked her why is that.

&#x200B;

I sat on a log exhaling a fog, feeling like a trapped, muzzled dog.

As I rocked back and forth and rubbed my torso in a futile attempt to stay warm inside the chilly woodshed, clouds of hot breath pushed through my gauze mask and swirled upward. I despised having my face covered, and fantasized about lifting my mask and breathing freely again like a normal person.

Johnny the tree trunk goaded me. 

*“You don’t have the nerve to do it, do you? You’re a spineless piece of garbage.”*

*“The hell, I don’t. Watch me.”*

*“Okay, Fat-Ass, I’m waiting. And I’ll be waiting forever. Because you don’t have the balls. No pun intended.”* 

*“Fuck you!”*

*“Come on, Roger, enough with this bullshit. Fuck it, man — what do you have to lose? Do it. Nobody will ever know. Let’s go! FUCKING DO IT”!*

With an apprehensive glance toward the cabin, I did it — I lifted the stifling mask from my face and sucked in cool, refreshing oxygen. For more than an hour, I’d been struggling to breathe while pathetically sitting on a log and peeking out the shed door, hoping someone would summon me. Having my pathways clear from the gauze barrier was exhilarating, and for a moment I felt happy and free.

But then my wimpy side took over. I glanced at Johnny and averted my gaze, being too ashamed to maintain eye contact with the sourpuss of a tree trunk.

With a sigh, I admitted defeat. 

*“I … I guess I’d better put this damn thing back on. What if he catches me?”*

*“How’s he gonna catch you, Fat-Ass? The cabin’s 20 yards away and it’s getting dark. Nobody can see inside the shed.”*

*“But, why take a chance? Kurt would hit the roof if he saw me disobeying a direct order! If it’s okay with you, I’d rather not get my ass kicked in front of Alena’s whole family. You know?”*

*“Alrighty then, go ahead. Obey your master, you lowdown piece of garbage. Just remember what you are. What you’ll always be. You’re a fat, lowdown piece of garbage. Your own mother knew it. Didn’t she?”*

*“Y-yes.”*

*“Your own MOTHER. She threw your fat ass away like a rotten banana peel.”*

*“I … I know.”* 

*“Poor Roger. I know it sucks to be you, but oh, well. Some people just don’t get the breaks in this world, do they?”*

*“No.”*

*“Nope. Poor you. Now, be a good little bitch and put that mask back on. Stay in your place.”*

I fixed the hated gauze over my face and cast a doleful glance toward the cabin. 

Johnny scoffed. 

*“Those people inside are better than you, aren’t they Roger?”*

*“Y-yes.”*

*“Damn right they are. Remember what your master told you? That you’re not good enough for Elena?”*

*“Yes.”*

*“Kurt’s not the brightest guy on the planet, but he has a bully’s instinct, and can spot a beta-bitch a mile away. The big palooka can hardly spell his own name, but he totally understands your sorry-ass psyche, doesn’t he?”*

*“Y-yes.”*

*“Yes, he does. He knows. He knows how low your self-esteem is … how desperate you are to please Elena, and how badly you want to keep her in your life. He uses that against you, because he’s a bully, and he loves having a little faggot to push around. And your wife is so head-over-heels in love with him, she’ll go along with anything he does. She always treated you like shit, but seeing how you kowtow to Kurt has caused her to totally lose respect for you.”*

*“I … I know. It fucking sucks, Johnny.”*

*“It doesn’t suck for her, does it? It turns her on like crazy to see Kurt bully you. Right?”*

*“Um … yes. She gets … um, really horny when he’s mean to me.”*

*“Well, see? You’re not completely worthless, are you? If you’re able to play a part in her sexual satisfaction, that has to count for something. Know what I mean, Rog?”*

*“Uh, yeah, I guess.”*

*“But you know there’s a downside to it. Right? Every time she sees you cowering like a fat, little bitch in front of her masculine lover, it causes her to lose that much more respect for you — and she never had much to start with. And if she doesn’t respect you now, how do you think she’s gonna see you after you get castrated because her boyfriend told you to?”*

*“I … I don’t know.”*

*“Aw, poor Roger. You know you’re gonna go through with it. You don’t want to lose Elena, so we both know you’ll end up doing it. Imagine that, Rog; pretty soon, you’re gonna be a eunuch! A EUNUCH! Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!”*

After the laughter subsided, Johnny continued sneering at me, but he refrained from further comment. That was fine by me; the crotchety, old bastard was getting on my nerves. 

My hand drifted to my crotch, and for the thousandth time I caressed my testicles and sobbed. Kurt had ordered me to set up the orchiectomy as soon as possible, so I made a mental note to call a doctor first thing the following Monday. I knew nothing about the process, and wondered whether I’d have to pretend I wanted to become trans, or if I could simply walk in and ask the doc to cut my balls off. I hadn’t researched the matter earlier, hoping Kurt had been kidding around, and I was trying not to think about it. But since coming to the cabin, I’d learned he wasn’t joking — he really did want me to become a eunuch, and he’d ordered me to set up the operation. Every time I thought about it, I felt like puking.

Finally, after what seemed like hours, the cabin door swung open and Taylor poked her head out.  
   
 

“Hey, Lard-Ass! Get in here, my ma wants you!”

I nearly fell down as I scrambled to obey. 

Taylor had left the door open a crack and rejoined her family in the living room, where the sated alphas lounged before the crackling fire. I took note of the mountain of dirty plates on the dining room table.

Linda took charge as soon as I ambled into the cabin. “The first thing you need to do is put the leftovers in the fridge, and then clear the table and do the dishes,” she ordered from the comfort of her overstuffed chair.

“Yes, Ma’am,” I mumbled before hopping into action.

As I worked, my superiors continued a conversation they’d obviously been having about Elena’s relationship with Kurt.

“We talked about getting married,” my wife said, leaning toward her lover on the couch and squeezing his knee. “But the way things stand now, there’s really no point. Maybe later.”

Blood drained from my face when I heard that, but I continued clearing the table, maintaining a stoic expression so I wouldn’t be caught eavesdropping.

Linda took a sip of coffee. “Well, it would be nice for my daughter to have a nice, romantic wedding.” She scoffed in my direction. “Their wedding was a joke. Everyone knew it was for money. It was kind of embarrassing, to tell the truth.”

Elena sat forward with a frown. “What was embarrassing about it? So, I married for money — there’s no need to make me feel bad about it, Ma. I already feel bad enough about marrying the slob. You know that.”

With a wince, I scooted to the kitchen with an armful of leftovers to put away, but I kept my ear cocked toward the door so I could hear the budding family squabble.

“I wasn’t trying to make you feel bad about it, honey, I’m sorry,” Linda said. “But you’re so beautiful, and Roger is so …”

“Fat!” Rachel cut in.

“And ugly!” her sister added, prompting a chorus of chuckles.

Linda sighed. “I didn’t mean to insult you, Elena. I’d never do that. But on your wedding night, do you know how many of my friends asked me, ‘What’s she doing with HIM?’”

“Ugh, I’m sorry, Ma. It was embarrassing enough for ME to be getting married to him; I hate it that you were embarrassed too. I wish your damn friends would’ve kept their mouths shut.”

Tom added: “I was embarrassed because these two idiots wouldn’t stop giggling.”

Rachel and Taylor cracked up.

I put the leftovers into the fridge, recalling how the twins, who were then 14 years old, chortled throughout the wedding ceremony. Later, during the reception, they kept making fat jokes, and references to whales and hippos, setting the tone for our future relationship. Tom and Linda pretty much ignored me that night, making it clear they didn’t approve of me marrying their daughter. But I didn’t care, because my beloved had officially become Mrs. Elena Susan Chalmers.

As I walked back toward the dining room to retrieve the dirty dishes from the table, I recalled our disaster of a wedding night, when I tried to fuck my new bride but came on her leg before I was able to enter her, prompting her to roll over and fall asleep.

Everyone looked up when I waddled in from the kitchen.

“Hey, Tubby,” Kurt called, holding up his empty glass. “How about a refill on this eggnog? And don’t go light on the rum, either.”

“Yes, sir,” I replied as I scooted toward the couch, aware that my wife was scowling at me.

“I’m so glad I don’t have to pretend to care about you anymore,” she said as I accepted her lover’s glass. “No more of those stupid work meetings, where you show me off to all those bigshots.”

Kurt snorted. “You mean Tubby here was trying to be the Mack Daddy in front of all his work buddies? That’s hilarious.”

“Ugh, it was sickening. I’d have to smile at his stupid jokes, and act like I was the ‘woman behind the man.’ Everything’s fake in those big corporations; all those rich guys have to put up a façade. Half of ‘em are probably gay.”

“How’s that gonna work now, with you and Kurt seeing each other out in the open?” Tom asked as I scurried toward the kitchen to retrieve Kurt’s refill.

“I don’t care,” Eleana said. “I told Roger he can tell those assholes at the firm we got divorced — or tell them I have a boyfriend, for all I care. I’m not doing that fake crap anymore; I love Kurt and I’m not gonna hide it. I don’t care how much money it costs.”

“Ooh, that’s so romantic,” Taylor gushed. Her twin squealed in agreement. 

“Well, it’s nice to see you following your heart for a change, instead of going for money,” Linda told her daughter. 

Kurt pulled my wife closer and smirked. “Shit, ol’ girl here don’t care about money — she was gonna divorce Tubby, even though it would’ve cost her a shitload of money. But, like I said, everything changed when the fat loser begged me to let her stay married to him. It’s only on paper, so fuck it; what do we care?”

“As long as the loser sleeps in the garage, huh, Kurt?” Rachel added with a titter.

“That’s not all he has to do,” Kurt slurred as I entered the room with his second alcohol-infused eggnog. 

Elena frowned at her lover. “Honey? You sure you want to tell them?”

“Shit, I told Tom already,” Kurt replied as I handed him his drink.

Tom chuckled. “What? You talking about his balls?”

“OMG, Dad, he told you?” Elena squirmed from her lover’s grip and sat up straight.

“Yes, he told me — and I think it’s hilarious.” Tom flashed a paternal smile. “You think your mother and me are way more old-fashioned than we are, honey.”

My wife looked at her mother. “Did Dad tell you, too?”

Linda smirked. “Of course, he did. And I think it’s a great idea.”

“WHAT’S a great idea?” Rachel asked.

“Yeah, what are you guys talking about?” Taylor demanded.

Tom started to reply, but Kurt cut him off.

“Hey, Numb-Nuts, why don’t you tell the twins what you’re planning to do?” my wife’s lover asked with a smirk.

I shifted from one foot to the other, my gaze cast downward. “Um … I have to … I have to … be cast … rated.” The last word wobbled.

Rachel held her hand over her mouth. “Castrated? OMG, are you kidding me?”

“Yep,” Kurt leaned back on the couch with a smug look on his face. “Like I told your dad — I want it like they had back in the old Roman emperor days, when they made the queen’s slaves into eunuchs.”

Elana rolled her eyes and playfully nudged her lover’s ribs. “This one’s so possessive. I told him there’s nothing to worry about; Roger isn’t exactly stiff competition in the man department.”

“Sounds like he won’t be ‘stiff’ anything pretty soon,” Tom quipped, and everyone laughed at the insult.

Taylor cocked her head and searched my eyes. “And you’re gonna have this done because you love my sister so much?”

I gulped. “Um, yes, Miss.”

“I think it’s kinda romantic,” Taylor said.

“Pfft, it’s pretty pathetic, if you ask me,” Rachel replied. “Aren’t you embarrassed about being my sister’s simp?”

Kurt answered for me: “Nah, ol’ Rog loves his life. Don’t you, Rog?”

“Yes, sir.”

“You make an appointment to get the operation yet?”

“Um, no, sir.”

“And why the fuck not?”

“Um, sir, after we talked about it, sir, I … I was busy digging, and then my cellphone’s battery died, sir, so I wasn’t able to research it and find a place. I plan on doing it first thing Monday, sir. But … uh, I’m not even sure how it works, sir.”

“What do you mean?” My master frowned. “You’re not sure how WHAT works?”

“Um, sir, I … I don’t know if I can just go into a clinic and ask to be castrated, or if I’d have to tell them I’m trans. I know for sure they do it for trans people, but I’m not sure—”

“Eww, can you imagine Lard-Ass as a woman?” Taylor shuddered.

“Oh, I don’t know,” her mother mused. “If he grew his hair out, he’d kind of look like an ugly Kathy Bates.”

“You mean that fat lady from ‘Titanic?’” Rachel asked before busting out laughing, while the rest of the family joined in, leaving me standing there with a red face and a hollow soul.

When the merriment faded, Linda made a suggestion that felt like a kick to my still-intact nuts.

“Seriously, why not make him become a trans?” My mother-in-law looked at Elena and Kurt with an expression that said she wasn’t kidding. “You could tell everyone that’s why you left him: because he finally came out and wants to live as a woman. That way, you don’t look like the bad guy; you can tell everyone you’re letting him stay in your house, even though he’s the one who changed things up on you. Nobody will blame you for finding a real man.”

Rachel shook her head. “You’re only worried about what to tell your stupid friends, Ma.”

“Well, yeah, honey, I do care about what my friends think,” Linda replied. “It’s bad enough having everyone know my daughter married for money. No offense, Elena, but like I said, it was embarrassing.”

“It’s okay, Ma,” my wife said. “I understand.”

Linda smiled. “I love you, honey. Yes, I’m concerned about what people think; I guess I am old-fashioned in that respect. Being trans isn’t a huge deal anymore. And … well, I just don’t want everyone thinking my daughter is a gold-digger who dumped her husband for some big stud.”

As I stood there fighting back tears, I muttered to myself that my wife WAS a gold-digger who’d dumped me for some big stud.

Elena touched her lover’s hand. “I don’t know, honey. What do you think?”

Kurt rubbed his chin. “I don’t know … hey, Lard-Ass, you think you’d get fired if you became one of them trannies?”

I badly wanted to lie, but I found myself replying, “Um, no, Sir … there are two trans people in the firm.”

Kurt looked me up and down, his eyes dancing.

“Well, Linda, if it’ll make you happy, why not?” My master snorted. “He’ll be a fat, ugly bitch — but he’s a fat, ugly bitch anyway.”

As everyone laughed at the put-down, Elena curled her lip at me. 

“The more I think about it, the better this sounds,” she said. “I hate having you hanging around the house, even if you ARE sleeping in the garage, because it reminds me of how stupid I was to have married your pathetic ass. This way, the old you will be completely gone, and I can move on with my life. And, like Ma said, I don’t have to be the bad guy; everyone will think I’m wonderful for letting you stay around after you came out.”

I could no longer hold back my tears, and I started bawling and babbling incoherent syllables until my master held up his hand for silence.

“Quiet, Fat-Ass,” he ordered. “I know this is a lot for you to deal with right now, but you need to just shut the fuck up and start thinking of yourself as a tranny. Because that’s the way it’s going to be.”

“Otherwise, get the fuck out of here right now, and we’ll get divorce lawyers,” Elena said. “I’m not playing, Roger. You’ll do what he says. Got it?”

I bowed my head. “Yes, Ma’am.”

Taylor giggled. “What’s his female name gonna be?”

“Rogerina?” Rachel suggested, which caused Tom to spit out his coffee.

“More like Elsie the cow,” my mother-in-law said.

Taylor furrowed her brow. “Who’s Elsie the cow?” 

“She used to be on the milk cartons, honey,” Linda said.

“Hmmm … Elsie,” Kurt mused before turning to his girlfriend. “What do you think, honey?”

“I don’t give a shit,” she said. “Call him ‘Moo-Moo’ for all I care; as long the old Roger is gone.”

Tom rolled over laughing. “OMG, Moo-Moo is perfect!”

“It IS perfect!” Linda added as the twins slapped their knees.

Kurt’s lips tightened. “I dunno … that might fuck him up at work. Tell you what, Fat-Ass: When you change your name, you’ll make your first name Elsie, and your middle name Moo-Moo. They can call you Elsie at work, and we’ll call you Moo-Moo at home. You hear?”

“Y-yes, sir,” I sniffed, the tears now freely flowing.

“Oh, stop your goddamn drama,” my wife said, settling back into her lover’s arms. “Finish cleaning up and then get the hell out of here — Moo-Moo.”

Tom smirked. “It’s a good 25 miles to the bus station. You gonna make him walk?”

“Fuck yes, he can walk,” my wife said. 

Kurt added: “He needs to lose some weight if he wants to look good in a dress!”

Of course everyone is different but just wanted to throw my results into the mix in case it helps. For me: 

Best: Advil pain cream (soooo strong but helps me immensely), icy hot lidocaine patches at night, avoiding sugar and alcohol (this one is huge for me and when I slip up omg does my shoulder let me know at night), using shoulder heating pad in the morning and shoulder ice pack throughout the day, sleeping with multiple pillows strategically placed at night according to the YouTube video people have posted here. 

Meh: PT exercises (I feel like these make my pain significantly worse but might help my ROM a tiny bit), Advil (helps a lot but I started having kidney pain so had to quit and save it for the really bad nights only), Tylenol/Aleve (doesn’t do shit for me), avoiding caffeine (no noticeable difference but I do only have one cup of coffee per morning and don’t do soft drinks anyway), THC/CBD ointment. 

Ouch- TENS machine, massages of any type. These felt great at the time but seriously flare my shoulder for days afterward.

I'd really like a video about Spain and the food situation during WWII. As you know, the war in Europe started inmmediatly after the civil war, and Spain suffered a lot during this period. With the lack of food came the rationing and, or course, the clever recipes.

  
The book ""Cocina de recursos"", by Ignacio Doménech was published in 1941 and includes some of those recipes. Doménech was one of the greates cooks of the country and he wrote a lot of books before the war. He even worked at the Savoy with Escoffier at some point.

Another interesting book is ""Las recetas del hambre: La comida de los años de posguerra"" by David Conde and Lorenzo Mariano, wich covers some of those weird recipes and gives a look at the lives of the common people of that period and their hardships with food.

  
There are some interesting recipes, like the potatoless and eggless potato omelette, or the coffeeless coffee, made with peanuts.

  
I don't really know if this is the proper way to give suggestions on the channel, but maybe it will reach Max through here. 

There are also some other interesting characters for future videos, like María Mestayer, also know asthe marquesa of Parabere, or Eladia Martorell, also known as Carmencita la buena cocinera. Both of them were very influencial in their time, specially Carmencita. Her book was in many households in Spain, both my grandparents had a copy.",10,1731680661.0,TastingHistory,2,0.92,False

As a result my interest has always been piqued while reading about the Roman baths. Obviously the function of these places was not mainly for working out, although I know at the bigger ones there was space for musculation.

I’m also interested in how the baths functioned as a social space: how all classes of society mixed there, how (according to some graffiti I believe) people hooked up there, and how they were just very central to Roman social life for hundreds of years. The engineering aspect of the baths is also interesting to me.

All that to say: can any of you recommend me any books on Roman baths? I would even be quite interested in bigger “coffee table books” which might have large photos, etc.

Friends look up to you and seek your advice. You're supposed to dress and act a certain way—prude, innocent, pious, and pure.

But deep down, there's a wild side of you that's been repressed—collared, chained, and caged by the expectations and norms you were raised with. This inner conflict drives you crazy because of the hypocrisy you see.

You can't let this side of you out due to a fear of judgment or vulnerability.

You have a choice: stay in your current role, which is fine, or unleash yourself.

I'm here to help you explore those urges discreetly and without judgment. This might be your chance to let loose and be as daring as you want. When we’re done, you can return to your normal life with a secret grin that no one needs to understand—until you want to do it again.

Here's a general idea about me: 5'7"", moreno with a dad bod (yeah, yeah I'm working on it and working out), I look young for my age with a cool and hip personality. From one of the top 4 (Blue if it matters). During the day, I am a suit/barong wearing, coffee drinking motivational speaker and life coach. At night, the work clothes come off and I am equally comfy with jeans/shots, plain tees and a light beer. Anyway, travel because of work caused my separation and we settled the incident as mature adults, we are still friends to date. Details details details? Let's leave some things for convos in bed.

Not in the mood for steak? No worries – they’ve got everything from the crispy Pork Belly starter with maple glaze to the Vegan Mongolian Stew for those plant-based diners. Finish it with their Black Forest dessert – dark chocolate mousse and cherries soaked in kirsch, anyone?
