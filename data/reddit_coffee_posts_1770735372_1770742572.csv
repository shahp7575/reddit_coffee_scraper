I thought I didn't have to worry about black coffee. No cream, no sugar, basically no calories. No problem, right? Wrong! As it turns out, black coffee in the morning on an empty stomach raises cortisol, which raises blood glucose. The corresponding crash paired with skipping breakfast would leave me absolutely ravenous for carbs by lunch time.  

I recently got a blood glucose monitor, which is what clued me in to this. I thought I was doing the right thing by taking my coffee black. I thought I was doing the right thing by delaying food until lunch time. My desire to eat a huge bowl of noodles by that time was inexplicable. 

What was actually happening: after waking up and drinking my coffee, my blood glucose would shoot way up. Then, my body would release insulin to deal with that, and my blood glucose would plummet. These wild swings, on top of being bad for your health, have a big impact on hunger. I truly didn't realize it was possible to have such large swings without eating anything. Now I'm skipping the coffee and starting my morning with eggs instead. My blood glucose and hunger remain much more stable throughout the day. Everything feels much more manageable and physically I feel better.",4,1770742373.0,loseit,0,1.0,False

I'm into all kinds of different hobbies. I'm really into houseplants and aquarium keeping. I have over 100 different houseplants. I just got a small greenhouse now, too. I'm in the process of setting up a fish tank room. I have 4 tortoises that also live in the fish tank room until I build them an outside enclosure. I also have one cat and one dog too.

I've been drinking a lot of tea and coffee lately. Always like new suggestions for both. I'm trying to slowly get into doing more and more homesteading. I've started making my own breads and want to start making different jelly when it's warm enough for my berry bushes to produce

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Overwatch, Marvel Rivals, Valorant, and Ark Suvival Ascended. Love playing Pokemon games and doing some Pokémon card collecting, too.

**Why This Pick?**

The Lakers could be wildly short-handed for this game, friends. Luka Doncic is out for the evening, and I wouldn’t be surprised if both Austin Reaves and LeBron James get rested on the back-to-back with the All-Star break on the horizon. Meanwhile, the Spurs have won their last 4 straight games and all by at least 9 points. I know the Lakers are at home, but this is a great spot for San Antonio to pick up a double-digit victory. My money’s on the Spurs to cover.

But when it comes to our household he’s the same, or worse. He works, and expects me to keep the house up to his standard because I don’t work at the moment.

Past six months he’s been distant, moody for no apparent reason, I was thinking midlife crisis and I have tried to approach the subject many times but he gets really defensive, so I drop it.

Turns out, he was mad all along because he thinks I’m a bad stay at home wife, and I’m like, what the fuck!? That shit hurt me, bad.

I know this is thin ice to walk as a woman, seeing how men were breadwinners for a long time, but let me share what I do, and what he does.

When he comes home from work he watches tv for a while, or reads a book, winds down from work. Then he sits down and eats the food I cooked (I’m a decent home chef), and then goes back to the screen or his book while I do the dishes.

Before he comes home I have made sure the laundry is done, grocery shopping, general house cleaning like picking up his and the kids’ clutter. Every surface is clean, and the home is ready for guests at all times. Generally very clean and tidy. Not because he expects it, it’s just I’m at home all the time, shit gets boring, may as well clean up.

BUT, yes, I may leave a coffee cup on the kitchen counter, and no I don’t clean the kids’ rooms, they are almost grown up. Other than that I can’t really understand what more I can do.

Idk, I’m hurt. I asked him, who does he think he is, to be a person to set impossible standards where in my turn I am a person who follows it or not? I’m not an employee? I care for our home, I’m a good mom, I’m a loving, caring wife, a good provider, but I get shit in return, and it’s all because a coffee cup and a random toothpaste stain on the bathroom mirror?

Like I said, I used to work a lot, but being home has me doubting this shit, hard.

I’m thinking, what can I do better and what am I not seeing? Maybe I neglect him, you know? But no. It’s like I’m being mentally abused over putting the house key on the dresser in the hallway instead of on a hook where it “belongs”. Not attractive at all.

And for all of you thinking, there must be something else, I’m not telling the full story, please ask questions and I’ll try to answer. I had to really press my husband on this issue, like please help me, I can see something is wrong I just don’t know what. And I got hit with “I kept my mouth shut for months, but it bothers me that you rest all day and still can’t do household chores how I want them”. So? You stay at home then? And do them to your standard?

(Examples, I cannot wash socks together with underwear, bc it’s gross to him for some reason. Also I don’t water the plants, bc if I do I water one too much and another not enough. Sometimes I may have curtains cover a window bc of the sun, and don’t immediately pull them back when the sun has moved. I may do slow cooked meals so it smells too much of food when he comes home)

Writing this out makes me laugh actually. Have I created a monster?

Also, to the divorce mob on reddit, it’s not going to happen, I love my husband, like really actually love, for better and for worse. Just to have that said.",0,1770742078.0,WhatShouldIDo,2,0.33,False

Marriage between F60 and M60,"I (60F) have been with my husband (60M) for almost ten years. He’s a great guy. We are both kind and have fun together. Last year, he had to stop working due to medical issues. He is close to being approved for disability but it hasn’t come through yet. We moved to my sister’s house six months ago because I could no longer afford to pay all the bills. I work full time and he cooks, cleans, and tries to keep himself busy. Since the move, I’ve noticed him being secretive. He drinks more than he should but isn’t a sloppy drunk. He lies about the stupidest things all the time. Like finishing the last of the coffee or leaving lights on. Because money has been really tight, he shops but won’t let me see receipts or comes in with bags that he won’t let me look into. I have access to all of the finances so I know he’s isn’t blowing tons of money. For example, last night he added dried potatoes to a dish. Like the ones in a box of scalloped potatoes. We bought a big bag of potatoes at Costco so we had discussed using those. He was adamant that he used fresh and just sliced them thin. After dinner, I opened the trash can and saw the box ripped up and pushed down deep. I told him I saw the box. He said it was a joke. Obviously he didn’t cut them that thin. There are so many little lies that are so stupid.  Way more than I can recount here. Is he going a little crazy being home alone? I feel like this marriage is dying a death of a thousand cuts.

\# By: William H. Bosworth

It's now eight o' clock and little Jimmy is sent up to his room by his parents because it's little Jimmy's bed time. Along with his parents, he kneels next to his bed and starts to recite his prays. ""Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the lord my soul to keep, if I should die before I wake, I pray the lord my soul to take, if I should live for other days, I pray the lord to guide my ways. I walk through the shadow of the valley of death I shall fear no evil."" Little Jimmy has finished his prays and gets into bed. After twenty minutes has passed, little Jimmy is rolling around in bed having trouble getting to sleep. He calls out for his mother to bring him a warm glass of milk. His mother walks into his room with a glass of warm milk and says to little Jimmy, drink up, its pass your bed time. Little Jimmy does just that. He drinks the glass of milk and puts the glass on the night stand. All of a sudden from the far corner of his room, little Jimmy is beginning to hear tic, tock, tic, tock, tic, tock; but before little Jimmy gets the chance to see who is speaking, he falls asleep.

Saturday morning had arrived and little Jimmy awakes to the sound of his alarm clock going off. He gets out of bed yawning while dragging his feet to the bathroom to brush his teeth and take a shower. Once he is done, little Jimmy goes straight to the television to watch his Saturday morning cartoons. While watching his Saturday cartoons, little Jimmy notices something out of place. Its nine o' clock in the morning and little Jimmy notices that he wasn't smelling eggs cooking and toast burning. So, he gets up to see if his mom and dad are still sleeping in bed. So, he goes up stairs to check on his parents and see what the problem is. However, when little Jimmy went upstairs, he notices that not only that his parents aren't in their room, it looks as though they never slept in their bed. Not thinking twice about it, he goes back down stairs to see if his parents are in the backyard having their morning coffee. Once he is outside, once again he notices that his parents are nowhere to be found.

After checking outside, little Jimmy goes back inside and checks every room in the house looking for his parents. Room by room little Jimmy checks and soon realizes that his parents are nowhere to be found. He starts to feel very alone and very scared. Little Jimmy goes outside to one of his neighbors to see if they know where his parents are. Once he is outside, he notices something very peculiar. Little Jimmy notices that his neighborhood seems a little too quiet; especially for being a Saturday morning. Little Jimmy goes back into his house and upstairs into his room. Once he is in his room little

Jimmy closes the door, goes into a corner, and begins to cry. As soon as the first tear hits the ground, like magic, a munchkin of a man had appeared before him. When little Jimmy looks up to see who it was, little Jimmy was shocked, almost terrified by the appearance by this little man. This little munchkin of a man looks almost like he could be the creator from the dark side of the moon with its long fingers with even longer finger nails, razor sharp teeth that could slice a car door in half, pasty white skin, and long yellowish dingy hair

As little Jimmy tremble with fear in the corner of his room, he manages to ask the little munchkin for his name. In a most sinister way possible, the little munchkin replied, I'm the Sandman, the master of nightmares, and I'm here to haunt your dreams. When little Jimmy heard that, instantaneously little Jimmy became modified. Inch by inch the Sandman got closer and closer to little Jimmy's face. When their noses finally touched one another, with a whisper, the Sandman said, ""Boo"". In an instant, little Jimmy got up, ran over the Sandman and started to run down the stars screaming franticly for his mom and dad. As soon as he opens the front door to go outside, like magic, little Jimmy ends up going back in his bedroom. When little Jimmy realizes where he's at, his bedroom door violently closes behind him preventing him from living his room again. Closer and closer the Sandman comes near; more and more little Jimmy becomes scared. Tick tock, tick tock as the Sandman would say, sleeper and sleeper as little Jimmy would get. As little Jimmy eye lids become heavier and heavier, for some odd reason, little Jimmy starts to say his prayers, ""Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the lord my soul to keep, if I should die before I wake, I pray the lord my soul to take, if I should live for other days, I pray the lord to guide my ways. I walk through the valley of the shadow death I shall fear no evil. "" Over and over again swinging back and forth back and forth like little Jimmy is over come with fear; all of a sudden, coming out of the sandman's mouth, it's his mother's voice saying, Jimmy, wake up Jimmy, it's time to wake up.

In just an instant, little Jimmy wakes up as quickly as possible and starts to yell, don't eat me Sandman don't eat me. Little Jimmy sees his mother next to him and jumps into her arms crying franticly. Horrified, little Jimmy's mother asked him what the matter is. Little Jimmy told his mother about the nightmare that he had with the Sandman. As little Jimmy was telling his mother about the nightmare, his mother is just sitting there horrified about the nightmare but yet, confused. The reason for her disbelief is that after all her son is talking about the Sandman; the king of happy dreams and not the one who gives little children horrible nightmares. After little Jimmy's mother finally gets him to calm down, she sends him to the kitchen for breakfast. While little Jimmy is eating his bowl of Fruit Loops with his father, his mother goes over to the computer, to see if there's a thing as an evil Sandman. After a few minutes of looking, it turns out that there are in fact two Sandmen's. The first is a loveable huggable little man that puts kids to sleep and gives them happy thoughts while they slept. While the second, is basically the total opposite of the first. As she continues to read, it states that some people believe that the two Sandmen are brothers; while others believe that they are just two mythical creatures with the same name. As she is reading to her son, for some odd reason, little Jimmy's mother is hearing tick tock, tick tock, tick tock. She looks up only to see the Sandman jump towards her. Just before the Sandman bites her face off; little Jimmy wakes up in a horrible frantic. He looks to see if he sees the Sandman around. He gets out of bed and run-down stairs to see if his parents are down stairs. Once little Jimmy is down stairs, he sees is parents making breakfast. He then sighs in relief because he soon realizes that it was only a dream. Little Jimmy then sits down at the breakfast table and grabs his Captain Crunch Cereal box and opens it. BAM! Out of nowhere, a hand comes out of the cereal box, grabs little Jimmy by the face and pulls him through the cereal box and back into the dream world where he spends the rest of his life running from the Sandman.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1r15whj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConnectBetter/comments/1r15whj/how_to_tell_stories_that_make_people_obsessed/,How to Tell Stories That Make People OBSESSED With You: The Psychology That Actually Works,"Look, we've all been there. You're at a party, work event, or just hanging out, and someone starts telling a story. Within seconds, everyone's leaning in, laughing, totally captivated. Then you try to share something, and... crickets. People check their phones. Someone interrupts. It feels like shit.

Here's what I learned after diving deep into communication research, studying standup comedy techniques, and analyzing why some people just have that magnetic storytelling ability: most of us are terrible at telling stories because we were never taught how. We think storytelling is this natural talent you're either born with or not. That's bullshit. It's a skill, and like any skill, you can learn it.

I spent months researching this, from reading books by professional storytellers to analyzing psychology studies on narrative persuasion to watching hours of podcasts breaking down what makes stories stick. What I found is that charismatic storytellers follow specific patterns. They're not just ""naturally gifted."" They're using techniques that trigger specific responses in our brains.

The good news? Once you understand these patterns, you can literally rewire how people respond to you. Let's break it down.

## Step 1: Start In The Middle of The Action

The biggest mistake people make is starting their story with boring context. ""So last Tuesday, I was at this coffee shop, and I'd been having a rough week, and..."" Stop. No one cares yet. You haven't given them a reason to care.

Start with tension, conflict, or something weird. Drop people right into the most interesting moment, then fill in context later if needed.

Instead of: ""I went to a job interview last week...""
Try: ""So I'm sitting across from this CEO, coffee spilled all over my shirt, and she asks me the one question I wasn't prepared for...""

See the difference? The second version creates immediate curiosity. Your brain naturally wants to know what happens next. This technique is called in medias res (starting in the middle), and it's how every great movie, book, and TV show hooks you in the first 30 seconds.

The Storyteller's Secret by Carmine Gallo breaks this down beautifully. Gallo studied TED Talks, business presentations, and interviews with top communicators. The book reveals how leaders like Steve Jobs and Richard Branson use specific story structures to inspire and persuade. After reading this, I completely changed how I open conversations. It's basically a masterclass in making people give a damn about what you're saying.

## Step 2: Add Specific, Weird Details

Generic stories are forgettable. Specific stories stick in people's brains like glue. The difference is in the details.

Don't say: ""I met this interesting person at a bar.""
Say: ""I met this guy at a dive bar who was wearing a vintage Nirvana shirt with actual cigarette burns in it, drinking whiskey neat at 2pm on a Wednesday.""

Those specific details, the weird ones that seem almost unnecessary, are what make stories feel real and memorable. They activate the visual cortex in your listener's brain. They're not just hearing your story, they're seeing it, feeling it.

Research from neuroscientist Uri Hasson at Princeton shows that when someone tells a story well, the listener's brain activity actually mirrors the storyteller's brain. You're literally syncing up. But this only happens when the story is vivid and detailed enough to create mental imagery.

Pro tip: Include one sensory detail (what something smelled like, sounded like, felt like). It makes your story 10x more immersive.

## Step 3: Embrace The Pause

Silence is your secret weapon. Most people are terrified of pauses, so they rush through stories like they're being timed. Wrong move.

Strategic pauses build tension and give your audience time to process. They also make you seem more confident and in control. Think about how comedians use timing. The pause before the punchline is often funnier than the punchline itself.

Try this: When you get to the most important or surprising part of your story, pause for 2-3 seconds. Let the anticipation build. Watch how people lean in.

Comedian and storytelling coach Matthew Dicks talks about this extensively in his book Storyworthy. Dicks teaches a technique called ""homework for life,"" where you identify one story-worthy moment from each day. The book is insanely practical, showing you how to find stories in everyday life and structure them for maximum impact. It completely changed how I notice and remember moments worth sharing. This is the best storytelling craft book I've ever read, hands down.

## Step 4: Show Vulnerability or Failure

People don't connect with perfect stories. They connect with struggle, embarrassment, and failure. If your story is just you being awesome, people tune out. They can't relate.

The most charismatic storytellers share moments where they looked stupid, failed, or learned something the hard way. It makes you human. It makes you likable.

This is backed by research on something called the Pratfall Effect. Studies show that people who display occasional flaws or mistakes are actually perceived as MORE attractive and trustworthy than those who seem perfect. Your vulnerability creates connection.

Instead of: ""I closed this huge deal at work.""
Try: ""I completely bombed my pitch, said 'um' like 47 times, but somehow the client laughed and gave me another shot...""

The second version is way more engaging because there's conflict, humanity, and relatability.

## Step 5: Structure Around Transformation

Every story needs a point. Not a moral lesson you beat people over the head with, but a subtle transformation or realization. Stories that go nowhere feel like a waste of time.

The basic formula: Something happened, it changed something (my perspective, my situation, my understanding), and here's what I learned or how I'm different now.

You don't have to spell it out explicitly. In fact, it's better if you don't. Let people draw their own conclusions. But there should be a clear before and after.

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that pulls from communication books, storytelling research, and expert interviews to build personalized learning plans around specific goals like ""become a more engaging storyteller"" or ""master conversation as an introvert."" Built by a team from Columbia and Google, it transforms these resources into customized podcasts you control, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives packed with examples and context. 

You can even pick your narrator's voice (there's a smooth, charismatic style that's perfect for communication content) and adjust the tone based on your mood. The app includes most of the books mentioned here plus tons of psychology research on persuasion and influence, all structured into an adaptive plan that evolves as you learn. Worth checking out if you want a more structured way to level up these skills without hunting down every resource separately.

## Step 6: Read Your Audience and Adapt

The best storytellers are constantly calibrating based on feedback. They notice when people are engaged versus when they're losing interest. They speed up boring parts and slow down interesting ones.

Watch for micro-expressions: Are people making eye contact? Leaning in? Smiling or reacting? Those are green lights. If someone looks away, checks their phone, or seems distracted, you're losing them. Wrap it up or pivot.

This isn't about people-pleasing. It's about respecting attention as a currency. In 2025, attention is the most valuable resource anyone can give you. Don't waste it.

## Step 7: Practice Out Loud

You can't get good at storytelling by thinking about it. You have to actually practice telling stories out loud. Talk to yourself in the car. Record voice memos. Tell stories to friends and notice what lands.

The YouTube channel Charisma on Command breaks down storytelling techniques used by charismatic celebrities and public figures. They analyze everything from body language to vocal tonality to narrative structure. Watching their breakdowns of people like Will Smith, Chris Rock, and Matthew McConaughey will give you a masterclass in how top-tier communicators hold attention.

## The Real Secret Nobody Tells You

Here's the thing research won't tell you but experience will: People don't remember your stories because of what happened. They remember how you made them feel.

Your goal isn't to relay information. It's to create an emotional experience. Whether that's laughter, surprise, tension, or connection, the feeling is what sticks.

Stop trying to tell perfect stories. Start trying to make people feel something. That's the difference between someone who talks at parties and someone everyone wants to talk to.

The science backs this up, but the proof is in how differently people respond to you once you nail this skill. It's not manipulation. It's connection. And in a world where everyone's glued to screens, the ability to hold someone's attention through a well-told story is basically a superpower.",3,1770741930.0,ConnectBetter,0,1.0,False

I am also an artist but usually don't draw too much these days and just collect art from other artists. I sing sometimes for fun. My idea of a good time is hunkering down with my cats and reading a book or watching a horror movie. My husband and his family have gotten me addicted to coffee. I used to be afraid of spiders but my husband got me to love them. Sometimes I watch anime, but I have to be in the mood for it haha.

I will: Send you a lot of animal pics, art, and random memes. Have random ADD thoughts.

others? Does lid design make a big difference? How much do material, seal quality or size affect 
daily use? And how many variations exist that most people never notice because local stores

As Islam won't really align with the idea of women doing OF, or going into casual relationships with any rich guy they just met at the coffee shop or on Tinder. They think this causes them to miss out on a lot of life experiences as well as financial gain they could have made. Unless religion is in a more sugar-coated form, it discourages them from participating. Just my two cents here...",2,1770741818.0,TraditionalMuslims,0,1.0,False

Just looking for a vibe check I suppose. Am I on a good track here ya know yada yada. I hope you enjoy!

“Ugghhh, my head.”

What is this?  
 Why am I laying in grass?

Oh wow, my head is pounding, and it feels like my eyes have never seen light before.  
 What the shit?

“I’m NAKED!”

My legs are covered in dried blood.  
 Am I cut?  
 What is happening?

“Okay, calm down.”  
 Assess.  
 We can do this.  
 Any danger?  
 Quick scan surroundings then self.

I see no movement, and I’m in an almost, artificial-looking semi-tropical forest.  
 There’s some water nearby, and I’m kind of at a high point. 

Okay.

My body—let’s see.  
 No wounds.

I’m menstruating.

Great.

Naked, menstruating, in the woods.

What was I just doing?

Ah, it’s all so blurry.  
 I can’t even think of my name right now.

Alright, let’s get to the basics:  
 where am I,  
 where am I going,  
 and how am I going to get there?

I’d love to not be naked.  
 I don’t see any supplies around though.

Let’s start with getting water, hydrating, and cleaning myself up.

Nice, a stream and a reservoir down over there.  
 The light coming a bit from my right since shadows are to my left must be the sun so the water is either north or south. 

Everything is a bit dry, no morning dew, so it’s probably afternoon.  
 We’ll say south for now.

Alright, let’s go, Shelby.

It takes a bit of careful walking downhill.

Only ten minutes or so.  
 That was faster than I thought it would be.

I feel kind of weak, but also lighter than normal.  
 It’s hard to explain.

Still no signs of life though, and it’s kind of freaking me out.  
 Not even a twig snap here or a cricket there—like nothing.

I should have heard some kind of critter by now.  
 I think I did see a bird, but I can’t be sure.

One problem at a time though.  
 Let’s get rinsed off, Shelby.

After a few minutes near the water, I notice a small waterfall tucked away that I didn’t see at first.

Looks like there might be a cave back there too.

Huh…  
 why did I—  
 I—

Yes, I remember.

I used to go hiking with my scout troop, and we found a cool cave behind a waterfall once.

And I have been saying my name—it’s Shelby.

Oh, I am such a goof.

Still though, how did I get here?

Focus.

Rinse off, get clean, better inspect for wounds, and let’s see if there is at least life in the water.

Alright…

So a few little fish at least.

So I’m not going insane.  
 That’s nice.

No wounds.  
 Another win.

Let’s go.

It takes a while to dig a small hole near the water.

While I wait for it to fill with drinkable water, I look around for leaves and vines and things to make cordage.  
 I just cannot be naked anymore.

By the time I finally drink, my mouth was so dry it almost hurts.

That was great.

This dirt is odd though.  
 It reminds me of the artificial coffee-husk dirt used in greenhouses.

And there were no bugs or worms.

Still, there was dirt, and I got my filtered water, so I can’t complain.

Alright, let’s find some vines to make some simple cordage and at least hang a few leaves on my bits and bobs.

I don’t mind nudity, especially if it’s in art form, but I still want to be modest.  
 I also just feel exposed and eechh.

Making clothes takes longer than I want it to.

My fingers fumble with vines and knots.  
 I redo things more than once. Its a very different in practice I feel for some reason. I must have learned this with my scouting buddies. 

Eventually, I manage something passable.

Okay, I think these will do.

Much easier to custom-make leaves than to find perfect clothes from the mega factories, haha.  
 Having decent hips and DD breasts just makes it so annoying.

It’s like they just want us to be this cookie-cutter mold and to keep consuming.

 Wait what the hell am I talking about right now?

I have such a strong opinion, but I can’t even think of a clothing brand or style or anything.  
 Why is my memory so foggy?

It must have been the emotion tied to clothes bringing that out.

Gosh, what happened to me to lose my memory?

Okay, we got this.  
 I am sure we have been through worse.

After I breath for a bit, I kneel near the water.

Maybe I should use its reflection to really look at myself.  
 Try and jog something loose.

Alright, let’s see.

I have a simple button nose, slightly rounded cheeks, long light brown, almost reddish hair, and very pale skin, covered in freckles. 

Nice.

I remembered my mom.

We looked very similar, and everyone talked about it.

I think I saw her recently too.  
 I was going on a hike by myself.

I was calling it my “grand adventure”, and she was wishing me well, but I could tell she seemed super worried.

Oh dear, Mom.

I am so sorry.

I will make it back home.  
 I promise.

I am not dead yet—just a little lost.

It will definitely be one hell of a story though.

Okay.

Still not sure how we got here, but man, what a big step.

Oh, I feel much better.

After one last look around the water, I make my way back uphill.

Back to where I woke up.

It takes a bit longer going up hill but still I feel light and the walk back up is a breeze. 

Let’s climb this tree and do some scouting.

It takes effort.

Almost to the top and—

Boom.

Wow.

It really is a pretty little valley.

Wait…

Hold on…

Wait, no.

I saw the sun earlier—  
 where—  
 no.

There is just light from over there, but no sun.

And it does look like a sky.

I see the trees stop  
 and the sky come down  
 to the ground.

No.

I must be hallucinating.

Some kind of optical illusion.  
  
I can not be… In a dome? A cage? 

It almost looks like there is a passage along the ridgeline though, where the dome does not touch the ground, to the west of the waterfall area.

Okay.

Let’s head to the edge area, then follow the ridge that way.

This must just be some optical illusion of being on a mountain island, right?  
  
My legs are shaking even as I climb down the tree what is happening haha. Come on shelby girl we got this.   
  
Every step makes my chest feel tight and my knees weak.   
  
I dont want to know. I dont want to see or learn what is ahead of me.  
  
But I see it getting closer and closer as I approach the edge. 

It’s a wall.

It feels smooth, but it looks like the sky.

It’s hard to even call it a wall.

I cannot even describe the texture.

And the detail of the moving sky on it.

It’s not a screen.  
 The pixel count would have to be infinite.

It’s almost like I am in a snow globe, and there is one of those magic-trick extra layers of glass on the outside, filled with something that is mimicking a sky.  
  
Like someone is going to pour my dome over and empty out the sky magick trick and I will wake up right?

But even with that, I don’t understand how it looks like the sky.

Wait—

Are those eyes behind the sky?

“AAHHH!!!”

“NOPE!”

I don’t stop to think about it.

I turn and follow the ridgeline.

We are going to look at the “Great Passage,” as it shall be known.

This is all normal.

Being in a giant dome with a crazy sky thing with eyes behind it is normal.

This is all normal.

I’m okay.

We are in normal normal normal…

Run.

Let’s run.

Time blurs.

Focus on the step.  
 My feet hitting the dirt.

The soft dirt beneath me, starting to feel more and more like a trail.

Yep.

Totally normal.

I see smoke!

There is smoke on the other side of the “Great Passage.”

There must be other people.

“Yes.”

  
okay , focus on some dopamine till we get there lets just get some runners high. 

I’m saved.

Thank goodness.

The passage, as I’m going through, does seem to be an arch connecting two domes together.

All normal, Shelby.

Focus on the smoke and your running.

We are alive.

There must be another human.

Focus.

Okay.

I am within one hundred yards of the fire.

Should I start yelling,  
 or approach slowly  
 and scope it out first  
 to make sure it’s safe?

At this point… we ball.

“HEELLOOOO!”

He's an architect, working on this tiny home project. Actually trying to build something decent for people who can't afford crazy rent. Shows me sketches he's proud of, then just laughs and says none of it will ever happen. Zoning rules. Permits. Material costs. Endless approvals. Too risky and complicated. Not profitable enough.

That same night I'm scrolling and see this video. Dude showing off a fully functional 3D printed gun. Fired perfect on the first try. Comments full of people losing their minds. Innovation. Freedom. Future is here.

Just sat there staring at my phone. How is that the contrast we live in? Tech can rapid prototype weapons no problem, but giving people a place to sleep? Suddenly everything's impossible. Suddenly we need caution. Years of review. Layers of paperwork.

Not just the irony that gets me. It's what's expected. We're told to be patient about housing. Understand the market. Accept high rent because that's just how things work. Meanwhile for building tools that hurt people, the system somehow knows how to move fast, stay flexible, get out of the way.

Not about one place. You see it everywhere. Housing is this complex problem needing sacrifice and delay. Weapons are a technical challenge to solve efficiently. One's tied to basic human dignity. The other's treated like a fun engineering project.

We say society rewards innovation, but that's only half true. It rewards certain kinds. The kind that fits power structures. Promises control or profit. Designing homes for broke people doesn't excite the system the same way.

Sometimes I wonder what would happen if we treated shelter with the same urgency we apply to destruction. Cut red tape for living instead of just killing. Assumed people deserve a roof as much as someone deserves a new gadget.

Right now the message feels clear. We're incredibly good at making things that end lives, and strangely bad at making things that support them. That's not a tech problem. It's a choice dressed up like it had to be this way.",0,1770741701.0,I_DONT_LIKE,3,0.17,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Here is exactly how I maintain that level of output without burning out:

1. Optimize Your Sleep

Sleep is the price you pay for memory. Go to bed at the same time every night. Ensure your room is completely dark and cool. An all-nighter is never the answer; a rested brain solves in 20 minutes what a tired brain struggles with for two hours.

3. Hydration

If you’re dehydrated, your brain is essentially lagging. Following the U.S. National Academies of Sciences guidelines, I aim for:

Men: 3.7 Liters

Women: 2.7 Liters

4. Sunlight & Movement

Get 10–15 minutes of morning sunlight (even through a window, though outside is better). Combine this with a quick walk. It resets your circadian rhythm and gets the blood pumping to your brain before you sit down.

5. FIX YOUR POSTURE

Hunching over a desk kills blood flow and causes tension headaches. Invest in a standing desk or laptop stand and a decent chair. Consciously sit taller; your energy levels will follow your spine.

6. Master Planning

You cannot focus if you’re constantly wondering what to do next. You have to get clear on your goals and plan your days in advance.

I personally use Notion to keep all my notes and documents organized in one place and Purpоsа арр for planning my schedule and staying hyper-focused on my daily goals. 

67🐐. Cold Showers

At the end of your normal shower, turn the dial to cold for the last 30 seconds. The dopamine and adrenaline spike you get from this is insane and lasts for hours.

7. Swap Coffee for Green Tea + L-Theanine

Coffee often leads to jitters and a crash. I switched to Green Tea paired with L-Theanine. It provides a ""calm alertness"" that is much better for deep work and sustained focus.

8. Box Breathing

When the stress levels rise, I use Box Breathing to regain control of my nervous system:

9. 📵

Grayscale your screen, use ap blockers, and turn off all notifications.

10. Use Study Techniques

Active Recall & Spaced Repetition: Testing yourself rather than re-reading.

Feynman Technique: Explain the concept as if you’re talking to a 5-year-old.

Some random things about me, I came here from Malta and was in southern spain before that. I do boring office work but ive studied applied math in university. I make noise / drone / boring experimental music, which I guess isnt much of a thing here. I like to cook and food in general. I like birds a lot and have built a relationship with the birds around my house to the point they visit daily. Ive fostered fallen and injured birds before too. Sadly cant speak french at all.

Feels weird to be posting this but I generally find it somewhat easy finding people to talk to while traveling but this is my first time alone in an arab country and I think Im out of my element. Im also probably not in the best area for it since Im staying in Ville Nouvelle but will probably move in the next few days.

Ill take any recommendations of places where to try my luck too. 

Ive used OkCupid for this in some other countries but Im not able to log in for some reason. Tried Tinder a bit and only got some very obvious scammers lol Not looking for hookups really, just someone to chat since Im by myself.

She has a history of pulling away, but the intimacy recently skyrocketed. Do I end it to protect myself, or wait out her exam week?","My Background (Why I'm Anxious): I’m a 36M juggling a lot I work as a hospital healthcare admin, I’m an EMT and volunteer firefighter, and I coach youth lacrosse. I am currently going through a nightmare scenario in my personal life: a messy divorce with my ex-wife (going on a year and a half, no kids) who is trying to ruin me financially. On top of that, an ex-girlfriend from post-divorce (who is a clinical therapist) recently threatened to tell my ex-wife that I’m a ""narcissist"" to blow up my divorce even more, and told me I was ""dead to her"" just last Monday. My nervous system is completely shot, and I am terrified of being abandoned or manipulated again.

The Girl & The Timeline: I started seeing ""L"" (29F, turning 30 on Valentine’s Day) in early November. This was roughly two weeks after she broke up with her toxic ex, James. She is a nursing student.

The First Crash Out (December): Things started great, but right around her finals week in mid-December, she went completely radio silent. I thought it was over, but she reached out on Christmas and we started talking again shortly after New Year's.

The Nose Incident & The Second Crash (January): In January, her dog actually bit the tip of my nose off. It was a severe injury, and L was amazing at first she cared for me while I was admitted to the hospital and immediately after. But as soon as things started feeling ""real,"" she crashed out again.

Shortly after, I had to fly down to Florida to take care of my dad. During this time, she pulled away hard, giving me the classic avoidant speech: she didn't want to date anyone, she wanted to be ""wild and free,"" and wanted to ""smooch whoever.""

The Major Shift (Late January): When I got back from Florida around Jan 28th, everything completely flipped. We slept together (we’ve slept together about 8 times total) and it was incredible. She explicitly told me we have ""amazing chemistry and spark."" During this time of high intimacy, she jokingly called me her ""future husband."" She also told me she liked/loved me, but followed it up with, *""We are so fucked, because we are going to hurt each other.""* She even trusted me enough to show me pages from her childhood trauma journal.

Our lives started blending, too. She kind of invited me to her 30th birthday this coming weekend. I also met her mom via FaceTime, and accidentally met her dad one day when I was picking her up (she lives in her parents' rental apartment).

The Ex, The Academic Stress, & The Earrings (Last Week): Last week, her toxic ex James reached out and asked her to get coffee (new plans, not old ones) she said she would like that then he cancelled due to his healing. This ex would constantly make comments putting her down. He also ruined her GPA last year, which compounded with a previous semester she had already failed due to getting a DUI. Because of this history, she is absolutely terrified of failing nursing school right now.

Despite the ex reaching out, she seemed entirely focused on me. I bought her a pair of emerald earrings simply because she likes the color green. Last Tuesday, she sent me a playful video of herself wearing them, telling me a stranger tried to hit on her by asking about the stones. She literally hissed jokingly in video response to the guy and told him, *""Cool, another man got me these.""*

The Current Silence: Last Tuesday night, we had a minor miscommunication on the phone.  She texted me in the morning on how to communicate with her telling me that if shes expressing her feelings just say I hear you, Wednesday evening, I texted her first, and she replied warmly, checking in on my nose healing and saying there is ""so much time in healing.""

That was the last time we spoke. It has been 5 days of total radio silence.

Here is the context for her silence: Her semester just started, her clinicals were delayed by two weeks, and she had a massive Pharmacology exam yesterday (Monday). I know she went on ""Do Not Disturb"" at exactly 10:00 PM last night.

The Complication (The Letter & Our Stuff): Right before this radio silence started, I wrote her a romantic, physical letter. I had read her a draft of it previously and she called it ""poetic,"" so I mailed her the real thing. It's sitting at her house right now not sure if she read it. Also, she still has an Amazon package of mine from when I was in FL, and I have her glasses.

My Dilemma: Because of my divorce and my crazy ex therapist girlfriend, I am in full panic mode. My brain is telling me the 5 days of silence means she’s ghosting me, she went back to her toxic ex James, or she’s defaulting back to her ""I want to smooch whoever"" mindset.

My anxiety is screaming at me to send a text ending things right now so I can reject her before she rejects me. But I also know she just finished a brutal exam yesterday and has a 12-hour hospital clinical shift tomorrow.

Am I self sabotaging because of my past trauma? Do I walk away and end it now, or do I hold the line, not text her, and see if she reaches out after her exam week and her birthday this weekend

Is this level of silence normal for an overwhelmed nursing student during exams, or is the fact that she ""can't shake"" her ex a massive red flag I am ignoring?

If you were in her shoes stressed about school and dealing with a lingering ex how would you perceive my silence right now? because I toll her I mirror her behavior.

Would receiving that letter right now push you away, or make you feel safe?",1,1770741458.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

Can't exist in public without buying something. When did we privatize human gathering spaces?,"I've been thinking about this a lot lately and it's genuinely disturbing how there's basically nowhere to just exist in public anymore without spending money.

When I was a kid in the 90s and early 2000s, you could hang out at the mall, the library had extended hours and comfortable seating, there were actual community centers, parks had functioning facilities and programming. You could just go somewhere and be around other people without anyone expecting you to buy anything.

Now? Good luck. Malls are dead or dying and the ones that survive have security that will hassle you if you're not actively shopping. Libraries are underfunded and have cut their hours to bare minimum. Coffee shops expect you to buy something every hour or so or they'll give you dirty looks. Even parks are increasingly privatized or require parking fees or have eliminated seating areas. Everything has become transactional. You can't just exist in a public space anymore. You have to be a consumer. Even sitting on a bench in some downtown areas will get you moved along if you're there too long.

This is having real societal consequences. Where are teenagers supposed to hang out? Where are elderly people supposed to socialize if they can't afford to constantly buy coffee? Where do people who are lonely or isolated go to just be around other humans without spending money they might not have? We've essentially privatized human gathering and made it a privilege instead of a right. When did this happen? Was it gradual or was there a specific turning point? And more importantly, how do we push back against it?

I know some cities are trying to reclaim public spaces and invest in community centers, but it feels like we're fighting an uphill battle against a culture that has decided that if you're not actively consuming, you don't deserve to exist in public.

Salam sisters, apologies if this isn’t allowed here, but it’s so hard to find a space to talk about stuff like this and actually be taken seriously.

So I’ve struggled with an ED since childhood. Because of modesty culture my parents would scream at me for having curves from the age of 9, so I started starving myself so I could be a “pure” and proper Muslim girl (they would say I was trying to attract men with my body…I was just a kid 🥲). I spiraled every time I wore modest clothes because they were so unflattering on me, so that made my disorder worse (my parents would purposely buy clothing sizes way too large so that messed with my head). I would starve, then rebound and gain weight, then starve, etc. constantly. For some reason the winter/cold weather season is always when I starve myself the most, so right now I’m not doing too great.

So with Ramadan right around the corner, I’m really scared. I’ve been living off coffee/energy drinks to suppress my hunger and drink multiple cups throughout the day, but obviously if I’m fasting I can’t do that. I really want to focus on ibadah during this holy month but it’s so hard when the food noise in your head is constant and overwhelming.

I know the ”obvious“ thing to do is just eat a proper suhoor and iftaar and go about my day but it’s so hard :( It’s like there’s this mental block in my brain that starts having a panic attack when too much food is entering my body. If any other girls have dealt with EDs and have advice I’d really appreciate it!",6,1770741255.0,muslimgirlswithtaste,2,1.0,False

Humans are not especially ""Loud"", especially the intelligent ones, you know a Human is smart when a problem erupts and instead of complaining about it, they just fix it and move on, no fuss no muss. 

A gesture that the galaxy has accepted as basically a universal sign of goodwill from Humans is being offered a cup of coffee. 

Note that it doesn't necessarily HAVE to be coffee, it can be your drink of choice, but alcohol is surprisingly the least popular. 

Want an example? 

I work my ass off for 12 hours overtime to save up enough credits for a limited edition version of a card game action figure. 

I work through the night and the Janitor, a Human who enjoys the peace and quiet of an empty building and my silent tapping on the console as I work through data, sees me. 

I am borderline about to fall asleep then and there, he sees me working my ass off and goes to the coffee machine, makes a simple company mug of coffee, and puts it next to me. 

I barely register him but the scent and warmth emanating from the cup shocks me, I look as he puts down cream and sugar sachets and simply tips his hat as he goes back to cleaning the floor with the other janitors. 

I take in the soft scent and aroma as I take a sip first pure black, before adjusting it with cream and sugar. 

I don't know if it was his intention but it seemed like he wanted me to take a break, so I clocked out and spent the day at home trying to fix my sleep schedule. 

Another example? 

My brother is in the military, the campaign was stretching out resources, especially food since we were housing refugees in the station, it was so bad that military and refugees had to eat at the same time to save power, water, and cleaning time. 

My brother is tired after a grueling combat patrol that involved a 4 hour firefight against an entrenched anti vehicle cannon. 

His squad enters the chow hall at 2 AM, 8 hours from the approved mealtime. 

The cooks are still cutting Plorps and Carrots, others are making potato fries with the skin on to cut down on waste, animal bones are crushed and diced into broth cubes. 

His squad asks for some food but the chefs says they can't break the rules. 

He asks for at least a cup of coffee but the other cooks shrug and say to make it themselves. 

My brother is dog gone tired and just mopes at the dining table with his team. 

A Human cook sighs as his partner takes over his position, he grabs some coffee beans and makes a fresh ground pot of coffee and uses the coffee grounds to make makeshift coffee cakes from what flour, eggs, and other stuff he can scrape up. 

It doesn't fill up their bellies by much, but the hot coffee and something that isn't a ""plug"" MRE makes my brother and his squad feel a little better.

Kinda helps that it helped them shit out what they ate the last few days cause you know how MREs can uh....PLUG the hole. 

So yeah, if you work closely with Humans and they offer a cup of coffee or time to drink, don't be hesitant to say yes, after all, a small gesture of kindess can grant an ocean of motivation at the right moment. ",2,1770741234.0,humansarespaceorcs,1,1.0,False

“Hey I just wanted to say I really love talking to you and I’m sorry if I made things awkward by talking about that internship (I swear it had nothing to do with you). I’m also sorry about the coffee thing. And if you don’t want to talk anymore that’s totally okay I just wanted you to know I’m fine with that. I just didn’t want things to be weird.”

I’ve been talking to this girl I met on TikTok for a while now. It started casually, but over time we ended up actually talking pretty regularly. Nothing romantic or sexual just long conversations about fandom. She honestly got me through a pretty rough period, and even though we’d never met in person, she became someone I genuinely cared about as a friend.

Lately though, she’d been more distant. Shorter replies, less engagement. I tried to tell myself not to overthink it, but of course I did.

Last night I got really drunk, and instead of doing the smart thing (putting my phone down), I decided it was a great idea to address all my anxieties at once. I sent her this rambling, overly apologetic message telling her I liked talking to her, apologizing for potentially making things awkward, clarifying that some stuff I’d mentioned (an internship and inviting her for coffee. I thought she was hinting) had nothing to do with her, and then repeatedly telling her that if she didn’t want to talk anymore it was okay.

In my head, I was trying to be respectful and give her space. In reality, I’m terrified it came off as insecure, intense, or worst of all creepy. Now I’m sitting here sober, rereading it, and spiraling because she was already pulling away and I’m scared I just put the final nail in the coffin.

What hurts the most isn’t even the embarrassment it’s the fear that I might’ve scared off someone who meant a lot to me and helped me through a really hard time, all because I couldn’t wait until morning to keep my thoughts to myself.

TL;DR: I got drunk, panic texted a TikTok friend who was already being distant, and now I’m scared I creeped her out and lost someone who helped me through a really rough time.",1,1770741193.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

About six months ago, I started working at a new place. In my field, we work in pairs, and I started alongside my work partner, who is also one of my closest friends. Shortly after starting, I noticed a guy at work — let’s call him *Chris*.

Chris is the kind of person who looks kind of mean or distant at first, but once you get to know him, he’s actually really kind. We shared the same sense of humor, made each other laugh a lot, talked outside of work, and sometimes went out for coffee or beers with other coworkers.

At some point, I started developing strong feelings for him. My work partner and another close friend knew about it.

Over time, my friends began pointing out that Chris seemed a bit flirty with me. They encouraged me to do something about it. I didn’t, mostly because I felt like he was sending mixed signals. Some days he’d compliment me (“you look really nice today,” “I like your outfit”)  Other days, he’d barely talk to me at all.

So here’s the part that broke me.

A few days ago, my work partner (my best friend) called me and told me she was nervous to say this. She explained that Chris had invited her out for a drink “to talk,” and during that conversation, he confessed that he was in love with her. He told her he’d been feeling this way for months.

You can imagine how I felt hearing that. My heart completely shattered.

What makes it worse is that the day before, I had told her I suspected he might like her a bit — but I never imagined it was *this* serious. I did know that she found him attractive and didn’t rule out the possibility of being with him, and we had talked about that openly. At the time, it didn’t seem like an issue.

The problem is that it went way further than I expected.

I feel disoriented and embarrassed. I cried all morning, mostly because I keep thinking about how stupid I was to believe he might want something with me. I’ve already talked to my friend about how I feel. I told her it hurts, but I also told her that I don’t want to be *that* friend — the one who stops someone from being with a person they like just because I like them too. That would also mean blocking Chris from expressing his feelings, and he already did.

Still, I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I’m overreacting or if my feelings are actually valid. And I desperately need advice on how to move on, because this feels like a grieving process — and I have to see both of them every single day at work.

Any advice would really help.",2,1770740999.0,AmIOverreacting,6,1.0,False

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.

I’m going to Hanoi for just under 2 months in may-july. What the best way to book relatively cheap and safe accommodation be, where I don’t get scammed? I know booking.com, airbnb or agoda. 

What would you recommend and what quarters? I’ve been leaning towards Hoan Kiem, but I’m open to other ideas. I’ve never been there before so I have no experience. 

I’m looking for good access to supermarkets (special diet so I cook at home mostly), inexpensive coffee shops, and proximity to vibrant and bustling spots to have some company. I’m going as a solo traveller to finish a creative project. 

I feel attracted to the old quarter because it’s so pretty but perhaps I’m missing something and there’s another quarter that would suit me better.

I'm applying to 3 schools in total (can’t apply to more for personal reasons). 2 are in-state private schools (BU and Tufts), and 1 is in a nearby state (UNE).

The space was a perfect blend of old-world charm and romantic luxury—the high ceilings adorned with intricate paintings of mythical scenes depicting gods and lovers in eternal embraces, antique wooden furniture polished to a deep, inviting sheen that reflected the light like aged mirrors, and the four-poster bed where the siblings lay in a tangled embrace of silk sheets, their naked bodies still bearing the faint, erotic marks from the previous night's passionate reunion on the balcony—reddened skin from grips, subtle bruises from fervent holds, and the lingering sheen of dried arousal. Noah, the 28-year-old embodiment of the protective older brother, with his tall, broad-shouldered frame honed by countless global adventures—muscles defined from hiking rugged trails in the Amazon, swimming in exotic seas off Rio's coasts, and the physical demands of their nomadic life—and dark hair tousled wildly from sleep, awoke first. His piercing blue eyes, sharp with the vigilance he'd always shown toward his sibling, fixed on Emma—his 26-year-old sister, her curvaceous body pressed snugly against his, full hips curving invitingly under the sheets, ample breasts rising and falling with her steady, peaceful breaths, and long auburn hair splayed across the pillow like a fiery river catching the dawn's first rays. Their forms, intertwined so naturally and intimately, spoke volumes of the profound, forbidden evolution of their bond: from innocent Midwestern siblings sharing whispered secrets under homemade blanket forts during stormy nights, consoling each other through the awkward heartbreaks of their teen years with late-night talks that lasted until dawn, to this all-consuming love that had ignited like wildfire in Rio's sultry heat and deepened with every shared escapade across the globe, turning their blood ties into a source of unparalleled passion and intimacy. Noah's hand traced the delicate curve of her shoulder lightly, his fingers lingering on the constellation of freckles he'd memorized since childhood, now symbols of the little sister he'd always shielded from the world's cruelties, who had blossomed into the woman he craved with an intensity that defied every societal norm and moral boundary, their love a secret flame that burned brighter in isolation.

Emma stirred with a soft, contented sigh, her body arching instinctively into his warmth, her full breasts brushing his chest with tantalizing softness as she nuzzled closer, inhaling his familiar scent—a comforting mix of clean soap, subtle musk from their travels, and the faint saltiness from last night's exertions. Her green eyes fluttered open to meet his gaze with a sleepy, radiant smile that illuminated her flushed features, her voice carrying the intimate warmth and playful affection reserved only for him. ""Morning, big bro,"" she whispered huskily, the term of endearment slipping out like a cherished secret in the privacy of their room, a reminder of their unbreakable sibling connection that no mask or adventure could obscure. She stretched languidly against him, her curvaceous form pressing closer—her thigh sliding over his in a gesture that was both innocent and charged with the erotic undercurrent of their forbidden love, her hand trailing down his abs with a teasing lightness. ""Last night was... unforgettable,"" she added, her fingers dancing lower, brushing his semi-hard cock under the sheets, evoking memories of their balcony tryst where the world had watched unknowingly as brother claimed sister in raw, public ecstasy. ""Fucking on that balcony with everyone watching... it was so hot, big bro. Your little sis loved being owned like that, feeling you fill me while strangers cheered.""

Their peaceful reverie, wrapped in the lingering scent of their passion—the musky aroma of sex mingled with the faint briny mist wafting from the canal outside—was interrupted by the simultaneous buzz of their phones on the antique nightstand, the vibrations echoing softly against the polished wood surface. Noah reached over with a reluctant groan, his arm flexing as he grabbed his device, squinting at the bright screen in the dim, curtain-filtered light. ""Text from Marco,"" he murmured, sitting up slightly, the silk sheets pooling around his waist to reveal more of his muscular torso, a body sculpted from years of protecting and adventuring with his sister—from carrying her on his back during family hikes to the physical intimacy they now shared. The message read: \*Buongiorno! Meet me downstairs in 30? Time to gear up for tonight's party—suits and masks await. Sofia's snagging Emma for some shopping magic. Can't wait to see you both shine.\*

Emma propped herself on an elbow, her auburn hair tumbling over one shoulder like a cascade of autumn leaves, her ample breasts shifting enticingly with the movement as she checked her own phone. A grin spread across her face, lighting up her features with mischievous excitement. ""Sofia says the same—meet her in the lobby for a girls' shopping spree to prep for the bash. Sounds like a blast, big bro."" She leaned in to kiss him lightly on the lips, a chaste peck that lingered just a moment too long, her tongue flicking teasingly against his, carrying the weight of their secret sibling affection twisted into simmering desire. ""Guess we're splitting up for the day—but tonight, who knows what mysteries we'll uncover together? Just promise me you'll think of your little sis while you're out there suiting up like a dashing masked hero. Maybe imagine ripping off my new dress later and fucking me senseless.""

They dressed with the easy, familiar rhythm of siblings who'd shared bathrooms and wardrobes growing up—from fighting over mirror time in their teen years to this playful intimacy—but now laced with teasing touches that heightened the air between them. Emma slipped into a light sundress that hugged her full hips and accentuated her curvaceous figure, the floral fabric whispering softly against her skin as Noah zipped it up from behind, his fingers brushing her spine deliberately, sending shivers down her back that made her bite her lip. ""You look stunning, little sis,"" he whispered in her ear, his breath hot and affectionate, his hands lingering on her waist a second longer than necessary, pulling her back against him to feel his growing arousal. Noah pulled on casual jeans that clung to his muscular legs and a fitted shirt that highlighted his broad shoulders and toned chest, Emma adjusting his collar with a wink and a quick peck on his cheek, her hand brushing his crotch teasingly. ""Don't have too much fun without your little sis,"" she whispered teasingly as they headed out, her hand slipping into his for a brief, comforting squeeze in the hallway—a gesture that felt both innocent and profoundly intimate, a silent affirmation of their blood bond amid the world's oblivious gaze.

Downstairs in the grand lobby—a majestic space with marble floors veined in gold and polished to a mirror-like shine, crystal chandeliers hanging from the high ceiling casting prismatic rainbows across the walls, and the faint, rhythmic echo of canal water lapping against the building's ancient stone foundation—they met Marco and Sofia. The Italian couple looked effortlessly chic and vibrant: Marco in tailored chinos and a crisp linen shirt that accentuated his chiseled jaw and athletic build, his dark hair neatly styled with just a hint of product to keep it in place; Sofia in a flowing skirt and blouse that flattered her olive-skinned curves, the fabric swaying gracefully with each step, her brown eyes sparkling with the same mischievous energy she'd shown during their Milan encounters. ""Buongiorno, amici!"" Sofia greeted warmly, pulling Emma into a tight hug that carried the lingering scent of jasmine perfume and the faint floral notes of Venetian soap. ""Ready for some serious retail therapy? We need dresses and masks that scream mystery, allure, and a touch of seduction for tonight's masquerade ball—it's going to be an evening of secrets and surprises."" Marco clapped Noah on the back with a friendly, firm grip, his grin wide and welcoming. ""And us gents? We'll handle the suits and masks like pros. Let's make sure we turn every head at the party tonight.""

The groups parted ways with quick, affectionate kisses and embraces—Emma and Noah sharing one that appeared passionate and loving to their friends but held the subtle, electric warmth of sibling love, her whispering in his ear so softly only he could hear, ""See you soon, big bro—don't forget your little sis while you're out being all dapper. Maybe imagine ripping off my new dress later and fucking me senseless."" Sofia linked arms with Emma, leading her out into the sun-dappled Venetian streets, the cobblestones uneven under their feet, bustling with tourists snapping photos and the aroma of fresh pastries wafting from nearby bakeries, while Marco and Noah headed in the opposite direction, the canal's shimmering water reflecting the historic facades around them like a living painting.

Noah and Marco strolled leisurely through the winding, narrow alleys of Venice, the ancient stone buildings rising like timeless sentinels on either side, their facades adorned with intricate carvings, weathered shutters in shades of faded blue and green, and flower boxes overflowing with vibrant geraniums in shades of crimson and pink that added bursts of color to the earthy tones. The air was alive with the briny scent of the lagoon, mingled with the distant calls of gondoliers singing romantic ballads to enchanted passengers, the chatter of locals bargaining at colorful market stalls piled high with fresh fruits like juicy oranges and ripe figs, artisanal cheeses wrapped in wax paper, and glittering Murano glass trinkets that caught the light like jewels. They stopped first at a quaint outdoor cafe nestled in a shaded piazza, where wrought-iron tables were scattered under colorful striped awnings that fluttered gently in the breeze, and potted olive trees provided spots of lush green amid the ancient stone surroundings. The aroma of freshly brewed espresso—rich, dark, and invigorating—and warm cornetti—flaky pastries filled with sweet custard or tart jam, dusted with powdered sugar—wafted invitingly as they claimed a table near a bubbling fountain carved with mythical sea creatures, the waiter greeting them with a nod and a smile, promptly delivering steaming cups of rich, dark coffee topped with frothy crema and a plate of assorted pastries that gleamed temptingly in the sunlight.

From there, they headed to a high-end men's boutique on a narrow street lined with luxury shops, the window displays showcasing tailored suits in fine Italian wool and silk, mannequins posed with Venetian masks for added thematic flair, the glass fronts reflecting the canal's sparkle like a mirror to the city's soul. Inside, the store was a haven of sophistication—racks of garments in deep navies, charcoals, and blacks meticulously arranged by color and cut, the air scented with fresh leather from nearby belts and shoes, and subtle cologne from sample bottles on a polished mahogany counter. A knowledgeable tailor, an elderly man with a tape measure draped around his neck like a badge of honor and glasses perched on his nose, greeted them warmly in accented English, measuring Noah with precision—his broad shoulders requiring a slight adjustment for comfort, his long arms and athletic build ensuring the suit hung perfectly without a wrinkle. Marco selected fabrics with an expert eye, choosing a midnight blue tuxedo with a subtle sheen that caught the light like the canal at dusk for himself, the material smooth and luxurious to the touch; Noah opted for sleek black that accentuated his commanding presence, the fabric cool and tailored to hug his muscles just right. ""For the masquerade,"" Marco explained as they tried them on in the spacious fitting room, the full-length mirrors reflecting their sharp, transformed appearances from multiple angles, making Noah feel like a mysterious stranger even to himself. ""It's not just a party—it's an immersive event where masks hide faces but reveal desires, allowing everyone to let go without fear of recognition. Sofia and I host these every so often; our friends love the anonymity—no names, no judgments, just pure, unfiltered enjoyment and exploration.""

Next, they visited a specialized costume shop nearby, a whimsical emporium crammed floor-to-ceiling with feathers in every hue from iridescent peacock blues to fiery reds, sequins sparkling like scattered stars on shelves, and elaborate Venetian masks—hand-painted porcelains depicting mythical harlequins with mischievous grins and jester bells that tinkled softly, majestic birds with plumed crests that fluttered with each turn of the head, and enigmatic phantoms with swirling patterns of gold leaf and jewels that sparkled like stars, each one a unique masterpiece crafted by local artisans passed down through generations of family traditions. The air smelled of aged paper from mask molds stacked in corners, fresh paint from recent creations drying on racks, and the faint metallic tang of glue used in assembly, the shopkeeper—a jovial woman with colorful scarves wrapped around her neck and wrists like vibrant ribbons—guiding them through the selections with enthusiastic stories of each mask's inspiration, from Carnival legends of lovers meeting in disguise to personal anecdotes of past buyers' adventures at masked balls. Marco picked an ornate gold and black mask that complemented his tuxedo's elegance, its intricate filigree adding a touch of regal mystery to his chiseled features, the weight balanced perfectly for comfort. Noah chose a simple yet striking black domino mask that shadowed his blue eyes intriguingly, allowing just enough of his strong jawline and windswept hair to show for an air of enigmatic allure that made him feel both hidden and exposed. ""Perfect for blending in—or standing out when you choose to,"" Marco grinned, paying for both with a flourish of his card, the transaction swift and friendly. As they walked back through the sun-warmed streets, the canal's gentle lapping accompanying their steps like a rhythmic soundtrack, Marco elaborated on the party with a conspiratorial tone, leaning in as if sharing a secret: ""Expect champagne flowing like the Grand Canal, dancing under the chandeliers to music that starts classical but turns sultry as the night progresses, and as the night heats up, things get... liberated. Our crowd is sophisticated but open-minded—artists with wild imaginations who see beauty in chaos, designers like me who thrive on boundary-pushing creativity, travelers like you who've seen the world and its pleasures—it's all consensual fun, a chance to explore without strings or regrets.""

Later that afternoon, they reunited with Sofia and Emma at a bustling cafe near the Grand Canal, the water sparkling like a mosaic of diamonds under the sun's rays as vaporettos chugged by, carrying wide-eyed tourists with cameras at the ready and locals going about their day with casual grace. The women arrived arm-in-arm, laden with elegant shopping bags from high-end boutiques along the Rialto—names like Gucci and local Venetian designers emblazoned on the paper— their faces flushed with the excitement of the day's discoveries, laughter still lingering on their lips, and the warmth of the Italian sun on their skin giving them a healthy, radiant glow. Sofia's dark curls bounced lively as she hugged Marco tightly, her brown eyes alight with joy and a hint of teasing secrecy. ""We found absolute treasures,"" she teased, peeking into one bag with a wink, the rustle of tissue paper hinting at luxurious fabrics and delicate lace within, her voice carrying a playful lilt that promised surprises. Emma leaned into Noah, her sundress clinging slightly from the day's exertions and the light perspiration, the fabric damp with a subtle sheen that made it hug her curves more enticingly, accentuating her full hips and the sway of her breasts. She whispered quickly in his ear so only he could hear amid the cafe's chatter of clinking cups and multilingual conversations, ""Can't wait for you to see what I got, big bro—it's going to drive you absolutely wild, make you want to claim your little sis right there in front of everyone."" They all headed to Marco and Sofia's Venetian penthouse—a sprawling apartment in a historic palazzo overlooking the canal, with high beamed ceilings exposing centuries-old wood polished to a rich glow, terracotta floors warmed by underfloor heating that felt soothing underfoot, and modern furnishings blending seamlessly with antique Venetian mirrors framed in gold leaf and chandeliers that cast prismatic light across the rooms, the air scented with fresh flowers from vases and the faint briny whisper from the open windows.

In the master bedroom, a spacious retreat with a massive four-poster bed carved from dark walnut and draped in luxurious linens that shimmered like moonlight on water, floor-to-ceiling windows offering panoramic views of the canal's shimmering surface dotted with gondolas and the distant silhouette of St. Mark's Basilica, they dressed together in a charged atmosphere of anticipation and voyeurism. Marco and Noah undressed first—Marco stripping off his shirt to reveal his athletic build, toned from regular gym sessions and Italian genetics that gave him a naturally sculpted physique, his olive skin smooth and inviting under the soft light filtering through the windows; then his pants, standing naked briefly, his semi-hard cock stirring at the sight ahead before slipping into his tuxedo pants, buttoning the crisp shirt that hugged his frame with tailored precision. Noah followed, his muscular chest and defined abs on display as he shed his casual clothes, the faint scars from past adventures—souvenirs from jungle treks and beach scrapes with his sister—adding to his rugged appeal, his thick cock twitching slightly as he watched the women, pulling on his black tuxedo that made him look like a mysterious figure from a spy novel, the fabric smooth and cool against his skin. They watched, transfixed, as Sofia and Emma giggled and touched each other playfully while undressing—Sofia peeling off her skirt and blouse with teasing slowness, revealing the lacy red lingerie she'd worn underneath, the sheer fabric hugging her full breasts and rounded hips, her dark nipples visible through the lace like hidden treasures; Emma following, her sundress falling away in a whisper of fabric to show her simple but sexy black panties and bra, her curvaceous body on full display—full hips flaring invitingly, ample breasts heaving with her laughter as Sofia's hands lingered on her skin, adjusting imaginary flaws with fingers that traced her freckles and curves deliberately, sending subtle shivers through Emma.

The women helped each other into their new purchases: luxurious lingerie first—Sofia stepping into a corset of black lace and satin that cinched her waist dramatically, pushing up her perky breasts to create tantalizing cleavage that spilled slightly over the top, the garters snapping into place with a soft, enticing click as Emma helped fasten them, her fingers brushing Sofia's inner thighs deliberately, drawing a soft gasp and a playful swat from the Italian woman, ""Naughty—save some for later."" Emma slipped into a sheer babydoll set in emerald green, the translucent fabric cascading over her body like a gossamer veil, leaving her shaved pussy and hardened nipples barely concealed, the hem teasingly short to reveal the curve of her ass, Sofia's hands smoothing the material over her full hips and ass with lingering caresses that made Emma bite her lip in anticipation, her green eyes flicking to Noah with a heated glance that said, \*See what your little sis is wearing for you, big bro?\* ""You look like a goddess ready for worship,"" Sofia murmured, her breath hot against Emma's ear as she adjusted the straps, fingers grazing her nipples teasingly through the sheer material, hardening them further into stiff peaks. Then the dresses: Sofia's a flowing crimson gown with a deep V-neckline that plunged daringly between her breasts, the silk clinging to her curves like a second skin, swirling around her legs with every movement and catching the light like liquid fire; Emma's a sleek black number with a high slit up one thigh, revealing flashes of her lingerie and smooth leg with every step, the fabric whispering seductively as she twirled for the men's approval, the slit parting to show a tantalizing glimpse of her garter. Finally, the masks—Sofia's an intricate feathered piece in gold and red, plumes framing her face like a mythical bird ready to take flight; Emma's a delicate lace mask in black that framed her green eyes mysteriously, adding an air of enigmatic allure that made her look like a seductive phantom from a forbidden tale. The men, now suited and masked, admired them openly, their cocks stirring visibly in their pants. ""You two are breathtaking,"" Noah said, his voice low with desire, pulling Emma close for a kiss that hinted at their secret bond, whispering in her ear, ""Can't wait to unwrap you later, little sis—your big bro's going to claim every inch of that body.""

The party unfolded in the penthouse's grand salon, a vast room with vaulted ceilings and walls adorned with contemporary art that echoed Venice's artistic heritage—bold abstracts in jewel tones contrasting the historic beams above, the pieces curated by Sofia herself to provoke thought and desire. The space was transformed for the evening with dim ambient lighting from wall sconces and clusters of candles flickering on every surface—tall pillars of beeswax in ornate silver holders casting dancing shadows across the terracotta floors that added a romantic, intimate flicker, low tables laden with crystal decanters of fine wines and spirits gleaming like jewels under the light, and soft classical music playing from hidden speakers, violins weaving romantic melodies with cello undertones that set a sophisticated, seductive tone, the notes lingering in the air like whispered promises. Guests arrived in elegant waves—about two dozen beautiful couples, their attire impeccable: men in tailored tuxedos of black and navy with silk lapels that caught the candlelight, women in gowns of silk and velvet that hugged their figures with graceful sensuality, fabrics in rich colors like sapphire blue and emerald green swirling as they moved, all faces concealed behind elaborate Venetian masks—porcelains painted with mischievous harlequins' grins and jester bells that tinkled softly, majestic birds' beaks with plumed crests that fluttered with each turn of the head, and enigmatic phantoms' swirling patterns of gold leaf and jewels that sparkled like stars, each mask a unique masterpiece that added layers of mystery and allure to their identities, transforming familiar friends into intriguing strangers.

Marco and Sofia, as gracious hosts, greeted each arrival with warm embraces and air kisses on masked cheeks, their own outfits radiating an aura of hostly elegance and allure—Marco's midnight blue tuxedo sharp and commanding, Sofia's crimson gown flowing like wine. Once everyone was present, they gathered the group in the center of the salon for a toast, the candlelight flickering across their masked faces like stars in a night sky. Marco raised his glass high, his voice resonant and charismatic over the murmurs: ""Dear friends, both longstanding and newly met—thank you for gracing us with your presence on this enchanting evening in our beloved Venice. In this city of secrets, bridges, and hidden canals, behind these masks, we are liberated to embrace our truest selves, unburdened by the judgments of the world outside. Let the night unfold as it will—may it be filled with joy, profound connections, and perhaps a whisper of mischief that lingers in our memories long after the dawn."" Sofia added with a sultry, inviting smile, her crimson gown catching the light like flowing lava, ""To mysteries unveiled, desires fulfilled, and the magic of anonymity that allows us to explore without fear—salute!"" The group cheered enthusiastically, glasses clinking in a symphony of crystal that rang through the room like celebratory bells, the sound echoing off the high ceilings.

The party started with refined, elegant energy—guests mingling in small clusters around the room, sharing animated stories of Venetian lore passed down through generations like treasured heirlooms. But as the champagne flowed freely—bubbly and crisp, loosening inhibitions with each effervescent sip that tickled the palate—and the hour grew later, the atmosphere shifted subtly, the frisky undercurrent bubbling to the surface like the bubbles in their glasses. A couple in one dimly lit corner began with heavy petting: his hand sliding up her thigh under her flowing sapphire gown, fingers disappearing beneath the fabric to trace patterns on her inner thigh as she bit her lower lip, suppressing a moan, her own hand tracing his chest through his tuxedo shirt, unbuttoning slowly to reveal tanned, muscular skin beneath, her nails raking lightly to elicit a low groan. Another pair kissed deeply and passionately, their masks bumping lightly as tongues tangled visibly in the candlelight, her fingers weaving into his hair to pull him closer while his large hands cupped her ass possessively through her velvet dress, squeezing the rounded flesh and pulling her body flush against his growing arousal, whispering, ""You drive me mad, even masked."" Light touches turned bolder—a woman trailing her manicured nails down a man's back, leaving faint red lines on his shirt as he whispered husky words in her ear, ""I can't wait to peel that gown off you,"" making her giggle and grind subtly against his thigh; a man nuzzling a woman's neck, his lips brushing the sensitive skin below her mask as her hand slipped inside his jacket to caress his chest, fingering his nipples until he hissed in pleasure.

Finally, the dam broke with a bold, unapologetic act that ignited the room: a woman in a peacock-feathered mask, her gown a swirling masterpiece of blues and greens that shimmered like iridescent plumage under the candlelight, dropped gracefully to her knees before her partner—a tall, imposing man in a harlequin disguise with diamond patterns glinting like stars. She unzipped him with deliberate slowness, her gloved hands trembling slightly with anticipation as she freed his hardening cock, licking it teasingly—her pink tongue tracing the prominent veins from the heavy base to the flushed tip, savoring the musky flavor before taking him into her warm mouth, sucking eagerly as her head bobbed with increasing rhythm, one hand stroking the base in twisting pulls while the other tugged on his heavy balls, rolling them gently in her palm to heighten his pleasure. Guests nearby watched with appreciative murmurs and widening eyes, the room's energy shifting palpably as she deepthroated him fully, gagging slightly but pushing through with determination, her throat constricting around his girth, saliva dripping down her chin onto the bodice of her elegant gown, strings of it connecting her lips to his shaft when she pulled back for air, gasping before diving in again. ""Suck it harder, my peacock slut—make me cum on that pretty masked face,"" he growled in Italian, his hands in her feathered hair guiding her, his hips bucking slightly as he came across her mouth and mask-covered face in thick, hot ropes—she opened wide to catch the spurts on her extended tongue, swallowing what landed there with a satisfied, throaty hum, licking her lips sensually as cum dripped down her chin in viscous strands, the act bold and unapologetic, her eyes gleaming with triumph behind her mask, saying to the watching crowd, ""Who's next?""

The sight ignited the room like a spark to dry tinder—the party transforming into a full orgy of masked hedonism, the classical music now a backdrop to the rising symphony of pleasure. Acts erupted everywhere in a cascade of uninhibited desire: in one alcove, a woman bent over a velvet chaise lounge, her gown hiked up to expose her lace panties pushed aside as her partner fucked her from behind with deep, rhythmic thrusts, his hands gripping her hips bruisingly as he slammed in repeatedly, her moans echoing like music as he slapped her ass lightly, red marks blooming on her pale skin like roses, whispering, ""Take it all, you masked vixen—cum on my cock while everyone watches""; nearby, two men sandwiched a woman between them, one plunging into her dripping pussy with steady, forceful pumps that made her breasts bounce beneath her low-cut gown, grunting, ""Feel us both filling you, slut—your holes are ours tonight,"" while the other claimed her ass from behind, their cocks rubbing through the thin wall inside her with delicious friction, her body rocking between them as she cried out in ecstasy, ""Yes—fuck me harder, stretch me wide, make me your double-stuffed whore,"" her mask slipping slightly from the sweat-slicked intensity, her nails raking down their backs leaving faint trails; a group of three formed on a thick Persian rug—a man lying back as two women rode him, one grinding her shaved pussy on his mouth with rolling hips, her juices coating his chin and lips as his tongue delved deep into her folds, probing and lapping hungrily, moaning, ""Taste how wet you make me,"" while the other bounced on his thick cock with enthusiastic downward thrusts, her breasts jiggling wildly with each impact, crying, ""Fuck yes—fill my pussy deep,"" their hands intertwined as they leaned in to kiss passionately, tongues tangling in a messy dance while they moaned in unison, ""Cum with us, share this cock like good sluts,"" their bodies glistening with sweat under the candlelight; another couple engaged in oral delights—a man on his knees eating a woman's pussy with fervent, sloppy laps, his tongue circling her clit rapidly before sucking it between his lips, his fingers pumping inside her slick heat in curling motions that hit her G-spot, making her stand on tiptoes, legs spread wide, her gown draped over his head like a curtain of silk as she gripped his hair and ground against his face, begging, ""Don't stop—eat this cunt like you own it""; a woman straddling a man's lap on a leather couch, riding him reverse cowgirl as he squeezed her ass cheeks hard, spreading them to watch his cock disappear into her, grunting, ""Bounce harder, you dirty masked bitch,"" her head thrown back in bliss as she circled her hips for added friction, moaning, ""Yes—stretch me, fill me up with that thick dick""; two women scissoring on the floor amid scattered champagne glasses, their pussies grinding together in wet, slippery friction, clits rubbing with delicious pressure as they panted and kissed, hands roaming breasts and pinching nipples, whispering, ""Rub that clit on mine—make us cum together, you sexy slut."" The air thickened with the heady, intoxicating scents of sweat-slicked skin, musky arousal, spilled champagne, and the floral undertones of perfumes, the sounds of slapping skin on skin, wet slurps of mouths on flesh, guttural moans, and whispered encouragements in multiple languages—Italian curses of pleasure like ""Cazzo, sì!"", French sighs of ecstasy like ""Mon dieu, plus fort!"", English pleas for more like ""Fuck me harder, you bastard!""—creating a symphony of uninhibited, masked passion where identities blurred but desires were laid bare in vivid, erotic detail.

Sofia glided through the throng of masked revelers like a crimson specter, her flowing gown catching the flickering candlelight and casting shadows that danced across the salon's terracotta floors. The orgy was in full bloom around her—moans and gasps weaving a tapestry of sound, bodies intertwining in depraved harmony, the air heavy with the musky scent of sweat and arousal. She spotted Noah and Emma on the periphery, their hands intertwined, watching the chaos with a shared intensity that hinted at something deeper than the casual indulgence of the other guests. Sofia's brown eyes sparkled behind her gold-and-red feathered mask as she approached, her hips swaying with deliberate allure.

""Darlings,"" she purred in her melodic Italian accent, her voice cutting through the nearby sighs of pleasure like a silken thread. ""I hope you're enjoying the party—it's turning out even wilder than I imagined."" She leaned in closer, her full lips curving into a wicked smile, the plumes of her mask brushing lightly against Emma's lace one. ""But I wanted to properly welcome our new guests... the two of you. After all, you've brought such fresh energy to our little gathering.""

Before either could respond, Sofia dropped gracefully to her knees in front of them, the crimson silk of her gown pooling around her like spilled wine. Her hands moved with confident precision—first to Noah's tuxedo pants, unzipping them swiftly and freeing his thickening cock from its confines. It sprang free, already semi-hard from the night's atmosphere, veined and pulsing in the dim light. ""Mmm, look at this,"" she murmured appreciatively, wrapping her manicured fingers around the base and stroking slowly, her thumb circling the head to spread the beading precum. She leaned forward, her warm breath teasing his skin before her full lips parted and enveloped him, sucking deeply with a wet, slurping pull that made Noah groan low in his throat. Her head bobbed rhythmically, cheeks hollowing as she took him deeper, her tongue swirling along the underside with expert flicks.

As she pleasured Noah, Sofia's other hand slid up Emma's thigh, fingers tracing the smooth skin beneath the high slit of her black gown. ""And you, beautiful,"" she whispered around Noah's cock, her voice muffled but sultry, ""let's not leave you out."" Her hand ventured higher, under the dress, rubbing Emma's pussy through the thin lace of her panties. The fabric was already damp, and Sofia's fingers pressed firmly, circling the swollen clit with teasing pressure that made Emma's breath hitch. ""So wet already... I love welcoming guests properly.""

Emma and Noah turned to each other, their masked faces inches apart, and made out passionately—lips crashing together in a deep, hungry kiss, tongues tangling as Noah's hand cupped Emma's breast through her gown, squeezing gently. ""She's good, isn't she?"" Noah whispered against Emma's mouth, his voice rough with arousal. Emma moaned into the kiss, her hips grinding subtly against Sofia's hand. ""Mmm, yes... but nothing like us,"" she replied breathily, nipping at his lower lip.

Sofia hummed in approval around Noah's cock, the vibration sending shivers up his spine. She hiked up Emma's dress further, exposing the sheer babydoll lingerie and the lace panties beneath. With a deft tug, she pulled the panties to the side, revealing Emma's shaved, glistening pussy. ""Delicious,"" Sofia murmured, leaning in to lick a long, flat stroke along the folds, savoring the tangy sweetness before focusing on the clit with rapid flicks of her tongue. Her hand continued stroking Noah's cock in rhythm, twisting at the base as she sucked the head, her cheeks hollowing with each pull.

Noah broke the kiss with Emma momentarily, his blue eyes dark with desire behind his mask. ""Join her, Em,"" he commanded softly, his voice laced with affection. ""Show her how it's done.""

Emma nodded, dropping to her knees beside Sofia with graceful eagerness. The two women worked together now—Emma taking Noah's cock into her mouth, sucking him deep with fervent bobs, her throat constricting around his girth as she gagged lightly, while Sofia lapped at his balls, sucking them gently into her mouth and rolling them with her tongue. They switched seamlessly, Sofia deepthroating him while Emma licked the heavy sac, her tongue tracing the seam and tugging lightly with her lips. ""Mmm, he tastes so good,"" Sofia purred during a brief pause, her hand stroking him. Emma smiled, whispering to Noah so only he could hear, ""All for you, big bro."" Their mouths met over his shaft in sloppy kisses, tongues tangling messily as they slobbered on him, drool dripping down.

Noah groaned deeply, his hands in their hair—Emma's auburn waves soft and familiar, Sofia's dark curls thick and luxurious. ""Fuck... that's it,"" he rasped, his cock throbbing as he came hard, thick ropes spurting across both their faces, splattering their masks, cheeks, and lips. Sofia opened her mouth to catch some, then turned to Emma, making out with her passionately—lips pressing together in a heated tangle, tongues swapping Noah's cum back and forth in messy exchanges, strands dripping down their chins as they moaned into each other's mouths.

Sofia pulled back with a satisfied lick of her lips, wiping a stray drop from her chin. ""Delicious welcome,"" she said with a wink. ""Now, it's time the two of you went and had some fun with some strangers—explore, indulge, let the masks set you free."" She rose gracefully, sauntering over to Marco, who lounged nearby. They made out hungrily, her hands roaming his chest as she straddled him, mounting him and sinking onto his cock with a soft moan, her crimson gown hiking up as she began to ride him slowly.",1,1770740196.0,u_jl5879,0,1.0,False

Tina liked Rahul since they were in class 9 but Rahul was already in a relationship with a girl but they broke up when Rahul was in class 12.

Rahul and Tina were good friends and both came in a relationship after sometime. Rahul told everyone about Tina, his friends, family. Tina was their choti bahu and Rahul called her mother “mummy”. Rahul would send her cheese cakes and flowers every month on her periods and pick her up from her college(25kms) even wait for her outside the college for hours. According to Rahul, he could never get a girl better than Tina. His Instagram was filled with their pictures.

Cute story?

Here comes the real twist.

Rahul met a girl, let’s call her Anjali. This girl used to work at a bank where Rahul used to visit. Anjali developed a crush on him but never talked to him. Rahul could feel it and he would even try to get his work done through Anjali only and that’s how there numbers got exchanged. One random day Anjali received a text from Rahul, “Hello! Coffee after work?” Anjali was on cloud 9 and said yes but they planned a date for some other day. He picked her up from her workplace and took her for a coffee. He told her he was not interested in relationships since he was more focused on his career and Anjali too had a heartbreak recently so she said she wasn’t looking for a relationship either. Rahul asked for something casual and Anjali agreed because she was really in that headspace totally unaware about 2 years relationship between Rahul and Tina. They started meeting at hotels for casual sex and this went on for 2 years. In these 2 years she developed feelings for him but couldn’t tell him out of fear of losing him. She had a feeling he was hiding something but everytime she confronted him, he made it look like it was her mistake asking him anything since it was casual and eventually she stopped questioning him. On a random day after 2 years, Anjali found out about Tina and by this time Tina and Rahul had completed 4 years together. Anjali being a girl’s girl, told everything to Tina. Tina broke up with Rahul but they eventually got back together in just a few days. Anjali even got to know how Rahul used to flirt with other girls while being with Tina. Meanwhile, Anjali got name called and a home wrecker by their friends. Rahul went on telling everyone that Anjali meant nothing to him. Her feelings were made fun of. Anjali was hurt but she moved on. Rahul and Tina are back together now.

15 months later, at 4am on a random morning, Anjali received Snapchat and 6 back to back calls from Rahul. She asked him what did he want and he went on to tell her he wanted to meet her one more time to have a closure sex, that he was still with Tina but he missed time spent with Anjali(sex) but Anjali denied. He kept pursuing her for 6 months and she kept denying. Eventually he stopped. Now few months ago, she again received back to back calls from him at 6am and then an apology that he was drunk. He did it again, 7 calls early morning and Anjali was unaware about their marriage. He kept doing it until 3 months before their marriage. She didn’t tell this to anyone, why would she when she was disrespected the first time. Recently she got to know Rahul and Tina are getting married on 10/02/2026. She ain’t doing anything about it, just a little surprised as to how one can forgive someone who kept cheating on them deliberately for 2 years and even after that(of course she wasn’t aware about this).

Tina thinks she is so blessed but girl you won at what cost. Rahul you are a piece of shit. ",4,1770740140.0,RelationshipIndia,6,1.0,False

I was already feeling really tired after work and felt like a coffee instead of the gym. She seemed happy at this idea and totally normal at first. 

Lately she’s been going through it - with her license being suspended, work stress and financial problems all which she is working towards. Her licence is to be suspended a month from now and she can still drive til then. She’s communicated to me that she’s been feeling quite sad and lonely and doesn’t have great friends to hang out with. But she goes to the gym almost every day and is studying her masters and doing pretty good at work. 

After she picked me up I put music on in her car to which she said not to because in our country you can’t put music on when a driver is driving as you can get fined for that. I thought she is being unreasonable but she said she just doesn’t want any more fines or to lose any more demerit points while she can still drive. I still put on music and promised her I would turn it off if I saw any cops. I started talking about my day and work to which she didn’t really respond, I asked her if she doesn’t care and she said she does but she’s just focused on driving and doesn’t want to be distracted. 

Then I started to ask her about her life and how she plans on getting around in a bus - and that she should probably start getting used to taking public transport. She said yeah she will. I asked her about job searching, studying etc and she all of a sudden got really silent, I looked over and it looked like she was crying while driving. I asked her if she was crying and got no response. We stopped at the coffee shop and she didn’t even get any coffee and said she didn’t feel like it. She then parked the car and said she’s not feeling well and wants to go home. I thought this was really odd and that I made her mad about something so I said we should just sit here for a bit. She started to cry more and looked like she was having a breakdown. She stopped responding to me completely and we just sat in silence. I tried to make knock knock jokes to make her laugh and talk but she cried even more and said she needs to go home. I felt weird about this and asked her if she’s mad at me a few times and could see her getting frustrated when I asked her this. She said she’s not mad at me and just wants to go home. 

She started to drive me back to drop me but because she was crying so much I asked her that I can start to drive. So she just parked and said she needs a moment but she’s okay. I offered to drive her car home but she said that would make her feel a lot worse and that if I feel unsafe I can uber it home. I still asked her if I can just drive her car but she declined and said she will get home just needs some time and I can catch an uber. I decided to stay with her and she eventually started to drive again to my home and got better. As I was leaving I could see she was visibly distressed again so I asked her again is she okay  and she said she is just anxious and needs to talk to someone and that I won’t understand. I still stayed with her for a while and eventually she wiped her face and tears and explained that she is just worried about life right now and that me asking her all those questions triggered her a bit but she’s okay and just feeling anxiety. She said that she’s not mad at me about anything and just worried about her life and doesn’t really feel like explaining things or talking right now. She said she doesn’t feel like joking right now and just needs some space. 

I understood… but I still thought it was a bit odd and random as this doesn’t usually happen and it seemed like a complete mood swing. I felt that she just got upset after seeing me and I don’t know what I did wrong. I don’t get why she is so stressed - I think she’s doing fine and all she needs to do is get out of her toxic job. She can start driving again in 3 months too which is not that big of a deal. AITAH for feeling this way? ",0,1770740012.0,AITAH,21,0.11,False

The safehouse was barely functional when the first mission fell into the team’s lap.

Power cables still ran across the floor. Half the whiteboard was blank. Medina’s wiring job buzzed when it shouldn’t. They weren’t ready for anything that called itself a mission.

That didn’t stop the world from knocking.

Martinez had been awake for hours, combing through missing children reports pulled from unofficial databases—church bulletins, sheriff Facebook posts, archived AMBER alerts that quietly expired.

At first, nothing stood out.

Then patterns emerged.

Multiple children. Different counties. Different years.

Same detail.

*They heard someone they knew.*

A parent.  
A sibling.  
A friend calling their name from the trees.

When Lou walked into the war room, Martinez didn’t bother with greetings. He grabbed Lou’s arm and pulled him toward the screen.

“Lou,” Martinez said quietly, “I think this is an *us* thing.”

Lou scanned the reports. His expression didn’t change.

“We don’t even have a thing yet,” Lou said.  
(beat)  
“But I get it.”

Martinez nodded. “It’s not clean. Not organized. But it’s consistent.”

Lou leaned back against the table.

“Do as much research as you can,” he said. “I want local legends. Oral stories. Interviews.”

Martinez frowned. “Kids lie.”

“They exaggerate,” Lou corrected. “They don’t fabricate patterns. Look for the common denominator.”



# APPALACHIA — THE DRIVE IN

The road narrowed until it felt like a mistake.

Appalachian trees leaned inward, branches clawing at the truck like they didn’t want it passing through. Fog clung low, swallowing headlights instead of reflecting them.

The BearCat’s LED system was top-dollar.

It still couldn’t cut more than twenty feet ahead.

Medina squinted at the windshield. “You think this fog’s paranormal fog?”

Lou side-eyed him. “This is just Tuesday in this part of the country.”

He drove slower than he should have.

Not cautious.

Uncertain.

This wasn’t Kandahar. There was no map that mattered here.

In the back seat, Jane sat with her hood up, hands folded in her lap.

She wasn’t watching the road.

She was listening inward.

The presence inside her murmured softly—unusually calm.

Mostly about Jane.  
Sometimes about Jeff.

Lately… about Lou.

*The parallels are inconvenient,* it whispered.  
*He survived. That bothers things.*  
*He’s afraid—but not of Jeff.*

Jane frowned slightly.

*Jeff will still find that fear,* the presence added.  
*Eventually.*



# THE CALL

The pastor didn’t ask questions he didn’t want answers to.

Martinez had reached out days earlier. The man responded with coordinates and a coffee invitation.

Livestock dead.  
Hikers missing in groups.  
Sounds in the woods that repeated what they heard.

That last part hadn’t been in the reports.

The locals didn’t say *monster*.

They said:  
**“Don’t answer it.”**

That was enough for Lou.



# THE TOWN

The town barely held together.

A church.  
A feed store.  
A few houses that all faced inward, like they were bracing for impact.

Shop owners greeted them.

Smiles too practiced. Eyes too alert.

Nolasco clocked it immediately. “They’re waiting for us to mess it up.”

Vega forced a grin. “Love being part of a learning experience.”

Jane’s eyes stayed on Lou.

Medina noticed. Nudged Nolasco.

Nolasco didn’t look. “Not what you think.”

Lou split the team without ceremony.

“Gonzales, Vega — shops. Ask questions.”

They nodded and moved.

“Martinez,” Lou said, “you’re with me.”

Jane fell in beside them.



# THE PASTOR

Coffee steamed between them.

Irish for Lou.

Jane declined. Lou didn’t push.

The pastor didn’t look afraid.

Concerned, yes. Tired. Protective.

But not afraid.

Martinez noticed immediately.

“You don’t seem panicked,” Martinez said.

The pastor smiled faintly. “Fear’s a luxury when people depend on you.”

Lou spoke before Martinez could press further.

“Faith,” Lou said quietly. “That’s what’s holding him together.”

The pastor nodded. “Only thing that ever has.”

Jane watched Lou carefully.



# THE LEGEND

Across town, Medina and Nolasco sat with an old man behind the feed store, eating something fried and unidentifiable.

Conversation drifted from fencing to predators.

Then the old man’s grandson spoke up.

“You mean the Goatman?”

Everyone went still.

“He walks like a person,” the kid said. “But he doesn’t move like one. And he talks wrong.”

Nolasco leaned forward. “Talks how?”

“Like he’s guessing.”



# THE BRIEF (IMPROVISED AND BAD)

Photos spread across the hood of the truck.

Goats opened cleanly. Bones rearranged. Symbols almost deliberate.

Medina frowned. “This isn’t ritual.”

“Then what is it?” Gonzales asked.

“Practice.”

Jane shook her head. “Doesn’t matter.”

Everyone looked at her.

“You engage it,” she said calmly, “it escalates.  
You chase it, it plays.  
You hurt it, it remembers.”

Lou didn’t like that.

“We still have to stop it.”

“Yes,” Jane said.  
(beat)  
“Just not the way you’re used to.”



# THE WOODS — NIGHT

They went in anyway.

Because they didn’t yet know how not to.

No drones. No perimeter. Just rifles and assumptions.

The forest went quiet too fast.

Then—

A child crying.

Vega turned instinctively.

Lou grabbed his vest. “Don’t.”

The crying stopped.

Something moved between the trees.

Not charging.  
Not hiding.

Repositioning.

Antlers scraped bark.

Jane didn’t look at it.

“It knows your voices now,” she said.



# CONTACT

Gonzales fired first.

The Goatman bolted—wrong angles, impossible speed.

Gunfire shredded trees.

Nothing landed.

Something screamed.

Mockery.

Medina slipped, barely stayed upright.

Vega laughed once, sharp. “Okay. That’s new.”

The Goatman reappeared behind them.

Too close.

It spoke in Vega’s voice.

“Relax. I’ve got you.”

Suppressive fire forced it back.

The shots *registered*.

They just didn’t matter.



# WITHDRAWAL

Lou didn’t charge.

He pulled them out.

Hard retreat. Swearing. Tripping. Firing to keep distance.

The Goatman didn’t pursue.

It never had to.



# AFTERMATH — CHURCH GROUNDS

No injuries.

No kill.

No victory.

Just breathing and shame.

“So,” Vega said, rubbing his face, “first job’s a bust.”

Jane shook her head.

“No.”

She looked at Lou.

“It learned you’re dangerous when you panic.”

Lou exhaled.

“We were reckless.”

“Yes,” Jane said.  
(beat)  
“Too much testosterone.”

She hesitated.

“But I was able to free some of the missing kids from its den.”

Everyone looked at her.

She hadn’t fought.

She hadn’t killed.

She had refused to engage.



# THE FIX

They didn’t hunt it again.

They fortified.

Lights. Bells. Noise.

The pastor spread the word.

Don’t answer voices.  
Don’t go alone.  
Don’t chase.

The attacks stopped.

Not because the Goatman was dead.

Because it now knew fear.

An old one.



# CLOSING

The road home was silent.

Finally, Gonzales muttered, “We’re not ready.”

Lou nodded. “No. Story of our lives.”

(quiet)  
“But we will be.”

Jane looked out the window.

She hadn’t bled.  
She hadn’t killed.

And for the first time since the fire—

she helped without becoming worse.

Inside her, the presence stirred.

Not angry.

1r14t1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalabuse/comments/1r14t1j/part_six_of_my_story/,part six of my story,"Just a couple of weeks after the confirmation at Walmart, I received a call from Mrs. A. She said she would be visiting in a few days and needed to speak with RPA about something important, asking me to pass along the message. By that point, I had stopped wearing my wedding ring. To me, it had become nothing more than a painful reminder that my marriage had fallen apart. The white and gold band, once beautiful with its half-carat diamond and smaller diamond chips along each side, now symbolized only sorrow.

Whenever RPA noticed my ring in its box, he would ask when I planned to put it back on. He made empty promises that he would change and keep me in his life. The day his mother was scheduled to arrive, he even begged me on his knees to wear the ring again. Reluctantly, I agreed, allowing him to slip it onto my finger once more.

When Mrs. A came to our door but did not hug RPA.  Instead, she slapped him across the face and snarled, “I raised you better than that.” RPA took the slap without protest, staring down at the floor in shame. I brought out a couple of chairs for her and D. Despite the warmth of that spring day, the atmosphere in the room turned cold as I served them some iced tea.

That was when RPA’s web of lies began to unravel, starting with Mrs. A’s confrontation. As I went to light a blue candle for RPA’s deceased son, Mrs. A stopped me, saying, “Don’t, sweetie—I have to talk to the boy.” I turned around, startled, wondering if she meant to communicate supernaturally with the child. But Mrs. A, noticing my expression, clarified, “No, he called the house via AT&T.” I stood there in shock, unable to speak, looking from RPA to his mother. I told her, “I swear to god I didn’t know.” She gave me a warm smile and replied, “I know.”

In an instant, RPA leapt to his feet, snatched his car keys, and bolted out the door. The three of us sat in tense silence as the sound of his Trans-Am tires screeching out of the parking lot echoed through the air. Mrs. A turned to me with a searching gaze and asked what RPA had told me, but I was still paralyzed by shock, unable to find the words. Instead of answering, I hurried upstairs and retrieved a copy of RPA’s résumé, handing it to Mrs. A. As she read through the details, her complexion paled, and then she silently passed the document to D, who examined it next.

It was in that moment that the reality of RPA's military service became painfully clear. Contrary to the stories she had shared, RPA had only served in the Marine Corps for approximately sixteen months, and his time ended with an other-than-honorable discharge. He had never left the United States, despite any claims to the contrary.

As the truth surfaced, memories from the past came rushing back. I recalled a particular incident when I discovered his driver’s license inside the tent, alongside his DD Form 214. On that occasion, I had glanced at the document and read a few lines, which revealed that RPA had broken a cue stick over his commanding officer’s kneecap. The altercation had occurred because the officer was speaking with RPA’s girlfriend at the time.

Until now, I had nearly forgotten about that event, but with the revelations unfolding before me, it suddenly stood out as another example of the secrets and half-truths that characterized our relationship.

The realization left me feeling as if I had wandered into a blizzard, completely lost and disoriented. I had to sit down. Looking up at Mrs. A, I saw her simply sigh, a sad acknowledgment that it was RPA’s decision whether or not to tell me the truth. I didn’t even notice when they left. Slowly, I removed my wedding ring and placed it on the coffee table, where its presence was stark against the forest green oval surface. The significance was clear: everything RPA had ever told me was a lie. Our entire life together had been built on deception. I had always been honest and open, but he had never given me the same in return, not even once.

As the weight of every lie pressed down on me, tears began to flow, each one accompanied by the painful repetition of his falsehoods in my mind. I don’t know how long I sat there, staring at the ring, until I heard the roar of the Trans-Am as it returned to the parking lot. I didn’t bother to look up when RPA came in. He paused at the base of the stairs while I sat on the floor, sobbing uncontrollably. Without looking at him, I asked, “Are your feelings for me real?” RPA stormed upstairs without saying a word, slamming the second bedroom door shut behind him, and then, at the top of his lungs, shouted a single word: “FUCK.”

After the confrontation with Mrs. A and the unraveling of RPA’s lies, our relationship began to deteriorate rapidly. By August of that year, things had reached a breaking point. We were facing eviction from our townhouse, unable to keep up with the bills on our combined incomes. I had returned to work at Wendy’s, despite my misgivings, because we desperately needed the money. Even with my job and RPA’s position at Walmart, our financial situation remained dire.

Working just a few blocks from the Walmart where RPA was employed, I often heard from coworkers or acquaintances if RPA was seen speaking to any other woman, Jess would tell them you know he is married. They would come by the restaurant to tell me about him. These constant reports cut deeply, and by that point, I had not only built walls around my heart but had constructed a moat around my soul—one that felt twenty feet deep and ten feet across. Sometimes, it seemed like RPA was calling out to me from the other side, but I was no longer willing or able to listen.

Eventually, we packed up all our belongings and placed them in a storage unit. We moved to a small town near the Kansas-Colorado border called Lumar, where a new Walmart was being built. RPA secured a job in loss prevention there, while I found work at Carl’s Jr. Known as Hardee’s on the East Coast. Though we tried to start over, the damage had already been done.

It wasn’t long before RPA returned to his old patterns—disappearing without explanation and leaving me alone to wonder about his whereabouts. I tried to be patient, holding out hope that things might change, but by the end of October, the inevitable happened. One evening, he walked into our room, sat heavily on the bed, and, without any preamble, declared that he no longer loved me.

I looked up from the television, stunned by his words. In that moment, something inside me snapped. Without hesitation, I pulled off my wedding ring and hurled it across the room in anger and pain. I told him plainly that if he didn’t love me, he was free to leave—and to “fuck off.”

The shock on his face was unmistakable. He scrambled to retrieve the ring from where it had landed, hidden behind the motel dresser. Returning to my side, he grabbed my hand and forced the ring back onto my finger, desperately trying to make amends. He leaned in, attempting to kiss me, and insisted, “I swear, babe, I was just joking.”

On the first day of November, a memory that remains vivid to me even after all these years, the events of that Sunday morning unfolded with a quiet intensity. I had go out to the car, hoping to find some change in order to finish our laundry. When I opened the glove box, I found, tucked among the papers, a simple engagement ring. The band was gold, with a stone larger than the one in the ring I was wearing. I returned the ring to its place and went back to our room, where RPA was sitting on the bed, absorbed in the start of the football game.

Somehow, the atmosphere in the room seemed to shift; the air felt colder. Sensing my mood, RPA turned to me and asked what was wrong. I met his gaze and responded with a single sentence, each word sharper and colder than the last: “I found it.” Instantly, RPA’s face turned pale. He tried to explain, “Honey, I wanted to get you something new—you know, new beginnings.”

I looked him in the eyes and reminded him, as I had many times before, that I hated regular gold. Without a moment’s hesitation, I threw my ring at him once again and declared, “I am done.” He immediately slid off the bed and dropped to his knees, pleading, “Please don’t leave me.” I wriggled out of his arms, determined to stand my ground and prove my point. I didn’t want to take the ring back, knowing it came from Walmart, I wanted one that was white gold. His face became even paler, and he simply stuttered, “I can’t.” I managed to free myself from his grasp, shaking my head no; I refused to let him see me cry again. I ran into the bathroom and splashed cold water on my face. As I looked into the mirror, it felt as if someone had taken a permanent marker and written “SUCKER” in big letters across the glass.

Moments later, I heard the roar of the Trans-Am coming to life outside, signaling to me that I was finally, truly done with this man. After that, I barely spoke to him at all. If I did, it was with brief, dismissive responses—“yeah, whatever,” or “sure,” or muttered under my breath, “I don’t give a shit.” Of course, the ring disappeared soon after I found it. He offered one excuse after another: “It’s safe,” or “It’s in a safety deposit box,” or even, “The dog ate it.” I just shook my head and walked away, unbothered by his fabrications. I was finishing my final plans to leave, knowing there was a Greyhound station just down the street from our hotel.

But about two days before I was set to leave, I heard his car roaring into the parking lot. His footsteps pounded up the stairs as if he were sprinting. He threw open the door with a frantic look and stared at me. “You’re leaving me,” he blurted out. I responded, “Damn it,” then looked at him and I asked, “How did you find out?” He explained that he had gone to pick me up from work, only to learn I had already quit, and my boss had called him “trash.” For the next few days, he begged me to change my mind. I told him plainly: if he wanted me to stay, he had to give me the ring. He just shook his head and said, “I can’t.” At that, I answered, “Oh well. I can’t stay.”

The day I left Colorado for the final time was marked by a sense of finality that I had never felt before. As I prepared to go, he continued to plead with me, begging me over and over to reconsider and stay. His desperation was evident, but I had already made up my mind. Then, amidst his pleas, he uttered words that solidified my resolve: “You are just like my other ex-wives.” Hearing that, I turned to face him and spoke with clarity that it was his actions, his choices, and his words—that had led us to this point. He was the one who had destroyed what we once had, the one who had dug the grave for our relationship and marriage. Without another word, I picked up my things, climbed onto that bus, and left without looking back.

In the months that followed my departure from Colorado, RPA discovered that I was staying with my mother and grandmother in North Florida. After the New Year, the only year I remember the Denver Broncos winning the Super Bowl—he drove all the way to Florida, bringing along a dog that was in heat and Missy. The visit was brief and tumultuous; it lasted less than a week before RPA was on his way back to Colorado and, inevitably, to another woman. My mother overheard him speaking with her on the phone, confirming my suspicions.

By the following Sunday, RPA had left once again. The pain of his absence lingered, and for a long time, I found myself unable to listen to Reba McEntire’s song “For My Broken Heart.” Every word of that song seemed to echo exactly how I felt during those difficult days. Then, not even a month later, RPA was calling me in a drunk state, crying about how badly he screw up our relationship. Please give him one more chance. I agree and sent him gas money for the drive. In the long run, I gave him only $ 100 because he had changed his mind, and he went and joined the Army. How I found out was that I was studying for my GED. I got a call from RPA telling me he was in basic training, looked at the receiver in my hand like it had grow other head, sure enough, he had joined the Army.

That summer, after much pleading from RPA, I agreed to attend his graduation at Fort Bragg. By then, I had dyed my hair a deep red and was embracing a new, Gothic look. I arrived in a short black dress and six-inch heels wrapped around heels, drawing the attention of everyone present. I simply smiled behind my dark lipstick, unfazed by the stares. When the ceremony ended, RPA turned to me, his face full of shock at my transformation. But at that point, I was beyond caring what any man thought I should or shouldn’t do.

After his initial surprise faded, we went to lunch with Mrs. A. During the meal, RPA excused himself to use the restroom. While he was gone, Mrs. A confided in me that RPA woman had more or less stolen the Trans-Am, leaving him penniless. She then asked me directly about my intentions towards her son. I was honest with her—I told her I was finished living in any man’s shadow and that it was time for me to forge my own path in the world. Mrs. A simply smiled and said, “Good for you.”

Later that night, I did sleep with RPA, but I made him wear a condom. Once it was over, he rolled over and went to sleep, but I lay there feeling nothing for him—no spark, not even a trace of affection for the man beside me. The next morning, while he was in the shower, I took off my ring and left it on a note on the hotel stationery. I told him to keep everything, not to look for me, and not to call my mother. I ended the note with a simple goodbye—my final farewell.

After that summer, I decided to start fresh. I got a tattoo and began to reinvent myself, becoming just another face in the local Gothic scene. My journey eventually led me to Kentucky, where I spent the next two and a half years building a new life. During this time, my family kept a close eye on RPA, especially since he had lied to the military by claiming we were not still married. That lie resulted in a financial benefit for me, as I received a substantial check, which I used to fund my move to Kentucky.

In 2002, an unexpected turn of events unfolded. I had lost my ID and needed to get a new one, so I made my way to Fort Knox. There, I received surprising news. Before the clerk could turn the computer screen away, I caught a glimpse of RPA’s records and saw that he had remarried. The date of his new marriage stood out—it was February 14 of that year. I couldn’t help but chuckle at the irony. I realized in that moment that I was no longer bound to him; we were truly finished, and I could finally move on with my life.

In 2005, I learned through RPA’s Myspace post that he had been seriously injured while serving in Afghanistan. According to his message, he had lost his leg from the knee down, an eye, a testicle, and part of his small intestine while guarding a children’s hospital. The news was shocking, and I needed confirmation. I called his mother, who solemnly told me that it was all true. She explained that RPA had crashed twice on the operating table, fighting for his life. I could only offer to pray for him. She thanked me quietly before hanging up the phone.

A couple of weeks after the events that had finally brought me closure with RPA, I was jolted awake in the early hours of the morning by the persistent ringing of our phone. It was 3:00 a.m., and Papa Bear, clearly irritated by the interruption, mumbled that someone had better be dead to justify calling at such an ungodly hour. When he picked up the phone, she asked if she could talk to me. I was met with the sound of RPA’s fourth wife, her voice trembling and filled with anguish as she sobbed uncontrollably on the other end.

Through her tears, she accused me of being the reason RPA had ended up in the barracks, demanding to know how I could have done something like that to her. Her words were laced with desperation and confusion, but I had no patience left for the tangled web of his life or the drama that inevitably followed him. I responded flatly, telling her, “Well, you’re the dumbass who married him in the first place,” and promptly hung up.

After I returned to bed, Papa Bear pulled me close, a hint of amusement in his voice as he remarked, “That was cold.” I simply rolled over, unfazed, and went back to sleep, leaving the chaos of RPA’s world behind me once and for all.

For many years after leaving Colorado and closing that tumultuous chapter with RPA, I found a sense of peace in my life. It wasn’t until 2011 that I began attending Lander and enrolled in a speech class that old memories resurfaced. For one of my assignments, I chose to speak about the signs of emotional and physical abuse—subjects I knew intimately from my own experiences. My history included living with men who inflicted both physical and emotional pain; one had hurt me physically, while the other, RPA, was a master of emotional manipulation.

On a warm October day, as Papa Bear drove me to school, our conversation drifted to the past. He joked, wondering aloud how strange it would be if I were still connected to ‘one leg man’—our nickname for RPA at home. I quickly told Papa Bear to stop, not wanting to invite thoughts of RPA back into my world. Yet, as I prepared my PowerPoint for class, curiosity led me to contact El Paso County records office to obtain copies of relevant paperwork. To my disbelief, I discovered that RPA had knowingly committed bigamy at least once. I had married Papa Bear in 2002, believing that chapter with RPA was firmly closed. The truth was shocking, but I was grateful to have finally moved on and found happiness with a wonderful man.

In October 2012, just a year after my speech class revelation, I witnessed a moment that brought everything full circle. At the courthouse, I watched as RPA was rolled up the wheelchair ramp in a chair. He was no longer the man I once knew. Years before, he had been proud of his baldness, wearing it like a badge of honor, much like a fellow Texan in the wrestling world. Even after injuring himself playing softball, he insisted on wearing jeans during the summer months until his leg healed—a testament to the vanity he once held.

After learning about RPA’s devastating injuries, it became clear that the man I once knew was now forever changed. He was confined to a body that no longer matched the vibrant, glory-seeking spirit he had so desperately clung to in his youth. Seeing him being wheeled in by another woman, I was struck by the realization that the admiration and validation he had spent his life chasing had ultimately led to unimaginable loss. The price of that pursuit had been far greater than he ever anticipated.

With that final revelation, I felt a sense of closure. The chapter of my life that had been overshadowed by RPA’s choices and my own pain was finally ending. With a stroke of a pen, I closed that part of my story, filing it away as another footnote in the larger book of my life.

With these reflections, I close this last chapter, hoping that my story offers some comfort or understanding to those who may read it.

Good luck, I hope you find your own happy ending

I (28) met with a guy (24) on the apps like four weeks ago, we actually ended up matching on a few of them. We got along quick and I asked him out and we had a date planned. I realized early on that he takes numerous days at a time to respond to texts sometimes, which actually led me to believe he was ghosting me after we made plans before he got back to me like 4 days later with rapid fire texting and we exchanged numbers and moved off the apps. 

Long story short, our date fell through because of a blizzard. We tried to meet up for coffee a few days later, but I ended up at the wrong place, so we were going to make plans to try again after the weekend. I reached out and he was responsive, but the moment I tried to make plans again he went radio silence and it's been a week now. I am not proud to say that there are like three unanswered texts from me over a few days close out the thread.

I know people say nothing is real until you meet irl, but we almost did. I also know I shouldn't message him again, its creepy and only hurts my dignity, but it just felt like there was a lot of potential here. All our last texts was him throwing around date ideas and then boom, ghosted out of nowhere.",1,1770739490.0,askgaybros,3,1.0,False

He sighed in frustration and muttered that he needed to take the call. Before leaving, he grabbed my wallet and keys, ensuring I could not escape while he was gone. Then, with determination, he headed for the front door. It closed. I looked up at the prison door, sure there were no bars, but when RPA did, I had become his prisoner, and he was the warden. I knew no one was coming to save me. The familiar roar of the Trans-Am filled the air as he started the engine, pulled out of his parking spot, and sped away, leaving me shaken but alone.

Alone at last, I crawled into the downstairs bathroom, overwhelmed by a wave of nausea that soon overtook me. After vomiting, I ran upstairs, desperate to rid myself of the lingering taste and sensation. I brushed my teeth—once, then again—trying to reclaim a small measure of control and comfort.

In August, a turning point in our relationship unfolded. RPA descended the stairs, a sheet of paper from Western Airlines clutched in his hand. As I glanced at the document after it was placed on the coffee table, it became immediately apparent that it was a flight reservation to Florida. He looked at me with a determined expression and announced that we needed to spend some time apart. However, he made it clear that, during this separation, staying with my family was not an option he would allow.

The situation was further complicated by the involvement of a couple we both knew. March or April  before the sh!t really  hit the fan hard; they approached RPA with a request: they wanted to borrow money to finance their own move to Florida. Without hesitation, RPA agreed and handed them approximately $2,000 to assist with their relocation. On the night the couple arrived to collect the money, all three turned to me as if seeking my approval. I raised my hands, distancing myself from the decision, and stated firmly, “Nope, not getting involved in this.” Despite my reluctance and clear stance against loaning money to friends, RPA proceeded with the transaction.

By the fifteenth of  August, I found myself boarding a plane to Florida. RPA sent me off with a cashier’s check for $1,500. Once the check cleared at the bank, I began using those funds to pay their bills and manage household expenses for the people I was staying with. Additionally, nearly $500 was spent on craft supplies, which, in the end, were left unused and simply accumulated dust on the screened-in patio of their rental home.

While I was away in Florida, my neighbor  aka Jess and her roommate kept me informed about everything occurring back home. It quickly became evident that RPA had turned our house into a revolving door for women. Multiple times, different women were seen leaving my home, making it clear that his behavior was blatant and recurring.

One Sunday afternoon, Jess decided to stop by the house. She later called to recount what she had witnessed: RPA answered the door in nothing but his boxer briefs, and inside was another woman, dressed in only one of his shirts. Jess confronted the situation head-on, making a pointed remark: “Wow, does your wife Jean know about this? With one phone call, she would be back here and this time she would not miss with her bat.” According to Jess, both RPA and the woman turned pale at her words. The tension escalated when, moments later, Jess heard a screaming from our home then women making the statement she had just realized, “You are married!

As the woman hurried out the front door, only partially dressed, RPA had managed to put on a pair of shorts. Jess, unfazed by the chaos, was casually seated on the down of her truck, eating popcorn and watching the dramatic scene unfold. According to Jess, after the woman sped away, her car tires screeching as she left the parking lot, RPA approached Jess with a glare and warned, “You will not tell Jean anything.” Jess, however, simply smiled back at him and replied, “Oh, she knows—and a lot more than you think.”

What RPA failed to realize before sending me to Florida was that he had neglected to take my bank card for our joint account. This single oversight became my means of staying connected to our financial situation, even while separated by distance. From afar, I regularly logged in and examined each transaction, watching as large sums—sometimes thousands of dollars at a time—were withdrawn week after week. The money that disappeared had originated from his father's inheritance, and seeing it dwindle so rapidly left me increasingly anxious. I paid close attention to when our rent and bills were due, double-checking the remaining balance and recalculating our finances with each update. As I tracked the mounting withdrawals, it became painfully clear that the financial security we once relied on was eroding, and my position left me powerless to intervene.

After Jess and her roommate made their presence known, RPA ceased bringing women back to the townhouse, fully aware that they were keeping a close eye on his activities. However, this did not signify a genuine change in his behavior. Instead, I soon observed a clear shift in our financial transactions. Charges from upscale hotels began to surface, with names that were all too familiar to me due to my past work experiences in housekeeping and at the front desk of these establishments.

One such hotel was the DoubleTree, a landmark known for being one of the tallest buildings downtown during the late '80s and early '90s. Its reputation for spacious and expensive suites on the upper floors made the substantial charges on our accounts stand out even more. The transactions from the DoubleTree and other similar hotels made it evident that, although RPA had changed his approach, his actions remained essentially unchanged—he simply shifted the locations of his behavior from our home to high-end hotels.

Separated by more than 1,500 miles, I could do nothing but watch from afar as our bank account dwindled, the balance eventually falling to less than $2,500. In less than a year, nearly all of the money was gone. The days after my birthday in October brought a turning point. RPA called to say he needed to visit a sick female family member in Lubbock, Texas, and would be gone for the weekend of Halloween. When I asked who would look after Missy in his absence, he assured me she would be fine for a couple of days.

 After that phone call, my decision was clear: my sweet Missy needed her mama. Despite the objections and protests from the couple I was staying with, I boarded a Greyhound bus in Florida, determined to return home to Colorado. The journey was long and marked by changing weather. As the bus crossed the Mississippi River, heavy rain gave way to sleet, and by the time we entered Texas, snow had begun to fall. A couple of hours’ delay in New Mexico slowed our progress, but as we finally crossed into Colorado, I gazed out the window, recognizing places from my childhood. We stopped briefly in Pueblo, Colorado—a fifteen-minute drop-off that signaled I was almost home.

As my journey home neared its end, I decided to act and confirm my suspicions. First, I called Jess to ask if she had seen any activity at the townhouse and whether RPA was there. Jess assured me that he was indeed at home and mentioned that a strange car had been parked in the visitor spot for several days, only adding to my growing unease. I thanked her for keeping an eye on things, then, doing my best to remain composed, I dialed the house number from a pay phone.

RPA answered on the second ring with a casual ""hello."" In the background, I heard a woman's voice say, ""Babe, who is that?"" My heart pounded as I hesitated before finally speaking. With as much calm as I could muster, I told him, ""That woman needs to be gone because I am only an hour away, and you'd better pick me up at the bus station.""

RPA sounded stunned, replying, ""You’re joking."" Instead of answering, I pulled the phone away from my ear, letting the sounds of idling Greyhound buses roar through the receiver so he would realize where I was. Suddenly, I heard him yell, ""Shit!"" and the line filled with frantic he forgot to hang up the phone commotion  on the other end as he warned the woman in the house, ""You need to leave now because my wife has a bad temper."" The un-know women screaming “ you are married,” then the line went dead, I smiled other small victory for me. An hour later, the bus pulled into the downtown terminal. There was RPA leading the Trans-Am as I climbed down; he looked like a child who had been caught with his hand in the cookie jar. I am haunted by that memory and doubts. He had insisted that it was a movie in the background, but I knew better—I could see through the lie. All I wanted was to avoid sleeping on those sheets, knowing they had been used by others with questionable intentions and filthy habits. I looked up at RPA and twisted, smiled, and called all of them “nasty, rotten crotches,"" having been there filled me with disgust and dread. RPA turned paler. I just smiled and told myself, “Got you, sick fucker.”

Later that night, we drove together to the Walmart near our house. The car ride was heavy with silence—I couldn’t bring myself to speak to him, my thoughts swirling with anger and suspicion. I kept my face pressed against the window, watching the glow of the streetlights stretch and blur past as we made our way down the main drag.

At the store, I picked out new sheets, pillows, a mattress pad, and a can of Lysol. The idea of sleeping on anything that those women had used made my skin crawl. I couldn’t stop thinking about head lice, bed bugs, or whatever else an unwashed body might have left behind. I wanted to reclaim at least a sense of cleanliness and control, so I made sure to get everything I needed to make the bed entirely new.

Once we got home, the unmistakable scent of strong, cheap perfume hit me as soon as I walked in the door. The smell clung to everything, a stark reminder of what had happened. Clutching Missy in one of my arms, I grabbed my trusty bat from the closet and began to check the house, starting downstairs. After making sure everything was clear, I headed upstairs, first stopping to look in the room with the computer and all his models, then into the bathroom.

Finally, I entered the bedroom. As expected, the waterbed had been stripped, and in the corner was a pile of sheets, pillows, and the mattress pad—ripped, as if it had been torn off in a hurry. The scent of cheap perfume was overpowering, saturating the discarded bedding. I glanced at RPA with a dark, pointed smile and remarked, “That must have been a bitch, because you ripped the mattress pad.”

After wiping down the waterbed mattress, I finished making the bed with my new mattress pad, sheets, and pillows. I took a long shower, hoping to wash away the lingering sense of contamination and unease. Settling in with a book, I tried to find comfort and reclaim the bedroom as my own space, free from the memories and suspicions that haunted me.

Later that evening, RPA came upstairs. He lay his head on my lap and tried to snuggle close, his tone soft and reassuring. “Honey, nothing happened, I swear,” he insisted. But I could see through the act. I was too exhausted to argue, so I told him I was tired and turned away, focusing on getting some rest and distancing myself emotionally.

From that moment forward, everything changed inside me. I no longer felt like the same person who had endured doubt and uncertainty—I began to transform into someone stronger, more resolute, and unwilling to be ignored or deceived any longer. My resolve hardened, and I felt a force within me determined to confront the truth, no matter how painful.

About a week later, RPA left for his trip back to Texas. During his time away, the truth behind his web of deception finally began to come undone. As soon as I watched him drive out of the parking lot, the house phone rang—his mother was calling. Sensing an opportunity, I asked her directly about the relative in Lubbock that RPA claimed was gravely ill. Her response was weary and honest: “Sweetheart, we don’t have any family in Lubbock.” In that moment, every last shred of RPA’s story collapsed, revealing just how far his dishonesty had gone.

After I hung up with Mrs. A, I hurried upstairs. RPA had carelessly left behind a stack of printed emails—correspondence between himself and a woman from Missouri, as well as someone in Lubbock. As I read through the messages, I learned they had been making plans to spend a romantic Halloween weekend together. Each new discovery fueled my anger and heartbreak, and the storm within me grew stronger. I also noticed two separate phone numbers from two different states attached to those emails, which only confirmed the complexity of RPA’s lies.

Determined to uncover the whole truth, I went to the computer and looked up the area codes for the phone numbers. Then, I walked to Walgreens, where I knew there was a pay phone. By the time I arrived, dusk was settling in, and the air had grown cold, but the fire inside me kept me moving. I dialed the first number, which was in Missouri, since he was in Texas. A man answered, and I introduced myself, explaining that our spouses were cheating on us with each other. He responded with a heartbreaking sigh, then asked if I was certain. I described what I had found in the emails about their plans to meet in Texas, and I told him that the messages were intimate in nature.

When he asked if I could read some of the emails to him, I refused, explaining that I was in a public place and didn’t want anyone to overhear our conversation. He let out another sigh and then requested that I send him copies of the emails instead. Agreeing to his request, I wrote down his address and prepared a thick tan envelope containing the correspondence. The next day, I went to the post office, handed the package to the clerk, and paid nearly two dollars in stamps to send it off to Missouri. As I let the envelope go, a grim sense of satisfaction washed over me—I thought to myself, “mess with a bull, you get the horns.”

Before I made it home, my pager started vibrating insistently in the front pocket of my jeans. The display showed “RPA 911” followed by his number. I glanced at the small, blue-green, clear device in my hand, smirked, and spoke softly into the air, “Let RPA know how dead air feels.”

As I stepped into our townhouse, the house phone was ringing nonstop. Checking the Caller ID, I saw it was the number of the other woman in Texas. Without hesitation, I unplugged the phone from the wall, then went upstairs and did the same with the phone there. Finally, I sank down onto the couch and took a long, deep breath—it felt like I could breathe again.

I turned on the TV for background noise, and soon after, Jess knocked on the glass screen door. I told her to come in, and she sat down beside me on the couch. She shook her head in disbelief and finally asked, “What did you do?” I explained everything to her. She shook her head again and said, “Man, you are cold.” I just gave her a warm smile and thanked her, especially for all her help. Later, Jess, her roommates, and I decided to unwind with some drinks at the Cowboys’ Halloween party in a couple of days. But the next day Jess came over and told me RPA was blowing their house phone because ours would just ring also. By this point, I placed my pager tin he towel closet upstairs so I could not hear it.

After some time, I decided to plug the house phone back in. As soon as the front door closed, Jess was headed back to her place, and the phone rang almost immediately. Glancing at the Caller ID, I saw it was the same number from before. I let it ring twice before answering, and it was RPA on the line. In the background, I could hear a woman sobbing uncontrollably. It seemed her husband had called her to confront her about the affair, and she was pleading with me not to send the emails, explaining that she and her husband had a prenuptial agreement. RPA was also begging me not to send them. I assured them I hadn’t sent anything, though in truth, that was a lie.

Before ending the call, I disconnected the phone from the wall again and told RPA to enjoy his weekend, because I intended to enjoy mine. That Halloween night would become the best I’d had since turning twenty-one. Before heading to the club, I stopped at the liquor store and picked up a couple of packs of Zima. During my period of exile, thanks to my own husband, I’d learned that I could drink Zima with minimal side effects, so I enjoyed a few drinks and danced in the clothes I chose for myself—not those RPA wanted me to wear.

Everyone at the party ended up pretty everyone was trashed, except for me. I was sober enough to drive us all back in the car that RPA’s dad had left him, even though I probably shouldn’t have been behind the wheel. That night, I discovered that I actually drove better with a standard transmission after a few drinks in me, and since I knew every back road, I got everyone home safely. The only trouble was parking—I couldn’t find a spot in the lot, so I left the car in a space on Yuma. I got plenty of grief for my parking job, and as I reached my door, I could hear my friends singing off-key about my parking skills, making fun of me as I laughed along.

After closing the front door behind me, I grabbed another bottle of clear liquor, letting the alcohol help wash away the tension that still lingered from the evening’s events. The more I drank, the less the stress weighed on me—it was the best release I’d felt in a long time. Time slipped away unnoticed, and before I realized it, the first hints of dawn were creeping in. I glanced over at the coffee table, now crowded with empty bottles, evidence of my desperate attempt to quiet my mind. When I tried to shake my head, I could still feel the buzz humming through my body. Somehow, I managed to get myself ready for bed and climbed beneath the covers, Missy curling up peacefully in my arms. I drifted into a deep, heavy sleep.

I have no idea how long I slept before I was startled awake by the unmistakable roar of the Trans-Am pulling into the parking lot. Sitting up, I stared at the closet doors, a chill settling over me as I realized my feelings had turned cold toward the man driving that car. I laid back down, listening intently as RPA opened the front door, he must have noticed all the empty bottles scattered across the coffee table. I heard him climbing the stairs, two steps at a time. As he approached, I reached up and switched on the light above my head, mounted on the waterbed  headboard. From the doorway, RPA’s voice cut through the silence, “You’ve changed.” I looked over at him and, with a wicked smile, replied, “Whose fault would that be, hmm? Go look in the damn mirror. To see who cause this change.

That afternoon, after I drifted back to sleep, I woke to the sound of him cleaning out the room. He gathered bags of papers threw way in dumpster outside, seemingly unaware that they were destined for a broken man. When can back in the bedroom then he just glanced at me like ha-ha you not have the evidence anymore, I met his gaze with a calm smile. My composure must have unnerved him, but I felt nothing but a cold acceptance about everything that had transpired.

By November 4^(th), things took a deadly turn. He was upstairs in that room when I heard his pager buzzing again. Suddenly, he rushed downstairs and looked at me where I sat quietly on the couch watching TV. ""I have to take this,"" he said. RPA approached and tried to kiss my cheek, but I placed my hand over his mouth, refusing the gesture. He left.

Within five minutes of leaving, he returned—the roar of the car tires screeching into the parking lot still echoing in the air. My instincts told me to hide, but I was finished playing nice. Bursting through the front door, RPA was so furious that he nearly broke it. His entire body trembled with pure, unfiltered rage as he glared at me. ""You lied,"" he snarled. I looked him in the eyes and simply asked, ""About what? “You mail those emails,"" he spat out.

I didn’t deny it. I smiled and replied, ""Yes, I did. Not to her, but to her husband—because his wife couldn’t keep her legs closed and chose to cheat with another man. Actions have consequences.""

With that, RPA roughly shoved the coffee table aside and yanked me up to my feet. He snarled again, his words laced with accusation: ""He hit her and is filing for divorce on the grounds of adultery.""

I looked up at RPA and, unable to hold back my contempt, started laughing at him. I said, “Good,” letting my anger show. In response, he threw me to the floor, calling me a cruel, heartless bitch. Looking up at him, I told him plainly, “You made me this way.” I managed to stand and tried to escape, heading upstairs to put some distance between us.

Suddenly, I heard Jean—he was sitting on the couch, holding the Glock. The gun was pointed at me once again. Reacting instinctively, I dropped to the floor behind the stairs, making sure there was something to shield me from the weapon. Everything felt like it was happening in slow motion as RPA fired a hollow-point round in my direction. For years after, I could still recall the smell of cordite, the sound of ringing in my ear, and the heat of the bullet as it embedded itself in the wall. If it had traveled just a few more inches, it would have lodged in my left shoulder.

The shock from RPA’s actions was written plainly across his face, his complexion drained to white as he stared at both the gun and me. Seizing the opportunity, I scrambled upstairs, locking myself in the bathroom and climbing into the tub, desperate for any sense of safety and a moment to gather my thoughts.

1r14qxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalabuse/comments/1r14qxz/part_three_of_my_story/,part three of my story,"Word about RPA being married to me spread quickly, and it wasn’t long before my reputation preceded me. Apparently, the story of how I handled things with the bat traveled fast—so much so that, according to what I heard, the doorman at that particular strip club actually kept a picture of me by the entrance. It was as if they thought I might storm in at any moment, though, truthfully, I had no intention of ever setting foot in a place like that.

The confrontation with RPA and his companion at our home did not remain a private incident—it quickly sent shockwaves through RPA's social circle, especially among his friends and the staff at the local strip clubs. News of my actions spread rapidly, and soon, my name became synonymous with the story of how I stood my ground that night. Even the employees at the club seemed to be on alert, behaving as if they expected me to storm in at any moment. Despite the rumors and the newly acquired reputation, I was resolute in my decision to avoid any place tied to RPA’s betrayals.

The notoriety that followed was never something I sought out. Instead, it became an unintentional but powerful reminder—to myself and to others—of just how far I was willing to go to protect my dignity and assert my personal boundaries. The story, now a part of local lore, underscored the seriousness of my resolve and the lengths I would take to defend what mine was.

Only a few days had passed since the explosive events at our home when RPA made the choice to return to the same strip club. He seemed determined to act as though nothing had changed, clinging to a sense of normalcy despite everything that had happened. Yet his efforts were quickly thwarted. Less than an hour after leaving, he stormed back into our house, his anger palpable and his voice echoing through the rooms as he hurled accusations at me. He shouted that I had ruined his night, making it clear that he held me responsible for his misfortune. The reason for his fury became apparent: he had been banned from the club, a direct consequence of the reputation I had earned after the confrontation. As he ranted and blamed me for the situation, I met his glare with a calm, knowing smile and simply held his gaze. Inwardly, I recognized that sometimes, life has a way of balancing the scales, delivering its own form of justice whether or not we seek it.

 After RPA began sleeping on the floor in that room, a new and unsettling routine emerged: the phone calls. Jess, ever resourceful and supportive, showed me how to listen in on these conversations. It didn’t take long before we found ourselves staring down a staggering $500 a month phone bills, the result of RPA’s endless hours spent calling women across the country.

These weren’t just casual conversations. Time and again, I overheard him engaging in explicit phone sex—sometimes with the speakerphone on, forcing me to hear every word against my will. The experience was so disturbing that I found myself wishing I could wash my ears out with bleach, desperate to erase what I’d just heard.

One night, Jess and I sat together, listening to yet another call. To my shock and horror, I realized that RPA was speaking with girls who were clearly underage—one admitted to being sixteen, the other just fifteen. Their conversation quickly turned to plans for the girls to come to our home and meet RPA in person. Unable to remain silent, I snatched the phone and put an immediate stop to the situation. I made my position clear: “Oh hell, no. I will not have jailbait in my house. The minute you set foot on my doorstep, the cops will be called, and you’ll be sent back to your parents.”

The fallout from intercepting that troubling phone call was immediate. RPA charged down the stairs, his face contorted with fury, hurling insults and calling me a crazy bitch. Rather than backing down, I met his anger with a calm, defiant smile. “Oops, did I mess that up for you? My bad,” I quipped, refusing to let his rage intimidate me. The tension in the air was punctuated by Jess, who couldn’t help but burst into laughter—so much that she nearly fell out of her chair. RPA, caught off guard and realizing that Jess had witnessed everything, was left speechless. I seized the small victory, bowing dramatically to Jess and blowing a kiss in RPA’s direction—a symbolic gesture of triumph amid the chaos that had unfolded.

A few days later, Jess and I sat together at the dining room table, the silence between us heavy with the aftermath of everything that had recently transpired. She quietly observed me, noticing the tension in my posture as I gripped my glass of soda with both hands. I felt the urge to reach for something stronger to numb the relentless stress, but my medical condition made that impossible now. The risks of alcohol mixing with my medication were too great, so I held on to my resolve, choosing my health over momentary relief.

My mind drifted to the earlier chapters of my life, when coping with hardship often meant seeking refuge in self-destructive habits. In those days, I turned to underage drinking, hoping the numbness would dull the pain that weighed on me. With a large glass of Jack Daniels became my escape whenever I could afford it, while Jim Beam served as a cheaper substitute when money was tight. On the most difficult nights, when there seemed to be no other options, even Mad Dog 20/20 was enough to quiet the turmoil inside.

Yet, as time passed, I came to understand the consequences of those choices. The relief was temporary, and the spiral of self-medicating only compounded the struggle, especially as new health challenges emerged. It was a lesson learned the hard way—that turning to alcohol provided no real solution and inevitably made things worse. Now, faced with the pressures and stress that still arise, I am determined to prioritize my well-being above all else. No matter how strong the urge to escape may be, I choose to protect my health and resist the temptation to fall back into old patterns.

Sensing my unease, Jess leaned in with a look of concern and quietly asked what was troubling me. I exhaled slowly, the weight of exhaustion heavy in my chest, and finally found the words to express what I had been holding inside. “I’m just tired,” I confessed, my voice barely rising above a whisper. I tried to explain the strange comfort that used to come with certainty, no matter how painful the reality. “At least with a beating, I knew when the hit was coming.” My gaze drifted around the room as I gestured helplessly, attempting to capture the overwhelming sense of dread that now permeated my days. “But this—” I said, letting my hand fall to my lap. “This is so much worse.” The unpredictability, the constant anxiety, and the fear of what might happen next felt far more unbearable than any physical pain I had endured before. The uncertainty gnawed at me, leaving me feeling more vulnerable and exposed than ever.

 As Jess and I sat together at the table, I finally found the courage to voice the fear that had been consuming me for days. My hands trembled as I wrapped them around my glass, searching for words that felt nearly impossible to say aloud. With my voice barely above a whisper, I confessed, “I’m terrified to get close to my husband.” The admission made my vulnerability feel raw and exposed, the weight of recent events pressing heavily on my shoulders.

The anxiety gnawing at me was relentless. After everything RPA had done, the betrayals, the secrecy, and the countless nights spent wondering where he truly was, I found myself plagued by an overwhelming sense of dread. The fear that he might have brought home an STD haunted me constantly. It was a possibility I had never anticipated, a consequence I neither asked for nor deserved. The idea of facing such a risk, not because of anything I had done, but solely because of his choices, filled me with a profound sense of injustice and fear. Because of this, I refused to let him touch me at all, determined to protect myself in whatever way I could.

Unable to meet Jess’s eyes, I lowered my gaze, my words faltering. “I know he’s been sleeping with those strippers,” I admitted, each syllable heavy with resignation. Saying it aloud made the reality all the more undeniable. The trust I once had in my marriage had been shattered, replaced by uncertainty and the constant worry of what else might be waiting for me as a result of his actions.

Jess reached across the table and squeezed my hand, offering a small measure of comfort during a moment of vulnerability. Sensing my distress, she attempted to reassure me, her tone gentle as she asked if I was truly certain about what RPA had done. Unable to find the words, I simply raised an eyebrow in response—my silence speaking volumes about what I already knew.

“A man who comes home with his clothes, his skin, everything covered in body glitter and reeking of cheap body spray—there’s only one explanation, Jess. Only one,” I told her, my voice steady despite everything. Jess didn’t argue with me; the understanding in her eyes was clear. She nodded softly and replied with a quiet, “Oh,” acknowledging the painful truth without judgment.

I let out a long sigh, exhaustion washing over me. The truth could no longer be denied. “It all makes sense,” I confessed, the realization settling heavily in my chest. “He leaves the house with at least seven hundred dollars in his wallet and comes home with a hundred and fifty—or less. I know exactly where all that money is going—straight to some woman in stripper heels and a thong.” As the words left my mouth, they seemed to linger in the stillness, the painful reality impossible to ignore. The gap between what I wanted to believe and what I knew had grown too wide to bridge.

That afternoon, a heavy tension settled over the house, almost as if it had taken on a physical form. Suddenly, the sharp bang of the bedroom door slamming shut upstairs echoed through the rooms, a clear signal that trouble was brewing. Not long after, RPA appeared at the bottom of the stairs, his movements sluggish and his look disheveled. He was still wearing his red sweatpants, the ones with ""USMC"" spray-painted in bold, longhand letters down one leg. The fact that he looked as though he had just rolled out of bed—even though it was well past one in the afternoon—made the atmosphere feel even heavier, his disheveled presence adding to the unease that already gripped the house.

RPA’s eyes darted to Jess before settling back on me, signaling that he wanted to speak with me in private. Sensing the tension in the room, Jess responded with quiet understanding. She stood up gently, her movements soft and deliberate, and as she passed, she laid a comforting hand on my shoulder. Leaning in, she whispered for me to call her later—a subtle but meaningful gesture of support. I managed only a nod; my attention locked on the sky-blue placemats spread across the dining room table. My heart raced as I braced myself for whatever was about to come.

Anxiety rose up inside me, tightening my chest with familiar dread as I silently hoped RPA wouldn’t lash out at my face or head. Even as I kept my gaze lowered, I was intensely aware of how close he stood. From the corner of my eye, I tracked his hand as it paused near my head. Slowly, he reached out—not with aggression, but with an unexpected gentleness—and turned my face toward him. Despite his touch, my wary eyes stayed fixed on the off-white carpet beneath the dining room table, conditioned by past experience to avoid making eye contact.

RPA spoke in a soft tone that was unusual for him: “Jean, look at me.” For a brief moment, I glanced up and met his hazel eyes. In that instant, I thought I saw remorse flicker across his face—a rare and fleeting vulnerability. But just as quickly as it appeared, the remorse vanished, replaced by the familiar flash of anger that immediately put me back on edge.

In an instant, RPA's demeanor shifted from defensive to hostile. He snarled at me, making it clear that how he spent his money was none of my concern. He asserted his authority by reminding me that I was his possession, reducing our relationship to the symbolism of the ring on my finger. The message was unmistakable: I had no say in the matter. Then, as if to drive the point home, he forcefully pushed me out of my chair and walked away, leaving me shaken and vulnerable on the floor.

That night marked a turning point. Fearful of what might happen next, I stopped sleeping in our bedroom. Instead, I moved downstairs to the couch, always keeping a bat within arm’s reach—either tucked under the couch or resting on our green coffee table. Sleep became elusive; I remained vigilant, never fully letting my guard down. If I heard RPA coming downstairs, I would quickly escape to the bathroom and lock the door, waiting until he returned upstairs before emerging.

By the fourth day, the relentless anxiety and lack of rest finally caught up with me, and exhaustion overcame my defenses. I drifted into a deep sleep, only to wake the next morning in our bed with RPA’s arms wrapped tightly around me. He apologized, his voice soft as he said, “Hon, I’m so sorry I scared you. I love you so much.” Despite his words, I could only make myself go stiff, turning to look at my side of the bed. I wished for a normal mattress instead of the waterbed mattress with high frame and its dark red bumper pads, and longed to slip free from his iron grip, desperate for distance and safety.

The fragile peace between us lasted only about a month. During that time, I found myself having to accompany RPA everywhere he went, even when I desperately wanted to be alone. On one particular day, as we drove down the road in his Trans-Am, he reached across the center console, took my hand in his, and pressed a kiss to the back of it. As he did, he whispered that he loved me. He explained that his cold, distant exterior came from his experiences in the USMC, as if that justified everything.

That day, I learned the real reason he wanted me with him. We drove down I-25 and pulled into the parking lot near PetSmart, where a new store had just opened—a gun store. When we parked, I turned to look at him, searching his face for any hint of his intentions. RPA just smiled and said, “Come on, sweetheart, we need a few of them in the house. You know I’m from Texas—it’s good to have a couple around.” The only thought running through my mind was that we lived in the middle of Colorado Springs, Colorado, a city with plenty of police and, undoubtedly, plenty of guns already.

He took my hand and held the door open for me as we walked inside. RPA picked out a shotgun first, then led me over to where the handguns were displayed. Standing there, a chill ran through me—despite it being a warm June day, it felt as if I were standing on the side of Pikes Peak, buried in an eight-foot snowdrift wearing nothing but a bikini and socks. The sensation was so strong it was as if a rabbit had just run over my grave.

After browsing for a while, RPA selected a 9mm Glock. I can still picture that gun: black, with a hint of dark blue shining under the store lights. As the clerk worked on the paperwork, a sense of dread settled over me. My first thought was, “F@ck, I’m going to die.” When the salesclerk finally placed the Glock back in its box, I looked up and caught his eye. In that glance, I saw everything—an unspoken apology, a silent acknowledgment of my fear.

In the days following our unsettling trip to the gun store, I found myself unable to recover emotionally. The tension lingered, never giving me a moment to breathe. Within a week, RPA had disappeared again. There was more that strip club in Colorado Springs at the time, and since RPA was banned from one, I asked Jess to follow him. She called me from a pay phone and confirmed my suspicions—RPA was at another club, this one closer to Fort Carson.

Hearing the familiar roar of the Trans-Am as it pulled into our parking lot sent my nerves into overdrive. I couldn’t take it anymore. I moved quickly to the bottom of the stairs and opened the front door just as RPA entered through the glass screen door. He looked at me with a strange expression, then sat down heavily on the couch. Without warning, he turned to me and demanded, “What the f@ck is your problem now?”

The tension in the house had reached a breaking point. The Glock, no longer hidden away in the downstairs closet, now sat out in the open on the coffee table, its presence impossible to ignore and deeply unsettling. I felt utterly depleted; every ounce of energy drained from my body. And  I sat down in the middle of the staircase with a heavy weight, the weight of everything pressing down on my shoulders. Slowly, I gripped two of the staircase posts, more for emotional support than physical stability, and took a shaky breath and looked at RPA throw the wooden vertical spindles of the staircase. My voice came out small and tired as I finally spoke: “I’m tired, R,” I said quietly. “I can’t do this anymore. In the morning, please drop me off at the homeless shelter. You win.”

RPA remained seated on the couch, his gaze fixed on me with an intensity that was both unsettling and unyielding. It was as if my words had landed a physical blow—his face drained of color, the shock evident in his features. That pale expression quickly shifted, and his complexion transformed, flushed with pure, unmistakable rage. In a chilling response to the emotional confrontation, RPA reached over and picked up the Glock, his actions underscoring the volatility of the moment. RPA's demeanor shifted abruptly as he pointed the gun at me, his eyes narrowed with anger. His voice was sharp and accusatory as he snarled, “What the f@ck did you say to me?” The sudden outburst shattered whatever fragile calm had existed, amplifying the tension in the room. The intensity of his reaction left me feeling cornered and vulnerable, uncertain of what might happen next.

RPA fixed me with a hard stare and declared, “You are mine.” The words echoed with chilling finality, reinforcing the sense of ownership he held over me. I remained rooted to the spot, paralyzed by fear, convinced that any movement—no matter how slight—could have provoked RPA to unpredictable violence. The possibility that he might shoot me, perhaps even just for his own twisted amusement, kept me utterly still. In that moment, the threat was palpable, and my only instinct was to avoid drawing his attention further.

The tense standoff between us was finally interrupted when RPA let out a chilling, evil laugh. He locked eyes with me, his expression filled with menace, and made it explicitly clear that I would not be allowed to leave him—at least, not until he decided it was acceptable. His words were firm and controlling, reinforcing the sense of entrapment that had come to define our relationship. In that moment, any hope I had of escaping was crushed under the weight of his authority and the unmistakable message that my freedom depended solely on his permission.

As the shock wore off overwhelmed by terror, I rushed upstairs and immediately locked the bedroom door. Determined to create a barrier between myself and any potential threat, I barricaded both entrances: one that led to the bathroom and the other to the upstairs landing of our townhouse. The only time I dared to unlock either door was when Missy, my cat, meowed insistently to come inside. I opened the door , I let her in, grateful for the comfort of her company. I slept on the floor, positioning of the waterbed between myself and the barricaded doors, hoping it would offer some sense of protection.

That night, sleep eluded me entirely. Paralyzed by fear, I lay on the floor next to Missy, my heart pounding with every sound that echoed through the house. Each creak and footstep sent my thoughts racing, convinced that RPA was coming upstairs to continue what he had begun earlier that evening. The anxiety was relentless, and I remained on high alert, unable to let my guard down for even a moment.

The next morning, I moved through the house with extreme caution, each step down the stairs feeling as if I were walking on eggshells. My only goal was to avoid waking RPA, who was passed out on the couch. With every careful movement, my mind churned with escape plans—desperately searching for a way out of the townhouse and onto a bus that would take me downtown to the homeless shelter. Each obstacle intensified my anxiety: I realized I needed money for the fare, but using my bank card was out of the question. RPA could easily track any transaction, and the bus stop across from our bank provided a direct route downtown, raising the risk of being seen or intercepted. I mentally mapped out possible hiding places if things went wrong, and though the thought of calling my sister for help crossed my mind, the overwhelming anxiety made that option seem impossible.

My wallet—a small, black and silver lifeline—sat just a few feet away from me. Reaching it felt as daunting as crossing a deep ravine without a bridge. I crept quietly across the living room, inching toward the wallet and the hope of freedom it symbolized. Halfway there, I stopped and glanced back, needing to be sure RPA was still asleep. But I was horribly mistaken. His hazel eyes were open, watching me. In that instant, my hope vanished. The wallet, my only means of escape, now seemed impossibly out of reach. Before I could react, RPA rose from the couch.

He closed the distance between us in three long strides, his imposing presence magnified by the physical disparity between us. Standing at just 5'5"", I was completely overshadowed by his six-foot frame and solid build. The difference in our sizes was undeniable, and as he towered over me, the reality of my situation became unmistakably clear—I was utterly trapped.

The memory of that moment still lingers painfully, a dull throb pulsing at the back of my head each time I recall it. I remember the exact instant RPA woke up; there was no warning before he was upon me. In one swift, overpowering movement, he pinned me tightly against the closed downstairs bathroom door. His hand—so much larger than mine—easily seized both of my wrists, forcing my arms above my head and holding them there with an iron grip. The weight of his body pressed into me, rendering any attempt at escape impossible. Leaning down so that his mouth was close to my ear, RPA whispered in a cold, mocking tone, “Where are you going, sweetheart?” The menace behind his words was unmistakable, and the sense of helplessness in that moment remains vivid and raw.

With his free hand, RPA slid his fingers up my shirt, rubbing my chest as he whispered in a low purr, “Come, love. I have missed you so much. I just want to make love to you again and prove that my love for you is real.” His touch was invasive, and his words rang hollow given the tension and fear that filled the house.

RPA stopped rubbing my chest and then gripped my chin to make sure I was looking up at him, his smile turning wicked. He demanded a kiss, insisting that we forget the last few months, declaring, “You are my life.” Ignoring my resistance, he forced me into a kiss—not a gentle RPA stopped rubbing my chest and then gripped my chin to make sure I was looking up at him, his smile turning wicked. He demanded a kiss, insisting that we forget the last few months, declaring, “You are my l.” Ignoring my resistance, he forced me into a kiss—not a gentle gesture, but a harsh act. He refused a kiss on the cheek, instead forcing my mouth open and pressing his lips to mine in a French kiss I did not want.

Instinct took over as I tried to defend myself, aiming my knee toward RPA's groin in a desperate attempt to break free. But he was quick; he anticipated my move and blocked it by positioning his own knee between my legs. My effort at resistance failed, heightening my sense of helplessness and leaving me feeling even more powerless in the moment.

As the tension mounted, it was as if my silent plea for rescue was answered by the sharp beeping of RPA's pager echoing from the coffee table. The interruption was sudden, providing a brief window of relief. RPA released his grip, and I slid down against the door, my body trembling from both exhaustion and the overwhelming sense of relief.

RPA walked over to the coffee table, picked up the pager, and studied the number displayed. He sighed in frustration and muttered that he needed to take the call. Before leaving, he grabbed my wallet and keys, ensuring I could not escape while he was gone. Then, with determination, he headed for the front door. The familiar roar of the Trans-Am filled the air as he started the engine, pulled out of his parking spot, and sped away, leaving me shaken but alone.

Alone at last, I crawled into the downstairs bathroom, overwhelmed by a wave of nausea that soon overtook me. After vomiting, I ran upstairs, desperate to rid myself of the lingering taste and sensation. I brushed my teeth—once, then again—trying to reclaim a small measure of control and comfort.

 When RPA returned, his demeanor had completely changed—he was pale and visibly shaken. He sat down heavily on our worn-out couch, clearly struggling to process what he had just learned. With a trembling voice, he explained that the note was from his mother, who had managed to locate him by using information from my previous job. During their conversation, she told him that his father had passed away and that she was already on her way to see him.

Mrs. A turned to RPA and, with genuine concern, asked why he hadn’t called to let his family know that he had gotten remarried. I was already aware that RPA had been married twice before me, so her question did not surprise me. Then, she asked when we had gotten married, and I told her it was in December of the previous year. Mrs. A smiled warmly at me and welcomed me into the family, her kindness leaving a lasting impression.

During our conversation, Mrs. A mentioned she wanted to set up a trust for RPA’s son. Sitting on the couch, I was taken aback; it became clear that she was unaware of her grandson’s fate. I turned to RPA and asked him if his mother truly did not know. Mrs. A looked at both of us, confusion evident in her expression. RPA then quietly told his mother that his only child had died, explaining that this tragedy was due to the poor choices of his first ex-wife.

 

Mrs. A’s reaction to the devastating news was immediate and profound. Her face turned ghostly pale, and if RPA and his brother had not been present, she might have collapsed right there in our living room. Recognizing her distress, I hurried into the kitchen and fetched her a glass of cold water, hoping it might help her steady. As the initial shock began to fade and the reality of her only grandchild’s death settled in, Mrs. A’s gaze fell upon a gold, well-worn picture frame sitting nearby. The frame held a cherished photograph of RPA’s son, illuminated by the soft glow of a blue candle. In my family, lighting a candle is a tradition that honors a child lost to death—a quiet act of remembrance.

Mrs. A turned to me, her voice trembling, and asked if the candle meant what she feared. I found myself unable to speak, so I simply nodded. Understanding washed over her as she gently picked up the picture, her hands shaking. She turned to RPA and, with heartbreak in her voice, asked why he had never called to tell her, or if he had ever informed his father. RPA quietly apologized and told his mother that he had never told his father either.

As 1997 approached, I found myself dreading the holidays. I never celebrated Christmas at the time, as it brought up other traumas from my childhood. When New Year’s Day arrived, it marked the beginning of subtle but significant changes in RPA’s behavior. The cracks in his carefully maintained mask became more apparent, especially after he received his settlements from his father’s estate.

When the weather permitted, RPA, long with his family we drove up to the land his father had owned near the Four Corners. This visit turned out to be both the first and last time I met my father-in-law. I helped scatter Mr. A’s ashes on the land, and as I walked back toward our cars, my eyes caught sight of animal bones—bleached white by the sun, stark against the cold and dark landscape. That image should have been a warning of what was to come.

Once all the checks from the estate cleared, I began to notice real changes in RPA. At that time, I was still working at Walmart but had been put on swing shifts. That’s when one of my “ghosts” from the past reappeared. I was joking around with my friend Jess in the store on Ash Wednesday, she couldn’t respond, something hit me so hard that it felt like my brain wanted to leap out of my skull and run a marathon around the store. It was then that I learned, because of that ghost from my past used my head as a hammer against the floor more than once years earlier, I had sustained brain damage. That day, I experienced my very first epileptic seizure, a challenge that would stay with me until this day.

Losing my job at Walmart marked a difficult turning point, especially as my doctors were still struggling to find the right medication for my condition. It was during this period of uncertainty that RPA’s true character began to emerge.

Once his settlement checks were cleared, RPA suddenly had nearly $250,000 at his disposal. Instead of using the money sensibly, he indulged himself with extravagant purchases. The first was a 1980’s Burgundy Trans-Am, complete with a gold Firebird emblazoned on the hood a turbo engine under the hood—a detail I remember vividly, the car’s driver’s side paint had rust near the back tire frame, a result of the harsh winter road salts in Colorado.

RPA’s spending did not end with the purchase of the car; he soon acquired a new computer as well. While I struggled to adjust to my health challenges and sought ways to cope, RPA retreated upstairs for hours at a time, painting his models and immersing himself in cybersex chat rooms with countless women. You may wonder how I discovered this. My curiosity eventually got the better of me one afternoon, and I sat down to read through some of the chat exchanges. What I found left me feeling deeply unsettled.

I went through those messages after RPA had left the house to purchase another model. Shortly afterward, I heard the distinct sound of his car returning to the parking lot. By that time, we were living in a townhouse on Yuma Street, a place I had chosen because it was still within my budget. I listened as the front door opened and closed, and heard him coming up the stairs toward me.

I sat in silence, unable to find the words to express what I felt as I stared at the computer screen and then at RPA. With tears streaming down my face, I finally managed to ask him one question: ""Why?"" RPA glanced at the computer, then at me, and his anger flared. He grabbed my arm, pulled me out of the chair, and snarled that I should mind my own business. Without another word, he shoved me out of the room and locked the door behind him.

My past experiences had taught me to keep my emotions bottled up, fearing that reacting might result in another violent outburst—perhaps even a blow to my face. So, I remained silent. Each night, I went to bed alone and woke with RPA snoring beside me. The medication I was on required me to eat, though I hated it, especially with the stress weighing on me. Most mornings, I would head downstairs, turn the TV  on low in hopes of not disturbing RPA, and work quietly on my cross-stitching.

On the third day after our confrontation, RPA began shouting, ""Jean, where are you?"" He hurried downstairs, still dressed in his boxer briefs, and sat on the coffee table in front of me. He touched my leg and apologized for overreacting. I simply nodded and returned to my cross-stitch pattern, recognizing his behavior as the beginning of his guilt phase.

A few weeks later, I unexpectedly crossed paths with my old friend Chris at the 7-11. We had been friends since grade school, and seeing him again after all those years brought a sense of comfort and familiarity during an otherwise turbulent time in my life.

Later that evening, Chris stopped by our apartment for a cup of coffee. While we sat together at the dining room table, catching up and sharing memories, RPA was upstairs, preoccupied as usual with his cybersex chat rooms. Suddenly, RPA must have heard our voices from downstairs because he stormed into the room, visibly furious. His anger was unmistakable as he demanded to know who the man sitting at the table was. I tried to calmly explain that Chris was just an old friend from years ago, but RPA was not interested in listening to any explanation. He abruptly told Chris to leave the apartment.

As Chris got up to go, he quietly slipped a piece of paper into my hand. In a low voice, he told me I could call him anytime—day or night—if I ever needed anything. With that, he left, and I was once again left alone with RPA and the mounting tension in our home.

As soon as Chris left, the atmosphere in the apartment shifted abruptly. RPA slammed the front door with force, his anger palpable as he approached me. His presence was menacing, and, without hesitation, he seized both my arms in a tight grip. He fixed his gaze on me and declared, ""Listen to me, Jean. You are mine, my wife. You are nothing without me. Got it?"" The intensity of his words and the aggression in his actions sent a wave of fear through me, a feeling I hadn't experienced in years. I was deeply shaken, unable to find comfort or safety in my own home. That night, unable to face him or share the same bed, I chose to sleep on the couch, wrestling with anxiety and uncertainty about what might happen next.

The following morning brought a stark change in RPA's demeanor. Standing quietly over me, he appeared contemplative, his anger from the previous night replaced by a somber and regretful expression. His eyes reflected a deep sadness as he began to speak, offering an apology for his outburst.

Seeking to explain his behavior, RPA delved into the painful experiences of his past. He recounted memories from his previous marriages, describing the emotional wounds that still lingered. He spoke of one ex-wife, whom he held responsible for the tragic loss of his only child—a grief that seemed to haunt him. He also mentioned another marriage that had ended prematurely due to infidelity, leaving him with feelings of betrayal and disappointment.

As he finished sharing these memories, RPA reached out and gently touched my cheek, softly saying, ""Sorry, babe."" The sudden shift from anger to remorse left me feeling emotionally drained. I found myself struggling to navigate the cycle of fear and apology that had come to define our relationship, unsure of how to process the conflicting emotions that now surrounded us.

 

Less than a month after the confrontation, I began noticing troubling changes in RPA's behavior. He stopped wearing his wedding band, claiming he had lost it during a softball game. At first, I wanted to believe him, but a nagging doubt lingered in my mind.

Soon, his absences grew longer and more frequent. RPA would come home later and later,  until the point he came home between 2:00 AM and 3:00 AM, the time the strip clubs closed. Trust m,e I called one club to ask what the hours were. Each time, my gut instinct told me something was wrong. I tried paging him, hoping for a response, but only silence greeted me—nothing but dead air.

Driven by mounting anxiety and suspicion, I reached for the phone book, desperate to find answers about RPA’s whereabouts and the truth behind his late night came into the light.

 

In my desperation to uncover the truth, I closed my eyes and ran my finger down the phone book listings for local strip clubs. On the first number I finally, I mustered the courage to make a call. When someone answered—a man with a deep, gruff voice—I asked if he could help me, but he said he couldn’t. Refusing to give up, I pressed on, describing RPA’s appearance: light jeans, a tan shirt, and a red baseball cap. Suddenly, there was silence on the other end of the line. I took a deep breath and made my intentions clear and asked if man could pass a message on for me: if that man in that outfit wasn’t home within twenty minutes, there would be consequences meaning my bat  would meet his models. Then I hung up, waiting anxiously for what would happen next.

My frustration and desperation to reach RPA finally reached a boiling point. Determined to get through to him in a way that words could not, I marched upstairs to were he keep his  treasured model collection—his pride and joy, and possessions that meant more to him than almost anything else in our home. One by one, I carefully gathered the models, arranging them in a deliberate line across the downstairs area. These weren’t just small collectibles; they were impressive half-scale battleships and aircraft carriers, each one substantial in size. The smallest among them, the Arizona, stretched the entire length of my arm.

With all the models lined up in plain sight on the coffee table and the floor, I took my softball bat and readied myself for a practice swing. The message was unmistakable in both my actions and my resolve: I was prepared to use his expensive models as targets should he continue to ignore me and my growing distress. The threat was clear and direct—if RPA remained indifferent, his beloved collection would bear the consequences. In that moment, I wanted him to understand just how serious and determined I was to finally be heard.

Sure enough, within just fifteen minutes, I heard the familiar rumble of his Trans-Am pulling into the parking lot. He must have driven recklessly and broken several traffic laws because, under normal circumstances, it would have taken at least forty-five minutes for him to reach the front door from where he was. I turned off all the lights in the apartment and sat in the darkness, waiting for him on the couch with a softball bat placed prominently on the coffee table in front of me. As RPA burst in, flushed and out of breath, he immediately turned on the lights and began screaming at me, calling me crazy. I looked him straight in the eyes and replied with a sarcastic remark, pointing out just how quickly he had returned home. Then, with a snarl, I let him know that I was fully aware of the truth behind his late-night escapades. Without another word, I got up, headed upstairs, locked the bedroom door, and went to sleep. For the next couple of days, RPA barely left the house. He knew that I was serious, and that I had no qualms about treating his cherished models as mere pieces of plastic—items he had spent far too much money on—if he pushed me any further.

As time passed, RPA's true nature began to emerge more clearly. He installed a lock on the door where he kept his prized model collection, a move that seemed to signal a deeper change in his behavior. The unmistakable signs of infidelity soon followed. RPA would return home late at night, his clothing and even his skin reeking of cheap body spray. Sometimes, his bare skin sparkled with traces of body glitter—evidence he made little effort to hide. 

 Then one night, I heard that Trans-Am pull in front of our townhouse, and he walked in with some girl in stripper heels. She sat down on my white couch after that night. I wanted to burn that couch after she plopped her nasty, rotten crotch down her skirt. I could tell she did not have any underwear on.

As the tension in the room mounted, our cat wandered in, leaping up onto the coffee table. She settled herself among the chaos, her calm, unblinking gaze fixed on the scene unfolding before her. For a moment, her silent presence provided an odd sense of grounding, a reminder of normalcy in the midst of emotional turmoil. The cat simply observed everything from her perch on the coffee table, as if silently judging the absurdity of it all, while the rest of us grappled with the intensity of the situation.  Then it turned to me and made a statement that made my blood boil.

 

“You should be grateful your brother loves your retarded ass to let you stay in his home. “Without uttering a single word, I rose from my seat and walked into the kitchen. All the while, she continued to talk loudly, boasting about how RPA was paying her rent and covering her overdue car payments. She went on to say that once she moved into our home, both the cat and I would be forced out. According to her, she had no intention of living with a disabled person, and as for the cat, she made it clear that her dislike for felines meant our pet would have to leave as well. She even mentioned that she didn’t want any of her fellow dancers coming into a house with either of us there, describing how she intended to make the place her own—completely disregarding the life I had built and the home I shared with RPA.

 I walked over to the ledge between the living room and our small kitchen, where I kept my wallet. Carefully, I pulled out my ID, determined to have proof ready for what was about to unfold. My next thought was for Missy, our cat. I put down food for her, wanting to make sure she was safe and out of the way—especially since the woman sitting on my couch was about to face the consequences of her actions, and I didn’t want Missy anywhere near the chaos.

After ensuring Missy was occupied, I went to the cabinet above the microwave where I kept our important papers. I retrieved our marriage license, another piece of evidence to support my side of the story. The last thing I grabbed was the bat from the closet downstairs, a clear signal of my intent and the seriousness of the situation.

As I made my way back to where she sat, I recalled the urban legend that if a wife caught her husband cheating, she could kill both of them and somehow avoid jail time. It was just a myth, but the thought echoed the intensity of my emotions at that moment. Adding to my confidence was the knowledge that, at the time, Colorado had the “Make My Day” law on the books. Anyone who was uninvited or a stranger entering a home without permission, especially when not listed on the lease, had no legal right to be there. She certainly didn't have mine.

As I approached the woman sitting on my couch, her short skirt riding high, I could see her thong. She glanced up at me and turned noticeably pale. I realized that the look on my face must have terrified her—it was a cold, almost murderous smile. In that moment, I declared, “Really, I don’t have a brother—just a little sister,” and then pointed upstairs, clarifying that RPA actually just had an older brother. Without hesitation, I tossed my ID and our marriage license at her. She picked up the documents and examined them, her confusion mounting as she realized the truth of our relationship.

When she noticed the softball bat in my hands, I struck it against the arm of the couch, the impact reverberating through my bones. I warned her with steely resolve, “You have ten seconds—and nine of them are gone—to get the hell out of my house.” In a panic, she screamed and tumbled off the couch, crawling desperately toward the base of the staircase. One hof er heels snapped as she scrambled toward the front door, shrieking when the bat landed just inches from her feet.

At that moment, RPA came rushing downstairs, clad only in a towel and still dripping from his shower. I looked up at him and, with all the sarcasm I could muster, said, “I know incest is still illegal in the state of Colorado. When did I become your sister—since my maiden name is Eades, not A—” I pointed the bat at the woman again and announced, “Time’s up.” Raising the bat, I prepared to drive my point home as she cowered at the doorway.

 

In the chaos that followed, RPA grabbed the bat from my hands. He stared at the woman on the floor, her heavy makeup smeared and tears streaming down her face, before telling her to wait in the car. Turning to me, RPA accused me of acting crazy, then hurried off to put on some clothes. Undeterred, I followed him up the stairs and let out the most menacing laugh I could manage, warning him that he hadn’t seen crazy yet—and that he soon would see it.

The confrontation between us hit a boiling point as RPA, growing more agitated, raised his voice in an attempt to justify his behavior. He insisted that the woman was ""just a job,"" as though those words alone would erase the betrayal and turmoil he had brought into our home. I refused to let his excuses go unchallenged. Planting myself firmly in the center of the room, I crossed my arms and met his gaze with unwavering resolve. My voice remained steady, but there was no mistaking the firmness in my tone as I laid out the reality he was trying so hard to avoid. I made it clear that he, not the woman, was the one making the payments, and that those payments were for much more than the so-called arrangement he claimed. I recited, point by point, the explicit nature of what those payments truly represented, determined not to let him sidestep responsibility for his actions. Unable to face the truth, RPA hurriedly got dressed, his frustration mounting. He stormed out of the house, the sharp sound of the front door slamming behind him, leaving a resounding echo in the tense silence that followed.

The stress from the evening’s confrontation took its toll almost immediately, manifesting as a sharp, relentless headache that made it difficult to think clearly. Overwhelmed, I reached for the phone and called my friend Jess, desperate for a sympathetic ear. I tried to recount the events that had just transpired, but before I could finish explaining, my body betrayed me—a massive grand mal seizure seized control, cutting our conversation short. Thankfully, Jess was there for me in my moment of vulnerability. She managed to help me upstairs and get me safely into bed, despite my stubborn refusal to go to the hospital. The thought of another medical bill—one more burden to add to the stack—was simply too much for me to bear, so I insisted on staying home, clinging to the comfort of familiar surroundings and Jess’s steady presence.

1r14pg4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r14pg4,"It's an older code, Sir, but it checks out... My first impressions of the Qkz x Hbb","



















So, I recently bought the now quite old in iem terms Qkz x Hbb just to have a bassy fun set. They were rather inexpensive, bought them for 12 Euros.

As expected the stock cable and tips (it comes with 3 sizes of narrow and wide bore flimsy tips) are basic, they stayed in the small, but nicely holographic printed packaging.

Got a cable for it, the qkz t7, it was heavily discounted 3 Euros and some more tips to roll, the kbear 07 and 08.

First impressions:

Nice build quality, the shell feels sturdy, the nozzle is made of metal and has a knurling like lip to securely hold any tip. I dropped it many times in my journey to find a comfortable sound, not even a scratch. The face plate is made out of resin with golden metal inlays, in the background white lightning on black, it’s a bit over the top and reminded me of the ride the lightning cover from metallica, I kind of dig it, doesn’t take itself seriously that much, it knows its just a fun little thing.

wow, that’s a lot of bass (duh!) but the treble sounded somehow detailed and emphasized above the very recessed mids. My usual music is a lot of prog metal and there the bass overshadows everything, it was very fatiguing, the narrow bore kbear 08 made it even more extreme.

Penon liqueur orange tips helped a lot with the overall balance but made it unlistenable for vocal centric content like youtube videos, I had harsh plosives and severe sibilance predominantly with female vocals, pure torture (I bought them because I read in many reviews those are not sibilant at all lol)

Kbears coffee tips helped a lot (penon liqueur black a close second).

With that problem somewhat fixed I still got the impression that the FR was just too much imbalanced, too much fun if that makes any sense.

I went on peqdb and just for fun eq’d them to the Explorer and bam, coherence. The bass is tight, snappy (no more boomy bloat, but still very authoritative), the vocals sound more natural, still very warm but now sits firmly in the mix just like the guitars, the treble region delivers detailed, non distorted percussions, hi hats, cymbals all sound like part of the mix, not like trying to fake some detail by being overemphasized.

My feet start moving, usually a good sign, now no matter what comes in my random mix, it can handle it.

Holy fuck, listening to Opeth: coil, a song with acoustic guitar, lovely female voice, it sounds amazing. Beasty boys: Intergalactic, I turn that shit to 60%, my arms flapping embarrassingly arround the room, my dog looks at me funny, the beat…...drops what’cha want?

You could say I misunderstood the assignment with the qkz x hbb: bass go brrrr, hip hop, yo!

But I can assure you, to my ears, stock, it sounds like a mess, “bbbbfffffflllbblblblblbl tis huh?”

*Draconis Cluster, Vilantian Warship* Orphan's Rage

Misabel was packing. Not that she had much to pack, but at the same time the months of raiding had brought a level of excess to her shared quarters that needed a level of downsizing. As her hand moved over the pieces of memory, her mind wandered as her hand moved protectively over her torso.

Whatever else could be said about Lord Itrop, his nose was keen - the week with Leung had been one of the finest weeks she'd ever experienced, at least recently. She thought back further, to the day Commodore A'Mungd had gathered the skeleton crew that had remained on the ship and said that they were being given authorization for one final patrol before the ship was to be put to a different use. She'd known that they were deserting even as they moved out. She had to trust her lord, and that was enough. The early days were not easy, but they'd aligned themselves with others of like mind but not like origin and there had been enough success to make their path and the words of the commodore believable.

She'd heard the stories as time went on, that despite naming themselves as a Hurdop Freeclan Lord Itrop was somehow associated with the Ministry of War. The rumor was that he had been ordered to swallow pride and gather with others who could see the far future avoid and the ignominy it held. They were there to keep the Clan Way safe, and when Vilantia was ready to hear and follow they would return.

She'd heard other stories as well, the Executioner Freelord of Vilantia who had destroyed an entire clan even as the Vilantian news sources speaking first with grudging respect and subsequent passive acceptance of the foreign legion mercenary companies, and then seemingly full-throated approval - at least in public.

Privately it seemed there was deep resistance. The messages she saw spoke of the Freelord as if he were a mad interloper, and no amount of victory or benefit could outweigh the fact that he had not sworn himself to a proper Lord. The Commodore spoke deeply of his sorrow at having to leave Vilantia to her fate and create a new Vilantia from the ashes of Antares. But it didn't have a proper scent - as if the Commodore had taken all leave of his senses, and nobody dared to speak of it. Finally after another mission that seemed like they were simply making sure the carcass of Antares was going to be an easy mark for them, she'd met Lord Itrop - and vaulted into his close confidence, after a fashion. She would meet with him weekly, they would discuss her pregnancy, and she would receive attachments to send to her husband and his alter ego. The messages she sent to the alter ego made her fur flutter in embarrassment - but the content was meant to prevent the casual viewer from prying too deeply into the rest of the message.

Nothing about it felt right. It seemed the commodores and lords among them were filling their bellies and lining their pockets while the cantina served war ration cake twice a week and all other meals were either reconstituted or printed fare. There was obedience, and then there was - whatever this had become. An uncomfortable, covered cage with no idea what was outside save the promises of their superiors who said the outside was worse.

She had to be cautious when delivering the reports - disguising her scent by mingling with the Terrans in their midst and on one occasion causing a coolant leak that soaked her fur for days afterward. Lord Itrop was too well protected, and in his scent she knew he was calculating just how useful she was and the most efficient way to dispose of her when her utility to him had ended.

She was going to have to run, and the safest harbor within reach was Terra. After that, she could send her husband a message and they would have to decide if their scents were still twined or if they had irrevocably parted.

Her thoughts were interrupted by the three-toned chime, signaling an announcement from the Commodore.

""Clan, I have fine news to deliver this day. Our work in Antares has been difficult and long, but now we will relocate there as a permanent fixture to their defense militia. We will be re-decorated as the Antarean Self-defense Militia, but we retain our name and our purpose. Always remember, Vilantia is where our souls return.""

Misabel sank to her bunk as the end-of-announcement chime sounded. Her first escape plan had been thwarted before it had even formed. Now a second had to find a way to the fore; on the positive side she had two days in R-space to figure something out, and she was an engineer. She'd solve the problem.

*Homeplate, Terran Foreign Legion Ship* Twilight Rose

Coming to Homeplate felt like visiting a foreign land in some ways. They'd been on the ship almost a full month, with most of the time in R-space. They'd received their payment for the towing, and the Ginyu Force commander seemed rather contrite as the credit transfer was approved and a second set of ships latched on to return them to Draconis. Overall, the battalion account was flush with credits even after the necessary payouts to the general funds and the 7th.

Gryzzk had ordered the evening squad to stations for the final return docking. It was something of a spectacle as they returned to their ports under their own power - he'd offered to tow the *Twilight Hurdop* to their berth only to receive a profane education from Waniul with respect to what was and was not considered good luck in the Hurdop Navy. Other than that, it was a fine showing - in a small fit of unbridled joy, he'd ordered a short-range countermeasure burst once they were inside, giving everyone something akin to a fireworks show. Not to be outdone by their commander, the rest of the battalion quickly found their own displays to celebrate their return. Astrobatics and loud music were the order of the day it seemed, and Gryzzk couldn't help but smile at some of the open-channel discussion. Waniul was being quickly dubbed The Black Knight - and it seemed the name resonated with her in some way. Or she'd been introduced to Monty Python and found it hilarious.

Gryzzk glanced at Yomios for a moment as she prepared to lock down her station. ""Before you depart Corporal, I have a question. The Redfire Bloomvine behaves oddly at times. Some evenings there is a pleasant scent, other times not so pleasant. Is there something I should be aware of regarding its care?""

Yomios paused for a moment. ""Oh. It's - I suppose you could call it a mood plant. We cultivated it to create a foul odor when predators were near, and would use that time to hide in our dens in the ancient times."" There was a wry sort of smile. ""Be mindful of it - it is a lovely thing to have.""

""Thank you, corporal."" Gryzzk steeled himself for what was to come. ""Send a message to Skunkworks, advise them that we have a curious situation that may require a specialized indemnity. After that, secure your station and report tomorrow morning.""

As tradition demanded, Gryzzk donned his stetson and spurs with his formal uniform and then walked the ship to ensure that it was empty. Finding the ship clear of all personnel not named Chief Warrant Officer Patrick Tucker, Gryzzk moved carefully around the crowd to find Kiole indulging in what was apparently the privilege of the lower enlisteds - a rather public display of affection. In theory, the officers were restrained - but Gryzzk had to suppress a smirk as his nose caught the ardor of the officers. It was amusing to see Captain Gregg-Adams and Nurse Ogawa joined at the hip.

Gryzzk had taken great pains to ensure that the first one off was Chapma, though few outside security noted it. The handoff to Homeplate Security was done as quietly as possible from the rear docking hatch as the majority of the company left from the forward dock. Perhaps it was an excess of empathy for someone who theoretically had a pregnant wife, but the recordings and reports seemed to show someone at a crossroads - and maybe the Terrans would discover what exactly had caused such mental chills within Chapma. Once he knew all that, he could make a proper decision.

The musing in his head took a rather abrupt turn as he realized that he was in fact being mobbed by his family - Gro'zel had settled on his left foot and Nhoot on his right. Above them Millennium was loitering in a back and forth pattern, apparently looking for something. Gryzzk walked a few steps before embracing Grezzk tightly, and the two shared as private a moment as possible.

""You have proper food awaiting your belly, my handsome hand. Our wife says there is a cousin among your crew who needs a family.""

Gryzzk nodded. ""I think I would like to have a casual conversation with the captain.""

The girls scrambled again to get off Gryzzk's feet as they both seemed to realize that there was a time and place for everything, and sitting on Papa's feet while they were Lieutenants Junior Grade was somewhat improper. Gro'zel lifted an arm and gave a high-pitched command, at which point Millennium dove at a frightful speed downward and flared as if it were a shuttle piloted by Hoban before delicately landing on Gro'zel's gloved hand.

Fortunately as they moved toward officer country the crowd thinned, and as they entered their home proper it seemed like a weight was removed from Gryzzk's shoulders - here everything was in place. No insane multi-species fights, no agents trying to find out what concoction was responsible for success, no chaos. Just a simmering tureen of landis'og that smelled like delight given physical form.

For two seconds. Then the children were purple streaks as they ran to their room with a falcon trailing after them, the infants began fussing softly as scents they hadn't had in their noses for some time made their way in, and Kiole exhaled as she unbuttoned her uniform blouse as she entered the bedroom, revealing that she'd been hiding her belly for some time. She looked a little embarrassed.

""The ah, second half officially started the day after we left.""

Grezzk was blatantly surprised by her wife's admission. ""You. But. How?""

There was a nod from Gryzzk. ""I have the very same question.""

Kiole looked up, with her feet tracing a small pattern in the carpet, finally sitting on the bed. ""I - I'm sorry, but. The idea of staying home."" She started glancing nervously around the room, looking at everything except her spouses. ""In my birthclan, it is not our way. Officially, pregnant women are reassigned to rear duties. Unofficially, the majority were on duty until labor."" Kiole moved her hands to cover her belly. ""We were well-esteemed for our duty. Our clan stories were always filled with tales of women who would fight while in the latter stages. In the last war, one of my cousins gave her son his first meal during a pitched battle, and only cut the umbilical with her combat knife after the area had been cleared."" Kiole looked up to Gryzzk. ""I...how can I be your Lady Warrior if I can't fight?""

Grezzk sat next to her wife, gently stroking Kiole's brow. ""You are my starlight guide. How can you show me the way if you are not here?""

There was silence in the room for a moment before Gryzzk said anything. ""We cannot undo what has been done. However, we need to be the ones who lead both our worlds in a new thinking that our worlds must do."" He sat down on Kiole's other side, letting his own nervousness at what he'd just said seep out. ""If anyone asks, your second semester began today. No more duties on the ship until the galaxy is ready to greet our child. If I find out you stowed away on the trip to Pavonia, I *will* turn the ship around.""

Kiole lifted a brow. ""The math will not equate.""

Gryzzk shook his head. ""Fear not. If there is one thing our species excels at, it is ignoring an inconvenient truth. At least on Vilantia.""

They remained quiet for a moment, until they all began slowly laying down and enjoying the softness of the bed and the scent of each other. When Gryzzk opened his eyes again, he found an hour had passed and there was a twin napping in each of his arms. He scooched and stood, following his nose to the kitchen where food was waiting.

Food wasn't the only thing waiting, and Gryzzk passed Ghabri over to his mother while Waniul was putting her hand on Kiole's stomach and making soft noises of amazement.

""When...?""

""About half an hour ago. The children stirred, and we felt it best to let you rest with them."" Grezzk nuzzled his cheek gently. ""Do not worry - we'll be eating soon. We received word that Bob and Doug are doing something special and that we should definitely be watching.""

Dinner was something of a bustling affair, but it seemed awkward somehow - Waniul was eating very deliberately, a most un-Hurdop way to have a meal. Her scent was guarded, and even as she wiped the last bits of sauce from the plate there was conflict. Finally as they were clearing things to the recycler, Kiole nudged her cousin.

""Waniul, your fur is twisted. Explain.""

There was apprehension in Waniul's reply. ""Cousin. Lady of the freeclan. I want to find spouses and raise a family of my own. Would it be possible for us to go to Vilantia, and perhaps find someone there?""

Gryzzk spoke up from his place on the couch under a pile of daughters and sons. ""We are going to Vilantia in the future. There is business that we must attend there.""

Waniul frowned, giving Gryzzk a look that suggested that he had spoken slightly out of turn. ""I, that may be acceptable. But only if Freelady Kiole is there as well.""

Gryzzk cocked his head with uncertainty - it seemed like he was intruding on an invisible sphere. Kiole rested her stump on Waniul's shoulder. ""Despite his title, he is not a Hurdop Freelord. He is also correct in his assessment; if there is a family for you on Vilantia, that family will wait for you. Now hush and enjoy your first review."" Kiole flicked on the holo as Grezzk brought out a large bowl of dried fruits and nuts for them to snack on.

The traditional fanfare and opening sequence came on, finally resolving to Bob and Doug's smiling faces - they were wearing sunglasses and expensive-looking suits that were deep purple and sparkling, and in between the two was a much older gentleman who looked quite severe, but his suit was one of the most ridiculous things Gryzzk had ever seen, an eye-searing pink paisley with red and cartoonish yellow splotches.

""Good day, I'm Bob and over there's Doug, and tonight on After-Action Report, we've got a First Contact Fight - and in honor of that we managed to get Grapes to come back from his cottage on the lake because we've got a lot of action to go after. Grapes, the Terran Foreign Legion - you've seen 'em, thoughts?""

That was all the older gentleman needed, and he began to tap the desk in front of him vigorously with his fingertips - it was like the desk was an instrument of some kind. When he spoke his accent reminded him of Rosie in a way, with the same roundness to certain syllables. ""I tell ya, most of the other species who try to go merc are soft, they dunno how to play the game - they take two hits and they wanna go home cryin' to their mommies. Not these guys, they got the grit that you need for the game today. From Gryzzk on down, they can take a hit and they can dish a hit. S'whatcha need if you're gonna be here for more than a cup of coffee, and I don't care what those namby-pamby feather-dusters say about range and psychology, you wanna win you gotta hit 'em hard. Anyway, enough gabbing from me let's get to it but whatcher about to see is a masterclass from the Legion. Kids if you're watchin' at home save this to your storage cause this is how it's done.""

Grapes tapped the holo to bring up the commanders of each company. ""First, we got the lineup. Major Gryzzk, young but he's already paid his dues, and you gotta pay your dues if you ever want to amount to anything here. Cap'n Rostin, he's a Steady Eddie. Good kid I like him, reminds me of General Sinclair back when he was a pup. Cap'n Waniul, she's a firecracker and you're gonna see it. Don't let her do joint missions with Cap'n Jenkins, those two're a one-two punch bringing property damage and hurt feelin's to your door."" Grapes pointed emphatically at the holocam as he continued.

""Now Jenkins is an absolute spitfire and when they said 'Don't try to save money by conservin' ammunition' she heard 'em loud'n'clear. Next up we got Cap'n Bulfrek - still a rook in this league but he did a long stint with the Hurdop Navy that cost him about half a leg; he found out about Terran replacements and signed up, which means he's got the jam. And Tail End Charlie of this battalion's Cap'n Venlid. Not much book on her, but she's out of Vilantian Navy cause they can't stand the sight of competence or somethin', I dunno. One thing you gotta remember though - everyone I talked about other than Gryzzk and Rostin are on their teeth-cuttin' mission. That's gonna come into play. Anyhow, that's the Legion. Bob, how 'bout these other jokers?""

Bob picked up the verbal throw easily, taking over the holo. ""So this is where things get interesting. This is part of the First Contact Diplomatic mission - The Eridani wanted to see what the Collective's about and the Collective did some paper shuffling and sent these guys to give 'em some wargames. So here we got some Eridani ships, and the data-pack on them is a peach. So that's Thing One. Thing Two is that the Eridani got some clowns hiding in this asteroid belt here. Thing Three consists of pack of bounty hunters over here - someone put a bounty on the Legion through the Draconis cluster for a cool fifty mill. Now that sounds like a lot - and it is, but at the same time someone's trying to get it done on the cheap.""

Doug smoothly continued introducing the Eridani as the holo shifted to zoom in on the initial wargame scenario. ""Tactically speaking, the Eridani are all algorithms. During the exercise portion of this, we start with absolutely no movement. Like both sides are waiting for the other to move. Then the Eridani take the initiative, and their maneuvers are almost artificially perfect. Then on comms we got Gryzzk sending some of Rosie's finest chirps down the airwaves. That didn't do anything, and you can see how they're not taking that bait. Exercise goes nicely, then the seven-pack of Asteroid Eridani show up. Gryzzk calls exercise halt on account of it's getting pretty real - and this is where the magic happens. Grapes?""

The elderly man seemed to be almost vibrating with glee as he spat out words like his mouth was a weapon. ""So right here you see where Gryzzk's got talent. He's already got his forces split to deal with both threats, and he shifts the exercise ships to put 'em both in their best position - he sends Cap'n Rostin to link up with Jenkins and Bulfrek cause they're gonna need Steady Eddie to make sure nobody gets core-dumped and then brings Waniul into his fold because the exercise already showed they're gonna need precision shots."" He pointed at the holo to zoom in on the bounty hunters first as the battle played out.

""Now here, Jenkins got something new. She converted two of her shuttles to straight attack-profiles, and they make an absolute yard-sale of the zone. She understands the word overkill exists, but this is not a woman who's internalized the concept. Shots going wild, ordinance spraying like it's a celebration. While everyone focuses on that, Rostin slides along the board and sets himself up behind the other formation while Bulfrek gets his boarding shuttles moving fast. Fair play to the other guys, when someone's laying an alpha strike on your formation like they just did you oughta pay attention to 'em. Bulfrek's got chops, he does a simultaneous board of engineering and the bridge all at once. Clean sweep. Jenkins is having a helluva time playing designated distraction with those close-support shuttles making three-four ships holier than the Pope. Everyone's got eyes on her, and by the time they realize they lost situational awareness Rostin's sending the back of their formation a quick little memo askin' about their mom-n-them."" Grapes leaned back with a satisfied smirk ask the holos showed the absolute carnage before continuing.

""Now that's enough of that; over here with the Eridani we see the first flash of brilliance from Gryzzk. The Eridani are fighting to counter the moves that they saw in the exercise, except Gryzzk and them are playing the Eridani like a fiddle. They figure out how to take out the Eridani and his first move is to pass that information over to everyone, and then the second thing he does is switch pilots. Watch, you'll see how the *Twilight Rose* flies different from here on out - Hoban's got the silky mitts but he flies like space said something about his kid sister, and you can see where Miroka's finessing everything she can. Eridani comms get broken into, and then this is the next bit where you just gotta tip your hat. Instead of siccing Rosie on 'em, Gryzzk passes comms to his daughter Nhoot - and that cute little button just starts asking questions and tying up the commsfeed so they can't pass tac-data nearly as well."" The older gentleman had a large smile on his face and shook his head before continuing.

""All the ships are moving and laying down fire, and if you look you can see where either O'Brien or Laroy is changing shield geometry to give the Eridani some Return to Sender action."" Grapes opened a beer and had a healthy chug. ""Folks that right there is the Play of the Engagement; following that is the perfect encapsulation of how you can to everything right and still wind up scraping chiclets off the ice. Waniul here deflects, twists and does some beautiful work to position her ship - then a stray shot from the Eridani hits an asteroid that winds up putting their keisters down hard. But whatever else you wanna say when God made Waniul He just plain forgot to put in the quit. One weapon mount functioning, they twirl like a tornado and get their second killshot of the engagement and then they form up because they got one good finger left and they're gonna stick in someone's eye before the fight's over.""

Bob lifted his own beer. ""Now the good news for everyone there is that the Eridani decided that testing the manufacturer's warranty was no longer on their to-do list. White flag up and now it's time for someone to pony up for the breakage. Overall thoughts gentlemen?""

Grapes wasted no time. ""Hire these guys b'fore someone else does, and whatever you do pay the bill - every client is one missed payment from becoming a target. If you're looking for a discount, you better marry into one of their families; the only commander in the bunch that's taken is Major Gryzzk."" He then snorted. ""The Eridani look like a buncha dancers who who could skate into the corner for a scrum with a pocket full of eggs and come out clean.""

Bob nodded his agreement. ""Yep. Eridani look like they don't fight so much as calculate. Not good in a fight.""

Doug spread his hands. ""Well, that's all the time we've got today. Coming up tomorrow, Freelord Drysel shows us why the Foreign Terran Legion is no joke with their new ships.""

Gryzzk looked over as the show ended to see Waniul seeming relieved at her review. She smiled and answered the unasked.

""I didn't fail - it was, it was bad luck, and even the Terrans knew it.""

Kiole nodded. ""Quite. For now cousin, I think you should take the rest of the night and contemplate the group celebration tomorrow. I am going to celebrate with my wife and husband."" Kiole leaned, giving Waniul a familial nuzzle. ""All of our peoples are interested in revitalizing our worlds. We will find ones who are fit to share your bed.""",16,1770739230.0,HFY,3,1.0,False

1r14lrz,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsetConqueror/comments/1r14lrz/how_to_build_a_morning_routine_that_actually/,# How to Build a Morning Routine That Actually Works: Science-Based Strategies,"Most people think morning routines are about waking up at 5am and doing 47 things before breakfast. That's not it. I spent way too long researching this, devouring books, podcasts, and studies on habit formation and neuroscience, and honestly the mainstream advice is exhausting garbage that nobody can sustain.

The real issue isn't laziness or lack of discipline. Our brains are literally wired to conserve energy and resist change. Add modern life's chaos, cortisol spikes from checking phones immediately after waking, and the sheer decision fatigue from having zero structure, and you get why most people stumble through mornings feeling reactive instead of in control. But here's the thing, you can rewire this. The right morning routine doesn't just wake you up, it fundamentally shifts how your entire day unfolds.

**Anchor your routine to ONE non negotiable keystone habit.** This is straight from Charles Duhigg's research in The Power of Habit. He's a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist who spent years studying habit psychology, and this book completely changed how I think about behavior change. The concept is simple but powerful, certain habits create a domino effect that naturally triggers other positive behaviors. For most people, that keystone is movement. Even just 10 minutes. Your brain doesn't distinguish between a 2 hour gym session and a quick walk around the block when it comes to the neurochemical benefits. Both release dopamine and norepinephrine which literally make you more alert and motivated. So forget the intense workout pressure. Just move your body somehow every single morning, and watch how it naturally makes you want to eat better, focus more, and make smarter decisions throughout the day.

**Eliminate decision making in the first hour.** This comes from research on willpower depletion. Every decision you make, even tiny ones like what to wear or whether to check your phone, drains your mental battery. Barack Obama famously wore the same suit every day for this exact reason. Automate your morning completely. Lay out clothes the night before. Have the same breakfast options. Follow the exact same sequence of activities. This isn't boring, it's strategic. You're preserving mental energy for things that actually matter later in the day.

**Protect the first 30 minutes from all input.** No phone, no news, no emails, nothing. This is based on neuroscience research showing that the brain operates in a theta wave state right after waking, which is incredibly receptive to whatever information you feed it. [Andrew Huberman](https://www.hubermanlab.com/podcast) covers this extensively on his podcast, he's a Stanford neuroscientist and the stuff he shares about circadian rhythms and cortisol timing is insane. Basically if you check your phone immediately, you're letting other people's priorities and anxieties hijack your nervous system before you've even established your own baseline. Instead, use those 30 minutes for something that centers you. Could be journaling, could be sitting in silence with coffee, could be stretching. Whatever keeps you internal rather than reactive.

If you want a more structured way to dive deeper into habit formation without reading dozens of books, [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) is worth checking out. It's an AI-powered personalized learning app that pulls from high-quality sources like the books mentioned here, research papers, and expert interviews to create custom audio content tailored to your specific goals. You can literally type something like ""I'm a night owl who wants to build a sustainable morning routine without feeling miserable,"" and it'll generate a personalized learning plan with podcasts ranging from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives packed with examples and context.

Built by a team from Columbia and Google, it's fact-checked and designed to make self-improvement actually stick. You can customize the voice too, there are options like a smoky, conversational tone or something more energetic if you need that morning boost. Perfect for absorbing this kind of content during your commute or while making breakfast instead of doomscrolling.

[The 5 Second Rule](https://a.co/d/014sGIbV) **by Mel Robbins** is genuinely one of the most practical books I've encountered for this. Robbins is a motivational speaker and CNN commentator, and this book sells millions because it works. The premise is stupidly simple, when your alarm goes off, count backwards 5-4-3-2-1 and physically move. Don't negotiate, don't think, just interrupt the pattern of hitting snooze. That 5 second window is critical because it's before your prefrontal cortex can generate excuses. This technique applies to literally any moment of resistance throughout your morning routine. Feeling the pull to check instagram? 5-4-3-2-1 and put the phone down. It's a mental interrupt that gives you just enough activation energy to follow through.

**Build in a 2 minute gratitude practice.** Sounds cheesy but the research is airtight. Robert Emmons at UC Davis has shown that people who practice gratitude have measurably lower cortisol levels and higher resilience to stress. It doesn't need to be elaborate. Literally just think of 3 specific things you're grateful for while brushing your teeth or making coffee. The key is specificity, not ""I'm grateful for my family"" but ""I'm grateful my partner made me laugh yesterday when I was stressed."" This small shift trains your brain to scan for positive inputs instead of defaulting to threat detection mode, which is what most of us do naturally.

**Accept that you'll mess up and build in flexibility.** The difference between people who sustain routines and those who don't isn't perfection, it's recovery speed. Missed your routine today? Cool, do a 5 minute version tomorrow instead of skipping entirely. James Clear talks about this in Atomic Habits, he's a habit formation expert and that book is legitimately the best thing written on behavior change. Bestseller for a reason. His rule is never miss twice. One slip is an anomaly, two slips is the start of a new bad habit. So if you sleep through your alarm one day, don't let that become the excuse to abandon the whole system. Just get back on track immediately. The routine serves you, not the other way around.

The biggest shift happens when you stop viewing morning routines as this rigid boot camp thing and start seeing them as a way to reclaim agency over your day. You're not trying to become some productivity robot. You're creating conditions where your brain naturally operates better, where you feel more grounded instead of constantly catching up. It's less about cramming in activities and more about designing a launch sequence that sets the right tone. Once that's locked in, everything else gets easier. Your stress response changes. Your decision making sharpens. You stop feeling like life is just happening to you.",1,1770739113.0,MindsetConqueror,0,1.0,False

So you've probably seen the bloodbath in the markets recently. Software companies are getting crushed. And part of the reason is pretty straightforward now. It's virtually effortless to reverse engineer any software that exists.

The days of having unbreakable moats are over. I can reverse engineer your whole business with a twenty dollar AI tool in fifteen minutes. Maybe a gram of weed and some coffee. The point is it's trivial now.

I know this because I just did it. I run a lead brokering business and I needed tracking software. The standard tool is Everflow. Lead aggregators cost five hundred to a thousand a month depending on what you need. 

So I opened Claude Code one afternoon, told it to build me the same thing, and two hours later I had a working platform. Dashboard showing all my offers, buyer rates, affiliate payouts, margins. Real time conversion tracking. Buyer login portal. CRM integration.

My friend watched the whole thing happen on a screen share. Code was just running in the background while we talked about other shit. Every few minutes I'd check in, approve something, give it a correction. That was it.

Twenty dollars. 

That's my monthly Claude subscription. 

That's the entire cost.

I'm not a developer. I described what I wanted in plain English, pretty casual, and it handled the architecture and wrote the code. A few years ago one wrong keystroke would break everything. Now you describe what you want the way you'd text a friend and get working software back.

Here's why this matters for the broader market. Everflow is a solid product. But their moat just got obliterated. Any mid-tier software charging five hundred or more a month for something a solo operator can rebuild in an afternoon is in real trouble now. CRMs, dashboards, internal tools, reporting platforms. If the core functionality isn't deeply complex, it's buildable for almost nothing.

Not every SaaS company dies. The ones with deep integrations, massive datasets, or real network effects will survive. But the ones whose only defense was ""it would take too long to build your own,"" that defense is gone. The stock market knows this. That's part of why you're seeing so much red.

The companies that understood this early, that pivoted away from trying to be a software moat and moved toward being a data moat or a distribution moat or a network effect moat, those are the ones that will actually survive the next five years.

One thing if you want to try this yourself. Don't ask it to build everything at once. Start with one clear goal, let it finish that, then add features one at a time. It handles complexity much better in pieces.

Today, after balancing the sprint of Shorts and the marathon of Long-form, I'm looking back at a version of myself that was afraid to start-and I have some news for anyone still sitting on the fence.

1. The Algorithm is a Mirror, Not a Monster

​We often treat the algorithm like a gatekeeper that’s out to get us. In reality, it’s just looking for people to love your work. I’ve learned that a ""low view"" video isn't a rejection; it’s a data point. It’s the platform saying, ""Let's try a different angle next time."" Every upload makes you a better storyteller.

​2. Shorts are the Spark, Long-form is the Fire

​Mixing the two has been a masterclass in attention.

​Shorts taught me how to get to the point. They are the ""handshakes"" quick, energetic, and great for meeting new people.

​Long-form is the ""coffee date."" It’s where I found my community.

If you’re worried about doing both: don't be. They work together to build a house that has both a front door and a cozy living room.

​

3. Your ""Bad"" Videos are Necessary

​I looked at my first video yesterday and winced. And that’s a good thing. If you aren't embarrassed by your first few uploads, you started too late. Those ""clunky"" videos are the tuition you pay to become a pro. You have to give yourself permission to be a beginner.

i'm not a big channel myself, but take a look at your channel and try to notice the growth in your content, your thumbnails, your tries and it will be clear that every video uplpad is a better version from the one before it and a better version of you learning and moving forward.

1r14fe2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1r14fe2/divorce_drama_husband_35m_was_arrested_a_few_days/,"Divorce drama. Husband (35M) was arrested a few days ago. I (36F) found a woman's thong in the bedroom. He wants to ""talk"" after he bailed himself out of jail. Advice needed","TL:DR: My husband was arrested with drug charges last week. We are living apart at the moment. He has not filed for divorce. I found one of our cats in bad shape with matted hair all over his body. He called me while in jail multiple times. I found a woman's thong as well as ear rings and a make-up soiled towel in the guest bath when I went to check on cats. He has made bail and wants to ""talk."" Advice on how to handle this talk, please. 

My soon to be ex-husband, ""Dexter"" (35M), called me from county jail this past Saturday (2/07). I (36F) did not answer the call, believing it to be spam. I figured if its important, they will leave a voicemail. We have been separated since November 2025. I moved out of our shared apartment in November 2025. 

We have a dog and 2 cats, no children. I have custody of the dog. He kept the cats.

After doing some research, I figured out he had been arrested on Thursday evening (2/05) and that the jail he was located at had visitation on Sunday (2/08) from 6 pm to 9pm. Given his arrest date and having no knowledge of who or if anyone was taking care of the cats, I freaked out and drove to the apartment. When we separated, Dexter insisted that I leave my apartment key, even though I am still on the lease. I originally refused but eventually did hand over the key. I attempted several times to communicate with maintenance about being locked out, but no one returned my call. I noticed his car was parked in the lot. We lived on the first floor and have a patio with a storage room in the back of the apartment. I was able to confirm through the blinds that the cats had food, suspicious, given his arrest date.

After wracking my brain while waiting for maintenance to call me back, I decided to check the storage space. The door was open. It's always locked, so it's a bit odd. His keys were in there. I was able to get in and found the cats were almost out of water. I went to check on the litter boxes. The first was empty. The second is located in  the hallway in front of the master bedroom. It was dirty, so I cleaned up. When I finished, I noticed the master bedroom door was open, again strange. A cat had previously peed on the mattress when it was left open, so I know the door is usually closed at all times. With the light entering the bedroom, I saw a black lace thong. I went to the guest bathroom to wash my hands after cleaning the litter box and noticed the towel had make-up stains. As if someone removed all  their foundation, mascara and lip stick.. Additionally, I found a pair of hoop ear rings on the coffee table in the living room when I was playing with the cats. All leads me to believe he has moved on to someone else. I became upset. Logically, I know we are past the point of reconciliation, but it still hurts that after 13 years together, he has moved on so quickly.

My financial situation is not the best at the moment, which is why I have not filed for divorce. I thought that since he ended the relationship, he was going to file, but he hasn't. I am upset with the fact that he called me to help him out. We do not speak to each other unless absolutely necessary, mostly coordinating payments on joint accounts. Apart from the call on Saturday morning, Dexter also called me during the Super Bowl. I did not hear my phone, so I was unable to answer. I attempted to visit him in jail on Sunday (2/08) against my better judgment before checking on the cats. I was not able to see him. The officer said all inmates have the ability to write 4 names of people who they would like to see and my husband did not have any names listed for visitation. 

Fast-foward to Monday evening. I had been at the apartment for about 20 min when I hear the storage door being slammed shut. By the time I make it to the windows to check, I see a shadow walking away. I rush to the front door and Dexter is there, knocking. I allow him in. He looks agitated and has a weird energy about him. He drops his bag on the couch and asks where his phone charger is. I reply that I don't know. He then makes eye contact with me, stares for a few seconds and says ""I have to tell her to leave."" I ask ""who is her?"" he replies ""my ride."" He goes outside. I could not see who was in the driver's seat. Dexter went to the passenger window, said everything is alright, and the person drove off. 

Back inside, I ask him to explain what happened. I had received calls from his boss and a close friend, stating they received calls from the jail this weekend. He said he was on his way to his friend's house and was pulled over for crossing a solid white line on a neighborhood road. The officer smelled weed and asked him to step out and he was being arrested. A K-9 was used to search the car and a white powered substance was found. The officer was nice enough to allow him to call someone to take his vehicle and prevent impounding it. I had other questions for him regarding a notice of rent being late and one of the cats being neglected. He refused to speak about anything else. He did not want to discuss things until he had decompressed, showered, and slept. He asked that we speak tomorrow (today). 

So my questions y'all. How do I approach this conversation? I am under the impression that he will not file for divorce, I will have to. One of the cats is in BAD shape.

Trade Coffee is an online marketplace that connects you with independent specialty coffee roasters across the U.S. Instead of committing to one brand, you get access to dozens of roasters in one place. Trade matches you to coffees based on your preferences (roast level, brew method, flavor notes), then ships freshly roasted coffee directly to your door.

# How Trade Coffee works

You can use Trade in two main ways:

Coffee subscription

Trade’s subscription is flexible and easy to manage. After taking a short taste quiz, you’ll receive personalized recommendations. You can change coffees, pause shipments, or adjust delivery frequency at any time. It’s a popular option for people searching for a coffee subscription service, fresh roasted coffee delivery, or a way to discover new roasters without guesswork.

One-off coffee orders

Not ready for a subscription? You can also buy single bags without committing. This is great if you want to try a specific origin, roast style, or roaster. Every order is roasted to order, which makes a noticeable difference in freshness.

# Why people choose Trade Coffee

* Access to top specialty coffee roasters in one place
* Beans roasted fresh, not sitting on shelves
* Clear tasting notes, origin info, and brew guidance
* Works for espresso, pour-over, drip, French press, and cold brew

If you’ve been searching for **the best coffee subscription** or an easy way to upgrade your daily coffee routine, the [40% off first order](https://go.shopmy.us/p-42397346) makes Trade Coffee a low-risk way to try it and see if it fits your taste.",1,1770738552.0,u_Mr_Rellim,0,1.0,False

No one would ever guess this side of me exists.

I’m divorced, 2 kids, now late 30s. The marriage was fine until it wasn’t, but after it ended I realized how much I’d suppressed parts of myself for years. Sex was vanilla and rare toward the end. Post-divorce, I dated cappropriately for a while guys my age or older, nice dinners, polite sex. It was… fine. But it didn’t scratch the itch.

A couple years ago I started getting this fantasy just vanish for a weekend. Drive 2–4 hours away to a random city or nice town I don’t know anyone in. Book a decent hotel (not fancy, but clean and private). Turn off location sharing, tell people I’m visiting a friend or need some alone time. No one questions it because I’m independent. Then, on apps (Tinder, Bumble, Feeld, whatever), set age range low—18–22 or so and see who bites.

The first time was almost accidental. I was stressed at work, impulsive, booked a room in a beach town 3 hours away for a Saturday–Sunday. Told everyone I was doing a solo wellness weekend. Matched with a 18 - year-old. Cute, flirty, zero expectations. We met for coffee at a Starbucks. He was nervous but eager. We ended up back in my room. It was fun, athletic, no-strings sex—exactly what I wanted. He left after a couple hours, I slept like a baby. Next day I wandered the town, felt completely anonymous and free. No judgment, no history, no one knowing my last name. Came home recharged.

Second time was more deliberate, about 8 months later. Same setup: different city, nice chain hotel with a good view. Matched with two guys separately over the weekend one gym bro Saturday night, one sweet-but-shy Sunday afternoon. Both came to the room. Both were respectful, enthusiastic, and gone before breakfast. I felt like a different person the whole time. Zero guilt. Just pure, selfish pleasure and the thrill of being someone no one back home would recognize.

Now it’s creeping back. I catch myself scrolling hotels in cities 3+ hours away, imagining the anonymity. The way younger guys look at me like I’m some forbidden fantasy. No small talk about mortgages or exes—just raw attraction and fun. I love the risk a little too much: what if someone sees me? What if a friend’s kid goes to college there? But that’s part of the high. I don’t do it often—maybe once or twice a year max—but when the urge hits, it’s loud.

I don’t think I’m hurting anyone. I’m single, they’re consenting adults But I know society would call me all sorts of names if they knew: cougar, desperate, reckless, whatever. I don’t care when I’m in the moment, but afterward I wonder if I’m a little messed up for craving this escape so badly.

Anyone else get these random urges to just… disappear and be whoever you want for 48 hours? Or am I the only one living a double life in my head?",18,1770738382.0,confessions,8,0.75,False

Quick context: I'm in tech sales, which means I'm on a plane a lot – like 50+ flights a year, mostly transatlantic (Europe/US back and forth). The jet lag is brutal, especially coming home. There's something extra annoying about being back in your own timezone but still feeling completely wrecked for days.

I've tried the usual stuff everyone recommends:

\- Melatonin: Works sometimes, but I always forget to pack it. Also not a huge fan of taking pills if I can avoid it.

\- Timeshifter: Actually a solid app, but I'd get the notification to check my plan, tell myself ""I'll look at that in a sec,"" and then completely forget. Every. Single. Time.

\- Strategic flight timing: This actually helps when I can control it, but most of my trips are client meetings so I don't really get to choose.

So I end up winging it at every destination and losing like 2-3 days feeling like absolute garbage.

I got fed up with this and thought... why not just build something that works for how my brain actually operates? Instead of giving me a plan I need to remember to check, just send me a push notification at the exact moment I need to do something. Like ""hey stop drinking coffee right now"" or ""go to bed 30 minutes early tonight"" – starting a few days before I fly. Remove the whole ""checking an app"" step completely.

Built a landing page to show the concept – it's called Passenger. Happy to share the link if that's cool here (not sure on the rules).

Honestly not sure if this is a real problem other people have or if I just have terrible organisational skills. Would love to hear if anyone else relates to this or if you think I'm missing something obvious.

Percy basically yells in surprise and when Molly asks what happened, I remember he lies and says Hermione accidentally stepped on his foot.

They’re both embarrassed over it but the next day, it turns out Hermione is starting a new entry level job under Percy. He tries to act all normal but his feelings for her grow.

He tries to disassociate and tries to be all business as usual, asking her to bring him coffee and do regular office things but eventually Hermione calls him out and they both confess their feelings but then they can’t date out in the open because of the employment contract and the fact that he’s her superior at work.

I (F30) am feeling confused. I reached to my psych at the beginning of the year with depression, which I feel is pretty much gone (venlafaxine/effexor 225mg). when depression cloud was gone, I told him I do feel better but the problems that I think led to the depression are still there. among which

\-being jobless for a few years now, after finishing med school and a few years of residency before just dropping out

\-I do have a good idea for a project I worked relentlessly to start since then (having to do with medical education) but I always feel overwhelmed, have more ideas than I can handle, it is impossible to finish things, I seemingly work non stop but at the end of the day have nothing to show

\-I’m not even going to discuss always being late and having problems with time, always skipped classes if I didn’t like them, always been v messy and disorganized even if I really try to change that

The problem is that I didn t check too many marks in the childhood section. I did check SOME, but comparatively there were more in the adult section.

I know for sure after age 11-12 many symptoms were there, but not so many before (there were time problems, mess problems, but I was able to concentrate, do homework, I actually started school at 6 and was the best in my primary school class).

I also checked almost nothing on the hyperactive side; which I know isn t needed (right?) but he mentioned it.

I’m confused because before the appointment my biggest fear was him telling me it s not ADHD; so then what, is it “just me”? and am I again stuck and hopeless, when I finally could find an answer to so many things? 

He did prescribe me concerta. We did like a test run before this interview and 18mg did nothing for me; 36 makes my energy stable troughout the day - I was always feeling mentally exhausted by 1-2 in the afternoon (even with a second coffee), overwhelmed but my inefficient way of working etc; but with 36mg that’s gone and is nice; besides that, I still struggle with work, but he said this takes some time to change along therapy.

I wonder how someone without ADHD feel taking 36mg concerta, maybe kinda similar since my response (or lack of it, after all I didn’t feel too different except that energy dip being gone) didn’t sway the diagnosis one way or the other?

So while he did give me meds, I felt he isn’t SURE I do have ADHD. He also pointed out that many of the symptoms I checked can be bc of depression/anxiety. Next month I’ll start taking 300mg effexor.

Maybe he thinks it s more depression/anxiety developed as an adult but idk. I developed anxiety because I always missed exams, studied in the last second etc. and then depression cause apparently I can t finish or properly start even what I REALLY want to; it’s not about an imposed job anymore, or external structures that annoy me, just something that I like doing and I think I’m good at.

I honestly got out and sent him a message cause I was overthinking everything, he assured me by saying that I do check lots of boxes for ADHD but just not all. so again it seemed like he isn’t certain, and so I am not certain either, and I just want to know for sure what my problems are and find ways to FINALLY solve or alleviate them successfully. (I do think he is a good psych)

I’m also overthinking because I told a friend guy with ADHD that I might have it too and he was v confused (he doesn’t know me extremely well but still he really was taken aback and didn’t believe it).

How many ""ultimate morning routines"" or ""hack your brain for peak performance"" articles have you clicked on, only to find yourself back at square one a week later? Yeah, me too. For years, my personal growth journey felt like a relentless cycle of hyped-up new methods, brief bursts of enthusiasm, and then the inevitable crash back into old habits. I'd download the shiny new habit tracker, buy the acclaimed planner, watch the motivational videos... and still, that one big creative project I've been dreaming about would sit there, untouched.

My biggest frustration wasn't a lack of desire, it was the *stickiness*. Nothing ever stuck. I tried ""eat that frog"" for tasks, the Pomodoro Technique religiously, journaling every morning, meditation apps... some worked for a few days, maybe a week, but then life would happen, and I'd be back to procrastinating on the important stuff, especially my writing.

It got to the point where I almost gave up on dedicated personal development work entirely. All the advice felt like it was designed for someone else—someone with endless willpower and no bad days. But something clicked when I stopped looking for the ""game-changer"" and started thinking about small, almost *boring*, consistent experiments.

Here's what I actually tested and what finally started to move the needle on my long-stalled creative writing project:

*   **The ""Micro-Commitment"" Method (No Zero Days, Seriously Small):** This was the biggest shift. Instead of aiming for an hour of writing, I committed to *15 minutes*. Just 15 minutes. It sounded almost insultingly small, but the goal was simply to *not break the chain*.
    *   **Time Invested:** Started with 15 minutes, 5 days a week. After 3 weeks, I slowly nudged it to 20 minutes, then 30 minutes. I rarely go over 45 minutes on a normal day to avoid burnout.
    *   **Tool Used:** A simple wall calendar where I put a big 'X' for every day I hit my 15-minute minimum. No fancy apps, just visible progress.
    *   **Measurable Improvement:** Maintained a 60-day streak of at least 15 minutes of writing. This led to completing the first draft of a short story that had been brewing for over a year, and significant progress on another. Before this, I'd gone months without a single dedicated writing session.

*   **""Obstacle Pre-Mortem"" (Anticipate Failure Points):** Before starting each week, I'd spend 5 minutes thinking about what was *most likely* to derail my writing habit. Is it a busy workday? Feeling uninspired? A social event?
    *   **My Solution:** For busy days, I'd schedule my 15 minutes first thing in the morning (even before coffee). For lack of inspiration, I'd have a list of simple writing prompts or editing tasks ready. For social events, I'd sometimes shift my 15 minutes to late evening or make it a ""weekend only"" day. The key was having a plan *before* the obstacle hit.
    *   **Impact:** Reduced my ""missed days"" significantly. Instead of just giving up when I hit a snag, I had a ready-made adjustment.

*   **""No Reward Until Done"" (Small Dopamine Hack):** This one felt a bit restrictive at first, but it worked. I wouldn't allow myself to browse social media or watch YouTube *until* my writing session was complete for the day.
    *   **Implementation:** Placed my phone in another room or used a browser blocker for specific sites during my scheduled writing time.
    *   **Result:** It created a small but effective incentive. The thought of checking Twitter was often enough to get me to sit down for those 15 minutes, knowing the reward was just around the corner.

It wasn't a straight line, believe me. There were days I almost quit. About a month into the 15-minute streak, I had a terrible day at work, came home exhausted, and just wanted to crash. My brain screamed, ""You deserve a break! Skip today!"" But I remembered the tiny commitment. I dragged myself to my desk, stared at the screen for 10 minutes, wrote 5 sentences, and technically hit my 15. It felt like a monumental failure in the moment, but the 'X' still went on the calendar. That day, more than any other, solidified the habit because I proved to myself I could push through even when I felt completely drained. The goal wasn't perfection; it was consistency, no matter how messy.

This isn't some revolutionary ""secret."" It's just a few simple, tested strategies focused on *actual, sustainable behavior change* rather than chasing an idealized version of productivity. It's about building small, resilient habits that can withstand the inevitable chaos of real life.

1r141u7,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkRomance/comments/1r141u7/the_kinsey_institute_classified_all_human_sexual/,The Kinsey Institute classified all human sexual fantasy into 7 categories. Dark romance writes all 7. I checked.,"I was supposed to be doing laundry. Instead I spent my entire Sunday reading a book about what 4,175 Americans fantasize about when they should also be doing laundry. Solidarity, I guess.

Justin Lehmiller. Psychologist. Kinsey Institute. Former Harvard faculty. Two years. 350 questions. Ages 18 to 87. The largest sexual fantasy study ever conducted in the US. Published the whole thing in a book called *Tell Me What You Want.*

He identified seven categories that nearly all human sexual fantasy falls into. I read them and immediately had to put the book down. Not because it was spicy. Because I was staring at a peer-reviewed classification system for my bookshelf and I needed a minute.

*Power and control.* 93% of women in the study had fantasized about being dominated. Ninety-three. And before someone flags that number, ""fantasized about"" doesn't mean ""want in real life."" The study is clear on that distinction. But 93% means this isn't a niche interest. It's the norm pretending to be a niche interest. If you've read *Captive in the Dark* you already knew that. If you've read Laura Antoniou's *The Marketplace,* you knew it before most of this sub existed. (If you haven't read The Marketplace, fix that. It's the book dark romance borrowed its entire power dynamic from).

*Multi-partner.* 89% had fantasized about threesomes. I am looking respectfully at every single person in this sub who has ever recommended a reverse harem book and then immediately clarified ""but it's really about the emotional bonds."" I believe you. I also believe 89%. Both things can be true and I think that's beautiful.

*Novelty.* The craving for something you haven't felt before. This is the ""I've read 300 books this year and I need something that will actually surprise me, please I am BEGGING"" energy that drives half the rec threads here. Lehmiller found it was the third most common category. We could've told him that from the search bar alone.

*Taboo.* The attractions where the wrongness is the point. I'm not naming specific books here because I'm not trying to get anyone's hackles up, but you know your shelf. You know which books you'd never leave face-up on a coffee table. Those. The interesting part: taboo fantasies were MORE common in older respondents. College students had the least adventurous fantasy lives in the entire study. The more you've lived, the wider your imagination opens up. So the next time someone implies this genre is for people who don't know any better, you can tell them the Kinsey Institute disagrees.

*Passion and romance.* This one stopped me. Even inside the most extreme fantasies in the study, the majority of people described wanting to feel desired. Chosen. Wanted so badly it borders on irrational. That is the engine of every single dark romance MMC. He's dangerous. He's done terrible things. But he chose *her.* He broke his own rules for *her.* A Kinsey Institute researcher just peer-reviewed the entire dark romance genre structure and probably doesn't even know it.

*Non-monogamy.* Fantasies about consensual arrangements were far more common than fantasies about cheating. People don't actually want the secrecy. They want the version where wanting more isn't something you have to hide. Why-choose readers built an entire subgenre around this years before a psychologist put a number on it.

*Gender and sexual flexibility.* 59% of exclusively straight women had fantasized about other women. Over half. If you've ever quietly picked up an FF dark romance or lingered on certain scenes in a why-choose and wondered what that meant, it meant you're in the statistical majority of straight women in the country. That's what it meant.

Here's the part I keep coming back to though. Lehmiller found that people who told their partner what they actually fantasize about had the most satisfying sex lives, the happiest relationships, and the fewest issues with desire and arousal. Not the people with the safest fantasies. The people who said the thing out loud.

Every time someone posts in this sub asking for something specific and unhinged and deeply personal, that's the thing. You're naming it. And according to the largest study of its kind, naming it is the whole game.

Seven categories. Dark romance covers all seven. Not most. All.

So what's yours? If you had to pick the one category your reading list leans hardest into, which is it? I'll go first. Power and control. Not even going to be subtle about it.",49,1770737902.0,DarkRomance,5,0.94,False

Last month my father purchased the Delonghi La Specialista, which I know many don’t recommend, but it wasn’t my choice. 

The coffee would be good, but it was a hit or miss, ones would be good, others were bad.

Since then I bought some accessories, a proper tamper, wdt, an ims portafiller, and a coffee scale. 

It took my a couple of weeks to figure out the correct amount of g, (20g looks like the sweet spot) and the grind setting (2/8) that would make the espresso reach the optimal pressure zone and the correct time to extract.

OpenAI has begun testing advertisements in ChatGPT for free users. The growth is back. Sam Altman reportedly claims OpenAI is exceeding 10% monthly growth again, while internally promising a new model launch this week. The coding self-improvement loop is also tightening. Cursor launched Composer 1.5, a sub-1T model built with 20x more RL scaling. Elon Musk predicts this trajectory ends with models that skip source code entirely to generate binaries and pixels directly. 

The physical world is being leveraged to pay for the digital one. Alphabet is lining up banks to sell a rare 100-year bond to fund data center construction, effectively mortgaging the next century to build the intelligence of this one. The White House is pushing a new compact to ensure this expansion doesn't bankrupt households or drain water supplies, while simultaneously demanding 40% of Taiwan’s chip production relocate to the US. Meanwhile, China continues to find new efficiencies in its constraints. Tencent released a 2-bit LLM that maintains accuracy despite extreme compression.

Robotics is evolving from automation to biomimicry. Lockheed Martin unveiled the LampreyMMAUV, a submersible that hitches rides on host vessels to recharge, mimicking nature to extend operational range. Pony AI has started commercial production of driverless cars with Toyota. Google is using Android Auto data to predict crash risk from ""hard-braking events,"" while the US government moves to ban Chinese software in connected vehicles to prevent surveillance. Meanwhile, the environmental impact of the shift to EVs is becoming visible. Air quality in California is improving, correlated with zero-emission vehicle registrations.

Space is becoming a tourist destination. Elon Musk announced SpaceX will build a system for anyone to travel to the Moon and Mars. Analysts note SpaceX's recent pivot to the Moon offers immediate commercial revenue due to the shorter trip time, though Musk clarified launches will still go directly from Earth to Mars due to fuel scarcity on the lunar surface.

Medicine is expanding its search space to include the entire biosphere. Ditto Bio launched to mine parasite biology for autoimmune therapies, while Ozempic was found to restore knee cartilage independent of weight loss. Even coffee is being vindicated. A Harvard study has just linked moderate caffeine intake to lower dementia risk.

The economy is rapidly reorganizing itself for the age of superintelligence. AI startups in the US are adopting the ""996"" work culture just as China cracks down on it. A study found that AI tools intensify work rather than reduce it, pushing employees to work faster and longer. Capital is following. AI accounted for 35% of European VC deals in 2025. Human experts are increasingly being outperformed by betting markets. Kalshi has perfectly predicted every Fed rate decision since 2022.

Ontological shock is sinking to new depths. Congressman Tim Burchett claims classified briefings confirm non-human intelligences maintain multiple underwater bases on Earth, evoking the buried monoliths of 2001: A Space Odyssey.

-  im a photographer ! i like seeing things and keeping little snips of time frozen in my phone.. everything is precious in a way.

- Im quite emotional, i cried over a piece of macaroni once, felt bad for crushing it. But its in the past(a)

- i love cats, unconditionally, if the whole love thing doesnt work out ill probably end up collecting cats. 

- i love vc's, im quite clingy and need a good bit of attention, but i respect your time for sure! 

Dealbreakers?
- im in for long term relationships bound by rings and silly silly vows
- im not a fan of alcohol at all, but dont prohibit it

1r13t8z,https://v.redd.it/ouq3zkevqoig1,Built a first working version of an offline AI budgeting app — would love feedback on the AI approach,"Hey folks 👋

I’ve built a basic working version of a mobile budgeting app and wanted to share a short demo video to get feedback early.

The core idea:

	•	Runs fully offline on the device

	•	No bank sync, no cloud, no signup

	•	Natural expense input (e.g. “Coffee $15”)

	•	Simple, clutter-free dashboard

	•	End-of-day review to confirm or add transactions

	•	Query transaction based on time period, category and top most spending.

Right now, the logic is intentionally simple and local-first.

I’m stuck on one design decision and would love opinions from people who’ve built or used similar apps:

**Question:**

For an offline-first app, is it worth embedding a small generative model on-device (even if app size increases),

or is it better to avoid that complexity and stick with:

	•	intent classification

	•	rule-based flows

	•	well-designed UX covering most cases?

Basically:

👉 better “smart enough + lightweight”

or

👉 “more flexible AI, but heavier app”?

Not selling anything — genuinely trying to make the right tradeoff early.

yo for anyone heading to see honestav at globe iron on 02/12 you should definitely plan your parking situation now because that part of ohio city gets pretty packed. hingetown is a cool spot but the streets are narrow and spots vanish fast once the show crowd starts showing up for the 8:00 pm start.  
  
first thing you should check out is Prked since you can basically rent a driveway or a private garage spot right next to globe iron. it is way cheaper than the random paid lots and you skip the whole circling the block ritual. plus you do not have to deal with the post-show traffic jam when everyone is trying to squeeze out of the same street at once since your car is in a private spot.  
  
if you want to try your luck with street parking you can look along w 29th st or w 28th st but honestly those fill up by dinner time because of all the nearby bars like larder and rising star. detroit ave has metered spots that usually open up after 6:00 pm but you really have to read the signs because some areas are restricted or have specific rules for the evening. there is a public surface lot near church ave and w 29th but it is tiny and usually full of people going to the coffee shops or the gym nearby.  
  
be super careful about the private lots for businesses like jukebox or transformer station because they are known for being strict about towing if you are just there for the venue. if you end up further away you might find more luck heading south toward the west side market area or the bigger lots on w 24th st but that is a bit more of a walk. traffic getting off the shoreway onto w 25th or coming across the detroit-superior bridge can get backed up right around 7:00 pm so try to get there a bit earlier to avoid the worst of it. also watch out for construction on some of the side streets because they sometimes close off lanes without much warning in that part of cleveland. hope this helps you guys have a good time at the show.",1,1770737250.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False
1r13qel,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1r13qel/why_this_colleague_destroyed_our_friendship/,Why this colleague destroyed our friendship?,"I'm a 46-year-old man. For two years, I worked with a 50-year-old woman colleague who was four years older than me. We are both married and have two children of the same age. We got along very well. We were talking, going to lunch together or with other colleagues. She also brought me home-cooked food, because she knew I liked to eat well. Sometimes she would offer me cakes and snacks, a bit like a big sister I found. Sometimes she had childish behaviors with me, for example one day she ran up to me to talk to me, like a child, and then she teased me during a discussion. Whenever a meal was organized at work for a party, she insisted that I attend, because I don't like meetings between colleagues. Then it became colder and more distant. Sometimes she would come and ask me to go out at lunchtime with her to do some shopping. She often offered outings with the children, but I systematically refused, because I didn't want to see a colleague outside of work.

Then I had problems with management, a kind of harassment that I experienced very badly. For several months, I didn't talk to anyone at work, focusing on my tasks and trying to get through this difficult time. The colleague tried to find out why I was isolating myself, and simply said, ""I have a lot of work to do,"" without further explanation. One day, I ran into her on the subway, and she came to see me, offering to travel together. She had a behavior that I would describe as flirting (she would get very close to me, stick her chest against my arm, lean very close to talk to me). One day, she even walked into my office to look at something on my screen and stuck very close to me. I didn't know how to react because she's older, and I was quite surprised.

I then found another job in another office, and my departure was announced. This colleague then came to see me, congratulated me on my last day and told me that she was inviting him to lunch that day. On D-Day, she invited me and asked me if she had done something wrong, why I didn't talk to her anymore. I explained to him that I had been harassed and that I had been looking for another job, which I had found. She warmly congratulated me, praising the fact that I was ""comfortable in my job,"" ""drole"" etc. She was relieved that my distant attitude did not come from her. She then continued to engage in flirting gestures, such as touching my hand furtially with her index finger while she ate.

I then told him that, since I was leaving for another office, we could stay in touch and see each other for family outings with children and spouses (perhaps this was a mistake on my part!). Ravie seemed very excited when I contacted her offering her an outing with the children, but I noticed that she did not warn her husband when we met. That's why I then proposed family outings with the spouses. She accepted and organized several outings during the summer, and we met regularly. With our respective spouses. I thought our relationship was great. Except that sometimes, when I went out with my kids and didn't warn her, she would point out to me, ""You didn't call me, it's not nice."" Yet she did it on her side, but frankly, I didn't care. She offered small dishes and snacks, prepared pic-nics. He always seemed very motivated. She also began to criticize her husband, saying that he doesn't invest himself, that he just stays drinking coffee at home, that he is old. When I asked her about the context of their meeting, she told me that he was the one who flirted with her and that she was not interested at first, because he was unemployed at the time. Anyway, it wasn't love at first sight. She also asked me to download series from her and put them on a USB stick, something her husband could have done. When her husband was present, his behavior changed. She became silent, distant, not talking as usual. We felt that she was away from him. On the contrary, he seemed very much in love.

She promised to show me a recipe. I had proposed that she come home with her family, that we all cook together, and then eat the meal in groups. But one day after an outing with her son and my son, without the spouses exceptionally, she said, ""We'll meet at your house for the recipe. Okay, when I got home, I thought we were going to talk over coffee or tea, but she refused. She started cooking by herself, washing dishes, without saying anything. Very weird. Then she says ""the meal is ready, I have to go now"" and then she left without even talking. It was really, in my opinion, a strange scene.

She had planned to travel to Spain with her family and I told her that I knew this country well and that I preferred Portugal. She then decided to go to Portugal with her family.

She started by organizing outings with both families herself, booked hotels, offered hikes. Barbecues and home meals. She even wanted our two families to go out with the children, like at the pool, etc. She even wanted to go together to a foreign country, and to a cottage in the mountains. She also offered to organize a women's outing between her and my mother at a spa. Then, after a dozen intense outings and several invitations to dinner at each other's house, she stopped giving news. All of a sudden. She used to call to suggest outings on the spot, etc. One day her husband was supposed to help me set up a piece of furniture, which had been planned for weeks, and on D-Day, he made me look bad. She intervened to force him to keep his promise, and when I came to pick him up by car, he told me in the car during the ride ""if she wants us to part, no problem."" I didn't understand this intervention.

Then, no more news... I wrote to her several times to find out if everything was okay, and she answered me briefly. I then sent my New Year's greetings to her husband, unanswered. She promised to give me contacts from renovation companies, which she never did.

I then confronted her by text message several months later, without news... I asked her why we disappeared and why she didn't give me the promised information about the renovations. She wrote to me that she was on vacation. I wrote to him: ""You two disappeared without giving us the promised contacts, you are profiteers."" Then called twice, but I didn't answer. She then said something like, ""A true friend would have tried to find out why someone is distancing themselves,"" and then concluded, ""This is where our relationship ends.""",0,1770737197.0,NoStupidQuestions,2,0.5,False

• Nike x Stussy pants — Relaxed fit, embroidered script on the leg. Fabric’s soft but not flimsy. Looks best with a plain tee and Dunks. Nods to the collab without screaming it.



• Adidas Gazelle — Navy blue with wine heel tab. Classic silhouette, clean stitching. Not a runner, but a solid daily shoe. Pairs with jeans, cargos, even shorts if you’re brave. Yellowing on sole already, though—heads up.



• Nike Dunk Low — Batch version, leather upper holds up well. Colorway’s versatile (not another panda). Laces stay tied, toe box doesn’t crease too fast. Good entry-level Dunk if you’re testing the waters.

1r13hn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1r13hn2/the_filthy_house/,The Filthy House,"You know those old houses on the edge of town, the ones where the streets get narrow and the trees reach out like they're trying to snag you as you walk by? Mark's place was one of those. It was a creaky old bastard from the 1920s, built by some nutjob architect who swore the walls could breathe. Breathe, for Christ's sake, like bricks had lungs. Mark didn't know squat about the stories when he bought it. He was just your average middle-aged guy, an accountant with a face that looked like life had been kicking it around for years. His divorce had done a number on him in the way divorces do. His ex, Karen, left him for some slick bastard with a better job and no beer gut. Mark figured he would grab this cheap dump far from everything and start fresh. Start fresh? That's a laugh in a house like that.

At first, it wasn't bad. Mark came home from work with spreadsheets and numbers all day long, enough to drive a man batshit, and tossed his coat over a chair. An empty beer can on the coffee table. ""I'll clean it tomorrow,"" he told himself while staring at the blank walls. But tomorrow came, and the mess stayed. It piled up slow like snow drifting in overnight. The kitchen had dishes in the sink, crusted with grease that started to reek. The living room had pizza boxes, old newspapers, a busted lamp he dragged up from the basement thinking he'd fix it. ""I'll get to it,"" he muttered, but he didn't. The smell crept in as a sweet, rotting stink like fruit gone bad in the sun. Mark noticed it, but he thought you get used to anything, right?

Nights were when it started. Mark lay in bed, staring at the ceiling with those weird stains that looked like faces if you stared too long. Then he heard it as a soft scraping like fingernails dragging across the floor. Not loud, but enough to give you the chills. He sat bolt upright with his heart pounding like a drum in his chest. ""Rats,"" he said out loud to calm himself down. Rats, yeah. Made sense. He set traps the next day, baited with peanut butter, and went back to bed. But morning came with the traps empty, coated in a slimy film that smelled like sour milk. ""What the hell?"" he whispered, and he tossed more junk on the pile. A half-eaten sandwich, a cracked mug. The house seemed to soak it up so the mess grew faster than he could add to it.

The sounds got worse. Not just scraping, but cracking like bones snapping in the dead of night. Mark started closing doors, shoving chairs against them. ""It's the house settling,"" he told himself. Old houses do that. But deep down, he knew better. He found things in weird places such as a photo of Karen in the bathroom, smeared with something red that looked like blood but was just ketchup. ""How'd that get here?"" he mumbled with hands shaking. The mold on the walls grew, forming patterns like veins, throbbing in the lamplight. He stared at them for hours, feeling a cold in his bones that wasn't from any draft.

Then the whispers came. Murmurs at first like a radio half-tuned in another room. Mark rolled over in bed, pulled the pillow over his head. ""Neighbors,"" he thought. But no, it came from the piles of trash. Words he couldn't make out, but they filled him with a dread he couldn't shake. ""Feed us,"" they seemed to say in a gurgling Dutch that echoed in his skull. ""Grow with us."" He tried ignoring it, cranked the TV louder, but the voices wormed into his dreams. Dreams of Karen laughing with her face melting into the mold.

Panic set in. Mark decided to clean. Rubber gloves on, stuffing garbage bags. He worked like a madman with sweat stinging his eyes while the voices laughed as a wet, bubbling chuckle from the walls. He dragged the bags to the door, but when he came back the bags were torn open with contents writhing across the floor. Paper like worms, glass like bugs skittering, food scraps pulsing like hearts. ""No, no, no,"" he whimpered, bolting to his bedroom. Door slammed shut, but the trash followed, seeping under like fingers, across the bed. He felt it on his skin, prickling, nipping.

He wrote it down in an old notebook. ""The house is alive,"" he scrawled with hand trembling. ""The trash is its blood. I'm the prey."" He tried escaping, pounding on doors that wouldn't budge, smashing at windows coated in mold that wouldn't shatter. The voices told tales of a woman drowning in her own filth, a kid swallowed by the basement. Shadows in the corners, shapes like hands reaching out.

That last night was pure hell. Mark huddled in the corner, shaking, as the door shuddered under the assault of the mass. Walls dripped black ooze, hissing on the floor like acid. The whispers turned to screams: ""Join us! Become one!"" A thousand voices of Karen, his mom, strangers with agony and hunger twisted together. The door exploded inward in a shower of splintered wood and squirming refuse, a tidal wave of rot and fungus crashing in. Tendrils of twisted plastic coiled around his legs, slicing deep, blood mixing with slime in hot rivulets. ""Let me go!"" he roared, but the beast rose up as a face forged from cans and spoiled fruit, eyes writhing with maggots, glaring with ancient malice.

It seized him, hoisted him high with arms of sodden newspapers dripping foul ichor. The trash forced its way in through his mouth, nose, ears, choking his lungs with decay, bloating his belly like a corpse in the river. Visions assaulted him of his flesh fusing with the walls, tendrils of mold burrowing into his veins, his screams joining the chorus forever, starving for fresh victims. He clawed at his throat, gagging on chunks of rot that tasted like his own regrets, his body convulsing as the filth invaded every pore, every cell.

His final scream was a wet, strangled gargle, his skin splitting open like overripe fruit, innards spilling out to merge with the heaving pile. Pieces of him with flesh, blood, bone dissolved into the mass, nourishing the house. A deep, satisfied groan rumbled through the structure, the walls closing in like a coffin lid.

The neighbors called the cops when the stench blanketed the street like a shroud. They broke in and found a living nightmare with throbbing mold on the walls, floors undulating with trash like a breathing sea. No sign of Mark, just a notebook half-devoured by something unseen: ""It's eating me. It's fouling me. And it's starving for more.""

The house sits empty still, but at night, you hear it. Scraping, whispering. And if you stare too long, you feel the pull: step inside, add your mess. It's waiting for you, always ravenous.",1,1770736654.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

I started with an Orca EDC Pouch because they’re fairly inexpensive and well made. Contents are:

Name and address card

Note pad

Atomic Bear Rebel pen with glass breaker

Bandaids and antiseptic wipes

Sanitizer wipes

Work pro pliers

CRKT M16-03 steel handle 

Survival bandana - with survival/Scout skills printed 

Check list to keep your head together 

Diagram of knots and applications

8’ of Survival cord 

Tinder box with Pyro Putty and tinder rope

Flint and steel necklace 

Coffee filters to remove sediment from water 

Anker 5,000mAh power bank 

USB A to C cable

Olight iMini 2 magnetic LED flashlight 

Mulwark mini ratchet with bits 

4’ Duct tape 

Assorted zip ties 

Lip balm

Hand warmers

Rain poncho 

Paper towel and TP pellets 

Mini aluminum pry bar with bottle opener 

The CRKT knife isn’t light but I’ve carried one as my EDC knife for about 20 years and it’s a great tool to have. eBay has a bunch for cheap and they’re easy to fix so I grabbed a few for this purpose. 

The bandana has instructions on building shelter and fire as well as cleaning water to make potable as well as knots. It can be used as a sling or tourniquet if absolutely necessary using the Rebel pen to twist. 

I tried to fit a small Sawyer water filter straw in here too but it’s a bit much with it in there.

I found some of the final letters I received in 2022 and I've sent replies back but some new people would be cool. I send letters from South Africa and out postal service is not the most punctual so I might only receive a letter 2 to 4 months after you sent it. 

I'm a 44-year-old gay guy in a loving relationship. I'm looking to expand my horizons by meeting and talking to people from other countries and cultures. We love to travel so it would be amazing to have drinks at a coffee shop with someone I only ever wrote to. I'm not big on sending or including gifts so this is mostly just a getting to know people exercise. 

About me: I'm a huge lover of stationery (was the best part of Japan), I hoard art materials, I love video games such as World of Warcraft, Expedition 33, Civ 6, Final Fantasy 14, and Star Wars Survivor. I'm also an avid reader. Starting Heated Rivalry next and just finished The Impossible Fortune by Richard Osman. I'm also a fan of Brandon Sanderson, and I'll be embarking on the epic series by Steven Erikson soon.

• High-fat meals (like beef or eggs) raise testosterone. Eating too much fat before bed may lead to more hormonal activity while you sleep. So stop eating at least 3–4 hours before bed.

2. Limit High-Protein Intake at Night

• Protein digestion activates metabolism and testosterone.

Keep meals earlier in the day if consuming chicken, beef, eggs or whey 

3.  Cut Off Caffeine 8 hours before bed 

• Stimulants like coffee, matcha, tea, or pre-workouts late in the day overstimulate the CNS. This disrupts sleep and increases dream vividness.

4. Don’t Overhydrate at Night

• Too much water before bed leads to sleep interruptions, which spike REM intensity.

Drinking excessive water right before bed causes nocturia, which is the need to wake up during the night to urinate. This breaks the sleep cycle, likely decreasing overall sleep quality.

5. Ensure Physical Exhaustion

• Residual energy turns hormonal.

→ Weight training helps, but consider stretching, walking, or breathwork before bed to calm the system.

6. Avoid All Erotic Triggers

• Sexual thoughts, images (porn or soft porn), or conversations — even subtle ones — activate the subconscious.

→ Guard your mind and eyes fiercely. Fast from unnecessary media.

7. Sleeping Too Warm

Hey r/ProductHuntLaunches!

I built Tapfree because I always felt mobile typing feels stuck in the past. When I'm moving fast, my ideas don’t arrive as perfect sentences. They come as fragments, quick reactions, and rough thoughts I need to shape into something coherent.

Most keyboards and dictation tools don’t help much. They transcribe words literally, miss context, butcher names, and leave me fixing formatting by hand. Writing an email, a chat reply, or a document all need very different handling.

What makes Tapfree different is how it understands context. Tapfree uses on-screen context (the text field and surrounding UI), not just the app you’re in, to produce cleaner, more relevant dictation.

It also handles the way people actually talk. You say ""Could you get some coffee... sorry, tea on the way back?"" and Tapfree writes: ""Could you get some tea on the way back?"". It catches your corrections mid-sentence so you don't have to go back and fix them.

If you give it a try, I’d love specific feedback:

Which app or scenario felt noticeably better (or worse) than usual dictation?

Any ""wow"" moments with the context understanding?

What would make it even more useful for you?

I have just released it on [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/tapfree-for-android-2), and would love the feedback, as this is very much a side project and I’m still shaping it.

Overview



Brazil is a nation of great potential as it is primed to 'rule' over South America it also have some backdrafts: Low Population, you almost start with next to no peasants, while you have a lot resource rich provinces, many provinces come with Amazon Rainforest trait (-30% construction / -30% infrastructure) and a somewhat long and exhausting Questline, that gives you shot on Multiculturalism.





Opening / Regency Years



You start with a regency and the Ragamuffin Wars. So Day 1: Set the nothern Army on defense, while attacking in the South, you thrid army needs to get mobilized and maybe at some conscripts, then go for the south. Once you dealt with the south, attack the north with every you have. This for the war as most pressing matter

Now decrees: Encourage Ressource Industry on Minas Gerais, Road Maintenance on Minas Gerais and Bahia, as you are almost on the infrastructure cap. Greener Gras on Minas Gerais and Sao Paolo (Sao Paolo and Minas Gerais will both become our Industrial Centers; Minas has the Ressource, Sao Paolo will have a company HQ).

Start building up your construction while distributing Iron between Bahia and Minas, get some coal from the south. Tooling Workshops either in Minas or Sao Paolo. Dont build a new construction Center in Minas and avoid Bahia, Rio and Sao Paolo are more fine. When you built a steel mill either for tools or Motors, built in Sao Paolo.

Research: You are a little backwards, compared to the GP but not that far off all in all. Important Research for the Start: Stock Exchange, Atmospheric Engine, Railroads, Water-Tubed Boiling, this should keep you busy for quite some time.

Laws: We have Slave Trade enabled and this is good for now as it gives up some decent flow of pops by slave trade. The rest of the laws are ok for 1836, besides a few changes we want to do now: Public Schools and Open Borders, both should be reachable with the starting government. Give Concessions to Intelligentsia, Industrialist always. PB, Devout, Armed forces if needed. With Landowners it is a gamble and most of the time not worth it.

Afer that you can either go for some kind Colonialisation, Interventionism or Dedicated Police Force. Right to Assembly and Propertied Woman should be out of reach, but if you have a shot try it.

Dont touch tenant Farmers, it needs to stay for a overly long time.



Movements nothing to fancy yet, if you have 200 authority spent it on supressing the pro-slavery movement.



Foreign Politics: declare interest on the whole SA, Dixie. Rule: South America, then on in North America to open diplomacy with the us, then central America. Afterwards Central Europe so you get some Diplomatic options for Austria, Prussia and Russia

Rivalry Bolivia and maybe Netherlands or any country you want that wasnt mentioned now.

Improve Relations on Brits, France, US, Russia. (in that order not on the same time, but the first two you share a land border with and the other two tend to try exert control over SA). Now get a transfer goods treaty with coffee with the US (most of the time if you make it bilateral they will accept and you can always use fabric or wood).





The Fate of Bolivia: Now you have unpaused, won the Ragamuffin War, Time to look towards Bolivia-Peru. Our goal is to protectorate Bolivia and there for indirect get peru as well. Chile, Ecuador, Argentinia might also attack, best idea is to call them in for war goals and give out provinces like candy (you will take them back later), if you really insist on taking some land: La Paz or Santa Cruz, but you will struggle with your own lands, no need for more land you cant populate. 







The early Years of Pedro



Basically more of the same: Keep on Iron, Coal, Tools, start expanding your universities one per province to get the qualification buff. A few Armies just to see them grow. (Esp since bolivia stays strong as your protectorate you need to get 5x then them). Railroads once you researched it and expand steel industry in Sao Paolo. Depending on your population you need to watch out, dont be afraid to subsidize any Coal / Iron / Tools industry to keep you afloat, same for motor and railroads. Any labor saving pm is your friend with Brazil at least early on. 

If you lucky you get some migration from the Ottomans or Russia, if not no biggie.



The War(s) with Argentina: As i mentioned before you should expand your unis so you will sooner or later need paper. And Brazil lacks one thing Sulfur. Argentina has it. Bolivia/Peru has it too, but to get them to employ a mine can take time. So we want to redistribute the Argentinian states. This may take more wars, depending how good you control bolivia as the get a libery desire bonus if you have infamy (+0.10 for 25 and +0.25 for 50). You want to own: Corrientes, Santa Fe, Chaco, Tucumán and Jujuy. The rest you want to protectorate: Don't eat Argentina as a whole as they hold a claim on uncolonized Buenos Aires and Mendoza, if you eat them, the Europeans (read Brits and maybe France) will colonize and you have no chance to outrace them. Just a small notice for the war: dont end the war early, let them capitulate, but more on this later.



magnanimous Monarch: Time to adress the Elefant in the room: the magnanimous Monarch Questline: Basically the questline needs you to stay slaver and tenant farmer, while also fighting the landowners. It takes a long time and ends with death of Pedro where you need to have at least 6 points. You should get one point at the start of the game for marginalizing the armed forces unless you invested to early in the army. The rest i will mention later, just so far: embrace slave trade and let him go unchecked as long as the brits are ok with it.



Integrating the Brazilian Nation: this is nowadays a very hard JE, at least for me: while integrating the four cultures isnt that hard, the end of 65 fervor is: you get fervor by people dying in war, this is why i said dont end any war early and by educating your people: one of the reasons we expand our universities and opened with public schools (besides Brazils abysmal literacy), so keep your max fervor insight as it isnt a cakewalk to get there. 



Your first Company and companies so on: Brazil doesnt have many good companies imho (as all of south america): Our first choice should be: Fundicâo Ipanema. Give them coal as industry rights, trade rights, so you dont have to keep up with the trade centers. Afterwards there is not much: The Traincompany gives engines, but also boost our coffee throughput, giving the landowners more money. I like the generic Forestry company a bit more over the flavored as Hardwood isnt that good of a prestige good and it has rubber instead of paper. The Clothes company fits also in it boosting our rubber output but this is more for the late game. I ran with Steel, Forestry, Trains and then Construction company from the pb and oil. But yes the steel company is good and should be picked first.



How to spend Money: as we are pop capped in our construction, chances are our coffers are full, especially if we got some gold mines from Argentina and expanded them next to the sulfur (subsidize!). So while we want expand our Universities and Military/Navy, we still probably making a profit. So instead of lowering taxes we give more money on goverment wages: (boosting the intelligentsia) and military wage boosting our prestige. 





Heir to the Empire



Sooner or later we will get to The Brazilian Succession Questline. Our heir had died and the next inline is a girl! Oh no! We groom her for the throne, take monarch point hit of 1, after ten years and finally having propertied woman, we get 3 monarch points (net +2),making Isabel our designated heir. 



Oh while we are at laws: We can't get rid of slavery! or can we? I told you to go for colonization, not only to colonize Chaco and Alto Paraguay, but we can switch to Colonial Slavery. Getting rid of all slaves in incorperated states, pleasing the brits and boosting our SOL, though we are tanking our plantation money a tiny bit, but this is the time to go for. Allowing us to enable Cultural exclusion in the aftermath. So we get even more People from immigration. Now is also the time to go for Interventionism or even better Laissez Faire.



Elections: a lot of changes the Landowners dont like, so we need ammend some stuff, but also while election rigging is not nice, it is an option we should use once in a while, (cheese: push the decision in the background, let the game run a week, look at the predicted results, if the landowner party has a huge margin, favor the intelligentsia party. Works best if you have a two party system, though the free trade party mostly can form a coalition with the liberals)



The Naval power JE: is basically not that hard, just keep an eye on it and spend once a while a 5 or 10 stack on your fleet. Giving us more prestige and interesting in the process.



Power Bloc: Speaking of prestige: Do we have the nice golden ring around our number yet (monarch +1) ? Once we are a great power we form a PB: Now which one do we want? We dont have that much influence to spray around, so sovereign empire is useless, Trade block is meh as we just could the get meso americans into it, giving us more of things we have in abudance. But Cultural Commonwealth is actually awesome, not only will it stay at 100 cohession most of the time, we can spread our culture into other countries giving us more fervor. With Freedom of Movement we also have exact a mandate, we probably want, boosting our immigration. Other Mandate recomandations: Construction (to at least somewhat counter the andes and rainforest debuffs), Companies is always great, Food standardization gives +1 Sol. The rest is rather meh. Shared Canon can be nice, Advanced Research maybe too late. So i went for Companies and Construction.







Playing the long Game:



Now we are set, all we need is for Pedro to die, he gets sickly first (-1), so we make sure we dont touch slavery and tenant farmers as both give (-1) and we sit on a nice 7 if we have completed integrating the nation, bringing us to a 6 after we declined the republican proposal.



So all we do is wait and built our economy, we research: Vulcanization (rubber mastication for that matter too, but we also want the rubber plantations to be profitable), Human Rights (enables Compulsory Primary Schools and therefor Education Institution 5), Civlizing Mission giving us another trigger for Mass Immigration.



We may give and get some investment rights (avoid brit and us) as our construction should be able to keep up with foreign investors that are not brits, pushing us probably to number 2-4 as a great power.



We conquer/protectorate slowly the rest of south america, We want Venuzela as incorperated land for the oil in the long run, we can colonize, we can open Japan, China. Mostly we just sit and wait for Pedro to die.



The Death of Pedro



Isabel should be on the throne now with the sweet enlightened monarch trait: Fully abolish slavery, then fight for Multiculturalism, Commercialized Agriculture, Swap investment right with the brits and be the worlds no.1 producer with an endless stream migrants, while the brits eat all your arable land and mines, you make money of Engines, Steel, tools and Cars (oil and rubber too).

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

1r133vq,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1r133vq/recursive_data_cleaner_hits_v10_full_generate/,Recursive Data Cleaner hits v1.0 - Full generate → apply cycle,"Three weeks ago I shared a tool that trades compute time for human time: point an LLM at messy data, walk away, come back to working cleaning functions.



v1.0 closes the loop. You can now apply those generated functions directly to your full dataset.



The complete workflow:

    # Generate cleaning functions (go grab coffee) 
    recursive-cleaner generate messy_data.jsonl \   
    --provider mlx \   
    --model ""Qwen3-80B-MLX-4bit"" \   
    --instructions ""Normalize phones, fix date formats"" \   
    --tui

    # Apply to your data 
    recursive-cleaner apply messy_data.jsonl \   
    --functions cleaning_functions.py



That's it. No Python required.



**What's new since v0.7:**

\- **Terminal UI** \- Live progress dashboard with a transmission log showing what the LLM finds and fixes (see video)

\- **CLI tool** \- Works natively with MLX (Apple Silicon), and any OpenAI compatible API endpoint

\- **Apply mode** \- JSONL, CSV, JSON, Parquet, Excel in → same format out. PDFs and Word docs → cleaned markdown



**Why v1.0?**

It handles the full cycle I originally wanted: analyze → generate → apply. The LLM has agency over the process - it decides when data is clean, when patterns are saturated, and when to consolidate redundant functions.



555 tests, \~5,000 lines of Python, minimal dependencies.



Trade compute for human attention. Let the model that understands your data make decisions about your data.

1r132sm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductHunters/comments/1r132sm/just_launched_tapfree_a_voicefirst_android/,Just launched Tapfree - a voice-first Android keyboard that adapts to what’s on your screen,"Hey r/ProductHunters!

I built Tapfree because I always felt mobile typing feels stuck in the past. When I'm moving fast, my ideas don’t arrive as perfect sentences. They come as fragments, quick reactions, and rough thoughts I need to shape into something coherent.

Most keyboards and dictation tools don’t help much. They transcribe words literally, miss context, butcher names, and leave me fixing formatting by hand. Writing an email, a chat reply, or a document all need very different handling.

What makes Tapfree different is how it understands context. Tapfree uses on-screen context (the text field and surrounding UI), not just the app you’re in, to produce cleaner, more relevant dictation.

It also handles the way people actually talk. You say ""Could you get some coffee... sorry, tea on the way back?"" and Tapfree writes: ""Could you get some tea on the way back?"". It catches your corrections mid-sentence so you don't have to go back and fix them.

If you give it a try, I’d love specific feedback:

* Which app or scenario felt noticeably better (or worse) than usual dictation?
* Any ""wow"" moments with the context understanding?
* What would make it even more useful for you?

I have just released it on [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/tapfree-for-android-2), and would love the feedback, as this is very much a side project and I’m still shaping it.

2. Wooden floors are in the road map, but we need to take care of a few things first, so we are stuck with grey tiles for now.
3. We are having American shutters installed in the two skinny windows in the lounge.
4. My husband hates the lounge carpet, so I want to layer another carpet on but have no idea what 
5. We need a standing lamp but again,  not sure what style would suit 
6. I love and am looking for the classic Scandi look
7. The coffee table looks ridiculously small in the photos,  but not so bad in real life. Its also practical and we love it.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )

I significantly reduced my caffeine intake in Sept 2025 and now drink about 2-3 sodas a week, down from 2-3 a day. Multiple sources are reporting on this study which seems to be fairly well done.

That being said no idea if it was the caffeine that lowered risk or some of lifestyle that went along with it.

>Coffee and tea contain bioactive ingredients like polyphenols and caffeine, which have emerged as possible neuroprotective factors that reduce inflammation and cellular damage while protecting against cognitive decline. Though promising, findings about the relationship between coffee and dementia have been inconsistent, as studies have had limited follow-up and insufficient detail to capture long-term intake patterns, differences by beverage type, or the full continuum of outcomes — from early subjective cognitive decline to clinically diagnosed dementia.

>Higher tea intake showed similar results, while decaffeinated coffee did not — suggesting that caffeine may be the active factor producing these neuroprotective results, though further research is needed to validate the responsible factors and mechanisms.
