P-p-p-p-pilot man

I’m a pilot man

With a pilot plan

I’m gonna make you cry

In pilot land

I’m a cool guy, talkin’ fighter jets

And I’m definitely not… a cop

Count: Why’d you say you’re not a cop?

Trigger: Because I’m not

Count: …I think you are a cop

Jaeger: Yeah, I also think you’re a cop

Trigger: Listen, boys, you better both stop Or I’ll have you arrested… I mean… I’m not a cop

I’m a pilot man

With a pilot tan

Spend my days in a big, black unmarked van

If you wanna talk turkey, I’m here to talk planes

And I’m definitely not… a cop


Count: You’re a motherfucking cop

Jaeger: I can tell from the way that you stand

Count: And you said you work from an unmarked van

Trigger: Listen, boys ahblah blah blah… I’m not a cop

I’m a pilot man

In a coffee shop

With a loaded pistol and a bulletproof vest

My wife was killed by a drug cartel

I’m not a cop

P-p-p-p-pilot man

P-p-p-p-pilot man

P-p-p-p-pilot man

Count: Why does he have a gun?

Trigger: Ski-bi-di-bi-dap-dap-dap-di-bi-dap (pilot)

Radio: Calling Officer Trigger, has your cover been blown?

Count: Is that your police radio?

Trigger: That was my pilot phone. And the “cover” they mean is when I sang Money by Pink Floyd… Yeah, that’s a pilot song

Jaeger: Saying “pilot” before a word doesn’t make it pilot-related and if I may critique the whole police system oh wait, what do you know, now there’s a sniper aiming at my forehead

Trigger: No there isn’t

Jaeger: Yes, there is

Trigger: No, there isn’t

Jaeger: See this little red dot?

Trigger: …Yes?

Jaeger: That’s for a sniper shot

Trigger: There’s no snipers here, and no police plot
(Snipers ready) Do it now, take the shot!

I’m a pilot man, talking with two friends

And one has a single chicken pock on their head

I don’t know the guy in camouflage

With an M-21 pointed at your head

Sniper: You don’t know me?
I was best man at your wedding!

Trigger: I’m a pilot man not friends with snipers!

Sniper: Oh yeah? (Oh yeah)

BANG

Trigger: Ah! He shot me in the leg!

Count: He shot him in the leg!

Trigger: He shot my left leg!

Jaeger: He shot him in the left leg!

He’s a pilot man who’s definitely not a cop
But now hes been shot in his left leg

Say my name.

Trigger: I don’t know your name!

Count: Just say it or he’ll shoot again!

Alex: Fine! Dwink Bexon!

Jaeger: …What?
Trigger: That’s his name Dw-ink Bexon

Count: Dumb name

BANG

Trigger: Ah! Dwink just shot me in the other leg!

Count: He’s a pilot man getting shot in the legs
By his ex-best man he’s not a cop

Dwink: I’m a bad cop if you couldn’t tell
I also killed your wife in that drug cartel

Count: Call for backup or we’re all gonna die
Just admit you’re a cop and save our lives

Trigger: Boys… I’d do anything to make this stop
But I’ve told you before… I’m not a cop

P-p-p-p-pilot man

P-p-p-p-pilot man

P-p-p-p-pilot man

I told you before I do pilot only

P-p-p-p-pilot man (with a b-b-b-briefcase)

P-p-p-p-pilot man (and a b-b-b-ballpoint pen, ah)

He’s definitely… not… a cop

1mlk3qq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mlk3qq,Duac + Aknemycin Plus Treatment Outbreak,"Hello everyone, I (male, 24 years old) have been suffering from acne for 10 years and need some advice. Over the last two to three years, my acne has improved somewhat, but it has never completely disappeared. That's why I started using my current products regularly. My dermatologist prescribed Duac Acne 10 mg/g 50 mg/g and Aknemycin Plus (40 mg erythromycin, 0.25 mg tretinoin), which I have been using intensively for a month now. My skin and body are extremely dry overall, so even shaving my beard causes skin cracks.

I am now wondering whether my routine is too extreme and the breakout is unusuall, as even my cheeks, where I never used to have pimples, are getting small white spots and I am getting breakouts on my neck, or whether this is just my normal purge due to the treatment. I often get redness and itching on my neck at the moment, so I skip the treatment there for some days and only use soothing cream.

My routine is as follows:

In the morning:

Avene Cleanance Cleansing Gel

Aknemycin Plus

After two minutes: Noreva Zeniac Lp Forte (kerato-regulating care)

and Avène Cleanance Hydra or No Cosmetics No celebrate today ALL-In Cream (ceramide complex + Arnica Mexicana)



In the evening:

Avene Cleanance Cleansing Gel

Duac Acne Gel (10 mg/g + 50 mg/g clindamycin + benzoyl peroxide)

and sometimes Avene Cleanance Hydra or No Cosmetics No celebrate today ALL-In Cream if my skin gets too dry or red.

I am also currently trying to avoid many products that could fuel my acne, such as dairy products, sugar, pork, soy and the like, and I only drink water and one black coffee in the morning. Has anyone done the same treatment or can give me their opinion on my current treatment? My goal is to stick with it until the end of November, and if there is no improvement by then, to switch to Accutane, which I actually wanted to avoid, but is my only option.",1,1754726811.0,acne,0,1.0,False

For the past 3 warm seasons I've been traveling (opposed to wintering in Slabs), I've always known 7-Eleven as the one gas station that'll charge ya 50¢ for hot water in your own bottle instead of just letting you fill up, and the workers will always stare at you the entire time regardless of what you're doing. This time around, every 7-Eleven has been great to me—but Starbucks has been shit, unlike before. I've been getting hot coffee with EBT at this 7-Eleven while homebummin' for a few weeks now—they either scan it as iced coffee, or scan some cheap food item instead so it counts. Or sometimes they just give it to me for free (along with other random freshly expired goodies). Mental health sure is a weird experience as a traveler. Sometimes it's easy to get so caught up with sur-thrival mode that I'll have to stop and ask myself ""Wait a sec... what's goin' on? Why am I moving so slow / why are things off / why am I homebummin' / why am I so fucking tired"", and I'll have to remind myself about brain chemicals and trauma n shit. And also to be kind to myself. So a hot coffee every night has been great, and hopefully I get over this homebummin' phase soon. It's cold as hell here for August, but I guess I'm grateful to be able to say that. Here's what I keep (half?) learning: If you go back to your hometown thinking you've conqured your PTSD and can easily just pass through after visiting friends, you might royally humbled. And if that happens, get yourself a coffee. It's okay. Get yourself 17 if you can, especially if you end up stuck and are lucky enough to be stuck next to a gas station with hella chill workers. Even if ya do it annually and keep getting humbled like a stubborn teen that won't learn their lesson, don't forget the coffee. Take care of your mental health y'all...

He had Parkinson’s, needed support and he was my everything💜.

I was living across continents from him but I had found a system where I had speed-dial, practical support on the ground and could enable a lot from afar. However, I was always missing someone of my cognitive ability to support my dad with meaningful chats and check-ins, support with tech, simple activities like  grocery shopping and a coffee afterwards (you get my point) and I never found that person. Not because I wouldn’t pay their charge, there was just no system in place to source that skill and manage the transaction. 

I would have paid an arm and a leg for this kind of support mainly because it would have given my dad and myself peace of mind. Also, the amount of traveling I had to do up and down to check on him and follow up on more sensitive matters was A LOT.  Money I would rather have spent on him receiving check-ins 2/3 times a week.

So I am looking into what I can facilitate around this in South Africa. Cape Town specifically as a start. But wonder what adult children (especially those living abroad ) would be willing to pay for this sort of higher-skilled, cognitive support for their parents.

I write code, drink coffee from the machine, and watch the crazy world around me. I look for humor to avoid losing my mind. There’s plenty of humor if you’re willing to see it — it helps lessen the sadness. For example, it’s funny when people try to be smarter than they really are, by taking IQ tests, assessment exams, and other modern ways of measuring human resources.

One day, she appeared in our team. Lena. A blonde with huge, slightly crazy eyes — like two IDE windows filled with errors.

After she arrived, the men in the office either quickly refreshed their wardrobe or stretched. Vadim from QA, usually smelling of instant noodles, put on a tie with hedgehogs.

""Hi, I’m Lena!"" — and the programmers immediately Googled: ""How do you know if a girl likes you?""

I also tried to flirt. Invited her to lunch. She replied: ""Thanks, but I’m with Ira from accounting."" Ira is a woman whose gaze could stop a nuclear missile.

After a month of her aloofness, Lena was labeled a bit silly. She asked how VPN works. Everyone burst into laughter, more than appropriate. ""Beauty demands sacrifice,"" said Olga from HR. ""But not brains.""

The women’s team organized a challenge: “Find the typo in the technical specifications.” Lena searched, found, and was corrected: “No, it’s correct here!” They chuckled slyly. She smiled: “Thanks, now I’ll know!”

Bets were placed in the chat:

* 500 that she’d cry by Friday.
* 100 that she’d quit.

But Lena began arriving earlier than everyone else. Asked the former accountant, now janitor — Aunt Luda — how to set up Excel. Chatted with the sysadmin about BIOS and databases. During breaks, she fed Vasily the cat, whom everyone hated for stealing food.

Lena was patiently friendly. “She’s pretending!” — was whispered in the smoking room. Lena learned… she typed late into the night. She studied and practiced… Once she even helped Vadim fix the touchpad.

Later, Lena sorted out a mess in our crooked API — faster than the smartest with IQ and certificates. She was often silent at meetings, but when she spoke, she cut like Ctrl+X.

And then she left. Not for maternity leave. Not for some sweet affair… A person in a suit more expensive than my mortgage came by: “Your ex-colleague is now our CTO (one of the directors of the IT hierarchy). Try to get an offer from her.”

In the chat:

* Maybe she’s sleeping with someone she should.
* With AI...

For some reason, I remembered how she spent an hour explaining to the cleaner how to take and send a photo to her grandson… Honestly, I miss Lena. Without her, the swamp feels even more toxic. I miss feeding Vasily, so he wouldn’t steal food and purr. Vasily now is a respected member of the team — he sleeps on Lena’s chair as if waiting.

My name is Artyom. I write code, drink coffee from the machine, and watch the crazy world. I think intelligence isn’t about IQ — it’s about how many fools are willing to listen to you. How many fools you’re willing to listen to. Lena listened to everyone. And she took their foolishness with her — up above.

1mljuyn,https://www.reddit.com/r/satisfactory/comments/1mljuyn/is_there_a_market_for_an_architects_dlc/,Is there a market for an Architects DLC?,"It seems people spend most of their time in this game building absolutely beautiful constructions with questionable functionality. A lot of the build techniques are hacky (foundation rotation, using signs as strip lighting, etc). The are also mods of course. 

But why don’t the devs go all in and develop a DLC centered around beautification. People would buy this in droves right?
Some of the things I’d like to see are: 

- Better options for lighting. Different shapes, variable sizes (click and drag), etc. 
- More materials, and increase the types of building you can apply materials to. 
- Glass materials that allow you to reskin objects as transparent. 
- Complete reskins of producer buildings. 
- Proper support for angular and curved construction. This would be the most technically complicated, and might involve placing curvy foundations, and having walls that automatically become curved when snapped to a foundation curve.
Allow foundation build modes similar to belts and pipes, where you select “curve” and it does a smooth transition between two points. 

These changes would represent major development work, so I don’t expect Coffee Stain to spend months on it without charging money for it. I’m happy to pay. ",1,1754725849.0,satisfactory,1,1.0,False

1mljt78,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Pristine_Pie_8249/comments/1mljt78/vent/,Vent,"In my 19 years of life, I’ve fallen in love two times. And both times, I ended up heartbroken. I feel like maybe it’s my fault maybe it’s karma, or something like that. I don’t really know.

Being 19, almost 20, doesn’t feel that different. Sometimes I still feel like I’m 17. When I was little, I used to dream about growing up fast. I wanted my own house, my own kitchen, my own room. I wanted a safe space where cats could feel happy and calm. That was my dream.
But now that I’ve grown… 

When I was 15, I started having panic attacks. Looking back now, I think I was really depressed. A lot happened around that time. I was cheated on with my cousin and I was pregnant. I felt so alone. I didn’t understand why I was feeling that way, but I started to keep everything to myself. I stopped talking to people. I isolated.

I think a lot of that came from the COVID lockdowns. It made everything feel worse. The same routine and people. Still living with my ex. The feeling like nobody really sees you anymore. That’s when I started to change.

A was the pretty girl at school. The yapper. The one everyone liked, the one with the good future. Nobody could not like her it was almost impossible. R was different. Quiet at first. Or maybe that’s just how I saw her, since I’ve known her since middle school. She was more of a follower. A teenager trying to fit into something. I think she’s changed now, she’s more confident and social. 

Funny how both of them ended up cheating and being cheated on. Both of them got pregnant too. And that made me feel sad in a strange way. Like we all went through something messy and painful, but differently. Our group chats went silent after I left for the US. The chat that was once filled with memes, and chisme and I miss yous it was just me. No friends anymore. Just screenshots and memories.

Have you ever smelled something and felt like you were being pulled back in time? That happens to me a lot. Smells make me feel things. Sometimes sad, but mostly peaceful. When I first got to the US I caught a smell of flowers, something sweet, something green. It reminded me of new beginnings. My first home with my family here. I thought maybe this is it. Maybe I get to start over, build something new. And for a moment, it felt like that.

But then I became the antisocial girl. Not because I wanted to be but because I didn’t know how else to exist.

For months, I felt lonely. The kind of lonely that hurts in your chest. I’d wake up with my alarm, put in one AirPod, play music, and get ready for school. I was still trying to stretch five pairs of jeans and T-shirts into different outfits, going through my sister’s closet to make something work. Back then, I wasn’t even that big I could still pull off cool fits sometimes.

School was just routine. I started in geography, sitting in the back, quiet, always doing my work. Then the next class, and the next. Lunch I never had anyone to sit with, so I went to the library, every day.

After school? Same thing. Go home. Clean. Cook. Eat. Maybe go to the gym. Make lunch for my pa. Sleep. Repeat.

That routine broke the day someone started talking to me in my first class. At first, I thought he was just annoying. He’d steal my seat in the back even though we had assigned seats and bring his loud friend with him, or take the seat next to mine just to sleep. Always with his mouth open and loud music.

But one day after a test, we ended up talking. He failed. I passed. I told him I wasn’t even supposed to be in that class, that I got mixed up because my grade reports were missing. And somehow, the conversation didn’t stop. We started texting too.

For the first time in a long time, I felt happy. I felt hopeful. It was something new something good. He had a crush on me. I liked him but I think I just liked the attention. I started to stay after school with him sometimes. We hung out with his friends. We skated. But he was too young for me even though it’s only a year he was still 2 grades below me. I am very thankful for that person even though things didn’t work out. 

But then summer came and we stopped talking. The loneliness came back heavy, like a wave I couldn’t hold back. I did make more friends people from ESL. Mexicans, Cubans, Peruvians, Colombians. A little mix of all of us. But I never really felt close to any of them. I think that’s my problem. I need to feel a real connection with someone to open up, and I just can’t.

To them, I was just that funny, awkward girl. The one who made jokes sometimes but kept her distance. I tried. I swear I did. But no one ever reached out to me except one new kid from Peru. I joked around with him a lot. I think because I was the first one who made him feel welcomed, he felt comfortable with me. I regret not being friendlier to him during summer. But I was going through it bad. 

I ended up developing an eating disorder after I gained fifteen pounds.I purged. Every single day and I did not eat unless I was really hungry. I think that’s one of the things that contributed to my gallstones pain because I kept vomiting and vomiting and that shit hurt. But I had that pain since after I was pregnant. And I drank a lot when I was in Mexico so…

I made a routine. I got up early I washed my face and put ice on it and lotion after. It helps with bloating. I did intermittent fasting. I drank black coffee in the morning to help with hunger. I went to gym almost every day. I tried to eat healthy whenever I did eat. I slept early. I brushed my teeth morning middle of the day and night. The only people I talked to was my family and not even they talked a lot. 

“Senior year is going to be my year” 
It’s so funny how things ended up. I was pretty excited to go back to school. I was a little committed to making new friends and I doing great until I talked to this one guy in English class thinking we could be friends. First day with our official teacher for the year. She made us stand up and talk about ourselves like an elementary kid it was stupid. I think I just said “My name es Eve I’m 17 and I like cats” I had a hard time speaking English.

I was in the back with my head down on the desk with my hands I think I was trying to sleep after. There was this boy in my section of desks and he asked for my name after class and I just told him my name and left the class. I realized that was mean and it was a good opportunity to make friends so speedwalked to him in the hallway. I asked him for his name and what was his next class. His name is J
and he get out early so we just walked for like less than 5 minutes to my classroom and said our goodbyes.

I tried sitting in the same seat I was so I can get the chance to speak to him but the week went by and we always somehow ended up far from each other. I kept forgetting to check where he was sitting and I’m not very good at remembering faces so yeah. Until one day… 

Picture day. I was excited to take my pictures. My picture was scheduled for my English class period. As the teacher was telling us what time we were going out to the auditorium I get a paper note. To be honest I don’t remember what it said. But that’s how we started to officially talk. We asked each other questions to get to know each other better and it was fantastic. I really thought he was gonna be a “friend” but at the same time I didn’t because I could feel how he kinda liked me. Why else would you talk to me like that. We walked and sat and waited together. He even thought I almost ditched him because I went to the restroom after he did and I didn’t tell me and he was just waiting outside. We laughed and I believe we enjoyed each other’s company. I did.

We exchanged socials. I ended up texting him first. He had work so he didn’t text until later at night. That was the beginning of my life with him.  After a week we ended up going out on a date. He took me to a breakfast place and the mall. That was my first time out like that here. I was honestly just trying to make him like me even though i didn’t really want anything serious. I played around too much with him and we ended up kissing in the arcade. For the first time in my life I met a guy who got horny that easily. I was a little surprised and then this guy was actually trying to get freaky in the parking lot. I ended up rejecting him and we went back inside. He spoiled me. I guess that’s what got me to not stop talking to him.

J a yapper, he’s a funny guy with a black humor and he showed that he really liked me. What really got me was his personality. He’s really sweet if you get to see it and he was just an amazing boy with a little bit of daddy and ex issues but who doesn’t have issues you know. We talked for a month until the September 20th he started to get serious and asked me to be his girlfriend. I didn’t want to but it was like a threat he told me he was going to stop talking to me because he wanted something serious and I just liked him and I didn’t want to stop us. I told him yes and I didn’t think we were going to last because I did not have my whole heart into us and was even planning out my future without him, college, military. And once whenever I mentioned it he got all sad like a puppy and I thought to myself “but are we even going to still be together”.

Another month or less passed. I fell head over heels for him. Badly. I didn’t see it coming at all but we did everything in our power to see each other. In school we were always together when we weren’t in class. We skipped class together. We went out to eat. We went to his house and hung out. We FaceTimed all the time even when we were sleeping. My sister was so annoyed. At some point I realized I loved him. I realized I wanted him forever. 

We spent my birthdays together ❤️
We spend new years together. I met his family, I went to his thanksgiving family dinner. We went out all the time. To the malls, eating, at the parks, playing stupid Roblox games, we made our whole Minecraft world with our fake chicken children. We had deep conversations about our experiences our lives before we met each other. We cried together. We cried in each other’s arms. We met each other siblings. I stayed at his dads sometimes whenever he went. He tried to teach me how to smoke and I ended up coughing so much at that park parking I thought to myself “why do people do this” it was so funny. He was always in my last class after he quit his job. He made me feel like the prettiest girl. He made me happy and I loved him.

Have you ever had someone give you rowers every month? Yeah I did, it was really romantic. We made our own words that we only understood or the way we talked to each other we were comfortable with each other. I loved how he always puts the people he loves first. I loved how he changed his hair how I liked it. I love how he always talked to me I’m a loving way he would only to me. 

We had sex after 2 months and it was his first time and I wasn’t romantic I regret that and his mom was downstairs but we were so horny. After that we had sex all the time. He snuck in my house and that’s when we had for the first time naked sex. I loved his whole body and his chest hair, his smell, the look he gave me, his hand placement, his big hands, his lips, his random stupid jokes he made, how goofy he was, his obsession with my titties, his dick, everything. 

At some point we had to get jobs. I was 17 and he was 18 we were already almost out of high school and we kept looking and looking and he ended up getting a job near my house. He always came during his lunch breaks and I would sometimes give him food and sweets. I did not find a job for my whole senior year. I was really holding myself back and there really wasn’t anywhere they got back to me. So I just waited and texted him always when he was working on the weekends and later after school.

J gets stressed out a lot by his mom. He couldn’t take it anymore one time. He ended up staying at my house in my room and the only person who knew was my older sister. We showered together for the first time and he peed in a cup because my brothers were still home and they didn’t know he was there. It was such a happy feeling being with him. Like we lived together. We slept together. We ate together. He came to my house straight after work it was so nice. Obviously he went back home after a week. 

We graduated together. J and me graduated high school. What an accomplishment. Now we’re weren’t just a high school couple now we were high school sweethearts. 

After of a month of just being at home I found a job at a warehouse. They paid good and now that I was an adult I needed money. Not even a month and my sister and me were arguing all the time about me going out and this and that. I ended up leaving. I moved to J with his mom and stepdad and 2 small siblings. It was scary for sure and his mom gave me a condition that I have to study for something. It was really good staying with J and seeing him every night after work. I made good money and didn’t have a lot of bills. I blew that money with J. Before that J always spoiled me but after I got a job a did. 

I was happy with J. All those good memories with him are special to me. Even when we argued over stupid stuff we always fixed it. We made his room our little crib. We bought a new bed a new tv and lots of stuff. I was happy with what we had there but every now and then we had problems with his mom but it was still fine. I dyed my hair so many colors. I got tattoos with J. I got piercings. I was always wearing his clothes because I gained 30 pounds throughout our relationship. 

I was happy with J but I fell back into depression. Without noticing I had isolated myself. I didn’t talk to my family. I didn’t have friends. I was always in the room. I slept a lot. At some point I was always hitting the dispo every week. But it never got bad bad. But I was having like panic attacks or anxiety attacks. I don’t really know what it caused it. I think I just make myself like that. And it bothered J. He worried for me. I wanted to be dead. I felt like I was going nowhere. I didn’t want to keep feeling like that so I started taking antidepressants. They made my life so much better 

Whenever J and me talked any the future we always said we were going to make a family and I was going to be a housewife with a cat cafe and later on in our mid twenties get married and before I hit 30 we were going to try for kids. 
We were supposed to buy a house. Get a truck. Get a big dog. Have a farm. Live by the nature. 

We moved to our first apartment because I didn’t do my part of the conditions for living at J’s . I was planning on moving out by myself but J insisted on coming with me. I regret that decision…

We moved to a ghetto small one bedroom apartment. There was roaches and gum shots on our first night it was funny because we were just telling each other “this isn’t that bad” I thought to myself as long as we make it our home. We had a bean bag I bought from Facebook marketplace and the tv the living room was empty and the fridge wasn’t working. But we still had each other.

We’ve been a little less lovey dove with each other. J was always on his phone and i don’t know what we were doing but we it was like a routine. We were poor. J quit his job to get a better paying job at my job but last minute they told him they’re not hiring him. He was unemployed for 2 weeks. For me it wasn’t bad but I still had to get from my saving because we had just moved out and I noticed he doesn’t like doing chores. I noticed he only did them before because of his mom. So I cleaned and made our home a home. J wasn’t really putting effort in doing that. 

“What’s something he really likes? Sex”
What if we bring another person into our relationship just to spice things up and a change into our lives. Worst decision ever. 

Long story short for that he left me and he keeps leaving me.he left me at my lowest. I begged. He cheated on me. While we were still arguing he left out with a friend and he asked for a girls number. On the day we broke up that night he went out on a date with her. They kissed. I didn’t know if this and I was still trying to talk things out with J because how can you just ignore the person you love like that. 

One of my flaws is I am really emotionally attached to him. I wanted to fix things that week and talk to him when he had asked for space. I had begged him to stay that week because he had just told me he didn’t want to be with me anymore and he didn’t care how I felt about that. 
I felt abandoned unloved. Like everything was a lie. After everything we went through together how can you just ignore everything. I contemplated on killing myself. I was in the bathtub with a blanket and shattered glass. I was smoking heavily. I was drinking. I was taking pills from his old prescription. I wasn’t eating. I was alone. 

After around a week or two he started to act like the J I knew. I forgave him. I wanted to fix things between us. But we just ended up in a cycle of me not trusting him and blowing up. He always chose to leave me. I hate how he always chose to leave me. In the house by myself overthinking everything. He tried after a few times he genuinely seemed like he was ready to get better with me. After “trying” with him a few times I didn’t believe him. So I tried to give some part of me into trying because I’m scared of getting hurt like that. And at some point I really believed it and I was really to give it my all but he did it again. He left and ignored me. Like he always does. He expects us to be normal after a week. I don’t understand why he keeps leaving and ignoring me. It makes me think i really am the crazy ex because I always end up blowing up his phone. I dont trust him anymore. I want to but I can’t without a change and knowing all this there’s still a huge part of me wanting to just try. 

And now I’m here in bed crying after blowing up his phone. Because he didn’t come home after work. I texted him some harsh stuff and I think his not going to forgive me. I insinuated that I was done with him. So he just told me it’s over. 

I was trying to focus on myself by going to the gym. Talking to old friends. Talking to my family more trying to get into college. But I don’t see the point right now. I thought moving to the US was going to be my fresh start the beginning of my life but I just dug myself a whole. I think a lot about the future. Whether it’s with J or not I can’t see it clearly. I still want that life we talked about with the farm and kids or all the different plans you told me. But I don’t think it’s going to happen at this point. Too many people were involved with our break up and he got a taste of freedom and I don’t think he wants to go back to us. No commitment. No spending money on me. No arguing over stupid stuff anymore. 

Now I won’t get to sleep hugging him and waking up next to him. I won’t get to kiss him goodbye I won’t be able to slap his butt randomly I don’t get to call him baby or tell him how much I love him because everything changed and it’s never going to be the same way ever again.

My name was picked out of a stack of applicants by the camera crew, who eventually told me that my unusual last name 'Brownjohn' was a factor in why they picked me — yet another occasion where having an unconventional name leads to interesting opportunities!

At the time I was half way through my first year studying a Bachelor of Creative Arts at Flinders Unversity. I flew back to my home town of Darwin where I got to enjoy all the wonder and stress that comes with working on a feature film set. For 2 weeks I worked from 4am until dark, running coffees for the camera crew and watching them do their incredible craft. For a young filmmaking enthusiast this was an absolute dream and I learnt heaps about how 35mm film cameras are loaded and the general running of a feature film set.

Highlights of my experience was sitting next to David Wenham at breakfast in the greenroom one morning; asking Hugh Jackman for an autograph only to realise that I'd asked his stunt double; and being invited by the Director of Photography Mandy Walker to follow the camera crew for the next leg of the production. I politely declined this amazing offer as I wanted to continue with my studies — but I often wonder what my life may have looked like had I accepted.",1,1754725588.0,filmmaking,0,1.0,False

I said the words that will make you hate me, and you did, you simpleton. I am aware, it’ll hurt you, but I know in the future you’ll hurt me too.
You are that butterflies in my stomach that I wanted to get rid off.
You place me behind, a reserve. When I always place you here, in my truth.

(Tw: never doing long fasts again, dirty bulking)","I 21f have been struggling with eating to pain and over sleeping these past 3 days. Normally I have no appetite, but idk something just snapped in me and I just started eating loads even when I wasn't hungry and eating more on top of that. It all started on Wednesday, and got worse from there but I'm done NOW... I swear I'm traveling in a few days I can't handle this shit... Fast forward to Friday, I didn't eat, Saturday I didn't eat either, Sunday I passed out in the morning... Then I was ok... No hunger at all... I felt ok... Idk maybe my body was still running off past glycogen/fat stores... My diets trash that's probably it... Then 10 pm hits I'm at work, I just randomly have an urge to swipe cake, after drinking an iced coffee (I didn't drink any water or anything that day either
... I have no hunger/thirst cues... I might be dying...) I eat 2-3 slices then I go down to the fridge to devour a donut like a gremlin... Which my coworkers are hours ago but I felt disgusted by... I'm feeling kinda nauseous and guilty but whatever life goes on... Next day I wake up in absolute pain... Stomach destroyed terrible... Fucking throwing up everywhere, hating my life feeling like I'm gonna die for fucks sake... It's a long weekend also, I have to spend time with my family they left me at home since they know Im a lazy fuck who hates going out during the day... I go outside feel a bit better, still kinda sick... Then I have to eat dinner with the FAM despite still feeling sick... I go and order what sounds good since I don't actually feel hunger since I barely fucking eat... I just eat so I won't die half the time... Oddly enough I never feel full either... I don't have an Ed since I hate being skinny I just don't wanna eat half the time... I enjoyed that night with my family and idk I didn't feel too shitty afterwards... Tuesday I forced myself to eat dinner at like 10 pm... Since ""I don't care... You're fucking eating"" is what I told myself... Wednesday, wtf I actually was craving some chocolate covered chips.... Nice I took advantage of that and ate... Then. I ate loads of other crap but felt full but kept eating, but idk I probably ate like close to 3k in the span of 2 hours and felt like crap... I distracted myself for a while, went on Reddit, watched tv whatever... Then dinner comes... I tried to delay it as long as I could but then went down stairs because yea (and my family expects me to eat dinner most the time anyways)... I go down with my laptop, playing my show I coulda skipped it if I wanted to uk, but as soon as yk, I'm putting a fucking naan bread in the oven grabbing rice on my plate... And holy fuck I start shovelling my fave with more food as I'm watching tv, not even caring about how full I feel. I'm stuffing my face to the point where I can't breathe I'm eating food I didn't even want in the first place, chewing and spitting it out, then eating it again like some gremlin... Idk I thought I was full... But then I went back down grabbed a bag of mini ricke cakes, ate it all and started shoving my face with popcorn even though I wasn't hungry... Weird... Next day I woke up, and fucking made myself eat an ENTIRE large bowl of popcorn and some chocolate pastry roll for lunch... This kept me full for hours so I didn't really wanna eat after that but of dinner time comes... Entire family's at home, my mom was making pasat so I had to eat it... I devoured the plate, felt painfully full, but after a few hours my stomach started growling and I went to sleep... Then yea today I wake up for a bit play a game, decide not to eat but idk I just end up going down for lunch anyways since I'm bored, I had 2 slices of bread, felt satisfied, but idk where was just 1 small piece of bread remaining in the pack so I ate that too, then I grab the bowl of popcorn again, deciding just to have a regular sized amount but I grab more and more, then next thing you know I'm eating more junk, feeling a high and all that... Then after I stop go upstairs but yea I feel sick after a few hours and end up fucking spitting it back out like a cow... (Rumination syndrome... It's a real thing) For like an hour or so since my body's fucked and I can't digest food anymore... Hours pass I try drinking water but I'm regurgitating that back up too... I have to eat dinner despite feeling nauseous, drank some Pepsi Max which I couldn't keep down, my brothers complaint he didn't eat all day... Super triggering... I eat my food feeling nauseous between bites but forcing it down since the meal was expensive... (Me and my brother both tend to force food down and eat loads even when we aren't hungry, since we're both naturally slim, struggle to put on weight and grew up with the 'finish everything on your plate mentality'). My poor brothers just dissociated struggling with his meal... My dad complaining that he's eating too fast when hes eating super slow then I eat the bread that came with the meal since it was there... I felt full and nauseous but weirdly enough the bread helped it... Then I chug my soda and feel amazing..n I told my brother I'm tryna bulk but idk if I should and stuff but he told me that most people eat until they're uncomfortably full which seems odd to me... Disordered eating runs in my family I guess... My mom also stuffs her face to the point of sick sometimes and is nowhere near overweight, and my dad eats for pleasure as well and isn't overweight either... I used to emotionally eat as a teenager but stopped once I almost became overweight and started developing problems because of it... But I've kinda struggled with weight my whole life (as in putting on weight, unless I'm eating til I'm in physical pain... The only times I've been able to maintain a BMI in the ""healthy weight range"" I've had to force feed myself loads)... Chat GPT actually assured me that my average intake for the past few days was actually in the normal range despite me feeling completely stuffed to the point of sick but yea... I don't know how to go about this... I struggle with eating and just eat for the dopamine/pleasure and I'm not even aware of the amounts I eat when I do eat or how it's gonna make me feel afterwards... My aunt suggested I try to eat a little bit here and there instead of eating a ton of random crap and not eating for like another 10 hours after that (which is how I naturally eat but idk what to do)... I tried that but failed... I actually had to go to the hospital 2 years back since I nearly gave myself refeeding syndrome and randomly started throwing up/shaking with chills/couldn't breathe and I thought I was gonna die(apparently it was a stomach bug and I was ok, but my labs were wonky... )The doctor's advice was ""eat more""... I was struggling with binge eating a lot back then but I never got taken seriously since I was super skinny... Even now... Everyone asks me if I eat or tells me I need to eat but I eat quite a lot at times...  I just don't have the cues that tell me when I'm hungry and when I should stop eating... And with hydration I have the same problem... I'm either chronically dehydrated but can't bring myself to drink water... Or I'm fucking chugging down way too many fluids and still feeling dehydrated... It's bad...",1,1754725430.0,confessions,0,1.0,False

Let’s address the main thing everyone’s curious about first — latency and lag. At home, I have a 350 Mbps internet connection, and my PlayStation Pro is hard-wired via RJ45. In that setup, I can confidently say I’ve experienced zero lag. Seriously, not even once. The picture quality remains sharp, the frame rate is smooth, and there’s no stuttering whatsoever when I’m playing within my home network. It honestly feels just like gaming directly on the console. However, the story changes completely once I take it outside. At my office, where multiple devices are constantly using the internet, the experience becomes almost unbearable. We’re talking full-on frame skips, heavy lag, random stutters — the works. It’s a night-and-day difference compared to home. I haven’t yet tested it at my friend’s house, who also has a 350 Mbps connection, but I’m curious to see if a clean, fast connection outside my home network will still give me that flawless experience. As for testing it in public spots like malls, McDonald’s, KFC, or coffee shops — honestly, I don’t think there’s much point, given how shared and unstable those networks are. On the hardware side, the battery life is decent but not amazing — I usually get around 2.5 hours from 80% down to 30% on full brightness. The screen itself is definitely a highlight: crisp, vibrant, and just pleasant to look at during long sessions.

“Thank you for attending Mildred’s memorial service, here’s a little goodie bag with tissues, mints, and a commemorative fridge magnet of her smiling in 1983.”

Like… was there a secret “Funeral Hostess 101” course I missed? Did Emily Post just skip that chapter in the etiquette book? Because I have buried parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles… not once did anyone hand me a bag at the end and say, “Thanks for coming, don’t forget your parting gift!”

I’ve been over here stressing about flowers, programs, and whether the potato salad has enough paprika — meanwhile, apparently, I should have been ordering 18 matching black-and-lily-printed bags so guests can leave with a thoughtful memento of grief.

It could also be episodes where you skip past more than half, only watching certain scenes that are still funny even if the rest bothers you.

For me, socially, I was a lot like Leonard in my college days into my mid 20s, so there are a few that hit home for me from having been hurt by girls in those days. A few other episodes simply anger or annoy me so much for other reasons that I just have to skip past them.

* All episodes with Kurt, except the Halloween one because he kinda' gets his comeuppance there.
* Underhill - I will only youtube the scene with Sheldon's gift because I despise the rest of that episode more than any other. I really wish that last scene could have been part of a different episode.
* Any scene with Penny making out with a guy in front of Leonard, including Zack, and the loser Mike from Season 2. (This does not apply to her and Sheldon kissing in Leonard's dream - THAT scene is hilarious!)
* Both episodes where Stuart insists on dating Penny even though he knew Leonard was interested in her.
* Bitcoin - Sheldon never angered me as much as he did in that one for the money he cost his friends.
* The Bowling episode - Wil Wheaton at his absolute lowest! I felt for Leonard big time in that one, as well as the aforementioned Christmas gift episode.
* Any scene with Raj and Dr. Emily - that pairing was so forced, it is painful to watch them together. Emily should have been too smart to even consider Raj after that stunt he pulled trying to talk like some ""smooth gangsta'"" in the coffee shop.
* A certain episode the writers admitted they should never have created involving Raj & Penny.
* Two scenes in otherwise funny episodes that I absolutely have to avert my eyes from: Raj & Howard's kiss, and Leonard wearing the orange nightie to prove a point to Penny. Absolutely frightening!!
* And while I still can watch it to an extent, the Hadron Collider episode gets to me. My first love was from Switzerland, and the last time we were together was when I went there years ago, so that episode really hurts me at times, especially Leonard talking about all of those romantic plans for Valentine's Day.

The New York Mets, currently riding a four-game losing streak and batting like a group of interns asked to solve quantum physics, will face the Milwaukee Brewers, baseball’s version of a well-oiled Swiss watch (70-44, best record in MLB). Let’s break this down with the precision of a stathead who’s *finally* found their coffee.

---

### Parse the Odds: Implied Probabilities & Why They Matter

The moneyline odds favor the Brewers at **-150** (implied probability: **60%**) and the Mets at **+160** (38%). That’s a 21.5% gap, which in baseball terms is about the difference between a team and a team that forgot how to swing a bat. The Brewers’ dominance as favorites (67.2% win rate) suggests they’re the financial equivalent of a 401(k) that never misses a market peak. The Mets? They’re the “set-it-and-forget-it” investment that’s now buying you a used couch.

The totals line is set at **9.0 runs**, with even odds on Over/Under. Given the Brewers’ 16-homer surge in their last 10 games and the Mets’ anemic .204 team batting average, this feels like betting on whether a popcorn machine will pop more kernels than a toddler’s temper tantrum.

### Digest the News: Recent Trends & Key Players

**Milwaukee Brewers**:

* **Offense**: They’ve averaged **4.1 extra-base hits per game** recently, including 16 home runs. Andrew Vaughn’s been a one-man wrecking crew with 4 HRs and 15 RBIs in 10 games. Think of him as the team’s emotional support pumpkin.
* **Pitching**: Brandon Woodruff (3-0) takes the mound, armed with a 3.12 ERA. His fastball? It’s faster than a Wisconsin snowplow in a blizzard.
* **Team Health**: No major injuries to report. Christian Yelich (21 HRs) is as healthy as a cheeseburger at a heart-attack convention.

**New York Mets**:

**Parse the Odds: The Math of Desperation**  
The Cleveland Guardians (-138) are the sensible pick here, with implied odds of 58.3% to win. The Chicago White Sox (+216) offer the thrill of a long shot, implying just a 32.4% chance. While the Guardians’ offense isn’t exactly lighting up the scoreboard (26th in MLB at 3.9 runs/game), they’ve scored 9 runs in their last game and have a four-game winning streak. The White Sox? They’re the poster child for “Why We Can’t Have Nice Things,” with a 27th-ranked offense (3.8 runs/game) and a five-game losing streak. The totals line sits at 8.5 runs, which feels like asking a pair of exhausted zombies to sprint—a literal low bar.

The Guardians are riding high, thanks to Carlos Santana’s four RBI and rookie C.J. Kayfus, who’s doubling like he’s in a TikTok tutorial. Kayfus’ two doubles in his sixth MLB game? A rookie’s “I’m here, I’m learning, and I’m stealing your bases” moment. Manager’s quotes are mysteriously absent, but based on the team’s play, he’s probably just saying, “Nice job, everyone. Let’s keep roasting the White Sox.”

The White Sox, meanwhile, are a team trapped in a time loop. Their offense has the consistency of a cafeteria coffee machine—present but unreliable. Luis Robert and Andrew Benintendi have the weight of a franchise on their shoulders, which is unfair because even Superman needs a day off. Starter Sean Burke (4.23 ERA) will take the mound, though “ ERA” might as well stand for “Everyone’s Relatives Are Here” at this point.

Her chest rose and fell slowly, her skin gleaming with a thin sheen of sweat. She was, to put it simply, exhausted.

Her labor had been long, dragged out by several false starts and spasming fits. That, along with the discovery of a strange mass that prevented a Caesarian Section, led to her spending 5 days in labor, each hour an exercise in sheer determination as she fought to prepare herself.

And then her water actually broke.

In an instant, Inko's entire body was aflame with agony, each nerve white hot and screaming. Then the contractions began in earnest. Each spasm, each clenched motion of her core filled her with hope and fear. She knew the Doctors hadn't been entirely honest with her. She didn't blame them either, but she knew that something wasn't right. 

And soon, with each throbbing contraction, each gentle affirmation from the Doctors around her, Inko's strained mind found, and subsequently latched onto the worst possible idea.

“I'm killing him.”

Her words were quiet, barely whispered through teeth clenched so tight it was a miracle they hadn't cracked, yet they rang through her mind all the same.

‘Dear God… I'm killing my baby boy!’

The Delivery itself was, by comparison, a mercifully short 7 hours, each moment of which felt like a century to the pale, haggard woman who now held her beautiful child's lifeless form in her arms. The nurses had tried several times to separate the small, sickly form from her, but after Inko nearly bit one of them, it was decided they would wait until she was asleep and…. Take care of the poor woman's misshapen child.

But sleep would not come to her. The clock on her wall ticked steadily, a metronome for her weary heart. Her eyes, red-rimmed and swollen, swam with the barest remnants of her tears as, far from the first time that night, Inko began to pray.

“Please…. Please God, help my son… Let him live! I can't lose him. I can't! Please… Let my son live.”

As Inko's eyelids grew heavy and slowly closed, through the shimmering wall of unshed tears, she saw a small glowing mote of Golden Light dancing on the air as it grew closer. Church bells, though she couldn't remember where she first heard them to know, rang softly in her ears as a soft, gentle warmth flowed over her body like water, soothing the aches and pains.


Tanaka Aiko sighed as she sipped from the small cup of coffee she had snagged on her way up. Technically, she wasn't actually scheduled to work for another 4 hours, on top of the extra 3 her boss had given her. She just couldn't bring herself to rest just yet. Glancing as she passed, her heart clenched when she saw the reason for her early return: Midoriya Inko's name tag. The poor woman had struggled so much to give birth, and then again to keep him even when everyone had believed the child to be unsaveable. Aiko didn't even care that Mrs. Midoriya had nearly bit her. She was a mother too, after all.

A sudden scream tore the nurses from her musings as she bolted towards the source with a heart like lead: Midoriya's room. 

Crossing the threshold quickly, she glanced around the room in fast, jerking sweeps of her eyes only to stop when they fell upon her patient. 

Her cup fell from limp fingers, spilling the coffee inside without a care. Her knees bucked, and she suddenly found herself on the floor, staring up at an impossibility, at a miracle.

Inko Midoriya stared down in blissful, uncaring euphoria at the beautifully gleaming, beautifully alive eyes of her son. He, in turn, stared up at her, his eyes a pair of shining jade beads marked only by his pupils, which themselves were pits of softly gleaming gold, like old coals only awaiting air. 

Izuku laughed up at her, smiling sweetly and with such joy that Inko couldn't help but join her precious baby boy, her vision growing watery and blurred as her laughter quickly descends into relieved weeping as she once more held her child close, careful not to hurt him while still pressing him closer to her.


Inko Midoriya smiled as she watched her four year old son play, She had noticed herself doing that a lot recently, remembering how strangely slow, yet simultaneously quickly, the years seemed to pass. 

She remembered the nurse, Tanaka, if she remembered correctly, had eventually gotten up and gotten the doctor, even physically dragging him behind her. It had taken the doctor nearly half an hour to negotiate with Inko, getting her to allow them to run a few simple tests on Izuku. Normally they would be standard, but due to how extreme her son's previous state was, combined with his mother's iron grip on the boy, prevented them from doing anything other than a remote scan by a Quirked-Licensed Specialist.

The report was, in Doctor Kato Isamu's opinion, sickening. Despite Inko's dogged avoidance of even  the slightest danger to her child, Despite her family's medical history being spotless, aside from the odd Quirk related ailment, her son was somehow born 4 months early, nearly deaf and with weakened bones, ligament and muscles, had the boy survived the week with his heart the way it was, he would likely be effectively paralyzed.

And yet… Izuku was fine. When they returned from the tests, Izuku softly sleeping in the arms of a large Panda Heteromorph, Doctor Kato began to quietly read through the seemingly normal, unremarkable even, beige folder. From his expression, though, Inko could see it might as well be a signed copy of the Bible.

“Mrs. Midoriya…. Please be honest with me. Were you involved with any kind of genetic experimentation?” 

Doctor Kato's voice was soft. As if he wasn't sure of what to say. Inko, equally confused, shook her head. 

“Not that I remember.”

“Your family then? Do any of your relatives have Regenerative or Restorative Quirks?”

Again, Inko shook her head and then tilted it when the doctor suddenly sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose and sitting heavily into the chair beside her bed.

“Then I have absolutely no idea how Izuku is still alive, much less healed.” He took a moment to look at the infant sleeping soundly in his mother's arms. Taking a breath, he opened the folder and pulled out two pieces of film. 

“First and foremost, your son's skeletal and muscle development has not only reached healthy levels. It's even gone beyond that. Not dangerously!” He added quickly upon seeing panic in her eyes. “It's more like… like he's been exercising and taking supplements for years. But that's not all.”

He held out the second piece of film, on it were a series of diagrams of strange organs and oddly enough, redundant organs.

“As you can see here, your son has what appears to be a second, smaller heart beneath his first. From what little testing we've been able to do, it doesn't seem to be dangerous. If anything, it's helping him.” 

Then, he pointed to a small grey tube sat by his lungs.

“So's this one. Our specialist says it's kind of like an internal oxygen scrubber. That, along with a few other new organs, led to this.” The doctor pulled a glass vial of pale, pinkish liquid and held it up to the light.

“Your son's blood. We looked at it under a microscope and… I wouldn't believe it if I wasn't the one to see it, but it seems like his blood was altered in some way that allowed it to carry oxygen much more efficiently, as well as clot much quicker.” 

The doctor stopped when Izuku yawned before rolling over a little and shifting the blanket he was wrapped in, revealing…

“And then we have… The Light. Obviously, it's light, but oddly enough, it doesn't give off any heat or radiation. It's like it's more the concept of light. It doesn't seem to flicker or fade, but it does seem to… pulse in time with his own.”

And with that, he began several months of study and two years of monitoring after that, during which Izuku quickly grew to become a very bright, perceptive, and most of all kind child. When he got to preschool, he would often seek out and befriend the kids he thought were lonely or were being picked on. This kindness continued even after he was diagnosed, on grounds Inko still found hard to believe, as Quirkless. 

Though, that's not to say Izuku didn't change. He had always been a very imaginative child, telling stories from the time he could talk, and yet it was here Inko noticed his stories beoming… coherent. Concerningly so.

Stories of a gigantic man in golden armor and a voice like thunder. This ‘Golden Man’ as Izuku called him supposedly lived inside of his Light and often helped Izuku when she couldn't do so herself. He often told Izuku stories of his sons and their own sons, of his friends Oll and Mal, or would try to teach him things when Izuku asked.

As time passed, Izuku's interests began to grow, first to drawing and later to painting, a hobby he would have all the way up until he was involved in a certain Villain incident. Where he met a certain hero, who he managed to both impress and prove wrong. Ten moths pass, Izuku had somehow managed to split his time between school, his newfound Teacher's lessons, including the history of the Quirk he was working towards and how best to use it, and a large project he had started at the beginning of the year.

It was only when Inko had seen her son off to the UA Entrance Exam and took a few minutes to collect herself that Inko remembered that Izuku had said it was ready. Pulling back the blanket that covered the wall sized canvas, Inko gasped as she took in the fruits of her son's labor.

A Palace. It was a palace. One painted with such painstaking detail rendered in the most vibrant golden hues that, had Inko not thought herself utterly unworthy, she was quite certain she could reach out and touch it. Giant figures stood guard upon a staircase, Their baroque golden armor so intricately enlaid with gems and engravings it made her eyes water. But it was the figure in the center that drew her attention like a black hole drew light. 

An impact behind her tore her eyes from the painting. Looking down, a small Thirteen bobble head stared up at her, laying on its side. 

Tracing the bobblehead's trail, her eyes widened. Her gaze flicked back and forth between the painting….

And the Golden Giant that seemed to have just stepped out of it. Golden Armor adorned with beautifully gleaming gems and stunning engravings. His hair is a waterfall of ebony locks held in place by a comparatively simple golden laurel. But what struck Inko the most were His eyes. She had seen them before. Every day she looked at her baby boy she saw them. Molten pits of smoldering gold, like embers merely awaiting fuel and air.

Trembling, Inko whispered a name. One Izuku had told her late one night after another of the Golden Man's stories. It took a surprising amount of negotiation and promises to ‘Keep it a secret,' but he told her.’ It was one she had grown to regard fondly as her son's seemingly imaginary friend.

“..... Neoth?”

1mlj9ul,https://i.redd.it/hhrjd8s02yhf1.png,Help a helpless romantic,"Hello, 

Almost an year ago I felt a strong masculine energy in my home. I started doing different spiritual practices to find out what is happening. Doing different sessions I found out that I will be in a relationship with a good man and what I felt was his energy, at that time I didn't know him. 

In January I first met him, during a period of 3 month he was chasing me, but I was running from him because he seemed to perfect for me and I had a lot of work to do on myself. I even run from him when he was trying to say hello. 

After three months I was not sure if he is the man whose energy I felt at home, and lots of other men were pursuing me. I didn't reject him but I still was running from him. 

At beginning of July the universe changed an important aspect of my life and I broke from my shell. I was not scared anymore of receiving love, being loved as imperfect as I thought myself to be for him and I was sure that he was the man whose energy I felt. 

I created an event at work for celebrating my birthday, because I met him at work, but we don't work together, but in different departments. 

I invited him, and he was very happy. But one of my female colleague at work was preparing a present for me, a bracelet and a great flower bouquet. She ask a colleague guy to give me the bouquet, and this guy that I have the huge crush on was very bothered that a man colleague gave me the bouquet, basically my crush just eat something and left. I wrote to him on the chat to thank him for contributing to the present and he felt more relaxed and happy that I acknowledge that he contributed to the present. 

A couple of days have passed, one morning I was preparing myself coffee at the office when he entered the room and he was trying to flirt with me, but at the same time running from me. In the same day, he was walking aimlessly around my office and I was trying to get to talk to him, but he run away. 


I felt so bad because he run away from me, and I am spiraling since then. 


Is he emotionally unavailable? 
Is he having a girlfriend because I was running from him at the beginning and he entered a relationship meanwhile? 
Are there too many emotions and maybe my change in energy scared him? 

What should I do? 
What can you, professionals tell me about his emotional pattern and about him?

I know about myself that I have a strong energy, I try to hide it most of the times but when I gathered all the courage and I am certain about something, it's hard for me to hide it.

1mlj8e8,https://i.redd.it/li0sioph1yhf1.jpeg,I sampled a lot of PDMs.....this is what I think,"Having been only in the designer game for a while (intentionally), recently I've been wanting to pick up 2 niche fragrances(one for warm weather, one for cool weather / special occasions) from PDM and / or Creed. So over the past couple weeks I've ordered and tried small samples of several PDM scents. These are my first impressions just in case others were looking into them as well:

*(Please understand that these are just first impressions - not reviews bc I've only worn each one 2-4 times. Also, I'm being extremely critical on these due to the price tag. I genuinely like most of them but being hyper-critical is the only way I can justify the price tag and/or keep myself from buying all of them. So if I don't speak highly of your favorite PDM, please don't come for me. I don't doubt that it works wonders on you. I'm just giving my opinions for those interested:) )*

**Layton** \- The namesake of the brand, I just had to try this one. On my first wearing, the main thing about Layton that caught my attention was the blend. More than the scent itself, I fell in love with how well-balanced it is. Perfectly sweet, right amount of aromatics, tastefully spicy, a good dose of freshness, and a tad bit fruity. It was such a positive wearing experience. However, a few times, the mentholated opening strongly reminded me of Vicks Vapor Rub, turning me away for a couple minutes before being blown away by the mid and dry-down. Still working past that opening. Sometimes, I get it. Sometimes, I don't. Flawless mid and dry-down with good seasonal versatility but an unpredictable opening: 8.5/10

**Althair** \- Theoretically, I thought I'd love this one since I'm a sucker for warm, spicy, sweet gourmand fragrances. Bourbon vanilla, tonka, cinnamon, praline...that's right up my alley. I also love a lot of the ""this perfume reminds me of..."" scents on Fragrantica so I was excited to try it. Unfortunately, it just did not work for me. The opening was quite enjoyable but it dried down to a very heavy, dense, and syrupy fragrance with no lift to it. I thought the ambroxan would add some pop but it wore extremely cloying - not due to the sweetness but due to the heaviness, almost making me a bit nauseous. I've tried it four times so far and tried really hard to like it but it just hasn't worked out. I've almost hopped in the shower to scrub this one off. If this fragrance had a diffusive quality to it, it probably would've been one of my fav cold weather scents ever. Nice opening with a cloying dry-down: 6/10

**Herod** \- Consistently a very pleasant wearing experience. A really appealing smoky, sweet, and spicy opening that dries down to a warm, vanillic, woody tobacco fragrance. I thought it might be too abrasive but the sweetness helps smooth out any rough edges. Similar to Layton, very well-balanced and pleasant to wear. Off memory, it is quite reminiscent of Tobacco Vanille without nearly as much of a spiciness or that ""dried fruits"" smell off the top. I would love to pick up Herod but for the price, I'm convincing myself that it scratches a similar itch as Spicebomb Extreme (which I also love). Also worth mentioning that the longevity isn't as great as I expected. A fantastic cold weather tobacco scent but similar options available for cheaper - 8.5/10

**Carlisle** \- One of those scents that I can appreciate the perfumery and artistry behind but just can't get myself to purchase due to lack of usability. I'm quite young and I don't find myself in situations that demand a scent like this nearly enough to justify purchasing a full bottle. This one screams black tie events, formal wear, night on the town, etc. Yeah, I spend 90% of my time in class, club meetings, coffee shops, or my apartment. I wouldn't wear this one to any of those places. Very dark, bold, resinous, and patchouli-heavy. I personally don't get apple at all. It also smells quite similar to Boss Bottled Absolu which is a more affordable option. Anyways, I enjoy the scent profile but it would spend 99% of its time sitting on my shelf collecting dust. Mysterious, dark, enticing, but not wearable for me: 6/10

**Oajan** \- Blown away from the first sniff. This is my favorite oriental / cold weather offering from the brand so far. I literally can not find any way to describe this other than a delicious spiced apple pie. I was super shocked to see that there's no apple in the official note breakdown but I pick it up so clearly. It smells edible, rich, opulent, cozy, attractive, and addictive. It very strongly reminded me of Angels' Share but if the booziness was replaced with more cinnamon. Cinnamon is a very prominent note in this fragrance but I do enjoy it a lot. Maybe stay away if you don't like warm spices. It's spicy, sweet, fruity, smooth, and rich without being heavy, obnoxious, or cloying in any sense. It smells like something that I can wear casually or for special occasions as well. I will probably pick up a bottle of this after I get through my decant. Edible, delicious, inviting, memorable, cozy, yet powerful - 10/10

**Sedley** \- Immediately reminded me of a fizzy lemon soda like Sprite or 7-Up. Super bright, fresh, and invigorating with a nice citrus + mint combo and enough sweetness to make it attention-grabbing. Loses some of that brisk quality as it dries but you're left with an attractive aromatic woody fragrance that still wears relatively light. A great dumb reach scent for the high heat that somehow presents itself as elevated and attractive. Not the most natural smelling thing in the world but the performance was quite good for how fresh it is. This one was the warm weather stand out for me. Fizzy, refreshing, woody and light - 9/10

**Percival** \- Very disappointed by this scent. It just felt like an uninspired blue fragrance. Nothing mind-blowing or attention grabbing about any part of this fragrance. It is quite pleasant but definitely does not justify that crazy price tag. It smells similar to Legend with florals replacing those fruity notes and not even a massive step up in quality. Admittedly, it does last a good amount of time but I'll stick to my Dylan Blue, BDC, ADG Parfum, etc. for a dumb reach blue fragrance. It might grow on me but a hard pass for now. Pleasant, smooth, and long lasting but extremely uninspired and subpar - 7/10

**Greenley** \- Was turned away by the opening the first time I sprayed this on. It had a sharp, photorealistic leafy smell that I assumed was the petitgrain. However, given more wearings, the opening has grown on me a bit and I don't find it as harsh. Oddly, I don't pick up on the green apple note in the opening much but it becomes more prominent as the fragrance dries down. Very surprising as it's a top note. Anyways, the dry-down is essentially a fruity, sweet, green, woody smell. It's super appealing but takes on a slight candied / syrupy facet, making the overall fragrance feel a little bit synthetic. This would not have bothered me at all if not for the price. I like Greenley a lot but I think a clone might do for the time being. A super appealing fruity, woody, green bomb with a slight candied edge - 8/10",9,1754723399.0,Colognes,1,1.0,False

[Living in downtown dubai](https://keyspacedubai.com/downtown-dubai-living/) offers more than just an address. It is about waking up in the middle of a vibrant city, surrounded by glittering towers, high-end shops, and some of the best places to visit in dubai. From stunning downtown views to world-class dining, this part of the city combines energy, style, and convenience in a way few other places can match.

Whether you are strolling past the Burj Khalifa in the morning or having dinner by the Dubai Fountain at night, every day feels like you are part of something special. For many residents, dubai downtown is not only a home but a lifestyle upgrade.

**Why Downtown Dubai Stands Out for Upscale Living**

When you live here, the best places to visit in dubai are often right outside your door. The Dubai Mall, Burj Park, and the Dubai Fountain are just a short walk away, so your weekends can be as simple as stepping outside to explore. Whether you enjoy high-end shopping, cultural shows, or peaceful parks, everything is within easy reach.

The layout of the neighborhood encourages walking, which means you can leave the car behind for most of your daily activities. In a city where driving is often the norm, this walkability sets downtown dubai apart from other districts.

**Upscale Residences and Smart Living**

Dubai downtown offers a variety of homes to fit different needs. You will find everything from stylish studios for busy professionals to spacious penthouses for those who want the ultimate in luxury. Buildings such as The Address Downtown, Act One Act Two, and Burj Vista set the standard for modern living. They often come with amenities like rooftop pools, private gyms, spas, and concierge services that make life more comfortable and convenient.

One of the standout features is the view. Many apartments are designed with floor-to-ceiling windows, giving residents sweeping downtown views both day and night. Imagine having your morning coffee while looking directly at the Burj Khalifa or watching the Dubai Fountain show from the comfort of your living room.

For those who work nearby or run their own businesses, living here means your commute could be just a short walk. This convenience is hard to beat, especially when compared to longer travel times from other areas of the city.

**Dining and Leisure All Around You**

If you are a food lover, downtown dubai restaurants offer more variety than almost anywhere else in the UAE. From high-end spots like At.mosphere on the 122nd floor of the Burj Khalifa to casual cafés tucked away in Souk Al Bahar, you can explore flavors from around the world without leaving your neighborhood.

Dining is not just about the food. Many downtown dubai restaurants give you front-row seats to the Dubai Fountain show or skyline views that make every meal feel like a special occasion. Weekend brunches, rooftop cocktails, and late-night desserts are all part of the dubai downtown experience.

Entertainment is just as abundant. Dubai Opera hosts concerts, musicals, and performances throughout the year, while art galleries and pop-up exhibitions keep the cultural scene fresh. You are never far from something new to see or do.

**A Real Community Vibe**

Despite being in the middle of a busy city, downtown dubai has a strong sense of community. It is common to see families enjoying the parks, pet owners walking along shaded paths, and groups of friends meeting for coffee in the same cafés week after week.

Events such as outdoor movie nights, seasonal markets, and cultural festivals bring residents together and make the neighborhood feel more personal. You will meet people from all over the world, yet it never feels like a place where you are just passing through. This balance of diversity and familiarity gives the area its unique charm.

**Value for Long-Term Investment**

From an investment perspective, property in dubai downtown continues to perform well. The combination of central location, modern infrastructure, and constant demand from both residents and tourists keeps the real estate market strong here.

Apartments and penthouses hold their value, and many investors find that rental returns are higher than in other areas of the city. This is especially true for units with unobstructed downtown views or direct access to major landmarks. Whether you plan to live here yourself or rent out your property, it is a decision that often pays off in the long term.

If you are considering buying or investing, Keyspace Realty offers tailored advice and property listings across the UAE, making the process easier and more efficient.

**Daily Life Made Easy**

Living in downtown dubai is designed to make everyday life smooth and stress-free. Grocery stores, pharmacies, clinics, and salons are all within a short walk. Many buildings have their own mini-markets and cafés, adding to the convenience.

For commuting, the metro station connects you to other parts of the city, and major highways are just minutes away. If you prefer not to drive, taxis and ride-hailing services are easy to find at any hour.

Many residential towers also offer services like valet parking, round-the-clock security, and on-site maintenance. These details may seem small, but they make a big difference in day-to-day comfort.

**Places to Enjoy and Explore**

One of the best places in dubai for both living and leisure, this area gives you quick access to culture, shopping, and entertainment. Dubai Opera is perfect for cultural nights out, while Souk Al Bahar offers a traditional shopping and dining experience. Art installations and seasonal attractions keep the surroundings visually engaging.

Even long-term residents often discover new cafés, hidden viewpoints, and fresh activities they had not noticed before. With its mix of luxury, convenience, and culture, downtown dubai restaurants and attractions ensure there is always something to enjoy.

**Why It Might Be the Right Choice for You**

If you want a home that puts you in the heart of the action, downtown dubai is hard to beat. Between the high-end residences, stunning views, and constant activity, the neighborhood offers an unmatched lifestyle. Whether you are enjoying a quiet morning coffee overlooking the city or an exciting night out with friends, you are never far from the best places in dubai.

For those ready to explore available homes, [Keyspace Dubai](https://keyspacedubai.com/) provides a curated selection of apartments and [properties for sale across the UAE](https://keyspacerealty.com/), including exclusive listings in dubai downtown.

Ensuring access to clean and safe drinking water is paramount,and a reliable water filtration system is a vital component in achieving that goal. Cuno, now a brand under 3M Purification, has built a reputation for producing high-quality water filters designed to remove contaminants and improve water quality.

[[Explore Top Rated cuno water filter on Amazon.]](https://sites.perfectshome.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=cuno water filter)

## Key Features Analysis

The Cuno water filter line boasts a range of features designed to provide effective and reliable water filtration. These features combine advanced technology and durable materials to deliver cleaner, safer water for various applications.

**advanced Filtration Technology**

Cuno water filters utilize advanced filtration technologies, including activated carbon, sediment filtration, and membrane filtration. activated carbon effectively removes chlorine, taste, odor, and other organic contaminants from the water. Sediment filters capture particulate matter like dirt, rust, and sand, extending the life of the carbon filter and improving the overall clarity of the water. Some models incorporate membrane filtration, such as reverse osmosis, for even finer filtration, targeting dissolved solids, heavy metals, and other microscopic impurities.

**High Flow Rates**

Many Cuno water filters are designed with high flow rates to meet the demands of busy households and commercial settings. This means you can dispense filtered water quickly and efficiently without experiencing a significant drop in water pressure. High flow rates are particularly important for applications such as filling pitchers, dispensing water from refrigerators, and supplying water to appliances like coffee machines and ice makers.

**Long Filter Life**

Cuno filters offer extended filter life, reducing the frequency of replacements and minimizing maintenance. The service life for a Cuno filter generally ranges from 6 months to 12 months, depending on the water quality and usage. The longer lifespan contributes to the cost-effectiveness of the filters over time and minimizes the inconvenience of frequent replacements.

**Sanitary Swift Change (SQC) Design**

many Cuno filters feature a sanitary quick change (SQC) design, which simplifies filter replacement and minimizes the risk of contamination. The SQC design allows for easy twist-in and twist-out filter replacement without the need for tools or special skills. The encapsulated filter design prevents contact with the filter media during replacement, maintaining hygienic conditions and ensuring high water quality.

**NSF Certification**

Many Cuno water filters are NSF certified, verifying that they meet stringent standards for water quality and safety. NSF certification indicates that the filters have been tested and proven to reduce specific contaminants to acceptable levels. This certification provides assurance to consumers that the filters are effective and reliable in providing clean and safe drinking water.

**Durable Construction**

Cuno water filters are constructed from high-quality materials designed to withstand the rigors of continuous use. The filter housings are typically made from durable plastics that are resistant to pressure and temperature fluctuations.The internal components are also designed for long-term reliability and efficient filtration.

## Core Benefits

Choosing a Cuno water filter offers numerous benefits for both residential and commercial users. Access to clean, filtered water improves health, enhances appliance performance, and provides cost savings over bottled water.

**Improved Water Quality**

cuno water filters significantly improve water quality by removing a wide range of contaminants. This includes chlorine, sediment, lead, mercury, and other harmful substances that can affect taste, odor, and health. By reducing these contaminants, Cuno filters provide cleaner, safer, and better-tasting water for drinking, cooking, and other household uses.

**Enhanced Appliance Performance**

Filtered water protects appliances from scale buildup and corrosion. Mineral deposits in hard water can damage components of appliances like coffee makers, ice machines, and water heaters, reducing their efficiency and lifespan. By using Cuno filtered water, you can extend the life of your appliances and maintain their optimal performance.

**Cost Savings**

Investing in a Cuno water filter can result in considerable cost savings compared to purchasing bottled water. Over time, the cost of bottled water can add up significantly, especially for households with multiple members. A Cuno filter provides a continuous supply of filtered water at a fraction of the cost,making it a more economical and environmentally pleasant option.

**Convenience**

That evening, I accidentally overheard him on the phone, making a solemn pledge:""I won't touch her again. I've sent you the account passwords, and you can log in anytime to check.""""I've made up my mind to stay loyal for love.""Watching his earnest, flushed face, I quietly fed the diagnosis letter into the shredder.Stay loyal for love...Well, then, let it be for a lifetime.Seeing ""ALS"" on Kelvin's diagnosis nearly knocked me off balance. Three months ago, when Kelvin slipped during a hiking trip in the Alps and ended up in the hospital, I asked the doctors for a full check-up, just to be sure. I never imagined this result.""Right now, there's no cure for ALS. We can only prescribe medication to slow it down, but the eventual outcome can't be changed.""The doctor looked at me with a sympathetic gaze.Kelvin, in his early thirties, is handsome, vibrant, and successful. As a well-regarded divorce lawyer, he is sharp, decisive, and rational—a top-tier professional. His personal life is simple and well-organized; he loves fitness and hiking, prioritizing a high standard of living.The thought of someone like him becoming dependent and facing the challenges of an ALS patient was too overwhelming.Sitting by the roadside, watching the constant flow of people, I finally stood up after a long pause.I had made up my mind. As partners, we should face everything together. No matter what he becomes, I will stand by him with our son.When I got home, night had set in.Emery was quietly playing chess in his room. At seven, he was already quite skilled, having been interviewed by television as a ""prodigy.""""Have you eaten?"" I asked softly, masking my emotions.""Yes, Aunt Maliyah made some pulled pork."" He didn’t look up, his focus on the board.""And Dad?""""He went for a run.""Emery, like us, was composed and straightforward in his speech.Two hours later, as I leaned against the bed, I debated whether to tell Kelvin about the diagnosis when he returned. Dressed in black workout clothes, he seemed fit and energetic.I couldn't help but worry. ""It's freezing outside. Why are you wearing so little?""Today's doctor's advice included a caution that ALS patients should avoid cold to slow muscle deterioration.Kelvin, unemotional, replied coolly, ""That's how I run.""He opened a box he brought in and began setting up a camera on the dresser facing the bed.I was confused.""Why install a camera all of a sudden?""""There have been break-ins nearby. It's safer with surveillance.""""Aren't you worried about privacy?"" I asked cautiously, aware of how much Kelvin valued his privacy.He glanced at me and scoffed, ""Privacy? Who's interested in watching your privacy?""A surge of emotions ran through me, and I refrained from debating further.Before sleep, he lay down with his back to me, keeping his distance and exuding an air of exhaustion and disinterest in conversation.I sighed gently.He had just concluded a high-profile celebrity divorce case and probably needed to unwind, so I let it [slide.In](http://slide.In) the middle of the night, anxious thoughts pulled me from sleep. The bed was empty; Kelvin was gone.Panic surged through me as I got up to find him.On the balcony, he was on the phone, wearing only thin sleepwear in the chilly night air.Hurriedly, I grabbed a coat and approached.""I won't touch her again...""His whispered words halted my steps.""I've sent you the password and account details. You can check anytime.""""I've decided to stay loyal for love.""Through the glass, I stared at Kelvin.Intense emotions were breaking through his usual indifferent face.Watching his fervent, flushed face, my mind slowly processed the logic behind his words.For a moment, I felt like I no longer recognized him.

  
Chapter 2Kelvin Richards harbored an insatiable craving for intimacy. By day, he was the picture of discipline and restraint, but come nightfall, his desires surged powerfully. Over recent years, the mounting pressures had taken their toll, forcing him to maintain a meticulous and flawless facade, which only deepened his isolation. It was in those quiet, vulnerable moments at night, as he whispered fervently into my ear, that I glimpsed the shy young man who once blushed at the mere sight of me.We had been classmates in our master’s program, and it was he who had pursued me. Despite his usually detached demeanor, his gaze was piercing and his voice quivered in my presence, quickly winning me over. I stayed on at the university to become a psychology professor, while Kelvin climbed the legal ladder from a salaried lawyer to a partner and a nationally acclaimed divorce attorney, raking in millions each year.Our personalities mirrored each other’s—both of us were emotionally steady, logical, practical, and driven by the pursuit of a high-quality life. My career provided stability and respect, allowing me to balance work and family seamlessly. Meanwhile, Kelvin achieved remarkable success in his field. After eight years of marriage, we respected and supported each other’s growth, raising our prodigiously talented son, Emery, in our luxurious apartment. To the outside world, we were the envy of many—a picture-perfect family.But then, six months ago, things began to shift. Kelvin had a nightly running routine; he used to head out at 8 PM and return by 9, shower, and spend half an hour with the family. However, recently, he started leaving at 7 and wouldn’t return until 10, often too drained to do more than shower and collapse into bed, cutting our family time short.When I questioned the extended runs, he curtly replied, 'The case is stalling. I need the extra time to clear my head.' Knowing the mental strain could exceed physical exhaustion, I accepted his explanation.Soon after, his interest in intimacy waned. Assuming stress was affecting his health, I chose not to confront him directly, not wanting to bruise his ego, though I was quietly concerned. This worry prompted me to insist on a thorough medical checkup when he was hospitalized after a fall, urging him to rest and [recover.Now](http://recover.Now), lying in bed, eyes wide in the dark, staring at the ceiling, I realize things aren’t as I’d assumed. His earlier words and expressions felt alien, detached. Despite the day’s heavy blows, curiosity overpowered the expected sadness and anger.Who was she? What kind of woman could transform Kelvin, who had become the embodiment of icy rationality, into someone so unrecognizable?True to my nature, the next evening, I slipped some sleeping pills into his coffee.

1mlizi3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BooksPoint/comments/1mlizi3/after_my_miscarriage_he_married_his_mistress/,"After My Miscarriage, He Married His Mistress","""Mrs. Harrington, please sign here... and here."" The lawyer's voice was clinically detached as he slid the divorce papers across the polished mahogany table. His finger tapped impatiently at each yellow tab.I couldn't look at Sean. In the ten years we'd been married, I'd memorized every expression that crossed his face. Today, I couldn't bear to see which one he wore—contempt, perhaps, or worse, nothing at all.Instead, my gaze drifted to Natalie Benson, perched beside him like a bird of prey. Her red-lacquered nails rested possessively on his forearm, her diamond bracelet catching the light. My bracelet. The one Sean had given me on our fifth anniversary.""June."" Sean's voice finally broke the silence. Cold. Distant. A stranger's voice. ""The sooner you sign, the sooner we can all move on.""The lawyer cleared his throat. ""I should remind you, Mrs. Harrington, that should you choose not to sign today, Mr. Harrington is prepared to contest any custody arrangements for future children and—""""Future children?"" The words escaped me before I could stop them. My hand instinctively went to my abdomen, still tender from the loss. ""I just lost our baby.""Natalie's lips curled into a smile that never reached her eyes. ""Well, that simplifies things, doesn't it?""Sean didn't even flinch at her cruelty. He just stared at his watch, as if my grief were an inconvenience, a meeting running overtime.""Sign the papers, June,"" he said flatly. ""Or you'll leave with nothing.""My hands trembled as I picked up the pen. Each signature felt like another piece of myself being carved away. With the final stroke, ten years of marriage—of loving Sean, of building a life with him, of sacrificing everything I'd ever wanted—was reduced to a stack of legal documents.The drive back to our apartment—no, Sean's apartment now—was a blur of rain-slicked streets and blurry traffic lights. My chest felt hollow, as if something vital had been scooped out.When I reached the door, my key still worked. Small mercies.But inside, everything had changed.The closet in our bedroom stood open, emptied of my clothes. The bookshelves had been purged of my novels and textbooks. Even the photographs had been removed from their frames, leaving ghostly rectangles on the walls where our memories had once [hung.In](http://hung.In) the living room, cardboard boxes were stacked neatly, labeled in a handwriting I didn't recognize. ""June's Things."" ""Kitchen—June's."" ""Miscellaneous.""A note sat on the kitchen counter, Sean's precise handwriting unmistakable:\*June,The movers will collect these boxes tomorrow. You have until noon to vacate the premises. Your access to our joint accounts has been temporarily suspended pending the finalization of our divorce.—Sean\*No goodbye. No acknowledgment of our decade together. Just logistics.A soft knock at the door startled me. When I opened it, Mrs. Chen from across the hall stood there, her kind face creased with concern.""I saw the movers earlier,"" she said softly. ""They left these by the door."" She held out a pair of worn ballet flats—my favorite shoes for padding around the apartment on Sunday mornings.That night, I sat on the bathroom floor, the cool tiles pressing against my legs. The bottle of sleeping pills Sean had gotten prescribed for his insomnia sat in my palm. How many would it take? Would it hurt?""June?""The voice was so achingly familiar that for a moment, I thought I'd imagined it. But when I looked up, he was there in the doorway—Sean. Not the Sean who had sat across from me in that sterile law office, but Sean as he had been when we first met. Eighteen years old, with warm eyes that crinkled at the corners when he smiled. Hair slightly too long, falling across his forehead in that way that had made my heart stumble the first time I saw him.""Sean?"" My voice cracked.He knelt beside me, and when his hand touched mine, it was warm but somehow not quite solid—like touching sunlight through a window.""What are you doing?"" he asked gently, his eyes fixed on the pill bottle in my hand.

chapter-2Morning came with cruel persistence. I hadn't slept—not really. The pills remained uncapped beside me, a temptation I'd resisted only because of him. Because of young Sean, whose impossible presence had somehow anchored me through the darkest hours.I dragged myself to the bus stop, my belongings stuffed into a single suitcase. Mrs. Chen had offered her couch, but pride—the last thing I owned that Sean couldn't take—made me refuse.The bus lurched forward, and I clutched my phone, scrolling through credit card applications. Each rejection notification felt like another door slamming shut. \*Insufficient credit history. Application denied. Unable to verify income.\*'They're making a mistake,' came a soft voice beside me.I looked up to find young Sean sitting there, his eyes warm with concern. In the harsh morning light, he seemed more substantial than he had in the bathroom darkness, yet still somehow ethereal—like a photograph coming to life.'What are you?' I whispered, earning a concerned glance from an elderly woman across the aisle.He smiled that crooked smile I'd fallen for a lifetime ago. 'I'm here because you need me to be.'His hand covered mine as another rejection flashed across my screen. Though I couldn't truly feel his touch, something warm spread through my fingers. I bit my lip hard, fighting back tears that threatened to humiliate me further in this bus full of strangers.'You'll figure this out,' he said quietly. 'You always do.'The bus jolted to a stop, and when I looked again, the seat beside me was empty.---'You came!' Sarah Evans exclaimed, her surprise poorly concealed as she air-kissed my cheeks at the law firm's holiday party entrance. 'I wasn't sure if you'd... well, you know.'I smoothed down the borrowed dress—a castoff from Mrs. Chen's daughter. Too tight across the chest, too loose at the waist, but it was black and unremarkable. Perfect for disappearing.'I appreciate the invitation,' I lied, scanning the room for Sean. This was madness, coming here. But I needed to speak with him about the accounts. About the future. About anything that might give me closure.The party hummed with expensive conversation and tinkling crystal. I sipped champagne that tasted like ashes, nodding at former friends who suddenly found the appetizer table fascinating when they spotted me.David Miller, the managing partner, tapped his glass for attention. 'If I could have everyone's moment, please! We have something special to celebrate tonight.'The crowd parted, and there they were—Sean and Natalie, her arm possessively wound through his. She wore red, vibrant as a fresh wound against the sea of conservative black and navy suits.'To new beginnings,' David continued, raising his glass. 'And to the future Mr. and Mrs. Harrington!'The room erupted in applause. My champagne glass froze halfway to my lips.'And because a picture is worth a thousand words,' Natalie's voice cut through the congratulations, 'we've prepared a little slideshow of our journey.'The lights dimmed. The projector flickered to life on the wall behind them.And there I was—pale, hollow-eyed, curled in a hospital bed. The date stamp showed three days ago. My miscarriage. My private agony, projected six feet tall for everyone to see.'Oops,' Natalie giggled, feigning embarrassment as gasps rippled through the crowd. 'Wrong folder!'The room spun. Faces blurred into masks of horror and morbid fascination. I stumbled backward, knocking into a waiter, sending a tray of glasses crashing to the floor.The shattering sound broke whatever spell had frozen me in place. I fled.---'Sean!' I called out, my voice echoing in the parking garage beneath his firm the next morning. He was walking toward his car, briefcase in hand.He turned slowly, his face a perfect mask of indifference. 'June. You shouldn't be here.''The accounts,' I said, my breath forming small clouds in the December air. 'They're empty. All of them.''Yes.' No explanation. No apology.'How am I supposed to—''You should check your credit report,' he interrupted coolly. 'The mortgage, the car loans, your student debt—they're all in your name now.'The ground seemed to tilt beneath me. 'You can't do that.''It's already done.' He checked his watch. 'Anything else?'A sleek black limousine pulled up behind him, its tinted window rolling down to reveal Natalie's smirking face.'Sean,' I whispered, searching for any flicker of the man I'd married. 'Why?'He turned away without answering, sliding into the limo beside her. As they pulled away, I caught a final glimpse of Natalie's triumphant smile through the darkened glass.Standing alone in the cold garage, I realized with sudden clarity that the man I'd loved was truly gone. And in his place was someone I no longer recognized—someone capable of destroying me without a second thought.

chapter-3I stared at the ceiling of Chris's spare bedroom, watching the shadows from passing cars slide across the cracked plaster. The mattress smelled faintly of mothballs and something else—a lingering scent of my brother's military life, perhaps. After the parking garage confrontation with Sean, I'd had nowhere else to go. My credit cards were maxed out, my accounts emptied, and my name was now attached to debts I hadn't even known existed.""You can stay as long as you need,"" Chris had said when I showed up at his door, suitcase in hand, eyes swollen from crying. His apartment was small—a one-bedroom converted to two by adding a wall that didn't quite reach the ceiling—but it was clean and warm. Military precision evident in the perfectly made bed, the precisely aligned shoes by the door.I rolled onto my side, wincing at the hollow ache that still lingered in my abdomen. The physical reminder of everything I'd lost.""Hey, you up?"" Chris's voice came softly through the thin door. When I didn't answer, he pushed it open anyway, his wheelchair barely fitting through the narrow frame. ""Brought you something.""He wheeled over to the bed and handed me a battered leather journal. The cover was worn smooth at the corners, the pages yellowed with age.""What's this?"" I asked, running my fingers over the soft leather.""My therapist gave it to me when I came back from Afghanistan. Said writing down the next steps, no matter how small, helped make the impossible seem possible."" His eyes, so like mine, held no pity—just quiet understanding. ""Thought you might need it more than I do now.""I clutched the journal to my chest, tears threatening again. ""I don't know what the next steps even are, Chris.""He gestured to the wall behind me, where his service medals hung in a simple frame. ""When they first put me in this chair, I couldn't see past the next hour, let alone the next day. But you keep going. One step, then another.""He reached out and squeezed my hand. ""You'll rebuild, June. And I'll help you.""---The nonprofit where I'd worked before my marriage to Sean was housed in a converted Victorian in Capitol Hill. I'd spent three happy years there before leaving to support Sean's career move to New York. Now, back in Seattle with nothing but desperation, I hoped they might remember me fondly.""June Parker!"" Maria Sanchez exclaimed when I walked into her office. ""Or is it Harrington now?""""Parker,"" I said firmly. ""It's Parker again.""Maria's warm brown eyes softened with understanding. She'd been my supervisor years ago, and time had added silver to her dark hair but hadn't diminished her kind smile.""Well, Ms. Parker, your timing is impeccable. We just got funding for a new community outreach position. The pay isn't spectacular, but—""""I'll take it,"" I interrupted, then flushed. ""I mean, I'd like to apply. If that's possible.""She laughed. ""Let's start with an interview, at least. How's tomorrow?""I left feeling lighter than I had in weeks. The next day, I wore my only remaining professional outfit—a navy skirt suit I'd managed to grab before the movers came—and answered Maria's questions with growing confidence. By the end, her smile told me everything I needed to know.""We'll be in touch very soon,"" she promised, walking me to the door.Three days later, a terse email arrived:\*Dear Ms. Parker,\*\*Thank you for your interest in our Community Outreach Coordinator position. After careful consideration, we have decided to pursue other candidates whose qualifications better align with our current needs.\*\*We wish you the best in your future endeavors.\*I stared at my phone in disbelief. The interview had gone perfectly. Maria had all but offered me the job on the spot.Before I could stop myself, I was dialing her number.""June,"" Maria answered, her voice tight. ""I was hoping you'd call.""""What happened?"" I asked, struggling to keep my voice steady.A long pause. Then: ""I shouldn't be telling you this, but... Natalie Benson called our executive director yesterday. Sean's firm is our biggest donor, and she made it clear that if we hired you, they would withdraw their support.""The phone nearly slipped from my suddenly numb fingers. ""She did what?""""I'm so sorry, June. We can't lose that funding—we'd have to close our doors.""After we hung up, I sat on Chris's fire escape, watching the sun sink behind the Seattle skyline. The metal was cold through my thin pants, but I barely noticed. First my marriage, then my home, my financial security, and now even the chance to work—all systematically stripped away.""Beautiful, isn't it?""I turned to find young Sean sitting beside me, his legs dangling over the edge of the fire escape. In the fading light, he looked almost solid.""Do you remember our first date?"" he asked, his eyes reflecting the deepening twilight.""The coffee shop near campus,"" I whispered. ""You spilled your latte all over my economics textbook.""He smiled, and suddenly I wasn't on the fire escape anymore but sitting in that crowded university café, watching eighteen-year-old Sean frantically blot at my ruined book with napkins, his face flushed with embarrassment.""I'll buy you a new one,"" he was promising, his eyes—so warm then, so full of life—meeting mine across the table.The memory shifted, and we were dancing in the spring rain on the empty quad, my sundress plastered to my skin, his laughter echoing across the deserted campus.Then we were lying on a blanket in the darkness outside Madison, watching the Perseid meteor shower streak across the summer sky. ""Someday,"" he whispered, taking my hand, ""I'm going to give you the world, June Parker.""The memories faded, leaving me alone on the cold fire escape, tears streaming down my face. The contrast between those cherished moments and my current reality was almost too painful to bear.""Why are you showing me this?"" I asked the empty air where young Sean had been.But there was no answer, only the distant sound of traffic and the hollow ache of everything I'd lost.",1,1754722492.0,BooksPoint,0,1.0,False

Bought a LV Neverfull MM and a Celine from Emily, and honestly? Best decision since deciding coffee counts as breakfast.

The Contact: Emily was a delight to deal with – quick replies, friendly tone. Very helpful right from the start.

Shipping: Arrived a little later than expected, but only because of a local holiday. So technically, the bag was just having a mini vacation before moving in with me.

The Goods:
	•	Bag: My everyday office companion for several weeks now. Still looks fresh-out-of-the-box. Sturdy, beautiful, and somehow immune to my clumsy coffee moments.

## What is Stream Levora Cap?

Stream Levora Cap is an **automated trading platform** designed to help users capitalize on market fluctuations—especially in crypto, forex, and stock markets—without needing to manually monitor every tick of the chart.

It’s built for users who want to **automate their trading strategy**, whether you're a complete beginner or just someone who doesn’t want to be glued to screens all day. The software uses algorithms to analyze market trends in real time and place trades on your behalf.

Think of it like a smart assistant that knows how to trade (allegedly better than most humans). But don’t expect it to make you rich overnight. It’s more of a tool to help you trade smarter, not a magic money-printing machine.

## Who Created Stream Levora Cap?

Like most trading bots and platforms out there, the creators of Stream Levora Cap aren’t publicly known. That’s not necessarily a red flag—it’s actually pretty standard in this space. Platforms like Bitcoin Era and Immediate Edge also keep their developers behind the curtain.

What matters more is the **functionality, transparency, and user experience**, and based on my findings, Stream Levora Cap seems to check most of those boxes. It’s likely created by a team with a background in fintech and algorithmic trading, but until they decide to reveal themselves, we’re left with the product itself to judge.

## How Does Stream Levora Cap Work?

Stream Levora Cap operates through a **combination of AI-powered algorithms and real-time market data** to analyze patterns and execute trades automatically. Once you set your risk preferences, trading limits, and asset types, the platform takes over and starts executing trades on your behalf.

It’s not just a set-it-and-forget-it system, though. You still have the option to manually intervene, adjust settings, or stop trading at any time.

The platform partners with regulated brokers who execute the trades, and these brokers provide the actual trading interface behind the scenes. That’s a common setup in auto-trading platforms and helps ensure that trades are executed securely and legally.

## Stream Levora Cap Pros and Cons

Every platform has its highs and lows. Here's what stood out to me:

**Pros:**
- **Beginner-friendly interface** – no steep learning curve
- **Automated trading** – set your rules and let it run
- **Supports multiple assets** including crypto, stocks, and forex
- **Quick sign-up process** – no crazy paperwork or delays
- **Demo account** for practice without losing real money

**Cons:**
- **$250 minimum deposit** might be a bit steep for casual users
- **Lack of transparency** around the founders
- **No mobile app (yet)**, but mobile browser works fine

## Is Stream Levora Cap a Scam?

Short answer: **Doesn’t look like it.**

I tested both and got fairly quick responses. Nothing mind-blowing, but **better than the ghost-town experience** you get with some other platforms.

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Head over to the official website and fill in your name, email, and phone number. It takes like 2 minutes.

1mliwfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/PsycheOrSike/comments/1mliwfs/im_tired_of_some_shorter_men/,I’m tired of some shorter men.,"For context I am a 5’10 woman, and a lot of times when I’m on dating apps and match with a man shorter than me, and we end up meeting for coffee, a good portion of them are more mean to me. I have the feeling that the men feel emasculated and want to feel superior to me just because I’m tall. I’m also tired of some shorter men complaining about their height 24/7. Look I get it, taller women also get shit too because we get the “I like petite” women stuff. But why on earth as a taller woman would I want to date a shorter man who ALWAYS complains about being short. I already hate women who complain about being short, why would I want to date somebody constantly hating themselves. I LITERALLY MATCHED WITH YOU?? YOUR PROBLEM IS NOT YOUR HEIGHT. There are 3 types of short men. 1) the actual short kings who are confident and love women no matter their height. 2) the short man that wants to degrade taller women to feel superior. Or 3) pity me wahhhh I’m shorttttt. Please for the love of god stop. You are literally digging your own graves when you do that. Literally if you match with a taller woman TREAT HER LIKE A HUMAN BEING!!! And be nice, be confident, compliment her, she will compliment you back. This is coming from a place of annoyance but it’s also tough love. I WANT to see short kings succeed, but it sucks that when I try to give short kings a chance, they most of the time blow it because of their own insecurities. Either be freaking confident or stop matching with me on dating apps. ",12,1754722167.0,PsycheOrSike,107,0.7,False
1mliv8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1mliv8z/finding_joy_in_coffee_without_breaking_the_bank/,Finding Joy in Coffee Without Breaking the Bank: Lessons from a Past Hobby,"Over the last few months on this forum, I have noticed recurring questions about balancing the love for coffee with budget. It reminded me of my younger days in the early 2000s when cycling culture exploded in India. Back then, I was an enthusiastic bicyclist but financially limited. Based on that experience, 20 years ago, I wanted to share a few thoughts. I hope members find them useful and I welcome any comments and/or corrections! 

1. Specialty Coffee Isn’t Cheap:  Even discounting the equipment cost, the recurring costs add up. At a conservative estimate of 450Rs for 250g of beans, one may end up spending 1500Rs just on coffee beans. This can easily become 2000/month!

2. Good Quality Gear Isn't Cheap: Equipment from reputable brands costs more. While budget options exist, we need to be aware of the ""buy cheap, buy twice"" trap.

3. Community (and Avoiding FOMO): Like any hobby, specialty coffee attracts diverse set of people. Some coffee fans focus intensely on nice and sparkly equpment while some focus of the process: “My morning was ruined by a 5-second over-extraction!” or “I forgot to adjust my grinder; today’s coffee tastes like crap.” While passion is great, we need to remember that, perfection is the enemy of good, so don’t let perfectionism or gear envy overshadow your joy. 

**So, Now What?**

Many solutions and suggestion have been shared on this sub-reddit already. If I recollect ideas from my cycling days, here’s what helped me:  

- Start Loving ""Good enough for me, for now"": The chase for ""the best"" gear or ""the best beans"" is endless.
- Start Simple: South Indian filter coffee (robusta + chicory) is affordable, delicious, and requires only a ₹200 steel filter. It is a great starting point.
- Want Arabica? Try French Press: For long blacks, French presses are forgiving. No scale, kettle are needed, and grind size flexibility saves stress.
- Grinders Are Not An Immediate Must-Haves: Begin with freshly pre-ground coffee and use within 7-10 days (store in cool dark place). You can alway keep an eye for pre-owned manual grinder. In a space where many people are looking for an upgrade, it is easy to find good quality pre-owned equipment.
- Coffee Gifts: People who have coffee as a hobby are the best people to give gifts to. One can get a coffee related gift from 500 Rs to 500000 Rs. So letting people know that you like coffee will lead to getting related gifts

**Remember**: People have been drinking coffee for centuries, globally. There is no ""best coffee"". There are ""best coffees""! So drink what you like, the way you like it and with the equipment that you have.",15,1754722039.0,IndiaCoffee,7,0.9,False

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a preseason clash that’s less “Super Bowl” and more “two teams figuring out where the bathrooms are.” The Minnesota Vikings, led by rookie QB J.J. McCarthy (who’s still trying to forget his 2024 preseason was “underwhelming,” per the article), host the Houston Texans, who’ve brought in DeMeco Ryans to coach with the intensity of a man who’s *never* played in the NFL preseason. Let’s break this down with the precision of a spreadsheet and the humor of a dad joke.

---

### 1. Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game

The Vikings are the slight favorites (-3 spread) on most books, with decimal odds hovering around 1.59 for a straight win. That translates to an implied probability of \~63%—which is generous for a team starting a rookie QB who’s yet to throw a single regular-season pass. Meanwhile, the Texans (+3) sit at \~41% implied odds (2.45 decimal), suggesting bookmakers think they’re the underdog but not *that* underdog.

The total line? A modest 37.5-38.5 points, with “Under” slightly favored. That’s about 18.5-19 points per team, which feels low for an NFL game unless both offenses are channeling their inner *Tiger Woods on a short game*.

**Key stat to note**: The Vikings have dominated the Texans 6-0 in regular-season matchups, but preseason? That’s like comparing a Ferrari to a go-kart that’s had one cup of coffee. Preseason records mean less than a minicamp scrimmage, but McCarthy’s inexperience and the Texans’ aggressive coaching could tilt this.

### 2. News Digest: Injuries, Draft Hype, and Coaching Shenanigans

* **J.J. McCarthy**: The Vikings’ rookie QB is making his preseason debut after a meniscus injury last year. His 2024 preseason? “Underwhelming” is the polite term. Imagine a rookie QB trying to lead a team while also Googling “how to not throw an interception.” That’s McCarthy in a nutshell.
* **Jayden Higgins**: The Texans’ 2024 first-rounder (34th overall) is the star of their offense. He’s got the résumé of a man who once caught a 98-yard bomb in college, but now he’s facing a Vikings defense that’s probably still figuring out how to load the starting QB.
* **DeMeco Ryans**: This guy treats the preseason like a job interview. Expect him to play his starters “just enough to not get f

1mlisse,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mlisse,Modi's ready to risk it all for farmers. Farm reform can answer Trump with new Green Revolution,"The article argues that Donald Trump’s new 50% tariffs on Indian exports threaten millions in vulnerable sectors like basmati rice, spices, tea, coffee, textiles, jewellery, and especially farmers. PM Narendra Modi has framed this as a sovereignty fight, vowing to protect farming, fishing, and dairying communities “whatever the cost.”

Shekhar Gupta contends that standing up to the US rarely carries personal political risk in India—leaders from Indira Gandhi to Vajpayee often gained from it. But true political risk would be taking on deep agricultural reform, which Modi has avoided since withdrawing the farm bills.

The piece suggests using the tariff crisis as a trigger for a “new Green Revolution,” akin to Indira Gandhi’s acceptance of hybrid seeds in the 1960s and Vajpayee’s introduction of Bt cotton in 2002—both resisted initially but hugely boosted yields. Today, India’s crop yields for cotton, soybean, and corn lag far behind global leaders like China and Brazil due to GM-seed resistance, subsidy distortions, and reliance on imports for edible oils, pulses, and fertilisers.

Gupta calls for bold reforms:

Adopt GM seeds for key crops to raise productivity and competitiveness.

Shift from subsidies (currently 75% of the agriculture budget) to direct benefit transfers, as China does.

Reform fertiliser distribution, curb free electricity distortions, and tackle seed cartelisation.


He argues that while agriculture is only 16% of GDP, it involves over half of India’s voters, making reform politically dangerous. Yet this is precisely the moment for Modi to take that risk—turning Trump’s trade war into an opportunity for transformative farm policy.

Then around 7ish i had a decent sized cup of coffee. All was well until about 11:30pm/midnight. I started feeling so awful, chest tightness, shortness of breath and fatigue. My arm was tingly.

It’s now 2:40am, and the symptoms are kind of subsiding, but as soon as I get in bed (I’m sitting propped up) it makes it worse. This has happened to me before and I’ve survived, but it’s so awful. I even went to urgent care in the morning the last time it happened, and they were useless and told me I was fine (maybe I waited too long and the effects were finally about to wear off?).

## What is Zermixrent?

Zermixrent is an **automated trading platform** designed to simplify crypto and forex trading for everyday users. It uses algorithms and real-time data analysis to identify trade opportunities, execute trades, and (in theory) generate profits—even when you're not watching the markets.

The idea is simple: let the software do the heavy lifting. Whether you're brand-new or just don’t have time to monitor charts all day, Zermixrent claims to streamline the process and make trading more efficient. From what I’ve seen, it works similarly to other platforms like **Bitcoin Code** or **Immediate Edge**, but with some extra features that make it stand out.

## Who Created Zermixrent?

One of the things that makes people raise an eyebrow is the lack of detailed information about who founded Zermixrent. There’s no big-name CEO or flashy LinkedIn profiles floating around, which can be a red flag for some. But let’s be real—this is pretty common in the world of algorithmic trading platforms.

From what I can gather, Zermixrent was developed by a group of fintech engineers and traders who wanted to create a more **accessible** and **user-friendly** trading experience. While that sounds good on paper, I’d personally love to see more transparency from the team behind it. Knowing who's behind the curtain always adds an extra layer of trust.

## How Does Zermixrent Work?

Zermixrent uses **advanced algorithms** and **AI trading bots** to analyze current market conditions and execute trades on the user's behalf. You fund your account, set up your preferences, and the automated system takes it from there. It scans for profitable trades, jumps in when conditions are right, and exits when it's time to lock in gains (or cut losses).

This is especially helpful for people who don't have hours to sit in front of a screen analyzing candlestick patterns. The platform is designed to reduce emotional trading and improve consistency—two things that usually trip up beginners.

## Zermixrent Pros and Cons

Let’s get into the good, the bad, and the slightly annoying:

**Pros:**
- ✅ Automated trading with minimal user input
- ✅ Real-time market data and analysis
- ✅ Beginner-friendly interface
- ✅ Supports multiple asset classes
- ✅ Demo account available for practice
- ✅ 24/7 customer support

**Cons:**
- ❌ Not much info about the team behind it
- ❌ No dedicated mobile app (yet)
- ❌ $250 minimum deposit might be high for casual users
- ❌ Doesn’t offer full control for advanced traders

Honestly, the pros do outweigh the cons, especially if you’re just looking to get started or want to automate part of your trading.

Honestly, I don’t think so. While the anonymous team and flashy promises might feel sketchy at first glance, the platform itself works as advertised. I tested the demo, made a few trades, and even withdrew some funds—everything worked smoothly.

Deleting your account isn’t a one-click process. You’ll need to:
1. Contact customer support via email or live chat.
2. Request account deletion.
3. Withdraw any remaining funds before closing.

They may ask for ID verification to confirm the request. It’s a bit tedious, but it gets the job done.

1mlip65,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1mlip65/today_i_had_one_of_those_movielike_dreams/,Today I had one of those movie-like dreams,"Scene-1: A person is called in for research. As he's walking towards the lab, through a facility in the woods, he senses something. He looks to his right, and sure enough, there's a creature walking alongside him unlike anything he's ever seen. It's enormous, with huge muscular front legs and relatively smaller back legs – all ending in sharp claws, its black coat camouflaging it in the dark forest. There's a white, deer skull like object where its face should be. The animal, if it can even be called that, is like a hybrid between a human, a gorilla, a tiger, and a wolf. The person starts running, and the creature does the same. Sometimes it runs beside him, other times, it moves overhead. Eventually, it shatters the glass window that was separating them.

Scene-2: A student attends a party. It's a winter morning and they're on a rooftop. The sky is grey, with beautiful clouds drifting here and there. The clouds are hiding the sun and thus appearing to have golden outlines. The student is mesmerised. He brings out his phone to take a photo and accidentally opens the front camera. That's when he notices an ""x"" mark on his forehead. It confuses him.
By the end of the party, the student is found dead. He fell from the rooftop somehow. But how can that be? He was a cautious boy, never going too close to the edge. 
""What's that mark on his forehead?"" someone asks, but never receives an answer.  

Scene-3: I'm on a train – pacing about, sitting down, pacing again. My heart is in turmoil. The boy who died a week ago was my friend. And his mysterious death has haunted me since. 
How did he fall? He wasn't reckless, nor clumsy. Did someone push him? Who would do that? And what was that mark on his forehead? I don't have a clue, nor do the police. I sit down again in frustration. 
""Something bothering you, friend?"" a voice asks. I look up to see a tall, fair-skinned man towering over me. He's wearing a black sweater with a white shirt underneath, holding two coffee cups, smiling down at me. Before I can answer, he extends one arm towards me, offering a cup. Something about him makes me accept it. I start drinking, and he quietly observes, occasionally asking me a question or two.
I'm in a trance, just sipping coffee and answering his questions. Before I know it, I’m fast asleep. When I wake, the man is gone, my station still far away. As I start pacing again, I notice some people giving me strange looks. I wonder why… until my eyes drift toward a glass window.
There’s an ""x"" mark on my forehead. The same kind my friend had.

Scene-4: I'm panicking at the station. What does it mean? Am I going to die too?
I have this weird sensation – like being watched. I look around. Nothing. Probably just my mind playing tricks. Or is there really someone… watching, waiting? I have to get out of here. 
As I walk, the feeling walks with me. I think I catch glimpses of a black sweater. Black sweater? Is it that guy from the train? Is he the one following me? Did he draw this mark on my forehead? 
Someone grabs my hand. I panic and turn to see the man in the black sweater smiling at me. Something about that smile sends a shiver down my spine. I glance at his other hand – there's a knife. He notices my reaction and lunges, but I dodge just in time and sprint towards the exit.
Is he following? Will he really dare to kill me in public like this? I can't think, just run.

Scene-5: The killer has been chasing me everywhere. Not just chasing me, but killing others along the way. As if he's taunting me, toying with me as a cat toys with their prey. As if saying, “See how easy it is for me? I could kill you now if I wanted. But I'm choosing not to.” 
All his victims have the same ""x"" mark on their foreheads.

Scene-6: It's been 30 or so years. I'm now an old man living peacefully with my wife. The killer who haunted me years ago seemed to give up after a while. But those memories still give me chills to this day. 
As I’m taking a stroll with my wife one afternoon, she remarks how she’d love some ice cream right now. I agree, and we head to the local mall.
As we're returning from the ice cream store, still in the mall, I suddenly drop my ice cream and crouch down in pain. Something grows from my chest – the tip of a sword? My wife screams in horror. As I fall to the ground, my life leaving my body, the realization hits me.

The killer got me after all. All those years I lived in relative peace, thinking he finally gave up or got caught, he just waited patiently. 
Once he marks you, your fate is sealed. He never lets you go. Even if it's been decades, he'll come back, and strike when you least expect.",1,1754721400.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False
1mliol4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DadForAMinute/comments/1mliol4/dad_mil_died_from_cancer_and_i_dont_know_what_to/,"Dad, MIL died from cancer and I don't know what to do with FIL","Dad, 

I lost my MIL to cancer last year. 2 months from diagnosis to death. Extremely sudden and traumatic for everyone. She was the mom I never had. I don't want to get into it. I have a PTSD diagnosis from the hell my own family of origin put me through. I had what felt like a real family for 6 yaers.

FIL starts dating a few months after the fact. It's unreasonable for him to be alone. I'm not against any of that. DO NOT UNDERSTAND ME WRONG. Not at all, just his lack of communication and how he's going about things. Expecting one big happy family super quick so he can avoid his own grief, even when this lady looks at us like she doesn't like us. I have tried making conversation with her and she doesn't really answer. 

I have tried, despite my feelings to be supportive of him, to be the good daughter/DIL and to understand his position, went on here and saw posts of others going through the same damn thing - basically took that advice and tried to be understanding and supportive to my own detriment, because otherwise I was afraid we'd be labeled the ""difficult ungrateful spoiled brats."" 

 I'm not trying to be okay? it was hard enough losing the only woman who ever gave a shit about me. Many hate their MIL and don't get good ones. I had the jackpot for 6 years, for everyone else that failed me, I'd kill to have her back. I want my MIL back. I really tried to put that aside and tried for him, I didn't step back without lack of trying okay? I even tried to welcome both my stepparents with open arms, and with my stepmother doing that almost cost me my life. I have reason to be wary.

 I'm reliving everything all over again with what BOTH my abusive stepmother AND stepfather put me through and he seems oblivious. I'm 36, I'm too old to feel my inner child being wounded all over again and I DON'T have time for this. I was accepted into a really good college and have a chance to rebuild my life from the one my own family tried to deliberately destroy. I need to study and that's all I'm trying to do right now. It's a nice distraction ngl.

It's all sending me to a dark place and I haven't talked to him in over two months because I'm going through an episode. I told him I couldn't visit with her anymore because I need to get a handle on my disorder, which he doesn't understand and I don't expect him to because managing it is my responsibility and though he wasn't mad, we've been seeing him less and less. He's always been a super avoidant guy and emotionally unavailable, according to my husband.

 I just feel tortured all over again and he gets to make choices that hurt us and willfully looks the other way (that's how I feel, not saying that's the actual case). I want him to be happy, he's suffering too, but we were there for him when it was all still fresh. Now that I'm struggling and my poor husband is doing everything to be supportive of us both, it's like, eff you son and DIL. He even passive aggressively jabbed at him when husband couldn't fix his computer right away. I know he wouldn't have to talked to his new gf like that. Why do dads do this. Why are they completely okay with hurting their children.

 I'm a fucking grown ass adult why do I still feel this way. My entire life it just seems like parents only want to hurt their kids. I have looked at malice and sadism in the face. While he's not sadistic he's definitely looking the other way and husband insists he's not willfully ignorant. 

  
I just want this episode to go away. The panic attacks take a toll on my body and nobody cares. Absolutely nobody cares. This condition is a MONSTER. Be nice to any soldiers you see I swear. It is a horrible horrible condition and I wish this on no one. 

And yes, I went back to therapy. Once a week. I am so fucking done. I just wanted a dad. A family. Just sitting together and having cake and coffee, which is the bare minimum I want back.

## What is Fortune Nexora?

Fortune Nexora is an **automated trading platform** designed to help you buy and sell crypto and other financial assets like a pro — even if you’re not one. Think of it like your personal trading assistant that never sleeps. It uses AI algorithms to analyze markets in real-time and execute trades based on the best possible opportunities it detects.

It’s especially appealing if you’re someone who doesn’t have the time or know-how to sit and analyze charts all day. With Fortune Nexora, you can automate the entire process and let the platform do the heavy lifting. You can also trade manually if that’s your thing, which makes it pretty flexible.

## Who Created Fortune Nexora?

Here’s where things get a bit fuzzy. Like many platforms in this space, Fortune Nexora doesn’t have a well-known founder. There’s no Elon Musk-type figure tweeting about it or a flashy whitepaper with a dozen PhDs on the cover.

That said, it seems to be developed by a team of **financial tech experts and algorithm engineers** — similar to platforms like Bitcoin Code or Immediate Edge. While the lack of a known founder might raise eyebrows, it’s not a dealbreaker. Plenty of solid platforms have launched anonymously and still delivered strong performance.

## How Does Fortune Nexora Work?

At its core, Fortune Nexora runs on a **proprietary AI trading algorithm**. This system scans the market for patterns, trends, and price fluctuations, then places trades based on preset rules or historical data. The goal? Maximize gains and minimize losses — automatically.

Once you fund your account, you can either set the bot on autopilot or choose to trade manually. Even on autopilot, you still have control over risk levels, asset types, and trade size, which makes it more customizable than you’d expect.

The platform also provides real-time data, charts, and alerts, so if you like to stay informed (or just want to feel like a Wall Street trader), you’ll appreciate the tools.

## Fortune Nexora Pros and Cons

**Pros:**
- ✅ Easy to use, even for beginners
- ✅ Automated trading with customizable settings
- ✅ Supports multiple assets — not just crypto
- ✅ No hidden fees or commissions
- ✅ Demo account available to practice risk-free

**Cons:**
- ❌ No official founder or dev team listed
- ❌ Not available in some countries
- ❌ Requires $250 minimum deposit to start

Honestly, the pros outweigh the cons for me — as long as you’re okay with the initial deposit.

### Step 3: Start Trading

Once funded, you can either:
- Use the demo account to practice.
- Set your bot preferences and go live.
- Trade manually if you prefer full control.

The dashboard makes it easy to switch between modes.

## How to Delete a Fortune Nexora Account?

If you ever want out, you can **delete your account** by contacting support. They’ll guide you through the process. Make sure you withdraw any funds first — once your account’s deleted, access is gone for good.

Fortune Nexora is a **solid option** if you’re looking for an easy-to-use, versatile trading platform. It combines **automation with customization**, which is rare. The interface is beginner-friendly, but the features are powerful enough for more experienced traders too.

It’s not perfect — the anonymous team and lack of a mobile app might put some people off — but overall, it delivers where it counts. If you're curious and have $250 to test the waters, I’d say it’s worth a shot.

## What is Epure Tradelin?

Epure Tradelin is an **automated trading platform** designed to help users — especially beginners — trade a variety of financial assets like crypto, forex, and stocks without needing deep market knowledge. It uses a combination of **AI algorithms** and user-defined parameters to make trades on your behalf.

## Who Created Epure Tradelin?

This is one area where things get a little murky. Like many new-gen trading platforms, **the creators of Epure Tradelin prefer to stay anonymous**. What we do know is that it’s backed by a team of experienced developers and financial analysts — at least according to their pitch.

The lack of transparency around the creators isn’t unusual in this space. Platforms like Bitcoin Era and Immediate Edge launched similarly. But still, I’d feel better if they were a bit more open about who’s behind the curtain. That said, the platform itself *feels* professionally built and secure.

## What is AI Finance Pilot?

AI Finance Pilot is an **automated trading platform** that uses artificial intelligence to analyze the markets and execute trades on your behalf. Think of it like having a robo-trader that doesn’t sleep and makes decisions based on data, not emotions.

The platform is designed to handle a wide array of assets including **cryptocurrencies**, **forex**, **stocks**, and even **commodities**. It’s all about giving users—especially beginners—a chance to participate in financial trading without needing to stare at charts all day.

It also offers a **demo mode**, which is great if you're just starting out and want to see how it works before putting real money on the line. It’s kind of like a flight simulator, but for trading.

## Who Created AI Finance Pilot?

So, here's the thing—it’s not totally clear who’s behind AI Finance Pilot. There’s no “Meet the Founders” section or LinkedIn pages linked to the site. That’s pretty common with these kinds of platforms, especially ones that connect you with third-party brokers.

But based on the structure and design, it seems to be built by a team with experience in **algorithmic trading** and fintech. The interface is polished, and the trading logic feels solid—definitely not something slapped together overnight.

While the anonymity might raise eyebrows, it’s also common in the AI trading space. Platforms like **Bitcoin Era** and **Immediate Edge** operate similarly.

## How Does AI Finance Pilot Work?

At its core, AI Finance Pilot uses **machine learning algorithms** to scan the markets in real-time. It looks for price patterns, trends, and triggers that suggest when to buy or sell assets. The goal? Maximize potential profits while minimizing risks.

Here’s how it works under the hood:

- The AI scans thousands of trading signals per second.
- It compares them to historical data to spot high-probability trades.
- Once it finds a match, it places the trade automatically.
- You can set parameters like stop-loss, profit targets, and trade amounts.

You don’t need to be a tech genius to use it. Everything is pretty plug-and-play. You sign up, fund your account, tweak a few settings, and the bot does the rest.

## AI Finance Pilot Pros and Cons

Like every tool, it’s not perfect, but here’s my honest take.

**Pros**:

- **Beginner-friendly** interface
- **Real-time AI-driven trading**
- **Supports multiple asset classes**
- **No hidden fees**
- **Demo account for practice**
- **Fast withdrawals (24-48 hours)**

**Cons**:

- **Lack of transparency** about the development team
- **Not available in all countries** (check before signing up)
- **Relies on third-party brokers**, so trading quality may vary
- **No dedicated mobile app** (just mobile browser)

Overall, the pros outweigh the cons, especially if you’re just getting into automated trading.

## What Devices Can be Used to Access AI Finance Pilot?

Good news here—you’re not locked into a specific device. AI Finance Pilot works on pretty much anything with a browser:

- **Desktop (Windows/Mac/Linux)**
- **Smartphones (iOS and Android)**
- **Tablets**
  
There’s no standalone mobile app (yet), but the mobile site is responsive and smooth. I tested it on an iPhone and it worked just as well as on desktop.

## AI Finance Pilot – Supported Countries

AI Finance Pilot supports **most countries**, including the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and parts of Europe. That said, there are a few exceptions due to local financial regulations.

If you’re in one of the restricted regions (like North Korea or a few Middle Eastern countries), you might not be able to register. But for the majority of users, access shouldn’t be an issue.

Pro tip: Use a **VPN** if you’re traveling and want to log in from a country that’s restricted.

## AI Finance Pilot – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

The AI behind this platform isn’t just running on pre-set rules—it actually **learns from market behavior**. That means it adapts to changes and doesn’t just follow outdated strategies. This is a huge win in volatile markets like crypto.

### User-Friendly Interface

Everything is super intuitive. You don’t need to know what a candlestick chart is or how Fibonacci retracements work. The dashboard shows your balance, open trades, and performance stats clearly.

### Mobile Accessibility

Even though there’s no app, the mobile browser version is slick. I was able to check trades, adjust settings, and even fund my account while waiting in line for coffee. That’s a win.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set up **email or SMS alerts** for major market movements or when trades are executed. It adds a layer of control without needing to be glued to your screen.

### Multiple Asset Trading

This isn’t just for crypto. You can also trade:

- **Forex**
- **Stocks**
- **Commodities**

That diversification is great for spreading risk and testing different strategies.

## Is AI Finance Pilot a Scam?

Short answer: **No, it’s not a scam**. It’s legit, but it’s important to set realistic expectations.

Yes, it uses automation. Yes, people have reported profits. But it’s not a magic money machine. You can (and probably will) lose on some trades. That’s the nature of trading.

There’s no shady fine print, and withdrawals worked for me within 48 hours. Just know that your experience may vary depending on the broker you’re connected to.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on AI Finance Pilot?

The minimum deposit is **$250**, which is pretty standard in the automated trading space.

This deposit goes directly into your trading account—it's not a fee. You can withdraw it anytime (minus any open trades).

That said, I’d recommend starting with just the minimum to test things out before committing more.

### AI Finance Pilot Customer Support

Customer support is available **24/7** via:

- **Live chat**
- **Email**

I tried both. The chat reps were responsive, and the email turnaround was under 12 hours. Not bad.

There’s no phone support, which might be a downside for some, but overall, the help options are solid.

## How do you start trading on AI Finance Pilot?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the official AI Finance Pilot site and fill out the sign-up form. It asks for your name, email, and phone number. Took me less than 2 minutes.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

After signing up, you’ll be connected to a broker. You’ll need to **verify your identity** (standard KYC stuff) and make your **initial $250 deposit**. You can use credit/debit cards, bank transfers, or even crypto in some cases.

### Step 3: Start Trading

Once funded, you can either:

- Use **demo mode** to practice
- Jump into **live trading** with the AI activated

You can tweak settings like trade size, risk level, and asset choice. Then just let the bot do its thing.

## How to Delete an AI Finance Pilot Account?

If you decide AI Finance Pilot isn’t for you, deleting your account is simple.

- Reach out to customer support via email or chat.
- Request account deletion and confirm any remaining balance is withdrawn.

No hoops, no drama.

PART ONE:

My family was unique. Me and my Dad were English, but my step-mum was Romanian. We lived in a cramped house with her mother and my two half-brothers. Everyone at family parties but me, my Dad and two infant brothers were bilingual, and we often found ourselves cornered at events—while they cursed our bloodline in mother tongue, we just sat there awkwardly. Chewing on some jellied Eastern European meat.

That Christmas, we were heading to her family’s hometown. Some dingy, rural “village” in the ass-end of nowhere. I can’t say I was excited. In fact, I was dreading it. I usually preferred to spend Christmas with the more functional side of the family on my mum’s side. Better food, better phone signal, and generally less jellied meats.

The closest city was Brașov, about twenty miles away. We drove there in a rickety old Ford van to the not-so-surprisingly mediocre childhood home my step-mum had described on the plane. I’m not sure “charming and cozy” were the right words. In fairness, it did have some character. Her mother, and her mother before her-going all the way back to 1899-had lived in that house.

Their photos lined the hallway walls, getting worse and worse in quality until they turned to black and white. Each woman stood with her daughter, both in matching white gowns embroidered with delicate floral patterns. The older women wore crowns made of antlers, while the girls had flower crowns and similar yellow dresses.

The house itself had a sickly yellow exterior, the paint peeling away to reveal the popcorn-textured walls typical of elderly homes. Dead plants in broken pots surrounded the porch, oozing soil across the cracked concrete like infected wounds.

The front door was strange. Sloppy streaks of dried red paint ringed the frame, and rusty iron bars encased it like a prison gate. When it opened, it creaked-not a casual creak, but the kind of high-pitched wail that scratches the back of your brain and makes you scrunch your face.

It was already dark by the time we arrived, and I was eager to collapse into a bed but my room was unsettlling to say the least.

The walls were stained with yellowed splotches, every surface was buried under a thick blanket of dust and grime. The far wall was completely smothered in dreamcatchers-stick-and-string constructions that looked barely held together, clustering around the only window like a fungal growth. Behind the headboard of the bed was a chaotic mosaic of mirrors, big and small, all lazily nailed into the wall, their frames cracked and bleeding rust. To the right of the bed, a shrine of crosses-tiny ornate ones with Jesus nailed to the front, large plain ones with Roman numerals carved into the beams, crucifixes of every kind imaginable, decorating every inch.

PART TWO:

At around 2 a.m., I woke up starving. I stumbled toward the kitchen in just my underwear, but as I passed the hallway lined with portraits, I heard rustling.

I braced for humiliation. The last thing I wanted was to run into my Romanian grandmother, who didn’t speak a word of English, and have her catch sight of my tight pants suffocating my penis.

Instead, in an arguably worse but somehow less awkward scenario, I bumped into my naked Dad-standing in the glow of the fridge light, shoveling out any food that hadn’t yet expired.

“Dad. Why are you naked?” I sighed, shielding my eyes from what lied ahead.

“I always sleep naked mate. That’s just how I roll.”

I exhaled through my nose, eyes squeezed shut.
“Have you seen my room? It looks like a ritual took place in there.”

“You’ve got those creepy drawings as well?” Dad asked, his face lighting up like he’d just made a major discovery. 

“See the thing is, their culture’s a bit strange but- actually, I don’t know,” he muttered, scratching his head.
“Just don’t act weird about it. They’ll get offended. You know how they are about their religious jargon .”

He wasn’t wrong.

At home in London, when we went to bed, the Romanians would burn the oddest-smelling incense - like banana, elderflower, and that shitty French blue cheese. I’d always complain to my Dad. When he finally mentioned it to them, out of his own frustration, they went berserk - claiming they had a duty to ward off spirits, that they sensed evil in our home.

Given the obvious disdain for me - the lingering reminder of my dad’s former marriage - I always took that as a bit of a indirect insult.

The following morning, bright and early on Christmas Eve… Eve, my dad was inside, leaning against a windowsill, wedging his elbow into the gaps where photo frames and crucifixes didn’t quite reach. He was drinking black tea (no milk yet) and staring longingly out the window at the stunning views of the Carpathians.

Outside, the Romanian duo were already waving incense around. The strong aroma was still potent even inside the house.

I stepped out, curious to watch - maybe even to join in as a gesture of goodwill.

They didn’t acknowledge me. Not really. They were moving slowly, dreamily - gliding in half-circles around a cluster of small stones arranged deliberately on the frosted ground. Each of them held a smouldering bundle of herbs and sticks, the smoke trailing upward in thick, twisting ropes. My step-mum’s arms waved in slow, sweeping gestures - like they had been choreographed .

Her mother moved differently. She didn’t dance so much as twitch and pivot. Her feet dragged across the ice in awkward half-steps, like she was being pulled by some thread I couldn’t see. Her free hand clutched an object tight to her chest - something small, wrapped in cloth. She was whispering constantly, breath hissing through her teeth, her words jagged and rhythmic.

Suddenly, my grandmother turned and  grabbed my hand with overwhelming strength and screeched, her face contorting with fury.

“ÎNĂUNTRU!” she barked.

I scurried back inside like a rodent skipping away from a veteran housecat.

Me and my dad exchanged a mutual look that translated to “fuck that” but we bit our tongues.

My step-mum came back through the front door, urgently ushering her mother past me simultaneously apologising on her behalf before the old woman jolted in and hissed something under her breath. Some kind of hate (I presumed), spat like venom in my direction:

“Strigoi, vrei să dispari cu Strigoi.”

I shrugged and backed off, muttering a half-hearted “sorry” under my breath.

PART THREE:

The next morning, Christmas Eve - my Dad decided we should contribute something to the holiday meal. Namely: meat.

The butcher’s was tucked behind a row of rotting wooden buildings that might once have been shops. Inside, it smelled like copper and wet fur. There was a slab of wood, stained a permanent maroon in the center, a counter covered in cling film, and a hulking man behind it who looked like he’d rather gut us than serve us.

“Chicken?” Dad said brightly, pointing to the counter. Nothing.

“Pui,” I tried, the one Romanian word I’d Googled before we left the house. Still nothing.

We escalated.

I stared and hesitated waiting for a moment until I clucked loudly perfectly imitating a chicken. The butcher remained dead pan before my dad started up again and pecked at the air. It wasn’t a proud moment for Anglo-European relations.

The butcher didn’t move. Just stared. Then, as if finnaly bored of watching the two idiots clucking and flapping their arms, he slowly reached into a back crate and slammed a full, feathered chicken onto the counter.

“See?” Dad grinned. “Works every time.”

We handed over the cash - probably too much - and turned to leave.

Then the butcher spoke.

One word. Harsh. “Leave”

I turned back. His eyes weren’t on Dad. They were locked on me. Studying. Unblinking. Just before we stepped out he drew a crucifix across himself gently with his index.

PART FOUR:

Later that day, around dusk, he came to the house. The butcher.

We heard shouting from outside before we even saw him. He was on the doorstep, his voice booming like he was trying to scare off dogs. My step-mum opened the door and immediately blocked our view. The grandmother appeared behind her, and the two of them began firing rapid Romanian at the butcher like bullets. 

It was tense. Heated. Angry.

I couldn’t understand a word of it - but I understood tone, and I understood looks. The butcher pointed inside at me twice and spat on the ground. I wasn’t exactly fluent, but I caught one word clearly:

“Străin.”
Foreigner.

He left without stepping foot inside. Slammed the gate on the way out. I wanted to ask my step-mum about the incident but it was difficult, every conversation with her felt like walking a tight rope trying to gain her approval. The conversations felt like talking to a stranger more than a family member, always akward, broken up by long chunks of silence.

That night, I couldn’t sleep.

It wasn’t fear. Just unease. That sense of being in the way - like the house was trying to fit around me but couldn’t quite manage it. The crosses on the wall looked more twisted than before. The dreamcatchers were still swaying, even though no wind came through the closed window.

I sat up in bed and looked outside. The snow was falling thick and heavy, sticking to the trees like ash. The mountains in the distance looked black and hollow.

Then I saw it.

At first I thought it was a branch. Something crooked against the treeline. But it moved. Not walked - shifted. The figure straightened, almost impossibly tall, and stepped closer to the house.

It didn’t come far. Just to the edge of the trees. Close enough for me to see the shape of it.

It looked human. 

Gaunt. Pale. Hollow eyes set too deep. Arms that didn’t hang right, slightly longer than they should be, like someone had pulled them down too hard. Its mouth moved - not speaking, just… twitching.

Then it looked up.

And it saw me.

We made eye contact.

I didn’t breathe.

It didn’t move. Just held my gaze for a long, impossible moment. Then - as if satisfied - it turned and vanished into the trees, leaving only a set of shallow footprints in the snow.

I didn’t sleep after that. Just lay there under the covers, ears open, eyes wide.

PART FIVE:

The morning came, the house breathing, the creak of old wood and the soft hiss of the wind against the eaves. My dad was asleep on the sofa, one arm flopped over his face, the other clutching an empty tea mug. I’d grown restless, drifting down the narrow hallway lined with photographs. Stiff-faced families in strange costumes, eyes sharp as if they’d been caught admist a crime.

Halfway along, I noticed the far end of the corridor was choked with boxes and bits of dismantled furniture, a kind of clumsy barricade. The wood was splintered in places, boxes dented, as though they’d been shoved here quickly and never touched again. I didn’t think much before I started shifting them aside - old newspaper bundles, a wardrobe door, the rusted frame of a bed.

Behind it all was a narrow door. It resisted at first, sticking in the frame as if it didn’t want to be opened, then gave with a dull sigh.

The air inside was colder, and heavy with a strange, sweet rot, the way old books smell. Light leaked in through a crack in the shutter, catching the dust that spun lazily like tiny insects.

Every surface seemed cluttered. Shelves sagged under the weight of brass bowls, bundles of dried plants tied with fraying twine, and tarnished coins stacked in towers. Glass jars sat in crooked rows, some filled with cloudy liquid, others with blackened shapes I couldn’t fathom.

The necklace had been buried under a pile of dried lavender and loose rosary beads, the chain cold and tangled when I pulled it free. The cross was small, wooden, smoothed from years of touch, the edges worn into rounded softness. I told myself I’d put it back later, but it found its way into my pocket instead, where my thumb kept tracing the grooves without thinking.

PART SIX:

Christmas Day was bright and sharp, the air cutting enough to sting the nose. We were up early, the house echoing with hurried footsteps and the rattle of bags. My stepmother announced we were driving to a town over the hill - something about last-minute things for dinner - and my dad was already lacing his boots before I’d processed what she’d said. I was half-asleep and half-annoyed, so when they told me to stay behind, I just waved them off.

By late afternoon, the sky was beginning to drain of colour. I sat on the front porch steps, the boards cold under me, my phone struggling to load anything more than half a TikTok before freezing. I swiped at the screen, laughed at a video I barely saw, then let my eyes wander past the edge of the yard.

That’s when I noticed it.

At first, it was just a dark smudge in the tree line, between two pines. My eyes played tricks, and I thought it was a tree stump, until it shifted - a slow, deliberate movement, as though it knew I was watching. My stomach dropped, and my hands went cold.

It stepped forward.

Even from that distance, its shape was wrong. Too long in the limbs, the head craning forward unnaturally. Every step was silent on the snow, but I felt the weight of it, the certainty that it was coming for me.

I bolted inside, slamming the door and fumbling at the lock. The wood shuddered under my hands before I heard the first bang. It wasn’t frantic - each blow was measured, almost rhythmic, like it was enjoying the sound. The glass in the frame trembled.

Without thinking, I yanked the necklace from my pocket, clutching the cross so hard it dug into my palm. My breaths came too fast, tears spilling before I could stop them.

The banging stopped.

For a heartbeat, there was silence, and I thought maybe it had gone. Then came the sound - a sharp, wet shriek, like metal tearing underwater. The air seemed to vibrate with it. Through the small pane in the door, I caught the blur of movement - a lurch backward, the shape retreating across the drive.

I stood frozen in the hallway, my hand aching from how tightly I gripped the cross. Only when the last trace of it had slipped back into the trees did I sink to the floor, my chest heaving.

The house felt too big and too quiet, like it was expanding away for me. I didn’t move from that spot until I heard the crunch of tyres in the snow hours later.

PART SEVEN:

When headlights finally swept across the front window, I almost cried in relief. The faint rumble of the rental car pulled me to my feet - but then a sharp thud cut through the night.

I froze.

The headlights jerked, catching something pale tumbling across the driveway. By the time I opened the door, the car was idling at an angle, steam curling from its bonnet in the freezing air.

Dad was still gripping the wheel, white-knuckled, staring ahead like he hadn’t blinked since the impact. My stepmum leaned halfway out the passenger seat, her head snapping between the driveway and the treeline.

Something lay in the snow. Too thin. Limbs twisted wrong.

It moved.

It didn’t stand so much as rise - fluid and insect-like, vertebrae flexing in ways that made my stomach turn. For a moment it was lit in the high-beams: grey skin stretched tight over bone, a face I couldn’t fully register before it slunk, quick and low, into the dark treeline.

Dad’s breath burst in the cold air. “Jesus Christ”

“What was that?” I frantically called, my voice cracking while I stood on the front patio shaking.

Dad stumbled towards me, with my two brothers in his arms, muttering, “We’re leaving. Bags in the car. Now.” 

Inside, the warm air didn’t touch the cold in my chest. Dad was dragging bags toward the hallway, still ranting: “We’ll get to the city, find a hotel, hell, I’ll pay for the-“

“No.”

The word from my stepmum was flat, demanding. She closed the door with a click, turned the lock, and stood there a moment, as if listening.

“You can’t leave. Not now they no your here”

Dad let out a shaky laugh. “Okay sure honey, you saw that. We need to leave”

“They own the roads at night,” she said, without looking at him.

“They?” My Dad asked clearly frustrated 

She turned then, meeting his eyes - then mine. “Strigoi. They were here before the town. The stories say they came from the mountains, hungry for blood. This town. My people have kept them weak for hundreds of years… but they must sense… outsiders” Her gaze lingered on me.

Dad’s mouth opened, closed again. I could tell he wanted to scoff, but the memory of the thing on the road clamped his jaw shut.

“We stay. Until morning.”

The living room became a bunker. Lamps on fall blast, the wood stove giving off a low heat. My stepmum laid a small mirror on the coffee table, next to a bag of salt and an unlit candle. She sat in the armchair nearest the window, her eyes darting to the glass more often than not.

We didn’t speak much. The wind rattled the siding, and once or twice the snow on the roof slid with a loud crinkle.

Then came the yelling from the forest, like foxes mating. 

Painful and raspy.

Dad started to rise, but she grabbed his arm, holding a finger to her lips as a great shadow pressed against the window.

The pale oval of a face smeared against the glass. The features were too sharp, eyes black and deep-set like oil wells. Breath fogged the glass between long, curled teeth.

It hissed while I screamed profanities and shielded my brothers eyes doing little to stop their squeeling.

My stepmum snatched the mirror from the table and angled the glass toward it.

The thing’s skin rippled, then blistered like boiling water. Black fluid welled up under the surface. It shrieked, the sound rattling the panes, before it vanished into the white night.

Silence pressed in again.

“More will come” she said while lowering herself back into her seat.

The quiet didn’t last.

A sudden, bone-rattling BOOM slammed against the front door, the wood shuddering in its frame.

Dad shot to his feet. “What the fuck-” he panted.

Another BOOM. Then another, faster. The walls seemed to shake with each blow, but there was something else now - above us. Heavy thuds, in a slow, crawling pattern, moving along the roof in time with the pounding at the door.

The stepmum’s face had gone pale. “They never come alone,” she whispered.

The next strike splintered the doorframe. My brothers screamed. Grandma chanted in Romanian while attempting to stand. The room was swelling with a symphony of stress inducing noises, thud after thud pelted the door until it blew inwards in a blast of cold air and flying wood as it slammed onto the floor.

It was inside. The chanting grew louder, some mess of latin echoing through the room, ringing in my head.

The thing moved in a blur - all knees and elbows. it hit Dad so hard the air left his lungs. They crashed to the floor, the Strigoi’s clawed hands pinning his arms as it pressed its face close to his. Its teeth worked in a jittery, animal motion, breath reeking of rot.

The screaming of my dad, my brothers, thebchanting, my chest tightened and I froze up.

My stepmum didn’t scream. She spun toward the tall shelf in the corner, her hand finding a wide clay pot, water sloshing thick and cloudy inside. Without hesitation she swung it over her head and smashed it against the creature’s back.

The liquid steamed where it hit. The Strigoi arched, letting out a raw, ragged war cry. A hole was opening in its back, skin hissing and collapsing inward as if eaten by acid.

Dad’s arm came free. His hand shot to the desk beside him, grabbing the nearest object - a heavy, leather-bound book with brass corners. He didn’t hesitate. He brought it down on the thing’s head with a dull thunk.

It spasmed.

He hit it again. And again. And again. The sharp corner of the book split skin and splintered bone,  each strike splattering until the pale head caved in severly deformed like a rotted pumpkin.

For a moment, nobody moved. The smell of burnt meat and something older, fouler, filled the room.

My stepmum’s voice broke the silence in conversation with her mum, while all me and my Dad could do was lock eyes and nod.

I could do nothing but force down the air in my lungs and saliva through my throat.

Outside, in the snow-choked dark, something called to us - a low, chime like howl from the treeline.

The body lay twisted on the floorboards, steaming faintly in the cold draft from the broken doorway. Dad’s breathing was ragged, his knuckles white around the blood-slick book.

From her chair in the corner, the grandmother rose slowly and timidly. Her joints cracked as she straightened, eyes fixed not on us, but on the dead strigoi at Dad’s feet.

She started murmuring.

It wasn’t loud - just the same low, rasping chant, the syllables tumbling over one another. She moved slowly, almost reverently, until she stood beside the Strigoi’s pumpkin head.

Her hand dipped into the shreded mess of its back. Blood, thick and oily, coated her fingers. The whispered chanting never stopped.

She turned toward the open doorway, bare feet crunching on shards of former door. Outside, the snow reflected the faint orange light from the room, but the tree line was still dark, swallowing what little colour was left in the sky.

At the threshold, she raised her hand and dragged her palm hard across the lintel. The blood smeared in uneven lines, dripping slightly in the cold, but she pressed until her fingers left streaks like crude symbols above the frame.

She stepped back inside without looking at any of us. Her murmuring softened until it was almost gone.

Dad swallowed hard and we both spoke at the same time “What is she doing?”

My mum answered, without taking her eyes off her mother. “So they remember which home took one of their own.”

The grandmother’s eyes flicked toward me, just for a moment. A small grin. Followed by that same, unblinking look I’d seen in the photos in the hallway.

Outside, the forest was quiet again.

PART EIGHT:

We endured the night in silence, watching the open doorway, nerves stretched thin, speaking only to reassure each other when the house groaned or the wind pressed against the walls. By 5:23, when the first thin light crept over the horizon, we were already dragging our suitcases through the heavy snow toward the car. The sun’s beams pierced the forest canopy in narrow shafts, like spotlights cutting through the shadows.

As we drove through the town the houses appeared one by one - scattered far apart, half-buried in frost. On each door, without exception, a fresh smear of red glistened in the morning light, marking the homes.

1mlig3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIContentAutomators/comments/1mlig3q/stop_throwing_money_away_new_creator_guide/,Stop throwing money away! New creator guide reveals tools actually worth it (before they're patched) 💰,"Hey, fellow AiContentAutomators! 🌟

Ever felt like you’re just **throwing money away** every time you discover a shiny new tool that turns out to be, well, not so shiny? Yeah, me too. We've all been there—spending late nights feverishly trying out that trending software everyone’s raving about, only to realize it’s about as useful as a chocolate teapot. 🍫☕

But guess what? I just came across this **new creator guide** that dropped some serious wisdom on tools that are actually worth your hard-earned cash—before they get patched or, worse, vanish into the abyss of forgotten tech. 🎤💥 Here’s a taste of what I found (and trust me, it’s good stuff):

### Tools That Won't Break the Bank (or Your Spirit!) 💸

1. **AI Writing Assistants**  
   You want to crank out content that not only sounds great but also resonates with your audience? Consider tools like **Jasper** or **Copy.ai**. They can seriously cut your writing time in half. If you can keep your coffee budget in check, why not invest in your creativity?

2. **Social Media Scheduling**  
   Stop playing whack-a-mole with your posts! Tools like **Buffer** and **Later** let you schedule your content, so you can kick back while your posts do the work. Plus, who doesn’t love waking up to engagement while still in their PJs?

3. **Graphic Design Made Easy**  
   You don’t need an art degree to make eye-catching visuals. Check out **Canva** or **Visme**. I mean, have you tried making social media graphics with them? It’s like art class but way more fun (and less messy!).

4. **SEO Tools**  
   Don't get lost in the abyss of Google search results. Use tools like **Surfer SEO** or **Ahrefs** to save time and optimize your content effectively. Who wouldn’t want to climb those search results like Spider-Man? 🕷️💻

5. **Collaboration Platforms**  
   If you’re working with a team (or a partner who keeps forgetting their half of the workload), tools like **Trello** or **Notion** can save your sanity. No more “I thought you did that!” moments. 

### But here’s the kicker— 

These tools are evolving faster than I can keep up with! It’s like a wild game of musical chairs, and if you're not careful, you could be left standing. The guide I read emphasizes the importance of **staying ahead of the game.** Invest wisely while you can because once the trend rolls out of the novelty phase, you might be left with a less-than-stellar tool that everyone swears is still great. 🤦‍♂️

And let’s be real, it’s not just about the money, is it? It’s about protecting our precious time and sanity. Who’s with me on wanting to work smarter, not harder? 🙌 Let’s share more tools or hacks we’ve stumbled upon that actually saved us hours of headaches.

In the world of men’s fashion, few garments achieve the perfect balance of **style, comfort, and versatility** quite like the **V-neck sweater**. This classic piece has evolved from its sporting roots into a wardrobe essential for the modern gentleman.

In this guide, we’ll explore the **history**, **craftsmanship**, **styling versatility**, and **seasonal adaptability** of the V-neck sweater—plus tips for making it a signature piece in your wardrobe.

# The Evolution of the V-Neck Sweater: From Sportswear to Menswear Icon

The V-neck sweater made its debut in the early 20th century, originally worn by tennis and cricket players who needed comfort, mobility, and breathability during matches. The V-shaped neckline allowed for better movement while also revealing the shirt collar and tie underneath—a combination that exuded understated elegance even in sports.

By the mid-20th century, the V-neck sweater had transcended its athletic beginnings. Hollywood icons like **Cary Grant** and **Paul Newman** were often photographed wearing V-neck sweaters, cementing the look as sophisticated yet approachable. Over time, designers reimagined the garment in various fabrics, patterns, and fits, ensuring it stayed relevant in every era.

Today, the V-neck sweater is a **symbol of timeless menswear**, worn by everyone from CEOs in boardrooms to creatives in coffee shops. It effortlessly adapts to modern trends without losing its original charm.

# Craftsmanship and Quality: What Makes a Great V-Neck Sweater

A truly exceptional V-neck sweater is more than just a stylish garment—it’s the result of **quality materials, expert craftsmanship, and attention to detail**.

# 1. Premium Fabrics

* **Merino Wool** – Soft, breathable, and naturally temperature-regulating. Perfect for year-round wear.
* **Cashmere** – Luxuriously soft, lightweight, and insulating. Ideal for cooler months.
* **Cotton Blends** – Breathable and comfortable, great for spring and fall.
* **Performance Fabrics** – Modern blends that resist wrinkles, wick moisture, and hold their shape.

# 2. Superior Stitching

A high-quality V-neck sweater should feature **tight, even stitching** that enhances durability and prevents unraveling. Reinforced cuffs, hems, and necklines ensure the sweater maintains its shape after multiple wears.

# 3. Perfect Fit

Whether you prefer a slim, tailored look or a relaxed fit, the sweater should contour to your frame without feeling restrictive. The **V-neck depth** should complement your neckline without being too low or too high.

Investing in a well-made V-neck sweater means you’re getting a piece that not only looks great today but will continue to look great for years to come.

# Versatility in Styling: From Casual to Formal

The V-neck sweater’s biggest strength lies in its **styling flexibility**. It can shift from casual weekend wear to formal office attire with ease.

# 1. Smart-Casual

Pair a lightweight V-neck sweater with **dark denim** or **chinos** and loafers. A crisp white T-shirt underneath adds a clean, modern touch.

# 2. Business Professional

Wear your V-neck sweater over a **dress shirt and tie**, layered under a blazer. This combination provides warmth without sacrificing a polished, professional appearance.

# 3. Relaxed Weekend Look

For a laid-back outfit, pair your sweater with **casual trousers or joggers** and minimalist sneakers. Opt for softer fabrics like cotton blends for maximum comfort.

# 4. Seasonal Layering

Layering a V-neck sweater over an **oxford shirt** in fall or under a **wool coat** in winter ensures you stay stylish in any weather.

# V-Neck Sweaters for All Seasons

One of the V-neck sweater’s most appealing traits is its **year-round versatility**.

# Spring

Lightweight cotton or merino wool V-neck sweaters are perfect for cool mornings and evenings. Opt for **pastel shades** or lighter neutrals like beige or soft blue.

# Summer

Thin, breathable cotton blends work well for air-conditioned offices or cooler summer nights. Pair with linen trousers for a relaxed yet refined look.

# Fall

Autumn is sweater season. Choose **midweight merino wool** in rich tones like burgundy, forest green, or mustard for a warm seasonal vibe.

# Winter

Chunky knits or luxurious cashmere keep you warm while adding texture to your outfit. Layer under a wool coat or tailored overcoat for timeless winter style.

# The Timeless Appeal: Why Every Man Needs a V-Neck Sweater

The enduring popularity of the V-neck sweater comes down to **three main factors**:

1. **Sophistication Without Effort** – The V-neck frames the face and highlights the shirt collar, giving an instant touch of refinement.

3. **Long-Term Value** – A well-made V-neck sweater lasts for years, making it a smart wardrobe investment.

1mlie3g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mlie3g,Cry to Heaven-themed dinner!,"Hi everyone! Back in February, I posted about having a Cry to Heaven themed dinner and finally got around to having it now in August 😅 This was a lot of fun to plan! I found these beautiful cherub plates and coffee mugs in my grandmother’s linen closet which haven’t seen the light since the 90s. For music, I played Vivaldi, Bononcini: Cantate in Soprano, and Dinner Classics: The Italian Album. For food, I tried to do more of a “nod” to locations instead of being historically accurate. For drinks, we had Pinot Grigio (white wine was referenced a lot I thought in that book) and I also made Bellinis, a famous drink from the Venetian restaurant Harry’s Bar. For appetizers, I put out grapes and prosciutto. For dinner, I made Spaghetti aglio e olio (Naples) alongside salad with balsamic vinaigrette (as suggested by one user on here when I was asking for suggestions in my first post ☺️) and grilled bread with caprese salad. For dessert, we had coffee and my sister actually picked these out and bought a small assortment of pastries. She was excited for this dinner and took a break from studying to help out as she was the one I would sob to and give her updates on Tonio and his antics 😂 anyways, this was a lot of fun and made it feel like a completion after reading CTH 💜 it got me through the winter and I’ve never read anything like it before and it hasn’t left my mind since reading it (all in the best way possible though!). I just loved the characters and this was so fun to do in their respect. Can’t recommend CTH enough! Cheers! x
(PS I would love to read more of Anne Rice’s books and recently got The Vampire Armand which I read some things that it is kinda like CTH but would love to hear other thoughts and suggestions too if there are other books out there that are best to begin with before going into this one! Thank you!)

1mlidyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1mlidyr/why_are_llms_not_the_route_to_general_capabilities/,Why are LLMs not the route to General capabilities?,"Can someone please explain to me the argument that LLMs are theoretically incapable of reaching general intelligence?

My understanding is that natural intelligence is not a single, omnipotent model “running the show,” but rather a generalizable algorithm made up of many specialized agents, each optimized for different tasks. These range from pattern recognition in vision, sound, and other sensory modalities, to something as seemingly simple as lifting a cup of coffee — with all the nuances implied, such as adjusting for the cup’s weight, temperature, and balance (think society of mind by Minsky).

We see glimpses of these specialized agents in cases of brain injury, when a particular module is taken offline and its absence reveals both its specific function and its unexpected contributions to other areas. For example, damage to the fusiform face area is known to cause prosopagnosia, or face blindness, but it can also impair the ability to tell apart other objects that require fine-grained visual discrimination, like distinguishing between similar car models, bird species, or even one’s own livestock. Similarly, injury to the cerebellum, long thought to be purely about motor control and coordination, can also disrupt language processing, working memory, and aspects of social cognition, showing that it plays a broader role in predictive modeling and error correction than previously assumed.

Given this, and considering protocols like MCP, as well as the fact that LLMs are trained on vast amounts of API-specific calls and can almost effortlessly interact with any set of tools they are exposed to, my question is: why couldn’t an ensemble of specialized agents — each trained for a specific task — theoretically accomplish what the human brain does?

I feel like I must be missing something, and I’d love to understand why some people consider the LLM route a dead end when it comes to achieving general intelligence.",2,1754720231.0,ArtificialInteligence,18,0.67,False
