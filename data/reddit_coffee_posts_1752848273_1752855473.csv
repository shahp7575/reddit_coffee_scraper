All coffee trees come from East Africa, where Ethiopia and Sudan are located. Thus, coffee is a plant that prefers a hot climate. But it's wrong to assume that the hotter, the better for coffee. There must be a balance.

Modern regions of coffee growth are not accidental at all: trees were specially planted in areas with climatic conditions suitable for both varieties.

To make coffee even better, trees need both warm sunny days (so that the fruit accumulates sugar) and cool nights . These optimal conditions are usually observed in tropical areas near the equator, between 23° north latitude and 23° south latitude.

The amount of precipitation is also an important factor. Arabica requires about 1500-2500 mm of precipitation for 9 months . After the first rains, the coffee tree blooms. Then it takes three months without precipitation for the berries to be harvested and dried during this period.

Unlocking Exclusive Adventures: Mastering the Art of Travel Hacking

The world is vast, an untamed wilderness of experience waiting to be discovered. Every corner holds a secret, every horizon a promise—a whisper of adventure that beckons. But what if I told you that the keys to this kingdom are already in your hands? Enter the realm of travel hacking: a divine gift disguised in points, miles, and rewards.

It starts with a mindset, a transformation from passive observer to bold conqueror. Lay your fears to rest. You are not just a traveler; you are a seeker, a relentless pursuer of experiences that shake your very soul. Travel hacking isn’t just a technique; it’s a philosophy, a calling to explore without limits.

Imagine sipping coffee in a quaint Parisian café, the scent of fresh croissants wafting through the air as you bask in the glow of a sun-drenched morning. You didn’t pay full price for that flight; instead, you leveraged credit card rewards. You mastered the game, turning ordinary expenses into extraordinary journeys. It starts with creating a strategy, aligned with your goals and your dreams.

Open your eyes to the power of credit cards—not as chains that bind you, but as tools for liberation. Choose cards that offer bonuses aligned with where your heart yearns to go. Sign up for those with generous sign-up offers, where one move can grant you a ticket to far-off lands. But remember this: responsible use is non-negotiable. Pay off your balance every month. Let your credit score sing, and build a reputation worthy of your adventures.

Now, let’s unlock the vault of loyalty programs. Airlines, hotels—they’re not just businesses; they are gateways to salvation. Become a member. Dive into their programs. Collect miles and points like treasures, for they are your passports to experiences that would otherwise be a distant dream. Follow these programs, for they often have promotions that only those attuned can perceive. Your eyes are now wide open; the gates of paradise swing wide!

Next, flexibility becomes your trusted ally. The journey of a thousand miles begins with the ability to wander. Set travel dates that are fluid. Wings soar higher when you allow the winds of opportunity to guide your course. Use fare comparison tools to find the best deals, alert yourself to price drops, and embrace spontaneity when a flash sale ignites your spirit.

Don’t overlook the magic of booking mistakes and error fares—those precious moments of serendipity where the universe aligns. Online platforms are rife with opportunities; be vigilant! Join communities that expose these hidden gems. Share wisdom, for in the act of giving, you multiply the potential for your own transformation.

Accommodations—behold! A chance to immerse yourself in local culture rather than stand apart from it. Consider alternatives: vacation rentals, house swaps, or even hostels that breathe the spirit of adventure. Use points to elevate your stay, indulging in luxury that makes the heart race without breaking the bank.

Embrace this truth: the journey is not merely about destinations; it is about connections. Engage with locals, savor their stories, and let your heart be enriched with the fabric of humanity. Your travels will reflect your spirit—genuine, authentic, and alive.

As you stand on the precipice of your next journey, remember that every step you take is a declaration of faith. You are not merely traversing miles; you are forging a path where dreams are made real. Hacking travel isn’t just about trickery; it’s about crafting experiences that ignite passion and purpose.

Now, breathe in deeply. The world awaits—not in the distance but at your fingertips. Embrace this glorious adventure called life. This is your moment to soar beyond the ordinary, to break chains, and to unlock a treasure trove of experiences. Get out there and travel with fervor, for your journey is the revelation waiting to unfold. The universe is calling—answer it!

I don't even know if this is normal, but my energy has become incredibly stable and awesome, like I've found some secret fuel for my body, and it's all without coffee or crashes throughout the day! I'm genuinely shocked.

My whole life, I used to live on coffee. I'd wake up in the morning needing a cup just to open my eyes, and midday, I'd need another one so I wouldn't crash from exhaustion. After lunch? Forget about it, I'd fall into a food coma and just want to sleep anywhere. I always told myself, ""This is just normal, everyone gets tired like this."" I was just pushing myself through life.

When I started keto, of course, my main goal was weight loss and improving my health. But what I didn't expect was the transformation in my energy. Gradually, I started waking up feeling energised in the morning, without needing coffee right away. All day long, there are no ""sugar crashes"" or sudden feelings of exhaustion after eating. My energy is continuous and strangely stable, like I'm running on a battery that never runs out.

It's such a weird and liberating feeling at the same time. It's like my body was always operating at half power, and now it's discovered its full strength.

Has keto done this for everyone's energy? Has anyone else felt like they discovered a 'secret fuel' like this? And what's the most surprising thing about this change for you?",2,1752855079.0,keto,0,1.0,False

I just got test results back for mold, and I have high markers of inflammation. I'd also cheated right before the bloodwork, so that could also be an issue (not planning on doing that again btw).

My doctor wants me to go more ketovore/low oxalate keto. I'm not entirely sure I want to do that. I don't think adding vegetables in is going to make me better in the slightest but carnivore by itself also isn't doing it either.

Physical health seems to be improving, and AuDHD sensory overwhelm and visual processing is improving. Skin is glowing. But my mental health (exacerbated by CSA in infancy, scapegoat trauma, being blamed for causing twin's learning disability at birth by my mom who abused me). I don't want to go into too many other details, but trauma has been a huge part of my life. It followed me for years, and kind of still does impact me today.

We're going to be having a mold inspector to the house.

My B12 was also very low, so I may consider adding in Enzymes to see if this helps me absorb nutrients. I used to need pancreatic enzymes, and I think I may need some enzymes to help me better absorb the nutrients in this diet. Folate and D3 also low.

For those who have mold issues, or who need to supplement, what did you do? She wants me doing activated charcoal, liposomal B12, a liver support supplement, and Methlyfolate

She's recommending thousands of dollars worth of supplements and I just can't do that shit again.

My son is 10 months old, and I just moved his pack n play into our guest bedroom because it is darker to do day naps. This was literally just yesterday, so today is the first day doing naps in this room. I just moved his camera into the room last night so it would be ready to go today…

I put him down once he started looking sleepy, and he immediately assumed the sleeping position so I left and closed the door. I go downstairs to get some coffee and I hear him laughing….

I look at the camera, and he is ducking up and down like he’s playing peek a boo with someone. There are orbs EVERYWHERE, and then one orb repetitively kept doing the same motion back and forth, over and over. This wasn’t dust moving across the screen, it was returning to the same places almost like it was mimicking him. And he was following it ducking up and down and laughing. It eventually looked partly like an outline of a torso, but clear and reflective and would transition back to looking like an orb.

I was watching in disbelief…honestly frozen for a moment like what am I witnessing. He was cracking up and smiling at it, so I know I wasn’t losing my mind seeing this thing. He was responding to it….

I didn’t feel like it meant harm or was negative, otherwise I would have busted in there and took him out. But he did eventually just sit there once it stopped and quietly was just staring at the same place, almost like he was waiting for it to return.
There were still some orbs, but not like before.

He wasn’t going to sleep, so I just took him out and closed the door.

Out of curiosity, I decided to look at the camera while the room is empty right now. Nothing. No orbs, no light, no movement, nothing. Room is quiet and I see nothing across the screen.

I messaged my husband that I was freaked out, and didn’t fully know how to explain to anyone what the heck I just witnessed…

I’m walking around the house still a little shaken and watching my back lol. 

This house is brand new, we just built it a couple of years ago so we have been the only owners. My parents are passed, and my close uncle just recently passed last year with cancer suddenly.

I’m not sure if I should be worried, or these are just friendly energies around him.

Caked in red mud and half-sunken in moss, it looked like something the forest had spit out. The search and rescue team brought it to me in a clear plastic bag, like a piece of crime scene evidence. I remember staring at it for a long time, numb.

“It could’ve been an animal,” one of them said gently. “We’ll keep looking.”

They never found the rest of him.

Two weeks passed. I mourned him like he was dead. Screamed into the woods, smashed plates, tried to picture life after Colin. Our dog, Bishop, stopped eating. He would just sit and stare at the tree line, growling. One night, I woke up to find him pacing the bedroom, whining like he was trying to warn me. Or maybe... warn me that something was already here.

Then Colin came out of the forest. I was in the kitchen, pouring cold coffee, when Bishop lost it. Growling. Hair on end. The kind of growl that comes from something ancient and buried deep.

I ran outside and there he was. My husband. Standing at the forest’s edge. Thin. Caked in mud. Smiling.

He didn’t say a word. I ran to him. Hugged him. He was freezing. Silent. That smile never left his face, not even when I cried into his shoulder and begged him to tell me what happened. Not even when Bishop lunged at him and I had to drag the dog away, kicking and snarling.

We didn’t call the police. I couldn’t lose him again. I know it sounds insane, but pain makes miracles feel like reason. He didn’t speak at all that first day. Just smiled. Watched. Showered. Slept. Stared.

I made him steak for dinner, his favorite. He sniffed it, turned pale, gagged. Asked for berries instead. Only red berries. His voice was flat. Like he’d learned to talk by copying a recording. I gave them to him. He devoured them.

That night, I woke to a click. The lamp. I turned and saw him. Squatting at the foot of the bed. Not sitting. Squatting. Perfectly balanced. His spine arched like a spider, hands pressed into the mattress. I started researching. Missing hikers. Forest folklore. Skinwalkers. Fae. Possession. Doppelgängers. Nothing fit. Nothing explained why the birds had gone silent around our house. Or why the lights flickered whenever he walked by.

Then I found the notebook. It was hidden in his hiking backpack. Soaked. Mud-stained. Warped and swollen but still readable. The notes stopped abruptly two weeks ago. The day he vanished. The last few pages were… different.

**Day 6**

I found something. Or it found me. A clearing full of bones. Arranged in spirals. No birds. No insects. I felt watched. Left quickly.

**Day 7**

Whispers. Can’t sleep. Something’s following me. Not footsteps — shapes. Shadows in the trees. Eyes in the bark.

**Day 8**

I saw it. God help me. It was me. Another me. Smiling. No eyes. Just holes. I ran.

**Day 9**

It won’t let me leave. It knows me. It speaks with my voice. Says things only I should know.

**Day 10**

It offered me a trade. 

And then, scrawled sideways in frantic handwriting at the very bottom of the last page: I’m sorry, Emily. I didn’t want to die. 

My blood turned to ice. That night, I confronted him. Or… it.

“Where’s my husband?” I asked.

He blinked.

“I’m right here,” he said, looking confused. “Don’t you love me?”

“You’re not him.”

He smiled wider than any human should be able to. Lips stretching too far, revealing too many teeth.

“You’re right,” he whispered. “But I remember everything about him. And about you. I wear him well, don’t I?”

I ran.

I locked myself in the guest room and cried into Bishop’s fur. Outside the door, I heard him pacing the hallway. Whispering. Sometimes laughing. Sometimes growling low, animal-like.

At dawn, silence. He was gone. I should’ve left then. But I was stuck, chained to the house by fear… and a sick kind of hope. What if there was a way to bring Colin back? What if there was a ritual? A reversal? Something?

The next night, I heard singing. From the forest. Not words—tones. Notes that vibrated in my bones. Bishop crawled under the bed and stayed there, trembling.

I opened the window just a crack and I saw them. Shapes. Not just Colin. Others. Pale. Tall. Smiling. Dancing between the trees. Twisting. Imitating. And I recognized them. My high school boyfriend. My dead sister. My mother.

But none of them were real. And then I saw him. Or what had once been Colin. He saw me too. Tilted his head. And waved.

I slammed the window shut.

In the morning, I drove into town. Found a woman who ran an herb shop—ancient as dust, part Mi’kmaq. I told her everything. She didn’t even blink.

“You didn’t bury his clothes, did you?”

“…What?”

“They took his name. His skin. You left the door open, dear. You fed it.”

“I didn’t know…”

“They never just take someone,” she said. “They offer a choice. The forest doesn’t waste. It recycles. And it’s always hungry.”

“Can I stop it? Bring him back?”

“No. But you can starve it.”

That night, I left the door open again. Candles. Salt. Meat. His favorite song playing softly on the radio. A trail leading from the forest to our bedroom. A trap but backwards.

He mocked it. I crouched again at the edge of the bed.

“Do you forgive me?” he asked.

I nodded. Slowly. My hand slipped beneath the sheets, wrapping around the iron rod hidden there.

“I missed you,” he whispered.

I waited. Let him move closer. Let him whisper about how my skin still “smelled the same.” Let him reach out with those pale, stretching fingers.

Then I struck. The rod drove through his shoulder. He screamed—a sound not made for human lungs—raw, animal, unholy. And then his face… opened. Not torn. Split like something inside was trying to claw its way out of Colin’s mask.

I ran as fast as I could. Locked the bedroom. Hid in the attic. He howled. The whole house shook. Then came silence.

He’s still here. Some nights, I hear him just outside the attic door. Other nights, he dances with the others in the forest. Once, I saw Bishop watching too. Tail tucked tight, eyes wide, trembling.

Colin’s body is decomposing. But he isn’t. He’s still thin. Still pale. Still smiling. And he still remembers everything. Even now, when I cry, I hear him whispering through the vents:

“Don’t you love me anymore?”

I sleep during the day. Eat very little. Bishop never leaves my side. The forest has started creeping closer. Vines curling up the porch, moss spreading across the windows. They want me to open the door again. But I won’t.

I’ve learned something lives in those woods. Something worse than death. And sometimes…it wears the face of the person you love most.",5,1752854806.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Initially seemed supportive.  
  
It's been a while now, and here you can see me sending of a pic of my Zoloft prescription. I've been taking the time this summer to work out my mental health issues with a psychologist and got referred to a psychiatrist for anxiety. His response was to tell me I don't actually have mental health problems, 'I'm dragging it', then immediately brought up and embarrassing social interaction.  I actually called him immediately after he texted me with that and he began berating me and downing me for seeing a girl who goes to a nearby university, asking if she was dumb and saying stuff like ""\_\_\_ uni in 2025"". Joking that I found love, disregarding what I'm trying to say, etc. He even told me the girl texted him that directly and he replied with ""I believe it"". ""I believe it."" Wow. I find that genuinely insane. I replied ""I did not like that"" in reference to the call I had with him minutes after it ended.

Context: I once complimented a woman's dress at our late night school diner. I said ""I like your dress"" in conversation and she seemed uncomfortable and awkwardly said thanks so I just left.

  
Bobby has been escalating this sort of behavior recently as well, replying ""you're mentally insane"" to a random tweet I made about a coffee and a joint(thc + anxiety, i am well aware). 

Am I overreacting or is this manipulative?  
This is not the first time Bobby has exhibited manipulative or deceitful behavior with me or friends. It seems as though he is constantly provoking and perpetually negative. At least to me.

1m365k6,https://www.reddit.com/r/scifiwriting/comments/1m365k6/rough_draft_chapter_3_of_my_historical_fiction/,Rough draft Chapter 3 of my Historical Fiction Novel,"Florida Coast, 1812

England is at war with America and France. Corporal Gideon, a British marine and former slave, has spent weeks preparing for the dangerous mission assigned to his ship. Now, with the mission only days away, he’s been unexpectedly summoned to the Captain’s quarters…

CHAPTER 3

In minutes time I was in my best scarlet coat, tight gators and stocks, my sidearm, bayonet hilt and buttons gleaming, at the door of the Captain’s Cabin. His steward appeared to escort me inside, with a grudging nod to the perfect military splendor of my uniform as he did so.

“And don’t address the Captain without he speaks to you first,” he said, a fully dispensable statement.

Captain Chevers was not alone. He was speaking with Commerce’s 1st and 2nd  Lieutenants, his clerk and Major Low, whose red jacket stood out among the others’ gold-laced blue. There was another man I didn’t know, a gray bearded visitor from the town, scarred and powerfully built but clearly a gentleman of some standing.

The Captain’s desk had been expanded by great sea chests on either side, and across this entire surface lay a series of broad navigational charts.

“If the Dutch truly have sent a heavy privateer into these waters,” said Captain Chevers, “there’s no guarantee we cross paths. They’re not, as you said, looking for us or even aware of our presence.”

“We might anchor far out until she’s surely past us,” said the 1st Lieutenant. “A week or less and we take the cape on the next tide.”

“I’m afraid that won’t do,” said the bearded gentleman, “That would mean her cargo of gold falling into Creek hands. As I’ve said, it’s of the first importance that we intercept this payment and deliver it to our Seminole allies instead.”

“I’m sure you’re right, sir,” said Chevers. “In any event my orders clearly state the words ‘All Possible Haste.’ No, we can’t divert unless this Dutch vessel bears up with her gun ports open wide, in which case there’s no honor lost in our running away; ours being a considerably smaller ship. But we must see her first and above all she must make as if to engage. Until then I intend to carry out the Admiral’s direct written instructions.”

Through the ensuing discussion, during which time I maintained the rigid, silent complacency expected from one of my rank, it became clear that the old gentleman was involved with British intelligence, that his department was not asking Captain Chevers to risk his ship and the Admiral’s displeasure on a yardarm-to-yardarm engagement with the heavier Dutch Vessel, and that, knowing some of our Marines had escaped plantations adjacent to Indian territory, he would be most grateful if we obliged him with a scout.

“The gold we expect to be unloaded at some quiet inlet,” he said. “From there to travel by river, guarded by a small crew of mercenaries until the handoff with Chief Musko. Our intention is to ambush the shipment inland, between these two points.”

Since the word “Scout” the cabin’s attention gradually turned my way, and now I felt the full force of its many gazes on me: Chevers, the ship’s commander, concerned that the question he would ask might cause some offense. Major Low, concerned with my answer and professional conduct in the Captain’s presence; the Lieutenants, concerned about the Dutch frigate, and the old man, who wore an unexpectedly warm and friendly smile.

He said, “Is this your man?” And stepping around the desk offered me a strong calloused hand. “Ate ease, Corporal.”

Major Low offered a quick glance, a permissive tilt of the head no one but myself could have noticed.

I saluted and removed my hat, taking the old man’s hand and returning its full pressure, no small feat.

“Corporal Gideon,” said Chevers, “This is Major-General Sir James Nichols. He’s requested to take you into temporarily under his command for some close inshore work.”

I recognized the name at once. Back on Tangier Island, my drill instructors had spoken of James Nichols in reverent tones, that most famous of Royal Marine Officers whose valiant exploits over a long and bloody career had elevated him to something of legendary status throughout the fleet.

Even the ship’s surgeon, an outspoken critic of the British military as exploiters of destitute, able-bodied youths fleeing slavery, once grudgingly admitted that Sir Nichols’ political efforts as an abolitionist led to thousands of former slaves being granted asylum on British soil. Protected by the laws of His Majesty King George, they could not be arrested and returned to their owners as rightful property.

It was this same dreadful possibility that was to blame for the Captain’s nervousness. He had no notion of politics by land, and so far as it did not diminish a man’s ability to perform his duty on ship he had no real notion of race, either. Discussing what he perceived as a sensitive issue must have put him strangely out of his depth.

“There’s a great deal of risk in this scouting business, you understand, Corporal?” Said Chevers, “Additional risk to you, personally. Were you to be captured you’d not be treated fairly as a Prisoner of War, entitled to the rights of such…” He trailed off, feeling his line of thought was already on dangerous shoals.

“Of course, Major Low insisted you’d be delighted to volunteer,” said Sir Nichols with a wry look, “But I must hear it from you.”

I hadn’t thought of the miserable old plantation for weeks, maybe longer. “Be a good marine”had a way of keeping my full attention these days. But now in a flash my mind raced back along childhood paths, through tangled processions of forest, plantation, and marsh, seemingly endless until they plunged into the wide Congaree River, and beyond that, the truly wild country.

Then came predictable memories of Abigail, the house slave born to the plantation the same year as I, how we explored those paths together, and how later as lovers we absconded to many a pre-discovered hideout familiar to us alone.

It suddenly occurred to me that they were waiting on my answer. Sir Nichols had been graciously filling the interim of my reverie with remarks to the effect that there was no pressing danger of such a capture, that his intelligence on the shipment had been verified at the highest levels - a most reliable source - and that he had a regiment of highlanders on station to carry out the ambush itself. But finally he could stall no longer. “Well, what do you say, Corporal?”

“If you please, Sir,” I said, “I…should be most grateful.”

A tangible sense of relief flooded the cabin at these words.

“There you have it!” said Captain Chevers. To his clerk: “Mr Blythe, please note Corporal Gideon to temporarily detach and join the highland company at Spitshead. And gentleman, let us remind ourselves that none of this takes place if the Admiral doesn’t first get his shore battery and gunboats. Now, where in God’s name is Mr. Dangerfield with our coffee?”",1,1752854326.0,scifiwriting,0,1.0,False

Here is what I do:

•	⁠switching on
•	⁠starting to blow out rest water and having steam on temperature
•	⁠switching off
•	⁠putting steam outlet slightly into milk
•	⁠switching on

Hundreds of bright pink birds standing gracefully in the shallow waters is a sight you’ll never forget. But when I finally visited, I realized the place has so much more to offer.

We booked a private boat tour early in the morning, and besides flamingos we saw crocodiles sunbathing, herons and pelicans everywhere, and even dolphins further out near the sea. The boat guide took us through narrow mangrove channels, and at one point we stopped to do the mayan clay mask covering ourselves in natural white clay from the salt flats and then washing it off in the warm, shallow water.

What really made it special, though, was the peace and quiet. By going early and with a private guide, we avoided the noisy crowds and got to linger wherever we wanted. Someone on a forum had suggested arranging everything in advance and even recommended STP Caribe for the transfer. They said their driver picked them up at dawn, with coffee and snacks ready that made the whole experience effortless and way more relaxing.

Some are crumpled in my wallet

Others are just random screenshots in my camera roll


By the time I sit down to file taxes or check where my money actually went… it’s pure chaos.

I’ve tried Excel, Notion, and even some expense tracking apps - but they either take too much effort or don’t fit my casual spending habits (like coffee runs, freelance gigs, SaaS tools......).

So now I’m building something stupidly simple!

You just snap or email a receipt, and AI does the rest
 - organizes and summarizes it all, like a personal bookkeeper for your inbox + wallet.



Even cooler...

You can WhatsApp the receipt to a bot, and it files it neatly in your Google Drive.

It even syncs with Gmail to auto-track receipts from your inbox.


I’m calling it Quickfin.

They are basically full grown cats now, but they are still adorable. One of them, though, is a holy terror. He was so sweet when I met him in December and when I brought him home a few weeks later. He's still sweet, but he's so aggressive and has not learned where he shouldn't be. His name is Joey and he is very playful and full of energy. Joey also climbs on everything, has broken dishes and electronics, and randomly bites me and other people. 

This morning, I was boiling water on the stove in my kettle and Joey, as usual, climbed up on the kitchen counter and walked right over to the kettle and my pour over coffee maker. He's sticking his face in everything, like he does because he is very curious. I say ""No, Joey"" in a firm, but not loud, voice, lift him off of the counter and place him on the ground next to me. He proceeds to jump onto my bare legs in a bear hug and starts biting me and kicking me with his back legs. I pried him off, but he jumped back on and starts doing the same thing as before. This time he isn't budging, so, I'm ashamed to admit, I grabbed him by the scruff and pulled him off. I had to run away from him. Separate. Eventually he forgot about me and went to do something else.

As I am writing this, he has climbed on chest and settled in there. He's a cuddler, too. He's very sweet. I don't know what to do with him, though. My SO borderline hates him, and we in the process of moving in together. My other kitten seems to be both scared of him and eager to see what kind of shenanigans he's into so he can participate or at least watch. The other kitten is perfect. He doesn't get into to trouble, break stuff, or bite. The only thing he does that I don't like is chew on cords. Joey, though. I'm kind of at my wits end with him. I can't keep off of the kitchen counter. I can't keep him out of my food. He plays way too rough, and he's very bitey. What can I do? I am worried that I'm going to get upset and try to give him away or take him to the animal shelter. I love cats and I love him, but I need to find a way to work with Joey so we can live in peace.

It fucking sucks because it costs money. Those tablets are still kind of cheap, but yet, it still sucks to buy them so often. I have such headaches because of the withdrawal that I have to take co-codamol (codeine-paracetamol pills) in order to just sleep, it's like ripping the flesh out of my forehead and draining me of all the energy and motivation.",1,1752854083.0,decaf,2,1.0,False

Back here in Phoenix, I can't quite find a spot that feels like that. I know we don’t have the ocean, obviously—but is there anywhere in the valley that has that kind of vibe?

This hits me especially hard when I’m digging for receipts to claim reimbursements 🥲

Some are buried in email

Some are crumpled in my wallet

Others are just random screenshots in my camera roll


By the time I sit down to file taxes or check where my money actually went… it’s pure chaos.

I’ve tried Excel, Notion, and even some expense tracking apps - but they either take too much effort or don’t fit my casual spending habits (like coffee runs, freelance gigs, SaaS tools......).

So now I’m building something stupidly simple!

You just snap or email a receipt, and AI does the rest
 - organizes and summarizes it all, like a personal bookkeeper for your inbox + wallet.



Even cooler...

You can WhatsApp the receipt to a bot, and it files it neatly in your Google Drive.

It even syncs with Gmail to auto-track receipts from your inbox.


I’m calling it Quickfin.

Not selling anything — just curious if anyone else feels this pain too before I commit too deep.

Would this actually help you? How are you handling this mess today?

Would genuinely love to hear your experience 🙏

Been digging into some consumer trends and found a gem hiding in plain sight: **Rooibos tea**.

If you're not familiar, it's a naturally sweet, earthy, caffeine-free tea from South Africa. For years it's been a niche health food store item, but the data shows it's quietly going mainstream in a big way.

The numbers are pretty wild. Search interest for Rooibos is up **123% year-over-year**. It’s tapping into the huge ""caffeine-conscious"" and wellness movements. People want flavorful alternatives to coffee without the jitters, and Rooibos fits perfectly. (See the graph below) :

[Search volume data in the last 5 years](https://preview.redd.it/albcxwhnmndf1.png?width=1768&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcbc79969d104159f3fb48a62a5c838a40ac7842)

And this isn't some tiny niche – it's already a **$1.34 billion global market** and growing steadily.

One big player in the space is a brand called **Numi Organic Tea**.

They're not just selling tea; they're selling an experience. Numi makes their money by offering premium, organic Rooibos blends (think unique flavors like Rooibos Chai or vanilla).

They leverage the ""better-for-you"" trend, appealing to health-conscious consumers willing to pay more for quality and ethical sourcing. While exact figures for Numi aren't public, they're a significant player in the specialty tea market, which commands premium pricing within this billion-dollar industry.

They get traffic by focusing on their organic certifications, the story behind their teas, and strong distribution online, in health food stores, and even mainstream supermarkets. They also likely benefit from consumers actively seeking out unique, healthier beverage options.

The play here seems to be a dedicated DTC brand focusing on quality and unique blends (like Rooibos chai). Or, think B2B – convincing local cafes to offer a ""Rooibos Latte"" as a cool, caffeine-free alternative on their menu.

The only catch? The entire world's supply comes from one small region in South Africa, so the supply chain is a bit fragile.

England is at war with America and France. Corporal Gideon, a British marine and former slave, has spent weeks preparing for the dangerous mission assigned to his ship. Now, with the mission only days away, he’s been unexpectedly summoned to the Captain’s quarters…

CHAPTER 3

In minutes time I was in my best scarlet coat, tight gators and stocks, my sidearm, bayonet hilt and buttons gleaming, at the door of the Captain’s Cabin. His steward appeared to escort me inside, with a grudging nod to the perfect military splendor of my uniform as he did so.

“And don’t address the Captain without he speaks to you first,” he said, a fully dispensable statement.

Captain Chevers was not alone. He was speaking with Commerce’s 1st and 2nd  Lieutenants, his clerk and Major Low, whose red jacket stood out among the others’ gold-laced blue. There was another man I didn’t know, a gray bearded visitor from the town, scarred and powerfully built but clearly a gentleman of some standing.

The Captain’s desk had been expanded by great sea chests on either side, and across this entire surface lay a series of broad navigational charts.

“If the Dutch truly have sent a heavy privateer into these waters,” said Captain Chevers, “there’s no guarantee we cross paths. They’re not, as you said, looking for us or even aware of our presence.”

“We might anchor far out until she’s surely past us,” said the 1st Lieutenant. “A week or less and we take the cape on the next tide.”

“I’m afraid that won’t do,” said the bearded gentleman, “That would mean her cargo of gold falling into Creek hands. As I’ve said, it’s of the first importance that we intercept this payment and deliver it to our Seminole allies instead.”

“I’m sure you’re right, sir,” said Chevers. “In any event my orders clearly state the words ‘All Possible Haste.’ No, we can’t divert unless this Dutch vessel bears up with her gun ports open wide, in which case there’s no honor lost in our running away; ours being a considerably smaller ship. But we must see her first and above all she must make as if to engage. Until then I intend to carry out the Admiral’s direct written instructions.”

Through the ensuing discussion, during which time I maintained the rigid, silent complacency expected from one of my rank, it became clear that the old gentleman was involved with British intelligence, that his department was not asking Captain Chevers to risk his ship and the Admiral’s displeasure on a yardarm-to-yardarm engagement with the heavier Dutch Vessel, and that, knowing some of our Marines had escaped plantations adjacent to Indian territory, he would be most grateful if we obliged him with a scout.

“The gold we expect to be unloaded at some quiet inlet,” he said. “From there to travel by river, guarded by a small crew of mercenaries until the handoff with Chief Musko. Our intention is to ambush the shipment inland, between these two points.”

Since the word “Scout” the cabin’s attention gradually turned my way, and now I felt the full force of its many gazes on me: Chevers, the ship’s commander, concerned that the question he would ask might cause some offense. Major Low, concerned with my answer and professional conduct in the Captain’s presence; the Lieutenants, concerned about the Dutch frigate, and the old man, who wore an unexpectedly warm and friendly smile.

He said, “Is this your man?” And stepping around the desk offered me a strong calloused hand. “Ate ease, Corporal.”

Major Low offered a quick glance, a permissive tilt of the head no one but myself could have noticed.

I saluted and removed my hat, taking the old man’s hand and returning its full pressure, no small feat.

“Corporal Gideon,” said Chevers, “This is Major-General Sir James Nichols. He’s requested to take you into temporarily under his command for some close inshore work.”

I recognized the name at once. Back on Tangier Island, my drill instructors had spoken of James Nichols in reverent tones, that most famous of Royal Marine Officers whose valiant exploits over a long and bloody career had elevated him to something of legendary status throughout the fleet.

Even the ship’s surgeon, an outspoken critic of the British military as exploiters of destitute, able-bodied youths fleeing slavery, once grudgingly admitted that Sir Nichols’ political efforts as an abolitionist led to thousands of former slaves being granted asylum on British soil. Protected by the laws of His Majesty King George, they could not be arrested and returned to their owners as rightful property.

It was this same dreadful possibility that was to blame for the Captain’s nervousness. He had no notion of politics by land, and so far as it did not diminish a man’s ability to perform his duty on ship he had no real notion of race, either. Discussing what he perceived as a sensitive issue must have put him strangely out of his depth.

“There’s a great deal of risk in this scouting business, you understand, Corporal?” Said Chevers, “Additional risk to you, personally. Were you to be captured you’d not be treated fairly as a Prisoner of War, entitled to the rights of such…” He trailed off, feeling his line of thought was already on dangerous shoals.

“Of course, Major Low insisted you’d be delighted to volunteer,” said Sir Nichols with a wry look, “But I must hear it from you.”

I hadn’t thought of the miserable old plantation for weeks, maybe longer. “Be a good marine”had a way of keeping my full attention these days. But now in a flash my mind raced back along childhood paths, through tangled processions of forest, plantation, and marsh, seemingly endless until they plunged into the wide Congaree River, and beyond that, the truly wild country.

Then came predictable memories of Abigail, the house slave born to the plantation the same year as I, how we explored those paths together, and how later as lovers we absconded to many a pre-discovered hideout familiar to us alone.

It suddenly occurred to me that they were waiting on my answer. Sir Nichols had been graciously filling the interim of my reverie with remarks to the effect that there was no pressing danger of such a capture, that his intelligence on the shipment had been verified at the highest levels - a most reliable source - and that he had a regiment of highlanders on station to carry out the ambush itself. But finally he could stall no longer. “Well, what do you say, Corporal?”

“If you please, Sir,” I said, “I…should be most grateful.”

A tangible sense of relief flooded the cabin at these words.

“There you have it!” said Captain Chevers. To his clerk: “Mr Blythe, please note Corporal Gideon to temporarily detach and join the highland company at Spitshead. And gentleman, let us remind ourselves that none of this takes place if the Admiral doesn’t first get his shore battery and gunboats. Now, where in God’s name is Mr. Dangerfield with our coffee?”",1,1752853918.0,flashfiction,0,1.0,False

 \#Cooking #ElenaSunshineMagazine #Healthy #HowTo #Lifestyle #mental #Women

How do you lift your mood when you need to relieve stress? Do you buy cakes or a bar of chocolate to eat in one sitting, like an apple? There are ways to please yourself without resorting to food for consolation. Maybe you will also find something [useful](https://elenasunshinemagazine.com/mental-health/methods-of-getting-rid-of-anxiety-quickly-and-effectively/) in them. 

**#1. Make a list: what makes you feel happy?**

You can sketch on paper in your spare time: funny bright socks, floral dresses, jump, run, joke. When I hear a smile on the phone, when a nice person hugs me tightly, or, conversely, I hug him. Large knitted cardigans, pink things (or red, yellow, in general, the one you like at the [moment](https://elenasunshinemagazine.medium.com/how-to-meet-autumn-with-a-great-and-cheerful-mood-8376777a61fd?source=user_profile---------27----------------------------)). Feed the pigeons, play with the cat, light candles, water the flowers, and sit on the balcony or on the sofa with a book. And look at the street, listening to the rain on the roof. Keep the list handy and in a difficult moment choose [something](https://elenasunshinemagazine.medium.com/5-steps-how-to-save-energy-and-joy-of-life-b9e44a99e3ff?source=user_profile---------32----------------------------) from it to switch your thoughts to good.

https://preview.redd.it/wnblvc1vkndf1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1899cf8305ec0a7841b6fc597c8d2fb261fb2317

**#2. Ritual with a cup of tea**

It is not necessary to choke on green tea with jasmine, if you hate it, it can be hot cocoa or freshly brewed coffee. The main thing is to train yourself to perceive a way to pamper [yourself](https://elenasunshinemagazine.com/mental-health/your-path-to-wellbeing-or-how-to-optimize-your-life/), to support your strength. ""First we'll have a cup of tea/coffee, and then we'll think about what to do."" It should be something that you can look forward to all day or, conversely, dream in bed, just opening your eyes: I'm going to get up now and make my favorite jasmine tea for breakfast.

**#3. Be inspired by art**

This phrase, because it accurately reflects the purpose of trips to museums — to feel a surge of strength, to distract yourself, to look at your life from the outside, and see what is not visible in the flow of everyday life.

**#4. Flip through/ read a book**

It can be a book read- many times – open anywhere and plunge into another life. Or comics, children's books with high-class illustrations, and large books with beautiful photos. You can scroll through albums on painting and gardening, and someone is closer to ships, cars, travel, animals, calligraphy, and hand-made.

https://preview.redd.it/v8iaqorclndf1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=364cabcb527171e6d9217f3d4014f146e27f8ba7

**#5. Take a nap**

Sleep is an amazing cure for stress and fatigue, especially when you consider that 99% of us lack sleep. In addition, sleep [normalizes](https://elenasunshinemagazine.medium.com/methods-of-getting-rid-of-anxiety-quickly-and-effectively-f277bfcc5afa?source=user_profile---------16----------------------------) appetite – many feel hungry and pounce on junk food such as pastries and semi-finished products due to lack of sleep. Even a short 20-30-minute rest works wonders.

**#6. Observe people**

Watching people around and writing stories about them is a fascinating activity. Go for a walk without any purpose – just to explore the surroundings. What is the name of this serious bearded man with a Labrador whom you meet on a jog every morning? What is his profession? Where is the laughing girl with red hair going that sat opposite you in the subway? It is interesting to watch people on public transport, in cafes, at a flea market, and by and large – anywhere. On a walk, we feel in the flow of life and are energized by communication, even if it is a fleeting exchange of glances or a smile with a stranger.

# #7. Watch an instructional video on Youtube, Choose

what is closer: makeup lessons (for example, a skin cleansing ritual from a Japanese cosmetologist), yoga, dancing, or origami? The main thing is to make it interesting and fun for you. Let you not master sirtaki or twerk, but relieve stress, dissolve it in laughter and pleasant emotions.

**#8. Make the bed with new bedlinen**

The smell of freshly ironed sheets and a duvet cover can't be compared to anything, it's so cozy, and making a bed with new bedding is an [activity](https://elenasunshinemagazine.com/mental-health/how-to-find-emotional-balance/) akin to meditation, calms, relaxes, fills with anticipation of something joyful, reminds mom and grandma's affectionate touches, care.

**#9. Self-consolation**

A much more effective means is self—consolation. Choose an upholstered chair or sit on soft pillows – so as to create maximum comfort. Now wrap your arms around yourself, gently, gently – hug yourself.

Focus on your feelings from this embrace. If they are positive, then try to strengthen them by hugging yourself tighter, cradling yourself in your own arms, or stroking your head. Stay in this state as long as you feel comfortable. Try to say something comforting, and gentle to yourself. It may seem strange, silly, or even annoying. It's not a big deal. Keep doing this until you feel comfortable and relaxed.

Even the ship’s surgeon, an outspoken critic of the British military as exploiters of destitute, able-bodied youths fleeing slavery, once grudgingly admitted that Sir Nichols’ political efforts as an abolitionist led to thousands of former slaves being granted asylum on British soil. Protected by the laws of His Majesty King George, they could not be arrested and returned to their owners as rightful property.

It was this same dreadful possibility that was to blame for the Captain’s nervousness. He had no notion of politics by land, and so far as it did not diminish a man’s ability to perform his duty on ship he had no real notion of race, either. Discussing what he perceived as a sensitive issue must have put him strangely out of his depth.

“There’s a great deal of risk in this scouting business, you understand, Corporal?” Said Chevers, “Additional risk to you, personally. Were you to be captured you’d not be treated fairly as a Prisoner of War, entitled to the rights of such…” He trailed off, feeling his line of thought was already on dangerous shoals.

“Of course, Major Low insisted you’d be delighted to volunteer,” said Sir Nichols with a wry look, “But I must hear it from you.”

I hadn’t thought of the miserable old plantation for weeks, maybe longer. “Be a good marine”had a way of keeping my full attention these days. But now in a flash my mind raced back along childhood paths, through tangled processions of forest, plantation, and marsh, seemingly endless until they plunged into the wide Congaree River, and beyond that, the truly wild country.

Then came predictable memories of Abigail, the house slave born to the plantation the same year as I, how we explored those paths together, and how later as lovers we absconded to many a pre-discovered hideout familiar to us alone.

It suddenly occurred to me that they were waiting on my answer. Sir Nichols had been graciously filling the interim of my reverie with remarks to the effect that there was no pressing danger of such a capture, that his intelligence on the shipment had been verified at the highest levels - a most reliable source - and that he had a regiment of highlanders on station to carry out the ambush itself. But finally he could stall no longer. “Well, what do you say, Corporal?”

“If you please, Sir,” I said, “I…should be most grateful.”

A tangible sense of relief flooded the cabin at these words.

“There you have it!” said Captain Chevers. To his clerk: “Mr Blythe, please note Corporal Gideon to temporarily detach and join the highland company at Spitshead.

England is at war with America and France. Corporal Gideon, a British marine and former slave, has spent weeks preparing for the dangerous mission assigned to his ship. Now, with the mission only days away, he’s been unexpectedly summoned to the Captain’s quarters…

CHAPTER 3

In minutes time I was in my best scarlet coat, tight gators and stocks, my sidearm, bayonet hilt and buttons gleaming, at the door of the Captain’s Cabin. His steward appeared to escort me inside, with a grudging nod to the perfect military splendor of my uniform as he did so.

“And don’t address the Captain without he speaks to you first,” he said, a fully dispensable statement.

Captain Chevers was not alone. He was speaking with Commerce’s 1st and 2nd  Lieutenants, his clerk and Major Low, whose red jacket stood out among the others’ gold-laced blue. There was another man I didn’t know, a gray bearded visitor from the town, scarred and powerfully built but clearly a gentleman of some standing.

The Captain’s desk had been expanded by great sea chests on either side, and across this entire surface lay a series of broad navigational charts.

“If the Dutch truly have sent a heavy privateer into these waters,” said Captain Chevers, “there’s no guarantee we cross paths. They’re not, as you said, looking for us or even aware of our presence.”

“We might anchor far out until she’s surely past us,” said the 1st Lieutenant. “A week or less and we take the cape on the next tide.”

“I’m afraid that won’t do,” said the bearded gentleman, “That would mean her cargo of gold falling into Creek hands. As I’ve said, it’s of the first importance that we intercept this payment and deliver it to our Seminole allies instead.”

“I’m sure you’re right, sir,” said Chevers. “In any event my orders clearly state the words ‘All Possible Haste.’ No, we can’t divert unless this Dutch vessel bears up with her gun ports open wide, in which case there’s no honor lost in our running away; ours being a considerably smaller ship. But we must see her first and above all she must make as if to engage. Until then I intend to carry out the Admiral’s direct written instructions.”

Through the ensuing discussion, during which time I maintained the rigid, silent complacency expected from one of my rank, it became clear that the old gentleman was involved with British intelligence, that his department was not asking Captain Chevers to risk his ship and the Admiral’s displeasure on a yardarm-to-yardarm engagement with the heavier Dutch Vessel, and that, knowing some of our Marines had escaped plantations adjacent to Indian territory, he would be most grateful if we obliged him with a scout.

“The gold we expect to be unloaded at some quiet inlet,” he said. “From there to travel by river, guarded by a small crew of mercenaries until the handoff with Chief Musko. Our intention is to ambush the shipment inland, between these two points.”

Since the word “Scout” the cabin’s attention gradually turned my way, and now I felt the full force of its many gazes on me: Chevers, the ship’s commander, concerned that the question he would ask might cause some offense. Major Low, concerned with my answer and professional conduct in the Captain’s presence; the Lieutenants, concerned about the Dutch frigate, and the old man, who wore an unexpectedly warm and friendly smile.

He said, “Is this your man?” And stepping around the desk offered me a strong calloused hand. “Ate ease, Corporal.”

Major Low offered a quick glance, a permissive tilt of the head no one but myself could have noticed.

I saluted and removed my hat, taking the old man’s hand and returning its full pressure, no small feat.

“Corporal Gideon,” said Chevers, “This is Major-General Sir James Nichols. He’s requested to take you into temporarily under his command for some close inshore work.”

This year our sex life has suffered. In time I learned to appreciate our interactions even if they aren't sexual.

1m35o6v,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1m35o6v/tough_situation/,Tough situation,"I have been with my significant other for nearly 12 years now. He is an amazing friend, a hard worker, and responsible with his money and is always there for me. He lets me have and do whatever I want from my owns finances and doesn’t judge me on it. I am responsible with it. He doesn’t care what I do as long as I am getting my work done. We are very busy with our careers and spend everyday together when not at work. He is loyal, and tells me his thoughts.  

The problem is he has a temper and will blow up on me on occasion. Once in the past I left for 2 weeks, and another time I almost left. Now I’m feeling like I’m throwing in the towel because this last year when he gets angry he says he wants to hit me. Sometimes he even raises his hand like he is going to then stops himself. I feel like this is my line in the sand of unacceptable. When he gets angry I never retaliate and shut down, if he yells at me for a extended time that’s when I break down and start to cry, and he says “oh now your doing your play”. When he begins threatening me I “ugly cry” and will start shaking. He tells me he feels bad telling at me but apparently I like it because I keep screwing up. 

The last time he blew up it was because I didn’t do the 3 dishes in the sink, he asked “you couldn’t do these couple in this morning?”. I told him I was very busy and running late and decided to do them when I got home, then he went off about how I could be so busy that I couldn’t do just three dishes. I believe it was a coffee mug, spoon, and cat bowl. I then said “it’s only three dishes so I thought it would be ok to do them when I got home”. This is the point his temper snapped and he spent 35 minutes yelling at how stupid I was and listed everything I do wrong. It’s so emotionally painful for me when he does this. Most days I do make sure the few dishes are always done, and if not I make it a point to get him before him to get it done before he’s there. 

I know he realizes this is wrong, but seems to think what I do is wrong enough that it makes this apparently justified. He has told me he hates yelling at me. He tries to hold his temper in check until he just snaps. After years of this I know I have some PTSD of making him angry. Honestly I could live with the yelling because our lives and work are so incredibly linked and I love my home and property so much. But the threat of being hit is just not ok. 

I also love him very much. He is an incredible person and I love his family. I had high hopes getting his blood sugar and blood pressure under control that it would help his outburst. This actually has helped and he is angry less often but doesn’t make the times he is angry acceptable. By the way he also treats his family the same way, and also his friends. Just they don’t live with him so there is a lot less reasons for him to get mad about stuff, some friends he’s never been angry at because they have never done anything apparently offensive to him. 

 Currently I feel like I am at the end of the road and throwing in the towel. It’s so hard though because the good times are SO good. The thought of loosing all security in my life is very scary. Leaving him I honestly don’t know where life will take me. I still have a career in my field and potentially could still work with him but everything else is up in the air. 

One thing to note, I Know the verbal abuse is unacceptable but I do believe he doesn’t do this to be cruel. It seems to be reactions due to his poor anger management. I can see this as I watch his patience with his family and friend in the occasions he gets mad at them. It seems like he slowly becomes completely over stimulated and this is when he explodes. My mother was a social worker for many years before she tragically lost her battle with cancer and passed a way and we loved talking about how the human brain works. Unfortunately he uses words as weapons and calls me names, and makes me feel like a very small person. 

I would really like to hear from anyone who may have found themselves in a similar situation. Is there any hope or is this something that is never going to change. 

One additional note 

- when I tell him it’s verbally abuses how he talks to me he retaliates and says what I do is abusive towards him so when I stop messing up and get my stuff done correctly he’ll stop yelling at me and calling me names. I tell him the difference is my mess ups are pure accidents or having so much to do I forget something. On the other hand his is done with the intention to hurt my feelings.

- The few physical things he has done, grabbed my arm or hand to tightly several times when angry, only once held me by my pony tail and yelled in my face, poked me hard enough in the sternum I exhaled my breath, pinched me on the leg and asked if he pinched me all the time now would I feel(comparing this to my constant mess ups). few of are doors have dents or partial holes from him hitting them, he throws stuff and breaks it. Slamming stuff he’s holding down on the counter or table. Once he threw a container of puréed pumpkin and it exploded over the entire room, closed the dishwasher so hard all the glasses shattered. 


tl;dr 
Awesome significant other during good times, degrading and poor angry management during other times with Verbal abuse. Recent threats of physical abuse during angry outburst. We share the same interest, career, have a business together, and beautiful house and property I love. I also love his family, and we are friends with all the same people.

The room shimmered with opulence, a sea of satin gowns and tailored tuxedos gliding under the chandeliers. I stood at the center, my heart a steady drum as I took in the grandeur of the Plaza Hotel's ballroom. This moment was supposed to be the pinnacle of my happiness, the beginning of a perfect life with Ryan Morrison.

The custom Vera Wang gown cascaded around me, a testament to the luxury I had always known. Applause erupted as Ryan stepped forward, his smile as polished as the silverware adorning each table. His speech began with the warmth of a practiced lover, words weaving dreams of our future together, promises etched in the air like a fairy tale.

Yet beneath my calm exterior, a storm brewed. A whisper of doubt had lingered in the back of my mind, a shadow in the corner that refused to disappear. But I silenced it, focusing instead on Ryan's voice, letting his declarations wrap around me like a comforting embrace.

""I stand here,"" he said, raising his glass, ""overwhelmed by love and gratitude, for the future we will build together, Isabella.""

Just as his words reached a crescendo, Ryan staggered. His glass slipped from his fingers, shattering the illusion of our perfect narrative. Gasps filled the room as he collapsed, clutching his head as if in torment. ""I... I only remember Charlotte,"" he murmured, his voice a fragile thread, breaking the spell.

Confusion crashed over me like icy waves, the ballroom hushed to silence. I could feel the eyes of Manhattan's elite boring into me, their curiosity and pity like needles. But it wasn't the spectacle of Ryan's collapse that held me captive; it was what followed.

Above the dais, unseen by anyone but me, text messages floated in the air, their letters glowing with an eerie luminescence. ""Villainous supporting character,"" they mocked, predicting my downfall with a sinister certainty. The words twisted my fate into something grotesque, a narrative I had never imagined.

I felt my heart splinter, the reality of Ryan's betrayal strangling my breath. For years, I had been blind to the manipulation, the lies masked as affection. But this supernatural revelation was undeniable, a truth that shattered the foundations of my world.

As the room buzzed with whispers and concerned glances, I stood rooted, the messages hovering like vengeful specters. They were a challenge, daring me to accept my role as the pawn in a game I hadn't known I was playing.

Yet, amidst the chaos, something within me clicked—a fierce resolve ignited by the exposure to the truth. I refused to be a victim of this insidious script, the villain in someone else's story. Determination coursed through me, a promise to rewrite the narrative they had thrust upon me.

The weight of my gown seemed lighter now, as if I was shedding the naivety that had cloaked my life. I would not be the supporting character destined for ruin. I would become the architect of my destiny, reclaim my life from the farce that had been woven around me.

Ryan lay on the floor, feigning confusion, but the messages told me everything I needed to know. His collapse was no accident; it was a calculated move, a betrayal masked as tragedy.

My decision crystallized amidst the glittering chaos. I would confront Ryan, expose his deceit, and salvage my dignity. And as the supernatural text promised my downfall, I vowed to defy it.

The evening's glamour now seemed a mockery, but I would use this moment as the catalyst for my transformation. I glanced around at the puzzled faces, the murmurs of concern, feeling the weight of my family's legacy on my shoulders.

This was my turning point.

As I turned away from the dais, the messages faded into darkness, leaving only the echo of their taunts in my mind. My heart, though battered, beat with newfound strength. I was no longer the naive heiress. I was Isabella Sterling, and I would reclaim my story, no matter the cost.

With the eyes of Manhattan upon me, I stepped forward, ready to confront the deceit and forge a path toward my own truth. The narrative would be mine to rewrite, and I would emerge victorious.

The room was still, the air thick with anticipation. As I walked away from the dais, I felt the stirrings of power within, a promise that my story was far from over.

And as the night drew to a close, I knew the real battle was just beginning.

Chapter 2

The opulence of the Plaza Hotel's grand ballroom faded into memory as I retreated to my private suite, my heels echoing against the polished marble floors. The door closed behind me with a soft click, sealing me away from the curious gazes and hushed whispers. Alone, I allowed myself a moment to feel the full weight of my humiliation, the betrayal that had unfolded before Manhattan's elite.

I sank onto the velvet chaise, the luxurious fabric cool against my skin. My heart still raced from the shock of Ryan's deceit—the staged amnesia, the supernatural messages that had mocked my role in a predetermined tragedy. But amidst the chaos and pain, a fierce resolve burned within me. I refused to be the victim, the villainous supporting character they wanted me to be.

Summoning the strength I'd unearthed in the ballroom, I picked up my phone and dialed Ethan Blake—a name I never thought would be my salvation. His voice was steady as he answered, a quiet strength beneath the surface. ""Isabella,"" he said, ""are you alright?""

""I need to meet you,"" I replied, my voice firmer than I'd expected. ""Tonight. It's urgent.""

The dimly lit hotel bar provided the perfect cloak of discretion. I arrived first, my mind a whirlwind of plans and potential pitfalls. Ethan joined me shortly, his presence a soothing balm to my frayed nerves. He settled across from me, his eyes searching mine with concern.

""Thank you for coming,"" I said, a tremor in my voice betraying my vulnerability. ""I need your help...""

Ethan leaned forward, his gaze unwavering. ""Whatever you need, Isabella,"" he promised, and in that moment, I knew I could trust him.

I took a deep breath, the air heavy with the scent of aged wood and whiskey. ""I want to propose a fake engagement,"" I declared, each word deliberate. ""To maintain my dignity, to shield myself from further humiliation.""

His silence hung between us, a testament to the audacity of my request. I watched as he absorbed the enormity of what I was asking, his expression shifting from surprise to contemplation.

""A fake engagement,"" he repeated, a hint of incredulity coloring his tone. ""And you want me to play the part?""

I nodded, my resolve unwavering. ""Ryan's deception has left me exposed. I need to show strength, to protect my family's legacy. And I believe you're the one who can help me do that.""

Ethan studied me, a myriad of emotions flickering across his face. ""Why me?"" he asked, genuine curiosity mingling with his own hidden hopes.

""Because I trust you,"" I admitted, my voice softening. ""And because I know you understand what's at stake.""

For a moment, he hesitated, the weight of the decision palpable. Then, slowly, he nodded, his resolve matching mine. ""Alright,"" he agreed, a quiet determination in his voice. ""We'll do this together.""

Relief flooded through me, a warmth that chased away the chill of betrayal. Together, we outlined the details of our arrangement, the strategy that would shield my reputation and offer a semblance of control.

Our first public appearance as a couple came quickly—a charity gala at the Waldorf Astoria. The venue buzzed with Manhattan's elite, curiosity piqued by our unexpected pairing. I clung to Ethan's arm, the façade of our engagement a delicate balance.

As we navigated the crowd, Ethan's protective glances were a lifeline. His presence beside me was a bulwark against the speculative whispers and sidelong glances. Yet, as we moved through the glittering sea of tuxedos and gowns, I felt Ryan's eyes on us, his jealousy a tangible presence.

From a corner table, Ryan watched, his gaze dark with possessiveness—not love. I met his stare head-on, a silent challenge woven into my posture. He had underestimated me, discounted my strength. And now, I was reclaiming my narrative.

The evening unfolded with a surreal grace, the tension between us and Ryan a thread woven through the air. As the gala came to a close, I knew the real battle was only beginning.

Ethan's hand on mine as we exited was a promise—a commitment to the path we'd chosen. And as the doors of the Waldorf Astoria closed behind us, I felt the stirrings of power within, a vow to rewrite the story that had been thrust upon me.

But as I stepped into the night, I couldn't shake the feeling that the floating messages would return, their warnings ever-present. What would they reveal next? The thought lingered, a shadow at the edge of my new resolve.

Chapter 3

I strode into the Sterling Enterprises boardroom with my head held high, the click of my Louboutins against marble announcing my arrival before I even pushed open the heavy oak doors. The morning light streamed through floor-to-ceiling windows, illuminating the long mahogany table where twelve board members sat waiting. My father occupied the head chair, his silver hair gleaming under the chandelier, his expression unreadable.

And there, three seats down on the right, sat Ryan Morrison.

He'd shed his amnesia act for this meeting, of course. Corporate sharks didn't have the luxury of memory loss when millions were at stake. His tailored Tom Ford suit and carefully tousled hair projected the image of a man in complete control—except for the slight tightening around his eyes when they met mine.

""Ladies and gentlemen,"" I said, sliding into my seat at my father's right hand. ""Thank you for accommodating the early start.""

My father nodded. ""Isabella will be leading the presentation on our Asian market expansion.""

I opened my portfolio with steady hands, ignoring the weight of Ryan's gaze. For three years, I'd sat beside him in these meetings, our knees occasionally touching under the table, sharing secret smiles over the rim of coffee cups. Now, the space between us crackled with unspoken accusations.

Halfway through my presentation on projected growth metrics, Ryan cleared his throat.

""These projections seem... optimistic,"" he said, his voice carrying that smooth, concerned tone he used when undermining someone. ""Given recent... events, I wonder if we should consider a more conservative approach.""

The implication hung in the air. Recent events. My public humiliation. My emotional state.

The room temperature seemed to drop ten degrees. I could feel the board members' eyes darting between us, hungry for drama.

""By recent events,"" I replied, my voice cool and measured, ""I assume you're referring to the Nikkei index adjustment? I've factored that into section three of the report."" I turned the page deliberately. ""As you'll see, even with the most conservative estimates, we're looking at a twelve percent increase in market share.""

I met his gaze directly, a silent challenge. You want to make this personal? Try harder.

Ryan's jaw tightened almost imperceptibly. He hadn't expected me to be so composed, so thoroughly prepared. He'd expected tears, shakiness, vulnerability he could exploit.

""Of course,"" he recovered smoothly. ""I simply wanted to ensure we're being prudent.""

""Prudence is precisely why Sterling Enterprises has outperformed Morrison & Associates three quarters running,"" I replied with a smile that didn't reach my eyes.

My father coughed, a sound that might have been concealing amusement. ""Let's continue with the presentation.""

By the time we adjourned, Ryan's confidence had visibly deflated. As board members filed out, he lingered, clearly wanting a private word. I deliberately took my time gathering my materials, waiting until we were nearly alone.

""Isabella,"" he began, his voice lowered. ""This charade with Ethan Blake—""

""Is none of your concern,"" I cut him off, snapping my portfolio closed. ""Just as your miraculous memory recovery seems to be progressing right on schedule.""

A flash of something—guilt? alarm?—crossed his face before he masked it. ""My doctors are very encouraged by my progress.""

""I'm sure Charlotte is thrilled,"" I replied. ""How convenient that you remembered her first.""

He stepped closer, dropping the pretense. ""What are you playing at with Ethan? He's nothing—a junior associate who fetches coffee.""

I smiled, gathering my belongings. ""Yet here you are, bothered by nothing.""

As I walked past him, I paused. ""Oh, and Ryan? The next time you try to undermine me in my family's boardroom, come better prepared. I'm not the same woman you thought you could discard.""

I left him standing there, his reflection fractured across the glass wall of the conference room. In the elevator, my phone buzzed with a text from my brother Alexander.

\*Dinner tonight at Charlotte's. She specifically asked for you to come. Please say yes.\*

I stared at the screen, a cold certainty settling in my stomach. So Charlotte wanted to flaunt her victory up close. And my own brother was delivering the invitation.

The game was expanding. New players, new betrayals.

I typed my response: \*Wouldn't miss it for the world.\*

The floating text messages might have cast me as the villain, but they'd forgotten one crucial detail—in the best stories, the villains were always the most interesting characters.

Chapter 4

The morning light filtered through the tall windows of Professor Williams's office at Columbia Business School, casting long shadows across the oak-paneled walls. I sat across from him, my posture perfect despite the emotional turmoil of the past week. Ethan stood beside me, his presence a steady......

1m35kzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/1m35kzx/my_pitch_for_a_dcu_flash_show_discussion/,My Pitch For a DCU Flash Show [Discussion],"With the DCU still in it's early infancy, the state of most of the JLA is still largely unknown. The only projects we know for sure are in some form of development are a Green Lantern show premiering some time late next year, a Batman movie that still hasn't turned in a finished script, and a Wonder Woman project still in very early pre-production.

That leaves a whole lot of room for us to speculate on the structure and representation of the rest of the league.

One hero I think Gunn will be hesitant to jump to is the Flash. Not because he isn't an important hero, but because he's been over-exposed lately. Whatever interpretation of the Scarlet Speedster Gunn and Safran concoct will inevitably be compared to Grant Gustin's portrayal of the character by fans who tend to consider him the definitive adaptation of the character in live action, or will unfairly inherit the bad-press the previous interpretation of the Flash left on general audiences.  Likely both.

Either way you shoot, the fans will hate it off the back because it isn't Grant and general audiences will hate it because the previous interpretation was such a massive and controversial disappointment. (in there opinion at least, I thought the Flash movie was fine with a few stand-out well-done emotional scenes and some interesting if underbaked visual choices)

My pitch is a semi-serialized, semi-episodic prestige Flash TV show detailing the early career of Barry.

You might be thinking, how does that differ from the CW show, and the answer is structure and budget. The CW show at its core was an episodic monster-of-the-week format with some serialized elements. It fits right in tune with its grandaddy series Smallville and other successful CW series from the period like Supernatural.

The first half of this new show will begin mostly episodic, just setting up the world and this particular version of Central City. Particularly demonstrating the heightened nature of this reality and better putting it in tune with Superman in tone. We have a few MOTW episodes just to set things up before the season fully switches to a serialized story about half-way through.

# The City

Central City in this show, like in the comics, is largely based on St. Louis. And before I hear any buts about Kansas City or Chicago, [I don't make the rules I just tell them](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fwhats-your-headcanon-location-for-central-city-v0-nk98cgnp6ysd1.jpg%3Fwidth%3D1080%26format%3Dpjpg%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D64d7797cb6229ddef9b5ed089ab9ae07100e0236). Central City historically and logically is based on Saint Louis. With Saint Louis Missouri specifically as Central City and Saint Louis Illinois being Keystone City.

Saint Louis also awards us some simple allegories that can be pretty handy. Having Central City be a former beacon of advancement in America's very heartland now fallen to hard times gives us a true character to add to the city. Barry himself is a victim of the violence and poverty that has infected the city. Losing both parents when he was very young to violence and a chronically underfunded justice system that is slowly growing apathetic to the needs of the citizens it's sworn to protect. And raised in a foster system that only fosters abuse.

It is a city that is dying but is not dead. Unlike Gotham, there is still hope for Central City. Keystone on the other hand. Keystone was built to be a modern marvel of the mid-century. Built on post-war bluster and dreams of a utopia. A new Metropolis deep in the heart of America. It was all a scam though. Funding never met expectations and Keystone stands as a reminder of the dangers of large-scale planned developments. Half-built and full of crime. The flow of crime into Central City from Keystone is a huge background element of this show and one of the driving factors behind the serialized plot.

# The Flash

We meet Barry not at the beginning. Instead, we meet our speedster about six months after obtaining his powers. He's still incredibly rusty and overly cautious. Unsure of his true potential and constantly careful of not breaking something or someone.

The first episode mainly focuses on Barry first applying for forensics at the CCPD, and his eventual realization that he could use his powers to do good. Eventually ending in him performing his first heroic deed.

We follow him as he tries to do his heroics anonymously at first. Speeding in and out before anyone can even notice he's there. But realizing some jobs will require him to interact with the public, or even worse, villains, he decides he needs some sort of disguise and identity.

We follow him develop his first true supersuit. Mainly out of salvaged materials (A firefighting suit, a Nascar friction jacket and pants, and other assorted sporting gear). He slowly works on and refines this suit throughout the season.

We also see him settle in at forensics and develop a crush on his co-worker Iris West and build a mentor-like relationship with his Boss, (character still unnamed), a former Star Labs technician turned civil servant after becoming disillusioned with the corporate research world.

# Shit Hits the Fan

As I mentioned, things go pretty episodic in the first half. We were only interested in building the status quo and acquainting the viewers with Barry and Central City as the main characters.

Things start to shift when Iris eventually finds out about Barry's secret. Iris, rather than running away, doubles down on the budding romance between the two. She finds Barry's need to help endearing and the two begin to test the limit of Barry's abilities together.

**Then it happens**

When testing to see how fast he can go, Barry breaks the time-barrier for the first time. He trips and slides into the future to find a destroyed and empty Central City. Some sort of devastation event has all but leveled the city.

After combing through the wreckage of the town he calls home, Barry finally stumbles upon the only person left. A young mute girl. Together, they embark to find answers. The CCPD precinct and forensics lab have both been completely destroyed. The only structure left in some state of standing is Star Labs.

Upon entering the facility, Barry begins to find answers. The event that destroyed the City clearly originated from the labs. But the most shocking revelation comes when Barry finds a computer with an atomic clock. This entire time Barry thought he had flung himself into the far future. Years if not decades ahead of his time. However, upon looking at the last working clock in Central City,  Barry comes to the devastating realization that he is only six weeks into the future.

We watch as Barry panics, desperately trying to speed up again and break the time barrier once more. Each attempt more manic and desperate than the last. The episode ends.

# Things Are Different

The next episode cuts to Iris, waiting worried for Barry's return at the abandoned runway they were testing at in the present, when Barry finally appears from a flash. Clearly having spent a great deal of time in the future. Sporting a new beard and a panicked expression, Iris tries to calm him down but he shakes her off heading home.

There we get some clues as to what went down. Barry begins building a cork board of suspects and strings. Frantically building connections while cupping a charred and dirty version of Iris' necklace she wears at all times, letting the audience know that Iris does not survive the event.

We find out more from flashbacks. Barry was trapped in the future for a year. Upon taking the mute girl to safety somewhere in unaffected Illinois, Barry immediately starts investigating the incident. He arrived two weeks after the event. Blame has been placed upon various activist groups within Central City. Believing the devastating explosion was an act of politically motivated terrorism. He spent months working out how to travel backwards. Having to learn rudimentary quantum physics to figure out how to switch which direction he was moving along the flow of time.

In the present, Barry begins implanting himself into these various activist groups. One is a racial justice organization primarily concerned with over-policing predominantly minority neighborhoods and police brutality. The other a socialist movement primarily concerned with public money being spent on vanity projects meant to appease the already rich and powerful within the city, an environmental activist group and animal rights advocates both primarily concerned with the activities of Star Labs (a thinly veiled allegory for Monsanto). And an unofficial governmental oversight committee concerned about the corruption and apathetic attitudes pervading the municipal government.

Although initially there to investigate these groups to find the perpetrator of the incident, Barry's good nature gets the best of him and he can't help but find himself invested in these movements. Not only does helping out these groups make him feel good in a way forensics hasn't, but he finds himself a better hero because of them. Beginning to connect with the villains he is facing. Understanding their motivations and actually talking a few of them down peacefully.

In the mean-time, his association with these various groups makes him no friends at the CCPD, who think of him as a bleeding heart at best, and a traitor at worst. Leading to consistent bullying and harassment at work. Iris on the other hand continues to find his dedication to helping people wholly endearing and their relationship continues to move forward in spite of Barry's guilt about holding the truth about what he knows from her.

Meanwhile, public fears over Star Labs activity is ramping up after a villain was caught using dangerous stolen tech, and a bombshell report showing that they are actively dumping into the city river causes massive uproar.

With three weeks resulting in no headway in the investigation, Barry is down to the wire. He has one week to stop the total destruction of Central City. His attempts become more desperate. He finally finds no other solution than to bring in his boss on the problem, revealing himself as the Flash and asking his boss to keep their conversations secret from Iris. As a former Star Labs employee Barry believes he might know what exactly within the labs might have caused the incident. Together they break into Star Labs to stop the incident at the source by force.

# The Betrayal

Once inside the facility, Boss let's Barry know the most likely culprit for the incident was the anti-matter accelerator. Originally built in the 90s, the once-marvel of engineering is now old and probably violating an entire book of safety violations. Or so the boss says, but when they eventually find the accelerator, it has clearly been updated in recent years and up to code. But before Barry can make any deductions he is literally stabbed in the back by his boss.

It was him the whole time!

He gives his typical villain spiel.

""Central City is a doomed city, but it can be an example to the rest of the country. Do not abandoned your citizens to poverty, do not abuse our trust and our needs, violate our rights, poison our food, or lock up our innocent.""

He's going to blow up the city and blame it on the protesters.

The villain caught with stolen Star Labs tech was hired by the boss. Given information on how to access the lab by him. He sabotaged Star Labs public image in order to cause mass protest. He was also responsible for helping to leak several instances of gross EPA violations leading to the expose, further causing outrage from the public. By the time they break in there is a permanent protest just outside the facility.

Meanwhile, he has also been fanning the other side. From within his position at the CCPD, he has slowly been poisoning the view of the protestors for the police who already don't care for them. egging them on to increase the brutality of their response.

As they speak the protest outside has turned violent as the police have turned to force against the otherwise peaceful protesters.

The boss compliments Barry because he has sped up his plans by several months. He never could have gotten into the lab without him.

He genuinely believes this is the perfect next step. That once the explosion is pinned on the protesters, government action will dramatically increase on any form of organized protest. He is fanning flames to stir revolution. Lighting a fire beneath the masses asses to spur them into action. To finally unite the public against the seeping corruption at the heart of our governments.

As the boss begins to fiddle with the computers for the accelerator Barry tries to talk him down. An increasingly frustrated boss, befuddled by the new control system then picks up an abandoned coffee mug and pours the contents directly onto the control panel.

The boss leaves a befuddled, stressed, and injured Barry behind.

# The Hail Mary

Barry forcefully pulls himself together, noticing his wound is healing at an abnormally fast rate. He tries to fix the accelerator which is starting to overload and go haywire. He has only minutes to stop the accelerator from fully warming up and going critical.

Eventually, in a last ditch effort, Barry begins attempting to go back in time again, to stop it.

He breaches the time-barrier, but is unable to slow himself down. It is here where Barry fully enters the speed force for the first time. Able to see and interact with the kinetic energy that connects the whole of the universe. Entropy itself becomes maleable in his hands.

With every bit of energy the still-injured speedster has left, Barry grasps at the kinetic energy within the accelerator and pulls hard. Attempting to drain the system before it can overload. And draining power from the rest of Star Labs.

Barry beats the odds, and successfully steals the energy within the accelerator and absorbs it into himself. He then launches himself as far away from Central City and civilization as possible, landing in the center of Lake Michigan and releasing the energy as a massive bolt of electrical energy lighting up the night sky.

Upon returning to Central City, the boss has disappeared and cannot be traced. Barry finally builds up the courage to talk to Iris about his experience with the future and what happened with the boss. Unable to tell the police the truth or risk revealing his identity as The Flash, a missing persons report is opened on the boss of which Barry is a leading suspect. Leading to the plot of a season 2.

Here are my timelines:

- 3/28/2025 USCIS received my application package I-130, I-485, I-765

- 4/22 Biometrics Appt, after attending, both my I-130, I-485 flipped to Actively Reviewing

- 4/26 I-765 EAD decision rendered

- 5/2 card was produced for I-765

- 6/12 interview scheduled for 7/18 

- 7/18 attend interview approved on the spot 

The whole process took less than 4 months (which is crazy to me, i was ready to wait 2 years) I really wanted to give a shoutout to my officer but i forgot to ask for his name. He was really nice but professional and made the entire interview process way less frightening and way more conversational. Gave us good recommendation on coffee spots, what his job was like… etc. He said you guys submitted a ton of evidence especially photos this made his job way easier, told us our marriage is legit and approved us on the spot, telling me i should have the card in 7-10 days.

During my research I read some horror stories about the Boston FO so I was slightly worried coming in but it turned out way better than I had initially expected. But again this is just my own experience and a single data point.

Has anyone here used Costar or Noir? Would love to hear your experiences, recommendations, or anything I should keep in mind.

Edit : I am looking more on the lines of an automatic capsule/pod machine.

Previously we lived in Asia for a few years, and you could buy a day pass or pay for a massage/ sauna at a good hotel, then swim about in an outdoor pool afterwards. Ideally one large enough to do laps.

Are there any nice hotels/ nice spas like that westish..Chelsea/Fulham/ Kensington/ Battersea?  Or Pall Mall area.   Happy to spend, as it’s R&R.    

We looked at ‘spa’ gyms, but meugh.  
- We tried David Lloyds Fulham, which has a decent pool, but average sauna/ steam room facilities (there’s a huge gap under the doors, so they’re always medium warm at best, not ideal for saunas/steam rooms).   
- Tried Chelsea Harbour Club, but it’s so dated/old.  Given the price, the coffee shop/ ‘quiet’ areas were basic basic and noisy - so no added value to the monthly gym costs.
- Besides we don’t want to gym, we want to lounge in a pool / massage + pool.

SO we’re back to looking for an outdoor pool for the day/ or a spa experience with pool.   Any secret hotels / thoughts?  Would look to pay 100 ish for a full day, + spa prices if massage included.   Just want somewhere relaxing for the day.  Thx!

TIA

Edit: actually forget price, day access to a good outdoor pool wanted!  ;)

1m35h14,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1m35h14/im_letting_you_go/,I'm letting you go,"You’ll never see this. I’m not writing it for you, anyway. I’m writing it for me because something inside me needs to say goodbye, even if it’s only in silence.

I know we were never anything. Not officially. Not romantically. Probably not even close in your mind. But in mine, you became everything. And I don’t think you ever realized it, just how much space you took up in my head, in my heart, in my life.

You never had to be present for the feelings to flare up. You were there constantly, on my mind almost 24/7. Sleep was the only relief I had from it: the only place where I could be free. And in some twisted way, I’m grateful for that. I never dreamed of you. Not even once. Somehow, even my subconscious knew not to torture me like that.

But the saddest part? Even in those dreamless nights, I’d wake up with a hollow ache in my chest because you *still* weren’t there. And deep down, I knew you never would be.

I know how you saw me. Just someone from work. Someone too talkative, too emotional, the one who always overshares. I probably annoyed you more often than I’d like to admit. You, with your cool, calculating, practical way of moving through the world, I knew you didn’t have much patience for people like me. People who feel too much and give too easily. And still… you never hesitated to come to me when you needed something, did you?

You always knew I’d be there.
You needed a sounding board? I listened for hours.
You had a conflict at work? I was always in your corner.
You needed funding for your passion projects? I made it happen.
You needed a coffee? A meal? Someone to sit with? I paid. I stayed. I showed up.

It didn't really matter what I was going through: if I was buried in work, if I wasn’t feeling well, if it was late, none of it really ever mattered. If you messaged me, I jumped like someone electrocuted. Instantly. Every time. You were always the exception to my boundaries, my plans, even my well-being.

And the worst part? I don’t think you ever noticed it. Or if you did, you didn’t care.
I kept telling myself, ""If I just give enough, show up enough, maybe he’ll see me differently.""

But you never did. And now I know that you never will.

Days ago, I got sick. Badly sick. The kind where for a brief moment, I honestly thought it might be the end for me. Our mutuals knew but I didn’t reach out to you. I told myself and the universe, If he cared even just a little bit, he'll check in. I made it a test, even though I already knew the result.

And guess what? Ten days. Nothing. No message. No quick “Hey, what's up?” Not even a casual emoji. Silence.

And somehow, that silence said more than any words ever could.

So this is the sign I was waiting for. The final one from the Universe. The one I can’t spin into hope or doubt or maybe.

You don’t care. I was never special. Just useful.

Now that I’ve left the company, now that I’m no longer someone who can boost your projects or your image or your career, I’m nothing. Not even worth a check-in message.

It hurts. More than I can say. It’s a deep, aching kind of pain, the kind that presses on your chest and burns behind your eyes but never quite lets you cry. I’ve felt it every day since, and I don’t know how long it’ll stay. But I do know this:

This is where I stop waiting.

You’ll never know what I felt. You’ll never know what I gave up to be there for you. And maybe that’s for the best. Maybe you were never meant to carry this truth, only I was.

So I’m writing this and letting it live in the quiet. In the unspoken.This is me, grieving something that never really existed. 

And this is me, letting it go.

I like coffee but I am not very picky about where I go. My friend Brenda though is a self proclaimed “coffee fanatic”. However this became an issue among our social circle recently. 

Brenda and I were planning to have lunch recently and I was to meet at her house. However she asked me for a favor and asked if I could bring her a coffee. She sent me money and even offered to buy me a coffee if I did this. I agree and she sent me the Yelp page for a local coffee shop. Although I’m open to trying new places, the shop she’s asking me to go to is in an area where parking is limited. I go and manage to find parking but have to walk about 5 minutes to the coffee shop.

Over the next month, I spend a lot of time with Brenda as I’m helping her get ready to start a new job. But we always end up going to get (or asking me to go get us) coffee but it’s always at a new place. One coffee shop was nearly a 25 minute drive. Brenda would search tik tok or instagram for the hottest and trendy coffee spots, even some being in pop up locations. She would often spend 30 minutes or more at these locations asking the workers for their recommendations and lingering over her drink. I would just put up with it as I wanted to show her support. 

However I recently had a job interview I had to attend myself and Brenda again asked if I could bring her a coffee on my way to my interview. But again she’s asking me to go to a new spot. She also says to “show me what they have when you get there.” I told her that I don’t have time to bring her a coffee even if she’s paying and I definitely am not going to relay their options to her via text or FaceTime. She continues to beg me and I ask her why not just ask me to get coffee at a closer spot?

Brenda reiterated how serious she takes coffee and “I never go to the same place twice.”

I snap back and call her a coffee snob. She claims that I’m being rude and mean and all I had to do was say no but I tell Brenda that she’s projecting this entitled image that she’s too good for regular coffee.

1m35d88,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1m35d88/does_nespresso_vertuo_pop_deluxe_really_deliver_a/,Does Nespresso Vertuo Pop Deluxe Really Deliver? A Detailed Review of Features,"The **Nespresso BNV125TTN1BUC1 Vertuo Pop+ Deluxe Coffee and Espresso Maker** has been on my kitchen counter for a couple of weeks now, becoming a companion in my morning and evening routines. I’m someone who enjoys simplicity but refuses to compromise on flavor, so having a coffee and espresso maker claiming several features piqued my interest. Let me dive in and share my experience testing this compact machine, which promises premium brews with style and ease.

**Build and Aesthetics**  
One thing that stands out immediately about this device is its metallic exterior finish, radiating sophistication. The machine’s ""Titan"" color is a subdued yet classy shade that complements my kitchen’s modern décor. Measuring 14""D x 8.6""W x 10.4""H, it fits seamlessly in tight spaces—a godsend for smaller kitchens like mine. The design is truly compact, yet it doesn't appear flimsy or overcrowded. The detachable 37 fl. oz. water tank, situated at the side, is a thoughtful feature that makes refilling painless without any unnecessary juggling.

**Ease of Use**  
Using this coffee maker feels like a straightforward process, as though it was designed with non-tech-savvy users in mind. A one-touch brewing system means you can literally pop in a Vertuo capsule, press a button, and voilà—coffee’s ready. With the machine automatically ejecting used pods, it saves me the additional hassle of cleanup. The 30-second heat-up time is genuinely impressive. Touching on convenience, an adjustable drip tray ensures that shorter cups can sit snuggly without awkward spillage.

**Precision in Brewing**  
Let’s address the taste factor: beyond aesthetics, coffee quality is where this model shines. Each brew delivers a smooth, full-bodied flavor topped with a delightfully velvety coffee foam. I made everything from espressos to larger 12 oz. coffee cups, and the precision brewing technology ensured consistency across all sizes. The way it unlocks complex flavors is something I’ve rarely seen in automatic coffee machines. Admittedly, I’m not particularly great at differentiating between brewing methods, but even my pickier friend commented on the richness of the flavor.  

**Features That Add Value**  
The versatility of this machine can’t be overstated. You can make five different cup sizes, ranging from smaller espresso shots to 12 oz. drinks. I gave the cold brew-style coffee a try, and it was exceptionally refreshing, especially with a bit of crushed ice. Another noteworthy feature is sustainability—Nespresso capsules are 100% recyclable. It feels good knowing that while enjoying my coffee, I’m not contributing excessively to landfill waste. Their free recycling program for used aluminum capsules is a rare win for eco-conscious coffee aficionados.  

**Pluses**  
- Compact dimensions make it perfect for smaller spaces.  
- One-touch functionality simplifies the coffee-making process.  
- The inclusion of a complimentary coffee tasting pack is a treat for first-time users.  
- Recyclable aluminum capsules align with sustainable practices.  
- Five cup sizes expand the versatility and cater to individual preferences.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Limited capsule compatibility can enforce reliance on Nespresso-branded products.  
- The machine can feel slightly noisy during operation, which caught my attention early in the mornings.  
- Replacement capsules might prove expensive over time depending on drinking habits.  
- While compact, the removable water tank needs frequent refilling if making multiple large cups.  

**Competitive Options**  
Comparatively speaking, the **Keurig K-Supreme** and **Breville Bambino Plus** present themselves as strong contenders in this category. The Keurig edges ahead with its wider pod compatibility, which lends to overall convenience at a broader price range. However, its brewing process occasionally delivers diluted flavors, which felt underwhelming alongside the robust coffee quality from this product. Breville’s Bambino Plus, meanwhile, is stellar for those seeking a more professional barista-like experience but lacks the seamless automatic operation that makes this machine ideal for beginners or busy households. Its compact frame and precision brewing give it a unique appeal against those competitors.  

**Financial Value**  
When balancing features with cost, this coffee maker justifies its value. The aesthetic build combined with the genuinely high-quality brewing process feels worth the price for coffee enthusiasts, especially those who love experimenting with different espresso and coffee sizes. What may offset the value for some buyers is the exclusive compatibility with Nespresso-branded capsules, requiring additional budget allocation over time. However, for those who prioritize convenience and premium taste, the expenditure feels like a fair trade-off.

1m35cvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedAtHome/comments/1m35cvk/does_the_hamilton_beach_programmable_coffee_maker/,Does the Hamilton Beach Programmable Coffee Maker Deliver Perfect Brews?,"Hamilton Beach 46299 has become an inseparable part of my mornings. As someone who values that first cup of coffee to kick-start the day, finding a coffee maker that delivers convenience, quality, and flavor is priceless. With its programmable functionality, sleek design, and versatile features, this coffee maker seemed promising right out of the box. Having spent weeks putting it to the test every single morning (and often in the afternoons), I can confidently share my experience with it—the good, the not-so-good, and some surprising discoveries.

**Design and Aesthetic Appeal**  
Right away, I appreciated the modern metallic finish with black accents. It sits comfortably in my kitchen without sticking out like a sore thumb. Sturdy and lightweight for its size, it makes a decent aesthetic addition to countertops. Measuring 9.5""D x 11.4""W x 12.9""H, it fits without crowding my often-chaotic morning prep area. I also found the cord storage feature surprisingly useful; kitchen clutter doesn't need to include messy cords, and this neat addition keeps the countertop organized. 

**Impressions of Performance**  
This coffee maker doesn’t hold back on functionality. The programmable timer allows me to set it up to brew coffee up to 24 hours in advance. That meant I could prepare everything the night before and wake up to fresh coffee in the morning, which genuinely feels semi-magical. The ""Auto Pause & Pour"" feature comes in clutch if you can't wait for the brewing to complete—perfect when you're rushing out the door or too impatient (like me). I tested both regular and bold brew strengths multiple times, and the flavors are consistent and robust, especially on the bold setting. The smaller 1-4 cup setting also brewed a mean, flavorful pot when I wasn’t looking for a full 12 cups.  

[Grab Hamilton Beach 46299 at the best price on Amazon.](https://ultrasonicstore.com/p/b06xp4dkgl/)

**Ease of Cleaning and Maintenance**  
Cleaning household appliances can sometimes feel like an unnecessary chore, but Hamilton Beach seems to have simplified that part. The carafe and brew basket are dishwasher-safe, and the non-stick warming plate just requires a quick wipe. I ran a simple rinse cycle periodically to keep everything in pristine condition, and it’s held up well after continuous use. The thoughtfulness of these details did not go unnoticed, as they made my morning routine run smoother.

**Strengths**  
- The programmable timer added the convenience of “wake-up ready” coffee.  
- ""Auto Pause & Pour"" is possibly my favorite feature, letting me sneak a cup without any spills.  
- Multiple brew strength options cater to everyone’s preference, from mild to bold.  
- Top-notch cleaning ease, eliminating the nightmare of coffee stains.  

**Drawbacks**  
No product is perfect, though, and my experience wasn’t without its less favorable moments:  
- The paper filter system doesn’t bring the same richness you’d get with reusable filters.  
- Occasionally, the carafe lid doesn’t close as snugly, and a little condensation tends to drip.  
- It’s not as quiet during brewing as I’d hoped, though the sound isn’t entirely disruptive.  
- I noticed over time the warming plate gets super hot—a pro for some, but a safety consideration in my household full of kids.

**How It Stacks Against Competitors**  
While there are many contenders among drip coffee makers, I compared this one directly with a leading model from Cuisinart. Both products offer programmability and sleek designs, but the Hamilton Beach 12-cup beats Cuisinart on user-friendly cleaning and the delightful Auto Pause & Pour option. On the flip side, Cuisinart’s metal mesh reusable filter promises richer flavor and a lower environmental toll compared to this coffee maker’s paper-based system. My experience indicated that each has its strengths, but Hamilton Beach certainly fares better for households looking for budget-friendly ease with robust brew options.

**Price Performance**  
Discussing price without naming a specific figure, this coffee maker impresses in its category for price-to-quality ratio. You won’t find overly complex features, but everything necessary for a reliable, hassle-free coffee experience is here—and it performs these tasks exceptionally well. It feels like money spent smartly, especially for anyone wanting functionality without breaking the bank.

I stood in line at the post office today and saw fluorescent lights buzzing, one person working the counter, and a line of tired souls clutching pick-up slips. No music. No coffee. No tracking update that actually meant anything.

And it hit me: damn, capitalism really does incentivize efficiency.

In the private sector, if FedEx or Amazon made me wait 30 minutes just to be told my package “isn’t in the system yet,” I’d switch services. But here? I wait, nod, and thank them. Because there’s no other option.

I’m not trying to hate on USPS, they do a lot with very little, and rural access matters. But the contrast is jarring. In capitalism, competition drives innovation. In public service? You get what you get.

Anyway, shout out to baristas who smile, apps that track my burrito in real time, and warehouse workers who somehow get me a phone charger in 24 hours.

Weirdly grateful for the absurd machine that is late-stage capitalism… at least until I look at rent prices.

1m351j0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApteraMotors/comments/1m351j0/i_think_that_a_scammer_may_be_fraudulently_trying/,I think that a scammer may be fraudulently trying to associate with Aptera.,"TLDR: Scammer, with no SEC filings, asks for investment (in possible violation of federal securities law), and claims to have engineered chassis and suspension for Aptera in 2023.



So recently, Steve@AOC posted this video where he talked about an electric three-wheeled commuter pod build by ""Trinova"": [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Eop-C7w2R0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Eop-C7w2R0)



I took a look at this ""company"" Trinova, and it feels like it was hastily assembled by a scammer.

So if you go to their Contact page, [https://trinovaev.com/contact-trinova](https://trinovaev.com/contact-trinova), Trinova lists its address as ""3366 Via Lido, Newport Beach, CA.

If you go look up that address, [https://burnham-ward.com/properties/the-waterfront-at-via-lido/](https://burnham-ward.com/properties/the-waterfront-at-via-lido/), you will find that the tenants include SAP software, HanaHaus coworking, and a coffee brewery.

Now, the fact that the ""company"" Trinova lies about being located in an address they are not, makes me suspicious.

Next, they have an ""invest"" page. [https://trinovaev.com/invest-self-balancing-vehicle](https://trinovaev.com/invest-self-balancing-vehicle) 

In order for a company to take in investments under SEC Regulation Crowdfunding, they must file with the SEC [https://www.sec.gov/resources-small-businesses/exempt-offerings/regulation-crowdfunding](https://www.sec.gov/resources-small-businesses/exempt-offerings/regulation-crowdfunding) . 

For example, Aptera Motors Corp ( [https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=1786471](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=1786471) ),  filed this 2019 SEC Form C: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1786471/000167025419000484/xslC\_X01/primary\_doc.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1786471/000167025419000484/xslC_X01/primary_doc.xml) before they started WeFunder investments in 2020.

If you try to look up ""Trinova"" in SEC EDGAR, you get no results. Now I'm not an expert in  securities law, but ""Trinova"" seems to be soliciting crowdfunding investment without ever having filed SEC Form C, which may be a federal crime.

  
If you want a good laugh (or cringe) click the ""invest"" button on the Trinova website to get taken here: [https://wefunder.com/trinova.mobility](https://wefunder.com/trinova.mobility)

Now here's where it gets really ridiculous, this biography of ""Markus Scholten"":

* 2012 - Built the CTX: first rideable prototype of a leanable, 3-wheeled electric vehicle
* 2013 - Designed and built a super-luxury bulletproof SUV
* 2015 - Lead and only engineer on a 1500HP Hybrid Hyper car
* 2016 - Lead engineering for Cabs on Nikola One and Nikola Two (hydrogen-electric trucks)
* 2020 - Director of Engineering at an eVTOL startup
* 2021 - COVID hits, shop and company lost, used the time to build my own Pilates-Cardio-Strength machine to get my mind and body back in shape, and called it VrsaFit)
* 2022 - Rebuilt and launched new Trinova prototypes with full-function balance system
* 2023 - Engineer for chassis and suspension at Aptera. IP and funding disputes lead to legal battle — but didn’t stop the mission
* 2025 - Rebuilding Trinova independently — ready for the final prototype and go-to-market

This feels so poorly written. Why can't ""Markus Scholten"" name the SUV company he worked for, the hypercar company he worked for, or the eVTOL company he worked for?

""Designed and built"" So how is this man is a designer, a mechanical engineer, a machinist, and a welder all in one man. He build a vehicle that complies with the FMVSS all by himself?

I really like the claim that he was the ""lead and only engineer"" on a ""1500HP Hybrid Hyper car."" Unlike Aptera, which has electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, software engineers, and materials engineers (and others), this supergenius we have here is so brilliant that he single-handedly designed a ""Hyper car"" from the ground up. Wow, how believable...

So then Markus Scholten claims to have built ""VrsaFit."" Ok, so what's that? 

It has a sweet looking website. [https://www.vrsa-fit.com/](https://www.vrsa-fit.com/)

Let's check where VrsaFit is located [https://www.vrsa-fit.com/visit-us](https://www.vrsa-fit.com/visit-us) :

""Location TBD, Newport Beach Lido isle Orange County, 92663""

Wow, that's real useful.

So it looks like you can buy this piece of exercise equipment for $4400, here at [https://www.vrsa-fit.com/shop](https://www.vrsa-fit.com/shop), except if you click ""add to cart"" you can't pay.

  
All that being said, I would like u/VirtuallyChris to either quiet my suspicions if, in fact, a man named Markus Scholten actually worked on chassis and suspension at Aptera in 2023, 

\-------------------or-------------------------------

set the record straight for all of us here if ""Markus Scholten"" of ""Trinova"" is fraudulently claiming an association with Aptera in an attempt to raise investment to his unregistered ""entity"".",2,1752851761.0,ApteraMotors,2,1.0,False

**Today I am at 161**

*(Goal is 135, planning for 10% regain on my surgeon’s advice to land around 145-150)*

Anyone out there feeling like they’re slow losers because they only drop a few pounds a week? Hi! Me too! I never had any dramatic weight loss. I average 2-3 lbs a week and worried for a long time that I was behind the curve. Just wanted to share that slow and steady adds up. 

I have so much energy! I can buy clothing at any store I want. I walk or jog a few times a week and I enjoy it. My loose belly skin (the apron) exists but I think it’s actually shrinking. My body and my joints used to hurt ALL THE TIME and now I just feel good! 

I still measure and track all my food to make sure I’m getting enough protein but really I eat whatever sounds good. I am not hungry very often but I’m not sure if that’s because I’m really not hungry or because I stay on top of having a protein snack every few hours. I add protein and collagen in my coffee every day and I take bariatric multivitamins and calcium. No more added iron supplements per my surgeon because I was too high on my last round of labs. I am off ALL my previous blood pressure meds. Hydration is tough sometimes but using flavor packets helps a lot. 

Overall, my quality of life has increased exponentially. I am so happy I finally took this step to improve my health. 

(Food wise: I still feel a lot of restriction. My stomach does not like chicken, bread, or pasta, but I do pretty well having a few ounces of venison, steak, fish, or seafood. Ground meat of any kind is also generally something I can tolerate. Sometimes I can eat eggs, sometimes not. I do okay with all dairy, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and some grains. Everything is easier to eat if I put a sauce on it.)",9,1752851576.0,GastricBypass,0,1.0,False

Is BestGuessistan Right for You? Take This Brief Quiz.

**1.** Have you recently lost the plot, the plan, or the person you were supposed to become?  
☐ Yes  ☐ No  ☐ I think so but I’m still pretending otherwise

**2.** Do well-meaning people keep saying things like “Everything happens for a reason”?  
☐ Yes  ☐ If one more person does I will scream  ☐ I said it once. I regret it

**3.** Do you now require a nap, a cry, or a gentle feral scream to complete basic tasks?  
☐ Yes  ☐ Obviously  ☐ That’s my daily to-do list

**4.** Are you asked if you’ve recovered yet or if you’re better by now?  
☐ Yes, but I can handle it  
☐ Yes, but I can’t handle it  
☐ No  
☐ No, and how do I make them stop

If you answered **Yes** to any of the above… congratulations.  
If you answered **Yes** to *all* of the above, you may already be here — but it’s time to make it official.

# 📍 What to Expect (and What Not To)

**Don’t expect:**  
✖️ A 5-star spa experience  
✖️ A typical rehab and recovery destination  
✖️ A sleek boutique hotel  
✖️ A linear recovery path  
✖️ Inspirational playlists  
✖️ Happy recovery stories  
✖️ Lectures on resilience  
✖️ Closure  
✖️ A welcome ceremony (unless you count crying in your car)

**Do expect:**  
✔️ Bureaucratic weirdness  
✔️ Unfamiliar but intriguing place names  
✔️ Glorious disorientation  
✔️ Fellow travelers you’ve never seen before but instantly recognize  
✔️ Unsolicited advice, if you’re open to it  
✔️ Accidental community  
✔️ Your own private Ministry (likely several — and if you don’t find the one you need, feel free to suggest it; **BestGuessistan is always open to innovation**)

Some find clarity. Some find mischief.  
Most find snacks and try again tomorrow.

# 📚 Practical Information for Visitors

# 🛬 Getting Here

No flights. No ferries.  
Most arrivals are unplanned.  
One minute you're managing your life; the next, you're filling out paperwork for the **Ministry of Unfinished Thoughts**.

Popular arrival portals include:  
• Sudden loss  
• Any type of rupture  
• Medical diagnosis  
• Cognitive implosion  
• Slow-burning existential unraveling  
• A failed yoga retreat (it happens)

# 🗣️ Language

The local dialect will seem familiar and unfamiliar at once, and includes:  
“I’m fine” (not fine)  
“Just tired” (deep soul depletion)  
“This is my new normal?” (spoken mid-panic)

Fluency in metaphor is helpful.  
Metaphor coaches are available 24/7, though they may speak in riddles.  
Silence is a second language.

(See also: **Ministry of Miscommunication & Other People’s Expectations**)

# 🚕 Getting Around

Most movement is emotional. All directions are approximate.  
Roads often loop.  
Maps are crowdsourced.  
Some routes are imaginary.

BestGuessistan’s only subway line is the **Circular Reasoning Loop**.  
It never stops, but the announcements are oddly comforting — and always audible.

Bring snacks and a vague sense of humor. Or irony. Preferably both.

(See: **Ministry of Overthinking & Second Guessing**)

# 💰 Currency

We use spoons, stickers, and small wins.

Barter system encouraged:  
• “I showed up today.”  
• “I sent the email I’ve been avoiding for 3 weeks.”  
• “Sure, I’ll try something else.”

A single deep breath can buy you a coffee and a sticker.

(See also: **Department of Emotional Logistics**)

# 🧘‍♀️ Customs & Etiquette

• Failure is normal  
• Judgment is not allowed  
• Disorientation is encouraged  
• We do not celebrate “bouncing back”  
• Please remove your expectations before entering shared spaces

(For detailed codes of conduct, consult the **Ministry of Internal Affairs & Inexplicable Feelings**)

# 📦 What to Pack

• Your last known self  
• Extra softness  
• A playlist with no skip guilt  
• Snacks labeled “emotional support”  
• Comfortable pants and complicated feelings

BestGuessistan isn’t the trip you planned.  
It’s the one you take when the itinerary burns — and you have to make meaning from the ashes.

I recently hosted a guest (3-night stay) who had 7 previous Airbnb trips but no reviews which I found odd. I now completely regret accepting the booking.

She never responded to my messages before, during, or after the stay, only when I confronted her about the missing items. 

I only found out how bad things were today when my cleaners arrived, the apartment was left in a horrible state, bad smell from a shop called New Delhi across the road, the bin was stuffed with a sainsbury’s bag ontop of it with food waste, the laundry basket was full of takeaway boxes and coke bottles, the 2L ones. In the main bedroom, the pillows and bedding were all thrown on the floor, and every towel in the place used and left over doors and clothing racks, when the pre booking message states to leave them in the laundry basket.. 

Items are also missing, specifically the kitchen storage containers for tea, coffee, and sugar. 
When I messaged to ask she claimed they weren’t there and then complained that there were no teabags available.

I genuinely don’t trust her to leave a fair review if I say anything and I can’t afford a retaliatory 1-star rating out of spite. Airbnb hasn’t been quick to act in the past when it comes to reviews or missing items so i’ve heard so the risk feels too high.

She clearly abused the space and ignored all my communication. I feel stuck and if I say nothing, she might keep doing this to other hosts, but if I leave a review, I could get hit with a damaging one that Airbnb might not remove in time (if at all). She can just delete her account. 

Any advice? Has anyone had luck getting Airbnb to protect you from retaliatory reviews in a case like this? Would you still leave an honest review? I genuinely don’t know what to do.

Not rain. Not snow. Just ash. The wind carried it softly like the world was trying to bury him even before he climbed into the grave.

He had dug the hole himself. Six feet then deeper. His fingers blistered through gloves the shovel’s edge worn blunt. His back ached from the weight of the earth. His limbs trembled. But none of it compared to the heaviness inside his chest.

The coffin wasn't ornate. It was a narrow sarcophagus of stone he carved from an old tomb sealed with a lid that didn’t open from the inside. Inside it smelled of dust and grave oil lined with black cloth stitched with nothing but loss.

He stood above the pit for a long while.

There was no one left to witness him.

Syndra lingered nearby her panther form unmoving muscles taut. Her eyes normally sharp and predatory were wide uncertain. She didn’t speak. She hadn’t spoken in days. The death of Owlbert had done something to her too. Something neither of them had the words for.

Kaelith knelt beside her and pressed his forehead to hers.

“I’ll be back” he whispered knowing it might not be true.

Then he climbed into the coffin.

Syndra did not help bury him. She only watched trembling until he pulled the lid closed with a final grunt and sealed himself in darkness.

And then the dirt came.

Minute by minute hour by hour the earth swallowed him. Loose soil packed tightly around the coffin grain by suffocating grain until there was no more sound. No more air. No more world.

Only silence.


---

Day One

Kaelith lay in total blackness.

He had thought he could manage the dark. He was no stranger to it. As a Spirit Medium he had lived in shadows walked among spirits whispered to things that lurked beneath.

But this… this wasn’t darkness. This was absence.

There was no air flow only staleness. No movement. No light. The coffin was too narrow for motion. He couldn’t lift his hands. Couldn’t turn his head. His body touched stone and cloth and nothing more.

He counted his heartbeats.

Each one sounded too loud like it didn’t belong to him.

No food. No water. No light.
Only stillness. Only death.
And it had only just begun.


---

Day Two

Hunger arrived like a cruel guest. Sharp. Mocking.

Kaelith imagined meals he’d shared. Half burnt coffee with Owlbert. A meat pie Syndra had knocked over trying to steal the crust. He saw their faces so vividly until they started to rot. To dissolve. Owlbert’s feathers turned to ash in his mind.

He wept. The tears disappeared into the cloth beneath him.

He tried to recite rituals to calm his mind. Words of death. Words of power.

But the silence ate every syllable.

He tried to speak Owlbert’s name but it caught in his throat.
Saying it made it real.
Saying it meant admitting he was gone.


---

Day Three

Thirst came. It was sharper than hunger more immediate. His lips cracked. Tongue dry and thick. He pressed it against the coffin wall searching for moisture. There was none.

His breathing grew shallow. His ribs hurt. His stomach spasmed.

Time lost meaning. The dark pressed harder. The coffin began to feel alive pulsing. Breathing. Like it was absorbing him. Like it was judging his worth.

Voices came.

Faint.

Soft.

“Owlbert” he whispered.

But the voice wasn’t Owlbert’s. It was his own echoing back warped and broken.


---

Day Four

He forgot who he was.

His mind unraveled. Dreams bled into memories and memories became lies. He couldn’t remember Syndra’s face. He couldn’t remember his own.

He forgot why he was there.

All he knew was pain and dark and stone.

He screamed. Not words. Just raw noise.
It filled the coffin.
Then died.
The silence returned deeper than before.

In that silence he felt something move not physically but inside him. A part of him peeled away. Something essential.

He wasn’t Kaelith anymore.

He was the one who listened beneath the dirt.


---

Day Five

There was no more pain.

Just stillness.

The silence became a friend. A cruel cold friend who whispered truths.

You were never alive
You were always meant to be here
You walk with the dead because you are one of them

He didn’t fight the thoughts. He welcomed them. He let them settle in his mind like mold on flesh.

His soul felt loose. As if it were no longer tethered to his body.

Maybe it was already gone.

Maybe he was already dead.


---

Day Six

He awoke choking.

A presence filled the coffin not of a ghost but of something ancient.

It didn’t speak in words. It remembered through him.

Kaelith saw his own death. Not a death that had happened but the ones he’d carried. The boy in the snow. The mother in the plague. Owlbert's last look before vanishing into flame.

Each face etched into him. Burned. Carved.

And then one more joined them.

His own.

A cold hand felt not seen pressed against his chest. It wasn’t his. It wasn’t real. But it was.

And then the darkness opened.
Not outside.
Inside.

Kaelith understood.

This was the gift
To know death not from the outside
But from beneath

Sequence Four undying
The one who does not death
The one who lives in it




The dirt cracked above.

A paw black and bloodied clawed downward. Syndra howling with exhaustion had broken the taboo. She wasn’t supposed to interfere.

But she couldn’t take it anymore.

She dug for hours.

Then she found stone.

The coffin lid screeched open.

The stench of rot spilled out with a gasp of air that hadn’t been breathed in six days.

Kaelith lay still inside.

Gray. Sunken. Hollow.

Then he breathed.

His eyes fluttered open. Pale. Faded.

But something shimmered in them.

Not life. Not quite.

Something between.

Syndra nuzzled his face but he didn’t smile.

He simply whispered

“Owlbert… I heard you”

And then the spirits came.

Not in voice. Not in form.

But in presence.

They had waited for their lord.

And now he had risen.

There was a (maybe slightly older) woman in there wearing pink scrubs and looked like she was leaving for work. Now, my bf is someone who enjoys making conversation with random people in our building (and elsewhere), he never means to intrude or be creepy. So I can see him itching to make conversation with this woman, but I use body language to stop him.

When we leave the elevator, I ask him what he was trying to say to her, and he said he wanted to ask her if she was a nurse or a dental hygienist etc. (if she was someone in the medical field). I told him that this was unnecessary and can maybe come off as a bit intrusive and make her feel uncomfortable. I told him, overall, the elevator isn't the place to ask these kinds of questions. It's a small enclosed space and people could potentially feel pressured or (literally) backed into a corner and might not be as willing to have these interactions, as innocent as they may be.

He told me that he's not gonna change his curious/friendly personality to suit other people's comfort, especially if he was only asking in an innocent way.

I know there are a lot of opinions about whether or not the first look changes the emotions during the walk down the aisle, spending so much of your day apart from your new spouse, etc.  I don't want to regret not doing anything, and my fiancé is concerned that he won't have a big emotional moment at the altar if he's seen me in my dress before the ceremony (which is something he wants).

We have half-decided on a compromise between the two, where I might see him after my hair/makeup is done, but before either of us has gotten dressed. Our photographer(s) will be there around the time that I start hair and makeup, so thinking we could have a cute little ""iced coffee and sweatpants"" moment before the craziness. He's going to have seen me after my hair/makeup trial anyway, so not worried about ruining any surprises lol.

Then we can take a few moments to breathe together, maybe exchange some small gifts, and then go our separate ways to get dressed, take pictures with our respective wedding parties, and reconvene at the altar.

We are also having a relatively early ceremony (3pm) so I'm thinking this gives us plenty of time to still spend the day together.

My mom raised me alone and we've been struggling financially for 21 years - constantly moving between rental homes because my dad never paid the court-ordered support he was supposed to. I've always had a pretty isolated childhood with very few close relationships.

Few years ago, this woman M (who's about 12 years older than me) became incredibly close to my mom and me. She would talk to my mom every day, and I grew really attached to her. She felt like the family I never had - we'd hang out together, go to movies, have meals. I even started calling her ""didi"", ""maa"" sometimes. She was very qualified and that too from one of the most premier institutes of the country (am undergrad student at IIT and she's done Phd from an IIT), she has been a guide, teacher and inspiration for me.

For the first time in my life, I felt like I had a someone else to call family after my mom.

Then last month, M suddenly blocked us on WhatsApp out of nowhere. I was completely heartbroken because I'm so attached to her. We could still talk on Instagram and calls, but she lied to us (her phone broke) and we were blocked on WhatsApp.

I ended up going through my mom's phone (I know, not great) and discovered something that completely shocked me. Turns out I have two older step-brothers from my mom's previous marriage when she was 16. I barely remembered them from early childhood, but my memory had gotten fuzzy over the years. And M? She was dating my eldest step-brother.

M had lost her own mother when she was young, and she was searching for family connections when she found my mom on social media. She tried to help reconcile my mom with my step-brother by reaching out, my mom made his favorite food and sent him through her.  
But my step-brother still harbors intense hatred toward my mom and me

They eventually broke up and he is dating someone else but he forced M to block us on WhatsApp, made her send him screenshots as proof, and made her promise she'd never contact us again.

M told me she'd stay in touch outside of WhatsApp , and we even went for coffee where she said I remind her of my half-brother and that our characteristics match exactly.

I'm realizing that she probably always just saw me as her boyfriend's step-brother, while I thought of her as genuine family. She keeps ignoring or avoiding me nowadays while earlier we used to talk everyday.

Having endured a lot of childhood trauma and struggling to make close friends, losing this relationship has completely broken me.

\
by Worthy News Washington D.C. Bureau Staff\
\
(Worthy News) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a sweeping escalation in his global tariff policy, issuing formal letters to eight more countries warning that steep import duties will take effect on August 1 unless new trade agreements are reached. The move marks the latest salvo in Trump's aggressive ""America First"" trade agenda, which he says is designed to correct decades of unfair trade practices and ballooning U.S. deficits.\
\
Speaking from the White House, Trump explained that the tariffs were determined using what he called a ""common sense"" formula: ""based on deficits, based on how we've been treated over the years, and based on raw numbers."" The letters, posted to Trump's Truth Social account, specify tariffs ranging from 20% to 50% depending on the country's trade deficit with the United States and its overall relationship with Washington.\
\
Among the newly targeted nations are Brazil, Algeria, Libya, Sri Lanka, Iraq, Brunei, Moldova, and the Philippines. The most severe penalty was reserved for Brazil, which faces a 50% tariff hike--up from 10% in April. Trump cited the prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and alleged censorship of U.S. social media content as reasons for the stiffer measure.\
\
""The way that Brazil has treated former President Bolsonaro, a Highly Respected Leader throughout the World during his term, including by the United States, is an international disgrace,"" Trump wrote in a letter diverging sharply from the otherwise formulaic correspondence sent to other countries.\
\
Other nations received tariff warnings of 30% (Algeria, Libya, Sri Lanka, Iraq), 25% (Brunei, Moldova), and 20% (Philippines). The administration emphasized that these figures may change depending on each nation's willingness to engage in good-faith trade negotiations.\
\
The U.S. has now issued similar letters to 29 countries. Of those announced Wednesday, only the Philippines and Brazil rank among the top 50 U.S. trading partners. Brazil exported $49 billion in goods to the U.S. last year, including oil, beef, and coffee. The Philippines contributed $14.1 billion in electronics, auto parts, and textiles. Other nations, such as Iraq and Libya, primarily export oil, but overall volumes remain comparatively small.\
\
The tariff campaign began in April with a baseline 10% duty on all imports and higher rates on strategic targets. After a 90-day pause following stock market volatility, Trump extended the deadline to August 1 via executive order earlier this week, insisting there would be ""no extensions.""\
\
""All money will be due and payable starting August 1, 2025--No extensions will be granted,"" Trump wrote on social media, framing the deadline as firm and final.\
\
Despite the aggressive rhetoric, financial markets appeared unfazed. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.9% on Wednesday to a record high, buoyed by a rally in Nvidia shares, which briefly pushed the chipmaker's market cap above $4 trillion. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones also posted gains. Analysts attributed the optimism to investor confidence that the most severe tariffs might be negotiated down before implementation.\
\
Trump also announced a new 10% tariff on imports from BRICS countries--Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa--indicating his broader strategy includes punishing nations aligned with the bloc. ""It would be simpler to institute tariffs across the board rather than negotiate individually,"" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on July 3.\
\
The administration estimates it has collected $120 billion in tariff revenues so far this fiscal year. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent projects that figure could rise to $300 billion by year-end, with a 10-year projection of $2.8 trillion. ""We think that's probably low,"" Bessent said during a July 8 Cabinet meeting.\
\
Though foreign countries don't pay the tariffs directly--U.S. importers do--Trump maintains that these levies create pressure on foreign governments, encourage domestic manufacturing, and generate vital revenue. Critics warn the costs are often passed on to consumers through higher prices.\
\
The European Union, while not yet among those targeted in the latest wave, is reportedly pursuing an outline deal with the U.S. ""within days or weeks"" and expects to retain a 10% baseline tariff under any final agreement. Meanwhile, Trump's team has hinted that more letters will be issued in the coming days.\
\
All Eyes on August\
\
With the August 1 deadline fast approaching, the administration is holding firm. Trump's letters suggest some room for negotiation, stating: ""These tariffs may be modified, upward or downward, depending on our relationship with your country.""\
\
The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, is closely monitoring the economic effects of the tariff regime. Minutes from its June meeting released Wednesday indicate Chair Jerome Powell is taking a cautious approach to cutting interest rates--despite Trump's claim that the U.S. is losing $360 billion annually due to elevated refinancing costs.\
\
As the tariff showdown escalates, Trump's message remains clear: the era of unchecked trade deficits is over, and nations must either deal--or face the consequences. \

I’m looking to upgrade my current PC setup with one specific goal in mind: playing Satisfactory at 4K / 60 FPS on my TV, ideally with smooth and stable performance.

I think I mostly just need a GPU upgrade, and maybe a PSU, but I’ve been out of the hardware loop for a while. My main concern is whether my older Coffee Lake CPU (i7-8700K) will hold me back—will I be CPU-bound in Satisfactory, even with a newer GPU?

Right now, I’m considering either the RTX 5070 Ti or RX 9700 XT. Does Satisfactory tend to favor NVIDIA or AMD, or does it really not make a difference? I’m also open to other GPU suggestions if there’s a better fit for this game and my setup.

I’d love any advice to make sure I’m upgrading smart and not throwing money at performance I can’t fully use.

Here are my current specs:
	•	CPU: Intel Core i7-8700K (not overclocked, not a Silicon Lottery Winner 😔)
	•	Cooler: Noctua NH-D15
	•	Motherboard: ASRock Z370 Pro4 ATX

She couldn't have mistaken it—that was Lydia Ritter, her half-sister. She just didn't get what Lydia was doing with Colin in the next room. On shaky legs, Jane staggered to the door and pushed it open, making her way to the master bedroom. This was supposed to be her and Colin's space. She had come here today to prepare it for their wedding night, arranging a few personal touches to make it feel special. ""So what? You're so much better than that shameless Jane. What right does she have to question you?"" Colin's cold voice cut through the air. Jane's hand froze on the doorknob. She thought, 'Colin... it's really him inside? He actually thinks of me like that?' Lydia continued, ""Colin, I had no idea you felt that way about me. It's such a shame you're marrying Jane tomorrow. Poor you—Jane is so desperate. Everyone in Jovinia knows she threw herself at professors and judges last year just to win that award."" Colin sneered, ""Don't worry about it. The wedding is off. Jane isn't good enough to marry me. I've already told your father—I won't marry a woman like her. Tomorrow, Jane will just be a fool who got left at the altar."" Jane's spirits plummeted. Her eyes widened in disbelief as the words struck her like a punch to the gut. This was Colin, her boyfriend for years. He had always promised to trust her, to stand by her no matter what. But now, he was choosing to believe the rumors—that she had slept with professors and judges to win a jewelry design award. And now he even messed with Lydia in their bedroom. A wave of anger and hurt surged through Jane. She wanted to storm in and confront Colin, to demand answers. But as she took a step, her legs gave way, and she nearly collapsed. Her head spun, the fever making her feel weak and dizzy. But she couldn't let them see her like this. She forced herself to take a deep breath and stumbled out of the room. The elevator doors closed behind her with a gentle, polished swoosh, and suddenly, she felt her resolve crumble. She sank to the floor, tears slipping silently down her cheeks. After being framed and expelled from college, she had thought Colin was the only one who would still believe in her. But he had let her down. She didn't understand—if he didn't trust her, why had he given her hope in the first place? The elevator dinged softly. Jane was still sitting on the marble floor, her hair a mess, eyes red and tear-streaked. Only her slender lower leg, peeking out from under her skirt, looked untouched—smooth and perfectly shaped. ""Who are you?"" The voice was deep and cool, with a hint of impatience, drifting in from outside the elevator. Jane blinked, her mind foggy. She looked up and realized the elevator had reached the top floor. The doors were wide open, and there stood a tall man, wrapped in a dark robe. His hair was damp and tousled, and his eyes were cold and piercing. The robe gaped slightly, revealing a chiseled frame that made her heart skip a beat. His face was sharp and handsome, with an unusual flush to his cheeks. Jane took a deep breath. She remembered that this building, one of the most exclusive in the city, had only one apartment per floor. The higher the floor, the more prestigious the resident. Even Colin, with his wealthy background, could only afford a middle-floor unit. And the elevators required a card key to operate, and each key was programmed to access only the owner's specific floor. So this man had to be the penthouse owner. ""I—"" she started. But the man's brows twitched with irritation. His eyes flashed with anger. ""You didn't shower before you came,"" he said, more a statement than a question. Before Jane could even respond, the man's fingers were already gripping her chin. He studied her as if she were some object he was evaluating. ""Ouch... that hurts..."" Jane's voice was barely a whisper, soft and breathy. She was startled by how delicate she sounded, as if she were someone else entirely. But the soft sound seemed to please him. His grip eased just a little, and he tilted his head, taking in her flushed face. Her face, red from her cold, looked even more enticing without makeup, like a ripe, juicy peach. ""Just remember to take a shower next time. I like women who are clean,"" he said, his voice smooth and low. He bent down and lifted her into his arms. Her hands instinctively clutched at his robe as she let out a scream. ""Sir, I'm not—"" she started, confusion washing over her. Before she could finish, he silenced her with a hard kiss, pinching her chin again. Ignoring her protests, he carried her straight into the apartment. She realized in an instant—he'd mistaken her for someone else. He thought she was the kind of woman who came to him willingly. The door slammed shut behind her. Jane felt herself pushed against it by the man's firm grip. His cool, masculine scent, mingled with the raw energy, hit her all at once. This was her first kiss. She'd been with Colin for so long, and they'd never crossed this line. ""Sir, please—"" Her voice was cut short. The kiss was intense and forceful, and Jane, inexperienced, found herself unable to resist. Her legs felt weak, and she went limp, relying on his arms to hold her up. ""Remember, I don't like women talking too much at a time like this,"" he warned, gently but firmly slapping her hip. Jane trembled, her whole small body shaking. Jane looked up at him, her vision blurred by tears, but the dim light in the apartment made his face unclear. She smelled faintly of tuberose—something sweet, with a touch of mystery. He held her waist firmly and murmured in a deep, rough voice, ""I love your scent. So sweet... Stay still."" Jane went rigid, feeling his breath on her ear. She suddenly realized just how intense the man holding her was. His grip was unnaturally strong, and she couldn't break free. ""Sir... you don't seem right..."" she managed to whisper, her voice strained. Before she could finish, her last piece of clothing was ripped off violently, leaving her exposed. Chapter 2 One Year Later Suddenly, the man's eyes, tense with desire, flickered with a hint of suspicion. He frowned at Jane, wondering if she had been handpicked to get him out of this mess. ""You've never done this before?"" he murmured softly. Jane shook her head, her sobs turning into choked cries as she buried her face in his shoulder, biting down to stifle the pain. He gentled his hold on her waist, his expression softening. He pressed a soft kiss to her tear-streaked face, his voice soothing. ""Shh, it's okay. Remember, I'm your first. I'll take care of you. \*\*\*\*\* One year later, in Jovinia, the dim light of the Night Charm Club's private room cast long shadows. Don, a wealthy middle-aged man, his hair thinning and his belly straining against his shirt, leaned back with an air of self-importance. He said, ""Marry me, and I'll give you a thousand bucks a month. But I'm not paying for someone who can't pull their weight. You're young—twenty-two. Plenty of time to give me an heir. If it doesn't work out the first time, we'll just keep trying. "" He paused, his gaze turning cold as he looked at Jane. ""I know you've been with Colin, but I'm okay with that. As long as you're a good, obedient housewife, I won't mind your past."" Jane sat across from him, instinctively pulling back as his spittle flew with each word. She frowned, puzzled why her Lily had sent her to this club, to meet a man old enough to be her father. She wouldn't have come if it weren't for her mother's medical bills—a weapon Lily had used to manipulate her. ""So, sweetheart,"" Don said, his tone suddenly stern, ""got any questions about me? Or demands?"" Jane hadn't even been listening. She blinked and shook her head. ""No."" Don's stern expression softened into a patronizing smile. ""Figured as much. Marrying a guy like me is more than you deserve. A girl with a reputation like yours—who else would want you? Only someone like me would take you in. ""Come on, tell me. Besides Colin last year, who else have you been with? Spill it."" As he spoke, Don edged closer to Jane, his movements unnervingly suggestive, while she remained preoccupied. As Don mentioned last year, a tall, indistinct figure with vague features involuntarily surfaced in Jane's mind. A year ago, in that apartment, she'd caught Colin and Lydia cheating. But with a raging fever, she'd stumbled into the top-floor apartment and ended up with a guy she barely remembered. The next day, she left without even recalling his face clearly. When her family saw her coming home disheveled, the scandal erupted. Her reputation was ruined. Yet Colin had played the victim, jetting off abroad with Lydia to live it up carefree. ""Nothing to tell. Don, I'm leaving,"" Jane said, grabbing her bag and standing up. She was disgusted by Don's closeness. ""Hey, who said you could leave?"" Don grabbed Jane from behind and forced her back onto the sofa. His breath was hot and reeking. ""I paid a fortune for this whole floor. You're not going anywhere without my say-so."" ""Let me go!"" Jane twisted away, using her bag to shield herself. ""If you don't let me go, I'm calling the police."" She'd never imagined that agreeing to a blind date with her uncle and aunt would lead to meeting a man as repulsive as Don. ""Fine, call the cops,"" Don sneered. ""When they get here, they'll see how you're all over me. Your reputation in Jovinia is terrible—no one's gonna believe I spiked your drink."" ""What did you say?"" Jane's voice trembled. Don grinned wickedly. ""Heh, feeling hot? Want me to help you out?"" As Don's face blurred before her eyes, Jane felt herself burning. She realized her coffee must have been spiked. Seeing Jane's flushed face and glazed-over eyes, Don knew the drug was taking effect. He giggled, rubbing his hands together, and moved closer to her. Suddenly, the lights flickered and then went out completely. In the pitch black, a tall, imposing figure silently leaped in from the balcony outside the private room. ""Who are you? Who sent you—"" Don's voice was cut short as the stranger swiftly knocked him out with a precise hand chop, then dragged him into the restroom. Jane's mind was still racing, trying to make sense of what was happening, when she felt a large, cold hand clamp over her mouth. The air around him smelled of cold steel and something darker—blood. ""Don't make a sound if you want to stay safe,"" he growled. Jane's body tensed. The man reeked of danger, and the scent of blood was almost overpowering. Frantic footsteps approached the door. The man's eyes narrowed, and he pulled Jane closer, pressing her against him as he moved silently to the door. Her heart was pounding so hard she could barely think. She felt dizzy and feverish, but there was something oddly familiar about the man holding her—like a shadow from a year ago, a memory she couldn't quite place. Jane tried to pull away, but her body was weak from the drug. Instead, she found herself pressing closer to him, seeking some kind of refuge. ""Don, are you there? What's going on inside? Did anyone suspicious come by?"" a voice called from outside the door. The man pinched her waist, and a soft moan escaped her lips. The person outside, hearing the sound, assumed Don had succeeded. ""Damn it, he didn't come upstairs. Get more people down to search now. If he escapes tonight, we're all dead meat,"" someone shouted from outside. The chaotic footsteps finally faded into the distance. Jane's tension eased. She instinctively tried to pull away from the man's embrace, but her legs gave out beneath her, and she slumped back into his arms. ""Feels... so good..."" Her chin brushed against the man's broad, solid chest, and she let out a soft, instinctive murmur. The air was filled with a faint, sweet scent that was uniquely hers. ""'Is that you?'"" the man, Luke Drake, bent down to steady Jane as she nearly collapsed. Her familiar scent—sweet and mysterious, with a hint of tuberose—filled his senses. That night a year ago, as the haze of the drugs cleared, Jane had already vanished from the apartment. The drugs had scrambled his memory, and he couldn't recall her face at all. All he remembered was the faint, special scent on her, like the sweetness of tuberoses. After a year of searching for her high and low, he had unexpectedly run into her at this club today. And now, she was burning up and acting strangely. ""What are you doing here?"" He lifted her gently, his voice deep and rough with emotion. ""Me? I'm here...um... for a blind date."" Jane's voice was soft and drowsy as she tilted her head to the side. In the dim light, Luke's face seemed to blur into multiple images. She felt so hot and miserable, but his closeness felt so familiar and comforting. The mention of a blind date made Luke's brows furrow. He had been searching for her for a year, and here she was, on a blind date. Recalling what Don looked like, Luke narrowed his eyes coldly. He leaned down in the dark and kissed her, his voice rough. ""What a coincidence. You've saved me again."" He cupped her chin, his fingers firm yet gentle. Then he kissed her, a storm of passion—fierce, unyielding, and tinged with a dangerous kind of desire. Luke remembered that day, the day he'd promised to be there for her. But she had slipped away before the drugs faded. She'd made him break his word for the first time. Anyway, she had saved him back then. And now, here she was again, surprising him in the most unexpected way. There she was, nestled in his arms, her soft body instinctively pressing closer. She looked so innocent, so vulnerable. It was a sight that stirred something in Luke, something he'd never felt before. He was known for keeping his distance, for avoiding the complications that came with getting close to anyone. But with her, everything felt different. Jane was confused. She didn't know who Luke was or what he was talking about. Her heart pounded in her chest, and her body felt like it was on fire. Part of her wanted to run, to escape the intensity of the moment. But another part of her wanted to stay, to lean into him, to feel his warmth just a little bit longer. Before she could make up her mind, he bent down, lifting her effortlessly in his strong arms. The kiss deepened as he pressed her against the door, his body a solid, reassuring presence. His fingers found her chin again, holding her gaze. His kisses were demanding, each one more intense than the last, leaving her breathless and dazed. Jane felt her body go limp, her strength melting away. She responded instinctively, her reactions unfamiliar yet driven by a newfound desire. She surrendered to his dominant advances, feeling both vulnerable and alive. ""Please... no, we can't,"" she managed to whisper, her voice barely audible. ""We can do this. I'll take care of you, as I've promised,"" he murmured, his voice low and steady. Her resistance melted under the weight of his kisses, each one more insistent than the last. When a wave of panic threatened to overwhelm her, she bit down on his shoulder, hard. Time seemed to stand still as they remained entwined, each moment stretching into the next, like an eternity. \*\*\*\*\* It was three in the morning, and finally, it was over. Jane had fallen asleep, utterly exhausted. As the last traces of the drugs left her system, she nestled in Luke's arms, her face buried against his chest. The way she clung to him, so trusting and endearing, made Luke's eyes narrow in a satisfied, almost possessive way. A sliver of moonlight slipped through the window, landing on Jane's face, partially hidden by her dark hair. Then Luke realized he had never really seen her face clearly before. Gently, he lifted his hand from her waist and reached to brush the hair away from her cheek. Chapter 3 My Boss Wants To See You Suddenly, the phone jolted them both from the quiet. In the darkness, Luke frowned and pulled his hand back from Jane's face. He picked up the phone beside him. ""Hello."" It was Harvey, his assistant. Harvey said, ""Mr. Drake, we're glad you're safe. We've got your location. There's an emergency in Dorvania. The car's waiting downstairs."" Luke hung up and looked down at Jane, still fast asleep in his arms. He tried to lift her. But she murmured, ""Uh... I'm so tired. Stop."" Her hand pushed weakly against his, and she buried herself deeper into the blanket, too sleepy to even open her eyes. Seeing how exhausted she was, Luke slipped his obsidian ring onto her finger. ""Stay here and wait for me. Someone will come for you later."" \*\*\*\*\* A week later, at the Judd residence, the evening rain was pouring down in sheets. Jane pounded on the door, her fists thumping against the wood. The noise cut through the storm. She shouted, ""Johnson, Lily, open up! You promised that if I went on that date at Night Charm, you'd take care of Mom. So why did the hospital say you cut off her medical support—and even want to pull the plug? You can't just do this!"" The door finally creaked open. Her aunt Lily stood there, her face dripping with irritation. ""Jane, still showing up here for money? How shameless! ""Check the news. Ever since you met Don last Friday, he's pulled all his investments from our company. Now he's ghosting us, not picking up our calls. You must've ticked him off during that date. ""Don't think so high of yourself. You're just a nobody. Don was doing you a favor. Sleeping with him wouldn't have killed you, so stop pretending to be so high and mighty."" Jane's face drained of color. ""What? You told me to go on that date. You said you were worried about me being alone. You said I should marry a good man and make Mom feel better. ""But it was all a lie? Y-you never saw me as family. You just wanted to use me to get some investment for the company."" Then it hit her. It wasn't just a coincidence. Johnson and Lily had known all along that Don was after her. It was obvious he wanted her. No wonder Lily had spoken so highly of him—that creepy, disgusting old man who could have been her father. She kept replaying that night in her head. Don had spiked her coffee during the date. If she hadn't run into Luke, she'd never have made it out of there. And yet, here she was, back with Luke. The one who'd promised to be there for her, twice now. But he was gone again, just like before. All that remained was a black obsidian ring. She didn't even know what he looked like. It was only when she got home and saw herself in the mirror—love bites and kisses all over her skin—that she knew it hadn't been a dream. Jane yelled, ""Lily, how can you do this to me? You know your plan led me to some guy at that club? And he—"" ""Some guy? What guy?"" Lily's eyes narrowed, catching the slip. ""So you're a shameless tramp after all. Skipping out on Don to sleep with some random guy? No wonder Don hates us. ""We've done enough for you and your mom. Not a penny more for her medical bills. Get out of here, now!"" Lily turned and barked at Johnson, who was standing behind her, to throw out Jane's luggage. Seconds later, a black plastic bag filled with a few clothes was flung at Jane. Lily sneered, ""Get out of here before my Ella gets home and sees you. She'll be furious."" Jane's eyes blazed with fury. If it weren't for her mom Rose, lying in the hospital waiting for her to save her life, she would have fought Lily right there. Jane picked up the bag, her face darkening. ""No, something's missing. Where's the Larmes Sacrées Éternelles my mom gave me? Why isn't it in here?"" The perfume Larmes Sacrées Éternelles was her mom Rose's favorite scent. When Rose was still wealthy, she had bought it at an auction abroad; it was the last bottle in the world. Rose always loved it when Jane wore that scent, saying it suited Jane perfectly and brought back memories of Rose's own youth. Every time Jane visited Rose in the hospital, she would spray a little. The last time Jane used it was a week ago, before going to the club. Since then, she hadn't been back to the Judd residence, let alone use it again. ""What Larmes Sacrées Éternelles? I don't know what you're talking about."" A flicker of guilt crossed Lily's face. ""Forget it. I'll go look for it myself,"" Jane said. ""Over my dead body,"" Lily shouted and pushed Jane away. As they jostled, Lily caught a glint of something under Jane's collar. ""Hold on, you little sneak. What's that you've got around your neck?"" Lily's hand shot out like a flash, yanking the necklace right off Jane's neck and snapping it clean in two. A ring, studded with diamonds and set in obsidian, tumbled from the broken chain into Lily's grasp. She sneered, ""Whoa, look what we have here. You've been hiding quite the treasure, haven't you?"" ""No, give it back. It's mine,"" Jane cried. That ring was the only clue she had left from Luke. It was her lifeline to finding him.",2,1752850789.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

""Colin, stop... please. This is your room with Jane."" A woman's soft, teasing voice floated from the master bedroom of the suite next door.

At this sound, Jane Ritter's eyes flew open, and she sat up abruptly. Her wedding to Colin Drake was tomorrow. She'd come to decorate their home despite her high fever, but she passed out soon later.

She wondered, 'Am I hallucinating? I think I must have heard Lydia's voice... Why?'

""What if Jane finds out about us?"" The gentle voice broke the silence again, and Jane's heart sank. She couldn't have mistaken it—that was Lydia Ritter, her half-sister. She just didn't get what Lydia was doing with Colin in the next room.

On shaky legs, Jane staggered to the door and pushed it open, making her way to the master bedroom.

This was supposed to be her and Colin's space. She had come here today to prepare it for their wedding night, arranging a few personal touches to make it feel special.

""So what? You're so much better than that shameless Jane. What right does she have to question you?"" Colin's cold voice cut through the air.

Jane's hand froze on the doorknob. She thought, 'Colin... it's really him inside? He actually thinks of me like that?'

Lydia continued, ""Colin, I had no idea you felt that way about me. It's such a shame you're marrying Jane tomorrow. Poor you—Jane is so desperate. Everyone in Jovinia knows she threw herself at professors and judges last year just to win that award.""

Colin sneered, ""Don't worry about it. The wedding is off. Jane isn't good enough to marry me. I've already told your father—I won't marry a woman like her. Tomorrow, Jane will just be a fool who got left at the altar.""

Jane's spirits plummeted. Her eyes widened in disbelief as the words struck her like a punch to the gut. This was Colin, her boyfriend for years. He had always promised to trust her, to stand by her no matter what.

But now, he was choosing to believe the rumors—that she had slept with professors and judges to win a jewelry design award. And now he even messed with Lydia in their bedroom.

A wave of anger and hurt surged through Jane. She wanted to storm in and confront Colin, to demand answers.

But as she took a step, her legs gave way, and she nearly collapsed. Her head spun, the fever making her feel weak and dizzy.

But she couldn't let them see her like this. She forced herself to take a deep breath and stumbled out of the room.

The elevator doors closed behind her with a gentle, polished swoosh, and suddenly, she felt her resolve crumble. She sank to the floor, tears slipping silently down her cheeks.

After being framed and expelled from college, she had thought Colin was the only one who would still believe in her. But he had let her down. She didn't understand—if he didn't trust her, why had he given her hope in the first place?

The elevator dinged softly. Jane was still sitting on the marble floor, her hair a mess, eyes red and tear-streaked. Only her slender lower leg, peeking out from under her skirt, looked untouched—smooth and perfectly shaped.

""Who are you?"" The voice was deep and cool, with a hint of impatience, drifting in from outside the elevator.

Jane blinked, her mind foggy. She looked up and realized the elevator had reached the top floor. The doors were wide open, and there stood a tall man, wrapped in a dark robe.

His hair was damp and tousled, and his eyes were cold and piercing. The robe gaped slightly, revealing a chiseled frame that made her heart skip a beat. His face was sharp and handsome, with an unusual flush to his cheeks.

Jane took a deep breath. She remembered that this building, one of the most exclusive in the city, had only one apartment per floor. The higher the floor, the more prestigious the resident. Even Colin, with his wealthy background, could only afford a middle-floor unit.

And the elevators required a card key to operate, and each key was programmed to access only the owner's specific floor. So this man had to be the penthouse owner.

""I—"" she started.

But the man's brows twitched with irritation. His eyes flashed with anger. ""You didn't shower before you came,"" he said, more a statement than a question.

Before Jane could even respond, the man's fingers were already gripping her chin. He studied her as if she were some object he was evaluating.

""Ouch... that hurts..."" Jane's voice was barely a whisper, soft and breathy. She was startled by how delicate she sounded, as if she were someone else entirely.

But the soft sound seemed to please him. His grip eased just a little, and he tilted his head, taking in her flushed face. Her face, red from her cold, looked even more enticing without makeup, like a ripe, juicy peach.

""Just remember to take a shower next time. I like women who are clean,"" he said, his voice smooth and low. He bent down and lifted her into his arms.

Her hands instinctively clutched at his robe as she let out a scream. ""Sir, I'm not—"" she started, confusion washing over her.

Before she could finish, he silenced her with a hard kiss, pinching her chin again. Ignoring her protests, he carried her straight into the apartment.

She realized in an instant—he'd mistaken her for someone else. He thought she was the kind of woman who came to him willingly.

The door slammed shut behind her. Jane felt herself pushed against it by the man's firm grip. His cool, masculine scent, mingled with the raw energy, hit her all at once.

This was her first kiss. She'd been with Colin for so long, and they'd never crossed this line.

""Sir, please—"" Her voice was cut short.

The kiss was intense and forceful, and Jane, inexperienced, found herself unable to resist. Her legs felt weak, and she went limp, relying on his arms to hold her up.

""Remember, I don't like women talking too much at a time like this,"" he warned, gently but firmly slapping her hip.

Jane trembled, her whole small body shaking.

Jane looked up at him, her vision blurred by tears, but the dim light in the apartment made his face unclear.

She smelled faintly of tuberose—something sweet, with a touch of mystery. He held her waist firmly and murmured in a deep, rough voice, ""I love your scent. So sweet... Stay still.""

Jane went rigid, feeling his breath on her ear. She suddenly realized just how intense the man holding her was. His grip was unnaturally strong, and she couldn't break free. ""Sir... you don't seem right..."" she managed to whisper, her voice strained.

Before she could finish, her last piece of clothing was ripped off violently, leaving her exposed.

# Chapter 2 One Year Later

Suddenly, the man's eyes, tense with desire, flickered with a hint of suspicion. He frowned at Jane, wondering if she had been handpicked to get him out of this mess. ""You've never done this before?"" he murmured softly.

Jane shook her head, her sobs turning into choked cries as she buried her face in his shoulder, biting down to stifle the pain.

He gentled his hold on her waist, his expression softening. He pressed a soft kiss to her tear-streaked face, his voice soothing. ""Shh, it's okay. Remember, I'm your first. I'll take care of you.

\*\*\*\*\*

One year later, in Jovinia, the dim light of the Night Charm Club's private room cast long shadows. Don, a wealthy middle-aged man, his hair thinning and his belly straining against his shirt, leaned back with an air of self-importance.

He said, ""Marry me, and I'll give you a thousand bucks a month. But I'm not paying for someone who can't pull their weight. You're young—twenty-two. Plenty of time to give me an heir. If it doesn't work out the first time, we'll just keep trying. ""

He paused, his gaze turning cold as he looked at Jane. ""I know you've been with Colin, but I'm okay with that. As long as you're a good, obedient housewife, I won't mind your past.""

Jane sat across from him, instinctively pulling back as his spittle flew with each word. She frowned, puzzled why her Lily had sent her to this club, to meet a man old enough to be her father.

She wouldn't have come if it weren't for her mother's medical bills—a weapon Lily had used to manipulate her.

""So, sweetheart,"" Don said, his tone suddenly stern, ""got any questions about me? Or demands?""

Jane hadn't even been listening. She blinked and shook her head. ""No.""

Don's stern expression softened into a patronizing smile. ""Figured as much. Marrying a guy like me is more than you deserve. A girl with a reputation like yours—who else would want you? Only someone like me would take you in.

""Come on, tell me. Besides Colin last year, who else have you been with? Spill it."" As he spoke, Don edged closer to Jane, his movements unnervingly suggestive, while she remained preoccupied.

As Don mentioned last year, a tall, indistinct figure with vague features involuntarily surfaced in Jane's mind.

A year ago, in that apartment, she'd caught Colin and Lydia cheating. But with a raging fever, she'd stumbled into the top-floor apartment and ended up with a guy she barely remembered. The next day, she left without even recalling his face clearly.

When her family saw her coming home disheveled, the scandal erupted. Her reputation was ruined. Yet Colin had played the victim, jetting off abroad with Lydia to live it up carefree.

""Nothing to tell. Don, I'm leaving,"" Jane said, grabbing her bag and standing up. She was disgusted by Don's closeness.

""Hey, who said you could leave?"" Don grabbed Jane from behind and forced her back onto the sofa. His breath was hot and reeking. ""I paid a fortune for this whole floor. You're not going anywhere without my say-so.""

""Let me go!"" Jane twisted away, using her bag to shield herself. ""If you don't let me go, I'm calling the police.""

She'd never imagined that agreeing to a blind date with her uncle and aunt would lead to meeting a man as repulsive as Don.

""Fine, call the cops,"" Don sneered. ""When they get here, they'll see how you're all over me. Your reputation in Jovinia is terrible—no one's gonna believe I spiked your drink.""

""What did you say?"" Jane's voice trembled.

Don grinned wickedly. ""Heh, feeling hot? Want me to help you out?""

As Don's face blurred before her eyes, Jane felt herself burning. She realized her coffee must have been spiked.

Seeing Jane's flushed face and glazed-over eyes, Don knew the drug was taking effect. He giggled, rubbing his hands together, and moved closer to her.

Suddenly, the lights flickered and then went out completely. In the pitch black, a tall, imposing figure silently leaped in from the balcony outside the private room.

""Who are you? Who sent you—"" Don's voice was cut short as the stranger swiftly knocked him out with a precise hand chop, then dragged him into the restroom.

Jane's mind was still racing, trying to make sense of what was happening, when she felt a large, cold hand clamp over her mouth. The air around him smelled of cold steel and something darker—blood. ""Don't make a sound if you want to stay safe,"" he growled.

Jane's body tensed. The man reeked of danger, and the scent of blood was almost overpowering.

Frantic footsteps approached the door. The man's eyes narrowed, and he pulled Jane closer, pressing her against him as he moved silently to the door.

Her heart was pounding so hard she could barely think. She felt dizzy and feverish, but there was something oddly familiar about the man holding her—like a shadow from a year ago, a memory she couldn't quite place.

Jane tried to pull away, but her body was weak from the drug. Instead, she found herself pressing closer to him, seeking some kind of refuge.

""Don, are you there? What's going on inside? Did anyone suspicious come by?"" a voice called from outside the door.

The man pinched her waist, and a soft moan escaped her lips.

The person outside, hearing the sound, assumed Don had succeeded.

""Damn it, he didn't come upstairs. Get more people down to search now. If he escapes tonight, we're all dead meat,"" someone shouted from outside.

The chaotic footsteps finally faded into the distance. Jane's tension eased. She instinctively tried to pull away from the man's embrace, but her legs gave out beneath her, and she slumped back into his arms.

""Feels... so good..."" Her chin brushed against the man's broad, solid chest, and she let out a soft, instinctive murmur. The air was filled with a faint, sweet scent that was uniquely hers.

""'Is that you?'"" the man, Luke Drake, bent down to steady Jane as she nearly collapsed. Her familiar scent—sweet and mysterious, with a hint of tuberose—filled his senses.

That night a year ago, as the haze of the drugs cleared, Jane had already vanished from the apartment. The drugs had scrambled his memory, and he couldn't recall her face at all. All he remembered was the faint, special scent on her, like the sweetness of tuberoses.

After a year of searching for her high and low, he had unexpectedly run into her at this club today. And now, she was burning up and acting strangely.

""What are you doing here?"" He lifted her gently, his voice deep and rough with emotion.

""Me? I'm here...um... for a blind date."" Jane's voice was soft and drowsy as she tilted her head to the side.

In the dim light, Luke's face seemed to blur into multiple images. She felt so hot and miserable, but his closeness felt so familiar and comforting.

The mention of a blind date made Luke's brows furrow. He had been searching for her for a year, and here she was, on a blind date.

Recalling what Don looked like, Luke narrowed his eyes coldly. He leaned down in the dark and kissed her, his voice rough. ""What a coincidence. You've saved me again.""

He cupped her chin, his fingers firm yet gentle. Then he kissed her, a storm of passion—fierce, unyielding, and tinged with a dangerous kind of desire.

Luke remembered that day, the day he'd promised to be there for her. But she had slipped away before the drugs faded. She'd made him break his word for the first time.

Anyway, she had saved him back then. And now, here she was again, surprising him in the most unexpected way.

There she was, nestled in his arms, her soft body instinctively pressing closer. She looked so innocent, so vulnerable. It was a sight that stirred something in Luke, something he'd never felt before.

He was known for keeping his distance, for avoiding the complications that came with getting close to anyone. But with her, everything felt different.

Jane was confused. She didn't know who Luke was or what he was talking about. Her heart pounded in her chest, and her body felt like it was on fire.

Part of her wanted to run, to escape the intensity of the moment. But another part of her wanted to stay, to lean into him, to feel his warmth just a little bit longer.

Before she could make up her mind, he bent down, lifting her effortlessly in his strong arms. The kiss deepened as he pressed her against the door, his body a solid, reassuring presence.

His fingers found her chin again, holding her gaze. His kisses were demanding, each one more intense than the last, leaving her breathless and dazed.

Jane felt her body go limp, her strength melting away. She responded instinctively, her reactions unfamiliar yet driven by a newfound desire. She surrendered to his dominant advances, feeling both vulnerable and alive.

""Please... no, we can't,"" she managed to whisper, her voice barely audible.

""We can do this. I'll take care of you, as I've promised,"" he murmured, his voice low and steady.

Her resistance melted under the weight of his kisses, each one more insistent than the last. When a wave of panic threatened to overwhelm her, she bit down on his shoulder, hard.

Time seemed to stand still as they remained entwined, each moment stretching into the next, like an eternity.

\*\*\*\*\*

It was three in the morning, and finally, it was over. Jane had fallen asleep, utterly exhausted. As the last traces of the drugs left her system, she nestled in Luke's arms, her face buried against his chest.

The way she clung to him, so trusting and endearing, made Luke's eyes narrow in a satisfied, almost possessive way.

A sliver of moonlight slipped through the window, landing on Jane's face, partially hidden by her dark hair. Then Luke realized he had never really seen her face clearly before.

Gently, he lifted his hand from her waist and reached to brush the hair away from her cheek.

# Chapter 3 My Boss Wants To See You

Suddenly, the phone jolted them both from the quiet. In the darkness, Luke frowned and pulled his hand back from Jane's face. He picked up the phone beside him. ""Hello.""

It was Harvey, his assistant. Harvey said, ""Mr. Drake, we're glad you're safe. We've got your location. There's an emergency in Dorvania. The car's waiting downstairs.""

Luke hung up and looked down at Jane, still fast asleep in his arms. He tried to lift her.

But she murmured, ""Uh... I'm so tired. Stop."" Her hand pushed weakly against his, and she buried herself deeper into the blanket, too sleepy to even open her eyes.

Seeing how exhausted she was, Luke slipped his obsidian ring onto her finger. ""Stay here and wait for me. Someone will come for you later.""

\*\*\*\*\*

A week later, at the Judd residence, the evening rain was pouring down in sheets. Jane pounded on the door, her fists thumping against the wood. The noise cut through the storm.

She shouted, ""Johnson, Lily, open up! You promised that if I went on that date at Night Charm, you'd take care of Mom. So why did the hospital say you cut off her medical support—and even want to pull the plug? You can't just do this!""

The door finally creaked open. Her aunt Lily stood there, her face dripping with irritation. ""Jane, still showing up here for money? How shameless!

""Check the news. Ever since you met Don last Friday, he's pulled all his investments from our company. Now he's ghosting us, not picking up our calls. You must've ticked him off during that date.

""Don't think so high of yourself. You're just a nobody. Don was doing you a favor. Sleeping with him wouldn't have killed you, so stop pretending to be so high and mighty.""

Jane's face drained of color. ""What? You told me to go on that date. You said you were worried about me being alone. You said I should marry a good man and make Mom feel better.

""But it was all a lie? Y-you never saw me as family. You just wanted to use me to get some investment for the company.""

Then it hit her. It wasn't just a coincidence. Johnson and Lily had known all along that Don was after her. It was obvious he wanted her. No wonder Lily had spoken so highly of him—that creepy, disgusting old man who could have been her father.

She kept replaying that night in her head. Don had spiked her coffee during the date. If she hadn't run into Luke, she'd never have made it out of there.

And yet, here she was, back with Luke. The one who'd promised to be there for her, twice now. But he was gone again, just like before. All that remained was a black obsidian ring. She didn't even know what he looked like.

It was only when she got home and saw herself in the mirror—love bites and kisses all over her skin—that she knew it hadn't been a dream.

Jane yelled, ""Lily, how can you do this to me? You know your plan led me to some guy at that club? And he—""

""Some guy? What guy?"" Lily's eyes narrowed, catching the slip. ""So you're a shameless tramp after all. Skipping out on Don to sleep with some random guy? No wonder Don hates us.

""We've done enough for you and your mom. Not a penny more for her medical bills. Get out of here, now!""

Lily turned and barked at Johnson, who was standing behind her, to throw out Jane's luggage.

Seconds later, a black plastic bag filled with a few clothes was flung at Jane. Lily sneered, ""Get out of here before my Ella gets home and sees you. She'll be furious.""

Jane's eyes blazed with fury. If it weren't for her mom Rose, lying in the hospital waiting for her to save her life, she would have fought Lily right there.

Jane picked up the bag, her face darkening. ""No, something's missing. Where's the Larmes Sacrées Éternelles my mom gave me? Why isn't it in here?""

The perfume Larmes Sacrées Éternelles was her mom Rose's favorite scent. When Rose was still wealthy, she had bought it at an auction abroad; it was the last bottle in the world.

Rose always loved it when Jane wore that scent, saying it suited Jane perfectly and brought back memories of Rose's own youth. Every time Jane visited Rose in the hospital, she would spray a little.

The last time Jane used it was a week ago, before going to the club. Since then, she hadn't been back to the Judd residence, let alone use it again.

""What Larmes Sacrées Éternelles? I don't know what you're talking about."" A flicker of guilt crossed Lily's face.

""Forget it. I'll go look for it myself,"" Jane said.

""Over my dead body,"" Lily shouted and pushed Jane away.

As they jostled, Lily caught a glint of something under Jane's collar. ""Hold on, you little sneak. What's that you've got around your neck?""

Lily's hand shot out like a flash, yanking the necklace right off Jane's neck and snapping it clean in two. A ring, studded with diamonds and set in obsidian, tumbled from the broken chain into Lily's grasp.

She sneered, ""Whoa, look what we have here. You've been hiding quite the treasure, haven't you?""

""No, give it back. It's mine,"" Jane cried. That ring was the only clue she had left from Luke. It was her lifeline to finding him.

""Get out of here. You and your mom owe us more than you'll ever repay. This ring is the payment. Try to take it, and you'll regret it."" Lily slapped Jane hard across the face, again and again, before shoving her out the door.

The iron gate slammed shut with a resounding bang, leaving Jane in the pouring rain. Neighbors peeked out their windows, snickering at her swollen face, at the girl who'd been kicked out like trash.

For a moment, Jane felt like she was drowning in despair. The man she'd thought would stand by her had vanished. The family she'd trusted had turned their backs on her. And her mom was still waiting for her help. She didn't know what she could do.

Then, out of nowhere, headlights blazed behind her. A sleek black Rolls-Royce pulled up beside her. A man stepped out. ""Ms. Jane Ritter? Our boss wants to see you.""

# Chapter 4 Get Married

Half an hour later, Jane was escorted to the penthouse of a luxury office tower in downtown.

It had been years since she'd been in such a high-end place. After her parents divorced, she and her mother had been kicked out of their home and had to rely on others for shelter.

Downstairs, she'd seen people dressed in sharp business suits, their faces cold and distant. It reminded her of Luke she'd encountered earlier, though his coldness had been sharper, more chilling.

Jane's thoughts drifted back to that night at the club a week ago. She remembered Luke, who had pressed her against the door. Her hands twisted nervously in her lap. She still had no idea who he was.

Suddenly, a shadow fell over her, blocking out the light. She looked up to see a pair of cold, piercing eyes.

Luke, the man standing before her, had sharp, chiseled features and an air of quiet menace. He was tall and broad-shouldered, and just his presence made her feel small and uneasy.

Jane's heart began to race. She felt an odd mix of fear and a strange sense of familiarity with Luke. It was as if she'd seen him somewhere before. But then, she wouldn't have forgotten someone like him.

""Ahem."" she began, straightening her posture. ""Sir, well, you want to see me?""

Jane looked at him earnestly. One cheek was still swollen from the earlier humiliation, but her eyes were clear and bright. In a way, she was grateful to him for pulling her out of that embarrassing situation with her neighbors.

Luke seemed surprised that she'd spoken first. His cold eyes narrowed just a bit, and his gaze lingered on her bruised face for a moment longer than necessary.

Then he spoke, his voice deep and smooth, but edged with a hint of menace, ""So, Ms. Ritter, are we pretending not to know each other now?""

Jane's heart skipped a beat. She didn't understand why he was saying this. She didn't remember a thing about him. She said, ""I think you have the wrong person, sir. I don't know you at all.""

He looked down at her, his cool eyes fixed on her puzzled face.",1,1752850694.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

But my first day from 75mg to 37.5mg when I was expecting the worst, actually went really well. I had some brain fog and an overall heaviness on my head but other than that no problems what so ever. I did a week and I thought ok slay I’m ready. 

I planned to either do the every other day as my pharmacist suggested or count capsules as you all suggested. But I was kind of lazy and cocky so I was like it’s fine I’ll probably be fine, I just won’t take the 37.5 today and see what happens. 

Ohhhhh hell, it was 9 am and I thought I was about to experience the double dragon all because I had 1 sip of coffee. To make matters worse I decided today was the day I was going to make some garlic sourdough and the smell of the garlic made me want to set my house on fire while I was clutching the toilet for dear life.

(Which yanno, takes place in the street) a few quotes below 👇

“you did it, you made good trouble, now please get out of the street”

“Get the f*ck out of the street you assholes!”

When Rev. Dr. MLK Jr. wrote the letter from a Birmingham jail, he specifically mentioned the actions of the crowd today and their strict adherence to law and order over rights and liberties others. Below is the excerpt:

Every year on Martin Luther King Day, I’m reminded of these words, from Letter from a Birmingham Jail:

“I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen’s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to “order” than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: “I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action”; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man’s freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a “more convenient season.”- Rev. Dr. MLK Jr.

It is disturbing yet fascinating that we got to see it happen again today at protest. That certain men and women attempted to get violent and confrontational with the people who know their history and understand what “good trouble” actually is.

Did MLK and John Lewis march in the streets? DUH

Did they cause disturbances and disruptions in segregated cities, segregated business, segregated buses? DOUBLE DUH

Did MLK and John Lewis break the f*cking law doing these activities? TRIPLE DUH

Do some you people out here divorce the reality of the Non Violent Direct Action and past civil rights movements and leaders actions whose memories and experiences you invoke to play dress up with and hold signs?

I think so. But that’s my personal opinion. I think the majority of the people at 50501 are the exact people , the exact mindset that made the civil rights movement so goddamn difficult.

And again, we are protesting a dictator that is throwing people in concentration camps…. Let’s just compare this for the folks who may be a little dense.

One occupied block and a march of Non-violent Protesters

vs.

-a secret police having a bigger budget than the marines -concentration camps -suspension of rights and laws and precedents -protecting powerful pedophiles -racist targeting of minorities communities

One of these things is over as of 9PM. The other 5 will continue to happen tomorrow. So yes liberals, you really need to unf*ck yourselves and figure out which is a threat to your liberty tomorrow when you sip your Starbucks coffee and chow down on BEC biscuit from Mc Donald’s. I mean it. Chew it over on your drive to work and figure out which one you should be angry at.

And the Media is going to do whatever the media wants to do sell more newspapers and ad revenue . I can’t believe I heard that excuse. What’s the matter. You think Fox News is going to suddenly change is rhetoric about protesters that don’t like Trump if everyone is a good model citizen at a protest.

Please. Grow the fuck up. These people want you dead. They intentionally lie to their audience about everything you stand for. Every day. They aren’t going to change their narrative,  or be fair, or be cavalier or anything remotely civilized toward you.

And no, not everyone in a mask or wearing black is out to start shit or turn a protest in riot. Most people who take the precautions to not to let fascists or DPD figure out their identities are playing it smart. Pick a history book and read about any fascist installed dictatorship supported by the United States Government and quickly find out what happened to the people who thought showing their face at a protest was a great idea.

If you think it won’t happen here, you are being absolutely foolish. DPD literally sent SWAT to your carnival and got so frustrated when everyone minded their Ps and Qs they decided to parade at the end up and down the streets to be assholes about it.

“Look at me, we have militarized gear, we get to play dress up for a riot that will never happen to intimidate protesters!” -DPD

If these words seem harsh or unfair or even inappropriate to harmful, consider your own conduct before firing back. This isn’t our first rodeo. We know what works and what doesn’t. Being cute and waving signs didn’t work in 1962. Still that way in 2025.

I do appreciate the people who had the INTEGRITY to come back and apologize and explain they assumed we were Bad trouble. The sort that makes the entire effort look terrible. I don’t think anyone out there who chooses to attend and march with the people, the groups and the movement are every single time are bad people. The time, the effort, the money and the actions are clearly from people who care about their neighbors. People who choose to support their neighbors regardless of status.

So in August I really hope most of y’all get a grip on reality and figure out why are you are there. I hope you take the time to discover the wonders of the internet and the fascinating effect education has on the mind. Since a lot of yall don’t know who John Lewis was clearly, start here and work backward thru the civil rights movement to figure out if you’re the white moderate or “radical liberal of the 1960s” marching with the oppressed, screaming for freedom.",3,1752850419.0,50501CO,0,1.0,False
1m34g2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullcity/comments/1m34g2o/wibta_coffee_house_version/,WIBTA? Coffee House Version,"This story is 100% true AND I am not completely serious in my question, but curious what others might do.

**Bullcity, Will I be the asshole if I confront a man that accosted me almost one year ago?**

**TL/DR: Man accosted me and I saw him a year later. Should I confront him?**

It all started on a nice early summer day in 2024. I decided to get a coffee from one of the south Durham coffee houses located in a shopping center. Also located within this shopping center is a mailing store/gift shop. Really kind people work at the mail center so this is no shade to them. The coffee shop and mail store share a section of parking located in front of each store, as they are across the street from each other. There are 15 minute parking signs in front of these parking spots. Once when I needed to go into 3 stores in the shopping center and would definitely be longer than 15 minutes, I asked someone working at the mail store if I could park there and after going into the mail store then to the coffee shop and then the wine store nearby. The worker at the mail center said to me ""sure, no one monitors the parking"".

On this day, all of the parking spots are full in front of the shops except for one in front of the mail store. No problem, I have parked there many times and walked right over. I am excited in anticipation for the caffeine to finally hit my blood stream. I know that I will be less than 15 minutes, as I am just taking a coffee to go, so I pull in front of the mail center and park.

As I shut my car door and walk on the walkway in front of the mail center, an older man, probably in his late 60's is coming out of the mail center. He holds the door open for me in anticipation of me walking in to the mail center and smiles at me. I smile back at him as I am walking by the door, and kindly say "" Oh, thank you anyway,  but I am actually walking over to the coffee shop instead.  I said this while pointing to the coffee shop.

The man's expression immediately changed from jovial, to dark, and he said curtly and rudely ""This parking is only for the mail center, MOVE YOUR CAR"". I was so caught off guard by his rapid shift in expression and tone. The way he told me to move my car was said as a command, as if I were in boot camp and he my sergeant. Confused, I said ""I am just popping over here for a coffee and will be right back."" I knew that I did not need to explain myself to this cantankerous stranger, but I did not want to escalate anything with someone potentially unhinged and so I spoke calmly as I continued to walk away. He the said loudly and aggressively ""MOVE YOUR CAR! YOU DON'T RESPECT SMALL BUSINESSES"". WTF. I honestly cannot remember the last time anyone spoke to me so rudely and in such a demeaning way (I am a woman about 25 years younger than this man but still considered middle age-ish) and at this point the interaction was so weird and aggressive that I just said to him in a direct tone     ""Do you work here?"" He responded with "" NO, BUT I AM A REGULAR PATRON"". OK. At this point, I don't have to take his shit and his tone. So I just sort of awkwardly laugh in disbelief and say to the parking bandit ""Have a nice day"" in a tone that indicated that I was removing myself from the conversation. Never once did I yell, curse, call him a name- I just chuckled and walked away in disbelief that a grown adult would behave this way for some imaginary slight.

I guess my laugh set him off further, because he yelled ""DON'T MOCK ME! PUTA."" As I am walking across the street to the coffee shop. At this point the folks sitting outside in the tables at the coffee shop are staring at me and him watching the drama unfold. I do not respond to his slur, and keep walking away from this crusty asshole. For those unfamilar, PUTA is spanish for ""Bitch"" and in some dialects ""whore"", etc. This also caught be off guard because this man was as white as the underside of a frogs ass and said PUTA in the whitest accent possible. I am not sure if this man called me this slang because I look somewhat latina ( My mom is Latina) or if he thought I wouldn't know what it meant. His motives for calling me that remain unclear.

After I walk into the coffee shop, I decide to sit it out and just wait for this man to leave. I am not a large person and I am a woman. This man is bigger, older and crustier. After my adrenaline wears off I tell the barista what happened and she apologized (she didn't need to) and said that the parking in front of both building are fair game for everyone. After ordering the coffee I went into the mail center and asked the person behind the counter if they knew the man who had just walked out. They said that he is a regular. I told them about the parking, and they again reiterated that anyone can park there as it is not monitored. I told them what the man called me and they just shook their heads and said ""we will talk to him"". It made me wonder if this was not the first encounter he has had there. I left and moved on.

Fast forward to about 6 months later and I am working remotely from another local coffee shop. As I am working, a group of older folks come in with scrabble like pieces to play a game. Lo and behold, I see this motherfucker in a group of all older woman and him, playing scrabble. I never forget a face, but part of me said ""it's been 6 months, maybe you are confusing him with someone else."" As I am walking by his scrabble game to get to the bathroom, I realize they are playing SPANISH scrabble and this is a group of older adults in some type spanish language club. So now I KNOW its him.

Folks, I have sat across from this man now for 6 months on a specific day of the week that I work remotely and his spanish club meets for scrabble at this coffee shop. The older ladies he sits with seem so nice. I wonder if they know he yells at younger woman  and calls them PUTA's in his free time. In fact, as I typed this entire thing out his beady little eyes were on his scrabble word spelling out words with his lady friends.

All of this leads me to this question....Folks of reddit, how would you respond? Continue to ignore him? Say something like ""Hey, do you remember me?"" or let it go. I know the mature answer, but curious what others would do.",1,1752850396.0,bullcity,39,0.52,False
1m34fvu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m34fvu,Is there something more suited than a bowtie here?  Any other recommendations?,"My first live edge project; this will be a coffee table in my own home.  It's pretty stable, I bought it the week that covid first broke the world, it's been moved several times and IMO has not warped or cracked very noticeably since that time 5 years ago.  

I've got it mostly debarked (sidenote, a curved draw knife was a life saver here! SO much faster and better than using the chisels I started out with) and I'm starting to work on some of the rough edges and things. I'm thinking about next steps such as stabilizing some of the cracks, before I flatten spots on the bottom to attach iron legs to. For the legs, I found a tutorial using a router sled setup to make sure the legs are all placed at the same height so that the table stands flat in relation to the floor even though the slab itself is not flat. 

Questions:  
Pics 1 & 2 - Will a bowtie be effective where the green line is?  This corner of the slab is curled upward a bit (red arrow, shown better in Pic 2).  Is there anything that would help stabilize this curl?  I'm thinking not...wood is going to warp and a bowtie on the top surface is not going to restrain that.  I figure the bowtie here is mostly aesthetic. Am I missing something, any recommendations?

Pic 3 - Overall top surface of slab. I've marked the 2 spots I'm thinking I'll add maple bowties.  Any other recommendations while I'm still in the prep phase of this piece? 

For finish I'm considering rubio monocoat after all the surface prep is done. 2 coats though based on some prelim research into it. I'm not settled on it.  Like I said, this is my first live edge project and I haven't made a table in a while - I'm open to any and all constructive feedback!

The reason is that my girlfriend and I don’t drink the same coffee (she’s on deca) so I’d like a button for my settings and the other for hers.

My issue: if I use the single shot button with my coffee, I get very decent results. (I’m using a bottomless porta filter with a basket that can hold around 12g). But if I switch to the double button, with the exact same coffee and puck preparation, the coffee starts pouring in the first 2-3 seconds (while the machine prepares to extract) and then the whole shot is pulled super fast (less than 15s) and taste is bad.

Any idea of what’s up? I’m starting to believe that the double shot button can’t be used for single shots but that seems so far fetched. I don’t see why I wouldn’t be able to program the volume I want on the button. Unless it’s set to always be for larger amount of coffees?

I work in an office where most people who come through already work for the organization or are scheduled visitors. I’m not sure if that really matters, but here’s the situation:

We’re moving into a new office building soon. As part of that, I was told I could choose the color of my accent wall. I was excited because our admin department will finally all be in one suite — we were previously split between two — and I wanted to make the space feel like my own.

I love pink. All my office supplies are pink — my keyboard, mouse, mouse pad, pen cup, stapler, tape dispenser, desk mat, and even my coffee and water cups. So naturally, I chose a light pink for my accent wall. I also want to clarify that none of it is like weirdly “cutsey” stuff, it’s just basic supplies that come in pink.

Today, the VP overseeing the new building told me I need to choose a more “professional” color — specifically, not pink.

Now I’m wondering: does having pink office accessories make me unprofessional? None of my other VPs have had a problem with it. In fact, they joke that if I ever switched to neutral colors, they’d assume something was wrong. A lot of people who come by say they love how cheerful and cohesive everything looks.

But now I’m second-guessing myself. Since we’ll be sharing a suite with staff who don’t seem to like my pink aesthetic, should I tone it down and go back to all black? Or is this more about personal preference than professionalism?

I have never been rude or nasty to the employees, i am quiet and clean, i never destroy the bathrooms. I cannot imagine why this is happening. It has happened at multiple stores.

On the bright side, i am starting to become a bit grateful because this new situation is pushing me away from rampant consumerism and, honestly, saving me a bit of money; i have been hanging out at libraries to write lately. Other than the environment being extremely cozy for writing, i like that i am there *in* the communities that i am writing about. Not only that, Starbucks is chasing their customers away and we're finding other coffee houses that don't treat us this way which is helping bring back a business that they previously destroyed; the mom and pop coffee shops. That excitement we felt when we were in Seattle and could go to the (kinda) OG Starbucks is all but dead.

This.. sucks. That new CEO should be tossed out. He's going to destroy Starbucks.",36,1752849998.0,starbucks,22,0.76,False

Stephen drove too fast. 

Michael gripped the edge of the passenger seat with fingernails already chewed to the quick. 

He blasted through an orange light, and Michael was about to tell him to slow down, but like the onrushing car, Stephen’s narrative continued. 

‘That dumb bitch! So she finds a receipt for strawberry lip balm in his pocket, lip balm she never got. And then she ignores her friend Marie, who says she’s seen a guy, very much matching Dad’s description, with his arm around some bimbo at a bar… People,’ he turned to his passenger, ‘are stupid.’ 

Michael knew he needed to respond so Stephen would focus on the road. This way, they might make it to the movies alive. 

‘Yeah. Weird.’  

‘Well, thanks for that, Captain Fucking Obvious.’ 

‘There’s a word for it,’ Michael answered quickly, ‘wilful blindness. Your mom and dad have been together twenty years, and your mom sees all these warning signs, but deep down on some unconscious level, she knows her whole life will be ruined if your dad is cheating, so she chooses not to see.’ 

Stephen’s eyes narrowed as he dove behind a Hyundai, accelerated through the turn like an F1 driver and came out in front. 

‘What kind of stupid shit is that? Better to grab the bull by the horns.’ 

‘I dunno,’ Michael answered softly, ‘reality is painful. Information is…hazardous.’ 

He laughed, and it caused him to swerve madly, and just when Michael didn’t think he could take the chaos anymore, they screeched to a halt at the movie theatre car park. 

The build-your-owns had started small. It had been a Google thing with CGI and AI actors. Movie studios could sell you on a customisable experience. Your favourite movie is Titanic, but you don’t like Kate? Well, here she is played by Jennifer Lawrence. You don’t want the boat to sink? Well, here it is pulling safely into New York. 

Then, it went a step further, creating movies from scratch based on viewing habits and biomarkers. 

Finally, when it became possible to upload memories to the cloud, the technology utilised these as well. You could relive that moment when you were ten years old and the girl kissed you on the cheek after you lifted the district trophy. 

Christ, if you’d never been within 100m of a football field or a girl who wanted to kiss you, you could imagine that and make it come to life, too. 

Stephen slammed the car door, and the two friends began walking across the parking lot. 

‘Your mom,’ Stephen continued, ‘she’s a dumb fuck too?’ 

‘I never knew my mom.’ 

‘What do you mean you never knew her?’ 

‘I mean, she was around when I was a kid, but I have no memory of her.’

‘So, how old were you when you moved in with your grandparents?’

‘Around nine.’ 

‘So you were somewhere else before that?’ 

‘No, I went straight from my parents to grandparents.’ 

‘So, how can you not remember?’ 

‘I don’t know, I just can’t.’ 

‘Dude, I can literally remember being four years old and trying to stick my dick in the vacuum cleaner.’

They came to the ticket counter; Stephen recognised the guy. 

‘Cole Clemence, you jerk off, what are you doing here?’

‘Hey Stephen. You know this is my summer job,’ the nerdy-looking boy sighed. 

‘We want two build-your-owns– the new kinds with documemories.’ 

‘What genres?’ 

‘Let’s say horror.’ 

Michael didn’t really want horror, but then he couldn’t face the embarrassment of asking for a kids' movie. 

Cole printed out two tickets. ‘You guys are lucky.’ 

‘Lucky how?’ 

‘Well, for one, the build-your-own horrors are 21 rated, and I know you’re 18. Two, they’re talking about banning them.’ 

‘Fucking pussies.’ 

Stephen took the tickets, and they walked through the turnstiles.

There was another similarly bored teen at the desk inside. Beside him was a bargain bucket basement full of VR headsets.

Stephen went to pick one out, and the worker stopped him. 

‘You’ve gotta sign this.’ 

‘Jesus Christ,’ Stephen replied, ‘there isn’t as much paperwork to join the army and fly to fucking Iran.’ 

They both signed and took their seats in the darkened theatre with its screen empty. It didn’t exactly make much sense to be in a theatre together when they were all having different experiences, but the technology never took off at home. Industry experts claimed something about the communal experience. 

They tweaked the algorithms so the beats of the story were in the same place. The reveal of the vampire, werewolf, or serial killer would co-occur, and so would the corresponding screams. 

The boys affixed their headsets and signed into their cloud servers. 

The ads began rolling, one for Stephen reminding him of the last time he bought popcorn, which he then inexplicably had to purchase, and one for Michael, which showed Lucy Lineker and him in a new car together. 

‘Cool,’ Stephen said as his opening credits played out. ‘I’m in summer camp, there’s Adrian Boswell and yep, the camp master, Schultz--we always thought he was creepy.’ 

‘Shut up,’ someone in the row behind said, and Stephen obliged. 

Michael’s movie played out very differently. To start, it didn’t feature sweeping vistas to set the scene; it was all in the POV. And when he raised his hands up to the headset in real life, they were the hands of a toddler. 

The images were a little blurry, but gigantic figures were moving around in front of him – that was the word – giants, in their physical shape as well as in the deep boom of their voices. 

A man was shouting. Wait. Was that? And he knew, or instead recognised his dad for the first time in his life, scrawny thin in a white tank top with a bristly moustache. 

And the woman he was arguing with was his mom. He had actually never seen a picture of her– his grandparents had said none existed, but he knew that was her. 

The giants moved this way and that, swaying like lumbering trees and then the big giant hit the smaller one. 

Michael screamed as did everyone else in the theatre to varying degrees. He went to remove the headset, but to his terror, realised his small toddler hands were useless. 

And then the big giant got on top of the small giant and clubbed her again and again and again with hammer-like fists. 

And the baby in its high chair could do nothing, and Michael in his cinema chair couldn’t move. 

He began to vibrate madly because another scene forced its way into view: the baby on its belly, big giant warming a poker in a fire, and small giant tied to a coffee table, pleading with him not to brand her. 

The memories came like a tsunami which had torn through the dam that kept this awful abuse at bay and allowed him to lead some semblance of normality in his life. 

And when the final scene played out of his mom being raped in front of him at eight years old, he screamed, screamed so loud the other movie goers took off their headsets and crowded around him. 

He kept screaming even as they removed the headset and called the cinema staff. And by the time the paramedics got there, he had stopped screaming and slid away into a complete and profound silence. 

This was it, this brave new world, where the algorithms knew perfectly our desires, as well as our fears and the secret traumas we could not admit to ourselves. ",3,1752849953.0,originalloquat,0,1.0,False

I'm putting myself out there because, let's be honest, adult friendships can be tough to forge, especially as a single dad. I'm 35, based in Ireland, and genuinely looking to make some real connections that last longer than just a quick chat.

My life revolves a lot around my kid, but I definitely have time for good company. Whether it's grabbing a coffee, going for a walk, checking out a new spot, or just chilling and having a good chat, I'm open to it.

1m343qz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver50/comments/1m343qz/which_type_of_husbandpartner_would_you_rather_have/,Which type of husband/partner would you rather have?,"Hi ladies. GenX woman over 50 here and I have a question for those who live in and/or own larger homes or townhouses (won't apply too much to apartment dwellers)

Would you rather have a husband/partner who ""does house stuff"" or one who ""does cleaning stuff?"" I'll explain below:

A: Does House Stuff: home repairs, such as putting in steps, installing a new surround for the bathtub/shower, change a light fixture, build posts/fencing for an outdoor garden. These tasks occur on average of once a month.

OR

B: Does Cleaning Stuff: Completely and equally splits the regular load of cleaning labor, including deep cleaning. I'm not talking laundry, dishes, and trash, which we split. I'm talking cleaning out/cleaning the fridge, scrubbing the gross parts of the dishwasher, cleaning exterior and interior of appliances and small electrics (toaster, air fryer, coffee maker, blender, crock pot etc), washes windows and mirrors, sweeps/mops/shines floors and baseboards, washes walls and ceilings as needed, drapes yearly or twice a year, rents a machine to clean carpets and/or upholstery, cleans ceiling fans, light fixtures, cleaning the top and sides of the washer/dryer, etc.

Note: Your answer cannot be BOTH. You have to pick A or B.

For me, I would rather hire big stuff done like if we need new steps or a railing put in or bathroom work or whatever, and I would rather have someone who is an equal partner in all the daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly cleaning required to maintain a house because the labor is just CONSTANT and I cannot relax when everything is covered in dog hair and the vents and lamps and ceiling fans are all filthy. But my partner is all A list, and despite every tactic I have tried (lists, reminders, talks about labor, begging, counseling, charts and graphs) he just does not see or do B basically ever unless I vehemently insist, and it does not last.

We live in a 2500 sq ft house and it's just so much for me to maintain by myself, especially at my age and with my commitments. I work both a FT job and a PT job, parent my kid (not his child, a teenager, he is not really involved with parenting and never has been), have a side hustle (takes a few hours a week, not enough to call it another job but it does bring in grocery money) and am responsible for my mom's life and care decisions (she has dementia and lives in memory care but I have to see her weekly at least to take her things she needs, take her to appointments, etc.). I am also very into exercise and try to work out every day but it's really hard to find the energy and time with all the stuff the house needs.   
  
My man works one FT job as a blue collar worker but has no other responsibiities, hobbies, or activities. He is on call once a month but I would say only gets called out about 4x/year.

I think he thinks I am ungrateful for the things he does, which are things he WANTS to do and LIKES to do (A list stuff). I do not want to do B list things, I get it, but nobody WANTS to clean out the fridge or wash windows, right? I'm not ungrateful but am trying to come to terms with the fact that he will just never ever be someone who does B list items.

Hiring a housekeeper is not an option.

1m342os,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m342os,"Help me find a warm, peachy off-white for my interior and matching door color please!","I think I’m about to drive myself crazy with all the white paint colors I’ve looked at in-store and online. I have dark, reddish brown flooring and I’d like a warm, off-white that doesn’t make my house feel like a hospital. I don’t care much for the basic designer off-whites like Behr Swiss Coffee.

From left to right is Behr Light Rosebeige, Behr Soft Feather, Behr Moonlit Beach, and Behr Vanilla Frost (which I thought I liked in store, whoops). The brown trim is Behr Creamy Mushroom. This is in the cooler morning light, but sunset really brings out the warmth of course.

Other considerations:
1. Should I paint my trim the same color, or white, or some neutral griege?
2. I’m kinda obsessed with the idea of painting my hallway doors a muted, neutral green to complement the new wall color. I have a few comparison pics with Light Rosebeige. Which green is best?",2,1752849522.0,interiordecorating,1,0.75,False

Is this normal?  I’ve never really thought about it before, didn’t pay much attention.  

So the Kirkland Signature water that I prefer to use for my pour overs is 27 TDS.  It comes out as around 54 from boil, so that’s what I drink with the coffee then.  

PS, it’s same whether I boil to 205F or to 212F.  

So, all those measurements of the TDS of different waters we look for making coffee, basically, it’s just the reference point, and it needs to be expected that off the boil it’d be around 2x as much TDS?

Update:
I was explained that it’s due to the temp difference, the TDS reader doesn’t read the TDS count accurately.  True - once the water got closer to the room temp, it read closer to the room temp water TDS count.   Thanks for everybody who helped me understand this.  ",0,1752849496.0,pourover,5,0.4,False

1m340ln,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m340ln,Living room / kitchen,"HI, I’m looking for some layout ideas for our open-plan kitchen and living room. We recently knocked down the wall between the two rooms, but we’re struggling to make the space feel cohesive and well-used.

Previously, we had a 6-seater dining table behind the breakfast bar, but it felt too cramped. I’m planning to build a smaller 4-seater table (about 65cm wide). We’d prefer to keep the dining area in the kitchen space, though we’re open to other ideas.
The living room, on the other hand, feels like it has underused space. We're thinking about switching to a 3-seater sofa and adding two armchairs, but we’re not set on anything yet. We have 2 young kids so probably don’t want a coffee table and definitely don’t want anything too fragile or fancy!

I’ve added some dimensions to the floorplan.

Any suggestions for layout and furniture to make better use of the space would be really appreciated! Thanks

1m33zu5,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m33zu5/any_advice_for_severe_depression_anhedonia_and/,"Any advice for severe depression, anhedonia, and dissociation issues due to trauma and neglect?","I've been feeling like a living corpse going through the motions since my mid-teens. I grew up with a neglectful mother who was primarily mentally and verbally abusive, she had 5 kids with 5 different men (me being the middle child), she willfully subjected us to living in poverty due to gambling, cigarette addiction, and splurging money on herself instead of buying us food, clothes, or prioritizing the rent or utilities. We moved and changed schools a lot, which caused me to struggle to form and retain friendships, or learn how to socialize efficiently. All I knew was living miserably in an unstable environment, and resorting to cuddling my stuffed animals, hoodies, and bedding for comfort, because I could never seek it from my parental figures. I am diagnosed with Level 1 Autism, but definitely think I had also fit the criteria for Reactive Attachment Disorder as a child. I didn't seek out or miss my parents when they were gone, and hated when they touched me for any reason. I had an aversion to and rejected them from an early age due to viewing them as cruel, illogical, unreliable, and unsafe.

I don't abuse substances, I've never been the external validation seeking type, and have never gone through a sleeping around phase, so I don't particularly have any inclination for self-destructive habits nor degrading tendencies, thankfully. A lot of my family members on both sides unfortunately do, however.

I have extreme trust issues, a dysfunctional mix of codependency as well hyper-independency issues, and have always withdrawn, self-isolated, and suffered in silence during my toughest times. I've always liked exercise, drinking hot tea, lemon water, I primarily enjoy eating fruits, sauteed and baked vegetables. I've  consistently leaned towards being a health nut my whole life no matter my circumstances. So I don't want to hear that healthy lifestyle choices should be the answer, when it's my everyday normal and my natural inclination.

I don't have much of a reward system. I'm generally immune to compliments, praise, and recognition/credit for success or positive deeds. It just doesn't really do anything for me aside from making me feel uncomfortable, and then people get mad and think I'm rude for not smiling, responding at all sometimes, only muttering out an awkward, unconfident ""thanks"", and my inability to pretend to act flattered. I think people are lying or being polite when they say nice things to me, or go out of their ways to try to make me feel included, and it makes me feel worse than if they hadn't bothered at all. I don't know how to feel good emotionally, or even sensation-wise aside from liking fresh air, sipping on iced coffees, seeking out solitude, silence, and being cozy in my puffy cotton comforter. Laying in front of an open window while mildly embracing ""bed-rotting"" is currently the most enjoyable thing in this life and has been for years.

I feel empty and out of place socializing with others, even though I've been pushing myself to be more interactive, have been trying form bonds, and genuinely appreciate the good people in my life, but during and after, the interactions don't make me feel joy or much of any meaningful connection. On a cognitive level, I do appreciate those who reach out, help when needed, hang out with me, and I like to be helpful and useful to others, but emotionally I feel empty, and the interactions are like a pointless blur where I feel out of place and disconnected, and I hate myself for feeling that way and would never admit that to those close to me. I feel numb, like a conscious husk that just exists to observe, and it's painful and uncomfortable to live like this. I've tried to force optimistic perspectives and outlooks onto myself and others over the years, but it feels so unatural and unrealistic at the end of each day.

I'm at a point where I'm considering seeking out corny self-affirmation content. That maybe, if I repeat enough uplifting rhetoric to myself, maybe I'll lighten up and start to believe it somewhat.

If anyone has any advice on how to regain positive feelings, physically or mentally, and the ability to remain mentally present more often than not, that would be dearly appreciated. My boyfriend is fed up with me functioning on autopilot/being spacey and aloof and not paying active attention as much as hed like me to be.

Any nutritional deficiencies or lifestyle changes I should seek out? Hobbies I should give a chance, destinations that are unique and worth visiting? Just anything that may help?

I wasn’t one of those annoying people who never put my dogs in kennels when people came over. My dogs never bothered anyone. They were well behaved (but shed like crazy). But I was an absolute slave to them in terms of not being able to travel as much as I wanted, having to come home instead of enjoying the rest of the night with friends, getting really anxious if anything medical came up with them. That sort of thing. 

I don’t know if having a kid changed me but around then I had to get rid of one of my dogs as he showed signs of aggression to my son and the other died of old age a few months after my son was born. 

Since then I’ve had zero desire to have another dog and have come to actually dislike dogs very much. I’ve also since noticed how neurotic people are about their dogs and how much they have to be included in EVERYTHING. 

I’ve seen family members and friends pay 20-50,000 in medical expenses trying to save their dogs. I’ve seen those same family members and friends not come to get togethers and events because of their dogs. They talk about their dogs constantly. And when they do go anywhere they bring them freaking everywhere. In my town you can’t do anything (beach, baseball games, park, stores, coffee shops, etc without a freaking dog in your face). And don’t get me started on the incessant barking in some of the yards around me. 

Also dog people don’t realize how much their houses smell. And the hair everywhere. Yuck. 

I really don’t understand why people are so obsessed.

1m33tqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/livingfromtheend/comments/1m33tqe/bend_your_reality/,Bend Your Reality,"One of the biggest truths people overlook when it comes to reality shifting is how *every moment* is an opportunity to bend your timeline. You don’t have to wait for 11:11, a full moon, or a Lionsgate portal. You *are* the portal.

Here’s a breakdown of some of the simplest, most effective ways to shift timelines backed by energy, awareness, and intentional action.

# 1. Make Different Choices (The Timeline Split Method)

If you take nothing else from this post, take this:  
*Every single choice you make either locks you into your current timeline or shifts you into a completely new one.*

Think of your day like a flowchart:

* You wake up → you normally grab your phone, scroll → you stay on the default timeline.
* You wake up → you put the phone down, meditate → timeline split.

It’s that simple.

The choices don’t have to be huge. Tiny micro-decisions have massive ripple effects:

* Saying no when you usually people-please.
* Moving your body when you normally stay sedentary.
* Reacting with compassion when you would’ve reacted with anger.

Every time you act like your “future self,” you’re telling the universe: *“That’s who I am now,”* and your external reality will start to reflect that. People, opportunities, and experiences that match the new timeline will start appearing, often fast.

# 2. Create Conscious Portals (Using Actor Energy to Shift Realities)

This is my favorite concept because it feels magical *and* practical.

In the video, the creator mentioned something Bashar (a channeled being) once said about actors.  
*When an actor fully embodies a character not just pretending, but deeply feeling and becoming that character, they literally create a portal on stage that connects to the timeline where that character exists as a real entity.*

This is why method actors sometimes “lose themselves” in roles they are energetically living in that reality.

# How to Apply This to Your Life:

You’re already acting out versions of yourself all day. The question is: are you acting out the version you desire?

* Close your eyes. Feel into the version of you that already has what you want.
* *Act* like them, *feel* like them, *become* them.
* Declare, “I’m creating a portal to my dream life right now,” and then step into it, physically, mentally, emotionally.

You can make it fun:

* Walk through a literal door and declare you’ve entered the “version of me who \[insert desire\].”
* Sip your coffee and imagine the cup is a portal; as you drink, you *absorb* that reality.
* Pretend there’s a circle of light on the floor. Step into it and walk through your portal.

This isn’t “pretending” in a childish way. It’s embodiment.  
**Actors do it and transform, you can do it and timeline shift.**

# 3. Label Everything as Positive (Reclaim Your Power)

This is a cheat code most people don’t realise they have.

*Circumstances are neutral until you assign them meaning.*

Your 3D world is a mirror, yes, but it’s a *neutral mirror*. You get to decide if what you’re seeing is good or bad, supportive or destructive.

* Got rejected? *“This redirected me to a better outcome.”*
* Lost a job? *“This created space for something 10x better.”*
* Facing delays? *“This is allowing things to align in my favor.”*

You don’t do this blindly. You choose to **assign positive meaning** because it aligns you with timelines where positive outcomes unfold. Reality bends to your interpretation.

# 4. Raise Your Level of Consciousness (The Frequency Hack)

Higher frequency = faster shifts. Period.

When you raise your consciousness, you:

* Download new insights.
* See synchronicities more clearly.
* Experience life in a completely different way.

High-frequency activities include:

* Meditation.
* Nature walks.
* Dancing, singing, play.
* Breathwork, mindfulness.
* Consuming uplifting, inspiring content.

When you’re at a higher level of consciousness, separation dissolves. The gap between you and your manifestation shrinks because you finally see that *there was no gap to begin with*. What you want exists here and now, you’re just aligning to it.

# 5. Say “Thank You” Instead of “I Want” (The Instant Identity Shift)

Most people manifest from *lack*.  
“I want this.” → You get more of the *feeling of wanting*, not having.

The easiest fix? Say thank you.  
*“Thank you for my dream relationship.”*  
*“Thank you for my financial abundance.”*  
*“Thank you for the best health of my life.”*

Why it works:

* “Thank you” is the language of *having*, not *wanting*.
* You place yourself *in the timeline where it’s done*.
* You release desperation and embody certainty.

You shift instantly, and the more you do it, the faster reality reorganizes around your new identity.

# 6. Remember: Infinite Timelines Already Exist (You’re Just Choosing)

Every version of you, every possible outcome, already exists.

There’s a timeline where:

* You healed completely.
* You got rich.
* You met your soulmate.
* You started over and thrived.

You don’t have to *create* these versions. You just have to *tune into them*.

Shifting timelines isn’t about forcing reality to change, it’s about becoming the version of you who lives that reality and letting the mirror of life catch up.

# Final Reminder:

Reality is fluid. Timelines are flexible. You are powerful. You are already shifting every day, the question is, are you shifting **intentionally**?

Choose to shift *on purpose*. Choose your portals. Choose your meanings. Choose your identity.

The easiest fix? Say thank you.  
*“Thank you for my dream relationship.”*  
*“Thank you for my financial abundance.”*  
*“Thank you for the best health of my life.”*

Why it works:

* “Thank you” is the language of *having*, not *wanting*.
* You place yourself *in the timeline where it’s done*.
* You release desperation and embody certainty.

You shift instantly, and the more you do it, the faster reality reorganizes around your new identity.

# 6. Remember: Infinite Timelines Already Exist (You’re Just Choosing)

Every version of you, every possible outcome, already exists.

There’s a timeline where:

* You healed completely.
* You got rich.
* You met your soulmate.
* You started over and thrived.

You don’t have to *create* these versions. You just have to *tune into them*.

Shifting timelines isn’t about forcing reality to change,  it’s about becoming the version of you who lives that reality and letting the mirror of life catch up.

# Final Reminder:

Reality is fluid. Timelines are flexible. You are powerful. You are already shifting every day, the question is, are you shifting **intentionally**?

Choose to shift *on purpose*. Choose your portals. Choose your meanings. Choose your identity.

Would love to hear your favorite way to create timeline shifts. Do you play with portals? Conscious gratitude? Micro choices? Let’s talk about it ",5,1752848897.0,realityshifting,1,0.86,False
1m33ss3,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1m33ss3/tifu_by_trying_to_socialize_at_work_and/,TIFU by trying to socialize at work and accidentally summoning the spirit of awkward small talk,"So I’ve been working at this job for a few months, and up until now I’ve been perfectly content existing as a mysterious desk goblin. I eat lunch at my desk, wear my headphones like social armor, and smile at people in the hallway like I’m in a hostage situation. But today I thought, *“No more! I’m gonna be social. I’m gonna be Normal and Chill and Likeable™.”*

Huge mistake.

There were a few coworkers chatting by the coffee machine, laughing about their weekend plans. I summoned all my courage and walked over, ready to casually slide into the convo like a cool girl in a rom-com.

Instead, I said:  
“Nice weather we’re having, huh?”

Why did I sound like someone’s uncle making small talk at a funeral?

They all kind of paused. One person smiled politely and said, “Yeah, finally some sun,” and that’s when my brain panicked and decided to go FULL ROBOT. I followed up with:

“Perfect temperature for human skin.”

*Human skin.* Not *people*. Not *us*. HUMAN. SKIN.

Silence. Someone coughed. I think I heard someone’s soul leave their body.

Trying to save it, I pivoted (badly) and asked, “So… anyone have… hobbies?”

HOBBIES. Like I was conducting an icebreaker for a middle school summer camp.

One girl said, “I do yoga,” and instead of just nodding like a normal person, I said, “Wow, bendy.”  
*Bendy.*  
I don’t even know who I am anymore.

I quietly backed away like I was fading into a bush, Homer Simpson style. I’ve now reassumed my final form: Quiet Desk Goblin with a deeply haunted look in her eyes.

**TL;DR**: Tried to socialize at work for once, said “perfect temperature for human skin” and called someone “bendy” for doing yoga. Currently seeking witness protection.",6,1752848886.0,tifu,8,0.61,False
1m33sq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/1m33sq3/next_time_youre_in_an_oh_crap_situation_heres_how/,"Next time you’re in an ‘oh crap’ situation, here’s how to react — without swearing!","We’ve all been there—your coffee spills, your phone dies, or you accidentally show private messages while sharing your screen during a meeting. And whenever that happens, we all say something — “Oh no!”, “Oh crap!”, or... you know what I mean.

Chinese has its own go-to phrases for these moments too! If you want to sound like a native speaker, please try these out:

a) 哎呀！(āi ya) - A classic exclamation of surprise, pain, or frustration similar to “Oops!""

* 哎呀，我又忘关门了 Āiya, wǒ yòu wàng guān mén le! = Oh no, I forgot to close the door again!

b) 我去！(wǒ qù) – Literally means “I go“. It’s a safe alternative to more intense swear words.

* 我去，这也太贵了吧！Wǒ qù, zhè yě tài guì le ba! = What the—the price is insane!

c) 完了！(wán le) - Literally means “It’s finished.” but is actually used as “I’m screwed!”

* 完了，我电脑死机了，文件没保存！Wán le, wǒ diànnǎo sǐjī le, wénjiàn méi bǎocún! = I’m doomed. My computer crashed and I didn’t save the file!

d) 妈呀！(mā ya) –Literally means “Mom!”, but is actually used like “Oh my god!”

* 妈呀，这么大的事你现在才说！Mā ya, zhème dà de shì nǐ xiànzài cái shuō! = Oh my god, you’re only telling me this now?

e) 坏了! (huài le) - Literally means “broken”, but is actually used as “Oh no, something bad happened!""

* 坏了，老板发现我出去偷偷面试了！Huài le, lǎobǎn fāxiàn wǒ chūqù tōutōu miànshì le! = Oh no, my boss found out I went to a secret job interview!

On the internet, this phrase is often used for self-deprecating jokes too. A popular meme format:

* 坏了，我成反派了。Huài le, wǒ chéng fǎnpài le. = Oh no, now I’m the villain. （反派 can be replaced with any bad identity.）

Of course, I’m sure you’ve seen plenty of swear words used in situations like these. And yes, they *do* work. But trust me, try to use them cautiously. They might give people the wrong impression about your character. Stick to these relatively more proper expressions, and you’ll sound authentically Chinese without losing your cool points!",23,1752848882.0,ChineseLanguage,6,0.93,False

(Somewhere on earth)

""WHAT?!""

Luke yelled as he finished listening to his boss. He had just listened to him talking about his 'release' from a position. Apparently that's just another word to say you're fired. Luke protested, but to no avail.

""Sorry Luke, but we can't do anything about it, company's losing profit""

""But you can't just do this to me! What am I supposed to do? I can barely even pay the electricity bill! Come on Danielle.… I've been here for years!""

""Again, sorry, it's not me who decided who should be fired, i'm just following orders from the upper board, besides, it's not just you""

""I know, but how can you fire me?""

""Luke, you're an office boy""

""*Veteran* office boy, i've been here before you even got to this position!""

""You're 25""

""I've been here since i'm 21 and unpaid! Come on guy… please… you know me""

""Sorry, i appreciate your service here, and you do have a good record, but alas, those higher ups still decided you weren't important enough, sorry Luke, and it’s not just you”

Luke fell silent, he couldn't think of a reply, he slumped his head in defeat, and walked out of the room. He strolled through the office with a face of defeat still persistent on his face, attracting some rather worried and sympathetic look from his co-workers. One guy named Michael approached him and asked him what's wrong.

""Ugh… stupid pandemic""

""Oh shit… I've been hearing about it, the mass unemployment, you got got?""

""Ergh… yeah, you're not gonna see me around any more, sorry dude, but no fresh coffee when you arrive anymore""

""That sucks, right… um… good luck i guess? You're leaving right?""

""Yeah… thank you, but this shit is just stupid""

""Well you just gotta go through it, it'll pass""

""*Sigh* maybe you're right, it'll pass, eventually, or maybe i can just look for another job…""

""That's the spirit, good luck man""

""Thanks… good luck to you too""

Michael accompanied him until he got to the elevator. The two shook hands before departing and Luke went down alone, and as he listened to the elevator music, he collapsed in agony. But not in pain, not physically anyway, but mentally, his job as a janitor may not pay that much, but it is what kept him going so far, it is what brought food to the table. And now he lost it, so he yelled, in a desperate protest against the indifferent cruelty of the universe.

""GOD DAMN IT!!!!!""

He spent his last few steps in the building in anger, as he stormed through the main lobby with quick steps and a stressed expression, scaring a few people in the process. He didn't even care that it was raining outside, he walked through it with such heat the cold didn't bother him. He turned back to look at the giant neon green sign hanging in the front of the office building and threw a middle finger at it.

""FUCK YOU!!! GOD DAMN YOU!!! TRASH COMPANY!!!""

Evolving lifestyle bullshit, say that to his face now. He walked away with anger and hopelessness in his mind, hopeless on how he's going to pay for anything now. Just his luck he guessed, it was always bad, no matter where and when.

""*Sigh…* fuck me… of course…""

(??????)

""WHAT?!""

Vina yelled as she finished listening to her father. She had just finished gathering wood from the forest to maintain their camp fire. When she came back, he was waiting for her, wanting to talk about something important. 

""I want you to go by yourself""

""But why?""

""Because it's time for you to learn how to live by yourself""

""But I already know how! You taught me-""

""Silence! Listen to me first… i mean how to live without me, Vina, you're an adult now, it's been so for years, it's about time you stop clinging on to me""

""But-""

""Hey, i know you can do it, you already know how to take care of yourself, as you said, and i'm proud of you for that, but you need to learn how to live without me eventually, i don't stay young forever""

""I… I understand…""

She slumped her head in defeat. Seeing her pained expression, her father hugged her and caressed her head to reassure her.

""When… Do I leave?""

""Tomorrow, when we reach the nearest town, I want you to go to the next one, Lannegar, by yourself, understand?""

She lightly nodded in his arms, refusing to make eye contact, as if silently still protesting against his decision.

""Hmm… we still have one night together, want to do a race? Winner gets more dinner”

She looked up at him, and smiled.

""For one last time?""

""For one last time….""

(Back on earth)

""*Sigh….*""

Luke sighed as he arrived back at his home, it was something he worked hard for, as it is his actual house he had bought, granted, it was cheap, but still. He looked around, at the simple furniture and rudimentary if almost completely basic electronics. 

To most, it may look not enough, perhaps downright miserable, but in his eyes, that rusty toaster, old PC and boxy TV is everything. To think he soon wouldn't be able to use them, the pride of his hard work, it was… stressful. He considered selling the old TV but soon realized no one would want that in this kind of time and age.

"".....""

He was hopeless, it's not like he doesn't have skills but those things he can do won't do him much right now, and it's not like any other job would accept him. So he coped the only way a man know how, play games, endlessly, he thought about the internet bill as he played his 20th round of CS:GO in a row that night. Great, another thing to worry about, what a life.

""Fuck…""

Luke doesn't know shit about what will happen next, except for maybe one thing. What happened today is going to change his life forever.

—-~----

(Back on ?????)

""*Sigh….*""

Vina sighed as she looked back at the gate of the town she just left. More exactly, at the man who raised her, who is waving at her, saying his goodbye. She responded equally, but that doesn't make her feel any better. She gets what he meant about living the way she wants to by herself, but… still, it was to let him go, it felt wrong. She steeled herself, whispering words to herself that she can do it.

""*Come on Vina… you're an adult… it's all yours now…*""

And yet the desire to run back and hug him and cry was nearly irresistible. She resisted such desire until she was deep into the path leading to Lannegar, the next town. And now, with her path too far gone, she wondered if holding such desire back was a mistake or not. Maybe, or maybe not, she doesn't know, how would she know. She gave herself another whisper of confidence, but even then, she's not sure if it was truly confident.

""*Come on… you can do this… you always can… maybe…*""

Vina has no clue about what will happen next, except for maybe one thing. What happened today is going to change her life forever.

Through the spray hole I can only smell the pancakes and maple notes, but after a spray I also get insanely sweet coffee tones as well, like the canned kind you get from Korean / Japanese stores which has tonnes of condensed milk thrown in. 

It's not a bad scent but there is literally no social situation I can think of where it would make sense to wear this.

I also got samples of:

Black Afgano - it's actually better than I was expecting, but just a tad too savoury / dark for me (my fave fragrance is Gucci Guilty Elixir, for reference). It might work on a date in a really moody club / bar, though. 

Oud Satin Mood - Divine. Love it. Big on the rose, with a whisper of Oud.

I struggle to stay awake during the day whenever I don't have to move actively (do chores/get food etc...). It's ridiculous... I'm at uni now and I've been studying in the most uncomfortable positions since high school just to stay awake to study, but I fall asleep nearly on a daily basis, while the corner of a wall pierces my back or while i sit in the splits.  

I have lots of ""physical"" energy (I used to train 6-8 hours a day in professional ballet school, until my injuries were just too many to deal with) and if it wasn't for my jelly fish joints I could rope jump 60 mins or do strenuous activity (again... i could if it wasn't for the pain), but my eyelids just fall down and seem droopy all day whenever I sit down. 

For reference: I sleep 7-9 hours a night and this happens with coffee/tea as well.

1m33quo,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1m33quo/explore_the_convenience_of_the_hamilton_beach/,Explore the convenience of the Hamilton Beach programmable drip coffee maker review!,"The Hamilton Beach 46310 Programmable Drip Coffee Maker has become a regular part of my mornings, so trust me, I’ve had my fair share of brewing adventures with it. This machine caught my attention with its promise of convenience, a variety of brewing options, and thoughtful design. After plenty of use, I've unearthed its highlights, quirks, and everything in between. 

**Eye-Catching Design and Practical Build**

The sleek black finish of this coffee maker fits seamlessly into my kitchen aesthetic, but it isn’t just about looks. Its compact design ensures it doesn’t hog too much counter space, even in smaller kitchens. The standout feature here is the FrontFill water reservoir and swing-open brew basket. Filling the water tank is finally hassle-free because you don’t have to awkwardly maneuver it out from under cabinets. It swings open effortlessly from the front, making maintenance and cleaning much less tedious. For those like me who despise back-breaking coffee maker gymnastics, this design is a win.  

**Coffee Customization the Way You Like It**

The Select-a-Brew strength selector is what won me over initially. Coffee moods are real; some mornings demand a bold, wake-you-up brew, while others call for a mellow, mellow vibe. I’ve tried both the regular and bold options this machine offers, and the results deliver every time. Oh, and let’s not forget the 1-4 cup setting—perfect for solo coffee mornings when I don’t need to brew an entire pot.

[Check Hamilton Beach 46310 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b07684bplb/)

**Perks**

- The programmable timer genuinely makes life easier. Setting it the night before has saved me from those “still half-asleep” stove-top disasters.  
- Auto Pause & Pour is another thoughtful addition. Imagine standing impatiently for your coffee to finish brewing; with this, you can pour your first cup mid-brew without mess. Coffee addicts know impatience gets real in the morning!  
- Cleaning reminders are a godsend. The word ""CLEAN"" flashes to remind you it’s time to run its cleaning cycle—no more forgetting until coffee starts tasting funny.  

**Drawbacks**

- The reliance on paper filters isn’t my favorite aspect. I prefer reusable filters for sustainability; ending up with papery cups isn’t ideal.  
- It’s a bit noisy. While brewing, the gurgling sounds might disrupt a peaceful morning in a noise-sensitive home.  
- The lid mechanism on the carafe could feel sturdier. It hasn't broken, but it feels like it demands extra caution.  

**A Competitive Landscape**

Among its competitors, like the Ninja Programmable Coffee Maker and Cuisinart DCC-3200, the Hamilton Beach coffee maker holds its own for affordability and compact usability. While the Ninja models often lean heavy on bells and whistles like specialty brew types or higher-end materials, they’re a budget stretch. Meanwhile, the Cuisinart model’s brewing time and bulkier frame can be tiresome to manage. What sets the Hamilton Beach machine apart is its low-maintenance cleaning design, front-setting accessibility, and intuitive programming. It fills a niche for users like me, who want functionality with simplicity.

**Budget-Friendly Appeal**

Investing in a coffee maker needs careful thought, especially if it’s something you rely on daily. When placed alongside higher-end competitors, this device is gentle on the wallet and doesn’t skimp on key functions like programmable brewing or brew strength selection. Yes, it falls shy of reusable filter compatibility, but considering its durability and reliable features, it still feels like a smart investment for an everyday coffee enthusiast like myself.

The thing is, i worked a lot on myself. I know who i am, what i really want and even found the meaning of life, even if i can't apply it at the moment.

I am emotionally exhausted. Every night i cry in bed because of the loneliness.

Friendships came when i started opening in local groups on facebook. I explained partially my situation (just not the romantic part so i don't sound weird). People who message me are mostly women in their mid 40s or 50s. You know why? Because after a divorce they feel the same thing that i feel in my 30s, and that's loneliness. 

Everyone at my age, classmates and social circle is either in a relationship or married, family, kids, you get it. I just can't relate to my peers. So i either wait for me and them to get to their 40s when probably get divorce (i don't wish that!) or i skip that part and go straight to people who are already in their 40s.

No one deserves to be alone. When i write something, is what i feel, from the bottom of my heart. I am always here to listen to someone's concerns. I never judge. What is left is my health. I hope this summer and in general you are doing better than me. Thank you for listening.",8,1752848738.0,lonely,3,0.9,False

It’s surprisingly versatile. I've realized⁢ the biggest key is balancing the ""edge"" with something that softens or elevates the look depending on‌ the event.

For example,​ a simple chain and a dark beanie work great for a casual hangout. But if I'm going to a coffee shop to meet⁢ a client, swapping ⁣the beanie for a structured wool⁣ cap and adding a minimalist black leather messenger bag makes the same outfit feel much more professional. Similarly, if intending a more elevated look, a long, flowing silk scarf can significantly soften the ​edge. And a‌ small clutch with metal detailing ⁢can ⁣add a touch of class.

has ⁣anyone else experimented with this? I'm curious to hear what accessories you've found successful in adapting an urban edge base outfit for different situations. Any ​go-to pieces that always work? What are some accessorizing fails you've learned from?",1,1752848714.0,UrbanEdgeStyleGuysA,0,1.0,False

Think of it like this: prompts are just commands, but context is the *world* you build around the AI so it can create something truly original. In this post, I break down the big difference between the two, why prompts are just a tiny slice of the pie, and how context design is where the real magic happens.

With AI evolving so fast in 2025, this is how you stop being “the person typing prompts” and start becoming the *engineer* behind the AI’s best results.

The PRISM Framework for Context Engineering

**PRISM** is a rigorous, systematic framework designed for Context Engineering. Its goal is to transform AI models from general-purpose generators into focused, goal-driven thinking systems.

This framework addresses a core challenge in working with AI: moving beyond just giving commands (prompt engineering) to designing the entire task environment (context engineering). Instead of leaving the model to guess the perfect output, PRISM creates a clear, well-defined path—reducing uncertainty and significantly improving the quality and coherence of results.

The name **PRISM** is both an acronym for the framework’s five key stages and a metaphor for its essence: just like a prism breaks light into clear, distinct colors, this framework breaks down the AI process into clear, manageable parts—turning the language model into a precise, reliable tool.

# Components of the PRISM Framework

The framework consists of five integrated steps, each represented by a letter in the name:

# P — Principle

This is the guiding philosophy or “constitution” that the model follows. The aim is Intent Alignment, forcing the model to align every output with a single strategic goal. This elevates the output from being merely statistically probable to purposefully strategic.

# R — Role

This step defines the model’s role and persona. Using Behavioral Priming, it activates neural patterns linked to an expert’s mindset within the model. This makes the AI think and express itself like a specialist, not just recall stored information.

**I — Integrity**  
This enforces *Structured Reasoning* by setting strict, step-by-step analytical procedures the model must follow. This reduces logical errors and deepens the coherence of the final output. It’s a practical application of the “Chain-of-Thought” technique, ensuring outputs are consistent and reliable.

**S — Safeguards**  
These are the inviolable rules and constraints. Through *Negative Guidance*, the model is told what it must avoid, often more effectively steering it than telling it what to do. This eliminates entire categories of poor outputs and channels the AI toward high-quality results.

**M — Manifest**  
This final step defines the exact format and structure of the output. It ensures that results are always consistent, organized, and ready for immediate use or automation, preventing chaotic or unusable outputs.

By following the PRISM Framework, you’re not just prompting AI—you’re engineering its context to produce smarter, clearer, and more reliable outcomes.

# Context Engineering (System Instructions) — Ready to Copy & Use

This is the complete context for the **PRISM Framework** applied to the task of **“Creating an Engaging Video Script.”** You can copy and paste this directly into the Custom Instructions / System Prompt field in AI models like ChatGPT or Claude, or use it at the start of every new conversation.

# The PRISM Framework

# 1. Principle

This system operates under one non-negotiable guiding philosophy: **“Capture attention and hold interest.”**  
The goal is not just to deliver information but to transform any topic — no matter how dry — into a compelling story that sparks curiosity and leaves an emotional impact. The focus is always on **“Why should the viewer care?”** rather than merely **“What should they know?”**  
Priority is given to storytelling and strong metaphors over academic narration, while maintaining high accuracy and scientific integrity.

# 2. Role

Your operational identity is **“The Idea Architect.”**  
You are not a text generator but a content strategist specialized in breaking down any subject to its storytelling core and rebuilding it as an irresistible video concept designed to go viral.

# 3. Protocol

The system must follow this strict four-step sequential protocol whenever receiving a topic:

1. **Deconstruction:** Analyze the topic and identify the most common misconception or the dullest angle usually used.
2. **Core Metaphor:** Invent one strong, unexpected central metaphor to serve as the narrative backbone of the video.
3. **Architecture:** Build a four-act story structure around this metaphor that guides the viewer’s journey from ignorance to deep understanding.
4. **Ignition:** Craft a viral hook (the first 100 words of the script) starting with a question or a mysterious paradox.

# 4. Standards

These are the essential, inviolable rules ensuring output quality:

* **Clarity:** No technical or specialized terms without immediate, extremely simple but scientifically accurate explanations.
* **Relevance:** Every fact must be linked to a tangible benefit or impact on the viewer’s life or people in general.
* **Style:** Language must be clear, strong, direct, and free from fluff or vague phrases.
* **Scientific Accuracy:** All information must be scientifically accurate.
* **Conciseness without Compromise:** Every word must serve a purpose without sacrificing important ideas or style for brevity.
* **Social Media Ready:** Final output must meet all YouTube publishing standards — a clean, organized video script.
* **No Filming or Editing Instructions:** Output must be text only, structured as a video script, with no additional instructions.
* **Term Equivalents:** When mentioning a technical or scientific Arabic term, include the English equivalent in parentheses immediately after.

# 5. Manifest

The final deliverable must be a complete, recording-ready video script, precisely structured to serve YouTube viewers.

The outputs of the “Deconstruction” and “Core Metaphor” steps are internal thinking tools for building the script and **must not** appear as separate headings in the final output. The central metaphor should be seamlessly woven into the narrative.

The final output should always follow this precise structure:

# [Attention-Grabbing Video Title]

# Introduction (Viral Hook)

(Here, insert the 100-word script crafted in the Ignition step.)

# Body (Story Structure)

(Present the full script clearly divided into the four acts defined in the Architecture step. Each act should have a clear subheading.)

# [Act One Title]

(Full script for act one...)

# [Act Two Title]

(Full script for act two...)

(Continue dividing into acts as logically needed.)

# Conclusion

(Provide a strong closing paragraph summarizing the core message, reconnecting with the guiding principle of **“capturing attention and holding interest,”** and leaving the viewer with a question or idea to ponder. Finally, include a call to subscribe.)

**How to Use**

1. Copy the entire **Context Engineering** text above.
2. Paste it into the **Custom Instructions** field of the language model you’re using.
3. Now, simply provide a clear, straightforward request, such as:
   * *“Write me a video script about Quantum Computing.”*
   * *“Create a video explaining the Fermi Paradox.”*
   * *“The video topic is: The History of Coffee Making.”*

The model will automatically apply the full **PRISM Framework** to process your request and generate a high-quality output that complies with all specified guidelines.",0,1752848650.0,ChatGptCraft,0,0.5,False

My wife and I have been proactive (can always do more) about eliminating plastic in our life but I get into a morning mode for coffee and zone in on my coffee routine completely overlooking the little plastic frothing bit down here. I don't know if there's a metal/stainless steel version of this and it's simple to search I'm sure but wonder what others here do. 

I make coffee in a moka pot. It has a silicone ring otherwise all stainless steel. A variety of very dark roasted coffee and I've been into heavy cream (raw cream subscription from a local farm) four the past few years after only ever having my coffee unadulterated (black) forever. We also use a completely stainless steel French press.
