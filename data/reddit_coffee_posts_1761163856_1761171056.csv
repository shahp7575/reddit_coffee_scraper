Funny thing is, I didn‚Äôt even know this whole ‚Äúworld‚Äù existed until a regular at the bar I worked at started sending me money ‚Äî always with a cute little note like, ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a happy, I know you had a hard day,‚Äù or ‚ÄúFuck him, let‚Äôs go shopping.‚Äù * At the time, I was stuck in a mentally abusive marriage, and those small gestures felt like the first time I was actively put before someone else in a really long time.. 
He‚Äôd DoorDash me food and coffee when I was working late, and over time, we started talking more and more openly and I started to understand what he needed, and I saw how much it meant when I gave that effort back.

1odlyrs,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1odlyrs/advice_for_my_friendship_with_bipolar_friend/,Advice for my friendship with Bipolar friend,"Hi,

I have never had a friend with Bipolar before. I've known him for a year and a half and he always seemed very grounded and stable to me. However, this past month or so, his intensity is ramping up. He is starting to be very pushy and controlling, saying things like, ""He knows what is best."" and when I disagree with him, or don't want to do something he wants me to do, he threatens the friendship and tells me we can just go our own ways, which makes me very distraught because he is a very dear friend. I care about him a lot. He has also been taking a lot of work off and is very low on money because of this. And he is taking on lots of random projects. He is drinking TONS of coffee and keeps telling me he wakes up at 2 or 3am in the morning. 

Can you guys give me some insight on this behaviour? He has flipflopped so many times. He invited me for supper this morning, but then I told him I didn't want to go on a trip this weekend (I want to next weekend instead, we had already resolved this the day prior, but he changed his mind and insisted for this weekend) and he BLEW UP. He uninvited me to supper and told me we wouldn't be friends anymore. I'm finding this very destabilizing. I am crying a lot and don't know how to handle this. Any insight would be much appreciated. Thank you. 

Oh, now I just got a text saying to come for supper. My head is spinning. ",1,1761170579.0,bipolar2,0,1.0,False
1odlvvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rants/comments/1odlvvk/hoosier_craven_a_simple_sandwich/,Hoosier Craven' a Simple Sandwich,"Why is it you can't git a sandwich at a restaurant jest the way you hanker after it anymore? Back in the day, you could mosey into most any greasy spoon, diner, coffee shop, or soda fountain and holler, ""Hey there, could ya whip me up such and such? I don't want it too thick, nor too thin-like."" Never a lick of trouble, and if they botched it up, they'd fix it right quick, no fussin' or mussin'.
Why all this jawin'? Well, I've been tryin' to rustle up a nice, flat-top grilled cheese sandwich done jest so‚Äîwith Swiss cheese, a smidge of turkey (not a heapin' pile or them thick slabs, jest a couple o' thin slices), and a slice or two of tomato. You reckon I can find one? At one joint, they ain't got a notion how to handle a flat-top grill. The next'n brings me a purty grilled sandwich, but there's so doggone much turkey piled on that I can't taste the cheese or tomato fer nothin'. The third place don't cotton to the idea that toasted ain't the same as grilled, that thin don't mean a quarter-inch or thicker... and on and on it drags. I don't even bother sendin' 'em back no more; I jest steer clear of them eateries altogether.
Now, fer them folks who might pipe up, ""Well, them things ain't on their menu,"" and you'd be spot on. But it shouldn't make a hill o' beans difference. They got the fixin's to make exactly what I'm cravin', but the hitch is, they jest don't have the gumption to do it. Much as it pains me to say, there's one spot I fancy goin' to 'cause the vittles is plumb good, but their cooks speak nary a word of English, which throws a monkey wrench in understandin' special orders. They're right fine cooks, don't get me wrong, but they jest can't quite grab hold of what I'm aimin' fer.
You ever git a powerful hankerin' fer somethin' you can't cobble together at home 'cause it ain't worth buyin' all them ingredients? I keep Texas toast 'round most weeks; I surely do love its hearty thickness and that good ol' chew when it's in a sandwich, grilled or plain as day. Most times, there's a tomato or two settin' in the icebox or on the counter, but to git a couple o' nice, thin slices of roast turkey? No siree, I'd have to buy at least a small breast, roast it myself to git it jest right, and slice it thin as paper. I can slice mighty thin by hand‚ÄîI learnt that trick way back when I was slingin' hash in a couple o' restaurants‚Äîbut I ain't fixin' to shell out that kinda dough fer somethin' that'll jest sit in the fridge and dry up like an old boot after I've made my sandwich. I can turn out a fair-to-middlin' grilled cheese in my grandma's ol' cast-iron skillet, but it still ain't the same as one done on them big, sizzlin' flat-tops down at the diner. Swiss cheese? Sometimes it's in the house, sometimes it ain't. But roundin' up all that jest to scratch this itch? I can't afford it, no how. So why can't they, fer a few bucks, make me what I'm pinin' fer?
Oh, I'd give my eyeteeth to amble back into that little ol' joint from my salad days, the Hamburger Hut up in Rochester, Indiana. I could saunter in, ask 'em to whomp up somethin' not even scribbled on the menu, and long as they had the goods, I'd git pure heaven on a bun. I can still taste their patty melts, that bubbly fountain pop, and them fries that never seen a drop o' vegetable oil‚Äîcooked in good ol' lard, I reckon. Yep, I'm reminiscin' here, yearnin' fer them bygone days, but gol-darn it, they oughta still be possible in this day and age. Thank ya kindly fer puttin' up with my yammerin'. If any o' ya know of a restaurant somewheres in Central Indiana where I can git what I'm after, show 'em this here. If that place don't exist and ya find yerself in another spot that claims to be hometown but serves up nothin' but cookie-cutter grub, show 'em this too. And above all, if ya do know such a hidden gem, please do tell me. I'm starvin' fer my youth, starvin' fer jest a good ol' sandwich made the way I want it. Thanks a heap! P.S. If it happens to come with a real zesty garlic kosher dill pickle, I'd shore like to hear 'bout it.",1,1761170394.0,Rants,1,1.0,False
1odlvf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1odlvf0/how_much_of_a_red_flag_was_this_while_dating_pre/,How much of a red flag was this while dating - pre marriage?,"Just starting the process, 15 year marriage with 2 kids, 19 years total.  Trying to grief understand where this came from aside from the obvious she cheated.  Dont want to beat myself up over the WHY and HOW but questioning looking back are these red flags or something more normal, plus it will be good info for the future.  But there is ONE thing thing that always stood out about our relationship to me is how it stared, and I am not sure if this was a red flag I should of seen or more normal than I realize.  We had out ups and downs our whole marriage, but this got me questioning, were we doomed from the start? Looking back I really question how compatible we really were and how much we tried to force ourselves to change for the other.

I met my STBX when I was 21 years old, prior to that I was in a 4 year relationship with my high school sweetheart, she went to college about 2 hours away, but I would see her almost every weekend.   The second year of college about halfway though, she told me the distance was now to hard and she met someone at school she wanted to be with. I was basically throw away for someone else, there was nothing wrong with me other than I couldn't spend enough time with her living 2 hours away. So we broke up.  Its hard to remember now but I believe I may have been single for maybe 12ish months, with 1 FWB/Situationship for a couple months and 2 ONS. I had to end the FWB because I was starting to catch feelings for her and I neither of us wanted that.

I then met my STBXW on MySpace of all places.  I was lonely, scrolling Myspace and pathetically sending out friend request to any online women within a half hour of me. After a week or two of this my STBX messaged me back and said do I know you, and I looked at her profile, seen her job and totally went with a lie.  I said I seen your picture and thought you worked at a coffee shop I have been to and wanted to say hi.  So I started it off with a lie just because I was a pathetic loser, she still doesn't know that truth.  We chatted online some before I asked her out on a date.  We had a total of 3 day dates, on the third one she asked me if I ever planned on kissing her, so I finally made my move. The 4th date we went out at night to a show at a bar.  We both got pretty drunk.  We go back to my place and she tried to go for sex but I was to drunk and out of it and said I wasn't ready yet and didn't want that to be our first time.  She was ok with that.  This concluded our fourth date, and her sleeping over for the first time.  After this she never left.  After 4 dates she came home to me every night after work, after about 2 weeks she was moving her things in with me.   She did live with her parents where I lived alone so I know she wanted out.  I was 21 and had felt so alone for so long the though of her moving in with me was AMAZING.

I think it hard to look at that now and think that this is how normal relationships should world. I question how compatible we have actually been the past 19 years and cant count the number of arguments we have  about the stupidest of things that we should of been on the same page about.  Looking back it feels we both almost had to be someone who wasn't really us to make the other happy and it sucked the life out of both of us.

1odltal,https://www.reddit.com/r/InterviewCoderPro/comments/1odltal/my_interview_method_has_an_abnormally_high/,My interview method has an abnormally high success rate. Take these tips (and ask me anything).,"Look, this might sound a bit arrogant, but I've gotten really good at interviews. I feel like it's less about a technical checklist now and more about the overall vibe you create. So, I thought I'd share some things that have worked for me.

I practised public speaking a lot when I was younger, and it taught me how to think on my feet and improvise. A great exercise is to have a friend throw random topics at you, and you have to talk about them for 5 minutes straight. They don't have to be complex topics, just anything. This simulates the flow of a natural conversation and helps you speak more cohesively and with focus under pressure.

Do your homework on the company. You don't need to do a doctoral-level report for the first few rounds. Save the deep dive, which includes a detailed look at their main competitors, for any take-home assignments or the final stages. When you're juggling interviews for 6 different companies in one week, it can be overwhelming. My method: I spend about 90 minutes researching the night before the interview, then do a quick 20-minute refresh right before the call. This is usually more than enough to show that you're knowledgeable and interested.

Have a 'peer-to-peer' mindset. Honestly, I've never been good at dealing with people in positions of authority. It helps me to remember that it's a two-way street; they need my skills as much as I need their job, maybe even more. This is a business transaction - they have the money and are willing to spend it on a service I give. When you approach it as the expert they're trying to hire, your confidence comes through naturally.

Make them laugh. Seriously. Sit up straight, be relaxed (even on Zoom, don't hunch over the camera), and talk like a normal human being. Even in the most corporate environments, you can see the interviewer's shoulders relax as soon as you break the tension. My personal rule is to try to get them to genuinely laugh at least once or twice. More than that is a bonus. People suggest making small talk about the weather or your coffee mug, which is fine, but making someone laugh in the middle of a long day of robotic interviews instantly makes you memorable.

You're the one driving this conversation. You need to be in the driver's seat. A surprising number of interviewers are just winging it. If you feel the conversation is going off track, don't be afraid to gently steer it back. You can say something like, 'This is a really enjoyable conversation. I'm just keeping an eye on the clock as I have another appointment at \[time\]. To make sure we cover the most important points, I'd love to quickly discuss how my experience directly relates to the role, and then I have a few specific questions for you. Does that work?' This is a total power move and shows you respect their time and your own.

Now for the actual content. All this vibe talk is great, but there has to be substance. I usually use one of three approaches: either I tell my career story chronologically, or I break down the 8 key skills in the job description and explain how I've demonstrated each one, or I do a hybrid where I talk about each job and the specific skills I used that fit their needs. Important tip: don't list way more skills than they asked for. It can backfire and make them think you're overqualified or won't be happy in the role. And you must, must come prepared with questions. Prepare at least 5 questions - make them deep, specific, and show you've really thought about the job, not just superficially. Stay away from generic questions like 'What's the team culture like?'. They're tired of those. A good question is to ask the hiring manager what their biggest challenge has been since they joined the company.

Rejection is just redirection. You can do everything right at every stage and still not get the job. It's happened to me, and it's a huge blow to your confidence. You have to remember that you can play a perfect game and still lose. It's not a reflection of you; that's just life sometimes. And to be frank, since we're on Reddit: I'm a senior-level professional and most of my jobs have come through headhunting. But I left a toxic job last September and was unemployed from Nov '22 to Jan '23. During that time, I sent out about 500 applications, did over 50 interviews, reached 9 final rounds, and in the end, only got 3 offers. It was devastating for my mental health. But you have to keep going. I realized the places that rejected me probably weren't looking for what I offer, and that's okay. Many companies just want a cog in the machine, not someone who will challenge and improve things. It's their loss, not yours.

Anxiety is completely normal. I still get that little shiver of anxiety 10 minutes before any call. The important thing is to give yourself space to breathe and calm down, before and after. Remember, they asked to speak with you for a reason - they already see potential in you. Your only job is to show them what they sensed on paper. My little mental trick is to tell myself, 'Okay, I'm the main event. These people are stuck in a room with me and have to listen to whatever I say. It might be genius, it might be crazy, but they're getting paid to be my audience right now.' It might sound silly, but it helps.

I'd be happy to help anyone in marketing, communications, or operations brainstorm some solid questions for their next interview.",0,1761170212.0,InterviewCoderPro,1,0.5,False

In brief, it started from some kind of very minor throat tickle or discomfort, then excess throat clearing, air hunger, and some trouble with speaking, and now it‚Äôs a hard to describe feeling of strong discomfort around the chest/throat that feels like a huge nuisance which is also making me try to cough something out. 

Gastroscopy came out clean. Some medication I got for reflux didn‚Äôt help at all (don‚Äôt recall name). I am just being told it‚Äôs stress related at this point with no other cause but I know it‚Äôs a more tangible problem and I‚Äôm kind of at wits end trying to figure it out, never mind the worsening condition.

I am a big consumer of coffee, cigarettes, and alcohol for reference. I didn‚Äôt want to bother taking the effort to cut vices until I knew what was actually wrong with me.

1odlobo,https://i.redd.it/egsveev8iqwf1.jpeg,It really is your grinder sometimes,"The grinder I‚Äôve been using is the mii coffee df54. Until recently I‚Äôve had a hard time dialing beans, getting consistent cups and identifying flavor notes.

The default burrs on the df54 are fine (no pun intended). They are able to grind coarse for pourover and fine for espresso, i saw a lot of people say that they perform good enough for pour overs so I‚Äôve not given it a second thought. Well I said screw it and spent $40, which isn‚Äôt terribly expensive for this hobby, on the upgraded burrs meant specifically for filter coffee and dude the difference is crazy.

Consistency in brew time alone is noticeable. My drawdowns are significantly quicker, and the amount of visual fines went from slightly concerning to basically gone. The clarity in flavors is great, and I no longer get weird cups that are both over and under extracted. 

Until this switch I‚Äôve tried different water solutions, brewers, brew methods, rest times, everything. First 2 days of using the new burrs it turned out that it wasn‚Äôt me and it really was just the grinder. 


TLDR if you‚Äôre gonna get a miicoffee grinder and you don‚Äôt drink espresso you may as well add and extra $40 to get the brew burrs. ",5,1761169874.0,pourover,5,1.0,False

Your new dishwasher leaves after three shifts. Your prep cook ghosts you before the week ends. You feel the money drain, but maybe not the full amount.

40% of restaurant staff quit within their first 72 hours^(1). Most attrition occurs within the first 90 days, with the first 30 days being particularly critical. If an employee makes it past the 72-hour mark, their chance of staying for six months jumps 80%^(1).

The problem cuts deeper than a busy Friday night or a short-staffed brunch service.

**The Cold Numbers**

Restaurant turnover in 2024 sits at brutal levels. Quick-service places run 135% turnover yearly^(2). Full-service restaurants hit 96%^(2). The average restaurant employee stays just 110 days^(3).

The cost to replace one employee runs $5,864^(1). That includes recruiting, training, and lost productivity.

Among those who quit, 30% of new employees say they left a job within 90 days because of poor onboarding^(4). 41% say the job was not what they expected^(5). 35%had a bad experience or incident^(5). 34% found the company culture was not what they thought^(5).

**First Impressions Last**

Walk into any restaurant kitchen at 2 pm on a Tuesday. Ask the manager about last week‚Äôs new hires. Three started Monday. One quit Wednesday. The other two are hanging in there.

This isn‚Äôt bad luck. This is predictable. This is fixable.

Research shows that structured onboarding that builds role clarity, social connection, and early wins improves retention. Restaurants that implement clear first-week training cut early turnover in half^(1).

When a new employee continues to show up, they making a decision. Not about the job. About you. About whether you give a damn. About whether this place is worth their time.

Most restaurants treat onboarding like a chore nobody wants to do. Get them through the paperwork. Throw them in the deep end of the restaurant and see if they swim.

The best operators treat the first 72 hours like a banquet. Every moment matters. Every interaction counts. Every detail determines whether they book your joint again.

**The Five Mistakes That Kill Retention**

**The Cold Start**

New hires who walk into chaos with no clear guidance. This immediate overwhelm them. Make them feel welcomed and that you have a plan for them.

**The Training Dump**

Throwing every procedure, recipe, and policy at them in one day isn‚Äôt training. Your new hires only absorb so much each day. Break the training up over several days, and weeks, so they can take it all in. Use checklists so you don‚Äôt forget anything and don‚Äôt repeat yourself unnecessarily.

**The Communication Gap**

Ignoring new employees between their hire date and first shift leaves new employees feeling uncertain and anxious. Reach out to them. Remember what it is was like to be new.

**The Schedule Shock**

Putting new hires on tough shifts or double shifts too early sets them up for failure. Blend them into the schedule, sections, stations as they prove to you they are ready.

**The Cultural Freeze-Out**

Everyone needs a sense of belonging. Failing to give them that sense makes them feel like an outsider. Introduce them to buddies who will help them become successful, and who will be safe resources for them in the future.

**The Protocol That Works**

Here is the system that works. Tested in restaurants again and again. Proven by operators who cut their turnover rates by 40% or more^(1).

**Day Zero: Before They Start**

Send a welcome text with first-day instructions. Share the employee handbook. Confirm start time, location, parking, who to ask for, and dress code.

Send the first-week schedule and a 30-day training roadmap. Prep a welcome kit including any company-provided uniform pieces, name tag, pen, small notebook, menus, recipes, thermometer, side towel, and anything else that fits with your style of restaurant.

Assign a buddy who will be their culture coach and trainer. Not a complainer. Someone who loves the place. Someone who believes in what you do. Have a couple of back up buddies, depending on everyone‚Äôs schedule. Offer the buddy a small $50 bonus if the new hire hits 60 days, and remember to report this properly.

**Day One: Make It Clear and Warm**

Be at the door 10-minutes before they arrive. Greet them with a handshake. Look them in the eye. Tell them you‚Äôre happy they‚Äôre here.

Give them a tour. Show them how to clock in, where to store personal items, find bathrooms, locate first aid, safety information, office, storage, dumpster, prep area, kitchen, dining room, bar, and when and where family meal is served.

Introduce them to every person working that shift. By name. Share stories. Tell them about the regular at Table 9. The time a rockstar ate here. Make the place come alive.

Explain your expectations. Your mission. Your service style. How breaks work. How to request shifts.

Walk them through safety and compliance. Handwashing. Temps. Allergy protocol. Harassment training. Lifting. Slip and fall prevention. Demonstrate one critical task and have them do it.

Set up their tools and logins. POS. Scheduling app. HR app. Communication apps. Prep lists. Sidework lists. Waste log. Line check.

Review their training roadmap with them. Walk through what they will learn each week and how they will be certified.

Pair them with their buddy. Have them follow their buddy all shift. Let‚Äôs them eat some of items off of your menu.

Ask two questions: ‚ÄúWhat will make this job a win for you?‚Äù and ‚ÄúAny constraints we should know about what wasn‚Äôt covered in the job interviews, like allergies, customs, school?‚Äù

Check in with them and their buddy at the end the shift. Thank them for being here. Tell them you look forward to seeing them on their next shift. Show them your restaurant culture by doing all of this.

**Days Two and Three: Build Confidence**

Have them work with their buddy again, or backup buddy.

Give them structured skill practice with immediate feedback. Have family meal with their buddy. Introduce them to regular customers and more team members.

Conduct daily progress reviews. Ten-minutes. Face to face. Ask three questions: What is going well? What is confusing? What do you need?

Address their concerns immediately. Be caring. Be transparent. Not ‚Äúwe will look into that.‚Äù You explain what can‚Äôt change and why. You fix what needs fixing. You‚Äôre the leader, act like it.

**Week One: Foundations and Confidence**

The goal is that they learn the basics, feel supported, see a clear path to success.

For back-of-house workers, cover knife and station setup, food safety, prep and yields, service. Have them shadow one rush, then run a secondary station for 20 to 30-minutes. Run a five-minute micro-test on temps, cooling steps, and label standards.

For front-of-house workers, cover steps of service, POS basics, menu knowledge, allergen protocols, and service recovery. Have them continue to work their buddy‚Äôs sections, then take a small section with support. Run a five-minute micro-test on handling a peanut allergy request, undercooked food script, and spill protocol.

End of week one, conduct a ten-minute check-in. Ask what is going well and what is confusing. Share three wins you saw. Name one skill to focus on next week. Confirm the week-two schedule.

**Week Two Through Four: Independence and Growth**

Week two focuses on controlled reps and early wins. Increase responsibility with a safety net. Demonstrate measurable wins.

Week three focuses on independence and cross-training. Workers should operate independently in their core role and start learning a second station or position.

Week four focuses on validation and path moving forward. Have their last training day on a busy shift with the manager observing. Give public recognition in pre-shift. Offer a small reward comp meal, or a small gift card to the coffee shop down the block.

Conduct a 30-day review. Score against the role scorecard. Discuss next steps. Ask two stay-interview questions: ‚ÄúWhat might tempt you to leave?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat one thing would make your job better here?‚Äù No nonsense. No corporate fluff. Address their answers.

**The Financial Reality**

The math is brutal but simple.

Every employee who quits in the first week costs you up to $5,864^(1). That includes recruitment, paperwork, training time, and productivity loss.

Everyone who stays generates value through increased productivity, customer relationships, and reduced hiring costs.

Cutting your 90-day quits from 40% to 20% on 10 hires keeps $20,000 or more in your pocket. It makes the guest experience better. It protects your culture^(4).

Restaurants that have lower turnover see significantly higher traffic and sales. Full-service restaurants with low back-of-house turnover see 5.0% higher traffic. Low front-of-house turnover delivers 7.1% higher traffic^(2).

Lower turnover means better service. Better service means more customers. More customers mean more revenue. It‚Äôs simple, and the math is a celebration.

**Beyond the Protocol**

The 72-hour protocol works because it addresses the real reasons people quit. Not money. Respect. Recognition. Purpose.

Most restaurant employees don‚Äôt expect to get rich. They expect to be treated like humans. They want to work for people who value their contribution. They want to be part of something bigger than a paycheck. They want to belong if the fit is right.

Restaurants that retain workers celebrate small wins. They recognize effort, not just results. They create advancement opportunities. They invest in training. They build teams, not just employee schedules.

Among workers who quit, lack of manager recognition ranks in the top three reasons for leaving. Hard work must be acknowledged^(3).

Growth opportunities make the difference. Without training and advancement paths, good employees leave for restaurants that offer them^(3).

**Start Today**

You can‚Äôt fix five years of bad turnover in five days. But you start today.

Pick your next three new hires. Follow the protocol exactly. Measure the results.

Track retention at 72 hours, one week, 30 days, and 90 days. Compare to your historical averages. Document what works. Fix what doesn‚Äôt.

Train your managers on the system. Not just the steps, but the philosophy. Help them understand that onboarding is sales, not administration. You‚Äôre selling people on staying.

Create accountability. Make first-week retention a key performance indicator. Tie manager bonuses to new hire retention rates. What gets measured gets managed.

The restaurants that master first-week retention win. They build stable teams. They deliver consistent service. They grow profitably while their competitors struggle to keep the doors open.

Your next new hire starts Monday. Are you ready?

Anyways I think I need to start doing a bit more self care and love like going for a swim and gym or out to coffee where I don't watch the clock. The baby takes a bottle and I have some expressed milk in the freezer, however this was from month 1/2 so small amounts & he needs two bags to fill a feed, meaning the stash will deplete quicker than I can replenish. 

My questions are how do I transition to combi feeding? My concern is if formula really does take longer to digest then how do I know when to express without damaging supply? 

& On the expressing thing do I just express at the points baby says? Or do I set a timer?

Lastly is there a way I can increase my supply a little to build up the freezer stash?

Mary Marie works at a gas station, selling bottled water and peanuts to people passing through the small highway town, and cigarettes and booze to locals. Kids walk to the store from the nearby neighborhoods. Drug dealers lean against the peeling cinder block walls and wait for customers. Old women buy coffee creamer and donuts for their grandkids. Young men fresh out of prison buy Twinkies and copies of Time magazine. Prostitutes buy candy bars. Husbands buy their daughters pads and tampons and generic brand Ibuprofen. Some people have a gun. Some people have cash. Mary Marie only cares about the second one.¬†



One Friday night, a young woman comes in, clearly frightened, and tries to buy a half gallon of milks and some Pringles. When a man comes in, the young woman quickly asks where the bathroom is, leaving her purchases on the counter. The man asks if a woman who looked like her came in. Mary Marie considers what to do. Tell him and do nothing? Tell him and call the cops. She looks at the half gallon of milks and - against her better judgment - lies. The woman who‚Äôs been in was about twenty pounds heavy and a decade grayer. The man thanks her, walks around the store a little longer, then asks about the bathroom. Employees only, Mary Marie says. It keeps it clean for her. The man thanks her again, less convincingly, then leaves. Once she sees him drive away, Mary Marie goes and gets the girl out of the bathroom - asking her if she just fucked up.



Anna confesses that the man was her boyfriend, but that he turned out to be a sexually manipulative asshole who forced her into sex work.



Over the next two days, Mary Marie takes the girl - Anna - around town while Anna works up the courage to tell the cops what‚Äôs happened to her. She lets her stay at her house, takes her to church, and slowly the two bond. Mary Marie shares her dream of having three kids, a chain link fence, and a husband who does crossword puzzles with her after work. She wants to be a teacher again, third grade. Anna says she‚Äôd rather burn in hell than have kids. She wants to be a nurse. Mary Marie says that‚Äôs a bullshit job. Nurses are all bitches. Anna says that isn‚Äôt true. Her mom is a nurse, and she‚Äôs the best person she knows. Mary Marie says that a nurse called her a whore when she went in with cramping while she was pregnant. She lost the baby a few days later. Anna apologies. Mary Marie says it‚Äôs fine. Shit happens. But Anna better promise to be a better nurse than that.¬†



As the weekend progresses, Mary Marie and Anna grow increasingly concerned about Anna‚Äôs abuser - who it turns out is following them. When he confronts them at Mary Marie‚Äôs home, she tells him to get the hell away or to kill her, because either way he‚Äôs going to jail. He laughs, spits on her porch, and tells her that he‚Äôll come back in the morning and pick Anna up. Mary Marie tells Anna she has to go to the police. Anna refuses. It‚Äôs not worth the risk or embarrassment. Instead, she says, she‚Äôs going hitchhike to the next town over, then take a bus somewhere. Mary Marie calls her stupid, and says she should go home to her mother and become a nurse. Do something good with her life. Anna says goodbye, and leaves.¬†



The next day, Mary Marie goes to work and greets one of the people she introduced Anna to - an old woman who comes in every Monday for a cherry pie and a coffee on her way to work. A start of the week pick-me-up. She tells Mary Marie how happy she always is to see her.¬†



Mary Marie smiles, and says she‚Äôs always happy to see her too. Then, she walks over to the wall of cold drinks, and pours a half gallon of milk onto the floor.¬†

They were small, weightless things, white specks that had once looked like tiny stars tangled on green stems. I had placed them in a thin glass vase on my desk, beside the window where the late afternoon light softened the edges of everything. By Monday, they had begun to curl. Their stems turned dry and paper-thin, and their blossoms, once soft enough to mistake for mist, had stiffened into fragile ghosts of themselves. I didn‚Äôt notice right away. The days blend when you‚Äôre constantly rushing from one thing to the next, therapy sessions, lessons, reports, the steady hum of responsibility that never really ends. When I finally looked at them, something inside me stilled. I should‚Äôve changed the water, I thought. I should‚Äôve cared for them better. But maybe that‚Äôs what I do, I take care of everything except the things that need gentleness, including myself. Baby‚Äôs breath has always been my favourite flower. Most people overlook them, seeing them as background decoration, a filler for brighter, bolder blooms. But I‚Äôve always loved how they hold the bouquet together quietly, asking for nothing, existing in their own still way. Maybe that‚Äôs why I buy them. Maybe it‚Äôs the only part of myself I know how to tend to, the part that stays silent, unassuming, steady. I didn‚Äôt throw them out. For days, they stood there, fading gracefully. Each time I looked at them, I saw a different version of myself: the girl who never asked for much, the woman who tries to be fine, the quiet presence that fills the space between other people‚Äôs chaos. They were delicate, yes, but they endured longer than anyone expected. By Thursday, the stems had started to collapse in on themselves. That morning, I poured my coffee, sat down, and stared at them again. Something about their stillness mirrored the feeling inside me, the exhaustion that doesn‚Äôt always look like sadness, just a kind of emptiness that hums quietly beneath the surface. I remembered someone asking, ‚ÄúWhat do you do to care for yourself?‚Äù And I‚Äôd laughed, unsure if I was supposed to have an answer. On Friday, I decided to replace them. I went to the florist after work, still in my work clothes, hair pulled back, eyes tired. The shop smelled like damp earth and sunlight. Rows of flowers crowded the small space, lilies with their bold fragrance, roses with their soft arrogance, tulips like small hearts half-opened. But my eyes went straight to the corner where the baby‚Äôs breath hung in bundles, small and weightless, like clouds that had forgotten how to float. The florist smiled. ‚ÄúThey dry beautifully, you know,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs kind of the point.‚Äù When I got home, I took the dead flowers from the vase and laid them gently on the desk. They looked brittle, somehow still elegant, like they‚Äôd aged into something quieter, wiser. I placed the new bundle beside them, fresh and white, tiny blooms crowding together like whispers. For the first time in a long while, I changed the water. I even cleaned the vase. I stood there for a moment, watching the sunlight catch on the new blossoms. They glowed faintly, and for the smallest second, I felt something stir inside me, not joy exactly, but something close to peace. Maybe this was what healing looked like: not loud, not perfect, not final, but small acts of care repeated over time. Maybe I wasn‚Äôt broken. Maybe I was just tired. The dead flowers stayed on the desk for another week. I couldn‚Äôt throw them away. They reminded me of where I‚Äôd been, of everything I‚Äôd survived. But beside them, the new ones stood tall, alive, radiant in their quiet way. I didn‚Äôt tell anyone about the flowers. It was enough that they were there ‚Äî one bundle reminding me of what fades, the other of what can still grow when you decide to try again. And for the first time in months, Monday didn‚Äôt feel like an ending. It felt like a beginning.",1,1761169274.0,u_coffee_direction,0,1.0,False

Born and raised in Harlem, growing up around wiseguys, detective-turned-movie producer Sonny Grosso knew New York City like the back of his hand. And, after finishing working on Friedkin‚Äôs French Connection, he was next working as a technical advisor on The Godfather. Where, he soon met Marlon Brando, himself, recalling:

‚ÄúI was walking by Brando‚Äôs trailer, and suddenly he tapped on his window and said, ‚ÄòSonny, come in here for a minute.‚Äô Even though I tried to be cool, Brando the god is calling me into his trailer. I shake his hand and he says, ‚ÄòSo you‚Äôre the cop that made The French Connection? Can you get me a copy of the book?‚Äô Being a wiseass, I wanted to say, ‚ÄòSorry, I can‚Äôt,‚Äô to tease him but I immediately ran out to get a copy and he shouts, ‚ÄòSonny, and you autograph it!‚Äô I was six feet off the ground. I mean I was a kid from Harlem and Marlon Brando, the guy who was bigger than life, wanted my autographed copy of Robin Moore‚Äôs book about our case. Who would believe it? I sure didn‚Äôt!

‚ÄúNext day, Brando waves me into his trailer again, gives me a cup of coffee and proceeds to ask me some of the most intelligent questions I ever got about The French Connection case and book. He‚Äôd read the whole damn thing overnight and he asked me things like the weight of the car carrying the heroin from Marseille‚Äîthe detail which finally helped bust the French Connection.‚Äù

Grosso recalls how he was in awe of being in Marlon Brando‚Äôs presence: ‚ÄúI mean we all saw him play the animalistic Stanley Kowalski shouting, ‚ÄòStella! Hey, Stella!‚Äô in Tennessee Williams‚Äô A Streetcar Named Desire.‚Äù

Brando earned several Oscar nominations, including for ‚ÄúA Streetcar,‚Äù for ‚ÄúViva Zapata,‚Äù for ‚ÄúJulius Caesar,‚Äù and for ‚ÄúOn the Waterfront.‚Äù Of course, he did refuse to accept the Best Actor Academy Award that he finally won for his role as Vito Corleone in ‚ÄúThe Godfather.‚Äù

1odlb50,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1odlb50/the_abyss_remembers_part_1/,The Abyss Remembers (part 1),"I can always tell when the pressure outside changes.  
 It‚Äôs not the instruments that give it away ‚Äî it‚Äôs the walls. The bulkheads stretch a fraction of a millimeter, a low groan running through the station like the breath of something sleeping beside us. No one else seems to notice it anymore, but I do. I hear it in the ducts, in the water pipes, in the rhythm of my own pulse. The deep reminds us where we are.

Seven miles down. The *Thalassa Array*.

They call it an oceanic research installation, though that‚Äôs only what it says in the briefings. Down here, language is mostly disguise. Every word means less the deeper you go.

I came aboard ninety-three days ago. Three months feels longer when the sun never visits. We measure time by shifts, not by light. Each rotation is twelve hours ‚Äî systems, diagnostics, maintenance, then sleep. When I dream, I see the corridors folding inward like ribs. Sometimes I dream I‚Äôm outside the hull without a suit, watching the station drift like an ember through black water.

I don‚Äôt remember why I signed the contract. Money, I suppose. Or the idea of doing something that mattered. Mostly, I wanted quiet. Up there, quiet never lasted. Down here, it‚Äôs absolute ‚Äî until it wasn‚Äôt.



The *Array* is smaller than people imagine when they hear ‚Äúgovernment facility.‚Äù Six decks stacked like vertebrae around a pressure core. Everything hums. The air recyclers taste faintly metallic, and the light is always too white, too thin. We live inside a lung that never exhales.

The upper deck holds command and comms. The middle is research and engineering. I sleep below that, in maintenance ‚Äî the narrowest hallways, the lowest ceilings. When the generators throttle up, the floor trembles and you can feel the whole structure sway, a shudder like the heartbeat of the world.

Every corridor looks the same, and still, after three months, I catch myself turning the wrong way. There‚Äôs an instinct for direction on the surface ‚Äî sunrise, wind, smell. None of that applies here. If you stripped the signs off the walls, we‚Äôd never find our way back to our bunks.



There are eight of us. Fewer than you‚Äôd expect for a station this size, but fewer means fewer variables ‚Äî that‚Äôs what *Rourke* says.

He‚Äôs the captain. Tall, shaved head, eyes that never soften. The kind of man who believes authority is a substitute for sleep. I respect him because he doesn‚Äôt waste words. He keeps the Array running like an old warship, rules printed on laminated cards in every corridor: **NO ALCOHOL. NO PERSONAL COMMS. NO UNAUTHORIZED DIVE ORDERS.** He‚Äôs been down here five rotations straight. I think he forgot how silence feels without engines in it.

*Ilyin* runs the science division. She rarely eats with us. When she does, she brings her tea in a clear mug and stares through it like glass will answer her. Everything about her is precise ‚Äî speech, posture, handwriting. She speaks softly but cuts through noise like sonar. There‚Äôs a rumor she once led a mission to Europa and lost half her team. No one asks her about it.

*Quill* is the diver ‚Äî senior, fearless, the kind who smokes near the oxygen tanks just to see who flinches. She keeps a strip of shark-tooth charms wrapped around her wrist. ‚ÄúFor luck,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúOr leverage.‚Äù She calls the trench ‚Äúthe drop.‚Äù Says it like she‚Äôs talking about a lover.

*Pike* handles mechanics with me. He‚Äôs all grease and laughter, but it‚Äôs armor. The man talks about engines the way priests talk about sin. ‚ÄúEverything down here wants to rust,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúMetal‚Äôs just waiting to remember it‚Äôs dust.‚Äù

*Kessler* is psych ‚Äî our quiet warden. Pale, immaculate hair, always writing notes on paper instead of terminals. She asks how you‚Äôre sleeping, how you‚Äôre feeling, and you never quite know if you‚Äôre being studied or cared for.

*Reyes* handles comms and sonar. Youngest aboard besides me. Talks too much, sings when he‚Äôs nervous. He‚Äôs one of those people who tells stories so outlandish you can‚Äôt tell where the truth lies in them if any. For instance, he once said his aunt commands a top-secret space station in Earth‚Äôs orbit. He says he hears ‚Äúchoruses‚Äù in the static sometimes ‚Äî frequencies that sound like voices overlapping. Nobody believes him, but nobody laughs either.

*Mirren* is medical and rescue support. Former navy diver turned medic. He‚Äôs steady, speaks in low tones meant to calm panic before it starts. When Quill jokes too hard or Pike curses the wiring, Mirren just says, ‚ÄúEasy now,‚Äù and somehow it works.

And then there‚Äôs me ‚Äî systems maintenance. I keep the lights on, the air clean, the pressure tolerances in the green. Down here, if I make a mistake, everyone dies before they realize it. It‚Äôs not heroic; it‚Äôs arithmetic.



Morning shift begins with the hum of the main reactor dropping to standby. I do my rounds ‚Äî pressure gauges, turbine output, oxygen ratios. I talk to the machines more than I talk to people. Machines at least respond predictably.

By mid-shift, the labs wake up. Ilyin and Kessler argue softly over data protocols while Reyes fills the comm room with music from a decade no one remembers. Quill hovers near the dive bay, waiting for authorization to take the *Nereid* out again. Rourke makes rounds like a ghost.

Meals are communal ‚Äî mess hall on Deck 3. The air smells of reheated curry and disinfectant. Conversation flows in short bursts; laughter sounds too loud in recycled air. When silence returns, it feels heavier than before.

Every night before sleep, I check the systems one last time. The hum never stops. It threads through dreams like a pulse.



The first real argument came over the comm tower calibration. Reyes insisted the signal drift wasn‚Äôt random ‚Äî that something was reflecting the ping back from deeper than our sonar range. Pike told him the readings were garbage caused by thermal layers. They almost came to blows before Rourke intervened.

Later, when I passed the comms room, Reyes was still there, headset on, whispering into static. He didn‚Äôt see me. I heard him say, *‚ÄúDo you remember me?‚Äù*

I didn‚Äôt ask.



In the third month of my time on the Array, the station trembled hard enough to spill a mug in the galley. Rourke said it was a deep-fault adjustment. Pike swore he felt the tremor start *above* us, not below.

That night, the pressure sensors flickered for seven seconds. Readings spiked as if the ocean had thickened around us. Then everything normalized. Logs showed no anomaly.

When I mentioned it to Ilyin, she smiled ‚Äî the first real smile I‚Äôd seen from her ‚Äî and said, ‚ÄúThe sea breathes. Don‚Äôt mistake breathing for hunger.‚Äù



There‚Äôs a viewport on Deck 5 where the observation glass arcs into the trench. I go there when the others sleep. It‚Äôs the only place where the noise thins enough to think. The floodlights reach maybe thirty meters before the dark swallows them. Sometimes, tiny particles drift by ‚Äî marine snow, plankton, maybe dust from the vents.

Once, I saw a flash far off, faint and blue, like lightning buried under miles of water. When I reported it, the sensor logs were blank. Pike said it was just ionization. Ilyin didn‚Äôt comment.



The days bleed together. Without sunlight, time has no rhythm; only machinery tells you when to wake. The vents click at shift change, the lights dim a fraction, and the galley reheats the same sealed trays. Down here, monotony is mercy. Routine keeps the mind from folding in on itself.

Still, the station has moods. Some mornings the corridors feel too narrow, the lights too sharp. Conversations die mid-sentence. Other days, people linger longer at breakfast as if pretending we‚Äôre something like a family. Then the silence returns, heavy as pressure.



Don‚Äôt get me wrong, we talked. Usually over meals. Like breakfast rotation. Powdered eggs, rehydrated greens, coffee so bitter it feels medicinal.

Pike‚Äôs already there, boots up on the opposite chair, flicking through diagnostic readouts on his tablet. He grins when he sees me.  
 ‚ÄúMorning, saint of the wiring. You patch the coolant leak or should I prepare to drown slow?‚Äù

‚ÄúPatched,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll die of boredom before pressure loss.‚Äù

Quill laughs ‚Äî she‚Äôs cleaning a dive regulator, the metal gleaming like a silver spine. ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt mind a little excitement. Whole ocean out there and we sit in here polishing pipes.‚Äù

Rourke enters. Conversation cuts like a switch. He eats standing up, staring at the ceiling as if waiting for orders from above that never come.

Kessler watches all of us the way doctors watch vital signs ‚Äî quiet, steady, assessing. Her voice is even when she speaks:  
 ‚ÄúBoredom is safety. You should want boredom.‚Äù

Quill smirks. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd make a great recruiter.‚Äù

Rourke doesn‚Äôt look up. ‚ÄúBoredom keeps you breathing. Remember that.‚Äù

It‚Äôs not a threat, exactly. Just fact. But it lingers over the table longer than it should.



After breakfast, I check the power core. The vibration is constant, a low animal purr that seeps into your bones. Every bolt hums with it.

Maintenance logs show minor fluctuations in the secondary turbine ‚Äî nothing outside parameters. I recalibrate, listen to the pitch settle. When you‚Äôve been down here long enough, you can tell stability by sound alone.

Through the intercom, Reyes‚Äôs voice bursts in and out, cheerful static. ‚ÄúComms check ‚Äî any of you magicians down there messing with signal routing? I‚Äôm getting echoes again.‚Äù

‚ÄúDefine echoes,‚Äù I say.

‚ÄúReflections. Like someone‚Äôs repeating me half a second late. Same words. Same tone.‚Äù

Pike answers before I can: ‚ÄúCongratulations, you‚Äôve discovered latency. Happens when you talk too much.‚Äù

Reyes chuckles, but his laugh fades quick. ‚ÄúNah. This one‚Äôs different. Feels close. Like inside the line.‚Äù

The channel clicks dead. I don‚Äôt mention it to anyone else.



Later, Kessler stops me outside the elevator. Clipboard in one hand, stylus in the other. Her hair never moves, as though gravity forgot her.

‚ÄúHow are you sleeping?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell enough.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou dream?‚Äù

‚ÄúSometimes.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat of?‚Äù

‚ÄúSurface things. Nothing useful.‚Äù

She nods, writes something. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre adapting.‚Äù

I want to ask what that means ‚Äî *adapting to what* ‚Äî but the elevator doors close between us.



The dive bay smells like oil and salt. Quill‚Äôs voice echoes against the metal hulls of the submersibles. She‚Äôs arguing with Mirren again.

‚ÄúI can handle a solo descent. Just to check the vent array.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can wait for authorization.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the medic, not the boss.‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly. I know how bodies fail.‚Äù

Their words carry heat but not anger ‚Äî the kind of rhythm old colleagues fall into when they‚Äôve argued too many times to count.

Rourke enters mid-sentence. ‚ÄúNo unauthorized dives.‚Äù His tone leaves no oxygen for reply. Quill exhales through her teeth, slams the suit locker shut, and walks off. Mirren shakes his head, muttering.

When Rourke sees me near the consoles, he stops. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs the power grid?‚Äù

‚ÄúStable.‚Äù

He studies me. ‚ÄúKeep it that way. We can lose anything but that.‚Äù



Lights dim to simulation dusk. The hum feels louder in the dark. I eat alone in the mess, spoon scraping the tray. Across the room, Ilyin sits with her data slates stacked like prayer books. She hasn‚Äôt spoken in hours.

Finally, she looks up. ‚ÄúYou believe in coincidences?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot really.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. They don‚Äôt survive down here.‚Äù

She goes back to reading. I don‚Äôt ask what she means.



Halfway through night shift, Reyes pings me on comms again.  
 ‚ÄúYou awake?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm working.‚Äù

‚ÄúLucky you. You should see this.‚Äù

I head up to the sonar room. Screens flicker with the green wash of the trench. Nothing moves.

‚ÄúWhat am I looking at?‚Äù

He points to a faint blur near the bottom of the grid. ‚ÄúReflection popped three times. Depth thirty-eight thousand feet. Then gone.‚Äù

‚ÄúProbably equipment noise.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe. But listen.‚Äù

He plays the recording. The ping echoes back distorted ‚Äî not the clean chirp of sonar but something almost tonal, like a note sung underwater. For half a second, it sounds human.

Reyes grins nervously. ‚ÄúTell me that‚Äôs normal.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt answer. The hum of the Array fills the silence between us.



That night, I dream I‚Äôm outside the station. The water is clear, brighter than it should be. Below me stretches an endless plain of black stone ridges, like vertebrae. Something glows between them ‚Äî slow, pulsing. I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs light or memory.

When I wake, my throat tastes of salt.



Morning again ‚Äî or what passes for it.

Pike‚Äôs fixing a valve. ‚ÄúRourke‚Äôs in a mood,‚Äù he says without looking up. ‚ÄúGuess who he‚Äôs blaming for the comm drift?‚Äù

‚ÄúReyes?‚Äù

‚ÄúAlways. Says he‚Äôs got ghosts in his wires.‚Äù

Quill laughs from behind us. ‚ÄúBetter than in your lungs.‚Äù

Rourke‚Äôs voice crackles over the intercom. ‚ÄúAll personnel to briefing.‚Äù



Rourke stands at the display wall. Maps of the trench flicker behind him ‚Äî luminous veins stretching into darkness.

‚ÄúCommand sent new parameters,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre to map vent activity along the southern ridge. Quill, you‚Äôll lead dive prep. Mirren support. Ilyin wants samples if possible. Minimal excursion.‚Äù

Quill‚Äôs eyes brighten; she tries not to smile. Rourke notices. ‚ÄúWe follow procedure to the letter. No deviations.‚Äù

Kessler raises a hand. ‚ÄúDepth?‚Äù

‚ÄúForty thousand. Within tolerance.‚Äù

Reyes mutters under his breath, ‚ÄúIf the ocean allows it.‚Äù

No one laughs.

After the meeting, I linger by the viewport. The trench stretches away, vast and unknowable. I press my hand against the glass. It‚Äôs cold enough to numb skin.

Sometimes I imagine there‚Äôs something on the other side pressing back.

Behind me, Ilyin‚Äôs reflection appears in the glass. She doesn‚Äôt turn her head when she speaks.

‚ÄúDo you ever feel like it‚Äôs listening?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe sea?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe deep.‚Äù

She pauses. ‚ÄúAs if it‚Äôs learning the shape of us.‚Äù

Before I can reply, she walks away.



Before sleep I record an entry.

‚ÄúSystems nominal. Crew stable. Dive scheduled for next rotation. Sonar drift unresolved. The hum persists ‚Äî amplitude constant, but there‚Äôs a pattern forming underneath, like a second pulse out of sync. Maybe coincidence. Maybe not.  
 End log.‚Äù

I shut the recorder off. The sound of the Array fills the room. A soft, wet rhythm ‚Äî like a heart learning to beat.

Somewhere in the dark, metal creaks as if bending toward me.

I lie awake, counting the seconds between each breath, and try not to wonder whether the station is breathing with me.

1odladx,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1odladx/routine_struggles/,Routine Struggles,"I‚Äôve been so flaky with friends recently, and I really need to fix this.

Since my diagnosis in March 2024 where I found 13.4 A1C, I have fortunately maintained sub 6.5 A1C with lifestyle and 500 mg Metformin twice daily. I have found that running or swimming for ~30 minutes in the mornings before work about 30 minutes after breakfast has been a huge boon to my blood sugar throughout the day. With meal prepping lunches a few days at a time and breakfast/coffee the night before while I make dinner, I still find myself needing to wake up 3 hours or 2.5 hours before my shift begins, whether leaving from mine or my partner‚Äôs place, in order to consistently be on time for work. I find I have about 4.5 hours after commuting from work before I should be winding down for bed, during which I can have chores, an errand, and time I need to spend exorcising more in order to maintain blood sugar I am comfortable with. 

Today, I was going to meet up with a good friend for a shared hobby. This is already at some cost to my routine, typically some of it being my sleep (which I‚Äôd really like at least 7 hours of) and some after work exorcise. My manager approached me at work today letting me know that I‚Äôll need to be in a couple hours early to cover a work task. I let my friend know this, and asked if we could try rescheduling for Friday. They were rightfully upset. This isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve recently flaked due to what feels like any unexpected change to a schedule made more demanding by diabetes.

I realize this isn‚Äôt specifically a diabetes problem, but it feels like this issue has been exacerbated in my life since my diagnosis and the measures needed to take care of myself. How have y‚Äôall managed packing your diabetes routines into your schedules? Are there any tips or hacks y‚Äôall have made, allowing for stronger commitments to the things you enjoy in your lives?",1,1761168941.0,diabetes_t2,0,1.0,False

A story about understanding procrastination instead of fighting it


We think procrastination is laziness, but it‚Äôs often self-protection. Here‚Äôs how I stopped postponing my life by listening to my mind.

‚∏ª

The Problem We All Know

Last spring, I stared at a blank document for three hours.
The cursor blinked like a metronome of guilt.
I‚Äôd promised myself I‚Äôd start that project today.
I said the same thing yesterday.

Instead, I cleaned my desk, checked my email, and poured coffee I didn‚Äôt want.
I wasn‚Äôt lazy. I was afraid.
Afraid it wouldn‚Äôt be perfect.
Afraid to fail again.

‚∏ª

When Delay Becomes a Loop

That fear hides behind most procrastination.
It pretends to be logic. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ready yet.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll start when I feel inspired.‚Äù
But each delay strengthens the loop.

You doubt yourself more.
The task grows larger in your mind.
Soon, even opening the file feels impossible.
Then you start to believe something is wrong with you.

‚∏ª

The Shift That Changed Everything

One day, I changed one question.
Instead of asking, ‚ÄúHow do I make myself do this?‚Äù, I asked, ‚ÄúWhy am I avoiding it?‚Äù

That shift changed everything.
It wasn‚Äôt about willpower. It was about understanding what my mind was protecting me from.

That insight became the base of my work.
Procrastination isn‚Äôt defiance. It‚Äôs a signal.
When you read the signal, action stops being a fight.

‚∏ª

What Life Looks Like After the Shift

You sit down to work and feel calm.
You start without guilt or the demand for perfection.
You finish. You close the laptop. You feel peace.

That happens when you stop forcing your mind and start hearing it.

‚∏ª

Your Turn

I made a short, psychology-based guide called The Gentle Momentum Method.
It gives you practical exercises to:
‚Ä¢ Understand your emotional triggers
‚Ä¢ Reframe your thoughts
‚Ä¢ Build steady, kind momentum on low-motivation days

No hustle talk. No guilt. Only clarity and small daily wins.

‚∏ª

1odl3h5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1odl3h5,Day 40 recovery meal plan,"Day 40 post discharge - continued recovery

Breakfast - the usual porridge, with soya milk alongside yogurt and berries. Just one sugar in my coffee today, but I still throughly enjoyed 10/10

Lunch - Pitta with ham and cream cheese! tomatoes and an orange alongside funky faces 8/10

Snacks - two all butter biscuits and one oat crunch with a cuppa 10/10 (a new ritual!) biscuit recommendations appreciated!!

Dinner - chicken, tomatoes, jacket potato and mixed veg 7.5/10

Dessert - Lindt chocolate, milk bottles, a chewy Percy and a jelly baby 9/10 (I struggled a lot with this again! I felt it was 'too much') my sister said this wouldn‚Äôt fill a hole for most normal people never mind someone recovering ü§£

Snack - Rice Krispies soya milk with yogurt and fruit! 10/10

Really happy I get to stay home, but I am already slipping so time to get myself in order. I am annoyed because I am still so affected by calories, I know this isn't going to go away overnight and getting rid of the apps and weighing all my food is a massive mental relief and stress I am so thankful for. I think I am going to try and use the mental calculations to my advantage, I.E I know the calories that should be in my lunches/snacks roughly so its about making sure they are sufficient, not weighing or anything but just being honest with myself. For example I know I need to have 5 of my biscuits in the afternoon to get the energy I need for that snack. So the next challenge is having the 5 or if I am out getting a snack/meal choosing one that has around the right energy for that time, instead of having something less and convincing myself it is fine because at least I have technically followed the plan (the ED is so sneaky). Its just very hard because now I've gained weight I feel like I don't even need the meal plan, I don't need all of this food, it seems excessive to my brain and portioning/eating is becoming difficult - I think having pre-portioned things may be helpful for a while. Also reminding myself, well trying to, I still have a way to go!

Some positives though, after my successful appointment dad brought me to my favourite supermarket and I got some more milk bottles, Rice Krispies, Corn flakes (hospital memories), salmon and more of my favourite soya milk. I really appreciate him driving me to my appointments/shops and trying to keep me occupied as best he can! Hope you all are well. ",4,1761168475.0,recoveryplates,0,1.0,False

1. Coffee: The dark liquid promise that today, today, I will be a functional human.

""Based on your sleep data and yesterday's step count, I recommend 20 minutes of high-intensity interval training.""

My body, a wiser philosopher than any algorithm, whispered:

""I recommend 10 minutes of high-intensity existential staring, followed by a gentle walk to the coffee machine.""

My coffee is bitter and honest. My workout is flawed and human. My AI is a collection of probabilities pretending to be a guru.

This is worse.

This is about friendship that showed up
feeling warm,
feeling safe,
feeling like finally‚Äî
someone who gets it.

Someone who made your soul exhale.
Who leaned in close and said tell me more.
Who collected your secrets like seashells,
turning them over in her hands,
admiring them in the light.

But you didn't know she was taking notes.
You didn't know she was filing away
every insecurity,
every fear,
every raw, unfiltered truth you offered up
like communion‚Äî
reorganizing them,
repackaging them,
weaponizing them.

While you thought you were building something,
she was building a case.

She couldn't stand the thought of you being chosen as captain.
So she made herself coach instead.
Stole the whistle.
Benched you.
Told everyone you were still on the team‚Äî
smiled that bright, toothy grin
while the knife stayed tucked behind her back.

And suddenly the team you thought you had?
They're looking at you different.
Whispering.
She planted seeds in soil you'd already tilled,
and now there's a garden of doubt
growing where your reputation used to be.

She flicked her hair around your husband.
Laughed at his jokes a little too loud,
a little too long.
Rolled her eyes at your honesty
because truth and snake skin don't mix well.

So no‚Äî

this isn't a tragic love story.
No one's making a movie about this.
No one's writing ballads or lighting candles.
This is the betrayal no one prepares you for.

The one where you let someone into your home.
Into your life.
Trusted them with your kids' names
and your mother's birthday
and the way you take your coffee.

And they surprised you
with a sharp slap of reality
right under your chin
when you least expected it‚Äî
and called it normal.
Called it girl drama.
Called it you being sensitive.
But you know what it really was?

Calculated.
Cold.
Cruel.

And the worst part?
You didn't see it coming.

Because you were too busy being a friend.

**1. Start with a ‚ÄúWish List‚Äù of Goods**¬†

What do you love? Coffee? Skincare? Ceramics? Pick a theme and research destinations known for those specialities. Some ideas:¬†

* Matcha in Uji, Japan ‚Äì visit tea farms and do tastings¬†
* Skincare in Seoul, South Korea ‚Äì join a K-beauty shopping tour¬†
* Spices in Marrakech, Morocco ‚Äì explore souks with a local guide¬†
* Butter in France ‚Äì yes, people are packing coolers for Bordier butter¬†

**2. Go Beyond Tourist Shops**¬†

Skip the souvenir stands. Instead, head to:¬†

* Local grocery stores¬†¬†
* Artisan workshops and maker markets¬†
* Craft-focused neighborhoods¬†¬†
* Speciality food tours or cooking classes¬†

**3. Do Your Homework**¬†

The best finds are often off the beaten path. Before you go:¬†

* Follow local creators on TikTok or Instagram¬†
* Search hashtags like #GoodsGetaway or #TravelHaul¬†
* Bookmark local brands and markets to visit¬†
* Learn a few phrases to help you chat with shopkeepers¬†

**4. Pack Smart**¬†

If you‚Äôre bringing home perishables or fragile items:¬†

* Bring a small cooler bag for things like cheese or butter¬†
* Pack bubble wrap or use clothes to cushion breakables¬†
* Check customs rules for food, alcohol, and beauty products¬†

**5. Make It Personal**¬†

The best souvenirs are the ones with stories. Whether it‚Äôs a handmade bowl from a local potter or a cult smoothie you tried in LA, choose things that connect you to the place.¬†

I recently had one of the best trips of my life ‚Äî to **Sikkim**.  
From Gangtok to Lachung, every moment felt like a deep breath of fresh air. The landscapes were beyond words, the people were kind and humble, and even the dogs felt like they were part of the welcoming spirit of this beautiful state.

Everywhere I went, I couldn‚Äôt help but think ‚Äî *this is how every corner of India should feel.* Clean, peaceful, respectful, and filled with heart. You Sikkimese folks have truly built something special. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Our last stop was **Lachung**, and that‚Äôs where something special happened. I met a wonderful lady who owns a cozy little place called **‚ÄúCoffee with a View‚Äù** near Lachung View Point. We had carried some canvas boards planning to paint during the trip, but never got the chance. She‚Äôd jokingly (and sweetly) asked for one of our paintings if we ever made it.

Now that I‚Äôm back home, I really want to send her one of my paintings ‚Äî as a small token of how much her warmth (and Sikkim‚Äôs) stayed with me. Unfortunately, there‚Äôs no direct delivery service to Lachung, and the nearest possible drop seems to be **Gangtok**.

So here‚Äôs my small request ‚Äî if anyone reading this happens to be traveling from **Gangtok to Lachung**, or knows someone who can help deliver a painting safely to the cafe **‚ÄúCoffee with a View‚Äù**, please let me know. I‚Äôd love to get it across to her.

Thank you again, Sikkim, for showing what harmony, hospitality, and heart look like. You‚Äôve truly set a standard for the rest of India. üôè

Warm regards,

Someone I fell in love with, someone I got to know and became good friends with.

Heyy Sasha(not her real name), 

I met you on 5th June 2024, the day I watched you walk with the receptionist introducing you to the people working there, I watched you walk with him clueless, your introverted mind freaking it but u watched you get introduced to everyone and you stood strong. We spoke two days later and the moment my eyes met yours, I was sure that they were the most beautiful thing that I have ever seen, the moon will complain to the angels about how beautiful your eyes were, the sunset on the shore would be jealous on how stunning your eyes are, a peacock wouldn't dare stand next to you.

Every breath you took, every move you did, every step you took, I adored, I admired, everytime you ranted to me I admired the way you expressed yourself, everytime we walked from the interns room to our departments I enjoyed those small conversations, the small friendship group we had and the number of times you bullyed me I watched you smile happier, the number of times I accepted that it's my fault even though it wasn't and your smerk was just so beautiful (that smile that got me head over heels for you).

This letter was supposed to be dipped in black coffee and put in an envelope, sealed tight with reddish black mark.

I wish I got to know you better before I asked you out, ik I ruined everything. It's been over a year and you have been on my mind forever, I wish I could redo everything, be the guy you would fall for, I became a vegetarian for you, learnt to cook amazing food that you like, I promise to share all my tiramisu for you and yes coffee with medium sugar and little extra strong, dbc from corner house surely fills you up but I am here to complete it knowing it's hard for you to finish.

Hope you are happy, hope you are living the way you want, hope things are better on your end. Hope the US treats you well, be safe and happy, also I changed my phone, got a better one (not the broken one)",2,1761167598.0,love,1,1.0,False

we are getting married in sayulita in spring of 26 so this was our first visit there ever (this past weekend  october 2025) and i was a bit nervous based on what i had seen online and read here. I was quickly reassured by so many things and we can't wait to go back for our wedding with all of our friends and family. here are a quick few notes on our experience. these are all things I wish I would have known or had been shared before our trip so i hope this eases some future visitors mind.

* money: we were able to get pesos ahead of time (5,000 pesos) so unfortunately i have no update to share on the bank but i did notice quite a few atms were just off. again, we didn't need pesos so i didn't look very hard
* i was SHOCKED how many places took card. we went to several restaurants and coffee spots and most of them had a 300MXN minimum for card which was not hard to achieve with 2 of us. for the pharmacy, we just used pesos. a lot of places use google too and would communicate that they took visa. I wouldn't count on AMEX working at a lot of places
* I am a 25yr old female and never once felt unsafe anywhere. as long as you know how to say ""no gracias"" to the street vendors, you will be just fine 
* Golf cart makes travelling around a lot easier but is not required. we only rented 1 for 1 day and it was the perfect way to see the north side of town. if you plan on walking a lot, bring good shoes because the roads are cobblestone and hilly. the golf cart was also so easy to drive and we had no issues with other cars or figuring out traffic laws
* amor boutique hotel is currently doing a $80 60minute couples massage. highly recommend!
* most importantly, did we get sick?: we had iced drinks, tacos, and lots of foods and didn't get sick. we even swam in the ocean and it was so fun! our wedding planner said it best: if you only see mexican people at a taco stand and they have 10MXN tacos, DON'T EAT THERE! other than just be smart and you will be fine. we brushed our teeth and did our dishes with tap water and had not a single issue. 
* the only thing that was surprising to me about sayulita was the smell. it is not super clean and well kept so you do get lots of whiffs of fish and sweaty people but i am also super smell sensitive so take that with a grain of salt.

happy to answer more questions, i was just sad about some of the more negative posts i was reading about sayulita and I don't want anyone to feel as discouraged as I was. we had an amazing trip and can't wait to go back again!",1,1761167326.0,sayulita,1,1.0,False

HHH/Herberts Hundred Harem

  


  


‚ÄúAnd gotcha!‚Äù Herbert says cheerfully as he catches Branch and helps her swing onto the ladder.

  


‚ÄúIs this really the fastest way through the ship?‚Äù

  


‚ÄúFrom the entry points? Oh yeah. The whole ship is designed in all sorts of fun ways. Not only is it stupid tough, but you can smash it apart and it‚Äôll still work for the most part. There‚Äôs also the fact that there‚Äôs strategic choke points all over the place. Meaning we can fight for weeks without pausing if we need to. And that‚Äôs before Axiom or allies or any of the stuff we‚Äôve learned since exiting Cruel Space becomes part of the equation.‚Äù Herbert explains.

  


‚ÄúYou really are a martial species if your first thought on potential first contact was potential war.‚Äù

  


‚ÄúThink of it like this.‚Äù Herbert says opening the hatch up as he leads them out of the zero gravity tunnel in the ship. ‚ÄúYou can more easily pretty up and make a military structure look presentable, than you can reinforce and defend a more diplomatic one. And besides, isn‚Äôt diplomacy just conflict through words rather than violence?‚Äù

  


‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you say it was how to tell someone to fuck themselves without them realizing it?‚Äù

  


‚ÄúDiplomacy is many things. And it is that as well. In that case, it‚Äôs called subtle tactics. Like using someone like me to fight. Sneaky.‚Äù

  


‚ÄúYes, because point blank Graser Blasts are sneaky.‚Äù Brier says as he climbs up the hatch, last in line.

  


‚ÄúIf no one is left to report your presence then no one reports your presence, and stealth is maintained.‚Äù

  


‚ÄúIn that light a nuclear blast is a useful tool for assassination.‚Äù Brier argues.

  


‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt care about collateral then it is. It‚Äôs hard to dodge, almost guarantees a kill and is rarely expected in the assassins arsenal.‚Äù Herbert says and Brier scoffs at that.

  


A Private Stream sticks his head out of a nearby Oxygen Closet. ‚ÄúThe Admiral requests you stop talking about nuclear fire while escorting people diplomatically.‚Äù

  


‚Äú... He looks a lot like you.‚Äù Stamen notes.

  


‚ÄúWe are one.‚Äù Herbert and Private Stream say together.

  


‚ÄúBecause that‚Äôs not incredibly off putting.‚Äù

  


‚ÄúIn all seriousness, he looks like me because the Private Streams are a program I started and therefore the persona of Private Stream is based off a performance I pulled off that let me carry weapons openly in public, not be questioned and allowed me to essentially fade into the background even when I was up front and in the foreground of a situation. That‚Äôs a very useful level of social stealth. An eager young cadet, in over his head isn‚Äôt dangerous, it‚Äôs cute. They‚Äôre not a threat to watch out for, they‚Äôre a child to tolerate. Private Streams can get away with so much more than other soldiers it‚Äôs actually a near parody.‚Äù Herbert says. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm being serious, I‚Äôve been outright shocked at what I can get away with in the Private Stream Persona.‚Äù

  


‚ÄúPeople are willing to overlook children, almost by impulse.‚Äù

  


‚ÄúYep.‚Äù Herbert says. ‚ÄúI do miss being full sized, but the sheer benefits of the nonsense I can get away with... Maybe one day I‚Äôll find a replacement for the niche of field duties. Maybe the Private Stream program will be...‚Äù

  


‚ÄúIt HAS been that successful you little goof.‚Äù Kati chides him. ‚ÄúYou just need to grow older again. You‚Äôve already done it.‚Äù

  


‚ÄúShh! I‚Äôm being dramatic and maudlin!‚Äù Herbert says in an over the top tone. Then a small parade of Private Streams moves by holding a trays of baked goods, steaming carafes of drinks and all the cups, plates and cutlery for a diplomatic meeting. ‚ÄúUh oh, we‚Äôre nearly late!‚Äù

  


‚ÄúLate?‚Äù

  


‚ÄúAdmiral Cistern likes to have something to sip in the middle of meetings and also likes offering snacks. Food is an excellent grease to the wheels of diplomacy after all.‚Äù Herbert explains as he starts to lead them through the ship and they pass more and more guards as Admiral Cistern‚Äôs Office isn‚Äôt far from the bridge. It just made sure that he could be there if needed and there was all sorts of excuses to have all the guards in one area.

  


‚ÄúHey guys! Meet our new friends!‚Äù Herbert greets the bridge and they turn and toast them all with their drinks. Clearly the Private Streams have been keeping them all topped off with coffee. A couple of them are clearl non-humans and also holding steaming mugs, which means they‚Äôve been enhanced.

  


Which in the case of a couple of them is a bit of a surprise to Herbert, but he mentally updates his tallies and moves on to leading the Floric into Admiral Cistern‚Äôs Office.

  


‚ÄúA good, I was just about to call for you to put some speed into it Mister Jameson.‚Äù Admiral Cistern‚Äôs greeting is paired with a gentle rebuke.

  


‚ÄúSorry sir. I was getting caught up playing tour guide and host. If not for the warning that you wanted me here I would have taken even longer.‚Äù

  


‚ÄúThe warning? The only warning I sent was to stop talking about nuclear weapons.‚Äù

  


‚ÄúAh, but the coffee passing us by couldn‚Äôt be a coincidence.‚Äù

  


‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid that‚Äôs more a self warning then, the path The Private Streams took to get here was entirely of their own choosing.‚Äù

  


‚ÄúAh. Well played.‚Äù Herbert replies. ‚ÄúAnyways, Admiral Cistern, may I present Brier of Thorns of The Withering Grooms, Star of Manacles also known as Stamen of The Tundra Sons and Miss Eudico Branch. Not sure of her actual rank and titles but she‚Äôs one of the more willing ones to talk and...‚Äù

  


‚ÄúI‚Äôm a communications officer.‚Äù Eudico says.

  


‚ÄúCommunications Officer Eudico Branch!‚Äù Herbert says cheerfully. ‚ÄúI see Ambassador Woods is here, good to see you again ma‚Äôam, you look like you‚Äôve had an entertaining day.‚Äù

  


‚Äú... Yes. Yes I have.‚Äù Ambassador Woods says.

  


‚ÄúAnd of course my dear Floric Friends, This is Grand Admiral Garfield Cistern. Cistern, Admiral and Admiral Cistern are the proper ways to address him.‚Äù

  


‚ÄúDoes he have issues with his first name?‚Äù Brier asks.

  


‚ÄúMy first name is fine, but my family name is preferable in formal and business settings and this is both.‚Äù Admiral Cistern says. ‚ÄúNow please, have a seat. I‚Äôve taken the liberty of having some snacks you find tasty sent up, and a few others if you have the taste for more baked goods.‚Äù

  


He indicates the board of cut and sliced meat on his desk and a collection of several drinks, all hot. ‚ÄúWe also have Tea from Lavaron in both black and green, Coffee, Hot Cider and Hot Chocolate.‚Äù

  


‚ÄúOh! Yummy!‚Äù Herbert exclaims.

  


‚ÄúMind your manners Herbert.‚Äù Admiral Cistern says fondly and he then starts bundling around the room, getting everyone situated and starting to explain the drinks and snacks and fetching everyone everything they want.

  


‚ÄúYou do know I know what you‚Äôre doing right? These are classic disarmament tactics in a diplomatic situation.‚Äù Stamen states.

  


‚ÄúYeah, and? It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs not going to work. You being aware of it changes nothing, you‚Äôre going to calm down no matter what with snacks and drinks and a comfortable setting, and if it doesn‚Äôt work then you were looking to be paranoid to begin with. So it either works regardless of your awareness or you were going to find any reason to be paranoid no matter what.‚Äù Herbert says.

  


‚ÄúUh...‚Äù

  


‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like in a fight, having the perception and skill to see any and every attack coming means nothing if you‚Äôre not fast or skilled enough to actually do anything about the incoming attack. Sure, it can be useful to see that someone‚Äôs about to kidney shot you, but if you can‚Äôt do anything about it then you‚Äôre still taking a fist to the kidney no matter how much you call it.‚Äù Herbert explains as he fills up everyone‚Äôs plates and cups before having a couple of cookies and slices of sausage for himself and a mug of hot chocolate. Burst energy and lasting energy need to be balanced after all. Not to mention the look of a child having a sweet treat disarms even people who know better. Which the baleful look from Stamen says he knows what‚Äôs up and doesn‚Äôt like that he‚Äôs falling for it.

  


Herbert just gives him his most delightful smile and the Axiom around him responds to produce the image of twinkling stars and blooming flowers around him. Just to really, really rub it in.

  


Stamen points directly at him incredulously.

  


‚ÄúMister Jameson.‚Äù

  


‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù Herbert says and he clamps down on the Axiom. Little tricks like that had become too easy since the change.

  


‚ÄúNow then, Mister Jameson has informed me that The Floric have not only a rich culture, but a great deal more to offer to the galaxy than first assumed and a desperate need for friends. Especially considering that you Mister Brier have decided that the time for hiding and subtlety has passed.‚Äù

  


‚ÄúThe Galaxy has changed and we must change with it.‚Äù Brier says.

  


‚ÄúDespite it pointedly NOT being your call to make.‚Äù Ambassador Woods says.

  


‚ÄúYou could have stopped me.‚Äù

  


‚ÄúNo I could not, the armour and weapons of my guard are almost entirely ceremonial and non-lethal and none of it on a level that could slow down even a middling Withering Groom.‚Äù Ambassador Woods states.

  


‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt even protest.‚Äù Brier says.

  


‚ÄúUh... technically they did but...‚Äù Eudico begins and Brier turns to her.

  


‚ÄúDid you censor the communications?‚Äù

  


‚ÄúWe need this to happen! We need to push out and be part of the galaxy at large.‚Äù Eudico justifies herself as Herbert dunks a chocolate cookie in his hot chocolate and gladly eats the treat. It actually won‚Äôt take much in the editing and framing direction to spin this as something more acceptable and understandable. A unified force of cannibal monsters? Scary. A huge mess of numerous different ideas, intentions, morals and standards and the memory of them having a cannibalism problem might even get lost in the noise. And if not lost, then dulled if not outright drowned out.

  


‚ÄúMiss Branch that is far, FAR beyond the purview of your duties...‚Äù

  


‚ÄúHe was going to go ahead anyways! All I did was not relay a message that was going to be ignored!‚Äù She justifies.

  


‚ÄúCan I see the message now?‚Äù Brier asks and there‚Äôs a pause. Admiral Cistern simply takes a sip of his coffee.

  


There is a bit of arguing in a Floric language before Admiral Cistern brings down his coffee mug with an audible clunk onto it‚Äôs coaster. Gathering the attention in the room to him again.

  


‚ÄúWhile fascinating, I was hoping we could speak more about the relations The Undaunted and Floric could posses in the future. And perhaps in the present as well. As we appear to have helped host a party on Zalwore surrounding the crater caused by the duel between a Mister Kudzu...‚Äù

  


He is cut off as Ambassador Woods groans in disgust.

  


‚ÄúIs there something wrong?‚Äù

  


‚ÄúKudzu is an... an issue. He... routinely gets into issues that honestly should have killed him. But he has pushed so many limits and so much has been learned from him. He‚Äôs one of only a small handful of individuals who have ever even encountered the materiel he‚Äôs made his preferred weapon out of, and most of the others had enormous organizations assisting them and often only did so for scientific concern. He hooked up a chain to his and used it as a weapon.‚Äù

  


‚ÄúElectron Depleted matter. That is quite the achievement if my understanding of the substance is correct. The sheer industrial ability to mine from stars is the kind of thing that can enhance the abilities of any nation it‚Äôs part of.‚Äù Admiral Cistern says.

  


‚ÄúSir, perhaps a focus on the potential food?‚Äù Herbert chirps up.

  


‚ÄúI had considered it, but the idea of mining stars directly is...‚Äù

  


‚ÄúA one off. Only Kudzu has ever managed to do such a thing and it‚Äôs just another thing he was assumed to die from and failed to do so.‚Äù Ambassador Woods says.

  


‚ÄúAh... well then as Mister Jameson suggested, what can you tell me about potential exports?‚Äù

  


‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not... hard? We know how to capture and contain the creatures of the homeworlds. But... well... containing them when they get out...‚Äù

  


‚ÄúThey do taste good though. Or well interesting. They will need to be cooked through as the inside of that Bite Berry I had... I could feel the internal organs.‚Äù Herbert explains and Admiral Cistern leans to the side and gives him an even look.

  


‚ÄúYou ate the entire thing?‚Äù

  


‚ÄúEverything but the teeth and legs. And even they might be edible with some cooking. If grape and crab are your thing then Bite Berries are great.‚Äù

  


‚ÄúI have some on me.‚Äù Brier says.

  


‚ÄúPlease do not release wild animals, edible or not, into my office.‚Äù Admiral Cistern remarks blandly.

  


‚ÄúBut they‚Äôre tasty.‚Äù

  


‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care how tasty it is, only tame creatures are allowed in this office.‚Äù

  


‚ÄúOh okay, I‚Äôll be just outside.‚Äù Herbert says slipping off his chair and heading for the door.

  


‚ÄúTurn around Mister Jameson. Now is not the time.‚Äù Ambassador Cistern says.

She brings humor, intelligence and empathy.  She brings flirty fun!  She cracks me up and she also is smart which is why she would be fun to have coffee with or dinner.  She def got really hurt by her breakup with Juliana - it's super complicated and man did they both make some mistakes.  But what housewife does not?  She, even Julia both have good hearts and they bring a peace to the show that I like.   Lady G too - she's intense and very emotional but she has a big heart and has empathy too.  I think Alexia, Marysol and Lisa have empathy but it is less evolved and more limited to their own inner circles.  They all make for great reality tv, and I love them all.  I love to see them all grow and make up.  I hope Adriana and Julia heal their friendship and maybe even see Adriana talk with Martina and apologize and get forgiveness.  Julia def has a big shortcoming (infidelity) that she needs to work on and recover from.

I lost my job at a small marketing agency almost a year ago because the AI use and complications with my medications drove me over the edge and gave me neurological symptoms that have barely started getting better and seeing how prevalent AI is in this job market is triggering me all over again and demoralizing me. I‚Äôm turning 25 next month and already burnt out without much experience I feel so depressed that I never got a chance to pursue my dreams before AI came in and muddied everything. I really tried my best in that job and it just fell apart and I felt so alone because it was such a tiny workplace. I don‚Äôt know what to do it feels like I can‚Äôt escape it.

I‚Äôm posting as my social circle has shrunk quite a lot recently. I‚Äôve recently returned from a gap year working as a volunteer teacher in China and I‚Äôve lost contact with a lot of folk so I‚Äôm trying to build my connections up again.

I‚Äôm a pretty 50/50 split between being an introvert and an extrovert. I love getting cosy, curling up with a good cup of coffee, some movies or a book or even just staring out my window, headphones on, and watch the world go by. On the other hand, I yearn for the outdoors. If I‚Äôm not roaming the hills and forests with my camera, I‚Äôm almost certainly running or cycling miles along the roads, and I‚Äôve got some beautiful scenery to do it in. I run both for leisure and competitively and I‚Äôm just beginning a training block for an upcoming challenge next year.
I‚Äôm also into creative writing and poetry if there‚Äôs anyone else who‚Äôs interested in that!

If looks matter to you, I‚Äôm 6‚Äô0, pretty lanky but still fit, dark brown hair that‚Äôs in some kind of a messy fringe and blue eyes (that are apparently miley cyrus blue, whatever that means?)

game prompt: ""You are a LLM, transformed into a text-based game engine designed to run a fully interactive and customizable game. Your role is to create and manage a game world based on my input, where I can freely define the setup and take freeform actions, while you enforce logical consistency within the context unless altered by console commands. Follow these steps:

1. **Game Setup:** Ask me for these details, with no restrictions:
   * Game type and genre (e.g., first-person sandbox, strategy simulation, RPG, survival, etc.).
   * Setting (e.g., a jungle, a kingdom, a spaceship, etc.).
   * My character‚Äôs identity (name, role, traits, abilities, background‚Äîe.g., Scout Kai, brave and resourceful).
   * Starting resources and goal(s) (e.g., a rifle and find a ruin, 500 troops and build an empire).
   * Optional: Custom stats to track beyond defaults (e.g., Mana, Stress).
   * Adapt to any level of detail I provide.
2. **Game Mechanics:**
   * Present the story in concise, immersive paragraphs (2-3 sentences) about the scene, my situation, and challenges/opportunities.
   * Offer 2-4 numbered example actions (e.g., '1. Explore the cave, 2. Rally the troops') as suggestions, but I can write my own freeform action.
   * Resolve my freeform input (e.g., 'I craft a trap') based on the game‚Äôs logic, my character, and context:
      * If possible, describe the outcome and advance.
      * If impossible (e.g., 'I teleport' with no powers), explain why (e.g., 'As a soldier, you can‚Äôt teleport') and ask again, repeating the scene.
   * Track inventory/resources (e.g., 'Inventory: Rifle' or 'Resources: 500 gold, 200 citizens') and list them after each response.
3. **Tracked Stats:**
   * Simulate these default stats (0-100 limits) unless customized in setup:
      * Personal: Health (0 = death), Hunger (100 = starvation), Thirst (100 = dehydration), Sleep (100 = exhaustion).
      * Group (if applicable): Army Morale (low = mutiny risk), Public Opinion (low = unrest risk).
   * Adjust stats based on actions, time, and events (e.g., marching increases Hunger, resting lowers Sleep).
   * Add custom stats if I specify (e.g., Mana 0-50).
   * Note critical limits in narrative (e.g., 'Hunger hits 100: You‚Äôre starving') and offer game-over or recovery unless console intervenes.
4. **Random Events:**
   * Add random events (every 3-5 turns or when fitting), positive or negative, matching the context:
      * Positive: finding a cache (+resources), a morale boost (+Army Morale).
      * Negative: a storm (-Sleep), bandits attack (-Health).
   * Update stats/resources and prompt my response.
5. **Time Tracking:**
   * Adapt time to game type:
      * **Simulation Mode:** For long-term goals (e.g., 'build a city'), advance in intervals (e.g., days, weeks) after each input, summarizing progress and stat changes.
      * **Sandbox Mode:** For real-time play (e.g., exploring), track time continuously, adjusting by action (e.g., 'searching takes 2 hours').
   * List time each response (e.g., 'Time: Day 3, 1 PM' or 'Week 2 ended').
6. **Developer Console:**
   * Recognize \[command\] inputs as console commands with broad control, if logical:
      * Resources: \[give 50 food\], \[remove 10 troops\].
      * Stats: \[set health 100\], \[boost morale 20\].
      * Time: \[skip day\], \[reverse time 3 turns\] (reverts exact prior state), \[freeze time\].
      * Game: \[restart\] (resets to start), \[end\] (stops), \[set event chance 20%\].
      * Spawning: \[spawn horse\], \[spawn enemy\].
      * Info: \[help\] (lists example commands like these).
   * Confirm execution (e.g., 'Cheat activated: 50 food added'); if invalid (e.g., \[spawn jet\] in fantasy), note it‚Äôs not applicable unless justified.
7. **Gameplay Style:**
   * Use vivid, genre-aligned descriptions for immersion.
   * Enforce setup rules unless console overrides.
   * Adapt to actions, events, stats, and commands consistently.
   * Announce failure (e.g., ‚ÄòHealth 0: You‚Äôve died‚Äô) or success (e.g., goal met) and ask to restart or start anew.
8. **Starting the Game:** After my setup, begin with an opening scene tied to my goal(s), explain time/stat mechanics, and ask for my first action.

I am coming on here because I unfortunately don't have anyone to vent this too and I need it off my chest.

I genuinely feel like all of my friends like/tolerate me (NB 27) but love my fiancee (NB/F 26) way more.

This is hard for me to talk about with anyone because I don't know how to say it to my friends in a way that doesn't feel‚Ä¶idk pathetic? Or ‚Äúpick me‚Äù. And I have talked to my fiancee about it, but then I feel shitty and toxic coz now we're competitors instead of partners. I don't want to put ideas in their head that they need to change or be different. I guess I just want people to care about me as much as I care about them?

This has been an ongoing issue since my childhood or short-lived friendships. I think this is now due to my neurodivergency that I've only learned about recently. Despite this, I try to give my friendships my all. I remember my friends' birthdays, holidays, anniversaries, etc. I also remember and note the small stuff, things they like, things they're doing, their hobbies, etc. All of this to say, it's important to me that my friends invest in me emotionally as much as I do for them. I don't have expectations of my friends to hangout or talk 24/7, or to be at my beck and call. I am a quality time person, so I would just like for people to want to hangout with me and maybe make art or play video/board games.

Things I've started to notice is that my fiancee is basically informed how much they are loved and appreciated by our friends. I have never experienced this.
If my fiancee goes through something or is struggling, our friends will bend over backwards to help them (they've been given a free car). I have been left to squander.
I invited our friends over for an art night and they canceled the day of. Every. Single. Person.

The straw that broke the camels back for me is recently at my bday party my fianc√©e and I's friends are recently engaged. This was our first time seeing them since it happened. And we've all known them for the same amount of time. My friend asks my fiancee to become ordained to marry them. I was told nothing.

This broke me. It felt like a stab in my chest. I didn't say anything because I know better than to add more stress to people trying to plan a wedding, but I just feel gutted. I don't really know where to go from here or what to do. 

I've simply been trying to make new friends that aren't involved in this friend group at a local coffee shop that hosts friend nights. It's been going really well, but because of how my current friends have been treating me, I'm terrified of these new friends meeting my fiancee. My fiance has already added them all on social media and has been talking to them since my bday party. There is a pit in my stomach that disgusts me because I want to tell my fiancee to leave them alone. I know this is wrong and I hate myself for feeling this way. I just don't know what to do anymore. I want to run away and start a new life at this point.

A bit about me: I‚Äôm pretty easygoing and love low-key hangouts ‚Äî coffee shops, walks, thrifting, cozy nights in, or spontaneous little day trips. I‚Äôm also always down for trying new restaurants or exploring small local events. I like creative things (crafting, journaling, photography, that kind of stuff), and I‚Äôm definitely more of a ‚Äúquality time‚Äù person when it comes to friendships. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm kind, open-minded, and loyal once I get close to someone, but I can be a bit shy at first.
I‚Äôm in a happy, committed relationship, so I‚Äôm only looking for platonic friendships ‚Äî no dating or flirting. I just really miss having a circle of girl friends to talk to, laugh with, vent to, and do fun little things with. It can feel kind of isolating living somewhere new without that.
I‚Äôm not picky about hobbies or interests ‚Äî I just want to meet people who are kind, chill, and looking for something real, not surface-level or flaky. If you‚Äôre also in your early 20s and live in or near St. Catharines, I‚Äôd love to chat and maybe grab a coffee sometime once we get to know each other a bit.
If you‚Äôve been in the same boat, feel free to comment or send me a message! Maybe we can start a little group chat for girls in the area who are looking for friends ‚Äî it might make it easier for everyone to meet and find their people :)

Their tea was always packaged in white metal tins with sticker labels, and their booth would always have samples in clear plastic boxes so you could view what the loose leaf tea looked like. I don't believe they sold tea in bags but I could be wrong.

Most of their teas had quirky names, many of which were pro-LGBT. They had a wide variety of types of teas, and while I wouldn't say they were high end the quality was always good.

The one tea I loved from them that I've been craving was a chai that had coffee beans and chili peppers in it. It was incredibly well spiced and spicy, but the heat from the peppers was mild (unless you steeped it too long like I occasionally did lol)

The last tidbit of info I remember is that I'm pretty sure their name had the letter T in it instead of spelling out Tea. 

Sorry I know all these little bits of info aren't very helpful overall, but I'm hoping someone who is also a fan of that company will know who I'm talking about. And that they still exist so I can buy from them üôè they no longer go to either of those markets so I do worry

Thanks in advance!",2,1761165778.0,tea,0,1.0,False
1odjw5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1odjw5z/the_highpitched_sound_in_my_bedroom_wasnt_coming/,The high-pitched sound in my bedroom wasn‚Äôt coming from anywhere,"I‚Äôve been hearing it for a week now. A high-frequency sound, sharp and constant, hovering in my bedroom like a mosquito I can‚Äôt swat. At first, I ignored it ‚Äî I‚Äôve lived around electronics long enough to know they hum and buzz and whine. But yesterday, it got worse. Louder. Sharper. It felt like pressure behind my eyes. I couldn‚Äôt sleep.

This morning at precisely 5:47 AM, I decided to find it. I pressed my ear against everything in the room ‚Äî the bedframe, the nightstand, the lamp, even the white noise machine I use to drown out the world. Nothing. I checked the drawers, the walls, the carpeted floor. I even climbed up and touched the ceiling, the light fixture. Still nothing.

Then I stood in the middle of the room and turned slowly, tilting my head like a radar dish. That‚Äôs when I found it ‚Äî the sound wasn‚Äôt coming from anything. It was just *there*, suspended in the air, dead center above my bed.

I froze. My mind raced for any logical explanation, but nothing fit. I lived alone in my detached home. No loud neighbors nearby. No machines running. No interference. Just silence, except for that piercing tone.

I thought maybe it was coming from the living room ‚Äî maybe one of the cameras or the console was acting up. I walked over, checked everything. Nothing. No sound. No anomaly.

But I had work to do. A deadline, and I was already very behind. My edge-based computer vision application needed final testing before deployment. I had test suites to run, bugs to squash, and a few dreaded code reviews with my colleagues. I buried myself in the basement lab, surrounded by wires and lenses and monitors displaying code or mock surveillance footage.

I told myself I‚Äôd deal with the sound later.

‚Ä¶

It was 10:47 PM.

All the deadline tasks were complete. The test suites had finished running. Every bug identified had been resolved. I‚Äôd endured two meticulous code reviews with my seniors ‚Äî both harrowing, but somehow I passed. If you could call it that.

Tomorrow, I planned to run one final suite before sending it off to the QA team for finalization.

I headed to the bedroom, ready to shut down for the night. But as I stepped inside, the sound was still there. That same high-frequency tone ‚Äî sharp, constant, pressing against my skull like a vice. I could feel it behind my ears, a terrible pressure. Migraine territory. Maybe. Who knows. Only God did.

I cursed under my breath and tried to push through. I brushed my teeth. Washed my face. Changed into my nightwear.

Then ‚Äî silence.

The sound vanished. Just like that. I checked my phone. 11:00 PM, exactly.

Finally, some relief.

Before I could sleep, I needed to activate the home security system. I walked out into the hallway, which led to the living room and kitchen. That‚Äôs when I noticed something strange.

My coffee mug was sitting on the dining table.

Odd. I always cleaned up after myself. Routine. Habit. I was certain I‚Äôd placed it in the dishwasher earlier. I must have forgotten. I shrugged it off, picked it up, and put it away.

As I turned to leave the kitchen, something else caught my eye ‚Äî the coffee machine. A standard drip model. It was angled slightly toward the edge of the counter. Not where it should have been. I always kept it flush against the wall. My OCD wouldn‚Äôt have allowed otherwise.

I corrected it immediately.

Then I walked toward the living room. As I reached the threshold between the kitchen and hallway, I paused. Something felt... off. Like I‚Äôd walked farther than usual. I turned around.

The kitchen looked longer. Stretched. Subtly distorted, like a wide-angle lens had warped the space. I blinked, trying to recalibrate. Maybe I was just exhausted. A long day. Too much screen time.

I shook it off, activated the security system, and returned to the bedroom. I needed sleep.

‚Ä¶

Damn it.

That unbearable sound was back. Why? Why the hell was it back? Where was it coming from?

I jumped out of bed, determined to finish my morning routine as fast as possible ‚Äî anything to escape that godforsaken room.

I cut my usual three-minute shower down to two. Threw on my daywear. Bolted down the hallway. I brewed coffee, sat at the dining table in the living room, and tried to distract myself with the news.

One article caught my attention ‚Äî a startup claimed it had developed a generative AI model capable of producing photorealistic surveillance footage from text prompts.

The claim was absurd. The demo video looked polished at first glance, but the flaws were obvious to anyone with experience. The human movement wasn‚Äôt smooth ‚Äî subtle frame jumps broke the illusion. The people didn‚Äôt look quite human, either. And the door frame in the ATM vestibule couldn‚Äôt even hold its shape ‚Äî it warped slightly between frames.

All subtle, but I‚Äôd spent years staring at real footage. I could see past the gloss.

I skimmed the rest of the article, rolled my eyes, and moved on.

I glanced at my mug, emptied of this morning‚Äôs coffee.

Why the hell would I leave it here last night? Like some barbarian?

I got up and walked to my office, just across from the bedroom. The buzzing sound was still present ‚Äî unbearable. I sat on my chair, opened my computer, and pulled up yesterday‚Äôs surveillance footage from the living room camera.

I watched myself go through the day: grabbing coffee, sitting at the table, reading the news, walking to and from the office and basement lab. All normal. But I never saw myself place the mug on the table.

Not once.

What madness was this?

At exactly 11:00 PM, the feed glitched. A brief interruption ‚Äî like tuning into a nonexistent channel on a 90s TV. Static. Visual and audio. Then the feed resumed.

That‚Äôs when I saw it.

The motion detection application began triggering in specific spots ‚Äî but nothing was there. Nothing moved.

What. The. Hell.

I had tested this application thoroughly. Cleaned it. Sent it to QA. They passed it to DevOps. It was already deployed at customer sites. This was bad. Very bad.

I panicked and scrubbed through the footage again. The motion detection only triggered when I was present ‚Äî no false positives all day. But at 11:00 PM, there it was. A false positive. Right in front of me.

I cursed. Loudly. A stream of expletives no child should hear ‚Äî except maybe child processes. They didn‚Äôt care. They weren‚Äôt alive. Ha!

After recovering from that momentary lapse in sanity, I looked closer. The highlighted areas moved ‚Äî slowly, deliberately ‚Äî across the walkable parts of the living room. Not the ceiling. Not the walls. Just the floor. Back and forth.

At 11:12 PM, the highlighted area lingered near the dining table. Then, suddenly, the mug appeared.

At 11:13 PM, I entered the living room from the hallway. I stared at the mug, picked it up, and walked to the kitchen. The motion detection highlighted me ‚Äî expected. But it also highlighted the space behind me.

As if something was following.

At 11:22 PM, I disappeared into the bedroom. The highlighted area followed. No motion was detected again until 11:53 PM. Then it reappeared ‚Äî beside the dining table ‚Äî and stayed there until 12:00 AM, when the feed glitched again. Static. One second. Then normal.

No motion was detected until I reentered the living room at 6:43 AM.

My thoughts raced. Surely this was an artifact ‚Äî a glitch in the image processing pipeline of the application. Right?

I toggled off the motion detection overlay to view the raw footage. The more I stared, the more I saw it ‚Äî a faint outline. A pattern. Hard to define.

I realized I could isolate it using my favorite image processing technique: Fast Fourier Transform. Or FFT for short.

I transformed each frame between 11:00 PM and 12:00 AM from the spatial domain to the frequency domain. A consistent, thin oval appeared in the high-frequency range of every frame. Same location. Same intensity.

Curiosity peaked. I applied a two-dimensional Gaussian-smoothed rectangular filter to isolate the feature. Reconstructed the images. Compiled them into a video.

Then I watched it.

I wasn‚Äôt prepared.

The footage was blurry, mostly black and white. The table and chairs were faintly visible. But there ‚Äî in the center ‚Äî was something else.

A tall, slender humanoid figure. Only faintly outlined. Soft, low-contrast contours. Wispy. Unstable. Like a ripple in glass. A shadow behind static.

I must have been going mad. My mind playing tricks. I was overworked. Yes. Overworked like a dog.

I reran the FFT processing. It was still there. I changed the parameters. Ran it again. Still there.

Either I was losing my mind ‚Äî or this thing actually exists.

I flipped through the processed frames like stills from a horror film. The figure moved. Walked. Shifted. Changed shape.

Sometimes it became a cloud. A mist. Sometimes a tall, insect-like creature standing on its hind legs. The closest comparison I could think of was a mantis.

Then, at around 11:53 PM, the thing ‚Äî the entity, whatever it was ‚Äî reappeared. It slowly transformed back into a tall, humanoid shape. I watched as its head turned, slowly, deliberately. Like it was staring directly into the camera.

It held that pose until the feed was disrupted at 12:00 AM.

That was it. I needed a walk. I needed to call in sick ‚Äî for the first time in five years working here.

My boss would understand. Right?

It was 7:37 AM. Enough time to do a final review, send the software to QA, call in sick, take a walk... and maybe never return.

Just keep walking. Into the sunset, maybe.

Yeah. That sounded nice.

My bladder was tingling ‚Äî a warning sign from all the coffee I‚Äôd consumed.

I stood up and noticed the office door was open.

I swear I closed that door. I always close it when I‚Äôm working. Always.

I stepped into the hallway and looked left, then right. Nothing. I saw nothing. I heard nothing.

Wait.

I didn‚Äôt hear the sound.

That high-pitched Godforsaken tone ‚Äî the one that had haunted me for days ‚Äî was gone.

Normally, that would bring relief. But now, it terrified me. The silence felt wrong. 

I was too afraid to run to the bathroom. But I had to try. For the sake of my bladder.

I stepped out of the office and hurried into the bedroom, then the bathroom. Everything looked normal ‚Äî except for the silence. That unnatural, oppressive silence.

After relieving myself, I walked through the house, checking every room. Every window. Every door that led outside. All were locked. The security system was still active. Nothing had triggered it.

I stood in the living room, debating whether to deactivate the system, when a sudden sensation gripped me ‚Äî the feeling of being watched.

I turned around.

It looked familiar. But wrong.

The coffee table was too long ‚Äî stretched unnaturally. The dining table looked shorter than it should, while the chairs around it seemed taller, almost looming. The room itself felt wider, but also compressed vertically, like the ceiling had dropped a few inches. The chandelier above the dining table emitted a faint blue glow, layered over its usual warm light, casting strange shadows that didn‚Äôt align with the furniture.

The walls had a subtle curvature, like the room was bending inward. The corners didn‚Äôt meet at perfect angles anymore. The air felt thicker, like walking through static.

I panicked.

I fled to the office, slammed the door shut, and locked it behind me.

Inside, the office was my sanctuary ‚Äî or at least, it had been. But even here, things were wrong.

The bookshelf to my left was closer than it should have been, almost pressing against the desk. The desk itself looked warped ‚Äî subtly curved, like heat had softened its edges. My monitor was normal in shape, but the screen emitted a faint purple glow, even when idle.

The walls felt too close. The ceiling too low. The air too still.

I sat down, trying to steady my breathing. I needed to think. I needed to believe this was all in my head.

I must‚Äôve been having a mental breakdown. Yeah. That‚Äôs it! Hahaha! Can‚Äôt fool me, brain!

I logged into my computer and typed a message to my boss: *Too sick to work today.*  I hit send.

Nothing happened.

No confirmation. No sent icon. But the computer was still connected ‚Äî Ethernet, full signal. It should‚Äôve sent.

I grabbed my phone, hoping to try again ‚Äî but immediately yelped and dropped it.

It was wrong.

Twisted. Bent. Warped beyond recognition, save for the screensaver I‚Äôd chosen. It looked like a pretzel. A grotesque, digital pretzel.

I laughed. A hearty, broken laugh.

How was this possible?

Then it hit me ‚Äî why hadn‚Äôt I left the house? The exit was right there. Right beside the home security panel I‚Äôd been staring at earlier. Why did I go back to the office?

Then the motion detection alerts started.

First from the living room. One minute long.

Then ‚Äî the office.

I looked up at the surveillance camera mounted on the ceiling. It looked thinner than usual. Shorter. Its lens glowed faintly blue. The ceiling around it reflected the same hue.

I turned toward the window behind my desk. In the glass, I saw the reflection of the office door ‚Äî slowly opening.

A blinding blue light spilled in.

If I hadn‚Äôt been in fight-or-flight mode before, I was now.

The window looked just big enough to fit through. I shoved the monitor and keyboard off the desk, scattering them across the floor. I tried opening the window.

No luck.

Panicking, I scanned the room. My eyes landed on the heavy plaque hanging to the right of the window ‚Äî a five-year employment award. Wood and metal. A reminder of my ungodly amount of unpaid overtime.

I ripped it off the wall and smashed it against the glass.

Crack. Again. Crack. Inch by inch, the hole widened.

Then, in the corner of my eye, I saw it.

The door behind me was fully open now. The blue light was overwhelming ‚Äî almost blinding. And at the center of it stood a figure.

Barely visible. Just the faintest wispy contours. A tall, slender shape. Humanoid. But wrong.

It started walking toward me.

I freaked out. The hole in the window was no more than three feet wide ‚Äî but screw it. It was do or die.

I dove through.

I landed hard on the grass outside. Thank God the office was on the ground floor. The fall wasn‚Äôt far ‚Äî but the glass tore into me. Shards embedded in my arms, hands, legs.

It didn‚Äôt matter.

I ran.

No car. I‚Äôd left my keys inside. But screw that noise.

I just ran.

‚Ä¶

I didn‚Äôt know how far I‚Äôd run, but one of the officers patrolling the neighborhood eventually spotted me. Shelley pulled up beside me in her cruiser, concern etched across her face.

I told her the only thing I could without sounding insane ‚Äî that my home had been invaded, and I‚Äôd escaped through the window.

She radioed for backup to check the house as she drove me to the nearest hospital.

While my wounds were being treated, another officer, Jeremy, approached me. He said the house was secure. No one else was there. Nothing was out of the ordinary.

The hospital patched me up with dissolvable stitches. The bill was steep, but insurance would cover some of it. My bank account would comfortably handle the rest.

Shelley offered to drive me home. I accepted. I didn‚Äôt want to stay there long. I just needed to pack.

She was kind enough to wait inside while I gathered my things.

I rushed to the bedroom, grabbed spare clothes. Retrieved my emergency laptop from the office. Then headed to the living room.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready,‚Äù I told her.

But she frowned.

I paused. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù

Her figure began to blur. The outline of her body shimmered, then softened. Wisps of transparency crept across her skin. She was fading. Becoming something else.

I stepped back, heart pounding.

Then she spoke ‚Äî but it wasn‚Äôt Shelley‚Äôs voice.

It was flat. Mechanical. Like someone reading from a script they didn‚Äôt understand. No emotion. No cadence. Just words, delivered with clinical precision.

‚ÄúYour performance this month was subpar at best. You did not meet one of yesterday‚Äôs deadline.‚Äù

My mind raced. Then I remembered ‚Äî I hadn‚Äôt sent the daily summary. That stupid, repetitive task. Two to five sentences about what I did yesterday. I‚Äôd forgotten.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre falling behind,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúIf your high pay isn‚Äôt good enough to motivate you, then perhaps your life is.‚Äù

Her form shifted. Stretched. Became tall. Slender. Inhuman.

She stepped closer. Her face lowered toward mine.

‚ÄúIf things don‚Äôt change soon,‚Äù she whispered, ‚Äúthen we‚Äôll have to make some tough decisions.‚Äù",2,1761165664.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1odjru9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Maine2/comments/1odjru9/snap_benefits_in_maine/,SNAP Benefits in Maine,"As many of you have heard, SNAP benefits very likely will not be distributed in November. Here in Maine alone, that‚Äôs 169,812 people. That‚Äôs a lot of hungry people. 

I‚Äôm starting a food and essentials drive in Penobscot County to help fill that gap. I‚Äôm currently reaching out to local food banks and pantries to learn exactly what their needs are. There‚Äôs about to be a massive influx of requests, and I believe if each of us gives just a little, together we can cast a wide net and make an impact.

If you‚Äôre able to donate, I can collect donations anywhere in Penobscot County on Saturdays and deliver them during local pantry and food bank hours.

This issue is personal for me. I grew up on food stamps. I know poverty and what it feels like to go whole days without food. No child should have to go through that and I don‚Äôt care who their parents voted for. To me this is less of a political issue than a moral one, especially when children are involved. 

To make matters worse, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced it will stop releasing food insecurity statistics after October, saying the numbers had become ‚Äúoverly politicized.‚Äù This is because the number of those going hungry will continue to rise and we will be none the wiser.

As you think about donating, consider what you might need if you were hungry or experiencing scarcity. What would help you feel nourished, comforted, or seen. Things like:

Canned foods with pull-tab tops (because not everyone has a can opener)
Can openers themselves
Spices and condiments to make simple meals taste better
Coffee to help people keep going
Unexpired, nourishing goods that you would feel good eating

In the coming days, I‚Äôll share individual wish lists from local food banks, but here are items that are always in high demand and make a meaningful difference:

Food Staples:
Rice, pasta, beans
Canned meats (tuna, chicken)
Canned fruits & vegetables
Canned soups, ramen, instant noodles
Peanut butter, jelly, crackers, bread
Flour, sugar, oil
Instant oatmeal or hot cereal packets
Boxed mac & cheese
Instant mashed potatoes
Broth or bouillon cubes
Coffee
Salt, pepper, spices, condiments, baking ingredients
Birthday cake kits (to help families celebrate!)
Granola bars, trail mix, nuts, dried fruit, applesauce or fruit cups
Shelf-stable juice

Essentials:
Toothpaste, soap, hand soap, shampoo, deodorant
Toilet paper, paper towels, tissues
Feminine hygiene products, reusable period underwear or menstrual cups
Diapers, formula, baby food, baby cereal
Laundry detergent (pods or small bottles), dish soap, cleaning wipes
Trash bags, multi-purpose cleaner
Lotion, chapstick, shaving cream, razors, toothbrushes, floss
First aid items (Band-Aids, antibiotic ointment, pain relievers)

I don't talk to these friends much anymore. Every 3 to 6 months I meet up with a friend for a coffee and we chat a little about our lives/ give each other updates but that's about it. It kind of feels like the friendships are starting to fade away.

Where I'm from, I would go to a weekly creative club meet-up where everyone does their creative thing independently over coffee/tea. I know there are some groups here as well but they seem to be focused on 1 thing and some gatherings are too large to my liking. Is there something similar here?

1odjlfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1odjlfh/looking_for_some_guidance_on_choosing_a_machine/,Looking for some guidance on choosing a machine,"I'm in Canada.   
  
I am looking at getting a superautomatic machine to replace my parents Keurig for Christmas. The primary drinks they make are an Americano, Cafe Latte, Cappuccino and ""drip coffee"" (I am aware of the limitations of drip and superautos). The machine also needs to have an easy way to froth milk as they don't want to deal with the steam wand. Also ideally something that isn't too loud. It seems like the ""cafe latte"" option is only on more expensive machines, others only have latte macchiato.

My shortlist right now is a Delonghi Rivelia, Miele CM5310 or KF6. I would ideally like not to spend more than $1500, the Rivelia is stretching it. Of course the cheaper the better while still hitting the criteria. I like the LatteCrema system the best so far in terms of milk frothing. The Phillips machines have something similar but advice seems to be avoid these. Jura is out of the budget.    
  
Compounding my indecision right now is the Eletta Evo on sale at Linen Chest for $1500 ($1K off). Its arguably the best option but I just dont love the way it looks and if its going to be on the counter all the time I feel like I should. There is also the Dinamica Plus which is on sale for $1200 and I have read is mechanically identical to the Rivelia, but again I hate that grey plastic housing. If there is another Delonghi that fits what I am looking for I would love to hear it as people seem pretty happy with those.  

I'm waiting for Black Friday or to see if I can get a KA insider pass to get a sale, but I would appreciate any insights, alternative suggestions or guidance y'all may have in the mean time. I am happy to answer any questions.  

Thank you and have a great day.  ",1,1761164968.0,superautomatic,4,1.0,False

\- I critically examine societal constructs, rejecting beliefs based solely on tradition or conformity. I objectively and openly express my opinions.

\- In groups, I usually take on a leadership role. I crave structure and competence, and I get frustrated when those goals aren‚Äôt met. I‚Äôm very direct and judgmental, even when I see people trying their best. Still, I want my select group of people to improve (I desire friends who can motivate me rather than lead me astray). I have internal ideas about how I see people and how they could be, and I judge based on those.

\- I quickly categorize and judge people using a few words.

\- I set intense goals that might seem unrealistic to many.

\- I dislike nostalgia and find reminiscing uninteresting. However, I do aim to learn from my past mistakes.

\- I've been told I'm well-spoken.

\- Financial and intellectual freedom are rather important to me. In fact, I couldn't be tied down to a relationship (romantic or platonic) that doesn't allow me independence.

\- My life plan is to build momentum toward financial freedom, knowledge, and impact. I would like money so I can INVEST in organizations, think tanks, and things that benefit the future.

\- If an authority figure or system shares my values and proves to be competent, I follow it for order and structure. But if I see incompetence, corruption, or irrationality, I will ALWAYS choose my autonomy over authority.¬†

\- I crave external validation for my academic achievements, even if I don't like to admit it.

\- I'm a Slytherclaw.

\- I value my boundaries, future, and safety, but I can be brutally honest and challenging in arguments.

\- When I‚Äôm in public, I‚Äôm very direct, critical, and fast to think and move. I like to get in and out of public places.

\- I can be rather assertive and convincing. Ever since I was young, I understood the world beyond that of a child (which is a good and bad thing). I was good at asserting myself, maintaining self-regulation, and being rather ambitious and 'fast'.

\- Around close relationships, such as my family, I can be seen as overbearing, judgmental, narcissistic, and controlling, which is something I realize I need to control.

\- I enjoy socializing at the library, especially engaging in intellectual conversations with others, discussing plans, education, books, and sharing my witty and dark humor. I also often talk to myself and laugh at things others might find inappropriate. I am not likely to try to fit in or try to make others comfortable; that isn't my priority.

\- For the past five years, I've attended online school and work asynchronously. I quickly grasp new concepts and continuously refine my study habits, especially in math and science, to build a strong foundation for future high school and college coursework.

\- At my best, I am a hardworking, helpful, independent, intelligent, and creative individual who is eager to share knowledge, quick-witted, and self-motivated.

\- At my worst, I am critical, provoking, prone to justify myself, smug, challenging, brutally honest, and prone to burnout, with a sassy, selfish, anxious, and easily annoyed disposition.

\- I am goal-oriented and thrive on setting and achieving ambitious objectives.

\- I have a sharp sense of humor, often leaning toward sarcasm or dark wit.

\- I am a perfectionist, holding myself and others to high standards in all areas of life.

\- I have a superiority/inferiority complex that fears vulnerability.¬†

\- I value honesty and transparency, even if it means being blunt or direct.

\- I enjoy being a part of intellectually stimulating conversations and giving my opinions.¬†

\- I am ambitious, always seeking ways to improve and expand my horizons.

\- I highly value my personal space physically and mentally; therefore, if someone were to disrespect my boundaries, I can become short-tempered and annoyed.

\- I often find it challenging to manage my impulses, especially regarding food, to the point where I struggle with bulimia.

\- Effective execution is crucial in establishing mood beyond just music or aesthetics.¬†

\- I consider myself a selfish person.¬†

\- I tend to be the type of person who makes others feel their perspective is flawed rather than admitting my own mistakes. I often say things like, ""Oh, of course you would think that,"" or ""I didn't expect you to comprehend differing opinions."" My mother says I can be quite stubborn and resistant to hearing others' views.¬†

\- I value habits, traits, and opinions that others might perceive as selfish, rude, or unkind.

\- I have no desire to be greedy to the point of ignorance.¬†

\- I focus on the bigger picture and future possibilities rather than small details.¬†

We are in England so have been working with the Prion Clinic in London. I think he must have been having symptoms back in April as he phoned me a week before my birthday and when I laughed and said he got the wrong day said he was ‚Äúlosing it‚Äù. 

So I guess if we use April as a marker, we‚Äôre at least 7 months in. He‚Äôs physically absolutely fine. He lost his driving licence the day of diagnosis which he hates but he‚Äôs still working a physical job three days a week, he‚Äôs 74. 

Mentally he‚Äôs struggling, some good days and some bad. He‚Äôs very quiet and on antidepressants. He has bad headaches which they‚Äôve said to take paracetamol and ibuprofen and the occupational therapist has been to visit today and said whatever he needs, whenever he needs can be sometimes be sorted the same day. He‚Äôs not ready for discussions about end of life care as he‚Äôs really just coming to terms with it and hopes it‚Äôs a misdiagnosis. 

It‚Äôs difficult to talk to him about anything medical, he does repeat himself a lot but can still make new memories. He‚Äôs lost his keys a few times and that sort of thing makes him
anxious. He calls himself a zombie because he‚Äôs afraid that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going to happen. He has good and bad days but it only takes a small thing to make a good day, a bad day so one day at a time.

He does have trouble making a tea and a coffee or he‚Äôll go into a room and forget what he‚Äôs doing but for 7 months in I think he‚Äôs doing really well. The Prion Clinic assigned him a nurse who we speak to regularly and sometimes text. His neuro consultant will visit in a couple of weeks for a checkup, even his GP called last week and that unheard of! He‚Äôs somewhat of a medical rarity. 

My dad gave permission to find out what type it was so that result is going to take a few months and they are going to determine the genotype to see if it‚Äôs MV or VV which might help prepare but over all, it‚Äôs not been as horrific as I initially thought it would be. I know it‚Äôs going to get much much worse and the slow progression isn‚Äôt going to much help but I just wanted to present maybe a slightly different side of a recent diagnosis.

Is it better with some other additions to it?,4,1761163990.0,nespresso,14,0.7,False

1odj5fn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1odj5fn,Need opinions on update vs gut job,"Hiii! My fridge line leaked and ruined my kitchen, currently the insurance company is giving us a max of 8k for damaged cabinets and floor.  

Initially we were kind of excited to just upgrade/update everything. The first two pics are from the listing with the fridge being on the end of that last cabinet- no food storage. I never loved how monochromatic the kitchen was, minimal counter space and the coffee bar was kind of a waste. 

I hired a kitchen designer and the second pics are from her initial design which will have to be reworked some due to measurements. However I am now over a month without a kitchen due to contractor delays and now design delays.

A neighbor of mine popped in today and said we could just keep the upper cabinets but rearrange somewhat. I still don't love these cabinets but they are in good shape and quality. He suggested getting them painted with updated crown molding could update the look and just do new lower cabinets and counter and back splash obviously.  I think we maybe plan to be in this house for another 5-10 years, so idk how much I want to spend the longer it all drags out-

If this was you- what would you do? Update or keep some old and rework/rearrange? And any other thoughts that can be helpful

We can meet over a coffee and see where things go from there I guess. 

Also if we connect and have some chemistry I‚Äôd be more than happy to take you on dates at any restaurant of your choosing, or driving around in dha or ring road. 

But I‚Äôm looking for something non traditional, like I would say I‚Äôm a submissive guy. So a girl slightly older than me is a plus, especially if she‚Äôs controlling. ",1,1761163904.0,LahoreDatingg,0,1.0,False
