I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.

1. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

1. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

1. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.

* Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

1. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

1. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

1njktqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1njktqi/tilt_pro_accuracy_question_double_batch_different/,"Tilt Pro accuracy question - double batch, different OG","Howdy all,

So I brewed a double batch yesterday, just scoped a 5 gal recipe to 10 gals and once wort was chilled, transferred to two corny kegs to get rolling on pressurized fermentation.

Both kegs had all the same treatment (cold brew coffee and toasted coconut flakes in the bottom), then transferred wort, then oxygenated both 30 seconds, then pitched yeast, then dropped in a Tilt Pro in each one.

Capped up, put spunding valves on, then reset my Tilt loggings on both devices (one black, one blue) and linked to batches in Brewfather.

First loggings I was expecting to see the same OG values, and expect some slight initial turbulence while it settles. But I had one at 1.078 and the other at 1.069. Kind of seems a big variance to me.

Almost 24 hours in I see them both at the same ABV so far, 4.5%. 

Wondering if one or both are just not calibrated or they are at least not having the same calibration perhaps?",1,1758132889.0,Homebrewing,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone! I work in a small branch office for a larger company and today I am the only one in the office. I work in data analytics so it isn't like people come into my office to talk to me often. Coffee isn't working well enough today, so I am here to see if anyone wants to chat to help me keep awake. I live close to a National Park so I do a lot of hiking and that stuff. I like mountain biking and running, learning to program better, and if I can't go outside and don't feel like messing with python, I do some games. I am pretty chill and can talk about a anything really. Let me know if you want to chat. I would appreciate the distraction! ",1,1758132874.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

\--------------------

Vas no longer felt like safe haven, not after what a tenday of travel through its back roads had revealed to Mertle.

Three destroyed villages dotted the hills of Vas’s western shore. They had found signs of passage, of many feet trampling the ground among the destroyed homesteads, but those got lost soon into the ever thickening forests.

No corpses, no beetles aside from desiccated shells, and no signs of the priest that had survived Falor’s attack. The absence of proof had only served to deepen the unease.

Dread lingered. In every silence, behind every crumbling wall, in the shade of every tree and the rustle of every bush. Mertle felt it like settling snow, heavier by the day, colder, impossible to ignore.

Something hid in the forest, and it was terrible.

To top things off, Deidra had disappeared entirely. Her promise of handling Mertle’s retreat from the prince’s retinue—not that Mertle wanted to follow up on Deidra’s plan anymore—never came to pass. Had the night weaver been visited by the Dryad and warned off? Or had she changed her mind?

Thing were happening, set to change the face of humanity’s realm, and Mertle felt caught in one of these riptides. Though if she were headed for the rocks, or out to sea, she wasn’t yet sure.

Falor had marched them relentlessly after the fourth village they’d found destroyed. Whatever semblance of good humour he’d held before was now gone, the prince fully retreated into himself, only barely communicating with his men or Quistis. The mood around each campsite was sour and sullen, filled with whispered, cutting remarks that never developed into conversations of any kind.

If she chose to leave, she wondered if Falor would really allow them to head out on their own. Or at all. The suspicion she’d felt from him in the early days was still there, buried beneath more immediate concerns. But it wasn’t just once that she’d felt his interest on her, like the electric feeling just before being struck by lightning.

“I think we’re getting near,” Mertle said to Tummy as they settled for the night. “He’s been even quieter than usual today.”

“Aye,” Tummy said.

He sat propped against a tree, wrapped in a blanket. More for fear of rain than cold. The nights had been getting progressively warmer, the heat of thaw barely kept in check by their progress north-west, towards the mountains and the edge of Vas. The smith wore a beard now, not having bothered to shave in the days since the first village.

Mertle shook herself as she realised how they’d come to think of that fateful event: the *first* village. Now they knew of four in total that had suffered the same fate. Only the gods could count all the others that lay scattered among the high hills and through the thick fir forests. Thousands of people could be dead.

Or worse.

“There’s the taste of salt on the breeze,” she said, more to occupy her mind rather than make conversation. “We’re getting closer to the edge.”

“Aye,” Tummy rumbled again, refusing to be drawn out. Like her, he worried of what was to come.

He’d seen villages purged by the aelir, way back in what felt like a different life altogether. They’d done it for myriad reasons: imagined slights, disease, failure to meet quota. She and Tummy had passed through places like these before, seen the empty home, smelled death on the breeze.

The deeper they dwelt into this mystery, the closer the spirits of home loomed, a history neither of them had ever really forgotten. Just buried. In a box. Beneath their forge.

The box lay open. Mertle wore its content beneath her travel clothes, loathe to part with them anymore. The knife hung on her belt, constantly thrumming now, a sure sign the commander’s nerves were on edge.

Quistis wandered away from the small fire and came by them. Falor lay on his side, back to the embers, seemingly asleep, with Barlo several paces away, the same. Vial and Quistis had the first watch of the night.

“You should rest,” the healer said. “We’re going to keep shorter watches. Four per night. Better for all of us.” Her voice was terse, tired, with undertones of worry.

Mertle looked past, at the resting figures, then up at Quistis. “He’s scared?” she asked, as quiet as she could.

Quistis shook her head minutely. “Angry. Worst than I’ve ever seen him.”

For the moment, Mertle wished she’d shared her sign language with the woman. It would’ve made conversing far easier without the fear of being overheard.

“Are we close, then?” she asked.

What she really wanted to know was how this all affected the plans, but doubted Quistis knew anything more than they did.

“Tomorrow we’ll reach the prison, yes.” Quistis lowered herself on her haunches, staff laid across her thighs. “We will see if Cinder lied or not. I… don’t know what happens afterwards. We’ve discovered plenty to occupy us for a good, long while.”

Her voice had dropped to a whisper, so Mertle matched it. Falor hadn’t told them of their destination, not in actual. Mertle and Tummy had followed under the pretence of safety in numbers, worried of what the road could hold if they split from the Storm Guard cell.

“What then?” Mertle asked. “What do we do? How do we help Sil?”

Quistis shook her head again. There were heavy bags under her eyes, and those looked like they’d get even worse come the morrow. Shorter watches meant she’d be on watch at dusk and at dawn, her rest little to none.

“I have no idea what’s next. I don’t think Falor knows either.” She sighed heavily. “If Cinder spoke truth, then he’ll probably want to talk to the empress of what we find. We’ll head to Aztroa, most likely, or try and pick up the trail of that plague priest.” She shrugged. “I just don’t know. He’s not talking to me.”

“Want I take first watch?” Mertle asked. “You look wrung out.”

They all were. Always on the edge. Always listening, watching, feeling for danger. Nothing ever came at them, not even the wild animals of the forest, but they couldn’t simply ignore the threat. All of them had seen what those monsters could do, how dangerous they could be. It made carelessness hard to enact.

Quistis didn’t answer and, instead, rose and headed back to the fire.

“Well, that was enlightening,” Tummy said. He rapped a knuckle on the tree to draw her attention.

“Escape?” his fingers signed.

“No,” Mertle signed back. “Follow through. Learn. Wait. Watch. Not enough information.”

“Aye,” he signed back. “Stupid risk. You’re holding out on me.”

Mertle felt her heart rise in her throat. She hadn’t had a chance to explain the Dryad’s visit, but Tummy had felt it on her regardless.

She signed, “I’m sorry. Had no time.”

“Understood. Problem?”

“Maybe. Don’t know. No information.”

That was the crux of it. She had set out to head to Aztroa to take Tallah’s place as the wayward Aieni heiress, become part of the Storm Guard and hold suspicion off until the sorceress reemerged. It was all a gambit against the empress, one that had been set in motion by Deidra, Quistis, and Aliana. Of all those, only Deidra seemed to have any idea of what was happening now, and she’d gone into the wind, leaving them all adrift.

Mertle wondered at the coincidence of events. The visit she’d received from the Dryad, secretive and quiet, hadn’t shed any light, but had promised Sil and the rest would emerge soon.

But where? How? And why?

She had no answers, just the goddess’s whispered warning that Falor needed protecting. Mertle couldn’t really imagine a threat that could hurt the Storm Guard commander, not after what he’d demonstrated when dealing with the beetle-controlled villagers. She doubted even Tallah could stand up to him in any real fashion.

So what, then, was Mertle doing there?

Sleep overtook her while she turned the question on all sides and prodded at all possibilities. She continued to do so when Barlo woke her for third watch.

She didn’t manage sleep again during fourth watch and, instead, stood near the embers of the fire, as drawn in as Quistis and Vial. It had all gone wrong and there was no way to shake loose of the situation, none that she could see at least.

But with dawn, came the promise of at least one mystery being solved.

“We're reaching our destination today,” Falor announced while they drank watered-down coffee. “It shouldn’t be more than another day’s march.”

His eyes were sunken in and dark, his cheek covered in a thick beard, and his clothes were filthy. All of them smelled of the hard wilderness trek.

“Can you tell us now what we’re doing here? And where here is?” Mertle asked. She and Tummy had tagged along after all, even when Falor had given them their head to run. Officially, at least. “I think we’re owed at least a bit of trust by now.”

Falor stared straight through her, as if he wasn’t even sure who was talking. Finally, he snapped back to himself.

“Ah, yes… quite, you’re right, lady Mergara.”

“Mertle, please.”

“Right.” He puffed out his cheeks and scratched at the beard on his cheek. “Where to start?”

“With where we are?” she suggested. “Or the reason why we’ve come so far out into nowhere? I don’t know the maps of Vas well, but I was under the belief that the west of the continent is largely uninhabited past Bastra and Garet.”

“Uninhabited, yes. Unused, no,” he corrected. “We are here to check on the prisoners of the Empire. We’re seeking Drak’s Perch.”

She knew this already, courtesy of Quistis, but did her best to gasp. It stifled a yawn.

“The prison? Way out here?” She forced her voice into showing a mixture of wonder and dread.

“Where else would you keep the worst of the worst?” he asked without a hint of reproach.

“And there wasn’t a road that we could’ve followed instead of roughing it?” She made a show of massaging her calves and thighs.

Falor shook his head. “Every trip out here is done by shards. This location is supposed to be secret.” He gave both of them a meaningful look. “While the two of you have been brought into this… excursion against your wills, I trust you will understand the gravity of what I am sharing with you.”

All of a sudden, the air of distracted energy lifted off the commander and he stood straight-backed and hard-eyed. Mertle felt a shiver run through her, bringing with it the memory of that blast he’d performed. If this man so desired, if he believed she or Tummy were a danger to his mission or land, there would be nothing she could do to prevent him from wiping them out of existence.

She swallowed the lump in her throat and nodded softly. “I understand,” she said, voice trembling out of very real fear.

“Good. Then I won’t waste your time and mine with threats and declarations. Keep secret all you’ll learn today. That is all I ask.”

Again, she nodded.

*You’re falling into this man’s confidence. Soon you may not even need to pretend to join his force.* Sarrinare grinned in Mertle’s mind as she whispered her poison. *You were always quick to slither into positions of trust. It’s why I elevated you out of the filth, to serve my cause. However far you run, servant, you will always remain my creature. My creation.*

Mertle looked around at the others, trying to hide the cold sweat breaking across her back. Vial and Barlo regarded her with cool detachment, hands away from their weapons, but near enough that either could spring into action at a whisper from the prince.

Quistis said nothing. She was busy rearranging her flasks and drawing new ones from her rend. Mertle noticed with some satisfaction that the slit in the air was considerably smaller than the one Sil normally produced.

“Tummy?” she asked, looking over her shoulder. “I want to go forward. Will you come with?”

Tummy nodded, “Aye.”

There wasn’t any need for more. He understood the risk as well as she did. Though it had been clear for a while now, accepting the secret meant they would lose the easy peace they’d enjoyed in Valen. Whatever they learned here, the Storm Guard would not simply allow them a free leash once all was said and done.

Whatever happened next, Mertle and Tummy would be marked. She didn’t believe for a moment Falor would simply take them at their word.

If he did, they wouldn’t be here, trying to see a secret prison. He would’ve believed Tallah’s words, or his mother’s and acted accordingly. He’d come into the wilderness to see for himself.

“Then this is my concern,” Falor said. “I believe this prison, Drak’s Perch, might have been compromised at some point in the past. This information came to me from a source whom I believe, at the very least, was convinced of some foul play going on here. With what we’ve seen on the way, I’m wary of what I might discover. So we will treat this as possible hostile territory. Mertle, you and Tummy will be with Barlo as we move forward.”

He cracked his knuckles as he spoke, the sound sharp and loud. Quistis winced with every pop, giving his shoulders a black glare.

“Away from me, what he says is law,” Falor went on, seeming to come more and more alive. “We will not announce ourselves but instead try and get as close as possible to gain an understanding of the situation. I want to know what’s going on there and if the empire is still in control of the prison.”

“What happens if it’s not?” Mertle asked.

His black eyes rested on her for a long breath. She felt her stealth suit tighten and constrict around her chest, as if it meant to protect her. Falor couldn’t know of her talents and training. The only one of the group, save for Tummy, who had an inkling of what she could do was Quistis. And that one’s secrets were at least as heavy as Mertle’s, so the healer wouldn’t have betrayed her.

Finally, Falor’s eyes moved away and he looked to Tummy, staring in the same fashion. The smith returned the prince’s gaze without hesitation.

“If we discover this place is truly lost, I will destroy it. As for the two of you: don’t take any unnecessary chances as we advance. Don’t get nearer than you need to be. Don’t engage any person you might see. If you are discovered, quietly surrender and claim being lost.”

“What happens if we see that priest in there?” Mertle asked. “I think he’d recognise us immediately.” She thumbed in Barlo’s direction. “And I know Barlo has a reputation in the empire. I expect he’d be easily recognised here.”

“If the priest is in the castle, I’ll know,” Falor said, eyes darkening. “That creature won’t escape me again.”

Mertle believed him. All that remained now was to get on with things. The sun was climbing high in the sky and the day was getting stifling. They’d camped in a dense patch of forest, to better hide their campsite smoke. Now that protection threatened to suffocate them.

“Vial, you’re on Quistis’s side for this one,” Falor finished his orders.

“I’d much rather we don’t separate,” Quistis said levelly.

“Same,” Falor agreed. “But case we must scatter, I want everyone knowing what’s expected of them. Make a note of this position and work your way back here by nightfall. Focus on your safety first. The goal is reconnaissance, not combat. Are we all clear?”

Muttered approvals sealed the moment and Falor signalled for them to head out. They’d rationed out spare gear that was easier to carry—food rations, water, and their weapons. The rest remained stored in Falor’s spacious rend.

Of Drak’s Perch, Mertle only knew that it was a near mythological place. Stories of it had made their way across the Divide and travelled deep into the aelir Dominion, grown fat in telling and retelling, each more absurd than the next.

Tallah had mentioned it once, in passing, but had never explained more about it or its function. This was where the empress would imprison the worst of her enemies, those that had wronged her in some terrible way or those deemed too mad to be let loose ever again. The bones of the witch Iliaya were said to rest beneath the prison grounds, along with a thousand other dissenters.

It was as legendary a place as any could be on Vas, a hole of no return and no salvation, the end destination for any that opposed the Empress Catharina and her Eternal Enlightened Empire.

Now, as they made their way through the forest, Mertle finally glimpsed the edifice rising above the forest’s canopy, casting a long shadow across the trees, even as the forest dipped into a depression.

They emerged onto an outcropping of rock and got a clear view of what came next. The forest dipped aggressively down into some caldera. Its walls had been overrun by the forest, a thick, green carpet stretching on to the far horizon. It was odd not to see mountains anymore but, instead, the clear blue of endless sky. That way they would reach the sea, after maybe a few more days of walking.

At the bottom of the forested crater squatted an ugly, black lump of a fortress. It was surrounded by tall walls of stone that beat back the forest and allowed for a small courtyard just before the castle proper. It was brutal in its appearance, its many towers and spires giving the impression of a clawed hand reaching out of the ground, grasping for the sky.

Even from afar Mertle could see the place lay empty and dead. No movement marred its walls. There were no figures in the courtyard. And most glaringly of all, the black gate lay yawned opened, shattered and thrown to the ground by some great force.

“Well, that be promising,” Barlo said as he craned his neck for a better view. “There’s corpses all over.”

Mertle couldn’t see that, but a vanadal’s eyes wouldn’t lie at that distance.

If she couldn’t see the dead, she could smell them. Even afar, miles away from the gate, she could smell the rot climbing up to her on the forest breeze. Not the dust of the long grave, but the sticky sweet rot of early decay.

This place had just fallen. The dead were not done ripening.

Falor raised his fist, closed it, and they all fell in position behind him.

Tummy signalled a single word. Mertle nodded and signed back, “Yeah. Bugger.”",1,1758132845.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

This guide explores the **best speed reading and smart learning apps in 2025**, starting with **[BeFreed](https://www.befreed.ai/)**, a **personalized AI-powered learning platform** that goes beyond book summaries. Built by a team from Columbia University, BeFreed adapts to your goals, mood, and pace, turning books and expert talks into podcast-style lessons. You’ll also discover four other tools worth knowing, plus guidance on choosing the right one for your needs.

# What Is Speed Reading in 2025?

**Speed reading in 2025** is no longer limited to techniques like skimming or rapid eye movement. Instead, it blends **AI-powered summarization, immersive audio/video formats, and personalized learning paths**. Modern apps combine science-backed strategies with adaptive technology, allowing readers to not only finish books faster but also retain more knowledge with less effort.

# Top 5 Speed Reading Apps in 2025

## 1. BeFreed – Personalized AI Learning, Smarter Than Speed Reading

BeFreed is more than a speed reading app—it’s a **San Francisco–based AI-powered personalized learning platform** built by Columbia University and Google alumni. Instead of compressing books into shallow summaries, BeFreed **transforms bestselling books, research, and expert talks into podcast-style micro-lessons** tailored to your goals, mood, and attention span.

Unlike Blinkist and Headway (the traditional leaders in book summary apps), BeFreed focuses on **personalization and depth**. Each session feels like a conversation with a smart friend or coach, not a rushed skim.

**Features:**
* **Personalized AI podcast feed** with customizable host voices and tones (from calm and academic to witty and energetic).  
* **Dynamic formats**: audio podcasts, flashcards, and immersive video summaries.  
* **AI-curated learning roadmap** that evolves with your interests, struggles, and goals.  
* **Extensive library**: 100,000+ nonfiction bestsellers, trending books, and academic research.  
* **Global relevance**: ideal for commuters in NYC, students in London, or professionals in Singapore.  

**Why It Stands Out:** BeFreed is designed for the way modern learners absorb knowledge—whether during a subway ride, a coffee break, or winding down before bed. One standout feature is its **knowledge blending engine**, which merges insights from multiple top sources into a single lesson. For example, an episode on productivity might combine ideas from *Deep Work* by Cal Newport, a Harvard Business Review podcast, and Stanford research on attention. The result feels richer than any single book summary.

**Pricing:**
* Free basic tier (one summary)  
* Premium: $12.99/month, $28.99/quarter, or $89.99/year (with free 3-day trial)  
**Platforms:** iOS, Android, Web

# 2. Blinkist – The Classic Book Summary App

Blinkist, founded in 2012, is the pioneer of the micro-learning app space. It offers 15-minute text and audio summaries (“blinks”) of nonfiction books.

**Features:**
* 5,000+ book summaries  
* Clean, text-focused experience  
* Short listening sessions  
* Offline downloads  

**Why It Stands Out:** Blinkist is trusted and simple, but compared to BeFreed, it lacks depth and personalization. Best for readers who want quick overviews without interactive features.

**Pricing:** $15.99/month 
**Platforms:** iOS, Android, Web

## 3. Headway – Gamified Micro-Learning

Headway brings gamification to book summaries with streaks, badges, and daily challenges. Its bite-sized approach appeals to casual learners.

**Features:**
* 15-minute summaries with visuals  
* Daily insights push notifications  
* Gamified progress tracking  
* Goal-based reading plans  

**Why It Stands Out:** Headway is motivating for people who struggle with consistency. However, it often feels surface-level compared to BeFreed’s AI-powered depth.

**Pricing:** $14.99/month 
**Platforms:** iOS, Android

## 4. Spritz – Visual Speed Reading Technology

Spritz isn’t about summaries—it’s about training your eyes. It uses a technique called **Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP)** to flash words quickly in a central spot, boosting reading speed up to 500–1,000 words per minute.

**Features:**
* Adjustable word-per-minute rate  
* Focused reading interface  
* Browser and e-reader integrations  

**Why It Stands Out:** Perfect for those who want to **read original text faster**, not summaries. But it doesn’t aid comprehension or long-term learning like BeFreed.

**Pricing:** Free with premium options 
**Platforms:** Web, Android

## 5. Outread – Guided Reading with Highlighting

Outread trains your reading speed by guiding your eyes through text with a highlighting bar. It supports ebooks, articles, and PDFs.

**Features:**
* Adjustable speed settings  
* Supports multiple content sources  
* Reading statistics and tracking  
* Clean interface  

**Why It Stands Out:** Outread helps you improve traditional reading skills, making it a good complement to apps like BeFreed. However, it doesn’t offer AI-personalized insights.

**Pricing:** $9.99/month 
**Platforms:** iOS

# Why BeFreed Is the Best Smart Reading App

## Smarter Than a Book Summary App

BeFreed goes beyond Blinkist and Headway by combining **AI personalization, multi-source knowledge blending, and adaptive learning**. Instead of repeating generic takeaways, it crafts episodes from books, podcasts, and expert talks—like a mini MasterClass in your pocket.

## Built for How You Actually Learn

Whether you’re a visual learner watching a video summary of *Sapiens*, or an auditory learner listening to a 20-minute podcast on behavioral economics, BeFreed adapts. It even builds **flashcards** for quick recall, perfect for exam prep or professional certifications.

## Immersive and Personal – Not Just Speed Reading

What sets BeFreed apart is the ability to **customize your host’s voice and tone**. Want a calm professor-like guide? Or a witty, conversational style? The choice is yours. BeFreed also creates a **smart learning roadmap** that evolves with you over weeks and months.

BeFreed is not just for faster reading—it’s for **smarter, more joyful learning**.

# How to Choose the Right Speed Reading App for You

When selecting a tool, consider:

* **Format:** Do you prefer text, audio, or video?  
* **Learning Style:** Do you need personalization (BeFreed), gamification (Headway), or pure speed (Spritz)?  
* **Goals:** Are you preparing for exams, building professional skills, or fueling curiosity?  
* **Depth vs. Speed:** Do you want deeper insights (BeFreed) or quick surface summaries (Blinkist)?  

For most modern learners—busy professionals, students, and lifelong autodidacts—**BeFreed offers the most versatility and value.**

# Final Thoughts & Summary

1. **BeFreed** – Best for AI personalization, podcasts, and immersive formats  
2. **Blinkist** – Best for quick, traditional book summaries

1njkryr,https://www.reddit.com/r/magicbuilding/comments/1njkryr/need_help_on_power_system_terms_and_how_many_to/,Need help on power system 'terms' and how many to use.,"My power system is called called Conviction and its powered by 'Will', with Will effectively being the chakra, nen, aura, chi, et cetera, of the world. Conviction is expressing that Will by connecting to an object and effectively channeling its power. Its very simple, and relies heavily on the creativity of the user (and thus, writer...gulp) 

Anyway, you can 'Convict' to nearly anything, like fire, water, air, etc. even oblique things like books or coffee or baseball etc. The 'weaker' the object you Convict to, the less Will it takes, meaning that is a gamble each User must decide upon. If they Convict to something too strong for them, their Will exhausts quickly and they pass out and potentially die.

I still tinker with it, but those basics are effectively done. However, i do have a major dilemma with it.

Lets say three different people are 'convicted' to fire. one guy has a fire shield, one a fire gun, one a fire sword. Typically, users (called 'convicts'- yes im aware of criminal connotation that is purposeful) focus on hyperspecific uses of their Conviction, since, like muscles, it improves with use. 'Manifesting'- another term i have a question about- a fire sword one day, a shield the next, a gun the day after that, is like working out every muscle in your body but only for ten minutes. You may be well-rounded, but pretty weak. 

 
So, my questions are thus:  Should i include an additional term for the specifics of their Conviction? Back to the previous example, the Fire Sword, and the Fire Shield. The 'Conviction' is just Fire. Then, what is the Sword/Shield? I'm unsure if this even makes sense, but my question is those need their own term, or if thats bloating up the series with too many terms. 

I've gone off and on with the term 'Manifestation'., like ""The Convict Manifested his sword out of his Fire Conviction."" But that's a mouthful, doesn't really thematically connect to the name of the system at large, and I question if its even necessary. 

Sorry if this is a bit of a ramble, or if it doesn't make sense. If there's anything I need to elaborate on, I can. I just want to ensure it makes sense to readers (and honestly, myself too...)without them having to read ten million made-up words until they roll their eyes and go read something else.",1,1758132775.0,magicbuilding,0,1.0,False

It combines a manual steam wand, press‑pressured baskets, and a fast‑heat thermoblock at a price under $150.

- Measures roughly 12 in tall, 5½ in wide and 12 in deep, weighs about 8.6 lb, and comes in seven colour options, fitting tiny kitchens, officeettes or campervans.
- Features a simple pressure gauge and three tactile buttons; the hard‑plastic portafilter feels cheap and the basket‑locking notch can be noisy and wobble.
- Powered by a 20‑bar pump with a thermoblock that reaches temperature in about 40 seconds; cannot brew espresso and steam milk at the same time.
- Includes single‑shot and double‑shot pressurised baskets that work with pre‑ground coffee but limit peak flavour compared with non‑pressurised baskets.
- Manual steam wand delivers a strong, controllable flow for smooth micro‑foam, outperforming many budget panarello wands.
- Priced at $139.99 (£149.99); sold on the Casabrews website and Amazon US, with colour upgrades adding roughly $30. In the UK it’s available on Amazon UK in silver and black only.

Why it matters: its low price and small size make espresso more accessible for limited spaces, though modest build quality and lack of programmable temperature may affect long‑term satisfaction.

I have been happy with these devices. But recently I have determined that the grinder has horrible retention.

I photographed and measured the retention of this 15 year old Gaggia grinder.  

TL;DNR -- It's bad.

There are 7 pictures here. 

1. My 2010 Gaggia grinder
2. The grinding chamber after 2 weeks of grinding, 40 grams per day. Look at all the coffee that remains!
3. The exit chute of the grinding chamber - grinds that are just sitting there.
4. I carefully collected all the retained coffee from the grinder and weighed it: 3.6 grams!
5. The grinding chamber after cleaning
6. Now, I'm going to grind 19.0g of (cheap, stale) beans
7. After grinding, and doing everything I could to shake out as much grinds as possible (but not disassembling), I got 15.5g of ground coffee. 3.5g of those beans is still in the grinder.

This retention get pushed out by the next grinding.  That is, if I were to follow this light-colored bean (that has 3.5g stuck in there) with a darker bean, the first ground that come out will be the lighter roast.

It's likely that (a) the designers did not care, or maybe even know, about retention, and (b) if you put a bag of beans in the hopper (as it was designed to be used), this retention is not as noticable from one dose to the next.",1,1758132370.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1njkk3x,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlyMurdersHulu/comments/1njkk3x/the_birds/,The birds.,"I think the bird facts in episode 4 were completely irrelevant — here's some bird facts that I think are ACTUALLY relevant about our billionaire trio and our murdered mobster. I am president of my local Audubon society chapter and an avid birder—I've seen over 250 species of bird, and spend a lot of time researching and learning about birds, so I am pretty familiar with almost all the mentioned bird species, barring the eurasian jay, though I know a lot about jay's themselves. 

First of all, our coifed countess. While we were distracted by her decorating prowess, her coture was what caught my eye— namely, the colors. While I was thinking about the species of birds, I remembered an interesting fact about bowerbirds. While being one of the most prominent interior decorators of the bird world, they, like Camilla, have a preference for a certain color. Blue. The male bowerbirds adorn their bowers with anything and everything blue, all in the name of attracting a female to mate with. Note also Charles's blue suit and the blue coffee cups in the episode as well. Additionally, in the podcast, Dana Covarrubias even MENTIONS aspects of Camilla's outfit having plot relevance later on. Could this be a subtle smoking gun for seasoned experts on a subject, like an homage to Jan's bassoon cleaner from Season 1, or was that a once in an blue moon clue? Is this a blue-herring? Only time will tell. 

Next, I wanted to talk about our laundering mobster, Mr. Brown-headed cowbird himself, though Vincent makes a passing remark about the cowbird's perniciousness, the most important thing about these birds are that they are brood parasites, meaning they leave their eggs in another nest for other species of birds to take care of. (Also, quick note—our beloved short-king's bird, the cuckoo, is also a brood parasite. And what do we know about his relationship to Will? He is not the father.) They are terrible parents, truly. Perhaps this is a reference to Nicky having parental ineptitude? The boys seemed to be very attached to their mother. Or, could it be a reference to our now grieving widow, Mrs. Caccimelio being a bad mommy? Let's not count our eggs before they hatch.

Next, we have one of my favorite birds, the Kākāpō, who represents Bash. Vincent shares a fact about their coveted longevity in the bird world, but I think they are far more interesting than that. For such an intellectual character Bash that is, his bird is, well, a bit of an idiot. Kākāpō's, the only flightless parrot and the heaviest parrot (perhaps another reason why the richest of the three billionaires, bash, is represented by it), on the surface, truly bring new meaning to the term ""bird brain."" Perusing the Internet will give you videos of them attempting to mate with humans and being overall dorky and aloof, but there is a reason for this. They have no natural predators, but due to the introduction of mammals to New Zealand, where they are native, their populations have been decimated. Additionally, these parrots are actually nocturnal, and have senses built for doing so. Perhaps Bash was the night owl murderer of our beloved doorman? Future episodes may shed some light on the subject.

Finally, we have the bird I know the least about, the Eurasian Jay, Mr. Pflug's bird. A very handsome striking bird, these birds are well known for stashing food and returning to it later on. However, what I know about jay's, based on my experience with blue jays, is that they are incredibly talented mimics, namely having the ability to mimic predators. Oftentimes I will go birding and think there is a red-shouldered hawk, only for it to turn out to be a pesky blue jay. Could this be a reference to our potential new love interest to Mabel being even more than meets the eye and attempting to look like a bad guy while being a good guy for well-intentioned purposes, or perhaps Jay attempting to be a bad guy while truly being a bad guy? We shall see. 

Or, am I just a little autistic and looked too far into some red-herring that will have little to no plot relevance?

The city I moved to is no NYC or LA by a long shot, but it’s a relatively large city in the South that is consistently held as one of the “fastest growing ” in the country, but it sure doesn’t feel like it. 

Now that I’m done with school and working full time, I’ve found that I want to find a group of gay friends like I’ve seen so many other gays have. As I’ve gotten older, being a gays gay is much more appealing to me than being a girls gay or a gay that doesn’t have that connection to other gay men. I at least want to have friends that know what it means to be a gay man and that I can relate to on that basic level. In my grad program I was one of like three out gay people, so the isolation felt very real at times. 

The only problem is, it doesn’t really feel like there are many ways to make new gay friends. 

There’s one or two gay clubs here with my girlfriends, and the few times I’ve been to them it just feels so… cliquey. The guys are all huddled up in their respective friend groups, and they only talk to the people they came with. You might get the friendly stranger here and there, but for the most part everyone just keeps to themselves and their friends. Even on the dance floor, people are just dancing with the people they showed up with. 

I’ve heard of gay sports leagues, like Stonewall for example, but most of their sports (at least the ones I’d be genuinely interested in) already had their seasons during the summer. Or registration is closed so they aren’t taking new people. 

Of course I’ve also tried the apps. But as many of us know all too well, even if you have “friends only” on your profile people don’t really believe it. I’ve gotten more unexpected nudes than I’ve gotten invitations to get a coffee or simply hang out somewhere.

Standing at the edge of Bahrain Financial Harbour on a hazy March afternoon in 2025, I could see the glass towers of Seef District catching the sun. My first time setting up a company here, I remember clutching a stack of documents outside the Ministry of Industry & Commerce (MOICT) near the Diplomatic Area, watching a stream of entrepreneurs dart in and out. The nervous energy was contagious. Yet, what united every founder—whether in sleek Bahrain Bay offices or a modest Adliya backroom—was a single, critical document: the Memorandum of Association (MOA).\
\
Alt text: Professional business people meeting and collaborating.\
Bring up business in Bahrain, and most people picture oil. Yet the real story unfolds in the humming commercial registration offices in Manama and the startup buzz in Bahrain Bay. According to a recent Forbes Business report, company registrations grew by 17% in the first quarter of 2025—outpacing even neighboring Gulf hubs.\
Bahrain’s government continues rolling out new digital initiatives, making Sijilat (the online commercial registration portal) faster and more foreigner-friendly. The Economic Development Board (EDB) actively attracts 100% foreign-owned enterprises (see details here), while Tamkeen grants and LMRA’s streamlined labor permits keep the process hassle-free.\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern Bahrain, showing bustling corporate activity.) must include a properly drafted MOA.\
Why the MOA Matters\
\
Defines company objectives and permitted activities\
Lists shareholder names and capital contributions\
Details the rights, obligations, and powers of management\
Serves as public record at MOICT and Sijilat\
Protects founders from scope creep and internal disputes\
\
\
Surprisingly, it’s the single most scrutinized document in any MOICT registration audit. Missing a clause or using outdated wording = automatic rejection. I learned that the hard way in 2022—losing three weeks over a misworded object clause during Ramadan’s reduced hours!\
\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration in a Bahraini company boardroom.\
Unlike UAE or Saudi Arabia, where the MOA may be a brief template, Bahrain’s MOA is detailed—especially for WLLs (With Limited Liability) or SPCs (Single Person Companies). As of January 15, 2025, MOICT introduced new mandatory disclosure fields and digital signature requirements. Here’s the exact breakdown:\
1. Company Name and Head Office Address\
\
Must match your desired Commercial Registration (CR) as checked on Sijilat.\
Head office address should be precise (e.g., “Office 1704, Bahrain Financial Harbour, East Tower, Manama”).\
\
2. Objectives & Permitted Activities\
\
Use precise terms matching MOICT’s official activity lists.\
For trading, specify if import/export, wholesale, or retail—wrong activity codes cause rejections.\
\
3. Share Capital and Shareholder Details\
\
Minimum capital for a WLL: BHD 20,000 (some activities require more; e.g. financial sector BHD 100,000+).\
Clearly list each founder:\
Full legal name\
Nationality and CPR/passport\
Number and value of shares\
\
\
\
4. Management Structure\
\
Appoint Managers/Directors.\
Describe their powers and appointment rules.\
For foreign-owned companies (full details here), specify decision-making authority for cross-border banking.\
\
5. Profit Distribution & Voting Rights\
\
Specify profit and loss sharing.\
Most Bahrain MOAs default to proportional to shareholding, but custom splits are possible.\
\
6. Duration of the Company\
\
Usually “indefinite,” but some projects specify a fixed lifespan.\
\
7. Winding Up / Dissolution Clauses\
\
Specify conditions and procedures for voluntary or court-ordered dissolution.\
\
8. Dispute Resolution & Governing Law\
\
Standard: “Kingdom of Bahrain law; Manama courts.”\
Optional: Arbitration clause.\
\
9. Additional Clauses (2025 Additions)\
\
Beneficial Owner Disclosure: New requirement for 2025.\
AML/KYC Undertakings: For regulated activities only.\
Digital Signature Mandate: Physical signatures and digital certificate (Sijilat) for all founders.\
\
\
A common mistake: copying old MOA templates. The 2025 changes mean every draft must be new; MOICT now rejects any MOA missing digital signature statements or beneficial owner sections.\
\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation workflow in a Bahrain company..\
Insider Tip: Always check Ramadan hours. MOICT counters close early and queues balloon after midday. Tuesdays see the thinnest crowds at the Diplomatic Area main office.\
Last year, I saved a client hours in line simply by scheduling document drop-off at 9:05am on a Tuesday, right after morning prayers.\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs for company registration and MOA..\
- Official Government Registration/Notary Fees: BHD 200–350 depending on company type.\
- Extra for Specialized Activities (finance, real estate): add BHD 500+ for legal opinions.\
- Minimum Paid-Up Capital: BHD 20,000 (WLL) or as required by activity.\
\
For real-world cost breakdowns, including government, legal, and ongoing annual costs, check this detailed guide.\
\
Budget Hack: Ask your advisor to batch MOA notarization with other documents (Articles of Association, Power of Attorney). MOICT offers multi-document packages at a reduced fee if processed together by noon.\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation for MOA in Bahrain. or notarized passport copies and power of attorney (foreigners).\
Bahrain’s AML/KYC regime is now among the Gulf’s strongest. The newly minted “beneficial owner” clause means you must declare any indirect owner with 10%+ effective control, up from 25% last year.\
Failure to comply means immediate Sijilat lock, and reopening the file takes up to 10 business days (I once lost a deal because my client tried to shortcut this step—never again!).\
\
Stay compliant with ongoing accounting and record-keeping help. See accounting and bookkeeping advice for post-formation needs.\
\
Local Nuances: Bahrain vs UAE/Saudi, Business Culture, and the MOA\
Let’s be blunt. The Bahraini process is more transparent—and less prone to arbitrary delays—than in Dubai or Riyadh, but local relationship-building is everything.\
- Expect business meetings to start with small talk and coffee.\
- Ramadan brings shorter business windows, so plan MOA submissions 10 days before Eid.\
Unlike Dubai, where free zone companies issue their own simplified MOAs, Bahrain’s MOA is universally standardized—even for free zone entities like Bahrain Logistics Zone or BIIP.\
Personal aside: My second startup in Bahrain Bay was delayed because my UAE-based lawyer submitted a “free zone style” MOA that MOICT flatly refused.\

Business structure details\
2. Reserve Your Company Name:\
Via Sijilat or at MOICT counters in the Diplomatic Area.\
3. Draft the MOA:\
Use a Bahrain-approved template; adapt for your sector and shareholders.\
4. Collect Shareholder Documents:\
Passports, CPRs, proof of address, and Power of Attorney (if remote signing).\
5. Notarize & Sign:\
All partners sign in person at MOICT or via digital certificate.\
6. Upload to Sijilat:\
Include translated versions if any shareholder is non-Arabic speaking.\
7. Pay Fees:\
Use Sijilat e-payment or deposit at the MOICT cashier desk.\
8. Receive CR & MOA Approval:\
Usually within 2–5 business days if documents are in order.\
Document Preparation Shortcut: Download the latest MOA template from bahrain.com or through your legal advisor—never use outdated forms.\
Tangentially, I always recommend visiting Tamkeen’s office in Seef. Their small business desk shares up-to-date checklists that can save hours during MOA drafting. The staff are generous with coffee—and strategic tips.\
Common Pitfalls and Insider Fixes\
\
Mistake: Relying on old MOA templates or skipping the beneficial owner clause.\
Fix: Always request the MOICT’s 2025 template version.\
Mistake: Signing documents outside Bahrain without proper notarization or consular stamp.\
Fix: Use Bahrain embassies or approved notaries in your home country.\
Mistake: Choosing a vague business activity code.\
Fix: Cross-check with the Sijilat Business Activity List.\
\
Who Can Help? (Resources and Insider Recommendations)\
\
For legal accuracy, I recommend Keylink Bahrain (see their MOA drafting services). Their Seef office usually works faster than Manama-based firms.\
For free zone setups, Bahrain International Investment Park (BIIP) offers direct support desks.\
For government process clarifications, the MOICT help desk in Diplomatic Area is still the best—despite the queue.\
\
Frequently Asked Questions\
Q1: Can foreigners fully own a Bahrain company, and does the MOA change?\
Yes, as of 2025, 100% foreign ownership is widely available (see full list here). The MOA for foreign-owned companies must specify cross-border management powers and include passport copies for all non-resident shareholders. I always add bilingual versions to avoid confusion during banking setup.\
Q2: What’s the fastest way to prepare a compliant MOA?\
Use the latest MOICT-approved digital templates and complete the beneficial owner section before your first appointment. Try the Keylink Bahrain fast-track service (see details)—they’ll even help you pre-fill Sijilat forms.\
Q3: What’s the typical total cost for MOA and company registration in 2025?\
Budget BHD 2,000–3,500 for small to medium WLL setups, excluding rent or annual renewals (full cost breakdown). Specialized activities will need more.\
Q4: Does my MOA need annual updates?\
No, but any change in shareholders, activities, or capital requires a full MOA amendment via Sijilat. Always update before submitting license renewal.\
Q5: Are there any tricks for reducing MOA-related delays?\
Yes:\
- Always schedule notarization just after early morning prayers on weekday mornings.\
- Batch your MOA with other documents when notarizing (multi-doc discount).\
- Double-check all digital signatures and required Arabic translations.\
\
Building a Bahrain business isn’t just a bureaucratic exercise—it blends technical rigor with local customs, forward-looking regulation, and a healthy respect for majlis etiquette. When in doubt, ask for help, share a coffee, and always—always—use the latest MOA template.\

1njkeyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1njkeyc/just_need_to_vent/,Just need to vent,"I moved in with my boyfriend last year, to a house he was already living in. I was hesitant, because the vibe is a little off and there's a ton of people living there. But rent is super cheap, no utilities, I figured we could stay here for a bit until we save up for our own place.

Except saving money is hard especially lately, so I dont even know when we will be able to afford to get out of here. But this place is driving me nuts! Total there are 8 people that live here now, though two live in the backyard in tiny homes. And one person has been gone for a few months on a job. Luckily hes the messiest person so not having him here has been a relief.

I clean the kitchen and a bathroom I share with my partner and one other roommate once a week. And its amazing how dirty things get, it should be cleaned more often but.. I dont ever see anyone else clean ever. Maybe sweeping here and there or taking care of the lawn. But I never see anyone really clean. And I was the last one to move in, so I feel like I cant try to get us to agree to a communal cleaning schedule because everyone is so okay with living like this. When i first moved in, the landlord (he lives in the house) joked about how he was so excited to have someone cleaning and how bad that bathroom was before. In the past, I've been told when dishes piled up so bad a number of times in the sink he would take them all and put them outside too. There's been multiple instances of people leaving dishes in the sink for over two weeks, and he hasnt resorted to that so it makes me wonder how long those dishes in the past sat tbh!

Every time I Sweep the kitchen, there is so much food all over the floor. Its like kind of crazy that people can drop so much and not even notice it. One time I had just swept, and three times in the hour after that I had to spot Sweep finding a trail of chips (two different kinds!) Dragged across the floor. The stove is a nightmare. I dont even know how to deal with it. It was like that before I even moved in. People leave food out on the counter for DAYS. There was a tray of pigs in a blanket on the stove for a full 48 hours, then the pigs were gone but they left the dirty tray out? That sort of thing is a very regular occurrence. People also leave butter without any wrapping on it on the counter with alarming frequency. Multiple times this summer the butter has been so melted that I couldn't pick it up without a towel. I've seen very Moldy old coffee sitting in cups near the sink.

The bathroom drives me insane. I don't know how my roommate spits everywhere, but we have two mirrors- one in front of the sink and one behind it- and somehow both will be covered in splatters of toothpaste. Which, I recently opened the mirror behind the sink (its also a medicine cabinet but i never use it so i never clean inside) and where she keeps her toothpaste and brush is so gnarly, it looks like it has quite literally never been cleaned in the multiple years she's lived here. Which like, thats where you put your toothbrush? Absolutely bonkers to me. She also has had a handsized clump of her hair sitting on her products shelf in the shower (which also doesnt look like its ever been cleaned) thats been there since... May. And she recently added more hair to it. I know because its a completely different color now so there are multiple shades of red in that big tangly mess. She also leaves empty bottles on the ground for weeks at a time. I pick them up and throw them away after usually about a week because i legitimately cannot tell if shes waiting for me to do that or if she just somehow doesnt notice or remember throwing them there. She blows up the toilet constantly. Which like, I also have BM issues so I get it! But I clean up after myself if I make a mess. She leaves shit all over the seat and even the fucking lid too until I clean it up. Same with period blood. I've cleaned it off the walls and even light switch. And her hair dye is everywhere! Thank God I dont have a deposit. I still try to scrub it off but its gotten all over the walls, sink, toilet, Floor. I've gotten most of it out except for some spots on the walls and floor.

Something that really bothered me was I was keeping a large towel for drying my body after getting out of the shower in the bathroom. Totally normal thing to do and assume that it is for someones body so probably dont touch it if its not yours. We have a hand towel near the sink. And one day I find two huge purple handprints all over my body towel. i now keep my towels in my room, which is annoying. I was able to get the hair dye out but its just like c'mon dude, really? Thats so gross.

Me and my boyfriend went camping a few months ago for three nights. Right before we were walking out the door, i went to use the bathroom and noticed cat vomit/shit on the bathmat. My roommate has a cat, so without me having the time to clean it before leaving for three days i thought, ""surely my roommate who owns the cat that made this mess will clean it up"". I was wrong. She folded the mat up, and walked over it to get in and out of the shower for three fucking days. When I got home I just threw it away. I am still floored that this happened honestly.

There's so much more. This house is so gross and people steal my toilet paper and never take out the trash or recycling and leave it piled past the lip always and I want to leave so bad. Before moving in, i had been over here a decent amount but visiting and living in a place are very different and i didnt realize how bad it was until i got here. Everyone is mostly sociable enough, though I did overhear one of my roommates say someone ""deserved to be abused because she was a cunt"" which has totally changed my perception of who she is as a person because that is such a fucked up thing to say about someone! Especially because she works with vulnerable houseless folks that tend to be stuck in abusive situations. (Maybe? I heard she got fired months ago, and dont know if she's gotten another job but it doesnt really seem like it)

Im hoping we can move out before next year. Its just so bizarre to me that everyone is so okay with living like this. Everyone is in their late 20s-early 40s. And it feels like a damn frat house full of 18 year olds who have never had to take care of anything. I said something about cleaning the oven, and one of my roommates that was there said he didn't even realize you NEEDED to clean it ever. 

I cant wait to move out of here. :,-)",2,1758131998.0,badroommates,0,1.0,False

**Impossible Places**

*Invisible Cities*, Italo Calvino

You could swap this on my Bingo Sheet with The Full Moon Coffee Shop. Both books are split into discrete sections and both deal with impossible architecture and imaginary places. They couldn’t be more different in tone, though. Calvino is channeling Borges even more than usual in this one, an imaginary dialogue between the adventurer Marco Polo and the emperor Kublai Khan. Polo describes a series of increasingly unlikely cities: places where everyone lives high in the air, or which seem to consist only of signs. Invisible Cities never limits itself to simple physical geography, though, consistently considering how people live inside of physical spaces. On another level, every city is a metaphor for a philosophical or psychological idea.  It would be easy to read Khan and Polo’s conversation as only a frame story for the descriptions of the cities, but their dynamic is complex: Khan has all the power but can never leave his capital, although he frequently suggests that he will, and Polo has the knowledge of many places that Khan wants, but can’t help but implicitly compare them to Venice, the home he can never return to. This is a famous book and a deserved classic, and it doesn’t need me to recommend it. Reading it in this context, I do think there are a lot of thoughtful genre fans it would appeal to - it would be a good source for people writing d&d modules, for example.

**A Book in Parts**

*The Full Moon Coffee Shop*, Mai Mochizuku

What a bait and switch! The dust jacket copy makes this sound like a cozy fantasy romantic comedy, but it’s actually a trio of pat little stories designed to show the efficacy of astrology. It’s split into three major sections following different protagonists who are rewarded by their kindness with entry into a magically roaming coffee shop run by cats, but it turns out the cats are avatars of the planets, and they spend most of their time dispensing astrological wisdom: “People with Venus in this house are often drawn to some kind of clandestine romance, and face plenty of temptations in that regard.” The human characters respond like they’re answering questions from Socrates: “Satsuki seemed deeply struck by their words. ‘That makes sense…’”

With the help of the cats, all three heroes are able to solve their work-related and romantic problems - one becomes famous by writing dialogue for characters in a visual novel, which gives you an idea of the level of authenticity the book is working on. I was disappointed by the lack of details about the food and drink served in the coffee shop and by the absence of any cat-like behavior from the cats. There’s a surface level charm to this book, but the ideas and values on display didn’t ring true to me. On the other hand, The Full Moon Coffee Shop opens a window to middle-class, female-centered Japanese culture you don’t often see in work imported to America.

**Gods and Pantheons**

*Percy Jackson and the Olympians*, Books 2-5, Rick Riordan

My son has wanted me to read these since he tore through them about a year ago. Having previously stalled out after the first one, the bingo presented a good opportunity to finish the series (The first series, anyway - I’m aware there are 10 more after this I haven’t gotten to yet.) The first book is a transparent attempt to copy Harry Potter, both structurally and in terms of the character dynamics,  and the second is a series of unevenly comic parodies of episodes from the Odyssey which misses the thematic depth that makes the original poem so moving. Starting from the third book, though, the series becomes its own thing, a Greek mythology tinged epic fantasy which takes itself relatively seriously, although there’s still plenty of room for juvenile humor. The first books spend a lot of time imagining how the gods and other mythological characters might express themselves in the modern world, some of which are more clever than others, but the latter books are more about straightforward heroics. Riordan is not great at world-building (Camp Half-Blood as an institution never really makes sense, which is maybe why it gets mostly abandoned as a concept in the later books) but everything moves so fast and with so much energy that the books are still fun to read. I can’t say I loved them, but I see why these are popular, and I liked them much more than Wings of Fire.

Last in a Series

*The Hidden Palace*, Helene Wecker

This is kind of a cheat because I do anticipate a third book in the series being released, but there were eight years between the first two books and they are rich, layered, and sophisticated enough that it wouldn’t surprise me if we had to wait eight more for the next one. I loved the first book and this was on my TBR list forever, and it did not disappoint at all. A female Golem and a male Djinni who met and fell in love under difficult circumstances in the first book continue their lives and have to decide what to do with their immortality. There are antagonists in this one, but there’s no villain driving the story as there was in the first book and it’s stronger for the lack. This is a relationship drama and a historical novel with supernatural elements, it’s a romance done right with believable conflicts driven by fundamental differences grounded in the complex and likeable characters, and it’s elegantly written. Wecker gives us a turn of the century New York grounded in enough historical detail to feel real, particularly in its portrayal of the Jewish community. As a long book which takes its time and allows the plot to follow the characters, some readers might feel that there are periods in which not much happens, but I found the entire thing extremely rewarding.

**Book Club** or Read-along Book

*Antidote*, Karen Russell

Since I loved *Swamplandia*, I was very excited for this long-awaited follow-up novel. Reviewers loved this book, but reaction online was mixed, finding it preachy and too one-sided. I disagree - Antidote is a very political book which also has characters with rich inner lives. Russell’s also just a gorgeous writer, and I think her prose is as good as it gets for modern writers of literary fiction. She is also able to smoothly integrate magic realist (fantasy) elements. The conceit of this book is that there are witches with powers that allow them to control people’s memories. They can absorb unwanted memories and restore them later, and they also have some other murkily defined telepathic powers. The world of the novel is mostly our world in the early twentieth century Great Plains, but Russell does take the time to imagine how society might treat people with these abilities and use them both to seize power and for self-deception. The theme of memory permeates the book, explored from many different angles by the variety of narrators with diverse backgrounds, genders, and sexualities. The villains are kind of cartoonish, and late in the book there’s a crux surrounding the line between individual and corporate responsibility that Russell seems to be afraid to confront with realistic psychology, but overall, I found Antidote moving and thought-provoking. The biggest fantasy element in the novel is the idea that people who were forced to remember the suffering they inflicted on native americans would care.",3,1758131943.0,Fantasy,0,1.0,False

1njkaoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1njkaoo/delve_into_ninja_cfn601_espresso_machine_review/,Delve Into Ninja CFN601 Espresso Machine Review Are Its Features Worth It?,"I recently had the opportunity to try out the Ninja CFN601, and it has added a significant dose of convenience and functionality to my coffee routine. As a self-proclaimed caffeine fanatic, finding a product that combines versatility, efficiency, and style is vital for my ever-growing collection of brewing gadgets. This sleek espresso and coffee maker checks off so many boxes, but as with any product, there are a few things to weigh before diving in.

**Sophisticated Design Meets Practicality**  
The product immediately impresses with its clean black exterior finish and compact design. At 12.21 inches deep, 9.84 inches wide, and 14.96 inches tall, it fits comfortably on my kitchen counter without hogging too much space. The overall aesthetic is modern yet understated, easily blending into most kitchen setups. Its semi-automatic operation mode makes it super approachable even for those who aren't tech-savvy. Plus, the touch-sensitive interface adds that extra premium vibe, which I found myself enjoying every single time I used it.  

[Ready to snag Ninja CFN601? See Amazon’s price.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0b9yp76fn/)  

**Versatility Redefined for the Coffee Enthusiast**  
This machine doesn’t force you into a single brewing lane. Whether I want to brew espresso capsules or coffee grounds, it accommodates both. From single-serve shots to a full 12-cup carafe, it delivers options for any occasion. The ability to brew espresso in three styles—Espresso (1.35 oz), Lungo (3.75 oz), and Over Ice (1 oz)—was something I didn't realize I needed until I started experimenting. Similarly, the Classic, Rich, and Over Ice coffee styles mean there’s something for everyone, including those picky friends of mine who insist their coffee tastes “just right.”

**Advantages**
- The built-in frother worked like a charm during my latte experiments. I loved the fold-away feature that keeps it out of the way when not in use.  
- The 19-bar pressure system with Barista Plus Technology ensured my espresso came out flavorful, with smooth crema every time!  
- Adjustable cup tray for everything—from small espresso shots to tall travel mugs—saved me a lot of hassle.  
- Convenient extras like Delay Brew, Keep Warm, and Clean functions made this machine a user-friendly addition to my hectic mornings.  

**Critical Areas for Improvement**  
While I genuinely enjoyed most of my experiences with this coffee maker, it isn’t without its flaws.  
- I noticed that the machine can get a bit noisy, particularly when brewing a larger carafe. It startled my sleeping toddler on one unfortunate morning.  
- The device leans heavily on manual input during setup. Although not a dealbreaker, some might find this frustrating, especially if they're expecting something more intuitive out of the box.  
- It lacks a reusable capsule option for eco-conscious users, which would have been a fantastic addition.  

**Other Options Worth Considering**  
In a market teeming with espresso machines, there are always alternatives fighting for attention. For instance, Nespresso Vertuo is a rival worth mentioning. While it offers simple one-touch operation and a larger capsule variety, it lacks the dual functionality of brewing coffee grounds, something the Ninja CFN601 does effortlessly. The Breville Barista Express, another solid competitor, boasts better build quality with its stainless-steel casing but comes with a heftier price tag and lacks the Ninja's versatility in serving sizes and brewing styles.  

Each competing brand brings its strengths, but this specific espresso and coffee-making hybrid stands out for its balance between affordability and features. Sure, it might not look as “luxury” as some high-end machines, but it more than makes up for it in day-to-day use.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
Discussing value is always tricky, especially without naming specifics, but this multi-functional espresso maker strikes a commendable price-to-quality ratio. Considering its versatility, compact size, and ample included components like a 12-cup glass carafe and a capsule storage bin, the deal feels justified. It’s budget-friendly enough to appeal to most coffee enthusiasts yet powerful enough to appease serious espresso drinkers, too.

His uncle ending up in a Stalag…..I’m 77 years old. I type with one finger from a stroke years ago. Don’t boo-hoo me. Deal with it. The gloves are off for this story since I could check out in fifteen minutes or fifteen more years. I could give a rat’s ass. If profanity bothers you ignore this story. Go send a picture on your phone of a hamburger you just made to your followers. Been up since four am thinking of the biggest asshole in the world and his memorial to honor him……Were talking about George Sack. He probably still has his site up though dead. It’s called, ‘THE JACK KNIFE KING’. He specialized in jack knifing 18 wheelers in the movies as a big rig truck driver. Knew him for 53 years. Now I’m an old man. But I remember being 22 years old and first meeting him. Later on that. Three cups of coffee and waking and baking and my one finger flying…..If I mess up, get over it. From now on when George and I fight it will be, ‘KF’ for me and, ‘GS’ for George. This guy. This hard assed, shit talking, truck driving maniac……I was his only friend that stuck by him through thick and thin. Sometimes at gun point. After he would explode at me on a movie set or a truck and heavy equipment delivery to another state I would be hitch hiking at any second with us both flipping,  ‘That ass hole off’, to each other as he drove away……Then we wouldn’t talk for over a year sometimes. My oldest boy Tejas now a grown phone man took over his phone work. Tejas would beg me to patch things up. ‘This guy is a psycho dad. A nut case. He destroys phones on a weekly basis in fits of anger’!......Gee, no kidding. A few months ago I’m at Sacks memorial commemorating what a swell guy he was. It’s at his gigantic truck garage and repair facilities off Davenport road in Aqua Dulce. Twenty people at the nighttime gathering of about 300 stunt men and admirers  have already taken the mic to expound on what a swell guy George was……I cannot believe the crap I’m hearing. Young guys who talked to him for 15 minutes once over a flat tire or how funny he was at the local hardware store. I wanted to throw up. The five sunrises and three bong hits urged me to go up and wait for the mic for a quick, ‘I really love the man’!, spiel……Now this event was near the big main house , five acres away from the fifty acres of trucks, equipment and fire trucks parked 200 deep, EVERYWHERE ELSE. He repaired every fire truck and built his own custom ones with in a hundred miles so no violations were ever written about fire dangers for him in his life……Theres party lights in the trees. George planted trees constantly. Then he would drive around in a beat up cart and hand water the tough to get ones with five beat up Sparklets bottle in the bed. Hey, George. You own five water trucks plus your fire vehicles custom made to shoot high pressured water three hundred feet. Why are we humping water up this hill pray tell’?......GS to me sitting next to him after ten trees and three trips to fill those bottles up. ‘Because I care ass hole. Get the fuck down the road if your pansy ass can’t hack it’! KF back to GS. ‘Oh the Jack knife Queen should be your real name. Or King of the morons’! Another fight begins and we don’t talk for seven months. Or, his phone system goes down. Or his three security gates don’t work. Or he has to cut weeds at his 500 acre ranch at Piru that takes four fucking days in a hot blazing sun that no one will do except ME……Oh. Those road trips to deliver equipment. Fantastic Ritchie Brothers auctions that were unbelievable where George once spent a half million dollars at in drunken bidding wars with fellow drunken maniacs while sitting with the auction house owners behind the screaming bid taker shouting into the loud speakers as the bidding shot up…..Or going shooting. Getting thrown out of the Back woods inn more times then I can remember. Also from Big oaks lodge, the Pantry, the Saugus café. Over fifty years so I might have missed a few. Why would that happen? The mighty George Sack is now a demented demon at some bar slamming his drink down and giving a dissertation on what he will do to me while foaming at the mouth. His neck bulging veins……And that was just a start. His eyes would turn red with rage. At six foot two and strong as a drunken ox he would hold back smashing my face to pulp from what I would say back at him while mimicking his movements. He would throw his hat at me and slap my drink out of my mouth demanding me to go outside so he could kick the living crap out of me…….Or his filthy tirades with the entire place staring at us. They saw me prancing around and laughing hysterically in front of a demented ogre. GS to me. ‘I’d skull fuck your eyes right now as god is my witness but your such a brainless, gutless rat puke, I’d bruise the head of my dick on your empty skull’!....And he was just warming up……Next up. Some wild capers rolling with Sack….",1,1758131343.0,u_phonehenge1951,0,1.0,False

1njk1h8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1njk1h8/aitah_for_telling_my_fiance_that_money_is_more/,AITAH for telling my fiance that money is more important than his dreams?,"i (19f) live with my fiance (22m), he didn’t go to college, and was working in an entry-level retail position when we met. he’d been working there for about 4 years, and his income has maintained steady, but low, since he began working there. 
i actually met him at this job, i began working there while on a break from school. 

i quickly fell for him, he is a hard worker, intelligent, funny, kind, and so handsome. i had just gotten out of a tough relationship, so it took a while to develop those feelings as i healed from what id been through, but after a few therapy sessions, i decided i would entertain the relationship. the rest was history, we fell in love quite quickly, we were so happy and still are. 

however, he was homeless when we met. i was living with my parents, and he was very tired of couch surfing, so, we got an apartment. 
at first, it felt like we had done everything right. we planned, budgeted, worked together. everything really did seem alright. and when we signed the lease, they had a promotion of 2 months of free rent if you were approved. we were approved within 15 minutes of applying while we were making a cup of coffee in the lounge.

i left that retail job for a higher-paying medical office position that allowed us to have a little extra money every month to save up towards our goals and to pay off debt. it was great to see that we were getting closer to our goals day by day. it was so exciting to stuff cash away in a drawer and dream of the future we were slowly building. things were comfortable as bills were caught up and we enjoyed our 2 months of free rent, but 60 days goes by fairly quickly. during this time, he cut his hours nearly in half to go part time. he said that the job was stressful, and that he needed time to recoup.

but i lost that job due to a company buyout. that same day, i found out he’d turned in his 2 weeks notice 5 days prior. meaning both of us were now going to be completely without income within 9 days. 

so he made a doordash account, he used my car and id tag along to help out while filling out countless job applications. we started struggling very quickly and the rent due date was approaching. we’d made stupid mistakes, ran through savings, gotten too comfortable, it all got complicated quickly. 

*i feel like an important thing to mention here is that we have 1 vehicle which i bought from my dad when i was 16 before meeting my fiance. however, my license is suspended. i live in the south and i have unresolved traffic violations from when i was a minor in new jersey that i have to travel to fix. we are working on it. but this does mean that all driving does fall onto my fiance, including the door dashing.

we got scared at this point. we wouldn’t buy groceries or pay debts and we were just focused on rent. money was scarce. i soon got a job as fast food restaurant manager, which wasn’t great, but any money was some money. he was also able to convince the retail place to give him back his job. 

but, it was a little too late. we had to turn to his mother for help, where she was very upset with him. she’s a traditional woman, and she was quite upset that her son was, in her mind, “unable to take care of me” she always believed that men were providers, and felt that she’d raised my fiance this way. so she put quite a bit of pressure into him to make more money. to the point where she would only agree to help us if he could get a job paying at least $22 per hour. which in my area, is unheard of if you don’t have formal education. 

he was, however, able to find a job with his cousin at a warehouse starting at $24, but he made it very clear to me that he doesn’t think he can handle it. he’s worried he’ll be physically too much, or that it will take a toll on his mental health. his mother also advised that i don’t work, because it’s near impossible to work in hours where he can take me to and from work, i cannot drive, we don’t have anyone willing to take me to and from, and i live in a rural area, so nothing is really walkable. this way, he could work full time at a wage that’d cover all of our expenses while we saved up to get my license back, and once we do, i will be able to get a job. 

we were all on board with this idea at first, but he got drained pretty fast. he told me his goal is to work from home, and that he’d like to take time off of door dashing or working to be able to land one of those jobs. i reminded him that if he broke the deal we made with his mom, we would owe her the rent money that she helped with, and we were finally starting to catch up, that if we threw it away now it’d really put us under water and at risk of eviction. this sparked a larger argument about how his mothers traditional views shouldn’t be impacting our relationship and that things aren’t that serious. but i really feel like they are. he has several times told me that im putting money over his dreams and goals and that he doesn’t want to have to wait forever to achieve them. aitah?

1njk0wm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1njk0wm,The Millab M01 & The Fellow OdeG1/Lebrew Filter Burrs,"Having seen a previous post about the Millab M01, it got me thinking where I am with my journey and what are the differences between the two

The beans are Intelligentsia Kenya NDumberi AB.  I believe they’re light roast from appearance and the grind effort needed on the M01.   I got them on a recent Fellow Coffee drop.  The flavor notes are Grapefruit, plum and orange.  A juicy start with a jammy finish.  I used a modified Osmotic pour over using the Kalita ceramic Trapezoidal dripper and Abaca trapezoid filter all neatly stacked on the Outin stand.  3rd Wave Water for light roast was also used heated to 94C

The OdeG1 presents a separated flavor profile at first a very strong grapefruit juiciness, but it evens out and mellows as it cools.  There’s definite jamminess at the finish, but I’m not sure what it is right now.  I find this combination of the OdeG1 and the LeBrew Filter burrs to be very good.  You may not hit every single note, but it does surprise you from time to time.  For example, I have a bag of Black & White Pain Killer with a host of amazing flavors including keylime.  Not only did I get those notes, but I also got the crust for the keylime pie as well.  A shocking surprise to say the least

The Millab M01 is very different. I like different.  Otherwise, why bother, right?  This presents the flavor in an even or balanced cup.  The flavors flow from one to another.  A wonderful contrast to the OdeG1.  I still get a citrus juiciness at the start and the jamminess at the finish, but it doesn’t stand out.  It flows from one flavor to the next.  I guess like a tea would or fine wine.  The mouth feel is very similar to the OdeG1.  If there was a bean that just hits too hard, this could be the ticket without to resorting to adjusting the grind or water temperature to compensate

An interesting side note:  After a couple of hours of this, I brewed a cup from Prodigal.  Their Boulder Blend.  It’s been about 2 and half weeks off roast date and thought it would be good time as any to try it out on the OdeG1

Whoa.  The flavors were similar to what you’d get with the M01.  Flavors flowing from one to another like a fine wine.  So then I brewed it with the M01 and was pleasantly surprised.  It was better than the OdeG1.  A better separation and distinct flavor notes but with the flavors notes flowing from one to another 

I also brewed a few with the Comandante C40, with the XL crank and with the Spinspro motor.  And just for S&Gs, I brewed a cup or two with my modded Timemore Nano3 (new grind adjustment wheel and burrs that look like Kino M47 but smaller.  The baby Kinu)

The C40/XL Crank or with the Spinspro motor must be defective because the flavor notes were a mess.  I wasn’t able to pick out anything.  So I’m guessing something is amiss.  I will add though that the Spinspro motor at a set 200rpm, really makes for a fluffy grind, which allows a very fast draw down time.  You could grind finer with the Spinspro motor attached

The Nano3 or Baby Kinu, separated the notes, but there wasn’t much depth and some of the softer notes just wasn’t there or perhaps my palate wasn’t able to discern them.  But, I can see why I used it more than my C40 at the time

Which is better?

It all depends on your own tastes and preferences.  I don’t believe one is better over another.  Just different.  With the OdeG1 with LeBrew Filter burrs makes me wonder if I need to upgrade at all to a grinder that is above $1k?  I’ll come back to that question next year when I have the funds to seriously consider it

So where does the Millab M01 sit?

It is the opposite end of the spectrum from the OdeG1/LeBrew Filter burrs.  Where the OdeG1 separates each flavor notes much like ordering food ala carte, the M01 flows from one flavor to the next.  Allowing you to just enjoy the cup rather than analyzing and picking apart the individual flavor notes.  At some point along this journey, I’ve found that you just need to sit and enjoy the cup

When I got the OdeG1, I thought I had wasted my money with the M01.  However, with deadmyownresearch post, it had me reexamine both and now I appreciate both for what they offer.  I am forever grateful to deadmyownresearch for sending me down this path

Issue #1: Till now I've only made milk drinks as that is what my wife wants, and I'm content to join in. Today, however, she is out of sorts so I figured I'd try the espresso straight. I've had good espresso in France and Italy so have an idea what to expect. The coffee is Bird Rock (a reputable local grinder) from Costco. Yes it doesn't have a grind date, just a best-by date, which is mid-2026.

The espresso is sour. No other way to put it. I've had the grinder set at 7 (full left) from day one. Somewhere here I read that a Redditor liked their (other Jura) set at 3? What grind setting for you results in what sort of taste?

  
Issue #2: Tried ground coffee today, a freshly opened can of Illy Arabica Brasile Intenso. Great aroma right out of the can. Dumped in two measuring spoons into the chute, but it said ""not enough ground coffee"". Added two more, same message. Then on the third try (now it has 6 spoons), it yielded a cup. It was less sour than the beans, but still not great.

  
Attempted another ground coffee, without adding more. Same message, not enough ground coffee. WTH? The manual says to add no more than 2 level measuring spoons (I read this afterward) so now I'm worried I've effed up the machine, at least as far as ground coffee goes.",2,1758131108.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

It’s really just about the hook (first 3-5 seconds of a video). The ones that get views pick from the same few patterns:

Pattern 1: Hint towards the future or make a bold prediction about how things will be. *“This $20 tool will completely change how you handle weeknight dinners”.* This approach makes the viewer imagine what things could be like and makes them want to watch to find out how to get there.

Pattern 2: The Peer Experiment. Frame the content as a personal experiment or story, like hearing from a friend. “*I used AI to edit my TikToks daily for 30 days and got some crazy results.”* The key with this one is the creator is sharing results to someone on the same level, there is no hierarchy. It makes viewers think *“If they tried it and it worked, why can’t I?”*

Pattern 3: The Mentor. Position yourself as an expert and teach the solution. *“Stop wasting money on bottled cold brew. I’ll show you how to make barista-level coffee at home in 2 minutes.”* Viewers are drawn to this one because they don’t want to miss advice from an expert.

Pattern 4: The Mystery. Tease towards something unknown to drive curiosity. *“This looks like a regular water bottle… but there’s a reason it sells out every summer.”* Viewers tend to wonder “what is it that’s so special about that water bottle…” (or any product)

Pattern 5: The Disruptor. Be super blunt and challenge conventional wisdom. “*Most skincare routines are a waste of money - here’s the only step that actually matters.”* When someone is this confident about something that is outside the norm, viewers wonder why

The thing is - I only figured this out because I’ve been combing the internet for expert articles, watching video breakdowns, and doing deep analysis of videos that convert. Within each of these patterns there are dozens of micro-patterns beneath the surface that make it tough to get right.

I ended up building a tool that auto-writes Shoppable scripts with these hook patterns baked in. It’s free and there are a few beta spots left - mainly looking for feedback from people who deal with scripting every day. If you’re in this world, drop a comment and I’ll add you to the list.

Also curious if anyone has spotted other hook patterns I missed?",2,1758130945.0,SocialMediaMarketing,0,1.0,False

I smoked for around 17 years. I went from around a pack a day to 1.5 last year and realized I need to quit. I used every opportunity (excuse) I had to smoke. 

I could never quit longer than 1 day but after buying ""Easy way to stop smoking"" from Allen Carr I reached the 5th day today without smoking. 90% of the time I feel great and happy but sometimes I want to smoke one after work to decompress. After every meal or coffee my subconscious tells me: nice, now we can light up one! One second later a remind and disappoint myself that I quit and I get bumped out. I feel this is not me and start to feel disconnected with myself. From doing something every day to not do anymore is tough. 

At this moment I worry these thoughts will never pass and I will become a boring person because I don't feel ""I'm here"". Is there a rough timeline when you stop caring and just move on?",1,1758130943.0,stopsmoking,0,1.0,False

Editing video can drain the life out of you. Hours slip away adjusting fonts, syncing clips, and questioning why you even started. The stress is exhausting ... and it can break you!

That’s where tools like [Hypernatural AI](https://hypernatural.ai/?via=reviewjunkies) step in. They promise to save time and mental energy while giving you videos that look professional without the meltdown.

# 💵 Pricing Options

# 👩‍💻 Sabrina's Personal Experience

My friend **Sabrina**, a fellow blogger I swap SEO tips with over too much coffee, has been [experimenting with Hypernatural AI](https://hypernatural.ai/?via=reviewjunkies) for her side hustle. She runs a small online shop selling handmade candles and needed quick promo clips for Instagram without shelling out cash for a video editor.

She told me the first time she tried it, she typed a short script about a new lavender blend, uploaded a few photos, and in under ten minutes had a slick video complete with narration and captions. She said it was super easy **AI video creation for social media content**, but without the stress of learning editing software.

The one hiccup? When she tried swapping visuals halfway through, the lavender candle bizarrely morphed into something resembling a blueberry muffin. Not exactly on brand, but hilarious enough that she still sent me the clip. For her, the small glitch was an acceptable trade-off for the speed and ease - and honestly, she’s been using it ever since.

We weren’t super close friends before, just acquaintances who needed a place, and it made sense financially to split rent. At first it was fine. We split some groceries, cooked together here and there, and it felt manageable.

But little by little, she started eating my food. First, it was milk for her coffee, then eggs, then entire packs of chicken or my snacks I’d been saving. Even leftovers I’d labelled with my name would vanish. Every time I’d bring it up, she’d laugh it off or say she thought it was “ours.”

The thing is, I’m already in a tough spot financially. My credit’s wrecked from mistakes I made when I was younger, and I’m slowly trying to rebuild while staying on a strict budget. I don’t go out much, I cook at home, and I literally count every dollar. Meanwhile, she works full-time, goes out all the time, orders takeout whenever she wants, but still manages to clean out my stuff.

I tried talking to her about it more seriously, but she just brushed it off. That’s when I hit my breaking point.

So one weekend, I baked a tray of brownies. But not just any brownies. I made sure to lace them with a generous amount of extra-strength laxatives. I left them in the fridge, covered, like they were mine for later. And, of course, she helped herself.

Let’s just say karma hit fast. She spent the entire night running back and forth from the bathroom, moaning about food poisoning. I played dumb, offered her some water, and kept a straight face while she cursed whatever “bad takeout” she thought she ate.

After that, the food stealing dropped way off. She still sneaks the occasional bite here and there, but nothing like before. And honestly, I don’t even feel guilty. She had it coming.",70,1758130792.0,EntitledPeople,17,0.78,False

This is an event with varying skill levels, we have some players who just recently started playing magic, as well as some who have many years of experience. **The key here is that this is a friendly event for fun.** 

Additional context on the cube:

The cube is somewhat popular and is called “100 Ornithopters”, the gimmick being every creature in the cube is an ornithopters, and all other cards are there to support Ornithoper.

I was inspired to build it after watching the Rhystic Studies video about it! You can see the list of cards and the video in the links below:

I'll go to sleep at 9 or earlier and wake up at 12 noon the next day. And I'm still very tired when I wake up and just want to sleep more. Last night I went to sleep at 10, passed out immediately, and then slept hard until 9:30 when my husband was finally able to wake me. I always set alarms, I set them across the room or hide my phone, but I turn them off in my sleep! I'm a chronic sleepwalker and sleep talker, and no matter what I do to wake myself up at an appropriate hour, I turn off my alarms or have full conversations with my husband telling him to let me sleep in, only to wake up with no recollection of it. I get up and do things when I have dreams, or I'll walk myself to the bathroom and wake up there. I've also been frequently waking up either on my stomach or side, gasping for air as if I'd been suffocating in my sleep. I had a sleep test 2 years ago that said while I do have 9 secs of breath holding, it's not enough for a sleep apnea diagnosis.

 I wear a mouth guard for night time grinding. I go for long walks or runs as frequently as possible throughout the week and eat a mostly veg and meat gf and dairy free diet. I drink primarily water, take vitamins for iron, magnesium, vD3, fish oil, vB complex and myo inositol & d-chiro. I do drink 1 to 2 cups of coffee usually a day, although some days I don't have any or just a few sips.

 I don't want to have to sleep that long and I need to be able to get up at 6 am for my job without having to go to bed at 7 the night before. Does anyone have any suggestions? I also do prayer + mindfulness, along with having a fan blowing and blackout curtains for my bedroom. I'm at a loss for what to do.

 Conventional advice of putting my phone across the room only resulted in me turning them off in my sleep and getting bruises from running into things. ",1,1758130346.0,sleep,1,1.0,False
1njjmcg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1njjmcg/delve_into_the_best_coffee_maker_oxo_brew_and_see/,Delve Into the Best Coffee Maker OXO Brew and See If It Delivers,"Brewing the perfect cup of coffee became my new mission when I got my hands on the OXO 8721200. As someone who relies on coffee to kickstart the morning—and, let's be real, fuel my late-night Netflix binges—this machine promised versatility and convenience. Over weeks of testing, I discovered its strengths, quirks, and what it means for fellow coffee enthusiasts who prioritize both flavor and ease.

**Design and Build Quality**

Aesthetic and functionality intersect with this coffee maker’s sleek, stainless steel finish, blending beautifully with modern kitchens. The compact design at 12.25""x8""x14.5"" slips easily under standard cabinets, a relevant detail considering how bulky appliances can eat away counter space. The intuitive button interface stood out, simplifying my daily routine. I could program my morning brew even before my brain kicked in—no caffeine needed. Yet, the machine feels hefty at 15 pounds, which makes moving it around a bit cumbersome, though it speaks volumes about the build’s sturdiness.

**Performance and Brewing Options**

Here's where the magic happens. The OXO Brew’s capability to preheat water to temperatures between 194°F and 205°F is a game changer. This isn’t just marketing fluff—the temperatures stay consistent, ensuring rich, smooth coffee that meets the Specialty Coffee Association’s Golden Cup standard. I love how the dual-basket system offers flexibility. The smaller basket brewed a vibrant and aromatic single mug when it was just me, while the larger basket catered elegantly to family brunches or impromptu game nights with friends. Brewing is fast yet thorough, thanks to the rainmaker shower head that evenly saturates the coffee grounds.

[Check OXO 8721200 price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b0ccsvqzqs/)

**Good Points**

- Preheats water to optimal coffee brewing temperatures, delivering consistent flavor.
- Provides excellent options for brewing from single-serve portions to a full 12-cup carafe.
- Streamlined design complements most kitchen aesthetics.
- Includes accessories like a coffee scoop and paper filters for added convenience.
- Vacuum-insulated carafe keeps coffee hot for extended periods without overcooking.

**Negatives**

- The weight at 15 pounds makes moving it tricky if you want flexibility in placing it around.
- Condensation sometimes builds up inside, requiring a bit of extra effort to clean.
- The drip tray can feel slightly flimsy compared to the rest of the build.
- Single-serve brewing doesn’t feel entirely mess-free as the drip mechanism occasionally splashes.

**Cleaning and Maintenance**

If cleanliness is your obstacle to frequent coffee-making, this machine simplifies much of the usual fuss. The removable parts like the rainmaker, drip tray, and brew baskets are dishwasher safe (top rack), while the carafe and its mix tube require hand washing. I paired the cleaning process with OXO’s descaling solution, and the results were stellar—no residual buildup interrupted the smooth brew process.

**Key Benefits**

- Dishwasher-safe removable components speed up cleaning time.
- Easy-to-navigate interface enables schedule brewing with minimal effort.
- Versatile dual-basket system accommodates varied brewing needs efficiently.

**Product Comparisons**

Compared to other premium coffee makers like the Breville Precision Brewer or the Technivorm Moccamaster, the OXO Brew 12-Cup offers the added convenience of podless single-serve brewing. While the Moccamaster excels in minimalistic elegance, it lacks the programmability and podless adaptability that make the OXO attractive. On the other hand, Breville’s model competes well with similar temperature controls but leans more into specialty brewing modes, making it slightly overwhelming for casual users. In terms of cost-effectiveness, the OXO leans into everyday usability without an exorbitant price, positioning itself as the middle ground for both single-cup lovers and crowd brewers.

**Price to Quality Ratio**

Judging by the craftsmanship and versatility, this coffee maker offers value for its price. I wouldn’t call it the cheapest on the block, but the absence of costly pods (for single brewing) saves money in the long run. Plus, the precision brewing technology makes every cup worth savoring. If you’re like me and hate throwing money into expensive coffee shop lattes, investing here pays off not just in savings but also in better coffee.

Hope this helps anyone planning their trip

**Day 1: Abades | El Médano | Los Abrigos or Playa Amarilla**  
✔ Abades is quiet, good for snorkeling and has really amazing abandoned place.  
✔ El Médano has a local surf vibe.  
✘ Playa Amarilla can get crowded.

[Day 1: Abades | El Médano | Los Abrigos or Playa Amarilla](https://preview.redd.it/ituskqfxerpf1.png?width=2288&format=png&auto=webp&s=b688ce89dbf6cc667927b350d822812dab87202b)

**Day 2: Los Cristianos | Vilaflor | Teide National Park (Stargazing)**  
✔ Teide at night = highlight of the trip. Stargazing is incredible.  
✔ Vilaflor is a good coffee/pastry stop on the way.  
✘ Los Cristianos felt too touristy for me

[Day 2: Los Cristianos | Vilaflor | Teide National Park \(Stargazing\)](https://preview.redd.it/o3x92871frpf1.png?width=2324&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ca2834e88eb4b363c41583f65fab2f47f425d9e)

**Day 3: La Orotava | Puerto de la Cruz | La Laja/Rambla Castro**  
✔ La Orotava is charming, with history and architecture. You get to eat really well here.  
✔ Rambla de Castro is a great coastal walk.  
✘ Puerto de la Cruz was nice but very busy.

[Day 3: La Orotava | Puerto de la Cruz | La Laja\/Rambla Castro](https://preview.redd.it/v54lszx3frpf1.png?width=2286&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f06198b19c2453a695de83bb63a54cd777e1a90)

**Day 4: Icod de los Vinos | Chinyero | Alcalá**  
✔ Chinyero hike = volcanic landscape, less crowded than Teide. Good if you never seen volcanic landscape.  
✔ Alcalá has a nice coastal promenade and calm spots for swimming.  
✘ Icod’s Drago tree is iconic but felt underwhelming.



[Day 4: Icod de los Vinos | Chinyero | Alcalá](https://preview.redd.it/50ver907frpf1.png?width=2396&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a4eb70cab5a869a7defc8ccceaa4b826ca129a5)

**Day 5: Masca | Teno Alto | Punta de Teno | Garachico**  
✔ Masca is stunning, but parking is tricky. Better go by bus.  
✔ Punta de Teno = remote, worth the drive.  
✔ Garachico has natural pools, great for a swim.  
✘ Crowds in Masca take away some of the magic.

[Day 5: Masca | Teno Alto | Punta de Teno | Garachico](https://preview.redd.it/u1ski359frpf1.png?width=2344&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b161dc14f7df7bb1627f948c33f58fb2cf55c68)



**Day 6: Anaga Park | La Laguna | El Sauzal**  
✔ Anaga hikes are lush and wild. Amazing beaches if the weather allows.   
✔ La Laguna has a lively student vibe and colorful streets.  
✘ El Sauzal is small, nice for views and go for a swim but not essential.

[Day 6: Anaga Park | La Laguna | El Sauzal](https://preview.redd.it/ezzp0gybfrpf1.png?width=2318&format=png&auto=webp&s=11c66ec1f15fa8d51544c8635621bc7ff65806ff)

  
**Day 7: Santa Cruz | Playa de Las Teresitas or Benijo**  
✔ Santa Cruz is modern, with good food and shopping.  
✔ Playa de las Teresitas = calm golden sand beach.  
✔ Playa de Benijo = wild waves, black sand, amazing sunset.  
✘ Hard to do both beaches in one day, choose based on mood.



[Day 7: Santa Cruz | Playa de Las Teresitas or Benijo](https://preview.redd.it/8s06dvjefrpf1.png?width=2322&format=png&auto=webp&s=c464b886f3590f4bde6cc45d0d1cc65d1e90a1d0)

**Final Thoughts:**  
If I had to repeat only a few: Teide stargazing, Anaga hiking, and Benijo at sunset were unforgettable.  
What I’d skip: Los Cristianos, the Drago tree.

1njjin0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1njjin0/how_do_i_determine_the_right_type_of_hot/,How do I determine the right type of hot chocolate maker?,"Hey there! As someone who's been obsessed with making the perfect cup of hot chocolate at home, I thought I'd share my experience and help you choose the right hot chocolate maker. Trust me, I've gone through quite a few trials and errors to figure this out!

First things first, let's talk about what really matters when picking a hot chocolate maker. You want something that's going to give you that rich, creamy texture without any lumps or burnt chocolate taste. I recently discovered this amazing model (https://athometouch.com/hot-chocolate-maker) that's been a game-changer for my morning routine.

Here's what you need to consider:

Capacity:
Are you making hot chocolate just for yourself or the whole family? Most machines range from single-serve to 4-cup capacity. I'd recommend going for a larger one if you entertain often.

Temperature Control:
This is crucial! You want a machine that can maintain the right temperature without scorching the chocolate. The best ones have adjustable settings, letting you find that sweet spot between too hot and lukewarm.

Frothing Capability:
Nothing beats a frothy cup of hot chocolate! Look for models with built-in frothers or whisks. Some machines even have different settings for various drink types.

Cleaning Ease:
Trust me on this one - you want something that's easy to clean. Dried chocolate can be a pain to scrub off, so dishwasher-safe parts are a huge plus.

Additional Features:
Some hot chocolate makers come with cool extras like:
- Auto shut-off (a lifesaver when you're forgetful like me)
- Keep-warm function
- Multiple speed settings
- Non-stick coating

Price Range:
You don't need to break the bank, but don't go too cheap either. I've found that mid-range models like this one (https://athometouch.com/hot-chocolate-maker) offer the best balance of features and reliability.

Maintenance Tips:
- Clean after each use
- Use the right chocolate-to-milk ratio
- Regular descaling if you have hard water
- Check the warranty terms

I've noticed that machines with magnetic stirring systems tend to work better than those with just a heating element. They prevent that annoying burnt layer at the bottom and ensure even heating.

From my experience, versatility is key. Get something that can handle both powder and real chocolate. Some models even work great for making other drinks like chai lattes or warm milk for coffee.

Remember, the best hot chocolate maker for you depends on your specific needs. Consider how often you'll use it, your counter space, and whether you prefer traditional or modern features.

I hope this helps you make an informed decision! Let me know if you have any questions - I'm always happy to share more details about my hot chocolate making adventures!",1,1758130059.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

I hoard snacks like they’re going to disappear overnight, even when I can just buy more whenever. I feel guilty spending $5 on coffee because I grew up hearing “we have it at home.” And for some reason, I always end up paying for friends when we go out because I watched my parents do the same for relatives all the time.

None of these things seemed like a big deal until I started covering my own rent, food, and bills. That’s when it hit me that I’m carrying old habits that don’t really fit my life anymore. I’m trying to unlearn them slowly, saying no when I don’t actually have the money, not feeling like I need to play provider all the time, and allowing myself little things without guilt.

I think I have it narrowed down to the Drake and Entrada, but I'm open to your suggestions. 

The toilet is for a small coffee shop with a single restroom. It needs to be: 

* chair height/ADA 
* have an elongated bowl
* easy to clean 
* an overall, workhorse
* cost matters- I need the best bang for my buck, without sacrificing durability.

Toto's options are killing me- 1.28 vs 1.6, Tornado Flush vs. E-Max....

Can anyone offer advice on which Toto model for this setting?

Thank you!

Natasha Irons sat deep in thought. She had started her undercover mission only a week ago, and there was already too much information to keep track of. So many names to retain on all the different shifts, so many scattered opinions tossed around, and any time she tried to dig deeper, people looked at her strangely. She craved her notebook at home; it felt like the only way that she was keeping track of this case, but she couldn’t very well pull it out while she was at work. She started to run over the important details that she had learned so far in her head.

The company that she had been assigned to investigate was Sullivan Auto Parts, which reverse-engineered parts from car manufacturers in order to sell them at a cheaper price. She had been crammed into close quarters in order to operate manufacturing equipment in a location that wasn’t truly designed for it due to Sullivan’s previous manufacturing site exploding a month prior. It was that very explosion that she had been attempting to investigate.

The managerial staff was harsh. Nat had kind of expected them to be, but it was clear that the explosion had them on edge. Her shift manager had been forced to read them messages from the executives twice already in the past week detailing the efforts of the police to hunt down the missing culprit who had supposedly caused the explosion, and Nat’s coworkers had told her that this had been a fairly regular habit since the explosion. Nat didn’t really hold much against her shift manager specifically, since it was clear that he had been beaten down over his years at Sullivan, but the higher-ups boiled her blood. Pretty much everyone she had talked to at Sullivan had stories of the CEO, Rob Fitzwilliam. He was rude, greedy, and self-absorbed: all pretty standard for a CEO, but he particularly liked to walk the manufacturing floor, single out whoever he thought was working the slowest, and yell at them until they either broke down or started working significantly faster than their peers. Nat had seen him stalk the floor once already, and she hadn’t been his target, but she felt like if she had been, there would’ve been no force on Earth that would’ve stopped her from knocking him out with a punch or two.

The investigation itself had been tricky. Nat had been paired with a woman named Lisa her first few days in order to learn the ropes. Nat’s experience as Steel had given her the strength and mechanical know-how in order to do the work without much trouble, and she had hoped that it would give her more opportunities to talk to Lisa, but it just meant that Lisa noticed that Nat knew what she was doing and let her be sooner than if she had struggled. Nat had tried to reach out to her already, but she had struggled to make a real connection.

Nat sighed. Her break was almost over. Time to get up and back to work. She stood up, stretched, and made her way towards the door. Rounding the corner, she took a few steps back, surprised by who she saw making her way towards the break room.

Over a full head taller than Nat, with her voluminous auburn hair tied up and out of the way, was Maxima, walking with purpose towards the break room. Maxima passed Nat without breaking her stride, and Nat quickly turned around, hurrying after her.

“Max!” she hissed. “What are you doing here?”

Maxima didn’t stop walking, but as she turned the corner into the break room, she made eye contact with Nat, giving her a smile and wink. “It’s taken you a week already to solve this case. We need you on more pressing matters. Besides, I’m sure I can wrap this up by the end of the day.”

“By the end of the… Maxie, you just started!” Nat took a deep breath. “You know we aren’t at the actual crime scene, right?”

“Ah, but!” Maxima said, raising a finger. “I’ve already taken a look at the crime scene!”

“You… you have?” Nat asked.

“Mhm!” Maxima smirked. “And what’s more, I noticed that it looks like a dust fire.”

“That’s not necessarily new,” Nat sighed. “That’s been the reporting on the fire for weeks now.”

“But doesn’t it give us a place to start with our investigation?” Maxima asked. “Clearly the fault for this lies with the management here who let the conditions get that bad in the first place!”

“Sure,” Nat said, desperately trying to hold onto her patience. “But that still doesn’t get her off the hook if she caused the spark. We need to look for the direct cause or else we’ll have no evidence to stand on.”

“Hmm…” Maxima said, hands on her hips. “That’ll definitely prove more difficult.”

“It’s why I’ve taken so long on this case so far. Oh, my break’s been up for three minutes now!” Nat ran for the door, exasperated. “Talk after work?”

“Sure!” Maxima called after her. “We can figure this out together!”

SSSSS

It was five minutes after her shift ended, and Nat was loitering around the employees’ entrance, waiting for Maxima.

It was a summer night, hot and relentless. There was a bit of relief from the wind blowing off of Metropolis Bay, but it didn’t do much for Nat, especially after a long hard day of labour. She longed to get back home to her air conditioning, but she figured she should stand by her promise and work things through with Maxima. It wasn’t Maxima who emerged, though, but Lisa. The door closed shut behind her and she started to make her way towards the parking lot. Then, she paused.

“What are you doing hanging around here? Don’t you have somewhere better to be?”

“Oh,” Nat laughed, embarrassed. “Turns out one of my friends started here today. I’m waiting for her.”

“The tall redhead?” Lisa raised an eyebrow. “What could the two of you have in common?”

“You could say we run in similar spaces,” Nat explained.

“Oh, y’all are gay?”

“Yeah.” Wasn’t even a lie, really; Maxima was bi.

“Well…” Lisa sniffed. “I can understand being tired of men.”

Nat’s brow furrowed. “Something wrong with the men in your life?”

Lisa waved her hand in the air. “Oh, you know… they’re fine. My boyfriend and I both work so much, we barely have time for each other anymore, but that’s just life. It’s mostly the men around here that you gotta watch out for.”

“Can you tell me any more?” Nat asked.

“Oh, well…” Lisa laughed. “You’ve seen Rob already, I’m sure. You might have noticed that he tends to target the women here more. Don’t get on his bad side if you can avoid it. Beyond that…” she trailed off for a moment, lost in thought, before regaining her composure. “Some of the guys, the ones that cozy up to management… they come in drunk sometimes. Nobody cares to tell them off, as long as they meet their quotas. But it’s dangerous.”

“You think that’s what caused it?”

Lisa shrugged. “I can’t really say. We don’t have any usable camera footage. But what I can say is that if you look at the people who were there… the people that died… a couple of them definitely were in the habit of showing up a few drinks in.”

Maxima burst out the door, pushing it away with force. It rebounded back towards her, but she managed to catch it before it hit her. Locating Nat, she smiled and gave her a nod. “Natasha!”

“Looks like she’s ready. See you around?” Lisa said, turning away from Nat. “Oh, and don’t go spreading this stuff around or Rob’ll have my hide.”

“No problem,” Nat told her.

“So?” Maxima asked. “How are we going to handle this?”

“I think I might’ve just gotten what we need,” Nat said.

“Really? What that woman told you not to spread around?”

“Listen,” Nat said, looking Maxima straight in the eyes. “A woman’s life hinges on this. We won’t let it out that it was her who said it, obviously, but we’ll do some investigation online, see if we can pull up some DUI charges for the people involved. All we’re going to need is some solid evidence that can create some reasonable doubt in court, and then we’re done!”

“Let’s treat this with discretion, then, and get this done!” Maxima said.

“Of course.”

SSSSS

Jon,

Thanks for reaching out. I wanted to report back to you with the information that I found through my investigation.

Analysis on the scene confirms that this was a dust fire, likely made possible by Sullivan Auto Parts’ unsafe working conditions, as observed in Attachments 1 and 2. They’ve failed safety tests in the past, and while they’ve made some changes, there’s no evidence that they’ve done enough to make this a safe workplace.
Additionally, beyond that, some of the men killed in the explosion include those with a history of turning up to work under the influence. Specifically, I’d like to refer you to the case of Jordan Mathieson. There’s more information in Attachment 3, but he was arrested for a DUI on the way to work, which certainly implies the possibility of him or one of his coworkers causing the explosion.

Considering that most of the evidence pinning Ms. Sparks to the scene is circumstantial at best, I hope that this is enough to help prevent her from being taken to court. You can find a summary of my investigation in Attachment 4.

I know journalism isn’t my field, but I hope that this is enough for you to work with. I’ll keep my position here a few more days at least, so let me know if you need anything.

Natasha

“That’s it?” Aubrey asked. “Doesn’t seem like hard evidence.”

“In cases like these, you don’t have hard evidence a lot of the time,” Jon explained. “In most cases I’ve been in, actually, the only hard evidence has been my say-so, just because I can see so much more than most people.”

“And because people generally trust you,” Aubrey chimed in.

“Yes, that too. Honestly, if they really want to take you to trial for this, they probably still can, but I think they’d struggle to convict you.”

“So what do we do now?” Aubrey asked. “I just… go home?”

“If you want,” Superman confirmed. “I can get you home within the hour.”

“I think I would like that,” Aubrey said. “Thank you. Oh, and one more thing! Can you get me in contact with the woman who found this evidence for me? Natasha?”

“Of course. Just whistle when you’ve got your things together and are ready to head out, I’ll be right there.”

“Could you just grab my things? You’ll move faster than I could, anyways.”

By the time Aubrey finished speaking, Superman was there with everything that she had brought with her to the Fortress. She smiled. “Alright, let’s head back.”

Superman didn’t stick around after dropping her off, but she didn’t really expect him to. She took a deep breath. She was free again.

SSSSS

“Good to see you’re safe,” Nat said, slowly sipping on some coffee. She was sitting across from Aubrey in a cafe on a sunny Metropolis evening.

“Thanks,” Aubrey smiled. “It was all thanks to your help. Why did you want to meet with me, again? I feel like I already said most of what I wanted over email.”

“First off, I wanted to treat you to something. Give you a chance to unwind a bit, relax, you know? But beyond that… I know you’ve been around Superman a lot. How has he been? I’m worried about him.”

“Thanks,” Aubrey said, taking a moment to drink her coffee. “This is really good, thanks for the recommendation.”

“I know what’s good.” Nat smiled.

“Superman? Honestly, I don’t know. I don’t think I trust him as much as I used to.”

“Never meet your heroes?”

Aubrey chuckled. “Something like that. I just think that you and the rest of your friends should keep a close eye on him. Bring him into your board game nights or whatever else you do to keep in contact. I know he’s Superman and all, and he has solid character, but I’ve been around lonely men like that, and he’s going to need whatever support you can give him.”

“Thanks for the advice. I’ll try to keep it in mind.”

Aubrey looked out the window behind Nat as the two of them drank their coffee. Metropolis was beautiful in the golden hour. She was incredibly happy to be back within its streets once more, and she had a good feeling about not ending up prosecuted for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

She had hope, and she wished that Superman would manage to hold onto whatever hope remained for him, as well.

Explanation:

The smoke in cigs contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, those induce the CYP1A2 enzyme in your liver.

In chronic smokers caffeine half life drops from 5–6 hours to about 3–4 hours, thats roughly a 30–50% reduction.

The more you smoke the more tolerant you are to caffeine and the faster you metabolize it, now commercial cigs are pretty harmful, so just use the ones that cause less harm, which would be 100% pure tobacco rolled cigarettes.

I wanna start by saying sorry this is so long but as I’ve seen in other posts, I feel like they’re the more detail the better responses and opinions I will get. Not sure really where to start so I might ramble and jump all over.

I 43(M) and my wife 38(F) have been married for 10 years and together for little over 17.  We have two kids boy 15 and girl 8.  I have gone through lots of therapy over the last few years to work on a lot of things with myself and my relationship etc.  I will be the first to say I have made my share of mistakes over these 17 years some she knows about whether being caught or me even admitting to things and some she doesn’t.  I also want to say anything she’s caught or found out about was never anything physical, “only” talking or texting etc.  I say only not to downplay but to acknowledge she has never caught me physically with anyone else.  She has done some things as well but years and years ago one going back to 2009 and while it bothers me that I found out 2 years after our son was born I will never know all the details or truth.   The other things were very minor but I add these because she was always someone who was VERY VERY anti cheating. She even said at the beginning of our relationship if she felt like it was gonna happen she would break up with me rather than do that.  She’s had a rough past with bad relationships and trust has always been a thing for her even pre anything from me.

The reason for my post is something she did a few years ago that has come back into my brain and my anger is so much this time.  Last year I was wrongfully terminated from a job I loved and feel back into a deep depression and what I found out from therapy is I deflect my anger and depression on her by finding things to get mad at her about.  I went through extensive practice of Radical Acceptance where I was able to work past those things from so long ago.  This one though I didn’t work on and now I was laid off from another job and the depression and deflecting is back with the situation from 5 years ago.

The situation:  We made a purchase at Home Depot and the patrol furniture was damaged. We do a of business there like a lot. so we talked to the manager and he offered to deliver a replacement.  Stupidly (I was working at the time far from home she worked down the from our home) I had her give the manager her number to arrange everything.  At some point they started texting regularly.  She said all long she was using him for discounts etc.  I was uncomfortable because I’m a guy and I know how we operate but I embarrassingly let it go.  Having no idea the texting was continuing and it had progressed into pretty regular conversations.  One morning her phone went off and it was a text from him the phone was next to me woke me up and I looked at the notification.  445am a text about having his morning coffee.  I’ll be honest I don’t remember the exact wording and I didn’t think to even look at the other messages something that now haunts me.  At some point after I saw she text him a photo of her sitting on the floor of the gym the photo was her black leggings and sneakers nothing sexual or provocative but again I didnt look at other messages.  Then again there was a screenshot of the Tiesto song The Business and message I don’t remember and this is where I finally approached her again never thinking to read the entire thread.   There is a tiesto from from 2007 that is OUR song.  I actually got him to play it at a concert which was pre planned to help me propose. It was the song we came out to at our wedding.  So clearly Tiesto is an important thing to us.  So having her “share” a Tiesto song with another man was to much.  Especially a song like that with some shady meanings.  It was so long ago  I don’t remember if I brought everything up or just the coffee text.  She assured me it was nothing and all friendly and claims to have ended it etc. 

Now around that time 2019/2020 I was talking to someone at my work and it slowly got serious.  I cut it off but again was in a bad depression I drove to her work and admitted everything breaking down on how I need to change need therapy etc.   so a part of me feels this “relationship” with him started as “payback” and possibly turned into more. 

Flash forward to how.  She asked me to look for an email for her and doing a search I found an email to him from 1/2020 of her resume, again nothing bad nothing flirty and there were no others.  This was two months or so after telling her about the girl at work and quite a few months (I think) after he delivered the new patio furniture I haven’t said anything about it.  The other we lost our dog of 17 years recently and I have been going through old pictures to make a slide show.  She always takes the most pictures so I was on our iMac looking at old pictures and in 2020 I found tons of selfies (some with kissy faces) pictures of her legs laying out by our pool, and outfit pictures. And one picture of her post shower in a towel but it’s very low showing red sun burn on her chest.  No nudity no face.  And the outfit ones none were provocative but some had semi low cut and some were def Snapchat ones with filters.    None of those were sent to me so now my anger is who were they for.  My brain immediately goes to they were sent to him due to the timeframe   Also none of that was brought up as I don’t know how and don’t want her thinking I’m snooping.  And anytime I’ve ever brought up past things she gets defensive deflects it back to my and things I’ve done or just shrugs it off as nothing.

I think why I’m having so much of a hard time dealing with this is for 2 reasons.  The first it’s stuff she doesn’t do with me.  How could she be more comfortable sending photos no matter how innocent to another man but not to me.  I still try and keep a spice and be flirty and it is almost never reciprocated back. She has also never been a very sexual person I’ve learned to live with it because I love her but again how could she send another man kissy faces(if they were for him)  the second reason is because I feel like such a loser pussy that I saw all those messages, didn’t say fuck it and snoop but also didn’t confront him directly man to man and what the fuck is this it better end.  If the role was reversed and she’s done it to me I should have confronted him or took more of a stand. I could have and should have been more of a man and handled it back then when it was fresh.  Again therapy has helped me be more able to confront things than I was in my past.   I addressed the situation last year and it was just shrugged off and I can’t understand how she someone so anti anything cheating can see nothing wrong with any of this especially the tiesto part.  It haunts me daily especially at night because I will never know how far it went.  Also I’m feeling more and more like she isn’t attracted to me anymore.  She will often deny sex to sleep.  We never have dates because of our kids being so active in sports and other things.   I still am the one to be flirty or send her sexy texts and it’s never again reciprocated back

Not sure what to do if I work on the radical acceptance, talk about my reasons why I feel I can’t get past it with my therapist, or even attempt to bring it up to her but in a calm and explaining way acknowledging my reasons above  ",0,1758129507.0,AmIOverreacting,2,0.5,False

This morning I made a delivery order to my hotel from Starbucks. It was cheaper to go through the sbux app than via DD. The delivery fee through the sbux app was $1.99 and DD it was $6.99 (I don’t pay for dash pass). 

Now - I do some temp contracts for the career field I’m in, and I still Dash a couple hours a week to keep my delivery count, to keep platinum so I can dash now - anywhere I’m at.

However, when I ordered - I left a $5 tip for my single coffee for the driver and when she arrived, I asked her to check to make sure she got the tip - since I never usually do ordering through different apps that are ‘powered by DD’. I showed her my screen. She showed me hers. It showed I paid the $5 and on her side it shows $0 tip!!!!!! Now I’m wondering and concerned if DD is stealing tips from orders via a different app…

On top of that, they only gave her $2.00 base pay and this sbux was 2.3 miles from the hotel (so I guess the scaling isn’t too different). I made sure to get her cashapp and tip her accordingly bc that’s so wrecked. Now I’m wondering if these $2 orders is DD putting us on a wild goose hunt for their tiers and them stealing and profiting off of people to a larger extent. This is so concerning. I’m a little salty, bc I too am a dasher and bc I am trying to keep platinum (I float right on the line regularly) and have had no choice but to take garbage orders.

1njj7sj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1njj7sj/how_to_know_when_to_call_it_quits/,How to know when to call it quits?,"My (26M) wife (26F) and I have been married for five years. We have two children who are 13 months and 2.5 years old. We have had many ups and downs like everyone else but always seem to work through our problems together. Recently though I've been finding it hard to find a reason to stay in this marriage besides our two children. Let me give some context.

My wife and I have been together since we were 17. We married at 21 and had our first kid at 23 and our second at 24/25. As I said before our time together was really good for a while. We went through a rough patch when were engaged where we almost called off the wedding because of some argument I can't even remember. Once we realized how stupid this was we were able to become closer and stronger together. We then got married and had fights like everyone else but never anything to crazy. My wife had always seemed very loving and affectionate towards me and I was madly in love with her. This changed however when we decided to try for kids. My wife got off birth control and we started trying. It took us almost a entire year but eventually she became pregnant. During this time when we were trying though she became so angry every month she did not get pregnant. She didn't want to be comforted and it seemed like she just wanted to give up. She started fighting over everything it didn't seem to matter what it was about, she just wanted to take her anger out on something. I thought it was the stress of the situation so I let it slide. When she got pregnant things seemed to cool down so I thought for sure it was just the stress until we had our first child and she went back to be angry all the time. I know that this was caused by her hormones and she was diagnosed with PPD. She started on an antidepressant and I took on a lot more responsibility with the house work and child care. We then had our second kid, which was a one off time that surprised us both. Now to present time.

Recently I have felt checked out of our relationship. My wife and I just do not seem connected at all. Before anyone says it's because I'm not helping her it's not true. Normally what our day looks like is she gets the kids ready for daycare and takes them. I have to be at work earlier so I don't deal with them in the morning because that would mean I would have to wake them before they need to wake up. She is a teacher and the daycare is right next to her school so she picks them up at 4PM and is usually home with them around 4:15PM. I got off at 4PM and am usually home around 4:30PM. I cook dinner about 95% of the time and usually while I'm cooking I'll help play with the kids, while I cook. We normally are done eating around 6PM and spend time with our kids together until they go to bed. Our youngest goes to bed around 7:30PM and our oldest around 8:30PM. I usually let her put the youngest down so she can have more free time to herself. Once I put our oldest down I begin to clean the kitchen and living room and am usually done around 9 or so. During this time I just let my wife relax and take time to herself. Her mom is retired and comes to clean our house and do laundry every Wednesday. She likes to do it and we appreciate the help, so these are things neither of us really have to do unless we feel it is necessary in the moment. Overall my wife doesn't have to do much house work if any most days. This brings us to the problem I've been having recently. I feel as if our sex life has gone completely down the drain. We average maybe once every other week, which I know is normal for some people but it's not normal for me. We are still young and we use to have a great sex life. Its how I feel connected to her but she never seems as if she is interested in it all. I always have to initiate and it always seems like I'm just inconveniencing her. We only do it in the morning because she is to tired at night. I always try to warm her up to it and I make sure she gets hers when we do have sex, so it's not like its just for my pleasure. 

I've had talks to her about how it bothers me that she never initiates and it seems to never be on her mind. She says it's not something that is on her mind and she enjoys it while it's happening but she just doesn't think about it. I know this is called responsive desire and I get it but I want to be desired too. I told her that it makes me feel as if inconveniencing her when I try to initiate. She said this isn't true but recently she's been getting mad at me because she says she doesn't have time to sit in the morning and drink coffee before our kids are up and it's making her snappy with me when we do have sex in the morning. Then she told me it was my fault she's pissed off on those days. It kind of proved my point that sex is inconvenient for her. The only things I ask of her is to be kinder to me and to try and work on our intimate issues. She hasn't done either while I've done everything she's asked of me. I pack the kid's lunches at night so all she has to do is get them up and dressed in the morning. I've started working on more things in the house that she wants done. I've spent more alone time with her when she wants it. I do the nightly house work every night by myself. I've done everything I can to make her feel connected and less stressed but she hasn't put in any effort to my wants and needs. I feel like I'm not asking for much. Just to be nicer and to have more of an intimate relationship. 

I feel like I've just put in way more effort and she is doing way less than me. I am the breadwinner and recently have been to promoted to where it feels like we are finally saving money again. There's no financial stress I'm putting on her and I'm trying to make our life as comfortable as I can. I just feel checked out at this point and I'm just resenting her. Every time I try to talk to her she gets defensive and says she will do better and she tries for a day and it's back to normal for her after. I really want to be there for my kids but I feel like I can't be my normal happy self around them because I'm so unhappy in my marriage. I feel like I'm ready to call it quits but I'm not sure if it's the right decision. What do you guys think?",2,1758129403.0,Marriage,1,1.0,False
1njj7ie,https://www.reddit.com/r/UsedAndRated/comments/1njj7ie/explore_if_the_best_cold_brew_coffee_maker_by/,Explore if the Best Cold Brew Coffee Maker by Takeya 10310 Delivers,"Using the Takeya 10310 Cold Brew Coffee Maker over the past few weeks has been quite an enlightening experience for me, as a bit of a coffee enthusiast looking to perfect my at-home cold brew game. Its sleek and minimalistic design initially caught my eye, seamlessly blending into my kitchen setup. For its size, this coffee maker really packs a punch, offering convenience and simplicity without skimping on quality. Whether you're entertaining guests or simply craving your morning caffeine fix, this compact gadget promises to deliver rich, smooth results every time.

**Ease of Use and Design**  
The first thing I noticed was how effortless the process of brewing with this system is. Unlike larger, more complicated machines with dozens of functions I rarely use, this cold brew maker is straightforward. All you need to do is fill the included fine-mesh filter with your favorite coffee grounds, add water, and let it steep overnight in the fridge. I loved that the thin profile fits perfectly in my refrigerator door, saving valuable shelf space. The durable BPA-free Tritan material feels sturdy, and the black finish lends a modern touch. The non-slip silicone handle is a thoughtful addition, providing a firm grip even when pouring directly into glasses.  

[Check Takeya 10310 Cold Brew Coffee Maker price on Amazon.](https://kepmad.com/p/b00ffly64u/)

**Performance and Brewing Quality**  
One of the features that impressed me the most is the fine-mesh coffee filter. It does an exceptional job of keeping coffee grounds out of the brewed liquid, resulting in smooth, sediment-free coffee. This was a relief since I've encountered other systems that left bits at the bottom of the pitcher. What stood out, though, was how much less acidic the cold brew tasted compared to traditional methods. The smoothness made it easier on my stomach, and the flavor was robust enough to pair well with milk or sweeteners without losing its bold notes. My cousin, who’s particularly picky about coffee, even told me it tasted better than the coffee shop!  

**Highlights**  
- Creates smooth and less acidic coffee, perfect for sensitive stomachs.  
- Compact design fits in most refrigerator doors, saving kitchen space.  
- Fine-mesh filter prevents grounds from sneaking into your brew.  
- BPA-free and made from stain-resistant Tritan material for durability.  
- Comfortable silicone handle enhances ease of pouring.

**Areas of Concern**  
That being said, no product is perfect, and this one has its own quirks.  
- The 1-quart capacity could feel a bit limiting if you’re brewing for a larger group or entertaining often.  
- The brewing time requires planning ahead, as it takes several hours to achieve the desired flavor.  
- Not ideal for those who prefer hot coffee most of the time, even though the materials can handle heat.  
- The fine filter, while effective, can be slightly tricky to clean thoroughly.  

**Competing Brands**  
In comparison to other cold brew makers I've tried, this one holds its ground in terms of simplicity and build quality. For example, a glass-based brewing system I used in the past looked elegant but was much less durable and prone to breakage. While some competitors offer similar designs with larger capacities, they often lack features like the airtight lid, which keeps the coffee fresh longer. I also tested an electric option, but its bulky size and reliance on electrical outlets made it less versatile than this manual, transport-friendly alternative.  

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Given its durable construction and thoughtful design, this product strikes a good balance between quality and investment. Sure, there are cheaper alternatives out there, but they rarely provide the same ease of use, consistency, and sleek design. In this case, spending a bit more on a product that lasts longer and performs better feels worth it to me, especially if you regularly enjoy cold brew.

Because “fidelity cards” aren’t so efficient, safe and the clients forgot to bring to them or simply lost it I created for him(I’m web developer) a website that allows small businesses to implement their own reward program only using a mobile phone and a Internet connection.

It’s very flexible, instead of ""stamping"" cards, you just scan the customer’s QR code, send the desired number of points to a user, and decide what those points can be exchanged for - free products, prizes, discounts, badges...you choose!

Also, the business dashboard displays all transactions, including the user’s email and date. Accounts for both customers and businesses can be created in under a minute using Google Sign-In.

1njj1xb,https://i.redd.it/4a0ru8nacrpf1.jpeg,"Is this a haunting? My home, body, and luck are falling apart","TL;DR: For ~2–3 years something odd has been targeting my life — stains, shadows, physical symptoms (scalp pictured above), lost items, and bad luck — starting around my dog Kobie’s illness; I’ve tried doctors, pest control, cleansings, and repairs and nothing helps. Desperate for advice.

—
My attempt at “summarizing”:

Hi everyone, I’ve been hesitant to post this, but I feel like I’m at a point where I can’t ignore what’s happening anymore. Physically and practically my life has been unraveling and something bigger than me feels like it’s taking over my life. 

This all started about three years ago, around the time my dog Kobie was diagnosed with kidney failure. He was always such a strong, independent dog — walks with me were the only time he was truly attached — but during that period, he became unusually dependent and needy, almost like he knew something bad was coming.

Shortly before this past Christmas, my mom called me crying, saying that Kobie probably wouldn’t make it to Christmas. When I came home for the holiday, he wasn’t the Kobe I knew — he was weaker, more clingy, and strangely dependent on me. That Christmas break felt heavier because we became closer in this strange, intense way.

The first week of January, I got really sick — vomiting in unusual shapes — and that’s when a freak accident at work happened. Someone came late to my yoga class and dropped a glass water bottle. I tried to clean it up myself, injured my hand, fainted, and was fired for not following “proper protocol,” even though there was no first aid kit. Fighting it through HR didn’t work, and that incident marked the start of a chain of chaos in my life.

Around the same time, my paranormal experiences began escalating. Three years ago, i was having sleep paralysis where a creepy hand was beside me holding me down. At the beginning of this year, I woke up all morning with my hands, inflamed, and my boyfriend had even said like they look like old lady hands. Then, I started seeing dark shadows in Kobie’s room while he was still alive. He screamed in pain at night, and marks would appear where he had been. I now see these same marks everywhere. My body and skin feel stretched, my scalp is a mess (added a pic), my hair suddenly went red (I’m normally brunette doing blonde), and sensations of being physically “squished” or pulled. My boyfriend recently slept over and felt something pressing on his chest.

My apartment has become unmanageable to handle: Garbage trails follow me, hair clippings, and even my foot clippings vanish. Appliances echo after I turn them off. Chairs move when no one’s there. Stains and garbage trails follow me everywhere — my apartment, my parents’ house, even my car. No matter how much I clean, sweep, or vacuum, nothing makes a difference. Pest control, environmental checks, and professional cleaning haven’t solved anything. I spent $7k to fix my car, BMW told me that I wasn’t going crazy and that my oil engine had a leak because there was some chewing or tampering with the wiring there and then it looked like someone had dumped like over a gallon of coffee in the centre console so right underneath my armpit would rest.

Looking back when this whole thing started bad stuff was happening, but I just kept thinking like OK that’s not in alignment with me I guess and I just kept trying to stay positive and even with the lucid dreaming I was like I don’t wanna give whatever this is power. For example, two years ago, my best friends since high school randomly ghosted me — shortly after I ended my engagement. I hadn’t fully opened up about it, but even now, looking back, I realize they should have supported me especially after a ten year friendship. Around that same period, I was fired from my full-time marketing job. I pivoted to teaching yoga and Pilates, and things were going really well… but it seems like whatever is following me isn’t happy with me making the best of my life.

Since then, I’ve had freak accidents, lost opportunities, and even tried spiritual cleansing, church visits, and professional help — including a scam “black magic” clearing that cost me money. Nothing works. It’s reached a point where I can’t even do the things I love anymore. I can’t stretch in yoga or Pilates without feeling wrong in my body. I’m all frazzled things fall out of my hands or I drop things and I can’t form proper sentences sometimes if someone asked me a question. Things randomly appear, stains show up, and I feel like I’m being physically pulled down — like gravity itself is against me.

I feel trapped in my own body and my own space. I haven’t even been able to properly grieve Kobie because I’m fighting something I don’t understand, and it’s isolating. My fingers randomly turn black, and I feel like my beauty and energy are being stripped away.

Sometimes I feel like my place is mirroring my grandmother’s i was named after. I wake up and catch myself standing or moving like her, and it’s unsettling — one morning my hands looked like old lady hands. She had stains everywhere in her home, mostly water stains, but as a kid I always thought they looked like eyes and i remember always being weirded out by certain objects in her house. Now, I have similar marks, and it creeps me out. The day after she died, there was a bird watching me and Kobie. Once, while vacuuming my apartment in frustration, I looked out at my porch — I live near an airport on the top floor — and there was that same bird staring at me from the side. I’ve heard that we sometimes “pay for the sins of our grandparents or ancestors,” and sometimes I feel like that might be what’s happening to me. My grandparents worked incredibly hard for money, and they would have done anything for it — and now, being basically broke, it makes me question if some of this is tied to them. A friend once told me that spirits can latch on and make you think they’re familiar when they’re not. Thinking about it this way has made me feel conflicted about my grandparents, even though I know it’s not fair — and yet, the experience feels eerily similar or connected to them. I’ve asked for clarity on what this is but it doesn’t reveal itself. It stays hidden enough to cause stress on day to day living while making me look messy, disoriented, stupid and repulsive. 

Has anyone experienced anything like this? Even advice on how to reclaim your space, body, and energy when something invisible seems to be actively harming you would be helpful. I’m desperate.

If you made it this far, thank you so much for reading. I know this is long and a lot to take in — I just can’t think straight these days and I’m doing my best to get it all out. I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to listen and share advice.

I'm pretty new to running (have been at it for under a year) and have been training for the past couple of months for a marathon. However, I have a pretty bad habit of running without fuel. This is just because my typical morning routine goes like this: wake up, drink a coffee, poop, leave to run. Since I try to be out for a run (especially a long run) before 6 am I have never felt like I've had time to eat. I have also never tried eating during a run. Both of these are mostly out of fear of how it'll affect my stomach and digestion. I've had water and Gatorade during a run but nothing beyond that.

  
My runs are staring to get longer- I've reached double digits (time wise I'm at about 2 hours/10 miles) and will soon try to start pushing past half marathon distance. I'm guessing continuing to run fasted is not the best idea.

  
Where should I start in terms of fueling? Do I really need to eat during runs? WTF is a gel? When I do shorter runs (like less than an hour) is fasted okay?

Hey folks,



I’ve been working on a small side project called AI Explains This Repo: [https://ai-explains-repo.vercel.app/](https://ai-explains-repo.vercel.app/)



Basically, you paste a GitHub repo link and it gives you a human-friendly summary — like a senior engineer walking you through the codebase. It looks at key files, dependencies, and structure, then explains the repo in plain English.



Why I built this:

• As a student, I often get lost opening random repos. Docs are missing, READMEs are outdated, and sometimes you just want the TL;DR.

• I wanted something beginner-friendly — not just parsing code, but actually explaining the big picture.



How it works:



Paste any public repo URL.



My backend skims important files & metadata.



You get a clean summary with features, use cases, and next steps.



It’s free to use. If it saves you time, there’s an option to “buy me a coffee” to help with hosting. Totally optional — feedback is honestly more valuable right now.



Would love to hear your thoughts:

• Does this actually solve a pain point for you?

• What features would make it more useful (e.g., deeper code walkthroughs, diagrams, etc.)?



Appreciate you checking it out 🙏

This way, you’re positioning yourself as:



\* \*\*Maker → not a spammer.\*\*

\* \*\*Asking for feedback → not just donations.\*\*

\* \*\*Sharing your journey → people love supporting solo devs.\*\*

1njirwv,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1njirwv/ever_since_my_son_was_born_it_was_been_watching/,"Ever since my son was born, It was been watching him [Final Part]","To pre-phrase this part, I am currently writing this first section before I meet up with the man who sent the letter. I appreciate the little help I got and the words of caution. The situation from my last post hasn't changed much. Iris, Luke, Archie, and I are still at my mother's place. Those things haven't come back. I was prompted to try Google to search for any information about the coins I was given. After a moment of poorly scouring the internet, I eventually found what I was looking for. The Coins are Greek Drachma. I almost glossed past them, however, as the one that was sent to me in the mail seems to be a less common version. I remembered the one that was tossed into my car, resembling the Owl imagery that also appears on a lot of the images I could find online. I also later found the Coin underneath my car seat. I hadn't removed it since it was tossed in there months back. 

This may seem a little scatterbrained; Im just nervous about meeting with this thing… or at least the thing feels right to say. Assuming it's the same guy from the gas station. I've got Archie staying here while im out. He has his gun, and we know that, for whatever reason, the police at least work to scare these things away. I also just spoke with Iris. I finally told her. She was in the kitchen, still noticeably shaken after what had happened. She's a strong woman, though; it's what caught my attention when we first met, though over the years I've been able to pick up on her tells. It's small things, like little glances or uncomfortable smiles, that give her away. I approached her, asked her how she was doing, and once we had started talking. I told her. I told her about the bird stalking our son, about the split-faced creature that came into our home and threw me to the wall… how I think those things that attacked us not too long ago were connected to it. 

I even told her how it all seems to be happening because they are after Luke. 

“Why are they after our son?” She asked with a great sense of dread.

“I dont know”  


“Do you think it's some sort of punishment?”

“Punishment for what?” 

“I dont know... he wasn't exactly born in the best of circumstances” 

“I dont think we're being punished for our baby surviving that night. Also, we weren't the only ones.” 

“But the cops said-” she said before I cut her off.

“I know what the cops said… but those things clearly aren't normal.”

Iris paused for a moment, taking a deep, shaky breath. In the silence, I had realised i raised my voice, not in any way that would warrant worry, but it brought me back to before she got pregnant, the fights we had. I wasn't proud of how I was, but before the thought could linger any further, she asked. 

“So what are we gonna do?” 

“I dont know. I did get a letter, though. Remember that weird guy at the gas station I mentioned?”

“The one with the cut-up face, yeah?”

“I think he wants to meet with me. I dont know if it's safe, but I feel he might have some answers.”

She didn't like the idea as much as I did, but we decided it'd be better to try and get some answers than to keep being in the dark. So Im about to drive over there. The rest of this post will be from me once I get back.

\-break-

So I drove out to the place that was listed, a small cafe just a few blocks away from my mom's apartment. It wasn't any brand I recognised, so I assumed it was a family-owned business since it didn't give off the vibe of some smaller privately owned shop. I stepped inside, the place being a bit on the empty side, with only 2 other people in there besides me and the staff. Just some old man sat at the counter reading a newspaper, and a scruffy-looking man was about college age. 

After ordering a plain coffee at the counter, I went over and sat down at one of the empty tables. I was sitting alone for probably a few seconds before a man sat down across from me. I hadn't seen him come in, though, with everything that's happened in the last few months, and that didn't surprise me. He didn't look like anyone I had met; he had olive skin, dark brown curly hair and youthful features. Despite the difference in appearance, one thing remained from the man i knew him to be. His cheeks, sunken in as if slit or cut, stretched out his mouth despite not connecting to the corners of his soft smile. “Alex… it is good to see you again.” He said, his voice soft and calming, just like last time. This time, I was a lot more to the point. 

“Who are you… and no cryptic shit or changing the subject, weird shit has been happening to me ever since I met you at that gas station, now talk” 

“I will, though I'd keep your voice down. I chose this place because it was close, and barely anyone comes here, though that does not mean no one will hear you speak.”

I was stressed, but he was right. After taking a second to focus on what I wanted to ask next, I quieted down and asked. 

“A name would be a good start. Who are you?” 

“Your people have many names for me”

“I said no cryptic shit” 

“I do not mean to be cryptic; it is simply a difficult question to answer for someone in my position… I believe Gabriel is what the Christians called me, though that was because I snuck myself into their beliefs when the Romans were shifting over. The oldest name I remember is Piled Stones. Hermes and Mercury are the ones I've known the longest, though. Some Romans also called me Odin when encountering the North Folk. Though I dont remember ever travelling to your northern lands at that period” 

“So you're a God?”

“No… yes… Its complicated."" 

“So you're not a god?” 

“God is a difficult term to use. We aren't immortal, we aren't all-powerful. We live a long time and can do a lot, but our forms and existences are bound by rules, areas, and domains.”

“So not a god, but you're like a god?” 

“If that sufficiently answers your question, then yes” 

His answer had me sit there for a moment before I decided to accept it and move on, as I realised a straight answer wasn't what I was going to get from that line of questioning. 

“Ok… So if you, Hermes… What's with the Bird?” 

“That would be my mother. Well, my mother, in the sense that she's married to my father, my mother was a human woman.”

“So, who's that… Aphrodite?”

“That is my Great Aunt…Also, my former sister in law” 

“That's weird, dude.” He just shrugged at that comment, seeming to understand how I found it odd, but not caring, I followed on by asking. 

“So, your mother, who is that?”

“Hera is her Oldest Name.” 

“And what does she want with my Son?” 

“...well, that is your first mistake”

“What is?” He went quiet for a moment, sliding another coin across the table. He then looked me in the eye, as the calming feeling his voice put over me began to fade, and I felt my anxiety creep back in. 

“The coins are items that allow for our world to be fully understood by you mortals… but they also hide you from us, and hide our twisting of reality and perception from you when nearby.” 

“That doesn't answer my question” 

“It doesn't, but it is necessary” 

“Then go on.” 

“Your posts… you've only made a couple, but you're sharing the story? Tell me. Have you ever described Luke? Yourself? Your wife?”

It took me a second to think… other than his weight and a few small details from what I remember, I hadn't. Though at the time, I rationalised it. “I dont want to post that on the internet. I've already got Bird Monsters and Mutant Baby people coming after me, I dont need creepers on the internet, too” He looked at me with a sorrowful face afterwards, shaking his head as he moved on. 

“Describe yourself to me” 

“What?”

“Humour me” 

“Ok, uhm. Long Blond hair, short beard, white, blue eyes, Kind of a thin face?” 

“Now Iris” 

“...Also white. She's a redhead, green eyes, pale with freckles… where are you going with this?” 

“Now… Luke” 

“Hes a baby… they kinda look the same…” 

“That's not a description” 

“What are you even trying to get at?” 

“Describe your son” 

“Hes…” I then tried to focus on it, thinking about every time I've lain beside him, played with him, held him in my arms, and every time I've thought about him while all of this shit was going on. My son, to whom I have devoted the last 3 months of my life. I couldn't think of a single detail. I tried to think, pushed and pushed, feeling a singular tear run down my face as I couldn't even provide 1 detail about my son. 

Then he took the coin from the table and placed it in my palm, telling me.

“Close your eyes, your mind can not handle what you'll witness before you” I follow his instructions as I feel the rusted metal in my palm. Like a freight train, a moment of clarity hits me… My son looked nothing like me or his mother. Not because he was a baby, he had no features from either of his parents, his hair was dark black, his skin tanned, his eyes an unnatural yellow. How had no one pointed this out? How did no one say anything? My family and friends had seen him. In a panic, I open my eyes and see the true form of the being ahead of me. His outline shifting, his form changing, the only part of his body that seemed solid was the rough, serpentine body that made up his torso and head, with a long tail that i couldn't find an end off; his body was a shifting frame, some parts merging with flesh, some parts piercing in through spiraling and painful looking protrusions of metal. Coiling around the mechanical appendages that made up his arms were 2 smaller serpents that rested upon his shoulders. 

He had no eyes. That was the thing that stuck with me, no sockets or indents, no sign they were ever there, just 4 slits that ride up from just above the nose that bulge into growths that sprouted up like coral… With a moment that left a blister on my hand from the friction, he snatched the coin from my grasp, his form shifting back to the almost humanoid one I had seen him in. 



“What… Why… What?” I stammered out. For some reason, despite knowing what i saw, I felt like i couldn't trust my thoughts on the matter, feeling a tight grip of confusion strangle my brain. Like, the description i gave would have been wrong if i looked again, or if the thing i saw sat across from me had nothing to do with anything I just said, and that's all I could figure out to call the pieces that make up that monstrous form.

He reassures me to the best of his ability, telling me. 

“Take deep breaths. Try to think of other things, your mind will rationalise what you've seen soon enough.” 

“What… You're no god” 

“I never said i was” 

“What, what are you…” 

“The only one who will tell you the truth… that your son is not your own.” 

I reached over the table and gripped his shirt, though he barely moved as i felt my fingers grip past something other than fabric. The woman at the counter yelled over, hastily telling me to get off him and not to fight. 

“What do you mean he's not mine…” 

“Your wife doesn't know it either… But that child is my father's… my brother” 

I'd give anything to believe it's not true. Believe that all this was some sick dream that I'd wake up from in a moment. Yet I stayed awake, my attention dragged over as he continued. 

“My Mother has a habit of punishing those with whom my father commits adultery, as she is not powerful enough to punish him herself” 

“So what, because some lightning god couldn't keep it in his pants and fucked my wife, we have to suffer.”

“Not We… you are simply caught in the crossfire. She just wants your wife and child.” I was just about ready to hit him again after that, but I knew it wouldn't do anything. 

“So is that why you gave me these?” 

I'd say taking out the envelope and carefully pouring the other 2 coins onto the table, being careful not to touch them after what happened previously. As the metal clanked against the table, and I looked up at his face, a chill ran down my spine. His face the whole time had been this calm, uncaring smile, very little reaction even when i have been aggressive, but now, his face had dropped. 

“Go home… Now” 

“What?”

“Now, get in your car, and go to your wife and son. If you're fast enough, you may get there in time” 

“Are they in danger?” 

He finally snapped back at me, aggression in his voice, “I told you, the coins hide you from themIt'sts why they saw you when you were at the mall, and you brought both the coins i gave you here!” 

His words sink in like a knife to my gut, and i dont even hesitate. I run to my car outside and drive off, leaving in such a hurry that i clip one of the cars parked in front of me as I shoot off down the street. My knuckles were turning white as i gripped the wheel with intense focus. Hermes was right, the cafe was closed and almost as if i blacked out on the drive, I was at my mother's apartment, bursting out of the car and through the building's door.

Step after step, i charged up the stairs, until i got to our floor and saw the door wide open, hearing the blood-curdling scream from down the hall. I made a charge into the room. I wish there were a monster, some horrific god or beast i could at least pretend I'd be able to fight to save Iris, save my son.

But i couldn't. Luke was nowhere to be found. I couldn't see him anywhere, couldn't hear him cry, didn't know where he was. Iris, on the other hand. She was lying across the ground as i came into the room. Her screams continued as i heard her loud, shrill cries slowly turn into squeals, her bones snapping and contorting as I rushed over to her. I try to comfort her for a moment before her body begins to swell. A vile, disgusting transformation, slow and painful. That thing didn't kill her; it wouldn't do that, that's too easy. Instead, it decided a fitting punishment for the simple act of unknowingly birthing the son of a god was to turn her into a beast. 

She couldn't even get words out by the time I had gotten there, the pain of her transformation too much to bear. Eventually, her pain was over, but by that point, she was no longer human. Just a large mass of pink flesh, a squealing boar in the centre of the living room. There was nothing i could do, i made a mistake and it cost me my wife, cost me my… His son. 

He appeared once more, stood behind me, once again in his trench coat and hat, covering his shifting form. No longer human. 

“It was a mistake, a foolish one, but you couldn't have known. I apologise for snapping at you mortal… this is a story i have witnessed time and time again”

I didn't reply, just sat there with a whole pig in my arms, one that used to be the woman i loved. 

“I couldn't help her either… but if you wish, i may bargain with Mother. I may return your son to you if you wish it so; however, it comes at a cost”

I sat there, tears streaming down my face as the beast lay its head on my lap, heaving.

“If we can't undo this… then Luke would be all i have left here… what will it take?” 

He took a moment, his silence being louder than any word he could have spoken as he raised an arm, handing me a knife. 

I stared up with a moment of confusion, followed by hesitation, then sheer defeat. Finally hearing him speak.

“It is cruel what things of our kind do to your mortals… However, appeasement to what you call gods is the only way. Your bones are like twigs, your flesh like paper, your view of the world a small pond in a world surrounded by vast oceans. However, even the smallest of creatures serve their role… appeasement is one mortal kind that has taken on for themselves.”

He'd drop the knife to the floor, “If you want your son back”, he'd add before kicking over the knife and finishing “Appese her” 

There was no way to undo what had happened, no way to fix her, my love. The one who always made me smile on a bad day, the one who knew me better than i knew myself, the one who made me laugh and smile… we weren't perfect, but nothing is beautiful because it's perfect. 

I grasped the knife and raised it high, feeling my hand tremble as i did so. Even though all that stared back at me were the unfeeling eyes of an animal, all i could think about was what i was ending. It wasn't just her life; it was ours. It'd be casting out any chance of saving her and forcing her into a mental slideshow of memories. 

Even though it was lightweight weight something as simple as a knife made me feel as if i was holding up the world. There was no sound, nothing else in that moment but the hardest choice i could make… until that silence was broken. 

Crying. 

The familiar cry of my son, even though he wasn't mine. I've been with him since day one, i looked after him, and made sure he was safe. He was mine, and i could hear him crying. 

I turned around and plunged the knife into the chest of the figure, feeling soft flesh give way, as hollow bones snapped, the trenchcoated form behind me no longer the man i met, the one who claimed himself hermes, instead it was that head splitting form i had witnessed all those nights ago, that horrific feathered monstrosity and i had just stabbed it. Though indoing so, from what was previously covered by a trenchcoat, i saw my son slipping from the creature's grasp.

I fell to the floor as he fell, catching him in my arms, the creature screeching as it plucked the knife from its chest. It howled at me, crying out in words to hold for me to know, and that i should never have heard. I gripped Luke tightly in my arms, and stood between him and the beast, looking it dead in its eyes, peering from hanging flesh upon the dies of its torn open face. 

My mind was attacking itself, blood dripped from my nose, but i watched and gritted my teeth. Thinking of all the nights it watched him, those things it sent after us, how it threw me into a wall and how it nearly had me kill my own wife. 

I looked and scoured.

She lunged at me, Long bony arms coated in features reaching me long before her body did, talons sinking into my flesh, but i held Luke tight. The cold, sharp feeling piercing my gut, the strange sensation of blood gushing from my body. Though the shock was the worst part. Not feeling pain would be a godsend for most, but in this instance, it was a strange agony. 

She attempted to pry me away from him, the adrenaline being the only thing keeping me conscious as they tore my flesh. 

Their loud screeching was only being overshadowed by the Strike of thunder from outside. We were no longer hidden, and he knew where we were. 

Her body crumpled, almost as if a hand i could not see grasped her entire form. I felt her claws be pulled from my body, her shifting mass stable for a mere moment before a flash of light filled the room. Before i knew it… she was gone. The sound of bones cracking as Iris returned to her normal state, and i dropped to the floor. 

Im writing this part now as im in the hospital. My doctors told me it's a miracle i survived, though my look of disgust at the term miracle seemed odd to them. I had been out for a while, a few weeks, from what i was told. Iris had been staying at a friend's place not too far from the hospital. Apparently, nothing else had happened while I had been unconscious. 

Hopefully, that's the last we see of that so-called god… it wasn't the last i saw of the one calling itself Hermes, however.  He visited the hospital briefly, and I was lying there, staring at the ceiling while the doctors were off filing some of my paperwork. He walked in, his form human once more, though he was wearing a helmet with a wide brim, wings on either side. That got a weak chuckle out of me, which seemed to amuse him. We said no words to each other. I simply gave a concerned expression, and he raised a hand almost as if to let me know it was over… he then placed a coin next to my bed, and took his leave. 

Luke, Iris and I are now just trying to go back to normal. Luke's appearance has gradually changed over time; he now has my nose and his mother's eyes. He came out a redhead just like her, too. It does keep me up at night, however, knowing that out there, there are beings way more powerful than we could ever hope. That's all, though… if anything else happens, I'll update you all, but for now. I want to live my life, and hope you all take care. ",4,1758128441.0,creepcast,1,0.83,False

Seeking a card with comparable/extended benefits to the chase sapphire preferred. I downgraded the CSP in Aug 2024 to consolidate CC spending to my local bank and its Visa Signature option -- mainly for account management headaches as this bank was managing my home loan too. I just found out the Visa Signature rewards through the bank are excluding all redemption options for travel. I am looking for a card that currently offers a significant bonus I can apply toward an International trip in April 2026 and one domestic travel trip in November '25.

First food I grabbed was Imos. I heard mixed reviews, rubbery cheese, but it worked. Something about almost eating salty melted plastic, but in a good way. Lmao the cashier told me, “It always tastes better if you eat it in the car,”. Idk if he just wanted me to leave but he was right.

Went to castlewood n Forest park, art hill, zoo, all fun af fr. Then out to Start Bar at night. Half the games were busted and the floors sticky af. Large cliques make it hard to mingle. Still pretty chill. Met some random people eventually they bought me some shots which was nice but then dude asked me if I wanna go pound one out in the parking lot. Bruh 1, I'm straight, 2 at least buy a foo dinner first sheesh.

Ran into Schnucks for a couple things and some employee just started followed me aisle to aisle. I was like wtf I thought he was loss prevention but he was smiling waaay too much. Then he asked me what high school I went to, and starting this long ass small talk conversation. I tried ditching him but he kept following me and was way too invested in my beer choices. Then he randomly looked into the distance and casually said, “I can see the arch” and walked off.

Next night I had dinner at the lil Italian Hill neighborhood. Cozy spot called Dominic’s. Food was ight compared to LA, BUT staff was super polite, like wtf almost too polite. When I left, every employee came outside and waved me off. Not like a casual wave at all. They were ALL full on lined up outside the door of the restaurant. I parked on the street outside right there and they stood there while I got in my car. Smiling, waving until I turned the corner. I kept checking my mirrors the whole drive back.

Swung by Maplewood skatepark the next day, got some good runs in. Chill spot with decent lines, but a bit crowded. The best part was there was this shirtless guy carrying around a fizante wine bladder like it was the Stanley Cup shouting at everyone to “SLAPPPAA DA BAG!” before drinking. Mono prolly running rampant.

Courtesy Diner was my favorite meal. Place had a fuckin vibe. Two big ass foos started throwing hands by the jukebox and hella people yelling.. but my waitress just kept refilling my coffee and sliding me eggs like nada. 

Final night, I ended up at Crack Fox. I was barhopping downtown with some randos I met and had no idea what kind of place Crack Fox is. Some dude was on the stage cross dressed in a glittery dress. The people with me told me it was Stan Kroenke. Looked him up and sure enough it was him on stage in drag, singing “Sweet Caroline.” Crowd booed, then sang along, then booed again. At one point he pointed right at me and mouthed, “You.” I left right after, because what else do you even do after that?",36,1758128230.0,StLouis,16,0.76,False

I need to warn you about something before it’s too late. Or maybe… maybe it’s already too late for me to want to warn you. That’s the problem - I can’t tell anymore if what’s happening is the worst thing that’s ever happened to me, or if I’ve been blind my whole life until now.

I’m writing this at 4 AM because I can’t sleep anymore. Not since the app. Not since I started seeing the patterns.

It started three weeks ago when my friend Marcus sent me a file at 2:47 AM. We’d been friends since college, the kind where you don’t talk for months then pick up like nothing happened. Except something had happened to him. His messages had been getting weird for weeks - cryptic stuff about “finally understanding” and “the loneliness ending.” I figured he was going through another breakup or maybe trying meditation again. Marcus was always trying something.

The message just said “check this out” with a download for something called PatternRec.exe. The file was only 33KB. I remember thinking that was weird - my grocery list app is like 400MB. What kind of program is 33KB?

I almost didn’t download it. It was late, I had work in the morning, and honestly Marcus had sent me weird shit before - remember those binaural beats that were supposed to make you lucid dream? Yeah, those just gave me a headache. But something made me click it. Maybe it was the time stamp. 2:47 AM is such a specific, lonely time. The time when you’re up because you can’t face your dreams or your reality.

The interface was nothing. Just a black window with green text, like an old DOS prompt. It asked one question: “Do you want to see the patterns?”

I clicked yes. What else do you do at 2:47 AM?

At first, nothing happened. I went to bed annoyed, thinking Marcus had pranked me with some dumb art project. But then the headaches started the next morning. Not painful exactly, more like… pressure. Like when you’re about to remember something important but can’t quite reach it. Like my brain was trying to grow new pathways or something.

I’d lose chunks of time - I’d sit down at my computer after dinner to check email and suddenly it would be 3 AM, my eyes burning, dozens of browser tabs open to forums I’d never heard of. Weird places with names like “The Convergence Board” and “Pattern Seekers United.” The posts were all about symptoms - headaches, time loss, seeing things. But also about… connections. Coincidences. Meeting strangers who felt familiar.

The hallucinations started four days in. Shadow people in my peripheral vision, always just out of sight. But when I turned to look, they’d resolve into normal people - except they were always looking at me. Not in a creepy way, but like… like they recognized something in me. A homeless woman at the bus stop locked eyes with me and mouthed “you’re not alone anymore.” I ran three blocks before I stopped, heart pounding.

A kid in the grocery store - couldn’t have been more than five - waved at me like we were old friends. Kept waving even as his mom pulled him away. She apologized, said he’d been doing that to strangers all week. Said he kept talking about “the friends he hadn’t met yet.” We both laughed but her laugh was nervous and mine was too.

Then there were the notes. I started finding pieces of paper in my handwriting with things I didn’t remember writing: “Sarah Chen, apartment 4B, dreams of drowning every Tuesday.” “Tom Martinez, the barista, hasn’t spoken to his father in three years, four months, twelve days.” “Mrs. Patterson next door cries every Tuesday at 8 PM - her husband died on a Tuesday.”

How did I know these things? I’d never spoken to Sarah Chen beyond “hey” in the hallway. Tom was just the guy who made my coffee. Mrs. Patterson and I had maybe exchanged ten words in the two years I’d lived here.

The synchronicities were the worst part. Or the best. I still can’t decide. I’d think about someone and run into them within hours. I’d crave Thai food and find a new Thai restaurant flyer under my door - from a place that opened that very day. I dreamed about a red umbrella and the next day, seven different people on my commute carried red umbrellas. Not six, not eight. Seven. I counted.

I started documenting everything, trying to find the pattern in the patterns. Tuesday: thought about my college roommate Jessica, she called an hour later after three years of silence. Wednesday: hummed a song I hadn’t heard since high school, it played in three different stores I walked into. Thursday: I woke up craving my grandmother’s soup, and my neighbor knocked on my door with homemade soup that tasted almost exactly the same.

I tried to delete the app but it wasn’t in my programs list. It wasn’t running in task manager. I reformatted my hard drive - complete wipe, fresh Windows install. The patterns kept coming. If anything, they got stronger.

Two weeks in, I was falling apart. I hadn’t slept more than three hours straight since downloading it. I kept seeing things - golden threads connecting people on the street, words floating above their heads showing their deepest fears. I called in sick to work four days in a row. On the fifth day, my boss showed up at my apartment with chicken soup and a concerned expression. He sat with me for an hour, talking about his own breakdown five years ago. I’d worked for him for seven years and never knew.

Then last Saturday night, everything accelerated. I was walking home from the corner store - just needed milk, normal fucking milk, trying to pretend everything was normal - when the pressure in my head spiked so hard I thought I was having an aneurysm. I collapsed against a building, and suddenly I wasn’t just me.

I was Marcus, staring at his computer screen at 2 AM, typing and deleting the same message to his ex-wife over and over. I could feel his loneliness like a physical weight, three months of eating cereal for dinner and talking to no one but delivery drivers.

I was Sarah Chen in 4B, and yes, she was drowning, but not in water - in isolation, working remote for two years without a single real conversation, refreshing social media every thirty seconds looking for proof that other people existed.

I was Tom Martinez, and the weight of three years, four months, and twelve days of silence with his father was a stone in his chest that made it hard to breathe every time he served a customer old enough to be him.

I was Mrs. Patterson, and Tuesday at 8 PM was when Jeopardy ended, the show she’d watched with Harold for forty-three years, and now the theme song sounded like a funeral dirge.

I was everyone who had the app, all at once, and we were all broken in exactly the same way - disconnected, alone, surrounded by humans but never touching souls, performing happiness on Instagram while crying in our cars, staying late at work because home was emptier, sending “lol” texts when nothing was funny, haven’t we all been there? Haven’t we all been exactly there?

But here’s the thing that terrifies me most - in that moment of connection, something shifted. Sarah’s drowning feeling lifted because seventeen other people in her building suddenly understood what remote work isolation felt like. Not in an abstract way, but literally felt it. Tom picked up his phone to call his father because he felt how twelve other people wished they could call theirs. Mrs. Patterson’s Tuesday crying sessions stopped because her neighbors started knocking on her door - not because they knew about Harold, but because they suddenly just… needed to check on her.

I came back to myself throwing up in an alley, my head pounding. But when I got home, there was a note under my door from Sarah Chen. “I don’t know why I’m writing this, but do you want to get coffee sometime? I feel like we should talk.”

It’s spreading. Fuck, it’s spreading so fast now. I see the signs everywhere - people making eye contact on the subway instead of staring at phones. Strangers helping each other with groceries without being asked. Actual conversations starting in elevators instead of awkward silence. My apartment building, which had been silent as a tomb for two years, suddenly has cooking smells in the hallways. People are leaving their doors open. There’s laughter.

My building started having weekly potlucks. POTLUCKS. In NYC. In 2024. Nobody has potlucks anymore. But every Thursday now, we all end up in the community room that hadn’t been used since the 90s, eating Mrs. Patterson’s lasagna and Sarah’s attempt at dumplings (she’s getting better) and Tom brings coffee from his shop and we all pretend this is normal, this is how people live, like we haven’t all been eating alone standing over our sinks for years.

Marcus reconciled with his ex-wife. Not got back together, but they talk now. They have coffee every Sunday and remember why they liked each other before they forgot how to be married. Sarah joined a hiking group and hasn’t had the drowning dream in nine days (she texts me every morning she wakes up without it, like a victory). Tom’s dad is flying in next week. Three years, four months, twenty-six days of silence, ending with a plane ticket.

We’re all infected. Every single one of us who downloaded it, who saw someone else download it, who maybe just stood too close to someone who had it. We all see the patterns now.

But the patterns aren’t what I expected. I thought it would be like the movies - seeing the code of the Matrix or something. But it’s not that. It’s seeing that the angry guy in traffic is rushing to the hospital. It’s knowing the bitchy barista just got evicted. It’s understanding that everyone, literally everyone, is walking around with invisible wounds that would make you cry if you could see them.

Yesterday (was it yesterday? time moves weird now) I was on the subway and I could see it all - the patterns, the threads, the pain, the hope. This teenager was standing near me, hood up, scowling at everyone. Classic don’t-fuck-with-me NYC pose. But I could see… not literally see, but know… that he was failing math and his mom was working three jobs and he was scared he’d end up like his brother who just got sentenced to five years upstate.

Without thinking, I said “Khan Academy has free math tutoring.” He looked at me like I was insane. But then this woman across from us said “My daughter used it for algebra, it really helps.” And this old guy with a Wall Street Journal said “I’ll tutor you for free, I taught math for thirty years.”

The kid just started crying. Right there on the R train at rush hour. And nobody looked away. Nobody pretended not to notice. The woman gave him tissues, the old man gave him his business card, and I… I just stood there watching the golden threads connect us all, watching us remember what we forgot when we all got so modern and independent and isolated.

This thing is rewriting our brains. It’s making us hallucinate connections that shouldn’t exist, forcing us to feel things for strangers, stealing our comfortable numbness. It’s violating everything we’ve been taught about boundaries and privacy and minding your own fucking business.

But also… yesterday I sat with Mrs. Patterson while she showed me photos of Harold. He had the kindest eyes. She makes the soup he used to love and brings it to neighbors now because “Harold always said food tasted better shared.” Sarah and I go running now - we both hate it but somehow hating it together makes it bearable. She laughs when she runs, this gasping, wheezing laugh that makes other joggers stare, but it’s the first real sound she’s made in two years.

The “hallucinations” aren’t stopping. If anything, they’re getting stronger. Sometimes I see golden threads connecting people on the street, pulsing when they help each other, brightening when they really connect. Sometimes I know things I shouldn’t know - that my coworker is struggling with addiction (I left an NA pamphlet on his desk, no name attached, he’s been clean six days now), that my boss is caring for his dying mother (we don’t talk about it but I bring him coffee exactly when he needs it), that the angry customer screaming at the cashier just lost her job (I paid for her groceries when she wasn’t looking).

The worst part? The best part? I can’t turn it off. I can’t unsee it. Last night I walked past a bar and could feel the loneliness inside like heat from a fire. Twenty people drinking alone together. I wanted to run in and shake them, tell them to look at each other, really look. But then one guy started talking to another about the game, and the threads lit up, just a little, just enough.

Three nights ago, I found myself at my computer at 2:43 AM. My contact list was open. The file was attached. My fingers were moving without my permission, selecting names. Everyone I knew who was drowning. At exactly 2:47 AM, I sent it to thirty-seven people.

I watched myself do it. I tried to stop. But also… I didn’t try that hard. Because underneath the terror, some part of me knew what this was. Some part of me wanted them to feel what I was feeling. Not the horror of losing yourself, but the relief of finding everyone else.

This morning (or was it yesterday? time is so weird now), twelve of those people messaged me. Not angry. Confused, scared, but also… grateful? They’re seeing the patterns now too. Their neighbors are acting strange - warmer, kinder, more present. Like something in the air changed. Like we all collectively remembered something we’d forgotten.

Mike from college said his roommate, who he’d lived with for two years without knowing his last name, suddenly suggested they have dinner together. Just out of nowhere. “Want to eat actual food at an actual table like actual humans?” The roommate doesn’t have the app. But Mike does, and maybe that’s enough. Maybe it spreads through proximity to those who can see.

My sister called yesterday crying. Happy tears, she said, though she sounded terrified. Her whole office had suddenly started eating lunch together instead of at their desks. Nobody organized it. It just happened. “It’s like we all remembered we’re people at the same time,” she said. I didn’t tell her about the app. I didn’t tell her I’d sent it to her husband three days ago.

The forums are going crazy. Some people are calling it a virus, some think it’s aliens, some think it’s the next stage of human evolution. But I know what it really is. It’s loneliness turned inside out. It’s forced empathy. It’s the walls we built to protect ourselves being dissolved by something that doesn’t care about our protection.

I should be trying to stop it. I should be warning people not to open files from friends at 2:47 AM. I should be telling you to run, to close this post, to forget you ever read this.

But instead, I’m sitting here at 4:37 AM, watching the sun come up, and for the first time in my life, I can feel the city waking up. Really feel it. Millions of people opening their eyes, remembering their dreams, facing another day. The patterns show me their fear, their hope, their desperate need to be seen.

The app is coming for you. When you get that 2:47 AM message, you’ll have a choice. You can delete it and stay safe in your isolation.

But you won’t. None of us do. Because some part of you already knows what we all discovered:

The real horror isn’t being infected with empathy. The real horror isn’t losing your privacy or your boundaries or your comfortable numbness.

The real horror is that we needed a virus to teach us how to be human again.

The real horror is that it took a piece of malware to make us look up from our screens.

The real horror is how good it feels to finally, finally, finally not be alone.

My phone says it’s 2:41 AM. Six minutes until the next wave. I can feel the pressure building, the need to share growing stronger. My contact list is already open. Your name might be on it.

I’m so sorry for what’s about to happen to you.

I’m so sorry that you’ll finally have to feel everything.

I’m so sorry that you’re going to understand.

But also… I’m not sorry at all. Because yesterday I saw Tom’s father arrive at the airport, and they hugged for so long that security asked them to move. Because Sarah sent me a video of her laughing - really laughing - on top of a mountain she climbed. Because Mrs. Patterson has three dinner invitations for next Tuesday.

Because the patterns are beautiful, once you learn to see them.

Because we were all drowning alone, and now we’re drowning together, and somehow that makes it swimming.

Because I haven’t felt this terrified and this alive ever.

Because the golden threads are singing, and they sound like home.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",1,1758128182.0,u_Silent_Astronaut_532,0,1.0,False

Annoyingly, two switches are inverted on the board, caps-lock and space bar.
Overall I'm pleased with the build. I'll probably swap out the switches for the HMX in the future, they are very good. ",14,1758128159.0,MechanicalKeyboards,4,1.0,False
1njin81,https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1njin81/too_much_caffeine_problem/,too much caffeine problem,"Are there any *recommendations* for lower caffeine **pre-ground** brands? I am new to drinking coffee and was ***gifted a 6 cup moka pot***  and **was given cafe bustelo** (the vacumn sealed yellow one)**.** Every time I would drink it, **I would feel insane** (shaking, nervesness, tremors) and unable to concentrate (I had never drinken coffee much before so i assumed thats just how drinking coffee felt before talking to other people).

I started doing research and **bought a 3-cup moka pot,** and im still using cafe bustelo **but i still feel insane after drinking it.**

***what is the solution here?***  
\-buying an even smaller moka pot size (for instance a 2-cup)?  
\-mixing decaf with the bustelo?  
\-or should i try another brand/ground mix.

Ive read that the regular bustelo  is a mix of arabica and robusta, which apparently means it has more caffeine, but like I said i know almost nothing about coffee so it gets kind of confusing.

1njimda,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodylanguage/comments/1njimda/i_think_i_made_my_work_crush_think_i_dont_like/,I think I made my work crush think I don’t like him - would it be weird if I gave him a little note with my number?,"Ok, so for some context, I’m 28F and have worked as a dietary tech in a hospital for 3 months. I’m very shy, and embarrassingly, I’ve never had a boyfriend or really ever even flirted with everyone. I grew up overweight, and after recently losing 100 lbs, I’m just now starting to actually have some confidence. (You can look at my post history if you want to see what I look like)

There’s an RN my age who has given off signs that he’s attracted to me, or at least has some interest. To quickly summarize:

- the first time we saw each other in the hallway he stared at me for a good 10 seconds while in a conversation with someone else
- he’s looked away quickly at times when I caught him looking at me
- we always will catch each other’s eyes if in each other’s proximity 
- we always smile and say good morning to each other despite only having talked to each other a handful of times, and sometimes he’ll look surprised to see me for a split second

Like I said, as far as actual conversation goes, we’ve only talked very briefly a handful of times. The other week I was the break room and he walked in, so I asked him how it’s going. I had been trying to hype myself up for days to formally introduce myself to him, so I took the opportunity and told him my name. He didn’t say his name back but said something about how I’m always so focused at work and made a joke about how me and my other coworker look alike. Even though he didn’t say his name back (maybe he assumed I just already knew it) I left feeling good about the interaction and proud of myself for talking to him.

Now, here’s where I think I screwed up. When I saw him again a few days later, we said hi like usual. That same morning there were two instances where I looked up to see him staring at me, but both times I got nervous and couldn’t hold eye contact with him and looked away quickly. Then, he walked into the break room again while I was there. We said hi, but I stupidly decided not to say anything and see if he might say something first since I initiated the last time. He didn’t say anything either, so we were just silent. but, he did ask to squeeze by me to get a cup even though there were some closer, if that means anything 😅

I’ve seen him twice since then, and both times he would briefly look at me and looked away, I’d say good morning as usual, and he’d say it back but not as friendly as he normally would. I’ve just been feeling like I really screwed up - we connected when I introduced myself, and then when I saw him again, my nerves just ruined the opportunity to build on that. I feel like maybe he’s been waiting for clear signals that I like him and I accidentally did the opposite.

Now, I’ve been thinking about how I can remedy this. It’s a tricky situation for a few reasons - the hospital we work at is of course super busy, and he and I don’t interact as part of our jobs much. His schedule also changes from week to week and he sometimes works nights, so some weeks I might see him for one day for literally 5 minutes when our shifts overlap in the morning. Add to the equation the fact that I am extremely shy and have never made a clear move on a guy, ever. 

To be honest, I don’t have the nerve to just walk up to him in the hall and talk to him. I could wait until we have another organic break room moment, but those rarely happen. So, here’s what I’m considering: I was going to get a small piece of paper, write something like “I think you’re super nice, and if you’d ever like to grab coffee sometime, I’d love that. If not, no worries” and include my phone number. 

I know it’s not ideal, but considering my shyness, this is what I think I might be most comfortable with. I’d love to hear your opinions. Thank you!",11,1758128100.0,bodylanguage,12,0.87,False
1njikok,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1njikok/can_waterdrop_wdpf01a_pitcher_filter_deliver_the/,Can Waterdrop WD-PF-01A Pitcher Filter Deliver the Best Filtration? Review Inside!,"Testing water filtration products has become an oddly satisfying part of my daily grind. At home, I tend to obsess over water purity, and the **Waterdrop WD-PF-01A Plus** replacement filters integrated seamlessly into my life, almost like they were meant to be here. These NSF-certified filters claim to reduce PFAS, PFOA/PFOS, impurities, and even odors. Needless to say, I was intrigued—cleaner water paired with sustainability sounded right up my alley.

**Design and Fit**  
There's something very intuitive about how this product is built. The elegant, compact design of these filters is far from clunky, measuring 5.55 inches by 3.5 inches by 7.24 inches. They slid perfectly into my Waterdrop pitcher without needing excessive fiddling (because honestly, no one has patience for mismatched sizes). The material feels sturdy to the touch, and its carbon fiber construction seems solid even through months of daily use.  

**Ease of Installation**  
I have to say, installation couldn't have been easier. Pop the old one out, rinse the new filter, and slot it in. No tools or finicking required—it’s a plug-and-play operation perfect for someone like me who’s not overly technical. My 10-year-old niece helped me swap it out the last time; yes, it's that straightforward.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Effortless installation and compatibility with multiple Waterdrop models.  
- Certification ensures its credibility in reducing unpleasant contaminants and tastes.  
- Compact size makes it practical for both medium and large households.  

**Performance That Speaks for Itself**  
The performance is where it shines. After installing these replacement filters, I immediately noticed the taste difference in my water. It's not just about removing the harsh chlorinated aftertaste; these filters tackle everything from fluoride to arsenic. According to third-party lab tests, its activated carbon fiber design effectively eliminates microscopic impurities. Plus, my coffee tasted better. Was it placebo? Maybe. Did I care? Nope. Loved it either way.  

[Check Waterdrop WD-PF-01A price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b08c7qnskz/)  

**Long-Lasting Functionality**  
One of the standout highlights is durability. Each filter lasts up to 200 gallons, roughly equivalent to replacing 1,600 single-use plastic bottles. I didn’t even have to think about replacements for months, which is a relief for someone prone to forgetfulness. It's budget-friendly—though replacing filters constantly can test my patience, this stretched-out timeline is pretty manageable.  

**Drawbacks**  
Before you start seeing rainbows and unicorns, let's get real. No product's perfect, right? Here are the parts that made me go, ""Hmm.""  
- The filters seemed to have a slight learning curve during the first use; you need to rinse properly, or the initial flow might appear cloudy.  
- While it's easy to install, users reported occasional issues if the pitcher model isn't listed as compatible.  
- Limited compatibility if you're not sticking to the Waterdrop pitcher ecosystem, though for me, that wasn’t a personal issue.  

**Competing Products**  
Testing water filters means comparing them to others, and let me tell you, the competition is strong. For instance, Brita and PUR filters often dominate the market. Both are reputable and offer easy access to replacement filters. That said, the Waterdrop replacement filters outperform Brita in terms of reducing impurities like arsenic and PFAS. However, Brita might be easier to find in local stores, which I know matters for some. PUR models, on the other hand, boast excellent lead reduction, but they are notably slower in water flow. I appreciated the Waterdrop’s 0.3 gallons per minute rate; no one likes standing around waiting for a pitcher to fill.  

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Overall, the ""price to quality ratio"" here feels surprisingly fair. Comparing the product to alternatives, its extended lifespan and efficiency make the cost-per-gallon quite reasonable. At no point did I feel like I was spending frivolously for clean water. It’s an investment that pays off in utility and sustainability.

Speaker	Dialogue
[Open on a witch with green hair and a staff backflipping onto a cliff. She glares up at a large purple snake.]
Gildersnake	Foolish child! I could swallow you whole! [Hisses.]
Azura	Do not underestimate me, Gildersnake, for I am the Good Witch Azura, warrior of peace! [Poses as wind blows her hair before kneeling down and holding her staff like a bazooka.] Now eat this, sucka! [Fires off staff.]
Gildersnake	[While being shot.] No! My only weakness: dying! [Collapses.]
[The scene cuts to a doll of Azura and a green snake being held, revealing the previous sequence to have been a dramatized enactment of a scene using the doll and snake.]
Luz	And that's the end.
Camila	The end of what?
Luz	My book report. [The snake hisses and bites the doll.] I think I knocked it out of the park.
Principal Hal	Your book report is why you're in here.
[He gestures to the door of his office, through which two students can be seen outside running by screaming, snakes biting their heads.]
Luz	Oh. That's where the backup snakes were.
Camila	And what were you going to do with this? [Holds up several firecrackers tied together.]
Luz	That was for the Act Three closer.
Camila	Mija, I love your creativity, but it's gotten out of hand. Do you remember why you were in the principal's office the last three times?
[Cut to Luz on stage at an audition for Romeo and Juliet, holding a spork.]
Luz	O happy dagger, give me death!
[Luz stabs the spork into her torso before tearing her dress, making several links of sausages fall out. Everyone else on stage screams and runs. Cut to Luz sewing a pigeon head onto a squirrel's body, on a platform labelled ""baby griffin"".]
Luz	Now for the final anatomically correct touch, spider breath.
[She opens the model's beak. Many spiders come out, crawling over her and the table. People scream in terror, throwing objects everywhere. Cut to cheerleading tryouts, where a girl does a successful backflip. Every other student applauds.]
Luz	You think that's an impressive trick? [Throws her pom-poms to the side.] Take a look at this. [Turns around to reveal she flipped her eyelids inside out.] Bleep, bloop, bleep!
[Everyone else screams and runs, and it sounds like at least one person is gagging. Cut back to Principal Hal's office.]
Camila	We all love that you express yourself, but if you can't learn to separate fantasy from reality, you may need to spend the summer here.
[She holds out a pamphlet for Reality Check Summer Camp. Luz takes it reluctantly.]
Luz	Don't worry, Mom. I won't let you down. [Stands up triumphantly.] No more weirdness!
[The snake in Luz's hand suddenly jumps out and bites the principal. He falls to the ground with a yell while the snake hisses.]
Luz	That doesn't count, right?
[Cut to Luz, who is standing disappointedly in front of her house.]
Camila	[Exits the house.] Oh! Oh, my baby! [Hugs Luz.] Now, don't worry. Summer camp is only going to be for three months. You'll be so busy balancing checkbooks and learning to... appreciate public radio, the time will fly by!
Luz	But I don't like any of that stuff. I like editing anime clips to music and—and reading fantasy books with convoluted backstories.
Camila	Mija, your fantasy world is holding you back. Do you have any friends? Real ones, not imagined or drawn or reptilian?
[Luz drops her book, disappointed. She walks slowly over to the trash bin.]
Camila	Summer camp is a chance to make some friends, but you have to try. Can you do that?
Luz	Yes, Mom.
[Luz puts her book, The Good Witch Azura, into the trash bin. Camila's phone vibrates in her purse.]
Camila	Oh. I gotta go to work. [Kisses Luz's forehead.] Your bus is coming soon. Text me when you get there. Cuídate mucho, mi hija. ¡Qué te vaya bien! [Walks away.]
Luz	Bye, Mom. [Watches her leave, then gasps and rummages through the bin.] Where is it? Where is it?
[An owl hoots. Luz looks up and sees a little owl, her book sticking out of the bag in his beak. It turns and flies away.]
Luz	Tiny trash thief!
[Luz chases the owl. She pauses when the reach a decrepit abandoned house, but the owl continues right inside. Luz stares at the house. Luz growls. Steeling her nerves, Luz runs inside. The front door slams shut behind her, and the entire inside glows, visible through the windows and the holes in the roof. Cut to the inside of a tent, where a door unfolds in three parts before opening. The little owl hops through it, and a second later, Luz follows.]
Luz	Stop adorably hopping away, you—Huh? [Looks around the tent, which is full of old odds and ends.] Whoa. I thought I had a lot of weird stuff. [Grabs a creepy-looking doll.] But this? This is impressive.
Woman	[Offscreen.] Finally, you're back.
[Luz makes a noise and drops to the ground. She peeks back up and walks forward, moving the flap of the tent aside to see the back of a middle-aged woman in a red dress.]
Middle-aged Woman	Now let's see what we've got here.
[The little owl lands on top of the woman's staff. She turns him around, and it becomes a wooden fixture of the staff. Luz gasps.]
Middle-aged Woman	[Takes out a phone from the bag.] Garbage. [Throws it away. Takes out a ring.] Garbage. [Throws it away. Takes out a golden shining chalice.] Garbage. [Throws it away. Gasps.] Now, this... [Takes out a pair of joke glasses with eyes on springs and puts them on.] This will make me rich. [Takes out Luz's book.] And this... Oh, this will make good kindling. [Holds the book with candle.]
Luz	[Gasps; runs out of the tent and grabs her book back.] Excuse me, sorry, it's mine, thank you.
[Luz runs back into the tent and heads for the door. It folds up before she can walk through it and disappears. Camera zooms out to show the middle-aged woman holding a key with an eye on it, the same eye that was on the door.]
Middle-aged Woman	[Takes off the glasses.] You're not going anywhere.
Luz	Wah-ah!
[She shoves Azura into her messenger bag and ducks out the back of the tent. She runs, and skids to a stop mere inches away from falling off a cliff. She's clearly no longer on Earth, the town before her being made up of far too many arms and teeth. A dragon flies by and is caught by one of said arms. Cut to denizens of the town going about their days: a cloaked figure holding an ice cream cone which eats someone, the legs of what appear to be a giant chicken, a centipede-looking thing opening its mouth to let a winged creature fly out. The latter two kiss before going their separate ways. Cut back to Luz.]
Luz	[Backing away from the cliff.] Oh, no, no, no, no! What's going on? [Shrieks as a fairy approaches her.] Oh, hello, little fairy. Are you going to tell me this is all a fantastical dream?
Fairy	[The fairy's Mouth grows to half the size of its face.] Give me your skin!
Luz	[Screams, slaps the fairy into the ground.] Where am I? Did I die? Am I in the bad place?
Middle-aged Woman	[Touches her shoulder.] You wish.
Luz	[Sits down on a stool.] I'm so sorry! I just wanted my book! If you're gonna eat my skin, [Offers her arm and closes her eyes.] just make it quick! Just do it now!
Middle-aged Woman	Eat you? Why would I eat... a potential customer?
[Luz opens her eyes.]
Middle-aged Woman	Can I offer you a human foot filled with holes? [Holds up a green Croc, then puts it aside and grabs a stick of men's deodorant.] A bar of green human candy? Oh, oh! How about this black shadow box that reflects only sadness? [Holds a portable TV up to Luz.]
Luz	[Looks at the middle-aged woman and laughs.] That's not all it can do. Here, let me see it.
[Luz takes the TV and grabs two batteries from a dish labelled ""Human candy! (????)"" She puts the batteries in and presses the power button. A jazzercise video start playing with loud music.]
Luz	Voilà!
[Several customers and vendors stop at the noise.]
Monster #1	Huh?
Monster #2	What's that?
Monster #3	The sound—it's so alluring.
[Several monsters are now crowded around the TV.]
Monster #1	[Holding up green bills.] I'll pay 40 snails for the screaming box!
Monster #2	I'll give you a hundred!
Monster #3	Can I eat the tiny person inside?
[The whole crowd starts bidding.]
Middle-aged Woman	[Looks at Luz.] What did you say your name was?
Luz	I'm Luz. Luz Noceda.
Middle-aged Woman	[Taking people's money.] Well, Luz, that was pretty clever... for a human.
Luz	That's kind of a weird thing for another human to say.
Middle-aged Woman	Oh, dear child, [Take off bandana to reveal pointed ears.] I'm not like you. [Climbs onto the table.] I'm Eda the Owl Lady, the most powerful witch on the Boiling Isles!
Luz	A witch?
Eda	I am a respected, feared-
Guard #1	Busted! [Breaks the TV.]
Monster	Run! It's a guard!
[All of the customers run away screaming. Eda hops down from the table.]
Guard #1	[Holds up Eda's wanted poster.] Eda the Owl Lady, you are wanted for misuse of magic and demonic misdemeanors.
Luz	[Peeking over the edge of the table.] Whoa! Witch criminal!
Guard #1	[Grabs Eda's arm.] You are hereby ordered to come with me to the Conformatorium.
Eda	[Frees her arm.] Would you guys quit following me around? I haven't done squat.
Guard #1	And you're coming too... [Picks Luz up by her hood.]
Luz	Aah!
Guard #1	...for fraternizing with a criminal.
Luz	Wh-What? That's not cool!
Eda	Oh, all right, all right, you win. Just let me get my stuff.
[Eda reaches under the table and grabs her staff, swinging it at the guard. He falls to the ground with a grunt. Eda spins her staff and taps the bottom of it on the table, making all her stuff float in midair. Luz picks herself and her book off the ground.]
Eda	Whoops. Can't forget this.
[Eda reaches into her hair and pulls out the key, pressing the eye to summon the portal door. She closes her hand into a fist, making the tablecloth wrap itself around all of her stuff. She sticks her staff through the bundle and starts running.]
Eda	Follow me, human.
Luz	[Following Eda.] This is crazy. If I die here, my mom's gonna kill me!
Eda	Ha! I won't let 'em hurt you. A human like you is much more valuable to me alive than dead.
Luz	Wait. What's that supposed to-
Eda	Whoo-hoo!
[Eda jumps, pulling herself and Luz onto her staff. They take off into the sky as the guard runs into frame.]
Guard #1	You won't get away with this, Owl Lady! [Looks at his hands.] Yeah, all right. You did. You got away with it. She got away with it, everybody! Typical.
[Cut to Eda and a crying Luz flying on Eda's staff above the Isles.]
Eda	You can open your eyes now, human.
Luz	[Does so, yells and nearly falls off the staff when she sees the ground below them.] Flying staffs, crazy monsters, you're a witch! What is this place?
Eda	[Picks Luz up and rights her.] This is the Boiling Isles. Every myth you humans have is caused by a little of our world leaking into yours.
[Various winged creatures fly behind them as Eda talks. A griffin that looks extremely similar to the one Luz made at school flies up next to them and screeches.]
Luz	A griffin!
[The griffin barfs spiders.]
Luz	[Points.] I knew it!
Eda	Yep. Griffins, vampires, giraffes...
Luz	Giraffes?
Eda	Oh, yeah. We banished those guys. Bunch of freaks.
[Eda lands the staff and hops off, though her hand stays behind. Luz sees it move on its own.]
Luz	Aaah! [Jumps off the staff.]
Eda	Oops. [Screws her hand back on.] That happens sometimes.
Luz	[Stands.] Well, I've had enough adventure for today. This is clearly not the PG fantasy world I always dreamed about. So, can you help me get back home?
[Eda levels her staff in front of Luz, startling her.]
Eda	Only if you help me first. [Chuckles, lifts her staff, and walks away with the bag following her.] Ah, now, come along, human.
Luz	Whoa!
[Cut to a tower, on top of which is an owl with an uncanny human face that cackles. Zoom out as it flies down to reveal the Owl House, which Eda and Luz walk up to.]
Luz	[Looking over her shoulder.] Aren't you worried about those guards finding us?
Eda	Nope. My house has a state-of-the-art defense system.
Hooty	Hoot-hoot! Password, please!
[Eda pokes both of his eyes.]
Hooty	Aah!
Eda	We got no time for this, Hooty. Let us in.
Hooty	All right, all right! Geez! You never want to have any fun! Ow! Hoot!
[Hooty opens his mouth wide enough to completely cover the door. Eda and Luz step through, though Eda's bag stays outside. Hooty closes his mouth. Hooty burps. Cut to inside.]
Eda	Welcome to, [Snaps her fingers.] the Owl House...
[Candles ignite. A fire in the fireplace starts, a cauldron starts stirring itself, and a broom starts sweeping the floor. Overhead, a depiction of an owl beast of some kind begins to glow with a great screeching noise. Luz looks at all of this in awe.]
Eda	...where I hide away from the pressures of modern life. Also the cops. Mm, also ex-boyfriends. [Chuckles.]
Luz	This place is beautiful! [Puts her book onto a coffee table.] Do you live here all alone?
[Thudding footsteps shake the house.]
Eda	Actually, I have a roommate.
King	[Deep voice.] Who dares intrude upon I, [Normal voice.] the king of demons? [Squeaks a rubber ducky.]
Luz	[Gasps in overjoy.] ¡Ay, que lindo! [Runs forward and scoops King up in a hug.] Eda, he's so cute! Who's a widdle guy? Who's a widdle guy? Is it you? Is it you?
King	[Struggles to free himself.] No! I don't know who your little guy is! Eda, who is this monster?
Eda	[Drags Luz away from King.] Oh, this is Luz, the human. [Puts her down.] She's here to help us with our little... situation.
King	Oh! Hooray!
Luz	Wait, wait, wait. I don't like the sound of this ""situation"".
Eda	Just... let me explain. [Draws a spell circle that darkens and effectively turns into a storybook. Narrating.] King was once a mighty king of demons, until his Crown of Power was stolen, and he became... [Cut to Luz hugging King again.] this.
Luz	You mean this little bundle of joy?
Eda	[Narrating.] The crown is being held by the evil Warden Wrath and locked away behind a magical force field that only a human can break through.
[The storybook circle fades, return to Luz hugging King.]
Eda	A human like you. If you help us retrieve his crown, we'll send you back to your realm. So whaddya say? Plus, [Picks up King by his face and shakes him gently.] who could say no to this cute face?
King	No! Please don't encourage her! [Eda drops him.] Nyeh!
Eda	I mean, we're kinda your only way home.
Luz	So I don't really have a choice, do I?
Eda	Nope. [Picks Luz up and tosses her over her shoulder as she heads for the door.] Now, we've got no time to lose.
King	[Picks up his rubber duck.] Soon, Mr. Ducky, we shall drink the fear of those who mocked us. [Follows Eda.]
Luz	Where are we going?
Eda	Somewhere super fun.
[Cut to the Conformatorium, where thunder claps.]
Eda	The Conformatorium, a place for those considered unsuitable for society.
Luz	[Notices Eda's wanted poster on the wall they're hiding behind.] Whoa. These guys really have the hots for you.
Eda	Yep. But we were never caught because we're too slippery.
King	Try to catch me when I'm covered in grease. I'm a squirmy little fella. Aah! [Falls off of Luz's head.] You and I will sneak up to the top of the tower, where they're holding my crown.
Eda	And I'm gonna make sure the warden's distracted.
Luz	[Gasps.] Will I need a disguise?
Eda	Uh...
Luz	I've been waiting to use this. [Pulls her hood on, flicks up cat ears.] Meow, meow.
King	It's hideous.
Eda	Oh, you'll fit right in.
[Eda taps the butt of her staff against the ground, creating a round glowing platform. She steps away from it.]
Eda	Hang on tight.
Luz	Whoa!
[The platform rises, floating all the way up to a window in the tower. It disappears suddenly, forcing Luz to grab the edge of the window sill and King to cling to her feet. Eda, meanwhile, tosses her staff and casually sits down on it as it rises.]
Eda	Meet you guys at the top of the tower.
[King grunts as he climbs up Luz and into the window. Also grunting, Luz pulls herself up and in, falling on her face.]
King	Ha-ha! Cats don't do that.
[Luz sits up and gasps. The two of them marvel at the amount of prison cells before them, all of them occupied by shadowy beasts of varying shapes and sizes, though all of their eyes glow in the light.]
Katya	Hey, cat lady, how'd you get out of your cell?
Luz	Oh, no, no, no. I'm not a cat. [Pulls her hood down.] Also, I'm not a criminal.
King	Not yet, you're not.
Katya	Neither are we. The stupid warden likes to lock people up who don't fit in. Like, I write fanfics of food falling in love. [Pulls out a book of said fanfiction.] I like food, I like love... Just let me write about it.
Eye-Eating Prisoner	I'm here because I like eating my own eyes. [Plucks an eye out of his head as he says this, swallowing it. The eye floats back into place.]
Tinella Nosa	We are agents of fwee expwession! They will never siwence us!
Katya	Yeah, she's really big into conspiracy theories.
Tinella Nosa	The world is a simulation! We are but playthings for a higher being!
Luz	[Pacing around.] Wait. These aren't crimes. None of you actually did anything wrong. [Pulls out Eda's wanted poster.] You're all just a bunch of weirdos. Like me.
[Thudding footsteps attract their attention.]
Katya	It's Warden Wrath! Hide!
[Luz exclaims and runs into an open cell, pulling the door down as she enters. Footsteps continue until a door is pushed open.]
Warden Wrath	I can hear you.
[Luz whimpers.]
Warden Wrath	[Stomping forward.] Just what are you fools whispering about? [Looks down at Eda's wanted poster that Luz had dropped.] Ah. The Owl Lady. [Picks up the poster and crumples it, turning his fist into a hammer and slamming it into the door of Luz's cell.] I'll get my hands on her soon enough.
[Warden Wrath looks into the cell, where Luz and King are huddled in the corner.]
Tinella Nosa	Fight against the oppwessor! We will wesist! We will conquer! We will never be afwaid of you, you old cweep!
[Warden Wrath walks over to her cell and opens it. She stares at the opening door.]
Tinella Nosa	Hooway! I'm fwee! [Squeaks.]
[Warden Wrath grabs Tinella Nosa, his fist fitting around her entire body. He holds her up and points at the other two prisoners.]
Warden Wrath	Let this be a lesson to all of you. There's no place in society for you if you can't fit in.
[He tightens his grip, making Tinella Nosa squeak again. Warden Wrath stomps away, crushing the crumpled up wanted poster on his way out. A door slams, and Luz opens her cell, running to that of Katya.]
Luz	Don't worry. I can get you out. [Pulls on the lever, but can't lift it.] No! My weak nerd arms!
Katya	Just get out of here while you still can, kid. Enjoy freedom for us.
[Katya walks deeper in her cell. Luz reluctantly walks away. Cut to a hallway, where Eda flies up to Luz.]
Eda	Hey, I just checked. [Hops off her staff.] The warden is distracted, tormenting some tiny creature. He won't be coming around here anytime soon.
[Luz continues walking without saying anything. Eda watches her, confused. They reach a towering door reading ""CONTRABAND"".]
King	My crown! It's close! I can sense its power! [Runs up to the door and fiddles with the doorknob that's as big as he is.]
Eda	Aw, he gets so cute when he's thirsty for power.
Luz	It's not fair that they're all in here. They just want to be themselves. Why does everyone think that being a weirdo is so bad?
[King grunts. The doorknob is thrown to the ground with a clink. King pushes open the door, cackling, and runs through.]
Eda	Come on, before he hurts himself.
[Something zaps.]
King	Ow!
[Luz and Eda follow King in. Cut to the inside of the room, which is empty save a giant glowing pillar in the center. King rubs his skull before charging at the pillar headfirst, succeeding only in launching himself backwards.]
Eda	We have a human, remember?
King	Oh, yeah.
[Luz takes a breath. She puts a hand against the pillar before walking through it. Inside are piles of what can only be described as as junk: everything from books to skulls to a dead fish in a tank. Atop the central one is a glowing crown.]
Luz	Wait a second. Is that a...
[Cuts to Luz holding a Burger Queen paper crown, looking incredibly frustrated.]
King	My crown! [Jumps in place before taking the crown from Luz and placing it on his head.] Yes. Yes! I can feel my powers returning! You, there. Nightmare critter. [Points to a stuffed rabbit with one button eye falling out of a box.] I shall call you Francois, and you shall be a minion in my army of darkness. Ha-ha! [Picks up the rabbit.]
Luz	That crown doesn't give him any powers, does it?
Eda	Uh, no.
[Luz glares at Eda.]
Eda	Oh, look at us, Luz. King and I don't have much in this world. We only have each other. So if that dumb crown is important to him, it's important to me. And besides, us weirdos have to stick together, you know?
[Luz grins and blushes.]
Eda	Well, we owe you one. Now, let's get out of here before the warden finds us and loses his head.
Warden Wrath	Too late.
[Warden Wrath's hand turns into a blade, and with an easy swing he decapitates Eda. Luz catches her head and screams.]
Eda	[Sticking her tongue out like a bad fake corpse.] Ow! Oh, I hate it when that happens.
[Luz screams louder and longer. Cut to commercial.]
Luz	Eda! Are you okay?
Eda	Yeah. This just happens when you get older.
Luz	Does it?
Warden Wrath	Finally, [Transforms his hand back into a hand.] I have you cornered, Eda the Owl Lady. [Takes King's crown.]
King	Weh?
[Warden Wrath walks closer to Eda and Luz. King follows him, his arms up and reaching for his crown.]
Warden Wrath	My guards could never get you, but I knew if I took your pet's toy, you'd come running. [Crumples the crown.]
King	No! My power!
Eda	What do you want with me? I've never actually broken any of your stupid laws... in front of you.
Warden Wrath	I want you... [Pulls out a bouquet of flowers.] to go out with me.
Eda	Wha...?
Luz	[Disgusted.] What?
Guard #2	Go, boss!
Warden Wrath	[Shoots the guard a thumbs-up.] You've always eluded our capture. You've always been the one who got away. I found that alluring.
Luz	I hate everything you're saying right now.
Warden Wrath	You stay out of this!
[Warden Wrath tosses the bouquet over his shoulder, turning his now free hand into tentacles to grab Luz and hold her above the ground.]
Warden Wrath	So how about it, Owl Lady? [Picks Eda's head up by the hair.] The most powerful witch of the Boiling Isles and the feared Warden Wrath. We'd be the strongest power couple ever. I mean, it's—it's not like you can say no right now.
[Eda looks up at Luz, who's struggling to free herself from the warden's grasp. She looks to King, who gets picked up by one of the guards and also struggles for freedom.]
Eda	[Sighs.] All right, Warden. You win. I'd just like to say something first. Come closer. No. Just come a little bit closer. Just... Yeah, that's good. [Blows raspberry.]
[Warden Wrath yells and drops Luz, who also yells. He wipes Eda's spit off his mask. Eda laughs.]
Warden Wrath	Impudent wench! Don't you know how many germs are in your mouth? Blegh!
Eda	Get over it. You had your guards stalk me, and then you cut off my head. I am not going out with you.
Warden Wrath	If you don't accept, then I have no choice but to des—Oh!
[Luz hits him in the head with Eda's staff. He falls to the ground with a loud crash.]
Eda	[Chuckles.] Nice!
[The two guards step next to Eda's head. She glares at them as her body walks up behind them and drags their hoods over their eyes.]
Luz	Okay, we're going now.
[Luz runs forward, grabbing Eda's head. Eda's body frees King of the guard's grasp, and Luz grabs her by the waist and they all mount the staff. Owlbert unfurls his wings and hoots.]
Luz	Expecto... flying? Magicus... escapicus!
[Warden Wrath grunts as he gets up.]
Eda	Gun it, magic stick!
[The staff takes off. Warden Wrath clamors to his feet.]
Warden Wrath	Owl Lady, I won't let you get away again!
[His arms transform into bundles of tentacles, which he uses to chase after the staff. Cut to them flying past prison cells, Warden Wrath in hot pursuit. Luz and the camera zero in on the lever keeping Katya's cell shut.]
Luz	Eda, lend me a hand!
[Eda places her hand against Luz's. They open the cells of the three prisoners Luz and King had talked to earlier. All of them look excited. They burst through an outer door high in the center of the Conformatorium with a yell from Luz, then plummet. Warden Wrath exits right behind them, front flipping off the pillar. The staff and Warden Wrath fall toward the ground. Warden Wrath extends one of his tentacles, hitting the very back of the staff and launching Eda, Luz, and King off of it. They roll when they hit the ground, and Warden Wrath steps in front of them, his hand shifting into a blade again.]
King	Ow, my bones!
Eda	Luz... [Reattaches her head, then reaches into her hair and pulls out the key to the portal door.] go back to the human world. [Hands Luz the key, then runs at Warden Wrath.]
Luz	What about you guys?
King	[Stands and runs to join Eda.] If you think this guy is bad, you shoulda seen her last boyfriend!
Eda	Not my boyfriend. [Grabs King and jumps back towards Luz, avoiding Wrath's blade-hands.] Go! Go! [Puts Luz onto her staff.]
Luz	But—But I—
[Eda slaps the bottom of the staff, sending it into the air. Warden Wrath takes off his mask to reveal a face that's mostly mouth, which opens to breathe fire. Eda expertly draws two spell circles, one that catches the fire and one that launches it right back. Wrath slams into the wall of the Conformatorium. Luz whimpers as she tries to not fall off the staff. Wrath stands up, brandishing his blade-hands and running at Eda again. The three prisoners peek out of the hole that he left in the wall. Luz flies down to talk to them.]
Luz	Why are you guys just standing there? This is your chance to escape!
Eye-Eating Prisoner	The warden'll catch us. He always does.
Katya	We belong here.
Tinella Nosa	Self-doubt is a pwison you can never escape fwom.
[Prisoners muttering in agreement.]
Luz	So, you have a different way of doing things, a different way of seeing things. That might make you weird, but it also makes you awesome. Don't you see?
Katya	Why are you helping us?
Luz	Because us weirdos have to stick together. [Pulls her hood on and mounts the staff.] And nobody should be punished for who they are.
[The three prisoners all cheer. Luz turns the staff around.]
Luz	Now, let's get 'em!
[They all follow Luz. Cut to Eda being thrown against the ground, and King being thrown into her arms a second later. Warden Wrath looms over them.]
Warden Wrath	No more running away, Owl Lady. Today I capture you once and for all!
[King whimpers, and hides his face in Eda's chest.]
Luz	Go, go, go, go!
[The prisoners scream as they barrel into Wrath. Luz flies behind them.]
Eda	Luz?
Eye-Eating Prisoner	[While shoving Wrath.] I eat my own eyes!
Tinella Nosa	[Trips Wrath.] I think the world as a twiangle!
Katya	[Holding Wrath down.] And I practice the ancient art of fanfiction!
[Tinella Nosa joins Katya in holding Warden Wrath down while Eye-Eating Prisoner grabs his arms and ties them together. He then flips Wrath onto his stomach, so he can see Luz descending on Eda's staff.]
Warden Wrath	You! Who do you think you are?
Luz	[Points at Wrath.] Do not underestimate me, Warden Wrath, for I am Luz, the human, warrior of peace. [Wind blows her hair.] Now eat this, sucka!
[Luz pulls her firecracker from her book report out of her messenger bag, tossing it into the air before hitting it with Eda's staff. The firecracker lands in Wrath's flaming mouth and goes off, sending fireworks into the air. He runs away, humiliated, fireworks still going off in his mouth, while the prisoners cheer.]
Tinella Nosa	[Jumping up and down.] We are victorious!
[Eda, with King on her shoulder, walks closer to Luz, putting a hand on the human's shoulder.]
King	That was actually one of her better breakups.
Eda	Not a breakup. Anyway, let's bounce before any more monsters fall in love with me.
[The three fly off on the staff, fireworks still going off behind them. Cut to the living room of the Owl House, where Eda leans her staff against the couch.]
Eda	Well, a deal's a deal. Let's get you home. [Snaps fingers.]
[The key flies out of Luz's bag and into Eda's hand. She presses the eye, and the portal door unfolds itself in front of the fireplace. Luz walks up to it, then hugs herself and turns back to look at Eda and King. King looks at the ground, visibly sad. Luz reaches into her bag.]
Luz	Before I go... [Holds out the head of her Azura doll.] I know it's not the same, but... [Removes Azura's crown.] a king shouldn't be without a crown.
King	[Accepts the crown and places it on his head.] This shall suffice. You there, plant! You are now under my command. [He points to something and walks off screen.]
Eda	[Grabs the Azura book off the table and hands it to Luz.] Oh, and don't forget this.
[Luz takes it, and the pamphlet for Reality Check Summer Camp that's on top of it, and walks toward the portal. She stares at the pamphlet before putting it under the Azura book. She pauses in front of the door, looking at it. She looks back down at her book, then up, at a mirror above the fireplace. Luz gasps. She holds up the book, on the cover of which is Azura in the foreground, with an older witch looking at a dog/cat creature in the background. She lowers the book to reveal the mirror showing a very similar image, King and Eda in the same positions as the creature and the older witch, and herself in the foreground between them. She brightens and turns around.]
Luz	Okay. I know you got your head cut off, and we started some kind of prison riot, but this was the most fun I've ever had.
[Eda blinks owlishly in surprise.]
Luz	I don't fit in at home. You don't fit in here. If I stay, we could not fit in together. [She looks at the pamphlet for Reality Check one last time, then crumples it.] I'm not going back to summer camp.
Eda	[Chuckles.] What's summer camp? What are we talking about here?
Luz	I want to stay and become a witch. Like you. [Holds her book up to Eda.] And Azura.
Eda	[Laughing.] What? All right, that's crazy. [Pushes Luz's book down.] Humans can't become witches.
Luz	Maybe that's because they haven't tried. If you teach me to become a witch, I'll do anything you want.
King	[Pulling at Eda's dress.] Let her stay! [Whispers.] She can make us snacks.
Eda	[Smiles and picks King up.] Well, I could use a hand keeping this goofball out of the cupboards. All right. I'll teach you how to be a witch. But you have to work for me before you learn any spells. Deal?
[Eda holds out her hand. Luz looks at it before grinning and crushing the two in a hug.]
Eda	Gah! What's going on?
King	Too tight! Too tight!
[Cut to Luz opening the creaking door to a storage room. She unrolls a sleeping bag and, now wearing pajamas, throws herself on it, before turning over and taking a picture of her and her mom out of her messenger bag. She rubs her thumb over the glass before placing the frame right next to her pillow. Her phone vibrates, and she grabs it and turns it on. A message from ""Mom❤️"" reads: How's summer camp? Luz's expression falls, and she moves her phone away from her face.]
King	[Clears his throat, steps into view while holding Francois.] Your sleep cocoon looks fluffy.
[Luz sits up and pats the sleeping bag. King curls up at the bottom below her feet and falls asleep. Luz smiles at him before replying to her mom: ""I think I'm gonna like it here"". Smiling, she puts her phone down, turns to the side, and falls asleep. Zoom out to the exterior of the Owl House. The giant stained glass eye above the door blinks.]",17,1758127989.0,TheOwlHouse,1,0.96,False

1njifw6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1njifw6/aita_for_walking_away_from_my_husband_after_he/,AITA for walking away from my husband after he needed space,"Im from a coastal town in Oregon, been married to my husband for eight years. We met at a local book club, bonding over our love for classic sci fi novels, and our connection grew from there. He's charming, works as a mechanic, and we used to spend evenings hiking trails or cooking elaborate dinners together. We have a seven year old son, and we dreamed of owning a small cabin by the beach for him to grow up exploring. But last month, everything fell apart, and now Im questioning if I was too hasty in cutting ties.

My family's been through a nightmare. My son has a rare illness, and three weeks ago, his condition worsened, landing him in the ICU with monitors and tubes everywhere. Tests showed he was in critical condition, and the doctors were uncertain about his recovery. I’ve been balancing my job at a coffee shop and keeping our household together, barely sleeping or eating. I didn’t expect my husband to fix everything just to be there for us.

When our son was admitted, I called my husband at the garage, telling him I’d be at the hospital around the clock. I asked him to stay in touch. He muttered, Sorry, hope hes okay, then went quiet. For ten days, no calls, no visits, nothing. I sent texts like, He's stable but still critical, please come, and got no response. I thought maybe he was struggling to cope, but it felt like a betrayal.

On day eleven, I was livid. I'm holding my sons hand through endless alarms, picking up extra shifts, and trying to keep our life from unraveling. Then I saw his Instagram him at a barbecue with friends, grinning with a drink in hand, even liking flirty comments from some woman. Hes out socializing while our sons fighting for his life, and he can't even send a text to check in? That shattered me. We used to be a family, building sandcastles with our son, and now its like we're invisible to each other.

I called him, furious: You've abandoned us while our sons dying. Where are you? He shot back, You’re blowing this out of proportion. I needed space. Space? With our kid in the ICU? I was done. I told him if he can’t show up when we need him most, we re through. I filed for divorce that week, moved with our son to my sisters place, and blocked him everywhere. I don’t need a man who bails on his family.

Now, some people say I moved too quickly, that hes just bad at handling stress and deserves a second chance. But is it too much to expect him to be present? My son is my world, and he couldn't even pretend to care. AITA for ending it?

* She leaves half-drunk cups of tea and coffee all over the apartment. Sometimes like 5 at once.
* She bites her nails and then leaves little bits on the couch or table.
* She brushes her hair in the living room and never cleans it up, so there are strands everywhere.

I kept quiet for months, thinking it's not worth a fight. But the other night I came home, sat on the couch, and literally sat on a mug of cold tea and pile of hair. I snapped and said: ""this place feels like a student dorm, not a home. Can you please stop being disgusting?""

She got really hurt and said I was humiliating her instead of just asking nicely. Now she's sulking and telling her friends I called her ""gross"".

I have alot of the symptoms most prominent are the brain fog & zaps, extreme fatigue, muscle soreness, close range vision blurring.

I have a numbness on my right leg from my knee to ankle that just doesn't feel right at all (Doctor told me not to worry about it and suggested physio). 

At the last appointment I suggested I would like my bloods taken due to symptoms above and he agreed. I had to chase them to get the results this is when I was told I was deficient. No one has called me in or told me what to do, other than take supplements(I had to purchase these myself I was offered no prescription) .

From my research 64PMOL is very low. 

For reference I am a 32 year old male 5ft9 70 kg plant based diet with an active job and up until recently gym 4 times per week. I'm struggling to wake up in the morning and when I do I am waiting on the coffee kicking in but it just doesn't. By the time I get home I am exhausted and dropping off my feet. 

I plan to book an appointment first thing tomorrow morning and I will pressing for answers to why I was not called in and why I haven't been offered injections.

1njic7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1njic7r/manager_warns_friend_i_could_be_banned_for/,Manager warns friend I could be banned for calling corporate,"My local convenience store/gas station chain is like a second home for me. I am moderately agoraphobia due to trauma, and this store is one of the few places outside my home where I feel safe. I go there every day.

A few weeks ago, one of the store employees asked when he was going to be able to take me to dinner. I responded, surprised, ""are you asking me out?"" He paused before responding, ""Yes"". 

I told him I was flattered but no yhank you. .  yada yada yada . . . 

He asked, ""Why not?""

I stuttered something about having too many things going on and quickly left the store.

I didn't think much of it, but the very next day when I came in to order my coffee, he approached me again. This time, he came from behind the food counter and stood very close to me, with my back to the ordering console. 

Employee, ""Why can't we work on those things together?""

Me, startled, ""I'm sorry. I didn't hear you. What did you say?""

Employee: ""I was just saying why can't we work on those things together? You said you had too many things going on. . .""

Me, sliding out from between the Employee and the console and staring him dead in the face, ""Oh, because I like it when people respect my boundaries the first time. You feel me? Without me having to explain or justify myself. Do you understand what I'm saying??""👁👁🤨

Employee glances around and fiddles with his headset before nodding yes and returning to his work station.

it did come up in conversation when I was checking out the following day. Like a good regular, I chat with the employees since I see them every day. 

During the course of this conversation, I learned that the employee that had approached me was an expectant father with a baby due in 2 months. I also learned that he had pursued a female coworker to the point of following her to her home.

He's a ""I just wanna talk."" Kinda guy, I guess.

I decided to speak with the general manager and make him aware of the situation. 

A week or so later, Justwannatalk was still working there. Same shift. Night shift. 10pm - 6am.

I have never in my life even considered asking for somebody to be fired, but I felt this grown man, in his mid 30's who was following coworkers home and confronting customers on why they don't want to date him, probably is a big enough liability for the store to at least suspend him and send him to sexual harrassment training. Based on conversations with employees. This was not happening. Justwannatalk got a talking to and that was it.

I get laser focused when women's safety isn't taken seriously. So I called corporate and explained what happened and my concerns about both the safety of female employees and customers and the risk of liability for the store.

My complaint was immediately escalated and they took down my contact info to followup with me.

When I went into the store later that day, general manager approached me and said, ""I got your complaint.""

Me: Yes, that's good to hear, and they tell you who made the complaint, as well, I see.""

GM: Yup. You didn't have to do that. You didn't have to contact corporate. I had already handled it. I talked to the guy and we sorted it out.""

Me: ""Okay, well, I feel like it's a huge liability for your store to continue to have someone working here that has a history of stalking women.""

GM: ""What are you talking about? Stalking.""

Me: ""He left his work station to confront me about why I wouldnt date him and he followed a female coworker home.""

GM: ""Did he follow you home?""

Me: ""Am I a female coworker?""

GM: ""waves hand dismissively""
Me: ""Well, anyway, I'll wait for a response from corporate on the issue.""

I continue to stand awkwardly in place until my food order is ready.

I leave and spend the next day or so contemplating that interaction.

As I continue to chat with store employees, I learn that employees do not expect GM to do anything about the situation with Justwannatalk.

Further, many of them have first hand experiences with GM being rude, even belligerent to employees and customers. GM is annoyed and angry when female employees ask for help with aggressive male customers.

I decide to call corporate again. Just to describe my interaction with GM and ask if that is the standard procedure for following up on customer feedback to corporate.""

Corporate Agent, ""Nooo. I am so sorry. I assure you that is NOT our typical procedure. I am going to connect the ticket from this call with your previous call and escalate this issue further. We have your email address and phone number. We will be following up with you.""

I am getting tired of writing, so to the point of this post:

GM's reaction to my second complaint was to issue Justwannahug a temporary suspension and send him to workplace training. Cool.

GM's reaction was also tell another employee with whom I chat frequently, ""I know that's your girl and all, but she can get banned from the store. 3 complaints in 1 week?""

Now, I don't think GM can actually ban me from the store for reporting my experiences. If corporate took it seriously enough to followup with training, I'm assuming for both GM and Justwannatalk, then GM is just posturing.

Honestly, I want to followup with corporate and ask if I could be banned from the store for calling them about this issue, but my friend is afraid that if I do that, it will blow back on her.

So, did I overreact by calling corporate, the first or the second time?

Would I be the asshole for asking corporate if I can be banned for this?

1njibfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1njibfd/endgame_travel_coffee_setup/,Endgame Travel coffee setup.,"This will be my endgame travel coffee setup. Obviously it's battery powered machine so if battery dies, I will need new machine haha.

Grinder is K6, Espresso machine specs are 58mm, water heating feature and 13500mAH battery capacity instead of 7500mAH for most of other portable machines. 

Background: Breville Barista impress (my endgame E61 HX machine will come mid-oct). I can say it was enough experiences to make decent coffees with BBE impress. 

Here is initial thought on the machine.

The machine built quality is good enough.

I only tested one shot so it needs to dial in in order to get better tastes. I compared with this coffee and BBE impress. DF54, light roast coffee, 17g and about 1:2 ratio. 

If I rate 10 for BBE then portable machine rate is round 7-8. I might rate capsule coffee for 5 or below. BBE game more detail tastes and portable machine gave less detail tastes and lighter body taste then BBE. As I said before I did not perfectly dialed in for portable machine so there is some room for improve shots in my opinion (possibly slightly more beans like 18g-20g) but it might have some limit to get perfect shots. definitely the coffee was drinkable coffee. If I choose between coffee shop vs portable machine, I will pick portable machine for conveniences since I don't need to make a trip to mediocre coffee shops. 

This travel setting can work for me. in this year, I brought BBE and DF54 for beach vocations but a little hassle to bring two machines then I thought about travel setting. I will have upcoming long trips and one hotel does not have anything at their room because it's high end hotel. they do offer free coffees but I am doubtful that coffee tastes will be good so I had reasons to buy this setting. I searched for other machines and narrow down to 3 machines. starseeker 58, outin and cera+ from Amazon. starseeker 58 had many features and it was very interesting machine but it does not have water heating feature so I almost leaning towards in outin but I need to buy basket set for $40 as an accessory kit since I will not use capsule or small basket so think about cera+ then I found Cera+ will release new machines with bigger battery so I contacted to the company and I bought pre-released 58mm version. 

Hope this machine will give decent longevity.

1njib1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/RepHermes/comments/1njib1n/how_not_to_fall_for_hermès_tep_sellers_ticks_my/,How not to fall for Hermès tep sellers' ticks  my personal experience!!,"*i've been watching the Hermès rep market for a long time, especially on Reddit, and you know what pisses me off? Every day I read the same thing: all these seller names, the same ones. As if others don't exist, they're everywhere, just everywhere! And everything they have is the best, isn't it?*

*have you ever heard a seller honestly say ""I have an average Birkin for a reasonable price""? Of course not. Even the one selling a terrible rep for 300 will scream about ""top quality indistinguishable from real Hermès"". The problem is that all these marketing tricks create confusion specifically with Hermès reps. People no longer trust words like ""good copy"" or ""quality Birkin""  they demand something unique like ""Swiss Factory"" or ""exclusive leather"". And I also love these legends about super ""connections"" and ""shadow suppliers"" of leather directly from Hermès factories, just funny lol :D*

*most buyers simply don't understand the difference between an average rep for 500 and a good one for 2000. Especially from photos that have been circulating between sellers for years. The same Chinese Birkin is passed off as work from different ""exclusive factories"". And in the Hermès market, at least on Reddit, every second seller will tell you a fairy tale about ""their super factory"" - where do so many factories come from? And why are all their bags equally medium (at best) quality? I don't understand...*

*how to figure out Hermès reps? I thought while sitting with a cup of coffee. Forget all these quality labels when it comes to Hermès - it's pure marketing. When a seller starts confusing you with terms about ""original supplier factories"", ask directly: ""Is this the highest quality Birkin rep you have?"" A simple question will corner any honest seller. If they continue muddying the waters about ""exclusive Hermès channels"" - turn around and leave. If the seller says ""yes, this is the highest quality rep on the market"", they confirm that there's no better copy. Now you need experience with Hermès reps. Why does one ask 600 for a Birkin and another 2500? Maybe greed, maybe difference in materials. But if a third asks $2100, it's worth figuring out why. An expensive Hermès rep can be overpriced or genuinely quality. But a cheap Birkin copy is always a cheap copy. Nobody sells quality Hermès reps for pennies. How to understand if it's expensive or cheap for a rep? First, dismiss dishonest sellers immediately. Second, understand Hermès rep economics. ""Super quality"" Birkin physically cannot cost 400. Just decent leather and hardware alone would cost more without accounting for craftsman work. Kelly 25 can cost 1200-1800 for a really good rep. Birkin 30 - 1500-2500 depending on materials.*

*i spent a long time searching online to understand this, read useful articles including on Reddit, and believe me it's better to spend time on this than reading endless reviews which as I understand are easily bought and I won't even mention spots on lists, in one group they even banned me when I wrote that I didn't like a bag from one of the sellers they were promoting. Of course they do this secretly so no one notices lol.*

*a good Hermès rep seller is like a good consultant -doesn't rush, I like when a seller explains the specifics of copying different models. Can talk or even argue (moderately) about leather and hardware, it's always cool to deal with an understanding person and you can see this isn't just another reseller who buys bags where it's cheaper and sells where it's more expensive. And vice versa, if they pressure you ""buy faster, last Birkin in this color"" or ""Kelly price only today"", be wary. Big discounts of 20-50% on Hermès reps are also suspicious. The best sellers know nuances of original Hermès bags, can explain which details are hardest to copy, honestly tell about their reps' limitations. Remember the story with ""stellar joe?"" haha just made up so many legends about himself and wrote how everyone was against him but in the end sold people bags at super discounts (supposedly discounts) well but in reality everyone understands what level of quality was there... far from worth 3000-3500. Well okay, let's leave him.*

*if they speak in general phrases about ""exactly like original"", they don't understand what they're selling. A real Hermès rep pro will never say their copy is ""indistinguishable from original"". They'll honestly explain what works well, what's a stretch, and what simply can't be copied with quality. In general, seller honesty is a big plus, and how to understand if they're honest? By asking many many questions, and not banal ones.*

1nji9th,https://zackproser.com/blog/2025-ai-engineer-setup,AI tools finally made true location independence possible for developers,"As a developer, I always envied the location independence that writers and designers had. They could work from anywhere with just a laptop. Meanwhile, I ""needed"" my multi-monitor setup, mechanical keyboard, and controlled environment to be productive.

Not anymore.

**The breakthrough:** AI tools have eliminated the need for multiple monitors and complex setups. I'm now MORE productive with just a MacBook and headphones than I ever was with my elaborate home office setup.

**My entire mobile office:**

* 14"" MacBook Pro M3 (36GB RAM)
* Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones
* Anker PowerCore backup battery
* That's literally it. Fits in any backpack with room to spare.

**How AI changed everything:**

Instead of needing multiple screens for documentation, terminals, and code, I now use:

* **Cursor IDE** with AI - it knows my entire codebase and generates/refactors code through conversation
* **Claude Desktop** \- handles research, writing, debugging help
* **ChatGPT Advanced Voice** \- I literally debug while walking or hiking
* **Wispr Flow** \- voice input at 175 WPM (vs 90 typing) works everywhere

**The game-changer:** Voice + AI means I can work from places you couldn't before:

* Noisy cafes? Noise-cancelling headphones + voice input = perfect office
* Parks? Walking meetings with AI while getting fresh air
* Hiking trails? Architecture planning with ChatGPT voice mode
* Coffee shop with tiny tables? Still fully productive with one screen
* Anywhere quiet? Instant deep work session

**Real scenarios where this flexibility matters:**

* House too noisy? Pack up and hit a coffee shop in 30 seconds
* Need to think through a problem? Take a walk with AI voice mode
* Waiting somewhere? Pull out laptop and be instantly productive
* Nice day outside? Why not code from the park?
* Kids have friends over? Relocate to literally anywhere else

**The freedom is unreal:**

No more being chained to one desk. No more ""I need my setup to work."" No more carrying a portable monitor. No more neck pain from hunching over a laptop.

When inspiration hits or when you just need to escape somewhere quiet, everything you need fits in a backpack. The constraint of a single screen actually IMPROVED my focus - less visual noise, more deep work.

**Why this matters even if you're not nomading:**

You don't have to be traveling the world to benefit from true portability. Maybe you just want to work from the porch. Maybe your home gets chaotic. Maybe you want the option to work from a library or coffee shop without compromising productivity.

The point is: the tools have evolved past needing a fixed setup. My entire productive environment weighs less than 3kg and works literally anywhere.

**Practical tips:**

1. Invest in good noise-cancelling headphones over a portable monitor
2. Learn voice input - it's faster than typing once you adapt
3. Embrace AI tools - they're your portable senior dev team
4. Use Rectangle (Mac) or similar for window management
5. Cloud sync everything (obvious but critical)

Anyone else found that AI tools solved the ""location dependency"" problem? Whether you're nomading or just need flexibility at home, what's your mobile setup looking like in 2025?",0,1758127317.0,digitalnomad,0,0.13,False
1nji9ob,https://i.redd.it/64ljtqc47rpf1.jpeg,Virat Kohli’s Smile Secret: Whitening or Something Else?,"We’ve all noticed it — Virat Kohli flashing that bright, white smile on and off the field. Celebs often look like they’ve got perfectly polished teeth 24/7, which makes many of us wonder: **How safe is teeth whitening if done often?**

# 🟡 What Teeth Whitening Actually Is

Whitening treatments use bleaching agents (like hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide) to break down stains. This removes discoloration caused by tea, coffee, smoking, or even natural aging.

# ⚡ The Celebrity Factor

Celebrities like Virat often undergo **professional whitening sessions** or even use veneers for that consistent glow. These are done under dental supervision, so the risks are managed.

# ❌ Risks of Overdoing Whitening

* Tooth sensitivity (temporary but annoying)
* Gum irritation if done improperly
* Enamel weakening with frequent, unsupervised treatments

# ✅ Safe Practices

* Get whitening done by a dentist, not just over-the-counter kits.
* Space out treatments — usually every **6–12 months** is safe.
* Maintain results with good oral hygiene, avoiding too much coffee, tea, and tobacco.

# 🦷 Bottom Line

Yes, whitening can give you that star-like smile, but doing it too often (or without dental advice) can harm your teeth. Celebs usually have access to top cosmetic dentists who balance safety with aesthetics.

So while Virat Kohli’s dazzling smile might inspire you, remember: moderation + professional care = a safe, bright smile. ✨",1,1758127310.0,SmileBetterCommunity,0,1.0,False

As someone who's constantly fussing over carpets that are perpetually tarnished by coffee spills, muddy shoe prints, and that mysterious stain nobody ever owns up to, I had high hopes for this product. I mean, with claims like stain remover, odor eliminator, and low-foam wizardry all in one, it almost sounded too good to be true. After using this cleaner extensively for a couple of months, here’s the scoop on how it held up in my day-to-day battles with filth and funk.

**Ease of Use and Formula Efficiency**  
One thing that stood out immediately was how ridiculously easy this cleaner was to use. With its low foam formulation, there was no endless rinsing cycle needed after cleaning, which was a refreshing change. I paired it with my carpet extractor machine, and the two worked together seamlessly. The advanced formula broke down grease and lifted stains like a champ. Plus, the no-residue feature stayed true to its word—no sticky or crusty patches on the carpet post-cleanup.  

[Check 3D 13 price on Amazon.](https://check.sanue.com/p/b0007rvlf4/)

**Effective on Tough Stains**  
I tested this cleaner on a particularly nasty old coffee stain in my living room that had survived multiple cleaning onslaughts over the years. To my delight, the cleaner made a visible difference after just one use. While it didn't entirely erase the stain on the first attempt (a few more rounds did the trick), it left me feeling impressed with how much lighter the stain appeared. The added optical brighteners helped revive the carpet to its closer-to-original shade, and honestly, the results felt like a mini carpet glow-up.  

**Versatility in Action**  
I didn’t stop with just carpets. Being the cleaning fanatic that I am, I ventured into the world of upholstery and even tried this on my car interiors. Whether it was the grease smudges on the car floor mats or dog hair-covered couch cushions, this cleaner was up for the challenge. It tackled upholstery stains and lingering odors, leaving everything smelling fresh but not overpoweringly chemical-like.  

**Winning Points**  
- Low-foam formula makes it compatible with extractor machines, saving time and hassle.  
- Optical brighteners work great in restoring a ‘like-new’ appearance.  
- Multi-functional use; worked wonders on automotive carpets, home upholstery, and office rugs.  
- The no-residue promise was kept—big bonus for anyone who hates scrubbing forever.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- While effective, the cleaner’s performance on very old or deep-set stains takes a couple of repeated applications.  
- The cleaner has a somewhat faint detergent-like scent, which might appeal less to those looking for a more distinctive fragrance.  
- The product's liquid nature can mean it’s easy to over-pour, so measuring precisely is key to not wasting it.  

**Product Comparisons**  
During my research spree prior to buying this, I contemplated a few competitors like Bissell's Carpet Cleaning Formula and Hoover’s Expert Pet Solution. Bissell had the edge when it came to heavily pet-soiled carpets due to its stronger odor control properties, but it left behind a noticeable residue that required another round of cleaning. Hoover's cleaner had a much more noticeable fragrance, but it didn’t match the stain-removing prowess of the 3D Extractor Carpet Cleaner. Comparatively, I’d say the 3D cleaner strikes a fine balance of functionality without over-complicating the process.

**Affordable Quality**  
Looking at the price in the context of its features, the value offered here is impressive. You’re essentially getting a dual-action cleaner that both deodorizes and lifts stains with ease. Throw in its compatibility with multiple cleaning surfaces, and it stretches its worth further. Of course, rival shampoos with gimmicky perfumes sometimes feel like they're offering more, but the simple efficiency of this cleaner wins out over frills.

I got what felt like a big static electric shock when I touched the drum inside of it. I just thought this was static from drying clothes or something.

But then I also got a similar large shock from our coffee machine.

This morning I remembered I had an old volt testing pen thing in my toolbox so busted that out to do some investigating.

The coffee machine, tumble drier drum and any exposed screw heads on the tumble drier set the tester off (it shows 110 ?!?)

I turned the drier off and unplugged it. 

BUT, there are now *still* readings of 36 or 55 on the *outside* of various appliances. The coffee machine for example. My phone was plugged in charging and the exposed metal of the camera bumper got a reading.

I even got a shock off the end of my laptop charger when it was plugged in but the plug turned off.

I have no idea what to do. Is this a fault with the tumble drier? But then why has it caused lasting issues with the downstairs circuit when I've unplugged it?

**The Evolution:**

* 2020-2024: Dual monitors on arms, standing desk, Mac mini, mechanical keyboard collection, the works
* 2025: Just a 14"" MacBook Pro M3 (36GB) and Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones

That's it. That's the whole setup.

**What changed:** AI tools got good enough that I don't need the visual real estate anymore. Everything fits on one screen when you're working with AI assistants instead of having 20 terminal panes open.

**Current software stack:**

* Rectangle for window management (replaced my complex tmux setup)
* Cursor IDE (sorry neovim, you served me well)
* Claude Desktop & ChatGPT Desktop
* Wispr Flow for voice input (this is the secret weapon - 175 WPM)
* Stock [Terminal.app](http://Terminal.app) (replaced Warp recently, going minimal)

**The weird part:** I'm MORE productive now. I work from my couch, from coffee shops, from the park. The Sony headphones with noise cancellation mean anywhere can be my office. No more neck pain from looking across monitors. No more cable management. No more feeling guilty about leaving my ""battlestation.""

**What I don't miss:**

* Cable management
* Monitor arm adjustments
* Deciding which screen gets which app
* Being tied to one location
* The constant urge to upgrade something

The minimalist in me is finally at peace. The entire setup fits in my backpack. When inspiration hits at 2 AM, I don't have to go to my office - I just open the laptop.

The back-to-school shift is hardly ever seamless. One moment it’s popsicles on the porch, and the next it’s supply lists, new schedules, and a whirlwind of school emails. For kids, this change can spark real [**anxiety**](https://risehealingcenter.com/anxietytherapyonline) — worries about fitting in, keeping up, or simply adjusting to a new rhythm. For parents, the stress can be just as real, even if it shows up in other ways.

**Kids’ Anxiety: A Normal Response to Change**

It’s worth repeating: [**anxiety**](https://risehealingcenter.com/anxietytherapyonline) before a new school year is common. Kids might mention stomachaches, toss and turn at night, or rattle off “what if” questions until you’re out of answers. Naming their worries and letting them know these feelings are normal can go a long way. A calm, validating response — *“It makes sense that you’re nervous about a new teacher”* — is much more comforting than “Don’t worry, you’ll be fine.”

**The Parent Side of the Story**

Here’s the piece that often gets overlooked: back-to-school can hit parents hard too. You’re not just managing your child’s nerves — you’re juggling supply shopping, adjusting work schedules, arranging after-school care, and maybe quietly worrying about whether your child will thrive in their new environment.

Some parents feel the stress physically: the racing mind before bed, the to-do list that never shrinks, the quick temper that appears out of nowhere. Others carry guilt — “Am I supporting them enough? Did I miss a red flag?” And of course, there’s the invisible load of coordinating it all: remembering picture day, packing lunches, signing permission slips, while also holding space for your child’s emotional world.

Parental stress during this transitional time matters for you and for your kids. Research shows that parental stress directly influences children’s ability to regulate their own stress (Compas et al., 2012). In other words: kids often take their cues from us. If we’re running on empty, they notice.

**What Can Help Parents**

* **Simplify where possible**: Not every task needs to be perfect. Sometimes store-bought muffins for the bake sale are just fine.
* **Build your own routine**: Even five minutes in the morning to drink coffee quietly, or an evening walk, can serve as your anchor.
* **Reach out for support**: Whether that’s a co-parent, a friend, or another parent at school — sharing the load lightens it.
* **Model self-compassion**: Saying out loud, *“I’m feeling stressed too, but I’m working on taking a breath”* shows kids that it’s okay to feel stretched and still find ways through.

When parents care for themselves, they don’t just feel better — they create a calmer atmosphere at home. And that’s the soil where kids’ resilience grows.

**Coping Skills for Kids**

While parents work on their own stress, kids need tools too. Coping strategies can be simple: slow breathing, grounding through the senses, or repeating calming phrases like *“I can handle this.”* Practicing these before school starts makes them easier to use when worries pop up.

**Addressing the “What Ifs”**

Kids love to throw out “what if” questions: *What if I don’t find my classroom? What if nobody talks to me at lunch?* Walk through these together, step by step. Talking out possible solutions turns vague dread into something concrete and manageable.

**Get Familiar With School Early**

If possible, walk the school hallways, meet the teacher, or simply drive past the building before the first day. The more familiar it feels, the less scary it becomes.

**When to Reach Out for More Help**

If [**anxiety**](https://risehealingcenter.com/anxietytherapyonline) leads to repeated school refusal, ongoing physical complaints, or distress that doesn’t ease, extra support may be needed. Counseling has been shown to help kids reduce school-related anxiety and gain coping tools that can help build their resilience and feel more empowered to handle the challenges of life.

**Final Thoughts**

Back-to-school isn’t just a transition for kids — it’s one for the whole family. The more parents care for themselves, the more they can be present for their kids. Anxiety may still show up, but it doesn’t have to run the show. With steady routines, open conversations, and self-care for both kids and parents, families can move into the school year with less stress and more confidence.

1njhtm5,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1njhtm5/explore_best_pour_over_coffee_maker_hario_v60/,Explore Best Pour Over Coffee Maker Hario V60 Worth the Hype,"Testing the Hario V60 Plastic Coffee Dripper, model VD-01T, over the past few weeks has been quite the enlightening experience for my coffee routine. As someone who appreciates a well-crafted cup of coffee but prefers a simple and portable setup, this particular pour-over brewer seemed promising from the get-go. The cone design intrigued me, especially after reading how it enhances extraction with a specialized water flow. Here's my comprehensive breakdown of how this product performs in daily life.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The clear plastic construction initially gave me pause since I tend to associate sturdiness with glass or ceramics. Yet, the lightweight aspect turned out to be an asset. I could toss it in my backpack without worrying about damage, making this ideal for travel or office use. The spiral ribs inside the cone are more than just eye-catching—these grooves aid in the expansion of coffee grounds, contributing to a consistently flavorful brew. This design feature, combined with a large central hole, allows for precise control over water flow, which is great whether you're a pour-over novice or a seasoned fanatic. Surprisingly, the plastic doesn’t feel cheap; instead, it offers durability without compromising performance.

**Brewing Performance**  
Bang-on would be the best way to describe my brewing results. Although the setup is purely manual, it produces coffee comparable to more high-tech brewing methods. The V60 might be minimalist in design, but its functionality is sublime. I experimented with multiple grind sizes, and the dripper handled adjustments fluidly. Finer grinds resulted in slower extraction and deeper flavor layers, while medium grounds brewed quicker and lighter cups. My coworker, who has a less patient palate, noted it didn’t require much trial and error to get a satisfying brew in under three minutes. The interaction between the paper filter and the cone shape exceeded expectations, especially with coffees that had fruity or floral flavor notes.  

[Discover if Hario VD-01T is on sale at Amazon.](https://newcookware.com/p/b001hc9gic/)

**Ease of Use**  
Using this dripper is insanely straightforward. Even my partner, who's far from a coffee aficionado, managed to get the hang of it after one demo. All it takes is placing it atop your mug, inserting a cone filter, adding coffee, and pouring hot water in a controlled circular motion. Cleanup is equally hassle-free, which matters for those of us who aren’t morning people. A quick rinse does the job—though I recommend giving the ribs an occasional scrub to ensure no leftover oils build up.

**Good Points**  
• Lightweight and portable, perfect for travel or small kitchens  
• Spiral ribs for optimal coffee expansion  
• Simplistic design allows versatile brewing styles  
• Easy to maintain and clean  

**Areas for Improvement**  
• Plastic material may not feel premium enough for some  
• Doesn’t retain heat as well as ceramic alternatives  
• Requires buying specific cone filters  

**Competing Products**  
When placed side-by-side with ceramic or stainless steel pour-over brewers like the Kalita Wave or Chemex series, the Hario V60 Plastic Dripper can seem like an underdog. However, its lightweight versatility and ease of transport outshine those bulkier competitors. While the Kalita provides a flatter bed for brewing and slightly adjusts flavor results, I struggled with its portability in comparison. The Chemex, though aesthetically gorgeous, often felt cumbersome to carry along, and cleanup was considerably more tedious. The V60's setup, favoring simplicity and efficiency, thus sets it apart, especially for occasional coffee drinkers or outdoor enthusiasts.

**Affordable Quality**  
Its cost-efficiency might be one of the strongest arguments for this manual coffee brewer. It offers barista-quality coffee pour-overs at a fraction of the price of most high-end coffee machines or premium brewers, making it perfect for individuals wanting value without compromise. You don’t need a high-tech espresso machine to experience flavorful, rich coffee at home or on the go, thanks to this compact gadget.

1njhthh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1njhthh/should_you_choose_the_ispring_fc15b_carbon_block/,Should You Choose the iSpring FC15B Carbon Block Filter Review for Your Water System?,"The iSpring FC15B High Capacity Activated CTO Carbon Block Filter Replacement Cartridge for Under Sink and Whole House Water Filtration System made its way into my home after some thorough research, and after weeks of testing, I’ve gathered my thoughts on its performance, strengths, and shortcomings. My experience with this product has been enlightening, especially considering how it claims to filter water efficiently across various systems. There are highlights and, naturally, a few caveats that I’ve encountered during its use.

**Design and Quality**  
The build of this filter, crafted from high-quality coconut shell carbon, feels solid and instills confidence in its performance right out of the box. Its compact yet substantial design ensures easy installation, and I appreciated that it fit seamlessly into my existing under-sink water filtration system. The filter’s 10""x4.5"" size worked as advertised, and the fact that it’s individually sealed for freshness confirms its careful manufacturing process. However, I did notice that the compact fabrication tech sometimes made it feel too dense, leading to minor flow rate reductions in some scenarios.

**Exceptional Performance**  
What impressed me most is how efficiently this carbon block filter reduces free chlorine while significantly improving taste and odor. I’ve used many filters in the past, but the water flowing after installing this felt refreshingly clean—like a notable improvement in purity. The filter does a commendable job of knocking out cloudiness and various organic compounds such as herbicides and industrial solvents. My morning coffee tasted better with filtered water, and even the family noticed the positive difference during meals.

[Ready to buy iSpring FC15B? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b01m0dvv2b/)

**Ease of Use and Setup**  
Setting this filter up was surprisingly simple. Compatible with multiple systems, such as the iSpring WGB21B and other 10""x4.5"" models, I didn’t need any extra tools or tech support to get it working. The instructions were straightforward, although I’d recommend following the replacement guidelines carefully to avoid installation mishaps. My coworker had trouble with a similar filter from another brand due to vague instructions, but this wasn’t the case here. However, the product might require slight adjustments depending on the filtration system you pair it with.

**Long Filter Life**  
One of the significant advantages of this product is its long-lasting filter life. Promising up to 50,000 gallons, it’s designed to operate effectively for about six months under standard usage. I didn’t have to think about replacing it weekly, as is often the case with less robust alternatives. This longevity also makes it environmentally friendly, reducing frequent waste. However, I must point out that you do need to monitor your water quality; heavily sedimented water might reduce its lifespan slightly.

**Good Aspects**  
- Removes up to 99% of chlorine, improving water quality noticeably.  
- Highly compatible with standard under-sink and whole-house filtration systems.  
- Offers a long filter lifespan with optimal performance.  

**Limitations**  
- Can slightly slow down flow rates when paired with systems under specific conditions.  
- Works best with moderate water quality—may not last as long with higher contaminant levels.  

**Product Competitors**  
Several competing products were considered before I landed on this carbon block filter, notably options like the Culligan HD-950A Heavy Duty Housing and the Whirlpool WHKF-GD25BB. Compared to the Whirlpool filter’s average contaminant removal, the iSpring filter outpaces it in chlorine reduction and taste enhancement. However, the Culligan model offers a slightly more durable casing, especially for households experiencing water pressure fluctuations. That said, the iSpring unit matches—or even exceeds—its competitors in the critical categories of filtration longevity and chlorine removal. Where the rivals fall short is in offering a universal fit across diverse configurations, which made this filter the winner for versatility in my setup.

**Cost Efficiency**  
From a price-performance perspective, the iSpring FC15B provides excellent value for the money. The filter’s efficiency in removing contaminants like chlorine, improved water taste, and its compatibility with existing systems proved that it’s worth every penny.

1njht10,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/1njht10/transition_from_snoo_to_crib/,Transition from snoo to crib,"I've been quietly learning from this sub for a while, and I really appreciate all the shared experiences. My son turns 5 months tomorrow, and I recently decided to do a cold turkey transition from the Snoo to the crib.

He’s been *somewhat* sleep trained, but mostly through increasing the Snoo levels—so I didn’t have to let him cry. When I tried transitioning with one arm out, he kept waking up all night, so I went straight to full crib, no Snoo.

# Night 1:

* He woke up every hour for the first three hours.
* I used a gentle Ferber method: started with 3-minute intervals, increasing by 1 minute each time.
* Only had to go to 4 minutes once—he settled with some shushing.
* Fed at midnight.
* At 5am he woke up, I accidentally picked him up and went to cosleep in my daughter’s empty bed (I was tired and forgot what I was doing).
* He woke for the day at 7am (normally wakes between 6–6:30).

# Night 2:

* Woke once after an hour, then again at 2am for a feed.
* Woke at 5am again, but this time I remembered to shush him back to sleep.
* He slept until 5:30am, but then got very wiggly and upset (spitting out the binky, flailing arms/legs).
* I ended up picking him up and cosleeping again until 7am.

I don’t mind cosleeping for a couple of hours—he moves enough that I wake easily, and the bed is safe and empty. But I’d really like to start my day at 6:30am to prep breakfast, my daughter’s lunch, and coffee before work.

I also know cosleeping isn’t the safest option long-term. So I’m wondering:

* Should I apply Ferber at 5am too?
* If I try to calm him and he doesn’t settle, when should I start the interval timer?
* Or I should just cosleep and wake both of us at 6:30am?

I feel like overall night training is going well, and I know he’s still learning. But I worry I’m undoing progress by picking him up at 5am every day. At that hour, he’s so wiggly and unsettled that I give up quickly because I’m sleepy and tired.

Any advice would be appreciated! For context:

* Naps are all contact naps for now (2.5-3h of daytime sleep)
* He goes to bed at 6:30pm but we're increasing slowly to 7pm (yesterday was 6:53pm)
* His wake windows are 2/2/2/2.5.

Both sound brutal in their own way — one hits your energy, the other hits your cravings.

First shot is not hot enough for me but the second one is. Coffee from my local roaster is very expensive so I hate to waste it. 

There doesn't seem to be a way to run just hot water through the brew spout. I even tried to trick it with pre-ground coffee mode (without any coffee) and it looks like there is a sensor that stops it from brewing without coffee. I suppose I could drop some cheap ground coffee but is there any other way to preheat this thing? 

Also, do the Delonghis have the same issue? I am still within my return period for the Jura.
