1gxwdh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvLiterateRP/comments/1gxwdh0/f_playing_a4a_dark_romance_psychological/,"[F playing A4A] Dark romance, psychological thrillers and more! ","Hello everyone! Thanks for reading my post. My name is Vale and I'm a 23 female roleplayer searching for other 18+ roleplayers willing to lose themselves in a journey full of drama, angst, betrayals and controversial themes.  
I must confess, I'm particularly interested in very dark roleplays at the moment, so give me dramatic, gritty and angsty stories please! For this reason, if you're not comfortable with playing/playing against really morally grey characters (to the point of them being assassins, serial killers and so on), I'm probably not the partner for you.  
I have a couple of plots in mind, and they will be listed down below!  


\***About me and my preferences:***

\- I'm 23, so I won't roleplay with minors. Please do not interact if you're one. Said this, your age doesn't matter to me as long as you are 18+. The main characters must be 18+ as well, although I can accept side characters that break the rule (if they make sense to the story and are not involved in anything sexual, of course).
  
\- I write in 3rd person, past tense. No first person, please. It makes me uncomfortable.- I'm female, but play both female and male characters. My favourite pairings are M×M or M×F, and I unfortunately don't play F×F couples. Your gender in real life or your sexual preferences don't matter to me: all members of the LGBTQ+ community are safe and welcome. I will respect your pronouns and your identity if you're willing to share it on the Internet. If not, that's not an issue either. However, for this roleplay, I would prefer for you to play a cis woman or a cis man.  

\- I consider myself to be advanced literate, and, although English is not my first language, I believe I have a good grasp of its grammar, spelling and punctuation. I'm not searching for one-liners or low effort roleplays, but I cannot handle novella roleplays (600+ words) either, at the moment. I did them in the past, and they become a bit of a chore after a while; I typically write 3/4 paragraphs (around 2000/3000 characters, within the Discord limit, but not scared to break it if the situation calls for it) and would like my partner to match my length. Length that could obviously be adjusted, depending on what's happening in the story or our inspiration.  

\- I'm pretty busy at the moment, so I aim to give my partners a reply every week, but it happens that I need a couple of extra days to organise my ideas and write them down. I really don't care about how long it takes for someone to type out a response, and I hope to find someone who's just as understanding.  

\- For me, roleplaying means collaborative writing. I love brainstorming ideas, discussing plot twists or just talking about our characters. About who they are, why they do what they do, who they could become and how. A bit like writing a book, but with another person. If you have a song that reminds you of our story, fanarts, drawings, reels or whatever, send them to me! I enjoy chatting OOC about what we are writing. This isn't in any way required, though: what I care about is having an enthusiastic partner, who doesn't force me to take the lead every time. Bring your ideas to the table, please! I promise I don't bite.  

\- I love stories that are filled with plot twists, drama, fights. I want our characters to shape who they are through the roleplay, make choices and mistakes, learning from them or not learning at all and doing them all over again. I'm not interested in good, perfect characters. Give me the aggressive, indipendent woman who doesn't give a damn about anyone but herself. Or the grumpy middle aged workaholic who's too hurt to love again. Give me a man who never does bad things—unless someone is not watching. A shy, boring woman who's tired to work infinite hours at the police station, until a serial killer tries to get her attention. I'll say no to characters that need to be pushed around all the time.  

\- NSFW content: YES, but not if that's the point of the story. The focus of this roleplay will be the relationship between our characters, and how events have the power and the ability to change it. It's about their feelings, and how those feelings challenge their beliefs or personality. I'm not here to get anyone off: while I enjoy NSFW themes and believe they give further informations on who the character is, that's not the focus of the story. I should also warn everyone that I absolutely love slow burn romance, and I'm a sucker for building tension over and over again, before getting to the point of releasing it. We will discuss boundaries, triggers and limits in DMs, and I will respect every single one my partner might have, asking them to do the same.  

\- Side characters: BIG YES! I love to create a world around our characters, see them interacting with other people, knowing them through them. I think they add so much to the story, if played well. I will play the necessary side characters, and I would like to have a partner who does the same.  

\***Possible plots:***  

\***[M×M o M×F\] ""Clues to my heart""***
\A new serial killers is terrorising Muse A's city, targeting a specific type of victims. Muse A is a troubled detective who recently came back to work after a traumatic experience, at the stritch condition of attending therapy and getting more rest.   
Muse B is a young, clever therapist who's slowly gaining Muse A's trust during their weekly sessions, while dealing his own traumatic, unsolved past. The relationship between the two steadily develops both professionally and personally, until boundaries and professional detachment become two confusing concepts: somehow, Muse B seems to casually be in the same places Muse A normally frequents, he acts like a friend more than a therapist, often moves the conversation towards prohibited themes.   
But Muse A is too busy thinking about the cases they have to solve to realise what is happening. Despite what his boss reminds them every day, they cannot rest until the serial killer is behind bars: because they left clues, clues that prove he knows something Muse A wants to keep hidden. Because the killer seems to be flirting with Muse A through their crime scenes in a very familiar way, lightly twisting the knife into wounds only Muse B knows about.   

\***[M×M o M×F\] ""Something's wrong with the new neighbour""***
\A man (Muse B) and a cheerful, bubbly five years old girl just moved in the house next to the one Muse A's shares with their husband. They recently lost the third member of their family, the girl's mother and Muse B's wife, and decided to change their surroundings to heal away from the big city.   
Muse A conquers the little girl's heart immediately, while slowly making their way into Muse B's one as well. But Muse A's husband is not happy with this new ""friendship"" and, in few weeks, new bruises appear on the body parts Muse A is not able to cover with clothes and makeup.   
Then, the shocking news: Muse A's husband body is found in the nearest lake, with no clues on who might be the responsible for the tragedy.   
While Muse A tries to adjust to the unreal situation, secrets and confusing informations about Muse B's past quickly become the favourite topic of discussion in the small city: his wife went missing months prior, and yet he insists on saying that she is dead. Someone swears to have seen Muse B talking with Muse A just the night of his death. He acts strangely whenever his wife is mentioned.   
(Bonus point if we make this a M/M story, and Muse B has internalised homophobia/isn't comfortable with his attraction for men at first.)  

\***[M×M o M×F\] ""Deadly tachycardia""*** 
\Two strangers decide to sign up on an online dating app to meet the love of their life. Perhaps out of boredom. A friend's advice. Just because it's easier than having to flirt with someone in a bar, even. Truth to be told, one of them has a very specific reason to be on the app. Muse A never talks about his job, but they were paid to make excellent jokes and appear as charming as possible. To find their way into their date's wounds and stab their heart— quite literally. They are eager to meet Muse B, who, on the other hand, finds every excuse to delay the first meeting.   
One night, surrounded by Muse B's bodyguards, Muse A finally gets to understand why the new mission is going to be so much harder than his previous ones: Muse B is far from being a Miss/Mr Nobody (who they are it's up to us!).  
While they try to conquer Muse B's trust and heart, Muse A will have to deal with his own feelings for someone who hides a dark secret of their own (they hired Muse B themselves? They are trying to destroy Muse B's business? Up for discussion!)  
(Bonus point if Muse B has some kind of cronich illness physical disability because I think it could add a layer of complexity to this particular story!)
  
\***[M×M and M×F, requires you to play two characters!\] ""The Royal swap""***
\Muse A is a princess, second in line for the throne after her twin brother, Muse C. The reign is involved in a bloody, terrifying war with the North, and Muse B's father, the kind of the North, is not willing to let go. With the excuse of creating an alliance between the two kingdoms, Muse A's father, the king of the South, decides to arrange a marriage between her and Muse B (first in line for the throne in the North), despite the girl's protests.   
Here comes Muse C. Knowing his sister is interested in sitting on the throne more than what he'll ever be, he decides to make a plan to follow their father's orders without having to sacrifice anyone's happiness. He cuts Muse A's hair, making very difficult for people to tell the two twins apart, then leaves the country to face the upcoming wedding.   
Muse C will have to face a cruel Prince with a hidden soft heart, who's slowly discovering his own sexuality after years of repression. Meanwhile, Muse B has to train like a man, dress like a man, act like a man, while hiding her feelings for the only person who can tell the difference between her and her brother— Muse D.   
What will happen when Muse A will receive the order to kill his spouse? For how long Muse B and D will manage to keep their true identity and relationship secret?   

\***[M×M o M×F\] Sick person/caretaker (heavily inspired by me before you) ""Let me in""***
\Muse A doesn't tolerate any type of help.   
That's the phrase her mother says, whenever she welcomes a new nurse, doctor, or maid in their ridiculously large house. Something happened in Muse A's past, a terrible accident that left them unable to care for themselves properly (the kind of injury can be discussed, as well as Muse A's abilities/disabilities. She might have a chronic illness, she might be paralysed, or whatever else comes to mind).   
Muse B doesn't really know why he accepted the job to begin with. Truth to be told, their financial situation is not the best (to be kind), and the family promised a large amount of money and regular payment. More importantly, a place to stay when Muse B couldn't even afford rent. They are there to keep Muse A company and help them with daily tasks, they are told, but it's not as easy as it seems: Muse A is rude, mostly annoyed by anything Muse B does or say, to the point of insulting them or ignoring them altogether.   
And yet, one night, something changes.   
But nothing is never how it appears.   
Could Muse B be responsible for the accident that destroyed Muse A's life? Or is Muse A not really sick, after all? 

\***Other dynamics i'd like to explore although I don't have anything specific in mind:***

- PRIEST X PROSTITUTE/NUN-PRIEST/ANYONE

* **Writing sample:**

Sitting in the underground, waiting for her stop, Rose thinks New York never looked so boring. It's one of those days, she fears: when the rain makes going anywhere, or talk to anyone, an incredibly tedious task. A homeless man is laying on the bench in front of her own, taking three seats instead of one. He's shivering and sweating at the same time, and it's safe to assume he's struggling with one of those harsh virus she exposes herself to whenever she doesn't feel like driving to work. The man is clinging to the paper cup in his right hand, although there are just few dollars in it. Rose can't stop thinking how a few thousands dollars donation could literally change his life, allowing him to buy medicines and perhaps make himself presentable for a decent job. 2000 dollars would be enough, she considers, with no real intention to actually help the person desperately trying to survive. It's a ridiculous sum of money for someone like her - one she could throw away and not miss in the slightest. And yet, she feels no empathy or pity for his tragedy. 

The doors open. 
A well dressed man limps in holding an heavy suitcase in one hand and his IPhone in the other. He sees the homeless man, and taps his pockets in search of money. Rose sees the wedding ring on his finger before anything else. 
He giggles as he puts a fifty in the paper cup: he's speaking with someone he calls *love* and *darling*, and other pet names the woman on the other line certainly doesn't deserve. His voice is deep. Warm. Like hot tea and honey under the duvet. 
And it happens just like that. Rose is on the other side of that phone now, being called *love*, and *darling*, and whatever else. She likes it. She likes *him*. 

Her prey doesn't see the danger until it's too late. Rose's standing behind him, and takes advantage of the train's rough stop to lose her balance and bump into him. The coffee she's holding *accidentally* falls on his blue shirt, and then falls on the ground. 
""Oh, my God! Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."" She says quickly, putting on the best shocked-embarassed face she can master. ""I'm so - God, I'm so clumsy."" 
The gentleman, *her* gentleman, is too nice to appear bothered or angry. ""Hey, hey, don't worry. It happens. It's nothing. I hated this shirt anyway."" There is a hint of humour in his voice, which Rose doesn't miss. 
She replaces her mask with an apologetic, innocent one. ""Well, that's - ugh."" She rubs her face like the whole thing it's just the last straw after a very long week. ""I can get it cleaned. If you give it to me - I mean, not now, but you could give me your number, and send the shirt, and I'll fix it."" 
He smiles. *An incredibly charming smile.* ""There is no need. Really. You're kind, but we're even. Don't worry."" 
""I insist."" Now she sounds too desperate. She sighs. ""Please. It would make me feel better. Like I did something good this week."" Acting like a victim is not her favourite flirting method, but it works too well on Mr. Gentleman. 
She leaves the metro with his number and a new mission. ",1,1732356266.0,AdvLiterateRP,0,1.0,False

In ""Your Brain on Art,"" Susan Magsamen and Ivy Ross explore how art influences brain function and enhances well-being. This fascinating book highlights the intersection of neuroscience and aesthetics, revealing that art—whether music, dance, or visual design—can transform the human mind.

**Key Insights:**

- **Neuroaesthetics**: Susan Magsamen, a neurology expert, delves into how our brains respond to artistic stimuli, supported by research from the International Arts + Mind Lab.

- **Practical Perspectives**: Ivy Ross, Google's VP of design, shares her insights on art's practical applications and its ability to foster creativity and joy.

- **Therapeutic Potential**: Art therapy has been shown to reduce stress, improve immune function, and enhance overall well-being. Just 45 minutes of artistic activity can lower cortisol levels, regardless of skill.

- **Art in Healing**: Beyond mental health, art impacts physical health by promoting neuroplasticity and being integrated into healthcare settings for holistic treatment.

- **Aesthetic Mindset**: Embrace an ""aesthetic mindset"" to enhance your life by consciously incorporating art into your daily routine, from savoring morning coffee to enjoying nature's beauty.

Art isn't just for galleries—it's an everyday medium that enriches our lives. For a deeper understanding of how art can shape your brain and experiences, listen to the podcast episode or visit the 20 Minute Books website.

Good morning, Puerto Morelos! Today, we are looking at a mix of sun and clouds in the morning which will provide the perfect opportunity for a leisurely walk on the beach or a refreshing dip in the ocean. However, as the day progresses, we can expect some light rain showers to move in. It might be a good idea to pack an umbrella or a light rain jacket if you're planning to be out and about later in the day.

With temperatures ranging from 25°C to 28°C, it's going to feel quite warm and humid, so be sure to stay hydrated and take breaks in the shade if you're spending time outdoors. The rain may bring a sense of coziness to the day, perfect for curling up with a good book or enjoying a hot cup of coffee at a local cafe.

Overall, it looks like a day of varied weather in Puerto Morelos – just remember to embrace whatever comes your way and make the most of it! Stay safe and have a wonderful day, folks! 🌂🌴🌊",1,1732356018.0,PuertoMorelos,0,1.0,False

1gxw76f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gxw76f,2 weeks set up with some learnings and questions to share ,"So what I basically learned is
- starting with too many floating plants - I got Phyllanthus fluitans in vitro - has a big impact on the water and snails as you could see after a couple of days that because of the decay etc the bacteria went nuts and snails are staying only on top. I would probably start with half floating plants next time and leave the other half in another vase. Also the decaying leaves a lot of small roots on the bottom which does not look very pleasing
- I read too late that Bucephalandra sp. ""Mini Needle Leaf"" needs a circled tank to better thrive. The plant does not look very well right now but I am hopeful that it will get eventually better. Won’t touch it 
- all other plants are fine as far as I can tell
- I got 8 RH snails (brown leopards and blues) of which 1 unfortunately died. I guess I was too early and should have waited a couple of days more. The rest is doing fine though and I am already seeing eggs. Because I was worried about food, I put in bio cucumber and banana peel for 1-2 days which they didn’t really eat 
- water parameters seem ok 
- water gets brown after a couple of days likely because of the driftwood etc maybe also because I put in catappa leaves?

Now to my questions:
- I don’t want to overcomplicate water testing and have the tetra test 6in1 kit and the pro jbl squarest for ph. I bought the ph test because I wanted to check if it’s ok for the snails. Can you recommend an easy test kit that is not too expensive? Don’t want to buy a coffee. The vase will only be for snails and shrimps

I recently found something on the floor after my dog fell down the stairs. At first, I thought it might be part of his nail, but upon closer inspection, it looked more like a seed or nut. It has a dark, smooth surface and is shaped like a small coffee bean. It has a noticeable indentation or hole at one end.

Here’s a more detailed description: • Size: Roughly the size of a coffee bean. • Texture: Smooth but with a wood-like feel. • Shape: Coffee bean-like with a noticeable indentation at one end. • Color: Dark, almost black, with a reddish-brown outer layer. • Other info: I don’t have coffee beans in my house, and I haven’t seen anything like it before.

Does anyone recognize this? Could it be from a plant or tree? I’m hoping to figure out what it is. Thanks for any help or insights! - Didn't think it could be a coffee been because coffee beans grow in fruits and don't have an outer shell but who knows 😭

To be honest, I didn’t even realize how much my liver impacted my weight loss journey and overall well-being. I had been stuck in a rut, feeling bloated, lethargic, and frustrated. Diets would work for a while, then stop. Workouts felt like punishment, yielding minimal results. But something about this approach, focusing on detox and revitalization from the inside out, made me pause and say, ""What if?""

# [Learn More About Online Urgent Care Services – Click Here](https://tinyurl.com/yrzkb74t)

The first week was subtle. I didn’t experience any fireworks or overnight transformations, but something shifted. My digestion felt smoother, less bloated after meals. By week two, I noticed a gradual lift in my energy levels. I wasn’t reaching for that second cup of coffee by 11 AM. Instead, I felt… light. Not just physically, but mentally.

Here’s where things got really exciting. Around the third week, I hopped on the scale. The numbers hadn’t moved dramatically—just a pound or two—but my body *felt* different. Clothes that had been snug were now comfortable. My skin had a noticeable glow, and my energy had gone from ""barely surviving"" to ""thriving."" Friends started asking if I had changed something in my routine.

And I had. But it wasn’t just about losing weight. This was deeper. I realized my liver had been working overtime, bogged down by years of poor dietary choices and environmental toxins. The product wasn’t just about helping me shed a few pounds; it was about restoring balance and vitality to my body. Once I gave my liver the support it needed, everything else seemed to fall into place.

What truly sold me was the ease. I didn’t have to overhaul my entire life. No extreme diet plans, no back-breaking exercise routines. Just a simple addition to my daily schedule that delivered results steadily and consistently.

By the end of the second month, I felt like a new person. My waistline was noticeably slimmer, my energy stayed high throughout the day, and I had a mental clarity that I hadn’t experienced in years. The best part? It felt sustainable. No crash diets, no ""yo-yo"" effect. Just a steady progression toward the best version of myself.

If you’re like I was, tired of the cycle of frustration and ready for something that actually works, this could be the game-changer you’ve been waiting for. It’s not about chasing the next fad; it’s about giving your body what it truly needs to thrive. That’s what worked for me. And if you’re willing to take a chance, it might just work for you too.

Let’s talk science. Because once I started seeing results, I wanted to understand *why*. What made this product so effective where countless others had failed? The answer lay in its unique approach—targeting the liver as the key to unlocking better health and weight management.

The liver is a powerhouse organ. It’s responsible for detoxifying the body, metabolizing fat, and regulating energy levels. But here’s the kicker: when the liver gets bogged down with toxins, it struggles to do its job effectively. This can lead to fat storage, low energy, and a sluggish metabolism. Basically, if your liver isn’t functioning optimally, you’re fighting an uphill battle when it comes to weight loss and overall health.

Liv Pure takes a two-pronged approach: **detox and rejuvenation.** The formula is built on natural ingredients that are scientifically backed to support liver health. Ingredients like sylimarin (from milk thistle), berberine, and betaine are known for their liver-cleansing properties. These compounds help the liver eliminate toxins, reduce inflammation, and repair damage caused by years of stress and poor diet.

Then there’s the rejuvenation aspect. Once the liver is detoxed, Liv Pure focuses on enhancing its ability to metabolize fat and produce energy. This is where ingredients like chlorogenic acid and resveratrol come into play. These compounds help boost the liver’s fat-burning capabilities, improve insulin sensitivity, and promote cellular energy production.

Here’s what really stood out to me: the formula is rooted in research. There’s nothing random about the ingredient list. Each component has a specific role, working in synergy to create a comprehensive solution. The product doesn’t just tackle symptoms; it addresses the root cause of many health challenges—an overworked and underperforming liver.

What impressed me even more was how it worked without disrupting my daily routine. No crazy detox diets or harsh regimens. Just a simple, science-backed supplement that quietly got to work, transforming my body from the inside out.

The science gave me confidence, but the results sealed the deal. I wasn’t just seeing changes on the outside—I was feeling the difference on the inside. Better energy, improved digestion, and a metabolism that was finally firing on all cylinders. It was like my body had been stuck in first gear, and Liv Pure helped shift it into overdrive.

Understanding how Liv Pure works only deepened my appreciation for it. It’s not a quick fix; it’s a solution rooted in the fundamental biology of how our bodies function. And when you support your body the way it’s meant to be supported, the results aren’t just powerful—they’re life-changing.

**1. How long does it take to see results?**  
Everyone’s body is different, but most people start noticing subtle changes within the first couple of weeks. For me, the real transformation kicked in around week three. Consistency is key—stick with it, and you’ll see results.

**2. Is Liv Pure safe?**  
Absolutely. The formula is made from natural ingredients that have been rigorously tested for safety and efficacy. Plus, it’s free from harmful chemicals, fillers, or artificial additives. Of course, if you have specific health concerns or are on medication, it’s always a good idea to consult your doctor first.

**3. Will it work if I don’t change my diet or exercise routine?**  
Yes, it works regardless of your current lifestyle. That said, I found that adding in a few healthier choices—like eating more whole foods and moving a bit more—amplified the results. Liv Pure isn’t about drastic changes; it’s about creating sustainable progress

**4. Are there any side effects?**  
I didn’t experience any side effects, and most people report the same. Since the ingredients are natural and designed to support your body, it’s unlikely you’ll encounter negative reactions. However, if you have allergies or sensitivities, check the ingredient list to ensure it’s a good fit for you.

**5. Do I need to take it forever?**  
Not at all. Liv Pure is about restoring balance, not dependency. Once your liver is functioning optimally and your body is back on track, you can scale back. Some people use it seasonally as a gentle detox or whenever they feel their body needs a reset.

**6. Is it worth the investment?**  
If you’re serious about improving your health, absolutely. I’ve spent money on countless products that promised the moon but delivered nothing. Liv Pure was different—it worked. For me, the value far outweighed the cost because it gave me results I could see, feel, and sustain.

**7. What if it doesn’t work for me?**  
That’s the beauty of it—there’s no risk. Liv Pure comes with a satisfaction guarantee, so if it doesn’t work for you, you can get your money back. It’s as simple as that.",1,1732354875.0,newyorkknicks,0,1.0,False

By the end of the second month, I felt like a new person. My waistline was noticeably slimmer, my energy stayed high throughout the day, and I had a mental clarity that I hadn’t experienced in years. The best part? It felt sustainable. No crash diets, no ""yo-yo"" effect. Just a steady progression toward the best version of myself.

If you’re like I was, tired of the cycle of frustration and ready for something that actually works, this could be the game-changer you’ve been waiting for. It’s not about chasing the next fad; it’s about giving your body what it truly needs to thrive. That’s what worked for me. And if you’re willing to take a chance, it might just work for you too.

Let’s talk science. Because once I started seeing results, I wanted to understand *why*. What made this product so effective where countless others had failed? The answer lay in its unique approach—targeting the liver as the key to unlocking better health and weight management.

The liver is a powerhouse organ. It’s responsible for detoxifying the body, metabolizing fat, and regulating energy levels. But here’s the kicker: when the liver gets bogged down with toxins, it struggles to do its job effectively. This can lead to fat storage, low energy, and a sluggish metabolism. Basically, if your liver isn’t functioning optimally, you’re fighting an uphill battle when it comes to weight loss and overall health.

Liv Pure takes a two-pronged approach: **detox and rejuvenation.** The formula is built on natural ingredients that are scientifically backed to support liver health. Ingredients like sylimarin (from milk thistle), berberine, and betaine are known for their liver-cleansing properties. These compounds help the liver eliminate toxins, reduce inflammation, and repair damage caused by years of stress and poor diet.

Then there’s the rejuvenation aspect. Once the liver is detoxed, Liv Pure focuses on enhancing its ability to metabolize fat and produce energy. This is where ingredients like chlorogenic acid and resveratrol come into play. These compounds help boost the liver’s fat-burning capabilities, improve insulin sensitivity, and promote cellular energy production.

Here’s what really stood out to me: the formula is rooted in research. There’s nothing random about the ingredient list. Each component has a specific role, working in synergy to create a comprehensive solution. The product doesn’t just tackle symptoms; it addresses the root cause of many health challenges—an overworked and underperforming liver.

What impressed me even more was how it worked without disrupting my daily routine. No crazy detox diets or harsh regimens. Just a simple, science-backed supplement that quietly got to work, transforming my body from the inside out.

The science gave me confidence, but the results sealed the deal. I wasn’t just seeing changes on the outside—I was feeling the difference on the inside. Better energy, improved digestion, and a metabolism that was finally firing on all cylinders. It was like my body had been stuck in first gear, and Liv Pure helped shift it into overdrive.

Understanding how Liv Pure works only deepened my appreciation for it. It’s not a quick fix; it’s a solution rooted in the fundamental biology of how our bodies function. And when you support your body the way it’s meant to be supported, the results aren’t just powerful—they’re life-changing.

**1. How long does it take to see results?**  
Everyone’s body is different, but most people start noticing subtle changes within the first couple of weeks. For me, the real transformation kicked in around week three. Consistency is key—stick with it, and you’ll see results.

**2. Is Liv Pure safe?**  
Absolutely. The formula is made from natural ingredients that have been rigorously tested for safety and efficacy. Plus, it’s free from harmful chemicals, fillers, or artificial additives. Of course, if you have specific health concerns or are on medication, it’s always a good idea to consult your doctor first.

**3. Will it work if I don’t change my diet or exercise routine?**  
Yes, it works regardless of your current lifestyle. That said, I found that adding in a few healthier choices—like eating more whole foods and moving a bit more—amplified the results. Liv Pure isn’t about drastic changes; it’s about creating sustainable progress

**4. Are there any side effects?**  
I didn’t experience any side effects, and most people report the same. Since the ingredients are natural and designed to support your body, it’s unlikely you’ll encounter negative reactions. However, if you have allergies or sensitivities, check the ingredient list to ensure it’s a good fit for you.

**5. Do I need to take it forever?**  
Not at all. Liv Pure is about restoring balance, not dependency. Once your liver is functioning optimally and your body is back on track, you can scale back. Some people use it seasonally as a gentle detox or whenever they feel their body needs a reset.

**6. Is it worth the investment?**  
If you’re serious about improving your health, absolutely. I’ve spent money on countless products that promised the moon but delivered nothing. Liv Pure was different—it worked. For me, the value far outweighed the cost because it gave me results I could see, feel, and sustain.

**7. What if it doesn’t work for me?**  
That’s the beauty of it—there’s no risk. Liv Pure comes with a satisfaction guarantee, so if it doesn’t work for you, you can get your money back. It’s as simple as that.",1,1732354861.0,newyorkknicks,0,1.0,False

Yet, here I was, staring at a product claiming to target something I hadn’t paid much attention to: liver health.

To be honest, I didn’t even realize how much my liver impacted my weight loss journey and overall well-being. I had been stuck in a rut, feeling bloated, lethargic, and frustrated. Diets would work for a while, then stop. Workouts felt like punishment, yielding minimal results.

The first week was subtle. I didn’t experience any fireworks or overnight transformations, but something shifted. My digestion felt smoother, less bloated after meals. By week two, I noticed a gradual lift in my energy levels. I wasn’t reaching for that second cup of coffee by 11 AM. Instead, I felt… light. Not just physically, but mentally.

Here’s where things got really exciting. Around the third week, I hopped on the scale. The numbers hadn’t moved dramatically—just a pound or two—but my body *felt* different. Clothes that had been snug were now comfortable. My skin had a noticeable glow, and my energy had gone from ""barely surviving"" to ""thriving."" Friends started asking if I had changed something in my routine.

And I had. But it wasn’t just about losing weight. This was deeper. I realized my liver had been working overtime, bogged down by years of poor dietary choices and environmental toxins.

The liver is a powerhouse organ. It’s responsible for detoxifying the body, metabolizing fat, and regulating energy levels. But here’s the kicker: when the liver gets bogged down with toxins, it struggles to do its job effectively. This can lead to fat storage, low energy, and a sluggish metabolism. Basically, if your liver isn’t functioning optimally, you’re fighting an uphill battle when it comes to weight loss and overall health.

Liv Pure takes a two-pronged approach: **detox and rejuvenation.** The formula is built on natural ingredients that are scientifically backed to support liver health. Ingredients like sylimarin (from milk thistle), berberine, and betaine are known for their liver-cleansing properties. These compounds help the liver eliminate toxins, reduce inflammation, and repair damage caused by years of stress and poor diet.

Then there’s the rejuvenation aspect. Once the liver is detoxed, Liv Pure focuses on enhancing its ability to metabolize fat and produce energy. This is where ingredients like chlorogenic acid and resveratrol come into play. These compounds help boost the liver’s fat-burning capabilities, improve insulin sensitivity, and promote cellular energy production.

Here’s what really stood out to me: the formula is rooted in research. There’s nothing random about the ingredient list. Each component has a specific role, working in synergy to create a comprehensive solution. The product doesn’t just tackle symptoms; it addresses the root cause of many health challenges—an overworked and underperforming liver.

What impressed me even more was how it worked without disrupting my daily routine. No crazy detox diets or harsh regimens. Just a simple, science-backed supplement that quietly got to work, transforming my body from the inside out.

The science gave me confidence, but the results sealed the deal. I wasn’t just seeing changes on the outside—I was feeling the difference on the inside. Better energy, improved digestion, and a metabolism that was finally firing on all cylinders. It was like my body had been stuck in first gear, and Liv Pure helped shift it into overdrive.

Understanding how Liv Pure works only deepened my appreciation for it. It’s not a quick fix; it’s a solution rooted in the fundamental biology of how our bodies function. And when you support your body the way it’s meant to be supported, the results aren’t just powerful—they’re life-changing.

**1. How long does it take to see results?**  
Everyone’s body is different, but most people start noticing subtle changes within the first couple of weeks. For me, the real transformation kicked in around week three. Consistency is key—stick with it, and you’ll see results.

**2. Is Liv Pure safe?**  
Absolutely. The formula is made from natural ingredients that have been rigorously tested for safety and efficacy. Plus, it’s free from harmful chemicals, fillers, or artificial additives. Of course, if you have specific health concerns or are on medication, it’s always a good idea to consult your doctor first.

**3. Will it work if I don’t change my diet or exercise routine?**  
Yes, it works regardless of your current lifestyle. That said, I found that adding in a few healthier choices—like eating more whole foods and moving a bit more—amplified the results. Liv Pure isn’t about drastic changes; it’s about creating sustainable progress

**4. Are there any side effects?**  
I didn’t experience any side effects, and most people report the same. Since the ingredients are natural and designed to support your body, it’s unlikely you’ll encounter negative reactions. However, if you have allergies or sensitivities, check the ingredient list to ensure it’s a good fit for you.

**5. Do I need to take it forever?**  
Not at all. Liv Pure is about restoring balance, not dependency. Once your liver is functioning optimally and your body is back on track, you can scale back. Some people use it seasonally as a gentle detox or whenever they feel their body needs a reset.

**6. Is it worth the investment?**  
If you’re serious about improving your health, absolutely. I’ve spent money on countless products that promised the moon but delivered nothing. Liv Pure was different—it worked. For me, the value far outweighed the cost because it gave me results I could see, feel, and sustain.

**7. What if it doesn’t work for me?**  
That’s the beauty of it—there’s no risk. Liv Pure comes with a satisfaction guarantee, so if it doesn’t work for you, you can get your money back. It’s as simple as that.",1,1732354848.0,newyorkknicks,0,1.0,False
1gxw16g,https://www.reddit.com/r/newyorkknicks/comments/1gxw16g/customer_reviews_for_single_liv_pure_capsules/,Customer reviews for (Single) Liv Pure Capsules,"I was skeptical. Aren’t we all when it comes to promises that seem too good to be true? My days of chasing after quick fixes and miracle solutions were long behind me—or so I thought. Yet, here I was, staring at a product claiming to target something I hadn’t paid much attention to: liver health.

To be honest, I didn’t even realize how much my liver impacted my weight loss journey and overall well-being. I had been stuck in a rut, feeling bloated, lethargic, and frustrated. Diets would work for a while, then stop. Workouts felt like punishment, yielding minimal results. But something about this approach, focusing on detox and revitalization from the inside out, made me pause and say, ""What if?""

# [Learn More About Online Urgent Care Services – Click Here](https://tinyurl.com/yrzkb74t)

The first week was subtle. I didn’t experience any fireworks or overnight transformations, but something shifted. My digestion felt smoother, less bloated after meals. By week two, I noticed a gradual lift in my energy levels. I wasn’t reaching for that second cup of coffee by 11 AM. Instead, I felt… light. Not just physically, but mentally.

Here’s where things got really exciting. Around the third week, I hopped on the scale. The numbers hadn’t moved dramatically—just a pound or two—but my body *felt* different. Clothes that had been snug were now comfortable. My skin had a noticeable glow, and my energy had gone from ""barely surviving"" to ""thriving."" Friends started asking if I had changed something in my routine.

And I had. But it wasn’t just about losing weight. This was deeper. I realized my liver had been working overtime, bogged down by years of poor dietary choices and environmental toxins. The product wasn’t just about helping me shed a few pounds; it was about restoring balance and vitality to my body. Once I gave my liver the support it needed, everything else seemed to fall into place.

What truly sold me was the ease. I didn’t have to overhaul my entire life. No extreme diet plans, no back-breaking exercise routines. Just a simple addition to my daily schedule that delivered results steadily and consistently.

By the end of the second month, I felt like a new person. My waistline was noticeably slimmer, my energy stayed high throughout the day, and I had a mental clarity that I hadn’t experienced in years. The best part? It felt sustainable. No crash diets, no ""yo-yo"" effect. Just a steady progression toward the best version of myself.

If you’re like I was, tired of the cycle of frustration and ready for something that actually works, this could be the game-changer you’ve been waiting for. It’s not about chasing the next fad; it’s about giving your body what it truly needs to thrive. That’s what worked for me. And if you’re willing to take a chance, it might just work for you too.

One thing which mare me happy is that they have mentioned they use only RO water for food preparation.

There's 6 of us in total, including two who are young mothers (and walk with their babies). There's also a lady who has two dogs that she brings with her (a great dane and a black labrador). A few weeks ago we decided that we'd have coffee at one of our houses each Friday, after our walk. We've done this for the past three weeks and we've enjoyed it a lot. Each time the mothers have brought their babies and each time this lady has brought her dogs.

Now, I don't exactly hate dogs but I don't really like them. Her dogs in particular are kind of annoying, we have to stop every 10 seconds because they want to sniff and pee on every fence post, tree, bush, mailbox, and pole. It's actually kind of frustrating. This lady knows this; I made a bit of a fuss last time and said, we only walk for half an hour, you don't need to let them stop and sniff at every house. She was apologetic and agreed she'd move them along.

So this week was my turn to host, and everyone came back to mine after the walk. I went inside to prepare the coffees, and when I came back out I found she'd let the dogs off the leash and was letting them free have free run of the backyard. I didn't say anything but wasn't super impressed, especially since they were peeing on all of my bushes. I was particularly mortified when the dane cocked its leg and urinated on the wall of the house. The lady didn't appear to notice (or maybe she didn't care). I was really annoyed at this point.

When everyone was leaving, they all went through the main house. I had initially lead them through the side, on the way in, but I guess they just decided to go through the main house. The owner then lead her dogs in through the main house, without bothering to ask me if I was ok with it. At that moment, I had had enough, and yelled ""Get your g\*ddamn dogs out of my f\*cking house"". I think it was a cumulative buildup of several events of annoyance. She looked extremely offended and said ""what the f\*ck is your issue"" before leaving. The other ladies told me I had been overreacting and was being unreasonable. I feel like my response was valid, given the history of issues here.

Also, as if my annoyance wasn't enough, I found two poo bags in the outdoor trash, and her dogs hadn't pooped on the walk, which means she'd let them poop in my yard somewhere without me noticing. She did not ask permission for them to ""go"" in my yard. To think that two little kids were playing in that yard at that same time, truly disgusting.",1,1732354480.0,AmItheAsshole,25,0.54,False

My partner is at work and I've enjoyed a late breakfast with coffee, sitting only in the natural light that the snow reflects through the window to our garden. The dogs are sleeping on my chest and legs, and it's so quiet. 

I'm looking at used shoes online, though not much is coming up. I live in what could generously be described as a wasteland for high-quality footwear, but then, every now and then something pops up. 

Mostly, I spend saturdays going to thrift shops, and looking for treasure. I don't usually find anything, but it's a game of patience and a bit of a hobby. You don't have to buy something just because it fits, and it's fun to look at shoes even if they don't fit. 

Something I find frequently, are Italian and Spanish-made shoes with a blake stitch, often seemingly licensed production as the brand name is either defunct, obscure, a clothing brand, or all of the above. 

They usually feel very light, perhaps even flimsy. Somehow, it feels like they were made without love. I don't know if that's confirmation bias or a fact, but they lack the familiar feeling of specialty that I associate with quality; if you've ever held a truly special guitar, you don't even need to play it to know. If you've ever put on a truly special coat, you don't need to check the stitching to confirm. If you've ever had a truly special dinner, you know even before taking your first bite. 

... Then again, they wear rather well. Here's a pair I bought just after easter this year for some 15 €: 
https://i.imgur.com/fGx5ECS.jpg

They've been with me through a lot, including extensive work travels with high walking mileage. I frequently describe them as my favourite shoes, although it feels almost wrong considering what other things I own. Somehow, these just fit me perfectly, despite my freakish arches. This seems to often be the case with this type of shoe. 
I have never had any discomfort with these whatsoever. It was like putting on a pair of merino wool socks. I just don't notice that they're there. 
The only mishap I've ever had is that I once slipped and fell on a flat marbled floor. The outsole is a lacquered blue, and thus I decided they should have a rubber topper. 
They're marked as Piumi, which still exists as a shoe brand. I don't think they have their own manufacture, though, and something about the pictures of their current lineup makes them look cemented to my eyes. I can't read much Italian, though.

I recently bought these at the same Salvation Army store, though for 25 €:
https://i.imgur.com/ViH6e8v.jpg
... And it's more or less the same story. For some reason, they fit my weird feet. They're light and snug. It doesn't feel like a premium shoe, but it'll do the trick. It already had a topper over its lacquered burgundy outsole, which was actually quite tasteful. They're Spanish and marked as Martinelli, and it's the same story as the other pair. 

I'm writing this just as some thoughts on these shoes. They're cheap and obscure, but they do really work. They're very light on the foot, and because they're so light and sleek, make for excellent travel companions. Obviously, they don't lend themselves well to winter weather, so it'll be a long time until I get to wear them again. In the meantime, I'll just think about them. 

One oddity on which I want to remark, is that the leather on both shoes is unusually soft. It's supple and soft, the kind of stuff you'd love in a glove. Is this a sign of cheapness or of quality, I wonder? It's certainly much softer than any other shoe I have, by such a margin that there's little point in quantifying it. 

These shoes don't give me the ""I have to have this!"" feeling that I got when I held my country derbies in my hands, they feel almost anonymous. I was torn when I held the second pair. I didn't have brogues, and these fit. I wanted a second pair of travel shoes, and these were exactly what I needed. Why didn't I particularly want them? What's wrong with them? 
I let them sit for a week at the store and went back to buy them. I ended up with the question and answer of ""why not?"". It's a cheap shoe that will last for ages. Why not indeed.",2,1732353795.0,goodyearwelt,1,0.67,False

At the start of the year, around February, I (22m) slid into a girl's dms whom I hadn't talked to in something like 5 years. We hit it off and had some really good conversation for a week or so, and I eventually asked her to coffee. Our schedules never lined up, however, and despite continuing the good conversation for a time, our texting eventually fizzled out. She hit me back up in late July and we had more deep conversation – messaging multiple times per day and mutually getting to know each other – but again she just didn't make the time to meet.

I hadn't really thought about her since then, being busy with school, but she popped back up on my Insta feed today and got me thinking. I realize that I should probably forget her since she's never made the time for more than texts, but tbh that's a mistake I'm completely willing to make for a chance at gaining a new friend or something more :)

However, although I very much want to reach back out, I'm not sure I should. The last thing I want is to make her feel uncomfortable or seem stalkerish, but I do feel like we had a great connection. Do you guys think that it would creep her out at all if I was persistent and message her again after these past three months? If it's not creepy, any suggestions on the approach? If there's any other context I can provide, let me know.

Last week my boyfriend (which has ADHD and has a hard time thinking of the needs or wishes of others) made me coffee for breakfast. I was happy about it, because he rarely does these kind of things. When I asked him which milk he used he said „Oh… I don’t remember… I think I accidentally used the regular milk?“ and I was like „Ok, well you just have to drink two and I‘ll make me a new one!“. He was instantly annoyed and was kind of mad at me for whining about it and not just drinking it… making me feel like this was my fault…

So a few days ago, same spiel… he made me coffee. I take the first sip and immediately realise that’s not oatmilk. So I‘ll ask him again what milk he used. He responded „Oh, yeah, I forgot to use your milk. So you just have to drink regular milk this time, not so bad isn’t it?“ in an already annoyed tone with some hidden microaggression underneath… I was tired and not in the mood for a tantrum… so I just drank it… 

I haven’t told him, but it really upset me… it felt like he doesn’t care what I want and if I dare to speak up he tells me to stop whining about it…

*Log Date - 02.10.2138*

Recording starts with a click. A middle-aged human female voice begins speaking.

“Alright, thank you. I am starting the recording now. Don’t worry, as I said, this is just for my personal use so that I can better analyze it later. Now let’s get to introductions. My name is Dr. Cathaway.”

A squeaky dossur voice speaks in response.

“Good day. I’m, uhm… Minar. Nice to meet you, again.”

“Nice to meet you as well. Now, I see you signed up for relationship counseling. But you came alone. Does that have something to do with the topic of your visit?”

“Yes, doctor, I… I wanted to find some advice to help with my partner. He’s a human, and I am worried about our relationship and hoped you could offer some help.”

“Alright. What can you tell me about your relationship that troubles you?”

**Patient Recording Log Transcript #084-1**

*Log Date - 03.10.2138*

A voice of a young adult human male speaks.

“Nice to meet you, Dr. Cathaway. My name is Rodney Entlove. But I’m fine with Rod.”

“Good to meet you, Rod. Now, it’s not unseen, but uncommon to see people coming for relationship counseling alone. Perhaps you want to start by talking about that?”

There is a sigh from the male human.

“Yes, I… Well, I saw your advertisement, that you have a good experience working with aliens and since my partner is one, I thought you might be able to help.”

“I can do my best. What troubles you in regards to your relationship with your partner?”

“Well, nothing troubles me, really. I honestly love him, and adore him. But, well… He’s a dossur.”

There is a clattering noise.

“Sorry, it’s just my pen.”

“Isn’t it excessive to have both a notepad and audio recording, doctor?”

“Redudancy never hurt anyone. Now, as you were saying?”

**Patient Recording Log Transcript #083-1**

“You see, doctor, our relationship is very… uneven. I feel like I am just a leech on him. I am incapable of contributing in any way, I live in his apartment, eat his food, rely on him to even get around the place…”

“Well, considering the physiological differences, that seems like something that would naturally happen with both of you living here on Earth. Does that put a strain on your relationship?”

“Well, that’s the thing… I’m worried that it does.”

“You’re worried, but you don’t know for sure?”

“No, I don’t. But it’s not like I can ask him, right? He’s polite and gentlemanly, he wouldn’t admit it to my face anyway. But I always feel like I’m just a burden to him…”

**Patient Recording Log Transcript #084-1**

“As I said, I love him, despite our differences. We hit it off when I was doing contract work on one of the stations in orbit around Mileau and decided to move here together, but since then... Well, I feel like our differences are causing a strain.”

“In what way?”

“I think he’s… struggling to adapt. He lived his whole life on a world where he could just live normally, but here he has to rely on me to accommodate him with basically anything. And I think he resents it… The way I basically have whole control over his life now.”

“Can I ask what makes you think that it’s resentment your partner feels?”

“Well, I couldn’t just ask him. He’s so cheerful and upbeat, he’d never just tell me directly that he doesn’t like how much control I have. But I can tell the way he looks whenever he asks me for a lift or to get him something from the fridge. He looks downcast. And I just feel terrible. Like it’s me who’s making him feel so reliant on others, when he’d rather not be.”

“I see…”

**Patient Recording Log Transcript #083-1**

“And I can’t help it but feel terrible whenever I ask him for anything! I’m not being a good partner to him. I’m being more like… a needy pet, really.”

“Don’t say that about yourself, Minar.”

“But it’s true, isn’t it? I don’t even have a job, I’m contributing nothing. I don’t have a job to earn money, I’ve got nothing to my name and I can’t even reasonably help out around the apartment in any way. The best I could do was help with wiping the shelves but even then that's nothing.”

“I’m sure it’s not like that. You have worth beyond just your physical ability.”

“Maybe some philosophical intrinsic worth stuff. But I don’t have any practical worth, I am nothing more than a burden dragging him down.”

“And you’re certain that your partner doesn’t like that about you…?”

“Yes, of course. Every time I offer to help him with any physical chore, even when it’s something I can do, he just… flinches and makes that weird face and I can tell that he thinks that I’m wasting his time because I am useless!”

**Patient Recording Log Transcript #084-1**

“And he always insists on trying to help with household chores! It’s not that I don’t appreciate, but with how hard he pushes for it, I can’t help but feel like he doesn’t actually want to be taken care of. I like taking care of him, and most things to do are too much for someone his size to properly handle. It’s never been a problem for me, it’s not like he makes any messes… But he still always insists. And I can’t help but wonder... Does he hate the way I try to provide for both of us? Am I being too overbearing and controlling without even intending to?”

“Surely he would ask to leave if he really did dislike your cohabitation?”

“But he can’t! Without even intending I forced him into a position where he now can’t go! He doesn’t have anything to return to, and he can’t even go outside without me because what if he gets stepped on, or gets snatched by a bird or something horrible like that? He’s stuck with me and it’s all my fault!”

**Patient Recording Log Transcript #083-1**

“And it’s my fault he’s stuck with me too!”

“Why do you think that?”

“Because I basically guilt tripped him into taking me with him back to Earth! I never intended to come across so pathetic, I was getting by with my janitorial job... Enough to survive, at least, but I had to keep talking about how I want more out of life. And he took pity on me, I pushed him into it!”

“Were you actively trying to manipulate him into inviting you to his home and taking you in?”

“No… I was just frustrated with the way my life was going and he was there to listen to my rants. He supported me, helped me, he did get me out and I do enjoy being with him but I hate how much of a burden I ended up being in the process…”

**Patient Recording Log Transcript #084-1**

“He was one of the very few dossur on that station that actually was willing to give me the time of day, and he was always there to cheer me up. I really thought I was offering him a chance at better life when I suggested he come with me, but now… It’s like I shackled him down instead.”

“Did you intend to do something like that when you offered him to come live with you?”

“Of course not! I just realized how crappy his life was and thought that once back home, I could easily provide for both of us… It would be no trouble and he’s a wonderful person who deserves it. But… I ended up basically entrapping him instead. I am just so worried that because of how… uneven our relationship is, he no longer sees me as an equal partner but…”

There is a silent pause.

“But what, Rod?”

“But some sort of pet owner.”

**Patient Recording Log Transcript #083-1**

“And I’m starting to worry about the way I’ve been. The way I’ve clung onto him and basically had my every need taken care of while providing nothing in return... I’m worried that I’ve been acting like a spoiled… ‘pet’ I believe is the human term. I still love him with all my heart, especially with how much better my life has been since he got me to Earth, but still… I’m worried about being a dead weight making our relationship uneven…”

“It sounds like those are feelings you’ve been experiencing for a while.”

“Yes, I’ve… I’ve mostly been trying to ignore it. But recently, he… He proposed I get a course in programming. It’s an online course and it’d allow me to get a job and sustain myself. But the fact that he offered it to me… He really doesn’t want me around, I fear. I don’t want to lose him, but I can’t just remain a burden like that, can I?”

“I see… Does that mean you’re planning on taking the course?”

“I started it already, yes. It’s… not something I enjoy. I hoped that I could engage in art instead, but it’s more expensive and hard, and it’s not what he offered... But I felt like I had to take his offer because he wanted me to. And now I’m worried that the moment I finish the course he’ll show me to the door… I… I know I haven’t been a good partner to him and he’d be better off with someone who doesn’t fit in his pocket, but… I don’t want to lose him. Even if it was all just taking pity on me, I feel like he’s my whole world… and I don’t know what to do.”

“I… did try probing the other day. Seeing if he does really want to get away. So I looked up some online skill courses, picked a random one and mentioned it in passing. And he just jumped in excitement! He was so cheerful and thankful and I… I think he's been waiting for an opportunity like that for a while…”

“And you're sure he really was excited about that specifically?”

“He doesn't even like programming, I know he's not a fan! So for him to be so cheerful meant that he was glad to jump the first opportunity to unshackle himself from me. And now I'm so concerned that the moment he finishes that course, he'll walk out and I'll never see him again. I know it's extremely selfish of me… But I don't want us to end. Even if he would be much better off with a partner who he can actually embrace and sleep in one bed with without worrying about getting crushed, I… I do love him. So with all that, I have no clue what to do.”

“You are in an official relationship, are you not? Have you considered confronting your partner and discussing your feelings more openly?”

“I don’t… I don’t think I can…”

“I see. In that case I do suggest you at least try asking questions to better ascertain your partner’s feelings. From your own description, it sounds like you came to conclusions based on your perception, rather than anything specific. It’s possible the conclusion might be wrong, especially with how complicated cross-species nonverbal communication is.”

“I… I will try. Thank you, doctor.”

“Please, don’t think of yourself as a burden. Being differently abled from him, your relationship is unlikely to ever be truly even, but the whole point of a relationship is to be able to rely on each other. But sadly it seems our time is running out. Let's schedule another meeting early next week and you try asking your partner indirectly about how they feel, alright?”

“I'll… try to work up the courage to hint at it. Thank you doctor, it did feel good to at least be able to talk about it.”

**Patient Recording Log Transcript #084-1**

“And from your story, it sounds like you never asked him directly if that's how he feels?”

“I don't want to force him to lie. And he would have to lie if that's how he feels, because it's not like he has anywhere to go…”

“Tell you what. Our time is running out, but we can continue this next week. How about you, in the meantime, attempt to ask him indirectly? Drop hints, propose theoreticals? It would be better to know for sure either way, wouldn't it?”

“I'll try. It might be hard to come up with the right way to do it, I'm not really good at subtlety… Still, thank you, doctor. My head feels not as heavy, letting someone else know.”

I turned the second audio recorder off and put it next to the first on the table. For dramatic effect I did buy a second one just to be able to play two recordings intermittently.

I looked up and saw the pair staring at each other. The human was looking down at the dossur in his lap, one hand tightly gripping the arm of the chair, while the other gently caressed the fur on the dossur’s back. The dossur, in turn, was clutching at the human’s shirt with both paws, looking up. Both looked like they were about to cry, and neither seemed to perceive my presence anymore. 

“Now, I do value the privacy of my patients, but in this case, with your mutual unwillingness to confront each other, this felt appropriate.” I commented.

The pair were still completely taken with one another. 

“Well, you have an hour and it seems like you were given the boost you needed to start finding a more solid ground for your relationship. I'll step out for a coffee, and you, in the meantime, I suggest talk things out.”

As I stepped outside my office I heard two teary crying wails, one quieter and squeakier than the other, and just before I closed the door, I could see Minar hugged tightly against Rod’s face. I allowed myself a small smile as I kept walking. Couples counseling is always less about telling them what to do and more about getting them to actually talk to each other. And as weird as that relationship might be, I can definitely see that it's a real one. Only true lovestruck idiots would be so densely self destructive.",18,1732351562.0,NatureofPredators,4,0.96,False

All he could think of is getting some of the boob milk but it was impacting me negatively. He didn't want food for awhile after his first 6 months. He refused food. Then after finally eating food, there would be days that he will go one day with just breast milk.
Then it gets to the point that while running around, he would stop for a snack break. It drives me crazy when he just goes and tries to pull my shirt down to flash my boob.
It was becoming a huge inconvenience for me and upsets me because he would throw a fit for the sake of breastfeeding. He refuses to use a bottle and dislikes milk.

Today is finally the day I time to wean. I first tried the coffee bean, didn't work. Every feeding time, I try the bottle again, nope. Then I just simply reject him from trying. The cries hurt me. I feel very guilty because of the tears. Idk if my kiddo was trying to use his fake tears or something but it hurts. I didn't give in though.
Bed time and the kiddo tries again. Already tired and such, he tries to latch on again. I reject him and he tries. The tears and just seems like he still refuses to understand that it's time to go.
I wanted to cry too because I feel like I'm letting him down as a mom but my life style is being negatively impacted by his obsession to breastfeed.
I cannot clean, cook, eat, shower, do my hobbies, etc without him always fighting to latch onto my boob.
But I can't help but feeling sad about realizing it's time to let my 2 year old know that it is time to let go.",1,1732350345.0,breastfeeding,0,1.0,False
1gxuxyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTheTraveler/comments/1gxuxyw/where_to_eat_on_the_big_island_of_hawaii/,Where To Eat On The Big Island Of Hawaii?,"Hey everyone! I wanted to share my recent food adventure on the Big Island of Hawaii. After spending two weeks exploring this paradise, I've discovered some amazing spots that I just have to tell you about.

Let me start by saying that the Big Island's food scene is incredibly diverse. From traditional Hawaiian cuisine to modern fusion restaurants, there's something for every taste and budget.

One place that absolutely blew my mind was the Umekes Fish Market in Kailua-Kona. Their poke bowls are out of this world! The fresh ahi tuna literally melts in your mouth. Pro tip: try their ""Wet Hawaiian Style"" poke – it's a local favorite.

Speaking of local spots, you can't miss the farmers markets. The Hilo Farmers Market is where I found the sweetest apple bananas and freshest papayas I've ever tasted. The vendors are super friendly and always ready to let you sample their fruits.

For those looking for an authentic Hawaiian experience, I highly recommend booking a traditional luau. You get to taste kalua pork, poi, and other Hawaiian specialties while enjoying traditional dance performances. Speaking of experiences, I found some amazing food tours through https://athometouch.com/hawaii - they have some great deals and you even earn rewards for future bookings!

If you're in the Hilo area, you have to check out Moon and Turtle. Their seafood is caught daily, and their menu changes based on what's fresh. The coconut crusted fish is simply incredible.

Don't forget about the coffee! The Kona coffee region has tons of coffee farms offering tours and tastings. I visited Greenwell Farms and learned so much about coffee production while sipping some of the best coffee I've ever had.

For budget-friendly options, the local plate lunch spots are the way to go. I loved L&L Hawaiian Barbecue - their loco moco is perfect after a long day of swimming or hiking.

Want something really unique? Try some malasadas (Portuguese donuts) from Punalu'u Bake Shop. They're worth the drive to the southern part of the island.

Before I forget - if you're planning any food tours or cooking classes, check out https://athometouch.com/hawaii. I booked several experiences through them and saved quite a bit with their rewards program.

One last tip: don't be afraid to try the food trucks! Some of my best meals came from these mobile kitchens. The garlic shrimp trucks on the Hamakua Coast are especially amazing.

Remember, the Big Island is huge, so plan your food adventures according to where you're staying. Trust me, you won't run out of delicious options!

Let me know if you want specific recommendations for any area on the island. I've got plenty more suggestions!",1,1732350080.0,AskTheTraveler,0,1.0,False
1gxuwhj,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1gxuwhj/what_nofap_really_means/,What Nofap really means?,"Well the title seems to be wierd isn't? I have the eligibility to post about nofap coz I am following this concept from 2012 where I didn't even that there is a strong community like this sub exist. Myself I am a 27 years old guy from Southern part of India. Back in 2009 I watched porn for the first time it was the Pirates 5 by digital playground. I didn't know it was a porn and bought the dvd thinking it was the normal jack sparrow movie 🥲. The first time I saw nude women being banged by pirates and got excited. The precum happened for the first time,but I never new about masturbation until 2012 where I started humping the pillow and experienced the burst of joy and sensation which felt surreal. The first orgasm is unforgettable for everyone. But I felt instant guilt after doing that, I was addicted to sex stories especially and used to hump the shit out of pillow everyday. After doing this for a month I could notice the drop in energy and my eyes became dark, i looked soulless,thankgod i googled myself about who it happened and came to know about the side-effects of masturbation. Just in a month of my masturbating streak God made me realise the mistake I am doing but this didn't stop me from fapping it only made me to limit the doing. I used to fap every weak for few months and started doing that for every 15 days and days become months. Then I could go on without masturbating for 2,3 months easily, i didn't even knew that there are people who are fapping multiple times daily. When my friends told me once I was shocked and asked them ""how could someone fap multipile times daily and still living""? Coz I knew exactly how much energy you gonna loose when u fap daily. This was all between 2013 to 2016. When i finished my schooling and all, I was serious about quitting porn and masturbation because I was around 6.1ft at that time and weighed only 60kgs(132 lbs). Everyone used to call me a walking stick, i already had lot of anxiety and lower self confidence due to my traumatic childhood caused by my careless father never stood for our family. My school life was full of unfortunate events due to my low vibe, I was always stressed and bullied by random people. Then I realised I need to do something about this and started hitting gym in 2016 but due to money issues i couldn't do more than 4 months. I stopped going gym but in that 4 months I did gain some knowledge about workouts and all...later i started doing homeworkouts and in the meantime I already achieved my highest streak of 200+days of no fap. My skin looked crystal clear, my eyes didn't have that burning sensation, my hair was silky and all. Then again 3 years passed just like that, I joined the gym in 2020 January and to my surprise God had other ideas pandemic happened and again back to homeworkouts. Lot of ups and downs and lot of relapses and guilt but what I really understood is no matter what happens, how much broke we are, we don't have any other option than following nofap and noporn. I never had any serious relationship in my life coz of money 💰...I don't know about western countries but here in India highschool romance concept is a taboo...love life begins only after you leave the school. But due to pandemic my entire college life happened online and I didn't even know the names of my classmate girls properly. It may sound cringe for you guys but without money it's almost impossible to pull a girl in India...if you are a desi version of bradpit then you may have 1% of chance. The entire nofap concept varies from one people to another and one country to another. Never compare your journey to others and feel guilty. In my life the nofap made me more spiritual and more attached towards knowing the other side of human life's. It's not just about libido or other issues coz I never experienced ED or other libido issues, I used nofap mainly for my mental well-being. After 12 years right now I am 6.3 and 85 kg (187lbs) working in IT startup. Financially i am better now, planning to hit the gym without worrying about suppliments and food. I am still single and now my only focus is physique and money. Still a long way ahead but one thing is sure without nofap I would have ended up as a depressed couch potato. My advice to youngsters who are starting their journey is to avoid lust completely no matter whether it is a video,story or image. If you have Gf or married then try tantric sex but never avoid sex completely if you have a girl in your life. Other than that sugar,diary products, processed foods, spicy foods,tea,coffee will definitely trigger you. During nofap it is advisable do lot of physical activites, learn soft skills like coding, art etc. You need to put that energy somewhere or else you will suffer from heat related body issues. It's not about how much months and year you hold, it's about how much you improved your life by doing that. So guys never compare yourself to anyone, pray daily, eat well, sleep well, avoid social media if possible, learn money making skills and be the real risk taking man who fears only god.
