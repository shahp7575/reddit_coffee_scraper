1iohs7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea_Community/comments/1iohs7h/tea_vs_coffee_embracing_the_luxury_of_premium_teas/,Tea vs. Coffee: Embracing the Luxury of Premium Teas,"For generations, the debate between tea and coffee has sparked lively conversations around the globe. While coffee has long held the crown as the go-to morning jolt, a remarkable shift is underway—one that favors the refined allure of premium teas. This trend isn’t solely about flavor; it’s about embracing a holistic, mindful lifestyle that celebrates health, artistry, and sustainability.

# A Gentler Caffeine Boost

Premium teas deliver a refined caffeine experience that sets them apart from coffee. Rather than the sharp, fleeting spike of energy that can leave you jittery, premium tea offers a gentle, sustained lift. This means you stay alert and focused without the unwanted crash later. Many tea enthusiasts are now turning to expertly curated collections, such as those available from [Golden Tips Tea](https://www.goldentipstea.in), for a balanced start to the day.

# A Symphony of Flavors and Aromas

Coffee typically offers a limited range of roast profiles, whereas premium teas open up a world of diverse taste experiences. Whether it’s the delicate floral hints of[ Darjeeling](https://www.goldentipstea.in/collections/darjeeling), the bold, malty richness of Assam, or a complex herbal infusion, each blend offers its own story and character. This diversity allows you to choose a brew that matches your mood, the season, or even your specific health needs.

# Health Benefits That Go Beyond the Cup

The perks of premium tea extend far beyond a simple pick-me-up. [Premium green teas](https://www.goldentipstea.in/collections/green-teas) are packed with antioxidants, black teas are known to support heart health, and herbal blends help with digestion and relaxation. While coffee has its benefits, it often doesn’t offer the same comprehensive wellness package that premium teas provide—making them a smart choice for health-conscious individuals.

# An Inviting Ritual of Relaxation

Drinking premium tea is more than just consuming a beverage—it’s a mindful ritual. The process of steeping loose-leaf tea, watching the leaves unfurl, and savoring that first warm sip creates a moment of calm in an otherwise hectic day. This ritualistic experience is a stark contrast to the hurried nature of coffee consumption, offering a path to mindfulness and intentional living.

# Commitment to Sustainability

Today’s discerning consumers care not only about what’s in their cup but also how it’s made. Many premium tea producers emphasize sustainable and ethical sourcing, working closely with small-scale farmers and embracing eco-friendly practices. This commitment to environmental responsibility adds another layer of appeal to premium teas.

# Versatility in Every Cup

One of the greatest strengths of premium tea is its versatility. Enjoy it hot, iced, blended into lattes, or even infused into creative cocktails—tea adapts effortlessly to any occasion. This flexibility has driven its popularity in both home kitchens and upscale cafes, solidifying its status as a modern luxury beverage.

# Conclusion

While coffee will always have its loyalists, the rise of premium teas reflects a broader shift towards healthier, more mindful consumption. With their sophisticated flavors, myriad health benefits, and sustainable roots, premium teas offer not just a drink, but a full sensory experience. Whether you’re new to the world of tea or a seasoned connoisseur, there’s never been a better time to explore the rich, aromatic journey that premium tea offers.

Embrace the change and elevate your daily ritual with a cup of premium tea—your body, mind, and soul will thank you.

1iohqr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1iohqr4/is_frigidaire_wf2cb_the_best_refrigerator_water/,Is Frigidaire WF2CB the best refrigerator water filter? Read this review to find out!,"Using the Frigidaire WF2CB PureSource2 Ice and Water Filtration System has been an interesting experience. As someone who values clean, fresh-tasting water, I was eager to test the capabilities of this filter. Over the past months, our household put it through rigorous daily use—whether filling water bottles, making coffee, or simply enjoying a cold glass. Here’s what stood out to me.

The installation process was refreshingly simple. With just a press of the release button, the old filter popped out, and the new one clicked into place effortlessly. I ran the recommended three minutes of water to prime the filter, and voila—ready to go. This ease of use is a major win, especially for those who dread overly complicated appliance setups. My teenage son even asked if he could replace it next time, just to feel helpful!

Performance-wise, the difference in water taste is immediately noticeable. Our tap water, which previously had a faint chlorine odor, now tastes crisp and clean. The filter effectively removes contaminants like mercury, lead, and pesticides, which gives me peace of mind as a parent. I’ve also noticed that our ice cubes are clearer than before—no more cloudy, suspiciously murky-looking ice in our drinks!

One minor design change caught my attention. Unlike the older transparent versions of this filter, the WF2CB is white and opaque. While this looks sleek, it means you can’t visibly inspect the filter’s condition, so you’ll need to rely on your refrigerator’s reminder light. For some, this might be a drawback, but I personally found the light reminder feature handy and reliable.

[Check Frigidaire WF2CB price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/product-reviews/best-water-filter-frigidaire-wf2cb-review-b0032jts5e/)

**Pros**

* **Easy installation:** It genuinely takes less than a minute to replace. Perfect for busy households.
* **Noticeable improvement in water taste:** Crisp, clean water that rivals bottled options.
* **Effective contaminant removal:** Filters out lead, mercury, chlorine, and more.
* **Compatible with specific Frigidaire models:** Fits snugly without leaks, thanks to its precise design.
* **Affordable compared to frequent bottled water purchases:** Long-term savings are significant.

**Cons**

* **Opaque design:** You can’t visually check the filter’s wear and tear.
* **Limited compatibility:** Only works with specific Frigidaire refrigerator models.
* **Reminder light doesn’t automatically reset:** Requires manual intervention, which can be inconvenient.

**Comparison to Competitors** When stacked against other refrigerator water filters, like the GE MWF or Samsung HAF-CIN/EXP, the Frigidaire WF2CB holds its ground well. The GE MWF offers comparable contaminant removal but tends to be pricier, while the Samsung model boasts a slightly longer lifespan but lacks the straightforward installation of the WF2CB. If simplicity and taste are top priorities, the WF2CB edges out competitors. However, those seeking longer filter life might favor other options.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money** Considering the features and performance, the WF2CB represents excellent value. While the upfront cost may seem steep to some, the savings compared to bottled water and other filtration systems quickly add up. Plus, its six-month lifespan or 200-gallon capacity ensures you’re not replacing filters too frequently. That’s a relief for both your wallet and the environment.

In summary, the Frigidaire WF2CB PureSource2 filter may not be perfect, but it excels in areas that matter most—ease of use, water quality, and reliability. It’s an investment in your family’s health that pays off with every refreshing sip.

Unfortunately her mom just passed after a long battle with cancer and she’s having a rough time - I think she just needs a little spot of brightness and to be around people who loved her mom. (No dad in the picture and she’s an only child.) she’s never been to dc before and we haven’t been around her a ton. 

She’s also coming for a week at spring break where we will do the touristy things. This visit she doesn’t want to do the tourist stuff. 

So my question is what would you suggest around town that’s fun and engaging but not touristy? 

On Friday we are going shopping, coffee, nails, and to a wine bar for Valentine’s Day. Saturday maybe Ben’s chili bowl and a movie in the afternoon. I checked Suns but timing won’t work.

1iohpt4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warehouseworkers/comments/1iohpt4/need_advice_drinks_on_forklifts/,Need Advice - Drinks On Forklifts,"Hey guys,

I'm semi-new to the warehouse world as I've been transferred into an assistant position. It has been a learning process and been going well but I need advice on how other warehouses handle something in either policy or ways to work around it.

Our owner is 100% adamant that food and drink is not allowed on our forklifts. There are safety concerns and potential damage to the lifts themselves in a spill. The manager had been allowing the guys to drink water and coffee in any container on the lifts for years but our owner finally gave the absolute, this changes now.

Our team is pretty irritated and upset about this. We are in Texas so during the Texas heat, they go through alot of water to stay hydrated. We want to meet safety and health guidelines (we store packaging for some food products) yet want to help the team. 

One of the team members mentioned at his last job, they were able to drink water only on the forklifts as long as it was in a specific type of container with a closed lid that was spill proof. It was not provided by the company but it was stated that if you wanted water while on the floor, that was the only container type allowed.

Could I get some assistance or advice on how to deal with this situation? We could easily say no, its policy and it is what it is yet we want to help our team feel valued and are somewhat worried about the summer months when its 100+ outside. I also need to somehow convince the owners that we should do this as we don't want to get chewed out for disobeying his policy. I'm thinking if there is something in OSHA or general worker policy?

1iohpc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1iohpc2/formatting_your_resume_how_do_you_do_yours_and/,Formatting your resume - how do you do yours ? And  other strategy tips,"Hi everyone 
This week I’ve reviewed about 70 resumes or so and wanted to pass on my suggestions for your resume from a GenX minivan dad and engineering leader 

1. No addresses - because you’re willing to move anywhere avoid location bias. 

2. School first if new grads , skills first if you’ve got experience - right away post this and make sure if the job requires Java that’s the first thing in your skills/resume 

3. Post your GPA , courses taken and awards - a lot of you absolutely crushed college. Highlight that .  If you busted your ass but GPA is less than 3 just leave off your GPA. C’s get degrees , degrees get you interviews. 

4 . Use the format of doing X solution to Y problem with Z outcome - use this format to explain what you do and why you did it and how it worked. USE METRICS OR GUESSTIMATE for outcomes. 

5. Bullets and descriptive phrases appropriate for
The role you’re applying for - a resume  is a sales description of why we should hire you.  That’s it. You’re likely an awesome person but I need a specific set of skills. Think of it like a sales pitch for a car - in northern Vermont USA where it snows and I want to ski , I know I need an all wheel drive car with active vectoring  and a manual transmission along with snow tires. If you’ve got a locking differential , AWD, stick and snow tires let’s go. 

6. Expand your location when you’re first applying  - it sucks. You love the Mets and don’t want to leave NYC to go to LA but there is a job there and you don’t have a mortgage , kids , dog , or spouse at the moment. Psssst - there are lots of Mets fans in LA. You can always come back . You may not get the role there. But apply. 

Other tips in your survival guide 

7. Use a fixed amount of time per day to apply - start your day off with some exercise then apply to jobs for
An hour. Don’t try to do it all day. Even if you’re unemployed. Using new roles that have just popped up filter because you’ve already applied to all the old roles out there , Scan the jobs and save them . then knock out the quick apply roles , then do the longer apply positions. 

Then walk away from your computer or close out LinkedIn at least. And don’t read the though pieces on that platform for the love of god make sure when you apply you don’t automatically follow a company or their drivel. Nothing sucks more than to see someone get the role you wanted posted on a company’s site. 

8. Networking via text , phone call , coffee , bike ride , whatever your goal is to pursue advice on getting a role - you’re looking for anyone to help with advice on getting into a new gig , market , industry , work in computer science. Your goal is to get to a hiring manager to see what tools they use to solve problems and to genuinely learn as much as you can.  

Your goal is to listen as much as possible. 

And you have to do it everyday. Because once it becomes something you do a few times you’re going to get way more comfortable doing it and confident in your delivery.  And you’re going to hear a ton of NOs but you will become better at . You’re a salesperson for yourself. 

9. When looking put the bat signal out to your non work friend and family  group - let everyone know outside of work and simply keep it away from coworkers , even friends. This doesn’t mean changing your self on LinkedIn. It means leveraging a network effect of people that you want to move on. 

10. “ Cracking the coding interview “book is worth the $20 to own it.  Read it all.  She does an absolutely great job and you can pass it on to someone else when you score a job. 

11. Give first….. And don’t expect anything at all in return. If you’re in a position to help others , give first. 

12 you have to eat so if you’ve got to take a part time or a less than desirable job , DO IT.  No one interesting has had a linear path without obstacles. This is your story and just a bump in a very long road. It’s humbling and sucks but you need money.  

13 if you get laid off or let go file for unemployment insurance - it’s insurance. You paid for it. Getting laid off can feel like a car crash. Use the insurance to help yourself out.

1iohjb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromPassengers/comments/1iohjb8/stop_expecting_cheap_bus_services_to_be_luxury/,Stop expecting cheap bus services to be luxury transportation,"The description for this subreddit mentioned airplanes, so I hope I'm in the right one, because it never specifically, at least nothing I read, said that you can't talk about buses too. 

I'm a lower class guy, and I'm blind, so I often take buses to get around. I don't just mean local public transit, I mean services like greyhound, miller, barons, etc. I'm also quite easy going. I'm a really no frills kind of guy, and maybe I take this to an abnormal extent, but it bugs the absolute crap out of me to see all of these awful reviews from people who obviously don't take the bus very often. 

They seem to expect the bus to be just like the airport. No, there is not a comfortable lounge with TVs on the wall, free coffee, etc at every bus stop. Some bus stops are terminals with all of these things, but others are at gas stations or fast food restaurants. This means that you are dropped off outside and left fend for yourself, because you, as an adult, I'll responsible for yourself. 

So many of these reviews say things like quote there wasn't even a terminal. I didn't know where to find it. Turns out, it's at a gas station. "" They also include things like quote it said free wi-fi, but I didn't see free Wi-Fi until the bus arrived. Quote this is true at bus stops. The free Wi-Fi is on the bus. At terminals, you can also get it in the terminal, but if you want airline comfort, pay airline prices. Also, terminals are not open 24 hours a day 7 days a week. They open a certain amount of time before a bus arrives, and they close soon after the bus leaves. This means that there is not an attendant available 24 hours a day 7 days a week. Again, you, as an adult, are expected to be responsible for yourself. 

10 to 15 years ago, a huge hole was kicked in this idea by people who agreed to these terms but did not follow them. They were dropped at a bus stop in Iowa and expected to wait overnight for another bus. They knew this in advance. They purchased tickets knowing what time they would be dropped off and picked up. I have experience with greyhound, so I know that they were told that this stop was not a full-blown terminal. That having been said, the temperature dropped down to about 10° f and these people had to stand out in it without any shelter. This is not Greyhound's problem. It would be if the company promised a comfortable lounge with vending machines, free coffee, clean restrooms, multiple televisions with different news stations, etc, but they didn't. They said, effectively, "" will drop you off at this location, and we'll have someone else come to pick you up at the same location this amount of time later. Quote people couldn't handle this. They agreed to the terms, got dropped off, froze their asses off, and sued. 

This incident was also published in news media, so the aftermath resulted in Greyhound not sending people to locations overnight. I live in southwestern indiana. It's a city called evansville. To go to a city about 4 hours to my northwest, I have to go south to nashville, North to indianapolis, then West to springfield. I could go northeast to indianapolis, then the next morning, go to springfield, but Greyhound will not recommend that ticket for me. I would literally have to buy two tickets. This is because Greyhound won't put you somewhere overnight. They will send you on an overnight journey all over the United states, because the trip that involves going first to nashville, then Indy starts at 5:50 p.m. as long as they have me on a bus, Greyhound feels comfortable that I won't Sue them. This is because of people not being adults. 

Back to my complaints about people who don't normally take buses though. One other problem you will face is the fact that you are sitting around lower class people. Most of us don't have a problem with this, but some of you do, and you'll post bad reviews, because you had to sit next to someone who looked or smelled homeless. Maybe you heard a lot of conversations about criminal activity. I don't know, but yes, cheap transportation attracts people with less money. Who'd of thunk it? If you don't want to be near lower class people fork over the dough for luxury transportation.",1,1739448137.0,TalesFromPassengers,0,1.0,False

My mom passed away late August 2013. 


I dont know what to write. 


My son rolled off our couch today and hit his head on the coffee table. Big gash, lots of blood. I ran down to our living room, scooped him up while yelling for my husband. My husband was panicking and can't think when he does. I had to leave my baby and grab a cloth to apply pressure. My husband kept fretting about the fucking blood on the couch. I know he was panicking but he was driving me into lunacy, I swear. Your son has a head wound and you're focusing on the couch??

While we sat in the er he kept telling me not to allow our son to sleep. That's what his mom told him. No. Nope thats not what I read. Not what the triage nurse said. 
Our son was NICU baby. I know how to research and read the proper medical resources to educate myself. 
His mother bases her knowledge on babies solely on her stint as a daycare worker 40 years ago. I grew up in a house of nurses and MDs. My mom was a NICU nurse. 

I often wonder if she (my mom) is protecting my babies. I feel her sometimes. She often visits my more lucid dreams. I smelt my nanny (maternal grandmother) the other day and it made me so sad. I miss my whole family. When my mom died, that side kind of stopped communicating. Until my grandparents died and the estate was distributed. Now that that's done, my only aunt has blocked us all. And tbf, she was mad at my cousin who got a bigger share of the inheritance. She was very mean to him. He got a bigger share because part of it was from a trust his father had. His father died when he was 3.

Sorry. I just kind of dumped a lot out.

Are you planning your next RV adventure and prioritizing safe, clean drinking water? You’re not alone! For RVers, a reliable source of fresh water is essential for everything from drinking and cooking to showering and cleaning. But let's face it, campground water sources can be unpredictable, and that’s where a high-quality **camper in line water filter** comes in.In this thorough guide, we'll dive deep into the world of **RV inline water filters** and explore the **5 best** options slated for 2025. We’ll cover everything from reviews and comparisons to essential buying considerations, ensuring you choose the perfect filter for your specific needs. Get ready to say goodbye to unpleasant tastes, odors, and harmful contaminants, and hello to worry-free hydration on the open road!

[[Explore Top Rated camper in line water filter on Amazon.]](https://yun.yeahads.com/personal-water-filter/?kw=camper in line water filter)
## Why You Need an RV Inline Water Filter

Before we jump into the reviews, let's discuss why a **portable water filter for camping** is a must-have for any RVer.

*   **Safety First:** Campground water sources, while generally potable, can contain bacteria, viruses, sediment, chlorine, and other contaminants that can affect your health. An **inline water filter rv drinking water** system provides an extra layer of protection, giving you peace of mind knowing you're consuming safe and purified water.

*   **Improved Taste and Odor:** No one wants water that tastes like chlorine or smells like sulfur. An **RV inline water filter** effectively removes these unpleasant elements, making your water more palatable and enjoyable.

*   **Protection for Your RV Plumbing:** Sediment and mineral buildup can wreak havoc on your RV’s plumbing system, leading to costly repairs. A **fresh water filter for camper trailer** helps prevent this by filtering out these particles before they enter your water lines.

*   **Extended Appliance Lifespan:** Clean water is crucial for the longevity of your RV's appliances such as your water heater, washing machine (if applicable), and even your coffee maker. an **rv water filter system** ensures that these appliances receive water that's free from damaging sediment and minerals.

*   **Boondocking Benefits**: If you enjoy boondocking or camping off-grid, you may be relying on natural water sources. While a **camping water filter review** might show a specific product isn't enough to render all natural water drinkable on its own, using an inline filter to pre-filter water trucked from an offsite source will remove any sediment brought along for the ride.

## What to Look for in an Inline Water Filter

Choosing the **best rv water filter** can seem overwhelming with so many options available. Here’s a breakdown of the key factors to consider:

*   **Filtration capabilities:** Different filters offer different levels of filtration. Look for filters that remove common contaminants like chlorine, sediment, lead, and bacteria. Consider filters with multi-stage filtration for optimal results. To ensure they fit your needs, compare the RV water filter parts involved. For example, if you are concerned with only sediment, a simple sediment filter rv might be appropriate. Likewise, if you want to remove certain chemicals, a carbon filter rv may be more suited.
*   **Filter Lifespan:** The **rv water filter lifespan** varies depending on the model and the quality of the water you're filtering. Check the manufacturer's recommendations for filter replacement intervals.
*   **Flow Rate:** The **rv water filter flow rate** determines how quickly water flows through the filter. A higher flow rate means faster filling of your water tank and better water pressure. Make sure the flow rate is adequate for your needs.
*   **Ease of Installation:** An **rv water filter installation** should be straightforward and hassle-free. Look for filters that are easy to install and replace, even for those with limited plumbing experience. Consider filters with flexible hose protectors for added convenience during installation.
*   **Durability:** RV life can be tough on equipment. Choose a filter made from high-quality, durable materials that can withstand the rigors of travel and outdoor conditions. Check certifications like passed burst pressure tests.
*   **Certifications:** Look for filters that are certified by reputable organizations like NSF International. Certifications guarantee that the filter meets industry standards for safety and performance.
*   **Size and Weight:** Space is precious in an RV. Choose a relatively compact and lightweight filter that won't take up to much space.
*   **Price:** Inline water filters range in price. Set a budget and compare filters within your price range, considering both the initial cost and the cost of replacement filters.
*    **Lead Free**: Lead contamination is a serious health hazard. A **lead free rv water filter** ensures your drinking water is safe from this harmful metal.

## Understanding Common Water Contaminants and RV Water Filter Types

To make an informed buying decision, it's helpful to understand the common contaminants found in water sources and the types of filters designed to remove them:

*   **Sediment:** sand, silt, rust, and other particulate matter. Removed by sediment filters.
*   **Chlorine:** Used to disinfect water, but can cause unpleasant taste and odor. Removed by carbon filters.
*   **Chloramines:** another type of disinfectant, frequently enough more challenging to remove than chlorine.Requires specialized carbon filters.
*   **Lead:** A toxic metal that can leach into water from old pipes. Removed by lead-specific filters, often certified NSF/ANSI 53.
*   **Bacteria and Viruses:** Microorganisms that can cause illness. Removed by filters with very fine pore sizes (e.g., 0.5 microns or less) or UV disinfection systems.
*   **Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs):** Chemicals from industrial processes, pesticides, and other sources. Removed by activated carbon filters.
*   **Heavy Metals:** Other potentially harmful metals like mercury and arsenic. Removed by specialized filters or reverse osmosis systems.

Common RV water filter types include:

*   **Sediment Filters:** Primarily remove sediment and particulate matter.*   **Carbon Filters:** remove chlorine, chloramines, VOCs, and improve taste and odor.
*   **Combination Filters:** Combine sediment and carbon filtration in a single unit.
*   **Reverse Osmosis (RO) Systems:** Provide the highest level of filtration, removing a wide range of contaminants, including dissolved solids. However, RO systems are typically more complex and expensive.

## Addressing Common Concerns

Let's address a few frequently asked questions about RV inline water filters:

*   **Are inline filters sufficient for all water sources?**

    Inline filters are effective for improving the taste, odor, and safety of most campground water sources. However, for highly contaminated or questionable water sources, you may need a more robust filtration system, such as a multi-stage filtration system or a reverse osmosis system.

*   **How frequently enough should I replace my filter?**

    The replacement frequency depends on the filter type, the amount of water you use, and the quality of the water source. Follow the manufacturer's recommendations for filter replacement. As a general rule, replace your filter at least once per camping season, or more frequently if you notice a decrease in water pressure or a change in taste or odor.
*   **how do I know if my filter is working properly?**

    The best way to ensure your filter is working properly is to test your water regularly. You can purchase a water testing kit or send a sample to a certified laboratory.
*   **Can I use an inline filter with well water?**

    Yes, you can use an inline filter with well water, but you may need a pre-filter to remove sediment and other particulate matter. Well water can also contain higher levels of iron, manganese, and other minerals that may require specialized filtration.
*    **What if I have RV water filter parts and need to order more**: You can consult your manufacturer's website,and follow the instructions found there.

I (25M) recently hooked up with a guy I met on Grindr twice. Both times, we ended up having long conversations, and I started feeling attached to him. However, he told me that he doesn’t attach, which hurt my feelings a bit. The confusing part is that despite saying that, he’s been romantic the whole time—hugging, kissing, and even suggesting things that feel very date-like.

For example, he asked if we should travel together or get coffee, and he’s the one who proposed that we have dinner or watch a movie before I go back to work. It really feels like there’s more to this than just a casual hookup, but I don’t know if I’m just reading too much into it.

There were a few things he said that made me question where he stands:

 • He told me not to be lovestruck. Does this mean he knows that I’m into him?

 • He asked if I was attached, and I hesitated to answer because I was afraid of being rejected like I was by a previous hookup. When I finally admitted I was single, he joked, saying, “I don’t take second answers as an answer.”

 • He mentioned that he doesn’t mind LDR, which gave me a little hope that maybe he does think about relationships.

 • He also said something like, “I see you’re always online on Grindr, it’s okay for you to find other guys because that’s your choice.” The thing is, I was only online because I was waiting for him. I ignored all other chats and only replied to him.

 • He made a self-deprecating joke about his size, saying, “Cute person like you must have many tops queuing. Most bottoms like big penis, and mine is small. That’s my insecurity.” I reassured him that I like him and that he shouldn’t feel insecure, but it made me wonder—does he actually have feelings but just doesn’t want to show it?

Before I went home last time, we had a long hug and kiss, and I really enjoyed it. I hope he felt the same, but I don’t know for sure. I think I’m really falling in love with him.

One funny thing is that despite all these moments, we still don’t know each other’s names. He told me that if I want to know about his life, it has to be a two-way thing. The truth is, I’ve been holding back because I’m still in the closet, and I don’t open up about my personal life easily. But I’m actually ready to tell him more about myself if we go on a third date because I genuinely want to get to know him more.

I’m struggling with whether I should talk to him about my feelings or just wait and see where things go. The last time I confessed to someone, I got rejected immediately, so I don’t want to go through that again. But at the same time, I know I’m getting too attached, and if he truly doesn’t want something more, I don’t want to keep setting myself up for heartbreak.

For those who’ve been in a similar situation, what should I do? Should I subtly bring it up on our next date, or just enjoy the moment and not expect anything?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

TL;DR: Hooked up with a guy twice—he says he doesn’t attach but acts super romantic (suggesting dates, LDR, etc.). We don’t know each other’s names yet, but I’m ready to open up on our third date. He sends mixed signals, and I think I’m falling for him. Should I talk about my feelings or just go with the flow?",3,1739446967.0,askgaybros,4,1.0,False

I'm peeved about some people's behavior, but I do think elements of this post could be put in the highlights or sticky posts to educate people who are new to greyhound. It is a lower cost bus service, so you will not have luxury lounges with tvs, free coffee, etc like you do at the airport. If you want that kind of service, please pay for an airline ticket. 

Some of you are likely more used to amtrak, and Amtrak is pretty good at being cheap and not awful. I've heard good things about it, but when someone who doesn't usually ride a bus rides a bus, we all know about it, because they post the worst reviews they possibly can. 

Please keep in mind that not every location listed is a full-blown terminal. A terminal is a building with heating and cooling as well as bathrooms. Not every terminal is open 24 hours a day 7 days a week. Sometimes, they only open when a bus is scheduled to arrive, so you won't be able to enter the building 2 hours before your bus arrives and talk to someone behind a counter. You will have to manage your own affairs.. 

things have changed in the past few years, because there was a huge media circus over an event that took place in Iowa 10 to 15 years ago. A bunch of people were left at a bus stop and the temperature dropped to about 10°. If you read Greyhound's website, it explains which locations have terminals and which ones do not. This location had a gas station and possibly a fast food restaurant, but both were closed. A group of maybe 10 or 11 passengers had to wait for another bus in these cold temperatures, and this started a massive argument online. People were saying that Greyhound was responsible for providing things such as bathrooms, heating and air conditioning, and indoor place for people to wait, comfortable seating, etc. 

If they promise it, yes, they owe it to you, but they didn't. It is clearly stated which stops are full terminals and which ones are not. This led to another situation where people can agree to terms, sign a contract, but still go back on it. Now, you'll notice that your Greyhound tickets are more expensive. Why? It's because Greyhound will not put you anywhere overnight. 

I live in Evansville indiana. It is a small City in the southwestern corner of the state, and the best example I can give you is a trip I plan to take to Springfield Illinois in August of this year. Springfield is Northwest of me, and to drive there would take about 4 hours. I'm blind, so driving is out of the question. I've looked up tickets far in advance, and what I see include the option of going directly south to nashville, then North to indianapolis, then West to springfield. This would be overnight. They also include going east to Louisville kentucky, south to nashville, North to St louis, and Northeast to springfield. The reason why I have to go in circles is because Greyhound will not simply send me to Indianapolis, because I would be there overnight. They don't know that I have friends in Indy and that I can stay there. This is because of the outrage created by the incident in Iowa and all of the awful reviews people give not realizing they're dealing with a low-cost transportation provider. 

Reviews from people who usually don't take buses include complaints about the terminal not being open, the fact that the terminal isn't even there and they meet the bus at a gas station or restaurant, the fact that the free Wi-Fi doesn't appear on their list of networks until the bus arrives, the fact that there is not an attendant available 24 hours a day 7 days a week, and several others. It also includes the fact that passengers have to ride with lower class people. Yes, you have to ride with lower class people. In fact, Greyhound buses often stop and locations where prisoners are dropped off after being released. If you don't like this, you are welcome to pay more money and fly. You can fly on a luxury airliner or take a limousine, so that you are shielded from the lower class. Aside from that, yes, you will be surrounded by people who might not be well kept. They might seem like, and actually be, criminals. Just remember, Greyhound is responsible for keeping you safe while you're on their buses. They will take measures to try to keep truly bad things from happening to you, but they won't protect you from sitting next to somebody who is unkempt, smelly, uneducated, lower class, etc. 

Complaints and lawsuits like this take away cheaper options for people who don't have lots of money. Understandably, there are people who will have real problems if they can't wait inside a heated and cooled terminal with clean bathrooms. That having been said, there are many people who are perfectly fine traveling to a gas station and waiting for a bus. There are many people who will understand what it means to be outside waiting for a bus and will prepare for the weather. These people are willing to do these things in order to save money, and they should be allowed to do them. Cheap services should be available for people who are willing to make sacrifices, but all of that gets messed up by people who click agree to all terms, then proceed to not agree to all terms. This is why Greyhound has to charge more and give you longer routes that involve writing the opposite direction before you go the direction you're trying to go.",1,1739446421.0,GreyhoundBus,0,1.0,False

Hi everyone!

I hope this type of post is ok for this platform. 

I am currently at an impasse and would appreciate any advice/input on my fork in the road. I am drawn to start my own business. I have worked in the pharmaceutical industry for 9 years, and worked myself up to a middle management role. The salary was ok, but the role was incredibly unfulfilling. I was working very hard, and getting no satisfaction. I decided to leave the role at the end of January, and am now studying a graduate cert in innovation and leadership. I have two business ideas:
- Leadership and employee motivation consultant. I am a strong people leader, this is where I have always excelled, and have received consistent positive feedback from senior leaders (up to C-suite) on my interpersonal and presentation skills. I have always been able to build motivated and engaged teams. I’m a people person. So am therefore interested in starting a small business in leadership and employee motivation consulting. I have applied for a MA in Applied Positive and Coaching psychology, starting in September 2025 if I choose to take this business route. 
- Cinnamon bun small business. I would initially build a brand, start small at markets etc. to get the name out. I would offer corporate and private events, and mail delivery. I would then scale to kiosks in shops or shopping centres (eg. franchise to coffee shops). I would then look to sell pre-made or frozen dough in supermarkets once a name has been established for the brand. There are no brands/companies that sell cinnamon buns or pre-made dough in my country. So although baked goods are saturated, cinnamon buns have not made their way over here yet. 

I would love to hear any feedback on these two possible avenues. I know there will be significant pros and cons to both. I am not looking to be a millionaire, just fulfilled, and without the regret in 30 years that I never scratched my entrepreneurial itch.

1iogxhp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nicotine/comments/1iogxhp/nicotine_pouches_vs_traditional_tobacco_which_is/,Nicotine Pouches vs Traditional Tobacco: Which is Better?,"In recent years, the tobacco landscape has evolved significantly, with new products emerging to cater to the changing preferences of consumers. Among these innovations, **nicotine pouches** have gained popularity as a smoke-free alternative to **traditional tobacco** products. In this blog, we will explore the differences between **nicotine pouches** and **traditional tobacco**, and help you determine which option might be better for you. We will also highlight some of the leading [nicotine pouches manufacturers in India](https://www.gozvol.com/nicotine-pouches-manufactures-in-india).

# Understanding Nicotine Pouches

[Nicotine pouches](https://www.gozvol.com/nicotine-pouches-manufactures-in-india) are small, discreet pouches that contain nicotine, flavorings, and other ingredients, but no tobacco leaf. They are designed to be placed between the gum and lip, allowing nicotine to be absorbed through the oral mucosa. This method of consumption offers a smoke-free experience, making it an appealing option for those looking to reduce their tobacco intake or quit smoking altogether.

# Benefits of Nicotine Pouches

1. **Reduced Health Risks**: Unlike **traditional tobacco** products, [nicotine pouches](https://www.gozvol.com/nicotine-pouches-manufactures-in-india) do not involve combustion, which means they do not produce harmful tar and other toxic substances associated with smoking. This can lead to a lower risk of respiratory issues and other health problems.
2. **Variety of Flavors**: **Nicotine pouches** come in a wide range of flavors, from mint and fruit to coffee and spices. This variety can make the experience more enjoyable for users, especially those who find **traditional tobacco** flavors unappealing.
3. **Discreet Usage**: The small size and odorless nature of **nicotine pouches** make them easy to use in various settings without drawing attention. This can be particularly advantageous for users in social situations or workplaces where smoking is prohibited.

# Traditional Tobacco: A Closer Look

**Traditional tobacco** products include cigarettes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco like chewing tobacco and snuff. These products have been around for centuries and are deeply ingrained in many cultures. However, they come with significant health risks.

# Drawbacks of Traditional Tobacco

1. **Health Risks**: Smoking **traditional tobacco** is linked to numerous health issues, including lung cancer, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The combustion process releases harmful chemicals that can have devastating effects on the body.
2. **Addiction**: **Traditional tobacco** products are highly addictive due to their nicotine content. Many users find it challenging to quit, leading to long-term health consequences.
3. **Social Stigma**: As awareness of the dangers of smoking has increased, **traditional tobacco** products have faced growing social stigma. Many public places have implemented strict regulations against smoking, making it less socially acceptable.

# Nicotine Pouches Manufacturers in India

As the demand for **nicotine pouches** grows, several manufacturers in India are stepping up to meet consumer needs. Here are some notable [nicotine pouches manufacturers in India](https://www.gozvol.com/nicotine-pouches-manufactures-in-india):

1. **NicoPouch**: Known for its high-quality **nicotine pouches**, NicoPouch offers a variety of flavors and strengths, catering to different preferences. Their products are designed to provide a satisfying experience without the harmful effects of **traditional tobacco**.
2. **Zyn India**: Zyn is a well-known brand in the **nicotine pouch** market, offering a range of flavors and nicotine strengths. Their products are designed for those looking for a smoke-free alternative to **traditional tobacco**.
3. **NicoMint**: This manufacturer focuses on creating refreshing and flavorful **nicotine pouches** that appeal to a wide audience. With a commitment to quality and safety, NicoMint is gaining traction among Indian consumers.

# Conclusion: Which is Better?

When it comes to choosing between **nicotine pouches** and **traditional tobacco**, the decision ultimately depends on individual preferences and health considerations. **Nicotine pouches** offer a smoke-free, potentially less harmful alternative to **traditional tobacco**, making them an attractive option for many users. On the other hand, **traditional tobacco** products come with a long history and cultural significance but pose significant health risks.

As the market for **nicotine pouches** continues to grow, manufacturers in India are stepping up to provide consumers with a variety of options. If you're considering making the switch, exploring the offerings from reputable [nicotine pouches manufacturers in India](https://www.gozvol.com/nicotine-pouches-manufactures-in-india) can help you find a product that suits your needs.

In conclusion, whether you choose **nicotine pouches** or **traditional tobacco**, it's essential to stay informed and make choices that prioritize your health and well-being.",2,1739445755.0,Nicotine,0,1.0,False

I know the broken parts of me will never fit with another human in a deep, meaningful, and sustainable manner.

The inane quotes of bedroom philosophers and top of the bell curve therapists only make me feel worse as I read their words of effortlessness when the right person is found and see in them only the emptiness inside.

I can pick holes through the justification she gave, over all the years, but at the core of it I wasn't wanted. Blamelessly, I should add, how could anyone stay with this?  And even if she doesnt put it as succinctly as that, I can. So why feel anger over what I feel were fabricated reasons? The truth is the truth. She can mend the pieces I broke in the sweat and sheets of another, but in those for me there is only much of the same.

I can decorate the absences of those I've lost however I wish, distractions and rote aspects of living, but they will be felt regardless. I can fall down the hole of various self-destructions, but that is only the slow knife on a wrist. And just more distractions already attempted, no saviors there either.

I need to accept there is no hope for me, but in lieu of it I have what I've always had. A simple pushing in the dark, to keep going in spite of, to keep going in spite of me. Some may argue that man can not live through such alone. But there is no living, only dying at a later point. And spite will be enough, for now.  

So go on, let go of what you once hoped and remember. That there are few happy endings in this world, and none for you in particular. Accept it, let her find her happiness.

As someone who drinks loads of water daily, I needed something reliable to filter out impurities without compromising on taste or convenience. This faucet filter certainly makes bold claims, and I was keen to see if it lived up to expectations.

The first thing that struck me was its easy installation. No tools required, just a few twists to attach it to my kitchen faucet. I remember thinking, “Is that it?”—and yes, that was it. The on/off lever for switching between filtered and unfiltered water is straightforward, which is super convenient when you don’t need filtered water for every task. The white plastic design blends decently with most kitchen setups, though it’s not exactly a design marvel.

What really matters, though, is the water quality. The improvement in taste was noticeable almost immediately. It’s certified to reduce over 70 contaminants, including lead, which is reassuring given the concerns over tap water quality in many areas. I’ve even used the water for making coffee, and I can swear it tastes much better than before. Plus, the built-in filter light indicator is a lifesaver, ensuring I don’t forget to change the filter—though it did take me a couple of tries to figure out what the blinking meant.

[Check PUR PFM150W price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/product-reviews/best-faucet-mount-filter-pur-pfm150w-review-b01lra6vko/)

**Pros**

* **Ease of installation**: No tools needed, and it fits most standard faucets without hassle.
* **Improved water taste**: Filters out chlorine and other unpleasant elements, delivering refreshing water.
* **Cost-effective**: Each filter lasts up to 100 gallons or around three months of regular use.
* **Certified performance**: WQA and NSF certifications give confidence in its ability to reduce harmful substances like lead.
* **Convenient features**: The filter light indicator ensures timely replacements.

**Cons**

* **Leaking issues**: Some users, including myself on one occasion, experienced minor dripping at the attachment point.
* **Build quality**: The predominantly plastic construction feels less durable compared to metal-based alternatives.
* **Drips after use**: Filtered water continues to drip for a while after shutting off, which can be irritating.
* **Compatibility concerns**: Doesn’t fit every faucet type, which might require additional adapters.
* **Internal battery**: The non-replaceable battery for the filter light could be a long-term downside.

**Comparison to Competitors** Compared to similar products like the Brita faucet filter, the PUR PFM150W seems to offer superior filtration capabilities, reducing more contaminants. On the flip side, Brita filters are slightly more compact and less prone to dripping. ZeroWater pitchers, another competitor, excel in filtration precision but lack the convenience of a faucet-mounted system. However, PUR’s filter light and ease of use give it an edge over traditional pitchers.

One downside compared to more premium options is its plastic design. Systems like Culligan FM-25, which features a sturdier metal body, feel more robust but may not filter as many contaminants. Overall, for the price point, the PUR PFM150W delivers a great balance of filtration performance and convenience.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money** This product is undeniably budget-friendly. Replacement filters are reasonably priced, especially when bought in bulk. If you’re someone who buys bottled water regularly, switching to this filtration system could save you a significant amount of money over time. On the flip side, occasional leaks might add to maintenance costs if the faucet mount needs frequent replacing.

Despite its quirks, the PUR PFM150W is a practical choice for anyone looking to improve their home’s water quality without breaking the bank. I’ve found it perfect for daily use, from drinking water to cooking, and even filling up my pet’s water bowl. Just be prepared for a few minor inconveniences, like the drip issue.

If there were ever a name perfectly crafted for a **glarketer**, it would be **Brandon Ewing**. This isn’t just a name—it's a carefully woven narrative of destiny, marketing prowess, and, of course, glizzies.

Marketing is all about capturing attention, amplifying presence, and ensuring that a product lives rent-free in consumers' minds. And who better embodies this than Atrioc, whose real name, **Brandon Ewing**, is the most fitting name for a **glarketer** (glizzy marketer) in history?

First, let’s break it down. **Brandon**—what do marketers do? They turn **Brand(s)** **ON**—flipping the switch in people’s minds to associate products with culture, trends, and purchasing power. Marketers activate brand awareness on the world stage, making them more visible and desirable. And **Brandon**? That’s literally his name. Brand-ON. Say it again. **BRAND-ON**. Coincidence? Absolutely not. This is a case of **Chunginema**—a masterpiece of marketing fate and glizzy-fingered destiny. **ICANT.**

Now, onto **Ewing**. Where did Atrioc work? **Twitch** and **Nvidia**, two titans of the modern **electronic** age. In our 21st-century world, **E** represents **electronic**: the lifeblood of digital marketing. But wait—what about **wing**? Before you start Susge-ing, well.... where do marketers operate? From the sleek, buzzing marketing **wings** of corporate buildings. And what is their mission? To make brands **soar** to the highest levels of consumer consciousness. If you want a brand to take flight, you better have **wings**. **E-Wing.** **Ewing.**

Put these two names together, and you get **Brandon Ewing**—this name was **engineered for the industry**.

And, of course, let’s not forget the most crucial part—Atrioc himself. Glizzies and coffee are the lifeblood of Atrioc’s existence. His **glizzy fingers** (due to their shape and size) and his **coffee cow tendencies** (constant caffeine consumption) reinforce his role as a **brand-driven consumer**. The **glizzy-fingered, coffee-chugging, brand-activating machine**. It only makes sense.

Also, what are **glizzies and coffee** if not **brand**\-driven purchases? Whether bought **ON** a grocery store shelf, a restaurant menu, or an **E**\-commerce platform, they exist purely because of marketing. **POGGIES. ICANT. BMCL Cinema.**

He’s not just a **marketer; he’s the marketer of marketers, the glarketer supreme. Brandon Ewing isn’t just a name—it’s a brand in itself.**

Bonus brownie points for you, if you know where that's from!

To give you due warning, this advert is pretty long. I suggest getting a cup of tea or coffee, and to make yourself comfortable!

So, where to begin? Why don't I begin with some basic introductions! I am a 23 year old roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands, also known as Eastern Europe. To be more specific, I come from Poland, which at the moment situates me in the CET time zone. I have been doing this hobby for about half my life at this point, and while I have only made a switch to English a couple years back, I still consider myself decent! Other than writing, be it solo- or collaborative, I also love tea, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy novels, as well as anything that happens to be furry and walks on four legs!

A very important thing to know about me is that I love a good OOC connection, and on my end, it's pretty much requirement!

Yes, it does mean that I wish to, eventually, befriend my writing partners! It is not just that, though. The thing is that the whole OOC chatter around the story, the fan-girling, discussing the what-ifs, laughing about it, making memes, even mocking tense and sad story moments are what makes half of the fun of the hobby for me! If all of this sounds like grueling nonsense to you, I can say with certainty that the two of us will not work together very well. If what I've said however sounds amazing, then that's great, and we may be able to create some wonderful magic together!

So, that's it as far as introductions! Before I carry on further, I must get a few things out of the way, first!

1. Please be at least 21 years old of age, and older.
2. I require a reply rate of at least **once** per day, and the ability to regularly post more often is appreciated as well as preferred. Real life always comes first, but if you know that what I've just asked for is going to pose a problem, I am really not the right writing partner for you.
3. I write exclusively on Discord. At the moment, I am not interested in trying any alternative sites.
4. I refuse to use face claims of any kind. That said, reference images for objects, buildings, weapons and monsters are something I am much more agreeable to!
5. At the moment of writing this advert, I will absolutely **not** write with cisgender men.
6. As much as I feel bad to say this, I'm not comfortable with writing with someone new to this hobby. I'm sorry!
7. Explicit content, the way the term is typically understood, is unlikely. I much prefer fade-to-black. If you message me from a dedicated NFSW account, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Okay, that would be all! Now, why don't I actually move to my preferences so far as the actual roleplay is concerned?

So, the most important thing about me about a roleplayer is that I always, in a manner of speaking, come empty-handed. Why? That's simple! I want to come up with everything within the story, be it the plot, the characters, the lore, the entire world they're in, and pretty much everything else **together** with my writing partner! The main exception to that rule are mainly monsters and some other fantastical creatures, that I may, or may not outright steal from mythology, video games, DnD or other sorts of fiction! This isn't a perfect approach, and definitely not an approach that would work for everyone. Still, I do not believe in perfect, and that is what works for me!

Which also means that, no, I will not be very interested if you already have an intricate plot or world of your own. If you do, I wish you the absolute best with it, but that's just not what I am looking for!

Now, I have mentioned that I want to write a story in an urban fantasy... but what *is* urban fantasy to me?

Simple! By that I mean a world, where the existence of magic, and any possible fantastical elements, is not something hidden from the 'muggles', where it isn't considered inherently separate from technology, and instead, for both to often be combined, as well as intertwined together! Pretty much, what I want could be summed up with this sentence: imagine your traditional medieval fantasy world, and then imagine it's gone through an industrial revolution. Now, *how* advanced our possible world is, that is very much up to discussion! As long as it's at least reached the steam engine, I am more than happy to brainstorm and discuss!

I should mention that at least at the moment, I *really* do not want to write a medieval fantasy.

That said, I still tend to utilize a great deal of storytelling tropes and plot devices you would see in a medieval fantasy story. I just often put a more modern spin on them! My ideal story would still feature a ragtag group of companions that travel together from to town, while braving through dungeons, undergoing quests, interacting with a whole ensemble cast, facing many dangerous antagonists, while a greater, terrifying threat looms from over the horizon! Just like in many medieval fantasy epics. The thing is, I just want all that to happen in a world that has working trains, electricity, cars, supermarkets, and quite possibly social media! The actual tone and dominant themes are something that I would like to discuss together, but over-all, I just love epic fantasy with major stakes!

(Though, at the moment, I will not consider military and/or police settings as the main backdrop for the story!)

A thing I may want devote yet another paragraph on is action. I absolutely love action, and it's pretty much a requirement that my writing partners feel the same! That said, my approach to it is neither realistic nor grounded. To put it like this... while most of my characters wouldn't be any more than just cannon fodder in the very overpowered universes (like the Invincible or Dragon Ball), they would still be considered OP by the standards of grounded, realistic settings. Things such as swordsmen cutting through modern armed soldiers by the dozens, dodging and parrying of actual bullets, and characters that fight on in spite of grievous injuries are all par of the course! So, before you consider reaching, make sure that what I've just said is up your alley!

Now, as for the characters! I have already mentioned my love for ensemble casts, and for this reason, the ability to create characters that differ by age\*, gender, romantic orientation, social background, moral alignment, and more, is absolutely essential! Is it a tall order? Perhaps, but I promise the same on my end! When it comes to my lead character in particular, we'll see. The only thing that's certain is that she'll be a woman, which I also require for your own character. I also, generally speaking, prefer to write characters from their late 20s to their mid 30s. While playing young adults isn't necessarily off the table, I cannot promise I can be convinced to go down that road!

\*That said, most of the cast should be at least 21+ of age, if not 25+ outright.

As for romance, while I have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, I still prefer writing partners willing and able to write all three basic gender combinations. By that I mean, obviously, FxM, MxM, and of course, FxF! Why? That's simple! I love variety, and I don't find it particularly realistic, nor immersive, when it's just a single kind of pairing over and over!

That said, while I do not outright require that our lead characters have to be romantically involved, I really am not the partner for you if you dislike writing romance in general.

I would also like to list some things that I do not want in my roleplays:

Fandoms, overt/excessive fluff/grimdark, sanitized/whitewashed depictions of groups widely known to be immoral/violent/corrupt, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers (for the main pair), slice-of-life (as the main plot), werewolf and vampire plots, standard fantasy races, isekai, romance as the main plot, toxic masculine characters, comedy as the main genre, settings based off the real world (like in Marvel, HP or Percy Jackson), arranged marriage, school settings, protagonists of the evil moral alignment

Do not hesitate to ask, if you would like some elaboration on any one of these!

In truth, there's very, *very* few storytelling tropes and conventions that I refuse to make use of no matter what. Such as, I do not dislike either vampires, or were-creatures. I do, however, dislike settings where vampires and werewolves are the *only* fantastical elements, much less the only fantastical creatures, or if there's little of those besides them. Now that said, the ones listed above are what I *usually* dislike in fiction, and I figured the list may be useful to save at least some of you some time!

Now, while I **do not** write in fandoms anymore, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Examples would include:

Final Fantasy series (in particular VI, VII, X and XV), Fullmetal Alchemist (this is a big one!). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Avatar: The Last Airbender (as well as Legend of Korra!), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series, and Monster (the odd one out here!),

The list is in a *somewhat* descending order of importance. Of course, this isn't by any means the full extent of the fiction that I like! Absolutely not! I have, however, noticed that those are the pieces of fiction I am most likely to draw inspiration from, either on purpose, or subconsciously! If you like more than three positions on the list, then I feel there's good chance that we may vibe together quite well! However, I should say that while it is just my very limited personal experience, it's never worked out for me with anyone who was completely unfamiliar with any of the fandoms listed above. Especially when it comes to the first half of the list. So, if that's the case with you, approach at your own peril!

So! In regards to my storytelling preferences, I feel all that this should about suffice!

As for the *actual* writing, allow me to put it this way: I definitely like to have a decent amount of meat around the bone. Still, neither I do not believe in word quotas, nor do I believe in padding to fill said quotas. I don't really believe in labels all that much either, but if I must use one, then it'd be **advanced literate**. Typically, my replies tend to average between 400 and 800 words (don't ask me how much is it in paragraphs, I don't speak paragraph), but depending on the scene's need and scale, they can get longer. A lot longer. As for the more beautiful, flowery sort of language, I believe it is a lot like salt when used in cooking. Absolutely amazing in moderation, but not so much if you dump a whole kilogram into the pot! Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I expect the same of my partners, too.

I will happily provide a writing sample upon request in direct messages!

So, this should probably it!

This whole advert is a looot longer than it could have been, so kudos to you, if you've actually read the whole thing!

On the flip side, if you only skimmed through it, I recommend that you go back and read it in full anyway. This whole thing is long as #@%\^&!, but it is such for a reason, as a lot of the things I've talked about are potential deal-breakers and compatibility issues. At the end of the day, would you rather waste ten minutes of your time, or a whole week, if not more? Do take your pick!

Now, when you message me, please remember it is not a race! While I don't expect a college-grade essay by any means, I do like when someone's opening message gives me a good idea of who am I talking to. What I do want to know is how may I call you, what is your age, your pronouns, your timezone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable sharing!), any potential story triggers (or just tropes you really, REALLY prefer to avoid!) and most importantly of all, a starting pitch for a story! This advert doesn't provide anything concrete in terms of ideas, so don't worry, I am not asking that of you, either! All I really want is a starting point for us to start plotting! You may as well tell me about a particular storytelling trope that you enjoy, or a character dynamic you've been wanting to explore for a while! I should also mention that while I will want to move to Discord eventually, I do typically prefer to stay here, before actually moving on. Oh, and it doesn't really matter whether you use Reddit Chat or Reddit PMs! Either channel works just as fine!

Sooo... this is everything!

Okay, that would be all! Now, why don't I actually move to my preferences so far as the actual roleplay is concerned?

So, the most important thing about me about a roleplayer is that I always, in a manner of speaking, come empty-handed. Why? That's simple! I want to come up with everything within the story, be it the plot, the characters, the lore, the entire world they're in, and pretty much everything else **together** with my writing partner! The main exception to that rule are mainly monsters and some other fantastical creatures, that I may, or may not outright steal from mythology, video games, DnD or other sorts of fiction! This isn't a perfect approach, and definitely not an approach that would work for everyone. Still, I do not believe in perfect, and that is what works for me!

Which also means that, no, I will not be very interested if you already have an intricate plot or world of your own. If you do, I wish you the absolute best with it, but that's just not what I am looking for!

Now, I have mentioned that I want to write a story in an urban fantasy... but what *is* urban fantasy to me?

Simple! By that I mean a world, where the existence of magic, and any possible fantastical elements, is not something hidden from the 'muggles', where it isn't considered inherently separate from technology, and instead, for both to often be combined, as well as intertwined together! Pretty much, what I want could be summed up with this sentence: imagine your traditional medieval fantasy world, and then imagine it's gone through an industrial revolution. Now, *how* advanced our possible world is, that is very much up to discussion! As long as it's at least reached the steam engine, I am more than happy to brainstorm and discuss!

I should mention that at least at the moment, I *really* do not want to write a medieval fantasy.

That said, I still tend to utilize a great deal of storytelling tropes and plot devices you would see in a medieval fantasy story. I just often put a more modern spin on them! My ideal story would still feature a ragtag group of companions that travel together from to town, while braving through dungeons, undergoing quests, interacting with a whole ensemble cast, facing many dangerous antagonists, while a greater, terrifying threat looms from over the horizon! Just like in many medieval fantasy epics. The thing is, I just want all that to happen in a world that has working trains, electricity, cars, supermarkets, and quite possibly social media! The actual tone and dominant themes are something that I would like to discuss together, but over-all, I just love epic fantasy with major stakes!

(Though, at the moment, I will not consider military and/or police settings as the main backdrop for the story!)

A thing I may want devote yet another paragraph on is action. I absolutely love action, and it's pretty much a requirement that my writing partners feel the same! That said, my approach to it is neither realistic nor grounded. To put it like this... while most of my characters wouldn't be any more than just cannon fodder in the very overpowered universes (like the Invincible or Dragon Ball), they would still be considered OP by the standards of grounded, realistic settings. Things such as swordsmen cutting through modern armed soldiers by the dozens, dodging and parrying of actual bullets, and characters that fight on in spite of grievous injuries are all par of the course! So, before you consider reaching, make sure that what I've just said is up your alley!

Now, as for the characters! I have already mentioned my love for ensemble casts, and for this reason, the ability to create characters that differ by age\*, gender, romantic orientation, social background, moral alignment, and more, is absolutely essential! Is it a tall order? Perhaps, but I promise the same on my end! When it comes to my lead character in particular, we'll see. The only thing that's certain is that she'll be a woman, which I also require for your own character. I also, generally speaking, prefer to write characters from their late 20s to their mid 30s. While playing young adults isn't necessarily off the table, I cannot promise I can be convinced to go down that road!

\*That said, most of the cast should be at least 21+ of age, if not 25+ outright.

As for romance, while I have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, I still prefer writing partners willing and able to write all three basic gender combinations. By that I mean, obviously, FxM, MxM, and of course, FxF! Why? That's simple! I love variety, and I don't find it particularly realistic, nor immersive, when it's just a single kind of pairing over and over!

That said, while I do not outright require that our lead characters have to be romantically involved, I really am not the partner for you if you dislike writing romance in general.

I would also like to list some things that I do not want in my roleplays:

Fandoms, overt/excessive fluff/grimdark, sanitized/whitewashed depictions of groups widely known to be immoral/violent/corrupt, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers (for the main pair), slice-of-life (as the main plot), werewolf and vampire plots, standard fantasy races, isekai, romance as the main plot, toxic masculine characters, comedy as the main genre, settings based off the real world (like in Marvel, HP or Percy Jackson), arranged marriage, school settings, protagonists of the evil moral alignment

Do not hesitate to ask, if you would like some elaboration on any one of these!

In truth, there's very, *very* few storytelling tropes and conventions that I refuse to make use of no matter what. Such as, I do not dislike either vampires, or were-creatures. I do, however, dislike settings where vampires and werewolves are the *only* fantastical elements, much less the only fantastical creatures, or if there's little of those besides them. Now that said, the ones listed above are what I *usually* dislike in fiction, and I figured the list may be useful to save at least some of you some time!

Now, while I **do not** write in fandoms anymore, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Examples would include:

Final Fantasy series (in particular VI, VII, X and XV), Fullmetal Alchemist (this is a big one!). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Avatar: The Last Airbender (as well as Legend of Korra!), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series, and Monster (the odd one out here!),

The list is in a *somewhat* descending order of importance. Of course, this isn't by any means the full extent of the fiction that I like! Absolutely not! I have, however, noticed that those are the pieces of fiction I am most likely to draw inspiration from, either on purpose, or subconsciously! If you like more than three positions on the list, then I feel there's good chance that we may vibe together quite well! However, I should say that while it is just my very limited personal experience, it's never worked out for me with anyone who was completely unfamiliar with any of the fandoms listed above. Especially when it comes to the first half of the list. So, if that's the case with you, approach at your own peril!

So! In regards to my storytelling preferences, I feel all that this should about suffice!

As for the *actual* writing, allow me to put it this way: I definitely like to have a decent amount of meat around the bone. Still, neither I do not believe in word quotas, nor do I believe in padding to fill said quotas. I don't really believe in labels all that much either, but if I must use one, then it'd be **advanced literate**. Typically, my replies tend to average between 400 and 800 words (don't ask me how much is it in paragraphs, I don't speak paragraph), but depending on the scene's need and scale, they can get longer. A lot longer. As for the more beautiful, flowery sort of language, I believe it is a lot like salt when used in cooking. Absolutely amazing in moderation, but not so much if you dump a whole kilogram into the pot! Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I expect the same of my partners, too.

I will happily provide a writing sample upon request in direct messages!

So, this should probably it!

This whole advert is a looot longer than it could have been, so kudos to you, if you've actually read the whole thing!

On the flip side, if you only skimmed through it, I recommend that you go back and read it in full anyway. This whole thing is long as #@%\^&!, but it is such for a reason, as a lot of the things I've talked about are potential deal-breakers and compatibility issues. At the end of the day, would you rather waste ten minutes of your time, or a whole week, if not more? Do take your pick!

Now, when you message me, please remember it is not a race! While I don't expect a college-grade essay by any means, I do like when someone's opening message gives me a good idea of who am I talking to. What I do want to know is how may I call you, what is your age, your pronouns, your timezone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable sharing!), any potential story triggers (or just tropes you really, REALLY prefer to avoid!) and most importantly of all, a starting pitch for a story! This advert doesn't provide anything concrete in terms of ideas, so don't worry, I am not asking that of you, either! All I really want is a starting point for us to start plotting! You may as well tell me about a particular storytelling trope that you enjoy, or a character dynamic you've been wanting to explore for a while! I should also mention that while I will want to move to Discord eventually, I do typically prefer to stay here, before actually moving on. Oh, and it doesn't really matter whether you use Reddit Chat or Reddit PMs! Either channel works just as fine!

Bonus brownie points for you, if you know where that's from!

To give you due warning, this advert is pretty long. I suggest getting a cup of tea or coffee, and to make yourself comfortable!

So, where to begin? Why don't I begin with some basic introductions! I am a 23 year old roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands, also known as Eastern Europe. To be more specific, I come from Poland, which at the moment situates me in the CET time zone. I have been doing this hobby for about half my life at this point, and while I have only made a switch to English a couple years back, I still consider myself decent! Other than writing, be it solo- or collaborative, I also love tea, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy novels, as well as anything that happens to be furry and walks on four legs!

A very important thing to know about me is that I love a good OOC connection, and on my end, it's pretty much requirement!

Yes, it does mean that I wish to, eventually, befriend my writing partners! It is not just that, though. The thing is that the whole OOC chatter around the story, the fan-girling, discussing the what-ifs, laughing about it, making memes, even mocking tense and sad story moments are what makes half of the fun of the hobby for me! If all of this sounds like grueling nonsense to you, I can say with certainty that the two of us will not work together very well. If what I've said however sounds amazing, then that's great, and we may be able to create some wonderful magic together!

So, that's it as far as introductions! Before I carry on further, I must get a few things out of the way, first!

1. Please be at least 21 years old of age, and older.
2. I require a reply rate of at least **once** per day, and the ability to regularly post more often is appreciated as well as preferred. Real life always comes first, but if you know that what I've just asked for is going to pose a problem, I am really not the right writing partner for you.
3. I write exclusively on Discord. At the moment, I am not interested in trying any alternative sites.
4. I refuse to use face claims of any kind. That said, reference images for objects, buildings, weapons and monsters are something I am much more agreeable to!
5. At the moment of writing this advert, I will absolutely **not** write with cisgender men.
6. As much as I feel bad to say this, I'm not comfortable with writing with someone new to this hobby. I'm sorry!
7. Explicit content, the way the term is typically understood, is unlikely. I much prefer fade-to-black. If you message me from a dedicated NFSW account, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Okay, that would be all! Now, why don't I actually move to my preferences so far as the actual roleplay is concerned?

So, the most important thing about me about a roleplayer is that I always, in a manner of speaking, come empty-handed. Why? That's simple! I want to come up with everything within the story, be it the plot, the characters, the lore, the entire world they're in, and pretty much everything else **together** with my writing partner! The main exception to that rule are mainly monsters and some other fantastical creatures, that I may, or may not outright steal from mythology, video games, DnD or other sorts of fiction!

Simple! By that I mean a world, where the existence of magic, and any possible fantastical elements, is not something hidden from the 'muggles', where it isn't considered inherently separate from technology, and instead, for both to often be combined, as well as intertwined together! Pretty much, what I want could be summed up with this sentence: imagine your traditional medieval fantasy world, and then imagine it's gone through an industrial revolution. Now, *how* advanced our possible world is, that is very much up to discussion! As long as it's at least reached the steam engine, I am more than happy to brainstorm and discuss!

1ioglt9,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarketingMentor/comments/1ioglt9/i_am_coach_muhsin_making_digital_marketing_simple/,I Am Coach Muhsin: Making Digital Marketing Simple and Human,"Marketing, at times, becomes overwhelming in this fast-moving digital age. The complexities of online advertising, SEO, content writing, and social media management allude the ability of companies. But why do these tasks necessarily have to be complex? Wha if a company's online presence can also be simplified while being equally powerful? This is what It, [Coach Muhsin,](https://www.coachmuhsin.com/) aims to offer with his experience as a [Digital Marketing Consultant in Kerala.](https://www.coachmuhsin.com/)

The Power of Simplicity in Digital Marketing

Marketing is not about speaking with big words or complicated strategies that only professionals will comprehend. It's about speaking to your people in the purest form of communication. More often than not, companies become lost in jargon and ignore the fact that at the root of digital marketing is communication. My strategy is to make digital marketing strategies accessible so that it can be adopted by anyone ranging from a small business owner to a startup owner.

By demystifying marketing strategies in simple steps, I enable Kerala-based businesses and others to establish effective digital footprints. Whether SEO, social media marketing, content writing, or pay-per-click advertising, I am focused on keeping it simple and results-oriented.

Humanizing Content for Maximum Impact

One of the largest blunders companies commit is producing content that reads like a robot. In a world where customers hunger for authentic relationships, robotic content does not convert or engage. My strategy centers on humanizing content—writing true stories, speaking in a conversational tone, and establishing trust with readers.

For instance, rather than forcing keywords artificially into a blog post, I would advise companies to tell stories. If you own a café in Kerala, don't write about ""the best coffee in town."" Tell the story of how you source your coffee beans, meet your baristas, and feature customer reviews. The human element is what matters here.

A Kerala-Based Consultant with a Global Outlook

Though I am geographically located in Kerala, my online marketing techniques are not geographically limited. Effective marketing principles do not change whether you are selling to local people or worldwide customers. I assist companies in making the most out of current digital marketing trends with cultural and geographical sensitivities intact.

From assisting local businesses in optimizing their Google My Business listings to developing engaging ad campaigns for e-commerce companies, my emphasis is always on driving genuine engagement and conversions. Visibility is not the only aim, but rather interactions that translate to growth.

Empowering Businesses Through Education

Sharing knowledge is one of my beliefs as a consultant. I have workshops, webinars, and individual coaching sessions to equip businesses with the expertise they need to thrive in digital marketing. I do not just offer services, but I want to educate entrepreneurs so they are able to effectively handle their digital presence.

Let's Make Digital Marketing Work for You

2- A question about the banana bread. They want it pre-sliced but packaged in order to be stored, what would be the best way to pre-package banana bread slices and be sure that they will retain moisture for 3-4 days?

This is my first time selling to a coffee shop and it would be a great step for my business, so any help or further tips are appreciated.",1,1739444425.0,AskBaking,6,0.67,False

1ioglg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/askvan/comments/1ioglg8/fitness_world_charged_me_700_unfairly_next_steps/,Fitness World Charged Me $700 Unfairly – Next Steps,"Hi Reddit,

I wouldn’t be reaching out here if I weren’t this lost. Long story short, I feel that my gym, Fitness World, is breaching the user agreement and is now outright refusing to acknowledge it.

Back in August, I went on vacation for four weeks and forgot to inform my gym trainer beforehand. I let him know only a day or two before my trip that I wouldn’t be able to attend our scheduled sessions for the next few weeks. While I was away, I continued to be charged. Since it was an overseas trip, I couldn’t contact the gym at the time. I had a good relationship with everyone there, so I figured it would be best to discuss the issue once I got back.

For context, I believe I had two plans running simultaneously. During the summer, I decided to train twice a week—one plan was prepaid, while the other charged me weekly.

When I returned, I decided to switch back to training once per week as my schedule didn’t allow for more. I asked my trainer if I could use the sessions I had already paid for (both the prepaid sessions and the extra charges incurred while I was away). He advised me to freeze my account, which would allow me to do so. I signed the freeze request form on September 25th, but it took them four weeks to actually pause the payments, despite my constant follow-ups.

When I asked for a refund, they brushed me off. At the time, I didn’t think much of it. However, in December, I suddenly started getting charged again—even though I still had quite a few sessions left (12 or 13 prepaid) Apparently, according to the form, the freeze was only for two months, which is on me—I should have read the fine print. But as soon as I saw the first unexpected charge, I rushed to my gym to cancel it immediately.

It still took them three weeks to process the cancellation, despite my constant nagging.

This was my breaking point. In total, they have charged me $700 for no apparent reason.

When I reached out, they told me they couldn’t refund the money in cash—only in sessions. After this experience, I refuse to ever step foot in that gym again. We’ve gone back and forth over email, but it’s leading nowhere.

I have two main questions:

Do I have a small claims lawsuit on my hands?

Has anyone else been scammed by Fitness World and would be interested in joining me for a small claims lawsuit?

For context, I’m a very broke engineering student. I don’t buy coffee or dine out just to save every cent I can. I saw getting a trainer as an investment in myself. But that being said, I’m willing to do whatever it takes to fight this because it has drained so much of my energy and time.

$700 is a lot of money for me—it’s the difference between rent and dinner.

Thank you for reading my rant. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",0,1739444385.0,askvan,7,0.5,False

Det har været en virkelig positiv oplevelse, og jeg kan mærke, at der er brug for det her – derfor har jeg besluttet at fortsætte projektet ud over de fire planlagte uger. Konceptet er stadig det samme: Vi mødes og går en tur rundt om Søerne. Ingen krav om at snakke, ingen forventninger – bare det, at du er der, er nok. Hvis man har lyst, kan man selvfølgelig også falde i snak undervejs. Vi mødes hver søndag kl. 13-14 ved Planetariet. Ingen tilmelding nødvendig – du møder bare op. Hvis du har været med før, så håber jeg, du har lyst til at komme igen. Hvis du overvejer at prøve det for første gang, så ved du, at du er mere end velkommen – og du må gerne tage en ven med. Jeg tager stadig kaffe og kage med.

(ENGLISH VERSION)

Hey,

My name is Max, I’m 26 years old.

A few weeks ago, I started the initiative Rundt om Søerne, which aims to counteract isolation and loneliness among young men through community. We've now had two Sundays filled with good laughs, new connections, coffee, and plenty of fresh air. It has been a really positive experience, and I can feel that this is something people need – so I’ve decided to continue the project beyond the initially planned four weeks.

The concept remains the same:
We meet up and take a walk around The Lakes. No pressure to talk, no expectations – just being there is enough. If you feel like chatting along the way, that’s entirely up to you.

We meet every Sunday from 13:00 to 14:00 by the Planetarium. No sign-up needed – just show up.

If you’ve joined before, I hope you’ll come again. And if you’re considering trying it for the first time, know that you’re more than welcome – feel free to bring a friend.

I’ll still be bringing coffee and cake 😁

Hope to see you there!

I'm a newbie here, but I've been reading posts for days. I've just acquired a new 4-cup Venus Bialetti because I now have induction. Before, I got to work my old moka properly and I made great coffee with it after a few tests in the stove. 

I can't get the Venus to work properly, I don't get a steady flow during the extraction and a lot of water is left in the tank after it seems to have finished. I will break down the steps I follow and some other details in case I'm missing something or doing something bad:

1. I fill the tank with warm water, not close to boiling point, just below the valve.
2. Fill the funnel with coffee grounded by the same coffee shop I used in my old moka without pressing it down.
3. Put some cold (ambient temp) water in the upper chamber to avoid the first part of the coffee to boil.
4. Close the moka
5. Put in on the induction at 5-5.5 out of 9.

One detail: I replaced the first silicone gasket that came with the moka because this same issue was happening and I saw it was kind of loose. The one I'm using right now is a rubber gasket, but as I said, the same issue happened with the silicone one. 

After the coffee starts coming out, first, it doesn't come out with a steady flow, instead, it comes out a bit, then stops, then starts again... Second, it starts gurgling before it even reaches half of the upper chamber, and a lot of water (maybe 1 cup) is left in the bottom tank after it has finished.

Any suggestions? I can also clarify anything else required to know why it's not working. TIA!",4,1739443406.0,mokapot,2,1.0,False

small things like if I am used to use a mug, a coffee mug, all the time for my coffee, my partner would come in and he would want to use that coffee mug and not let me have my mug. It's that common?

My last partner was so much like that I felt that small bits and quirks of me were getting erased. Like he would go through all of my stuff digital and physical like when I am back from a trip he would go through all my luggage- I have never done that to anyone nor have come across this and I felt violated- he never asked me what he was looking for. 

He would use my things that are just mine - like the coffee mug I mentioned or my bowl or few skin care that I don’t like to share. 

Will it be like this every-time? Do you lose out a part of you( not to the best) but to the worse or a kind of change that you are not comfortable with.

I've owned the Pietro grinder with pro brew burrs for about a year now and it immediately became the best grinder (manual or electric) I've ever used. I no longer felt the need to go to a coffee shop for a pour over because I consistently got better and more nuanced tasting coffee with the Pietro than any EK43 at a shop. Just recently sold a few things to get the 078 as an upgrade to the Ode with gen 2 burrs and it's just as good as the Pietro. I was shocked by the build quality and heft of the 078 in comparison to the Ode. The Ode feels like using a cheap toy in comparison. And while it isn't fully seasoned yet, it's already making some incredible coffee that is rivaling the Pietro albeit with a different flavor presentation.

Two years ago we fought over something and we've been less close, however we still talked and met for coffee or lunch every two weeks or so. I invited her to my hen party, my wedding and the day after the wedding I asked if she and her bf got home ok (they got quite drunk) and she said yes but quickly ended the convo. Fast forward a month I pinged her asking if she'd like to go to a salon opening of our mutual friend together, she said she's busy, I said OK but ping me for coffee when you have time. She thumbs upped me, so I asked if everything is OK, and if there's something unresolved between us. She said ""I am not ok and I don't want to talk about it. Love you"". I responded that's okay, love you too, I am here for you, let me know if you need anything. Fast forward an additional month she hasn't reached out and I shared the news that I am pregnant in a 4 friend group chat. All she said was ""congrats"" posted a gif of a baby and that's it. Other friends who I am not that close with reached out privately, asked about my pregnancy etc. It's now been 4 months since then and I felt really abandoned by her and like she didn't care at all for me. I would have appreciated a simple ""hey I'm in a bad place rn, but just checking in"" or whatever. But nothing. Now all of a sudden she is asking how am I, how's the baby, is it kicking is it growing (yes, babies grow in 6 months....) and I responded nicely and asked how has she been and explained I'm sad and confused we didn't talk for so long. She said ""I'm better, I had a personal crisis, but I don't want to talk about it"". I responded that I would just like to know if it's something in regards to us why she decided to cut contact for 4 months. I feel like anything could have happened during these 4 months, I could have misscarried and she'd be ""how is the baabbbyy??"" because she didn't care to check in. On the other side if something bad was happening to her I told her I am here for her, just let me know and she decided she didn't want to.

Now I'm torn because I am a strong believer that close friendships shouldn't be guessing what's wrong and going no contact for months. But still, AITA for pushing to know why she cut contact for so long in a very important time of my life?  ",2,1739442350.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

We were watching every guest arrive with eagle-eyes and telling each other our suspicions. Anyway, one lady arrived who was probably around 50 or 60, and she had some dark, wiry strands of hair protruding from her chin and upper lip. Instantly we exchanged ""the look"". We were as polite to her as we were always taught to be, and spent the rest of the evening playing dolls with my moms coworkers daughter. 
The next day at breakfast, I asked my mom ""was it [the woman with the dark facial hair]?"" and she literally snorted coffee out of her nose! She was like ""Oh my god you two, you weren't meant to try and guess, and absolutely no it is not!""
