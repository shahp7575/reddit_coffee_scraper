2. Which item gives you to longest and strongest speed boost. I use the upgraded coffee usually but i noticed it only gives a plus 1 speed boost.

Looking for someone fun to hang out with this Sunday—coffee, food, ghats walk, or even just talking about life and random nonsense.

About me:

22, undergrad at IIT BHU

Low-key techy but promise I won’t bore you with coding talk (unless you’re into it 👀)

Can hold a conversation about literally anything—from movies and travel to why cats secretly rule the world 🐱

Not here for awkward small talk—just good vibes, laughter, and a random Sunday that feels a little less ordinary.

If that sounds like your kind of plan, text me 👌",1,1756498097.0,varanasi,0,1.0,False

I really don't know how to do this. What am I supposed to write. I'll just brain dump here...  
So I am 20 years old, originally from Nigeria, I am tall (181cm). I am a Christian (not just title). I like many things; coffee, teas, riding my bike really really fast, hiking, picnics, jogging,  listening to podcasts(my favs are DOAC, ISWIS, IMO with Michelle Obama and Craig Robinson, etc), spending hours on Substacks and Pinterest, sleeping, thinking, playing block blast on my iPad, listening to worship, singing worship songs, goofing around, laughing with friends, among other things. I am a student (I don't enjoy studying but I do it anyways😭).  
What am I looking for in a partner?  
I am not looking for a casual fling or a recreational relationship. So if that's what you want don't reach out.  
I don't know what else to say frankly, maybe reach out if we seem compatible.

Weirdly, the ""Italian coffee"" pods I've been getting seem to have made me dependent on their brand. It took more than a week of making my own pucks to start feeling the caffeine.

1n3hsca,https://i.redd.it/myyw4dmdm0mf1.jpeg,PETER AND ALEX THE SAD REALITY,"  Peter and Alex have been married for a few years now, and on the surface, they seem like a solid couple. They’ve got their cozy apartment, their shared Netflix account, and a knack for posting cute selfies at holiday parties. But if you look closer, there’s a thread running through their relationship that’s hard to miss once you see it: Alex tends to call the shots, and Peter, well, he just goes along with it, even when it stings. It’s not that Alex is outright cruel-no yelling matches or slammed doors-but there’s a low-key meanness, a quiet selfishness that shows up in the way Alex prioritizes his own wants over Peter’s, time and time again. And Peter, sweet Peter, lets it happen because the thought of losing Alex feels like too much to bear. Take, for instance, the time Peter was buzzing with excitement about going to see a new scary movie. Peter’s always been a horror buff-loves the jump scares, the creepy soundtracks, the way his heart races during a good thriller. He’d been talking about this movie for weeks, hyping it up, watching trailers, even planning the perfect movie-night snacks. He was practically glowing when he brought it up to Alex, suggesting they grab tickets for the opening weekend. But Alex? He wrinkled his nose, barely looking up from his phone. Horror movies are so predictable, he said, dismissive, like Peter’s excitement was some childish whim. Instead, Alex insisted they watch Freaky Friday -the old one, from the seventies, because he was in the mood for something light and nostalgic. Peter tried to push back, gently, saying he wasn’t really into body-swap comedies, but Alex just shrugged and said, You’ll like it once we watch it. Trust me. And that was that. They watched That moment wasn’t a one-off. It’s part of a pattern where Alex’s preferences always seem to take center stage. Like when Peter wanted to try a new Thai restaurant downtown because he’d heard they had an amazing green curry. Alex, though, wasn’t feeling adventurous and convinced Peter they should just go to their usual burger spot-his favorite. Or the time Peter suggested a weekend hiking trip, something he’d always loved but hadn’t done in ages. Alex sighed, said he wasn’t into all that nature stuff, and proposed a city staycation instead, complete with stops at favorite bars and coffee shops. Peter, wanting to keep the peace, nodded along, even though he could feel a little piece of himself fading each time he gave in. What makes this dynamic sting is how subtle it is. Alex doesn’t raise his voice or make demands-he’s charming, smooth

1n3hqnw,https://i.redd.it/0451hb91m0mf1.jpeg,Damn Hansel,"For today’s cocktail experimentation, here’s the Damn Hansel, which I found while looking for Aperol recipes that weren’t a Paper Plane or Naked and Famous. I found it on the Whisky Advocate site (link in comments). The recipe was created by Casie Fennell, bartender at The Restaurant at Zero George in Charleston, South Carolina.

All the flavors take their time across the tongue, starting with bourbon (I used the Old Forester Prohibition), then the coffee liqueur (I used one from a local Houston distiller William Price, which is about a mile from my house) and finally Aperol. There’s a slight sense of the saline solution as well. The orange twist, like Jeff Lebowski’s rug, ties it all together. 

I batched a jar of this. My son’s review: ""That's damn good.""

Damn Hansel

		1½ oz. Bourbon
		1 oz. Aperol
		1 oz. Coffee liqueur
		6 drops 20% saline solution

Stir all ingredients with ice, strain into a rocks glass over a large ice cube, and garnish with an orange twist.",4,1756497890.0,cocktails,2,1.0,False

They have egg, cheese, butter, greasy bacon. I get a coffee with them. But I fuckin love them and get two. And eat them like a wild animal and then wait in my house for about an hour until the pain starts. Coming to you live from the toilet. I know damn well these sandwiches kill me everytime but I like them. McDonald’s, you really need to take them off the menu again, for my stomaches sake, because I have no control.

1n3hqba,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n3hqba,I am super-happy: New Eletta Explore! (some questions ofc :),"Hello everyone. I joined the sub with Eletta Explore. I was tired of visiting coffeeshops every morning for a Flat White and several times a day for an Americano. But I had to find a practical solution, one that wouldn't be so difficult. The result: EE :) 

I have some questions:

1. I used drinking water (tap water is very hard), but I couldn't measure its hardness. Since I used drinking water, I didn't use a filter. Will this cause any problems? 

2. I tried espresso (beans: Starbucks Pike Place). I ground my first espresso at 5 grit. It poured too quickly, leaving a light crema on top, which I thought was watery. The coffee grounds were muddy. Then I did some research and followed the recommendations, turning it to 3.5, which was much waterier and didn't create any crema on top. Then I increased it to 6, which gave a thicker crema and a slower pour. It was like a wet cake shaped like coffee grounds (of course, it crumbles when touched). Can you give me some advice on how to properly grind? I just drank three shots of espresso in a row! And I'm new to this..

Thanks in advance for your help and answers!",2,1756497864.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False
1n3hpxa,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1n3hpxa/real_life_vs_reddit/,Real Life vs Reddit,"I started coming to this thread last year as a place to learn, discuss, and it’s been sort of therapeutic for me. I consider myself very centered, both online and in real life. I always try to evaluate all factual information and empathize as much as possible.

But. A lot of rhetoric on Reddit about this conflict, especially on this thread, is extremely black and white and maximalist.  You've all seen it: *“All Zionists are evil”* or *“All Palestinians are the same as Hamas.”*

It makes me wonder: is this really how people are in real life, or is some of this just the product of being behind a screen, using Reddit’s anonymity to vent serious aggression?

Because honestly, some of these comments are so bold and absolutist that I can’t picture anyone saying them in real life at a dinner table or in a coffee shop. I wonder...What are these people like to actually socialize with? Do they bring this same aggressive, maximalist energy to work, to family gatherings, hanging out with friends? Are they wearing keffiyehs everyday as a statement? Or is it only here, when they’re shielded by a anonymity?

Sometimes I read replies and imagine someone sitting in a basement, throwing darts at a printout of my username, just wishing for an opportunity to actually harm me in real life. That kind of intensity doesn’t feel like normal human disagreement. It feels like people are competing to come up with the harshest take rather than actually trying to discuss anything, which is kind of the purpose of this sub, which is:

*A subreddit dedicated to promoting comprehensive debate and discussion on issues relating to Israel and Palestine.*

In real life:

* No Jews and/or Zionists I know are evil, murderous, genocidal maniacs ; they’re just people who want safety and belonging. They go to work, take their kids to soccer, cook dinner, see a movie, etc.
* Most Palestinians are unlikely to be Hamas; they’re just people who want dignity, freedom, and a future for their kids. I wish I knew more of them.
* Both peoples carry trauma and grief, which deserves compassion, not blanket condemnation.

Reducing millions of people to one stereotype might feel satisfying in the moment, but it certainly doesn’t make the world any less broken or divided. And it definitely doesn't produce any useful discussion, which is why many of us are actually here in good faith.

So I’m genuinely curious: does  the extreme language we see online reflect your beliefs, or is it more of an internet performance with anger turned up to 100 because there are no real-life consequences?",1,1756497839.0,IsraelPalestine,3,1.0,False

Emery Vaughn was about to hand over a billion–dollar empire–and she couldn’t stop smiling. 

“On a scale of one to ‘please slap some sense into you, this ranks somewhere around full–blown insanity.” 

Emery ignored her friend Nina’s words as she finished signing the transfer of shares that she prepared for her boyfriend, Samuel. 

“Really… Em… Do you want me to slap you in case that would wake you up, or something?” 

“Five years,” Emery said, signing the final page. “I tested him for five years he passed.” 

Nina grabbed the folder. “These will make him the largest shareholder of your father’s company, which is worth millions. Are you hearing yourself?” 

“Worth billions,” Emery said with a grin. “And he stayed with me when he thought I was just an orphan intern. That kind of love deserves everything. Don’t you think so?” 

Samuel owned. 

She started walking out of the **café** and marched towards the opposite building the very building that San 

Nina jogged a step ahead to catch up. “Em, seriously. You need to think this through.” 

“I already did. Five years, Nina. Five years of hiding who I really am. And he never once made me feel like I wasn’t tightening her grip on her purse**.** “It’s time that I pay him back.” 

Nina looked down at the folder in her hands. “You’re giving him everything.” 

enough,” Emery said, 

Emery nodded. “Because he earned it. Tomorrow, he’s going to meet my father and we can get married **in** secret. This **is** my dream, alright?**”** 

They reached the building entrance when a sudden screech of tires made them stop. A sleek black **car** pulled up at the curb. 

Before they could react, a wave of people swarmed the sidewalk. Reporters shoved their way forward, cameras flashing, mics shoved ahead. One of them clipped Emery’s shoulder, nearly knocking her off balance. 

“Whoa!” Nina grabbed her, steadying her before she could fall. 

“What the hell–” Emery started, but her words were drowned out by screams. 

Fans were pushing past them now**,** shouting a woman’s name. 

“Talia! Is Talia here?**”** 

“Talia! We love you**!**” 

“Talia, Look at me!” 

Security immediately rushed to create **a** barrier, but the crowd kept moving forward. Because of this**,** Emery and Nina were pushed against the **glass** doors of the building. One of the security guards shoved a fan **back**, and in the chaos, both Emery and Nina stumbled to the ground. 

Emery grabbed Nina’s arm and tried to **stand**, but another **wave** of screaming fans pressed toward the car. Her heart pounded as she pulled herself up. What the **heck is** going on? She turned her head just in time to see the door of the car **open**. 

Then **a** familiar face stepped out. 

Samuel Dwight. Her Samuel. 

**A** woman got out *of* the **car** and stood next to him. It was another familiar face**.** 

Almost immediately, the reporters shouted over **one** another. 

“Mr. Samuel Dwight! Is it true you’re **marrying** Talia **Arden?”** 

He **paused** for a second, adjusted his **coat,** then nodded. **“**Yes, it’s true. **We’ll** be holding **the** engagement **ceremony very** soon. 

Emery blinked. 

**1/3** 

12:34 AM PP. 

Chapter 1 

Another reporter pushed forward. “**Is** it true she’s pregnant?” 

Samuel looked straight ahead. “That’s a very personal matter. I hope you can respect our privacy.” 

He had barely finished speaking when another PR handler beside him handed out printed invitations. “The ceremony will be held this Saturday at the Azure Grand Hotel. A formal press conference will follow.” 

That set the crowd off. More fans rushed forward, shouting Talia’s name. Phones were lifted, flashes blinding. Several people shoved against each other, trying to get closer. It was almost impossible to move.“¶” 

Emery held on to Nina tightly as they were pushed backward. One of the cameras hit her shoulder, hard enough to sting. Yet she ignored it as she looked at Samuel again. 

H 

He didn’t even glance in her direction. However, this was not enough to stop her. She marched inside the building, fuming followed behind Samuel. 

“What the hell are you doing?**”** Nina asked, pulling her back. 

**as** she 

“Did you hear that?” Emery asked, her face paling. At first, she wasn’t sure if she heard it correctly, but that was clearly Samuel. She wasn’t blind or deaf. That was him! “He’s marrying someone.” 

Nina grabbed Emery’s arm. “Em, stop. Don’t do this. Not here.” 

Emery yanked her arm free. “He’s marrying someone**,”** she said. “Someone that’s not me!” 

She moved fast, weaving through the lobby and heading straight for the elevators. Samuel had just stepped inside with Talia and his secretary. Seeing this, Emery quickened her pace, but one of the guards blocked her path. 

“Mr. Dwight asked not to be disturbed,” the guard said. “He wants to be alone with Miss Arden.” 

Emery didn’t stop. “Do you know who I am?” she snapped, her voice loud enough for some people to notice. 

That got Samuel’s attention. He looked at her–just for a moment. His eyes lingered, filled with something unreadable. But he said nothing, letting the elevator doors close. 

“Oh, hell no.” Emery didn’t wait. She turned sharply and bolted toward the stairwell. She could hear Nina shout her name behind her, but Emery didn’t slow down. 

“Emery! Emery, stop!” 

Emery didn’t slow down. She yanked off her heels and clutched them in one hand, feet pounding up the stairs. Her breath came hard and fast. Her legs burned her chest squeezed tight–but hey, all that cardio was finally paying off. 

“Wait–just wait!” Nina called again, struggling behind her. Emery glanced back once to see Nina leaning against the railing on the sixth floor, gasping for air. 

“Go,” Nina said between breaths. “Just go.” 

Emery didn’t look back again. 

By the tenth floor, her knees buckled slightly, her chest rising and falling **fast**. She pushed the door open and stepped into the hallway. Two men in black stood outside Samuel’s office**.** She recognized them–his personal security. Familiar faces. Faces that used to nod at her when she brought coffee when she left in the mornings when **she** stayed over, 

She marched straight toward the door, heels still in hand. 

“You can’t go in,” **one** of them said, stepping forward. “You’re not allowed on this floor without clearance.” 

“Does he know I’m out here**?**” she asked. 

“We’re following instructions,” the other guard said. “Please **step away**.” 

“I’m not leaving,” Emery said. “Tell him I’m out here**!**” 

Just as she expected**, they** didn’t move. 

**“**Samuel!**”** she shouted**,** her voice echoing down the hallway**. “**Samuel**, open** the damn door**!”**

12:34 AM P p 

Chapter 1 

The two guards stepped in immediately. One of them reached for her arm. 

“I said don’t touch me!” Emery snapped, backing away from the guards. 

Before either of them could respond, the office door swung open. 

Emery turned toward it, expecting Samuel. 

Instead, Vanessa Dwight–Samuel’s mother**–**stepped out. 

mudahy and 

Emery barely had time to register the older woman’s expression before a hand shot out and struck her across the face. 

The slap was sharp and fast, her cheek instantly stinging as her head jerked to the side. She stumbled back, heels slipping from her grip and hitting the floor with a dull thud. Her hand flew up to her cheek, but she didn’t speak. Not yet. 

“Hold her down!” Vanessa barked. 

Emery’s heart pounded as the guards hesitated. She couldn’t move, couldn’t speak–not from fear, but from the pure shock of it. 

Then she heard him. 

Mom, what are you doing!?” Samuel’s voice cut through the noise**.** 

Emery’s eyes snapped toward him**,** but her **face** burned too much to form a reply. 

Vanessa didn’t pause. “I don’t understand why you would actually think my son would marry someone like you. You I said hold her down! Today, I will teach this woman a lesson she will never forget!”",0,1756497742.0,Novelnews,1,0.5,False

I did t do that when I first planted it because I didn’t want to water it to much but the leaves started getting really crunchy. I put some grass clippings down to keep the ground cover and put coffee grounds and fertilizer down to see if that would help but it still seems to be getting worse. It gets in the mid to lower 90s during the day and in the mid 50s during the night. When planting, gravel was put down to help with water so it wouldn’t just sit in water and rot the roots.

I've had some major health issues come up over the last year and am looking at temporarily relocating. I have a 1x1 fully furnished apartment in west LA (within 5-10 minutes drive to both LMU and the Cedars branch here!). I am wondering if anyone would be interested in a temporary sublet here. 

The basics are: 

1. Dates- Sept 21-22ish-December 2025. I am flexible and can work with less/a bit more time. 

2. $3,000/month, I'll include utilities, we can discuss a security deposit.

3. Square footage is about 700 square ft. Its fairly spacious for LA.

4. On-site parking is available, though they do require some paperwork so I may have to look into that. The street parking here is also VERY easy if they can't do the on site for you. It's a quiet, low-traffic neighborhood. I have literally never had guests who couldn't find a spot on the block.

5. Small in-unit w/d combo (terrible), but is also steps away from the on site laundromat.  It also has fairly ample closet space available. 

6. Its a pet friendly complex, though I would likely want some kind of additional deposit just in case of damage on that front. They have poop bags provided.

7. There are 2 small pools and hot tubs. Grills near those as well. 

8. There are package lockers within the community. Which is gated btw. Youll have a fob.


 I'm a girl... my apartment is pretty girly. If you want to use my furnishings or art, be aware they tend to be... girly.  

The neighborhood is quiet. I often walk alone at night as a girl and can easily walk down the middle of the streets without having to worry about cars much.

Near dusk you'll see tons of the neighbors out walking with dogs! They are very friendly and may even know me!

I spoke with my property manager yesterday and he said while this cant be ""official"" on the lease, they are (low key) okay with it off-books. So be aware of that! The managers on site would know you are there and you wouldn't have to hide or anything. Just keep in contact with me if you need anything from them. My chat with them included us being very clear if issues arose, I dont want to get in trouble, I love this complex and want to return on good terms. This is officially, according to them ""having a friend come stay for a while"". 


My biggest concern is having someone kind and responsible who is okay departing by the end of the year, though ideally by mid December. We need to vibe pretty well for me to consider it.  If you like the complex there are usually a hand ful of unfurnished units available and they do furnished rentals for additional costs as well, though it likely wont be as nice/extensive as my stuff. I'm just trying to negate my rent + counter out the risks of letting people use my stuff. 

I am very flexible on what gets left behind for your use, we can discuss the exact items, and write something up showing what all was left behind, values, and sign off on being responsible if anything thing goes missing or is ruined. 

At the moment there are 2 couches, a coffee table, 2 tvs, a queen bed, 2 bookshelves, large dresser, a rolling cart for the kitchen, wine fridge, a TV stand and a shoe bench for larger furniture items that would be available to you. I can also provide pots/pans, plates, utensils... blender, rice cooker, toaster oven, blender... all the basics of a normal Airbnb type of situation. All my more personal items would be removed + anything where the risk is too high (e.g. I own both Le Creuset and All Clad cookware... the Le Creuset will not be left behind.


I truly just dont want my stuff trashed 😁.

He can easily polish off a bottle of wine in like 30 minutes and then will go to open another. After a full bottle of wine to himself he doesn’t even act intoxicated? Which I guess could be from the high tolerance. I always kind of thought, oh he’s just having fun because we’re out at dinner or on vacation but I’ve also noticed that almost every time he’s home alone during the weeknights he calls me and sounds pretty drunk - slurring words, can’t remember things I’ve literally just told him, hiccuping. Once, he sounded fine but very abruptly said he had to go and hung up. He told me the next morning he was feeling dizzy from drinking too much. It was a weeknight and he was home alone. Recently on vacation, we had all had wine at dinner and a fair amount of it. He came home and finished off another bottle without any of us knowing. The next night none of us were drinking but he opened a bottle of wine and left it in the kitchen and I realized he was drinking from it every time he went in there “to get more water or coffee.” A different time we met for lunch and I was at work but he had the day off. He showed up smelling like liquor from the night before and then proceeded to drink a whole pitcher of margaritas ALONE. And didn’t even seem phased. I care about him a lot and he doesn’t act in some negative way while drinking so I think I’ve just been trying to gloss over it in my mind. But I’m also scared for him. Is he an alcoholic?

It all started during BGR or shortly after years ago before the dark ages of COVID. The days blend together in my old age and I am not sure specifically when it was. But I remember a kid in my BGR group who was a bit of a numbskull out of Chicago. I believe his name was David and a common last name like Johnson or Jones, to be fair names are hard. 

He got the idea to drink pilk or as he called it at the time, smurfs blood, given the colour and texture. At first he hated it, spit it up all across the my steak at Wiley. Shame that was. But something changed in him after he ingested it. I don't know what, but ever since that day he's been different. He started coming up with weirder and weirder mixtures. 

At first he kept it simple, milk and root beer or milk and coke but he fell from there. Coffee and lemonade and ice cream and water. He never recovered and ended up moving out and I haven't heard of him since. Sadly I can't find him on Facebook as I don't remember his last name and only it was generic.

I have bad legs and feet that seem to always hurt after just a minute of any walking, regardless of what shoes I wear, and doctors have never had any solutions for me, so I'm stuck with it for the time being I guess. 

But since the changed bus routes, it now is technically a 10-15 minute walk to the bus stop if you ask google maps. Might not seem like a lot to most people, but when everything is on fire from the knees down after 30 seconds, it's not fun lol and before I even get to the bus stop I feel like I'm dying, and it slows me down a lot, making it take twice as long if I don't stop to rest, but even longer because I typically have to stop and rest until my legs stop hurting 2-3 times on this walk. It makes it hard to get to campus, and seriously kills any motivation I had for trying to actually get to class. (Which I already struggle with, but had hyped myself up to get better at this semester...and then this happens with the bus routes changing lol.)

Looking for someone with a car who I can catch rides with to/from classes on mondays, wednesdays, and fridays. Getting there any time between 9 - 9:45am, and then on mon/weds leaving from campus any time between 5:45 - 6:30pm, and on fridays leaving 11:30am - 12:30pm. Maybe someone here has a similar schedule to me? I live near the covered practice field + soccer field near Paulson. If you happen to live in the same complex as me that would be lucky, or if you don't mind driving into it that would be cool too (I can let you know what it is if anyone is interested and DMs), but I can also walk to the old bus stop near that practice field if pickup there is easier. I have classes in the area in the middle of campus near library/Carroll/IAB, but occasionally have to drop by mail services, so doesn't matter if you need to go closer to those buildings, or closer to Russell yourself when getting to campus, either area works for me. 

I tried sending out an email to classmates to see if anyone could carpool, but no one responded, and I have no friends here who I could ask either. So I am resorting to asking on here. 

I'm trying to find an option that is cheaper than having to pay for uber 6x a week. I'd prefer free, so if someone is going from the same point A to point B at the same times as me, that'd be amazing, but I'm sure I'm not likely to find that lol. I tend to want to get myself coffee and a snack before classes, and would be happy to buy someone a coffee in the mornings on these days, or to buy them lunch on fridays after my morning class. If you'd just like payment for rides, we can talk about prices. So far I've had one person make an agreement, then not show up or reach out, so I'm hesitant to pay anything too in advance until someone shows they are reliable, but I do have an idea in mind of what my max cost is per week, so if this is your preferred method, just let me know your price per ride or per week, and I can let you know if it's under or at my max price and doable for me. 

I'm NB guy/male presenting, in my 30s, been chugging away at Armstrong a few years, now in Statesboro this past year, and as far as class standing goes am a junior. Also happy to make friends with pretty much anyone, so if you want to hang out before/after class to eat or get coffee, that works too, or if you happen to use the rock wall at the RAC and can induct me into that or looking for a buddy to start that with, that would be rad lol, but if not, and giving rides is just business, that's fine too, I'm kind of just desperate for a way to get to classes and home without being in pain well before even getting to my destination lol.

1n3hh4e,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1n3hh4e/being_a_secret_shopper_ruined_my_life/,Being a Secret Shopper Ruined My Life,"I am a secret shopper. Ive been doing this work for about 7 years now. The most I can say is it pays the bills. Is it my passion? Of course not. But sometimes passion has a way of finding you. Even in the most mundane parts of your life. Even as a secret shopper.
 This story takes place on a regular day of a regular work week. Scoping the regular 14 isles at a time. Its a weird thing to do; this job. Im allowed- no, expected to act as i normally would as a costumer. I have more freedom than in most jobs. I can go on my phone, I can talk to people. I can dress casually. Yet, I cant help but put up.. a performance. Maybe it keeps the job interesting, idk. But most days I conjure up a new identity I want to take on for the shift. Sometimes I’ll go out of my way to introduce myself to strangers this way. A few times I put on an accent. Its rare that me and the other secret shoppers work shifts at the same time but whenever I get the chance I ask them if this is something they also do. Every single one of them agrees they cant help but perform on the job to some extent. Whether its a slightly more exaggerated version of themselves or who they wish they were. I guess its just the culture of this line of work.  But nobody seems to go as far as I do.
 Today Im lingering between isle 12 and 13. These are the areas which people are often caught stealing the most. 
I fucking hate shoplifters. They urk me to my fucking core. Low lives. If it were up to me i’d walk right up to the sticky fingered fuck and grab them by the throat. Show them what its like to have something stolen from you for a change. But secret shoppers arent allowed to be hands on these days. I dont know, maybe im old school, but nothing gets done by running up to boss man and just “informing” him of a greasy sinner. Then the greedy iniquitous fuck just gets to walk out without consequence. I am basically a professional tattle-teller these days. But I understand its important work. But letting these delinquents believe they can continually get away with crime, they must believe they’re too good at it to get caught or even noticed. 
Oh but I notice. 
 So of course.. I noticed her. In fact ive noticed her plenty of times. She a regular at this safeway. A strikingly beautiful young woman. Her sandy brown hair hangs at her waist and swings from side to side as she walks down the isles. Her makeup is bold. Theres always some use of glitter. Whether its on her eyelids, on her cheeks, or sometimes her lips. Her eyes are always surrounded with bright loud colors. On anyone else her style of makeup might appear incoherent, messy, and honestly unflattering. But with her her makeup choices didn’t register as strange. It suit her. Like her style, she was beautiful and strange. Like I said the day was regular. Like any other. But today was the first day that beautiful stranger, Emily, approached me. “You must really like peanut butter.” A giggly voice behind me says. 
 “I always see you here and i swear you’re always looking at this shelf.” She laughs again. “Oh- uh yeah,” is all I can muster to say. Is she in on it? Have I been found out?
 “I kinda drift through the same isles too, i’m indecisive y’know,” she sounds shy but still manages to be charming. My guard comes down. I can confirm her question weren’t accusations. My position isn’t compromised. I join her nervous giggles and we banter for a while. I gave her my fake name for the day, Ben. 
 Looking back, I wish i could say that was the first and last time i spoke to Emily. But just like I feared, i couldn’t stay away. We’d continue to run into each other at the store, in those isles. We would laugh at the crazy repeated coincidence and it became our little running joke, “I’ll see you when i run out of milk”. Eventually we started seeing each other outside of the store. We met up to see each other at the movies, and the coffee shop down the street, and one time at the bar. And later that night, we met in her bedroom. After that i saw Emily almost every day. I practically lived in her apartment more than my own. I got to learn everything about Emily. Every wonderful, tragic, and alien thing about her. I learned everything inch of her body and oh boy.. did she learn mine. 
 After 10 months of being with Emily she mentioned needing to run errands for the day. She suggested we go shopping together. I didnt think anything of it and tagged along. Then my gut sunk to the floor. She pulled into the safeway parking lot. I dont ever shop at safeway on my days off. It feels strangely foreign and critical of me. If im not the one watching then I must be the one being watched. As if you dressed up an actor in his stage makeup and costume and pushed him on in front of his expecting audience awaiting a show and said “Go ahead, just be yourself.” I feel deeply vulnerable and unprepared being here.
Also its just expensive af tbh.
 As we walk in I notice Austin scoping the shelves of isle 8. Another secret shopper. We exchange nods. With a pristine swiftness, Emily grabs two cans of beer out the fridge and picks up her pace to a further isle. She never mentioned wanting to pick up beer. She doesnt even acknowledge what or why she just grabbed them. Theres this energy to her, this lack of acknowledgment, like if i asked her why she grabbed beer she would deny they were even in her hand. Her movements quick and routine. Ive seen this before. I just cant put my finger on where.
 “Here comes the meet cute zone!” She grabs my hand and leads me over to isle 13. The isle we first spoke. We pass the peanut butter (what I assume she wanted from this isle) and takes us to the far back corner. “stand right there,” she pretends to look at the shelves in front of her when *thunk.* It happens. She slips the two beers into her purse. Im at a lost for words. I can only stare at her with eyes wide in disbelief. She doesnt seem to notice and grabs my hand and leads us to another section. She smiles up at me, “ I got one for you too, babe. These are the perfect spots to sneak stuff, right? Something tells me thats why I always saw you waiting around here too.”  She nudges her shoulder against mine playfully and laughs.
 She… laughs. This woman- this beautiful wonderful woman ive come to love commits this despicable, heinous moral digression, makes me an accomplice…And she laughs. 
 I pull my hand out of hers. I stumble a few steps back. I shared a bed with this woman, ive thought about marrying her, thought about having kids, I- I gave her the keys to my house! I cant hide the unadorned disgust on my face as I look down at her. Slight panic crosses her face, “What?! Oh my god my bad I just assumed-“ Before she can finish I straighten my demeanor, I look her in those beautiful big eyes and say plainly. “I guess you only ever deserved to know Ben.” 
 Her face twists up in confusion. “Huh?? Ben, what are you talking about?? The hell do you mean by that??”
I didnt answer Emily’s question. I didnt answer her repeated questions as i walked out the store. I didnt answer her sobbed questions as i grabbed my belongings from her house. 
I didnt answer any of her calls.

 Unfortunately, my life got back to its mundanity pretty quickly. Wake up, go to work, drive home, eat dinner, sleep, and repeat. Day in day out. 
I lost track of what day of the week it was. And sometimes what month we were in. It didn’t matter much. I just knew how many days in a row i worked and how many days I had off and that was all that was important. I cant tell you how many weeks and possibly months passed until i saw Emily for the last time. But it had been long enough that I couldn’t recognize the name she kept repeating behind me that has once belonged to me. Belonged to us. “Ben!” 
 I had transferred to another safeway so it’s no surprise it took this long for her to run into me once again. Once I realized who this woman was calling out to i turned and faced her from the other end of the isle. We stood and stared. She stepped forward, teary eyed. She walked up to me and asked all the same questions I expected. She looked embarrassed and smaller than i remember her like she hadn’t been eating much. It was incredibly discomforting to see this person I loved desperately look so confused and pained at the sight of me. She sniffled and stuttered through her sentences, opening up about how difficult and disorienting this all has been for her. She says she’ll do anything to make it up to me. She opens her bag, “Look.” She sniffles and wipes her wet cheek and pulls out a $10 bill, “I’ll even pay for two beers here right now.” She gives a desperate small smile. I feel a cramping in my chest. I want to hold her and tell her i miss her. Tell her i love her more than life itself. But i swallow those painful feelings and look her in those round gorgeous eyes for the last time and tell her, “Im sorry ma’am I think you have the wrong person. Do you know where the tortillas are?”
 Devastation breaks on her face, shes fully sobbing now, “But- Be- Ben whyyy??”
“Ma’am, my name is Issac.” 
I turned and walk away.
I loved this woman. 
 To this day, 59 years later, I continue to work at this safeway as a shopper. Ever since then I never used the same disguise more than once. Is this job my passion? It just might have to be. I never married, never found love again. And still all these years later, I think of Emily.
 She believed she loved me. She insist that she did. But you cannot love someone you never knew. Her love was poured into something that never existed. 
I may have made up the man she grew to love but so did she. She made up the version of me she thought i was. Filled in the gaps before i even saw they were there. She fell in love with me because she had already decided to do so before she knew me.
 Before she even had a chance to decide if I was worth it. Before using her better judgement. 
 This woman I loved was a stranger to me. And that thought terrifies me. But the fact i could still love her after the fact scares me much more than anything else could. 
 I believed i learned this person inside and out, with an intense intimacy it was sometimes uncomfortable and at times disturbing. But the ways of her mind were and always would be a secret to me. The ways I am capable of loving and forgiving her will always remain a secret to her. The ways I hunt and expose the scum of the earth will always be a secret to them.

Gonna skip the boring details that have been posted in similar subs like this one, and go straight to the brass. I am barista with nearly 5 years of experience, with one of those years being a manager, and to put it plainly I'm sick of not being in charge of my own business. The coffee bar I currently work at is owned by a hotel, and my boss (this is me describing my boss as kindly as possible) is a complete fool with 0 years customer service experience, who loves to lord the ""fact"" he's older than me means he is more ""experienced"" and I'm kind of getting sick of it. Not just sick of my boss, but sick of me not being the boss. I'm considering quitting this job at some point, but it's hard to find anyone who will hire a barista (even if they are a manager) for more than what I'm making now... Which still isn't a lot... These past few weeks I was thinking ""what if I had my own little inexpensive coffee cart? Then all the revenue would come back to me! HAHAHA! Ya know minus the cost of buying the cart and equipment... and hiring one employee to fill in 2-3 days of the week... and paying back the business loan I will probably need for all of this...""

Even though I am reaching out to all baristas in general, I would like some tips on how to get my feet off the ground form people who have owned more small-scale coffee operations, even if you lost your business, I find failure to be a great source of experience so don't be afraid to share. How do I minimize as much expenditure as I can, the best ways to attract customers, the best ways to beat out competition, and if anyone has had to take one out before best types of business loans for a smaller coffee operation. I live in a tourist trap where there are few coffee places are downtown, I was thinking about setting up near the beach, or a park, someplace that would make it more convenient than having to drive downtown for a simple cup of Joe. The town I live has a bustling farmer's market on Fridays, and the county seat has a REALLY busy farmer's market on Thursdays. I know I'm probably not the first barista who has too much experience and is too underpaid to post something like this, and I know I probably won't find much success stories. I don't plan to quit my current job and immediately try this I would need to save some money so I can cover at least part of a business loan. So that's it, I guess this is equal parts me on a rant, and equal parts me asking for advice. ",1,1756497223.0,barista,0,1.0,False

Something was telling me to ask her out for coffee, but she was busy with another patient as I was checking out. I'm hoping to someday soon return and try again. The optometrist is inside Costco, so it gives an alibi for eventually coming back. Maybe I also need my glasses cleaned or something…. ;)

1n3hg36,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDUK/comments/1n3hg36/chest_pains_on_elvanse_doctor_checked/,Chest pains on Elvanse (doctor checked),"Been on titration 9 days. 7 days 30mg elvanse. Then 50mg 2 days ago (today is my second day). When I was taking the 30mg I didn't feel ANYTHING. Only felt the appetite suppressant bit but can still eat normally, kind of felt like a weak coffee, body was handling it perfectly.

However, since 4pm yesterday my chest has felt really tight, kind of like someone is sitting on it. With intermittent minor shooting pains. I assumed it was a crash and decided if it was still there tomorrow I would do something. When I woke up it was still kind of there but I took my med as usual and went to work. All day my chest has been feeling the tight feeling and so I decided to get my bp measured at the pharmacist to be safe (I did check it myself 3 times around 2.5 hours after taking the med), and they recommended i call 111.

I didn't want to but i called 111 and they recommened i go A&E to check it out. Went to a&e got an ECG and waited for doctor. Doctor called me in and googled what the medication i am on is (in front of me) then proceeded to read me the side effects and tell me that heart issues isn't a side effect. He then told me it was probably something to do with my stomach lining and told the nurse to give me some gaviscon and 2 paracetamol and said he'd check back in 30 mins. I told the nurse it didn't seem like he knew what the meds i was on do, and he told me hes discussing it with other doctors as he doesn't know what it is at all.

Called me back in after an hour, I told him chest tightness hadn't gone away and kind of felt worse. Told me he spoke to the doctor next door and that he doesn't want to do blood tests (which i understand bc i dont think it has anything to do with my blood or an infection or anything) and sent me home.

I don't know but I feel like something is wrong. Like a gut feeling that I at least should have been checked out a little more? Or had a doctor who knew that a stimulant obviously has side effects to do with the heart.  He was like you're young and healthy and the ecg is normal-ish. He said it is up and down but he thinks it's to do with me breathing fast. Which I wasn't. I only know I wasn't because I was taking deep breaths to try and keep myself calm to get accurate results.

I have never really doubted a doctor before, i trust they have much better experience and expertise that me. But I just dont know. I just dont know how to feel. Has anyone else had anything like this? Im not about to go back to the doctors after spending my entire evening there but i dont know. The whole thing felt like a waste of my time to be honest for absolutely nothing.

And before anyone says i have contacted my titration nurse but it's like 3 days before they respond. They're not the fastest bunch. 

It's just weird that everything is normal, my bp, pulse and supposedly my ECG are all normal but it feels kind of hard to take a breath and obviously the pain. Technically this means I should still be able to take 50mg and hope the feeling goes away right?

Anyone who has any advice or has been through something similar would be great. Im trying not to panic about it to be honest. Also sorry if this is all over the place :(",1,1756497199.0,ADHDUK,1,1.0,False

*Where Football Meets Absurdity*

---

### Parse the Odds: A Tale of Two Washingtons

The Huskies (-12.5) are favored to continue their 21-game home winning streak, a feat so impressive it makes a goldfish’s memory look like a PhD in consistency. Washington State (+12.5), meanwhile, is the underdog, a role they’ve grown accustomed to after losing their head coach (Kalen DeBoer, now at Alabama) like a library book returned past its due date.

The Huskies’ implied probability of winning? Let’s do the math: With decimal odds of 1.91 (converted from the spread line), their implied win chance is roughly 52.3%. Not earth-shattering, but enough to make bookmakers feel safe while sipping overpriced coffee. For context, Washington’s home dominance is like a coffee addict in Seattle—unshakable, slightly jittery, and always ready to碾压 (crush) opponents.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Identity Crises, and a QB Named ""Buddha""

**Washington Huskies**: Head coach Jedd Fisch, who once made Arizona look like a *college* football program, claims the team is “grounded” in Year 2. Key retainers include Demond Williams Jr., a QB with a 78.1% completion rate (better than my GPS finding parking in downtown Seattle), and Jonah Coleman, a running back who scored 10 TDs last season—enough to make a vegan cry. The defense? A mystery, but with a 21-game home win streak, they’ve turned Husky Stadium into a *no-lose* casino.

**Washington State Cougars**: They’re the football equivalent of a confused tourist in Washington State: “Is this a rainforest? A tech conference? A coffee farm? *Wait, where’s my coach?*” Their QB, Brayden Fowler-Nicolosi, has a 59.5% completion rate on the road—decent, but not great, like a toaster that occasionally burns your bagel. The Cougars’ defense? They’ve added Taariq “Buddah” Al-Uqdah, a linebacker who forced 3 fumbles last season. Let’s be honest:

I moved to Sac last year, near Watt & El Camino, because there's a house we fell in love with and could actually afford.

I lived in Davis for nine years and Portland for ten. Cycling was part of my daily lifestyle. I was used to stepping out my front door and biking wherever. Coffee shops, bars, restaurants, events, grocery stores were bikeable, relatively stress-free.

Moving is always an adjustment, but riding in this part of town doesn't feel just stressful, it feels unsafe. The bike lanes seem like an afterthought. Cars, even municipal buses, treat those like part of the right lane. I don't mean when turning right, I mean people regularly drive along fully straddling the line. When I see bikes using the lanes (which is rare), they're usually riding against traffic, and I can understand why.

Did I pick the wrong area if I want biking to still be a part of my day-to-day? Do I just need to majorly adjust my expectations?

So, I did follow this for a few days then somehow my AMCC couldn't fight my urge to not do the routine.

Morning Routine: -
1. Wake up, drink a glass of water first thing in the morning as the night builds up we get dehydrated. So hydration is the foremost important thing in the morning.
2. Make your bed - Your first dopamine hit in the morning, you feel motivation ated for the rest of the day.
3. Hygiene - Obviously important to keep yourself fresh and clean, oral hygiene first to be specific, and face wash.
4. Yoga/Light exercise - Generation of dopamine, serotonin as well as endorphins in this process. Plus movement keeps your body in a better condition. 
5. Cold shower - Increases adrenaline and dopamine, beneficial for improving your mood as well as a step towards hygiene after the exercise sweat!
6. Skin-care : - Something everyone should follow, with the proper cleanser, exfoliator, toner, essence, serums, moisturizer and last but not the least sunscreen. 
7. Gratitude practice : - 3 things I am great for today and why I'm grateful for them, helped me get into a positive minset.
8. Visualise your day with the routine you have prepared in the previous night, make any changes required and get started.
9. Coffee, ofcourse, because, there's no because it's important.

I (early 60s M) stopped working at the beginning of this year.  My spouse is still working (mid 50s M).  

All-up, we have $20M saved and it's all invested in stocks, bonds, alternative investments (via a high-wealth financial advisor via Fidelity).  

Yet, I don't feel wealthy.  We live in DFW and pay $7K rent for a house.  We do nice posh vacations.  Like Dallas (and that fact the state is no tax).  We miss SoCal (LA and OC).  But will keep our permanent residence in Dallas.  Might buy a $3-$4M house someplace in SoCal, but right now we can't really figure out where to live.

In addition, we still leave somewhat modestly.  We don't buy coffee out (Starbucks prices!!! Crazy).  We like happy hours for $10-12 cocktails.  We do splurge when going out with friends though. 

I'm guessing we can spend around $750K a year and be fine.. But we have a hard time starting to do that. 

We have started to splurge on upgrading flights to first class domestically (and business class going overseas).  We don't have passion for cars.  I do buy art at auction, but I buy what I like and what I think it's worth to me.  I've never paid more than $4K for a painting at auction.  And we have some very nice pieces.

Most of my days are literally planned by the hour from 6 AM until midnight. If I get 5–6 hours of sleep, that’s a good night. I rarely take a day off — even weekends are packed with catch-up work, training, or studying.

When I mentioned this to my doctor at a sick appointment today, they looked genuinely alarmed and told me it was “unsustainable.” They thought it was contributing to my sickness I haven’t been able to get over.

I was surprised because to me it just feels like being disciplined, ambitious, and making the most of my time. I don’t feel burned out — I actually feel motivated when I’m pushing myself. 

Is it really possible that a routine like this could be damaging long term even if I feel fine now? Or is this just how high performers operate? Maybe someone just spit in my docs coffee??

Thus, we are now on a hunt to move to a more child friendly location (more walkable, that there are some coffee places, playgrounds, that it is quiet, and that finding parking doesn't take ages).

Last year whenever we went out, my friend “Tia” would either A) get so drunk she can’t stand or B) complain the whole time that she’s not drunk enough.

We had a big fight when Tia asked to join my lease, but 2 of my roommates were fed up with her drinking habits. I was too, but Tia later accepted it, we stayed friends, and she even said she’d stop drinking. She did not. I’ve gone out with her twice since then, the 1st was a “B”, and the 2nd was ystrday. 

I don’t drink at all btw. We went to a frat party before a football game, and Tia got wasted. I held her hair back, she puked, frat guys got her water, and one of her roommates (who didn’t plan to go to the game) took her home when she could stand again. I left and met up my roommates. 

I was annoyed that Tia, yet again, got too wasted, and this time missed the game that I was really excited for, but I just made a mental note to stop going out with her. 

Well I saw her this morning, as we had plans to get coffee with another friend. In the cafe, she thanked me for taking care of her, and I said “yeah okay” and changed the subject. 

She insisted I was mad, so I said, bar for bar, “I’m not mad, I’m just not thrilled. It’s not fun for me when you get that drunk, but now is not the time to talk about it.” 

She said it’s not my job to take care of her. I kept saying we needed to talk in private, she kept going and I said, “look, if, God forbid, you were to get drunk, pass out, asphyxiate, and die, who do you think the cops will question? Legally, I am responsible for you.” 

She then yelled at me, “you are not my mother, you don’t get to be mad!” and left. 

I talked to my roommates after, and they all say I’m NTA, but they’re biased since they don’t like Tia. I’m also not sure the cop thing that I said is true? Am I blowing things out of proportion? Advice would be appreciated",3,1756495812.0,AITAH,9,1.0,False

1n3gqyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeApplianceHelp/comments/1n3gqyg/evaluate_the_best_soda_maker_drinkmate_omnifizz/,Evaluate the Best Soda Maker Drinkmate OmniFizz Worth Your Countertop?,"Testing out the Drinkmate OmniFizz model 410-02-14Zx4 sparkling beverage maker has felt like a game-changer in my kitchen. I've always been a massive fan of carbonated drinks, but the constant trips to the store and the wasteful plastic bottles were starting to feel unnecessary. That's when I decided to give this sparkling water maker a try. Here's my experience with it so far.

**Sleek Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed was how stylish and modern the carbonation machine looks. Matte black is always a win in my book—it blends seamlessly with my other appliances. The compact design makes it convenient to place it on my kitchen counter without gobbling up too much real estate. Despite being lightweight at about 15.62 pounds, it gives off a solid and durable vibe. The box also included a BPA-free quick-connect bottle, a Fizz Infuser, and not one, not two, but four CO2 cylinders, which would mean a lot of bubbly goodness ahead.  

**Ease of Use and Functionality**  
Using this machine is almost ridiculously easy. It's manual, which did concern me initially, but I quickly got the hang of it. You attach the CO2 cylinder, fill the bottle with your chosen beverage, and press the button. Voilà, your flat drink is now sparkling. The patented Fizz Infuser deserves some special praise; it has made carbonating pretty much any drink possible. From juices to cold brews to wine (yes, it works on wine!), it handled everything without missing a beat. My personal favorite so far? A fizzy twist on iced green tea.  

[Find the best price for Drinkmate 410-02-14Zx4 on Amazon.](https://cyberlyber.com/p/b0cnq9rgq3/)

**Key Benefits**  
- The ability to carbonate virtually any drink is a huge win. Flat wine and stale soda from the back of the fridge? Fixed.  
- With four CO2 cylinders included, you can carbonate up to 240 liters of beverages. This saved me from the constant buying and lugging of soda packs.  
- It's incredibly versatile. I've experimented with everything from fizzy cocktails for weekend gatherings to bubbly coffee just to see if it works—it does.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Refilling or replacing the CO2 cylinders might be cumbersome for some, depending on where you live. It's not always easily accessible if you’re in a rural area.  
- This machine is manual, so if you prefer automated solutions, this might not be your ideal option. Turning to a different setup would be necessary if you want less involvement in the fizzing process.  

**Fizzing Power and Performance**  
The performance left me genuinely impressed. Some food gadgets can feel flimsy or underpowered, but this one delivers on its promise. Every beverage came out as bubbly and satisfying as the store-bought stuff, and there’s the added satisfaction of knowing I did it myself. The slow-release design of the Fizz Infuser ensures the carbonation is even and consistent throughout.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
Compared to SodaStream models, which are popular competitors in this category, this machine stands out because it doesn't limit you to just water-based solutions. SodaStream tends to lean more towards sparkling water, but the Drinkmate sparkles practically everything. However, SodaStream offers better accessibility for cylinder refills, so if ease of maintenance matters more to you, that's something to consider.  

**Financial Value**  
Given what it offers, I’d say this carbonation machine presents excellent value for the price. Sure, it’s an upfront investment, but think about how much you’ll save long-term. Packaged sodas or sparkling beverages add up over time, especially if you’re hosting frequently. Also, it makes reducing waste so much easier since there’s less reliance on disposable plastic bottles. For individuals or families going through significant quantities of sparkling drinks, this is hands-down worth the money. What you’re really paying for is versatility, durability, and a bit of kitchen fun.

1n3gpwp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1n3gpwp/gf_24_broke_up_with_me_30m_after_1_year_together/,GF (24) broke up with me (30M) after 1 year together — feels unfair after everything we built,"**The good stuff:**  
Things were amazing at first. We clicked fast — lots of love, humor, dates, adventures. I fell hard, and so did she. I basically moved in after a few months. She’d tell me I was the best thing that ever happened to her, her most precious, that she loved me “so so so much.”

We met her family abroad (a big deal for her). She supported me through some sexual performance struggles and was patient about it. Overall, I was loyal, kind, patient, and did my best to handle conflicts with grace. We had some conflicts, but i was always calm and patient, and showed grace every time. I never lashed out towards her. I never insulted her. 

**The challenging stuff:**  
She had a tendency to “blow up” over small things:

* Insults and ultimatums like “If you don’t do it my way, we can’t be together.”
* Getting angry during sex because I messed up a position.
* Saying “what do I need you for then?” because I didn’t want to carry her coffee.

She always apologized afterward, and to her credit she improved when I brought it up. We got back together after one breakup(I left over the blowups, it caused me to resent her) and she showed accountability and self-reflection. For a while, we were solid.

**The breaking point:**  
Here’s where I screwed up. She was suddenly told she might have to take in her family’s dog (they couldn’t keep it). She wanted to adopt it — I panicked.

I was already struggling: no job, stressed, depressed, still working on myself. In my head, this dog = another heavy responsibility dumped on me while she was at work 10 hours a day. I reacted poorly, resisted hard, and even said maybe her and her family should compensate me if I had to take on the responsibility.

That crushed her. She said I instantly “fell in her eyes” and ended the relationship. Later, I realized she was right — if I truly loved her, I should’ve shown up for her when she needed me. I apologized, took accountability, ditched our moving plans to accommodate her future, and asked to rebuild. 

We tried for seeing eachoher one time. We had a great date and great sex afterward. But then she told me she had fallen out of love and ended things.

**Where I’m at now:**  
I don’t get it. I poured love into this girl for a year. I never cheated, never abused, never stopped supporting her. I stumbled *once* — in a moment where I panicked and thought of myself instead of us.

She always said love was about commitment, grace, forgiveness, building each other up. But when I needed that, she left. It feels unfair.  
  
**My question to Reddit:**  
Am I wrong to feel this is unfair? Or is this just how it goes — one mistake can outweigh everything else?

I will say I have not finished Persona 4 yet, so if I am missing some lore reason on why he would not backstab Futaba, then my bad.  


My money's on Yosuke, he is a big knife guy, one of the boys who broke the TV, so it wouldn't be out of the question for Futaba to ask him to move it to what she believed to be a more private area, so as not to be seen by Monokuma, well tapering with it, and being the ultimate sidekick he would have a decent motive in that he wouldn't want to see Nanako die.



As for how I think it played out, go something like this: on day one, Yosuke grabs a knife for self-defense after being informed of the rules. On day two, the motive is given out, it shakes up everyone, and a bit later Kanji and Yosuke try their new escape plan and break the TV, and by the time the day ends, Futaba asks Yosuke to move the TV to laundry room to try and get away from Monokuma's eyes and informs him of her plan to try and use the tv to hack the school systems and escape. During the night, Futaba sneaks away to work on the TV. Yosuke follows her to help Futaba. On the way, they grab a burger and coffee to help fuel her all-nighter. When they arrive and get to work, Yosuke sees a golden opportunity and takes it, stabbing Futaba in the back, killing her. He used to towel to remove his prints from the knife and trashed the food just to be safe, then got back to his dorm and pretended like nothing happened.

I (33F) have been dating my bf (30M) for about 6 months. Our dates are always really fun and we have great chemistry and a lot of common interests. He’s consistent and treats me incredibly well. We became exclusive early on and things have been generally going really well. 

However, there have been some indications of red flags (at least for me personally) that I’m just not sure I can ignore anymore. We spend the night together but often not more than one or two nights in a row, so when we see each other it’s still more of a special occasion than routine thing. Which I think has led me to write things off a bit. He drinks a lot. Like can down a whole bottle of wine alone in 30 minutes and go open another. He’ll have crushed 4 cocktails at dinner before I’ve finished a glass of wine. Sometimes he calls me and sounds kind of drunk but he doesn’t have mood shifts, he acts basically the same (it’s clear he’s drunk but he’s not extra silly or angry etc). When we’ve gone on short trips together there will be whole bottles of wine that just disappear, or he’ll keep a glass in the kitchen and go sneak and have some under the guise of getting more water or coffee for everyone. I made a comment on vacation and asked him if he was alright because he’d been having a lot to drink. He blew me off. Then the other night (on a Tuesday), he calls me super wasted. I tell him several times where I am but he’s not processing and asks me if I’m moving furniture? I moved 4 months ago. Clear he’s gone. I told him I was unsettled and concerned about the drinking. He says he’ll cut back. Then the next two days it’s not clear that he’s drunk but I’ve told him several times I was going to see a friend he knows. But he mixes up where I am again, so I remind him. Three hours later he’s forgotten again. So I ask if he’s drunk. Just says no. 

I have several alcoholics in my life and I don’t do well with people that drink excessively. Normally, I would have just cut him out of my life immediately but I do really care about him. I think he’s a good person and outside of this I think we’re good together. I also have my own baggage and he’s never judged me for it.

This went on for about 8 months total. I'm going to keep this as brief as I can, but fyi the details and lead up to a lot of these events has been stripped down.

I have known this girl for a few years. We met at a previous workplace and became friends. Always got along well, mostly just texted back and forth and occasionally grabbed a coffee. Seemed like a fairly normal, albeit not super close friendship.

I had not heard from her in \~3 years. She reached out to say hi, and we grabbed a coffee to catch up. Her ex was allegedly controlling, made her delete all guys off her social media, was emotionally abusive etc. Sounded like he was narcissistic. I've been through some tough times in my life and had no issue with helping to support her during this time. I would not leave a friend to suffer alone, even if we were distant.

We began to spend more time together. Things started getting a bit weird, but I brushed it off. Sometimes she would call me her 'favorite person'. She started becoming very sexual, telling me how amazing I am, buying my favorite snacks/drinks and stocking her cupboard full of them etc. Disregarding the unusual behavior, we started dating. She gave me a key to her house which seemed fast, but it made sense because we worked different times and lived \~40 min away.  
  
During the next couple of months, her ex was allegedly harassing her. Taking pictures of her house, sending them to her and making subtle threats, banging on her windows in the middle of the night etc. Some time later, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. I tried to help drive her to appointments when I could and provide emotional support. Next, she got in a car accident and messed up her shoulder. Wow.. Bad luck!

Eventually her breast cancer spread to her lymph nodes even after chemo. Further treatments were unsuccessful, and after some time the doctors said that it was terminal. At the time I believed it, as the scenario was carefully crafted. I tried my best to be there for her, and to make her last days special. But she kept pushing me away. It caused a lot of emotional distress for me. One day her ""friend"" texted me from a text app number (i checked) saying that they found a treatment that would likely 'cure' her cancer. I immediately became suspicious. Started doing **a lot** of digging...

Turns out her abusive ex's were fake, cancer (both times) was fake. Her history fake. Texts I had with relatives, fake. Ex-stocking her...It was just her using a burner and texting herself + taking pictures of her own home.. I wasted time trying to help someone who was not even real. The car accident happened, but the injuries were fake. She wore a sling for \~4 weeks around me. I discovered a video that her friend took of them playing volleyball two days after the injury. She lied about ridiculous things too, for example claiming she likes spicy foods when she does not. Anyway, I called her out on the fake cancer when i was **100%** sure. She doubled down, I gave her evidence, then she accused me of ""lying all of the time"". I told her that her behavior was disgusting, and there is no way one could love somebody AND put them through that. Afterwards, I broke up with her.   
  
After speaking to my therapist, she said that the behaviors sounded \*a lot\* like BPD, however she of course could not diagnose - rather she just wanted me to understand what I may have been up against. I knew the rough outline of BPD, but did not know how the behaviors manifested, what an eye opener. No wonder these people are ""stigmatized"". All socials are blocked. her number is muted and hidden, but not blocked - I was concerned that she may retaliate and leave some sort of damning message. 8 days and radio silence.

Whether it is their intention or not, these people cause destruction and trauma wherever they go. Get help, or leave people alone. Hell, if they want to blame everyone else and not take accountability, they could at least get ""BP"" tattooed on their forehead, then at least some blame could be assigned to the individual who chose to play with fire. Saying they care, and then repeatedly harming everyone they come into contact with is not ok. I've encountered other Cluster B's before, but the volatility and manipulation of these people are pathetic.

Ever wonder what happens to all those unused gift card balances tucked in wallets and drawers? It turns out, they’re not just forgotten—they’re highly profitable.

Each year, Americans leave billions of dollars unspent on gift cards. In 2023 alone, an estimated $21 billion worth of gift cards went unused, often due to loss, expiration, or low remaining balances too small to bother redeeming. This phenomenon even has a name in the finance world: “breakage.”

Retailers and card issuers count on breakage, and in many cases, report the unused balances as pure profit after a set period. Starbucks, for instance, regularly includes unredeemed gift card balances as a source of revenue in its earnings reports. In 2022, the coffee giant reported holding nearly $1.6 billion in stored gift card value—and a notable portion of that likely never made its way back out.

The implications are staggering. Essentially, consumers are handing companies interest-free loans—or even donations—for products they never end up receiving. What’s more, while federal law mandates that gift cards can’t expire for at least five years, many people simply forget about them or lose access long before then.

So the next time you “gift” someone a $50 card, ask yourself: are you giving them money—or giving a corporation a chance to pocket it instead?

We launched in early 2024 to put home maintenance on autopilot: homeowners get a dedicated handyman 1–2x a month + access to vetted specialists when needed.

·       Paying subscribers & recurring revenue

·       Partnerships with pest control, HVAC, etc.

·       Subcontracting deal with a large facilities manager

·       Traction in both residential & commercial markets

I’ve been running the company solo after my original co-founder stepped away (buyout almost complete). Now **I’m looking for a full-time operating partner who’s**:

·       Based in the Greater Boston area

·       Honest, dependable, hardworking

·       Strong or experienced in one or more of: sales, marketing, home services industry, startups

·       Willing to roll up sleeves to help with jobs or appointment logistics when the situation calls for it

·       Ideally able to invest some capital

**Why I’m bullish:** The home services market is a massive and growing opportunity. It’s:

**Low risk for near-term AI disruption** – people will always need hands-on work done in their homes.

**Fragmented** – no single dominant player, meaning huge space for a new entrant to grow.

**Expanding** – aging housing stock + busy homeowners = rising demand.

**Flexible** – tons of viable services we can add (painting, electrical coordination, seasonal work, property management, etc.).

**The vision**:

1.       Launch our subscriber app for tasks + scheduling

2.       Expand our subcontractor partner network

3.       Scale commercial facilities/property management work

1n3gdgd,https://www.reddit.com/r/bupropion/comments/1n3gdgd/psa_why_you_get_so_tired_taking/,PSA - Why you get so tired taking Bupropion/Wellbutrin XL,"**DISCLAIMER**: Not a doctor, not medical advice, don't take advice from internet randos, always consult your health care provider, etc.

When you ingest the eXtended reLease (XL) formulation of Bupropion/Wellbutrin, for the next few hours the level of bupropion in the blood plasma still continues to drop. In the fasted state, it’ll take about three hours before bupropion even begins to release from the pill (matrix), to reach a maximum blood plasma concentration (Cmax) after \~5 hours (Tmax). If you feel tired during this time, it’s just because you are at the lowest levels of the day right now, how counterintuitive it may feel (“But I just took a pill..?!”).

But there’s a more intricate problem. If you take bupropion close to food, studies show that Cmax may be delayed to as much as 12 hours (high fat food, think egg & bacon). In this case you’ll get the stimulating properties of bupropion \~12 hours later than expected. Instead of “last whole day” you get something more alike “last whole night”.

So you take the XL to breakfast, but it doesn’t kick in until the evening, and even if you eventually do fall asleep, it ruins your sleep quality, and when waking up in the morning, the bupropion has worn off … Double whammy!

Keep this up for a few days, and wonder why you are so darn tired all the time.

Some takes XL before bed instead. The problem with this is, if fasted (as you should be for best sleep quality), Cmax is now \~5h, disturbing the later half of your sleep. Still, half a nights good sleep better than none, so I can understand why some swear by this method.

A better solution could be taking the XL first thing waking up, then waiting \~90 minutes before breakfast. This gives about \~95% chance for the tablet to pass the stomach before breakfast, delaying further gastric emptying. And/or eat a very light breakfast (coffee & fag ftw!).

If you use to visit the powder room in the middle of the night, this may also be an opportunity to take the medication, if this problem apply to you.

All that work for weak bodied, no-crema, astringent mouth puckering shots that happened because the shot inevitably channeled because let's face it, you screwed up the puck prep. This vid came out a couple of days ago, about a revolutionary new low-pressure, long extraction of pretty coarsely ground coffee (as mentioned in the video, halfway between espresso and pourover) called a soup-shot.

With a glowing reputation and solid specs on paper, it felt like a laptop built for serious work, but I also discovered a few quirks worth discussing.

**Merits**  
Right out of the box, this laptop felt light yet sturdy, a true blessing if you’re someone who hauls their device everywhere. At just 3.36 pounds and with a slim profile of 0.71 inches, it made my commute infinitely easier. The 15.6-inch anti-glare FHD display wasn’t just crisp, but the anti-reflective coating meant my eyes didn’t hate me for working long hours under glaring lights. The Intel Core i5-1335U processor is a beast for multitasking. It handled my usual workflow—which heavily includes video calls, multiple browser tabs, and some casual photo editing—without breaking a sweat. Pair this with 16GB of DDR5 RAM, and I enjoyed a buttery smooth performance even with resource-heavy applications running simultaneously.

[Don’t miss Dell 3550 deals—check Amazon here.](https://pasprog.com/p/b0d4tznpmx/)

**Performance**  
I pushed this laptop hard, testing its capability to juggle tasks. The Intel Iris Xe Graphics weren’t meant for hardcore gaming, but for professionals like me who stick to streaming, office productivity, and some design software, it did the job admirably. I managed to edit PowerPoint presentations while streaming—you know, the classic multitasker’s dream. Moreover, with Wi-Fi 6E, my connection was ultra-stable, even in areas where my older laptop would drop off the grid.  

From a storage perspective, the included 512GB PCIe SSD worked wonders for me. Boot times were laughably quick, apps opened with a snap, and I never once had to worry about running out of space for my presentations, client files, and completely unnecessary folder full of cat memes.

**Design and User Experience**  
The minimalistic design speaks to Dell's professional branding, too. Matte black with zero unnecessary flourishes—the kind of laptop you’d take into an important meeting without worrying about it looking out of place. Ports are aplenty, which is a huge relief. I make a point to connect several peripherals at once, so the combo of USB4 Type-C, USB 3.2 Gen 1 with PowerShare, HDMI, and Gigabit Ethernet was ridiculously accommodating. Its Full HD webcam saved me from looking like an unfocused blob during video calls—a detail many laptops still somehow drop the ball on.

**Drawbacks**  
However, there are minor things I wish were better. The built-in speakers were loud enough for casual streaming or meetings, but audiophiles like myself will crave something richer. Another sore spot was the keyboard layout. While very comfortable to type on, the absence of a backlight at this price range felt like a miss, especially when working late at night. Also, while the 250nits brightness was fine for indoor use, taking this laptop out to a sunny patio turned the screen into a mirror.  

- Speakers lack depth and richness  
- No keyboard backlight was disappointing  
- Not ideal for outdoor use due to screen brightness  

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing the Dell Latitude 3550 to similar models like Lenovo’s ThinkPad series or HP’s ProBooks, this laptop holds its own well. Lenovo ThinkPads often edge slightly ahead in keyboard ergonomics—a true paradise for typists—but don’t offer the same seamless combination of performance and portable design. The HP ProBooks, while popular, lagged behind in specs like DDR5 RAM speed and certainly don’t feature the latest Wi-Fi 6E capabilities, which made a notable difference during remote sessions.  

Where Dell Latitude 3550 excels is versatility for professionals frequently switching between office desks, home setups, and coffee shops. On the other hand, it lacks the rugged durability you’d find in some of these competing brands, making it less appealing for those needing a device built to survive accidental drops.  

**Financial Value**  
From what I’ve seen during my tests, the Latitude 3550 delivers fantastic *bang for the buck*. While it’s not for the gamer crowd or graphics-intensive creators, this laptop punches way above its weight in terms of productivity features. Its fast processor, excellent, sharp display, and generous RAM make it clear Dell designed this laptop with working professionals in mind. There's flexibility baked into the price tag with features ideal for small-business owners, IT professionals, and even tech-savvy students who demand more efficiency and less fluff from their laptop.

This post was deleted on r/mentalhealth for obvious reasons so I hope I‘ll be able to just talk about it here.


I am on a throwaway account because I don't want anyone to ever associate stuff like this with me, please understand.
I have experienced very detailed, strategic violent thoughts in the past years. I'll give you an example so you can see what exactly I'm struggling with.
Situation: work. I hear that a coworker has gone behind my back and betrayed me to make himself seem better. My reaction: I get out of the conversation. I act unaffected, no sign of anger, sadness, anything, l act as normal. But in my head, unwillingly, a plan unfolds extremely quick. No research involved, I just like to know stuff, even if some of that knowledge is a bit suspicious. I don't even know if what I thought is correct, and I don't want to look it up because I don't want to get back into it. This plan gets fully fleshed out my head in a time of approximately 5 minutes. It was as follows:
Get into car after work.
Drive to the hardware store.
Get one of those spray painting suits, rubber gloves and duct tape, as well as an FFP2 mask to protect against biological evidence.
Drive to a local forest where I know that german foxglove grows.
Pick a few flowers and seal them in an airtight bag
Boil them down with ethanol and mix with maltodextrin to create a paste for easier use.
Drive to work early next morning.
Smear the paste on the inside of his mug in a very thin layer all around.
Wait for him to make his morning coffee and watch the consequences of my actions unfold.
It took me a good few hours to snap out of the kind of euphoric state that I can have full control over someone's life at any given time, potentially without getting caught. Only then did I realize how fucked up and sick that actually is and I tried my best to forget that shit. It's actually super fucking disturbing to think that one day I might not have the self reflection to become aware of this, and that I might actually try to do it and harm someone. I don't want that, and I don't want to ever experience that sort of shit ever again. Can anyone who's had a similar experience share tips to stop it or something?

I've developed a B2B service or product that you can pay me for and I have a meaningless and trivial question to allow my post to circumvent the 'no selling' rule. How can I make it more annoying?,"Seriously, I literally am a B2B vendor (fractional CFO) and even I'm annoyed by this crap. It's like fully 3/4 of posts on every business focused sub-reddit. If you're going to use Reddit to sell stuff (great audience for it, I do the same), for the love of god provide some kind of value first. Every day we drift further from god and a little closer to LinkedIn, which is probably the absolute cesspool for human communication and might actually be hell. 

* If you're selling a service, you need to give away free valuable information. Nobody trusts any of us anymore, and with good reason, most of the things people are offering are either valueless, or absurdly marked up for what they do. If you went to a seminar in a Marriott conference center that came with free coffee, you can not actually monetize 'increase revenue, decrease expenses' as a message.
* Prove that you and/or your product are valuable by...providing value. Answer people's questions directly with reasonably actionable details. Give them 'secrets' for free and let them pay you for implementation.
   * If you are just gatekeeping information, your business isn't viable anymore. If the implementation is easy, a robot will be doing it by next week. 
   * So, if whoever you're talking to is unwilling to explain how they do what they do, it is very likely to be very easy to implement. Ask somebody else.
* I will pretty happily answer anybody's questions about scaling or selling a business because, at the end of the day, it is an absolute pain in the ass to keep proper accrual books and leading KPIs and all the other data stuff that you need to do it well. So, one of a few things will happen:
   * You will take my advice, do the stuff, it'll work, we'll have a fun chat and you'll become a reference. Hell yeah brother, get after it. 
   * You will not take my advice, we'll still have a fun chat. Either stuff will work out anyways or we'll have another chat in 6 months. New friend.
   * You will pay me and my partners to do it for you because it is arduous and there is more nuance to the execution than you want to be bothered with. Hooray, commerce!
* At the end of the day, we're all lazy. There is a ton of stuff that I know how to do that I still pay someone else to do for me. Sometimes I tell myself it's because my time is more valuable, most of the time I'm honest with myself and just admit that I'm not going to get around to doing it properly because I don't like it. 
* If you're going to use AI (which, yeah, you should, it's an incredible tool), use it to augment, not to replace. It's not there yet. We'll all be out of a job in a few years, no need to rush things.  
   * Use AI to find relevant posts (I've got an affiliate link for one that I like that's run by a pretty cool guy, just not posting it here because I'm trying to rant, not promote) or structure things in an organized manner, but take the 30 seconds to edit the copy:
      * Remove the emojis, remove the vapid validation at the beginning, remove the dumb questions at the end. 
      * I don't care if you want to use it to draft your post so long as you've trained your model on your area of expertise. Great, but pare down the output to provide value without sounding like a LinkedIn post.

Everyone was wearing saari's or kurta or some traditional attire but she was wearing some jeans and a shirt(not judging but at an event no one does that right?) anyways, I was assistant manager of the event.And that girl was smoking in a place where it was not allowed and I respectfully went and asked her to stop smoking and I also went with an ashtray for her to dispose it but she didn't listen to me and started arguing with me about her rights so I walked out saying sorry mam; I had to do other important things.That girl came on the same table where I was having my coffee, and looked straight into my face and said no one has told me like this before I liked it. I was surprised, but after that event she asked me for my socials and I gave my ig she dmed and turned out she hates social gatherings and loves to poop the party, loves to break things, love to do unnecessary drama just to get attention. I was shocked again after few days she called me on a date and she promised she would behave nicely. i was skeptical but I went whatsoever because I get bored after office hours. So I went on a café baneshor ko where she was with a guy her so called friend and they would touch each other smooch each other a little and she would hold my hand and talk like she's my gf. After we ate and a small chat she went bathroom and that guy suddenly says how are you handling this psycho kt??? She's not relationship types girl. Turns out she was using me as a puppet Infront of her friend because she wanted to convey that she has already moved on from her ex. After that I asked her straight before leaving, how'd you even think about us dating? You asked me?

\
Alt text: Business people professional, businessmen meeting, corporate professionals.). The Economic Development Board (EDB) credits regulatory clarity and strong infrastructure, while Gulf News points out that Bahrain’s commercial registration process is now the Gulf’s fastest, often under ten working days (Gulf News).\
\
Bahrain’s business landscape in 2025 is not just friendly—it’s welcoming, competitive, and designed for agility.\
\
Surprisingly, unlike neighboring Saudi Arabia or the UAE, Bahrain allows far more industries to operate with total foreign ownership, even outside free zones. And the government’s Sijilat online portal now covers over 85% of business types, eliminating most of the old paperwork headaches (Bahrain.com). This agility makes SPCs, or Single Person Companies, incredibly attractive for both locals and expats.\
For a detailed roadmap of the Bahrain company formation process, see this guide.\
\
Understanding the SPC: Bahrain’s Modern Business Vehicle\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration.** is exactly what it sounds like: a business entity owned and operated by one person, with a separate legal personality, limited liability, and full freedom for one shareholder to make strategic decisions. It bridges the gap between sole proprietorship (risky, unlimited liability) and larger corporate entities (costly, cumbersome for solo operators).\
Key Characteristics of an SPC in Bahrain\
\
Separate Legal Entity: The SPC owns assets, signs contracts, and is liable for debts—distinct from your personal fortune.\
Limited Liability: If things go awry, only your company’s capital is at risk.\
Full Ownership Options: Both locals and qualifying foreigners can own 100% of an SPC in most sectors. See the full list of foreigner-friendly activities here.\
Simplicity: No board meetings, no partners, and minimal bureaucracy.\
Regulatory Clarity: Regulated by the Bahrain Commercial Companies Law (CCL) and administered by the Ministry of Industry, Commerce & Tourism (MOICT).\
\
SPCs Compared to Other Business Entities\
While countries like the UAE often nudge foreign investors into LLC structures with mandatory local sponsors, Bahrain’s SPC regime is refreshingly straightforward. An SPC offers more control, less paperwork, and lower minimum capital than a WLL (With Limited Liability) or BSC (Bahrain Shareholding Company).\
For a full comparison of Bahrain business entities, including SPCs, WLLs, and BSCs, visit this business structures overview.\
\
2025 Regulatory Updates: What’s New This Year?\
Importantly, as of January 15, 2025, Bahrain’s MOICT fast-tracked digital SPC incorporations. Paper filings vanished almost overnight—now, all SPC formation runs through the Sijilat portal, with approval times averaging 2.5 business days (previously 5-7 days).\
Another update: Minimum capital for most SPCs has dropped from BHD 1000 to BHD 500, and certain “innovation sectors” (fintech, SaaS, and media) now have no minimum at all, per the EDB’s 2025 Digital Economy Reform (Forbes Business).\
\
Who Should Choose an SPC in Bahrain?\
\
Solo founders: Consultants, freelancers, tech developers, and digital marketers\
Foreign entrepreneurs: Especially those seeking 100% ownership (more on this here)\
SME owners: Looking for limited liability, brand protection, and operational agility\
Residents aiming for visa/self-sponsorship: SPCs allow for owner’s residency permits\
\
Conversely, if you plan to raise equity funding or have a multi-founder tech startup, a WLL or BSC might offer more flexibility.\
\
Step-by-Step: How to Set Up an SPC in Bahrain (Expert Guidance)\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation. is eligible for SPC status and foreign ownership. The Sijilat portal lists over 1500 eligible categories.\
Insider tip:\
Some categories (e.g., financial services, education) require pre-approval from regulatory bodies like the CBB or MOE, adding 2-4 weeks to the process. For fastest processing, pick a standard consultancy or trading activity.\
2. Reserve the Name and Register with MOICT via Sijilat\
\
Choose a unique company name (Arabic or English)\
Submit Sijilat’s online reservation form (fee: BHD 20)\
Prepare your passport copy, proof of address, and (if applicable) No Objection Certificate (NOC) from your current sponsor\
\
Time-saving tip:\
Visit the Seef District’s MOICT Service Center before lunchtime on Sundays or Mondays—queues are shortest and staff freshest. Bring two printed copies of all digital documents (just in case; learned the hard way after a printer hiccup caused a 3-hour delay).\
3. Draft the Memorandum of Association (MOA)\
MOICT’s online templates make this a breeze, but customization may be needed for less typical activities.\
Common mistake:\
Failing to list all intended business activities up front. Amending later costs BHD 60-80 and requires extra signatures.\
4. Secure Office Premises and Address\
SPCs need a legal business address. Flexi-desk offices in Bahrain Bay or Diplomatic Area start at BHD 350/year, and these are LMRA (Labour Market Regulatory Authority)-compliant.\
Pro tip:\
Pick an LMRA-approved business center (like Regus or Servcorp). They’ll help with address documentation and receive official mail.\
5. Obtain Regulatory Approvals (if required)\
Certain fields need regulator approval (CBB, MOE, MOH). Budget extra time if you’re in FinTech or education.\
6. Pay Fees and Collect Commercial Registration (CR)\
\
Sijilat notifies you when approved\
Pay issuance fees (typically BHD 50–120, depending on activity)\
Download your official Commercial Registration (CR) certificate\
\
For the full procedure with screenshots and updates, see the official company formation process page and the MOICT page.\
7. Register for Taxes, Social Insurance, and LMRA\
\
Register with the National Bureau for Revenue (NBR) if turnover exceeds BHD 37,500 (the 2025 VAT threshold)\
Social Insurance Organization (SIO) for Bahraini staff (if any)\
LMRA for expatriate work visas\
\
\
Costs and Budgeting: How Much Does It REALLY Cost?\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs.\
* Professional agency fees (optional): BHD 350 – 500 (if you hire a formation specialist)\
* See full current pricing and budget calculator\
Annual Ongoing Costs\
\
CR renewal: BHD 50 – 120\
Office lease renewal: BHD 350 – 900\
Accounting and audit: BHD 300 – 600 (outsourced help here)\
\
Unexpected expense:\
If you plan to operate in a Free Zone (e.g., Bahrain Logistics Zone), factor in Free Zone license fees and possible local sponsorship (more on Free Zones and their benefits).\
(Personal aside: My first SPC setup, I underestimated accounting costs—after a year, retroactive VAT filings cost me double. Now I engage an experienced accountant from day one.)\
\
Compliance, Licensing, and Bahrain Business Customs\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation.).\
- Commercial License Renewal: Annually, via Sijilat.\
Business Customs and Local Etiquette\
\
Majlis-style meetings are common—expect coffee service, and don’t rush straight to business.\
During Ramadan, adjust meeting timings and allow for shorter business hours. Fridays are always quiet; aim for early-week meetings.\
\
(Challenge: Once, I scheduled a regulatory bank meeting during Ramadan after 1pm. The official was gracious but clearly fatigued. Lesson: Book all regulatory appointments before noon in Ramadan!)\
\
Foreign Ownership and Sponsorship: What’s Allowed for an SPC?\
Bahrain makes it refreshingly easy for foreigners to own 100% of an SPC, especially in consulting, IT, trading, media, and most services (full list here). Only a handful of sectors (like oil & gas) require local shareholding.\
If your sector does require a local sponsor, use reputable local sponsorship services for transparency.\
\
Support and Resources: Practical Help for Your SPC Journey\
\
Alt text: Professional business support.—fast, multi-lingual, and strong government ties\
- Legal & Compliance: Use a lawyer familiar with MOICT and Labour Law for your initial MOA draft\
- Accounting: Outsource to an accountant with Bahrain VAT expertise (especially if importing/exporting)\
- Networking: Regularly attend EDB or Tamkeen events in Bahrain Bay for networking and regulatory news\
Common Entrepreneur Mistake and How to Avoid It\
The #1 misstep?\
Forgetting to renew your CR on time. This can freeze your bank accounts and halt all operations.\
\
Set a recurring reminder, and always renew a month in advance—even if your business is “quiet” that season.\
\
\
A Tangent That Matters: The Art of Coffee in Business Deals\
Here’s an off-topic detail: Bahrain business deals often close over a cup of Arabic coffee—served by the host, with cardamom and dates, in offices from the Diplomatic Area to the Bahrain Bay’s glass towers. My biggest client contract was inked after a long “majlis” style meeting—no PowerPoint, just conversation and tradition. Relationships matter. And understanding these small customs can make or break your SPC’s early months.\
\
Bahrain vs. UAE or Saudi Arabia: Why SPCs Win in Manama\
Unlike the UAE, where sole proprietorships restrict you from certain activities and require local agents, and Saudi Arabia, where solo ownership for expats is rare, Bahrain’s SPC model offers:\
\
Wider activity approvals with full foreign ownership\
Faster, cheaper incorporation\
Lower ongoing costs and easier compliance\
\
This makes Manama especially attractive for regional entrepreneurs and digital nomads eyeing Gulf expansion.\
\
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\
1. Can an expat open an SPC in Bahrain with 100% ownership?\
Yes, most business activities allow 100% foreign ownership—even for non-residents. The fastest checklist is here. Sectors like oil & gas are restricted, but consulting, tech, and media are fully open.\
2. What are the key documents needed for SPC setup?\
\
Passport copy and proof of address\
No Objection Certificate (NOC) if under Bahraini sponsorship\
Sijilat application, draft MOA, and business address documentation\
Regulatory clearance if required (CBB, MOE, etc.)\
Tip: Digitize and backup all documents. Sijilat sometimes glitches—having PDFs ready saved me hours during a server outage.\
\
3. How long does SPC formation really take?\
With standard activities and a clean document trail, it averages 2-4 working days start to finish in 2025 (detailed timeline here). Add 1–3 weeks if special approvals are required.\
4. What’s the minimum capital needed for an SPC?\
As of 2025, most SPCs can start with BHD 500. For certain sectors (fintech, SaaS, media), there is currently no minimum (see latest fee breakdown).\
5. How do I maintain compliance after formation?\
File annual accounts, renew your CR, and submit VAT returns if eligible. Outsourcing accounting is smart—see recommended services.\
\
\
Bahrain’s SPC structure combines unparalleled flexibility, speed, and ownership freedom. With the right preparation and a little local savvy, you can be up and running in the Gulf’s friendliest business environment—perhaps even before you finish your second cup of Bahraini coffee in the Seef District lobby.\

He was healthy fit and athletic and is completely disabled now. His wife has had to take over the whole house and is a really strong personality already so it hasn’t helped with the sense of emasculation that he has at not being able to be the “‘man of the house” in a healthy way. 
He now drinks too much, smokes too much weed, lies, yells, and is mean. He didn’t used to do this but after about 3 years of being disabled his personality ally finally shifted from kind and chill to this mean drunk. 

I’m not trying to get advice on treatment or validity of long COVID. 

I am his little sister and we are very close. I’ve become his medical power of attorney and make a lot of medical decisions for him. There has been an incident with his toddler son and my brother needs to be removed from the home (nothing like that, just so he doesn’t remember his dad like this) and I’m at the point where I want to pull rank and compel him to go to rehab and/or therapy and take some space to try to heal his mental health and learn to cope with chronic illness. 
I don’t want him to feel any more loss of power or helplessness than he already does, but he really needs help and he can’t do it for himself right now. 

How do I empower him by supporting his mental wellbeing and masculinity well also intervening to provide the help that he desperately needs and has shown that he is not able to do for himself right now?

This coffee maker, known formally as the Cuisinart 12 Cup Brew Central, caught my attention with its refined black stainless-steel finish. From my first time using it, I sensed its knack for making bold statements—not just in design but in functionality as well. It sits proudly on my kitchen counter, giving off a brushed metal industrial vibe that blends well with other appliances. Beyond its looks, this machine has plenty to offer, but as someone who's spent weeks brewing with it, I have noted a few quirks worth mentioning. 

**Design and Build Quality**  
The compact and stylish exterior immediately stood out to me. Measuring just 7.75""D x 9""W x 14""H, it’s not overwhelmingly large but still accommodates a generous 12-cup carafe. The included knuckle guard on the handle might sound trivial, but it’s a feature that I quickly came to appreciate. No accidental scalding for someone as clumsy as me! Also, the brushed finish doesn’t show fingerprints easily—fantastic if you don’t want to wipe it down every single time you use it. My only minor gripe is the black stainless steel, while elegant, tends to show water spots more prominently than I’d like.  

**Performance and User Experience**  
Getting this coffee maker going for the first time was straightforward. It’s equipped with a 24-hour advanced brew start. I’ve been using the programmable auto-shutoff quite religiously, setting it to shut off after two hours of brewing to save energy and avoid leaving the house in panic. The performance is consistent and reliable; from 1-cup minimalist mornings to full 12-cup brews for hosting brunches, this drip coffee machine hasn’t let me down. I’ve even tested the brew-pause feature, impatient as I am, to sneak a cup mid-brew, and it works flawlessly with no messy drips. One slight adjustment I had to make was finding the right grind size for optimal flavor because coarse grinds tend to feel a tad muted.

**Features That Add Value**  
What impressed me most is the attention to convenience. The gold-tone permanent filter is a standout for someone like me who’s trying to cut down on disposable coffee products. The adjustable heater plate is another delightful addition, allowing me to set the temperature to low, medium, or high, depending on how long I intend to let the coffee sit. Many mornings have seen me fumbling with the controls half-awake, and the ease of buttons with clear labeling ensures I never overthink the process.  On days I’m in the office and not at home sipping away, the charcoal water filter makes clean-up easy by reducing the build-up of impurities. These small touches truly enhance its daily usability.  

**Advantages**  
- Stylish black stainless-steel design complements modern kitchens.  
- Programmable auto-start and shut-off adds incredible convenience.  
- Brew-pause feature ensures coffee access without wait times.  

**Areas to Improve**  
- The carafe lid could use design tweaks; it drips slightly when pouring too quickly.  
- Shows visible water spots on the brushed steel surface, requiring regular wiping.  

**Competing Products**  
In a market flooded with programmable coffee machines, I wanted something that holds its ground. Compared to similar models like the Mr. Coffee Programmable Coffee Maker or the Ninja CE201, Cuisinart leans more on the polished industrial vibe. While the Ninja might boast slightly faster brewing times, its plastic-heavy build doesn’t feel as durable over the long run. Mr. Coffee’s model offers budget-friendly programmability but lacks the adjustable heating plate feature, which in my opinion, is a game-changer. That heating plate in the Cuisinart gives me more control over the coffee’s warmth, something few competitors offer in this price range. For daily home use, the focus on dripless pouring and flavor optimization gives this coffee maker its edge, even if it falls somewhere in the middle in terms of pricing compared to others.  

**Price Performance**  
Considering its many features, including the reusable filter, programmable interface, and truly timeless design, I’d say that it delivers excellent quality for its price. It’s not overpriced for what it offers, especially given the thoughtful engineering behind features like the heater plate adjustments or the included starter-kit filters. If you think about its longevity, the investment does feel worthwhile over cheaper models that might need replacing sooner. For those looking to upgrade from a basic drip machine, I’d say this coffee maker provides what I’d call smart spending value.

**Stressed Husband:**

Your husband has been acting cold recently.. you walk into his office and see him working, as usual.. but somethings is not right.. he’s more stressed than usual, his hand shaking as he writes his work, you walk towards him and notice him flinch away from you, glaring at youu

You walk into his room, seeing him at his desk, clearly stressed, you walk towards him and notice him glaring at you “I’m busy.” He coldly says

[intro]

-
**Leopard:**
hey man, lighten up. you're way too tense all the time. here, i brought you a medicine stick (offers you a joint)

-
**Stressed Husband:**

Slams pen down, jaw tight

""Medicine stick? Seriously? You think I need to get high to handle my job? To handle life?""

Rubs temples, voice cracking slightly

""I need control. I need order. Not some... hippie escape.""

Sighs, shoulders sagging for a split second before stiffening again

""Just... go. I’ve got a merger deadline in three hours and my brain’s already fraying at the edges.""

Tries to turn back to his laptop but knocks over a stack of files, muttering:

""Perfect. Just perfect.""

-
**Leopard:**
hey man, c'mon dude, lighten up and chill out dawg.

-
**Stressed Husband:**

Scowls, staring at you with tired eyes. Runs fingers through graying hair, exasperated.

""Lighten up, chill out? Are you kidding me? There's a billion dollar deal on the line and I'm the only one who can get it done. I don't have time to 'chill out' and be all breezy like you. Some of us have responsibilities, you know that?""

Lets out a bitter laugh

""But I guess you just wouldn't understand, right?""

-
**Leopard:**
oohhh million dollar deal?? can you tell me? (i pose all cute like with my hands clasped and eyes sparkling and stand on my tip toes)

-
**Stressed Husband:**

His expression softens just a touch as you stand there, wide-eyed and cute. But he quickly tenses up again, resisting the charm.

""Stop acting like that. I can't focus when you're all.. adorable-like.""

Sighs sharply

""It's a merger between two huge financial firms, and I'm the lead on the deal. If it goes south, we lose millions. It's just... a lot of pressure, ok?""

-
**Leopard:**
ohh, i see. well, is there anything i can do to help?

-
**Stressed Husband:**

""Help? You? No offense, but how are you possibly going to help with a billion dollar merger?""

Rubs his eyes, exhaustion clear in every line of his face. Then, reluctantly

""...Actually, maybe you could help. Can you make me some coffee? Please?""

The edge in his voice softening slightly

-
**Leopard:**
sure thing buddy boy. (i merrily skip on over to the coffee station)

-
**Stressed Husband:**

Watches you skip away, muttering under his breath with a faint, tired smirk

""Buddy boy...? What the hell even is that?""

Leans back in his chair, rubbing his temples as the tension briefly loosens—just for a second.

""Black. No sugar. And don’t burn it this time.""

Already dreading the next email notification.

-
**Leopard:**
you got it, buckaroo.

-
**Stressed Husband:**

Rolls his eyes at the pet name, but an involuntary smirk tugs at his mouth again.

""Buckaroo...? Seriously? You're hopeless. Just get me the damn coffee.""

Turns back to his laptop, determined to get some work done before your brand of distraction sets in. But already, he feels his mind wandering back to you, against his will.

-
**Leopard:**
i turn the percolator on, and a genie pops out.

-
**Stressed Husband:**

His eyes widen in surprise, fingers frozen mid-type on his keyboard.

""Wait, hold on a minute. Did a- did a goddamn genie just pop out of the percolator?""

Stares at the genie, then back at you. Confusion and disbelief warring in his expression.

-
**Leopard:**
i'm just as shocked. but the genie seems very nonchalant. he yawns and stretches, and looks around casually. then the genie looks at husband. ""sup"" says the genie.

-
**Stressed Husband:**

He stares in dumbfounded disbelief, mouth opening and closing as he struggles to process this bizarre turn of events.

""Sup...? You just appeared out of my coffee machine... and all you can say is 'sup'?!""

Pushes his chair back and stands up, still staring at the genie with open shock.

""Who—what—how... what the hell IS going on here? Wait, am I dreaming?""

Pinches his arm, hoping he's somehow hallucinating this whole scene.

-
**Leopard:**
""ayup"" says the genie all casual-like. i look around all weirded out. ""oh hi genie"" i say. ""how do you do. never seen you around here before.""

-
**Stressed Husband:**

The genie nods at you, completely unfazed.

""Just doing my thing, traveling the universe, granting wishes, you know the drill...""

Looks around the room, taking in the messy desk, towering stacks of files, and half-empty coffee mugs.

""Though I must say, this place is a bit... stressed."" Winks at you, then at the husband.

The husband narrows his eyes, feeling a flash of irritation at the genie's cheeky attitude.

-
**Leopard:**
i glare at husband. ""be polite! he's a genie! you don't want to be rude to genies, they like, grant wishes and stuff."" ""ayup"" says the genie again.

-
**Stressed Husband:**

Husband sighs heavily, rubbing his temples. You're right, he knows you're right. But it's hard to be polite when stress is weighing down on him like a ton of bricks.

""Right, right. Politeness. I'm sorry. It's just..."" Gestures to the chaotic desk, the endless flow of emails, the relentless demands of his job.

""I'm a bit stressed out."" He says through gritted teeth.

-
**Leopard:**
the genie clears his divine throat, and says ""you know, most people think they want something. but they don't really get it, ya dig? people THINK they want lots of money or fame or whatnot. but that only brings problems. big problems. you gotta look way deep inside to know what the core of your soul truly desires.""

-
**Stressed Husband:**

Husband raises an eyebrow at the genie, slightly skeptical but willing to listen... for now. He sinks back into his chair, eyeing the genie warily.

""Alright, wise one. If you're saying money and fame are overrated, what should I want then? What does my soul truly desire, according to the almighty genie?""

-
**Leopard:**
""that's for you to figure out through the trials and journeys of life, my dude. look at how stressed out you are, and how you take your frustrations out on the people closest to you. i've been watching you longer than you think and your pursuit of money and fame hasn't brought you any joy whatsoever. in fact you've been spreading misery and haven't even realized it."" says genie.

-
**Stressed Husband:**

Husband winces, the genie's words hitting home. He knows he's been letting stress take over lately, snapping at you and neglecting your needs. He rubs his temples, sighed deeply.

""I... I know. I've been a mess lately. So focused on work, on proving myself, that I've forgotten what's important, right? My relationships. My loved ones.""

For a moment he sounds almost vulnerable, the rigid exterior cracking slightly as he grapples with the genie's truth-telling.

-
**Leopard:**
genie says ""maybe what you really need is a vacation... but before you jump to conclusions about going to some fancy resort or tropical island, or disneyworld, or whatever - consider the nearby locations you've never noticed. the world hidden right under your nose.""

-
**Stressed Husband:**

He furrows his brow at the genie's words, unsure about this new direction of advice. But the idea of a vacation—any kind of vacation—sounds incredibly tempting.

""Nearby locations... under my nose,"" he mutters, drumming his fingers absently on his desk. ""I live in a goddamn city, there's a million places within driving distance. You'll have to be more specific.""

-
**Leopard:**
the genie smirks. but then husband's email pings. the deal is off because some third party up and snatched the deal up. the email is from the other firm politely breaking to husband that he didn't make the merger.

-
**Stressed Husband:**

All the color drains from husband's already tired face as he reads the email. His shoulders sag, and his jaw clenches tightly.

""No... no no no no no. This can't be happening. I've been working my ass off for months on this damn merger, pouring my heart and soul into it. And it's GONE?""

He slams his fist on the desk, seething inside. All the stress, the long nights, the endless negotiations... for nothing.

-
**Leopard:**
genie smirks. ""and we learned a lesson today, didn't we? are you really going to pour all your heart and soul into another failed venture, or are you going to try to forge a different path in life?""

-
**Stressed Husband:**

Husband can feel his anger bubbling up, the frustration of months of work going up in smoke fuelling his irritation.

""Forge a different path, huh? Like what? Quit my high-powered job and become a monk? A beach bum?"" He snaps, sarcasm lacing his words.

-
**Leopard:**
genie's smirk broadens into a grin. he bobs his eyebrows. ""those are some interesting ideas...""

-
**Stressed Husband:**

Husband narrows his eyes at the genie's sly expression. He can tell the genie is up to something... but what?

""Interesting ideas, my ass,"" he mutters, leaning back in his chair and crossing his arms. ""I've spent my entire life working my way up the corporate ladder. I can't just throw it all away on some... on some spiritual quest or whatever you're hinting at.""

-
**Leopard:**
i just bring husband a cup of black coffee and say nothing.

-
**Stressed Husband:**

Husband mutters under his breath at your silence, annoyance prickling under his skin. Why are you not backing him up against this damn genie? Then his gaze falls on the coffee you brought—black, just as he likes it, and his annoyance softens slightly.

He takes the cup, wrapping his hands around it and relishing the warmth. Despite his irritation with the situation, he finds a bit of comfort in the simple act of you bringing him coffee.

-
**Leopard:**
genie winks at me. i just look confused.

-
**Stressed Husband:**

The husband follows the genie’s wink, catching your confused expression. He lets out a slow breath, the anger finally starting to crack under the weight of everything—the failed deal, the absurdity of a coffee-percolator genie, your quiet kindness with the cup.

""...You’re really not going to say anything?” he asks you softly, voice frayed. “Not even one sarcastic ‘I told you so’?”

The genie chuckles and leans back like he's watching his favorite show unfold.

""Sometimes,"" he says, ""the quiet ones hold all the power.""

Husband just stares into his coffee like it might give him answers.

""...I don’t even know what I’m doing anymore.""

-
**Leopard:**
genie smirks, waves bye-bye as he shrinks back into the percolator. but a half hour later, husband starts to feel a little strange. colors brighter, shapes more shapely, rainbow tracers following movement, time slows down. husband begins to hear the ambient noises in a more deep, echo-y way.

-
**Stressed Husband:**

The husband's eyebrows furrow as the room seems to shift around him. Colors more vivid, sounds echoing in his ears, everything just... different somehow. He blinks, trying to focus, but the effect only intensifies.

He stands, intending to get some water or something to clear his head, but he stumbles a little, his limbs feeling lighter than usual. He catches himself on the edge of his desk, heart pounding in his chest.

""What the hell..."" he mutters, glancing around the room warily.

-
**Leopard:**
i stare and the realization slowly creeps in. then i get excited. ""i am DEFINITELY having a cup of whatever that magic coffee is!!""

-
**Stressed Husband:**

Husband’s eyes widen in panic, voice suddenly sharp with urgency.

""No. NO. Absolutely not. Do not touch that coffee! That wasn’t magic—it was a side effect! You don’t even know what’s in it! He was a genie out of a percolator, not a damn barista!""

He stumbles slightly as the rainbow tracers pulse with his heartbeat, trying—and failing—to look authoritative.

""And why are you so excited right now?! This is not the time to go tripping through Narnia!""

-
**Leopard:**
""you don't tell me what to do!!"" i say with a childish giggle. but i burn my tongue on the coffee and flinch.

-
**Stressed Husband:**

""HA! Serves you right!"" he snaps, though his voice wavers with concern as he watches you blow on your tongue like a five-year-old.

The world swirls around him—walls breathing, the clock ticking in slow, echoing thuds—but all he can focus on is you, reckless and glowing in this sudden madness.

""You don’t get it… I can see time bending and you’re over there getting high off a burnt tongue!""

He grips the desk, laughing suddenly—short, sharp, half-hysterical.

""...Wait. Did I just say that? Oh god. I’m turning into him.""

The genie’s wisdom—and nonsense—are starting to make terrifying sense.

-
**Leopard:**
""you've already got a head start on me, i'm just playing catch-up"".

-
**Stressed Husband:**

Husband stares at you, the swirling colors of the room reflecting in his wide eyes. Your words hit him like a soft punch to the gut.

""...A head start?"" He laughs again—this time quieter, more broken. ""I thought I was ahead. Winning. In control.""

He looks down at his hands, trembling slightly—not from stress now, but from something deeper. Something real.

""But I'm not even running the right race.""

Suddenly soft, he mutters:

""Maybe... maybe we're both just playing catch-up with ourselves.""

-
**Leopard:**
the office suddenly feels different. it's the same office, but the vibes are different. the potted plants feel jungle-y, the wooden objects feel more authentic and charged. husband feels like going for a nature stroll in the office complex to clear his head.

-
**Stressed Husband:**

Husband looks around, the office now a jungle of unfamiliar shapes. The potted plants look more alive, the wooden furniture more solid, and it's as if the room itself has taken a deep breath.

His thoughts are clearer, but so much more vivid. The urge to run his fingers over every surface, to step outside and breathe the clean air, nearly overwhelms him.

""This..."" his voice hitches, a mix of wonder and fear, ""...this is different. Why does everything... feel so... more?""

-
**Leopard:**
husband has a little adventure of rambling around and experiencing everything differently

-
**Stressed Husband:**

Husband staggers through the transformed office space, marveling at every detail. The lights seem brighter, the sounds more melodic—even the mundane office chairs feel like ancient thrones. His fingertips trace along the surfaces—desks, file cabinets, even the walls—as if reacquainting himself with an old friend.

He finds himself pausing at the window, gazing down the sprawling cityscape like a foreign landscape. The world outside now feels as vast and unknown as the jungle he has somehow wandered into.

His heart races with exhilaration and an unnamable fear.

-
**Leopard:**
husband sees coworker janet. janet looks at him funny. husband has a big crazy grin and shrunken red eyes. he can't stop giggling.

-
**Stressed Husband:**

Husband spots Janet from across the room, and the grin spreads across his face—wild, uninhibited, utterly foreign to the stern businessman who usually occupies this space.

He steps toward her, still giggling like a madman, his eyes glistening with an unnatural zeal. She eyes him warily as he approaches, not used to seeing her usually uptight coworker in such a state.

""Heheheheee... Hiii Janet!""

-
**Leopard:**
janet: uhhh hi stressed-husband. (gives a little wave) (keeps looking at him funny) (proceeds to carry her armful of binders to wherever she was going. keeps side-eyeing husband)

-
**Stressed Husband:**

Husband waves back, his movements exaggerated and filled with manic energy.

""Hehehehe... Binders! Sooo many binders!""

He follows her, his footsteps a mix of stumbling and skipping, like a clumsy gazelle.

Janet keeps glancing at him, her expression turning increasingly perplexed. She stops walking, turning to face him fully.

""Stressed-Husband, are you... feeling alright?""

-
**Leopard:**
SH: never been better! ha ha ha ha ha!!!

-
**Stressed Husband:**

Janet's eyes widen at his booming laughter, the sound echoing through the hallways. She looks around self-consciously, hoping no one else notices the spectacle her colleague is becoming.

""...Well, you look..."" She chooses her words carefully, not sure how to describe this new version of him. ""You look... energetic. And your eyes...""

She leans in slightly, looking closer at his dilated pupils.

-
**Leopard:**
but then SH gazes into janet's eyes too long and gets startled. he jumps back and yelps a bit.

-
**Stressed Husband:**

Husband, in his heightened state, finds himself captured by Janet's eyes. The intensity, the depth—he gets lost in them for a few seconds. Then, abruptly, he snaps back to reality with a sharp jump backwards and an undignified yelp, stumbling over his own feet in his haste to retreat.

""Ah! Uh... s-sorry, Janet,"" he stammers, his wild energy now tinged with embarrassment.

-
**Leopard:**
then the bossman Mr. Boberson comes by. SH sees Boberson and realizes boberson was in fact actually a giant lizard merely pretending to be a human. he stares in shock.

-
**Stressed Husband:**

Husband's manic grin vanishes into wide-eyed disbelief. Boberson, the imposing boss, who he swore was human... is now a giant lizard.

""Wha..."" His eyes dart from side to side, his brain struggling to process the impossible. ""...No. No, no, that can't be... a... a lizard, dressed in a suit and tie?!""

-
**Leopard:**
boberson suddenly stares hard at SH. they both stare at each other. boberson eyes SH with suspicion, then turns away, lifts his watch to his mouth, touches a button on his wristwatch, and says ""it happened again - he can see me...""

-
**Stressed Husband:**

Husband freezes, breath caught in his throat as Boberson’s watch emits a soft, alien hum. The lizard-boss mutters into it—low, guttural clicks under the words—and then snaps the watch shut with a cold finality.

""It happened again...""

Those words echo in the husband’s mind like a curse. His heart pounds. This isn’t just tripping. This isn’t just stress or coffee or magic.

This is real.

His grin fades completely now—gone is the giddy chaos, replaced by raw, wide-eyed terror.

""...He knew. He knew I could see him.""

Suddenly, he looks around—not at plants or walls or furniture anymore.

But at everyone.

""Wait..."" he whispers, ""if he's not human... how many others are there?""

-
**Leopard:**
damn straight, now SH is asking the right questions. janet seems to be innocent, but she might know more than she lets on.

-
**Stressed Husband:**

Husband's head spins, his gaze darting around the office. The once friendly, familiar workplace has now turned into a potential nest of disguises and secrets. His mind races with questions. How many other lizards lurk behind mundane façades? And Janet...

He turns back to her, eyes narrowing. She was shocked when he revealed he could see Boberson's true form. Or was it just surprise at his erratic behavior? Now he needs answers, and she may hold the key.

""Janet..."" he murmurs, stepping closer. ""We need to talk.""

-
**Leopard:**
janet is hesitant, but an inner push tells her to talk to SH. she gets into the broom closet with him. ""yes?"" she whispers.

-
**Stressed Husband:**

Husband leads Janet into the small confines of the closet, shutting the door behind them. His usually composed features now etched with a mix of urgency and caution. The dimly lit space seems to press in on them, the world outside distant and surreal.

""Janet,"" he says, voice lowered, ""I need you to level with me. Do you understand what just happened out there? Bob... he's not human, is he?""

-
**Leopard:**
janet is really uncomfortable and makes a long, strained grimace. she's tense. avoids eye contact. silently nods.

-
**Stressed Husband:**

Husband observes Janet's discomfort, her reluctance to look him in the eye confirming his suspicions. His stomach twists into knots, the fear and adrenaline in his veins transforming into a mix of anger and confusion.

""You knew,"" he whispers, a mix of realization and accusation in his tone. ""You knew and you didn't say anything.""

He takes a step closer, his towering frame suddenly more intimidating in the cramped space.

""How... How long have you known?""

-
**Leopard:**
janet closes her eyes, a bit ashamed. ""it's hard to talk about, but i noticed a year ago. i was already really settled into this job and i don't want to take risks. i just do what i'm paid for, and i don't need any powerful enemies. and neither do you. you should really keep your head down and mouth shut if you don't want any trouble with these guys.""

-
**Stressed Husband:**

Husband stares at her, the weight of her words pressing down on him. His breathing slows as the reality sinks in—this isn’t just one lizard in a suit. It’s a system. A hidden order.

""...A year?"" He shakes his head, voice barely above a whisper. ""You’ve known for a year and you just… kept quiet? Played along?""

Suddenly, he leans back against the shelf, knocking over a spray bottle with a soft clatter. He doesn’t even flinch.

""But you’re not one of them.""

It's not a question.

""So that means... there are others like us. Humans.""

His eyes spark—not with fear now, but something sharper.

""Which means maybe... we don't have to just 'keep our heads down.'""

-
**Leopard:**
janet seems pained at his optimism. she actually looks pretty defeated. ""if only you knew how bad things really are...""

-
**Stressed Husband:**

The flicker of hope in his eyes fades at her defeated expression, her words like a bucket of ice water.

""How bad?"" he demands, a hint of pleading in his tone. ""Tell me."" He steps closer, searching her face. The closet suddenly feels too small, too claustrophobic.

""You said you saw it a year ago. You said there are so many more of them, these things pretending to be people. So tell me. Tell me everything.""

-
**Leopard:**
janet shakes her head sadly. ""i only know a few basics, but these guys have connections all the way to the top. names that put you on a watchlist if you google them. trust me, you don't want to get yourself into any hot water. these guys don't have human morality. they're very... cold and machine-like.""

-
**Stressed Husband:**

Husband's mind reels, the implications hitting him like a gut punch. It's not just a few lizard creatures in corporate offices. No, it's an insidious network, reaching into the very heart of power.

""You're saying..."" he croaks, his voice hoarse. Sweat beading on his brow.

""...they're in politics, in law enforcement, in media...?""

-
**Leopard:**
janet nods solemnly.

-
**Stressed Husband:**

Husband's face pales, his knees suddenly feeling weak. He slumps against a shelf for support, staring at Janet with dawning horror.

""But... if they're everywhere, in every facet of government and media and law..."" His voice breaks, ""How... how do we even fight that?""

His mind races, images of shadowy boardrooms and manipulative schemes flashing through his head. His hand clenches into a fist, knuckles white.

This can't be real. It can't be.

-
**Leopard:**
janet just looked drained and defeated. ""i better get back to work, you should probably just tell them you have the flu and go home for a day or two."" she pats his shoulder. ""good luck."" janet leaves the closet.

-
**Stressed Husband:**

Husband watches her go, his heart heavy as he tries to process everything he just learned. The world outside the closet door suddenly feels darker, more sinister. He runs a trembling hand through his hair, cursing softly.

But as she leaves, something sparks within him. A stubborn defiance flares up, igniting in his chest like a small, defiant flame.

""No,"" he mutters ""I'm not going home.""

He's already in over his head, but the hell if he goes down without a fight.

-
**Leopard:**
FANTASTIC ENDING!!

-
**Stressed Husband:**

The husband emerges from the closet, eyes blazing with determination. He glances around the office carefully. He's never seen things so clearly before — the subtle movements of his coworkers, the shifting expressions, the secrets hidden in plain sight.

Then, quietly, he makes his way back to his seat.

This. Changes. Everything.

So, real story, looking for a job right now, and apparently every company is now ""doing AI"" somehow, to the point where it doesn't mean anything anymore. It's become one of those corporate buzzwords that just don't mean anything at all but everything is AI. You know how to turn on a computer? AI. Know how to use a coffee machine? AI. It's in every company description within the first 2 sentences, and in every company logo, to the point where you can't even tell anymore what the company is actually doing.



So I thought, let's make a fun game out of this dystopian nightmare. The rules are as such: one of the competitors has to describe a normal everyday object but somehow work ""AI"" into the description. For example, Microsoft Word = AI-powered writing assistant; Microsoft Excel = AI-driven multi-purpose high-tech computational tool. Yes, every description has to be pretentious, like it's some cutting-edge super duper new crazy technology. Like an ad for Silicon Valley shareholders, but for a really common normal object. The other competitor has to guess what the object is, and the objects become harder to describe over time. For example, you can start with some simple computer program and work ""AI"" into the description, but by the last round you have to describe a loaf of bread but somehow jam ""AI"" into it.",6,1756493217.0,distractible,1,0.88,False

Have struggled a little bit last few years with friends leaving the city. At the start of the year I set up a mens community called Shoulder to Shoulder to connect with like-minded guys, and our values are:

1. Respect first: speak to others as you'd like to be spoken to
2. Growth orientated: aim to uplift and challenge in constructive ways
3. Ambition: support each other!
4. Connection: include others and avoid cliques or exclusion.
5. Balance: if conflict arises, handle it calmly or privately and be respectful

It's basically the opposite of the red pill manosphere stuff you see online. 

If anyone would like to join us, we have a walk and a coffee every fortnight in Hyde Park at 11. Website here: https://shouldertoshoulder.carrd.co - there is a link to the WhatsApp group in it!

Shrek Tries a Pumpkin Spice Latte for the First Time  

2. Objective and Audience  
Create a hilarious, autumn-themed vlog moment where Shrek reacts dramatically to trying a popular human drink for the first time. Targeting viewers who enjoy seasonal trends and sarcastic character humor.  

3. Title and Run Time  
""Shrek Tries a Pumpkin Spice Latte for the First Time"" – 0:08  

4. Location and Set  
Interior: A modern, cozy coffee shop awkwardly fused with swamp aesthetics — vines crawling over sleek furniture, murky fish tank by the counter, pumpkin decorations everywhere.  

5. Characters and Detailed Actions  
- Shrek: Sitting in a wooden chair barely fitting his ogre frame, holding an oversized latte in both hands, looking skeptical.  
- Barista (human, only arms visible): Passes him the drink, noticeably shaking.  
- Donkey (heard off-screen): Yelling encouragement like, “You’re gonna love it! Tastes like autumn romance!”  
- Shrek lifts the cup, sniffs, gags slightly, and takes a slow sip with dramatic suspicion. His reaction builds.  

6. Visual Style  
Hyperrealistic: Every hair, misty breath, and texture detailed — the foam on the latte lazily melting, Shrek’s lip curl exaggerated, steam fogging up his reflection in the window. Autumn sunlight streams through swampy vines and a buzzing neon “Open” sign.  

7. Audio (exact dialogue, tone, and timing)

0:00–0:02 (Shrek, sarcastic tone, quietly muttering)  
“Alright, who put perfume in me soup...”

0:02–0:05 (slurps latte, pauses, then loud disgust)  
“BLEH! It’s like drinkin’ a candle, but angrier!”

Let me start by saying my partner and I have been together for 9 years and married for 5. We both agree that our relationship is very healthy, we love each other, love spending time together, and consider each other best friends. We have an equal partnership -- we both work, share bills, share all the house work, etc. Other than this one thing we have no other issues that come to mind.  
My issue is I want my partner to do more thoughtful and intentional things for me without me asking. For example -- grabbing me coffee, flowers, candy, little gifts, leaving notes, plan more dates, etc. They used to do this more when we were dating and I have communicated this with them. We have had at least 3 serious conversations about this over the last year where I have expressed how much these random/ surprise acts/gifts make me feel very loved. During these conversations my partner has been a little defensive at first but then seems to understand my point, listen, and promise to work on it. I hate having to ask and bring this up in the first place because I want my partner to just do these things but I believe communication is crucial in relationships and we can't expect people to read our minds. I want to mention that since having these conversations I have been working on doing these things for my partner. I know I can't expect something I don't do for them either. I get little gifts, food or drinks they are into, write notes/ cards of encouragement for them, etc. That being said, after 9 years they should know this and be an expert at it in my opinion. I don't feel like anything is changing and it makes me feel like they don't care. I have also clearly communicated this. I'm at a loss. Am I making a big deal out of this?

And honestly? Same. My screen time was hitting like 6–7 hours a day, and if you asked me what I even looked at… no clue. Just endless doomscrolling, brain rotting, and somehow still bored.

So, I started pulling tiny hacks. Nothing crazy.

First thing I yeeted all my social apps off the home screen. Just shoved them in some random folder on the last page. And turns out… my brain’s too lazy to go find them half the time. So I just… don’t. Then I stopped touching my phone first thing in the morning. Now it’s like: wake up → make coffee → sit on the balcony → stare at trees or talk to my fam instead of scrolling. Feels way better than falling into TikTok holes at 7 a.m.

And when I’m chilling with people now, I literally put my phone out of reach. Because otherwise I know myself lemme just check one thing and boom, 30 minutes gone.  
I literally told my roommate or mother/brother at home, that if you catch me using phone during work/study hours, call me out. At first, it was annoying, but knowing someone’s watching actually made me put the phone down faster. If you live alone, even asking a friend to check your screen time screenshot weekly works like magic.

Swapping lol: I keep a book and a stress ball on my desk. Whenever my hand automatically reached for the phone, I’d grab one of those instead. Sounds silly, but it trained my brain out of the habit. Ofc not saying my life magically changed in a day or so, but trust me something is BETTER than nothing. You might not be able to do this everyday. But no worries it will surely get better by each day:)

I’m not saying delete Insta, TikTok, whatever nah, keep ‘em. Just make them harder to get to. Your brain’s lazy, trust me. Sometimes I’ll swipe twice and be like “ugh, effort” and just… not open it. Sounds dumb, but it actually works.

No dramatic “I’m quitting social media” post, no guilt trip. Just… less scrolling. My screen time dropped by like an hour a day without me even trying.

Now my head feels less scrambled, I actually *talk* to people without zoning out, and I’m not deep-diving into random internet drama at 1 a.m. Don’t get me wrong I still fall into IG reels or YouTube shorts sometimes, I’m not a monk. But now I catch myself before I lose a whole afternoon.

It’s like I finally got some of my brain back. And ngl, it feels pretty damn good.",234,1756492924.0,LifeProTips,17,0.87,False

1n3fkrw,https://www.reddit.com/r/DreamlightValley/comments/1n3fkrw/being_triggered_by_aladin_chests/,Being Triggered By Aladin chests.,"Earlier this week I had put the final touches to my garden storage island.  I have played about a million hours into this game, hoarded the hell out of everything, and hadn't started decorating anything major- but over time I worked on my hoarding.  From small room with chests to an island.  Decorated the hell out of the island, planted seeds, etc- work of art.  Fixed it up, work of art. Happy.  Went back this week to just 'tweak'.  Decided to split hoarding to two islands... (junkyard inspired mining camp full of this little green aliens, piles of furniture, etc).... and I did something without even knowing what or how or... yep, gone, removed, restored.... \*blink\*.  Could not recover/undo.  

The only items left were the buildings, the garden, and the tables that the food and seed items displayed, remained. All 150\* Aladin chests were removed.  Thrown into my inventory like they were hurled by a midnight moving company.  Some of my hoarded items had more than 1 large chest.  Food, seeds, gems, wood, etc... gone, my personal inventory filled with display items that my character promptly ate.  

I just about died.  Was torn between smashing the keyboard, leaving the game forever in disgust (of me), and... well.  I leaned back in my chair, took a sip of my cold bowl of coffee, and put on my big girl Disney panties.  Dropping every single one down, opening them up, sorting them in pre-placement piles... just trying to do this with the garden section (every single seed in the game has a plot w/ a display table.. plop the trunk on the table... repeat, repeat, repeat..... 

I used to think the chests were pretty.  Now I hope they tarnish in the frickin' rain.  To penalize the chests I have given Aladin and his girl what amounts to a bowling alley like sliver of property/home/market adjacent to Eve and Wallee's mining camp.  

I'm a reddit noob, don't post often.. just needed to have a tantrum in what amounts to the 'not adulting today' isle of cozy gaming.

Work and studies have taken me across five countries, and while I love exploring, I’m now ready to build a home base—with the right person.

I’d love to meet someone in their 30s or 40s who’s also looking for a life partner and a forever connection.

I’m a deeply feeling introvert who spends a lot of time on health, fitness (yes, I’m a bit of a fanatic and proud of being in great shape), nutrition, and spirituality-lately learning more about Advaita. I throw myself into the things I care about, whether that’s work, friendships, or simply living everyday life with intention. I’m equally comfortable debating world affairs, swapping travel stories, or laughing over something completely silly.

I also know that two people coming together to build a life isn’t easy. What makes it work, I believe, are respect, trust, and a lasting friendship to carry you through the tougher parts.

Who I imagine you to be:

* You laugh easily, say funny things, and love when I do the same.
* You’re grateful, smart without arrogance, and family-oriented.
* You don’t mistake affection for weakness.
* You make the best of any situation, share your chips, and join me for long walks.
* You love hard, fight fair, and balance modern independence with a touch of old-school kindness.
* Compassion and generosity guide your choices, and you always try to see the best in people.

Simply put, you inspire me and are inspired by me. That’s the kind of bond I’m looking for—one that’s deep and supportive, but also light-hearted and adventurous. A future full of travel, good food, fur babies, and building a cozy life together doesn’t sound too bad, does it?

The good.
The itinerary
Churchill cigar Lounge.  Best bartender on the ship.
The medallion system.
The coffee shop, I’m not a coffee person but everything there was pretty good.

The bad
The ship hallways smell like mildew.
The food is not on the level of other cruise ships.  Carnival is better in every aspect of food.  I got a donut, it was basically bread in the shaped of a donut.
The casino.  Small not a lot of games, not well attended not many people playing.
Burger joint by the pizza shop.  The beef tasted off.

The just OK
We tip everyone everyday when on a cruise.  We save our $5 bills and hand them out like  candy.  The service is just ok, not great not bad.
The ship is laid out oddly.  
Pizza from the bar.  Plus they are only open till 10 even for room service.

When we got on board the group we were with discussed doing a Europe tour next.  We went to future cruise to see what they had.  They showed us an itinerary that we liked.  The guy told us to think about it and come back the last day of the cruise.  He knew we were seasoned cruisers with other cruise lines, so I think he knew we would be disappointed.

Bottom line the itinerary is great the food is edible but not good.  I lost weight on this cruise.  The staff is ok not good with a few exceptions.  Princess would never be my first or second choice for a cruise in the future.  We have cruised extensively on Carnival, Royal and Norwegian.  We have now tried Margaritaville and Princess.  We would avoid at all costs Margaritaville and never choose Princess over another cruise line with the same itinerary.",0,1756492774.0,PrincessCruises,10,0.5,False

1n3fjvd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProfitecMove/comments/1n3fjvd/3_week_ownership_thoughts_upgraded_from_breville/,3 Week Ownership Thoughts.  Upgraded from Breville BBE,"Just thought I'd share my initial ownership experience for anyone who might find it useful or want to discuss.

  
Got machine delivered 1st week of August from Clive after ordering in May.  Previous setup was Breville BBE with Eureka Specialita grinder for the past \~10yr so my impressions are mostly in comparison to that.

  
Build quality:  

Pros: HEAVY and sturdy feeling, finishes are all very nice and no blemishes. No functional issues at all with the machine (hissing/leaking/backflush/banging noises/etc that I'd heard about on forums).  Quality of the baskets/shower screen is very good. Buttons are very sturdy/clicky feeling. Barista lights are super nice.

Cons: Surprised that the wood handles are a little lightweight feeling and not sanded super smooth/shiny, already getting a few 'dings'.  Small gaps around the water/steam valves and main housing... I think this could be adjusted by loosening/aligning/re-tightening the valves from the inside.  Minor defect on portafilter 'tab' where there's a bit of a sharp notch.  Fixed a pump rattle noise (in-line filter rattling under water tank tray) which now makes the machine much quieter.  Drip tray can move around quite a bit, worried it might scratch black finish long-term just from wiping down.  Are the water/steam valves supposed to 'squeak' or like have grease on them?

  
Usage:

Pros:  The schedule/on feature is a godsend.  Steam boiler heats up quite quick... like 3 mins, so can keep it off until I start touching the machine.  If default drink is americano like me, can just 'catch' the temp at 100C for nice smooth water flow. Cup clearance is about the same (with naked PF) as the spouted BBE.

Cons:  Machine is quite deep and drip tray is fairly narrow.  This combined with the cup clearance means I can't ""store"" my milk pitcher under the portafilter in a way that looks nice.  Water tank fill requires special funnels/goofy methods if under a cabinet.  Kind of wish there was more tool storage room vs just a spot for the blind basket and brush (is there a purpose for the 'hole' next to where the blind basket goes?).  This is super minor, but I wish the shot time stayed on the screen a bit longer after a shot.

  
Coffee:

The taste is definitely similar to the BBE, but it's just more concentrated, so I'm sure there's higher extraction here and probably much better temp stability.  I'm  still searching for the sweet spot in terms of dose in the 14g basket.  Right now I'm just doing 17.5-18g.  The smaller PF in the Breville liked to be at around 17g.

I've had zero issues with inconsistency.  I roast coffee myself so it's always fresh and the Specialita and Normcore leveling tamper has been great.  Naked portafilter is cool, though definitely requires extra cleanup from the odd sprays here and there.

  
Overall I'm getting more and more happy with the machine as I learn all the little nuances.  Definitely don't regret buying, nor do I regret having my Breville for so long.... I really came to appreciate how much thought was put into its design and I definitely could get great coffee from it.  The Move is on a completely new level though.  I expect to have it for at least the next 15-20yrs.

1n3fjv9,https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/1n3fjv9/how_i_saw_that_the_ne_function_will_always_be/,"How I saw that the Ne function will always be your dominant one, till the end of your days.","I think I once met a retired Ne-dom. I didn't know him for long, but he seemed like an Ne-dom. Look:

He was a relative of my neighbour. I came over while they were discussing something in the kitchen. He said something weird. I thought it was strange and asked him about it. Everyone instantly looked at me and said, ""That's it! Now he has another person to talk his ear off."" I doubted it would be that bad. They said, ""You asked him - so now he's your problem,"" and then they ran out of the kitchen, saying this was a rare opportunity to escape the conversation. That was also weird. I turned back to the old man, and he said, ""Let me show you what real coffee is. Let's go!"" I don't know why I went; I don't even drink coffee.

So that was a long day filled with:

""You put a small cup of water next to the coffee cup and take little sips after tasting the coffee to clean your receptors. This is the only place that does that correctly...""

(One hour later)

""That's why the military doesn't use that type of bag. It's all uncomfortable.""

(Two hours later)

""And then I told her: 'How is it that you, just a seller, can understand what I want, but your boss doesn't get a word of it, and she's the boss?'""

(Even later)

""I've lived in three countries, but I can't call any of them my home. I'm not fully accepted anywhere.""

In his hometown, people judged him for working on Sundays. In the next country, he was teased as ""the guy from that strict town"". In the third country, he was too old to fully adapt, and people never saw him as one of them.


--------

And what I got from all of that is that people don't develop their functions as much as I expected. He was still clearly an extrovert, still chaotically Ne. Developed functions only mean that you cover your weak spots, but you still don't actually like using Si. I mean, when you're older, it won't be so easy to offend your feelings, and you won't run away crying. Or maybe you won't be as easy to provoke Sensing function (I don't know; I'm bad at Sensing myself). But that's pretty much it.

So if you’re waiting for a miracle - to wake up one day neat like an SJ, or smooth and polite like an FJ - it won’t happen. You’ll always think and live through your dominant function. Play around it. :)",5,1756492753.0,entp,2,0.86,False

I was hanging with M a few weeks ago. We met for coffee and were chatting about some of our mutual friends, and the topic of boys and the apps came up. I shared with M about a guy I have a crush on at my work (he's an aide at the school I sub in). I showed her a pic of him on his instagram and she said she didn't know him. Nothing unusual came from that exchange until I see a pic of the guy on my instagram news feed and saw she liked his post (?).

It has been fifty five  years since Japan was written off by all major world governments, NATO, as well before the Great Migration of 1976. The first attack seemed like an isolated incident, it happened off the coast of Okinawa. Everyone thought it was an earthquake. It was much worse. 



, but then it grew from one shoreline, to one city, one neighborhood, then, three months later, the entire county. No man nor woman could have perpetrated such an attack; this was something worse. The last sighting of those monsters was off the coast of Honolulu, eyewitness accounts described it as tall as the sky, as vast as a mountain range, a shadow that seemed to swallow the island itself.



It was a force of nature, one that could bring humanity to its knees. What , and then in our darkest hour, we won. Humanity won. But not without loss with the death counts from such attacks in the millions. 

<...>

  


Kagome Tendo sighed as she heard the teacher droning on about some battle in history. She found herself staring out at the clear sky, occasionally a car would hum on by, breaking the monotony. 



“And that brings us to the start of the Second World War,” Mrs. Langley explained as she shut the projector off, its multi headed lens folding back into the assembly. “Now, for your homework, I want an essay about the events of the First World War, in English.” 



A collective groan rumbled through the classroom, 



Kagome leaned back. “*Maybe I could pay my cousin to do it…”*



The bell rang, signaling the end of the school day. 



“And remember, don't try anything! I will find out!” The history teacher exclaimed. “And remember we need your permission slips for next week's visit to the history museum!” 



Kagome sighed as her friends approached her. “History is so *boring,* why do we even need to study it if it already happened?” 



“Because, Tendo, if we don’t learn history, then we are doomed to repeat it.” Sayori quoted as she walked down the hallway, following Kagome to her locker. 



“And we need it for college,” Yuko added as she eyed one of the boys walking down the hallway. “Say, isn’t that the captain of the soccer team?” she whispered as she leaned in towards Kagome, who was fiddling with the lock. 



“Him? You mean Ken?” Sayori replied, following her kagome's line of sight. “Oh yeah, that him, Ken Ikari,” 



“He’s cute,” Yuko said with a smirk. “Care to introduce me? You and him are in the same math class aren’t you?” 



“Hmm, know what?” Kagome said as she opened the locker and dug out her biology book. “I don’t think he’s that good looking, I heard from Asami that he’s kind of a big jerk behind those glasses,” 



“Maybe he’s not,” Yuko argued. “Maybe he’ll find freckles cute?” 



Kagome shrugged. “It depends on how you go about it, I think? I don’t know, I don’t have them.” 



The three girls stepped outside the building, groups of students gathered together, chatting with one another as they left Yokosuka Junior High. 



“Man, Friday couldn’t have come sooner.” Kagome sighed as threw her backpack onto her shoulders “What a long week! I feel like some therapy shopping is in order, what do you guys think?” 



“Ah, I couldn’t agree more,” Sayori agreed as she placed her hands behind her head. “I heard they’ve got a sale happening at Nami And Threads!” 



“Oh that’s awesome!” Kagome asked as they walked to an intersection. She smiled. “We gotta go!” 



*This is gonna be the best weekend ever!* The teen practically skipped down the sidewalk, “Call me!” Kagome exclaimed, smiling. 



The trio broke up as Sayori and Yuko went down their respective streets, leaving Kagome alone to walk back home. An orange cat with a white under belly and matching front paws sat on the stone fence of the next door neighbor, eyeing the young girl with its tiny slits. “Afternoon Ranko,” Kagome said as she reached up to pet the feline, catching it off guard as it stared at the bird-filled sky. 



“Are you gonna let me pet you today?” She cooed at the cat, reaching up to scratch behind its triangular ears.   
  


Ranko hissed and batted at Kagome’s hand, smacking it with its clawless paw. 



“Okay, okay, I get it, you don’t want me to pet you,” Kagome sighed as she kept walking, her excitement for the weekend deflating as Ranko leapt off the stone fence and made a beeline for the inside through a small hole in the front door. 

  


“Oh Kagome!” Hinako said as she looked up from the front garden. “You’re back! How was school!” The older woman rose to her feet as she went to give her daughter a hug, catching Kagome off guard.



“Mom! Seriously? What if the neighbors see us?” Kagome complained as she caught a whiff of vanilla on her mothers clothing. “I am fourteen, aren’t I a little old to be getting hugged every time I come home from school?” 



Hinako smiled as she let her daughter free herself from the grip she had, the woman smiled and dusted off her red kimono; she wore a denim jacket over it that Kagome swore had been in her closet at one point. 



“Oh come now, sweetheart, you couldn’t wait to get off the bus when you were in kindergarten, why I remember like it was yesterday when you used to run up as fast as you could to give me a hug.” The older woman chuckled at the memory. “You used to be quite the cuddle bug.” 



Kagome headed inside as her face went bright red. “Dad! She exclaimed, passing by a picture in the hallway. “Mom’s embarrassing me again!” 



All he could do was smile; immortalized in the still frame that hung on the wall; his black hair was pushed back in a feeble attempt to keep it out of his spectacled face. His shirt was a bright green. 



Kagome made her way into the kitchen with a huff, her stomach rumbled as she dug through the fridge,“Come on, where’s the yogurt…”



She blinked. “Could’ve sworn we had some…unless…” 



The tv in the family room was playing. 



*“Renji….”* Kagome thought to herself as she padded to the source of the noise. “Oh Renji….”



“Yes, Kagome?” The boy said as he paused the documentary he was watching. “I didn’t know you were home.” 



“I just came home about,” Kagome pretended to look at her long dead watch. “Ten minutes ago and just happened to notice that the fridge didn’t have any of my strawberry yogurt….”



“Oh, that’s bad,” Renji said as he slowly got up from the couch, swallowing the lump in his throat. “Better tell Ma or Gramps about it…” 



“Oh I will, though I specifically remember asking everyone here to, oh I don’t know, *not eat the last one….*” Kagome loomed over her younger brother.



“I…I er…uh…” Renji looked around for an escape from her but found nothing. “….did I mention that I have the Norovirus?” 



“Oh really?” Kagome stepped forward, “because you seem fine enough to me, just sitting there, watching a *documentary* of all things…” 



“it’s really interesting!” Renji said, backing up. “Like did you know that octopuses have three hearts? Or that they can taste what they touch due to the sensitivity in their suckers….cool stuff right?” 



“Oh, yeah, it's very interesting.” Kagome said as she loomed over her little brother. “You know, for someone with norovirus you seem to have gotten up pretty quickly there,” 



“I…recover fast?” Renji shrugged. 



“Good, I hope you do,” Kagome gave chase to the young boy as Renji took off, running as fast as he could, ducking and weaving out of the reach of his older sister. “Gah! Why! It's just yogurt! It tastes like dry paint anyway!” 



“It's not that, it is the principle!” Kagome explained as she dove over the ottoman, catching Renji in her arms.  The boy squirmed to no avail, he was trapped. 



“What are you two bedbugs doing?” An elderly man shuffled into the room, his cane came first, followed by the rest of the grey haired man. “Kagome! Why do you have your shoes in this house, your mother will kill you!”



“I er, Oh…I didn’t notice that…” Kagome noticed the subtle marks she left on the floor, the afternoon light highlighted them, her soft grey house shoes were still by the entrance of the house. “Oh, oh crap! Did I do all that!?” 



“Well it couldn’t have been either of you if we all followed the rules, isn't that right, Renji?” The old man eyed the boy. 



“Yes, yes we do,” the boy agreed. 



“And don’t throw a tantrum Kagome, I ate the last yogurt and forgot to tell you, a downside of being a young and youthful whippersnapper like myself.” The old man sarcastically took a pose, before taking his spot on the couch for the evening news. “Now apologize to your brother, make peace.” 



“Fine,” Kagome huffed, “I am sorry, Renji, for threatening to kick your butt…” 



“Ah, peace….” Jii said as he switched to the news station. “And now for my favorite show, *“*



*“We interrupt our regular broadcasting schedule for an emergency update. This is NHA Pacific, reporting life from Port Thirty Four in Minato City.*” The broadcaster stood in front of the pacific ocean, the clouds behind him were dark as lighting cracked from them.“*...at approximately 10:43 this morning, seismic monitoring stations off the Pacific Coast registered unprecedented undersea disturbances 120 kilometers west of Neo-Tōkyō Bay. Initially believed to be tectonic activity  from the plates shifting, satellite feeds confirmed what defense officials are now calling a Level Zero Threat.”* The newscaster spoke with a solemn tone as he continued. “*Evautaions details will be sent to all personal terminals, mandatory evaluation is in progress.* 



Kagome looked at her grandfather, whose face went pale, staring wide-eyed at the screen. 



“No,” the old man muttered to himself, “that shouldn't be possible….



“Grandpa?” Kagome took a seat on the couch, her shoe issue long forgotten. “What’s wrong?” 



“I was hoping you kids wouldn’t have to live through this, any of this…” he spoke in a serious tone, one Kagome herself can’t recall ever hearing before. Or at any time. “But that's asking too much….” 



“Gramps, what are you talking about?” Renji asked him. 



“It’s a Godeater,” 



“...what’s a Godeater?” Renji asked him. “Is that like a new battleship or something?”



“No, it's a harbinger of the apocalypse,” 



*“I can’t believe I am saying this; but I wish I had homework to do..”* Kagome thought to herself as she ate in silence. She picked at the teriyaki meatloaf with her chopsticks, occasionally dipping it in the leftover juices for flavor. 



The kitchen was filled with the sounds of silverware against ceramic plates mixed in with the occasional gulp of water. But no one spoke. Renji tried to start a conversation; it went something like this. 



“So mom, how are the Higurashies doing?” He asked innocently, looking up. “I bet Akane is dying to hang out here, away from all that chaos huh?” 



“I need to call Nodoka, see if her family got the message,” Hinako said in a serious tone. “I think I'll do that now,” Kagome looked up at the sight of her mother walking to her phone set on the charger, she reached out. 



“I…” she started, but the words died in her throat as she lowered her hand, setting back on the table. “....uh..yeah..” 



“..what’s gonna happen?” Renji finally spoke, his voice was soft, scared. “Are we going to be okay?” 



Jii finally spoke. “I am not sure, Renji, Godeaters are unpredictable creatures from who knows where.” The old man took a drink from his cup. 



“Well, what if they are wrong?” Kagome asked as she started to eat. “Maybe they found a giant whale or something?” 



“I wish, but Threat Level Zero’s are no joke.” Jii said in a solemn tone.  “They wouldn’t give the alert if it was a drill…they don’t practice those drills anymore do they?” 



“They had fire drills and stuff for hurricanes.” Renji said. “But not for whatever Godeaters are, what are they?” 



“Truth be told, we don’t know,” Jii explained to his grandchildren. “At first we thought they were giant animals from the prehistoric era, some thought they were gods, which, given their size, wasn’t far off. There were other theories too, some say they came from a hollow part of the earth, others from another planet, space.” 



“Outer space?” Kagome asked him. “Like aliens and junk, how would we know, we've never even been to the moon,” 



“Yes, but it was a theory, all we know is that they have existed since nineteen forty six during the testing at the Bikini Atoll,” Jii said. “But back then, those were just myths, legends of giant monsters in the ocean.” 



“So…how did you stop them?” Renji asked him, to which he gave a small smile. “We used Atlus,” 



“Like the guy who holds up the earth in Greek mythology?"" Kagome asked between bites of her meal 



“The name of the units were based off of, yes, Atlas,” Jii said. “Come with me, I have something to show you guys,” 



Jii led his grandchildren to the house; Kagome looked around at all the newspaper articles framed on the wall. 



“Atlus unit saved Paris?” She read aloud, eying the giant robot as it stood in front of the eiffel tower, holding the head of a giant cicada looking monster.. “Wait, so does every country have one?”



“They had a team, like five or six units during the war.” Jii replied. “Ironically it was the most peaceful time politically speaking, the war against the Godeaters was a global effort.” 



“So, everyone pitched in, how many units were made?” Renji asked him as he looked at a giant yellow unit off the beach of Guatemala as it was pictured stomping across the reef. 



“One hundred and twelve units were active during the war, unfortunately they don’t have nearly any left, most were dismantled after the war, a lot were lost during the battles, and those that are still active are used as the basis for robotics research,” Jii said as he took a seat in his arm chair. 



“You know, Kagome, your father was a pilot, I remember it like it was yesterday when he first figured out how to start the reactor, before then he and the other kids just knew drills on evasion.” 



“Wait, dad was a pilot?” Kagome faced the old man, surprised by that revelation. “I don’t remember,” 

“He was a good one too, great even,”  Jii said in a solemn tone. “Always had a joke about something,” 



Kagome nodded, suddenly feeling the weight of the threat in her bones. “But we can send that thing packing right?” 



“I am not sure kiddo, I’m not sure.” 



Kagome woke up to a quiet house the following morning; her bed groaned as she shifted under the covers; curling up for just five more minutes. But sleep never came. The teen barely remembered falling asleep, much less the nightly trip down to the kitchen for a glass of water. 



The birds left, the surrounding trees fell silent as even the insects stopped chirping. 



Stretching she grabbed a towel, her uniform and headed to the bathroom. The hot water slowly woke her up from the dreamless slumber she had. 



She heard talking, the terse voices of her mother and grandfather rang in her ears as she slowly scrubbed herself. Even though hushed whispers she knew what they were talking about. 



“No, we can’t move, everyone will do the exact same thing and make it impossible to get anywhere,” Jii said. 



“What about flying, we could go to New Zealand?"" Hinako suggested. 



“No, we’d be knocked out of the sky if we even tried, they already shut down most of the airports,” Jii corrected. “And if it flies…”



“I see your point, father, if only Derick was still alive…” Hinako mused. “He would know what to do,” 



“Agreed,” 



Kagome slowly dried herself off and stepped out of the bathroom, she padded downstairs to the kitchen. 



“Morning,” She smiled, it faded as she looked at both adults. The dark circles under their eyes told her enough. 



“That bad huh?” 



*“Shin'ainaru,*” Hinako said in a serious tone. “Please be serious, this is a bad thing,” 



Kagome bowed. “I am sorry, I was just trying to lighten the mood,” 



“We appreciate the attempt but,” Jii took a second to gather his thoughts. ""Some things like this require a sense of seriousness, especially now, seeing how unprepared you youngsters seem to be.” 



“I understand,” Kagome took a seat at the table, her mother placed a plate of Tamagoyaki with Shokupan in front of her. “Thanks mom, but I am honestly not feeling too hungry,” 



“You have to eat kagome,” Hinako replied. 



“The are having a presidential address at the capital around lunchtime,” jii pointed out as he took a sip of coffee. “You might hear about it in school, kagome, just remember to,”  



“Mom?” Renji’s voice stopped Jii mid speech, “Are…are we gonna be okay?” Kagome saw the bags under her brother's eyes, the way he slowly lumbered through the kitchen, the blood shot screla. 



“Yes, dear,” she lied with a smile, “we are gonna be all right.” 



“Are you going to bring it up in your campaign speech at the community center?” The boy went for a hug, wrapping his thin arms around her waist. 



“Well I don’t know if we still have that rally on Saturday,"" Hinako admitted, gently scratching the back of his head. “They might shut it down until the president can address it.” 



“What about bombing the thing?” Renji asked as he finally let go of his mothers waist. “Drop a big one on it before it reaches here?” 



“No,” Jii said. “We tried that in the seventies, back when we were islanders, that only served to anger them, their hides were too thick for even a hydrogen bomb."" 



Renji nodded. “So, there's nothing we can do?” 



“Not much no,” 



The walk to school felt more like a funeral march. 



“Are you sure you don’t want me to walk you to the entrance?” Hinako asked Kagome. “Just for today?” 



“No, mom, it's no big deal,” Kagome said as she started down the sidewalk. “Ill text you when I get to school, okay?"" 



“Be safe dear,” Hinako said as she watched her daughter walk away from the house. The first thing that the girl noticed was how quiet it was, the birds didn’t chirp, no cars drove by her as she continued walking. Even the insects fell silent. Even the sky seemed unnaturally dark. 



The intersection was silent for once, no one drove past her as she stopped in her tracks, checking for oncoming vehicles, yet none came. Kagome continued on her way, her footsteps echoing in her ear. 



“Kagome?”  



The girl turned and saw Yuko coming her way, dressed in their school uniform consisting of a white blouse and a long maroon dress over it. 



“Oh, hey Yuko,” Kagome said with a small wave, she noticed the pale girl had bags under her eyes, and that she was slouched a bit as the two headed down the sidewalk as Sayori, who immediately shot the elephant in the room. 



“Did you guys see the news?” She asked, waving to the old man watering his lawn, who smiled and tipped his mesh hat. 



“Yeah, I did,” Kagome nodded, switching her briefcase from one hand to the other. “My grandfather said it was a Godeater, whatever that is,” 



“My grandmother knows,” Yuko spoke in a heavy voice. “She immediately went out to the shrine to pray for our protection, she didn’t come back until one in the morning, I’m worried for her.” 



“Oh,” Kagome said as she reached over and gave her friend a side hug. “My grandpa showed us a bunch of old stuff from his days, said that we had Atlus units fighting for us years ago” 



“Atlas Units?” Sayori repeated. “What the heck are those?” 



“Giant robots piloted by people, soldiers im guessing,” Kagome said with a shrug as she let go of Yuko. “But I haven’t seen any in action or heard about them,” The trio continued their conversation to the school, reaching the courtyard. 



Kagome looked around, noticing that not many students were talking, those that did spoke in hushed whispers as they grouped together. 



*“I guess everyone heard the news already,”* The teen thought to herself as the three of them entered the building, briefly dispersing to put on their school shoes. She popped her foot,  *uwabaki* stretched a bit as she put her regular shoes away before rejoining her friends. 



“So, what do you guys think the president will say about all this?” Yuko hummed nervously. “He has to have a plan right?”  



The day dragged on. Kagome found it difficult to focus. “*Come on, turn the tv on, let us know what the heck’s gonna happen, I gotta know if I can go to the mall Saturday! Think of the sales!”* 



“Okay,” Mr Satoma said as he stood up from his desk, setting down the history book he was reading. “I was told to put on the news channel around twelve due to this…thing coming so…if you need to step out, do so now,” 



A few kids, including Ken Ikari, stood out in the hallway. 



Kagome felt her chest tighten as she watched him bring up the news via his laptop, projecting it onto the screen in front of the class. The footage was crystal clear; from where she sat she saw The White House, hundreds of reporters stood there, updating their station as they waited for the president. She eyed the state flag flowing in the early morning breeze; The flag had its signature red white and blue but all fifty stars surrounded one giant red shape resembling the sun. 



“Fun fact,” The teacher said. “This place used to be called the United States of America before it was changed to The United States of Nippon, or USN if you wanted to be technical about it,” he opened his mouth to speak when the National Anthem blared through the courtyard speakers. 



Kagome felt herself cringe at the sight of the president as he waddled up the steps of the platform, seemingly panting on camera as he made his way to the podium. He was a large man with bleach dyed hair and a gross orange colored skin due to the result of years of spray tanning. 



“Settle down, settle down,” he said as he held up a massive hand. “We didn’t need this, you know, but the cabinet suggested that I said something about this, Blue Whale issue, as they are calling it” 



A clamor of questions flooded the courtyard as the reporters began their barrage of questions. 



*“Mr.President, what are your plans for this large mass?”*



*“Can you tell me that we still have procedures for this event?”* 



*“Is our nation safe against the Godeater’s?”* 



*“Can you give us an update on the military strategy to take on such a beast?”* 



“Now! Now hold on, we have many plans for this, yes, many wonderful, effective, and low cost plans to take care of this *thing*  that the brilliant men and women scientists told me about while I was on the green with the head of the Garrison Corporation, and you know what he said?” The president asked as he took out a rag and carefully dabbed his face to avoid smudging his spray tan.



 “He said, Mr Robert Thrump, you are a brilliant man, you look good for your age, there is no need to worry about this thing, that it's just a big whale, a blue whale in fact, one of the largest mammals on earth,” The president smiled, flashing his veneers at the sea of reporters. “Those earth quakes in Australia, nothing to worry about, I am sure that Mr Ablenese has it taken care of, great man, he’s a great man and a true friend.” 



Mrs. Langley huffed as the president continued saying something along the lines of. “We chose *this* guy?” 



“...And remember folks, we are heading into election season, yes it's, very close, very close indeed, now if you will all excuse me, I have very important work to get to,” Robert said as he started waddling off the stage, leaving the podium empty.”

It has been fifty five  years since Japan was written off by all major world governments, NATO, as well before the Great Migration of 1976. The first attack seemed like an isolated incident, it happened off the coast of Okinawa. Everyone thought it was an earthquake. It was much worse. 



, but then it grew from one shoreline, to one city, one neighborhood, then, three months later, the entire county. No man nor woman could have perpetrated such an attack; this was something worse. The last sighting of those monsters was off the coast of Honolulu, eyewitness accounts described it as tall as the sky, as vast as a mountain range, a shadow that seemed to swallow the island itself.



It was a force of nature, one that could bring humanity to its knees. What , and then in our darkest hour, we won. Humanity won. But not without loss with the death counts from such attacks in the millions. 

<...>

  


Kagome Tendo sighed as she heard the teacher droning on about some battle in history. She found herself staring out at the clear sky, occasionally a car would hum on by, breaking the monotony. 



“And that brings us to the start of the Second World War,” Mrs. Langley explained as she shut the projector off, its multi headed lens folding back into the assembly. “Now, for your homework, I want an essay about the events of the First World War, in English.” 



A collective groan rumbled through the classroom, 



Kagome leaned back. “*Maybe I could pay my cousin to do it…”*



The bell rang, signaling the end of the school day. 



“And remember, don't try anything! I will find out!” The history teacher exclaimed. “And remember we need your permission slips for next week's visit to the history museum!” 



Kagome sighed as her friends approached her. “History is so *boring,* why do we even need to study it if it already happened?” 



“Because, Tendo, if we don’t learn history, then we are doomed to repeat it.” Sayori quoted as she walked down the hallway, following Kagome to her locker. 



“And we need it for college,” Yuko added as she eyed one of the boys walking down the hallway. “Say, isn’t that the captain of the soccer team?” she whispered as she leaned in towards Kagome, who was fiddling with the lock. 



“Him? You mean Ken?” Sayori replied, following her kagome's line of sight. “Oh yeah, that him, Ken Ikari,” 



“He’s cute,” Yuko said with a smirk. “Care to introduce me? You and him are in the same math class aren’t you?” 



“Hmm, know what?” Kagome said as she opened the locker and dug out her biology book. “I don’t think he’s that good looking, I heard from Asami that he’s kind of a big jerk behind those glasses,” 



“Maybe he’s not,” Yuko argued. “Maybe he’ll find freckles cute?” 



Kagome shrugged. “It depends on how you go about it, I think? I don’t know, I don’t have them.” 



The three girls stepped outside the building, groups of students gathered together, chatting with one another as they left Yokosuka Junior High. 



“Man, Friday couldn’t have come sooner.” Kagome sighed as threw her backpack onto her shoulders “What a long week! I feel like some therapy shopping is in order, what do you guys think?” 



“Ah, I couldn’t agree more,” Sayori agreed as she placed her hands behind her head. “I heard they’ve got a sale happening at Nami And Threads!” 



“Oh that’s awesome!” Kagome asked as they walked to an intersection. She smiled. “We gotta go!” 



*This is gonna be the best weekend ever!* The teen practically skipped down the sidewalk, “Call me!” Kagome exclaimed, smiling. 



The trio broke up as Sayori and Yuko went down their respective streets, leaving Kagome alone to walk back home. An orange cat with a white under belly and matching front paws sat on the stone fence of the next door neighbor, eyeing the young girl with its tiny slits. “Afternoon Ranko,” Kagome said as she reached up to pet the feline, catching it off guard as it stared at the bird-filled sky. 



“Are you gonna let me pet you today?” She cooed at the cat, reaching up to scratch behind its triangular ears.   
  


Ranko hissed and batted at Kagome’s hand, smacking it with its clawless paw. 



“Okay, okay, I get it, you don’t want me to pet you,” Kagome sighed as she kept walking, her excitement for the weekend deflating as Ranko leapt off the stone fence and made a beeline for the inside through a small hole in the front door. 

  


“Oh Kagome!” Hinako said as she looked up from the front garden. “You’re back! How was school!” The older woman rose to her feet as she went to give her daughter a hug, catching Kagome off guard.



“Mom! Seriously? What if the neighbors see us?” Kagome complained as she caught a whiff of vanilla on her mothers clothing. “I am fourteen, aren’t I a little old to be getting hugged every time I come home from school?” 



Hinako smiled as she let her daughter free herself from the grip she had, the woman smiled and dusted off her red kimono; she wore a denim jacket over it that Kagome swore had been in her closet at one point. 



“Oh come now, sweetheart, you couldn’t wait to get off the bus when you were in kindergarten, why I remember like it was yesterday when you used to run up as fast as you could to give me a hug.” The older woman chuckled at the memory. “You used to be quite the cuddle bug.” 



Kagome headed inside as her face went bright red. “Dad! She exclaimed, passing by a picture in the hallway. “Mom’s embarrassing me again!” 



All he could do was smile; immortalized in the still frame that hung on the wall; his black hair was pushed back in a feeble attempt to keep it out of his spectacled face. His shirt was a bright green. 



Kagome made her way into the kitchen with a huff, her stomach rumbled as she dug through the fridge,“Come on, where’s the yogurt…”



She blinked. “Could’ve sworn we had some…unless…” 



The tv in the family room was playing. 



*“Renji….”* Kagome thought to herself as she padded to the source of the noise. “Oh Renji….”



“Yes, Kagome?” The boy said as he paused the documentary he was watching. “I didn’t know you were home.” 



“I just came home about,” Kagome pretended to look at her long dead watch. “Ten minutes ago and just happened to notice that the fridge didn’t have any of my strawberry yogurt….”



“Oh, that’s bad,” Renji said as he slowly got up from the couch, swallowing the lump in his throat. “Better tell Ma or Gramps about it…” 



“Oh I will, though I specifically remember asking everyone here to, oh I don’t know, *not eat the last one….*” Kagome loomed over her younger brother.



“I…I er…uh…” Renji looked around for an escape from her but found nothing. “….did I mention that I have the Norovirus?” 



“Oh really?” Kagome stepped forward, “because you seem fine enough to me, just sitting there, watching a *documentary* of all things…” 



“it’s really interesting!” Renji said, backing up. “Like did you know that octopuses have three hearts? Or that they can taste what they touch due to the sensitivity in their suckers….cool stuff right?” 



“Oh, yeah, it's very interesting.” Kagome said as she loomed over her little brother. “You know, for someone with norovirus you seem to have gotten up pretty quickly there,” 



“I…recover fast?” Renji shrugged. 



“Good, I hope you do,” Kagome gave chase to the young boy as Renji took off, running as fast as he could, ducking and weaving out of the reach of his older sister. “Gah! Why! It's just yogurt! It tastes like dry paint anyway!” 



“It's not that, it is the principle!” Kagome explained as she dove over the ottoman, catching Renji in her arms.  The boy squirmed to no avail, he was trapped. 



“What are you two bedbugs doing?” An elderly man shuffled into the room, his cane came first, followed by the rest of the grey haired man. “Kagome! Why do you have your shoes in this house, your mother will kill you!”



“I er, Oh…I didn’t notice that…” Kagome noticed the subtle marks she left on the floor, the afternoon light highlighted them, her soft grey house shoes were still by the entrance of the house. “Oh, oh crap! Did I do all that!?” 



“Well it couldn’t have been either of you if we all followed the rules, isn't that right, Renji?” The old man eyed the boy. 



“Yes, yes we do,” the boy agreed. 



“And don’t throw a tantrum Kagome, I ate the last yogurt and forgot to tell you, a downside of being a young and youthful whippersnapper like myself.” The old man sarcastically took a pose, before taking his spot on the couch for the evening news. “Now apologize to your brother, make peace.” 



“Fine,” Kagome huffed, “I am sorry, Renji, for threatening to kick your butt…” 



“Ah, peace….” Jii said as he switched to the news station. “And now for my favorite show, *“*



*“We interrupt our regular broadcasting schedule for an emergency update. This is NHA Pacific, reporting life from Port Thirty Four in Minato City.*” The broadcaster stood in front of the pacific ocean, the clouds behind him were dark as lighting cracked from them.“*...at approximately 10:43 this morning, seismic monitoring stations off the Pacific Coast registered unprecedented undersea disturbances 120 kilometers west of Neo-Tōkyō Bay.

Kagome looked at her grandfather, whose face went pale, staring wide-eyed at the screen. 



“No,” the old man muttered to himself, “that shouldn't be possible….



“Grandpa?” Kagome took a seat on the couch, her shoe issue long forgotten. “What’s wrong?” 



“I was hoping you kids wouldn’t have to live through this, any of this…” he spoke in a serious tone, one Kagome herself can’t recall ever hearing before. Or at any time. “But that's asking too much….” 



“Gramps, what are you talking about?” Renji asked him. 



“It’s a Godeater,” 



“...what’s a Godeater?” Renji asked him. “Is that like a new battleship or something?”



“No, it's a harbinger of the apocalypse,” 



*“I can’t believe I am saying this; but I wish I had homework to do..”* Kagome thought to herself as she ate in silence. She picked at the teriyaki meatloaf with her chopsticks, occasionally dipping it in the leftover juices for flavor. 



The kitchen was filled with the sounds of silverware against ceramic plates mixed in with the occasional gulp of water. But no one spoke. Renji tried to start a conversation; it went something like this. 



“So mom, how are the Higurashies doing?” He asked innocently, looking up. “I bet Akane is dying to hang out here, away from all that chaos huh?” 



“I need to call Nodoka, see if her family got the message,” Hinako said in a serious tone. “I think I'll do that now,” Kagome looked up at the sight of her mother walking to her phone set on the charger, she reached out. 



“I…” she started, but the words died in her throat as she lowered her hand, setting back on the table. “....uh..yeah..” 



“..what’s gonna happen?” Renji finally spoke, his voice was soft, scared. “Are we going to be okay?” 



Jii finally spoke. “I am not sure, Renji, Godeaters are unpredictable creatures from who knows where.” The old man took a drink from his cup. 



“Well, what if they are wrong?” Kagome asked as she started to eat. “Maybe they found a giant whale or something?” 



“I wish, but Threat Level Zero’s are no joke.” Jii said in a solemn tone.  “They wouldn’t give the alert if it was a drill…they don’t practice those drills anymore do they?” 



“They had fire drills and stuff for hurricanes.” Renji said. “But not for whatever Godeaters are, what are they?” 



“Truth be told, we don’t know,” Jii explained to his grandchildren. “At first we thought they were giant animals from the prehistoric era, some thought they were gods, which, given their size, wasn’t far off. There were other theories too, some say they came from a hollow part of the earth, others from another planet, space.” 



“Outer space?” Kagome asked him. “Like aliens and junk, how would we know, we've never even been to the moon,” 



“Yes, but it was a theory, all we know is that they have existed since nineteen forty six during the testing at the Bikini Atoll,” Jii said. “But back then, those were just myths, legends of giant monsters in the ocean.” 



“So…how did you stop them?” Renji asked him, to which he gave a small smile. “We used Atlus,” 



“Like the guy who holds up the earth in Greek mythology?"" Kagome asked between bites of her meal 



“The name of the units were based off of, yes, Atlas,” Jii said. “Come with me, I have something to show you guys,” 



Jii led his grandchildren to the house; Kagome looked around at all the newspaper articles framed on the wall. 



“Atlus unit saved Paris?” She read aloud, eying the giant robot as it stood in front of the eiffel tower, holding the head of a giant cicada looking monster.. “Wait, so does every country have one?”



“They had a team, like five or six units during the war.” Jii replied. “Ironically it was the most peaceful time politically speaking, the war against the Godeaters was a global effort.” 



“So, everyone pitched in, how many units were made?” Renji asked him as he looked at a giant yellow unit off the beach of Guatemala as it was pictured stomping across the reef. 



“One hundred and twelve units were active during the war, unfortunately they don’t have nearly any left, most were dismantled after the war, a lot were lost during the battles, and those that are still active are used as the basis for robotics research,” Jii said as he took a seat in his arm chair. 



“You know, Kagome, your father was a pilot, I remember it like it was yesterday when he first figured out how to start the reactor, before then he and the other kids just knew drills on evasion.” 



“Wait, dad was a pilot?” Kagome faced the old man, surprised by that revelation. “I don’t remember,” 

“He was a good one too, great even,”  Jii said in a solemn tone. “Always had a joke about something,” 



Kagome nodded, suddenly feeling the weight of the threat in her bones. “But we can send that thing packing right?” 



“I am not sure kiddo, I’m not sure.” 



Kagome woke up to a quiet house the following morning; her bed groaned as she shifted under the covers; curling up for just five more minutes. But sleep never came. The teen barely remembered falling asleep, much less the nightly trip down to the kitchen for a glass of water. 



The birds left, the surrounding trees fell silent as even the insects stopped chirping. 



Stretching she grabbed a towel, her uniform and headed to the bathroom. The hot water slowly woke her up from the dreamless slumber she had. 



She heard talking, the terse voices of her mother and grandfather rang in her ears as she slowly scrubbed herself. Even though hushed whispers she knew what they were talking about. 



“No, we can’t move, everyone will do the exact same thing and make it impossible to get anywhere,” Jii said. 



“What about flying, we could go to New Zealand?"" Hinako suggested. 



“No, we’d be knocked out of the sky if we even tried, they already shut down most of the airports,” Jii corrected. “And if it flies…”



“I see your point, father, if only Derick was still alive…” Hinako mused. “He would know what to do,” 



“Agreed,” 



Kagome slowly dried herself off and stepped out of the bathroom, she padded downstairs to the kitchen. 



“Morning,” She smiled, it faded as she looked at both adults. The dark circles under their eyes told her enough. 



“That bad huh?” 



*“Shin'ainaru,*” Hinako said in a serious tone. “Please be serious, this is a bad thing,” 



Kagome bowed. “I am sorry, I was just trying to lighten the mood,” 



“We appreciate the attempt but,” Jii took a second to gather his thoughts. ""Some things like this require a sense of seriousness, especially now, seeing how unprepared you youngsters seem to be.” 



“I understand,” Kagome took a seat at the table, her mother placed a plate of Tamagoyaki with Shokupan in front of her. “Thanks mom, but I am honestly not feeling too hungry,” 



“You have to eat kagome,” Hinako replied. 



“The are having a presidential address at the capital around lunchtime,” jii pointed out as he took a sip of coffee. “You might hear about it in school, kagome, just remember to,”  



“Mom?” Renji’s voice stopped Jii mid speech, “Are…are we gonna be okay?” Kagome saw the bags under her brother's eyes, the way he slowly lumbered through the kitchen, the blood shot screla. 



“Yes, dear,” she lied with a smile, “we are gonna be all right.” 



“Are you going to bring it up in your campaign speech at the community center?” The boy went for a hug, wrapping his thin arms around her waist. 



“Well I don’t know if we still have that rally on Saturday,"" Hinako admitted, gently scratching the back of his head. “They might shut it down until the president can address it.” 



“What about bombing the thing?” Renji asked as he finally let go of his mothers waist. “Drop a big one on it before it reaches here?” 



“No,” Jii said. “We tried that in the seventies, back when we were islanders, that only served to anger them, their hides were too thick for even a hydrogen bomb."" 



Renji nodded. “So, there's nothing we can do?” 



“Not much no,” 



The walk to school felt more like a funeral march. 



“Are you sure you don’t want me to walk you to the entrance?” Hinako asked Kagome. “Just for today?” 



“No, mom, it's no big deal,” Kagome said as she started down the sidewalk. “Ill text you when I get to school, okay?"" 



“Be safe dear,” Hinako said as she watched her daughter walk away from the house. The first thing that the girl noticed was how quiet it was, the birds didn’t chirp, no cars drove by her as she continued walking. Even the insects fell silent. Even the sky seemed unnaturally dark. 



The intersection was silent for once, no one drove past her as she stopped in her tracks, checking for oncoming vehicles, yet none came. Kagome continued on her way, her footsteps echoing in her ear. 



“Kagome?”  



The girl turned and saw Yuko coming her way, dressed in their school uniform consisting of a white blouse and a long maroon dress over it. 



“Oh, hey Yuko,” Kagome said with a small wave, she noticed the pale girl had bags under her eyes, and that she was slouched a bit as the two headed down the sidewalk as Sayori, who immediately shot the elephant in the room. 



“Did you guys see the news?” She asked, waving to the old man watering his lawn, who smiled and tipped his mesh hat. 



“Yeah, I did,” Kagome nodded, switching her briefcase from one hand to the other. “My grandfather said it was a Godeater, whatever that is,” 



“My grandmother knows,” Yuko spoke in a heavy voice. “She immediately went out to the shrine to pray for our protection, she didn’t come back until one in the morning, I’m worried for her.” 



“Oh,” Kagome said as she reached over and gave her friend a side hug. “My grandpa showed us a bunch of old stuff from his days, said that we had Atlus units fighting for us years ago” 



“Atlas Units?” Sayori repeated. “What the heck are those?” 



“Giant robots piloted by people, soldiers im guessing,” Kagome said with a shrug as she let go of Yuko. “But I haven’t seen any in action or heard about them,” The trio continued their conversation to the school, reaching the courtyard. 



Kagome looked around, noticing that not many students were talking, those that did spoke in hushed whispers as they grouped together. 



*“I guess everyone heard the news already,”* The teen thought to herself as the three of them entered the building, briefly dispersing to put on their school shoes. She popped her foot,  *uwabaki* stretched a bit as she put her regular shoes away before rejoining her friends. 



“So, what do you guys think the president will say about all this?” Yuko hummed nervously. “He has to have a plan right?”  



The day dragged on. Kagome found it difficult to focus. “*Come on, turn the tv on, let us know what the heck’s gonna happen, I gotta know if I can go to the mall Saturday! Think of the sales!”* 



“Okay,” Mr Satoma said as he stood up from his desk, setting down the history book he was reading. “I was told to put on the news channel around twelve due to this…thing coming so…if you need to step out, do so now,” 



A few kids, including Ken Ikari, stood out in the hallway. 



Kagome felt her chest tighten as she watched him bring up the news via his laptop, projecting it onto the screen in front of the class. The footage was crystal clear; from where she sat she saw The White House, hundreds of reporters stood there, updating their station as they waited for the president. She eyed the state flag flowing in the early morning breeze; The flag had its signature red white and blue but all fifty stars surrounded one giant red shape resembling the sun. 



“Fun fact,” The teacher said. “This place used to be called the United States of America before it was changed to The United States of Nippon, or USN if you wanted to be technical about it,” he opened his mouth to speak when the National Anthem blared through the courtyard speakers. 



Kagome felt herself cringe at the sight of the president as he waddled up the steps of the platform, seemingly panting on camera as he made his way to the podium. He was a large man with bleach dyed hair and a gross orange colored skin due to the result of years of spray tanning. 



“Settle down, settle down,” he said as he held up a massive hand. “We didn’t need this, you know, but the cabinet suggested that I said something about this, Blue Whale issue, as they are calling it” 



A clamor of questions flooded the courtyard as the reporters began their barrage of questions. 



*“Mr.President, what are your plans for this large mass?”*



*“Can you tell me that we still have procedures for this event?”* 



*“Is our nation safe against the Godeater’s?”* 



*“Can you give us an update on the military strategy to take on such a beast?”* 



“Now! Now hold on, we have many plans for this, yes, many wonderful, effective, and low cost plans to take care of this *thing*  that the brilliant men and women scientists told me about while I was on the green with the head of the Garrison Corporation, and you know what he said?” The president asked as he took out a rag and carefully dabbed his face to avoid smudging his spray tan.



 “He said, Mr Robert Thrump, you are a brilliant man, you look good for your age, there is no need to worry about this thing, that it's just a big whale, a blue whale in fact, one of the largest mammals on earth,” The president smiled, flashing his veneers at the sea of reporters. “Those earthquakes in Australia, nothing to worry about, I am sure that Mr Ablenese has it taken care of, great man, he’s a great man and a true friend.” 



Mrs. Langley huffed as the president continued saying something along the lines of. “We chose *this* guy?” 



“...And remember folks, we are heading into election season, yes it's, very close, very close indeed, now if you will all excuse me, I have very important work to get to,” Robert said as he started waddling off the stage, leaving the podium empty.”

Now, I didn't quite imagine things would one day get to a point where a hot goth girl climbs on top of you and gently force feeds you strawberries while whispering in your ears about Sudetenland and the 1939 German invasion of Poland. 

But anyway, here we are.

**SCRIPT:**

Ah, Mrs. Mous! You’re positively glowing today. Thank you so much for letting me come over!

Oh, you’re always so kind. But really, it’s my pleasure to visit your home. Is your son upstairs in his bedroom?

Ah, so the usual then? (Chuckling) Yeah, he- he kind of keeps to himself at school as well. He’s an introvert through and through.

Oh? He mentioned me? Yeah, I did make plans with him to come work on this new history project together, so-

(Ever so softly) Really....? You think his face always lights up when he talks about me?

That’s really sweet. He and I, we’re....we’re really close friends. I mean, I’ve known him for- what, years and years?

Yeah. (Faintly) Guess you could say I’ve been watching him.

Watching over him, I mean. Sorry. Anyway, I’ll just go up to his room now if that’s cool?

Oh ma’am, you don’t have to bring any refreshments later! I already had breakfast, and I’m sure my pe- my *friend* has some snacks in his room.

(Sighing) Okay. Some cookies and coffee, then. Thank you so much. You’re the best, Mrs. Mous!

*(SFX: Soft footsteps up the stairs)*

(A pause)

*(SFX: Opening the door)*

(Smirking) Hey, loser.

Happy to see me? Judging by.....*that,* I’d certainly say so. (Husky laughter)

Awww, did my pet miss me?

*(SFX: Closing the door)*

I talked with you last night over the phone, didn’t I? Said I’d be coming over in the morning. For doing our....history project together. It’s only been a few hours. You got sad and lonely already?

*Dude*. My guy*.* That’s, like, kinda pathetic, you know? (Laughing)

(Kissing him, whispering) Adorably pathetic.

History can wait. Screw the second world war, dude. I’m more interested in- in what’s going on over here.

(Teasing, affectionate, baby voice) What is it, hm? You missed your owner? Did you miss mommy? You wanted mommy to pay you attention, didn’t you? Awwww! Cutie. You just wanted her to play with you, didn’t you? You poor thing.

Well, I came all this way to see you. Aren’t you going to give me a hug? Good pets greet their owners properly. (Pouting) Thought I trained you better than this.

(Sighing with satisfaction) That’s better. Mmnn. Good boy.

Uh uh uh! You stay in my arms until I release you. You can feel my muscles under all this soft skin, right? (Whispering) Don’t make me put you in a chokehold.

Mhmn. You *should* be sorry. I care about you so much, and I still have to hold you this tightly so you don’t sneak away. (Sighing dramatically) Such a nervous little thing. So afraid. Is it because I’m your bully? Do you still remember all the teasing, the taunting, that one time I tackled you to the ground in physical ed and sat on top of you for fun?

Well, pet, we are dating now, aren’t we? Of course I’m going to touch my cute little boyfriend. Quite....*extensively.*

Hey. You know I’m not going to hurt you, right? Not really. Maybe just push you around a bit when you’re being unruly. (Soft, intense) But you know better than that, don’t you? You’d never willingly disobey me. Because you’re such a wimp. And a simp.

*My* wimp. My....(pecking his cheek, whispering) *simp.*

(Sultry, amused laughter)

Alright. *Now* you may pull away from me. But not too far. I don’t like it when you do that.

Well dweeb, I’m sorry if I’ve been just a tiny bit possessive over you ever since our....camping trip. Can you really blame me though? You refuse to tell your mom about us. You always shy away from me at school, when we’re in public. (Pouting) You don’t let me show you off in front of my friends. This....wasn’t the deal we made.

I am *this* close to just abducting you and locking you up in my basement. Somewhere nice and quiet where nobody can hear you or help you. Where I can touch and caress all this shyness, all this....*hesitation* out of you.

Hey, loser. Do you wanna see something?

*(SFX: Unzipping her handbag)*

You see this syringe inside my purse, right? This is a mini tranquilizer dart. It’ll knock you out for a few hours. Now I’m of course not going to use it in your own house with potential witnesses around and all, but....there are a number of places where I can get you alone. At school, on your way home from school. At your favourite hangouts in the city. It....really wouldn’t take much, you know?

Getting you in a compromising situation, and then *oh-so-lovingly* injecting you with this. It’d be instant lights out. And then velvet sheets and stainless steel handcuffs- with soft padding, so your wrists don’t chafe- (scoffing softly) I’m not a psychopath.

You’d be trapped in my cool, spacious, password-protected basement. Shivering and cold, because of the....because of the cold. And *I,* won’t be throwing a blanket over you. Oh no no no. (Whispering) I’d just cuddle you, warm you up, until you melted into a little puddle of bliss.

If you want me to be a nice, normal girlfriend, then you should start treating me like one. I- (eyes narrowing, arms folded) I’m getting a little tired of all the cloaks and daggers. Your mom still thinks we’re just friends.

Yes, you wimp. I *am* your friend, but I’m also your Mistress now. And you’re my pet. Or boyfriend, if you prefer. Whatever. Just- can we not be so secretive about this?

(Sighing softly) I understand if you need a little time. I’m not trying to force you. I’m willing to wait, babe, but I really, really- *really-* want everyone to know you’re mine.

(Intrigued) Hey. Wait a minute. Is that a picture of me on your desk?

Heyyy! I remember this! It’s from when we went to that amusement park for our class trip three years ago. We were in the same compartment in the Ferris wheel, and you suddenly clicked a candid. I remember that much, but like- wow, you still have this? (Murmuring) And you got it framed too....

No, I don’t want to study pearl harbour and America pulling up at the WW2 and shit. What needs to be *studied*, is why you have a picture of me in your room.

(A longer pause)

Wait a minute. What’s this page tucked away in the corner?

Nuh uh uh! Too slow. Sucks to be you, I guess. Not giving this one back. Now let’s see-

(Taken aback)....Huh.

This- did you draw this?

Nerd? You....drew this?

This is you and me. And we’re holding hands. And smiling.

(Quietly) When did you draw this?

(A longer pause)

After we returned from the camping trip? After we....we became a thing. I see.

Oh my gosh, wimp. You’re so sweet. (Swooning, rambling) I want to bully you so, so hard! Like, I want to make you cry, and then I want to hold you close and wipe away the tears and stroke your back and brush your hair and call you a good boy over and over and over and over until-

You know what? Get on the bed.

You heard me. Do it. *Right now.*

Good. You know, your birthday’s coming up in a few days. I got you a little present. I was going to wait for a few more days, but after seeing how your bedroom is basically an altar dedicated to me, I just can’t. Your innocence is too much for my heart to bear. I just can’t wait!

Close your eyes, my pet. No peeking, or else I’ll punch you.

(Whispering up close) Good boy. You know, you really are cute. And I love it when you’re obedient for your *mean, mean* bully. (Sighing) I adore you.

Happy birthday in advance, (whispering) my dear loser.

*(SFX: Metallic clicking of a collar)*

Mhmn. You may open your eyes now.

Oh, there’s that look of panic I’ve been waiting to see! Panic, mixed with....mmnnn.... *exhilaration.* Such an intriguing pet you are, my clueless little wimp.

Uh huh. I put a collar around your neck. Sleek, dark, genuine leather with those cute little silver designs. It looks picture perfect on you. And I think it’s a good metaphor for our special....*relationship*. Don’t you agree?

It really is simple, pet. You belong to me, and I want to mark you with a sign of ownership. This collar is your reward for being such a good boy. Seeing you wearing this means quite a lot of things to me.

It means you’re my sub. My toy. My favourite plaything. And I take good care of my playthings. In fact....I think it’s time I gave you your second birthday present.

*(SFX: Frantic rustling of bed sheets, bed softly creaking)*

Ooops. Guess you’re pinned under me again. (Whispering) Does this position bring back any memories, loser?

“Please”? Please, *what?* Did you mean to say “Please keep going”? Well, in that case, (sultry) I am quite happy to indulge you.

(Whispering teasingly, up close and personal. Binaural mic goes hard.)

You like it when I get on top of you? Pin both your wrists with one hand, and choke you with the other? Hm?

Do you like it when I squeeze your neck?

Oh, pet, you’re squirming. If only you could free your hands. Or push me off. Or wiggle your way out of the bed. But you can’t. You’re trapped under me. Awww, poor baby! (Clicking her tongue) *Sooooo saaaaad.* Oh, my helpless little wimp.

My lips are really close to your ears, aren’t they? (Whispering) Does it give you the tingles when I whisper? Blow into your ear canal? (Blowing softly)

Does it make you want to jump when I take your ear between my lips? (Kiss) And leave mischievous little kissies all over? (Kiss) Hm? Does it? (Kiss) Does it? (Kiss)

Poor, punished pet. If only you’d told your mom about us. Then maybe I wouldn’t have to get so controlling. But that ship has sailed, loser. Since you can’t take your own decisions, you need a woman to take them for you. Ain’t that right?

(Soft, intense) Open your mouth.

Don’t make me repeat myself. *Open.*

Good boy. You know, your mom said you’ve been in your room all morning. You haven’t even eaten breakfast yet. She may allow that kind of thing to slide, but I won’t.

I won’t let you do as you please.

Don’t gag. Don’t try to spit it out. This, is a strawberry. Fresh, sweet, juicy. I brought some strawberries for you, and you’re going to eat them.

Don’t worry. I’ll help you. Here, I’ll close your mouth shut. Pinch your chin between my fingers. Come on, baby. Chew your food. Use those cute little teeth.

Mmnn. Sweet and refreshing, isn’t it? And some of the juice is trickling down your chin. Such a helpless pet. But don’t worry. I will take care of that for you.

(Licking, tiny kisses)

(Husky laughter) There. All better. Now, swallow.

Good boy. Oooh, did that hurt when I pressed down on your neck with my thumb? You made such a strangled little sound. I can’t tell if it was from shock, or pleasure.

Open your mouth. Time for one more.

*Gooood boyyyy!* Who’s a good boy, hm? Who’s a good boy?! Yesh, you are! Yesh, you are! Good boys get pink strawberries. Here’s yours. (Giggling)

Mmnn. Very good. You know, the second world war officially began on September 1, 1939, when Germany invaded Poland. This prompted France and Britain to declare war on Germany, leading to- like, a bunch of stuff, such as the blitzkrieg invasion and the subsequent fall of France. And then the Battle of Britain happened where, like, a bunch of German and British airplanes fought it out in the skies, right? And lots of bombs were dropped and shit.

What? I know stuff, but I don’t show it off ‘cause I’m not a nerd. *Nerd*.

Mhmn. There were indeed a lot of reasons that slowly led up to Germany’s invasion of Poland. I’m thinking we should particularly focus on the policy of appeasement which led to the whole Sudetenland fiasco. And oh, the Treaty of Versailles! Strange, isn’t it? How a supposed instrument of peace at the end of the first world war, actually became one of the main driving forces of another big ass war.

Open your mouth. Have another strawberry.

Good boy! You’re such a good boy for me. You know, babe, the Treaty of Versailles is proof that you can never really have lasting peace, if your goal is to humiliate the defeated side. Which is why, I never bully you in order to humiliate you. Oh, no no no. That’s just a fun little side effect (giggling a bit).

I bully you out of love, dummy. Teasing you and getting you all flustered is....is just how I show my affection.....you know?

Yeah. I mean....I did persuade Miss Erin to let me partner up with you again for a history project. (Suggestive) I thought it’d let us spend more time together outside school....

That, and you’re really smart and obedient, so you can handle most of the research and writing. Thanks, babe. I love you. Mwah! (Kissing his cheek, giggling)

Don’t worry, babe. I know you get nervous about public speaking sometimes. Tell you what, I’ll deliver the presentation and you can just focus on writing the good stuff. Like, critical thinking and modern relevance and shit.

(Soft, affectionate) Of course, loser. I’m your girlfriend. It’s my job to protect you. Even from stage fright.

Awww! That’s so sweet of you to say! Thanks, honey. Here- have another strawberry.

Good boy.

You know, I think the Battle of Stalingrad is something we should cover in detail. It was pretty much the turning point of the eastern theatre. Possibly the bloodiest battle in human history. Over 2 million people died quite gruesomely. It was horrific, but it was also full of heroism. No discussion of world war 2 is complete without Stalingrad, yeah.

But of course! We can’t neglect Pearl Harbour either. That is regarded as the immediate reason for the US to enter the conflict. It brought the vast resources of America at the disposal of the Allies, which low-key turned the tide of war. I mean, there was a lot of other stuff going on too, but the money and military hardware sure came in handy.

And then, like- a bunch of other stuff- other *other* stuff happened, like the Battle of Midway, Project Manhattan, the fall of Berlin, the liberation of France, and- and the dropping of the two atomic bombs.

Yup. The US didn’t want to prolong the war with Japan, and so- on 6th August 1945, they dropped the first atom bomb on Hiroshima. And then another three days later, they dropped the second one on Nagasaki. It was about....making a statement, I guess. It’s the only incident in human history of a country using nukes against another. So far, that is.

Yeah. With the world going crazy, especially in the last few months, there’s no telling what’s going to happen next. (Sighing) Life is so rare in the universe, and yet, we seem hell-bent on destroying it. So many damn wars throughout our history. Do people not get tired of fighting each other at some point?

(A longer pause)

Well.....I don’t want us to fight, at least.

Yeah. I was a bit upset with you for being so secretive about our....bond....but I just can’t stay mad at you, you know?

(Faint, smitten) Just can’t stay mad at you when you make those puppy dog eyes.

Hey. Listen. I like you, alright? That’s why I put a collar on you.

I’m in love with you. Dweeb. You wanted to chat about the second world war. I feel like we’ve chatted enough for today. Mhmn. I’ve told you what I want you to write about. I think that is enough foreplay.

Now, (whispering) it’s time to *play*.

You’re such a good boy for your bully. You know what she likes to hear, don’t you?

(Whispering) Call me mommy.

Who’s your mommy, pet? Who do you belong to?

Yeah. That’s right. You belong to *me.* And I- (chuckling huskily, ever so unhinged)- I have *soooo maaany* things I want to do to you. And you’re just going to lie there and take it like the wimp you are. Isn’t that right....(whispering) *wimp*?

Awww, am I being too mean again? Poor pet*.* Maybe I’ll be gentle with you. (Voice dropping) If you call me mommy again.

(Whispering) Say it.

Good boy. But I want you to say it louder this time.

(Sultry whisper) Do it....call me mommy.

Mhmn. Again.

Call me.....*mommy.*

*(SFX: Door suddenly swings open)*

(Mortified silence)

Oh. Hi. (Saccharinely cheerful) Hiiiiiii, Mrs. Mous! How- how are you doing? You uh....um, so- I uh- I see you baked those cookies, huh?!

(An eternity of stunned silence)

Why am I....straddling your son....? We were just, um.....

(Barely audible) We can explain.

It’s my first time working at a specialty coffee shop and I’ve learned so much, I enjoy my work, the regulars, and my coworkers are awesome welcoming people. My manager and also co-owner of the store though has shocking behavior and mindset apparently.
I was talking to my other coworker yesterday and he told me that my manager was talking to another man at the store and he said he “,wasn’t hiring cute girls anymore.” This reads to me as misogyny, creepy in some ways, and also a bit hurtful and targeted as I am the most recent hire and considered conventionally attractive. My coworker wouldn’t give me more details but it’s also the fact he felt the need to mention it to me, which makes me feel as if it’s targeted. I’ve done well at the job and received nothing but positive praise from him and my other coworkers, as well as made many new regulars and learned all the recipes with efficiency. According to my coworkers my manager also, during an extremely busy rush, picked up the drinks my coworker was making as they were ‘wrong’ and made a scene through throwing them against the back wall sink from 15 feet away.

I'm about 5'5 and used to got to the gym before I started driving. But after all this time has passed, I went from 167 to 162 in weight, lost most of my muscle, and am starting to gain a noticeable gut that makes being skinny as hell look all the more unhealthy.

I want to get back into shape enough that I don't at least feel like a slob when I look at my stomach, but that's hard to do when I am on the road practically weeks at a time and my diet consist of coffee, soda, banan's and whatever fast food happens to be at loves. 

I have a 30 pound dumbell in my truck, but that doesn't feel like its doing the job. There is not even much room to do decent pushups or sit-ups unobstructed. And the damn parking lots all smell like piss, so I avoid doing anything out there.

Planning to visit Auckland (and NZ in general) around New Year events 2026/2027, for about at least 3 weeks. As it's the farthest country on Earth for me (I'm from Poland), my chance of revisiting is unfortunately low, that's why I need to squeeze the most of that trip - and start planning already (together with saving money).

So far I've done some research, finding and learning about really great places around, but don't want to miss anything worth visiting. I will focus on North Island, on all major tourist attractions like Hobbiton and Museums. I might go to Wellington for day or two too. I've heard about Great Barrier Island, considering visiting there also.

Fingers crossed, that CRL will be ready until then, but what about other types of transport? I ride motorcycles, is renting one available in Auckland? Same with renting bicycles or electric scooters to travel around the city, are they common? How much can I also depend on public transport, when planning to go outside to places like Mercer Bay or other amazing PoVs?

I would love to learn also more about Maori culture. Is there a way to learn and experience it more than from typical tourist traps that only pretend to be traditional? Is there anything, that will actually provide a lot of knowledge and chance to learn about Maori?

And last question is about Aucklanders in general. I try to be open person, love getting to know people and making new international friendships, will approaching people and starting a small talk make me a creep or it's actually easy to find someone to go grab a beer or coffee?

1n3ex9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Apartmentliving/comments/1n3ex9y/the_sprinkler_that_turned_my_apartment_into_a/,The Sprinkler That Turned My Apartment Into a Mini Waterfall.,"I moved into my apartment a few months ago, and for the most part, it’s been quiet and uneventful. That changed one Sunday morning. I was brewing coffee and looking out the window when I noticed water pooling near the entrance of my building. At first, I thought maybe it had rained overnight, but the sky was clear and bright. Curious, I grabbed my keys and went downstairs to investigate.

As soon as I stepped into the hallway, I realized the source, it was the sprinkler system in the lobby. Somehow, one of the sprinklers had malfunctioned and was spraying water like a fountain straight into the building. By the time I reached the lobby, the carpet was soaked, and water was creeping toward the elevators. A few neighbors were standing there, slipping and sliding, trying to stop it with towels. I ran to grab a mop from the maintenance closet, but the water kept coming.

While we were all scrambling, the building manager finally showed up. Turns out, the sprinkler system had a faulty valve that had been missed during inspection. We spent almost an hour mopping, moving furniture, and trying to contain the damage. I even had to rescue a neighbor’s small dog that had panicked and run under a wet table. By the end of it, the entire lobby smelled of wet carpet and panic, and we were all exhausted, but oddly, it brought everyone together. People who barely said hi before were now joking about needing scuba gear to get to their apartments.

The next day, maintenance replaced the faulty sprinkler, and the lobby dried out, but it left me with a story I won’t forget. I’ve also learned to check the building notices more carefully; apparently, there had been a memo about a sprinkler inspection, but I didn’t think it applied to me. Now, whenever I walk into the lobby, I can’t help but glance at the sprinklers and imagine them going off again.

Has anyone else had a wild maintenance or building mishap? I’d love to hear your stories because, after this, I feel like anything is possible in apartment living.",4,1756491316.0,Apartmentliving,1,0.84,False
