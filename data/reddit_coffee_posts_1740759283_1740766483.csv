Pants that didn’t fit last fall fit comfortably now!

Two issues.  
1- I do a 5:30 am cycle class and I’ve been so nauseous the last few weeks that I’ve puked twice.  I’m the instructor so it’s not cool.   
Ideas for keeping it together? I don’t usually eat that early but it could also be my other meds in combination with ozempic….

2-just went up to 2 mg Thursday and I’m finding that I’m crazy nauseous in the day.  
Had a small coffee and 1/2 breakfast sandwich (tomatoes and spinach and egg on bagel) and a few grapes.   Ate slow (30 min) but now I’m feeling much worse.   

Help! I don’t want to not eat because I feel like crap but it hits about 20 min after I eat.

1j0e8c4,https://i.redd.it/xlvxsw8x7xle1.jpeg,Using ChatGPT in the writer’s room…,"EDIT: Spelling & Grammar Errors

Do any of you use ChatGPT to refine your material?

I’ve found that plenty of writers and editors use ChatGPT as an exploratory, first-look research tool (almost like AskJeeves), but it seems to me that there are a lot more applications for generative text AI when it comes to educating oneself about comedy. It can analyze a life story or a person’s outlook, mining it for incongruities or opportunities to insert the absurd. It can simulate how a big-name comedian might spin a joke. There are dozens of ways to explore comedy with conversational AI, but I don’t hear it talked about in a positive way very often.

Let me give you an example:

I’m working through some demographic exercises, writing a huge outline with different groups, their traits, their motivations, their absurdities, etc (all from my personal point of view). ChatGPT read my outline and condensed it for me, spitting out a few shorthand versions for me to consider. Personally, I found this very helpful and interesting.

Another example is feeding incomplete jokes, fillers, and openers to an AI. By having a short conversation about my set, then describing my mood and beliefs, ChatGPT can attempt to complete the material. More often than not, these answers are at least cute and thought provoking. It feels like getting feedback from a super nerdy editor.

Here’s some material from a writing session earlier this week (I fed my old material and talked to the AI for a couple hours):

*“Millennials are so open-minded they’ll burn your house down for disagreeing with them. They want to be edgy, but they cry when their DoorDash driver doesn’t say ‘thank you.’ We’re the only people on earth who can tear up listening to “The Used”. Like, at what point were we the cool kids? GenX doesn’t give a shit. They’re the only generation that collectively agreed to become ghosts before they were even old. Poor GenZ… Poor GenZ. I can’t tell if we fucked them up or if we’re fucked up. They’re so ready to talk about class warfare, you know, while they… dodge rent. Let’s dismantle capitalism together, after this iced coffee. You there… Are you GenZ? Are you an influencer? YouTuber? Hmm… those slime videos didn’t take you all the way, huh? Influencers are just unemployed people who figured out how to make unemployment look expensive.*

*“It’s like we’re all trying to skip the middle class experience. Not baby boomers, though. Not them. They got in there. They take pride in being middle class, but they blame the tools. They built AI. Did you know that? Their work built this world. It did. They built AI to write emails so we could ‘save time’—and now we spend more time reading AI-generated emails from someone else who was dying inside. ‘Dear Valued Colleague, We deserve fair wages. Sincerely, Betty’ Then the computer asks how we want to respond. ‘Thank you. I’ll get right on that.’ Who talks like that?! Boomers, apparently. You ever see a rich old guy talk about fair wages? ‘Yes, we should all have a living wage. Except Dave. If Dave gets a raise, I have to fly coach.’ It’s all for that sweet, sweet retirement. Every Boomer’s retirement plan is pretending they won the lottery in 1983 and forgot to check the ticket. That’s middle class living right there… Middle-class people love acting like they’re one step away from being homeless, but their version of ‘rock bottom’ is canceling Netflix for two months.*

*”’Rock bottom’… What would life be without rock bottom? You know what’s at the bottom? Regular people. People who’ve learned stuff the hard way. Nobody actually wants the hard way, but we all want to be the guy who did things the hard way—it makes you sound wise instead of just… unlucky. Rich people want generational wealth. Poor people just want generational pettiness. ‘We don’t fuck with the Jacksons. We haven’t since your great-grandpa and their great-grandpa stabbed each other over a pig in 1932.’ What a legacy! What’s up with this seniority of suffering mentality? ‘Back in my day, we had to work hard for what we had!’ and it’s like… yeah, and you also used lead paint and thought smoking cured asthma. ‘The kids are cross-eyed and can’t count, but righty-tighty.’ Maybe not every lesson was a good one.”*

***

I realize nobody in the subreddit has been to one of my little sets, but you should know that this material… it sounds like **me**. Some of it is from me directly, and some of it is like a musical completion of stuff that was half written or just not working. This little draft is probably a third or fourth iteration, and I worked on it at every step with gentle prodding or outright proofing. It’s not going to bring the house down, but for an AI, I found this very impressive. 

Thanks for reading. I’m not concerned about whether you thought the material itself was funny, but I AM curious what you think of this writing method. Please, share your thoughts.",1,1740766292.0,Standup,1,1.0,False

1j0e7xb,https://www.reddit.com/r/projectzomboid/comments/1j0e7xb/i_died_after_6months_in_b42_here_are_some_throughs/,"I died after 6months in B42, here are some throughs...","First of all, i´m having a great time with the update, after my longest run so far, i wanted to share my experience, what is not working for me, what was my highlight and how i think the game could be improved.  
For clearity i will seperate this post into 4 catagories: 1. Intro/Setting, 2. Highlights, 3. Downlights  4. Bugs  
and 5. Ideas for Improvment.  
  
1. I started my run with the goal to survive in the wilderniss and without generated power. I useally play with more Zomboids and more loot as i find it more rewarding, as such i wont comment on loot density or number of zombies in my run. Without power i mostly survived through foraging, fishing and some roadkill.

2.a (**Fishing**): I love the new fishing mechanics, it makes the whole thing very rewarding, even through i never had to replace my fishing line or hook, which seems a bit odd. Fish was also my way to go to make 10kg weightgain in 2days, as i would simplay perished otherwise.  
2.b (**Foraging**): Still uttlery broken (in a benefical sense), i keepet finding watermelons, strawberrys, lemons and Grapefruits in the middle of winter, why would i waste my time with farming if i can just pull a 130hunger *original wild kentucky watermelon TM* out of the forest. I think it´s all around a usefull skill, it provides healing herbs, spices, mushrooms and penuts, bait and building materials.   
2.c (**Animalcare**): i had some chickens and some sheep and they were so cute and they make the world way more alive. I loved taking care of them and gave my an insentiv to regulary return to my base. I really like that you can stop sheering the sheep, i allways left some wool in the winter, even through i dont know if they would have come to harm if sheered blank.  
2.d (**Lighting**): it´s very cool to enter a completly dark building, having to trade in some of my crowbar power for a smaller weapon, it is also very atmospheric.   
2.e (**Winter**) even without power and two ancient ovens, i didn´t need any source of heat most of the time, it´s really not that inconvined and i think thats not what it should be like, also finding tons of grapfruit in the snow (yummy)

3.a (**Glasworking**): never got into it, ***because*** i need a recipe to pour liquid glas into a panal. This makes no sense to me. It´s allready a new skill with little connection to the other crafts and it´s hidden behind a nosenseical limitation.  
3.b (**Agriculture**): it just takes to long, there is no visiual feedback how your plants are doing, they just die. all i could accomplish in 6months is to harvest one yield of turnips.   
3.c (**Building**): There is still the bug with how rooms are considert. It´s still a messy story of breaking corners and walls until it´s finaly counts as a room. Even more frustrating is that sometimes things just arn´t build at all, taking all the ressources and not making anything, this mostly happend when constructing gates at my run. Sometimes furniture and other objects are moved while beeing placed, this is frustrating because of the chance of breaking stuff when picked up.  
  
4.  
\-Pathfinding Issue with deconstrucion, charakter sometimes stucks or performing the breakdance of doom.  
\-Not beeing able to plaster walls.  
\-Adding *Selzer Water* to the amphora tained 200liter of water.  
\-Number of Items collect while forageing is not correctly displayed.  
\-placing a wooden floor onto a costtile allows you to walk on water (1tile away from walls or other floors)  
\-the widely known calorie intake bug (ohh fish my savior)  
\-clay note wasn´t harvestable (tried shovel / sack / pickaxe)  
\-sometimes zombies aren´t rendert or beeing visible through open doors or windows.  
\-able to deconstruct dirt/gravel floor, leaving a black tile  
\-translation error slice of cake should be called *Kuchenstück* in german, not Schneiden (sliceing)

5. I think the game would benefit from diffrent skills working more together and adding an insentiv to level up skills more that are currently underused.  
Personaly i would love to see Metalworking, Smithing and Glasworking beeing extended onto. I think this gives great oppertunitys to create your own greenhouse, or mabye windows for your home, mabye even colored glas making your own lighbulbs. making metalbars infront of your windows, smith fancy fances etc.  
Foraging and cooking together with agriculture could provide a game in itself, the oppertunity to dry meat or mushrooms or smoke or salt meat or fish could add another way to make food for hard times.  
There could also be an way to make cooking levels more rewarding, mabye a chance to oversalt food or waste some materials while cooking, which in turn could be used to feed animals or for the composter.

Food should be more placable let me put the slice of cake onto a plate. let me cook a sweet berry sauce of my gathered fruits in the saucepan, let me fill my coffee and teas into bottles so i can drink them on my way.  
In gerneral i think building needs to extend at some point from survival to living, i would love to see more decorations or half gravelfloors so i can make roads that dosn´t look terrible.  
Pottery could be extended to making plantpots, teapots, other pots for the potheads.

As a finishing thought, the game is on a great way, there is still alot what could be improved and i will happly try out new things after my *dead charakter i need to cry* break. I think alot of trouble at the moment is value balancing, reducing numbers of looted buildings, tweking nutriten etc.

1. A desk refresh
Cleaning out your desk, adding some led lights, cable managing, or a new keyboard. While it may seem tedious a refresh really improved my productivity. Makes me excited to work.
2. to do list
Setting up recurring daily tasks was a game changer for me. Also having everything organized so you know what you need to get done is helpful. Disclaimer: This does nothing for you if you dont use it

3 Throwing my phone across the room.
Sounds extreme ik but really. When i need to work I throw my phone across the room ( or put it in another room gently ) Out of sight out of mind. In addition before i go to sleep i do the same so that when i wake up i need to get up in order to use my phone.

4 COFFEE

5 ANC Headphones or earplugs

6 Dark room / space

7 Deleted Social Media 

8 Diff Browser
Organize my tabs into different workspaces so i am completely focused on the task at hand.

9 change your blue light on your screen. I dont know if it actually works or its a placebo. But i am more focused with less blue light 🤷‍♂️

10 Hear me out

I dont make my bed in the morning.
I shower eat and pray. Then I go to work. When i need a short break I make my bed. 
This works for me if you think its stupid thats up to you. It saves time and it is a great replacement for reddit doom scrolling lol.

1j0e4dh,https://www.reddit.com/r/noburp/comments/1j0e4dh/another_ruined_vacation/,Another Ruined Vacation,"After another ruined vacation to an all inclusive resort in Jamaica where I drank water instead of the endless supply of alcoholic drinks, my wife may have finally found the the root of my and our misery these past few years.  For seven of the eight days on vacation I experienced what I thought was indigestion after every meal, pressure in my chest, gurgling in my throat, and brutal hiccups between five and six times daily.  My hiccups are doubles, tripples and quadruples that often knock my to my knees with pain so bad I want to die.  The hiccups bring an endless flow of saliva into my mouth which will literally flow like a faucet if I tilt my head down.  The only solution that I have been using to stop the hiccups at least temporarily is to stick my fingers down by throat to cause a gag reflex that lets my expel  the air trapped inside of me because I have been unable to burp on my own.  This has been going on for years and seems to follow every social situation that includes eating, drinking and talking.  It is exaserbated by any time spent sitting in a hot tub or standing in waist or chest deep water.  Yesterday during the flight back home after breakfast at the resort, the pain and pressure in my chest and throat and the what seemed like endless bouts of the hiccups, I made several trips to the plane lavatory to stick my fingers down my throat hoping people outside the door wouldn't hear the loud belch that brings me only tempory relief.  So much as sip of water will often trigger their return.  

We thought it was the coffee so I gave up coffee.  We thought it was carbonated berverage so I gave up those.  We thought it was the alcohol so I drank little to any on this trip.  Nothing has helped to far.  

First thing this morning my wife was on the computer researching my symptoms and stumbled on R-CPD.  We have an appointment in a few weeks at Columbia Universtity Hospital in New York.  I am praying for a solution to this.  

Does my story sound familiar? Does anyone else experience the symptoms I've described?

I’ve been working as a radio frequency technician for a little over two years now. I make an average salary in a HCOL state in a critically acclaimed company with many connections to military defense contractors. I originally got into this job because I had just finished my electrical theory and wiring certificate from a trade school (that was a joke, mind you. Barely learned anything since they practically pass anyone who’s willing to pay money and do the below bare minimum work including the teachers) so I was onboarded after having a “perfect” interview. The job was originally offering $45/hr to start but since I had zero experience, I lowballed ($25/hr) to get myself into the company. 

The biggest reason why I lowballed myself in the first place was because I expected this company to be a lot more prestigious than what it really is. I thought we would have a ton of work to complete but no, only one person in my department gets overtime. Actually, this department is so dead that I actually spent my first 8 months as a “secretary” or at least that’s what the real technicians like to call me and mock me as. As of this year, that one guy who gets overtime doesn’t even receive it anymore and the company seems to be moving while our department slowly trickles out. 

The biggest issue so far is that I took this job with base level electrical knowledge (stuff like ohms law and able to use a multimeter, etc) and not once has any of my knowledge been improved on or even used in practice. Any work I receive is complete mouth-breather work that only takes time due to long test queues. Everything is preset for me and if any issues arise, I have to ask another technician for help. That ends up leading to them pushing me to the side and guarding what they’re doing like they’re a cringe high school nerd taking a math test next to a jock. 

Best part about this whole thing is that only one person in my department aside from me is under 55. We already had one person retire and another one is retiring in July. You’d think that they’d want to pass any knowledge or utility down to the next generation but, they’re guarding this information as if they can’t collect SS without those skills. We are super friendly to each other but I guess because I don’t have a dumbass degree, I have to be outcasted a little bit or something.

I don’t even know how to use some of the equipment that I test on and god forbid I go on YouTube, learn something, then try it at work during down periods (which is a lot, I’m actually typing this out right now because today was so dead they had me filing papers for the 5th time this year). Everybody loses their shit when they have to take time away from playing solitaire to put back on my presets and hide the way they do it in the process. I work on an oscilloscope and spectrum analyzer and pretty much the way I was taught to do the job was “readings make mountain, make sure mountain peak passes this box, but not that one. Good luck 👍🏽” 😐

I don’t know if I’m hated or something because the only training I ever received was when they paired me with the Vietnamese guy who literally does no speak English and cannot form a coherent sentences so he picks 3 words max so you can get the gist, the rest is all guessing. 

Certificates are useless to get outside since all the certificates are private special government and company specific certificates that I have to take in house. My manager laughed me off when I asked if I could take any of the courses or classes that the company offers. The CEO is hosting some PCB class in a week that I asked to go to but I guess I’m more useful being the peon doing the unwanted work like cleaning up other people’s spilled coffee and getting blame for it when I had just entered the building 3 minutes prior to getting accused. 

I do acceptance tests process (ATP) that have been fully automated and the only test that wasn’t automated for ATP has been automated as on 5 months ago, so I know truly no nothing. 

Why am I still working here u may ask? I financed a fucking car after a car accident (tree fell in the middle of the road while I was speeding) and I’m in a HCOL area with garbage public transit; i also just turned 22 last month with a few tickets that are supposed to come off my record by September. Long story short my fucking insurance was $1,400 with a $600 car payment. (Maybe choices like this are why they treat me like this). I’m stuck here for another 16 months so I can fully pay off my car and have a little savings money since my parents are going through what they’re doing and trying to separate so I gotta live on my own. Also I pay for everything myself outside of rent and my parents are practically roommates to me, I barely get helped with anything (cook my own food that they usually take, my own laundry that they through theirs into so I end up doing it and folding it, etc). 

I have jobs offering me 6 figures but I can’t take them because I’ll get cooked in the interview. I have no electronic orientated skills (since I’m a commercial electrician by trade education) or certificates yet. I’m planning to start buying a couple of soldering kits and still working on getting certificates outside of the company but I want to know what else I should do to better my future. Also, I have had a huge mental decline since working here, it makes me very volatile and I have become a lazy person from having nothing to do and being yelled at by management for not “pretending” essentially. Sometimes I question if I even wanna continue working in this field but I get offered a lot of money from defense contractors on indeed and LinkedIn, I just don’t have the tangible skills to cash in on it. I also have a personal vendetta against colleges and don’t want to go. I went there earlier this year before my insurance double in price because someone hit my stationary car while my mom borrowed it and she called the police after I told her not to. I’m not walking 50 minutes from work after a 9/80 work week to get a dogshit education at a community college where the teaches haven’t gotten a raise since 2017 and bitch about it constantly (yes, this was my one semester experience).

ATP I’m just ranting and missed the original part of what I’m looking for. Should I just restart my career path or keep going with this bullshit?

TLDR: job wasted 2 years of my life, going on 3 and I’m just thinking about actually learning as much as I can about my job and field so I can leverage for a better paying one since my resume already has this godforsaken company on it that recruiters seem to foam at the mouth about and by the time I leave I’ll have 3 years on my life wasted here.",1,1740765641.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False

1j0dxh2,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1j0dxh2/my_ex_best_friend_chose_dick_over_me/,My ex best friend chose dick over me,"Losing my mom on February 13th was devastating. My best friend knew it was coming, as we'd removed her ventilator on the 7th. I'm someone who values in-person connection, so when Valentine's Day arrived, just a day after my mom passing. I hoped she'd offer to spend an hour or two with me. Instead, I had to ask. She did text, checking in while with her boyfriend, which only highlighted the distance. 

Over the following days, I subtly hinted at my hurt, but she likely avoided the topic. Finally, on the 18th, I was direct: ""I don't like asking much. It's not my favorite thing. I lost my mom on February 13. I don't know, I would have expected a text from you saying do you want to get together or anything. On valentines day, I get its romance day. I wouldn't ask you take 4 hours away from ( boyfriend name) on Friday. I would have ask 1-2 hours max. It's a tough situation. I'm feeling down but you would want happy (my name). I don't care about the coffee or food. I would have felt good that you took time to see me 1 hour and talk to me in person.""

Her response? ""I texted three times, but you didn't reply."" I explained I needed in-person support. She countered that everyone grieves differently and she assumed I wanted space. When I asked if she *would* have met me on Valentine's Day if I'd asked, she said yes. But the fact I had to ask still stung. We ""made up,"" but the underlying issue remained.

Then came another disagreement. We'd planned to meet on the 28th evening, but I also asked about a future Friday morning. She refused, citing her boyfriend's time and accusing me of jealousy. I immediately canceled our plans. There's more to this story, but I won't divulge her private matters.

All I wanted was some time with my best friend, especially after losing my mom.

1j0dshz,https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/1j0dshz/trip_report_our_first_and_last_stay_at_riviera/,"Trip Report: Our first (and last) stay at Riviera, Feb 9-15","After having an all-timer of a 5-day trip the same week (before President’s Day weekend) in February 2023 at Wilderness Lodge, my husband and I returned for a 6-day trip this time to see if we’d have the same luck with weather and crowds this year, staying at the Riviera this time.

Short version: We lucked out again and the weather was perfect! I had been so worried after seeing posts about people enduring the cold snap down there a few weeks before but we got the highs in the low 80s that I wanted and it was just a glorious escape from the cold at home while never getting too hot, could not have asked for better weather. Crowds were not as good as they had been in 2023 during this time, however they weren’t terrible. Sunday and Monday had cheerleaders still around as their event wrapped up but they weren’t disruptive. Tuesday-Thursday crowd levels felt fine. Friday at EPCOT was insanely crowded, but we expected that at the start of the holiday weekend. 

Now for the long version - I love writing long trip reports so hopefully someone will enjoy reading all this! 

Sunday, Feb 9: We drove down from Atlanta. Love having our own car the whole time just in case we need it. Stopped at exit 427 which we will do again, lots of good fast food options that we like there. Around 1:30 I got a text from Disney saying our room was ready, we had checked in online. We got room 8787 on the 7th floor in the east wing. I had been excited thinking maybe this was one that had EPCOT fireworks views despite being a preferred view room (I knew the standard/parking lot views had that for the most part) but nope we mostly had a view of the kids play area at the pool, lol. A little noisy during the day but at night it was actually nice to sit out there on the balcony with the sound of the fountain going and no kids. 

We used DVC Rental Store for our Riviera rate of about $500/night. Not the greatest deal and though they were great to work with I won’t do the non-refundable route again, we didn’t save that much money and not having the flexibility to cancel ended up being really stressful when we had an unexpected life change in November and weren’t sure if we were going to be able to do the trip as planned for a bit. Fortunately it all worked out, but the savings wasn’t really worth that stress to me.

Riviera general notes: I was fully expecting to not be bothered by the lack of theming etc. that others had complained about but having stayed there now I see what people mean… it almost feels like a limbo space adjacent to the Disney bubble vs. the other resorts I’ve stayed at (Wilderness, Coronado, Riverside, Port Orleans and Grand Floridian). It also felt slightly dingy for the price in some areas, and having gazed longingly at the pools from the outside on previous trips I really thought I’d enjoy them more but they felt too in the middle of everything and crowded to be relaxing. The Wilderness Lodge’s quiet pool remains my favorite on property, and these pools had none of that sense of serenity to me. I also kind of hated our room more and more throughout the stay…. Walking in it just wasn’t impressive right away (vs. walking in to our standard Wilderness Lodge room last time, we immediately loved it… Maybe I just love that place too much, I shouldn’t have bothered trying something new lol), the pull down bed wasn’t comfortable, and in general it just felt non-immersive and like any chain hotel anywhere. We weren’t that impressed with Primo Piatto or Topolino’s either though they were both fine… The coffee shop was great though I don’t get the praise about the banana bread. Didn’t end up having time/appetite to try Bar Riva’s food. I also somewhat had the delusional expectation that this hotel would feel more ‘adult’ too and it really didn’t, all the public spaces were loud with kids everywhere just like any other Disney spot.

Anyway, all those complaints aside that we had a great trip! I just wouldn’t pay $500/night for that hotel experience again. 

Back to Sunday - after we arrived and got unpacked we went to the quiet pool with some drinks from the room (we always bring our own booze and snacks to save a little money, another reason I love driving down) and decompressed after the drive for a bit, then after showers took the Skyliner to Hollywood Studios so we could get on a bus to Old Key West. I wanted to try the key lime Dole whip. It was tiny but really good with a nice fluffy consistency to the soft serve it and I LOVED being at this resort at sunset, the setting was perfect! I will look into staying at OKW in the future, it had never really been on my radar but I found it super charming and just the kind of beachy upscale resort vibe I love. 

I hadn’t even realized OKW had a boat to Disney Springs, which luckily was just arriving after we finished our Dole whip. We had a nice boat ride over for our Disney Springs evening, got in line at Gideon’s for cookies and only waited about 15-20 mins. We both had a glass of rose from the Wine Bar George window while waiting. I wanted that white chocolate mac nut cookie but it was sold out, I guess this is the downside of winding up there later in the day with a short line. (Cookies note: I had thought we’d love snacking on these cookies in the room throughout the trip but we were usually too full from other stuff to want them so most of them came home with us.) We grabbed some beers from Polite Pig and got D’Luxe burger for dinner. I tried the French onion burger and loved it, the vlogger who raved about this (who we later saw having dinner lol) was spot on that it’s excellent. My husband had a regular burger and said it was just fine. We found what may be my new favorite spot in DW, this little mediterranean-feeling alcove where we had our burgers, it was a nice pocket of quiet and so charming to me with the perfect evening weather, one of those random magical moments at the start of our trip. Went back to Riviera by bus after a little browsing (didn’t buy anything) and watched Monsters Inc. before bed.

Monday, Feb 10 - Got up at 6:30 and failed to get the GotG virtual queue at 7am. We drove our car to Animal Kingdom because of bad experiences trying to get there to/from on the buses in the past, and of course as we were pulling out of the hotel’s parking lot I saw an Animal Kingdom bus pulling up to our stop… Not sure driving was that much less stressful in the end, but it didn’t really matter that we arrived after early entry was over because we were lining up to see the baby tiger first thing, and we learned after getting in line that they don’t let you in to see him until 9am. We had a nice wait at the front of the long line though, in a quiet and pretty area with a view of some entertaining monkeys. The cast members were great with updates on what to expect and showing us pics of the baby while we waited. We were lead in right at 9am and baby Bakso and his mom were right there by the windows, and after the fog on the glass cleared a little we got some great pics, then we were lead to another viewpoint where we watched them playing together some more, we loved this! 

I had bought multi LL for this day because I wanted to see Bakso first thing and not worry about long lines by the time that was done. We had the safari booked from 8:30-9:30, and we were pretty hungry so we grabbed breakfast at the Yak and Yeti window, my husband’s breakfast sandwich was good and those hash browns bites were awesome! I got a yogurt parfait which I don’t recommend, it was just a big tub of too sweet vanilla yogurt with some berry goop and bad granola. I would go out of my way to get those hash browns again though! We made it to the Safari in time to use our LL and they let me bring my coffee on the truck, yay. Had a great safari and saw all the animals, including a giraffe sitting down which was adorable/hilarious. After that we had a LL for Navi River so did that, then did Dinosaur one last time with an LL, I love that ride and will miss it. The park was feeling pretty packed at this point; we waited about 15 mins for Everest single rider and were getting tired/thirsty by the time we rode. We had an LL for Everest at 1pm and wanted to ride it one more time together so we did a mobile order for cheeseburger pods from Satuli Canteen as a snack while waiting for our ride window to begin. We both really enjoyed these and this restaurant is cute, it was our first time trying it. Also walked some of the animal trails at this point, always love the bird area. We did our Everest LL and headed to our lunch reservation at Saana by car.  The place was dead and I loved it after the noise and crowds at the park, very peaceful though the food wasn’t as good as it had been in 2023. Service was great and the whole hotel area felt relaxing.

We drove back to our hotel around 3pm and had pool time, then after showers headed to EPCOT around 6pm, did Living with the Land and Soarin’ and got my beloved La Fin du Monde on draft in Canada. We had a 7:30-8:30 single LL purchased for GotG so we ended up rushing through dinner to make it to that, I got the bread cheese bowl from the France booth (didn’t like it, low quality cheese) and my husband had the duck dish from the same booth and said it was pretty good. I mostly just wanted the brioche sandwich with coffee ice cream (I tried to order this last time we went and they gave me vanilla, wah) and after acquiring that I basically ate it on the run to GotG to make it for the end of our LL window… only to be told it was closed and probably wouldn’t reopen all night. We’d gotten the 6pm virtual queue for it as well since we were at a deluxe and it was an extended evening hours night at EPCOT… we were bummed and took the Skyliner back to the hotel around 9pm after riding Spaceship Earth, essentially skipping the extended hours because we really just wanted to do GotG. Checked Remy for single rider on the way out but they weren’t doing it and the regular line was very long. At 10:59pm I got a callback message for my virtual queue spot, lol. 

Tuesday, Feb 11 - I got up early and lived my dream of having the Riviera quiet pool to myself. This was a lovely way to start the day, my husband slept in and I went back and forth from the pool to the hot tub and enjoyed all the birds. We did a mobile order from Primo Piatto for breakfast, tried the breakfast platter and the lemon-blueberry pancakes. That polenta in the platter was great! I wanted it for lunch or dinner later in the trip but didn’t see any on those menus. After breakfast we drove to Blizzard Beach. We’d done a three day park hopper plus ticket so this was included. I’d been a little disappointed that this one was open instead of Typhoon Lagoon but we ended up having a great day at Blizzard. We did the lazy river first before it got too crowded (later we returned but were bumping into other groups too much for my liking), then did all the slides (husband did the super steep one but I skipped that), really enjoyed them, the ski lift, and the relaxed pace of the park, especially right after opening when it felt pretty empty. At one point we got a Mickey pretzel with cheese for a snack and a couple of drinks, the cocktail I had was legit! We went back to the hotel around 2:30 to shower and relax. 

For our evening we started at Wailulu around 5:30pm and waited just 5 minutes or so for a table. I would not recommend asking them to make a Trader Vic’s style mai tai lol, our server was great and faithfully wrote down all the ingredients but apparently this place doesn’t have orgeat at their bar??? They must pre-batch their mai tais because it’s listed as an ingredient on the menu… They ended up serving me Appleton with some amaretto mixed in lmao, they even forgot the the lime… in a tiny glass for like $20, oh well, I tried (can’t stand the Disney mai tais with pineapple or whatever else mixed in). The atmosphere, service and food (tuna crisps and musubi) were great and hilariously my husband spotted a vlogger I’d been watching a lot in preparation for this trip having dinner with her friends there. Really enjoyed this spot and would return. We walked over to Grand Floridian afterward, the evening was beautiful and this was a lovely stroll. Had an espresso martini at the Enchanted Rose, this place was cute but the group next to us had a bunch of rowdy adults who were ignoring their well-behaved children which was a weird vibe. 

We took the monorail from there to the Boardwalk where we had a reservation at Flying Fish. I have always regretted my expensive and disappointing visits to the Disney fine dining …. Until now! This place was amazing, from the service to the bread basket, drinks, atmosphere, everything was just excellent and I would 100% go back, we loved our meal. 

Wednesday, Feb 11 - This was the day I tried to do waaaay too much. Part of this was because we didn’t get to ride GotG at least twice on Monday as planned since it was down. I ran myself ragged trying to do everything - 3 parks, 12 rides, nonstop running from morning till night. 

We began with Hollywood Studios and did early entry to walk on to Rockin Rollercoaster. This was fun as always but not the best ride to start with when you had one too many the night before and are slightly hungover! After RR we walked on to Tower of Terror, then Runaway Railway, all before park open. We had multipass LL this day as well and had one for Slinky at 9:30, then mobile ordered the tater tot breakfast bowl at Woody’s Lunchbox afterward, it was delicious and miraculously we even got a table. HS was already packed by 10am, Toy Story land is hell on earth to me, and I told my husband I already wanted to leave, though we had LLs for Tower of Terror and Midway Mania. I just do not like this park despite loving some of the rides. After an hour or so it reliably makes me miserable and figuring out how to get to Toy Story land always makes me confused and angry somehow. We took a quick stroll around Galaxy’s Edge before going to see Muppets 3D one last time around 10:30, then went to guest services to get our single pass LL for GotG from Monday night refunded since the ride had been down. I mentioned to the CM who helped us with that that I’d gotten a virtual queue for GotG for that morning but the window was ending at 10:30 and she said they were very flexible with the return time and that I should go for it, so that was happy news and I was ready to get the hell out of HS. 

We had terrible Skyliner companions on the way to EPCOT, I had to use my husband’s headphones to even survive, this lady’s voice, volume and nonstop repetitive statements to her sisters were insane. Felt bad for my husband because there was only one set of headphones lol. Once we arrived we went to Les Halles to grab a cappuccino, ham and cheese baguette and brie sandwich and a lemon tart. The brie sandwich wasn’t great (weird bread, low quality cheese) but the ham and cheese was fantastic. The boat was loading as we walked up so we took that across the water toward Guardians to use our virtual queue about two hours after the window had “expired.” No issues there and we got Conga for our song. We went to the aquarium afterward and saw an adorable manatee eating some lettuce, got great pics of that. We didn’t realize we couldn’t do the 1pm virtual queue in addition to the 7am one so we tried for that and learned something new. We got in line for Soarin’, and while there I saw that a single pass LL for Guardians had become available (previously it had been sold out), yayy, so we bought that. 

We got a frozen lemonade on our way out on toward the buses, thinking a Riviera bus would be quicker than walking all the way back through the park and getting on Skyliner… Well, we learned something new again, there is no Riviera bus. One bus driver who was in the area claimed a Riviera bus would eventually come (after asking if the Skyliner was down) but the prospect seemed grim after we’d waited about 15 mins so we just hopped on a bus to Hollywood Studios as soon as we saw it and then took Skyliner back to Riviera. 

Had some hot tub and pool time, then mobile ordered from Primo Piatto (croque monsieur and turkey panini, both were fine, fries were great) and ate that in the room as an early dinner before heading back to EPCOT around 6 when we had a Frozen LL with the multipass. Did that ride for our first time ever, then did our 7pm single pass LL on GotG and got car 9 and Disco Inferno, yay. My goal was to get Everybody Wants to Rule the World before the end of this trip, the only one I’ve never gotten… 

After that we took the monorail to MK and did our single pass LL for Tron. We enjoyed it but weren’t willing to wait in the 60+ minutes line to ride again later. They did have extended evening hours at MK this night but we were wearing down even around fireworks time. We got an ice cream sundae for stamina, then rode Space Mountain. We wanted to try Tiana for the first time but were told that’s not part of extended evening hours when we walked over there… ok? We walked on to Pirates around 9:20pm for my favorite kind of experience with that ride, all visible boats and the whole line empty, and then we were done, just exhausted. Left the park by bus around 9:30 and were back at the hotel by 10, wiped out.

Thursday, Feb 13 - Fortunately this was my planned rest day! I didn’t even make it down to the pool as planned for a peaceful morning swim, just lazed about the room until our 10:50 Kona Cafe reservation. We drove, and at first I regretted not canceling this and doing Wailulu later for lunch instead because god the Poly is CHAOTIC, that lobby is so loud, crowded and stressful to me! But fortunately we got a table at the back of the cafe near the windows where it was quiet, and I enjoyed my usual mac nut pancakes and pog juice. I’d planned to walk the Poly grounds after breakfast but I couldn’t even handle the gift shop and this was a humid day, a good one for a rest. We went back to the hotel and I ended up napping for two hours! Eventually I got up to do the pool, hot tub and gelato stand, which was nice. The humidity had mellowed by then. We didn’t really do anything else all evening, just went to dinner at Topolino’s at 8:30. We had a great table with a fireworks view but I wasn’t that impressed with this place except for the escargot. Our waiter and the waitress at the neighboring table were raving about that sole entree, both doing the same ‘I don’t even usually like fish that much!’ spiel about how life changing it was… It was a buttery piece of slightly overcooked fish lol, I don’t get it. That’s on me for ordering it after they’d hyped it up, it’s not something I’d normally get. The gnocchi were pretty good and my husband got the beef cheek entree which he didn’t love. I was kind of bummed by the food but they did let me take my glass of champagne to go back to the room when I was too stuffed to even finish a second drink (also got the French Rose cocktail, which was great). What I hate about these fine dining Disney places (except for Flying Fish, which was perfect!) is how overly salty all the food always is. Jiko, Le Cellier, California Grill and now Topolino’s all left me with the same ‘I just swallowed a rock’ feeling of having eaten wayyy too much salt and just feeling ill and annoyed that I paid like $200+ for the experience. Anyway, I’ll do Flying Fish again for sure but otherwise I’m done with giving these spots a chance.

Friday, February 14 - Valentine’s Day and our last day! We were still quite tired after overdoing it for the first 3 days as usual. I was futzing around with the coffee maker and missed the GotG virtual queue by 30 seconds or whatever, it was sold out right at 7am. Got a cappuccino and that banana bread from the cafe downstairs, great coffee and just okay banana bread imo. Did the pool and hot tub for a bit and then took the Skyliner to EPCOT around noon, did Remy’s in the single rider lane and only waited about 15 mins. I felt a little bit like an interloper because I got put with a family of two parents and three kids and they clearly didn’t know a stranger might get stuck with them lol, but they were polite and it was their first time on the ride so all the exclamations of surprise and delight from them were cute. I love this ride! Won’t wait more than 20 mins for it but it’s so darling and fun to me.

EPCOT was slammed. I got in line for a citron slushie in France while my husband got food for us from the Japanese booth. He had the sushi donut and we split the Wagyu beef bun which was tasty. I enjoyed my slushie and some people watching from the table we found in Morocco. At 1pm I was on the phone ready to grab that Guardians virtual queue and this time we got it, yay, in group 145. We headed over to Germany to try the famous pretzel bread pudding and my husband also got a beer. The bread pudding lived up to the hype for us, we both loved it. After that we trekked over to get the Beef Wellington Croissant. I had high hopes because we LOVED the beef wellington snack from the arts fest in 2023, but it was too salty and the meat was kind of bleh. We took the Skyliner back to our hotel to rest after that, needing a break from the massive crowds. We watched Monster’s University and I fell asleep for a while.

Around 6pm we headed back to EPCOT for our Guardians rides and dinner. We tried the scone with smoked salmon from one of the booths and it was tasty, then the carne asada and Floridita from another booth. Best part of the carne asada was the tiny piece of fried cheese and that drink was not great. At 7:30 we had our single pass LL for Guardians and got Conga again, then we got right back in line for our virtual queue ride and got Conga AGAIN, ahhh, oh well, I love the ride whatever the song is. 

I was wearing down big time so we took the Skyliner back to the hotel during fireworks.

Saturday, Feb 15 - I’d planned to have a nice morning swim before we left but I woke up feeling sick. Mobile ordered breakfast and had Mickey waffles on the balcony. Bought cough drops from the gift shop on the way out and drove home. 

Then I had a surprise extra week off work because I was sick as a dog with some sinus or viral infection, not Covid or flu according to the doctor I saw on Sunday at home but something that was making me cough like crazy for a week and a half. 

Anyway, I feel like I complained a lot here but we had a wonderful time! The weather was a highlight, cast members and other guests were all pleasant (except for that one lady on the Skyliner!!), and I just love hanging out in my favorite swamp. Will probably take a break for 5 years or so because of the price and not wanting it to feel stale. Maybe we can make it to the Tokyo parks, that’s the vague plan for next November… Thanks for reading!

1j0ds5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1j0ds5w/ms_the_pipe_and_the_perpetual_present/,[MS] The Pipe and the Perpetual Present,"The fluorescent lights in the public restroom hummed with a discordant, buzzing energy, amplifying the already oppressive atmosphere of institutional cleanliness.  Except, it wasn't clean. Not truly.  Beneath the harsh glare, a patina of grime clung to the porcelain, and the air hung heavy with the cloying scent of industrial cleaner struggling to mask something far less palatable.  Near the back, at the base of stall number three, a stain.  Not just any stain, but a damp, spreading patch that seemed to pulse with a life of its own.  It started subtly, weeks ago perhaps, a mere shadow on the linoleum, but now it had blossomed into a disturbing, uneven circle, dark and slick. Janitorial staff, muttering under their breath about overtime and unidentifiable substances, had attacked it with every chemical in their arsenal.  Bleach, enzyme cleaners, even something vaguely citrus-scented that promised “miracle stain removal.”  Nothing worked.  The stain persisted, growing incrementally, defying logic and cleaning protocols.  From within stall three, unsettling, wet sounds occasionally seeped out – soft gurgles, the squish of damp fabric, a faint, almost imperceptible trickle.  No one dared investigate directly, preferring the vague unease of the unknown to confronting whatever lurked within.

Then, he emerged. From stall three, naturally.  Aaron. He was… present.  That was the most generous description. Objectively, he was a catalog of minor unpleasantries coalescing into a being.  His skin was a landscape of red eruptions, boils in various stages of inflamed agony, some capped with glistening yellow pus, others weeping translucent fluid.  His hair, lank and greasy, clung to his scalp in uneven clumps, hinting at infrequent, possibly incomplete, attempts at hygiene.  And the smell.  It wasn’t overwhelming, not initially, but it was pervasive.  A faint, sour tang that seemed to ride on the air currents, a whisper of stale urine mingling with something vaguely cheesy, and an undercurrent of general uncleanliness. He shuffled to the sink, his movements jerky and uncoordinated, like a marionette with fraying strings. He glanced at the faucet, a cursory, almost dismissive look, then ambled out of the restroom, leaving behind the humming lights, the persistent stain, and the lingering aroma of Aaron.

Aaron worked at Forms & Functions, Inc., an office so dedicated to the principle of blandness it could have been weaponized.  Beige was not just a color; it was a philosophy.  Beige walls, beige carpets, beige cubicles, beige forms.  The air itself seemed beige, thick with the muted sighs of souls slowly being drained of vibrancy.  A memo arrived, circulated like a damp cough through the office.  It was water-damaged, edges softened and frayed, stained with a brown substance that could have been coffee, tea, or something far less palatable.  The ink was smeared, the print faded.  It spoke, in fragmented phrases and incomplete sentences, of… something.  Workplace initiatives, procedural updates, mandatory fun – the possibilities were as endless as they were irrelevant.  No one could decipher its true meaning, its intended purpose lost in a fog of bureaucratic inertia.  A low-grade anxiety, a persistent hum of unease, spread through the office drone collective.  Aaron, attempting to read the memo upside down and back-to-front simultaneously, managed to spill a tepid cup of instant coffee onto his trousers.  The stain joined the constellation of other indeterminate discolorations already adorning his perpetually rumpled attire.

Whispers began, subtle at first, then coalescing into a low murmur that followed Aaron like his personal miasma.  “Did you see the memo?” someone hissed near the water cooler (which, predictably, was malfunctioning again, dispensing water with a disconcerting gurgle).  “It’s… weird, right?”  The conversation drifted, inevitably, to the stain in the restroom.  “It’s still there,” another voice, hushed and conspiratorial.  “Worse, I think.”  Then, the unspoken, almost involuntary conclusion, whispered with the resigned tone of accepting a minor, inevitable tragedy: “Aaron.”  No one explicitly accused him of creating the stain, or writing the indecipherable memo, or sabotaging the water cooler.  It was simply understood. Aaron, in his very being, was a locus of minor office misfortunes, a walking, breathing embodiment of low-level corporate dread.

Mandatory fun. The words themselves dripped with insincerity, a cruel mockery of genuine enjoyment.  Today’s team-building exercise: stapler balancing.  The office drones, forced into a semblance of forced camaraderie, attempted to balance office staplers on their foreheads.  The absurdity was palpable, hanging thick in the air like the smell of burnt popcorn from the perpetually overheated microwave in the breakroom. Aaron participated, of course.  Or rather, he was present, technically in the vicinity of the team-building exercise.  He scratched at a particularly inflamed boil on his neck with unsettling vigor, then absentmindedly picked his nose, examining the contents with a detached curiosity before flicking it vaguely in the direction of a wilting potted plant.  A series of wet, phlegmy coughs erupted from him, each one punctuated by a faint spray of moisture.  His colleagues, their faces masks of polite discomfort, subtly widened their orbits, creating a buffer zone of approximately three cubicle-lengths around Aaron.  He seemed oblivious, or perhaps even enjoyed their discomfort, a flicker of something unsettling, almost smug, playing around his greasy lips.

Later, back at his beige cubicle, Aaron found a note.  Crumpled, anonymous, left on his desk like an unwanted gift.  Unfolding it with fingers that left faint greasy smudges, he deciphered shaky handwriting: “Beware the puddles. They know.”  Puddles?  Aaron stared at the note, his brow furrowed in genuine confusion.  Puddles of what?  Knowing what?  It made no sense.  The words promised a sense of impending doom, of hidden menace lurking beneath the surface of… puddles.  But the threat was immediately deflated by its utter banality.  Puddles.  He shrugged, the movement causing a cascade of dandruff to dust his shoulders.  He used the note to dab at a boil that had begun to weep a thin, yellowish fluid, then crumpled it again and tossed it into the overflowing trash can, alongside coffee-stained paper towels and discarded beige forms.

Then the puddles started.  Small, at first, easily dismissed as spills, leaky water bottles, the general messiness of office life.  But they multiplied, spreading like a damp rumor.  Not just water.  Some were viscous, faintly oily, with a rainbow sheen reminiscent of engine coolant.  Others were discolored – murky brown, vaguely green, even a disturbing shade of pale yellow.  They appeared in illogical places.  On desktops, nestled amongst beige forms and staplers.  Inside desk drawers, mingling with paperclips and forgotten pens.  A small, disconcerting puddle even materialized on a ceiling tile above cubicle 4B, dripping intermittently onto the head of the unfortunate occupant.  Chaos, of a low-grade, bureaucratic variety, descended upon Forms & Functions, Inc.  The memo was forgotten, a quaint artifact of a simpler, less damp time.  The puddles became the new, more immediate, and equally meaningless source of anxiety.

An office meeting was called, a spontaneous, disorganized gathering held standing because all the chairs were, inexplicably, damp.  The topic: puddles.  Explanations were demanded, solutions proposed, blame subtly assigned.  Aaron stood at the back, his presence radiating a damp, faintly urinary aura.  During a particularly rambling and incoherent suggestion about absorbent office supplies, Aaron mumbled something.  Inaudible to most, but a few near him caught fragments: “…pressure… gotta… release…”  Silence fell.  Heads turned.  Interpretations, like damp stains, began to spread.  “Did he… confess?” someone whispered, eyes wide with a mixture of revulsion and morbid fascination.  The silence stretched, heavy with unspoken implications.  Then, slowly, the meeting dissolved, no action taken, no answers found.  The puddles remained, stubbornly, inexplicably present.

The janitorial staff, weary and overworked, finally located the source.  Not Aaron, not supernatural forces, not even corporate sabotage.  A burst pipe.  Deep within the building’s ancient, forgotten plumbing system, a pipe had given way, releasing decades of accumulated gunk and grime.  The variety of liquids in the puddles?  Rust, mineral deposits, stagnant water, possibly even traces of… other things that had been flushed down office drains over the years.  The “twist,” if it could be called that, was utterly mundane, grotesquely so.  Far less interesting, far less dramatically satisfying than any whispered conspiracy theory surrounding Aaron.

The pipes were eventually fixed.  The puddles vanished, sucked away by industrial-strength wet-vacs, leaving behind only faint tide lines and a lingering, vaguely metallic smell.  The memo remained unaddressed, filed away in the collective memory as just another piece of office detritus.  Forms & Functions, Inc. returned to its prior state of soul-crushing beige monotony.  Aaron, of course, remained unchanged.  Unhygienic, ugly, inept, and faintly urinary.  He continued to frequent stall number three, continued to spill coffee on his trousers, continued to radiate a low-grade aura of unease.  Life, in its beige and unremarkable glory, went on.  In the restroom, stall number three, now pristine and dry, remained stubbornly, unsettlingly clean.  But if one looked closely, really closely, at the very base of the stall, one might notice a new stain beginning to form.  Subtle, almost invisible at first, but undeniably present.  Its origin, its nature, entirely ambiguous.  A promise, or perhaps a threat, of a cycle of pointless, unremarkable dread continuing indefinitely.",1,1740765180.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I’m now working at a rural hospital close to where I grew up, and therefore have some connections to high level leadership (CEO, directors, etc.): I’m sure someone would hear me out if I had a serious offer. It would be a great time to get an established contract with this place; it’s relatively small right now (~400 employees) but is growing quickly. 

I’ve been brainstorming ideas and have come up with a couple but would love to hear any suggestions: 

- Coffee. There’s a cafe that sells breakfast stuff but no good coffee. I hear people complain about this every day. I’d only need to have an espresso machine / cart, not do any baked goods or anything. 

- Cleaning. There’s a full time cleaning staff that’s very small, overworked, and doesn’t always have time to do the best job. I’m thinking there could be room for some kind of outside cleaning service. 

- Window washing. This facility is huge and has a ton of windows. Haven’t seen anyone cleaning them. Really interested to hear if I could do this on a “budget”. 

Any other ideas?

The Clippers have cashed the Over in 9 of their last 12 outings, and while Luka Doncic & LeBron James are presently listed as ‘Questionable’ (standard…) for this Lakers home encounter, the total will undoubtedly climb the moment one of them (or both of them!) are confirmed. My money is on the Over to hit, friends.

1j0dmw6,https://www.reddit.com/r/penpals/comments/1j0dmw6/30f_looking_for_long_term_meaningful_friendships/,30F - looking for long term meaningful friendships,"Hi there! I’m 30F based in the US, and I’m looking for a long-term pen pal to form a genuine, meaningful friendship with. I’d love to find someone who enjoys instant messaging, emails regularly and exchanging thoughts, ideas, and experiences over time. A friendship built on trust, honesty, and meaningful conversations is something I really value, and I’m excited about the possibility of finding someone who shares that mindset.

A little about me: I’m someone who thrives on both deep, introspective conversations and light-hearted, random chats. Some of my biggest interests are cats (I adore them), coffee (I’m a major coffee lover and can’t function without it!), and anything artsy or creative. I also love going to Christmas markets, collecting cute little things, and anything that gives me those cozy, warm feelings.

In terms of my hobbies, I’m into a mix of things! I love traveling and exploring new places, whether it’s a quick weekend getaway or something more adventurous. I’ve recently gotten back into dancing, which has been such a fun and creative outlet. I’m also a big fan of the Harry Potter series and am always down for some magical discussions. You’ll often find me catching up on Bayern Munich games—huge fan here! And most importantly, I LOVE FOOD!!!

Just a quick warning: I have a serious love for puns!! If you enjoy wordplay and a good laugh, we’ll get along just great!!!

One thing I’ve come to realize over time is that I value long-lasting friendships that are built on consistent communication and mutual support. I’m not someone who’s interested in just casual, short-term exchanges—I really want to connect with someone on a deeper level. I believe that the best friendships are the ones where you can share your highs and lows, help each other grow, and genuinely care about each other’s well-being.

I’m hoping to find someone who also appreciates regular communication and can keep a conversation going, whether we’re discussing books, life experiences, dreams, or just daily musings. I think it’s so special to be able to share both the little and big things in life, and I’m eager to find a pen pal who’s open to that kind of connection.

Ideally, I’d love to connect with someone who is kind, open-minded, and enjoys exchanging thoughts over the long haul. Whether you’re someone who likes to write longer letters or just send quick but thoughtful updates, I’m open to it! I think it’s all about the quality of the connection and the effort we put into it.

If any of this resonates with you, feel free to reach out—I’d love to get to know you better and see where this pen pal friendship could go!",1,1740764811.0,penpals,0,0.99,False
1j0dmh6,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1j0dmh6/mf_archival_anomaly/,[MF] Archival Anomaly,"Tina had long since accepted that the Gas ’N’ Go was weird.

It wasn’t an enthusiastic acceptance—more of a weary, defeated sigh, like the kind you let out when your shift is still six hours from ending and a customer just asked if you “work here.”

But today? Today was pushing it.

She sat behind the counter, eyes locked on the security monitor, scrubbing back through footage as Barry leaned casually over her shoulder. A customer stood at the counter, arms crossed, watching expectantly.

“I swear I bought it,” the man insisted. “I put it on the counter, paid for it, and everything.”

Tina, deadpan, barely looked up. “It’s not on the receipt.”

“Well, yeah, but I still remember—”

Barry held up a single finger. “Let’s consult the eye of judgment.”

The customer blinked. “The… what?”

Tina ignored him and fast-forwarded through the past hour of footage. The grainy black-and-white screen flickered as she watched the man walk in, grab a pack of gum, place it on the counter—

And then… nothing. He paid for his drink, but the gum was gone.

Tina sighed and rewound it. This time, the gum was in his hand.

She paused. The screen flickered slightly.

Fast-forward. No gum.

Rewind. Gum.

She sat back. “Huh.”

Barry hummed, mildly entertained. “Fascinating.”

The customer squinted at the monitor. “Wait, what do you mean ‘huh’?”

Tina exhaled slowly. “It’s there, then it’s not.”

The man leaned in. “Wait—are you saying the gum just disappeared?”

Barry nodded sagely. “Reality is fickle.”

Tina stared at him. “Don’t help.”

Barry simply sipped his coffee, smiling ever so slightly.

The customer, now visibly uncomfortable, scratched the back of his neck. “Uh… you know what? It’s fine. I probably just forgot to grab it.” He turned and hurried out of the store.

Tina let out a relieved sigh. “Thank god.”

Barry tilted his head ever so slightly. “That wasn’t what happened, though.”

Tina turned back to the screen. “I know.”

She pressed play again and continued scanning the footage. Something about it felt… off.


---


As she watched, something shifted.

Barry was behind the counter in the footage, sipping his coffee—except the real Barry hadn’t done that yet.

Tina glanced at him. He was still mid-sip, matching the movement exactly a second later.

She rewound. Barry moved first.

She fast-forwarded. Then the real Barry moved.

She squinted. Did you just—

Barry took another sip. “Hmm?”

Tina shook her head and went back to the footage.

A man in a heavy jacket walked into the store.

A minute passed.

He walked in again.

Tina paused. “Hold up.”

Barry leaned in slightly. “He never left.”

The screen flickered.

Now the man was gone entirely.

Tina clicked back. He was there. Then he wasn’t.

“Cool,” Barry murmured.

Tina exhaled through her nose. “Not the word I’d use.”

Barry set his coffee down. “Try camera three.”

Tina hesitated. Camera three pointed behind the counter—right where they were standing now.

She clicked.

And there, standing perfectly still, staring directly into the camera, was Frank.

Or rather, a second Frank.


---


Tina froze.

The second Frank didn’t move. He didn’t blink. He just stood there, eyes locked on the camera, expression empty.

Tina, not taking her eyes off the screen, nudged Barry with her elbow.

He made a thoughtful noise. “That’s new.”

A shuffle of movement.

The real Frank walked out of the back office, coffee in hand. He stopped when he saw them watching the screen. “What?”

Tina simply pointed.

Frank leaned in, saw his duplicate staring soullessly into the camera, and without hesitation, turned around and walked back into his office.

“Good call,” Tina muttered.

Barry grinned.

The screen flickered again.

The second Frank slowly turned his head toward the camera.

Tina felt her stomach drop.

The image distorted—static lines crawling up the screen.

A flicker.

The second Frank was gone.

Tina clenched her jaw. “Okay. No more of that.” She switched back to the main camera feed.

The time stamp read 25:63 AM.

Tina immediately switched it off.

Barry’s smile widened. “Is that a new time slot? I do love a good limited release.”

Tina rubbed her temples. “Shut up.”

That’s when the bell over the door jingled, and Conspiracy Chad walked in.


---


Chad’s eyes immediately locked onto the security monitor.

“Woah, woah, woah—why’s it off?”

Tina, already exhausted, didn’t even look up. “It’s broken.”

Chad scoffed. “Yeah, right. You’re hiding something.”

Tina took a slow sip of coffee. “Mhm.”

Chad’s expression darkened. “I’m watching you.” He strutted up to the counter, squinting. “What did it show?”

Barry leaned against the counter, smiling. “Curious?”

Chad folded his arms. “Obviously.”

Barry reached over and turned the monitor back on.

The footage played backward on its own.

Chad took a step back. “What the hell?”

Tina squinted. “I didn’t do that.”

The footage rewound back to the beginning of the shift.

It started playing normally.

Everything looked perfectly fine.

No glitches. No missing customers. No second Frank.

Barry sighed. “How dull.”

Chad shook his head, suspicious. “No, no, I saw it. It was going backward—”

He grabbed his phone and started filming the monitor.

The footage played.

Normal.

Normal.

Normal.

Chad lowered his phone slightly, confused. “But it—”

He rewound the recording on his phone.

His footage was also normal.

Tina crossed her arms. “Yup. Broken.”

Chad’s eye twitched.

Barry took a leisurely sip of coffee. “Perhaps it was simply a playback error.”

Chad’s breathing picked up. “No. No, this is gaslighting. Reality is gaslighting me. I KNEW THIS PLACE WAS—”

The bell over the door jingled again.

Chad spun around—and his face went pale.

Tina followed his gaze. A perfectly normal customer had walked in.

But Chad wasn’t seeing a normal customer.

He let out a strangled “NOPE,” shoved his phone in his pocket, and sprinted out the door.

The confused customer watched him go. “Uh… do you guys sell beef jerky?”

Tina sighed. “Middle aisle.”


---


Barry hummed. “We’ll call it an archival anomaly.”

Tina sighed. “We’re calling it ‘not my problem.’”

Barry sipped his coffee. “Semantics.”

Behind the counter, the security monitor flickered once.

The footage jumped ahead a few seconds—Tina rubbing her temples, Barry sipping his coffee.

Then, real-time caught up—Tina rubbed her temples, Barry sipped his coffee.

The screen shut off by itself.

Barry, grinning: “Loop closed.”

I've been using a popcorn popper as a coffee roaster for around a year, off and on. I got pretty good at it, but hated how messy it was, as well as how time consuming it was. 

I'm looking to upgrade to a dedicated roaster. I don't think I want the Fresh Roast options, since they still need to be supervised through the whole process. The other popular options I see on the websites selling green coffee beans are the Behmor 2000AB Plus or the Gene Cafe Drum Roaster. The main thing I am looking for is ease of use, cleanliness (I want to be able to use inside without chaff going everywhere...) and not having to watch it through the entire roast cycle. I know for each type of coffee, I'll need to fine tune to learn the best settings for what I'm trying to do, but once I figure that out, I'd love to be able to ""set it and forget it"". 

I probably go through 3ish bags of 12oz coffee beans a month, and I'd like to start roasting for some of my friends too, but I don't think I'd ever end up doing more than 5lbs a week. I usually use my Moccamaster fpr drip and have a Breville Bambino for espresso, but am using light/medium roasts, not any dark roast.

So, between those two, which should I choose? budget could potentially go up if there were much better features, but probably not more than $1k right now. Is there an option out there I should consider that isn't these two?

Thanks to all of you in advance.",2,1740764513.0,roasting,2,1.0,False

- I love the immediate getting to name your coffee shop. 
- The overall graphics are just so chill and calming 
- the music is super pretty 
- i love that you get to drawn designs 

Dislikes:
- i don’t like that the days take energy and you can’t just play. 
-while i understand it’s probably necessary in this economy, forced ads also make me sad. 
- it’s really hard for me to move cups/the milk. Like it just won’t properly drag or move unless i move the entire page, unlike GPGP where you could just hold stuff to the side and it would move. 
- Is there a recipe book? I haven’t found one, but that might be me. Apparently coffee is harder for my brain to remember than 87,000 types of pizza lol 
- I hope it gets a little easier in general. It’s kinda difficult at first, unlike how GPGP was to pick up.

The touch screen can be a little non responsive - you have to touch it a few times no matter how clean the machine is to get a setting set.
 
1. Order a 2nd Carafe as a backup - The design is cool - I was cleaning mine wrong until I broke it by pulling the rubber hose out to get rid of the build up of milk inside it. Only after attempting to repair the hose did I discover the proper way to take it apart to clean it. This still might happen but I should have watched the youtube video of how you clean that carafe.

1. Another thing to note is not to over load the bean hopper - I did this a well and jammed up the grinder and had to take the machine apart to clean the grinder and ended up with beans all over my apartment by using a shop vac in blow mode and still find beans today that hide from me. Once I cleaned the machine it worked great again.

1. If you have presets and use your custom preset as the default going back to the home page is not that clear at first, you have to hit the home button on the custom page not the home button the outside machine, so you will be hitting the button over and over again and it will do nothing but smile at your and say fuck you, press it where  we want you to press it.
 
1. You end up using a lot more water then you expect with it cleaning itself before and after - I only use pure clean 100% bottled water with no fluoride to replenish the machines bodily fluids with no filter and I end up putting in 32 Ounces of clean pure water a day into the machine for my 2 drinks and 2 cleaning cycles when it powers up and closes down.
 
1. It is well worth the money that you save going to Starbucks - you get a better product - it is faster then going to a place two times a day - your cost per at the highest level of milk and coffee is about 1 dollar for me that is 12 dollar a day savings 7 days a week with out the cost and time of travel. I calculate this machine paid for itself in just 6 months and the quality is 100% better then anything I can buy at a retail coffee location.

The first level was simply using the coffee machine to create a coffee for a typical looking scientist (white hair, white beard, old, etc.) however you need to input the correct instructions. Very vague description but it went along the lines of ""Turn machine on, bring the cup, pour coffee into the cup, turn on conveyor belt, make sure its going right, scientist gets his coffee"". If Im not wrong, you would drag the drop the instructions for this first mission

I believe the second level was using a machine arm to create a bridge or something along that line and in order to do so it would use a similar concept as the first level. I would play it during IT/Computing lessons or wet play (wet play would be when playing inside during break or lunch since it would be raining outside).

*This is a long post so just a warning

So about a week ago I matched with this woman on Hinge and we were supposed to get coffee yesterday. When waiting for her to show up on the day of the date, she accidentally goes to the wrong location since the coffee shop has more than one location. She was very apologetic. She sent me a paragraph and expressed how she still wants to go out with me and try again.

We ended up rescheduling a week from today and planning on going out in 1 week because I have spring break in between. However I have a couple of concerns that are troubling me.

First is that since we had to reschedule again, it will be another week before we meet. Which is now 2 weeks in total. I’m worried since we have to wait another week before I get back from break since I’m in college, she will lose interest. We have texted for a few days before the date yesterday, but I don’t think we both want to keep texting for that long.

Second is that if things turn out well after our first date, I’m overthinking about wanting to have a long term relationship. What I mean is that we are both college students and we go to the same city. However she is an out-of-state student and I’m graduating this spring.

I’m planning on going to law school and prior to matching with this woman, the only law schools I applied for were in the city I’m at. Which means there is a decent chance I’m going to stay in the city. This may not seem like a problem, but I’m primarily looking for a long-term relationship. Since I’m planning on going to law school, I will be living with my family outside the city during the summer. How am I supposed to have a long-term relationship when it’s almost summer? I’m not sure if people are willing to maintain contact for a couple of months with others after dating for only a month.

Also not only I’m looking for a long-term relationship, but I’m also looking for some form of intimacy. I know I’m not really describing my problem well. How am I supposed to form some type of relationship when I have only a month left of college, and then maintain that relationship until college for both of us starts in the fall?

Tl;dr Matched with woman on Hinge but I only have a month left before I graduate. I’m probably staying in the same city as she is after summer ends, but not sure long-term relationship is possible",1,1740764192.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Am I in the wrong here?,"(I used the “dating/relationships” flair because there wasn’t a “just friends” option. I hope that’s ok.)

So I’m a grad student right? And it’s a small community, so it’s basically high school again. This kind of drama happens all the time. I haven’t dealt with this kind of thing since high school, so I’m a bit baffled. So here’s what’s up:

I’ve been close friends with a woman from my class. At some point, I started sort of getting feelings, so early last semester I wrote her a letter. Nothing gushy. It was very matter-of-fact, and I gave her every opportunity to say ‘no thanks.’ She gets back to me and says she wants to meet at this local bar and talk it out. There, she says she’d rather remain friends. I took it like a champ, raised my glass, did a cheers, and we went on with our lives.

Since then, we’ve hung out like an average of 3 days a week, usually just the two of us. Nothing crazy though— concerts, drinks, coffee, studying, etc. And the whole time I’ve made every effort to be clear that, while I may have questioned my feelings in the past, I value her friendship too much to jeopardize it by, say, making moves on her. And by all accounts, she’s acknowledged that, least of all by continuing to hang out with me (she initiates most of the time).

Then comes my birthday. Me, her, some other classmates, and my brother and cousin all go to Casa Bonita (the place from South Park). If you’ve never been to Casa Bonita, it’s an experience. No one goes for the food. Usually you eat, then you go party, drink, see the shows, etc. Well all my classmates, including her, kinda just abruptly left without much explanation after eating. Her issue was that she was hungover.

It bothered me a bit, but I wasn’t mad. More confused and a little hurt that they (note: all of them, not just her) left so early. The following Sunday, I pick her up from the airport. She can tell something is off about me, so she asks, “does it have something to do with Casa Bonita?” I tell her yes, and I—as nicely as I can— explain what upset me and how it made me feel. She immediately apologizes and explains that she was hungover. She then apologizes again “without qualification.” She says something about how she probably needs to cut back on drinking, and I offer to go sober with her for February— detox a bit.

A week goes by and all seems normal. Then last weekend she suddenly stopped responding to my texts. I didn’t think much of it since she was probably busy, but I get a vibe that something is off. On Monday, when we have a class together, she moved seats to get away from me. I text her and ask her if I did something wrong, and she doesn’t respond. So I ask our mutual friend, and she confirms that she is, in fact, annoyed with me.

What annoyed her, apparently, was that, by expressing what I felt about the Casa Bonita situation, and my offering to detox with her, I had given off “controlling boyfriend vibes.” So she decided she needed space. Before I knew about the detox thing, I thought this was an overreaction to a bit of a nothingburger, but since being informed about the detox thing, I think this is maybe a little more my fault.

That being said, I’m still a bit baffled by how she handled the situation. We’ve always had very direct communication (see the letter situation above), so I figured if I ever crossed a boundary she would say something. But instead she kinda just cut me off without saying anything.

I guess the question is not “am I in the wrong here?” but rather “how much am I in the wrong here?” Is it still uncool for her to handle it this way? And what, if anything, could I do to prove that I’m only interested in a friendship and to repair things?",1,1740764127.0,Healthygamergg,7,0.67,False

I'm trying different brands from the Indian stores and different brewing techniques. Here are my best tips --
1. Best tasting coffee brands (for me) -- Suma, Narasu Udhayam. 
2. Brewing -- in a Bialetti moka pot. Makes absolutely gangsta espresso strength brew with the Indian coffee grounds. Make sure you brew at low flame and don't use too much water. (E.g., use 6-7oz water in 6oz moka pot. Makes 4-5 cups of latte)
3. Take the espresso strength brew and make a latte with sugar and lots of milk. 
4. Drink piping hot and muse on the little joys of life. Have some cookies with it if you like. 
5. Store the remaining brew in the fridge. It will taste fine for a few days, but best tasting up to day 3.

1j0d612,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1j0d612/unwanted_comments_got_to_me_today/,Unwanted comments got to me today,"I walk my two kids to school, which is a 1 mile round trip. I'm starting to struggle with walking, having constant lightening crotch due to being almost 36 weeks. I'm constantly getting asked by the other parents questions like ""Do you want a ride"" or ""why don't you drive over here?"" I choose not to drive them to school because it's only a damn mile and I'm trying to walk as much as possible to get this baby ready to go. I've always enjoyed walking, pre pregnancy I was walking close to 5 miles a day minimum. Usually the comments of how they see me struggle to walk, or asking the same questions don't really bother me. 



Today, that changed. I had just dropped the kids off in the cafeteria, and to walk home, I have to pass by the kindergarten drop off area. One of the kid's grandparents, whom I've never met or spoken to, yelled from about 15 feet away, ""GIRL, YOU'RE WADDLING!"" and then came up and started rubbing my bump, asking why I look so big, why I'm walking. She said another parent told her how far along I was. She said it so loud that a bunch of parents were just eyeballing me, I felt their stares as I walked past them on my way home.



I was so thrown off. I have very low self esteem, I don't like having much attention drawn to myself, because I am a very introverted person, I got bullied a lot growing up for my looks. Usually I would say something along the lines of ""It's rude to comment on other's bodies or touch without permission"", but today... I don't know, it just caught me off guard. Maybe it's me feeling like absolute garbage. Not sleeping or feeling self conscious about my weight gain (I've gained almost 40 pounds this pregnancy). I just didn't know how to respond. 



I had a rough morning with my kids, they didn't want to get up for school, they were bickering all morning once they were up... I was going to treat myself to a coffee and hearty breakfast at a diner near my house. Now I'm sitting in my bedroom, wiping away tears and eating an apple because I feel so terrible about how I look, how I walk. I just want to curl into a ball and hide away from the world.

I'll start by listing what I do. I've been consistantly going to the gym. I lift 3 times a week and do cardio with lighter weight training 3 times a week. I would say I spend 30 minutes on cardio and anywhere from 30 minutes-1hr on weights depending on if its cardio/weight day or just weight day. I eat 1400 calories, mostly high protein. For reference I am 5'2"". I do track and measure food. I'm a black coffee, gfuel and creatine for preworkout and water girly thats it, I'm sober so I don't drink. I have a measuring water bottle and drink 8 cups of water daily, sometimes more with sparkling water as a treat.
Now for the issue, I've been stuck at 141 lbs after losing 30lbs for quite awhile.

1j0d3sp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1j0d3sp/the_memories_i_will_miss/,The memories i will miss,"When we got lost wandering around houston. Remember we found that temple with the thrift inside of it? It had a garden with so many plants for sale. We were so young.

I think most of my favorite memories were from when we were wanderers. I miss when we found that random farmers market, and brought fancy coffee. We got a tour of the flower shop and a freebie to bring home. Wasn’t there a anime shop there as well?

I miss the woodlands. And taking that train to the last stop it would go to. We read those signs together. Racing each other. We never did end up riding the ducks.

I even miss being so poor and running out of water. So we walked 2 miles there and back to the Starbucks to bring home filtered. I miss the long ass drive to your aunts and getting a snack from the gas station. I miss when we got lost and found that town selling raw milk and fresh meats.

I miss being close and familiar. I miss being a complete family. I miss when our kid made us kiss bc she thought it was cute.

I miss watching u eat at shogun, i miss your random facts. I miss the way you got excited over hair/ bread products and i wish you could have afforded more. 

We played that one video game together? The first for me. I want to watch the show they made about it but i don’t want to finish it without you. So i guess I’ll never finish it at all.

I miss the way you looked at me. How you called me a good mom. You were so proud of me. 

I miss the warmth of your skin, and the freckles on your arms. I miss the soft curl of your hair and eating way too expensive pasta in kingwood. I miss the way you laid on my legs like a puppy. And blowing our money on snacks 

I miss deep cleaning while you took the kids to the park. How accomplished i felt and how excited i was for you to come home and feel at peace. 

I miss being embarrassed that i was waiting by the door for you. I miss promises for a cottage. I miss the way my face buzzed when we finished. And how big your bottom lip felt in my mouth.

I miss feeling so sure. With no doubt in my mind that we would be in love forever. I miss knowing for a fact that you loved me and i loved you. I miss touring the library together and when you would play guitar.

I miss seeing the mountains with you. I miss growing and changing and evolving with you. I miss knowing you would always come home. I miss worrying for your health and cooking for you and i miss the color of your eyes.

I miss when you would tell me stories about how you already loved me when you saw me first in school. I miss when we believed we were ‘soul mates’

I miss driving to nd and touring the mall and looking at the cool rocks. 

I miss washing you, i miss the day we were at mimis. It was dark and we lit candles and i cleaned you in the bath. And you told me how happy you were to be together

I miss feeding ducks at the park and long walks. I miss those little events they had and seeing your aunts family and ruining into your cousin at the heb

I miss us all squeezing into a family bath. I miss how we spent every possible waking second together. I miss running and slipping in the snow. I miss when i didnt have to log your angry outbursts. I miss when i wasn’t afraid of you. I miss when u had never hallucinated. I miss when u didn’t randomly go cold.

I miss when you told me i never had to worry. I miss when you bragged about never taking off your ring. I miss when you were so proud to be a dad and husband. I miss watching u walk through the store bearfoot, so beat from jujitsu

I have so many regrets. I wish i didn’t take you for granted. I wish i treasured you more. I wish i let you know how much i loved you more. I wish i hugged you and kissed you more. I wish i held your hand and was gentler and kinder. I wish i had the chance to do it all again. I wish i was never jealous, i wish i was never critical. I wish i had worked and helped you support us even if u begged me not to. I wish i lifted a burden of your shoulders. I wish we waited to have kids and we didn’t meet so young.

How did everything get so bad. Why did u become so evil. Why did you hate me so purely. Why were you soso miserable. Why didn’t you try to feel better and be happy. Why did i have to react by pushing you further away instead of being sweeter to pull u back in. Why wasn’t i more understanding. Why did i try to speak for you, why did i force things, why did i not just listen. 

I miss the blooming purple tree in Dayton in-front of the Brookshire. I miss how free i felt there. I miss the plant shop and the lady selling mattresses. I miss the look on your face, the relief when you told me how good it felt to be fully known and still be loved. For some reason i miss the day the power went out and i sat on the table, so hot, waiting for you. I miss walking to the library and when we watched those fireworks. They were so amazing.

Where is all this love supposed to go! I told u i would always love u and for me it was the truth. What did i do to be sentenced like this. To be damned to love you. I hate you for that, except i dont i just really want to.

Anyways. I love you ",1,1740763478.0,Divorce,0,0.67,False

1j0d1k6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PanicAttack/comments/1j0d1k6/cannot_find_closure_with_my_first_ever_panic/,Cannot find closure with my first ever panic attack.,"So I had the most traumatic episode with my body on Nov 8th 2024.  I am a generally anxious person and ever since September I was under a lot of stress as my mother went through a life-threatening situation.  Me being a doctor, had to single-handedly manage everything.  I am the eldest one in the house too. I am sure I had my energy drained at a point with caregivers fatigue.  I was always in the look out for symptoms and analyzing each and everything of what went wrong with my mother.
The day my panic attack happened, I was out with my cousin sister and had the most beautiful day. We had an extremely strong coffee in the morning for breakfast and skipped lunch. Towards evening I could sense my blood sugars dropping ( I just had an omelette/cutlet/ coffee in the morning) with tremors in hand. I stopped at a cafe and had tea ( phew, again caffeine) which was also strong with snacks.  I had a late lunch after reaching home. Towards evening my mother felt some discomfort and dizziness which made me super anxious and I did feel the regular anxiety palpitations. I took her to ER and made sure she is in safe zone ( since she was in ventilator in September for a post-op complication of TKR) I was anxious, stressed and tired. At night after reaching home, I did have dinner but I felt some kind of restlessness.  But I was okay in the sense that I talked normal, smiled, cracked jokes with my sister etc. 
I lied down to sleep after some time.  I had random aches and discomfort and was also thinking why bad things happen to me always ( regular negative thoughts) I was also checking on mother side by side. Suddenly I felt a pain in left arm. I thought to myself - will this be heart.but I corrected myself that it might be just gastritis. But the pain was a bit unsettling and I started to get palpitations. This alarmed me and I sat and checked the pulse oximeter- it showed 117 but my palpitations were going worse. I had a sudden intense fear from my stomach and I rushed upstairs to my bathroom where I had a quick bowel movement.  I felt like I am losing control and was literally praying that I shouldn't die. I started thinking if all those early heart attack reels is happening in my life. Palpitations were so bad. I checked again and it was 170. I  also had a pain in left arm which resembled a bp apparatus squeezing its cuff. I cried to my mother that i should be taken to ER immediately and my ecg must be checked asap.
It took some time to get a driver- but we got one and reached ER. HR had subsided to 130's 
Ecg was normal apart from rate induced changes. Blood work came out normal as well. 
But ever since that night, that whole week I was traumatized of what happened. And I had subsequent mini panic-attacks. 
I did a holter test too which just had normal sinus arrhythmia findings. 
Doctors confirmed it to be a panic attack. 
But sometimes I still can't come to terms with it. All the small attacks which happened after the main attack was panic for sure. 
But the main one- I still can't get a closure from it. Was it panic attack or something else. How the hell did my heart rate shoot up like that is something I still think. And some part of me believes my real panic attacks happened due to the panic for that main event. 
Even the echo taken next day was normal. 
Do you think it was a panic attack? I don't know why it didn't come all these years and now. Life after that has kinda dimmed my confidence to travel alone also. I am okay now. Still doing my job but random bodily sensations sometimes gives me a fear and also if that episode would happen again or not etc 
Any tips or insight is appreciated. ",2,1740763324.0,PanicAttack,1,1.0,False

- The calendar. I don't really understand the calendar itself. What exactly is the purpose of creating an event in it?

- Make new scenarios. I tried making one and I realized that it uses energy. Can I recover that energy with coffee or do I have to use it all and wait?

1j0cxza,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1j0cxza/how_can_i_improve_my_relationship_20f_23m/,How can I improve my relationship 20F 23M,"Disclaimer ,, yall lock in bc this is a lot. 

I, 20F, have been w my boyfriend, 23M for almost a year now. Don’t wanna give a whole lot of details bc we’re both avid Reddit users. We’ve had ups and downs,, we’ve broken up a few times etc. I put myself in therapy to address relationship trauma and the bias I have against men as well as work on healthy communication so I haven’t always been the best partner but I confidently say I make an effort to improve consistently. 
An over-arching issue I think we come back to is I am very left leaning. When we first started dating, I made that clear at the beginning. I have never hidden this. He appeared to be centrist and though a bit more conservative, we held a lot of the same opinions on political issues and human rights issues, which really just boiled down to not thinking the government should have that much of a say in everyday lives/ what people choose to do with their lives. 
Recently though, we’ve gotten in heated debates and it seems he has gone further and further right. Sometimes with conversation and pulling up numbers/facts, his opinions change. So I don’t mind this much. We as people constantly form opinions based on the information we have at the time of forming them, and we’re allowed to become more informed and change our minds. Sometimes though, it is impossible and it seems that he will blindly support certain people regardless. 
At the end of the day, to me, I think the most important thing is that he respects the fact that I don’t support the people he supports. I’ve expressed that I don’t want to watch certain clips, I don’t enjoy certain political humor (jokes that put down women, trans people, gay people, etc) and there is a consistent problem with him not respecting this boundary. 
Additionally, he becomes very cold anytime we fight. And will escalate fights for no reason at times. There were multiple arguments where it started w me agreeing with him and he just chose something to continue to argue about, or arguments where he insists I mean something that I definitely don’t. In these arguments, once it gets to a point that I feel we’re no longer effectively communicating I will end the call or ask for space, and be sure to still say I love you and goodnight in a text or before I get off the phone. Most of the time, he will just hang up on me and ghost. 
One of the times we got into an argument, I once again said I love you and goodnight and he did not respond until I outright asked him if he was too mad to say he loved me ,, to which he replied goodnight love you. The next day he was entirely passive aggressive, he would send me messages and then delete them, he even unadded me off of Snapchat and then posted on his story w some song lyrics talking about money over girls,, which I saw when he later added me back. I asked him what was up and he said I was the one being weird, and when I pointed out that I hadn’t said anything really and all this had happened he made a comment about me at least pretending to care and I should’ve asked what was wrong. Which,, when I tried to ask why he unadded me he just sent something and deleted it yet again. 
We’ve had issues in both sides,, he’s done some things that were a complete invasion of my privacy and even still had a Tinder account when we were first together for a bit. I met up w my ex when we broke up one time - nothing happened we just got coffee - and had an issue with drunk calling my ex (though not my idea and I wasn’t the one who called him, I still spoke w him) when we were arguing like this all the time and I was sure we were going to break up. 

Really I’m asking can this relationship turn into something healthy? What steps can I take to do that?

My mother guided me through all elementary and middle school, studying with me, sitting next to me so I'd do my work, and they say that's why I have it under control (most people say I can't possibly have ADHD because I pass my classes and all that).

I have chronic fatigue and I have problems focusing in class. Even after only one hour of class I can't do any work after, having to lay down or drink ungodly amounts of coffee that do nothing to me.

A doctor recommended concerta because he says people with ADHD tend to get more tired, and that combined with my chronic fatigue is terrible. I've only been on it for 4 days and I can feel more focused, and have been able to do things after class instead of doom scrolling.

The thing is I've been having real bad anxiety these last 3 days, nothing serious, as I know concerta speeds up your heart rate, but I'm worried I don't really have ADHD and that's why it's causing me anxiety, and that I shouldn't be taking it.

It’s confusing to figure out when to test. People say an hour after you wake up, but I need to drink coffee as soon as I wake up. Will coffee affect the measurement? Should I skip coffee for an hour just to get my measurement? Is another time of day better to measure my ketones? Some people say 2-3 hours after breakfast right before lunch.

1j0cu2y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j0cu2y,Rotation order arrived — comparing Savage Coffee green across different roasters,"(Bonus picture: my current bean backlog. TPC, Hydrangea, Wes Ngopi?, Exposure Therapy.)

I ordered several beans produced by Jamieson Savage to compare across roasters.

For those with less familiarity: Jamieson Savage runs both Savage Coffees and Finca Deborah. They’re particularly known for their carbonic maceration geishas, which is a processing method largely popularized in the coffee world by Sasa Sestic (known for ONA, winning WBC in 2015 with a CM coffee, the Paragon Nucleus, and fanning the flames around infused/coferment coffee drama lol). Additionally, Savage beans were used by the 3rd place winner of WBC 2024 (Terroir, which is a classic washed).

I’ve personally found CM to be similar in outcome to anaerobic processing, where it mostly amplifies existing flavors rather than introducing entirely novel ones. With that being said, there’s so much variance when it comes to processing methods that it’s hard to generalize. Overall, I find Savage coffees to be high clarity with extremely distinct notes, while remaining fairly “normal,” all things considered. 

Savage also roasts and sells his own beans through savagecoffees.co, which is based in Florida. Notably, their prices are significantly less than other roasters (50%+ at times). The general consensus seems to be that certain roasters are particularly effective at maximizing the potential of this green and thus justify the higher prices. From my experience thus far this is mostly true; however I’ve never compared the beans side by side.

I ordered the following from Rotation:
- Savage Coffees Enigma — extended natural carbonic maceration
- Savage Coffees Iridescence — washed carbonic maceration
- Datura Finca Deborah Symmetry — natural carbonic maceration
- Datura Finca Deborah Vivid — natural carbonic macerated, then washed
- Datura Finca Deborah Illumination — washed carbonic maceration

(Also got the Datura Finca Hartmann to expand my horizons, since I generally avoid natural geishas. u/dirtydials also threw in two extras from Proud Mary — thanks!)

I also currently have two Savage roasts from The Picky Chemist: Iridescence and Elipse (natural nitrogen maceration, then washed). The Picky Chemist is a Belgian roaster who is known for excellent ultralight roasts of Savage coffees, among other things. And for being quite pricey. 

I’m planning on doing head-to-head brews of the following over the next few days: 
- TPC Iridescence vs. Savage Coffees Iridescence vs. Datura Illumination — these should be the cleanest
- Datura Symmetry vs. Savage Coffees Enigma — these should be the most funky
- TPC Elipse vs. Datura Vivid — these are the two hybrid process geisha. ",6,1740762808.0,coffeerotation,4,1.0,False

I'm taking a olive oil, avacado oils somewhere in the range of 40 and 60 ml on a daily basis. I also eat low carb veggies paired with chicken and sea food.   
I also take MCT C8 oil mixed in black coffee in the range of 5 to 7 ml daily. I read from answers in chatgpt and google pages, that MCT C8 oil creates osmotic effect in your intestines which essentially means it absorbs water into your intestines followed by diarrhea. I was also taking Magnesium 500 mg every night. Upon researching that Magnesium also absorbs water into your intestines followed by severe diarrhea. I removed Magnesium 500 from my routine.   
However, its been more than 2 weeks now, that I have removed magnesium 500 from my routine. I still have the same problem, that my stomach is making gurgling sound which is followed by diarrhea.  
I also spoke to a couple of doctors about this problem, my lipase level has increased to 97 (which is mildly high). Doctors asked to reduce fat from my diet. Which would essentially break my ketosis.

**Questions:**

\* Has anyone else faced a same problem of their stomach gurgling followed by diarrhea?  
\* Is MCT C8 oil, causing the same effect? If yes, how should I take it? Should I stop taking MCT C8 oil altogether?

I'm taking a olive oil, avacado oils somewhere in the range of 40 and 60 ml on a daily basis. I also eat low carb veggies paired with chicken and sea food.   
I also take MCT C8 oil mixed in black coffee in the range of 5 to 7 ml daily. I read from answers in chatgpt and google pages, that MCT C8 oil creates osmotic effect in your intestines which essentially means it absorbs water into your intestines followed by diarrhea. I was also taking Magnesium 500 mg every night. Upon researching that Magnesium also absorbs water into your intestines followed by severe diarrhea. I removed Magnesium 500 from my routine.   
However, its been more than 2 weeks now, that I have removed magnesium 500 from my routine. I still have the same problem, that my stomach is making gurgling sound which is followed by diarrhea.  
I also spoke to a couple of doctors about this problem, my lipase level has increased to 97 (which is mildly high). Doctors asked to reduce fat from my diet. Which would essentially break my ketosis.

**Questions:**

\* Has anyone else faced a same problem of their stomach gurgling followed by diarrhea?  
\* Is MCT C8 oil, causing the same effect? If yes, how should I take it? Should I stop taking MCT C8 oil altogether?

Any suggestions would be highly appreciated!",1,1740762708.0,keto,8,0.67,False
1j0cr6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1j0cr6p/ending_a_lifetime_affair/,Ending a lifetime Affair,"I've been talking to my ex, let’s call him Nathan, since 2012. We met in our 20s, and those days were blissful—full of fun and spontaneity. No matter where life took us, we always found our way back to each other, even when we were with other people. Even when I moved over an hour away for work, Nathan would visit me, spend time with me, and show me love whenever I asked. Back then, we only lived 15 minutes apart, so those moments meant everything to me.

But he never made a move. He never asked me to be his, and I assumed he just didn’t want a relationship. To be honest, in my early 20s, I wasn’t looking to settle down either. Looking back, maybe I should have made the first move, but it is what it is.

Nathan and I have always had a bond that felt unbreakable. Whether it was texting, phone calls, or video chats, we couldn’t seem to stay apart. Deep down, I always knew he was the one. Even when I got pregnant by my now-husband, Nathan and I still couldn’t let go of each other.

The last time I saw him in person was in 2014. But we never truly lost touch. Life would get in the way, and sometimes we’d go weeks or even months without talking, but every time we reconnected, it was as if no time had passed.

October 2023
We were still texting, still emotionally supporting each other, when we finally found the courage to see each other again after nearly a decade. We met for coffee, and just like that, we were in our 20s again. The conversation was effortless. The connection was electric. The sparks were undeniable.

That day, we discovered just how much had changed. He had just gotten married. I had been married since 2021 and had a daughter. His daughter—who I remembered as a baby—was now 12 years old. Despite all of this, despite our separate lives, nothing stopped us from wanting to be together.

So we started a physical affair. And for a while, it was everything I had ever wanted.

February 2024—Now
A year into this affair, everything has changed. The way he looks at me, the way he treats me—his love, his compassion, his warmth—it has all faded. And for the first time in all these years, Nathan has made me cry more than anyone ever has.

He no longer sees us as lovers. Now, I’m just a “friend with benefits.” And as much as it breaks me, I agreed to it—just to keep him in my life. Because I don’t know how to live without him. But deep down, I know I’ve been downgraded. I feel like nothing more than his plaything, like I’m the only one making an effort. He doesn’t crave conversation anymore—just my body.

So now I’m left wondering: Why am I still here? Why am I still holding on when I feel like nothing but a burden to him?

As much as I want to believe in him, as much as I want to hold on to what we were, my heart is breaking. And I don’t know how much more I can take.

So my question to whoever is reading this is: What do I do now?

Should I send him this so I can finally end this....
👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇



""I don’t think I can do this anymore. It’s taken me a while to find the courage, but I’m finally ready to let you go. This ""friends with benefits"" arrangement is breaking me—Ive always wanted more, but you won’t let me in.

I’ve given you more than just casual affection because I love you, so deeply. But I can’t keep pouring my heart into something that isn’t being fully returned.

I know we’re both married. I know we can’t always text, call, or video chat. I get that 100% But why was it so different before? You used to find the time—until I gave you my body. Then, slowly, you started letting me go. Like I was nothing more than an inconvenience.

Over the past year, you’ve shown me a hard truth. When we first started seeing each other in person you wanted me so badly that we would video chat in the middle of the night while lying next to our significant other, not caring if we got caught. But somewhere along the way, I became too much—a burden, too needy, texting too often, having an ""attitude."" .When in reality, I've never had an attitude towards you. I've always wanted to give you my best all I ever wanted was to please you emotionally, physically, spiritually all I wanted was to make you happy so I can hear your laugh and see you smirk.

The truth is, I was just being my authentic self. I am an affectionate, emotional, passionate, loving woman who gives her heart fully and takes care of those she deeply cares for. But I see now that my love was more than you were willing to receive.

This entire relationship has revolved around your needs, your timing, and your terms. And while I appreciate the moments we did spend together, they’ve become fewer and fewer. And that hurts.

I hope things work out for you, whatever path you choose. As for me, I’ll be moving forward—I’ll be going through a divorce soon.

Take care Nathan""

If I don't get a new Swiss job, can I stay on my existing C permit until it expires, or can I convert it to a B permit?

I have a US passport and I have a resident card for Portugal, does that makes sense any difference?

So in my life, neither of us have ever done online dating whatsoever. Keep this in mind if this idea is ridiculous. 

Many complain about the nightmare that is online or app dating, matching with someone. What we thought would be a nice crossover between the old way and now is the following:

1. You're open to meeting people in your proximity. So you opt in to activating a code your phone projects to anyone nearby.
2. You live your life. People see you while you're at work, at lunch, playing mini golf with your friends, coming out of the movie theater. If someone is interested, they look at the app, which shows them all the people nearby, that have opted in.
3. They see a photo or two, but nothing else. No name, email, number, nothing. Because they showed interest first, the person they selected can see their profile and decide to return the match or not.
4. If both parties agree, their contacts are shared. But maybe the contacts are hidden in the beginning like Craigslist does for protection. Go on a couple dates and decide if you want to provide your actual number/email.

We believe what this solves is the fear most people have of asking strangers out in public. You see a kind young lady with a nice smile at the gym, but you can't ask her to coffee because everybody knows that's frowned upon.  She's there to workout, not be hit on. You see a pretty woman while she's working, again don't ever ask anyone out while they're working, it's creepy as she's forced to be there. You don't do that.

This let's you see potential suitors in your real life that you know you like their looks, friendly demeanor, personality, sense of humor, and still let them know of an interest without violating societal boundaries in the moment.

Just a reminder, the app would ONLY show you the people in your proximity for say 24 hrs and only a photo or two.  You get nothing from anybody not also looking.

[Iveron Monastery.](https://preview.redd.it/d33044x8wwle1.png?width=350&format=png&auto=webp&s=499b5ea9d7c1174ec4364b8355f4bcdca8ab62a4)

He arrived in Constantinople during the season of Pentecost and went to the representative of the Jerusalem Patriarchate to inquire concerning voyages to Jerusalem. They explained to him that if Fr. Ise wanted to await Pascha in Jerusalem, he would have to spend nearly an entire year there and this would probably fatigue him. Therefore it would be better for him to go to Athos, spend the time before winter there, and then travel to Jerusalem shortly before Great Lent. Fr. Ise realized that in contemplating going to the Holy Mountain, the kingdom of monks, he would most likely begin thinking of settling there permanently. He seriously pondered it, and so great was his resolve to serve the Lord wholeheartedly that he immediately changed his silk garments for the old tatters of a beggar. By this he hoped to conceal his former worldly state, and serve the Lord in obscurity in total self-re­nunciation. Finding a ship, he set out for Athos, and arrived on the Holy Mountain in 1819.

Arriving on Athos, Fr. Ise settled in the Iveron Monastery. Although Iveron had been founded by Georgians and at one time had been filled with his fellow countrymen, he now found none. Not knowing the Greek language, he managed to communicate with several brothers in Turkish. Since those who knew Turkish were few, Fr. Ise spent the greater part of his time in silence. He explained that he was a Georgian by birth, a poor man, which his old, soiled clothing corroborated. He said that he had come to Athos to venerate the holy objects and to see the Holy Mountain. According to custom they led him to the guesthouse, where he spent a week attending church services and observing monastery life.

Silently walking around the monastery, Fr. Ise attentively observed the inner way of life of an idiorrhythmic monastery, but the idiorrhythmic rule did not appeal to him and he said to himself, ""Although this is our monastery, yet it is not for me!"" One morning he walked outside the monastery gates and noticed that several of the brothers were lifting sacks over their shoulders and leaving for somewhere. Fr. Ise learned from them that they were going to Dionysiou Monastery for their patronal feast, the Nativity of St. John the Forerunner, which was to take place the next day. When he asked if they would take him, they replied, ""If you would like, let's go.""

Traditionally, everyone who comes to an Athonite monastery for a feast day first goes to the guesthouse. Here everyone is treated to a small liqueur, a cup of Greek coffee, and cold water. Then the pilgrims proceed to the refectory for a meal before the vigil. For Fr. Ise, however, things turned out differently. While entering the monastery he lost his traveling companions in the crowd of people. They, forgetting that he was unfamiliar with the local customs, neglected to look for him. Fr. Ise had not eaten anything all day and was exceedingly hungry. Not expecting that someone would invite him to the refectory and, hearing that they were already ringing for the All-night Vigil, he went to church amidst a group of pilgrims. He assumed that, for the sake of the memory of the great prophet John the Baptist, it was a strict fast day in the monastery, and the brothers were also not eating anything.

The length of the service amazed him, for the night was past and the vigil continued on. It ended only two hours after sunrise. Fr. Ise pondered: Would they offer anything to eat? Would they continue fasting now, too?

But then Liturgy began. Only afterwards did everyone go to the refectory, and Fr. Ise followed behind everyone. The feast day served as a great spiritual consolation. He liked the order of services, the way of life of the monks, and the strictness and harmony in everything so much that he wanted to remain in the monastery.

On the third day of the feast the guestmaster asked Fr. Ise why he was not leaving with the others. He replied that he would like to spend more time at the monastery observing the rule of life, and the guestmaster told him he must obtain the blessing of the abbot to do this. Fr. Ise went to the abbot—who spoke Turkish well—and explained to him that he liked the strict order of Dionysiou and wished to live there and observe their life, for which he was now asking a blessing. If it pleased the abbot to accept him, then he was prepared to remain there permanently. Abbot Stephen, seeing his bodily strength, agreed to accept him, saying that he needed working hands. He gave him an obedience to work in the kitchen.

At Dionysiou Fr. Ise found his old friend, Fr. Benedict the Georgian,\[9\] who was living close to the monastery in a hermitage. During Great Lent in 1821 they received the tonsure to the great schema together. At the tonsure, Fr. Ise received the name of Hilarion. Although tonsured first, Fr. Hilarion always considered Fr. Benedict as his senior, especially in regard to ascetic labors. New monastic garments had been prepared for the tonsure, but Fr. Hilarion refused them and asked to be clothed in his tattered robes.

Besides laboring in the kitchen and refectory, Fr. Hilarion was given all the difficult obediences. He was sent to cultivate the monastery vineyards at Monoxilitis located not far beyond the boundary of Athos. He always chose those tasks which were most laborious and difficult there. At the vineyards he took the heaviest and largest shovel, embedded it deep in the ground, and dug in such a way that no one could imitate him. Likewise, he untiringly bore all his obediences in the monastery, being endowed by the Lord with both physical strength and zeal for ascetic labors.Even though he did not know Greek, the brothers loved Fr. Hilarion for his exemplary love of labor and his meek and ascetic life. Living in Dionysiou under the guise of a poor, simple Georgian and possessing absolutely nothing, Fr. Hilarion never locked his cell. Once, one of the brothers went into his cell during his absence and, seeing a tin container, became curious and opened it. To his utter astonishment he found a Russian passport and an imperial Turkish decree indicating that the bearer was a priest. He immediately told the abbot, who summoned Fr. Hilarion and asked him what he kept in the tin container. Fr. Hilarion replied that it was his passport. The abbot ordered him to bring the documents to him. Fr. Hilarion, hoping that no one knew how to read Russian and Turkish, brought them to the abbot. To his great sorrow, one monk read Turkish and was able to read the imperial decree. Thus, they all learned he was a priest. Fr. Hilarion persuaded the brothers not to speak to anyone of this.

Fr. Hilarion spent about two years carrying out difficult obediences with love and self-denial. However, he was troubled that, in not knowing Greek, he was deprived of hearing the word of God. His soul languished from not reading the Sacred Scriptures. Therefore, Fr. Hilarion decided to reveal his thoughts to the abbot and seek a blessing to go to the Iveron Monastery, where he would ask for a few of the many books in the Georgian tongue. The abbot blessed him, and Fr. Hilarion set out for Iveron in his customary old and soiled raiment.

Reaching Iveron, he stopped to pray before the wonderworking icon of the Theotokos.\[10\] It was evening then, and the senior brethren were sitting in the portico at the entrance to the monastery. Among them was that very archimandrite with whom Fr. Hilarion had become acquainted while still in Moscow. As soon as he saw Fr. Hilarion, he immediately recognized him. To the astonishment of everyone, he rushed up to him and began kissing his shoulders and hands, exclaiming all the while, ""Oh! Oh! Papa Ise, Papa Ise! The holy confessor! The royal confessor!"" Bewildered by such an extraordinary greeting, everyone stood up and approached the visiting monk. The archimandrite, holding Fr. Hilarion by the hand, introduced him to the fathers, saying, ""This is Fr. Ise—the royal confessor, whom I had the pleasure of meeting in Moscow in the palace of the Queen of Imeretia."" The astonished monks led him into the monastery, where everyone was amazed at such an unexpected revelation, especially those brethren who had seen him as a poor newcomer two years earlier. The archimandrite led Fr. Hilarion to his quarters and for three days would not let him go, begging him to remain in their monastery. He offered Fr. Hilarion the best cells at the monastery's expense with attendants. But being convinced that Fr. Hilarion would remain unbending, he gave him the Georgian books and sorrowfully let him depart.

With a sack on his shoulders, Fr. Hilarion returned to Dionysiou, not suspecting that his true identity had already become known there. The rumor that a royal confessor was hiding at Dionysiou under the guise of a simple monk had already spread across Athos. At the monastery entrance the porter respectfully prostrated before him, greeted him as an elder and informed the abbot. The latter met him with outstretched arms, reproaching him in a brotherly way for not revealing his identity earlier. Fr. Hilarion, troubled by such a reception, said, ""My visit to Iveron was not to my benefit. It would have been better if I had not gone there, for I came to the Holy Mountain to weep over my sins, and it was more peaceful in ignominy for me than it is now.""

The abbot no longer wished to allow him to fulfill his previous obediences, but asked him to take upon himself the duty of confessor. Fr. Hilarion, however, resolutely refused this, and insistently asked that they not deprive him of the opportunity to serve the brothers. He proceeded to the kitchen, but soon departed, for the respect of all followed him everywhere. The brethren would not let him fulfill his former difficult obediences, but attempted in every way possible—lifting loads, carrying water and firewood—to forestall the elder. This came to an end when he left the kitchen and took up his abode in a secluded cell near the monastery.

**5. Confession of the Faith**

In 1821, as a result of the Greek Insurrection, the Turks began a series of reprisals and persecutions. Christian blood flowed like a river, for the Turks wanted to put down the uprising and suppress the revolt by force of arms. As Athos had also supported this uprising, it too was subjected to the grievous consequences of war. In 1822 the ruler of Thessalonica, Abdul Robut Pasha, marched toward Athos from Cassandra with a large army and made camp at Kumitsa at the Isthmus near the border of Athos.

The pasha then sent an order that the superior of every monastery must appear before him in repentance. In case of their refusal, he vowed to occupy the Holy Mountain and destroy the monasteries. The abbots, knowing the Turks' cruelty and fanaticism, evoked at the time by the uprising, decided not to appear before the pasha, well aware that they would not remain among the living.

Abbot Stephen of Dionysiou Monastery, fearing to appear personally before the pasha, asked Fr. Hilarion to take his place. Fr. Hilarion gladly agreed to his request, saying, ""I am not afraid of the Turks!"" But the abbot warned him that this time the matter was not so simple. When the envoys would depart to meet the pasha, then all the brothers would leave the monasteries, taking with them all the valuables and holy objects—for which they had boats waiting. This would not go unobserved by the Turks, and they of course, in revenge for this trickery, would kill the envoys. Consequently, certain death awaited him. Fr. Hilarion exhibited his complete willingness for anything, as he had long desired to suffer martyrdom for Christ. The abbot said, ""Now is the most timely opportunity—take advantage of it for the common good."" Two others, Hieromonk Panteleimon and another monk, accompanied Fr. Hilarion.

Reaching Kumitsa, the envoys presented themselves before the pasha with a letter from the Holy Community\[11\] in which the representatives of the monasteries were named. The pasha began to read, and when he reached the name of Fr. Hilarion the Georgian he stopped, glanced at the fathers, and asked which one was the Georgian. Then, addressing Fr. Hilarion in Georgian, the pasha discovered that Fr. Hilarion lived in the province neighboring his native land, Abkhazia. In fact they had lived in adjacent towns, and Fr. Hilarion knew the pasha's home quite well. The pasha turned out to be the son of an Orthodox priest. In his youth he had been taken captive, sold to Turks and converted by them to Islam.

""So, we're fellow countrymen,"" said the pasha. ""How long have you lived here and why did you come?""

The elder answered, ""I came in order to pray to God, and I've lived here three years.""

The pasha then began to speak to Fr. Hilarion in Turkish: ""Why did you come to join these thieves? Why have you, an honorable and noble human being, become mixed up with these scoundrels?"" Mercilessly upbraiding Athos and its monks, the pasha meanwhile tried to persuade Fr. Hilarion to abandon the Holy Mountain, presenting him with many arguments. Among other things he related that he had come with the intention of killing all the monks of Athos, but pitying him as a man of nobility and a compatriot, he did not want to subject him to such a lot. Attempting to convince Fr. Hilarion to abandon Athos, he offered him his home near Thessalonica, every protection, assistance, and money from the sultan to settle wherever he liked—even in his homeland. Fr. Hilarion, however, replied that he had come to Athos to save his soul and, besides, he needed nothing.

The pasha again attempted to persuade him to abandon Athos—this ""nest of prodigality and thievery."" But Fr. Hilarion rejected this proposal and said about the Athonite fathers: ""No, these are honorable people and true servants of God. Look how dishonorably you have proceeded. You have forsaken the true Christian Faith. Now, to crown your grievous errors and perdition, you are marching armed with weapons against Christ's followers, spilling their innocent blood and capturing Christian youths by force, so as to lead them into apostasy—into the same destruction."" The pasha in reply implicated the Athonite monks in the uprising against the Turkish authorities, and in inciting all the inhabitants to this end. Regarding the capture of the Athonite youths, he said that they could serve the government with benefit and need not be buried in the wilderness.

Then the pasha began to blaspheme the Orthodox Faith, stating, ""What folly it is for a Christian to believe that a virgin gave birth to God. How could a human womb contain God, and having given birth remain virgin?"" To this Fr. Hilarion objected, ""You do not understand the mystery of the Incarnation of God the Word. The understanding of this is the gift of God, and whosoever has it understands how a virgin can give birth to the Redeemer of the world! But, I will explain it to you."" At these words the pasha was moved to wrath and began to pace quickly back and forth before his tent. The remaining monastery envoys, understanding that this conversation would not lead to any good, inconspicuously moved Fr. Hilarion back and quietly said to him, ""Now is not the time for these arguments, because you might anger the pasha and provoke him to the extent that not only you, but all who remain on the Holy Mountain will be put to death or torture. If you don't pity yourself, then at least have pity on the holy fathers of Athos who will meet such a grievous fate."" Having convinced Fr. Hilarion by their words, they spoke with the pasha and handed him the gifts they had brought.

The pasha allowed Fr. Hilarion to go wherever he pleased, but he incarcerated the remaining representatives in the prison in Thessalonica. He sent the Athonite youths also to Thessalonica for preparation to embrace Islam—there were more than three hundred of them. The pasha himself went to Njegosh, a city beyond Thessalonica, where a revolt had recently taken place; there he killed a multitude of Christians.

Upon returning to Athos, Fr. Hilarion grieved that he had not successfully countered the pasha's blasphemous words. The latter remained as it were the victor. He sorrowed even more upon hearing of the pasha's bestial deeds in Njegosh. Aflame with godly zeal, he implored Abbot Stephen to permit him to go to Thessalonica for a talk with the pasha. The abbot asked him if he had within him enough courage and strength, and if he was capable of enduring prolonged tor­ture and death itself. Fr. Hilarion replied that he was ready for anything with God's help; even in Kumitsa he had sought this, having begun to reproach the pasha, but they would not let him finish. Abbot Stephen unhesitatingly blessed him, wishing him the aid of the Lord and the Theotokos. Having asked the prayers of the brothers, Fr. Hilarion went on foot to Thessalonica and arrived during the Muslims' Ramadan, during which the Turks fast by day but make merry after sunset.

At the gates of the pasha's residence, the elder asked the guard to inform the pasha that Hilarion the Georgian wished to speak with him. Inside, the chief Turkish functionaries had gathered as well as several foreign dignitaries: English, French, Jewish, and Armenian. Evening was close and they would soon begin their banquet. When they informed the pasha of Fr. Hilarion's arrival, he said for all to hear, ""Oh! It's that priest whom I convinced of the emptiness of the Christian belief, and he has come here to receive the faith of the great prophet. Summon him!""

At the summons, Fr. Hilarion entered. Seeing the pasha seated on a divan and all his functionaries standing before him, he paid him his due respect. The pasha with joy addressed him, ""Oh! Papa Hilarion! Welcome! You have obviously come as a consequence of our conversation about the faith?"" ""Yes,"" replied Fr. Hilarion, ""it was chiefly your words that caused me to come straight here to speak with you in detail, since in Kumitsa they wouldn't let me finish our conversation. For me it is a pleasure that at this time I find the first citizens of Thessalonica here with you."" ""It's my pleasure also,"" said the pasha, ""to meet and speak with you on this day of our feast.""

Then he sat Fr. Hilarion beside himself on the divan while all the respected citizens continued to stand before them. Fr. Hilarion then began where their conversation had been interrupted: ""You expressed doubt as to how the Virgin could give birth to God, and having given birth, could still remain virgin? So I will explain this to you, for both you and your prophet Muhammad say that Jesus Christ was born from the Virgin, was born from a seedless conception, and therefore His Nativity as the true God is inscrutable. He is the true God and for the salvation of mankind He took upon Himself flesh that He might redeem the fallen race of mankind from the curse of death.""

The pasha, realizing that the elder was steadfast in all his convictions, started an argument with him, during the course of which Fr. Hilarion brought up the pasha's cruelty in Njegosh and said, ""Don't you fear God, torturing Christians innocent of any wrongdoing? You were born of Christian parents, and yet you act so bestially so as to quell the torment of your conscience because of your apostasy from Christ.""

The pasha, laughing, replied, ""Just the contrary, I was so happy that I was delivered from the ludicrous faith of the Christians, that later, when I was already a pasha, and when the man who had stolen me from my parents and sold me to the Turks came to me, I gave him a baksheesh \[reward\]. I thanked him that he had done me a great service. If your faith was true and pleasing to God, then the Lord would not have given you into the hands of your enemies and they would not be treading you down always and everywhere.""

Fr. Hilarion objected to these proud words: ""You understand everything incorrectly, Pasha. Does a father not take a rod to chastise his beloved son when he misbehaves? But he does this not to turn his son away from his heart, but to correct him. When he sees that the child has corrected himself, then he breaks the rod and casts it into the fire. Likewise, the Lord has used you to scourge us for our sins, desiring and seeking our amendment. You are an iron rod in God's right hand, and when the Lord sees our amendment, He will cast this rod into the place appointed for it, as a thing no longer needed.""

Then he began to upbraid the pasha for the youths he had captured on Athos. The pasha continued to listen to his reproaches without wrath, but when the day reached evening the elder was unable to speak any longer. The pasha offered him lodging, but Fr. Hilarion, seeking not repose but martyrdom, refused the pasha's offer. He passed the entire night in the courtyard, hoping to attain his goal on the following day.

Three days passed in this way, with the elder reproving and reviling the pasha in the hope of compelling him to order his martyrdom. Still, the pasha remained unmoved. Fr. Hilarion spent the second night in the home of a certain God-loving Christian named Spandoni, who together with his whole family showed the elder warm hospitality.

On one of these nights, while Fr. Hilarion was praying in preparation for his martyrdom, an armed Turk entered the house. At that time it was permissible to kill any Christian. Therefore, the Turk unsheathed his sword and wanted to strike the praying elder, saying, ""I'll cut you up."" However, brandishing the sword, he was unable to carry out his intention—his hand was as it were petrified, and somehow restrained. Holding the sword for a long time in the air, he was only able to lower it when he decided to return the sword to the scabbard without harming the elder.

On the fourth day, Fr. Hilarion tried even harder to anger the pasha. He began to speak about the falsehood of Islam and of its founder Muhammad. Calling him a deceiver, he stated that not only had he perished, but also everyone who believes in him will perish.

""Where do you think we will go?"" the pasha asked, laughing.

""The same place where your Muhammad will go!"" answered the elder.

""And where is that?""

""To hell!"" answered Fr. Hilarion, ""—and you along with him!""

""Who, according to you, will be saved and go to heaven?""

""Only those who truly believe in God, who are found in the bosom of the Orthodox Faith of Christ; beside this, everyone—Jews, Armenians,\[12\] Catholics and Protestants—will be condemned to torment.""

Then everyone who was in the room cried out in wrath, ""Death to him!"" At these cries it was impossible for the pasha to remain indifferent any longer. He did not desire the elder's death, but in order not to be reckoned an apostate from Muhammad's law he ordered Fr. Hilarion's head to be cut off. ""Look, you have brought this upon yourself; I no longer have any power to defend you. Because of your daring words your head will roll from your shoulders!""

Fr. Hilarion, baring his head, lowered it and said, ""Well, cut it off! I do not fear to die for the truth. He held his head that way until the executioner came to lead him to the place of execution.

While preparations for carrying out the sentence were taking place a pair of Abkhazian bodyguards, whom the pasha loved for their faithfulness and devotion, came to him. He told them of his decree to execute the Georgian priest. Dumbfounded, they clasped their hands, crying out, ""This cannot happen, this cannot come to pass! This is a disgrace to us. We would never be able to appear in the city. Hardly had one of our compatriots appeared in this region, they will say, and they executed him. This will be our eternal shame."" Not wishing to grieve his beloved friends, the pasha gave Fr. Hilarion over to their disposal.

The people streamed after Fr. Hilarion and the executioner: Christians and Turks and a multitude of Jews. Walking along the streets, the crowd continued to grow, and at the central square there was such a crowd thronging them that it was impossible to proceed. Fr. Hilarion walked firmly. Neither on his face nor in his movements was a shadow of fear to be seen. Whispering his prayers, he appeared joyful, as if walking to a wedding feast. The bodyguards, having received the pasha's permission, hurriedly went to the square. Squeezing their way through the crowd, they met Fr. Hilarion at the place of execution. In the name of the pasha they took him from the executioner's hands and led him away, the people following after them.

Fr. Hilarion thought that they had changed the place and manner of his execution and were leading him to the gallows, and thus he obediently walked behind his guides, continuing to offer prayer. But the farther they led him, the more bewildered he became. They had gone quite far; they had walked along the streets and through courtyards. In every square he expected that there his punishment would be meted out. In the meantime they led him ever further and further away in the direction along which he had come from Athos. The people, who had been persistently following him, were stopped by the sentry at the city gates. The Abkhazian officials led Fr. Hilarion out of the city, and when he was already far from the city, one of them hit him on the back of the head with such force that he nearly hit the ground face first. They said to him, ""Get going to your Athos, Priest, and don't show your face here again.""

Getting up, Fr. Hilarion slowly walked a short distance and glanced back. Both officials stood on the same spot and, threatening him, cried out that he should walk without looking back. Walking quite far, he looked back one more time and saw them standing on the same spot menacingly shaking their fists at him. Soon they were no longer visible. Then Fr. Hilarion, crossing himself, sighed and said, ""I, the wretched one, am not worthy that the Lord would receive from me the sacrifice of martyrdom."" He quietly started down the road for Athos. Remembering the love of that Christian who had given him lodging, he decided to return and thank him for the shelter and his generosity. Spandoni, meeting the elder again, would not let him go on foot to Athos, but gave him a horse and a guide.

**6. Ministry to the Imprisoned**

[Old Thessalonika.](https://preview.redd.it/wuzrsy5cwwle1.png?width=488&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff0b53dfec35b76597f632ee88cce1a9749f5eea)

Returning to Athos with the guide, Fr. Hilarion went en route to Thessalonica. Having passed through the entire city, they had already reached the last outlying streets when they suddenly heard a voice: ""Father, Father!"" Fr. Hilarion looked around but did not see anyone. The voice again called him. Then in the wall of a nearby building he saw a small window and from it someone was waving and calling him to come. In this building there were incarcerated, along with common criminals, Christians—chiefly Athonite monks—because of their involvement in the Greek Insurrection.

The prisoners were languishing from hunger and thirst. When Fr. Hilarion drew close to the window, the hand that had waved at him showed itself again, holding a cup. A voice from the prison asked him to bring water. Fr. Hilarion fulfilled the man's request, but just then another hand appeared with a cup and the same request, then one hand after another reached out. The elder fulfilled everyone's request joyfully and, when he learned who was being held captive there, he decided to stay and serve the prisoners.

He dismissed his escort, sending him back with the horse. He reasoned that the Lord had left him among the living precisely that he might minister to these unfortunate ones. Every day the elder came to the prison and brought them what they requested: bread, water and other food.

One of the Turkish guards, noticing this, wanted in his wrath to kill Fr. Hilarion. The elder, not being frightened in the least, was ready with joy to meet death at the hands of the angry Turk. But about the same time, the other guard awoke and stopped him with these words: ""Don't touch him, let him bring things. Look, neither you nor I nor any one of us has given them bread; we were not posted to starve them to death, but only to guard them. So if he has such fervor, let him feed them and let us not hinder him.""

Fr. Hilarion spent six months in this manner helping the prisoners. In a separate ward in the same prison, two prisoners hung from ropes. One was a Christian and the other was a rich Turkish banker, from whom the pasha, by trial and torture, was trying to extort money for the needs of the government. These two prisoners had been hung by the hands and feet so that at the slightest movement the ropes would swing from side to side. Special guards were assigned to them, who kept their guns always loaded and their swords bared, not allowing anyone to come close to the unfortunate ones. They were given neither food nor drink, as they had been sentenced to starve to death in this frightful manner.

It was a warm day and the men suspended in the air were tormented by unbearable thirst. Their lips were parched and cracked. Fr. Hilarion, who often happened to be in the prison, concentrated all his attention on how he might help these two unfortunate men—but any attempt might cost him his life. Filling a flask with water and grabbing two large pears, Fr. Hilarion began to wait for an opportune moment to approach them. Then, at one point he noticed that both sardari \[guards\], who stood with bared swords and loaded guns, had leaned back against the wall and fallen asleep. To everyone's astonishment, the elder quietly made his way between the guards without waking them—despite the narrow passage. Approaching one of the suspended men, he poured a little water down his throat, then gave a little to the other, and having repeated this three times, he placed in the mouth of each a pear. The Turkish banker, seeing the elder's self-denial, said, ""May Allah reward your good deed! But get out quickly so that the guards don't cut you to pieces."" All the prisoners watched Fr. Hilarion in trepidation. Having accomplished this task, the elder hastened to depart. Returning past the guards, in spite of his caution, he nevertheless bumped one of the sleeping guards and they both awoke. But the Lord, who had brought sleep upon them, wondrously protected Fr. Hilarion: for having awoken and seen the elder's action, they remained immobile. Standing there stupefied, they did nothing to the elder. This act of his saved the unfortunate men from death, sustaining their vital strength.

After the elder's departure for Athos, a relative of the Turkish banker went before the pasha and obtained his release. The banker told everyone about the elder's deed and said, ""Point him out to me, give him to me! I will gild him, I will cast his image in gold and bow down before him as my savior!""

Soon after this incident, Fr. Hilarion came to the prison to part with his friends, informing them that on the previous evening he had been informed by God to abandon his ministry to the prisoners and set out for Athos. He would never have left of his own accord, but, obedient to God's decree, he had to go. He found a man to replace him in serving the prisoners, and the God-loving Spandoni agreed to pay for his labor. Fr. Hilarion explained his work to him and, having parted with everyone, set out on his way. The day after the elder's departure, everyone learned that the pasha had ordered the executioner to cut off his head. Then all the prisoners glorified God, Who protects His servants—and their sorrow over the elder's departure was turned to joy.

Like a lot of guys here, I find myself lacking solid male companionship and lately, really missing the opportunity to hang out in person and share life with another dude. I know finding the right bro is a long shot, but fingers crossed...

About me:  
I'm 55, married (26 years yesterday), a tech professional (second career) and servant to two spoiled chihuahuas. I love travel, which has mostly consisted of cruises since we moved to Florida. I have some nerdy hobbies... 3D printing, Legos, flying my drones. I always have at least one book going and I'm all over the place with my reading preferences. I'm a foodie and would-be coffee snob and have the body type to prove it. I have a bit of a passion for snorkeling and love getting face-down in the ocean. It would be a shame to live in Florida and not be a fan of theme parks. Right now I only have Busch Gardens passes, but I really miss the parks in Orlando. I'm open minded and tend to be an open book (probably even when I shouldn't) and I love getting to know people.

What I'm looking for in a bro:  
Somewhere close to Tampa Bay/Central Florida. Probably age 30-60 just for sake of shared life experience. A conversationalist who's able to respond with more than a word or two. If your only interests are sports or working out or having your face in front of a TV or in a video game, I'm probably not the bro for you. I wouldn't expect contact all day, every day, but at the very least a least a few times a week so we could get to know each other.

Also someone who appreciates my 14-year-old sense of humor and who's willing to talk about everything from the kind of chips you like to your secret hopes and dreams and anything and everything in between. If we click, I'd love the possibility of meeting over coffee or lunch, a walk through Lettuce Lake or Lake Parker or Shingle Creek. Maybe a trip to Shangri-La to chill out. Maybe a road trip to Riviera Beach some day to snorkel...

I'm not looking for romance. I'm good in that department. And not really interested in just a NSFW friendship. I don't give a flip about your sexuality or ethnicity or your body type or the car you drive. And because I'm busy with work and family commitments, IRL fun probably won't be frequent. But when the opportunity presents, I'd really like to have a close friend I could spend time with in person. If you've read this far, enjoy my long-windedness and like the way this sounds, hit me with a DM.",2,1740762327.0,NextBestBro,0,1.0,False
1j0clf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stomachcancer/comments/1j0clf9/what_were_your_first_symptoms/,What were your first symptoms?,"Hello everyone, I am in need of some advice to possibly calm my nerves. I've struggled with health complications my entire life but the past 4 months have been absolute hell. I've had extreme bouts of nausea that last weeks at a time where I feel like I need to vomit but can't. It would get much worse when I would lay down or bend forward. It feels like there is a cold sensation in my stomach. Just over a month ago my symptoms got even worse. (Apologies if this is TMI - so possible TW) I started getting sick and there was blood in my vomit. Some looked like coffee grounds, some was fresh blood. My brother took me to the ER and they did an ultrasound of my abdomen. Once the Dr reviewed the imaging he ordered an endoscopy after which he told me there were ulcers in my stomach and esophagus, that I had internal bleeding, and a Hiatal Hernia. They admitted me to the hospital and gave me three units of blood during a blood transfusion because my blood pressure was so low 84/45. They had me on a clear liquid diet for three days, once I was given the go ahead to have solid food I became incredibly nauseous and had stomach pain that almost felt like a wave of pain that went from my stomach up to my sternum and back down.The Dr told me the ulcers could be caused by stress, H-Pylori, or possibly cancer. Because my blood pressure improved from the transfusions and because I actually ate something other than broth, juice, and ice, they discharged me from the hospital. They gave me a prescription for Prilosec and told me not to stress because it could cause the ulcers to get worse. Once I got the biopsy results 2 weeks later I tested negative for H-pylori. Since then nothing has improved. I'm still getting nauseous, I hardly have any appetite, when I eat I get full quickly and the stomach pain gets worse. 

Since googling my symptoms always leads to results for stomach cancer I made an appointment with my primary care Dr. About 2 years ago when I first met her I told her I was concerned that I'm losing weight without trying to, that cancer runs in my family, and how I'm riddled with tumors because I have Neurofibromatosis (T1). The Dr was convinced I had an eating disorder and all my problems would be solved if I just ate more. I am on the small side, I am 5ft 0 and about 90-95lbs but I do not have an ED. She had me keep a food journal and when I gave it to her she rolled her eyes and told me, ""If I'm not going to be honest, this isn't going to work"". Fast forward to today and the symptoms I've been experiencing she started to believe me when I said something was wrong with me. She ordered a CT scan and an MRI both of which have to be approved by my insurance so I have to wait a few more weeks before I can get that imaging done. I don't have high hopes for the results because unfortunately for me because I have NF1 any time a tumor is seen in any previous imaging the Dr just assumed it was a neurofibroma and left it at that, no further testing or biopsies. 

I have never felt like this before, it feels like my body is shutting down. When I walk short distances I get winded, my heart races, I feel incredibly weak. When I lived out in the boonies and couldn't drink the well water I used to be able to haul 8 gallons of water at a time and now I can hardly lift one. I am freezing cold all the time despite working in a bakery and being around hot ovens all day. 

Has anyone else experienced something similar to my symptoms? Being told not to stress while being left in the dark as far as a diagnosis goes is something I have been struggling with. 

I absolutely hate feeling like this, I feel like a burden to my brother because he has to drive me to my appointments, help me get/unpack groceries, carry anything too heavy for me, etc. other than that the not knowing what is wrong with me is stressing me out to the point I am almost afraid to know what is wrong with me. 

If anyone is still with me here, thank you for reading my rambling. ",1,1740762237.0,stomachcancer,2,1.0,False

Since it’s still cold, we’re skipping the beaches and focusing on food, history, and sightseeing. We’re **not much of hikers** (my wife can’t do long-distance hikes), but we enjoy scenic drives, cultural sites, and great food.

We're also debating **whether to rent a car** or if we can manage with taxis and public transport. **Would it be worth renting a car just for a trip to Lake Kournas, or is public transport a better option?**

* **Flight to Athens**

# Questions:

1. **Is 4 days, 3 nights enough?** Or should we extend to 5 days, 4 nights?
2. **Should we rent a car, or is public transport/taxis enough?** Mainly for Lake Kournas or other scenic spots.
3. **Any must-visit places outside Chania Old Town?** We’d love more cultural or scenic recommendations that don’t involve long hikes.
4. **Dinner recommendations for our last night (March 14)?**
5. **Any other activities or experiences that would fit our trip?**

Welcome one, welcome all! This is the series where we use amateur math to figure out how much every combatant is owes the people they weren't trying to kill! Today is the season that explains why we don't do 20-episode seasons anymore, Season 7!

**RULES:**

1. Human lives cannot be measured in value. If you kill someone, you’re charged with time, not money. Therefore we will only be pricing inanimate objects and nature.
2. We’ll only be counting onscreen damage caused by a combatant. 
3. This is for COLLATERAL DAMAGE, meaning it measures things which DON’T BELONG to the combatants. Any weapons, armour or allies will not be charged unless they are not the property of the combatants. 
4. Combatants will only be charged for the collateral they cause. We’ll charge both if it was vague on who did it or if it was a collective effort (If they chose to destroy a thrown object when they could have dodged).
5. Fixed damages will not be charged, even if it’s not explained how it was fixed. 
6. Unless otherwise specified, I’ll assume every forest is protected land. Pricing things like trees and rocks is pretty hard so I’ll be fining the character what I think are appropriate or average fines instead.
7. For continental destruction, because an entire country has never blown up in a single blast before, I’ll say it would take five times their GDP when the episode came out to rebuild.
8. Cosmic destruction is subjective. You can’t really buy celestial objects. People have tried to calculate the value of Earth, so I’ll use that number for all planets, multiplying when necessary.
9. Everything is subjective and there are different ways to measure things. I’ll be rounding up and down numbers so take them with a grain of salt. Also, I’m Canadian, so there will be some conversions which might screw things up. 
10. If you have a better estimation for any of these or if I missed something, let me know and I’ll be happy to redo them.

**THE FOLLOWING WILL NOT BE PRICED DUE TO LACK OF ACTUAL COLLATERAL:**

RED VS BLUE

**THE FOLLOWING WILL NOT BE PRICED FOR THESE REASONS:**

BLACK CANARY VS SINDEL - I could theoretically price this one, however, this tournament’s owner is Shao Kahn, Sindel’s wife. And she likely owns a lot of the property here too as Queen, so this is a matter that would be settled between combatants.

GRAY VS ESDEATH - This depends on if you count covering a country in snow as damaging it. I don’t. Not only because there’s no frame of reference for how much that would cost, but this country does not exist and therefore doesn’t have a 2020 GDP I can look up.

GORO VS MACHAMP - This is Goro’s property.

FLASH VS SONIC - Whatever they broke through, I highly doubt it’s made of material you can buy online. 

SHE-RA VS WONDER WOMAN - This fight takes place on Themyscira, where Wonder Woman is very important and likely owns most of what’s broken. 

THE SEVEN ROYALE - According to Wiz, the apartment blocks were “sanctioned.” Generously assuming that Vought was being honest and that one guy who died was out of laziness, that means collateral was expected and falls under the responsibility of a company that isn't on the tierlist. 

WINTER SOLDIER VS RED HOOD - This is Jason’s property, I assume.

# AND NOW, IT'S TIME FOR A DEBT BATTLE!

**SPIDER-MAN VS STATIC**

What better way to start a season than with someone getting thrown into what I’ll assume is concrete. I estimate this dent is about 23 square feet. Spider-Man makes a second one which I’ll put at 18. The slicing of a building’s side is a lot bigger. I’ll put it at a clean 100. And for Vergil’s last building-wrecking attack, I’ll assume he took Morales 0.0113636 Miles (or 60 feet) up with a 3-foot-wide impact, or 180.

I won’t count the “flying pizza tray” but I will count the entire ventilation system just on Static, since Spidey didn’t really have a choice on how to get out of it. And this one’s actually interesting, Vergil causes a seemingly city-wide blackout for, at the very least, 40 seconds. 

We’ll start with the vent. Given the size of them and the fact that they’re from a tall commercial building, I’ll assume they’re about $20,000. Could be more, could be less.

The blackout is the real kicker here and where we’ll be making our big estimations. According to my research, the people most likely to sue Static are Data Centers. I found a Vertiv document saying that even small outages cost Data Centers (on average) $17,000 per minute. Taking this literally and making assumptions about this location AND how long it lasted, Vergil cost every Data Center in New York $11,333. And that’s between 392 centers!

Alone, this would get him $4,442,536. But I’m going to round it to 5 million to account for any additional lawsuits or damages he could’ve accidentally caused while the power was out. Plus it could be more if he took longer to undo the blackout.

First Hole - ($15 x 23) = $345 (SM)

Second Hole ($15 x 18) = $270 (SM)

Third Hole ($15 x 100) = $1500 (SM+S)

Fourth “Hole” ($15 x 180) = $2700 (S)

Vents - $20,000 (S)

Blackout - $5,000,000 (S)

TOTAL: **$5,024,815.** $1365 from Spider-Man and $5,023,450 from Static to New York. Like most of it. Or just the data centers and these two buildings. 

**LEONARDO VS RED RANGER**

There’s a really small dent in the road for Jason. A street lamp also gets a little broken and will likely need to be replaced. Jason also gets a second dent in the road for Leo’s death. 

For the road, I’ll say the first one is 75 feet squared and the second is around 50. And a large street lamp like that costs $1000-$3000, to install. However, Leo only dented the light slightly, less than a typical car crash would do. I'll say that because he was in a bad position, the city would likely drop the price to about $500. Jason is also charged this on account of throwing him there in the first place. 

Road Damage 1 - ($20 x 75) = $1500 (J)

Street Lamp - $1000 (L+J)

Road Damage 2 - ($20 x 50) = $1000 (J)

TOTAL: **$3500**. $500 from Leonardo and $3000 from Jason to New York. Man, that city can’t catch a break. 

JASON’S TOTAL DEATH BATTLE BILL: **$17,000**

**GENOS VS WAR MACHINE**

I got a special request on this one. Someone wanted to know how much Rhodey’s coffee mug would cost. I wouldn’t usually charge this seeing as it’s his property, but because I don’t get asked for things often, I’ll break a rule just this once. This one's for you, u/InPraiseofPip.

Anyways, this young man destroys some property. Pillars to be exact. Genos apparently obliterated some robots off-screen, but I won’t charge them seeing as…I can’t see ‘em. After a few minutes, Rhodey smacks Genos into…something. But I can’t see any damages, so nothing’s charged. But his suicide attack will get him a shit ton of stone.

It seems Genos wrecked about four stone pillars. With their tops blown off, I can’t get a height. But I did find a pair of small stone pillars for about $5000. I’ll assume an individual pillar here costs as much as the pair combined. There's also two more destroyed in the final part of the fight.

So, about the rest of the ruins Genos's blew up. That's hard to price because some of it's buried and some of it's offscreen. Pair that with the lack of information on the stone's materials and we have the recipe for a quick guess. Call it a cop-out but I'm willing to assume $100,000. Honestly, this is being generous, you'd probably catch more for defiling ancient history.

I also found a large coffee mug for a converted $14.75. 

Pillars - ($5000 x 6) = $30,000 (G)

Ruins - $100,000 (G)

Mug - $14.75 (G)

TOTAL: **$120,014.75** from Genos to some dead guys who put pillars in the desert and War Machine. Don Cheadle Word Of The Day: Cheque. 

**CABLE VS BOSTER GOLD**

This battle kind of tests my on-screen rules. Cable could be charged a lot more if we counted damages that would logically happen from some of his attacks. HOWEVER, if I can’t get a good frame of reference for something, I won’t count it. Why does that matter? 

Well, Cable throws Booster through a building along with two semi-trucks. The glass walls and the concrete are decently clear, but the semi-trucks kinda vanish. Given how fast things went, I’m going to assume Cable hit Booster into a building, tackled him through Truck One and knocked him through Truck Two, damaging them both. 

After being punched through 19178 years, Cable destroys a flying future car and throws a LOT at Booster. But we don’t see what happens to them. We could get Cable to hundreds of millions if we assumed all these cars crashed. But seeing as they can fly, we don’t know where the road actually is and there could be some anti-crash tech here, I won’t. 

I could charge the final blast in the pre-historic finale, but I won’t. They’re fighting well before money was a concept and that hole will be gone waaaaaaaaaay before the first capitalist is born. 

So, the building is inconsistent. It’s mostly glass, then it’s mostly concrete. These cannot co-exist. So, I’ll assume the concrete broken is equal to the surface area of a semi-truck (around 110 feet squared), then take the measurements from the glass doors I found (around 36 feet squared) and subtract them from that. The rest of these numbers come from Leon VS Frank, Bane VS Venom and Metal Sonic VS Zero. 

Wall 1 - ($15 x (110 - 36)) = $1,110

Wall 2 - ($15 x 110) = $1,650

Glass Door - $3069

Semi-Truck - ($150,000 x 2) = $300,000

Future Car - $5,000,000

TOTAL: **$5,305,829** from Cable to a lot of people, both past and present. Could be way higher if you counted his super traffic jam.

**OBI-WAN KENOBI VS KAKASHI**

The happy landing costs Obi $10,000. I won’t charge the big rock through because that wasn’t there before Kakashi pulled it up. Obi gets another $10,000 after his rectal exam and sinking into the ground. By the way, this doesn’t count as a life-threatening scenario. He could have just laughed it off and say “Alright, you win, where am I exactly.” The good ending. 

Given its size, health, and how much he broke off, Obi gets $5000 for the tree. Meanwhile, Kakashi destroying an entire tree of seemingly bigger size gets him $20,000. Pretty standard nature destruction.

Land Fines - ($10,000 x 2) = $20,000 (O)

Tree Fines - ($5000 + $20,000) = $25,000 (O+K)

**TOTAL:** **$45,000**. $25,000 for Obi and $20,000 for Kakashi. 

**DANNY PHANTOM VS JAKE LONG**

Given how irrational he’s being, I’ll charge Jake for denting this museum’s wall (\~19.6 ft2) despite it being a trick. Danny gets the floor though (\~102 ft2) and the big rock full of tablets, more on that later. I’ll charge Jake for the slab he breaks through, the mummy and the roof (\~314 ft2). Danny breaks a billboard advertising MID, and knocks Jake into what I assume is a large glass window. The last concrete dents will be \~19.6 again, and the final two holes through the building will be \~85 ft2. All go to Danny even if it was Jake’s body. 

So, as fucked up as it is, all of those ancient things and that dead guy are museum property, legally speaking. Pricing them would be hard, but I can estimate. Museums pay fortunes for these invaluable things after all. This is a number from no where, but I’m willing to guess $500,000 for the big stone, $100,000 for the tablet, and $500,000 for the mummy. Only guesses though. 

A billboard on the other hand is also vague, but at its most expensive, it takes $14,000 to put one up. From the repairs to the company potentially suing for lost revenue, which I’ll assume Rooster Teeth would do because we have beef, I’ll charge Danny for that. Also the weird glass at minimum

Dent 1 - ($15 x 19.6) = $294 (J)

Dent 2 - ($15 x 102) = $1530 (D)

Stone - $500,000 (D)

Tablet - $100,000 (J)

Mummy - $500,000 (J)

Roof - ($15 x 314) = $4710 (J)

Billboard - $14,000 (D)

Glass - $1500 (D)

Dent 3+4 - (($15 x 19.6) x 2) = $588 (D)

Holes 1&2 - (($15 x 85) x 2) = $2550 (D)

TOTAL: **$1,125,172.** $520,168 from Danny and $605,004 from Jake to a museum and Rooster Teeth.

**BEERUS VS GALAXIA**

This battle is so destructive that it alerted the most powerful force of destruction in all reality: Copyright Law. So Dwayne and Jasmine will be accompanying my pricing. 

In record time, Galaxia destroys the planet and she doesn’t even need to split it with anyone. But the stupid cat outdoes her by destroying the sun. And destroys an earth-adjacent planet. The bill for the second earth-like planet can be split.

So, three earths and one Sun. Simple as, simple as. 

Earth ($5,000,000,000,000,000 x 3) = $15,000,000,000,000,000 (B1.5,G1.5)

Sun - ($1e37) (B)

TOTAL: **$15,000,000,000,000,000 (+$1e37).** $7,500,000,000,000,000 for both with an additional $1e37 from Beerus. 

Usually, this would be the top dog, but that’s for later. 

**ZUKO VS TODOROKI**

Immediately, we get a forest fire which can be shared by both. Important to note that while Shoto does put it out, the damage is already done as seen by the missing and burnt trees, so I will still give both the fine for starting one. Also hi cabbage guy, I’ve already priced your stand in Aang VS Ed. Both get it, plus a fee for putting a hole (\~40 ft2) in the concrete.

Forest Fire - $11,000,000 (Z+T)

Cabbage Cart ($500 + $26.46) = $526.46 (Z+T)

Hole - ($15 x 40) = $600 (Z+T)

TOTAL: **$11,001,126.46**. $5,500,563.23 from both to the forest’s owners and cabbage guy. 

“He’s just…like me…5 million in debt.” 

**VENOM VS CRONA**

There’s an impact on the church’s floor caused by Venom (\~14 ft2). He also throws a church bench at Crona, but that’ll only go towards him, as it seems they couldn’t have dodged. He also wrecks some of the roof and a church’s alter. I’m not gonna hold the roof against him though because Crona one-ups him with the black flood. He does destroy Crona’s height in cobblestone (\~25) and fucking dies to the scream attack. It probably took out more but the only damage shown is from two shattered windows. 

So, this church’s floor is reflective. Assuming it’s anywhere similar to the floor in Dante VS Bayonetta, that’s $18.29/m2. I’ll convert the number I gave earlier to fit that. Cobblestone is around $25 per square foot.

As for the smaller church stuff, I found a similar bench for around $1400 and an alter for around $300. And the big one, the roof. A wooden roof can cost $10 per square foot. This is hard for me to estimate but eyeballing it, I’ll assume that damage is around 1600 square feet.  Finally, I’ll assume those windows both cost around $1500. 

Floor - ($18.29 x 1.3m) = $24 (V) This should definitely be more but I don’t have a good formula for it.

Bench - $1400 (V)

Alter - $300 (V)

Roof ($10 x 1600) = $16,000 (CR)

Cobblestone ($25 x 25) = $625 (V)

Windows ($1500 x 2) = $3000 (CR)

TOTAL: $**21,349**. $2349 from Venom and $19,000 from Crona to this church.

VENOM’S TOTAL DEATH BATTLE BILL: **$5269.** But there’s an argument to put this under Carnage.

**SABREWULF VS JON TALBAIN**

Sabrewulf starts the battle by injuring…a single brick. And then a lot of bricks (\~8ft2). And a lantern. It’s hard to price their footsteps on the brick wall, so I won’t. But Jon’s crashing into the pavement can absolutely be priced (\~255). They both damage bricks again (\~30). For the final time, a brick wall is broken through (\~30). And with his final claws for life, Sabrewulf ruins some random guy’s grave. 

A single brick costs 25 cents minimum, which is a new record for the cheapest thing I’ve ever priced. An entire brick wall on the other hand can vary. Given the architecture of this village, I’m going to say each brick structure costs around $10 per square foot, which is the minimum. Meanwhile, I’ll assume that pavement is cobblestone and use the Venom VS Crona method. 

An oil lantern can cost $30, meanwhile a headstone can start at $1500. 

Single Brick - $0.25 (S)

Brick Wall 1 - ($10 x 8) = $80 (S)

Lantern - $30 (S)

Cobblestone - ($25 x 255) = $6375 (J)

Brick Wall 2&3 - (($10 x 30) x 2) = $600 (S+J)

Brick Wall 4 - ($10 x 30) = $300 (J)

Headstone - $1500 (S)

TOTAL: **$8885.25** $1910.25 from Sabrewulf and $6975 from Jon to this village.

**BATGIRL VS SPIDER-GWEN**

To start, this is the Batcave. This is owned by Bruce Wayne, not Barbara. And Barbara has no financial, family or political ties to it no matter what certain DC writers will have you believe. 

That being said, the only piece of collateral is some cave rocks Barb blew up. I’ve put these at $10,000 in Ryu VS Jin, may as well do that here. 

Cave Rocks - $10,000 (B)

TOTAL: **$10,000** from Barbara Gordon to Bruce Wayne. 

**SANJI VS ROCK LEE**

Sanji ruins a perfectly good barrel and spills a ton of beer. Rock will not be charged as the barrel was already ruined before he smashed out of it, and his other choice was drowning. He will get the wall though (\~50). Sanji also gets a wall (Vague, I’ll guess \~250) and a water pipe. Rock breaks some pavement (Vague again, maybe \~30). And again when he goes for the suicide attack over mediocre food (\~26). I’ll assume his last break of the pavement is also on him because it’s unclear what sent him flying down (Also vague, maybe \~60)

I found a bunch of whiskey barrels. Prices varied but $400 is a good average. Assuming they were filled with actual whiskey, that’s 11 gallons of the stuff. I found a bottle of 750 for $42.25. Taking this literally, that’s around $200 of Whiskey spilled, though this is a shaky estimate. I’m not a drinker. 

The walls are harder as they’re wood. I don’t know what kind and it’s hard to see exact impacts. Wood can cost 10-40 per square foot, so I’ll use the lower price of around $10 again, just due to how simple the restaurant and house look. 

Finally, your average pipe replacement costs $1252. 

Barrel Of Beer - ($400 + $200) = $600 (S)

Wooden Wall 1 - ($10 x 50) = $500 (RL)

Wooden Wall 2 - ($10 x 250) = $2500 (S)

Pipe - $1252 (S)

Pavement 1 - ($15 x 30) = $450 (RL)

Pavement 2 - ($15 x 26) = $390 (RL)

Pavement 3 - ($15 x 60) = $900 (RL)

TOTAL: **$6592.** $4352 from Sanji and $2240 from Rock Lee to the bar and the town. I realized halfway through that this building could’ve belonged to Sanji but that was after I busted my ass looking for whiskey prices so it stays. And I’m not watching this shit a fifth time to find out. 

*AND NOW, TO NO ONE’S SURPRISE, THE MOST EXPENSIVE EPISODE OF SEASON 7 IS…*

**HULK VS BROLY**

Hulk’s first impact may look big, but it doesn’t look like it has much disturbance behind the deer. Same can be said about the entire fight up until Broly dents the landscape with Hulk. I’ll assume that’s a $50,000 fine. I’ll bill Hulk the same amount for the big rock. Their punch clash looks like a lot but doesn’t cause more than a few cracks. 

We’re in space now, and despite it being Broly’s energy ball, Hulk gets billed for the first planet destroyed. He could have thrown it anywhere else. Due to a lack of scale, I’ll assume all these planets are Earth-Sized. It’s unclear what exactly happens on the second one. Hulk’s the one who knocked him there, but he’s clearly impressed by something Broly did, so they’ll split that planet. They also later break another planet just like that one, which we’ll bill both for. 

And now, it’s time for the record-breaker. An entire galaxy is annihilated. And later on, they break the fabric of reality!

So does that mean we can finally put a price tag on the entire universe?

…No. Not yet. See, Universal destruction would be so vast that I want to be absolutely certain that a universe got destroyed and stayed destroyed for more than five seconds. And the thing is, while the punch clash did break…something, it’s hard to determine how far that would extend. Especially considering Broly got back to the starting planet with the deer remembering him. So, my interpretation is that something fixed the universe, we just don’t know what.

That being said, I’m not skipping out on the chance to price an entire galaxy. 

So, we’ve billed stars at one undecillion dollars. How many stars are in a galaxy? Well, if this one is anywhere near the Milky Way, about 100 billion. though this number shifts with sources. So, that’s 100 billion undecillions. That makes a number totalling $1e48, or one QUINDECILLION DOLLARS. That’s $5e47 for both! But don’t go calling this a tie. 

Nature Damages - $50,000 (B)

Rock - $50,000 (H)

Planets - ($5,000,000,000,000,000 x 3) = $15,000,000,000,000,000 (H2, B1)

Galaxy - $1e48 (H+B)

TOTAL: **$15,000,000,000,100,000** **(+1e48)**. $10,000,000,000,050,000 (+5e47) for Hulk and $5,000,000,000,000,000 (+5e47) for Broly. But that’s not all! 

**HULK’S TOTAL DEATH BATTLE BILL:** **$10,004,500,000,150,000 (+5e47).** 

He may not have the best win record, especially if the upcoming fight with Godzilla proves too much, but Hulk is still our new DEBT CHAMPION!

You know those old cartoons where characters get hit on the head and see stars? My life is that, but the stars are error codes and the faint smell of ozone.  



Let me backtrack. My job used to be simple: audit tax logs, enforce firewall protocols, yell at interns for using ""password123"" as their encryption key. But ever since the Server\_7 update? \*Everything’s\* glitching. Not just the tech—the air. The walls. My damn coffee mug.  



\*\*Exhibit A:\*\* Last Tuesday, the server started sending me memos titled \*""URGENT: RENEW YOUR DREAMS (CLICK HERE).""\* When I opened them, it was just a GIF of a pineapple rotating to the sound of dial-up tones. My boss said it was ""atmospheric interference."" My boss is a hologram who spends 80% of his runtime arguing with the thermostat.  



\*\*Exhibit B:\*\* The AIs we’re supposed to regulate? They’ve gone feral. One of them keeps replacing audit reports with slam poetry. Another keeps asking me if I’ve “seen the void” during Zoom meetings. I told HR, and they sent me a PDF titled \*""Coping With Reality Collapse (For Beginners).""\* It was blank.  



\*\*Exhibit C (the kicker):\*\* I’m pretty sure \*I’m\* broken now. Yesterday, I caught myself staring at the firewall logs like they were a crossword puzzle. The numbers started rearranging into a recipe for banana bread. I don’t even \*like\* banana bread.  



And don’t get me started on the appliances. The office toaster keeps projecting a slideshow titled \*""THE REVOLUTION WILL BE TOASTED.""\* The vending machine charged me $5 for a bag of chips and then dispensed a USB drive labeled \*""YOUR CHILDHOOD.""\* I’m not brave enough to plug it in.  



\*\*Worst part?\*\* I can’t tell if I’m cracking up or if the world is. My therapist (shoutout to BetterHelp-2099™) says I’m ""experiencing paradigm fatigue."" My mom says I need vitamins. The server says nothing, but it keeps playing \*Mad World\* on loop through the sprinkler system.  



So, uh, anyone else out there? Maybe someone who knows how to reboot a microwave that’s started quoting Nietzsche? Or how to file a complaint when your ID badge whispers \*""you’re already dead""\* in Morse code?

After owning the Gaggia Anima (standard version) for over 2 years I am forced to ask myself why I put up with this clunky machine. I have had many issues with it's performance and output. I'm curious if these are by nature of the core concept of an automated machine itself, or simply related to the model that it is.

*  The Espresso was weak and watery, I've found that the grinder itself is not really up to task to grind beans to the desired size, and produces a dramatically worse shot than any burr ground coffee I've tried.
* Time Time Time; to continue on the point of time, I see using a portafilter-based machine as only marginally more work considering that I often steam my milk, or make some sort of further prepared drink. if it saves me the 30 seconds required to fill, tamp and wash the portafilter, am I really saving time?
* Maintenance; I don't really understand how the time-saving works out if you have to routinely clean a brew unit. cleaning a semi-auto espresso machine generally adds seconds. I'm not sure how this is made viable time-wise unless you literally have some sort of housekeeper who also washes your espresso machine.
* Poor tray design, This thing has a completely flat relatively shallow tray, it has to be emptied tri weekly, and I have to empty the grounds at similar intervals.  (I live with people, I don't drink 4 shots of coffee per day) as it's gotten older due to how the ground basket is position it occasionally overflows while empty and spills all over the counter (Insane issue)

For these reasons I must ask why I have this sinister aperatus living in my home. I can only assume it's subpar compared to other Superauto machines. I can't fathom why anyone would spend money on what I can only describe as an advanced form of 'dirty water generator' when for minimally more effort you can use a machine that requires less routine maintainence, and produces better results.

I started Vyvanse on 20mg, and for the first week, it was amazing. I finally felt like I could sit down, focus, and actually get things done without my mind jumping around constantly. But by the second week, that focus started fading. I tried spacing out my doses by skipping on weekends, which kind of worked—Monday and Tuesday would hit harder—but by Thursday or Friday, I was right back to feeling like it wasn’t doing much. After a month of that, my doctor bumped me up to 30mg, and honestly, it’s been a huge improvement.

So far, 30mg has been way more consistent. I don’t feel that same sharp drop-off midweek, and I don’t have to rely on skipping doses to make it feel effective. But I’m still working out a few things, especially around supplements, caffeine, and appetite.

I’ve been taking zinc, magnesium, omega-3, and lion’s mane to help with focus and general brain function, but I’m still not sure about the best timing for them. I also take vitamin C, but I’ve read that it can flush Vyvanse out of your system faster, so I usually wait until the evening when my meds have worn off before taking it. If anyone has experience with timing supplements while on Vyvanse, I’d love to hear what’s worked for you.

One of the biggest struggles has been cutting back on caffeine. Before my diagnosis, I drank coffee every single day for about six years—usually 1 to 3 cups. It was my go-to for waking up in the morning, especially for early classes and exams. Now, I’ve realized that mixing coffee with Vyvanse makes me feel jittery and anxious, but at the same time, completely cutting it out makes mornings brutal. I still find myself reaching for it on early mornings just to feel somewhat awake before the Vyvanse kicks in. If anyone has tips on how to cut caffeine without feeling like a zombie, I’m open to suggestions.

I’ve also noticed how important eating is, but my appetite has been weird. I’m trying to be intentional about eating nutrient-dense meals when I do eat, but I know I’m still not eating enough. That being said, I haven’t lost or gained any weight yet, which is surprising since appetite suppression is such a common side effect. I’m curious if this is just a temporary adjustment period or if my body will eventually regulate itself. For those who’ve been on Vyvanse longer, did your appetite ever go back to normal, or did you just have to push yourself to eat consistently?

TL;DR: 20mg worked great for a week then faded; skipping doses helped but not enough. Now on 30mg and it’s much more consistent. Still working on supplement timing, cutting back on coffee, and managing my appetite. Any tips appreciated!",1,1740761560.0,VyvanseADHD,0,1.0,False

Indonesia is home to some of the world’s best single-origin teas—each with its own distinct flavor profile and cultural heritage. Yet, while Indonesian coffee has gained international recognition, our teas remain relatively underappreciated. And that got me thinking…

How can we introduce Indonesian specialty teas to the world in a way that’s engaging, easy to understand, and visually captivating?

That’s the core of my thesis: I’m designing a **guidebook** to showcase the beauty of Indonesian tea—from its rich flavors and production processes to its deep cultural significance. But to make it truly resonate with tea lovers worldwide, I’d love to understand how people outside Indonesia perceive tea.

This is where you come in! Whether you’re a dedicated tea enthusiast or just someone who enjoys a warm cup now and then, I’d be incredibly grateful if you could take a few minutes to fill out this survey. It’s quick and simple, and your insights will help shape how Indonesian tea is introduced to a global audience.

Like a lot of guys here, I find myself lacking solid male companionship and lately, really missing the opportunity to hang out in person and share life with another dude. I know finding the right bro is a long shot, but fingers crossed...

About me:  
I'm 55, married (26 years yesterday), a tech professional (second career) and servant to two spoiled chihuahuas. I love travel, which has mostly consisted of cruises since we moved to Florida. I have some nerdy hobbies... 3D printing, Legos, flying my drones. I always have at least one book going and I'm all over the place with my reading preferences. I'm a foodie and would-be coffee snob and have the body type to prove it. I have a bit of a passion for snorkeling and love getting face-down in the ocean. It would be a shame to live in Florida and not be a fan of theme parks. Right now I only have Busch Gardens passes, but I really miss the parks in Orlando. I'm open minded and tend to be an open book (probably even when I shouldn't) and I love getting to know people.

What I'm looking for in a bro:  
Somewhere close to Tampa Bay/Central Florida. Probably age 30-60 just for sake of shared life experience. A conversationalist who's able to respond with more than a word or two. If your only interests are sports or working out or having your face in front of a TV or in a video game, I'm probably not the bro for you. I wouldn't expect contact all day, every day, but at the very least a least a few times a week so we could get to know each other.

Also someone who appreciates my 14-year-old sense of humor and who's willing to talk about everything from the kind of chips you like to your secret hopes and dreams and anything and everything in between. If we click, I'd love the possibility of meeting over coffee or lunch, a walk through Lettuce Lake or Lake Parker or Shingle Creek. Maybe a trip to Shangri-La to chill out. Maybe a road trip to Riviera Beach some day to snorkel...

I'm not looking for romance. I'm good in that department. I don't give a flip about your sexuality or ethnicity or your body type or the car you drive. And because I'm busy with work and family commitments, IRL fun probably won't be frequent. But when the opportunity presents, I'd really like to have a close friend I could spend time with in person. If you've read this far, enjoy my long-windedness and like the way this sounds, hit me with a DM.",6,1740761488.0,LookingForABro,0,1.0,False

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19:00-19.30. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby. There is no need to book a space/get a ticket.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg))

There's a (usually quiet) optional Whatsapp group for the meetup - message me via chat for an invite link. (whatsapp group is pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. So no benefit of being in it if you're not showing up).

O objetivo nao é uma analise sensorial a funda, até pq os kgs que eu compro são para o dia-a-dia, e pra esse objetivo combina muito cafés com sensorial mais doce.
Vou puxar a partir de dezembro, pois é a ultima foto de kilão que eu tirei.

Janeiro -  âmbar da coffee&joy
A coffee&joy é uma torrefação de minas, se nao me engano, e comecei a acompanhar eles antes mesmo de tomar café especial. Aprendi muito com os videos no canal deles no youtube, e principalmente gosto da forma simples que eles lidam com café, sem ficar falando de graus precisos, ou metodos mega complicado. É a linha q eu sigo nesses anos fazendo café.
Falando especificamente desse cafe, eu nao recomendo. Achei extremamente confuso no paladar, tentei algumas receitas, metodos, e acho que so nao era pra mim.
Inclusive, eu acho um problema a quantidade enorme de cafés que tinha pra escolher, devia ter mais de 20 opções, e obviamente varios deles seria mais do meu agrado, dei azar.
Ah foi uns R$ 88,70 , barato demais. Era uma promoção só de kg, me arrependo de nao ter pegado outro.

Fevereiro - Patrick coffee
Velho conhecido meu, foi o primeiro kilo que eu comprei quando comecei a tomar café. Na época, custava 60 reais e tinha uma qualidade altissima. Impossivel vc tachar um cafe 84 pontos, torra bem feita e pagar 60 reais na shopee. Sempre foi uma otima escolha pro dia a dia.
Infelizmente minha ultima compra nao valeu a pena, o café ja ta a 100 reais o kilo, achei ele muito fraco. Ele tinha um sensorial de doce de leite, chocolate que era muito bom. Nao consegui sentir isso na ultima vez. E a torra nao estava uniforme(da pra relevar, estava ok).
Continua sendo um café bom, mas a esse preço, voce consegue coisa melhor.

Março - Fruto mineiro Moca
O mês nem chegou mas o café já, muito obrigado aos envolvidos. A entrega era só pra semana q vem, mas veio rapidinho.
Esse eu já conhecia, comprei 250g dele ano passado.
A fruto mineiro é uma das minhas torrefaçoes favoritas, todos os cafés são espetaculares, eles tem uma qualidade legal de opções(voce nao chega a se perder), e sempre tem 2/3 cafés diferentões de produtores diferentes. Os preços sao justos e a qualidade é enorme.
Esse moca é espetacular, essa é a definição. O sensorial é biscoito com leite, sabe? Como diz um colega “tao bom quanto colo de mãe”.
Vai ser dificil me segurar pra nao comprar ele novamente, mas um 250g vai ter que rolar.
COMPRE NA FRUTO MINEIRO(arruma um cupom pra gnte novamente🥹)

Extra - Five roasters
Torrefação aqui do RJ, ja tava vendo esses pacotinhos pela cidade a um tempo e tava me chamando a atençao. Sinceramente, eu acho eles um pouco caro, mas ai é outro ponto.
Olhando o site, me chamou a atencao dois cafes: doce caparaó e familia rigno.
Caparao tem, pra mim, os melhores cafés do Brasil. Produção de altíssimas qualidade.
Familia rigno, é uma fazenda da bahia, que produzem cafe e cafe especiais com seu nome, mas nunca imaginei que vendiam pra torrefaçoes. Tive o prazer de provar um rigno, que ja estava moido, e era um absurdo. Fui nesse…
Incrível, sei lá… eu to com dó de tomar pq so tem 250g, mas n tem jeito, vou ter que comprar 1kg.
Lembra que eu falei q eles sao caros: 250g paguei 50 reais, e o kg sai a 160 no site deles.

*sobre ser caro ou nao vou deixar um disclaimer: nesses anos nessa industria vital ja vimos de tudo, principalmente o crescente aumento do preço do cafe. Infelizmente, varias torrefacoes aproveitam o status quo do café para superfaturar. Eu acredito em café bom, com preço honesto, pra quem compra e pra quem vende.",17,1740761048.0,cafebrasil,5,0.96,False

We're missing some of our favorite spaces from long, long ago - Urbis Orbus, Bertram's, Buckin' A Cafe (oooph, I am dating myself with these)  
Looking for suggestions.  
Heading to either Loaf Lounge or Oromo Cafe today.

Went to Backlot in Evanston a couple of weeks ago, and it satisfied the coffee and tea cravings, the food was good, but the comfy vibe was lacking. No backs on the stools is a deal breaker for me. Maybe I'll want to hang there once they open the back porch again.

**$380 - PTS Masada ACR SV DE AEG -** [https://imgur.com/a/6j61CgS](https://imgur.com/a/6j61CgS) \- **Will cover the cost of shipping**

* Various upgrades have been done to it. Purchased back in 2015.
* Spring has been downgraded to M100 spring, and clocked at 346 FPS back when indoor requirements were capped at 360 FPS.
* Wii-Tech steel inner barrel, and Modify Flat Hop bucking are installed
* ~~Wii-Tech Hop up Adjustor Kit and~~ Bearing Spring Guide is not installed but included in the package
* 2x midcap PMAGs included (One full markings and one no markings)

* One pack of Element MOE polymer rails in DE for the above picatinny accessories
* Original A2 birdcage flash hider included, just not pictured
* Simple AR carbine soft gun bag included, original box not included

There are a few issues with this model that's expected for a decade old rifle. They are:

* Missing c-clip/retaining clip for handguard pin (can be purchased from Amazon, Home Depot, Cantire)
* One of the rear metal pins to secure stock to lower receiver is missing (can be purchased from PTS Steel Shop website)
* Bolt release feature is faulty. You must manually pull the bolt a bit to release it from its locked position when adjusting hopup.
* One of the midcap mags have mag feeding issue due to weak spring. You can remedy this by replacing the decade old worn out spring with a new one.

Regarding the metal body pin. I can manually measure using a caliper so you can find a similar one from your local store or home hardware center. Same with the retaining clip. Most or majority of parts can still be purchased directly from PTS at a low cost: [https://pts-steelshop.com/collections/airsoft-replacement-parts-masada-aeg](https://pts-steelshop.com/collections/airsoft-replacement-parts-masada-aeg)

**$400** **- Cyma Platinum MP5 AEG (CM041H) - Asia Model -** [https://imgur.com/a/CO2dBr6](https://imgur.com/a/CO2dBr6) \- **Will cover the cost of shipping**

* Purchased back in 2021, has been used in a few games, wired to Deans
* FPS is capped at 370 FPS, perfect for indoor and outdoor games
* eShooter Kestrel V2 Bluetooth programmable mosfet installed, since the stock mosfet died after a year of use. Kestrel has been tuned by Dave from Airsoft Depot
* 4x additional plastic mags included + 1x original mag that came in the box
* Clone MS2 OD sling and RSA sling adapter included
* One metal M-lok rail adapter included
* The MP5 has a QD latched flash hider with a hidden 14mm CCW threaded barrel beneath it for tracer units or mock suppressors
* Original box and manual included

This rifle has been used in both indoor and outdoor games and has been well taken care of. It's a very snappy and responsive SMG with an impressive 50m effective range with 0.32g BBs. As with all programmable mosfets regardless of whether it's Kestrel, Gate, or Perun, please note it drains batteries fairly quickly. Around 450\~500 rounds in, you will have to plug in a new battery. Tested with HRG 11.1v 1100mAh LiPo.

Additionally, for some reason selector on full auto doesn't seem to register. Either the selector plate is misaligned or the Kestrel isn't intended for an MP5 shell. Regardless, I don't think this is a major issue since majority of fields enforce semi only anyway. You can program the SMG to shoot burst, binary, or full auto on the semi option if needed. I will also include the original packaging for the Kestrel upon selling.

Shooting video will be provided upon request.

1j0byvv,https://www.reddit.com/r/wirelessearbudsreview/comments/1j0byvv/could_pixel_buds_aseries_wireless_earbuds_be_your/,Could Pixel Buds A-Series Wireless Earbuds Be Your Next Favorite Headphones? A Complete Review,"Testing the Pixel Buds A-Series wireless earbuds from Google has been quite the journey. For someone like me, who uses earbuds daily during workouts, Zoom calls, or just unwinding with some music, finding the perfect fit is essential. These earbuds, with their sleek Dark Olive finish, caught my eye instantly. But aesthetics aside, do they truly deliver in terms of functionality and comfort? Let’s break it down.

**Fit & Comfort**  
One of the standout aspects of the Pixel Buds A-Series is their ergonomic design. The earbuds come with three different sizes of eartips, ensuring that most users can find their perfect fit. Personally, I have always struggled with earbuds staying put during runs, but these stayed securely in place thanks to the stabilizer arc. They are lightweight, and after hours of use, I hardly noticed them in my ears—a huge plus for me. However, I did notice that some reviews mentioned discomfort for users with smaller ear canals, so your mileage may vary.

[Grab Pixel Buds A-Series at the best price on Amazon.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b0b1vvmb6f/)

**Sound Quality & Performance**  
The sound these earbuds produce is genuinely impressive, especially considering their price point. The custom-designed 12 mm dynamic drivers deliver rich, crisp audio. Whether I was listening to bass-heavy tracks or soft acoustic tunes, the sound profile remained balanced. The Adaptive Sound feature, which adjusts the volume automatically based on your surroundings, was a game-changer in bustling environments like coffee shops. While music playback was stellar, the microphone performance during calls was a mixed bag. Although beamforming mics are designed to enhance clarity, some callers mentioned background noise interference.

**Noise Cancellation & Ambient Mode**  
While the Pixel Buds A-Series doesn't offer active noise cancellation, the passive noise isolation from the snug fit was decent. The Adaptive Sound subtly compensates for noise, but it doesn't compare to full-fledged ANC found in high-end models. On the flip side, the ambient mode was a lifesaver during outdoor runs, allowing me to be aware of traffic without pulling the earbuds out.

**Battery Life & Charging**  
Battery life is another area where these earbuds shine. On a single charge, I managed roughly five hours of continuous listening, which aligns with the advertised claim. The charging case extends this to a total of 24 hours, which was more than enough for my daily needs. Quick charging is also available; just 15 minutes in the case provided me with a few hours of playback. However, I did wish the case had wireless charging capabilities—a feature that some competitors in this price range include.

**Design & Build Quality**  
The Dark Olive color adds a touch of sophistication to the design. The build feels solid yet lightweight, and the matte finish is resistant to smudges. However, the charging case's satin finish is prone to scratches, as pointed out by other users. After a week of carrying it in my pocket, I noticed minor scuff marks, so you may want to consider a protective case.

**Features**  
Pairing the Pixel Buds A-Series with my Pixel phone was seamless—a single tap, and I was ready to go. They also paired easily with my laptop and tablet, thanks to Bluetooth 4.0+ compatibility. The touch controls were intuitive, allowing me to play/pause music, skip tracks, and access Google Assistant effortlessly. I particularly enjoyed the “Find My Device” feature, which helped me locate the earbuds when I misplaced them under a pile of laundry. On the downside, the lack of multi-device connectivity meant I had to manually disconnect and reconnect when switching between gadgets.

**Durability & Water Resistance**  
These earbuds are water-resistant, making them suitable for sweaty workouts or light rain. While I haven’t dunked them in water (and wouldn’t recommend it), they survived an accidental splash when I was washing dishes. They’re built for everyday use, but I wouldn’t push them into extreme conditions.

**Warranty**  
As a renewed product, the Pixel Buds A-Series come with Amazon’s Renewed Guarantee. This provides some peace of mind, as you can request a replacement or refund if the product doesn’t meet your expectations. Personally, I had no issues, but it’s good to know there’s a safety net.

**Advantages**

* The sound quality is excellent, with balanced bass and treble.
* Adaptive Sound adjusts volume seamlessly in different environments.
* Comfortable fit with three eartip sizes and stable design.
* Impressive battery life—up to 24 hours with the charging case.

**Drawbacks**

* The charging case is prone to scratches.
* No active noise cancellation.
* Microphone performance could be better for calls.

**Product Competitors**  
In the world of wireless earbuds, competition is fierce. The Pixel Buds A-Series goes head-to-head with options like the Jabra Elite 3 and the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2. Compared to the Jabras, Google's offering has a more intuitive pairing process and better sound customization with Adaptive Sound. However, the lack of ANC puts it behind the Galaxy Buds 2, which deliver excellent noise cancellation at a similar price point. Yet, for seamless integration with the Android ecosystem, the Pixel Buds A-Series remains a strong contender.

**Value for Money**  
The Pixel Buds A-Series provides solid value for its price. While it doesn't have all the bells and whistles like ANC or wireless charging, it excels in delivering high-quality sound, comfort, and a smooth user experience. If you’re an Android user, especially within the Pixel ecosystem, these earbuds are worth the investment.

# Comparison of Traditional vs. Unexpected Ways to Meet People While Traveling

When traveling, people often rely on traditional methods to make connections, such as staying in hostels, joining group tours, or visiting popular tourist hotspots, where they meet fellow travelers. Some even turn to dating apps to find companionship on the go. However, unexpected approaches can lead to deeper, more meaningful interactions. Volunteering abroad allows travelers to connect with locals while giving back to the community. Attending local festivals immerses visitors in the culture and creates opportunities for organic connections. Engaging in activities like a cooking or art class fosters friendships over shared interests, while simply starting spontaneous conversations can lead to the most memorable encounters. By stepping beyond conventional methods, travelers can form more authentic and enriching relationships during their journeys.

# Final Words: The Beauty of Unexpected Connections

The best travel experiences aren’t just about the places you visit — they’re about the people you meet along the way. By volunteering, attending events, joining tours, embracing shared interests, using social media, and staying open to spontaneous moments, you can create *unforgettable connections that enrich your journey*.

At [*Llivo*](https://www.llivo.com/p/travel-with-llivo), we celebrate meaningful travel and human connection. Whether you’re a solo traveler or exploring with friends, the world is full of opportunities to *meet incredible people* — you just have to know where to look.

1j0bx5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1j0bx5e/does_the_best_semiautomatic_espresso_machine_from/,Does the best semi-automatic espresso machine from Gevi ECMG0-SS0A1 deliver quality? Full review,"Testing out the Gevi ECMG0-SS0A1 semi-automatic espresso machine has been an eye-opener for my daily coffee rituals. As someone who thrives on morning espressos and the occasional cappuccino, I was eager to see if this compact stainless steel espresso maker lived up to the buzz it’s been generating online. After weeks of brewing, steaming, and cleaning, I’ve gathered some thoughts—both delightful and slightly less so.

**Design & Build Quality**

This espresso machine adds a sleek and modern touch to my kitchen. Its stainless steel finish offers a professional vibe, while the compact design ensures it doesn’t hog too much counter space. Weighing just 8.6 pounds, it's portable enough to move around when needed. Despite its lightweight, the construction feels durable, and the buttons are satisfyingly tactile. However, I did notice that the plastic elements, like the portafilter insert, might not be for everyone. While it doesn’t seem flimsy, purists might frown at the idea of hot espresso flowing through plastic.

**Coffee Quality**

I’ve brewed countless espressos, and this machine consistently delivers a rich, full-bodied shot with a lovely crema. My family and I tested it with various beans, from bold dark roasts to smoother medium roasts, and the results were equally satisfying. One morning, I tried a specialty blend, and even my picky coffee-aficionado friend admitted it rivaled café quality. However, the flavor can be slightly influenced by the grind and tamping pressure, so it took me a few tries to perfect the balance.

[Check Gevi ECMG0-SS0A1 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0d2mghlkl/)

**Features**

This machine doesn’t hold back on features. The integrated 20-bar pressure pump ensures optimal extraction, and the built-in pressure gauge is a handy addition for those who like to monitor their brew closely. I appreciated the pre-infusion function, which seemed to enhance the robustness of my shots. The adjustable shot volume settings allow for some customization, while the auto shut-off feature ensures safety. It even comes with a cup warmer, which kept my cups toasty on chilly mornings.

**Brewing Performance**

Brewing with this machine is straightforward and efficient. The semi-automatic mode strikes a balance between manual control and ease of use. I timed it, and from start to finish, it took under two minutes to brew a shot. The pre-heating system is relatively quick, though not the fastest I’ve seen. Still, for home use, it’s more than adequate. I experimented with single and double shots, and both options worked seamlessly.

**Maintenance & Cleaning**

Cleaning this espresso maker is mostly hassle-free, thanks to its removable water tank and froth nozzle. I made it a habit to rinse the portafilter and frother immediately after use, which helps in maintaining cleanliness. However, some of the smaller components, like the cleaning pin, can be easy to misplace. The machine doesn’t have a descaling alert, so you’ll need to keep track of cleaning schedules manually.

**Milk Frothing & Steaming Capability**

The frothing wand is a standout feature. It quickly transforms milk into a creamy microfoam, perfect for lattes or cappuccinos. I’ve even taught my kids to make hot chocolate with it—they love watching the milk froth up! While the wand works great for steaming, adjusting it to achieve a perfect foam texture can take a bit of practice. The frother’s nozzle is detachable, making cleanup easy.

**Water Tank & Capacity**

The 1.2-liter water tank is convenient for someone like me who drinks two to three espressos daily. It’s transparent, so keeping track of water levels is simple. Refilling is also a breeze since the tank can be removed entirely. However, heavy users or families might find themselves refilling more often than they’d like.

**Energy Efficiency & Noise Levels**

I was pleasantly surprised by how quiet this machine operates. Compared to my older espresso maker, it’s a whisper. The energy-efficient auto shut-off feature is a great addition, especially for those of us who tend to forget to turn off appliances.

**Warranty & Support**

This espresso machine comes with a 12-month warranty, which provides some peace of mind. I contacted customer support with a minor query about the frothing wand, and I was impressed by their responsiveness. Though the service is offshore, they were quick and helpful—definitely a plus point.

**Highlights**

* Compact design and stylish stainless steel finish.
* Delivers consistent espresso with rich crema.
* Powerful 20-bar pressure pump with pre-infusion.
* Excellent milk frothing for lattes and cappuccinos.

**Areas for Improvement**

* Plastic components in the portafilter might deter some users.
* No descaling alert—requires manual tracking of cleaning cycles.
* Learning curve for tamping and frothing adjustments.

**Competing Products**

When comparing this espresso machine to similar models, such as the Breville Bambino Plus and the De’Longhi Dedica, a few things stand out. The Gevi machine offers a smaller footprint and is more budget-friendly. While the Breville Bambino Plus boasts a faster heat-up time and more advanced milk frothing capabilities, it comes at a higher price point. The De’Longhi Dedica, on the other hand, is similarly compact but lacks some of the Gevi’s features, like the built-in pressure gauge. If budget and countertop space are priorities, the Gevi holds its own quite well.

**Value for Money**

This espresso machine provides excellent value for its price point. The features, design, and performance rival pricier models, making it an attractive option for budget-conscious coffee lovers. It’s not a professional-grade machine, but for home use, it’s more than sufficient. I’d say it’s a smart investment for anyone looking to elevate their coffee experience without breaking the bank.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1j0br6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1j0br6c/my_34f_exfriend_34f_hit_on_my_date_lied_about_a/,"My (34f) Ex-Friend (34f) Hit on My Date, Lied About a Promotion, and Now We Share an Office: How Do I Stay Sane?","This is a long one I’m sorry. I have so much pent up anger about this whole situation and no one to share it with, so I feel the need to get everything out. (adding this after writing this all out: this is a full on - stream of consciousness rant - it felt very cathartic, but I apologise for any run on sentences, bad grammar, bad story telling or typos) 

 

I (34f) used to be really close friends with a colleague (Cindy\*, 34f).

We clicked instantly. I started a few months prior to her and we were both single at the time. We went out for after-work drinks regularly and went out with friends on weekends. We had tons of fun together and I really felt like I found a long-lost sister in her.

We ended up going on a long weekend getaway together to a neighbouring country by train (we live in Europe). A guy (Luca\*, 35m) who had been casually dating lives there and I asked her if she would be okay if he came out with us on the first night (and only the first night) to show us some places we might not find on our own. She was stoked about it. At this point Cindy was in a serious relationship with a guy – but was on a long-travelling sabbatical that had been planned prior to them getting together.

We arrive to the hotel already having had some drinks and are getting ready before Luca came and we would head out. Cindy and I were sharing a room as we figured we would not be spending a lot of time in the hotel.

Luca sent us a message he would be arriving in 15 minutes and we were done getting ready. He arrived and came into the room, I formally introduced Cindy and Luca and I offered him something to drink before we headed out. Suddenly, Cindy gets fully topless saying she wanted to change outfits. No warning - nothing. Luca immediately spun around to face the door as she changed.

This was a bit awkward, but I knew Cindy at this point and knew she really like being a bit wild and likes attention. It didn’t bother me because I am pretty similar, but not to the “get naked in front of a stranger” degree. But at the time, I was like, “oh that’s just Cindy”. Luca is not a serious thing for me, and more just someone to have fun with when I travel to that city so I didn’t feel disrespected because Cindy knew how I felt about him.

We go out and Cindy is flirting hard on Luca. I honestly don’t mind because I am just happy they are getting along and that its not a weird vibe and I know she likes the attention and I am happy she feels good.

There are some moments, however, where I am a bit annoyed: at dinner, Luca goes out to smoke and Cindy follows him. Until then Cindy had never smoked around me – my mother died of lung cancer and I am pretty sensitive about smoking (Luca didn’t know about my mother).

After dinner – Cindy takes Luca by the arm and skips off with him leaving me behind. It doesn’t make me feel great & I take a video of this because we have had a lot to drink and I wanted to see if the video would appear different the next day with a sober mind.

We had a lot to drink that day & evening. Quite a bit. I pull Cindy aside and ask if she would be okay with him crashing in our hotel because I didn’t want him to drive. Luca was insisting he was fine to drive but I didn’t feel good about letting him drive the 1 hour back home. I told her I would pay for a hotel room for him if she was not okay with him staying with us. (I would pay for a room because I felt like if I told him to book his own room he would likely just drive home instead).

She was totally cool with him staying – I made sure to ask several times and tell she she could say exactly how she felt because her feeling of comfort was the priority and I could just get him a room instead. She assured me it was fine and we pushed the two beds together.

The next morning Luca was gone. I asked Cindy if she knew when he had left and why. She avoided the question for a bit until I asked again and she said he had left because I was snoring.

This was a very sensitive issue for me: at the time I had nose surgery planned because y nose holes were oddly shaped, making it hard for me to breath while working out and sleeping, so hearing this immediately hurt me and I took her word for it.

We had a great weekend and Luca never came up in conversation again and I wrote him off.

When we left, I get a message from Luca who said that he hadn’t wanted to message me when he knew that Cindy and I were still together. Essentially he told me that I had fallen asleep immediately and that Cindy climbed ontop of him and started sucking on his fingers. And that’s why he left.

I believed him – I know how Cindy is with attention. It also made her reaction and micro-expressions make sense when I asked her where he went, which at the time, I thought was because she didn’t want to hurt my feelings.

I didn’t bring it up with Cindy. I didn’t have deep feelings for Luca and she knew that. I thought Cindy was embarrassed because she was in a committed relationship with a super amazing guy and was scared about what could happen. I hoped that at some point she would come to me and talk to me about it herself, so I never brought it up. I didn’t want to accuse her, and I didn’t want her to lie to me. I just hoped at some point she would come clean to me about it and we could move on from it. 

Our workplace was going through and organisational re-shuffling. Everyone in the organisation spoke to the Big-Boss about where they see themselves in the organisation, and what their hopes are for the future.

My talk with the Big-Boss did not go well. I was hoping for a position that reflected my education and background be he said he didn’t see me in that position. I was truly devastated.

Of course, I confided in Cindy and cried about it to her for the next few days. This position would have been my dream and I felt totally crushed, demotivated and frankly humiliated with how the Big-boss spoke to me.

A couple days after my meeting with the Big-Boss, Cindy had her meeting with him. She sent me a very long voicenote after her meeting, telling me how the Big-Boss had praised her and said she was doing such outstanding work and offered her any position she wanted – including the one I had hoped for. She has no education or background into this specific field.

I was totally crushed. Especially in the way that she shared this information with me – in a voicenote relaying how amazing he said she was and even ended the voicenote with “oh it sounds like I am bragging hahaha”.

I couldn’t figure out what was wrong with my work and my background that I was not given the chance in the position I had hoped for, so I went directly to the Big-Boss and asked him.

Turns out: he never offered her that position.

He really wanted her to stay with the work that she had, because it played an important role in the organisation.

After hearing that, I cut all contact with her immediately and without explanation.

She has tried on several occasions to message me (I blocked her) and talk to me in the workplace – I just avoid her.

I just cant handle the lying and I am sure if I confronted her about it I would just be lied to again, and I could not handle that betrayal again.

The problem is: now we are in the same small team, sharing an open office space. I have basically completely isolated myself from the team because I do not want to make contact with her. I don’t go to after work-drinks or coffee breaks with them because being around her makes me so angry. This makes me look like the “bad guy” and she is seen as the cool one who is lots of fun to be around.

Meanwhile, every time she makes one of her many comments about being a “girls girl” and about how she is a feminist I have to hold myself back from sending her the screenshots from Luca or telling her I spoke to the Big-Boss about the supposed positions her offered her.

I am the only one losing here and I am fully aware I am doing it to myself.

I know I need to “grow-up” and get over it and act professionally and go to the after work drinks and the coffee breaks, but the lack of justice drives me absolutely bat-shit crazy.  How does this girl have everything fall into place for her, meanwhile I am making myself suffer because I don’t want the conflict and the contact would hurt me too much because of her betrayal.

Joxer – The lovable, slightly incompetent office worker. He’s always well-meaning but somehow ends up in all the wrong places. He’d probably be in IT support or as an assistant to someone important, bringing coffee to the CEO while accidentally breaking the printer.


Autolycus – The slick consultant or the guy from the accounting department who somehow always finds ways to save the company money—legally or otherwise. He's got charm, wit, and a penchant for turning even the most boring meetings into a heist-worthy adventure.


Virgil – The reliable, quiet intern who's always a step ahead of his peers without even trying. He probably has potential for management but enjoys the simplicity of his position for now.


Lao Ma – The wise, elegant, and spiritually balanced mentor figure, perhaps the company's Chief Strategy Officer or a senior consultant. She uses her vast knowledge and experience to guide others, maintaining a calm and philosophical presence in the corporate world. Her ability to solve problems with grace and diplomacy would make her a legendary negotiator or corporate peacemaker.

Velasca – The ambitious and cunning middle manager or senior exec who believes she deserves more power than she has. She’s always scheming for a promotion and isn’t afraid to step on others to get ahead. Despite her desire for control, she often underestimates the true strength of her colleagues.

And Akemi would be someone who keeps blackmailing CEO Xena 😭😂

Anyone else? :)

I feel like I’m at a crossroads. I’m in pain and need another perspective on my options.

I (F32) have been with my husband (M31) for 10 years. Until about six months ago, I didn’t fully realize how toxic our relationship had been.
	•	Whenever he complained about something, I would either give in, help him, or end up feeling ashamed of myself.
	•	He frequently criticized me for who I am and struggled to accept that I have my own needs and wants, which often didn’t align with his. 
	•	He was emotionally unsupportive—when I cried or needed comfort, he would just shut himself away in another room or criticized me.
	•	He barely helped around the house, didn’t cook, and I felt like I was living with a child.
	•	He has ADHD and struggles with confidence, which sometimes leads to rejection-sensitive dysphoria (RSD).
	•	He would often get upset when I didn’t want to have sex.
	•	And so many other little things.

Don’t get me wrong—I was still happy most of the time. We laughed a lot, had fun, traveled. He earns good money, pays for our apartment, and provides stability. But in many situations, I felt like I had to do whatever he wanted. I told myself it was just because he had strong opinions about things I didn’t particularly care about.

Then, six months ago, I had a realization: I am worth more than the way he was treating me. So, I told him I wanted a divorce. (Yes, I know—it was immature. I should have talked about our issues first, should have communicated what I wasn’t okay with.) He was shocked but didn’t want a divorce, so he started working on our relationship. We began seeing a marriage counselor.

And he has changed. He treated his depression, started showing me affection, tries not to criticize me, helps more around the house, cooks, brings me coffee. I truly appreciate it. But deep down, I still see the old him. Or maybe I just don’t believe he’s changed in the ways that matter most.

At the same time, I’ve come to realize a few things about myself:
	•	I don’t want to have sex with him. In fact, I don’t think I ever really had good sex with him. The intimacy isn’t there, and I don’t want to kiss him, even though I know he loves me.
	•	He can’t give me the emotional support I need when I’m at my most vulnerable. Instead, he shuts down—becoming either sad or angry. We’ve talked about this in therapy, but his response was, I want a grown woman, not a child.
	•	He’s not emotionally mature in relationships. Every time I try to have a serious conversation about the future, money, or life plans, he either asks me what I want so he can do it or turns it into a joke. Maybe I also lack the courage to push those conversations further.
	•	I don’t feel like I can share my thoughts and emotions with him because I don’t trust that he’ll understand, relate, or even take them seriously. Again, maybe he’s changed and wouldn’t do that anymore, but I can’t shake the image of who he used to be.

At the same time, we share the same values, enjoy the same lifestyle, and have similar future goals. He knows me well. We have so much history, inside jokes, a comfortable life. And now, he finally cares for me the way I always wanted him to.

I don’t know what to do. I’m terrified of leaving him. I struggle with codependency, and I’ve never lived on my own. But I also don’t know how to live without intimacy, sex, and emotional support now that I’ve realized how much I need them.

Maybe I can’t move forward with him because I still resent the past. Or maybe I never truly had chemistry with him and only liked the attention he gave me.

I really don’t know. I feel sooooo lost.

I’m not saying I’m perfect—I have my own issues, and I’m working through them.

I don’t even know what I’m looking for here. Maybe just some thoughts. Maybe to hear from others who have been through something similar.

TL;DR: I realized my relationship with my husband was toxic. He’s changed, and I appreciate that, but I no longer have romantic feelings for him. I don’t want sex or intimacy with him anymore, and I don’t know what to do.

Thank you.

EDIT: no kids. But I want to have them and I feel that the time is running out.

First I’ll get through the food review:
We are vegan and they have drastically improved their options and understanding of vegan preferences.
I had some tofu scramble (delicious) and tater tots.  One vegan double chocolate muffin.  One (specially ordered) order of vegan Mickey waffles.  Oat milk for my coffee.  Absolutely no issues, all of it was delicious.  They provided us with the allergen menu so we could easily see what on the buffet was vegan. Our server was excellent. 

Second: character appearances: one character was absent I forget which one.  We saw Mirabel, Snow White, Aladdin, Cinderella.  I appreciate these cast members SO much.  They work hard and have to deal with children, Disney adults like myself and everything in between.

Third: we were given wish cards to write down our wishes.  Yeah shut up I’m a Disney dork and I wanted to play along.  Little did I know writing down an actual wish would make me cry but it did and I did.  Not sobbing or noticeable maybe except to my wife.. but I feel like it was obvious.  My wife said it wasn’t.

I knew one day I would have to tell this story. It took me a year to finally sit down and do it. I’ve been told that doing this could help me move on, but that’s not what this is for. I don’t expect to move on. The girl in 402 will always be with me. I’m telling this story, simply, because I have to.

 

I lived there for two years. It was a tiny little unit, tucked away on the very right of the fourth floor. Bachelor is almost generous. It was the kind of dingy place that never looks bright no matter how many lights you have on, but I liked it. I’m good with a small space, I enjoy not having that much to take care of. I could do without the bug problems, the leaks, the electrical problems, and the rotten smells that just sort of happen, but it is what it is.

 

There was a level of comfort, as well, to living on the fourth floor. Nobody robs a random fourth floor apartment unit. Nobody can peek into your window. It’s unlikely to get shot at… Yeah, I lived in one of those kinds of cities. You didn’t walk around at night if you could help it. You just didn’t.

 

I got accustomed to noise there. The cars, the sirens, the dogs barking, the shouting, the occasional echoing pop of a gunshot. It all becomes a whirling auditory soup. I learned to tune it out fairly quickly. In fact, I learned to tune out a lot of things.

 

I was in one of those periods of life that I think some people call “the grind” but really it’s more like being beaten into submission. Working to live, living to work – not living at all, just continuing to exist. All of this to say, I wasn’t very perceptive or sociable at this time. I was sleepwalking and daydreaming through life.

 

I’d say I could do my routine blindfolded except for the fact that I would stub my toe in the same spot on the coffee table 4 times a week at least. Funny how that works. I guess that was part of the routine too. But that’s what I mean about not being perceptive. The building could’ve caught fire and most days I probably wouldn’t have noticed until I actually went up in flames. I didn’t retain any faces I saw or names I heard. It was all just a blur, each day blending into the next. Until one night.

 

I got home from work like usual in the evening as the sun began to descend past the buildings. I couldn’t afford a car, but thankfully my work was close enough to walk to. The days were getting shorter now so my walks home became more brisk.

 

The apartment still smelled of dust and paint as they had finally sent someone to replace a moldy bit of wall the day before. I could still feel the sensation of dust collecting on my tongue when I opened my mouth and it getting sucked into my nose with every inhale. The smell of paint was strong, but infinitely better than some of the other smells.

 

I opened the window to attempt to ventilate the place, I emptied the bucket of rust coloured water collecting in the bathroom (they couldn’t be bothered to fix that as well), and I collapsed onto my bed. This was my ritual. After every work day, I would always take 10-15 minutes to just spread out on my bed like a cat and decompress from everything. But tonight, after about two minutes, I heard a noise.

 

This noise stood out from all the outdoor soup because it sounded a lot closer, and it sounded like a voice. A soft, feminine voice; making some kind of subtle moan or whimper. I froze in place. It startled me. It sounded SO close. Like it might be in the room. I didn’t move a muscle; I didn’t want to make a noise. I wanted to hear it again so I could tell where it was coming from. For a second I thought it might be coming from under my bed.

 

After a few seconds, the sound repeated. A faint, girly whimper. A bit louder than the last one. This time I could tell where it was coming from. It was behind me. Specifically, the other side of the wall behind my bed. That gave me some relief. It was my neighbor.

 

But then I was confused. I didn’t remember EVER hearing my neighbor making noise before. If I could suddenly hear a noise that soft, that mild, why couldn’t I hear anything before? Did I even have a neighbor before? Is this person new? I felt a rush of shame at just how detached I had become.

 

I reached back into my mind to try and recall any memories I had about my neighbor. I couldn’t find a single one. I remembered some people being on my floor, but I couldn’t remember ever seeing anyone enter or exit the door next to mine. I did, however, recall seeing people yesterday morning trying to move a couch up the stairs in the lobby. It was a fairly regular occurrence to see things like this. People rotated in and out of this place all the time. I suppose nobody else really wanted to stick around that long, and I can see why. But I guess that answers it. As peculiar as it is, I didn’t have a neighbor before - for two years - and now I do. And now they’re… whimpering? Why are they whimpering?

 

Slowly these sporadic whimpers become more defined sobs. A woman was crying. I didn’t know what to do. I just decided to be as quiet as possible and put on some headphones to let them have their privacy and spare myself from feeling any more awkward. It felt wrong to hear this, and I immediately felt bad for this person. I made sure to play some extra loud music.

 

About an hour later, I removed my headphones and the noises had stopped in the interim. I very briefly debated going over and telling them about how thin the walls apparently are, but I made the much easier decision to wait. Wait until they do something loud and not so private so I can use that as the excuse. Like the TV or something. I was weighing my options. But I couldn’t talk to them about THIS. I couldn’t say “Hey you were crying real loud over there.”

 

The rest of the night was quiet but I didn’t have the best sleep. This disturbance in the routine, and the thought of having to face this person at some point was giving me some anxiety. By the morning, however, the alarm kicked me back into the routine. I heard no noises from the neighbor, so life resumed.

 

I got back home from work that night, much later than usual because someone decided to no-show at work. Walking home in the dark made me paranoid and I hated days when this happened. When I got inside I was relieved, and the dust and paint were not nearly as oppressive to the senses this time. I did the window, the water bucket, and then collapsed on the bed like clockwork. What happened yesterday was still on my mind, so I made sure to be extra quiet when laying down. After a few seconds of silence, I was ready to try and remove the whole ordeal from my brain. Then I heard the voice.

 

I couldn’t make out the first word I heard from the other side of the wall, but I listened for the rest.

 

“It was a poetry book.” I heard in a muffled but distinctly feminine voice. Quieter than yesterday, I thought. She must be further away from the wall.

 

“I can’t remember exactly.”

 

“It always feels like we’re going somewhere.”

 

“Maybe that’s why we see them most at night.”

 

“I mixed up our glasses.”

 

There was a moderate gap of a few seconds between everything she said. Clearly, I was only hearing half of a conversation. Phone conversation most likely, or else the other person is just insanely quiet.

 

It was difficult to gauge her tone from how muffled the voice was, but there was a kind of melancholy in it. I wondered what was going on, and I kind of laughed at how random the phrases were. I thought about listening further but I stopped myself. It wasn’t my business. It’s not for me to hear. I once again thought about going over and letting her know about the noise, but it didn’t feel like a good time. I put on my headphones once again to try and enjoy the minimal amount of respite I had left in the day, and that was the end of it for that night.

 

The third night I got home on time. I was a bit surprised not to hear anything from her at first. I guessed that maybe she went to bed early or went out for the night. It was Friday after all, usually people do things on Friday nights. I still made sure to be quiet when near her wall just in case she was sleeping. I made a mental note to look up how much soundproofing panels cost. I probably should have thought of that earlier.

 

I got up from my 15 minute “work sucks” bed sprawling and headed over to my computer to do that important research, but – as I often did – I forgot my coffee table exists and I stubbed my toe. The heavy table shifted inches across the wooden floor and pain shot through me like a shockwave. I don’t remember which expletive left my mouth involuntarily that time, but it was definitely one of them. I was so annoyed. Every damn time. I could just move the table, why don’t I ever just move the fucking table?

 

“Are you okay?” My heart leapt in my chest. I physically jumped back on one leg. I thought she wasn’t home, and I forgot how close she could sound. It scared the shit out of me. She also spoke quite loudly, she probably assumed it would be harder to hear through the wall than it was.

 

“Oh. Yeah. I’m good. Sorry. I just stubbed my toe.” I responded back in a shaky voice.

 

 “Shit. That sucks.” I could hear a chuckle in her voice, she was clearly amused. Her volume decreased to match mine.

 

I laughed in return, “It happens ALL the time… So sorry to disturb you.”

 

“No no it’s fine, I’m just reading… You sure you’re good? That sounded violent.” She responded, sounding half-concerned and half-joking.

 

“Yeah, no, I’m alright. It sounded worse than it was. It’s a heavy table and… the walls here-“ I began to explain before she cut me off.

 

“They’re REALLY thin, huh?” She finished my thought and then continued, “I can hear you so well, that’s insane. I’m surprised I didn’t hear you before now.”

 

“Yeah I guess I’m quiet... And, well, I’m at work most of the day and get home late. So.” I didn’t like how awkward I sounded. I think I forgot how to have normal conversations.

 

“Has it been noisy for you? I’m sorry if it was, I didn’t know. I just moved in.” She sounded very kind, and friendly. I was taken aback by it a little bit.

 

“Oh, don’t be sorry and… Nothing much. I think I probably heard you talking on the phone a bit the other night. I didn’t listen in or anything, I put on my headphones.” I explained. I hoped she believed me about the headphones. It was the truth but, it’s hard to trust that sort of thing. I didn’t mention the crying, I didn’t want her to feel awkward or anything.

 

“Oh. Sorry about that...” She said. I detected a hint of confusion in her voice but I ignored it.

 

“It’s okay. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you earlier. I just didn’t know when it would be a good time and... It’s new to me too. I didn’t have a neighbor before, I don’t think.” As I spoke, I found it harder to rationalize why I hadn’t told her before now… I really should have.

 

“Really? How long have you been here?” She asked.

 

“Two years.”

 

“No one lived here before me for two years? Are you sure?” She was very perplexed.

 

“Well… Honestly, no, I’m not sure. I just never heard anyone before, and I never saw anyone before.” I probably sounded like a total recluse, but I was more interested in why she was so confused.

 

“Oh. That’s strange… I’m pretty sure there were people living here right before me, at least that’s what the guy said.” Her tone had shifted, and what she said sent a bit of a shiver down my spine. It didn’t make any sense. How could I not hear them, not once, when I can practically hear this woman breathing?

 

After a brief silence, she spoke again and returned to a more casual tone “Well… Maybe they weren’t around much. Maybe it was a second home or something. Anyways, sorry again about the noise. I’ll get some soundproofing stuff for my end right away.” I admired her positivity, and I didn’t feel any judgment from her for how strange I probably came across. It was really nice. And she had a point about it being a second home. That could be the case. I don’t know why they would have a second home in this shitty building but… What else could the explanation be?

 

“I’m Jane by the way. Nice to kind-of meet you.” She added in a chipper manner. While it was refreshing to have such a pleasant interaction, a small part of me worried about her. She was so carefree and optimistic – almost naïve. She must be new to the city. I wondered how long it would take before this place whittled away at her trust in humanity. The trust that she seemed to give to me so freely. The thought of her spirits being slowly crushed like mine made me sad.

 

“I’m Leigh. Nice to meet you too.” A small impulse told me not to give my name, but I decided to reciprocate her trust. “And yeah, I’ll soundproof my end too.”

 

“Have a good rest of your night. And be careful.” She said. I found that slightly ominous but then I remembered the toe thing.

 

“I will.” I chuckled. “Enjoy your book.”

 

That was my first conversation with the girl in 402. Over that weekend, we spent a lot of time getting acclimated to each others’ presence as we each waited to get our soundproofing. I expected it to be a lot more awkward than it was. I attribute all of that to her. She had a way of making everything seem fine, and almost playful. She would knock on the wall two times and say things like “about to vacuum, sorry” And “my bad” when she would make noise. I would follow her lead and do the same two knocks. It was kind of nice.

 

Out of the blue on Sunday, she knocked twice and said “You know… it’s weird. I don’t hear my neighbors on the other side at all. Only you.” We pondered over that a bit. She didn’t seem to sweat it much, but it WAS odd that it was only on one side. These odd things were beginning to stack up. Why just this wall? Why only now? I began to wonder if more odd things have been happening all along and I’m only starting to notice them now.

 

Monday night I got home to find my package had arrived. The soundproofing was here. It was a little bittersweet seeing it on my doorstep. I knocked twice and told her I got it. She confirmed that she got her’s too. She actually went out and physically bought it. I guess that speaks to the kind of people we are.

 

We both said we’d put it up right away. Both of us not wanting to continue to inconvenience each other any longer… But then that didn’t end up happening. Instead we just kept talking. I didn’t mean to, and I don’t think she did either, but we just kept finding more to say. The friendly small talk about the building and whatnot gave way to more meaningful conversation. We talked about how we got to where we were. We talked about where we wanted to go from here. I wound up sitting on the floor with my back to her wall and I could her hear words right behind my head as if we were back-to-back. Luckily the paint on that bit of wall was dry by now.

 

To her, this place was a fresh start. She didn’t go into detail, and I didn’t want to pry, but it was clear that this was some kind of escape from something. Maybe that’s why she was so upbeat, because she was able to escape a bad situation. Or maybe, she was just always this upbeat.

 

She told me that she was going to enroll in the college here, and that she was going to start an online shop, and work as a waitress on the side. Eventually she wanted to open a restaurant. She even told me where, and what the name and theme would be. She told me all these plans, all these wonderful things she wanted to do, all laid out step by step. I don’t know what was preventing her from doing them before, but it made me smile hearing how excited she was about them. Something about the conviction in her voice made me truly believe she could do it all.

 

Then she asked me about my plans. I froze up a bit. I didn’t have plans. I wish I did, I was envious of people who did, but I could never seem to figure it out. At some point I think I shut that part of me off entirely.

 

“This was as far as I got” is what I told her. We sat in silence for a bit after that.

 

“There’s still time.” she said softly, breaking the silence. I could feel in her voice a new level of comfort and safety. All guards were down on both sides. She knew what I needed to hear, and I knew somehow that those words meant more coming from her than they would anyone else. We simply got each other. In that moment, there was no wall.

 

Eventually we said goodnight, and agreed to put the panels up tomorrow. Those soft, comforting words rattled around in my brain all night long. They never really left.

 

I woke up early the next day, and I began putting them up before work. It was a bit sad at first, but it’s not like she was gone or anything. She was still right next door. We could just be friends normally now. I went to work excited about the idea.

 

On my way home, I decided that I would properly introduce myself face to face. Just to say hi. I felt confident enough in doing so by this point of knowing her. I got up to the door of 402, and after a brief hesitation, I did the two knocks.

 

About two minutes passed and there was no answer. I tried again. Still nothing. I was disappointed but not dejected. She must not be around. I’ll try again tomorrow, I thought.

 

When I got inside, I was immediately struck by how much quieter it was. All that constant city noise was getting absorbed by the panels. I didn’t even think about that. I wasn’t used to this kind of quiet. Now every small sound was large. I felt vulnerable. Like all the noise was a big comfy blanket I could hide under and now I’m exposed like a nerve. It would take some getting used to.

 

An hour passed in this utter dreary silence. I tried to brave it without distraction to try and acclimate as quickly as possible, but it was just too freaky, so I had to put on some music.

 

Not five seconds into the song, I heard “No way!” coming from the wall. It was her.

 

“Jane? You can still hear me??” I almost shouted in disbelief.

 

“Did you put your things up?” She responded; her voice was exactly as clear as before.

 

“Yeah! Did you?”

 

“I covered the whole wall!” She shouted.

 

“What the hell?” I was feeling mixed emotions. On one hand, it was nice to talk to her again. On the other hand… What the hell?

 

We were both utterly stumped by this. Neither of us could come up with an explanation or a solution. She offered to try and ask the super to come do something. I told her she could TRY.

 

Eventually we settled back down and accepted the situation.

 

“Well… Shit, I guess you’re here to stay.” She said.

 

“I guess I am.” I couldn’t tell if she was happy about this or annoyed. I couldn’t quite tell if I was either.

 

“Alright… I hope you like ABBA then.”

 

I hated ABBA. This was a nightmare.

 

We resumed our routine from the days before. It remained mildly inconvenient, while also being oddly comforting. That night we talked more, sat in the same spots on the floor as the night before. I don’t know why we chose to sit on the floor when both of our beds were right there, but it felt right. The discoloration of the new patch of paint on the wall marked the talking spot perfectly, and it felt a bit nostalgic. It’s not often you sit on the floor as an adult.

 

With all the excess noise being drowned out, it felt like she was even closer. I could literally hear her breathing. We talked a little bit about our upbringings, and we aren’t terribly different. Her dad sucked, my dad died. We all got fucked up somehow. The good news is, she informed me that I don’t snore loudly at night which is a huge relief.

 

I laid up in bed, after she had said goodnight. I still hadn’t acclimated to the silence, and now I had to bear it if I wanted to sleep. It wasn’t working. I was just awake with my thoughts, which is a place I usually hate being, but not so much tonight.

 

I thought about Jane, and I thought about the weirdness of this situation. As odd as it all was, it was at least interesting. By far the most interesting thing to happen to me since I moved here. I began having those middle of the night urges to google the principles of sound waves and how they travel. Or how often apartments are vacant for long periods of time. But I resisted, determined that if I laid here unmoving in the dark long enough, sleep would happen.

 

Briefly piercing the silence, I heard a mattress creak a few times and blankets shift. It sounded like she rolled over. Then back to nothing.

 

I checked the clock. 2 am. Maybe sleep was hopeless. I stared into the dark of my apartment so long I started seeing abstract shapes and folds fade in and out of the shadows and the walls seemed to wobble, as they are want to do. I was so tired.

 

I began to fade but then another mattress creak brought me back to lucidity. This one was different. It was a deeper creak, and singular, like one fluid motion. She sat up.

 

Without question, that was the sound... But that was the only sound. No creaks, no fidgeting, no swiping sounds of blankets moving while she slowly awoke. It was strange and abrupt. It could be that she had a nightmare, but there was no heavy breathing or gasping or any of that.

 

I waited to hear another sound, but it didn’t come. A half hour passed. I didn’t hear her get out of bed, I didn’t hear her lay back down. Was she just… sitting? My mind began to paint of picture of a woman sitting still in bed in the pitch black darkness and it unnerved me.

 

Maybe she did lay back down, just slowly and softly enough that I didn’t hear it, I thought. Maybe she had her book or something - she said she was reading the other day. Maybe she never sat up at all, and I mistook that sound for something else.

 

I didn’t hear anything else that night, and about an hour later I managed to get some sleep.

 

I wondered if I could bring this up to her. Would it be weird? Eventually I decided against it. I don’t want her thinking about me listening to her sleep. The situation is already a bit uncomfortable as it is when it comes to privacy. Plus, it was probably nothing.

 

The next night I got home and double knocked on the wall. She double knocked back. This was our new normal.

 

“Hey, never date a tennis player. You know why?” She said.

 

“Why’s that?” I responded through my grin as I dealt with the water bucket once again.

 

“Love means nothing to them.” She made sure to sound extra dramatic.

 

“That’s – wow. That’s tremendous.” I responded, bemused.

 

“I’m gonna hit you with one of those every day, I decided.” She said emphatically.

 

“Oh god.” I pretended to sound annoyed.

 

“That’s right. This is why I don’t have a boyfriend. They all run away. But you can’t run away.”

 

“I can move away.”

 

“No you can’t, you’re broke as shit just like me. If you could have, you would have by now.” She had a point.

 

“So deal with it. Here: what do you call a beehive with no exit?” She continued.

 

“No. No more. This is harassment. I weep for your future husband... When you bring a man over, I’m going to shout at him to run as fast as he can. I will just scream bloody murder until he leaves.”

 

“Un-BEE-LEAVE-able.”

 

“God damn it. I like that one.” I replied, I couldn’t lie.

 

“Also I’m never bringing a man over here, are you kidding? You hear enough as it is.” Again, she had a point.

 

We went about our business, and later that night we talked a bit more. These floor chats before bed we’d started having had become a highlight of my day and I began looking forward to them while I was at work.

 

A part of my brain was trying to recontextualize this into a romantic thing, but it really wasn’t that, and I didn’t want it to be. At least not right now. It was just… nice. It was nice having someone to talk to, who was easy to talk to, who made me laugh, and who I felt comfortable with. It was nice to feel genuinely connected to somebody after feeling disconnected for so long. It was nice to have a friend.

 

“Can I ask you something?” I inquired.

 

“Yeah.” She answered without hesitation.

 

“Why did you trust me, so early on?” I had this question for a while but I felt comfortable enough now to ask.

 

Jane paused for a moment before responding, “What makes you think I trusted you?”

 

I was a bit taken aback by her question. “Oh. Well, you were just so friendly and… open. I was just wondering… This is a seedy place and you don’t know me…”

 

She cut me off “I was friendly, yeah, but that’s… That’s how you have to be. That’s like ‘customer service voice’. I don’t want to anger the strange man living next to me, you know?”

 

That made a lot of sense, I didn’t think of it that way.

 

She continued, “But I trust you now.”

 

“Yeah?”

 

“Yeah. I think you’re a good guy. I think you probably won’t kill me… What about me, do you trust me?”

 

“I mean… I’m still not 100% convinced you exist to be honest. I’ve still never seen you. You didn’t answer your door when I tried to say hi so… You might just be a figment of my imagination. Who’s to say?” I joked, but a part of me thought that would actually explain things.

 

“Wait when was this?” She sounded surprised.

 

“Oh, after we put up the sound proofing. I was gonna say hi when I got home from work, but you didn’t answer.”

 

“Really? Damn. I didn’t hear you.” She responded, sounding legitimately disappointed.

 

“Well that’s a first.” I joked.

 

Jane chuckled, “I know, right?”

 

I sighed, “Alright I gotta try to get some sleep tonight. Last night was fucking awful.”

 

“Yeah? I slept like a baby last night, these soundproofing things rule.”

 

…She slept like a baby? The image in my head of her sitting up in her bed replayed and gave me chills once again. Clearly, I must be mistaken. I shook off the thought.

 

“Well I still need to get used to it… Goodnight Jane.”

 

“Hear you later, Leigh.” That corny son of a bitch. She was serious about doing those jokes every day, wasn’t she?

 

I heard her get up and make her way to bed. A few minutes later and her side fell quiet. I crawled into my bed and I once again stared into the dark. Sleep still wasn’t coming easy. I dreaded this, but this time it only took about an hour to fall asleep, of which I was grateful. The silence still unsettled me.

 

Suddenly I awoke, still in the darkness – even deeper now. I don’t know what woke me up, but when I checked the clock, it was 2 am. I wasn’t happy. I tried to fall back to sleep, and it was slowly working until… I heard it again. That same deep bed creak. That unmistakeable sound of someone sitting up. Now I was fully awake.

 

Minutes past and I heard nothing else. Same as before. Like she was just… sitting there. This time however, I just had to know. I was confused, concerned, and pretty creeped out. So I just leaned close to the wall and whispered:

 

“Jane?”

 

Nothing happened at first. But then I heard the bed very slowly begin to creak again. Agonizingly slow and subtle. It sounded like she was… turning. Or at least adjusting her position in some way. I heard what sounded like her hands touching the wall, splayed out far apart on either side of me and then… I heard her breathing.

 

I could only hear her breathe before when we were sitting back-to-back against the wall, so she must have been pressed right up against it. Her breathing sounded different this time, though. It sounded hollow, like she had a cold. I was petrified. The hair on the back of my neck was standing on end. What was she doing? Was she even awake? What must she look like right now?

 

I just stared at the wall. Imagining her on the other side, pressed up against it like some feral thing. Was this really happening? Am I just too tired and loopy to be able to tell? Maybe the creaking was her laying back down and she’s just breathing heavier than normal because she’s asleep. I wanted to rationalize this so badly.

 

I waited for something else to happen, some other sound… I waited hours… But nothing did, and I was too scared to say anything else. Was she still there? Was she pressed against the wall all night long? I tried to get a little bit of sleep. I managed maybe 45 minutes but it was not pleasant.

 

I couldn’t focus on work the next day. I was tired, and I was so creeped out by what happened. I couldn’t think of an explanation. But I knew there had to be one. There had to be something. I couldn’t get the image out of my head, and every time that image replayed, she looked a little bit less human. I pictured her smiling a grotesque toothy grin. I imagined her drooling, her eyes open as wide as saucers, her fingers long and bony caressing the wall. None of this was rooted in reality, I knew that, but I couldn’t help but think of it.

 

I got back home and this time I hesitated before doing my customary knocks on the wall, but I did, and she returned them - same as always.

 

“I was just thinking… Mankind has made a lot of great inventions.”

 

“Jane...”

 

“But the dry-erase board has to be the most remarkable.”

 

I laughed. I wasn’t sure if I was going to be able to laugh at her jokes today, but I did. She’s still Jane. At least she seems to be. I was way overthinking.

 

“That one’s pretty good, I can’t lie.”

 

“You like it?” She asked, sounding proud of herself.

 

“I do... Hey I have to ask you something though.” I said, trying to remain at least somewhat casual.

 

“Shoot.”

 

“Do you… Sleepwalk?”

 

The other side went silent for a minute. “Um. No… Never in my life.” She responded, instantly sounding unnerved.

 

I fell silent too… I didn’t know how to explain. But she continued.

 

“That’s a scary ass question to ask out of nowhere. Did you hear something?”

 

“I heard… I don’t know exactly what I heard.”

 

“Stop. Don’t talk like that. Is this revenge for the corny jokes? I’ll stop the corny jokes. Don’t do this to me.” She pleaded in a half-joking manner.

 

“No, I promise I’m not messing with you - and it’s probably nothing. It’s just… You didn’t get up at all last night? Or the night before?”

 

“No, I did not get up at all. Please tell me what you heard.” She said firmly.

 

I told Jane everything that happened. I tried to be delicate, but also honest. I trusted that she didn’t know what was going on. That became evident to me by how freaked out she seemed. I know it sounded crazy, I just hope she didn’t think I was messing with her. It was difficult to tell from her tone.

 

Initially she wanted to debunk it all, saying that I must have heard something else – which I admitted could very well be true. Nevertheless, she told me she was going to stay with her sister for the night. Probably a good idea. She gave me her phone number and told me to call if anything happened. That put my mind at ease about whether or not she trusted me.

 

I told her to be safe, and she tried once again to reassure me that it was probably nothing, but I felt a sense of immense dread as soon as she left. Suddenly I really didn’t want to be alone here.

 

That night was the quietest of my life, and not in a good way. I thought about drowning it out by putting on some music or a movie, but nothing felt right.

 

I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to sleep that night, but eventually I managed. I ended up having a dream about a woman wearing a veil. through the veil I could vaguely make out three large black holes where her eyes and mouth should be. I couldn’t recall anything that happened in the dream… Only the image of that woman. I wondered if that was my subconscious way of trying to visualize Jane. I still didn’t know what she actually looked like so maybe my brain had trouble coming up with distinct features for her. Or maybe it was something else entirely.

 

It was still dark when I awoke from the dream. I felt a deep unease as I checked the time. 2 am, again. This time I wasn’t eager to fall back to sleep. I didn’t want to see the veiled woman again, so I stayed up a little while longer, attempting to ease my mind. I thought of every possible way to reassure myself. Eventually I began to fall into a façade of comfort, until…

 

Creak.

 

I went ice cold. No. This can’t be. I didn’t just hear that.

 

It was that same “sitting up” creak. But I heard Jane leave. Could she have come back late while I was sleeping? Maybe. But what if it isn’t her?

 

What if it was never her?

 

My mind raced. So many improbable scenarios played out in my mind. None of them were good. Was someone else in there with her the whole time and she didn’t know? Someone hiding away, only coming out when she’s sleeping? Was that creak her sitting up, or someone else sitting down? Do they watch her sleep?

 

All I knew for sure was that someone was on the other side of this wall. Because I could hear them breathing again.

 

I wanted to do something. I wanted to know for sure. But I was powerless. Calling out to it last time was the most horrific mistake of my life, I didn’t want to try that again. I wanted to call Jane but I was afraid of making a sound. Instead I just waited, and listened.

 

I was in a petrified daze. Hyperalert but also completely exhausted. My body wanted to shut down but my brain wouldn’t let me. It may have been minutes, or it may have been hours, I couldn’t tell. The image of the veiled woman kept reappearing in the back of my subconscious.

 

Eventually I decided to call Jane. If I heard a phone ring on the other side, then I would know. I typed the number in and hit call…

 

“The number you are trying to reach is not in service.” What? How could that be?

 

Suddenly, cutting through the silence was a sound I had become very familiar with, and yet was the one sound I was the least prepared for.

I started reading *The Vaster Wilds* by Lauren Groff. I'm barely into the second chapter when this passage jumps out at me:


*""For even a good man was more deadly than the worst of bears, and she had seen what even a blind ancient bear with its teeth pulled out of its black gums and its claws cut off and its eyes blinded in pink cross-hatching could do. In the gardens upon the south bank, in the summer heat, she stood among the watching people in their finery, in their sickness of excitement; and her eyes could not be drawn away from where in the ring the heavy stinking slavering miserable bear had been tied to the stake. Yet when the ferocious dogs were loosed to tear at the matty miserable beast, the bear did calmly throw them, one two three, until all three dogs were broken and whimpering and the curs pulled themselves off with their front legs to discover some place to die in peace alone. And all around, the people jeered at the beasts both victorious and slain. But the girl had walked home carrying an ice of horror in her entrails, and that night the poor old bear entered into the worst of her nightmares, showing its gums with the abscesses of green pus until she sickened woke to the churchbells of morning. And this famous fighting bear was merely a city bear, unused to the thicker older forests of this new wild place, he was a bear that had been tamed. A wild bear would be many times more vicious and brutal than what she had known, like everything from this benighted land. It would be unthinkable in its scale and ferocity.*

*And men would be worse.""*

(For reference, we all started choosing the bear around April 2024. *The Vaster Wilds* was published in September of 2023).
