1ip7fqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ip7fqq/aitah_for_sleeping_in_while_my_fianc√©_does_the/,AITAH for sleeping in while my fianc√© does the morning chores?,"My (29f) fianc√© (33m) is incredibly thoughtful, helpful, and generous. I do my best to reciprocate and while I'm a supportive partner in other ways, in terms of keeping the house running, for multiple reasons most of that falls on him. He has never complained about the uneven workload and I check in about it regularly. Even though he says he is happy to do it, I have a nagging feeling of guilt for contributing less to the household operations than him.

Now, a little context:

(1) I have a couple chronic illnesses that cause me to have really low energy levels - I more or less always feel like I need to sleep, and when I sleep I sleep HARD. 

(2) I fairly recently started a new job that's in person five days a week and with much longer hours. If I'm on time, which as we will get to I usually am not, I leave the house at 7:30 and I don't get home until about 6-6:30.

So, you can imagine I'm beyond grateful to have found a partner who happily takes on a lot of household labor. And while I know there is more to a relationship than chores, the ways I contribute to the partnership - scheduling, being the calm one who has a level head, and providing emotional support to name a few - are less quantifiable and so in my head feel less ""valid"".

And now we get to the point of the post!

I've had a really hard time adjusting to my new earlier mornings. This is really going to make me sound like a princess, but the routine has always been my fianc√© wakes up first, takes the dog out, and wakes me up with coffee and breakfast when he gets back from the walk. Because I am such a heavy sleeper, I have never woken up with him to the alarm even though it's really loud. Genuinely, I don't know how I ever woke up on time before we were together and the truth is I overslept A LOT in those days.

I'm pretty lax about being exactly on time for work (I'm very lucky to be in a senior position where I get a lot of leeway and no one cares if I'm 15-30min late) and while it doesn't stress me out and it's never been an issue for my employer, it REALLY stresses my fianc√© out. Because of the time it takes him to take care of the dog walk/breakfast, I usually end up running late and he feels guilty and nervous every time I leave the house later than I should and I feel really bad about that.

A couple weeks ago we came up with a solution where one of us would take the dog out while the other made coffee and breakfast. This sounded great to me because it would reduce his stress level and give me an opportunity to pitch in with the household labor more. The one thing I said, though, is that since I don't wake up to the alarm he will have to wake me up. Since we came up with the idea, he has never woken me up so we haven't executed the plan once.

Every time we talk about how I need to leave the house earlier he brings up ""let's split up dog walk and coffee/breakfast duty"" and I say ""yes, I want to, I just need you to wake me up"" and he tells me he feels guilty waking me up and that's why he doesn't do it. Every time, I tell him he shouldn't feel guilty and I really want and need him to shake me awake once the alarm gets him up, but nothing changes.

So now we are stuck in a feedback loop and I feel like an asshole for him doing all the morning chores and me sleeping away and then stressing him out because I leave late for work. Please tell me - AITAH for sleeping in while my fianc√© does everything in the morning or is it a reasonable request for him to wake me up so I can help?",1,1739527778.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

I tried different things until I discovered simple, effective changes that improved my sleep in just two weeks. Here‚Äôs what helped:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Set a Consistent Sleep Schedule**  
I started going to bed and waking up at the same time every day‚Äîeven on weekends. This regulated my body clock and helped me fall asleep faster.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Create a Relaxing Night Routine**  
I ditched screen time an hour before bed and switched to reading or light stretching. Adding a calming herbal tea made it even better.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Optimize My Sleep Environment**  
I made my bedroom cozy with blackout curtains, cooler room temperature, and white noise. A supportive mattress and soft pillows were game-changers.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Limited Caffeine & Heavy Meals Before Bed**  
No more coffee after 3 p.m.! I also avoided late-night snacking and kept dinners light.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Mindfulness & Breathing Exercises**  
Practicing deep breathing helped me quiet my mind before sleep. Simple meditation worked wonders for relaxation.

These small, consistent habits transformed my sleep quality. Try them out‚Äîyou‚Äôll wake up feeling refreshed and ready to take on the day!

It took me about a week to feel healthy again. The color of my stool ist brown/light brown (which is good) and this sunday everything was as it used to be - i was incredibly happy.

1ip779u,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaltyMelromarcSquad/comments/1ip779u/maison_de_baddies_malty_route/,Maison De Baddies (Malty Route),"

The break room feels tense as five pairs of eyes watch your every move. Some gazes are defiant, others curious or calculated. The smell of fresh coffee fills the air as you prepare to establish your authority.

Welcome to your first day managing Maison De Baddies. Your office overlooks the main cafe floor, where your troublesome staff serves customers with varying degrees of attitude. It's time to show them who's boss.
Standing at the front of the break room, I clear my throat and begin my first address as manager of Maison De Baddies. ""Everyone, I want to start by saying that I truly believe each and every one of us can change our hearts for the better. With dedication and hard work, we can transform this cafe into something amazing. Remember, even the most troubled soul can find redemption through hard work and positivity!"" The room grows quiet except for a few muffled snores. Looking around, I notice Maid and Maid Mask had dozed off during my inspirational speech, their heads resting on the tables and chairs. ""Wow, that's the dumbest speech I've ever heard in my entire life,"" Midari says with a mocking smile, giving him a slow clap.

The silence breaks as Camilla perks up, her eyes sharp with criticism. ""Actually, speaking of redemption, I think you should know that you've been pronouncing our cafe's name wrong this entire time. It's French, so it's 'May-zohn duh Baddies ' - not 'My-zone Duh Bad-dees'. And please try to fix that awful accent. We have standards here at Maison De Baddies."" I look over to see Malty completely absorbed in her Nintendo Switch game, barely registering anyone else's presence as she plays Super Smash Bros. The other staff members start whispering among themselves, completely dismissive of my attempts to inspire them.

""I don't care if he pronounces it like an American tourist. I'm busy plotting my revenge and teaching these characters a lesson they won't forget,"" Malty mutters while mashing buttons on her controller. The cafe's reputation for trouble is clearly well-deserved, with staff openly mocking their new manager just moments after he arrived. ""Mhmm...zzz..."" Maid Mask's mask makes an odd snoring sound as she remains asleep in her chair. The situation has spiraled faster than I anticipated, but I can already see I'll need to approach disciplining this unique staff in non-traditional ways.
I walk across the break room to where Malty is sitting, leaning over her chair as she plays. Looking down at the princess as she mashes buttons, I say, ""Malty, do you know that plotting revenge is a sin?"" She continues playing without looking up, clearly unfazed by my comment."" I don't care if it's a sin or not. All I want is to destroy that fool Naofumi for calling me a [REDACTED],"" Malty says with cold determination in her voice. I straighten up, standing tall as I look at her. ""Violence won't resolve anything. I suggest you need a pep talk after this,"" I tell her firmly.

""No, now can you please stop bothering me because I'm trying to-"" Before she can finish her sentence, I reach out and grab her Nintendo Switch, turning it off with a decisive press of the power button. Her eyes snap up to meet mine, rage flashing across her face. ""Sorry but work first, play later - those are my words,"" I say, holding the Switch just out of her reach. ""You dare touch my things? Do you know who I am?"" The room grows quiet as other staff members turn to watch the confrontation unfold. Malty's face turns red with fury as she reaches for her beloved device.

""Oh my, looks like someone's in big trouble,"" Camilla comments with clear enjoyment as she leans back in her chair, sipping her coffee. ""About time someone put that stuck-up brat in her place,"" Midari adds with a wicked grin. I keep the Switch held high above my head, maintaining my authority despite the brewing tension. ""My, my... this is quite entertaining,"" Maid remarks with a hint of amusement, her professional mask slipping just slightly. ""Fine, you want to play games? Fine,"" Malty growls, suddenly switching her tactic. ""I accept your challenge, Manager-san. But know this - if you lose, you'll be the one doing all our dirty work.""
I stand tall and face Malty directly, looking at her with determination in my eyes. ""And what challenge is that?"" Malty's face breaks into a smug smile as she rises from her seat. ""The one who gets the best manners and proper way to serving the customer will be the one who will be the manager,"" she announces to the room. The other maids perk up, interested in the challenge. ""Challenge accepted, I say firmly. ""But if you lose, you and I need a pep talk,"" I add with a confident smile. The room fills with anticipation as we get ready to demonstrate our serving skills.

The next hour passes in a blur of activity as Malty and I move through the dining area, taking turns greeting customers with proper manners. Meanwhile, the other staff works behind the counter, with Maid and Maid Mask arranging desserts while Midari restocks drinks. ""My bet is on Malty, she's gonna win,"" Midari declares loudly from her position by the drink station. Camilla, however, shakes her head as she watches our performance. ""Sorry Midari, the manager actually has good manners. Malty keeps stumbling over her words - she's clearly nervous about serving,"" she points out with satisfaction. ""Perhaps Malty should practice baking a pie for the customers... that's proper maid work,"" Maid suggests thoughtfully. ""Manager-san is so cute when he smiles,"" Maid Mask observes with a gentle tone.

""Talking about smiles, why don't you open up your mask to show your real smile?"" Midari goads playfully. ""Sorry Midari, not gonna happen,"" Maid Mask replies firmly, but there's a hint of longing in her voice that I catch. The atmosphere in the cafe is electric as the challenge continues. ""Sir, would you like a refill on your coffee?"" I ask a customer politely, while Malty struggles with a simple order behind me. ""I-I mean, uh, w-what kind of dessert would you like?"" she stammers nervously, fumbling with her notepad. The other staff exchange knowing looks as Malty continues her awkward attempts at serving.
Malty rushes back with her notepad, almost tripping over a chair in her hurry. ""I-I got the customer's order right here!"" Her pen scratches across the paper frantically as she takes notes. Then, in her rush, she stumbles and nearly crashes to the ground. I spring forward and catch her before she falls, steadying her with one hand on her waist. Time seems to slow down as we stand there for a moment, hearts racing. ""Umm, next time be careful when you walk..."" My face feels hot. Malty looks up at me, her cheeks red too. ""Yeah whatever.... that was awkward,"" she mumbles, pulling away from my grip. ""I agree...""

The tension breaks as Malty brushes past me and heads to the counter. ""Guys, is the parfait ready?"" Midari's eyes go wide seeing how close I was to catching Malty. ""Yo, what the hell is that all about? Maid Mask comments from behind her mask. ""I wish I was the one who's falling for him,"" and Malty just blushed harder than ever before ""I'm not falling for anyone! I almost fell on the floor!"" Camilla just laughs and shakes her head. ""Eh, it's okay to like somebody - it's normal.""

""I agree with what Camilla says,"" Maid adds with a small smile. ""Oh come on, you all are such softies,"" Midari scoffs but there's less bite to her words than usual. Malty starts arranging the desserts at the counter, her movements less precise than before. The other staff members started moving around the cafe again, and the atmosphere became lighter despite Malty's embarrassment. ""Shut up everyone, I just didn't want to drop my notepad,"" Malty says, still avoiding looking at me as she works. A group of customers enters the cafe and Malty's professional demeanor snaps back into place, though her cheeks stay slightly pink.
With the cafe's closing time approaching, Malty and I stand near the entrance. I turn to Midari, who's cleaning the counter. ""Okay, who won the challenge? And when Midari hears who's gonna be the winner Midari calls out cheerfully ""Malty, it's always Malty!"" I look around at my staff, waiting for the others to pick the winner. ""The manager's performance was exceptional,"" Maid says softly while organizing her station. ""I agree, his manner of speaking to customers was very kind,"" Maid Mask adds through her mask. Camilla nods firmly. ""Yes, I vote for the manager too!"" Malty's jaw drops as she realizes she's lost. ""Okay, both of you can rest now but give us some privacy please"" The other staff members head to the break room, leaving Malty and me alone in the now-empty cafe.

I turn to face Malty in the dimly lit cafe. ""Are you ready for our pep talk?"" Malty sighs and leans against a nearby table. ""I guess I am..."" I started the pep talk with her with the words ""What's bothering you?"" For a moment she seems to struggle, then the words spill out. ""My family, they don't want me because of what happened with Naofumi. They act like I'm the only one who made mistakes... I manipulated everyone, made them think the worst of him..."" Tears start streaming down her face as she looks at the floor. ""I'm sorry, I'm so sorry to everyone..."" Her breakdown brings back memories of my own past lies, how I manipulated my girlfriend and boss at work before finding the right path.

""I've been where you are. I lied to people, and hurt those closest to me. But repentance is how we make things right, Malty."" I walk over and put a hand on her shoulder. ""After I realized my mistakes, I changed. I apologized, and made amends. And that's what you need to do - own up to your actions, ask for forgiveness, then prove you've changed."" I begin pacing the empty cafe floor, my voice carrying through the quiet space. ""You've got good in you, Malty. Everyone has the chance to make things right. Even when others judge you, keep trying. Show them the real you."" Through her tears, Malty listens intently as I share my story of redemption.
As the emotional weight of Malty's confession fills the space between us, I take out my phone from my pocket and open up my photo gallery. Scrolling through the pictures, I find the ones I need. ""See these? This is what I had to lose before finding the right path,"" I explain while turning the screen toward her. There I am at my old job, with my ex-girlfriend, at parties I now regret. ""Oh wow, you really mean it when you say you've been in my shoes,"" Malty says as she looks through the photos. Her tears slowly stop as she examines each image, seeing the changes in my life that mirror her own potential journey.

The photos tell the story of my redemption arc better than words. There's me at my company Christmas party, drunk and making bad decisions. Another shows me getting fired by my old boss after lying one too many times. There are pics of my ex walking away after catching me in a lie, her face showing pain. ""You really lost everything because of your choices, Malty says softly. But look at you now - you're a cafe manager, trying to help me..."" I nod, understanding crossing her face as she realizes how much a person can change. ""It takes time and hard work. You'll make mistakes, but what matters is how you respond to them,""

I slide my phone back into my pocket, the moment of connection between us feeling right. ""I'll try harder at this maid job thing. Maybe I can find my own path here,"" she says with new determination in her voice. ""That's all anyone can ask. Just try your best each day,"" I respond. I start toward the back office to get some final paperwork ready before closing. Malty follows, wiping the last of her tears away. ""Thanks for sharing your story. Not many would have done that,"" she says as we walk. Through the cafe's front windows, the streetlights begin to come on, marking the end of another day.
Walking into the break room, Midari finishes cleaning the counters while Maid and Maid Mask gather their things to leave. ""Hey boss, we're closing up now,"" Midari calls out to me. ""Good night everyone,"" adds Maid Mask in her soft voice behind her mask. ""See you tomorrow,"" says Camilla with a smile as she heads out. I pull out my keys from my pocket when suddenly I remember something. ""Oh and I forgot to give you back your Switch,"" I grab Malty's Nintendo Switch from my desk and hand it to her. Her eyes light up at the sight of it. ""Thanks again, Midari bought it for me. Do you think she had a crush on me?"" I scratch my head, trying to play it cool. ""Uhh, I don't know about that...."" Malty laughs about my reaction ""Me too, but I wanted a boyfriend so badly,"" she says, clutching the console to her chest. ""Well I want to have a new girlfriend,"" I tell her, making small talk. ""Where do you live?"" Malty asks. I point to the nearest apartment building across the street.

Malty's face suddenly brightens. ""That's my building too! I live in apartment 3B,"" she says excitedly. ""Seriously, are you guys going on a date now?"" Midari teases from the door, causing Malty to turn bright red. ""Good luck to both of you,"" Maid Mask says through her mask, a hint of amusement in her voice. ""We're not dating!"" Malty protests, but her blushing makes it obvious she wouldn't mind the idea. I head toward the back exit, feeling weird about this unexpected turn. ""Have fun you two,"" Camilla calls out as she walks past us, smirking.

I check my watch - it's past closing time now. ""We should get going, it's late,"" I say, trying to steer the conversation away from the apartment talk. ""Right, right,"" Malty agrees but keeps looking between me and the apartment building. ""Maybe we could walk together since we live in the same place?"" she suggests, twirling her hair nervously. I grab my bag, feeling awkward about rejecting her obvious invitation but not wanting to lead her on. ""Yeah sure, we can walk together for now,"" I reply carefully. The empty cafe feels suddenly too quiet as we stand there, just the two of us left.

1ip7775,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleCoffee/comments/1ip7775/wavy_tamps_how_do_the_grindertamper_exactly_work/,(Wavy tamps) How do the grinder+tamper exactly work and calculate?,"Regarding the Oracle, Oracle Touch, Oracle Jet...

Intro: I've been wondering how this exactly works. Because by default, using the double dose basket gives about 22g of coffee grounds. That's too much for most people, myself included. You can (try to) tweak this by adjusting the tamper screw and/or use a smaller (e.g. IMS) basket.

However. When the basket is a bit too small or the tamper is screwed down too low, you get wavy tamp issues. Unless you grind finer and more coffee grounds come into the basket (resulting in higher dose). *(Sometimes you can also fix this by making the basket a bit moist. But not always)*.

It's really annoying because some coffee beans require a more coarser grind. Always resulting in a wavy tamp, unless I pump up the dose by adjusting the tamper screw up, and/or use a larger basket. But again, that just gives too much coffee grounds.

This means, in the end, depending on the beans, you still end up with at least 19g of coffee grounds, but mostly 20g or 21g.

But.... Why exactly does it result in this? And how does the tamper work exactly? How does it calculate? Is the tamper a moving part that moves up and down as well? Or does it only spin around? Any technical people here that could explain it in great detail?

Because the single dose basket (with about 11g coffee grounds) works fine in general as well (unless you grind too coarse and/or adjusted the tamper screw to aim for \~8g for example).

My mind can't comprehend why it's possible to get a dose of 11g with single basket, but not 16g with a double basket.

The lack of control on the amount of ground coffee is really annoying.

With the growing demand for convenient, high-quality beverages, offering coffee through vending machines provides numerous benefits that go beyond just caffeine. Here are some compelling reasons why businesses should consider coffee vending services.

# 1. Boosts Employee Morale and Productivity

Providing coffee to employees is more than just a perk; it‚Äôs a productivity booster. Access to freshly brewed coffee during the workday can help employees stay energized and focused. A quick coffee break allows employees to recharge and return to their tasks with renewed energy, leading to improved concentration and efficiency. Having a coffee machine on-site also eliminates the need for employees to leave the office, ensuring minimal disruption to their workflow.

# 2. Cost-Effective Solution

For businesses, investing in a coffee vending service can be a cost-effective alternative to providing free coffee from cafes or hiring a barista. Coffee vending services typically have lower operating costs, as the service provider takes care of maintenance, refills, and any repairs. This is more affordable than regularly purchasing coffee from external sources, saving money while still providing employees with high-quality beverages.

# 3. Convenience and Time-Saving

A coffee vending machine offers a level of convenience that traditional coffee breaks cannot match. Employees can enjoy a cup of coffee at any time without having to wait in long lines at cafes or leave the premises. This easy access to beverages increases overall workplace satisfaction and helps employees maximize their time at work.

# 4. Variety for All Tastes

Modern coffee vending machines are designed to cater to a wide range of preferences. Whether your employees enjoy a classic black coffee, a creamy cappuccino, or a refreshing iced coffee, vending machines can offer all these options at the touch of a button. This variety helps cater to diverse tastes, ensuring that every employee can find a drink they enjoy.

# 5. Enhances Company Image

Offering high-quality coffee via vending machines can enhance a company‚Äôs image, both internally and externally. Employees and visitors will appreciate the company‚Äôs attention to detail and care in providing a pleasant environment. A well-stocked and professional coffee vending service can even leave a positive impression on clients and business partners who visit the office.

In conclusion, investing in [**coffee vending services**](https://ace-vending.biz/services/) provides businesses with an affordable, convenient, and effective solution that benefits both employees and the company as a whole.",1,1739526422.0,u_Sad_Lunch8508,0,1.0,False

It appeared at first to be a police raid, so Moran's gang were lined up against a wall. The ""police"" then pulled machine guns out of their overcoats, and shot Moran's gang. Moran, who was on his way to the hide out, saw a police car, and ducked into a coffee shop, thus saving his life.

Capote was the established Mafia head of the Chicago Nort Side, running bootleg operations, speakeasies, and also a dog racing track. During the previous two years, Moran had been moving into Capone's side of town and he also hijacked some of Capone's liquor shipments. Capone ultimately decided to take Moran out. Though initially it seemed like a victory for Capone, the massacre focused Federal attention on organized crime in Chicago, and would lead to Capone's downfall in the early 1930s.

It's too soon to have a casual chat over coffee. Honestly, I‚Äôm taking no chances. I don't want to give you any more opportunities to hurt me again. I'm sorry for being blunt.

On your side, our chats are deleted; like our history is erased. We have nothing online or in real life that leads back to us. I don't really know your friends and I assume most of them don't even know we happened. You can quite literally pretend that I never existed and it will ring true.

There's not a trace of you anywhere; you made sure of that. I think you already nuked all points of reconnection last December. It's like you kept the ball rolling on how many times you could prove you didn't want to see me or be with me. You need to understand that some things have permanent consequences and inflict irreversible damage. 

You don't get to choose or dictate the level of access you get to have with me. You don't get to make me forgive and forget. That‚Äôs on my terms. You chose to forfeit all of that access/connection when you decided you didn't want to be in a relationship anymore. You further reinforced your decision by taking additional steps after the breakup to erase me from your life. You get what you worked for.

Your words about loving me, staying with me, and caring about me never aligned with how you treated me or your plans (or lack thereof) in life. I'm no longer confused and I no longer hang on the things you say when you're in a good mood. I've instead made peace with the fact that you will never make sense and I'm choosing to move on. 

To be honest, I don't think you quite understand the gravity of the things you did. You're so used to getting away with cruelty and being with people who forgive you no matter what. 

You never cared that I was upset or hurt. If you could have me tolerate how sad I was but stay, you would've been content with my misery. You're only upset now because it's suddenly affecting your feelings and your life. You're reaching out to make yourself feel better and I realize that's why you kept coming back after each time you left me. You didn't care about me enough to truly fix things when I tried communicate. I was a just a convenient tool for you, and tools aren't supposed to have feelings; which is why you couldn't deal with me whenever I got upset. You just walked away.

I could make this email longer, but it's not my job to teach you empathy. 

I do want to wish you a happy birthday. I hope you spend it the way you want to and that you get lots of love from friends, family, and the people you value the most. I'm happy to hear that you're continuously working on loving and improving yourself. It will only get better from here.

I'm sorry if this wasn't the reaction you expected.  I prefer if we maintain no contact and this will be my last message to you.

Goodbye.

1ip6zca,https://www.reddit.com/r/inlaws/comments/1ip6zca/how_do_i_approach_my_mil_moaning_that_she_only/,How do I approach my MIL moaning that she only sees my son once a week,"My MIL and her partner (Tony) can be intense sometimes, they overstepped a number of boundaries when I was postpartum and it took a lot of pushing back to get them to take a step back. He is also quite controlling.

My MIL looks after my son 1 day a week. She kindly offered. It's been 15 years since her last grandchild was born, and she has since moved 3 hours away, so she doesn't see them that often. So she loves our son to bits. She's also very bored. Her and her partner only have each other. It is a strange, somewhat dependent relationship. She won't go anywhere without him, therefore, they don't do anything but go shopping once a week and go out for an odd coffee. It is clear she has too much time on her hands to think about things. Which leads into what's being said recurrently.

When my son was born, they kept showing up unannounced and sat in our house for hours. She just wanted cuddles with her grandson, but it felt like hours of my bonding time with him in those precious few weeks were being stripped away. No hint was listened to. We asked for a heads-up phonecall at least. Didn't happen. Eventually, my husband had words and said I needed my space. They listened for a couple of months, then it started again. I started to answer the door and unfortunately became quite blunt with them. I stopped offering tea and biscuits. Told them I needed to get my chores done. It did eventually work, although I feel bad that I had to be rude for them to take notice.

On one occasion; my MIL (who did have time with my son at least once a week here and there before the once a week babysitting started), said to me that she missed my son, and that I had to let her take him out for the day. I quickly said, ""I'm appreciating the time I have left with him before I go back to work, you know, I am his mommy"". She nodded, and that was the last time she said anything to me.

Over the last number of months, she brings it up with my husband. How much she misses our son. My husband works a lot of hours during the week, so only gets to see our son at the weekend. Our time is precious. He reiterates that to her.

Well yesterday, she said it again. Eight hours, once a week isn't enough. I'm growing tired of this. It's more than a lot of grandparents get to see their grandchildren. My mom looks after my son once a week also. My dad goes weeks without seeing him, due to work. I reiterated this to my husband.

She's unlikely to say anything to me again. But if she does, how to I say that once a week IS enough? She has almost this parent complex over my son at times, and I think she forgets that I'm actually his mother, not her. That my husband (her son), myself and our son are our own family unit, and we need our time too. 

But this keeps falling on deaf ears. How do we nip this in the bud? She also gets jealous if my mom sees our son for an extra few hours on the odd occasion if there's a family event or something. It's getting very tiresome.

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response‚Äîor lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the bustling metropolis of Neon City, skyscrapers touched the heavens, their dazzling lights reflecting off the sleek surfaces of futuristic cars. Yet, nestled within this urban jungle, an ancient relic stood defiantly‚Äîthe Old Grove Park.

As I strolled through the city's concrete arteries, the juxtaposition between the modernity of Neon City and the timeless serenity of the park became increasingly apparent. The cacophony of traffic was replaced by the rustling of leaves and the distant laughter of children playing.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

Through a thousand words, I explored the clash of ideals, the struggle between progress and preservation. The ancient trees became silent witnesses to heated debates at town hall meetings, where environmentalists and tech enthusiasts engaged in a battle of words. The juxtaposition of the towering skyscrapers against the gnarled branches of the park's oldest tree mirrored the tension in Neon City's collective conscience.

""What is the meaning of life?"" The question echoed in my mind, a relentless epanalepsis that demanded exploration. As I embarked on this freewriting journey, the repetition of the existential inquiry became the rhythm of my introspection.

For a thousand words, I delved into the varied perspectives of individuals wrestling with the ultimate question. From philosophers contemplating the intricacies of existence to everyday people seeking purpose in mundane routines, the epanalepsis served as a constant reminder of the universal quest for meaning.

The narrative weaved through different characters and their unique experiences, creating a tapestry of reflections that echoed the complexities of human existence. The repetitive structure became a literary heartbeat, pulsating with the shared yearning for understanding amid the chaotic symphony of life.

**Response to Prompt 27: Symbolism**

In the quaint town of Willowbrook, the arrival of a single dove carried profound significance. Its graceful descent into the town square was a symbol, an omen that whispered of impending change. As a budding novelist with a penchant for symbolism, I couldn't resist exploring the layers of meaning embedded in this seemingly mundane event.

For a thousand words, I dissected the impact of the dove on the lives of Willowbrook's residents. The mayor saw it as a sign of prosperity, the local florist interpreted it as a call for unity, and the elderly storyteller regarded it as a harbinger of forgotten tales. The dove's symbolism rippled through the town, influencing decisions and shaping destinies.

As the story unfolded, I traced the journey of the dove's symbolism, following its subtle influence on characters and events. The once quaint town underwent a transformative metamorphosis, and the symbolism of the dove became a thread that wove through the narrative, connecting disparate lives in unexpected ways.

**Response to Prompt 33: Catachresis**

In the dimly lit alleyways of Serpent's Hollow, darkness wrapped its cold arms around me‚Äîan eerie catachresis that mirrored the ominous atmosphere. The assignment was to explore the underbelly of the city, and as a novice reporter, I found myself navigating the labyrinth of deceit and shadows.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow. The crime lord, known as the Velvet Serpent, ruled the district with a velvet-gloved fist. His lair, a dilapidated mansion, exuded an air of faded grandeur that served as a catachresis for the empire he once commanded.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow. The labyrinthine plots, the twisted allegiances, and the morally ambiguous characters all found expression through catachresis, painting a vivid picture of a city where metaphor and reality intertwined.

**Response to Prompt 43: Epizeuxis**

""Never, never, never give up."" The words echoed in my mind, a relentless epizeuxis that fueled the protagonist's journey against insurmountable odds. In the dystopian world I crafted, where hope was a rare commodity, the power of repetition became a beacon of resilience.

For a thousand words, I immersed myself in the protagonist's struggle, exploring the emotional depth of the epizeuxis as a mantra against despair. Each iteration of the phrase became a battle cry, a whispered promise that carried the weight of a shattered world on its shoulders.

As the narrative unfolded, the epizeuxis became a driving force, propelling the protagonist through a landscape of desolation and uncertainty. The repetition served as a reminder that, in the face of adversity, the strength to persist often lies in the relentless echo of one's own determination.

As the final rays of the setting sun painted the sky in hues of orange and pink, I found myself at the edge of the cliff overlooking the vast expanse of the ocean. The salty breeze carried whispers of a story, and with every breath, I embraced the challenge of crafting an acrostic that encapsulated the essence of my journey.

**Response to Prompt 3: Hyperbole**

In the quaint village of Mistwood, where routines unfolded with the predictability of the sunrise, the arrival of a peculiar fortune teller sparked exaggerated whispers. ""This is it, the end of our mundane lives!"" proclaimed Mrs. Thompson, the town's eternal pessimist, as she clutched her cat, Captain Whiskers, with an air of impending catastrophe.

The hyperbole hung in the air, a thick fog of anticipation enveloping the village. As I delved into the story, the hyperbolic reactions of Mistwood's residents heightened the absurdity of the situation. What began as a mere visit from a mystical figure transformed into a fantastical escapade, with the fortune teller's prophecies shaping the destiny of the villagers in ludicrous ways.

Through the hyperbolic lens, I explored the comedic consequences of taking ordinary events to extraordinary extremes. The once mundane village square became a stage for outlandish dramas, with exaggerated gasps and dramatic swoons punctuating every revelation. In this hyperbolic haven, Mistwood's residents discovered the joy in embracing the absurdity of life.

**Response to Prompt 6: Assonance**

Amidst the rolling hills of Harmony Valley, where the soft hum of nature's symphony echoed through the meadows, a mysterious traveler arrived, bringing with them a melody that resonated with the delicate assonance of a forgotten tune. The townsfolk, captivated by the harmonious vibrations, felt an inexplicable connection to the stranger.

As I explored the narrative, the assonance became a musical thread weaving through the story, emphasizing the emotional cadence of the characters' experiences. The traveler's words, laced with vowel-rich verses, carried the echoes of a distant melody, leaving an indelible impression on the hearts of those who listened.

Through the lens of assonance, I delved into the subtle interplay of sounds that defined the atmosphere of Harmony Valley. The lyrical quality of the narrative mirrored the town's collective journey, where the resonance of shared moments and emotions harmonized with the traveler's enigmatic presence.

**Response to Prompt 7: Onomatopoeia**

In the bustling city of Metropolis, where the rhythm of urban life played out in a cacophony of sounds, a peculiar street performer emerged. Armed with an array of unconventional instruments, he orchestrated a symphony of onomatopoeic brilliance that echoed through the crowded streets.

The narrative unfolded with the vibrant expressions of onomatopoeia, capturing the essence of the city's sonic landscape. The performer's drumming evoked the rhythmic tap-tap of raindrops, while his wind instruments mimicked the whoosh of passing cars. The city, typically drowned in noise, became a canvas for this auditory artist.

As I delved into the story, the onomatopoeic symphony became a language of its own. The characters communicated through the vibrant echoes of everyday sounds, fostering a unique connection between the performer and the people of Metropolis. The narrative danced to the beat of onomatopoeic creativity, transforming the mundane into a dynamic celebration of city life.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the technologically advanced city of Silicon Haven, where sleek skyscrapers touched the sky and holographic billboards painted the air with luminescent advertisements, a hidden oasis existed‚Äîa pocket of nature known as the Zen Garden. The juxtaposition of these contrasting elements created a visual paradox that fascinated both residents and visitors alike.

As the narrative unfolded, the stark contrast between the city's cutting-edge architecture and the serene beauty of the Zen Garden became a metaphor for the characters' internal conflicts. The bustling metropolis symbolized progress and innovation, while the tranquil garden embodied the need for balance and introspection.

Through the lens of juxtaposition, I explored the dichotomy within the characters as they navigated the relentless pace of Silicon Haven. The Zen Garden became a refuge, a place where the cacophony of technology met the soothing whispers of nature. The juxtaposition served as a visual metaphor for the characters' quest to find equilibrium in a world defined by extremes.

**Response to Prompt 22: Metonymy**

In the political arena of Capital City, where decisions echoed through the corridors of power, a single phrase dominated conversations‚Äîthe ""Iron Throne Statement."" This metonymic expression encapsulated not just a policy decision but the entire narrative of political maneuvering that unfolded within the city's hallowed halls.

The story unfolded with the metonymy acting as a symbolic gateway into the complexities of governance. The Iron Throne Statement, while seemingly straightforward, carried the weight of a thousand debates, negotiations, and betrayals. Its impact rippled through the lives of citizens, shaping their destinies in ways they could scarcely fathom.

Through the lens of metonymy, I delved into the layers of meaning hidden within this political shorthand. The characters grappled not only with the literal implications of the Iron Throne Statement but also with the overarching themes of power, ambition, and the sacrifices demanded by political gamesmanship.

**Response to Prompt 24: Understatement**

In the picturesque town of Serenity Springs, where the days flowed like a lazy river and the nights were adorned with a blanket of stars, an unexpected event transpired‚Äîa subtle disruption that the locals described as ""just a minor hiccup."" Little did they know that this understatement concealed the unraveling of a cosmic anomaly.

The narrative unfolded with the charm of understatement, as the townsfolk continued their routines, blissfully unaware of the cosmic storm brewing beneath the surface. The serene descriptions of everyday life served as a stark contrast to the impending upheaval that threatened to reshape the very fabric of Serenity Springs.

Through the lens of understatement, I explored the characters' nonchalant reactions to the unfolding events. The once quiet river became a conduit for interdimensional travel, and the night sky, adorned with stars, transformed into a celestial canvas of possibilities. The charm of Serenity Springs became a poignant backdrop to the understated drama that unfolded, emphasizing the profound impact hidden within the simplicity of daily life.

**Response to Prompt 25: Clich√©**

In the small town of Nostalgia Haven, where memories lingered like whispers in the wind, a peculiar phenomenon occurred‚Äîthe resurgence of clich√©s. As the narrative unfolded, the once-endearing phrases like ""time heals all wounds"" and ""love conquers all"" took on a literal dimension, shaping the lives of the townsfolk in unexpected ways.

The story immersed itself in the world of clich√©s, where the seemingly predictable phrases became living entities with the power to alter reality. As characters grappled with the clich√©s that defined their lives, they discovered that beneath the familiarity lay profound truths and unexpected consequences.

Through the lens of clich√©, I explored the characters' journey to navigate the clich√©d landscapes of their existence. The town, once steeped in predictable routines, became a stage for the extraordinary. As clich√©s transformed into tangible forces, the residents of Nostalgia Haven embarked on a quest to unravel the mysteries hidden within the clich√©d fabric of their reality.

**Response to Prompt 31: Epanalepsis**

""What is the meaning of life?"" The question echoed in my mind, a relentless epanalepsis that demanded introspection. As I embarked on the freewriting journey, the repetition of this existential inquiry became a rhythmic pulse, guiding the exploration of diverse

perspectives on life's purpose.

For a multitude of words, the epanalepsis led me through a kaleidoscope of reflections. From the philosophical musings of scholars to the simple yet profound revelations of everyday individuals, each recurrence of the question served as a gateway into the vast tapestry of human contemplation.

Through the epanalepsis, I navigated the labyrinth of existential ponderings, unveiling the unique responses that individuals had forged in their quests for meaning. The relentless repetition became a literary heartbeat, mirroring the universal rhythm of humanity's collective pursuit of purpose and significance.

The narrative wove through the lives of characters, each grappling with the epanaleptic inquiry in their unique ways. Whether seeking solace in the grandeur of the cosmos or finding meaning in the simplicity of a shared moment, the epanalepsis remained a constant companion, echoing the perennial quest for understanding.

**Response to Prompt 36: Anadiplosis**

In the futuristic city of Quantum Heights, where technology intertwined with daily life like a seamless dance, a viral message spread‚Äîa mantra that echoed through the cybernetic veins of the metropolis. ""Create the code, the code creates reality. Reality shapes destiny, and destiny is but the code.""

The story unfolded with the rhythmic cadence of anadiplosis, each line flowing into the next, creating a recursive loop of ideas. The mantra became the heartbeat of Quantum Heights, influencing the lives of its denizens as they navigated the intricate balance between the virtual and the tangible.

Through the lens of anadiplosis, I delved into the interconnectedness of code, reality, and destiny. The lines blurred as characters harnessed the power of programming to shape their fates. Quantum Heights, once a mere city, transformed into a living algorithm, where the repetition of the mantra echoed in every pulsating byte.

**Response to Prompt 38: Asyndeton**

In the dystopian city of Emberfall, where the remnants of a fallen civilization lay entwined with the shadows of despair, a lone figure emerged‚Äîa rebel determined to dismantle the oppressive regime. The narrative unfolded with the rapid pace of asyndeton, omitting conjunctions to mirror the urgency of the protagonist's quest.

Through a cascade of words, the asyndeton propelled the reader through the city's decaying alleyways and towering citadels, each sentence building upon the last. The disjointed rhythm captured the relentless momentum of the rebel's journey, emphasizing the magnitude of the challenges faced in their struggle for freedom.

As the narrative unfurled, the absence of conjunctions served as a narrative device, intensifying the sense of urgency and desperation that permeated Emberfall. The rebel's asyndetic odyssey unfolded against a backdrop of shattered hopes and whispered rebellions, culminating in a crescendo of defiance against the oppressive regime.

**Response to Prompt 43: Epizeuxis**

""Never, never, never give up."" The mantra echoed in the desolate wasteland of Endless Sands, a barren landscape where hope was as scarce as water. Through the repetition of epizeuxis, the protagonist's internal resolve became a resounding anthem, a defiant roar against the relentless challenges of survival.

For a multitude of words, the relentless repetition of ""never"" served as a lifeline, propelling the protagonist through the harshest of environments. Each iteration of the phrase became a battle cry against the oppressive silence of Endless Sands, a declaration that reverberated across the vast expanse.

Through the lens of epizeuxis, I delved into the depths of the character's determination. The harsh environment became a character in itself, challenging the protagonist to defy the odds with unwavering persistence. The echoes of ""never"" transformed into a symbol of resilience, a beacon of hope that cut through the desolation of Endless Sands.

**Response to Prompt 50: Acrostic**

Amidst the starlit expanse of Cosmos Haven, where galaxies danced in celestial choreography, a cryptic prophecy emerged‚Äîa message written in the stars. As the narrative unfolded, I embarked on a cosmic journey guided by the acrostic hidden within the constellations.

For a cascade of words, the initial letters of key phrases illuminated the path of destiny for the characters. Each sentence unfolded with intention, revealing a hidden message that transcended the boundaries of time and space. The acrostic became a celestial guide, leading the protagonists through the intricate tapestry of their interconnected fates.

Through the lens of acrostic, I explored the cosmic forces that shaped the destinies of Cosmos Haven's inhabitants. The celestial bodies became storytellers, each constellation contributing a verse to the epic narrative written across the cosmos. As the characters deciphered the acrostic, they unraveled the mysteries of their existence, connecting the dots between the stars and their own profound journeys.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live?

**Cannes Diary**

>In the summer of 2002, Lynch served as a juror at the Cannes Film Festival so he brought along his trusty PD150 to document the experience. This was posted to [davidlynch.com](http://davidlynch.com) in 10 episodes, totaling over 80 minutes in length.

>Between 2005-2010, David Lynch posted a near-daily weather report to [davidlynch.com](http://davidlynch.com). A handful of Daily Reports can be found on YouTube and [archive.org](http://archive.org), but most seem to be lost to time.

[**Scene from a David Lynch DV Project**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJwtkaKUFyI)

>This was included on a promotional DVD for Avid Media Composer titled, ‚ÄúRoom to Dream: David Lynch and the Independent Filmmaker‚Äù. The bulk of the material on the disc was basically an ad for Avid, but at the end was this Lynch short, shot during the production of INLAND EMPIRE.

2006

2007  
[**More Things That Happened**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1dJYumtH14) (Criterion INLAND EMPIRE discs)

>This is a compilation of Sunset #1, Steps, and Dining Room Window.

[**Scissors (aka Absurda)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QXU4ZqVjJk)

>Originally released as part of the anthology film ‚ÄúTo Each His Own Cinema.‚Äù NOTE: I think the evidence is strong that this short film was never actually titled ""Absurda,"" but was mistakenly thought to be based on a misunderstanding. At the time Lynch made the film, his production company was called Absurda--had been for a few years at that point. When ""Scissors"" was first released as a part of ""To Each His Own Cinema"", there was no on-screen title, but only a title card crediting the production company. People saw the prominent text reading ""Absurda"" and no other title and mistakenly (though understandably) assumed it was the title of the short. When Lynch released it himself on his YouTube page, he called it ""Scissors."" That's the only time an official title was ever given.

**Out Yonder: Chicken** (Lime Green DVD Box Set)

>This was likely shot in the 2004-2005 era, but, unlike the other two Out Yonder shorts, it was never uploaded to [davidlynch.com](http://davidlynch.com). Its first release was as part of the Lime Green DVD Box Set.

Anyway it was what the I think was early 20s bar girl that escorted me to the alarm. She was super cute and bubbly and chatted with me for a few minutes while my supervisor was resetting the system and was super interested in my job. I generally think nothing of this because the general public love to chat to me about my job.

When I got the call over radio from my supervisor he was done and told her I had to go she said ""Well maybe you can tell me some stories over coffee sometime?""

Like a bolt of lightning, it hit me that this girl had shown me more interest in 5 minutes than my current partner has in the past year. I don't know if it was the uniform but I actually felt desired for once and I now have an inkling of self esteem. Rejecting her felt like a kick in the balls.

Coming into enemy territory, joking :) 

  
I have a Gaggia Classic Pro from like 2020 with PID installed (Shades of Coffee) and I was offered a Rancilio Silvia v3 from 2012 with Gagguino installed, it costs around 400 euros.

  
So my questions would be:

\- Would you do the switch? I have been thinking in doing the Gagguino myself on my Gaggia but I am lazy, have looked too into pressure gauge and dimmer, it's a lot of money to add vs how cheap the Rancilio is being offered.

\- What do you think about the age difference? 2020 vs 2012. This is what kind of backed me off to be honest.

\- I know the Silvias are better built and more sturdy, etc but what I dont know, is there any known problems like the leaky steam valve from the Gaggia for example? That ends happening to any model.

  
The seller also said this and I am not entirely sure what he refers to:

> i still have the original lamp for heating, as seen on the picture i changed it for a round one. there is also inlcuded a water level chip with some cables.

I used to struggle quite badly with things like overly drinking coffee or not being so stable with my workout routine and when she confessed to me, I was neutral about it now I believe I found the root cause for why I feel the incapability of loving, and it‚Äôs mainly because in my past, I was in a relationship that I was still in an impressionable state Because I was still so young and it was not a good relationship so it‚Äôs affected how I feel when it comes to loving and I‚Äôm still young and I don‚Äôt understand how to fix it logically I know that I am supposed to be happy or I‚Äôm supposed to be loving but physically I don‚Äôt feel like that for a short period of time and I don‚Äôt really recall how but I felt some sort of emotion like a panic whenever I would receive a text from this girl or worry about her a lot, and I also have a bad habit of overthinking and I believe I misheard something because this girl has been very very supportive, and I used to blame my incapable of loving on having a bad partner, but this is got to be one of the most mature people I‚Äôve ever met in the most well spoken person I‚Äôve ever met and of course, since then I‚Äôve come to understand that that‚Äôs not a valid excuse anymore, but I feel like after I misheard what I said what was said i‚Äôm losing a lot of my feelings for that love and I simply want to be someone who is capable of loving and being happy moving back to my past trauma with relationships, I can say I was a extremely emotional person compared to how I am now I would cry the smallest things. Hell when I was even younger I would cry at the peeps during Easter because I thought they were so cute and it‚Äôs crazy in my brain to think that over the last 4 to 5 years I‚Äôve changed on that scale entirely I went from being the emotional kid that would cry at everything or be extremely happy to being a teenager who feels like they know what I should be feeling however I don‚Äôt feel it physically and I‚Äôm sorry if this whole message sounds very like AI or anything I‚Äôm using dictation on mobile to send this, but has anyone else had issues like this? I really need someone to talk to. I have no clue how to fix this and I‚Äôm not very comfortable talking to my parents about it. It‚Äôs extremely stressing as it‚Äôs been like this for the last four years, thanks a lot. EDIT : 
Even though it‚Äôs highly encouraging because of how long this is going on, I would be totally fine being put up with medicine like Wellbutrin to help honestly it‚Äôs just tiring at this point I don‚Äôt feel like I need to kill myself or anything, but I just feel like extremely miserable without actually feeling it.

So as the title says, I'm a game dev who's specialised in 3D art for the past 10 years, and I'm just damn tired. For those who haven't been keeping up with the drama, the industry is in a bit of a rut right now, and I'm not sure how long my current roll is going to keep me going.

My skills are in blender/Maya, the adobe suite, zbrush, Unity/Unreal, all that jazz- the standard 3D artist list. I've dealt with some basic leadership style stuff, and also have some teaching under my belt, though I want to avoid management positions. I'm not sure if I wish to go back to teaching long term either, given the industry is in the state it's in. It feels a rough teaching students knowing 95% of them don't have a chance.

I frankly do not care for another games job, unless it's one of those rare unicorn roles with decent management that isn't crunching you the whole time. I do not care for another creative field, though it'd be nice, as I'm done with fighting 100 non burned out juniors and mids all for the same low paying roles. All I want is something reasonably fulfilling, with decent hours, the ability to take leave, and something my brain isn't going to completely switch off in. Something with a desk, some WFH, and good coffee nearby. If I get to create something in any form, or work towards other tangible goals, even better.

The things I care about at this point are environmental issues, sustainability, and helping people. I'm not looking for a bog standard corp desk job that sucks the life out of you. I love diving into hardcore nerd tools, and learning about systems and weird stuff, so something that scratches my learning itch would be great. However, I do not have the resources to go back to university/study long term- which throws things like learning how to build prosthetics (one of my ideas) out the window.

I'm now taking unique and novel ideas, nothing's off the table!

This show is about the very real danger of unqualified people pretending to be authorities on health, and how desperate people will cling to hope. We all just want to be told what the right answer is, when it comes to our health and our spirituality. There is SUCH big cross over between the alternative wellness industry and the spiritual/yoga/meditation industry.

I have personally seen so many sad stories of people who just want the answer on how to stop their suffering (physical, emotional, spiritual), that they are willing to do anything to follow the advice of ‚Äúan expert‚Äù. And it REALLY grosses me out when so many of these ‚Äúexperts‚Äù actively prey on vulnerable people for fame and money.

A single mom who took out huge loans she couldn‚Äôt afford for a course that promised her she would make tons of money teaching spiritual practices. A young woman who was brainwashed into joining a local cult after a retreat in India. The stories go on and on.

But this show hit me hard in other ways. I was diagnosed with a rare, aggressive cancer (same type as Milla, but different subset) and I used alternative therapies to treat it. AND I used conventional medicine ‚Äî surgery and radiation. For a lot of these rare cancers, chemo is a last ditch hail mary because so little research has been done on them that the chemo can‚Äôt be targeted enough to really impact prognosis. Thank god my cancer was caught early and treated quickly. I am healthy now, 9 years later.

I teach some of these alternative therapies, and have actually written a book about them. I was also invited to a large medical oncology conference to speak about them in use WITH medicine during/after cancer treatment.

I am very, very aware of how I communicate about these therapies, and their limitations. I am not an influencer, and am not trying to be famous. But I do believe in alternative therapies in general, when used with critical thinking skills (lacking in our general population!).

Here‚Äôs the crazy/sad part of my story. I knew one other person who had also been diagnosed with my exact cancer, and she was lovely. Also in the wellness space with a notable, real career (not an influencer). After I was diagnosed I called her to see how she was treating her cancer, since she had been diagnosed a year before me.

She was taking the alternative therapies to a place I wasn‚Äôt planning to, with the coffee enemas, twice daily specialty baths, vegan diet, tons of body work, etc. She did surgery but was declining radiation/chemo.

With these cancers, a single microscopic cell can spread and grow.

My friend was healthy for several years, before the cancer spread and metastasized around her body. She passed away a few years ago.

I respect her choice to govern her health, and she wasn‚Äôt publicly telling other people what to do. But it really hit close to me, of course.

So watching this show really brings up the major themes in my life ‚Äî my chosen career, and my own health, and my experience with cancer. It has actually been helpful for me, to sift through my story and reflect. A little weird though, with all the similarities‚Ä¶

** edited to add: another bizarre similarity of my story is that my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer while I was going through my treatment. Luckily it was very early stages, and she had an ‚Äúeasy‚Äù treatment and is healthy now.",10,1739523418.0,AppleCiderVinegarTV,1,1.0,False

We're staying at my parents place.

Yesterday, I wanted to work on a project all night (I'm a graphic designer), but I was feeling super groggy and tired in the evening. I also had a headache. I assumed I was catching the flu, so I drank some vitamin C, took paracetamol and went to bed early.

This morning, however, instead of waking up to a fever and sore throat, I was feeling refreshed and normal. I went downstairs to make some coffee, and my mother asked me how I slept. I said that I had a great night's sleep, to which she smiled, and said that the sleeping pill that she added to my tea last night must have worked well, since I was really knocked out last evening.

I was obviously pissed at her. I had a project that I wanted to finish by today morning, and her sneaking the pill into my drink ruined this plan. I will now have to figure out how to complete the drawing in under 4 hours, before the client wakes up, as well as do all the other things that I had to do today, and her pulling this off really messed up my plans.

I lashed out at my mother, asked what the f*** was wrong with her, and told her that if she ever adds anything fishy to my food or drink again, I'll buy hard drugs off of Telegram and sneak that into her meal, to which she said that I shouldn't be using the computer at night anyway, when normal people sleep, and called me ungreatful. She also said that I was ""on edge"" the whole day, that she just wanted to help, and now I'm threatening her, and asked if I was insane.

I know that I tend to overwork myself, but I have an apartment to buy out and stuff to do during the day, so I HAVE to work whenever I have time to do so. My partner wants us to get a hotel, but I just paid the next installment for my apartment, and we only have about 50$ left - not enough for a hotel room for 3.

My next payment will likely be in 1-2 weeks. Until then, we're basically forced to stay at my parents' place. What should I do until then? My mother isn't some evil psyho, but she can be controlling, and usually refuses to admit when she's wrong.  ",1,1739523407.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

**Episode 4: A Slice of Afterlife**

**FADE IN:**

**INT. RETRO COFFEE SHOP ‚Äì NIGHT**

The coffee shop exudes a cozy, 90s vibe‚Äîwarm neon lights, vintage posters on the walls, and the soft hum of an old jukebox. Rain patters gently against the windows. At a corner booth, **ALEX** and **SAM** sit with steaming cups of coffee. Between them lies an open folder labeled **""NEW MANAGEMENT PROPOSALS.""**

A detailed diagram catches their eye: a pie chart, each slice labeled with names and flavors‚Äîeach representing a different model of the afterlife. Some slices have titles like **""Heavenly Cherry,"" ""Purgatory Pumpkin,""** and **""Hades Blueberry.""**

**SAM**  
*(leaning back, studying the diagram)*  
I still can‚Äôt believe it‚Äîowning your own afterlife.

**ALEX**  
*(tracing a finger along a slice labeled ""Eternal Apple Crumble"")*  
Each slice is a manifestation‚Äîa way of living eternity. Some promise sweetness and comfort, while others‚Ä¶ leave a bitter taste. The proposals lay out every detail: the ingredients, the cost in cosmic currency, even the fine print on how you can re-slice things if you don‚Äôt like your serving.

**SAM**  
And if we don‚Äôt choose wisely, we might end up with a stale piece‚Äîor worse, someone else grabs the good portion, leaving us with just the scraps.

Alex flips through the folder, pausing at a page that outlines testimonials from previous applicants. Names like **""Archibald Finch""** and **""Eleanor Webb""** are scribbled in next to vague descriptions like **""Approved‚ÄîStatus Unknown""** and **""Collapsed System.""** A blank space remains at the bottom, waiting for the next name in the reverie.

**ALEX**  
*(quietly, with conviction)*  
Look at this. Every choice, every missed opportunity‚Äîthey all led to this moment. Our name isn‚Äôt even on this list. We could be the next slice to be baked into the system. It‚Äôs our chance to call the shots and pick the proverbial flavor that suits us.

**SAM**  
*(sipping his coffee, frowning thoughtfully)*  
So, are we aiming for something sweet and comforting, or do we dare to bite into a slice with a bit of a tang‚Äîsomething that might challenge us? How do we know what if this future suits our tastes?

Alex sets the folder down, leaning forward as if sharing a secret.

**ALEX**  
The proposals come with flavor profiles‚Äîdata, memories, even warnings from those who tried it before. They say the ""Heavenly Cherry"" slice offers eternal bliss but comes with a hidden tartness if you overindulge. The ""Purgatory Pumpkin"" is unpredictable‚Äîwarm and inviting one minute, cold and unyielding the next.

**SAM**  
*(rubbing his chin)*  
And if we don‚Äôt act, someone else might claim the slice meant for us. We either risk getting our own portion or be left hungry for what might have been.

Alex‚Äôs eyes drift to the folder‚Äôs glowing signature line‚Äîa space that seems to pulse with possibility.

**ALEX**  
A bit on the nose. We can‚Äôt just let the cosmic kitchen decide for us. It‚Äôs time to set the table and order our future. We choose our slice‚Äîour own version of the afterlife‚Äîand make it ours.

Sam nods slowly, the weight of the decision settling in as he glances around the busy coffee shop, as if feeling the eyes of an unseen audience.

**SAM**  
*(determined)*  
Let‚Äôs mix our ingredients, bake our own slice. Because in this afterlife, we‚Äôre not just waiting for dessert‚Äîwe‚Äôre making it.

1ip6f7k,https://asia.fes.de/news/feminist-cities.html,Policy in the Gynarchy Pt. 6: Feminist Urban Planning,"
Attached is a link to a concept on feminist urban planning. I first encountered this idea years ago, and it immediately struck me as something essential. Most European cities have an urban structure shaped by the Middle Ages, later expanded during industrialisation. Additional factors, such as destruction during World War II and subsequent reconstruction, have also influenced the way our cities look today.

Urban planning, therefore, took place at the height of patriarchal dominance. The public space was designed for men, while women were pushed into the private sphere. As a result, the needs of men dictated city planning, reinforcing their dominance in public life.

Yet the needs of men and women in urban environments are fundamentally different. Women tend to use public transport more, whereas men prefer cars. Men have a lesser need for green spaces, while women benefit significantly from access to them. The goal of feminist urban planning is to recognise these differences and dismantle the male-dominated public sphere. Some key elements of this approach include:
	‚Ä¢	Less car traffic, more public transport
	‚Ä¢	Shorter distances to work, shops, medical practices, and government offices
	‚Ä¢	More public facilities and women‚Äôs safe spaces
	‚Ä¢	Public access to female hygiene products (e.g., menstrual products)

Despite its clear benefits, feminist urban planning is often ridiculed in political discourse. Critics argue that it attempts to solve a non-existent problem. This reaction is predictable‚Äîpatriarchy is not only deeply embedded in people‚Äôs minds but is quite literally cemented into the bricks that form our cities.

For us as female supremacists, it is obvious that public space must be adapted to the needs of women. However, I want to highlight this topic as an example of how the philosophy of female supremacy must extend into every niche of life. Gynarchy is not just about a man bringing his female partner coffee in bed; it is also about rethinking urban planning through a gynarchic lens.

The subject may seem technical and complex, but it is an area of policy that we must absolutely address. What other aspects do you think feminist/gynarchic urban planning should consider?",3,1739523241.0,SeriousGynarchy,0,0.8,False

Feeling devastated,"Not trying to scare anyone but I unfortunately in the low percentage of people didn‚Äôt have good experience with abortion. Long post but detail for whoever going thru the same. 

I found out when I was 5 weeks. I was in long distance relationship. I‚Äôm in love head over heal with the baby father although he was not the best partner to me. I found out when we were in a break and he refused to come back to me regardless the child. We‚Äôre both young and let‚Äôs say he doesn‚Äôt have that much emotional intelligence compare to the person so emotional and sensitive like me. He ran away when I decided to keep the baby. Then around 3 weeks later he reached out to be involved but eventually he didn‚Äôt and couldn‚Äôt help much because we were still in distance and he recently lost his job. I lost my job and income and no family in the country and has no support from anyone even him or his family. The only thing I could ever ask from him is giving me the emotional support that I real need at the time so I can figure out myself but he couldn‚Äôt do that do. So overall I was extremely being mistreated entire pregnancy from him and my own family, I could consider it as mentally abuse at this time. But still, I decided to keep my baby although the world turn its back on me. 

The neglects from the baby father louder and louder everyday broke my strength and finally I listened to my family schedule an abortion appointment when I was 18 weeks, 2 days procedure. I finished the first day with some laminaria in me, cramps but bearable but on the second day I was breaking down and finally asked them to removed the laminaria and keep the baby despite the risk. I told my family that I had the abortion so they can stop attacking me and decided to withdraw myself totally out of them. I cried a lot for the guilt that I lied to my family and had to force myself out of their life for my own choice. 

The next day I flew out to the baby father place for a week to see him before I got back and stay apart until the baby birth. Told him we almost lost our baby and had his comfort. I was happy thinking finally he changed and will be the support system for me for our baby. But shortly after, he showed me that he was still the same person that loves himself more than anything, he neglected my emotions and my pain although I was pregnant with our child, I cried at night he didn‚Äôt care to call me selfish and dramatic that I‚Äôm being here burden his life. When I literally on this all alone from the beginning and all he did was just promise and break me down time to time. Then one day, I found out he tried to sleep with someone when going out the club while he insisted out of my life and disclaimed my child, and he kissed someone he knows while trying to get back with me at the same time. This hurts me until today date because I remember what‚Äôs exactly I was doing when he tried to do all that for himself. I was pregnant alone, dumped by him, lost my job, have to move out, disclaimed by my parents, immigrant paperwork fuck up, ‚Ä¶ and he told me he did that just because he was under stress and feeling lonely. Then what about me? 

That was not the only thing I endured to make me having abortion this time but it was definitely a last straw. I scheduled and went on with it with more sure this time. Only difference this time is on the 1st date, after the laminaria they will inject the medication to stop the baby heart, when knowing this I was a bit relieve because it will ease my baby. The nightmare start right after they inject it, I feel the burn pain all over my uterus and I couldn‚Äôt do anything but crying and screaming. I screamed for help, the doctor and all the nurse there just look at me and confused, one of the nurse had the nerve to tell me that I need to stop acting up and scare other patient. They also said in the first patient that has this situation. They gave me some Tylenol and Advil but nothing changed although any position I tried to moved I still feel the same way, the clinic is closing and they said you need to change and go now because we are closing when I ask them can I rest a bit more. I was screaming in pain in changing room and finally I couldn‚Äôt take anything more I asked them to call me an ambulance and they refused because then they have to stay to wait for the ambulance to pick me up too and the clinic is closed, all they care is going home. I overheard one nurse even I was in pain and crying said ‚Äúcall het a taxi then it‚Äôs all her problem now‚Äù. 

The taxi driver came and be aware of the situation, he came to the clinic door and walk me to the car, he was so nice. He tried to be as fast as he could although in the rush hour, he keep updating me the remaining time to the emergency department too. When I arriving at the ER i was still in a lot of pain and scream hoping they could admit me right away, but unfortunately enough I was going thru about 45 minutes of registering and waiting, I was almost passed out in the waiting area because so much pain and my body is breaking down too then they finally admitted me. From that moment everything starts getting better, the doctor gave me bunch of pain medicine like morphine and more, he checked he said everything was fine I just had a very low pain tolerance and unfortunately this is rare for someone to feel this much pain and he said he will make sure to give me strong pain medication to make me feel better. At that time, I smirk at my own life, what is going on in my life now, I thought the decision was the hardest decision but not, look at my life :) no friend no family fucked up partner no job no money no insurance and in hospital all alone, when they asked about emergency contact I said I has no one now last bit of my life, the hope, my love is my baby is leaving me too. I broke down totally. 

Next day, today, the procedure day. I came back to the place I least wanted to. Because my cervix didn‚Äôt open enough they gave me some pills under my tongue and put me in the room to rest. Every hours there‚Äôs nurse check if I need to go to the bathroom I was just so tired and want to stay in the bed. The pills made my body so chilled. Finally after 2 hours the doctor said I‚Äôm ready and did procedure. Actually the procedure is the easiest part of the whole abortion not gonna lie, there was no pain at all, you can feel theres movement in your uterus but no pain at all and the nurse still tell and prepare you with any moves. After that, they put me in the rest room to relax, changed and discharged me. I walked out of the clinic, went to grab some coffee and groceries to make myself a sandwich.

**‚Ä¢ Encourage Transparency:** Start by leading with openness. Share the company's vision, goals, and your own experiences, and encourage team members to share their thoughts and insights. This helps build trust and ensures everyone is aligned.  
**‚Ä¢ Hold Regular Meetings:** Despite different time zones, regular virtual meetings are crucial. Weekly check-ins or ""virtual coffee"" sessions can help the team connect, discuss progress, and address any concerns in a relaxed, open environment.  
**‚Ä¢ Organize Your Work:** Implement structured project management practices. Use tools to organize data, set clear deadlines, and define communication channels for different situations, like emails for non-urgent matters and chat rooms for immediate needs.  
**‚Ä¢ Use a Time Tracking Tool:** Introduce time tracking software to monitor productivity and manage tasks efficiently. It helps team members stay focused, ensures fair compensation, and provides insights into how time is spent across projects.  
**‚Ä¢ Aim to Create a Strong Company Culture:** Build a cohesive team by fostering a shared company culture. Encourage mutual respect, acknowledge each other's skills, and work together towards common goals. This not only enhances productivity but also boosts team morale and loyalty.  
  
By following these steps, you can effectively manage a remote team and create a productive, engaged work environment.

In November, I got a call from a guest wanting to make a Valentine's Day reservation. I knew immediately that they would be an issue. I was hoping I would be off the days that they would be here... but here we are. They have called numerous times requesting all sorts of upgrades and comps. They wanted a free upgrade to our nicest suite. They wanted the Valentine's Day package for free. They wanted a free voucher for our restaurant and bar (the Valentine's Day package includes a voucher, but it wouldn't cover a full meal. Probably 50% of a meal for two if they don't order drinks.) They wanted to know what kind of mattresses we have, and if they don't like it could it be replaced with a different one. They want coffee from our cafe delivered to their room at 7 am sharp for free. (We have complimentary coffee and Keurig in the rooms, but they want our paid cafe's coffee for free. So, free room service.) 

Overall, very demanding, but not overtly rude. They constantly say things like, ""We stay here *all* the time and this is *always* done for us."" Yeah, right. We have 4 past reservations under their name with numerous notes in each reservation about how demanding they are and not to oblige them. (From previous management) Their last stay with us was in **2019**! But ""they are *very* frequent guests."" The thing is, they always call in the middle of the night, even after stating multiple times that they will need to speak to management during the DAY. I always state that I can make their reservation or pass their requests on, but for comp services they will need to speak to upper management. (So far... most of their demands have been met by management. \~eye roll\~) 

So.... tonight... I'm chilling. Working on my usual night audit duties when I get a call from them. They are on their way and want to check into their room at 3 am. Their check-in date is 02/14/25 at 3 pm. Nuh-uh. ""We spoke to someone and they said this would be okay."" They could not tell me who they spoke to. They frequently drop the manager's name, so I'm sure they would have brought it up then if they had talked to management. No notes in their reservation about wanting to check in early. ""We always check in early because we have to drive."" The drive is 3 hours.... Maybe don't start your trip until noon the next day? Why do you need to be here at 3 am? But no. I know what they're trying to pull. A free night. Anyway, the room and all of the equivalent room types are booked for the night. Hallelujah. I tell them this information and guess what? They want a free upgrade. A free upgrade from our nicest room? To what? Our *Rooftop Suite?* I tell them I can get them into our superior king room for the night. They don't want to pay for a full night, but they're okay with paying for a ""half-night."" It doesn't make sense to them to pay for a full night because they weren't there all day. They said, ""It's just an early check-in."" I said, ""A 12-hour early check-in."" Again, I tell them I cannot comp rooms and they will need to speak to management. Then they try the sweet talking. ""We just love your hotel. We don't stay anywhere else. The service is always fantastic."" Thank you. Please leave a review. But you're still gonna have to pay for tonight while I'm here. 

We'll see what happens when they call management tomorrow, but that is not my problem. (I'm taking bets on if they get tonight's room for free. My money is on yes. But that's a topic for a different day.) Anyway. I'm sitting here waiting for them to arrive, and we will see what kind of shenanigans they try to pull at the desk. I work the next two nights while they're here as well, so I'm in for a long couple of days.",23,1739522164.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,16,0.93,False

1ip65yo,https://i.redd.it/stbcr9p1g2je1.jpeg,32 day update as an insulin dependant diabetic (self funding),"Hi folks, 

Thought I would update after my first month. 

I was scared to start but went for it. 

I have a type of diabetes which is genetic (for some reason I seem to be banned from adding the name to this post) which I treat with slow acting levirmir and fast acting Novorapid. 

I was able to obtain the pens via the Family Chemist with a note from my GP advising I am hypo aware and know how to treat them (LOL been diabetic since I was 14 now 35...).

I'm ashamed to say during covid I went from 11 stone to 17 stone. I'm female and 5ft7 and have not been able to shift the weight since.

The first 2 weeks on 2.5mg I lost 1 stone. A lot of swelling in my body went away as did random aches and pains I was having. 

I dropped to 15 stone 12 and was stuck at this for days and then went back up to 16 stone. Reflecting back I was drinking 4 litres of water a day but had a few days where I stopped and this is when my weight increased and/or didn't move.

My food supression on 2.5 was good but I decided to move up to 5mg. 

On 5mg now for 2 days and my blood sugar has been excellent and I have hardly had to take any insulin which blows my mind. But I have felt sick, I have had awful wind and burps and...oh the joys, got hit with üí©üí© at 4am this morning...I'm hoping it passes. 

I have been walking an hour a day and around a 10 mile hike on a weekend. 

I have picked up my water drinking again (4L a day) and as of this morning weigh 15 stone 11. A loss of 1 stone and 3lbs in 4 weeks. 

My goal weight is 11 stone. 

I have foubd the Nutacheck app really good. I paid for it ¬£27 for the year. The catalouge of foods it has and the barcode scanning function are really good. It even has a section for eating out at restaurants, the cinema and coffee shops which I think is good if you are planning for the week.

Hope this helps anyone thinking of starting.

Playing the mini games in courtyard gives ample cod rewards. I earn cod fast doing this.

-Fishing only at friends fish ponds for better catch results. Stock up on bait until you have a bulkier amount then fish all at once. But as soon as a pond grows scarce of fish, move on to the next friends courtyard for a pond refresh.

-Use seasonal flowers to attract city customers & spam promo. Maxing out all your courtyard stats helps with this!",3,1739521912.0,AnimalRestaurant,1,1.0,False

**Furniture Polishing Services in NYC: Restore and Protect Your Wooden Furniture**

# Introduction

Wooden furniture adds elegance and warmth to any home or office, but over time, it can lose its shine due to dust, scratches, and exposure to moisture. That‚Äôs where¬†professional¬†[**furniture polishing services in NYC**](https://amatofurniture.com/furniture-repair/)¬†come in.

# Definition and Purpose

Furniture polishing involves applying a protective and enhancing layer to wooden surfaces, restoring their shine and protecting them from damage. It improves the overall appearance of furniture while adding a protective barrier against dust, spills, and minor scratches.

# Difference Between Polishing, Refinishing, and Restoration

* **Polishing**: Enhances the existing finish, restoring shine and protecting the surface.

# Common Types of Furniture That Benefit from Polishing

* Dining tables and chairs
* Coffee tables
* Wooden cabinets and bookshelves
* Antique and vintage furniture
* Office desks and conference tables

# Why Professional Furniture Polishing is Essential

# Restoring Shine and Luster

Over time, furniture can look dull due to daily wear. Professional polishing revives the wood‚Äôs natural beauty.

# Protecting Furniture from Damage

Polishing acts as a shield against moisture, dust, and small scratches, helping preserve the wood‚Äôs integrity.

# Increasing Longevity

Regular polishing prevents the buildup of grime and deterioration, ensuring your furniture lasts for generations.

# Signs Your Furniture Needs Polishing

# Faded or Dull Finish

If your wooden furniture looks lifeless, polishing can restore its original richness.

Can someone please explain what the whole deal is with does bars, is it really dangerous or just a normal bar. I read all kinds of stuff and I just want to know if I should avoid that place or I can go back with the same experience I had. Or that the second time will be a lot different.

If you can help me, I will be great full thank you

Well, after a few days, after I did (since I was indeed, quite busy with work), he leaves me on delivered and it‚Äôs been 12+ hours. I can see his activity status and he‚Äôs been active on and off online, and we‚Äôve talked before on there (with him sometimes responding immediately) so it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs inactive. If he really wanted to, he would, and I was thinking of just deleting the message and never bringing it up again. If he doesn‚Äôt seem to be super interested, then why would I waste my time and get my hopes up?",3,1739521045.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

Because I really struggle with my teeth discoloration (I drink like 6 cups of coffee a day) So I've tried a lot of different brands, some were cheap but did nothing, and others worked well but were way too pricey.

I did a bit of research and found the following kits:

* Auraglow 
* SNOW Diamond 
* BURST ¬†
* Purely White Deluxe 
* MySmile Deluxe 
* Venus Visage 
* GLOWFINITY

Has anybody here tried any of those? I‚Äôd love to hear your experience or any tips! TIA",10,1739520734.0,hygiene,8,1.0,False
