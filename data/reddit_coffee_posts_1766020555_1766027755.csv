I'm attempting to make a move and a lifestyle change and D.C. has been recommended to me many times, I grew up in New England so familiar with the East Coast, but I've also lived in Denver, California, and Seattle bkl:

1) is there a thriving Queer PoC community - Not just in the sense that there's a lot of queer folk who live here but how friendly and kind people are to each other, what kind of third spaces they have where you can show up every week and see the same faces. How is it for a queer black man to live?

1.5) Temperment - on a side note I heard D.C. Can be souless at times. I hear that people are kinda up their own ass about who somebody works for, what politicians they know, etc. is this kind of behavior very prevalent?

2) How much is going on? Do all 4 seasons bring events, opportunity and activities.

3) cannabis and coffee scene. I work in both industries and want to know how the job market here is in general but particularly in these fields.

4) fitness- is it a fitness city?

Wife and I will be in Milan for 3 days soon and curious if there are any coffee/spro experiences (outside of your normal cafe which is always a joy here) that would be worth a visit? We are big fans of the traditional Italian roast and big milk drinkers as well, and like you all I’m a geek for spro equipment as well. 

I would have liked to take the La Marzocco factory tour outside of Florence but we didn’t have the time unfortunately.

Ideas would be cafes doing something interesting or different, shops that we can explore and have a friendly chat about Italian machines, spro museums, etc. etc.! Anything noteworthy, really. ",1,1766027488.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1ppgagv,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1ppgagv/old_lady_tannenbaum/,Old Lady Tannenbaum,"“Wow! That one’s huge!” I pointed excitedly across the street at the gigantic tree in our neighbor's backyard. It was even taller than their two-story house. “Let's get one like that!”

“If you plan to chop it down and drag it home yourself, then go for it,” Dad grunted, eyes never leaving the road, one gloved hand resting on the wheel. “I’m more than happy with this one from the tree lot.” 

“Yeah…” I looked over my shoulder at our new Christmas tree, secure in the bed of the pickup. “It’s not as cool, though.”

“Bigger isn’t always better,” Dad replied, parking the truck in our driveway. “Now, help me get ours into the house.”

“Do you think they’d let us help decorate their tree? If I ask nicely?” I asked him as I grabbed hold of the trunk.

“We have our own tree, don’t pester the neighbors.”

My sister hadn’t taken her eyes off the giant tree since I’d pointed it out. Even when she hopped out of the truck, she kept staring across the street, clutching her stuffed panda in a death grip.

“What do you think?” I called to her over my shoulder. “It’d be cool to have a big tree like that, right?”

She scurried over to us, craning her neck towards the neighbor's yard. “I don’t like it,” she announced. “It’s breathing!”

I rolled my eyes. “That’s just the wind, stupid.”

“It is too breathing! And it has a face!”

“Liar. Santa doesn’t give presents to liars-”

“I’m not lying!”

“Kids,” Dad growled. “Enough. Holly, hold the door open while Jack and I carry the tree.”

\*\*\*

“It's gone.” 

“What’s gone?” I asked sleepily, toasty warm under a blanket at the end of the couch, my eyes glued to *Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer*. Holly sat on the other end, nose pressed to the window to stare across the street, breath fogging the glass.

“The big tree,” Holly whispered. “I looked away, and it’s gone.”

“Yeah? Well, maybe it got up and walked away.” I muttered, annoyed. I reached for the remote to turn up the volume.

Holly shivered and sat down abruptly, slumping, so her head wasn’t visible from the window. She pulled my blanket over her, crushing her panda stuffy in her arms. “When’s dad coming home?”

“How should I know?” I shrugged. Our Christmas tree leaned against the wall, still wrapped and bare. Dad had been called into work before we’d had a chance to even get the decorations out of the attic. “Soon, I guess.”

“Jack…?”

“What?”

“They went on vacation.”

I scrunched up my face. “Who?” 

“The people across the street. They left last week, remember?”

“So?”

“So, when did they get a tree?”

“Oh- shut up and watch the movie with me-” I was cut off by a sound like a gunshot, and we were abruptly plunged into darkness. 

“Jack!” Holly shrieked.

“It’s… It’s just the power.” I tried to sound tough, but my heart was pounding in my throat. I pulled back the curtain to peer outside into the pitch darkness. “Looks like it went out through our whole neighborhood.”

“I’m scared,” Holly whined, pulling the blanket over her head. 

Outside, there was the sound of glass breaking. We both froze in place, holding our breath. More breaking glass, and then a muffled scream that stopped mid-cry.

“What’s happening?” Holly asked in a tiny whisper.

“I think it’s a robber.” I hissed, excited. The other kids at school would be so jealous when I told them- they’d only seen robbers on TV! 

“Do we call Dad?”

“No, we should call the police.” I could barely contain my glee. “I’ll get my phone!”

“Don’t leave me-” Holly grabbed my sleeve, “I’m coming too!”

There was the sound of heavy stomping towards the house, snow crunching under massive feet. The ground shook like a small earthquake. Something scraped against the siding, and the silhouette of branches darkened the window, enveloping us in long, jagged shadows.

“Jack!” Holly squeaked. “It’s the tree!”

“Don’t be stu-” I hadn’t even got the words out when the window shattered, sending shards of glass flying. A huge clawed arm, bristling with evergreen needles, swung into the living room, knocking the couch over as Holly leapt out of the way, screaming bloody murder. 

A gnarled, crone-like face- wood-carved and scaly with bark- followed after the arm, baring jagged, wooden teeth. It grabbed both sides of the window frame with twisted wooden fingers, breaking them apart to create a wider opening. 

Sharp needles scratched my face as it reached inside, dragging our Christmas tree to them. I vaulted over the coffee table and grabbed my sister, dragging her by the hand towards the back of the house.

“I told you so!” Holly bleated.

“I’m sorry!” I screamed back, running blindly towards the back door. I was greeted by icy cold winds against my face as I threw myself into the night, my bare feet stinging as I kicked flurries of powdery snow.

We collapsed on our knees in the flowerbed, wheezing for breath and shaking.

Except for the occasional grunt or scrape of bark, the monster had gone quiet.

I peeked around the side of our house to look.

The creature cradled our Christmas tree as if it were a baby, crooning mournfully in a creaky, splintering voice. It occurred to me that if it were to sit on the ground, hugging its knees to its chest, it would look just like a giant fir.

“It doesn’t see us.” I squeezed Holly’s hand. “Let's go.”

“Go where?” Her voice was so tiny I could barely hear it.

“Mrs. Nicholas’s house,” I explained, pulling her along after me. “Dad said to call her if anything happens when he’s not here.”

“I left my panda…”

“He’ll be fine, pandas eat trees, I think… Now come on!”

We scurried from cover to cover like frightened mice, never taking our eyes off the monster. Every footstep or breath sounding too loud in our ears, feet red raw from the cold.

It was when we were only one house away from Mrs. Nicholas’s that I stumbled over something hidden in the snow, knocking both me and Holly onto our stomachs. I sat up in a panic, looking for what tripped me.

Without light, the snow was stained black with dark blood. The body of one of our neighbors lay strewn about in pieces, dismembered. The crushed head that I’d tripped over stared up at me with a twisted, broken mouth gaping in a silent scream.

Without thinking, I shrieked and kicked the head away. It rolled over the curb and bounced onto the slushy street with a wet thud.

The monster's neck splintered as it whipped to face us. With the sound of snapping branches, it lumbered in our direction, sharp, root-like fingers extended. The ground beneath its feet boomed.

“RUN!” Holly shrieked, yanking my sleeve.

It towered above us in an instant, trunk-shaped foot raised to squash us like bugs.

We scrambled behind a nearby woodshed- just as the foot came crashing down, smushing the remains of my neighbor into a bloody jelly.

The creature let out a bellow like the howl of wind.

“It’ll be okay,” I reassured a quietly sobbing Holly, even as I shook from cold and fear. “I don’t think it saw-”

We both screamed and covered our heads as wood cracked and logs scattered in all directions, a large, wooden arm sweeping it all to the side like a wrecking ball. The root-like fingers wrapped around Holly and squeezed, starting to lift her into the air.

“NO! LET HER GO!” Without a second thought, I grabbed the axe that had been abandoned on the cutting block, swinging it wildly. It was rusted and too heavy for me to lift properly, but I didn’t care. I hacked at the monster's arm, screaming obscenities I wouldn’t have dared use before. The monster bellowed, raising its free fist to smash me. Holly was wriggling, the breath being crushed from her lungs.

“OH NO YOU DON’T!” Shouted a voice behind me. A lantern spun through the air, shattering against the monster's shoulder. It screamed as it burst into flames, lighting up like a bonfire. Holly fell to the ground, winded and gulping air.

The monster thrashed and flailed its burning arms, stumbling towards the woods, the scent of a campfire following after.

“Come, dears.” Mrs. Nicholas grabbed us by the hands and pulled us to her car. “Old Lady Tannenbaum won’t hurt you anymore. I saw to that!”

“What was that thing?” I panted.

“A treefolk avenging her fallen children! I lost my husband to her years ago. I knew it was only a matter of time till she showed up again. Looks like she woke up just in time for the holidays!”

Behind us, the woods began to blaze, tortured bellows echoing across the night sky.

The past is calling, but your future is shouting. You may feel a sudden urge to break a repetitive cycle or a ""type"" that no longer serves you. A connection from a distance—perhaps a traveler or someone from a different background—sparks an unexpected flame.

* **Intrigue:** An old secret may surface that actually sets you free.

# Taurus (April 20 – May 20)

Intimacy isn’t just about physical closeness today; it’s about financial and emotional transparency. You and a partner might finally tackle a ""taboo"" topic. For singles, a casual conversation about values could reveal a soulmate-level alignment.

* **Intrigue:** A small, silent gesture will reveal more than a thousand words.

# Gemini (May 21 – June 20)

With four planets opposite your sign, the focus is entirely on ""The Other."" You might find yourself compromising more than usual, but the payoff is a deeper sense of belonging. Don't chase excitement today; chase the person who feels like home.

* **Intrigue:** You’ll see a side of your partner (or crush) you’ve never noticed before.

# Cancer (June 21 – July 22)

Jupiter retrograde in your sign makes you hyper-aware of your own needs. You are teaching others how to love you by setting firm boundaries. A workplace flirtation could take a serious turn, or a shared goal with a partner brings you closer.

* **Intrigue:** Kindness offered with no expectations will return to you by sunset.

# Leo (July 23 – August 22)

Passion is your primary language today. Venus and Mars are supercharging your zone of romance and fun. If you’re single, the ""mistletoe energy"" is real—expect a magnetic encounter. If coupled, it’s time to bring the playfulness back.

* **Intrigue:** A ""karmic"" connection may cross your path in a crowded place.

# Virgo (August 23 – September 22)

You’re done playing the hero. Today, the most romantic thing you can do is admit you’re tired and let someone else take care of you. Honesty about your inner world replaces the need for perfection.

* **Intrigue:** A revelation during a quiet moment at home changes your perspective on ""forever.""

# Libra (September 23 – October 22)

Stop chasing and start attracting. The stars suggest that the more you focus on your own intellectual growth today, the more magnetic you become to others. A deep conversation over coffee could turn into a definitive romantic turning point.

* **Intrigue:** A message from someone you haven't spoken to in months carries a hidden meaning.

# Scorpio (October 23 – November 21)

Intensity is your middle name, but today requires a soft touch. The Moon in your sign enhances your intuition, allowing you to ""read"" your partner’s heart. Avoid power struggles; choose vulnerability instead.

* **Intrigue:** What you think is a loss in love is actually space being cleared for something better.

# Sagittarius (November 22 – December 21)

You are the celestial favorite today with Venus in your sign. You feel a surge of optimism and ""new beginning"" energy. It’s a day for bold declarations and spontaneous dates.

* **Intrigue:** A sudden ""aha!"" moment tells you exactly who is worth your time.

# Capricorn (December 22 – January 19)

Mars has just entered your sign, giving you the courage to pursue what (and who) you truly desire. You’re moving away from ""hoping for the best"" and toward ""making it happen."" Commitment feels less like a weight and more like an achievement.

* **Intrigue:** A private confession will solidify a bond that has been ""unofficial"" for too long.

# Aquarius (January 20 – February 18)

Friendship and love are blurring into one. You might realize a ""just friend"" has been carrying a torch for you, or your partner feels more like your best friend than ever. Look for love in your community or social circles.

* **Intrigue:** A shared dream or ""crazy idea"" is the spark that ignites a new fire.

# Pisces (February 19 – March 20)

Your public life and your private heart are colliding. You might meet someone through a professional event, or a partner shows immense pride in your accomplishments. Trust the ""slow burn"" over the ""flash in the pan.""

* **Intrigue:** Silence will guide you better than a long-winded explanation today.

1ppg7zo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1ppg7zo/aio_for_wanting_to_break_up_over_money_issues/,AIO for wanting to break up over money issues?,"So me and my partner have been together for about 2 years now and things have been pretty good overall but lately I've been seriously considering ending it because of how they handle money. They're constantly broke even though they make decent money at their job, like they'll blow their entire paycheck on random stuff they don't need and then ask me to cover rent or groceries.



  
Last month they bought a $400 gaming chair when they couldn't even pay their half of utilities and I had to cover it again. I've tried talking to them about budgeting and being more responsible but they just get defensive and say I'm being controlling. Then they spend over $2k on a pound of weed or whatever the right amt is. It was a lot of weed. Like cmon..



  
It's not even about the money itself, it's more about the fact that they seem to have zero impulse control and no consideration for how their spending affects our future together. Like we've talked about moving in together properly and maybe getting engaged someday but how can I plan a life with someone who can't even manage their own finances.



  
I feel like I'm dating a teenager sometimes and it's exhausting having to be the responsible one all the time. My friends think I'm being too harsh and that money problems can be worked out but honestly I'm starting to think this is just who they are as a person. The worst part is they act like it's no big deal when I have to bail them out but then they'll spend money on expensive coffee or takeout the next day. I love them but I can't keep doing this and I don't think they're ever going to change",63,1766027265.0,AmIOverreacting,3,0.98,False
1ppg7m9,https://www.reddit.com/r/SFWr4rIndia/comments/1ppg7m9/19f4r_indiaanywhere_looking_for_genuine/,19[F4R] India/Anywhere- Looking for genuine friendships (or maybe something deeper),"



Hey! I’m posting this in the middle of my end-sems (they get over in a day, thank god), so if nothing else, this should tell you I’m both lonely and an absolute nerd. I’ve been buried in notes, case laws, and coffee for days now, and even though college is exciting, it’s also been a bit overwhelming not having people I really connect with yet.

I’d love to meet people who are kind, thoughtful, and open to real conversations the kind where we actually get to know each other, not just exchange dry “hey/hi”s. And who knows, if we connect well, maybe something deeper could grow from it… but no pressure. I’m big on letting things unfold naturally.

A little about me: I’m a law student, so yes, most of my life right now is reading, researching, writing, and pretending I understand everything on the first read (I don’t). Outside academics, I’m obsessed with literature romance, thrillers, anything that makes me feel something or makes my brain spin a little. I love history, psychology, feminism, philosophy, and just understanding why people are the way they are. I love learning through conversations as much as I do through books.

Personality-wise, I’m an ambivert quiet at first, but once I’m comfortable, I get warm, chatty, and very “I remember the tiny details you told me three days ago.” I’m a feminist but also a hopeless romantic. I love independence, but I also love soft, intentional care. Little things matter to me a lot.

I’ve never dated before, mostly because I want something real. I’m not into casual anything. I want friendship first something steady, warm, intentional, and actually meaningful. I’m a “date to marry” person, but I also don’t rush into things. I like slow, genuine connection.

And just to be clear: I don’t reply to one-word intros. If you message me, tell me something about yourself maybe what you’re reading, what your week has been like, what’s been on your mind lately, something real. I want to know you, not just “hey.”

If you’ve read this far, I’d genuinely love to hear from you just maybe forgive me if I reply with a slight delay. End-sems have me hostage right now.

So I built this little web app called Savings Spinner. It's a prize wheel you spin for positive motivational messages, but every spin adds ""time saved"" (assuming your usual gambling rate per hour) and shows how much money you're NOT losing.  
  
Features:

So

* Smooth spinning wheel with fun outcomes like ""Wealth Builder!"" or ""Inner Peace Gained!""
* Tracks time + money saved

1ppg36x,https://i.redd.it/zey4gz9qiv7g1.jpeg,"A trial photo of Bernard Schreiber, 18, sentenced to death in 1955 for raping and murdering a 17-year-old girl to ""prove his manhood"". Schreiber, then 17 himself, stalked her for 3 days, then attacked her after she spurned his advances. He would be the last juvenile offender to be executed in Ohio.","[Capital Punishment of Children in Ohio: ""They'd Never Send a Boy of Seventeen to the Chair in Ohio, Would They?""](https://ideaexchange.uakron.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1823&context=akronlawreview)

Bernard Schreiber was born in Monclova in 1937. He had never been in trouble before and was friends with several younger boys. They frequently messed with him since he had only had one date with a girl and was a virgin. So, Schreiber decided to change that. In August 1954, Schreiber and a 12-year-old companion were in Sylvania Township when a 17-year-old school girl whom they did not know, Mary Jolene Freiss, rode past on a bicycle going for the mail. Schreiber immediately took a liking to her. The two boys proceeded to follow the girl for three days, watching her make trips to a mail box. On the third day, Schreiber approached Friess. The girl immediately spurned his advances.

The next day, the two boys hid in some weeds alongside the path taken by Friess. When the girl rode pass, the two ambushed her. The younger boy knocked her off her bicycle by a hit to the head with a club. Friess dizzily fled into the woods, but was struck twice more and knocked unconscious. The younger boy then left the scene. Schreiber then dragged Mary deeper into the woods, tore up her clothes, and raped her. When Mary regained consciousness, Schreiber became worried that she would identify him. He stabbed the girl twice in the chest, killing her. He then went home and ate lunch.

[The girl, Mary Jolene Friess](https://imgur.com/a/photo-of-mary-jolene-friess-Nplrf9O)

[Bernard Schreiber's arrest and confession](https://imgur.com/a/a7ePGVN)

About a week later, the police received a tip from a neighbor, who reported that Schreiber had confessed to his mother, saying, ""I just killed a girl. I stabbed her twice."" Schreiber's mother said she was horrified by her son's confession, but wasn't sure what to do. After initially denying his guilt, Schreiber confessed after failing a lie detector test. Before making his statement, Schreiber took the police to a dump two miles from the scene. There, they found fragments of the girl's eyeglasses. After returning, Schreiber put his feet on the prosecutor's desk, puffed a pipe, and related how he and the younger boy had planned the crime. Sipping a cup of coffee, he talked about how they had stalked her for days.

>""She looked good. We decided to wait for her. I was intrigued and aroused by the way she was dressed in bra and shorts. She had a pretty nice looking shape and that's what got me.""

When confronted by the police, the younger boy cried and denied any involvement in the murder, but admitted to his initial participation.

The police asked Schreiber and the younger boy about unrelated things. Schreiber had aspired to became a Marine after his graduation. He enjoyed reading comic books, mainly about Superman and Captain Marvel, and usually stayed at home. When asked about television programs, he said he liked mysteries, ""especially those which send thrills down my spine like Dragnet."" He said he had no particular hobby, ""but liked to fool around with carpentry and mechanics."" The younger boy, described as small for his age, was called an average student and interested in sports. He'd followed his normal pursuits since the crime.

Schreiber remained at home, watching television and peering through his windows. Sheriff William Hirsch, described Schreiber, who was called ""a religious-minded youth who never missed mass,"" as ""a sort of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."" Schreiber said that he and his accomplice had driven to the scene after the body was discovered. He spent about two hours in the Sheriff's posse, ""just to see how far they were getting with their investigation.""

Schreiber was charged with first degree murder. He was certified to stand trial as an adult and went on trial in January 1955. He waived his right to a jury trial and entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. At his trial, Schreiber said his accomplice was more culpable than he had initially claimed. What really happened, he said, was that the younger boy had told him, ""Go ahead, get it over with."" The boy waited at the road. When Schreiber returned to him 10 minutes later, he asked, ""Are you finished so soon?""

The younger boy had not been charged. Since he had supposedly disassociated himself from the crime by fleeing after knocking Friess unconscious, he could not be held liable as an accomplice to murder or rape. On account for his age, officials had not prosecuted him for assault. He had been released to his mother. At his trial, Schreiber said he'd changed his story after learning that if the younger boy was implicated in the murder, he'd be sent to a reform school until his 21st birthday.

On the stand, the younger boy denied all involvement.

Four psychiatrists testified that Schreiber was sane, but intellectually disabled. They said he had the mentality of an 11-year-old. He was in 11th grade, but was rated at the seventh grade level. Nevertheless, Lucas County prosecutor Harry Friberg pushed for a death sentence. He said Schreiber's age, somewhat impoverished background, and learning difficulties did not warrant leniency given the brutality of the crime.

>""Nevermind, and I mean never, should this man be in a position to commit a similar crime again.""

He noted that Schreiber had used a hunting knife, not a pocket knife.

[Schreiber is sentenced](https://imgur.com/a/yohK9xN)

A three-judge panel deliberated for an hour before finding him guilty of first degree murder and sentencing him to death by electrocution. A plea for a second degree murder conviction or at least an attachment of mercy to a first degree murder conviction were rejected. Schreiber had admitted that he stabbed Friess a second time since he thought he'd missed her heart the first time. Upon hearing the sentence, Schreiber dropped his head and closed his eyes. His mother became hysterical and his two sisters sobbed. Schreiber later said the decision felt ""just like they had shoved a knife in me.""

On June 28, 1955, an appellate court confirmed the verdict in a 2-1 decision. On December 14, 1955, the Ohio Supreme Court rejected his appeal and scheduled his execution for January 13, 1956. On December 30, Governor Frank Lausche delayed the execution to March 15 so that Schreiber could ask for clemency. At a hearing in January, defense attorney Marcus L. Friedman told the Ohio Pardons and Parole Commission that Schreiber had been raised on the edge of poverty and never had a real break in his life. Friedman said clemency would be ""the first and last break he'll ever get.""

>""If he gets one now, he will never get another because he will be in prison the rest of his life.""

It's worth noting that this is false.

Life without parole did not become a sentencing option in Ohio until 1993. Any sentence less than death for Schreiber was virtually guaranteed to result in him being paroled in the 1970s or 1980s. That aside, Friedman noted the presence of other mitigating factors, such as Schreiber's age and learning difficulties. However, the panel was unmoved. On March 15, Schreiber lost his last hope of avoiding execution when Governor Lausche said he would not intervene. After counseling with his cabinet and reviewing the case, he announced, ""Based upon a careful study of the evidence in the case of Bernard Schreiber, I find the facts to be of a nature not warranting my intervention. The decisions respectively of the Common Pleas. Appellate and the Supreme Courts will not be disturbed.""

Schreiber, who was 17 years and 11 months old at the time of the murder, would be the last juvenile offender to be executed in Ohio. When the state reinstated the death penalty in 1981, lawmakers banned it for juveniles, solidifying his morbid historical footnote. Between 1880 and 1956, 19 juvenile offenders had been executed in Ohio, all of them for murder. All but one of them were at least 16 at the time of their crimes.

The exception was 16-year-old Gustave Ohr, who was hanged in 1880 for robbing and murdering a man when he was fifteen. Hanged him were his accomplice, 17-year-old George Mann, and 18-year-old John Sammett, who was 17 when he murdered a 16-year-old boy who'd testified against him in a burglary case. Even in 1880, some had pleaded for mercy on behalf of the three boys, who were also the first juvenile offenders to be executed in the state. Over the next 76 years, judges and juries in Ohio had become increasingly reluctant to condemn anyone that young to death.

Schreiber's near-adulthood contributed to his death sentence. At the trial, the prosecutor perceived and described Schreiber, now 18, as a young man, not a child.

Schreiber received a final visit from his family. His mother, a brother, and a sister came to say goodbye. His last meal consisted of fresh shrimp cocktail, roast prime ribs of beef, french fried potatoes, buttered whole greens, head lettuce with mayonnaise, pumpkin pie with ice cream, hot rolls and butter with strawberry preserves, coffee, milk, and Coca-Cola. A request by Schreiber to be allowed to eat his last meal with a prison buddy was granted. He ate with 26-year-old Benjamin Meyer, who had been convicted of murdering his estranged wife, 26-year-old Velvia Meyer, on February 15, 1954. Meyer had murdered his wife about two months after she initiated divorce proceedings against him. The two had gotten into a heated argument when Velvia refused to withdraw them. It ended with Meyer shooting Velvia, the mother of his five children, three times with a revolver.

At his trial, Meyer had argued that he was only guilty of second degree murder. He said the gun was meant for himself if his wife didn't drop the divorce proceedings.

>""Meyer wants you to believe he did the slaying in an unconscious state as the result of being struck on the head by a club.""

The prosecution said the crime was premeditated, noting that he had fired three shots and had previously spied on his wife. He had also initially lied to the police, saying he only shot his wife after she struck him with a club. In reality, his wife had done nothing. He was really struck by his wife's niece, 17-year-old Delores Sniff, with a hairbrush. Meyer said she had struck first, but couldn't remember much about what had happened. Delores testified that Meyer had arrived to her home uninvited and pushed his way inside. Her mother, Leila Sniff, said Meyer wasn't supposed to be there and that he should call the police, but did nothing. Meyer left the house, but was twice seen by Leila going around the back. Leila told him that her sister would be here soon and to wait at the front porch.

When his wife arrived, Meyer confronted her and pleaded with her to drop her divorce proceedings. She replied that they had tried reconciliation before and it ""wouldn't work."" When Meyer insisted, she said, ""It is out of my hands."" At this, he replied, ""I can do something about it, drew his revolver, and shot her. Delores started hitting Meyer with her hairbrush, but stopped when he turned the gun on her. Meyer did not hurt Delores, but did shoot his wife twice more before fleeing. Assistant prosecutor Phil Henderson said the idea that Meyer was struck first was a ""concocted story"". He asked the jury to feel Delores's broken hairbrush in their hands to judge whether it could've hurt Meyer. Prosecutor Fred Murray also said Meyer had a bad conduct record in the Navy and was defiant against authorities. Six months prior to the murder, he had been fined on a charge of assault and battery filed against his wife.

>""What did he think of them and his wife? The pattern is clear that Benjamin Meyer has no respect for law and order.""

Murray noted that Meyer had bought the gun on the day of the murder: ""Meyer proceeded in cold blood to take his wife's life, and shot twice more to make sure of it.""

Murray dismissed the claim that the gun was for suicide. In regard to a previous suicide attempt by Meyer a month prior to the murder, he described it as a half-hearted attempt intended to guilt-trip his wife into dropping her divorce proceedings and said that Meyer didn't have the guts to kill himself. He also said that Meyer's decision to flee and conceal the weapon indicated his awareness of what was happening.

Meyer was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death after the jury declined to recommend mercy. He was the first person sentenced to death in Hocking County in the 20th century. However, on September 20, 1955, just three days before his scheduled execution, Governor Lausche commuted his sentence to life in prison after a campaign from his parents. Lausche had repeatedly delayed the execution as Meyer's parents pleaded with him to consider their son's circumstances. Lausche gave this explanation for his decision.

>""Through difficulties and misunderstandings in the home, they had been separated on several occasions. During the last separation, he visited wanting her to come back; a further misunderstanding occurred at the end of which he took her like through a gunshot. When they were married on Nov. 23, 1945, he was 16 years and nine months of age and she was 18 years and nine months. Within the first seven years of their marriage, five children were born. At the time of the tragedy, he was 24 years of age and already the father of five children. He was skilled in no trade or craft and started laboring in a factory when he was 16 years old. The task which fell upon him and his wife was extraordinarily heavy. Misunderstandings and bickerings were inevitably to occur. He was not equipped either by age or position of a trade or economic background to assume his huge responsibilities. With the full recognition of the seriousness of the crime and the sorrow he has brought upon the relatives of his deceased wife, in my opinion, the ends of justice will be served by the State of Ohio exacting of him imprisonment for life instead of death by execution.""

Meyer was paroled some time between the late-1970s and mid-1980s.

His younger friend would not be so lucky. Bernard Schreiber, 19, was executed by electrocution at the Ohio State Penitentiary in Columbus on March 15, 1956.

As the title says, I’m new to Faridabad and moving to Sector 87 in a few weeks. I have been living in Delhi since Sep 2024 but now relocating to be closer to my office.

Need advice with following things as Google has a lot of conflicting info.

1. My apartment is on 4th floor in a 15 storey building. The landlord hasn’t opted for power backup because the cost is Rs. 36/KW. Do I need to opt for an inverter or is it possible to retrofit power backup?

Google says there are no power cuts in Sector 87 but some colleagues say there are occasional power cuts, can some local people let me know how the situation really is?

2. Following up from above question, I’ll have 3 fans, 1 AC, 1 TV, 1 Monitor, 1 Projector, 1 PS5, Lights, 1 Refrigerator and 1 water purifier. Haven’t finalized on water heater yet.

3. As for WiFi, I download games and use Stremio all the time so I’m looking into 300 MBPS connections from Jio and Airtel. Booked both but the Airtel guy called me and said Jio will offer air fiber whereas Airtel will offer wired fiber. So it is best to go with wired right?

4. I’ll be living alone and only know basic things to cook, what is the max amount someone would pay for a cook in Sector 87?

5. I’ve only looked at Agarwal in terms of packing and moving services but are there other safer options? Someone I know recommended No Broker packing and moving services. Any other suggestions are welcome please.

6. Lastly, I’m looking to buy a Sofa, Coffee table, TV cabinet, Double bed frame and mattress. Is it okay to go with Amazon for furniture purchase or are there any local shops which are better? I’m not looking to spend a lot on the furniture though.

Any advice will be of great help!

I agreed if we could get a coffee bar cabinet so we weren't losing counter space. He let me pick one out, we ordered it, and it was delivered today.
Went downstairs just now to find out he put it together! It's standing there now, built. 
I shrugged it off initially saying to him what are you doing that was my present, and he just said I wanted to have it built for you. 
Internally I am furious and disappointed and kind of heartbroken to be honest. 
We've been together 20 years and struggled to surprise each other sometimes; but why would he ever think it's okay to open my present early?
I don't know what to do with my feelings and I'm wondering if I'm overreacting, so am I?

1ppfs7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ppfs7q/is_my_coworker_interested_or_just_doesnt_want_to/,Is my coworker interested or just doesn't want to 'lose' me?,"My (29M) coworker (26F) is very recently divorced, separated for six months or so in total. Before a couple of months ago we knew each other but nothing more than a 'hey how's it going' in the hall whenever we would see each other. About two months ago she bumped into me in the hallway and I made her laugh a couple times and went about my day, and after work she followed me on Instagram. I had thought she was still married so I didn't really pay it much mind.

A few days later she started responding to my Instagram stories and liking all of them, and asked me if I could help her with a work project, which I was happy to do. The next day at work I see her with a couple of her team members and she goes ""hey lets do a coffee date this week"" and I just said ok sure. At this point, she starts regularly messaging me at work (literally every day) just saying stuff like good morning, how's it going, whatcha up to, stuff like that. One of those times she casually mentions she's in the process of getting divorced.

The next day, she asks if I'm free after work to help her with her 'project' and I said I was, but I just asked if we get food since it was almost 530. We meet up and just kind of started talking and getting to know each other more, and after 2 hours we hadn't talked about a 'project'. After dinner she asked if we could go get dessert next door, and at that point it started to feel like a real date.

After we parted ways I just straight up asked her out; and she responded 'can I think about it for a day or 2?'. I figured she was either not interested or her divorce was a factor. A few days later she told me a romantic date would be too much for where she's at but that she still wanted to do things together, in my mind I was basically friendzoned.

I tried to distance myself a bit after this, but she invited me out to lunch with some colleagues one day and was doing some really flirty stuff in front of other people. She was eating fries casually off my plate and offering me sips of her drink and stuff like that. We even got ice cream after and she fed me a bite of hers off her spoon which I thought was pretty out there.

We hung out a couple other times just doing normal stuff like hiking and things like that, and she's been really flirty at work especially. After the last time I saw her, I decided to just distance myself because I didn't want to be an emotional rebound or something like that. I avoided her at work for a week and a half and the first time I ran into her at work after that she got nervous and fumbled her words when I said hey to her.

I didn't talk to her again at work for a few more days and this week she actually called my work phone and said ""just wanted to say hey, haven't talked to you in a little while"". I thought it was kind of weird but kind of sweet, so I asked if she wanted to get some fresh air with me. We just kind of talked about normal bs and she mentioned she had been seeing my 'slutty' ig story pics. I figured maybe since I had backed off she missed me or something so I asked if she wanted to go on a hike this weekend. She said 'would love to but has plans for the next two weekends'.

I didn't reply and she texted me later asking if we could do the first week after new years and I just said ok. I don't really know what is going on honestly, I feel like she could either be interested and taking things very slow, or she is just playing games and only wants to hit me up when she misses me because I stop being funny/entertaining her at work. Any advice on how this could end for me would be really appreciated.",1,1766025947.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

I’m a 26-year-old guy looking to meet someone with the intention of a serious, genuine connection. I’m not interested in arranged marriage setups or rishta-style pressure. I want something natural where two people actually get to know each other first.
I’ve tried apps like Muzz and similar platforms, and honestly they haven’t worked out for me. I also gave the rishta subreddit a shot, but most interactions didn’t feel serious or consistent. So I figured I’d try my luck here.
I’m hoping to meet up (coffee, walk, casual hangout nothing forced) and see if there’s a real connection. I value good conversation, mutual respect, and emotional maturity. I’m not here to waste anyone’s time, and I don’t expect perfection just honesty and effort.
If this resonates with you and you’re also looking for something meaningful, feel free to DM me. Happy to exchange more details privately.

*“Inside these walls lies your salvation.”*

*- Motto carved in front of St. Asbeel Church*

Jeff was dead.

He’d been inside our shop just minutes before, and then he was a slab of dead meat in the middle of the road. Outside of Nana’s funeral, I’d never been that close to a dead body before. Never seen one splayed out in the street, crimson blood pooling under its broken and disjointed form. Even after they took his body away and scrubbed the square, you could still see the outlines of the stain.

Darcy was quick to point out that, tragic as it was, the Harvest Festival would continue. I was flabbergasted, and any attempt to dissuade her from continuing fell on deaf ears. Hell, anyone I spoke to held the line: the show must go on.

Mom was beside herself. She had been even more removed from these kinds of actions, and the death struck her hard. She left to spend the rest of the day at our house. The thought of doing anything festive made her ill. She mentioned she was considering cutting her trip short. I told her I didn’t blame her.

Jason and I didn’t have that luxury. We needed to keep our minds busy, so we dove into working on the store. My nerves were KFC-level deep-fried. I feared that every noise I heard was something looming in the shadows, looking to harm us or pester us about the church's readiness.

Yet, our options were limited to: 1) give up our future and leave, or 2) go home and wallow. Neither sounded like an improvement on the current situation, so I kept my nose to the grindstone. Idle hands are the devil’s playthings. How my ancient pilgrim forefathers must’ve cheered my industriousness from beyond the grave.

Day turned to night, and the light from the stained glass muted to all black. I flipped on a few lamps and kept restocking. Jason, brave soul that he is, moved to the basement to put some finishing touches on his pet project. Mookie was with him and sleeping, which, good on him for doing so. I didn’t know if I’d ever sleep again.

At around ten, I heard someone on the back stairs. It was Jason, and the look on his face concerned me. His flushed skin and slack jaw contrasted with his wild, wide-open eyes. He waved me over without a word.

“What’s up?” I whispered.

“I have something to show you.”

“That doesn’t sound promising.”

He led me down the squeaky stairs until we were standing inside the former priest’s bedroom. Mookie had woken from his slumber and was pacing in front of a section of cinder block wall. Jason nodded at it.

“He’s been doing this for a while. I check and…and I think there is a hidden room behind this wall,” he said, tapping on the cinder block. It did sound hollow, but what I know about construction could fit inside a teapot with room for cream.

“There wasn’t anything listed on the blueprints when we bought it,” I said.

“I know,” he said. “But Mookie won’t stop meowing. I came over and slapped the wall, and it sounded different. Hollow. Give it a wap.”

I did. It didn’t seem off until I hit another section of the wall and heard the distinction. I glanced at Jason to ask what we should do, but saw that he was already cradling his sledgehammer, Sluggo. I didn’t argue, just scooped up Mookie and took two big steps back.

Jason swung the hammer like Thor, and after several solid hits, the cinder block crumbled. A hole to the unknown had opened right in front of us. I held up my phone to get a view into the void behind the wall. I saw nothing at first.

But then we heard someone say, “Help.”

I stumbled back and nearly introduced my ass to the ground. Jason looked confused, but then he heard the voice too, this time louder, a little less hoarse, and he backed away as well. We shared a look of astonishment.

“Hello,” the weak voice called out again. “Have you come to free me after all these centuries?”

I looked over at Jason and mouthed a string of curse words. Not sure if he got most of what I was saying, but he got the gist. I had about nine million questions to ask, but my brain and mouth couldn’t come to an agreement about which to ask first. Instead, I just whispered, “ptah abuzzbaba.”

“My thoughts exactly.”

“What the hell is that?”

“A man in the wall.”

“Why is there a man in the wall? How is there a man in the wall?”

“I don’t think my brain knows how to process any of this,” Jason said.

Mookie, as curious as his kind are, instantly hopped up onto the hole and peered into the darkness. He meowed, and we heard it echo back. Before I could grab him, he jumped into the room.

“Mookie!” I moved to the hole and peered in without my phone. I couldn’t see a thing at first. Once my eyes adjusted, though, I noticed a figure slumped against the far side of a wall. They were in an ancient jail cell.

From the void, Mookie meowed again, this time more forcefully. It twisted into a growl before evolving into a snarl. He hissed a few times, and I heard him nervously skitter back toward the hole. I just moved my face out of the way just before he came leaping through and bolted up the stairs, hissing as he did.

I glanced over at Jason and swallowed hard. Just what the heck was going on in there? I went back to the cinder block portal and tried to get a better view of whatever had spooked my poor boy. I couldn’t make out much, but I heard someone jostling.

“H-hello?” I said. “Are you okay?” What a stupid thing to ask. Obviously, the person trapped in a jail cell behind a walled-up secret room isn’t okay. “Do you need help?”

“Have you come to free me from them?”

“From who?”

“The Watchers,” he hissed.

Well, that was terrifying. Way worse than raccoons. I turned back to Jason. “You need to break down this wall. I’m gonna go find help.”

“From who? This whole town closes at nine.”

“I dunno. I’m sure Darcy is out on vermin patrol. I’ll call 911, too. But this guy is going to need immediate help,” I said before turning back to the hole. “Sir, just be patient. We’re gonna go grab some help.”

“Beware the Watchers!”

“I’ll try my best,” I said before I scrambled up the stairs, following the trail Mookie Petts had blazed.

I hit the top floor and headed straight for the front door. For the first time since our move to Sky’s End and purchase of the church, I didn’t feel safe. I guess finding a man walled into a hidden room in your basement will do that to a person.

I burst out onto the street and was surprised to find several people walking around. A few of them were huddled together and pointing at the church. A second glance told me they were with the Harvest Festival committee. Their lanyards gleamed in the moonlight.

Rushing over, they ceased their conversation and looked at me with concern. They must’ve thought I was an insane person with how wild I was acting, but they kept their personal feelings behind the mask of politeness. “Thank God you’re out here! There’s someone inside my walls! I need help!”

The group of people shared a look, telepathically decided I was insane or on drugs or both, and then the lead person - Rachel, I think - looked at me with sympathetic eyes and said, “Darling, are you okay?”

“No,” I said. “We just stumbled into some weird shit, and I don’t know what to do or who to turn to.” I patted myself and realized I didn’t have my phone. “Can one of you call the cops? I probably need an ambulance, too.”

“Oh, you won’t be able to get those two boys. They’re on a fishing trip until Harvest Day. Yearly tradition - ‘Trout before Turkey’ they call it,” Rachel said.

“Usually catch the limit, too!” another one of the committee members added, as if I could give a rat’s ass about their fishing prowess.

“Lillian, we should talk,” came a voice I was familiar with from behind me - Darcy. “We should talk with Jason, too.”

“Darcy, I’m not in the right state of mind to worry about the teeny-tiny details about the festival, okay? I just found a man walled up in my bookstore!”

“I know about him. We all do.”

“Jesus Christ, news travels fast in a small town,” I said. “How did you hear already?”

“I’ve known about him. W-we all have.”

“The committee?”

“The entire town,” Darcy said. “Come, let’s go talk to Jason.”

My mouth went Sahara. Gobi, even. Death Valley on a bad day. I felt wrung out, and the lack of liquid struck me dumb. I had questions and wanted to speak, but nothing came from me. Darcy offered her hand, and I took it. The Harvest Festival committee went on planning as if I hadn’t just spun them a magical tale. I heard Rachel mention something about “putting the bonfire near the grand gazebo this year.”

Darcy led me to the store. She was speaking - I saw her mouth moving - but the blood whooshing in my ears drowned it out. Was the whole town in on this oddity? If so, why hadn’t anyone mentioned it to me when I purchased the church? Why was he there at all? How was he alive?

Who the hell was he?

“He’s a demon,” Darcy said once Jason had joined us upstairs. She said it as plainly as a person ordering their favorite coffee at Buzz’s Bean. “He’s been in there since the town’s founding. He’s the reason we founded the town way out in the middle of nowhere. It’s where they caught him.”

“Hold up,” Jason said, as gob-smacked as I’d been. “Is this a Halloween prank or something? Tease the new folks? A hazing for the newest Sky Enders?”

Darcy politely chuckled. “No, no. This is real. Obviously, it’s not something we’re going to put in the tourist brochures, but up to this point, we had no concerns about it. Our problems were walled up in the basement room where Father Gusion lived, and he wasn’t going to spill the beans.”

“You said you caught him,” I started before Darcy cut me off.

“The town founders. I wouldn’t have stood a chance! I can’t even run a mile without stopping for a breather. Chasing and imprisoning a demon? I’m out.”

“Who are they?”

Darcy sighed and leaned on her elbows closer to us. We mirrored her actions. “If I tell you this - all of it - you cannot tell anyone else. It can’t leave this town. If word of this got out into the wider world, well, let’s just say an underprepared Harvest Festival would be the least of our concerns. Do you understand what I’m saying?”

“Yes,” Jason and I said in unison.

Darcy nodded, took a beat, and started. “They’re called the Watchers, the people who tracked and found the demon Ralph.”

“Wait, wait, wait…the demon’s name was Ralph? Like Wiggum or Kramdem?” I said.

“It’s a longer name, but we all refer to him as Ralph. It’s easier than breaking out an ancient multisyllabic Aramaic word.”

“Aramaic? The language Jesus spoke?”

Darcy nodded. “This thing is old and very dangerous. It’s why they built a cell under the church and walled it off. ‘Lo, if the beast’s face sees the heavenly light of the sun, misfortune and ruin will follow.’ It’s scripture. Basically, if Ralph got loose, it’d put everyone in the town at risk.”

Just then, an orange blur came wheeling into the room and jumped up onto the desk. Mookie had returned from wherever he’d run off to. His pupils were huge, and it was clear he was still on guard. I went to pet him, but he scooted away from us.

“Mookie, what’s up?”

He hissed at me. I felt the sting. He hissed at Jason. He hissed at Darcy before darting away from us. I saw his tail disappear down the basement stairs. I wanted to go grab him, but Jason put his hand on my thigh to keep me in my seat. He leaned in close and whispered, “He’ll be okay.”

“What if ‘Ralph’ hurts him?” I said.

“He hasn’t spoken to you, has he?”

“He said to watch out for the Watchers,” I said.

She put her hand to her mouth. “So, you spoke with him?”

“Well, not much. Once you find a man in a cell hidden in your walls, the conversation is limited to ‘oh shit’ and ‘I’ll get help.’”

“Don’t talk to him. Every word out of his poisoned mouth is a lie, but sounds like the truth. That’s his demonic power - he’s trying to convince you to sympathize with him so you’ll release him. It’s so important that you don’t.”

I shook my head. “Darcy, this is a tall ask. You can’t seriously ask me to leave a man locked up in a cage inside the walls of my bookstore.”

“It’s a church,” she said. “And I do. I can call a few people over to help patch up the wall and keep watch until you guys are ready to open up. It’s easier to ignore him if there is someone else there to help keep you on the right path, so to speak.”

“I can put a piece of wood up over the hole and lock the door to the stairs for tonight,” Jason said. “We can discuss having armed guards tomorrow.”

“I’m not a fan of that plan, to be honest,” I said.

“We can talk more about it tomorrow after the shock wears off,” Darcy said, standing. “Please don’t speak to Ralph. Don’t tell anyone else about this. Loose lips sink ships. We’ll be in contact in the morning.”

She got up and left to continue her late-night patrols of a dead, small town. Jason and I sat in silence for about ten minutes. Our brains needed to reboot. Finally, when words found our tongues again, I turned to him and said, “We can’t tell my mom.”

“God, no.”

“And we need to talk to Ralph,” I said.

“Lil, that’s the one thing she said not to do.”

“I don’t trust her. Do you?”

“Well, she came across a little odd.”

“Why was she outside at night? Why are any of the Harvest People out there? How’re none of them bothered by Jeff’s death?”

From the basement, Ralph wailed. We shared a look before we dashed downstairs. Where there had only been a little porthole when I had left for help, Jason had widened the hole large enough for us to walk through. It’d be a tight fit - and a subtle reminder to get back to the gym - but I could squeeze through if the need arose.

I hoped it wouldn’t.

The room was icebox cold, way chillier than anywhere else in the church. It was dark too. Starless night dark. Bottom of the sea dark. Not sure how anyone could ever be in here and not go crazy, demon or no.

Mookie was in here. I could hear him purring but couldn’t see him. I hesitantly pulled out my phone and turned on the flashlight. I spotted him right away, lying next to a row of iron prison bars. A mysterious white hand stroked the top of his orange head.

“Mookie, come!” He didn’t. Cats, man.

“The Watchers got to you, didn’t they?”

“Someone worse - a small-town planning committee,” I said from outside the hidden room.

“Did they tell you a fantastic tale about my origin?” the mysterious voice asked.

“We learned some new information, yes. Your name is Ralph, for one.”

“It is not Ralph,” he said.

“They call you Ralph in these parts.”

“Mookie, come here,” Jason said, adding cat noises to get him moving. Mookie rolled, stood, stretched, and sauntered back toward us. He was gleefully meowing as he did.

“I wouldn’t hurt the creature,” Ralph said. “It is not in my nature.”

“He bites sometimes,” Jason said. The absurdity of warning a literal demon that my house cat may bite it was too much for my brain to take in at once. It broke me. I went for the big question.

“Are you a demon? I mean, how else would a person still be alive in here with no sunlight, no food, no water? I’m assuming those are magical prison bars or something that keeps you in place? You gotta be a demon, right?”

“If you already believe that I am a follower of the Morning Star, would you believe anything I said to refute it?”

“I mean, at this point, I’m game to hear anything.”

“Yeah, we’re kinda through the looking glass here,” Jason added, scooping up Mookie and placing him on his shoulders like a little parrot. The boy loved seeing the world from the top.

“I am not a demon. I am an angel.”

“Huh,” I said before the aneurysm burst in my brain.

“Those who have told you I am a demon have lied.”

Jason laughed because what else can you do? “An angel? From heaven?”

“There is no heaven,” Ralph said.

“Careful with blasphemy,” I added, forgetting myself. Jason elbowed me. I earned that.

“Heaven is not what man imagines it to be - a pleasing palace among the clouds. Heaven is a much more complex and misunderstood place. My time apart has made my heart miss home, and yet I do not yearn for it. There was much discord, warring factions among my kind.”

“It happens all the time with any size group.”

“The Watchers caused the rupture. They corrupted not only man but themselves. Unable to control their urges with the child bearers of your race, and thus brought forth new evils into this world.”

“And the Watchers did this to you?”

“Yes. They tricked me, bound my feet and hands, and left me here. Entombed away from the vision of the true one. Here I have sat for eons awaiting my salvation. Are you my salvation, mortal?”

“Ugh, I sell books. Bookmarks. Coffee. Not sure I’m anyone’s salvation.”

“Can we see you?” Jason asked, blissfully cutting me off.

“You can look, but you won’t truly see. Not the way you’re used to.”

Jason leaned into me and whispered, “This is like talking with a fortune cookie.”

“We’re gonna come in,” I said, surprising even myself.

I shared a look with Jason. He didn’t look thrilled with this development, but like the gentleman he was, he entered the tiny room first. Holding his arm for stability, I crossed the threshold.

The room was freezing. Goosebumps rose immediately. It was small too, a fact made worse by the cell splitting the space in half. In the dim light spilling in from the bookstore, you could see only the faintest shape sitting in the corner. The figure looked small and frail, which would make sense considering where he’d been hiding for eons.

Jason and I both turned on our lights and pointed them at Ralph. He was a lump of naked white flesh sitting in a ball in the corner. When he turned his face to us, his bright red eyes shone back. His pupils constricted in the light. While the red eyes were concerning, what took the cake were the spires sprouting out from the top of his head.

“It’s a demon!” said a voice from the basement stairs. Jason and I spun to see Mom gawping at the creature from the last step.

Mom’s sudden arrival set Mookie off. He hissed, growled, and shot up the stairs in an orange blur. I wasn’t sure what got into him or where he’d go, but it was the least of my concerns at the moment.

Ralph stood, and his body transformed as he did. Gone was the frail wisp of a man (err…demon? Angel?) and in his stead was a muscled beast, horns scraping the well-worn ruts of the cinder block ceiling. He clutched the prison bars in front of him with his catcher-mitt hands. Why he didn’t just rip away the bars was beyond me - God knows he looked like he easily could.

“If you attack me, I shall strike you down,” Ralph said, his voice booming off the walls. “My protector grants me the strength to smite my foes.”

“She’s a sixty-five-year-old woman. I don’t think you have to call God down on her.”

“He’s not calling down God. He’s calling to Satan! Get out of there before he corrupts you both!”

“She is a Watcher,” Ralph said.

“That’s my mom.”

“She deceives you. This is one of the Watchers. A demon come to claim their prize.”

Mom turned to us. “Get out of there! He’s going to ruin you.”

“They are coming for you,” Ralph said to me. “Unlatch the door, and I can protect you.”

I moved my phone over to the cell door. There was a tiny stick jammed in the lock. A single little sprig of some dried-up wood that wouldn’t have kept a toddler out. Mookie could’ve broken it.

“You can’t break that twig of a lock open?”

“No. Only a human can break it.”

“Don’t touch that lock,” Mom said. “You let this beast out, and it’ll kill us all.”

I turned to Jason, who looked as confused as I felt. “What do you think?”

“I…I don’t know,” he said. “Who’s telling the truth?”

“That’s the sixty-four thousand dollar question,” I said. My eyes went back and forth between Mom and Ralph. I felt a pain in the pit of my stomach.

“Lillian, we’ve had our differences over the years, and God knows I was against this purchase, but you have to listen to your mother over a demon.”

“Yes. Yes,” I said. I should believe her. I would. But something was stopping me. A nagging feeling at the base of my skull. A warning from my ancestors that lit up my brain with flashing “caution!” signs.

“Lilian, who are all these people?”

The voice came from the top of the stairs. I stepped out of the room and saw Mom — er, another Mom — standing at the top of the steps. She was still in her pajamas and looked confused. When she saw another version of herself next to me, she let out a surprised yelp and grabbed the banister for support.

Why were there two of my mom? One was bad enough. With everything unfolding the way it had, my head was swimming already. Instead of laps in a pool, though, I think it was trying to cross the English Channel.

I felt lost.

Confused.

Adrift.

“Break the lock, release me, and I will help you,” Ralph said, his voice pleading.

“That woman is one of his tricks,” Basement Mom said.

“I am a lot of things, madam, but a trick isn’t one of them,” Stair Mom responded. “Lillian, use your common sense and free this thing.”

“Why?”

“Because he’s the only thing that can help us!”

“Lies!” Basement Mom said, lovingly placing her hand on my arm. “She’s trying to fool you, dear.”

“Get your hands off my daughter!” Stairs Mom said, rushing down the steps. She slapped Basement Mom’s hand away. “She’s a monster, Lil. This whole town is full of them.”

“How do you know?”

“The library book. I looked it up - there is no Saint Asbeel!” she exclaimed. “Abseel was a demon. They all worship a demon!”

Silence rushed in. I felt my guts double-knot. I held on to Jason to brace myself from collapsing. I tried to speak - wanted to - but for once, nothing came out of me.

The chanting broke the silence.

From outside, you could hear what sounded like the entire town standing outside the church, repeating the exact phrase over and over.

“Through our sacrifice, we shall prosper.”

“They’re coming,” Mom, my real Mom, said. She ran for the cage to break the stick, but Basement Mom shoved her hard in the back. Mom launched forward, smashing her head on the corner of a jagged cinder block. She collapsed to the ground with a sickening thud.

“Mom!” I went down to check on her. Blood was pooling all around her head. I checked for a pulse and found none. “Mom!”

Jason ran for the cage, but as he did, Basement Mom shot out her hand, and a yellow light exploded from her fingertips. It struck Jason in the chest, and he stumbled back, clutching himself. As he fell back, we locked eyes, and he mouthed the word “run.”

I stood on shaky legs. The chanting was louder now - they’d entered the church. I turned to Basement Mom, who was grinning ear to ear. She reached behind her head, dug her nails into her flesh, and yanked hard.

The sickening sound of tearing filled the room. Basement Mom ripped away her own bloody flesh. Gobs of it hitting the ground with wet slaps. Loose hair floating in the dim light. The way she pulled at her skin, I expected to see a skeleton staring at me.

But that’s not who I saw. Instead of the bone white of a skull confronting me, I was face to face with someone who’d been pestering me for days. Darcy.

“W-what?” was all I could compel myself to say.

“Break the stick!” Ralph yelled, but the deafening chanting from the top of the stairs drowned his voice out. I turned back and saw the deadly choir, dressed in black robes with red runes stitched onto their chests, slowly marching toward me.

“You don’t know how lucky you are,” Darcy said in a measured tone. “To witness proof of divine power. A view so few outsiders get to see.”

I tried to run toward Ralph, but dozens of people rushed down the stairs and grabbed my arms and legs. I thrashed and yanked, but the sheer number of hands on me left me immobile. A fly trapped in a spider’s web.

“W-who are you people?”

Darcy laughed - the same stupid and friendly chuckle she used all the time. “We’re not people at all. God calls us mistakes - evil unleashed by Asbeel’s misdeeds. The unholy union of man and angel - a spawn to all that is dire and bleak. We are the children of the dark, my dear, and you are our necessary tribute.”

I turned back to Darcy. “You’re a monster!”

“And you’re just in time to celebrate the harvest,” she whispered in my ear. She cackled as she tapped the middle of my forehead.

Everything went black.



**Harvest Festival Day**

“And the second is called Asbeel: he imparted to the children of the holy angels the evil counsel and led them astray so that they defiled their bodies with the daughters of men.""

\- Book of Enoch: Chapter 69, Verse 5

The smell of kerosene brought me back from the dark. It was all around me. The fumes filled my nostrils and made me see small bright stars in my closed eyes. When my lids finally fluttered open, the first thing I noticed was the orange rays of the rising sun. A new dawn. A fresh start.

I was standing, and when I tried to move, I found that someone had lashed my body to a pole in the middle of the massive bonfire I’d heard the festival planner discussing earlier. At my feet, I saw the lifeless bodies of Jason, Mookie, and Mom.

Oh God, my loving, gentle Jason.

Mookie, my curious, precious boy.

My wonderful, headstrong mother. My foil and my heart.

I’d killed them all. Tears flooded my eyes and washed down my cheeks. My lofty dreams had manifested in our waking nightmare. I offered them hundreds of apologies, hoping that would wake them up. Bring life back to them.

It didn’t.

The church bells chimed. I looked up and noticed the entire town standing around the bonfire, heads lowered in silent prayer. I screamed at them to let me go. Bargained with them. I would keep their secret if they let me leave. Appealed to their humanity, whatever of it might still be in their diseased minds.

I begged for mercy I’d never receive.

As the bells tolled, one by one, the townsfolk finished their prayers and raised their faces to me. I saw them all: Sweet Lou, Chip Hogshead, Rachel, and the rest. Blank faces, all of them. No humanity behind their eyes.

Darcy, their ringleader, stood in front of them. She held a torch above her head, welcoming the morning orange glow with one of her own. She was the only person still with their head bowed in prayer.

“Darcy! Darcy! Please! Not like this, please! Have mercy!”

The church bells ceased ringing.

“Asbeel, we offer you this harvest.”

She tossed the torch onto the kerosene-soaked woodpile. It instantly ignited. The last thing I remember feeling was the bubbling of my skin and the painful screams I let out as the fire consumed me.

\*\*\*

“Judy, have you ever heard of Sky’s End?” the eager husband asked his wife.

“What is Sky’s End? Sounds like a video game.”

“It’s a gorgeous small town. Look at these photos,” he said, clicking through the slideshow on the Real Estate page.

“Oh, wow,” she said. “You weren’t kidding. Super pretty. Why are you showing me photos of a small town?”

The husband smiled. “I know you’ve always wanted to open a game store, right? A quirky little place where people can gather and play games and all that stuff?”

“Sure, that’s the dream. But it’s a dream for a reason - we’re broke.”

“Well, I may have been secretly saving money for a little while.”

“What?”

“Enough for a down payment. They have a building for sale. Cheap. Like, dirt cheap. Look.”

A few clicks later, he brought up the building in question. The wife laughed and smiled. “They’re selling their church?”

“Look at the cost, babe. It’s nothing. Practically giving it away. We can swing that.”

“Hmm,” she said. “Maybe we should schedule a showing?”

“I already have,” the husband said. “Rose is the name of the Realtor. Very nice lady. Sounded old as dirt, but that might benefit us.”

The wife beamed. “Is this for real? Are we really considering this?”

“Hell yeah, we are,” the husband said, patting his wife’s hand. “I have a good feeling about this.”",2,1766025820.0,sunheadprime,0,1.0,False

*“Under his watch, we all prosper.”*

*- Sky’s End town slogan*

Mom had insisted on taking us out for breakfast the following morning. There aren’t a ton of choices, so we went with Sweet Lou’s Diner on Main. Sweet Lou was as brassy as a 9th Ward band with sass to spare. She wouldn’t be out of place in a 40s noir movie, which I found charming, but results may vary.

“Hey doll, how goes the ol’ sit-stand-kneel house?” Sweet Lou said, pouring us all mugs of coffee.

“Coming along. Should be ready to go in time for the festival.”

“Thank the big guy,” she said. “So important that the church is up and running by then.”

“It’s a bookstore now,” Mom said. “Ludicrous, I know.”

“Still have the stained glass?” she asked.

“Yep,” Jason said.

“And the spire? The bell?”

I looked down at my watch and pointed outside. As the minute hand spun, the tolling started. “I couldn’t shut the bell off if I tried.”

“Then I still say it’s a church. To be square with you, I’m glad someone is taking care of it again. I don’t wanna tell tales outta school, but Father was a little lax with the upkeep.”

“You don’t say?” Jason said with a knowing smile.

“That St. Asbeel statue had so much debris on its face, I had someone ask me if it was supposed to be Karl Malden.”

“Why did the church go up for sale? I assume people in this town still need to have a place of worship?” Mom asked.

Sweet Lou shrugged. “I heard it was church business, doll. The big religious muckity mucks did some reconfigurin’ and thought St. Mark’s in Silver Pond was big enough for two flocks.”

“Big church muckity mucks?” I said. “How high up are we talking? Mighty thin air near the top.”

“Not the big guy or his son, but maybe his pal with the hat,” Lou said with a smirk. “Just what I heard. I ain’t been to church since I started sinning. You guys know what you want?”

We ordered, and Lou dashed off to get it started. Mom took a sip of the coffee and marveled at how it tasted. She even gave it a little “Mmm” like the commercials.

“Lil, I meant to tell you, I had a strange dream last night.”

“Was it a hamburger eating you?”

“No, dear, nothing as ironic as all that. I was standing outside your church, and I saw a man standing on the roof. He was glowing white and speaking, but I couldn’t understand what he was saying. Then he just disappeared. Isn’t that odd?”

“If he’s a licensed and bonded roofer and he’s affordable, he’s hired. One less thing I have to do,” Jason said, sipping his coffee.

“What do you think it means?”

“I don’t have the foggiest idea. Sometimes, dreams are just dreams.”

“The lesser-known Freud analysis,” I said, doing a horrid German accent. “Dreams are just funny puzzles with no meaning.”

“Well, Doctor, what do you think it means?”

I took a sip of my coffee and gave it a once-over. “Maybe it means God is watching over the bookstore?”

“You mean church, darling.”

“I do, mother, yes. Or maybe Doctor Manhattan shed the blue and paid us a visit in this timeline and the next and the next.”

Mom waved me off. “I don’t have any clue what you’re talking about half the time.”

Jason leaned in between us and nodded at the back corner of the diner. “You noticed that guy watching us the entire time we’ve been in here?”

“Maybe he’s taken by our beauty.”

“I keep catching him looking over. He mumbled something to the table next to him, and they started looking over. He’s not the first guy I’ve seen, either. The whole town seems to be interested in us.”

“I mean, you two are the newest members in a town that seems to be closely knit. They’re probably sizing you all up. Seeing how well you’ll fit in.”

“I thought clique drama all stopped in high school.”

“Lil, high school dynamics never change. There are always in-groups and out-groups. Right now, you’re riding the line.”

“Maybe if we go to the pep rally and they see our school spirit, they’ll accept us as one of them,” I joked.

“Laugh, but a good impression at that festival would go a long way in earning their trust. Small towns are small for a reason - they want it that way. Outsiders bring in outsider ideas.”

“You make us sound like plague rats or Kevin Bacon in Footloose.”

“You the folks that bought the church, right?” said the gossip-monger Jason had spotted. Without us noticing, he’d crept to our table and loomed over us.

The shock of the stranger’s voice caught me, and I nearly choked on my coffee. Jason, who’d been vigilant, took the lead. “We are, yes. Jason, Lilian, and Joan. You are?”

“Chip Hogshead, Hogshead Lumber,” he said, extending his hand. “Been in town since the founding.”

“You don’t look a day over thirty,” I said, finding my composure.

“How you folks finding Sky’s End?”

“Lovely,” I said. “So welcoming.”

“We are, but that’s a secret. Don’t go blabbing to all the city folk and bring them here. Changes the town, ya know?”

“Present company excluded,” Jason said.

“Remains to be seen,” he said, eying us. “You seem like good people, though.”

“They are,” Mom said. “And everyone we’ve met here has been the same.”

“Glad to hear. Hope to see you all at the bonfire. I donated the lumber. Warped dead stock, but it’ll burn. At a certain temperature, everything does, right?” He laughed, and we gave him polite smatterings in return, but the concern between the three of us was visible to anyone with a clue. “Have a good one. Can’t wait to see the church!”

“Bookstore,” I quietly offered.

“Order up,” Sweet Lou said, placing our food down in front of us. We ate most of the meal in silence.

Mom said she wanted to go see the town library and left us for the day. It was fine with me. Jason and I needed to get back to the grindstone at the church. I imagined Darcy somewhere sensing we were behind on our projects and having a mini-embolism. Hell hath no fury like a festival planner scorned.

Jason had taken to building out some of the shelving units, and I was organizing books by genre when I got the feeling that I was being watched again. At first, I assumed it was Mookie waiting for me to glance in his direction so I could feed him, but he was sleeping on a pile of Stephen King books. I turned behind me, toward the front door, and didn’t see anyone standing there.

I shook it off and kept at my task, but the feeling wouldn’t go away. After another excruciating minute of that feeling gnawing at me, I made my way over to Jason and got his read on things. He was knee-deep in attaching panel C to board F when I came over.

“I hate that these adult LEGOs have become the go-to standard for furniture.”

“Diabolical Swedes,” I said. “Hey, do you feel like someone is watching you?”

“I just assumed you were.”

“I glance, but that’s not what I’m talking about. The last two days, I’ve felt like someone has been in here watching me while I work.”

“Darcy has eyes everywhere?”

“I’m sure she does, but that’s not what I’m talking about.”

“I know,” he said, putting down the plank of wood. “I’ve had that feeling too. The way the people at the diner were staring and talking has really stuck with me.”

“Did we make the right call buying this place?”

“I think so. I think your mom was right. We’re the new guy on the job. It takes a bit for the new guy to find their place. We can’t force it.”

I plopped down next to him, picked up an Allen wrench, and twirled it in my fingers. “I just want this awkward stage to be over.”

Jason spoke, but the sound of a stack of books crashing to the ground near the back door shut us up. He glanced, and me and pointed for us to move closer to the source of the noise. He floated across the floor, careful not to make a sound, and I felt my heartbeat tick up.

I crouched and slowly slunk to where he was standing. From our vantage point, we could see that our back door was open. There was a strong wind, and several of the books had flipped open, and the pages turned as if a meth-addled ghost was speed reading.

I saw Jason’s shoulders relax. He turned back to me and whispered, “I think the wind blew the door open. I should replace that latch.”

In the shadowy area about ten feet in front of us, we heard the skittering of sharp nails on the wood floor. Jason ran over and caught sight of something small and furry dashing off deeper into the stacks. “It’s a raccoon!”

“What?” I said. Behind me, I heard the soft TAP TAP TAP of nails on the floor. I turned back and saw several other raccoons scattering away from us. I don’t know what came over me, but I started chasing after them. They moved quickly, but their little paws failed to find purchase on the ground. The last one blew a tire and slid into the bookshelf. As it rolled onto its back and I got a look at its face, I screamed.

There was a person’s face staring back at me.

Raccoon’s body. Human face. All terror.

“The hell?!” I screamed and fell back onto my ass and kicked away from it as hard as I could. My yell was so loud I was afraid I’d shatter the stained glass.

The raccoon flopped back onto its feet and sprinted like a bat out of hell through the maze of bookshelves and out of sight. Jason came running over, helped me off the ground, and tried to make sense of my rambling.

“Lil, Lil, you’re not making any sense. The raccoons were eating a human face?”

“It had a human face!

Jason laughed. I don’t think he was making fun of me. I just don’t think his brain could process that sentence in any logical way. The idea of it was so absurd, and yet, I’d seen it. Once his titters died down, he asked, “Are you sure it didn’t have a mask on? Might have got tangled up with some Halloween decorations before it came in.”

“It had a face. It…it looked familiar.”

“Lil, did you hit your head when you fell or….”

“Jason, I’m serious. I know what I saw.”

The church’s front door burst open. It was Jeff from Jeff’s Market. He looked disheveled. His wet, sweaty hair slicked back behind his ears. His dirty, puddle-brown eyes were manic, and he moved with the grace of someone with two left feet. He stumbled into the store, looked me dead in the eye, and said, “Did you know you had about six raccoons run out of here?”

“Why I screamed, Jeff,” I said, trying to compose myself. It didn’t work. My whole body was still trembling.

“That’s the midnight brood,” he said, glancing to and fro to make sure we were the only ones who heard. “Not sure why they were out already. Not like them at all.”

“What?”

“Those things are everywhere. I’d started tracking them at night.”

“Darcy said you were feeding them,” Jason said.

“That’s what I told her,” he said, closing the door behind him and walking toward us. “But it’s not true. I started noticing their strange behavior when I bought the store about a year ago. They moved in a pack from building to building every night.”

“Looking for food?” Jason asked.

“I’ve never seen them eat. I even left out a cake for them to try. They left it alone.”

“What are they doing?”

“I don’t know, but it’s not natural. I’ve brought it up with the town officials, but they said I’m crazy. Said rural raccoons act differently than the ones I’d seen in the cities growing up.”

“Have you ever…seen one with…umm…a human face?”

Jeff paused and then shook his head. “Never. Why?”

“She was reading one of the new horror books we have in. She’s just joking,” Jason said, coming to my rescue. “You’re new here, too?”

“I was the newest before you,” he said. “Was going to buy this building, actually, and turn it into an event space - JC Hall - then the store came up for sale after Mr. Greggio died. A small-town grocer seemed like less of a headache than an event space. I switched up.”

“Have you noticed the townspeople…?”

“Watching you? Yeah. They do for a while. I think people were mad I didn’t go forward with the event space. Sweet Lou said it wasn’t right that I backed out of the church sale at the last minute. Said it ruined last year’s Harvest Festival. Refused to serve me for three months!”

I had another question or two, but then the door opened again, and Darcy came walking in. She was as put together as I’d ever seen her. Dressed as sharp as a knife blade, with makeup and hair to match. “Howdy! Coming by for the daily drop-in. Looks worse in here than before. The church will be ready, correct?”

Jason stepped up. “Yes, we’re organizing books before shelving them. The mess is required but temporary.”

“You look all glammed up,” I said, checking to see if she was hiding a raccoon tail. My mind was still shaky, but I didn’t want to give up the ghost to Darcy.

Darcy laughed. “I like to get gussied up for the festival. Told Claire at the salon to ‘be bold’! I think it worked! I feel younger!” She noticed Jeff standing there, and her face shifted to disappointment. “Are you the reason the raccoons were just seen running amok in the town square?”

“Not this time,” he said. “But I should get back to the store. It was nice chatting with you two. The place looks great. JC Hall great.”

As soon as he was out of earshot, Darcy sighed. “The nerve to bring up JC Hall in my presence. Nearly ruined the Festival.”

Mookie, freshly awakened from his nap, was curling around my legs. I picked him up and was about to smother him with pets when he locked eyes with Darcy. He howled, shot out his nails, and clawed away from me. He went behind a pile of books, but his attention was solely on Darcy.

“Jesus, Mook! Gotta cut those nails!”

“He’s shy,” Jason said.

“I’m nice,” Darcy said, waggling her fingers at Mookie. “We can be friends.”

He let out a guttural yowl and sprinted for the basement stairs. A second later, he was gone. The silence in the room was deafening.

“Don’t take offense. He hated me for six months at first.” Jason said, adding, “He’s a mama’s boy.”

“Who wouldn’t love such a lovely young woman?” Darcy said. “If you want a refresh before D-Day, tell Franny at ‘Citizen Snips’ I recommended her.”

Darcy turned to leave but stopped in her tracks. The floor under us had started to vibrate. Not an earthquake, but like someone had put speakers under our feet and blasted a ‘90s bass track CD. It rattled books off the shelves. When it stopped, Darcy looked over at us and smiled.

“That was….”

All the windows in the building shot open at once. I let out another scream and shook my head. “There’s something wrong with this place. Something very wrong.”

“Dear, didn’t Rose the realtor tell you about the ghosts?”

“What?” Jason said, dumbstruck.

“Oh, Rose,” Darcy said, shaking her head. “She’s getting on in years. Probably should retire.”

“Darcy, I don’t give a shit about Rose’s future career,” I snapped. “What the hell are you talking about? Ghosts?”

“Yes, well, I don’t want to tell tales out of school, but the whole town knows about the spooks of St. Asbeel. Kinda a local legend. They’re mostly harmless, but seem to get agitated before the Festival.”

“I’m gonna throw up,” I said, finding a chair and taking a seat.

“Sorry to be the bearer of bad news. If it helps, I can call the priest over in Silver Pond to see if he can do anything. Maybe a blessing after the festival?”

“Even before,” Jason said. “That’d be great.”

“I will call him this afternoon,” she said. Darcy glanced at me. I looked green around the gills, and her face puckered into a sympathetic pout. “I’ll leave you be. Feel better, okay? Big day tomorrow!”

As soon as the door closed, I found the garbage can and unloaded my Sweet Lou breakfast. Jason rushed over and held back my hair as I went in for round two. Once I’d purged everything, I looked up, my eyes watery and my face flushed. “Should we sell this place?”

“What? Lil, we’d lose everything. All of our money is invested in this place. I quit my job to dedicate myself to this dream.”

“I know, I know,” I said, spitting out the last remnants of breakfast into the can. “But this is starting to feel wrong. Maybe God is giving us signs to leave?

The church bells began chiming.

“Very subtle, God,” I muttered.

The front door opened, and Mom blew in like the wind. She had a bag slung over her shoulder, stuffed with library books. She glanced around at all the open windows and shook her head. “Are you fumigating?” She stopped when she saw me, sweaty and clutching a garbage can. “Lil, have you been sick?”

“Must’ve been something I ate.”

“It was those pancakes. I didn’t like the look of them. Anyway, I went to the charming little library down the street and started looking up anything I could find on the church’s history. I’d never heard of St. Asbeel. Anthony, Christopher, Michael, Francis  — I’ve heard of them. But Asbeel? Nope. So I grabbed this book,” she said, hauling out a book the size of a Buick. “A Complete Guide to Saints, Angels, and Demons. It seemed very thorough.”

“Does it double as a weapon against demons?” I jokingly asked.

Mom ignored me. “I also wanted to know a bit more about this town. Everyone here seems so intent on keeping up traditions and all that, I assumed there would be a robust selection of historical books to read…but there wasn’t!”

“Where did the rest of those books come from then?” Jason asked, nodding at her full bag.

“Silver Pond’s public library. I asked about Sky’s End, and they told me all about the town and this little church of yours.”

“Bookstore.”

“Turns out, the church higher-ups, whoever they are, did not close this church. They had no idea what I was talking about. Same with the Harvest Festival. They’d never heard of it. Isn’t that odd?”

I shared a glance with Jason, who nodded. “Maybe it’s a close-knit Sky’s End tradition. You heard the lumber guy talk about bringing in city folks.”

“Funny you should bring him up,” she said, pulling out a dusty old tome. “I asked if there was a book about the town’s history, and they gave me this one about all the local towns in the area and their founding. The section on Sky’s End is very thin, but there was a drawing of some of the town’s first inhabitants. Tell me, does this man look familiar?”

She held up a book and pointed to an ancient sketch on yellowed paper. At first, I couldn’t place it, but then it clicked. “That’s the lumber guy,” I said, my jaw open. “Chip Hammers.”

“Hogshead,” Jason said. “Hammers?”

“Cut me some slack. I just yakked,” I said. “But yes, there is a strong family resemblance.”

“I have a theory, but it’s a bit out there,” Mom said. “I don’t think…”

Mom’s theory never saw the light of day. Just outside the church, we heard the screeching of tires followed by a sickening thud and women screaming. We rushed outside and saw a small group of people huddled around a person in the middle of the street.

It was Jeff.

But the small town life isn't everything it's cracked up to be...especially when she makes an unsettling discovery in the basement.

**Two Days Before the Harvest Festival**

*Join us for the annual March to St. Asbeel*

“It’s a church,” Mom said, staring at the stained glass windows of Jesus hanging on the cross. Her narrowed eyes and pursed lips told me she was clearly holding back additional commentary.

“It was a church,” I said. “Now it’s a bookstore. My bookstore.”

“What?”

“I bought it! That was the surprise!”

“I thought it’d be grandchildren. You made it seem like grandchildren, Lillian.”

“In fairness to me, I am increasing the flock.”

“Not funny.”

“Yes, it is,” I said with a smile. “I’m thinking of calling it ‘The Church of the Perpetual To-Read List’.”

“But it’s a church, darling.”

“In a previous life, yes, it was a church. Now it’s a bookstore.”

“Churches don’t have previous lives.”

“I know Christian dogma doesn’t allow reincarnation, but Jesus or his pals never mentioned that buildings can’t start over as something else.”

“I just don’t know who’d buy books from a church, is all.”

“Mom, the best selling book of all time is the Bible. I feel like you’re not understanding the basic premise here.”

“Lillian, I understand the basic premise. I just don’t understand why you picked this place to open a bookstore.”

“It was either this place or Kitty’s Whorehouse, but that place is still in business.”

“Oh, Lillian, please. In front of a house of worship,” she said, walking inside the building.

We were still moving in, so the building was half church, half bookstore, but it still received the full Mom judgment. She walked around, running her fingers over some pews and checking how dirty they were. Admittedly, they were still filthy because I was currently removing them, but the store was coming into shape. I was scheduled to open in two days, so I’d basically been living in the store to get it finished in time.

“So, I’m thinking of having new releases up front, couches where the pews are, the front desk floating in the middle, an entire section over here for romance and romantasy books, and a coffee stand with free mugs with purchase.”

“Don’t give away coffee, dear. It invites a slothful element. And what’s romantasy?”

“Books where fantasy creatures do what typically happens in the back of cars on prom night. Often in graphic detail.”

Mom crinkled her face. “And these kinds of books are popular?”

“The most popular.”

“No wonder the modern world is in the shape it is.”

“Lil, is this the last of the books?” Jason asked, taking off his well-worn Phillies cap and wiping his brow.

“This shipment, yes. But another one is due later today.”

“It never ends,” he said, shaking his head. “Jesus, this humidity is going to kill me.”

“Jason, please don’t blaspheme in the Lord’s house,” I said with a wink.

“I wasn’t blaspheming. I was appealing to a higher power.”

“Are you two quite finished with your little rat-a-tat?”

“We’ve been at this for days. I’m too tired for rats or tats,” Jason said. “What do you think of the place?”

“It has all the charm of a small-town church.”

“What we were going for,” I said, adding, “Praise be.”

“Amen,” Jason said.

“Well, your little jokes aside, I admire what you two are doing here. I’m a big fan of literacy and third places. You’re building quite a nice ‘hangout spot’ for the town, so kudos to you both.”

“Thank you, Mom,” I said. “Seriously, means a lot.”

“I knew you had it in you,” she said. “I didn’t imagine it’d take this long to find it, but better late than never.”

“There it is,” I said with a chuckle. “That’s the mom I love.”

“Did Lil tell you about the basement?” Jason said, changing gears.

“I didn’t know churches had basements,” Mom said. “Though I suppose you need a place to keep the crackers and wine for service.”

“You make it sound like they served hors d’oeuvres.”

“I think that’s where the priests used to live. Tight but cozy.”

“Noisy, too,” I said absentmindedly.

“What?” Mom asked. “How so?”

Jason looked at me, annoyed. I sighed; this was my mistake, and I was going to have to guide us out. “Well, sometimes, when you’re down there, you hear voices.”

“Voices?” Mom said, surprised.

“Voices, breathing, some knocking,” I said. “Could just be the church settling.”

“Or the good Lord making himself present,” Jason added, trying to smooth out my rough road.

“Jason, dear, if the walls are breathing, it’s not God’s work. Try the guy a little south of there,” Mom said, shaking her head. “Did you know about this when you bought the place?”

“Didn’t come up. We have since sacrificed a virgin to appease the gods, and that seems to have worked.”

“Very clever, Lil.”

“We’re making it our horror section,” Jason said. “It’s got the vibe for it. I’ve been working on dressing it up.”

“It’s his pet project,” I said. Just then, my mewing orange tiger-striped cat joined us and gave me the perfect chance to shift gears away from the breathing walls. “Speaking of, here’s Mookie Petts. He’s the grandson you were hoping for, Mom.”

“Lovely.”

“Hey boy, how’re things out in Sky’s End? Busy?”

He meowed, flopped onto his back, and rolled into my feet. I reached down and scritched his belly. He rolled back and forth for a bit before popping up, wrapping himself around my legs, and sprinting off into the church.

“Is it sanitary to have a cat roaming around?”

“Mookie is good people. Plus, he’s got a job. Keep mice and rats out.”

“It remains to be seen if he’s even capable of that,” Jason said. “So far, all I’ve seen him master is sleeping in the sunbeams from the stained glass.”

“He works at his own pace,” I said. “If you’re too hard on him, you’ll give him a complex. Then he’ll be a weird adult.”

“He might even buy a church and turn it into a bookstore,” Mom said with a nod. I laughed. She still had her fastball. “Is the basement ready to be seen?”

“Not just yet. Close though.”

“The body parts we ordered haven’t come in. It is so hard to find a reliable grave robber these days.”

“Jason, I don’t know how you put up with her.”

He hugged me around my waist. “Who doesn’t love a challenge?”

“Hey,” I said, playfully smacking him. “That and you love me.”

“That, and I love her.”

“We all do,” Mom said. “Though some days are harder than others.”

“It builds character, Mom.”

“Knock, knock,” came a sing-songy voice from the front door. We all looked over and saw Darcy, the town mayor, come sauntering inside the church. She was always this chipper, which is probably why she’d been elected six times in a row. That and nobody really wanted to be mayor. In a place as small as Sky’s End, there really wasn’t too much to do. It was the perfect job for someone who needs to stay busy with minor tasks.

“Darcy, how goes the mayoral dealings today?”

“Oh, you know, the fun never stops. Had to remind Jeff at Jeff’s Market not to feed the raccoons at night. I’m afraid he’s domesticating them.”

“I’ve seen so many of them around the church at night, I’m thinking of hiring them as security.”

Darcy sighed. “They’re not even afraid of people anymore. I went out last night to check on some noises I heard behind my shop, and I saw ten of them standing there just waiting for a handout.”

“Those things are disease-ridden,” Mom said. “Ghastly beasts.”

“They’re cute,” I said.

“No, your mother is right. They’re a blight on the city. We’ve worked long and hard to make Sky’s End a picturesque small town, and I won’t have roving gangs of raccoons ruining it.”

“Roving gangs? Is it like West Side Story? Rival raccoon gangs fighting for turf, the love of a pretty young thing, and to sing songs about their favorite dumpsters,” I said.

“You laugh, but when they’re crawling inside this place, eating your books, you’ll want them gone too,” Darcy said. “But I didn’t stop by to talk about the night bandits - not this time, at least - I came to see if you were still on track for the opening date?”

“Ugh, yeah, I think so,” I said, turning to Jason to help confirm.

“We should be good enough to open. Might still have a few odds and ends to finish, but we’re on track.”

“I hired the best contractors,” I said, slapping Jason on the butt.

“Well, that’s great to hear! The Harvest Festival is the premier event on the Sky’s End social calendar. The night walk to St. Asbeel’s Church is a storied tradition handed down from the town’s founders. It’s essential that we keep the tradition going. The town will pillory me if I screw it up. We’ve already promised our sponsors that we would be ready to go. We have to be ready to go.”

“I know it looks dusty in here, but we’re going to be okay.”

She surveyed the construction and shook her head. “Are you sure? I know you’re new to the town, so the importance of this may be lost on you, but….”

“Darcy,” I said, interrupting her nervous breakdown, “if my man says we’re on track, I believe him. We’re golden.”

She turned to Jason. “Are you sure?”

“Positive. It looks worse than it is.”

“My daughter is a lot of things, but a liar isn’t one of them. If she says it’ll be done, it’ll be done.”

“I give you permission to unclench,” I said, touching Darcy’s tensed shoulders.

She must’ve believed us, because her whole body relaxed. She smiled and gave me a small clap. “Sorry to come across as manic, but there are so many people who look forward to this event, and I just want it to be special.”

“And you’re up for re-election, right?” I joked.

She smiled. “Well, that might be a secondary reason, yes. You are a bright one.”

“At least 60 watts,” I said.

“Well, I will leave you to your, uh, cleaning? I look forward to seeing it all done,” she said. She saw the sign for the large romantasy section and squealed in delight. “Oh my! Is this area going to be all romantasy?”

“Yes, ma’am. All the fairy lovin’ fun that’s fit to print.”

She lowered her voice and smiled. “Don’t tell anyone, but that is my favorite genre! So spicy yet so fun!”

“Your secret is safe with me,” I said. “Come by when we officially open, and I’ll let you take the pick of the litter. On the house.”

“I am going to take you up on that offer, dear!” Darcy said, nearly floating out of the building.

As she left, I turned to Jason. “Did I just bribe the mayor?”

“Sounded like it, Lil.”

“I think I just became involved in a political scandal.”

“I’d call you deep throat, but your mother’s nearby,” he whispered.

“Jason, dear, can you help me bring in my things from the car? I’d like to get my room set up before nightfall, and I’d hate to be accosted by roaming raccoons,” she said, apparently not hearing his joke or choosing to ignore it.

I kissed Jason on the forehead, and the two of them left to bring Mom’s stuff into our little house across the street. I watched them go and felt a strange emotion overtake me. Happiness. It felt weird, like putting your tongue on a nine-volt battery.

With everyone gone and Mookie running around doing God knows what, I had a little time to do a walk around the church and take stock of what else I needed to do. It was in these quieter moments that I allowed myself to push aside the joy of ownership and focus on what other chores we’d had to take on.

It was always our dream to open a charming bookshop in a small town. I’ve always been an avid reader, and Jason loves a project. The church coming up for sale wasn’t on our radar, but when we found the ad online - and the low price - we had to jump. Dreams don’t wait for the perfect time to happen - they just do.

It’d been a hectic month. Pulling the rows of church benches and pews was a nightmare, but once they were gone, the true vision of the store took shape. It was quirky and unique, but I found that all the best bookstores were. My favorite from childhood was an old, converted bank. The vaults held different genres. The owners had made a tunnel of books you could walk through. Local artists took up small corner offices where accountants had once toiled and now made something beautiful for all the patrons to see.

I wanted something like that - I found it in St. Asbeel.

The walls were adorned with exquisite stained-glass windows depicting the Stations of the Cross. When the sun reached midday, the store’s floor was bathed in a kaleidoscope of color. Above us was a spire that easily made us the tallest building in Sky’s End with a bell that would chime every hour. The heartbeat of the town. The grounds had flowering bushes, soaring oaks, and a greening copper statue of St. Asbeel himself looking out over the greenery. It was a perfect spot for a picnic or to read a chapter before heading back to work.

We were lucky we found this place.

I was in the former quiet room, née coffee cafe, when I heard the bell to the front door chime. Assuming it was Jason returning, I called out, “Hey, any chance you brought me lunch?” When there wasn’t a response, I turned around to see who had come into my clearly closed store, but didn’t see anyone.

“Jason? You here?”

Nothing. I walked out into the store’s central area and looked around. I didn’t notice anyone else in there, but I felt a presence there. Another energy. Sounds woo-woo, I know, but you know the charged feeling you get when you’re around others. I had that, but apparently I was the only one.

“Mookie, if you figured out how to ring the bell, I swear to God,” I started, but stopped when I heard footsteps heading down the stairs. I knew Jason had been determined to get his horror section into shape, but it was unlike him not to let me know he had come back.

I made my way to the stairs as quietly as mice wrestling on cotton and gave a listen. I didn’t hear any footsteps anymore. Instead, I heard a voice. It wasn’t Jason’s.

It also wasn’t clear, like hearing a radio through a wall. You know someone is talking, but the language is just word-shaped gibberish. Sims speaking to each other - clear as day to them, but leaving their creator guessing what the hell they mean.

I took a hesitant step down and cocked my ears as if I were fine-tuning the radio. Fiddling with the knobs until the static cleared and I could hear a Red Hot Chili Pepper’s song I hated anyway. Another step down toward the basement. Leaning forward, bracing myself on the banister. I could almost make out what they were saying. It was something like —

BOOM!

A book on the shelf behind me fell to the floor with a crash. I gasped as if someone had been choking the life out of me and nearly tumbled down the stairs. I spun around, expecting to see a ghoul rising from the floor, ready to possess me, but instead heard the soft, friendly trill from Mookie. He lay down on the shelf and knocked off two more books.

I caught my breath, laughed, and brought my forehead against his. “You’re so lucky you’re darling because otherwise I’d boot you outside to fight off those gang-affiliated raccoons.”

Once my heart jumped back into my body and started working again, I leaned down to listen for the voices, but heard nothing. I chalked it up to a radio outside and decided just not to think about bell ringing or the footsteps I’d heard. If there were ghosts, let them be welcoming. I can’t have them scaring away sales.",2,1766025628.0,sunheadprime,0,1.0,False

Im just coming here to ask a couple questions as I know everyone’s situation is different so googling isn’t that useful. My main complaint is that I’m not sure what course of action I should take as I need a lot of work done at a young age. I’m 19 and smoke/alcohol/coffee/anything extremely harmful free and maintain all proper hygiene for my mouth. Unfortunately that wasn’t always the case until about a year and a half ago. Thankfully I received insurance  for the first time in around 8 years this october and was able to visit a dentist. I had around 8-10 filings done; I can’t really remember but I could probably go back and look through my insurance claims. I broke 13 and 4 around a couple years back and only the root remain left under the gum line. I have an appointment to remove them and a consultation for implants in January. My main dilemma is that I need around 8 root canals. 7 of which are on my top teeth-3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 14 and 30 on the bottom. All of which have decayed down to pulp exposing nerve and the root canal. None of them are infected thankfully but are very painful and I can really only eat soft foods right now. I know that root canals can be hit or miss but that can be said for any procedure. I just want to go with the option that is going to last me the longest. Price is not really my main concern I really just want to be able to not be in pain and eat normally again. I just don’t really understand the long term pros and cons of each for someone my age. I have an appointment in January to begin root canals starting with 14 but I’m just don’t know if that’s my what I should do.

1ppff6v,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1ppff6v/feeling_overwhelmed_with_snhl/,Feeling overwhelmed with SNHL,"Hello, 

I know my experience is not unique but I really wanted to  vent out some frustration and seek advice. If you’re not in the headspace to listen I understand. 

My hearing aid mold snapped in half off the hook when I tried to clean it yesterday Thankfully I had an old pair stored away I used to get by with today but they were old and uncomfortable. They let me be able to call the audiologist this morning to make an emergency appointment to get new earmolds made stat and get my broken mold repaired to last until new ones get delivered. It has been a difficult day of driving around to and from work, then back to work to make this appt. happen. 

Ive been living with severe SNHL in both ears since birth and I’ve done alright. I got fitted with hearing aids at 9 months and wear them every day. I have the best mother and she advocated hard for me growing up. I would not be where I am today without her.  My hearing aids are lovely but when it goes wrong or is off slightly I get panicked overwhelmed and upset. My world is literally out of balance to me. I struggle socially, and feel left out in social settings that isn’t my family. 

After the kind of day I had I just kind of wish I don’t need hearing aids and could give them up. I know that has it‘s own set of different challenges. I’m sure ordering a coffee would be difficult, I imagine that dr appt.s would need a tablet to translate words into text, I’d need to learn asl, and try to join a deaf community if they’d accept me. And it would upsetting to not hear my husband‘s sweet voice so easily in a spoken conversation. 

  
I just am so frustrated of the in between world I live in. Is it possible to just give up on hearing aids and live “off air”? Has anyone here ever done it? How did you do it? Do you recommend it? Is it freeing? 

My husband is the kindest and I know he’d be right beside me to learn and adapt to that world if I chose it. I just don’t know what that world looks like since I’ve been living in the hearing world trying my best. It takes so much energy to live in it, and I do get to experience cool things like music. But is it better leaving the hearing aids behind?

Anyway, thanks for reading if you made it this far. Hope your day is going well ",2,1766024861.0,HearingLoss,0,1.0,False

The glossy dial with very yellowish indicators did not take to my aging attempts with coffee and heat. Over and over again in the oven at various temps ramping up from 200-300. It is if there is an enamel like coating for the gloss that also covers the hour markers that did not allow the solution to penetrate.

I went grabbed a few pairs of hands since I haven’t decided on a movement yet. Tried a little aging with coffee/ turmeric which seems to have turned out ok.

The watch case isn’t too bad, the dome seems a bit too high vbut I like it nonetheless. I’ll probably soften the hard machined edges a bit but otherwise I think it will work well. It does have pointed crown guards and I did a very light initial distressing with some washers and nuts tossed around in a plastic bag. 

 I’m trying it with the raffles ghost bezel and one of the riveted bracelets. The clasp isn’t exactly correct for the model so I may try the other variant.

I got fired from my job, then my landlord evicted me because I couldn't pay rent for the past two months. I just finished packing all my belongings into my car when my phone started to buzz. I grabbed it out of my pocket to see my friend Colby was calling me. He must've seen the rant I put all over social media. I casually answered ""Yo, whatsup?"" as I attempted to not sound bitter. ""I heard about your situation. I wanted to say you can stay at my place. I'll be on vacation this week, but you can make yourself at home there while I'm out of town."" He explained seemingly in a rush to spit out the words. ""Awesome! Thanks so much bro, I'll head over there in a minute then."" I said with a sigh of relief. ""Also sometimes the power to the main floor will go out and you can find the electrical box in the basement. Just flip the breaker and it should come back on."" He continued ""anyway I'm on the road right now I'll talk to you later man"" his voice followed by a monotone beep. 

I got into my car and decided I should head to Colby's house so that I can unpack and try to relax after all the stress I had been through lately. I started up the engine and backed out into the road. As I made my way down the road, I thought to myself ""Colby's house should only be a few minutes away."" However, traffic was terrible and nearly doubled the amount of time it should have taken me to get there. Finally as I pulled into his driveway, I felt some relief as I parked my car and got out with a few bags. As I opened the door, my mind goes to memories of the near past. Of college parties and get-togethers things that I found myself longing for again. Closing the door behind me I placed my bags down and started to unpack my chargers and my laptop. I set up everything on a coffee table in the living room at the time. As I sat down to boot up my laptop, I saw the TV mounted on the wall across from me. I got up and started digging the HDMI cord out of my bag, because what's better than watching DBZ on my computer? That's right, watching DBZ on my friend's flatscreen. After I got all that set up I grabbed a quick snack and started watching. I resumed from where I left off. Episode 205, it opens to Sayaiman protecting some civilians from giant flying dinosaurs along with a scene of Videl confronting Gohan about his secret identity. It flashed to the title page saying ""I'll fight too!"" on it. That's when the lights flickered and then went out. Only then had it occurred to me that I'd never actually been in the basement at Colby's place. 

I paused the episode and decided that it's time I found the electrical box in the basement. I stood up and made my way to the kitchen. On the back wall there is a door opening to a set of stairs which leads into the basement. I shined my phone flashlight into the dark room and quickly found the electrical box stuck to the back wall on the left of the basement. I looked around with my phone and stood there a moment confused. There's a wooden door plastered on the concrete wall across from the electrical box. By the looks of it, it surely didn't lead anywhere. I walked up to it to take a closer look. Despite where I found it, the door seemed quite normal. As I opened it I found a long hallway. Above me were shaded lights that hung from the tall ceiling and spread a low yellow light into the dry dusty hall. The air felt like sand on my skin, a rhythmic echo reverberated through the hall that had slammed into my ears like a wave. It washed away all my pre-conceived notions of my life, all that existed was the desert like hall and my stupified expression. Just as the hall had overtaken all of my vision I snapped back to remembering why I came down here. My whole life flooded back to me like a broken dam. I whipped around expecting to see the basement, yet all that lay before me was more hall. The echoed tune returned in waves, as it waxed and waned. 

I used all the strength I had left in me against the lull of the rhythmic tone. I urged my muscles to bend to my will as I ran. I was slow and sluggish at first but got used to it. As I was running and running all I could make out was the dusty scent around me and my footsteps under me, yet as I listened my footsteps seemed to double. While I looked behind me I saw a hulking man, he carried a boulder in his arms. He strutted at me slowly with a wide proud smile. I continued to run but it didn’t seem to serve to separate us much, he stood atop no shadow while mine danced behind me. As I ran down the hall another hall appeared out of one of the wall segments, in a quick decision I took off down the side hall. I can still hear that things steps thudding behind me.  Turn after turn the hulking creatures' steps remained consistent behind me. I've heard that in a maze you should follow the left wall so that's what I did. 

Up ahead I could see a boundary separating the part of the hall I was in and one in which the lights are dimmed and the wall and floors a darker color. Just before the boundary line a small, bald and saggy fleshed hag with marbled eyes is crouched facing the left wall. It traces its fleshy stub of a finger across a bloodstained P on the wall mumbling, all I could make out were the words. ""The mount under virtuous stars”. Just like the hulking man behind me the ground under this hag was missing its shadow. As I crossed the border line I looked back to see the hulking man's smile somehow grow wider, impossibly wide. The moment he stepped over the boundary the boulder dropped from his hands shaking the ground. In one awful split second he lunged, faster than before he bound down the darkened hall slowly gaining on me. I took another left turn, looking back as soon as the hulking man turned the corner behind me. Two creatures jump upon the hulking man similar in shape to the hags, but their skin is missing leaving large spaces on the surface of their bodies as exposed flesh. Patches of skin and features dot their bodies seemingly slapped on in a stable but mangled manner. Overtop their faces one wears a mask made from the skin of a woman's face their eye holes sown shut with copper wire. The other bore a skinless and bleeding face bearing the same copper wire holding its eyes firmly shut. Just as the first fleshy hand wetly made contact with the man the two creatures proceeded to tear the skin off the man and slap the skin onto their own bodies. The one without a face mask slaps the man's prideful smile onto its own previously exposed face. I continued to run as fast as I could down the halls, left turn after left turn. A small scuttling noise followed quietly behind me. The two creatures from before leap from shadow to shadow in the light they lack their own. They slowly trace my path behind me like how a wolf hunts a deer. Keeping my eyes in front of me, left turn on left turn I noticed something repeating on the ground written in dried blood stains were the repeated words ""Turn away from your desire"". The words only served to add an extra layer of confusion to all of this on top of the nauseating state of my mind. Up the hall crouched down by the left wall just before a wall of blackish ash-like fog sits another hag tracing another P onto the wall. It seems that the other creatures in this fucked up complex pay no heed to the sagging hags. 

As I crossed the boundary the fog carried the stench of iron mixed with dry ash. I could only see a matter of feet in front of me but I couldn't stop running. I stuck my hand out to the left wall and continued to run down the left halls. I could still hear their scuttling behind me, but now they carried on with frustrated grunt-like noises. Their grunts mix in with murmurs that seep through the foggy walls words like, ""The lamb of god, the bloodied sacrifice"" lined behind the growing noises of angry grunts and sobs followed by flesh tearing like fabric. As the hopelessness of my situation set into me, I pushed it out of my mind. I had no way of knowing how or why this had happened and I could feel my memory slowly vacating my mind. I decided that in my current state the best  thing I could do is keep turning left so that's what I did. I didn’t know if it would lead me out but anywhere would’ve been better. Just as I could feel my mind giving way to the horrible groaning and sobbing whispers, I see the hag in front of me. It's the first and only time I've been happy to see something so ugly drawing another bloody P on the left wall. I crossed the border line with no hesitation. 

Being out of the fog did nearly nothing to fix the damage it had done to my mind. Continuing my desperate sprint down the halls my shadow looked lighter than before but it still stood in contrast to the creatures that now dotted different halls and areas I passed by. They all bore a great resemblance to a regular person unlike the things following me. These things had fully regular human bodies, their eyes sown open as they dead sprinted down halls never stopping for a moment. The ones that passed by me seemed to have only supplied the creatures following me with more skin and faces to work with. They ran and ran and so did I. My brain could only handle focusing on one thing, the stench. It stinks of rot and body odor mixed with salt, with every breath came a subsequent gag. The sounds of the running steps echoed all around me and mixed with the scuttling of the creatures behind me. For but a moment the echoing lullaby that led me into that first hall rings through the halls. Granting my mind a short reprieve from reality as the tonal rhythm rung through my mind erasing all my senses before dunking it back into the cold stenchfull nightmare. I had to keep running, no matter how tired I was I couldn't stop. A wave of relief flowed through my legs as a portion of the tiredness fled my body, as I passed another hag tracing another bloody P on another wall and I crossed another boundary. 

The material makeup of the walls and floor seemed to change into a pasty tannish colored substance. It squished giving way as I stepped down onto the floor under me. Ahead of me lying embedded into the fleshy floor were mouths and eyes and noses, twitching and writhing they murmured of lost treasures and standings. They begged God to remember a promise never made. The things still scuttling behind me had amassed piles of pieces of skin that they carried on their backs. As they tore more pieces off the floor and walls, stripping away whatever these formless faces might have had left. The mouths on the floors and walls screamed in agony filling my mind at the same time that the scent of their mangled flesh and blood hit my senses like a truck. The whole hall shook like an earthquake as the gargled screams of one of the mouths formed into words ""Your own Virgil has led you down the mountain!"". Another question for if I ever got out of that place and another haunting memory for my collapsing mind. Just keep turning left, Just keep turning left. Repeated in my mind consuming all my thoughts but one, “I can't remember how I got here”. I saw the hag as always crouched by the left wall before another boundary. I gained no sense of relief from knowing I'm moving forward but all I knew was I needed to keep going. The scent of a pigsty and animal hair slammed into me as I crossed the boundary line. 

The walls are no longer made of flesh here. I ran past Hogs with sagging and bulbous fleshy bodies, the nape of their neck bore a red fruit. One of the hogs uselessly struggled to try and fail at eating the fruit that grew from its own neck and head. As another ran into it tearing the fruit and flesh from the nape of the hogs neck and greedily devoured the blood and flesh covered fruits. The creatures behind me took the fruits off the dead hogs they killed and ate them as I passed by more and more hoards of hogs. The creatures bit into the fruits and for a moment they spoke the words. ""do not heed the beast, do not heed its call to the pit"" before returning to their usual posture and incessant tracking of me. I was starting to get tired of the cryptic language that place spoke. I don't understand anything about that place, all I knew was the path ahead of me. The tonal rhythmic echo reverberated its way through the walls and into me yet again it sounded now like a beckoning urging me forward, I thanked it for the extra strength. Before my mind returned to its hellish surroundings, sanity can't exist in that godless place. Only the recollection of a crouched hag and a fleshy border on the floor. 

      

The hall was flesh again and it reeked of rotting flesh and moldy ball sweat. The putrid smell infected my mind, placing another crack in whatever could've been left of my sanity. Whatever was left was crushed under foot as I passed by a decaying nut sack stuck to the wall turned half to black particles that released into the air. The stench of the rotting inner fluid leaking out poisoning the already abominable air. More and more line the walls and floor kept company by uteros and vaginas in varying states of decay into the black rot. Out of their openings in the fleshy walls and inside the exposed uterus dotting the walls alongside them, lay mangled skinless but living fetuses also with varying states of decay. The ones that popped out of the wall wandered around in their near blindness, parts of them falling off due to the mold that clung to their already rotting flesh. They squelched with every step and more as their pieces inevitably fell off before they died and piled up around me in little moldy pieces of exposed flesh. They coo-ed just like a child would before it learns to talk. My mind was frozen from the sights and wiped by the scents, my legs kept moving under me. My mind was blank but my body still understood one thing. Run. More vile than ever the hag crouched tracing her bloody P into a massive tit that hung from the left wall. The boundary ahead of me was a deep red flame cloaked in black smoke and dust from the rotting sexual organs and molding fetus creatures all around me. As I ran through it I felt every atom in my body being coated with its horrid stench bathed in its abomination. I was born again. On the other side lies an empty concrete hall that seemingly stretched on forever. The lights now embedded into the ceiling dotted the darkened hall with spots of light no more turning left. Two men in prison guard uniforms approached me, they looked normal. I call out to them. ""H-hello! Where the hell am I? Please tell me how I got here!"" They approached me with closed eyes and calm hardened expressions. In one quick motion the guard on the left struck the side of my head. As my vision faded to black for my last moment of sanity all I could hear was the sound of handcuffs being placed over my wrists before they closed shut.",1,1766024678.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False

Immediately afterwards, I was pretty sore and very tingly for the first few hours, but it wasn't ever unbearable or anything. It was very difficult to pick up my phone and coffee at first but I managed pretty painlessly, especially after the first two hours. From the time they started my anesthesia to when they discharged me took about an hour.

For the first almost week, my husband had to do pretty much everything for me, in terms of cooking meals and fixing snacks, scooping litter boxes, taking the dog out, etc. My surgery was on a Friday so we had the weekend together, and before surgery I prepped for him to go back to work. I pre-sliced homemade bagels, prepped beef stew and rice that I froze in individual servings, and I froze a protein smoothie into popsicles. All good choices.

So in the mornings before hubby went to work, I would have him toast my bagel and spread stuff on it for me, and then heating up my own lunch in the microwave was pretty easy. He filled my big water bottles before leaving for work, which I absolutely needed help with, and I had him crack open a protein shake for me and put it in the fridge before he left. Preparing yourself to be able to eat and snack is crucial, especially because you'll be bored out of your mind and snacks are a must lol.

We purchased a bidet because I was told wiping would be impossible, and I'm not kidding when I say that was the best advice I got about this whole thing. Wiping has been IMPOSSIBLE and the bidet was a $25 freaking life saver. I'm also happy I purchased a nightgown, as I was warned that getting pants up and down would be a huge bitch.

The first night after surgery, I woke up about a million times in pain - that classic carpal tunnel pain that wakes you up at night, times 20. After the first night, absolutely zero pain at night/no sleep disturbances from my hands whatsoever.

About 4 days post op I could comfortably take the dog outside on my own. 5 or 6 days post op I could hold a book (my Kindle would have been sooner just a friend has it rn) which was great after a week of movies and scrolling. 7 or 8 days post op I felt comfortable warming food on the stove rather than the microwave. 10 days post op I started being able to wash a few dishes here and there, and could put on makeup with no problem (work party). 12 days post op I can kinda sorta wipe but I have my bidet now so I'm not super worried about it lol. Twisting motions like opening jars, and pulling motions are the only things that still trigger any feelings of soreness. So opening doors is a bitch.

I got stitches out at 7 days, and was given some putty to squeeze on to exercise my hands. I alternate between that and my knee-dough when I'm watching TV/idling. I was told that at 3 weeks I can start lifting more than 3-5 pounds and live totally normally again.

So yeah, buy a bidet, have your nightgowns ready, and prep some food. Make sure your meds are open/easily accessible because those pill bottles don't play. Ice packs are good to have in the freezer if you feel sore, especially the first week. Have your laundry all clean and put away before surgery so you can easily access underwear, more nightgowns, all that. Get a list of shows and movies to watch and maybe sign up for some free trials of streaming services for the first two weeks after surgery. And relax - it's a simple procedure and you'll have lots of time to relax afterwards, so lean into that rest period. Go on lots of walks to get sunshine and movement between all that binge-watching Netflix and inside time you'll have. Happy healing!",2,1766024497.0,carpaltunnel,0,1.0,False

I was with some friends when it happened, and we were sitting around the loungeroom when the first posts asking what the sound was and videos started showing up on people's socials, then one friend was furiously trying to find it on the news but couldn't. And by the time the news started reporting, we all went home. Everyone seems angry and sad, but mostly compartmentalised. 

I just feel so shaken by it. This never happens here. I can't help looking at that beach and thinking about how I bought coffee from that coffee shop over there, I tripped up those stairs, I bought a shirt from that store there, and how the people working there must be feeling. Who was too scared to go to work the next day? Who thought it might be their last day on earth? What people must have been thinking running from the shots. And I get so overwhelmed with emotion seeing that video of Jess comforting that little girl she didn't know, and all the stories of the people who comforted and shielded stranger's children, or who ran in trying to get people out. And the elderly couple who tried to fight them getting out of the car, and Ahmed and Reuven trying to fight him off.

I don't know it's just so upsetting but also overwhelming? I don't know how to explain how I feel about finding out how much good comes out of people in crisis, how kind people are and how much people will drop all sense of self preservation to try to help people.

 I talked to my mum about it, and her and her friends were just parroting a lot of Pauline's gibberish, but everyone is under the impression I'm still sad because I'm scared I'll be hurt or I can only be worried if I'm directly involved? They just keep saying ""well, don't be sad. You're safe. You didn't get hurt."" And I'm like but that's not the point?

Others did, and so many people were ready to lay down their life to protect each other and it's so overwhelming and I feel helpless? I just want to hug everyone and thank everyone for their bravery, but there's so little I can do.

Is this normal? Am I normal? I feel like I'm strange, like maybe no one else feels this and most people just put it in some ""oh, that's sad."" box and move on, or they only feel affected by it as far as it actually affects them and threatens their personal safety. I just feel like I need time to grieve these people I never knew, and take time to personally reflect on the people who sacrificed themselves for others, whether they died doing so or not. But I don't know if anyone else feels like this? I don't understand why this is affecting me so much ... Is anyone else like this?",5,1766024184.0,TooAfraidToAsk,3,0.78,False

**Fan:** Yeah. Short version? You took my boys. And what about Baby? Nobody puts Baby in a corner. Long version? This is a personal betrayal.

**Retention Rep:** I’m sorry… when you say your boys and a baby, are you referring to a profile issue or parental controls?

**Fan:** No. Supernatural. Sam. Dean. The Impala. The fact that I have to explain this is already painful.

**Retention Rep:** Okay, thank you for clarifying. That series did leave our catalog due to licensing changes.

**Fan:** Fifteen seasons. Blood, ghosts, demons, bad choices, classic rock. You don’t just rip that out of a woman’s comfort rotation and expect her to be okay.

**Retention Rep:** I understand it can be frustrating when a favorite show leaves the service.

**Fan:** Frustrating is when your coffee’s cold. This is emotional damage.

**Retention Rep:** We do still offer a wide selection of other long-running shows.

**Fan:** Don’t. Do not. This is like telling me I can replace the Impala with a crossover SUV. Hard no.

**Retention Rep:** We could offer you a discounted rate if you’d like to stay.

**Fan:** Listen a$$butt, I lost my shoe. That’s my emotional state right now. A discount is not going to fix that.

**Retention Rep:** Is there anything we could do that would change your mind today?

**Fan:** Unless you can resurrect fifteen seasons with duct tape, classic rock, and pure spite, no. I’ve got demons to kill, hellhounds to banish, and a subscription to cancel.

**Retention Rep:** You’re clearly very attached to this series.

**Fan:** Family don’t end in blood. But apparently streaming contracts do, and that’s where we’re at.

I got fired from my job, then my landlord evicted me because I couldn't pay rent for the past two months. I just finished packing all my belongings into my car when my phone started to buzz. I grabbed it out of my pocket to see my friend Colby was calling me. He must've seen the rant I put all over social media. I casually answered ""Yo, whatsup?"" as I attempted to not sound bitter. ""I heard about your situation. I wanted to say you can stay at my place. I'll be on vacation this week, but you can make yourself at home there while I'm out of town."" He explained seemingly in a rush to spit out the words. ""Awesome! Thanks so much bro, I'll head over there in a minute then."" I said with a sigh of relief. ""Also sometimes the power to the main floor will go out and you can find the electrical box in the basement. Just flip the breaker and it should come back on."" He continued ""anyway I'm on the road right now I'll talk to you later man"" his voice followed by a monotone beep. 

I got into my car and decided I should head to Colby's house so that I can unpack and try to relax after all the stress I had been through lately. I started up the engine and backed out into the road. As I made my way down the road, I thought to myself ""Colby's house should only be a few minutes away."" However, traffic was terrible and nearly doubled the amount of time it should have taken me to get there. Finally as I pulled into his driveway, I felt some relief as I parked my car and got out with a few bags. As I opened the door, my mind goes to memories of the near past. Of college parties and get-togethers things that I found myself longing for again. Closing the door behind me I placed my bags down and started to unpack my chargers and my laptop. I set up everything on a coffee table in the living room at the time. As I sat down to boot up my laptop, I saw the TV mounted on the wall across from me. I got up and started digging the HDMI cord out of my bag, because what's better than watching DBZ on my computer? That's right, watching DBZ on my friend's flatscreen. After I got all that set up I grabbed a quick snack and started watching. I resumed from where I left off. Episode 205, it opens to Sayaiman protecting some civilians from giant flying dinosaurs along with a scene of Videl confronting Gohan about his secret identity. It flashed to the title page saying ""I'll fight too!"" on it. That's when the lights flickered and then went out. Only then had it occurred to me that I'd never actually been in the basement at Colby's place.   
  
  
  
I paused the episode and decided that it's time I found the electrical box in the basement. I stood up and made my way to the kitchen. On the back wall there is a door opening to a set of stairs which leads into the basement. I shined my phone flashlight into the dark room and quickly found the electrical box stuck to the back wall on the left of the basement. I looked around with my phone and stood there a moment confused. There's a wooden door plastered on the concrete wall across from the electrical box. By the looks of it, it surely didn't lead anywhere. I walked up to it to take a closer look. Despite where I found it, the door seemed quite normal. As I opened it I found a long hallway. Above me were shaded lights that hung from the tall ceiling and spread a low yellow light into the dry dusty hall. The air felt like sand on my skin, a rhythmic echo reverberated through the hall that had slammed into my ears like a wave. It washed away all my pre-conceived notions of my life, all that existed was the desert like hall and my stupified expression. Just as the hall had overtaken all of my vision I snapped back to remembering why I came down here. My whole life flooded back to me like a broken dam. I whipped around expecting to see the basement, yet all that lay before me was more hall. The echoed tune returned in waves, as it waxed and waned.   
  
  
  
I used all the strength I had left in me against the lull of the rhythmic tone. I urged my muscles to bend to my will as I ran. I was slow and sluggish at first but got used to it. As I was running and running all I could make out was the dusty scent around me and my footsteps under me, yet as I listened my footsteps seemed to double. While I looked behind me I saw a hulking man, he carried a boulder in his arms. He strutted at me slowly with a wide proud smile. I continued to run but it didn’t seem to serve to separate us much, he stood atop no shadow while mine danced behind me. As I ran down the hall another hall appeared out of one of the wall segments, in a quick decision I took off down the side hall. I can still hear that things steps thudding behind me.  Turn after turn the hulking creatures' steps remained consistent behind me. I've heard that in a maze you should follow the left wall so that's what I did.   
  
  
  
Up ahead I could see a boundary separating the part of the hall I was in and one in which the lights are dimmed and the wall and floors a darker color. Just before the boundary line a small, bald and saggy fleshed hag with marbled eyes is crouched facing the left wall. It traces its fleshy stub of a finger across a bloodstained P on the wall mumbling, all I could make out were the words. ""The mount under virtuous stars”. Just like the hulking man behind me the ground under this hag was missing its shadow. As I crossed the border line I looked back to see the hulking man's smile somehow grow wider, impossibly wide. The moment he stepped over the boundary the boulder dropped from his hands shaking the ground. In one awful split second he lunged, faster than before he bound down the darkened hall slowly gaining on me. I took another left turn, looking back as soon as the hulking man turned the corner behind me. Two creatures jump upon the hulking man similar in shape to the hags, but their skin is missing leaving large spaces on the surface of their bodies as exposed flesh. Patches of skin and features dot their bodies seemingly slapped on in a stable but mangled manner. Overtop their faces one wears a mask made from the skin of a woman's face their eye holes sown shut with copper wire. The other bore a skinless and bleeding face bearing the same copper wire holding its eyes firmly shut. Just as the first fleshy hand wetly made contact with the man the two creatures proceeded to tear the skin off the man and slap the skin onto their own bodies. The one without a face mask slaps the man's prideful smile onto its own previously exposed face. I continued to run as fast as I could down the halls, left turn after left turn. A small scuttling noise followed quietly behind me. The two creatures from before leap from shadow to shadow in the light they lack their own. They slowly trace my path behind me like how a wolf hunts a deer. Keeping my eyes in front of me, left turn on left turn I noticed something repeating on the ground written in dried blood stains were the repeated words ""Turn away from your desire"". The words only served to add an extra layer of confusion to all of this on top of the nauseating state of my mind. Up the hall crouched down by the left wall just before a wall of blackish ash-like fog sits another hag tracing another P onto the wall. It seems that the other creatures in this fucked up complex pay no heed to the sagging hags.   
  
  
  
As I crossed the boundary the fog carried the stench of iron mixed with dry ash. I could only see a matter of feet in front of me but I couldn't stop running. I stuck my hand out to the left wall and continued to run down the left halls. I could still hear their scuttling behind me, but now they carried on with frustrated grunt-like noises. Their grunts mix in with murmurs that seep through the foggy walls words like, ""The lamb of god, the bloodied sacrifice"" lined behind the growing noises of angry grunts and sobs followed by flesh tearing like fabric. As the hopelessness of my situation set into me, I pushed it out of my mind. I had no way of knowing how or why this had happened and I could feel my memory slowly vacating my mind. I decided that in my current state the best  thing I could do is keep turning left so that's what I did. I didn’t know if it would lead me out but anywhere would’ve been better. Just as I could feel my mind giving way to the horrible groaning and sobbing whispers, I see the hag in front of me. It's the first and only time I've been happy to see something so ugly drawing another bloody P on the left wall. I crossed the border line with no hesitation.   
  
  
  
Being out of the fog did nearly nothing to fix the damage it had done to my mind. Continuing my desperate sprint down the halls my shadow looked lighter than before but it still stood in contrast to the creatures that now dotted different halls and areas I passed by. They all bore a great resemblance to a regular person unlike the things following me. These things had fully regular human bodies, their eyes sown open as they dead sprinted down halls never stopping for a moment. The ones that passed by me seemed to have only supplied the creatures following me with more skin and faces to work with. They ran and ran and so did I. My brain could only handle focusing on one thing, the stench. It stinks of rot and body odor mixed with salt, with every breath came a subsequent gag. The sounds of the running steps echoed all around me and mixed with the scuttling of the creatures behind me. For but a moment the echoing lullaby that led me into that first hall rings through the halls. Granting my mind a short reprieve from reality as the tonal rhythm rung through my mind erasing all my senses before dunking it back into the cold stenchfull nightmare. I had to keep running, no matter how tired I was I couldn't stop. A wave of relief flowed through my legs as a portion of the tiredness fled my body, as I passed another hag tracing another bloody P on another wall and I crossed another boundary.   
  
  
  
The material makeup of the walls and floor seemed to change into a pasty tannish colored substance. It squished giving way as I stepped down onto the floor under me. Ahead of me lying embedded into the fleshy floor were mouths and eyes and noses, twitching and writhing they murmured of lost treasures and standings. They begged God to remember a promise never made. The things still scuttling behind me had amassed piles of pieces of skin that they carried on their backs. As they tore more pieces off the floor and walls, stripping away whatever these formless faces might have had left. The mouths on the floors and walls screamed in agony filling my mind at the same time that the scent of their mangled flesh and blood hit my senses like a truck. The whole hall shook like an earthquake as the gargled screams of one of the mouths formed into words ""Your own Virgil has led you down the mountain!"". Another question for if I ever got out of that place and another haunting memory for my collapsing mind. Just keep turning left, Just keep turning left. Repeated in my mind consuming all my thoughts but one, “I can't remember how I got here”. I saw the hag as always crouched by the left wall before another boundary. I gained no sense of relief from knowing I'm moving forward but all I knew was I needed to keep going. The scent of a pigsty and animal hair slammed into me as I crossed the boundary line.   
  
  
  
The walls are no longer made of flesh here. I ran past Hogs with sagging and bulbous fleshy bodies, the nape of their neck bore a red fruit. One of the hogs uselessly struggled to try and fail at eating the fruit that grew from its own neck and head. As another ran into it tearing the fruit and flesh from the nape of the hogs neck and greedily devoured the blood and flesh covered fruits. The creatures behind me took the fruits off the dead hogs they killed and ate them as I passed by more and more hoards of hogs. The creatures bit into the fruits and for a moment they spoke the words. ""do not heed the beast, do not heed its call to the pit"" before returning to their usual posture and incessant tracking of me. I was starting to get tired of the cryptic language that place spoke. I don't understand anything about that place, all I knew was the path ahead of me. The tonal rhythmic echo reverberated its way through the walls and into me yet again it sounded now like a beckoning urging me forward, I thanked it for the extra strength. Before my mind returned to its hellish surroundings, sanity can't exist in that godless place. Only the recollection of a crouched hag and a fleshy border on the floor. 

      

The hall was flesh again and it reeked of rotting flesh and moldy ball sweat. The putrid smell infected my mind, placing another crack in whatever could've been left of my sanity. Whatever was left was crushed under foot as I passed by a decaying nut sack stuck to the wall turned half to black particles that released into the air. The stench of the rotting inner fluid leaking out poisoning the already abominable air. More and more line the walls and floor kept company by uteros and vaginas in varying states of decay into the black rot. Out of their openings in the fleshy walls and inside the exposed uterus dotting the walls alongside them, lay mangled skinless but living fetuses also with varying states of decay. The ones that popped out of the wall wandered around in their near blindness, parts of them falling off due to the mold that clung to their already rotting flesh. They squelched with every step and more as their pieces inevitably fell off before they died and piled up around me in little moldy pieces of exposed flesh. They coo-ed just like a child would before it learns to talk. My mind was frozen from the sights and wiped by the scents, my legs kept moving under me. My mind was blank but my body still understood one thing. Run. More vile than ever the hag crouched tracing her bloody P into a massive tit that hung from the left wall. The boundary ahead of me was a deep red flame cloaked in black smoke and dust from the rotting sexual organs and molding fetus creatures all around me. As I ran through it I felt every atom in my body being coated with its horrid stench bathed in its abomination. I was born again. On the other side lies an empty concrete hall that seemingly stretched on forever. The lights now embedded into the ceiling dotted the darkened hall with spots of light no more turning left. Two men in prison guard uniforms approached me, they looked normal. I call out to them. ""H-hello! Where the hell am I? Please tell me how I got here!"" They approached me with closed eyes and calm hardened expressions. In one quick motion the guard on the left struck the side of my head. As my vision faded to black for my last moment of sanity all I could hear was the sound of handcuffs being placed over my wrists before they closed shut.",1,1766024053.0,u_crobbonk,0,1.0,False

My doctor recently took away my hydrocodone for break through pain and left me with buprenorphine alone for extended release. I'm still in incredible pain and now I'm super pissed. I wrote a letter to my DR which she refused to read during the appt. 

COULD YOU PLEASE REVIEW IT & PROVIDE FEEDBACK PLEASE!?!?! Be as critical as you need to be. 

""Dear Dr.,
I’ve been feeling incredibly anxious and abandoned after our last meeting and changing the plan to treat my pain, and I’m beginning to feel frustrated. I don’t want to feel this way because I know you are doing your best to help me. I think, perhaps, our last appointment didn’t go so well because of a few things I said combined with you having an inadequate client profile, so I wanted to help you get to know me better.

I would like to start out by saying that education has always been important to me, which is probably why I went to cosmetology school before getting my BA and eventually two MAs, including a Masters Degree in psychology. I’ve always been interested in psychology because I come from a traumatic background (I now have PTSD) and wanted to figure out not only why I do the things I do, but also why others do what they do. I also have a long history in the realm of medicine and have a fair knowledge of medicines, brain functions and anatomy.

I also want you to know that pain is something I’ve lived with for almost my whole life. I was 15 when I discovered I couldn’t sweep the floor without needing to take a break to sit down since my low back hurt so much. I was 17 when I had breast reduction surgery, but it didn’t do much to help with the low back pain. While preparing for that surgery, a 2004 x-ray showed lumbosacral transitional vertebra (LSTV). The findings showed “there is partial lumbarization of S1 with a false joint with some sclerosis noted between the transverse process of S1 and S2 on the right. Spina bifida occulta is noted at the S1 level” (Radiology Report). I’ve been told that my LSTV shouldn’t cause pain, but I’m pretty sure this is where my low back pain originates. “LSTV has been reported to alter the biomechanics of the lumbar spine and contribute to low back pain.” (3)

Now, I suffer from high impact chronic intractable pain, which generally presents as concurrent nociceptive, neuropathic and nociplastic pain, meaning my daily experience with pain is always unique (see Table 1). However, the chronic pain I feel always worsens as the day progresses, which I understand is typical of osteoarthritis. The weather changes my pain as well, increasing pain levels when it rains or snows, or when the temperature changes drastically. Being too warm or too cold will trigger a multiple sclerosis flare of past pain symptoms. Occasionally I even have days where my joints subluxate, usually my knees, hips or fingers—what triggers it is still a mystery to me (I’m thinking its spondyloarthritis). I have a variety of other pain symptoms that pop up as well, which makes having medication on hand a preference of mine. I usually only visit the ER if my pain is not able to be treated with the medication I have at home or if the symptoms last for a long period of time, especially because I am on multiple immune suppressants and get sick very easily.  

I understand the instinct to protect your position as a medical professional (as you should), as well as the way prescribing pain medication has changed since the opioid crisis, but chronic pain patients are at a very low risk for opioid addiction.

*“An estimated 3-12% of people treated with opioids for chronic pain will develop an addiction or abuse with negative consequences.” (1)

*“A systematic review reports…that only 8% to 12% [of chronic pain patients] develop an opioid use disorder.” (2)

I am often thankful that I don’t suffer from addictive behavior. Since being diagnosed with diabetes, I quit drinking soda and limit my coffee intake to one cup a day, essentially quitting caffeine. I have also quit drinking alcohol, which I used to use for pain relief, since pain medication is much preferred. At my neurologists suggestion, I take one day a week as a break from Adderall, and I think it would be easy to stop taking it all together, hut I would only he awake a few hours a day due to my narcolepsy and would never get anything done. The only vice I seem to have left is smoking cigarettes, which I truly believe is more of a behavioral addiction than a nicotine addiction. 

I am technically at higher risk of committing suicide than becoming addicted to pain medication. “8.8% of deaths by suicide can be attributed to chronic pain.” (5) “People with MS may be twice as likely to die by suicide as people in the larger population.” (6) ""Pain management programs may reduce suicide risk in patients with chronic pain.” (4) However, I am suicide resilient. I am a QPR trained Suicide Gatekeeper, which the Surgeon General’s National Strategy for Suicide Prevention (2001) defines as “someone in a position to recognize a crisis and the warning signs that someone may be contemplating suicide.” (8)

I believe my outlook for my future health is realistic. I have many activities that I regularly participate in to try to reduce my pain (see Table 2). I need to adhere to dosage limits for NSAIDs and Tylenol, as I will be using these medications daily for the rest of my life and don’t want to destroy my insides. The chronic health conditions I have are incurable, so I can only strive to effectively manage them. The many types of arthritis I’ve acquired are degenerative and will continue to get worse over time (I’d put money on rheumatoid arthritis in my future). Due to my diabetes, I will have to be cognizant of what I eat and make sure my blood sugars are in an appropriate range. I will never have a pain free day in my life again—but there are medications that were made specifically to reduce pain for chronic pain sufferers like me.

I am not opioid naive. I have been prescribed opioids by doctors and dentists sporadically as early as my teenage years. This is my third pain contract (technically 4th if you count Allina separately). Both times my previous pain contracts ended, I quit opioids without difficulty despite physical dependence. One of those contracts was with my current General Practitioner Allison McVay-Steer, who I encourage you to reach out to if you want more information.

All of the doctors before Allison were ageist, assuming I was too young to be in serious pain. Nobody thought I had an autoimmune disorder. Even after being diagnosed with MS, I continue to struggle to find appropriate treatment for more than one medical problem. I see dozens of doctors and a plethora of specialists, but all of them have left me undertreated. I don’t have big dreams anymore, but one dream I do have is to be able to go back to work part time. I have multiple degrees gathering dust on the walls and after 5 years of unemployment I’m bored and unfulfilled. Further, the amount of money I make on disability only increases if I increase my lifetime wage earnings and being poor really sucks.

I truly do believe that you are a good doctor with knowledgeable experience, which is why I have done everything that you have asked me to. I just finished swim therapy in October and I loved it. I was told I became stronger and more coordinated after our time. If there’s a way to get insurance to continue to cover this, I would definitely continue to go. I love swimming!

When you first suggested botox for my headaches, I was still in denial of my migraines but botox worked beautifully. I just had my consult with Fairview neurology last week, so hopefully I will be able to continue that treatment soon. My meralgia paresthetica was a numb, loss of feeling sensation for years until one day a burning pain started screaming through my skin, but you knew right away what kind of pain I was describing and prescribed gabapentin. The proof is in the pudding—you have definitely provided treatment options that have been successful in reducing my pain, but I am still in severe chronic pain.

I have pain everyday at varying pain levels and for numerous reasons, which is why I need both extended release pain coverage and instant release medication for breakthrough pain. The damage to my body, as evidenced by my MRIs, and the long list of diagnoses I have are proof that I should be prescribed a class of drugs made for chronic and severe pain, not a class of drugs that is made for those with opioid use disorder, because I am in chronic severe pain and I do not and have not ever suffered from opioid use disorder or any other substance abuse disorder.

My last two pain contracts were for oxycontin and oxycodone. Both of those medications worked well for me, as they provided appropriate coverage of my pain and don’t seem to cause any side effects. ”OXYCONTIN is…indicated for the management of severe and persistent pain that requires an extended treatment period with a daily opioid analgesic” (7)

I would like to switch from Gabapentin to Lyrica, because lyrica is FDA approved to treat fibromyalgia. However, I would not like to take large doses of either lyrica or gabapentin, since both drugs show evidence that they halt the formation of new brain synapses and increase the risk of dementia. I would also like to try Tonmya for fibromyalgia pain, as this drug was also recently FDA approved for that.

Spinal decompression therapy and swim therapy are incredibly helpful treatments as well, but I don’t have the money to pay for them out of pocket. I’m also willing to discuss other alternative therapies or surgical procedure that might be helpful. I’ve recently been looking into cervical facet radiofrequency, percutaneous disc nucleoplasty, intradiscal electrothermal therapy, and racz caudal neurolysis.

I believe additional medical testing would be helpful. Imaging of spinal damage, including specifically my LSTV, L5 to S2, should be done using a SPECT/CT scans or a Ferguson radiograph x-ray. Perhaps blood tests would provide useful information as well if we look at cytokines, ferritin, HSCRP, and homocysteine.

Lastly, I think I’m overdue for someone to poke my head with needles. Am I going to continue getting injections (such as trigger points) with you, or is that something that should be done at Fairview alongside my botox injections? I am willing to sign any forms you would like for a release of information from Fairview. I have also consulted with a member of the National Pain Council, and have a couple materials from this organization that I would like for you to read.

I want to thank you for taking the time to read this letter. I hope my blunt and transparent tone wasn’t too off-putting  I truly do believe that you are a great doctor and hope we can continue working together to alleviate my pain.

Sincerely,
Liz

A mutual friend of both of ours asked me how it went, and I gave her the honest truth of all of the things that went wrong. She asked me if I thought that Janice was a covert narcissist and I really don’t know? 

Some examples of things that went wrong:

\- I ordered coffee with milk and sugar and Janice asked me about it, and I told her I don’t like the taste but need the caffeine and her response was well I like it black, like you’re supposed to drink it; 

\- when we tried to plan our days Janice asked if we could come back to the hotel and nap, I asked her if she could do that without me because I had less time on the trip than her and I can’t sleep during the day as it is and wouldn’t need a nap, the next day when I expressed being tired she said “well look at little miss doesn’t need a nap now”

\- when I mentioned I needed to get a birthday gift for my friend “Chloe” and I listed the things “Chloe” liked, after every single thing she kept saying “oh me too” like I was also supposed to get her a gift 

\-when we were walking through Kensington park, she had her own map up while we were walking even though I was navigating and decided that my route was having us go to the wrong place and then said “well let’s see who gets there first” and when I did she accused me of running (which I saw her do but I did not do) and then said well we’re both stubborn, I wasn’t stubborn, I just knew I was right because it was a straight line instead of an L shaped walking distance

\- after the first few uncomfortable instances noticed at some point when I stopped speaking she started staring at me intensely. And then would sway and hum to herself, she made me feel like I was the one being weird the entire time and would tell me that I was hurting her with the silent treatment. 

Does any of this sound like narcissism? If so, what other signs should I have been aware of? ",2,1766023646.0,narcissism,1,1.0,False

I know for a fact that she likes Juliette, Very Good Girl Elixir (she likes all of them, has Good Girl & Very Good Girl) & 7 Virtues Cherry Ambition.

Hi, I’m a 24-year-old technical engineer based in Hyderabad. I’m looking for genuine connections—whether that’s dating with intent, meaningful friendship, or building an emotional bond that could grow long-term.

Friends describe me as egoistic, emotional, adventurous, spontaneous, calm, and sometimes loud. I enjoy a balance of playful banter, deep conversations, support, care, and shared adventures. Life feels best when it’s a mix of laughter, excitement, comfort, and meaningful presence.

Some things I genuinely enjoy: exploring Hyderabad on bike rides, train or bus journeys (even better with company), Telugu and Hindi music, recently exploring rock, podcasts, food, black coffee, technology, and just having simple moments or shared silences that feel close.

I’m looking for a woman who’s caring, loyal, playful, affectionate, and emotionally aware. Deal-breakers for me include dishonesty, lack of loyalty, emotional coldness, disrespect, inconsistency, and manipulation.

If you enjoy laughter and mischief, meaningful conversations, quiet moments that feel connected, and small adventures around the city, I’d love to hear from you. Let’s connect with intention and see where it goes 🌱",1,1766023368.0,Hyd_DaTinG,0,1.0,False

1ppepe8,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_OkClassic1728/comments/1ppepe8/open_for_revision/,Open for revision,"Jonas had never believed in fate, at least not until the day he met Lucy. They had collided in a bookstore, the kind of clumsy accident where books tumbled to the floor and their eyes met for the first time. She had smiled, an easy, unguarded smile, and helped him pick up the scattered paperbacks. There was something warm and magnetic about her, something he hadn’t expected to find on a gray afternoon in a quiet corner of the city.

At first, it felt like any other casual meeting, a few exchanged words, maybe a laugh. But their connection grew quickly. They spent hours together—wandering through bookstores, sitting at coffee shops, walking aimlessly through parks. They shared music, books, stories, and little moments that made life feel richer. Jonas had never been the kind of person who could open up easily, but with Lucy, it was different. She listened like she understood, like she saw parts of him he didn’t know how to explain.

But somewhere in all those moments, something dark crept in. Jonas had a part of himself that was broken. He didn’t always understand it, but it was there—a weight he carried, something inside him that was heavy and hard to shake. When things were good, he felt light, free. But when things weren’t, he spiraled. And in those moments, it wasn’t just his own life that he hurt.

Lucy began to notice the cracks. She noticed the times Jonas would pull away, go quiet, get angry over small things. She noticed his eyes darken and his hands tremble in ways she hadn’t seen before. She didn’t know how to help, but she kept trying—always trying to fix things, always trying to keep him from slipping further away. And when Jonas couldn’t keep it together anymore, he lashed out in ways he never should have. He pushed Lucy away, not physically, but with words that cut deeper than he ever intended. His anger, his sadness, everything he couldn’t handle, poured out in ways that scared them both.

One night, after one of those moments, Jonas sat in the cold, staring out at the city, feeling his chest tighten with the weight of everything he had done. Lucy was gone, and the silence was deafening. He wanted to apologize, to explain, to do something—anything—but he didn’t know how. The guilt burned through him, but he knew it was no excuse. He couldn’t take back what he had said. He couldn’t erase the way he had hurt her.

He had to seek help. He knew that. But even as he made that decision, he didn’t know how to help Lucy. What if she couldn’t forgive him? What if she didn’t believe he was capable of changing? He thought about her smile, the way she had looked at him when they first met, and the way her eyes had dimmed over time.

Jonas didn’t expect forgiveness. Not yet, not ever, if that’s what she chose. But he wanted her to know, wherever she was, that he saw the damage he had caused, that he recognized the hurt he had put her through, and that he was sorry. So sorry. He would never be able to undo the harm he had done, but he was trying to make it right. He was seeking help because he didn’t want to live in the dark anymore.

But what he needed most of all, was to know if Lucy was okay. If she could find peace, if she was healing, if she was going to be all right without him. Because in the end, that’s what mattered—her. Not his mistakes, not the broken parts of him, but her.

He didn’t know if he could help her now. But he wanted to. He wanted to make up for everything he had done, even if it meant standing in the dark, waiting for her to find the light again",1,1766022800.0,u_OkClassic1728,0,1.0,False

One of my relatives asked me for a bag of medium roast coffee from Burlington for Christmas! The only problem is I have 0 caffeine tolerance... so I have no idea what cafes around here sell their own beans or who around here makes good coffee 💀 if anyone has recommendations for where I could buy a nice bag of medium roast coffee for her in Burlington (or not too far away) feel free to share!

Read this, before you raise your hand, to be better prepared.","***TLDR: Auctions reward preparation, not confidence on the day. Know the property’s real value, pressure-test your borrowing with your broker, understand the contract and auction rules, set a walk-away price you won’t cross, and be ready for both auction day and a post-auction negotiation. The work you do before the auction matters far more than what happens in the last five minutes.***

Auctions can feel intimidating, especially if it’s your first time. Fast pace, public bidding, no cooling-off, and a lot of pressure in the moment. The good news is this. The people who do well at auction usually win or walk away calmly because they’ve already done the hard thinking beforehand.

Here’s how to prepare properly so you’re not making emotional decisions on the footpath.

**Start with the boring stuff. It matters a LOT.**

Before you even think about bidding, make sure the basics are rock solid.

* Get the contract reviewed early. Send the contract to your lawyer or conveyancer well before auction day. Don’t skim it yourself and assume it’s fine. You want them checking for red flags, unusual conditions, settlement terms, penalties, and anything that could bite later.
* If the property has strata or body corporate, make sure that’s reviewed too. Levies, sinking funds, upcoming works and disputes all matter to you and to the bank.
* Do lender-friendly property checks. Not every property is treated the same by banks. Some features can impact valuation or how much a lender is willing to lend. Things to be cautious of include: Apartments under 50sqm, Land sizes over 2 hectares, Non-standard titles or unusual zoning, Very remote locations, Dual-use properties or odd inclusions, Homes needing major structural repair. None of these are automatic deal breakers, but they need to be understood upfront so there are no surprises after the hammer falls.

**Understand what the property is actually worth.**

This is where people get caught out on the day, if they get swept up in the emotion.

* Look at recent settled sales, not just asking prices. Focus on genuinely comparable properties in the same area that have sold recently. This gives you a realistic price range, not a hopeful one.
* If you’re working with a broker, you can ask them to run a valuation report or, in some cases, an upfront valuation with a lender. This won’t always be possible, but when it is, it can be incredibly useful for setting expectations.
* You want to walk into the auction knowing what the property is likely to be valued at by a bank, not just what the agent thinks it’s worth.

**Pressure-test your numbers with your broker, or bank.**

This step is hugely underrated. Loans are often structured based on 'LVR' and changes to price, or value, can influence whether you can afford the property or not. Don’t just ask “what’s my max borrowing?”. Ask your broker, or bank, to test a few scenarios:

* What happens if I buy at my target price?
* What if I stretch another $25k or $50k?
* What does my LVR look like at different price points?
* Am I still comfortable if rates move later?

Learn your theoretical maximum, but don’t treat it as a target. It’s a ceiling, not a goal.

**Set your “happy to walk away” price.**

This is one of the most important parts of auction prep, in my personal opinion. Decide your absolute limit before auction day - ***NOT ON THE DAY***. Not after you’ve had three coffees and the crowd is fired up. Decide it calmly, with logic, and stick to it.

Your walk-away price should factor in:

* What the property is realistically worth, in your opinion
* Your comfort with your repayments
* Your buffer for future rate changes
* The fact there will always be another property, at some point

Walking away is not failing. Overpaying because you got caught up often can be, or lead to buyers remorse.

**Do your building and pest checks.**

If you can, organise your own building and pest inspection before the auction. If not, ask the agent if the vendor has one available and read it carefully. Big issues don’t just affect your comfort. They affect valuation, insurability and sometimes lending altogether.

**Learn basic auction language before the day.**

You don’t need to be an expert, but you should know what’s being said. A few key terms:

* Reserve price: The minimum the vendor will accept
* On the market: The reserve has been met and the property will sell
* Registered bidder: You must be registered to bid
* Vendor bid (more of a thing in QLD than anywhere else): A bid made by the auctioneer on behalf of the seller, allowed by law and must be declared
* Passed in: The reserve hasn't been met, and the vendor will need to consider next steps (e.g. approaching the highest bidder on the day to negotiate a price)

Also understand that you must follow the auctioneer’s bid increments. If they’re calling for $10k rises, you can’t jump in with $2k. Increments usually shrink as the auction progresses and bidders drop off.

**Try to understand the vendor’s situation.**

Ask the agent questions. You won’t always get straight answers, but context helps.

* Is it an estate sale?
* Do they need a fast settlement?
* Are they testing the market or genuinely motivated to sell?

This can matter both on auction day and if the property is passed in.

**Be ready for a post-auction offer.**

If the property is passed in and doesn’t meet reserve, the highest bidder usually gets first right to negotiate.

Be prepared with:

* Your offer price
* Deposit amount
* Any conditions you want to include
* Settlement timeframe

This negotiation can sometimes be calmer and more logical than the auction itself, which is why preparation still pays off even if bidding stops.

**Insurance starts immediately (in QLD).**

If you buy at auction, the property is yours from that moment. Organise insurance so it can be activated straight away on the day.

\-------

Auctions aren’t about bravado or quick thinking. They’re about preparation, clarity, and discipline. If you’ve done the work beforehand, auction day becomes simple. You bid confidently up to your number, or you walk away knowing you made a smart call.

If this auction isn’t the one, there will be others. The goal isn’t just to buy a property. It’s to buy the right one, at the right price, without future regret.",4,1766022293.0,AskAnAussieBroker,0,0.84,False

So me and my bf has been dating for four months and it’s been going pretty smooth apart from one fight that we solved. 

It’s been pretty much just going better and better since we had that argument and we are developing as a couple, and I’m starting to really really like him a lot to the point I could envision something very long term with this guy. Possibly even children. Even though it’s crazy and somewhat far in the future. 

But, I’ve been feeling very conflicted about something. His female friend, I’ll call her ‘Homegirl’ cause that’s what he calls her.

They’ve been friends before we met, not that long, only five days. But they’re very close and he describes his relationship with her as ‘one of the friends he can be himself with’. Which I think it’s great. Sometimes I hang out with her too for coffee and she’s very sweet and friendly, but, she’s also very self destructive, anxious and needs approval of people (especially guys) which I believe comes from her lack of a healthy relationship so far. 

Either way they snap everyday, talk everyday or every other day, sometimes she’d call him and sometimes they hang out one and one. sure it’s not my business what they’re up to but it’s making me a bit uncomfortable. Especially today when I found out she’s been at the hospital but didn’t tell me, but my boyfriend and then ranted to him about her fear and her lack of eating, which my boyfriend happily wanted to help comfort her with.

She straight up stopped snapping me however almost a month ago, but never has stopped snapping him. She also claims whenever they’re together she tries to stay close to him, and she also says she adores him.

At the same time my boyfriend says he’d block her if she tried, while she says she’d never get with a taken guy, but I am still feeling very uncomfortable and confused.

1ppei21,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/1ppei21/caffeine_nicotine/,Caffeine & Nicotine,"Hello. I need help understanding something. I want to know how come people in AA, especially the old timers, have such a problem with pot or microdosing mushrooms because it's a drug and can alter mental states but technically so is caffeine and nicotine and it does alter your mental state (though to a way less degree) and is classified as a drug. 

If they're so hell-bent on that then it seems kind of hypocritical that they all drink coffee and smoke cigarettes. 

I'm not judging and I actually have no interest in smoking pot or taking mushrooms but I genuinely want to know why this is because it does seem kind of hypocritical and I just need to wrap my head around it so I don't hold a resentment towards the program. 

This is my fourth time trying AA in 3 years and I do believe in the program and it's been around way too long and has had too much of a success rate to deny its capabilities and I'm really trying to be as open-minded as possible but I'm also very literal so I'm having a hard time with this issue. Also having a hard time with the fact that it's a non-religious program and yet every meeting is pretty much closed with the Lord's prayer but that's a topic for another thread.

1ppehkz,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1ppehkz/what_remains_in_unit_1e/,‘What Remains In Unit 1E’,"“Consider an apartment door marked 1E.

Inside, a woman moves as if the walls are the only thing keeping her upright, quietly asking herself what she was just doing, and why the answer won’t come. A smell pulls her down the hall. A knock startles her like a gunshot. Familiar faces return like sunlight through a window and vanish the moment she reaches for them. The building offers no violence, no threat, only patience. Because in 1E, you don’t have to die to disappear.”

\-1E-

She wandered the hallway of her apartment with slow, uncertain steps, one hand trailing along the wall as if she needed it to stay upright. Her slippers whispered against the floor. She paused, frowned, then whispered to herself.

“I was…I was doing something…wasn’t I?”

The words sounded fragile once they left her mouth, like they might break if she tried to repeat them. She stood there, waiting for the answer to arrive.

It didn’t.

A faint scent brushed past her nose.

She turned her head slowly, sniffing the air. It was something familiar. Something important. She followed it into the kitchen, opening the fridge, then the sink cabinet, then the trash. She leaned closer, searching.

Nothing.

She closed the fridge, then opened it again. Checked the sink. The trash. The fridge again.

Still nothing.

Her brow creased. She stepped back, unsettled, when a knock at the door struck through the apartment.

She gasped and clutched her chest.

It took her a moment to remember where the door was.

When she opened it, a broad-shouldered, gentle-eyed man stood in the doorway, keys hanging from his belt.

“Oh, sweetheart,” she said, relief flooding her voice. “You came home so fast.”

He blinked, then smiled, careful and kind.

“It’s just me, ma’am. The super.”

Confusion flickered across her face, passing quickly, like a cloud over glass.

“Oh. Yes. Of course.” She laughed softly, embarrassed. “I knew that. I just…something smells strange. I can’t find it.”

“I’ll take a look,” he said, stepping inside.

She hovered behind him as he checked the vents, the pipes, the corners of the kitchen. She lingered in doorways, hands clasped tight in front of her, watching his movements as if they were anchors.

He crouched by the bedroom vent.

“What does it smell like?”

She opened her mouth. Paused.

“I don’t know,” she whispered. “I did. But I don’t anymore.”

He stood and brushed his hands together.

“I don’t smell anything,” he said gently. “But I’ll come back tomorrow. I’ll check again, even the vents in the empty unit next door.”

Her shoulders eased.

“Oh, thank you, sweetheart,” she said warmly. “It’s so nice to have you home.”

He hesitated.

Then he nodded and let it go.

When the door closed behind him, the quiet rushed back in, filling the apartment too completely. She stood there for a moment, unsure what she had been waiting for.

Then she turned toward the hallway.

“Bathroom,” she murmured, pointing.

“Hall closet…spare room…”

Her voice trailed off.

She stopped.

Someone was standing in the doorway of the spare bedroom.

Not clearly, just a shape, a suggestion of a person framed by the dark. Her breath caught. Not in fear.

In recognition.

“Is that…is that you?” she whispered. “Baby…?”

She stepped closer.

“Son?”

The figure slipped deeper into the room without a sound.

She followed.

The moment she stepped through the doorway, the room changed.

The beige carpet brightened into blue, the one she and his father had installed when he was twelve. The walls filled themselves in: ribbons pinned crookedly, posters of bands she half remembered, corners softened by time. A suit jacket hung from the back of the door.

And he was there.

Standing in front of the mirror, alive and whole, fingers fumbling nervously with a tie.

“Mom,” he said, laughing under his breath. “I can’t get this stupid thing right.”

Tears gathered before she realized she was crying. Her body moved before her mind could catch up.

“Oh…sweetheart,” she murmured, stepping closer. “Here. Let me.”

Her hands found the knot easily. They remembered what she could not. She straightened the fabric, smoothed his collar, brushed imaginary lint from his chest.

He swallowed.

“Thanks, Mom.”

He exhaled a long, hollow breath.

“This is it,” he said quietly. “I’m leaving.”

Her smile faltered.

“Leaving?” she repeated. “What do you mean, leaving?”

He touched her arm, gentle as always. His smile held something she couldn’t name.

“I have to go.”

He pulled her into a hug. For one perfect moment, she felt the solid weight of him, the warmth, the familiar shape of her child against her chest.

Then he stepped away.

As he walked toward the doorway, his edges began to soften. His jacket thinned first, then his hands, then his face, dissolving like breath on glass.

He turned once more and gave her that same smile he had always worn when words weren’t enough.

Then he was gone.

The room peeled away around her, folding in on itself like wet paper. Color drained. The blue carpet dulled. The walls emptied.

She blinked.

She was standing alone in a spare bedroom she barely recognized.

“What, what was I doing in here?” she whispered.

Her voice sounded small.

She stepped backward into the hallway, unsteady, just as a new scent drifted past her.

Saltwater.

The smell of seawater grew stronger as she stepped into the hallway.

Gulls cried somewhere above her. A breeze brushed her skin. The walls softened, the light warming as the apartment loosened its grip. She turned and found herself staring at a framed photograph she didn’t remember hanging there of two young women laughing at the beach, hair wild in the wind.

She lifted the frame, studying the faces.

They felt important.

As if summoned by the thought, a hand settled gently on her shoulder.

She turned.

A woman stood beside her, vibrant, sunlit, wearing a wide-brimmed straw hat and oversized sunglasses that reflected the older woman back at herself. She looked exactly as she had in her thirties. Exactly as she always would.

Her best friend smiled.

“It’s beautiful here,” she said softly. “Isn’t it?”

The older woman’s breath hitched.

“I miss you,” she whispered. “I…I have missed you. Where did you go?”

Her friend shook her head gently.

“Oh, sweetie. I didn’t go anywhere. I was right here.” She tapped her temple lightly. “Just buried. It took me a while to find you again.”

They stepped into each other’s arms. The embrace felt like reunion and farewell at once, warm, complete, already ending.

“One last time,” the older woman murmured, the words catching up to her too late. She pulled back slightly, staring at the mirrored lenses. Her own face stared back, older and afraid. “What do you mean, one last time?”

Her friend’s smile softened.

“I can’t stay,” she said. “And neither can you. We both have to go.”

“Go where?”

“I wish I could tell you.” Her voice was already thinning. “But I don’t get to stay. And you don’t get to remember.”

The sunlight dimmed. The breeze faded. The sound of waves pulled away like a receding tide.

She blinked.

The photograph was empty.

Not torn. Not damaged. Just blank. A frame holding nothing that meant anything to her.

She lowered it slowly, setting it on the hallway table without another glance.

Then she smelled coffee.

She stood in the hallway for a moment, confused by the sudden certainty of it, rich, warm, unmistakable. Her heart stuttered.

“No,” she whispered. “No…it can’t be…”

She steadied herself against the wall and moved toward the kitchen, guided now by a looming fear more than curiosity.

The room shifted as she turned the corner.

His mug sat on the counter. The old coffeemaker sputtered softly, struggling the way it always had. And there he was, standing beside it, older, familiar, wearing the expression she knew better than her own reflection.

“Honey,” he said gently. “Sit down. I’ll make you a cup.”

She didn’t question it. She never had.

She sank into the chair as if it were the only solid thing left in the world. He set the mug down carefully, then knelt beside her, taking her hands in his.

“I need to tell you something.”

She nodded.

“I loved you,” he said. “Every day. From the moment we met. Through our wedding. Through the day our son was born. Through everything.”

Her breath trembled.

“Loved?” she asked. “Do you not…now?”

He smiled that soft, patient smile that had always calmed her.

“Oh, sweetheart. I have loved you, I love you, and I will love you. Even when there’s nothing left of me for you to remember.”

They held each other’s gaze for a long moment. Time didn’t press them. Nothing did.

Then he stood.

“But now,” he said quietly, “I have to go.”

“Don’t,” she begged. “Please. Don’t go.”

His thumb brushed over her knuckles, warm and familiar.

“I have to,” he whispered. “And soon, you won’t remember why this hurts.”

Her voice cracked.

“If you leave…how will I find you?”

He leaned down and kissed her hand.

“I’m not gone,” he said softly. “I’m just not here.”

“I don’t understand,” she whispered.

“I know.”

His outline thinned. His eyes lost their light. His voice faded last.

The kitchen snapped back into itself.

The mug sat on the table, coated in a fine layer of dust.

She stared at it for a long time.

“Why…why am I crying?” she whispered, touching her cheeks in confusion.

She wiped the tears away.

Then she smelled flowers.

The floral scent pulled her out of the chair to the threshold of the kitchen door. The aroma was soft and sweet, familiar in a way she couldn’t place. 

She stepped through the door frame into what should be her living room and stopped. 

The apartment was gone.

Warm firelight flickered across polished wooden floors. Shadows danced along the walls, cast by flames she couldn’t see. Flowers bloomed in ceramic pots along the mantle and windowsills, their colors rich and alive. The air felt warmer here. Kinder.

The space settled around her, not changing so much as remembering itself.

A cottage.

Small. Safe.

Home.

Her breath left her in a shaky exhale. She took a step forward, then another, her fingers brushing the back of the couch as she passed. The fabric felt thick beneath her touch, woven and familiar. Her hand lingered there, tracing the texture as if it might tell her something she’d forgotten.

Behind the couch, three figures stood.

Not solid. Not entirely there. Just vague outlines, like shapes left behind when a light has been turned off too quickly. They didn’t move. They didn’t speak.

They watched.

She squinted at them, tilting her head slightly, searching her tired mind for a name, a face, anything. Her brow creased with effort.

“I know you,” she murmured, though she wasn’t sure why. “Don’t I?”

The figures didn’t answer.

Her legs trembled. Fatigue washed over her without warning, heavy and sudden. She turned and lowered herself onto the couch with a small sigh, as if she had done this a thousand times before.

The cushions yielded beneath her weight, firm but welcoming. Her hands rested on the fabric again, fingertips pressing into the grooves worn there by years of use. A faint smile touched her lips.

She hadn’t sat here in so long.

The firelight flickered.

Footsteps sounded softly behind her.

The footsteps were soft. Careful.

She didn’t turn right away.

A presence moved into the room, warm, familiar, like sunlight through a window she’d forgotten was there.

A voice spoke gently. “Hey there, sweetheart.”

Her breath caught.

She turned.

A young woman stood a few steps away, light spilling around her like it had nowhere else to go. She was confident. Whole. Alive in a way the world no longer felt. Her face was familiar in the way mirrors are familiar, not remembered, just known.

The old woman stared.

“I…I know you,” she whispered. “I’m…you’re…”

The young woman smiled and knelt in front of her.

“That’s right,” she said softly. “It’s me.”

She took the old woman’s hands in her own. Her touch was warm. Real. She held them the way someone does when they’re afraid the moment won’t last.

“I’m here,” she said. “I’m the last piece of you that still remembers how.”

The old woman’s lip trembled.

“I don’t understand,” she whispered.

“I know.” The young woman nodded. “You haven’t understood for a long time.”

She squeezed her hands gently.

“Everyone else is gone now. The memories. The faces. The moments you loved. They slipped away one by one, and you kept trying to follow them, didn’t you? Trying to hold on when holding on stopped making sense.”

The old woman shook her head slowly, tears gathering without permission.

“I didn’t want to forget,” she said. “I tried not to.”

“I know you did,” the young woman said quickly. “God, I know you did.”

Her voice wavered for the first time.

“You weren’t supposed to do this alone. You weren’t supposed to watch everything you loved disappear while your own mind turned against you. But you stayed. You kept waking up. You kept walking through rooms that didn’t recognize you anymore.”

She swallowed.

“I wish I could have stayed with you longer. I wish I could have carried this instead of you. But I couldn’t. And you carried it anyway. For years.”

The old woman’s shoulders began to shake.

“I’m scared,” she whispered.

“I know.” The young woman leaned closer. “But you’ve been scared for so long that you forgot what it felt like not to be.”

She brushed her thumbs across the old woman’s knuckles.

“I need you to hear something before I go.”

The old woman looked up, desperate.

“When I’m gone, there won’t be anything left to hurt you. There won’t be anything left to take from you. The fear will stop. The confusion will stop.”

She smiled through tears.

“You won’t feel alone anymore. There won’t be anything left inside you that can feel lonely.”

The old woman’s eyes searched her face, already slipping past it.

“You’re fading,” she whispered. “I can’t…I can’t see you.”

“I know,” the young woman said. “That’s how it ends.”

Her voice softened to almost nothing.

“You weren’t supposed to watch me disappear. I was supposed to live on through you. But it went the other way.”

She leaned forward and pressed her forehead gently to the old woman’s.

“But you were loved,” she whispered. “You were loved so deeply. And that mattered. Even if nothing remembers it now.”

The figures behind the couch began to blur, their outlines thinning like smoke.

The firelight dimmed.

The cottage shuddered.

“I love you,” the young woman said. “Goodbye, sweetheart.”

She smiled the last real smile the old woman would ever see and then she dissolved, breaking apart like mist in a breeze.

The figures vanished with her.

The cottage collapsed inward, walls folding, light draining away, warmth retreating all at once.

The room fell silent.

The apartment settled back into place.

The old woman sat on the floor of 1E, crying without knowing why, her hands shaking as she wiped tears that meant nothing to her anymore. She stared at the walls, at the doors she didn’t remember opening, at a life reduced to quiet shapes and empty rooms.

“Who am I?” she whispered.

The apartment did not answer.

It only waited, patient and still, as the last fragile pieces of her slipped away. In 1E, there was no final moment, no sudden end, only the gentle unmaking of a life. 

“Some places do not take their tenants all at once.

In apartment 1E, nothing was stolen, nothing was broken, and no struggle was recorded. There were no witnesses, no final moments, no sounds worth noting. Only a quiet vacancy where a life once arranged itself around familiar walls.

The door remains closed.

The unit is considered occupied.”

1ppeh7n,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1ppeh7n/i_met_a_boy_who_hid_forever/,I Met a Boy Who Hid Forever,"I was 22 and had graduated with a bachelor’s degree in English six months ago. I always imagined that as soon as I graduated I’d be publishing books or running some avant-garde lit mag, but I was having a hard time finding my first “real” job. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was running out of time to do something great. 

I’d been working as a volunteer slush reader for \*Dark Dreams Review,\* but I quit after a month when it became clear that the journal wasn’t going anywhere: nothing they published was new or special.

With no job or responsibilities, I started going for long walks around my neighborhood, daydreaming about all the ways I could reinvent myself: move to Hollywood and live out of my car while working on my screenplays, sell all my possessions and travel the country in a van.

It was during one of these walks that I saw the man. We were on Bernard Street and walking toward each other. The middle of winter, and yet, he wore a t-shirt and shorts. When he walked past me I felt a surge of heat and fetid air, like an oven full of plastic had just opened. I turned around in time to see him crossing the street.

An SUV ran a stop sign as the man walked out in front of it. I screamed and threw my hands in the air, but the car passed right through him.

The car moved steadily ahead, and the man continued walking. It was only then, staring at him with my mouth agape, that I realized: the man was somewhat opaque, not obviously so, but enough that I could look through him and vaguely make out dark shadows.

I watched the ghost until he turned the corner, then I followed. I rounded the bend in time to see him walking toward an abandoned house on the right. He entered the front yard and disappeared.

I was stuck in place and breathing hard when a voice came from behind me.

“You can see him too, can’t you?”

I turned around to see a tall, handsome man about my age, with curly blond hair and brown eyes. He looked down at me and smiled like I’d done something surprisingly cute. A kid who solved a math problem she hadn’t been taught in school.

“Yes,” I said. “Who is he?”

“Your guess is as good as mine. You followed him, right?”

I nodded.

“He’s always walking the same path, but he disappears right here. I think it’s where he used to live.”

“What makes you think that?”

“Where else would you spend your afterlife trying to reach?” He shrugged. “My name’s Charles. You want to get a cup of coffee?”

I laughed, and he flinched as if I’d hit him. “I’ll take that as a no?” he asked.

“Yes!” I said, too sharply. “I mean, no. You shouldn’t take it as a no. My name’s Sarah. Let’s get a cup of coffee and… you can tell me more about the ghost?”

“I don’t know anything else. But I can tell you more about me.”

I’m not sure if I said yes because I liked his smile, or because I didn’t want to give up the adventure. 

We spent the 10-minute walk to Collective Coffee making awkward small talk about our lives and hobbies. He was an accountant who spent his free time hiking and rock climbing. He was delighted to know that I was an English major, but when he asked me about a few old books he seemed somewhat disappointed that I didn’t recognize them.

Collective Coffee was a cute little spot I’d never been to before. The walls were covered with black and white portraits of couples and families, and next to the menu above the counter there was a blown-up image of a newspaper article touting the shop as winner of the city’s 1984 “best cup of coffee” competition. The place was empty aside from an old man and woman sitting in the far corner by the bathroom and a barista with pink hair who stood at the counter and greeted us as we approached.

I smiled at her and looked up to study the menu. I was thinking about either a latte or a cappuccino, but then Charles was already ordering his Americano. \*Rude,\* I thought.

“And she’ll have… a chai tea latte?” He finished.

“Uh, sure.”

The girl gave me a sympathetic look, then went to make our drinks.

A few minutes later we were sitting down at a round table in the front.

“So, how often do you see ghosts?” Charles asked.

“Not often,” I didn’t want him to know that this was the first time.

“I’ve been seeing them since I was little,” he said, looking down at his drink.

Charles' childhood home was just on the other end of Bernard Street. He often stopped by because, sometimes, he could see his mother’s ghost through the kitchen window. He’d seen the ghost I’d been watching a few times over the years but had just happened to be walking back from visiting his mom that day.

“So… what happened to your mom?”

“She died.”

“Oh… yeah. Um, do you see ghosts every day?”

“Only when I’ve been out mushroom hunting.”

“Mushroom hunting?”

“Yeah. I like to search around trails and forests for rare mushrooms. Sometimes I eat the edible ones.”

It took me a second to get it. He looked worried until I started laughing.

I made some excuse about my parents needing my help at home. Before I could leave he said, “let’s get dinner… Tuesday night?”

When I took a moment to reply he said, “We can talk about… whatever.”

“Sure,” I said. “I’ll text you.”

\\\*\\\*\\\*

Dinner went okay. He was sweet but awkward; he kept teetering on the edge of telling me something about ghosts. He’d say something like, “sometimes they look, well…” and then go silent before changing the subject. It was like he wasn’t sure if he could trust me. I was determined to show that he could.

We started hanging out a few times a week. Sometimes we’d get dinner, other times it was coffee, a movie, or a walk.

I can’t say I ever liked him that much, at least not romantically, but there was a certain dependency that started not long after the first dinner date. To some degree, I felt close to him because of the power we shared. But he also had this anxious desperation. He hid it well with his smiles and cheesy jokes, but I could tell by how \*hard\* he tried that he was holding his breath with me, or on the edge of his seat, silently begging me not to go. He paid for things and opened doors; he gave me flowers and chocolate. When it was time to say goodbye each night, he’d grab my hand and hold it for just a little too long. Before letting go, he’d squeeze hard, as if considering pulling me in.

So when one day Charles asked me if I wanted to go back to his apartment, I said yes. Not because I felt that I had to, and not because I thought he would be mad if I said no, but because I wanted to be there for him. I wanted to see where he lived, what he kept in his fridge, what he had on his walls, what his room smelled like, I wanted to understand him.

He had no welcome mat or decorations, just a TV, a couch, and some books stacked against the wall. No kitchen table, no recliner, no place to put our shoes.

“You sure know how to live,” I said.

He laughed. “When I was a kid, I spent all my time inside. I didn’t get the chance to experience much. So, when I started living on my own, I decided I’d spend as much time outside as possible. No need for a lot when I’m barely here.”

We sat down on the couch and talked for a while. I don’t remember what about. What I do remember is the way his eyes softened and his lips parted slowly. How he lowered his chin in a way that made him look like a child. I remember, better than I remember anything else, how softly he asked me:

“Will you please try to find me?”

“What?”

“I want you to go outside, count to 10, then come inside and find me.”

Something about the way he asked made it so I couldn’t say no. I went outside and closed the door behind me.

Standing outside in the dark, I was cold and shivering. My heart was pounding and I couldn’t catch my breath. I contemplated running to my car and just forgetting about Charles. I mean, I’d really only known him for a few weeks at this point. Why did he so desperately need me to play this game? I should have just left, but… I had to know where this was going.

When I finished counting I opened the door and scanned the living room. I took a step forward and the sound echoed off the bare walls. I imagined Charles hiding just around the corner. He suddenly had a knife and a rope. He knew exactly where I was. He was waiting.

My throat tightened. The door slammed shut behind me and I cried out. I wanted to leave, but no… it was just a game. I laughed at myself for being so ridiculous.

I took my shoes off before taking another step. The apartment was small and there weren’t a lot of places to hide, but I took my time. I checked behind the couch, under the bed, behind the shower curtain. Each time I turned a corner or opened a door my body was tensed to run.

When I opened the towel closet I found him curled into a ball under the shelf. He was rocking himself back and forth and crying. I reached for him, and he straightened his legs and scooted out. I helped him get to his feet, and he just stared at me. His eyes were wide and he was shaking.

For a moment neither of us moved, but when he took a shaky breath, I leaned in and kissed him. I didn’t know how else to make him feel better.

We had sex that night. I was on top of him with my hands on his chest. I looked straight ahead at the wall the whole time. When we were done we laid next to each other. When he fell asleep I got up and went home.

I came over again to watch a movie a few days later. We sat close together on the couch, almost touching but not.

We were about halfway through when he gently grabbed my chin, turned me toward him, and kissed me. I pulled away on instinct.

“Sorry,” I said. “I just… really like this movie.”

We watched for a little longer, then he paused the TV and said, “Can I tell you something?”

“Of course.”

He took a deep breath.

Charles saw a ghost for the first time while playing in the backyard with his mom. Only, he didn’t realize it was a ghost. He thought it was funny that the yellow dog kept walking back and forth from the big tree to their back door.

When he perfectly described the dog that had died before he was born, was buried under the tree, and that he had absolutely not seen any pictures of, his mom brought him inside and prayed over him for hours.

Later, when he began talking about a “grey man” in the house, she beat him so badly that he was kept out of school for a week for fear of teachers taking notice. She started drinking, and her beatings became more and more frequent. Only, she got smarter about how she dished them out; she hit him in places where no one could see the evidence. She said she was beating the demons out of him.

He started hiding every time his mom drank, or when he knew she’d be coming home late from the bar. She’d walk into the house screaming his name. Sometimes, if he hid really well, it would take her an hour to find him. But she would never stop looking until she did.

“Even now,” he said, “part of me feels… loved. She always looked for me so hard. Like I mattered to her more than anything else in the world. She wanted to find me and beat me because she thought she could cure me. If she hated me she could have just kicked me out or killed me, you know? She never stopped looking, and she never stopped trying. Until she died.”

It happened when he was 12. She came home after a long night at the bar and found him quickly because he wasn’t hiding at all. He was sitting on the couch waiting for her.

She went to slap him, but when her arm was just an inch from his face, he caught her by the wrist, squeezed hard, looked her in the eyes, and told her \*no.\*

When she tried to hit him with her other hand, he caught that one too. He let go, and she tried to hit him again and again. Each time he stopped her. He didn’t hit her back, but for the first time, he defended himself. She ran to her room sobbing.

“I should’ve just hid,” he said. “She would’ve looked for me, and she would’ve found me, like always.”

But in the morning it was he who found her, dead in her bed. There was another her checking in closets and behind furniture.

“I’m right here,” he told her.

She turned.

“You found me.”

She walked toward him like she always did, eyes narrowed and fist raised to strike. But when she brought that fist down, it went swiftly through him like a knife through a thin layer of smoke. She tried to hit him again and again as she screamed like a banshee. 

He backed away. “Why do you want to hurt me!?”

“There’s a demon inside you! You need to stop talking to ghosts!” 

“You’re a ghost!”

He ran out of the house and called the police. But as he looked through the front window, he saw her peeking behind the TV with her arm reared back.

When he was done talking, I told him to hide, and that night I looked for him harder than ever.

For weeks after, almost every night, I’d search for him and we'd end up in bed. I didn’t particularly like the strange game of hide-and-seek, but I didn’t hate it either. It made him happy. I really did want him to be happy. Even if I didn’t love him like he loved me.

\\\*\\\*\\\*

One day, we were hiking through a trail he’d been begging to take me to for weeks. It was special to him, and he kept stopping to tell me facts about different plants and wildlife. It was so mind-numbingly boring. I kept trying to steer the conversation toward ghosts. I asked him if he could see any right now, or if he could sense any nearby, but all he would say was something like “that’s not how it works” before saying something about the trail. He had just finished explaining the lineage of some tree when I came right out and said it.

“I’m starting to get bored. Will you take me to see your mom?” 

I think we both knew that I was being intentionally vague about what exactly I was getting bored of. I could see the fear in his eyes.

He swallowed hard before answering. “Okay. But only once.”

\\\*\\\*\\\*

We went on a Wednesday in the early afternoon so that the family who lived there would all be at school or work. It was a square house on the corner of Bernard Street. Brown brick, three steps up to the patio and front door. We walked through the grass to the right side of the house and looked in through the kitchen windows.

While the house was foundationally no different from the average suburban home, the owners had made it their own in a way that was beautiful. The counter in front of the window held a yellow coffee mug with crudely drawn black lines meant to resemble a bee. The fridge was covered with crayon drawings and A+ grades. There were five chairs circled around the kitchen table.

When I looked over at Charles, his face was pressed against the glass, his breath fogged the space in front of his lips.

“Is she here?” I asked. “I don’t see her.”

Charles only nodded.

“What… what is she doing?”

“Just… walking.”

I closed my eyes and tried to imagine it. A cursed, phantom lady roaming the home, fist-raised, a fiery anger in her eyes as she hunted for her kid in a house full of others. I wondered if any of them ever saw her. Or if she saw them.

After a few moments Charles said, “We better get going before someone sees us,” and we began walking aimlessly down the street.

“Why do you think she’s still there?” I asked. 

“Trauma, I guess. Or purpose. Maybe they’re the same thing. I mean, I was my mom’s trauma, and her purpose was to stop me, right?”

“How come I can’t see her? And how come I can see the one on the street? I don’t understand.”

“I don’t either. But you’re not like me. I see ghosts all the time. You only see the one, right?”

“Yeah. But what’s so special about that one?”

“I don’t know. Maybe you’re connected somehow.” He paused for a moment before finishing. “Please don’t make me take you back here again.”

That night I looked for Charles, and when I found him, he cried so hard that I couldn’t do anything but just hold his head in my lap and brush his hair. It was the first time I felt guilty about us. Did he realize how transactional our relationship was? I thought he did. 

“I’m sorry,” I said, hoping he knew what I meant.

\\\*\\\*\\\*

Around that time, I found a full-time job as an SAT/ACT tutor. Charles was the first person I called when I got the news. 

“I’m so excited for you,” he said. “You deserve it so much, and I know you’ll do great. How about dinner tonight to celebrate?”

He pulled out all the stops. We had steak and wine, then chocolate cake for dessert. He kept telling me that I was so smart and so qualified. He said it so many times that I was starting to feel like he doubted it. 

At the end of the night he walked me to my car. When we were saying goodbye he looked at me so pleadingly, the way he did when he wanted me to go back to his place and find him. But he could tell that I was tired and he was too sweet to ask. Instead, he gave me a tight hug and squeezed my hand. 

I found myself enjoying my job and looking forward to sessions with students. For the first time in a while I felt as though I had a purpose: helping kids get into college. 

I spent so much more than 40 hours a week on my work. I made detailed plans for each student. I imagined how excited they would be when they finally got their goal scores. It took up almost all my time. I loved it. 

I still cared for Charles, but I was getting bored, and the newfound purpose made it hard to ignore the guilt.

So I began drifting away from him. We went from going to his apartment every day to hanging out once a week. Whenever we were together I had this heavy feeling in my chest, like I was mourning something. Once a week turned to every other week, and I could tell that he realized what was happening. Sometimes there were tears in his eyes when we parted ways. 

Eventually we were just texting every few days, like old college friends. 

How’s work?

Good. 

You?

Good. 

This continued for a while, but as I settled into the routine of my job, I was bored again. The students seemed to get dumber and less motivated over time. It was frustrating to explain the same thing over and over, week after week in all kinds of different ways. They just wouldn’t learn, and yet their parents blamed me when their scores didn’t increase. After a while, I decided there wasn’t a point in what I was doing after all. There was no purpose. Just a job.

I started going to see the street ghost on my own. I started to think of him as \*my\* ghost. My personal reminder that there was more to the world than test scores and bratty teenagers. I became braver, more used to him. I’d walk directly behind him, copying his every move. As we neared the old house, I’d close my eyes and keep walking, imagining that I was him, finishing the steps that he couldn’t. All the time I wondered what the ghost’s trauma was. 

But after a while I started to want more. It wasn’t fair. Why did Charles get to see all these ghosts all the time, and I only had the one?

So I reached out to him again. I texted him and waited a few days, but he didn’t answer. I couldn’t blame him. After all, the last text he’d sent me was asking if I wanted to get dinner. Two weeks later, and I’d never replied.

When I got tired of waiting, I drove to his apartment. I knocked on his door, waited a few minutes, then went home. I tried again the next day, and the next. Eventually I got angry. I treated him like a video game that wasn’t working. He was the reason I couldn’t have my fun, my excitement. And there was only one of him. I couldn’t go buy another copy. So, one day, after sitting outside his apartment for hours, I just… opened the door. 

I called his name. I shouted that it was me; I said I just wanted to make sure he was okay. He didn’t answer, so I walked inside and started looking.

I found myself checking all the places he used to hide back when we were together: behind the couch, in the bedroom closet, under his bed. When I walked into his bathroom, the smell hit me. He was lying in the tub, curled into a ball yet so flat that he was almost sinking into it. Trailing down his wrists were thick lines of dried blood that pooled underneath him. Sitting next to him was another Charles. He looked at me with a blank expression.

“You found me,” he said.

“Oh God,” I cried, falling back against the sink. “What happened to you?”

He didn’t answer.

“Why didn’t you tell me you were going to do this? I could have helped you, couldn’t I have?”

He didn’t respond.

“Why… why are you still here? Are you… like your mom, and the man on the street?”

“Things are different.”

“Are they better?”

He didn’t answer for so long that I almost asked again.

“No,” he said.

“Are you choosing to hide? Could you move on… somewhere else?”

“If I go, then who will find me?”

“I don’t know,” I said. “I’m sorry.”

He was silent after that. I had to fight the urge to break down and scream.

After some time he stood up and walked out of the bathroom. Slow and focused, like the ghost on the street.

I counted to 10.

When I found him behind the couch he smiled. 

“You found me.”

“Charles… isn’t… isn’t there a way for me to help you?”

But he was already looking for a new place to hide. 

\\\*\\\*\\\*

I still watch the man on the street. When I’m particularly sad, I follow him until he disappears, then I close my eyes and keep walking. I don’t pretend that I’m him anymore. I let the heat and the smell of death wash over me. I think of my future; I think of my past. I ask myself, sometimes over and over:

1ppeh61,https://i.redd.it/e57w14ohav7g1.jpeg,So. It will soon be time. Prep Stage of leaving the church. Give your opinion,"Come on it’s Reddit. You all have an opinion on this so share it even if it’s bad. Give me variety of answers, I refuse to use ChatGPT for this. 

I(20F) am about to move in with my sister(23F). It will be our first apartment. I have a car now and I’m working two jobs(one is technically a side hustle) I pay insurance and phone. And like a good Mormon girl I’m putting aside savings upon savings for my future 🥺. I low-key don’t pay tithing so that is where it’s all going. I’m attending university in the spring. And will be working a full-time job at the same time to save a bunch of money. My sister and I plan to move out this summer. 

OK, OK that was the background info. 

My question is, how do I handle my sister? 

She is currently active and is uncomfortable with event the idea of questioning the church due to not having ANY social circle outside of it(her social circle is already very small) 

\[Sibling\] I obviously don’t wanna still be going to church once I start paying my own big girl bills but I don’t want to put her in an awkward position(a cruel inevitability) since I was raised in a family without boundaries tell me how do I set some for her that will help her understand she is not responsible for making me go to church. We will be planning where we want to move soon and she really wants to move RIGHT BY the YA ward. So like— help

\[Parents\] How do I sneakily pull away once I’m in the apartment. I know for the first month or so I am going to have to be a goody girl because my parents will be really into making sure we follow the gospel on our own. But after that righteous high is the time I’m wondering about.

Also, I feel really scummy with the idea of leaving because it almost feels like I’m trapping her as she doesn’t know I’m leaving the church. Thoughts?

LASTLY what am I supposed to do in college if I’m not going to church?! I don’t like parties they stress me out, and I legit have no friends (isolated as a child and I’m learning how to socialize. Made a few semi friends in community college, but we are no longer in contact.  🥺)

What did yall do?

1ppefs3,https://www.reddit.com/r/iih/comments/1ppefs3/currently_going_through_the_process_to_be/,Currently going through the process to be diagnosed with IIH. How many of our symptoms match?,"I've got a lumbar procedure scheduled to be diagnosed but otherwise just dealing with these symptoms as they come for now. I'm curious to know if anyone has experienced all or similar symptoms before they began treatment. 

- congested feeling develops when heating is going. Ex. If I place a radiator in front of me to stay warm, my ears become very full feeling and my head feels cloudy. So I end up feeling like crap until I'm in cooler air.

- sinus pain. My theory is that the increased pressure is pushing on the sinuses and that's why there's pain. I can't find articles that agree or disagree with this.

- ear fullness. Generally my ears feel like they're underwater or that they need to pop but just won't. So it makes hearing a bit difficult.

- worsening symptoms at night. I notice when I come home from work and relax on the couch, I begin to feel worse and worse ear fullness. I also can hear the bloodflow in my ear louder. I wonder if its my posture or just the long periods of sitting or laying upright.

- neck pain. Initially, I thought it was how I slept but after the doctor told me this may likely be IIH, I bet that's the cause. 

- tiredness especially after a cup of coffee or tea. Some argue its adhd but I'm not diagnosed and looking up symptoms and pressure impacts, I bet this is the cause. 

- mild relief of symptoms when you're eating. Idk why but it almost feels like while I'm eating my ears don't hurt as much and I can hear better.

Almost all sumptoms listed above popped up this year for me. However I had an odd eye exam in 2023 which is when the optometrist gave a referral. I never followed up and what I'm experiencing is way worse today, so go to those referrals y'all. 

Really I'm just hoping there is a large correlation between symptoms im experiencing and symptoms others have dealt with. If this isn't why I feel like crap, then idk what's wrong with me and where to look for answers. 

In the meantime, very curious to know if people dealt with similar problems before beginning medication. ",1,1766022015.0,iih,0,1.0,False

1ppeewb,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ppeewb/kinda_at_a_new_low/,Kinda at a new low,"Long history of emotional abuse from my parents. I always had my physical needs met but I was severely traumatized by several things and the big one that’s effecting me now is that I always had to repress my anger and my sadness. Now I’m too conflict avoidant to function in life and too afraid of crying to do it even in-front of a therapist. 

  
I just cut off my parents completely in the past few months after moving across the country for the 3rd time to get away from my toxic enmeshed family. I took a job for the railroad, which if any of you know about the railroad is just about as toxic as a workplace gets. I ended up quitting there and now ive been working some casual jobs because its all I’ve had the energy for.

  
I’ve lived in 3 different houses in the past 6months and I keep having to move because I am unable to deal with roommate conflict. Every time I try to state a boundary it feels like I am doing something wrong and I can’t deal with it when they don’t respond in a compassionate way. I am also autistic so I really struggle with sensory stimulation. especially sound and my last house was so loud that I would hit myself and bite my arms as a way to regulate.

I tried lightly asking to move to a room upstairs which was empty but they took a long time to reply to that. I had to remind them that I asked because It was so hard living in the loud room below the kitchen. When I asked I brought up that I wanted to go upstairs because I was sensitive to sound but I guess they didn’t pick up on my message and they continued to use the coffee table chairs directly above my room without consideratio. I was too afraid of conflict to say anything else.

I basically started to spend all of my time in my car, at work, or elsewhere, but every time I came back it was so loud. the washing machine/dryer, the bathroom, them talking in their room, the kitchen above. It was just too overwhelming so I suddenly decided to move out and now I am stuck living in my small car in a wet Canadian town during winter.

  
As I was moving out I totally lied to them and pretended like everything was okay and that I  found a place to live with my friends. I live in a small ski town with a housing crisis and it is near impossible to find housing so this actually made a small lick of sense to them. With that housing situation it is basically going to be impossible for me to find a room to live in.

Even if I do find one, I am so scared that I will end up with more people who I don’t feel comfortable to have healthy conflict with. 

I really hate myself for always putting myself in this type of situation. I just feel hopeless and like I’ll never be able to reach any sort of my goals in life like having a wife, kids, a dog, and a good career. I’m 27 but I feel like I haven’t gotten past where I was when I was 17. 

The kicker is today after I moved out the clutch on my car, which was already bad, got even worse and now I think my car is going to not work anymore very soon.

I’m a few thousand in debt and I just feel like there is no path forward. I have no want or intention of killing myself or hurting myself. I just feel like I am stuck in this pattern of self sabotage and there is no way for me to improve. 

  
tldr: Childhood emotional abuse, autism, adhd, severely conflict avoidant, just left room in house in town with housing crisis, living in car during Canadian winter, clutch on car failing on this same day. ",1,1766021945.0,depression,0,1.0,False
1ppeeuj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1ppeeuj/i_met_a_boy_who_hid_forever/,I Met a Boy Who Hid Forever,"I was 22 and had graduated with a bachelor’s degree in English six months ago. I always imagined that as soon as I graduated I’d be publishing books or running some avant-garde lit mag, but I was having a hard time finding my first “real” job. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was running out of time to do something great. 

I’d been working as a volunteer slush reader for \*Dark Dreams Review,\* but I quit after a month when it became clear that the journal wasn’t going anywhere: nothing they published was new or special.

With no job or responsibilities, I started going for long walks around my neighborhood, daydreaming about all the ways I could reinvent myself: move to Hollywood and live out of my car while working on my screenplays, sell all my possessions and travel the country in a van.

It was during one of these walks that I saw the man. We were on Bernard Street and walking toward each other. The middle of winter, and yet, he wore a t-shirt and shorts. When he walked past me I felt a surge of heat and fetid air, like an oven full of plastic had just opened. I turned around in time to see him crossing the street.

An SUV ran a stop sign as the man walked out in front of it. I screamed and threw my hands in the air, but the car passed right through him.

The car moved steadily ahead, and the man continued walking. It was only then, staring at him with my mouth agape, that I realized: the man was somewhat opaque, not obviously so, but enough that I could look through him and vaguely make out dark shadows.

I watched the ghost until he turned the corner, then I followed. I rounded the bend in time to see him walking toward an abandoned house on the right. He entered the front yard and disappeared.

I was stuck in place and breathing hard when a voice came from behind me.

“You can see him too, can’t you?”

I turned around to see a tall, handsome man about my age, with curly blond hair and brown eyes. He looked down at me and smiled like I’d done something surprisingly cute. A kid who solved a math problem she hadn’t been taught in school.

“Yes,” I said. “Who is he?”

“Your guess is as good as mine. You followed him, right?”

I nodded.

“He’s always walking the same path, but he disappears right here. I think it’s where he used to live.”

“What makes you think that?”

“Where else would you spend your afterlife trying to reach?” He shrugged. “My name’s Charles. You want to get a cup of coffee?”

I laughed, and he flinched as if I’d hit him. “I’ll take that as a no?” he asked.

“Yes!” I said, too sharply. “I mean, no. You shouldn’t take it as a no. My name’s Sarah. Let’s get a cup of coffee and… you can tell me more about the ghost?”

“I don’t know anything else. But I can tell you more about me.”

I’m not sure if I said yes because I liked his smile, or because I didn’t want to give up the adventure. 

We spent the 10-minute walk to Collective Coffee making awkward small talk about our lives and hobbies. He was an accountant who spent his free time hiking and rock climbing. He was delighted to know that I was an English major, but when he asked me about a few old books he seemed somewhat disappointed that I didn’t recognize them.

Collective Coffee was a cute little spot I’d never been to before. The walls were covered with black and white portraits of couples and families, and next to the menu above the counter there was a blown-up image of a newspaper article touting the shop as winner of the city’s 1984 “best cup of coffee” competition. The place was empty aside from an old man and woman sitting in the far corner by the bathroom and a barista with pink hair who stood at the counter and greeted us as we approached.

I smiled at her and looked up to study the menu. I was thinking about either a latte or a cappuccino, but then Charles was already ordering his Americano. \*Rude,\* I thought.

“And she’ll have… a chai tea latte?” He finished.

“Uh, sure.”

The girl gave me a sympathetic look, then went to make our drinks.

A few minutes later we were sitting down at a round table in the front.

“So, how often do you see ghosts?” Charles asked.

“Not often,” I didn’t want him to know that this was the first time.

“I’ve been seeing them since I was little,” he said, looking down at his drink.

Charles' childhood home was just on the other end of Bernard Street. He often stopped by because, sometimes, he could see his mother’s ghost through the kitchen window. He’d seen the ghost I’d been watching a few times over the years but had just happened to be walking back from visiting his mom that day.

“So… what happened to your mom?”

“She died.”

“Oh… yeah. Um, do you see ghosts every day?”

“Only when I’ve been out mushroom hunting.”

“Mushroom hunting?”

“Yeah. I like to search around trails and forests for rare mushrooms. Sometimes I eat the edible ones.”

It took me a second to get it. He looked worried until I started laughing.

I made some excuse about my parents needing my help at home. Before I could leave he said, “let’s get dinner… Tuesday night?”

When I took a moment to reply he said, “We can talk about… whatever.”

“Sure,” I said. “I’ll text you.”

\\\*\\\*\\\*

Dinner went okay. He was sweet but awkward; he kept teetering on the edge of telling me something about ghosts. He’d say something like, “sometimes they look, well…” and then go silent before changing the subject. It was like he wasn’t sure if he could trust me. I was determined to show that he could.

We started hanging out a few times a week. Sometimes we’d get dinner, other times it was coffee, a movie, or a walk.

I can’t say I ever liked him that much, at least not romantically, but there was a certain dependency that started not long after the first dinner date. To some degree, I felt close to him because of the power we shared. But he also had this anxious desperation. He hid it well with his smiles and cheesy jokes, but I could tell by how \*hard\* he tried that he was holding his breath with me, or on the edge of his seat, silently begging me not to go. He paid for things and opened doors; he gave me flowers and chocolate. When it was time to say goodbye each night, he’d grab my hand and hold it for just a little too long. Before letting go, he’d squeeze hard, as if considering pulling me in.

So when one day Charles asked me if I wanted to go back to his apartment, I said yes. Not because I felt that I had to, and not because I thought he would be mad if I said no, but because I wanted to be there for him. I wanted to see where he lived, what he kept in his fridge, what he had on his walls, what his room smelled like, I wanted to understand him.

He had no welcome mat or decorations, just a TV, a couch, and some books stacked against the wall. No kitchen table, no recliner, no place to put our shoes.

“You sure know how to live,” I said.

He laughed. “When I was a kid, I spent all my time inside. I didn’t get the chance to experience much. So, when I started living on my own, I decided I’d spend as much time outside as possible. No need for a lot when I’m barely here.”

We sat down on the couch and talked for a while. I don’t remember what about. What I do remember is the way his eyes softened and his lips parted slowly. How he lowered his chin in a way that made him look like a child. I remember, better than I remember anything else, how softly he asked me:

“Will you please try to find me?”

“What?”

“I want you to go outside, count to 10, then come inside and find me.”

Something about the way he asked made it so I couldn’t say no. I went outside and closed the door behind me.

Standing outside in the dark, I was cold and shivering. My heart was pounding and I couldn’t catch my breath. I contemplated running to my car and just forgetting about Charles. I mean, I’d really only known him for a few weeks at this point. Why did he so desperately need me to play this game? I should have just left, but… I had to know where this was going.

When I finished counting I opened the door and scanned the living room. I took a step forward and the sound echoed off the bare walls. I imagined Charles hiding just around the corner. He suddenly had a knife and a rope. He knew exactly where I was. He was waiting.

My throat tightened. The door slammed shut behind me and I cried out. I wanted to leave, but no… it was just a game. I laughed at myself for being so ridiculous.

I took my shoes off before taking another step. The apartment was small and there weren’t a lot of places to hide, but I took my time. I checked behind the couch, under the bed, behind the shower curtain. Each time I turned a corner or opened a door my body was tensed to run.

When I opened the towel closet I found him curled into a ball under the shelf. He was rocking himself back and forth and crying. I reached for him, and he straightened his legs and scooted out. I helped him get to his feet, and he just stared at me. His eyes were wide and he was shaking.

For a moment neither of us moved, but when he took a shaky breath, I leaned in and kissed him. I didn’t know how else to make him feel better.

We had sex that night. I was on top of him with my hands on his chest. I looked straight ahead at the wall the whole time. When we were done we laid next to each other. When he fell asleep I got up and went home.

I came over again to watch a movie a few days later. We sat close together on the couch, almost touching but not.

We were about halfway through when he gently grabbed my chin, turned me toward him, and kissed me. I pulled away on instinct.

“Sorry,” I said. “I just… really like this movie.”

We watched for a little longer, then he paused the TV and said, “Can I tell you something?”

“Of course.”

He took a deep breath.

Charles saw a ghost for the first time while playing in the backyard with his mom. Only, he didn’t realize it was a ghost. He thought it was funny that the yellow dog kept walking back and forth from the big tree to their back door.

When he perfectly described the dog that had died before he was born, was buried under the tree, and that he had absolutely not seen any pictures of, his mom brought him inside and prayed over him for hours.

Later, when he began talking about a “grey man” in the house, she beat him so badly that he was kept out of school for a week for fear of teachers taking notice. She started drinking, and her beatings became more and more frequent. Only, she got smarter about how she dished them out; she hit him in places where no one could see the evidence. She said she was beating the demons out of him.

He started hiding every time his mom drank, or when he knew she’d be coming home late from the bar. She’d walk into the house screaming his name. Sometimes, if he hid really well, it would take her an hour to find him. But she would never stop looking until she did.

“Even now,” he said, “part of me feels… loved. She always looked for me so hard. Like I mattered to her more than anything else in the world. She wanted to find me and beat me because she thought she could cure me. If she hated me she could have just kicked me out or killed me, you know? She never stopped looking, and she never stopped trying. Until she died.”

It happened when he was 12. She came home after a long night at the bar and found him quickly because he wasn’t hiding at all. He was sitting on the couch waiting for her.

She went to slap him, but when her arm was just an inch from his face, he caught her by the wrist, squeezed hard, looked her in the eyes, and told her \*no.\*

When she tried to hit him with her other hand, he caught that one too. He let go, and she tried to hit him again and again. Each time he stopped her. He didn’t hit her back, but for the first time, he defended himself. She ran to her room sobbing.

“I should’ve just hid,” he said. “She would’ve looked for me, and she would’ve found me, like always.”

But in the morning it was he who found her, dead in her bed. There was another her checking in closets and behind furniture.

“I’m right here,” he told her.

She turned.

“You found me.”

She walked toward him like she always did, eyes narrowed and fist raised to strike. But when she brought that fist down, it went swiftly through him like a knife through a thin layer of smoke. She tried to hit him again and again as she screamed like a banshee. 

He backed away. “Why do you want to hurt me!?”

“There’s a demon inside you! You need to stop talking to ghosts!” 

“You’re a ghost!”

He ran out of the house and called the police. But as he looked through the front window, he saw her peeking behind the TV with her arm reared back.

When he was done talking, I told him to hide, and that night I looked for him harder than ever.

For weeks after, almost every night, I’d search for him and we'd end up in bed. I didn’t particularly like the strange game of hide-and-seek, but I didn’t hate it either. It made him happy. I really did want him to be happy. Even if I didn’t love him like he loved me.

\\\*\\\*\\\*

One day, we were hiking through a trail he’d been begging to take me to for weeks. It was special to him, and he kept stopping to tell me facts about different plants and wildlife. It was so mind-numbingly boring. I kept trying to steer the conversation toward ghosts. I asked him if he could see any right now, or if he could sense any nearby, but all he would say was something like “that’s not how it works” before saying something about the trail. He had just finished explaining the lineage of some tree when I came right out and said it.

“I’m starting to get bored. Will you take me to see your mom?” 

I think we both knew that I was being intentionally vague about what exactly I was getting bored of. I could see the fear in his eyes.

He swallowed hard before answering. “Okay. But only once.”

\\\*\\\*\\\*

We went on a Wednesday in the early afternoon so that the family who lived there would all be at school or work. It was a square house on the corner of Bernard Street. Brown brick, three steps up to the patio and front door. We walked through the grass to the right side of the house and looked in through the kitchen windows.

While the house was foundationally no different from the average suburban home, the owners had made it their own in a way that was beautiful. The counter in front of the window held a yellow coffee mug with crudely drawn black lines meant to resemble a bee. The fridge was covered with crayon drawings and A+ grades. There were five chairs circled around the kitchen table.

When I looked over at Charles, his face was pressed against the glass, his breath fogged the space in front of his lips.

“Is she here?” I asked. “I don’t see her.”

Charles only nodded.

“What… what is she doing?”

“Just… walking.”

I closed my eyes and tried to imagine it. A cursed, phantom lady roaming the home, fist-raised, a fiery anger in her eyes as she hunted for her kid in a house full of others. I wondered if any of them ever saw her. Or if she saw them.

After a few moments Charles said, “We better get going before someone sees us,” and we began walking aimlessly down the street.

“Why do you think she’s still there?” I asked. 

“Trauma, I guess. Or purpose. Maybe they’re the same thing. I mean, I was my mom’s trauma, and her purpose was to stop me, right?”

“How come I can’t see her? And how come I can see the one on the street? I don’t understand.”

“I don’t either. But you’re not like me. I see ghosts all the time. You only see the one, right?”

“Yeah. But what’s so special about that one?”

“I don’t know. Maybe you’re connected somehow.” He paused for a moment before finishing. “Please don’t make me take you back here again.”

That night I looked for Charles, and when I found him, he cried so hard that I couldn’t do anything but just hold his head in my lap and brush his hair. It was the first time I felt guilty about us. Did he realize how transactional our relationship was? I thought he did. 

“I’m sorry,” I said, hoping he knew what I meant.

\\\*\\\*\\\*

Around that time, I found a full-time job as an SAT/ACT tutor. Charles was the first person I called when I got the news. 

“I’m so excited for you,” he said. “You deserve it so much, and I know you’ll do great. How about dinner tonight to celebrate?”

He pulled out all the stops. We had steak and wine, then chocolate cake for dessert. He kept telling me that I was so smart and so qualified. He said it so many times that I was starting to feel like he doubted it. 

At the end of the night he walked me to my car. When we were saying goodbye he looked at me so pleadingly, the way he did when he wanted me to go back to his place and find him. But he could tell that I was tired and he was too sweet to ask. Instead, he gave me a tight hug and squeezed my hand. 

I found myself enjoying my job and looking forward to sessions with students. For the first time in a while I felt as though I had a purpose: helping kids get into college. 

I spent so much more than 40 hours a week on my work. I made detailed plans for each student. I imagined how excited they would be when they finally got their goal scores. It took up almost all my time. I loved it. 

I still cared for Charles, but I was getting bored, and the newfound purpose made it hard to ignore the guilt.

So I began drifting away from him. We went from going to his apartment every day to hanging out once a week. Whenever we were together I had this heavy feeling in my chest, like I was mourning something. Once a week turned to every other week, and I could tell that he realized what was happening. Sometimes there were tears in his eyes when we parted ways. 

Eventually we were just texting every few days, like old college friends. 

How’s work?

Good. 

You?

Good. 

This continued for a while, but as I settled into the routine of my job, I was bored again. The students seemed to get dumber and less motivated over time. It was frustrating to explain the same thing over and over, week after week in all kinds of different ways. They just wouldn’t learn, and yet their parents blamed me when their scores didn’t increase. After a while, I decided there wasn’t a point in what I was doing after all. There was no purpose. Just a job.

I started going to see the street ghost on my own. I started to think of him as \*my\* ghost. My personal reminder that there was more to the world than test scores and bratty teenagers. I became braver, more used to him. I’d walk directly behind him, copying his every move. As we neared the old house, I’d close my eyes and keep walking, imagining that I was him, finishing the steps that he couldn’t. All the time I wondered what the ghost’s trauma was. 

But after a while I started to want more. It wasn’t fair. Why did Charles get to see all these ghosts all the time, and I only had the one?

So I reached out to him again. I texted him and waited a few days, but he didn’t answer. I couldn’t blame him. After all, the last text he’d sent me was asking if I wanted to get dinner. Two weeks later, and I’d never replied.

When I got tired of waiting, I drove to his apartment. I knocked on his door, waited a few minutes, then went home. I tried again the next day, and the next. Eventually I got angry. I treated him like a video game that wasn’t working. He was the reason I couldn’t have my fun, my excitement. And there was only one of him. I couldn’t go buy another copy. So, one day, after sitting outside his apartment for hours, I just… opened the door. 

I called his name. I shouted that it was me; I said I just wanted to make sure he was okay. He didn’t answer, so I walked inside and started looking.

I found myself checking all the places he used to hide back when we were together: behind the couch, in the bedroom closet, under his bed. When I walked into his bathroom, the smell hit me. He was lying in the tub, curled into a ball yet so flat that he was almost sinking into it. Trailing down his wrists were thick lines of dried blood that pooled underneath him. Sitting next to him was another Charles. He looked at me with a blank expression.

“You found me,” he said.

“Oh God,” I cried, falling back against the sink. “What happened to you?”

He didn’t answer.

“Why didn’t you tell me you were going to do this? I could have helped you, couldn’t I have?”

He didn’t respond.

“Why… why are you still here? Are you… like your mom, and the man on the street?”

“Things are different.”

“Are they better?”

He didn’t answer for so long that I almost asked again.

“No,” he said.

“Are you choosing to hide? Could you move on… somewhere else?”

“If I go, then who will find me?”

“I don’t know,” I said. “I’m sorry.”

He was silent after that. I had to fight the urge to break down and scream.

After some time he stood up and walked out of the bathroom. Slow and focused, like the ghost on the street.

I counted to 10.

When I found him behind the couch he smiled. 

“You found me.”

“Charles… isn’t… isn’t there a way for me to help you?”

But he was already looking for a new place to hide. 

\\\*\\\*\\\*

I still watch the man on the street. When I’m particularly sad, I follow him until he disappears, then I close my eyes and keep walking. I don’t pretend that I’m him anymore. I let the heat and the smell of death wash over me. I think of my future; I think of my past. I ask myself, sometimes over and over:

I made some excuse about my parents needing my help at home. Before I could leave he said, “let’s get dinner… Tuesday night?”

When I took a moment to reply he said, “We can talk about… whatever.”

“Sure,” I said. “I’ll text you.”

\\\*\\\*\\\*

Dinner went okay. He was sweet but awkward; he kept teetering on the edge of telling me something about ghosts. He’d say something like, “sometimes they look, well…” and then go silent before changing the subject. It was like he wasn’t sure if he could trust me. I was determined to show that he could.

We started hanging out a few times a week. Sometimes we’d get dinner, other times it was coffee, a movie, or a walk.

I can’t say I ever liked him that much, at least not romantically, but there was a certain dependency that started not long after the first dinner date. To some degree, I felt close to him because of the power we shared. But he also had this anxious desperation. He hid it well with his smiles and cheesy jokes, but I could tell by how \*hard\* he tried that he was holding his breath with me, or on the edge of his seat, silently begging me not to go. He paid for things and opened doors; he gave me flowers and chocolate. When it was time to say goodbye each night, he’d grab my hand and hold it for just a little too long. Before letting go, he’d squeeze hard, as if considering pulling me in.

So when one day Charles asked me if I wanted to go back to his apartment, I said yes. Not because I felt that I had to, and not because I thought he would be mad if I said no, but because I wanted to be there for him. I wanted to see where he lived, what he kept in his fridge, what he had on his walls, what his room smelled like, I wanted to understand him.

He had no welcome mat or decorations, just a TV, a couch, and some books stacked against the wall. No kitchen table, no recliner, no place to put our shoes.

“You sure know how to live,” I said.

He laughed. “When I was a kid, I spent all my time inside. I didn’t get the chance to experience much. So, when I started living on my own, I decided I’d spend as much time outside as possible. No need for a lot when I’m barely here.”

We sat down on the couch and talked for a while. I don’t remember what about. What I do remember is the way his eyes softened and his lips parted slowly. How he lowered his chin in a way that made him look like a child. I remember, better than I remember anything else, how softly he asked me:

“Will you please try to find me?”

“What?”

“I want you to go outside, count to 10, then come inside and find me.”

Something about the way he asked made it so I couldn’t say no. I went outside and closed the door behind me.

Standing outside in the dark, I was cold and shivering. My heart was pounding and I couldn’t catch my breath. I contemplated running to my car and just forgetting about Charles. I mean, I’d really only known him for a few weeks at this point. Why did he so desperately need me to play this game? I should have just left, but… I had to know where this was going.

When I finished counting I opened the door and scanned the living room. I took a step forward and the sound echoed off the bare walls. I imagined Charles hiding just around the corner. He suddenly had a knife and a rope. He knew exactly where I was. He was waiting.

My throat tightened. The door slammed shut behind me and I cried out. I wanted to leave, but no… it was just a game. I laughed at myself for being so ridiculous.

I took my shoes off before taking another step. The apartment was small and there weren’t a lot of places to hide, but I took my time. I checked behind the couch, under the bed, behind the shower curtain. Each time I turned a corner or opened a door my body was tensed to run.

When I opened the towel closet I found him curled into a ball under the shelf. He was rocking himself back and forth and crying. I reached for him, and he straightened his legs and scooted out. I helped him get to his feet, and he just stared at me. His eyes were wide and he was shaking.

For a moment neither of us moved, but when he took a shaky breath, I leaned in and kissed him. I didn’t know how else to make him feel better.

We had sex that night. I was on top of him with my hands on his chest. I looked straight ahead at the wall the whole time. When we were done we laid next to each other. When he fell asleep I got up and went home.

I came over again to watch a movie a few days later. We sat close together on the couch, almost touching but not.

We were about halfway through when he gently grabbed my chin, turned me toward him, and kissed me. I pulled away on instinct.

“Sorry,” I said. “I just… really like this movie.”

We watched for a little longer, then he paused the TV and said, “Can I tell you something?”

“Of course.”

He took a deep breath.

Charles saw a ghost for the first time while playing in the backyard with his mom. Only, he didn’t realize it was a ghost. He thought it was funny that the yellow dog kept walking back and forth from the big tree to their back door.

When he perfectly described the dog that had died before he was born, was buried under the tree, and that he had absolutely not seen any pictures of, his mom brought him inside and prayed over him for hours.

Later, when he began talking about a “grey man” in the house, she beat him so badly that he was kept out of school for a week for fear of teachers taking notice. She started drinking, and her beatings became more and more frequent. Only, she got smarter about how she dished them out; she hit him in places where no one could see the evidence. She said she was beating the demons out of him.

He started hiding every time his mom drank, or when he knew she’d be coming home late from the bar. She’d walk into the house screaming his name. Sometimes, if he hid really well, it would take her an hour to find him. But she would never stop looking until she did.

“Even now,” he said, “part of me feels… loved. She always looked for me so hard. Like I mattered to her more than anything else in the world. She wanted to find me and beat me because she thought she could cure me. If she hated me she could have just kicked me out or killed me, you know? She never stopped looking, and she never stopped trying. Until she died.”

It happened when he was 12. She came home after a long night at the bar and found him quickly because he wasn’t hiding at all. He was sitting on the couch waiting for her.

She went to slap him, but when her arm was just an inch from his face, he caught her by the wrist, squeezed hard, looked her in the eyes, and told her \*no.\*

When she tried to hit him with her other hand, he caught that one too. He let go, and she tried to hit him again and again. Each time he stopped her. He didn’t hit her back, but for the first time, he defended himself. She ran to her room sobbing.

“I should’ve just hid,” he said. “She would’ve looked for me, and she would’ve found me, like always.”

But in the morning it was he who found her, dead in her bed. There was another her checking in closets and behind furniture.

“I’m right here,” he told her.

She turned.

“You found me.”

She walked toward him like she always did, eyes narrowed and fist raised to strike. But when she brought that fist down, it went swiftly through him like a knife through a thin layer of smoke. She tried to hit him again and again as she screamed like a banshee. 

He backed away. “Why do you want to hurt me!?”

“There’s a demon inside you! You need to stop talking to ghosts!” 

“You’re a ghost!”

He ran out of the house and called the police. But as he looked through the front window, he saw her peeking behind the TV with her arm reared back.

When he was done talking, I told him to hide, and that night I looked for him harder than ever.

For weeks after, almost every night, I’d search for him and we'd end up in bed. I didn’t particularly like the strange game of hide-and-seek, but I didn’t hate it either. It made him happy. I really did want him to be happy. Even if I didn’t love him like he loved me.

\\\*\\\*\\\*

One day, we were hiking through a trail he’d been begging to take me to for weeks. It was special to him, and he kept stopping to tell me facts about different plants and wildlife. It was so mind-numbingly boring. I kept trying to steer the conversation toward ghosts. I asked him if he could see any right now, or if he could sense any nearby, but all he would say was something like “that’s not how it works” before saying something about the trail. He had just finished explaining the lineage of some tree when I came right out and said it.

“I’m starting to get bored. Will you take me to see your mom?” 

I think we both knew that I was being intentionally vague about what exactly I was getting bored of. I could see the fear in his eyes.

He swallowed hard before answering. “Okay. But only once.”

\\\*\\\*\\\*

We went on a Wednesday in the early afternoon so that the family who lived there would all be at school or work. It was a square house on the corner of Bernard Street. Brown brick, three steps up to the patio and front door. We walked through the grass to the right side of the house and looked in through the kitchen windows.

While the house was foundationally no different from the average suburban home, the owners had made it their own in a way that was beautiful. The counter in front of the window held a yellow coffee mug with crudely drawn black lines meant to resemble a bee. The fridge was covered with crayon drawings and A+ grades. There were five chairs circled around the kitchen table.

When I looked over at Charles, his face was pressed against the glass, his breath fogged the space in front of his lips.

“Is she here?” I asked. “I don’t see her.”

Charles only nodded.

“What… what is she doing?”

“Just… walking.”

I closed my eyes and tried to imagine it. A cursed, phantom lady roaming the home, fist-raised, a fiery anger in her eyes as she hunted for her kid in a house full of others. I wondered if any of them ever saw her. Or if she saw them.

After a few moments Charles said, “We better get going before someone sees us,” and we began walking aimlessly down the street.

“Why do you think she’s still there?” I asked. 

“Trauma, I guess. Or purpose. Maybe they’re the same thing. I mean, I was my mom’s trauma, and her purpose was to stop me, right?”

“How come I can’t see her? And how come I can see the one on the street? I don’t understand.”

“I don’t either. But you’re not like me. I see ghosts all the time. You only see the one, right?”

“Yeah. But what’s so special about that one?”

“I don’t know. Maybe you’re connected somehow.” He paused for a moment before finishing. “Please don’t make me take you back here again.”

That night I looked for Charles, and when I found him, he cried so hard that I couldn’t do anything but just hold his head in my lap and brush his hair. It was the first time I felt guilty about us. Did he realize how transactional our relationship was? I thought he did. 

“I’m sorry,” I said, hoping he knew what I meant.

\\\*\\\*\\\*

Around that time, I found a full-time job as an SAT/ACT tutor. Charles was the first person I called when I got the news. 

“I’m so excited for you,” he said. “You deserve it so much, and I know you’ll do great. How about dinner tonight to celebrate?”

He pulled out all the stops. We had steak and wine, then chocolate cake for dessert. He kept telling me that I was so smart and so qualified. He said it so many times that I was starting to feel like he doubted it. 

At the end of the night he walked me to my car. When we were saying goodbye he looked at me so pleadingly, the way he did when he wanted me to go back to his place and find him. But he could tell that I was tired and he was too sweet to ask. Instead, he gave me a tight hug and squeezed my hand. 

I found myself enjoying my job and looking forward to sessions with students. For the first time in a while I felt as though I had a purpose: helping kids get into college. 

I spent so much more than 40 hours a week on my work. I made detailed plans for each student. I imagined how excited they would be when they finally got their goal scores. It took up almost all my time. I loved it. 

I still cared for Charles, but I was getting bored, and the newfound purpose made it hard to ignore the guilt.

So I began drifting away from him. We went from going to his apartment every day to hanging out once a week. Whenever we were together I had this heavy feeling in my chest, like I was mourning something. Once a week turned to every other week, and I could tell that he realized what was happening. Sometimes there were tears in his eyes when we parted ways. 

Eventually we were just texting every few days, like old college friends. 

How’s work?

Good. 

You?

Good. 

This continued for a while, but as I settled into the routine of my job, I was bored again. The students seemed to get dumber and less motivated over time. It was frustrating to explain the same thing over and over, week after week in all kinds of different ways. They just wouldn’t learn, and yet their parents blamed me when their scores didn’t increase. After a while, I decided there wasn’t a point in what I was doing after all. There was no purpose. Just a job.

I started going to see the street ghost on my own. I started to think of him as \*my\* ghost. My personal reminder that there was more to the world than test scores and bratty teenagers. I became braver, more used to him. I’d walk directly behind him, copying his every move. As we neared the old house, I’d close my eyes and keep walking, imagining that I was him, finishing the steps that he couldn’t. All the time I wondered what the ghost’s trauma was. 

But after a while I started to want more. It wasn’t fair. Why did Charles get to see all these ghosts all the time, and I only had the one?

So I reached out to him again. I texted him and waited a few days, but he didn’t answer. I couldn’t blame him. After all, the last text he’d sent me was asking if I wanted to get dinner. Two weeks later, and I’d never replied.

When I got tired of waiting, I drove to his apartment. I knocked on his door, waited a few minutes, then went home. I tried again the next day, and the next. Eventually I got angry. I treated him like a video game that wasn’t working. He was the reason I couldn’t have my fun, my excitement. And there was only one of him. I couldn’t go buy another copy. So, one day, after sitting outside his apartment for hours, I just… opened the door. 

I called his name. I shouted that it was me; I said I just wanted to make sure he was okay. He didn’t answer, so I walked inside and started looking.

I found myself checking all the places he used to hide back when we were together: behind the couch, in the bedroom closet, under his bed. When I walked into his bathroom, the smell hit me. He was lying in the tub, curled into a ball yet so flat that he was almost sinking into it. Trailing down his wrists were thick lines of dried blood that pooled underneath him. Sitting next to him was another Charles. He looked at me with a blank expression.

“You found me,” he said.

“Oh God,” I cried, falling back against the sink. “What happened to you?”

He didn’t answer.

“Why didn’t you tell me you were going to do this? I could have helped you, couldn’t I have?”

He didn’t respond.

“Why… why are you still here? Are you… like your mom, and the man on the street?”

“Things are different.”

“Are they better?”

He didn’t answer for so long that I almost asked again.

“No,” he said.

“Are you choosing to hide? Could you move on… somewhere else?”

“If I go, then who will find me?”

“I don’t know,” I said. “I’m sorry.”

He was silent after that. I had to fight the urge to break down and scream.

After some time he stood up and walked out of the bathroom. Slow and focused, like the ghost on the street.

I counted to 10.

When I found him behind the couch he smiled. 

“You found me.”

“Charles… isn’t… isn’t there a way for me to help you?”

But he was already looking for a new place to hide. 

\\\*\\\*\\\*

I still watch the man on the street. When I’m particularly sad, I follow him until he disappears, then I close my eyes and keep walking. I don’t pretend that I’m him anymore. I let the heat and the smell of death wash over me. I think of my future; I think of my past. I ask myself, sometimes over and over:

As I stood at the counter two of my regular customers were standing in line at the coffee machine, waiting for their coffee. They both look around their 50's, one was a woman and one was a man. 

They were both chatting and i could hear lots of laughter between them. Then i heard the man say to the woman, ""are you married?"" Then she was like, ""huh?"" And he was like, ""just wondering if you were single"". She immediately started blushing, then she started giggling. Then turned the question on him, ""are you married?"" Then he started giggling and was like, ""no i'm single"". She then smiled at him and was like, ""maybe i'll see you around"" then she walked out of the store without paying for her coffee lmao. 

The guy came up to the counter and i said to him i thought their exchange was so cute. His face lit up and was like, life is too short and thought id shoot my shot. I smiled at him and was like good for you. 

Half n hour later, that lady came back to the store apologising for leaving without paying for her coffee. Then she said she was distracted from the guy hitting her up. I told her yeah he was totally into you. She smiled and said man he was harmless and a nice guy. And then i told her she should go out with him. She started blushing and giggling again before leaving. Not outright saying yes or no. 

I thought both of them were so fucking cute and i hope they run into each other again and end up going on a date. That is assuming they are both actually single. ",12,1766021590.0,self,1,1.0,False

If it’s luxury, count me in. I understand that desire about myself, and honestly, it’s one of my biggest motivations to work as hard as I do. I want to afford the life I enjoy, and I put in the effort for it.

But in today’s world, that same desire earns me a label: gold digger. People assume that if a woman lives well, it must be because she’s attached to a wealthy man. Apparently, success doesn’t belong to us unless it’s sponsored.

The other day at the airport, I was holding my LV Ross luggage and my Chanel bag when I noticed two women beside me staring long, judgmental stares. As I shifted my luggage to move away, I heard one of them cough out  hoe,like it couldn’t possibly be about anyone else. For a split second, I imagined tearing her into pieces and listing her for sale on Alibaba. I didn’t, of course. I swallowed it and moved on.

And this isn’t a one time thing. It happens while traveling, grabbing coffee, shopping those lingering looks that say, She must have bagged herself a rich man.

Why can’t I be seen as my own sponsor? Why does luxury automatically erase my hard work? If I’m not a celebrity, am I not allowed to live well on my own terms?

So me and my bf has been dating for four months and it’s been going pretty smooth apart from one fight that we solved. 

It’s been pretty much just going better and better since we had that argument and we are developing as a couple, and I’m starting to really really like him a lot to the point I could envision something very long term with this guy. Possibly even children. Even though it’s crazy and somewhat far in the future. 

But, I’ve been feeling very conflicted about something. His female friend, I’ll call her ‘Homegirl’ cause that’s what he calls her.

They’ve been friends before we met, not that long, only five days. But they’re very close and he describes his relationship with her as ‘one of the friends he can be himself with’. Which I think it’s great. Sometimes I hang out with her too for coffee and she’s very sweet and friendly, but, she’s also very self destructive, anxious and needs approval of people (especially guys) which I believe comes from her lack of a healthy relationship so far.

Either way they snap everyday, talk everyday or every other day, sometimes she’d call him and sometimes they hang out one and one. sure it’s not my business what they’re up to but it’s making me a bit uncomfortable. Especially today when I found out she’s been at the hospital but didn’t tell me, but my boyfriend and then ranted to him about her fear and her lack of eating, which my boyfriend happily wanted to help comfort her with.

She straight up stopped snapping me however almost a month ago, but never has stopped snapping him. She also claims whenever they’re together she tries to stay close to him, and she also says she adores him.

At the same time my boyfriend says he’d block her if she tried, while she says she’d never get with a taken guy, but I am still feeling very uncomfortable and confused.

Here is scientific evidence and all the science of it.,"You know, sometimes I just sit and look at the sky and think, how did we even get here? It’s crazy when you really stop to think about it. We literally came out of nothing. Just empty space and then, boom, stars, planets, and eventually, us. It feels like magic, but it’s actually this wild mix of physics and luck. Think about the very beginning, the Big Bang. If things had been just a tiny bit different, like if gravity was a little stronger or a little weaker, the universe would have just collapsed back on itself or flown apart so fast that no stars could ever form. But it didn't. It was perfect. It was exactly what it needed to be for us to be here right now. That alone is enough to make you dizzy. We are made of stardust, quite literally. The carbon in our cells, the iron in our blood, it was all cooked inside giant burning stars that exploded billions of years ago. We are the universe waking up and looking at itself.

And then you get to the math of it all, and honestly, it’s terrifying how small the chances are. I read somewhere that the odds of you being born (specifically *you*, with your DNA, your parents, their parents, going all the way back) is basically zero. It’s like throwing a dart at a board the size of the entire galaxy and hitting a specific grain of sand. Think about your ancestors. All of them. Every single one of them had to survive wars, diseases, famines, and accidents long enough to have children. If just one of your great-great-great-grandfathers had turned left instead of right one day, or if one specific sperm didn't meet one specific egg, you wouldn't be here. You are the result of a winning streak that has lasted for millions of years. You are the champion of survival just by breathing air today. That isn't just luck; that feels like destiny.

Biologically, you are a masterpiece. Do you know what is happening inside you right now? It’s a bustling city. Trillions of cells are working together, communicating, fighting off bad bacteria, repairing damage, and keeping your heart beating without you even asking them to. Your DNA is this long, complex code, a library of instructions that is unique to you. No one else in the history of the universe has had your exact mix. You are a limited edition of one. It’s amazing that this wet, squishy biological machine can think, dream, love, and wonder about its own existence. We aren't just rocks or water; we are matter that has learned to feel. That is the most precious thing in the universe. A rock can last a long time, but it can’t feel the sun on its face or the warmth of a hug. We can.

So, why do we waste so much time worrying about things that don't matter? We get stressed about traffic, or money, or what someone said on the internet. But when you look at the big picture, those things are tiny. We need to be in the now. Right now. Take a deep breath. Feel the air filling your lungs. That sensation? That is the prize. That is what the universe worked for 13.8 billion years to create. Being alive is the rarest thing there is. Most of the universe is dead, cold, empty space. But here, on this little blue rock, there is life. And you are part of it. You have a front-row seat to the greatest show in existence. Don't spend the show looking at your phone. Watch the show. Enjoy the colors, the tastes, the feelings.

This brings me to the philosophy of it all. If we are this rare, if we are this unlikely, then our lives have immense value. We aren't just random accidents; we are the custodians of consciousness. If we disappear, the universe goes back to being dark and silent. We are the lights. And that means we have a huge responsibility. We have to protect life. Not just our own, but all life. Every tree, every animal, every other human. We are all connected in this fragile web. When we hurt nature, we are hurting the only home we have ever known. We need to realize that we are all on the same team. It’s not us against them; it’s us against the void. It’s us against non-existence. We have to be the guardians of this rare flame called life.

And you know what? I think we should fight for more time. Why do we accept death so easily? For thousands of years, humans have just said, ""Well, that's life, you get old and you go."" But why? We have brains that can figure out how to fly to the moon and how to split the atom. Why can't we figure out how to keep these amazing bodies healthy forever? Imagine if you didn't have to get old and weak. Imagine if you could have the wisdom of a 100-year-old but the energy of a 20-year-old. Think of all the books you could read, the places you could see, the people you could love if you had unlimited time. Life is too beautiful to be so short. We shouldn't just accept that we have an expiration date. We should be angry about it. We should be working day and night to solve the problem of aging.

Some people say that death gives life meaning, but I don't buy that. Does a sunset stop being beautiful because the sun comes up again tomorrow? No. Love is beautiful because it feels good, not because it ends. Learning is fun because we grow, not because we stop. If we lived for a thousand years, or forever, think of what we could achieve. We could fix the planet. We could explore the stars. We could become beings of pure energy and wisdom. We are just at the beginning of our story. We are basically toddlers in the cosmic scale. We haven't even left our crib yet. We need to stay alive long enough to grow up and see what we are truly capable of.

We need to change our mindset. We need to stop thinking of ourselves as temporary visitors and start thinking of ourselves as the permanent owners of our destiny. Defeat death. It sounds like a sci-fi movie, but it’s the ultimate goal of medicine and science. Every time a doctor cures a disease, they are fighting death. Every time we put on a seatbelt, we are fighting death. We just need to take it to the next level. We need to declare war on the idea that we have to fade away. Because you are too important to lose. The statistical miracle that is you should not be erased. The universe tried too hard to make you to just let you go.

So, please, look around you today. Look at the leaves on the trees, look at the smile of a friend, taste your coffee, listen to music. Absorb it all. This is it. This is the magic. Don't let a single day slip by without acknowledging how crazy it is that you are here to experience it. We came from nothing, we beat the odds, and now we are here. Let's not go back to nothing. Let's stay. Let's protect this gift with everything we have. Let's support science, let's love one another, and let's push for a future where life doesn't have to end.

You are a miracle. A one-in-a-trillion-trillion-trillion accident that turned into a beautiful, thinking, feeling being. Don't ever let anyone tell you you aren't special. The physics says you are. The math proves you are. The biology shows you are. Now, it’s up to your philosophy to believe it and to live like it matters. Because it does. It matters more than anything else. Stay young in your heart, fight for your life, and let's try to make this ride last forever. We owe it to the stardust we are made of.

Let's really get into the details now, because when you look at the hard facts, it becomes even more overwhelming. I want to break down exactly why you are the most improbable thing in the universe, and why that fact should light a fire inside you to live forever.

Physicists call it the ""Goldilocks Universe."" It’s not too hot, not too cold, just right. But it’s more than just temperature. There are these fundamental constants in nature: numbers that define how gravity works, how atoms stick together, how light moves. If the force of gravity was slightly stronger, the universe would have crunched down into a ball instantly after the Big Bang. No galaxies, no Earth, no you. If the ""strong nuclear force"" (which holds atoms together) was a tiny bit weaker, the only element in the universe would be hydrogen. You can't build a human out of just hydrogen. You need carbon, oxygen, nitrogen. The universe had to be tuned with impossible precision to allow complex matter to exist. It’s like balancing a pencil on its tip and having it stay there for a billion years. That is the tightrope walk that reality is doing right now just so you can sit there and read this.

Let’s talk numbers again because the math of you being born is staggering. Let's just look at the last generation. Your mom has about 100,000 eggs. Your dad produces about 120 million sperm every single time. The chances of that *one* specific sperm meeting that *one* specific egg is roughly one in 400 quadrillion. And that’s just for your parents! Now multiply that probability by your grandparents, and their parents, and so on. Go back 10 generations, and you have over 2,000 ancestors. Go back further, to the first humans. They had to survive Ice Ages, saber-toothed tigers, plagues, and starvation. If one guy 5,000 years ago decided to sleep in because it was raining and didn't meet his wife at the river, your entire family line vanishes. The chain breaks. You don't exist. The probability of you existing is basically 1 divided by infinity. In any other version of reality, you aren't here. But in this one, you won the lottery every single day for thousands of years.

Your body is the most advanced technology on Earth. Nothing we have built (no computer, no robot, no factory) comes close to the complexity of you. You have about 37 trillion cells in your body. To give you an idea of how big that number is, 37 trillion seconds is over 1 million years. Inside every single one of those cells is DNA. If you uncoiled the DNA in your body and stretched it out, it would reach from the Earth to the Sun and back hundreds of times. That is how much information you are carrying.
And think about your brain. You have 86 billion neurons. The number of connections between them is more than the number of stars in the Milky Way galaxy. Your brain is literally a universe of its own. It generates enough electricity to power a lightbulb. It processes images, sounds, memories, and emotions instantly. It heals itself. Your skin replaces itself every month. Your bones regenerate. You are a self-repairing, self-aware biological miracle. How can we look at this amazing machine and say, ""Yeah, it’s okay if it breaks down and dies in 80 years""? That’s a waste! That is a tragedy. We should be treating our bodies like the temples they are and using every tool of science to keep them running indefinitely.

Because the odds are so low, and the biology is so complex, the present moment is the only thing that is real. The past is just a memory, a ghost. The future hasn't happened yet. All you have is *now*. The feeling of your feet on the floor. The smell of rain. The taste of food. This is where life happens.
Too many of us live in our heads. We worry about ""what if"" or regret ""what was."" But when you do that, you are missing the miracle. You are disrespecting the odds. Imagine you won a billion dollars, but instead of spending it and having fun, you just sat in a room worrying about losing it. That’s what we do with life. We need to wake up. Look at a flower: really look at it. See the geometry in the petals. That flower has evolved for millions of years just to look like that. Look at the stars. The light hitting your eye left those stars years ago, maybe even before you were born. You are connecting with the cosmos.
To ""be in the now"" isn't just some hippie saying; it’s the only logical response to the data. If existence is rare, experience is valuable. Every second of boredom is a wasted treasure. Every moment of joy is a victory against the void.

This is the controversial part, but it shouldn't be. Why do we accept death? We view it as ""natural,"" but smallpox was natural. Polio was natural. Being eaten by a lion is natural. We humans don't do ""natural."" We build houses, we wear clothes, we cook food, we fly in planes. We overcome nature constantly. Death is just a technical problem. It’s the breakdown of cells, the accumulation of waste, the errors in DNA copying. These are problems that can be solved.
There are jellyfish that are biologically immortal: they can revert back to their baby stage and grow up again, over and over. There are sharks that live for 400 years. The biology for extreme longevity exists on this planet. We just need to figure out how to apply it to us.
Imagine a world where you don't have to rush. You don't have to panic about your ""biological clock."" You could spend 50 years learning to play the piano perfectly. Then spend another 50 years studying marine biology. Then another 50 just traveling the world. You could see your great-great-great-grandchildren grow up. You could see humanity travel to Mars.
Some people say, ""Oh, I'd get bored."" really? With the whole universe to explore? With infinite books, movies, games, and people to meet? I don't think so. I think we are starved for time. We are just getting good at life when we are forced to leave. It’s not fair.
We need to support the science of longevity. We need to take care of our health (eat right, exercise, sleep) not just to look good, but to buy time until the technology arrives to keep us young forever. We need to protect life because life is the exception to the rule. The universe wants chaos; life is order. The universe wants cold; life is warmth. We are the resistance.

So, here is the bottom line. You are not just a person. You are a statistical impossibility. You are a universe of atoms that has come together to create a soul. You are the result of star explosions, lucky breaks, and billions of years of survival.

Do not waste this. Do not let the small stuff grind you down. Do not let hate or fear cloud your vision. You have a golden ticket.

Protect life. Protect the environment, because without it, our biology fails. Protect each other, because we are all in this same fragile boat. And most importantly, protect your own future. Reject the idea that you have to die. Rage against the dying of the light. embrace the science, embrace the hope, and live every single day like the miracle it is.
Be here. Be now. Be alive. And let’s try to stay that way forever.",18,1766021422.0,immortalists,3,0.92,False

I have fasted for 6 days (144hr) before but I haven’t tried to pass this until now. It would be a week fast 170ish hours (depending on when we have Christmas dinner but probably around 2-3pm) 

Do you think it will be okay to refeed on Christmas dinner? I thought I can also eat kiwis too (kiwis makes me have regular bms so I’m thinking it will help wake things up for going) last time I fasted for 6 days I didn’t have a bm until like 3 days after I broke, and even then it was barely anything. Sorry for the tmi but this issue has kept me from going pass a 4 day fast. But I want to challenge myself now. 

And I will do it properly with a lot of water and electrolytes when needed. And obviously black coffee. 

Any tips? On fasting for a week or refeeding or bm after a week fast? ",5,1766021398.0,fasting,1,1.0,False

Parking: The parking lot is pretty big for the amount of rooms at this hotel, especially since this is a smaller scale property. Overall, pretty average for a Hyatt House, no covered parking but plenty of spaces close to the lobby.  
Check-In/First Impressions: The vibe does feel like you are in a ""house"" or more of an apartment complex. The check-in desks were pretty simple however the staff were pretty efficient. There was also nice drinks and snacks for purchase, free breakfast, the H Bar which was closed during our stay, and lovely seating areas around the hotel. The elevators were pretty functional though the hallways to the rooms were pretty dirty.  
Room: I had a 1 king bed studio suite at the Hyatt, and I was pretty impressed. It was spacious, and had a total of two TVs. There is a kitchen with basic amenities, a huge sofa with a pretty large TV, a nice king bed with a wall hanging TV, and a good closet and bathroom space. One really big compliment I would give to the room was that everything was super clean, and the bathroom was the cleanest I have ever seen. It felt like this was a brand new room in a grand opening of a hotel, it was cleaned thoroughly.  
Dining: Unfortunately, the HBar, which was the hotels restaurant was closed during our visit. However, we did grab breakfast every day at the complimentary breakfast buffet for guests. The breakfast tasted great, with orange juice, breakfast potatoes, french toast, scrambled eggs, coffee, and breads available and whatever I had tasted great. The French Toast and Breakfast Potatoes were my personal favorite.  
Amenities & Activities: Other than a basic pool and fitness center, the hotel doesn't really have many amenities. The service was pretty basic though they thoroughly cleaned my room. The location is pretty good on the main street and is close to Guadalupe National Park and Carlsbad Caverns National Park, while not being too far away from other points like Sitting Bull Falls and other restaurants in Carlsbad.  
Final Thoughts: For only $108, this is 100% the best hotel in Carlsbad New Mexico. It is the best option with modern rooms, good service, and great cleanliness throughout my stay. It is a really great price for a really large room and it was a great stay. I would 100% revisit this property if I had to stay in Carlsbad again.

Whether I was waiting for a 2-hour OS install to finish, watching a console for a specific error code, or just afraid of missing a message on my work PC, I was stuck glueing my eyes to the video stream.

So I built a tool to do the staring for me.

**PiKVM Watcher** is a Chrome extension that turns your ""dumb"" KVM video stream into a smart sensor.

You just draw a blue box around any part of the screen (like a console output line or a notification area) and tell it what to watch for. When it sees that text, it triggers.

**Possibilities are pretty wild:**

* 🚀 **Installations:** Go make coffee. The tool will ping your phone (via Discord/Slack webhook) the second the screen says ""Installation Complete"".
* 🚨 **Crash Detection:** Watch your server console for the word ""Panic"" or ""Error"" and get alerted instantly.
* 🔔 **Work Remote:** Catch Teams/Slack notifications even if audio isn't passing through.
* 🤖 **Home Automation:** Trigger a webhook to dim your lights or sound an alarm when a specific event happens on your remote screen.

It requires **zero software** on the target machine. It all runs in your browser.
