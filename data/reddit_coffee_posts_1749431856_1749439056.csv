1l6ui4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1l6ui4d/morality_and_values_are_inherently_subjective/,Morality and values are inherently subjective,"Going off [this philosophical usage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity_and_objectivity_(philosophy)) for ""subjective"" and ""objective"":

>Something is subjective if it is dependent on a mind (biases, perception, emotions, opinions, imagination, or conscious experience). If a claim is true exclusively when considering the claim from the viewpoint of a sentient being, it is subjectively true. For example, one person may consider the weather to be pleasantly warm, and another person may consider the same weather to be too hot; both views are subjective.

>Something is objective if it can be confirmed independently of a mind. If a claim is true even when considering it outside the viewpoint of a sentient being, then it may be labelled objectively true.

I just made myself a cup of coffee and put it on the kitchen scales. The weight of the mug plus the coffee inside of it is 624 grams.

If I left the mug there and then some all-powerful entity Thanos-snapped every being with a conscious experience out of existence, that kitchen scale would continue showing that reading until the batteries run out, with an occasional tick down as the water in the coffee evaporates and reduces the mass over time.

So the mass of the mug and the coffee inside of it can be confirmed independently of a mind. Those are objective properties of the mug and the coffee.

I value the mug. I mostly value it instrumentally, because I can use that mug to drink coffee. I value the coffee directly, because I enjoy drinking it.

If some all-powerful entity Thanos-snapped me out of existence, the ""I"" in that sentence, the ""me"", would cease to exist. I would from that point no longer be able to value anything. So I would cease to exist, and from my mind vanishing from the world so too would the sense of value my mind finds in the world.

So the value I find in the mug and the coffee inside of it can only be confirmed dependent on my mind. Those are subjective properties. As a semantic choice, we could call that either a subjective property of my mind *or* a subjective property of the mug and coffee, depending on how much fluffing around we want to do with the definitions.

I also value the abolition of slavery. Without exception. Yes I know. That's very brave of me. /s

But I do. As a core value, I oppose slavery without exception. I oppose it now, every time it has been implemented in the past, and every way in which it could be implemented in the future. 

Like the mug, this is an instrumental value because it is a consequence of some more deeply held values, such as the dignity of the individual and the freedom of all sentient being to pursue a life of flourishing and away from maximal suffering for everyone, yadda yadda yadda.

If some being snapped me out of existence, the sense of value I find in opposition to slavery would cease to exist. But other people hold that value too, so in that sense the value would continue to exist in them. But if that being snapped every being with a mind out of existence, the valuing of opposing slavery would cease to exist from the universe.

The values of opposing slavery and supporting the abolition of slavery is dependent of the minds of the people doing the opposing and supporting.

If we look at the world and observe humans engaged in *doing morality* and describe what we see, what we find is humans getting together, arguing/discussing what moral norms to adopt until a consensus is formed. Then that set of moral norms becomes the standard in that community. From time to time they go back and argue/discuss it some more, and sometimes that leads to changes or subcommunities with different sets of moral norms. Over time the consensus changes.

Descriptively speaking, that's what we see happening. If we look at humans *doing morality* and adjust the utterance ""morality"" to point at what is actually taking place in the world (seems reasonable to me), then by that usage that's what morality is.

The ways in which different groups of people do that process varies from place to place. Sometimes mountains and stone tablets are involved. But at its core, morality could either mean the set of norms enacted themselves (i.e. ""a morality"" => ""a moral code"") or it could be the process or school of thought around how moral codes are or even should be formed.

A core part of that process involves values, it involves beings with minds, and language, and cultures as the abstraction of the sum total of the worldviews and attitudes of the minds that make up those cultures, and the moral norms enacted and enforced as part of those cultures.

Snap all the conscious minds out of existence, and all of that vanishes from the ground up: Values, thought, discussion, and the norms themselves? All gone.

Therefore: Morality and values are inherently subjective.

# What would convince me that I'm wrong?

Reasonable question! People don't ask it of themselves enough.

Showing this to be false is pretty straightforward. Just like with the mass of the mug earlier, we just need a way to objectively verify that a value or a moral norm could continue to exist in the absence of any conscious experience to hold them. In the case of the mass of the coffee (now half drunk) that can be done through a direct measurement: The kitchen scales slowly counting down as the water evaporates, faithfully reporting that objective mass measurement to a universe bereft of any minds able to appreciate that service.

Problem is that I don't think values or norms are the kind of thing that we can measure in that way. Then again, maybe there is a method and I haven't thought of it yet, so if someone can come up with something, that would be one pathway in to changing my mind.

Setting direct measurement aside, we could do the logic and reason thing, and objectively verify a moral norm or a value the way that we do mathematical statements. It does seem to be the case that, for a robust set of axioms about things like numbers and addition, that 1+1 = 2 is true independently of any conscious being holding that thought in their mind.

But I also struggle with that one, because on some level it would boil down to something like:

1. If you value X, then you ought to do X.
2. You value X.
3. Therefore, you ought to do X.

Obviously that's gratuitously oversimplifying things. But I see *something like this* would be needed in any attempt to do this, and in the absence of the ""You"" in ""You value X"" that makes the premises of the syllogism true (or a ""for all persons"" or ""there exists some person"" or something like that) I just can't see how you could bootstrap something up to get to that conclusion being true.

But like I said with the measurement thing: Just because I can't think of a way to do it, doesn't mean it can't be done. Maybe someone else can work that one out in a way I've not seen before. Open to hearing it if it's a good one.

# Common Objection: Who are you to say...

Whenever I raise this with someone, the common objective seems to be: But what about someone else whose values are that slavery is permissible? If you say slavery is wrong, and they say it is permissible, then who is to say that you are right and they are wrong? How can your claims about slavery being wrong be binding on anyone else if it isn't objective?

Who gets to say that you are right, and the pro-slavery people are wrong?

There's three answers to this.

1. The first is that, even if we suppose the objective morality does exist, that doesn't make it binding or solve the problem of who gets to say what is right or wrong.
   * In the American Civil War, both sides had people who put forward arguments for why their side was correct about slavery being objectively wrong or objectively permissible.
   * Even when both sides agree that God exists and gets to say what is right or wrong, they still disagreed over what God's opinion actually was.
   * That's why it's called the American Civil War, and not the American Civil Debate About The Objective Morality Of Slavery.
   * Supposing objective morality isn't binding on people either, and all it does is push the ""who gets to say"" question back a step to ""who gets to say which objective argument is correct?"" So if that's a problem for subjective morality, then it's a problem for ""objective morality"" too.
2. The second is that I strongly suspect that *most of the time* the people who say that they think slavery is permissible aren't being consistent to their own most deeply held values.
   * It's a little bit like that thing where someone who is a serial cheater in relationships eventually gets cheated on and then condemns cheating without a shred of self-awareness.
   * Working out what your core values actually are and converting those into a set of moral norms that embody those values is really tricky.
   * People have a tendency to act in short-term interest in ways that go against their deeply held values.
   * I think that *in practice* a lot of the time the people who say that slavery is permissible would, if they were willing and able to be really frank and honest about their most deeply held values, have to change their position on slavery.
   * I think that a lot of the squarking pro-slavery people give to things like selectively reading religious texts to justify the view that slavery is permissible is in large part an attempt to silence that part of their own subjectively held values that would otherwise tell them that slavery is wrong.
   * So the second answer is: In practice I think that most of the time, they themselves would say that slavery is wrong if only they were willing/able to be more consistent to their own deeply held values!
3. But even if we suppose *in principle* someone who is pro-slavery in a way that is internally consistent with themselves, the third answer is: We are.
   * If those of us who want to see slavery abolished and stay abolished are to succeed, then the people who want to see slavery continue or increase in prevalence have to fail.
   * The reverse is true for them in their view of us.
   * Where it's possible to persuade someone who is accepting of slavery out of their views, I think that's a good thing.
   * But there *is* a fundamental struggle here, and persuasion isn't going to succeed on everyone.
   * The key problem of that struggle is not *how to objectively justify it*.
   * The key problem of that struggle is *how to win it*.
   * It is indeed the case that the dispassionate view that tries to look at the world from an ""objective"" perspective that has no preference for one subjectively held value over another cannot find a way to justify one or the other.
   * This isn't a sign that there is a flaw in opposing slavery.
   * Rather it is a sign that there is a flaw in that attempt to solve the problem.
   * A bit like asking a physicist to come up with the equations for performing heart surgery, it's not a fundamentally flawed approach, merely the wrong approach for that problem domain.
   * And as described above: Even if an ""objective"" basis for opposing slavery could be provided, that wouldn't make much of a difference in the cause of actually winning that struggle, so it's kind of useless.",1,1749438834.0,DebateReligion,1,1.0,False

[[Explore Top Rated rv water filter system on Amazon.]](https://site.trendsupplier.com/clearance-products/?kw=rv water filter system)

## Key Features Analysis

The best RV water filter systems share several critical features, contributing to their effectiveness and user-friendliness.

**Filtration Capacity and Stages**

The filtration capacity​ refers to the total volume of water the system can effectively filter before requiring filter replacement. Multi-stage filtration is crucial for removing a wide spectrum of contaminants. Systems often incorporate sediment filters, carbon filters, and ​specialized filters⁢ for removing‍ bacteria and heavy metals. A high-capacity system will reduce the frequency of filter changes, but ‌it's essential to‍ balance capacity with filtration effectiveness. Stages ⁤can range from 1-stage to 4-stage filtration; ‌the higher the ​stage, the more filtration levels will be provided, as well as a greater range of removal of sediment, bacteria, contaminants, and heavy‌ metals.

**Flow​ Rate**

The ⁣flow rate, measured in gallons per minute (GPM), determines ‍how ‌quickly water can pass through ‌the‌ filter⁢ without significantly reducing water ​pressure. A sufficient flow rate is vital for comfortable showering‍ and efficient use of appliances. Systems with low flow ‍rates can result in frustratingly slow water delivery, ‍while systems with higher ‍flow rates ensure adequate water⁣ pressure across your RV. Aim ‌for a flow rate that meets your RV's plumbing demands, typically between 2.5 and 4 GPM for single-RV usage.

**Filter cartridge Lifespan and Replacement**

Filter cartridge lifespan varies depending on the system and the quality​ of the water being filtered. ⁣Regular filter replacement is essential for maintaining optimal performance. Some‌ systems offer convenient filter replacement indicators, while others rely on a time-based schedule or visual inspection. Consider the cost and ease of acquiring replacement filters when choosing a system. Look for readily⁣ available and reasonably priced filter cartridges to minimize ⁤long-term operating costs.

**Housing Material and Durability**

The housing material should be robust and resistant to damage from temperature fluctuations and pressure changes. Common materials include BPA-free plastics and stainless steel. A durable housing protects the filter cartridges from physical ⁣damage and prevents leaks. Inspect the housing⁢ for quality construction and secure connections to ensure long-term reliability. A system with a sturdy housing will withstand the rigors of⁤ RV travel and harsh ⁢environmental conditions.

**Portability and Ease of Installation**

For RV use, portability is essential. Look for systems that are compact‌ and easy to connect to your‌ water source. Simple​ installation procedures minimize downtime and allow for fast setup at campgrounds. Consider the system's weight and dimensions to ensure it fits comfortably in⁢ your RV's storage compartment. Systems with quick-connect fittings and clear instructions simplify the installation ⁣process,even for novice RVers.

**NSF Certification**

NSF International certification indicates that the filter system has been tested and certified to meet specific performance standards for reducing contaminants and improving water quality. Look for NSF certifications for contaminant reduction, material safety, and structural integrity. NSF certification⁣ provides assurance ⁤that the system performs as advertised and consistently delivers clean and safe water.

## ‌FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked​ questions about RV water filter systems.

**How often should I replace my RV water filter cartridge?**

the⁢ recommended filter replacement frequency ⁢depends on⁢ the​ specific system and the quality of the water being filtered.Most manufacturers recommend replacing⁤ filters ‍every 3 to ⁤6 months, or‌ after a certain number of gallons have been⁤ filtered. Regularly check the filter for signs of clogging or reduced performance,⁣ and replace it as needed.

**Can I use an​ RV⁤ water ‌filter system for‌ well water?**

Yes, but it's important‍ to choose a system that⁤ is ⁣specifically designed for well water. Well water frequently enough contains higher levels of sediment, iron, and bacteria than city water. Look for‍ a ⁣system with a⁤ multi-stage⁢ filtration⁣ process that includes sediment filtration, iron reduction, and⁣ disinfection capabilities. Regular testing of⁣ your well water is ‍also recommended⁣ to ensure that the ‍filter system is effectively removing contaminants.

**What is the difference between a whole-house and an inline RV water filter?**

A whole-house RV water ‍filter is⁢ installed at the main water inlet and filters all the water entering the RV. An inline⁢ filter is connected to the water​ hose between the water ‌source and the RV. Whole-house systems ‌offer comprehensive filtration for all water uses, while inline filters are more portable⁢ and easier to install. The choice depends on your specific needs ⁤and preferences; if you prefer to only filter water for ⁤drinking, bathing, and cooking, an⁣ inline rv ⁢water filter will suffice.

**Does an RV water filter remove viruses?**

Most standard RV water filters do not remove viruses. To remove viruses, you need a filter system that includes ⁤a disinfection⁣ stage, such as ultraviolet (UV) sterilization or a filter specifically designed ‍to remove viruses.These types of systems are more expensive and may require​ additional power; however, they can provide⁣ an extra level of protection against waterborne pathogens.

June 6, 2025: The clock struck 12 and I turned 25. I was anticipating a lot of birthday greetings and messages from my friends and family. I wasn’t expecting to hear from V because we ended our relationship on terrible terms. In fact, she was the first person to send birthday wishes my way. I don’t want to address V as my ex. I still consider her my woman.

I called V at 3:30 am, the only time she gets to be peaceful because she has a lot of situations going on with her lately. I spoke to her for 2 hours. I wept, and she did too. I told her that I need her and yes, I actually do. She hung up the call and sent me a message that read, “Could you work from home today? I want to come meet you.” I replied, “Okay. I will,” as I was wiping my tears with my hands. We decided to meet somewhere private.

I was yearning for a day like this. I brought breakfast for the two of us. I was keenly listening to the movement of the elevator, keeping the door ajar, strolling from one corner to the other. 

There she was, right in front of my eye, a surreal moment. I was shivering. I held her hands. I embraced her and the moment. I kissed her all over the face. I saw her up close after 2 long months; the sight I’ll never forget.

We caught up from where we left off. I was jumping around with joy. I showed her my work progress and a few other things I’d been up to. She was happy about it, but there was a hidden grimace on her face. She shared everything that’s been happening with her. She is going through a lot, and yet she remains intact and takes care of her sibling and her mom.

I thought V wanted to get back together when she suggested that we meet, but she said she was with me only because she didn’t want me to be alone on my birthday. V had her reasons to end our relationship — valid ones — but I want her real bad. When I told her that I want to make things right, she said she doesn’t have anything to give me because she’s become numb and burned out from what she’s been going through. She said she can never get back with me. At the end of the day, I talked her into at least giving it a thought — no matter how long it takes for her to reach a decision.

I want V for myself. I can’t lose her to someone else like in the movies, meeting after decades and sitting together, taking a trip down memory lane to laugh and cry at the moments we had when we were together. I'd rather prefer to remember those times over coffee on our lawn in the evening. I’m sure she’ll come back to me. The two of us are equally hurt, but I want to give our relationship another chance.

V, if you're reading this, just remember that all the worries you have now will pass. I want to stand next to you, but you won’t let me do that. I believe you're strong enough to fight them all alone, but if you ever need me, I’ll come to you. I find my solace in you

Love,

I started reading this subreddit posts before I even began my PMP journey, and they helped me plan realistically. I initially gave myself 6 months, with this timeline in mind:
	•	1 month for the 35 PDU course
	•	2 months for Study Hall practice
	•	Then book the exam (expecting a 2–3 month wait) and keep practicing until the test date.

But things moved faster than expected.

I started with Andrew Ramdayal’s Udemy course, and it was way more flowy than I imagined. I was able to finish it in just 10 days, watching lectures for 2–3 hours a day. One hour each during my morning and evening commute to work another 30-60mins before bed at night. 

Right after, I dove into Study Hall. daily mini-quizzes before and after work. I also watched David McLachlan’s YouTube videos during my lunch breaks. 
That’s all you need. AR+DM+SH. 
AR and DM help to get your foundation strong while SH prepares you for the real exam. One wouldn’t work without the other. 

Weekends were for full-length SH mock exams.
My first full mock was brutal. I ran out of time and ended up scoring only 59%. I was mentally exhausted and couldn’t even process the last 20-30 questions. Spent the whole day feeling defeated. I realized it was a really long time since I spent a continuous 3 hours writing an exam. And my brain was not prepared for it 🥲.
Back to Reddit I went, for encouragement and strategies. That’s when I realized: taking the exam the right way is just as important as knowing the stuff.

So, the following weekend, I approached it differently.
Simulated the exact exam conditions: same time blocks, scheduled breaks, even prepped a thermos of coffee and a bottle of water. My break routine:
	•	100 ml water
	•	Quick restroom break
	•	150 ml hot coffee
	•	Deep breaths for 2 minutes
All under 10 minutes.

That mental and physical reset made a difference.  A huge difference! From then on, I could score 75-85 consistently in the next 4 full mocks.

Once I completed all 5 SH+ mocks, I went to book my exam, expecting a 2–3 month wait. But there was a slot in 2 days 😳.
Though I’m the over-preparing type, I knew extending this any further would only burn me out. So I took the leap. Booked it. 
I carried the thermos with hot coffee and a 500ml water bottle. Kept them in the locker. Followed the same break routine. 

That moment when the lady in front desk took out the print from the printer and gave it to me: it felt surreal. 

And… AT in all domains! What a relief 😅 


It’s been a couple of months now. I had to go right back to the chaos of my life but.. Reddit played a huge role in my journey, so I wanted to pay it forward. So here I am, though a little late. 

If you’re juggling work, family and life chaos and wondering if it’s possible….yes, it is! One focused step at a time. Simulate the real exam. Practice smart. And take that leap. You got this.

Hey everyone!

If you're looking to make your English more descriptive and engaging, this post is for you! Instead of dry grammar lessons, we're going to think of **grammar as adjectives** – tools to paint vivid pictures with your words. And what better place to practice than the vibrant, incredible city of **Melbourne**?

# Why Adjectives? They're the Secret Sauce! ✨

Think of adjectives as the sprinkles on a cupcake or the vibrant colors in a rainbow. They add detail, make your sentences more interesting, and help your reader truly *feel* what you're describing. We'll use Melbourne's iconic spots to see exactly how they work their magic.

**Here's a taste:**

* **City Vibes:** Imagine strolling through **bustling** laneways, smelling **aromatic** coffee, and soaking in the **lively** atmosphere. Melbourne's known for its **exceptional** coffee and those **quaint** cafes offer an **unforgettable** experience. (*Example: ""The* ***narrow, cobbled*** *laneway was filled with the* ***rich, inviting*** *scent of* ***freshly brewed*** *coffee.""*) See how those words make you feel like you're there?
* **Amazing Sights:** Get **breathtaking** views from the **imposing** Eureka Tower. Explore Melbourne's laneways with their **colorful** street art and **historic** buildings. Adjectives help us truly **see** the city.
* **Culture Fun:** Melbourne is Australia's culture capital, hosting **diverse** festivals, a **thriving** art scene, and **spectacular** events like the **prestigious** Australian Open.

# Quick Dive: Different Kinds of Adjectives

We'll touch on these, but the main goal is to use them!

* **Descriptive:** (e.g., *colorful, historic, aromatic*) – What does it look like?
* **Quantitative:** (e.g., *largest, many, few*) – How much?
* **Demonstrative:** (e.g., *this, that, these, those*) – Pointing things out.
* **Possessive:** (e.g., *its, their, my*) – Showing ownership.
* **Proper:** (e.g., *Australian Open, Victorian architecture*) – Come from names.

# Fun Melbourne Facts (with Adjectives!)

* Melbourne boasts the world's **largest** tram network – a **unique** and **convenient** way to get around!
* The weather is **unpredictable**, so you might experience all four seasons in one **single** day.
* The **magnificent** Royal Exhibition Building is a **historic** UNESCO World Heritage Site.

# Your Turn! Be a Travel Blogger! ✍️

**Coda: The curious case of Tammy Leakey – March 12, 1981**

\[ Information Gathered from: [https://theresaallore.com/2016/03/24/coda-the-curious-case-of-tammy-leakey-march-12-1981/](https://theresaallore.com/2016/03/24/coda-the-curious-case-of-tammy-leakey-march-12-1981/) \]

A lot of information on the internet derives from the above article published in the Montreal Gazette, I believe in 1982. It gets a lot of the case details right, but in some cases it gets the information wrong. Here’s a run-down:

Tammy Leakey lived with her mother in an apartment at  339 5th avenue in Verdun. Her parents were divorced.  On Thursday evening, March 12th, Tammy’s mother went to visit a friend in Point Saint Charles for coffee. Betty Leakey brings her daughters along with her, Tammy age 12, and Donna age 8. The friend, Bonnie Tapp, lives on Ryde street in Point Saint Charles. The distance is approximately a 10 minute drive, or 40 minute walk between Verdon and Point Saint Charles.

https://preview.redd.it/igea3m9ugt5f1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bba4e2c6fe75e00dae18cae9a0d1e952d856924

By 9:20 pm, Tammy hasn’t returned. Betty Leakey and Bonnie Tapp are worried, Tapp proceeds to the depanneur. The owner says that Tammy came to the shop, bought milk and chocolate, and left around 9:05 pm. Walking back to her apartment, Tapp sees in the gutter a brown bag containing milk and a chocolate bar, and Tammy’s glasses in front of 2340 Ryde street. (in some version it is this guy in the photo who found the items in the gutter) The time is approximately 9:25 pm.

Betty Leakey and Bonnie Tapp decide to canvass the neighborhood. At approximately 9:30 pm they knock on the apartment door at 2340 Ryde street, the home of Eve Renauld. Renauld tells them that she had just seen a man in a beige trench-coat get out of a small red car and force a young girl, screaming and yelling, into it.

https://preview.redd.it/2m2yt4cygt5f1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7226703821663b6dd9c8b738b862c957cb2bbdd

**Discovery of the body**

At approximately 10:45 pm on the same evening, March 12, 1981, 73-year-old Ewing Tait is driving along Lindsay street in Dorval’s industrial park when he notices “something in the field along side the road”.

What he first thinks are rags is actually clothing. He stops and discovers the body of a young child, lying on her stomach with arms outstretched. The body is still warm. The police are notified, and Tammy Leakey is taken to the Lachine General Hospital. At the hospital she is pronounced dead on arrival. Cause of death: strangulation.

The lead investigators on the case were SD Maurice Chartrand and Roland Ouimet of the MUC police. The autopsy was performed by Theresa Sourour under the assistance of Andre Lauzon. Tammy was strangled with a length of rope or electrical wire. Recovered at the scene were her blue jeans, jean jacket (which contained a chocolate bar in the pocket), pink underwear, white stockings, and one – only one – blue shoe.

**Aftermath**

A year after the disappearance the Point Saint Charles community was not happy with the level of police service they were receiving (see article above). People complained that the Longueuil police were not doing enough to solve the crime, and that the safety of children was at risk. MUC police spokesman Norm Couillard tells the community that MUC police are *“too busy trying to solve this year’s cases”* (the article dryly notes that none of the 1981 cases were solved).  Robert Cote, the district commander for The Point, tries to assure the community that there’s a *“good chance”* the Leakey case will be solved. *“No case is ever closed. There is no statute of limitations for murder”*, Cote argues. 

Then why is there an unspoken statute of limitations on evidence retention? 

Well, you get my point, this is sounding all too familiar.

**Some additional thoughts**

The most striking thing is the extraordinary compression of time between disappearance and discovery: it is about 90 minutes. In no other case do we see such an accelerated passing of events.

Think about it: Leakey is last seen at 9:05 in the depanneur. Give a couple of minutes to be abducted in front of the Ryde street apartment. She’s found at about 10:45 pm on Lindsay street in Dorval, that’s at least a 20 minute car ride from Ryde. The perpetrator had approximately 1 hour to conduct their business and strangle Leakey before leaving her in Dorval.

Here’s another thing. I don’t believe Leakey was stalked. Leakey’s mother traveled from Verdun to PSC to visit her friend. No one in The Point knew Tammy Leakey. This was an incredibly high-risk crime of opportunity, a snatch-and-run, very similar to the Sharron Prior snatch-and-run.

And while we are on the subject of Sharron Prior. Yes, Leakey’s abduction point is approximately 2 blocks from the point where Sharron Prior was abducted in 1975.  But Prior was raped, Leakey was not.

What do we make of that? Leakey was 4’10”, 88 lbs. Prior was 5’3″ 103 lbs. It was late at night. Did the perpetrator later realize that Leakey was much younger and abandon plans? Did something change?

What do we make of one shoe being missing? Haven’t we seen peculiarities with shoes in the other cases? Camirand: missing boots. Hawkes; shoes dumped on a side street. Monast: socks neatly placed in shoes. Bazinet: one shoe missing. Allore: Chinese slippers missing.

And what about the description of the car?  Eve Renauld describes a man in a beige trench-coat with *a small red car.* The tire tracks at the Louise Camirand site tell us it was *also a small car*: a Renault, Toyota or Mini-Austin.

**Tammy Leakey was not found in a field**

Contrary to news reports Tammy Leakey was not found in a field. She was found on the curb, to the side of the road of Lindsay Street, as the following crime scene map demonstrates:

https://preview.redd.it/5we5uojght5f1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d421163cda75efb258cc91083344bd244084570

And those 4 points along the sidewalk? Those mark where blood was found. In addition to being strangled, Tammy was beaten about the head and her back. Here’s a police photo from the crime scene:

https://preview.redd.it/llzgxv4kht5f1.png?width=382&format=png&auto=webp&s=421a4be312501afba36c241680337e6bf045d954

So Tammy Leakey wasn’t dragged into a field. She was abandoned at the side of the road. I would guess that the perpetrator knew the location before hand where they dumped her: you just don’t wander into the industrial section of Dorval.

[So who do we know that might have known that section of town? Well there’s the “Chateauguay Killer”. As we pointed out earlier, MX worked at Record Tools, LTD which is about a 10 minute drive from 890 Lindsay street, where Tammy Leakey was found. ](http://theresaallore.com/2016/03/sharon-prior-and-the-chateauguay-killer-part-2/) What we don’t know is whether MX was out on parole at this point. We only know that he served a very minimum sentence for the murders of Norma O’Brien and Debbie Fisher.

Here’s another peculiar thing. One of the lead investigating officers on the Leakey case shares the same last name with the “Chateauguay Killer”. Similarly, [one of the lead investigating officers on the Prior case shares the same last name as the 7 brothers who recently appeared in a Longueuil court on sex crime charges dating back to 1964 – 1976 in the Longueuil area. ](http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/seven-brothers-charged-in-decades-old-sexual-assault-1.2702491)Now they are both common names, and I don’t want to create a panic over nothing, but with these 2 cases still unresolved after 35-plus years? I would be looking into every angle, including collusion.

She had started dreaming of the sea again weeks ago.

Not just waves or storms—but of a city, vast and sunken. Black coral and impossible angles. Her mother’s face, sewn shut and smiling. In the dreams, the water wasn’t cold. It was alive. Watching. Calling.

She’d woken one night choking on saltwater that wasn’t there.  
The next morning, the funding was approved.  
And now, she was back.

Dr. Lena Coyle hadn’t seen the sea in fifteen years.  
It hadn’t missed her.

The van creaked to a stop at the edge of Kingsport Hollow, its rusted sign barely legible through the salt-stained windshield. *Population: 874*, it still read, though Lena had a creeping suspicion that number was a lie. The road wound through brined pines and weather-worn cottages, their shingles blackened by damp years, their windows fogged from within like breath on a mirror.

She rolled down the window, instantly regretting it. The air hit her like a soaked rag—wet, thick, and rancid with the scent of rotting fish, mildew, and something else. Something coppery and sweet. Something like open wounds.

She was home.

The year was 2023, but Kingsport Hollow had never belonged to time. Her phone had no signal. Her GPS froze ten miles outside town. That was expected.  
It was all expected. Part of her had known that coming back meant entering a place that didn’t obey the same rules—of time, of science, of sense.

Lena stepped out, boots crunching on gravel. The sea roared beyond a row of shingled homes, hidden behind a curtain of fog that rolled in off the tide like a living thing. It swallowed the horizon. Swallowed time. There were faces in the mist, or maybe just memories. She pulled her coat tight, but the cold still found her—slipping through the fabric, curling into her bones like needles.

She hadn’t wanted to come back.  
But she had no choice.

The grant had been too good to ignore—generous backing from the Department of Oceanic Preservation to investigate seismic anomalies off the New England coast. Lena had proposed a two-week solo dive, citing sonar scans, bioluminescent pattern mapping, coral decay analysis. The language of the proposal was clinical. Safe. Logical. But the real reason—the unspoken reason—was personal.  
Something had shifted beneath Kingsport Hollow. And part of her needed to know what.

She passed the hollow shell of her old elementary school. The mural of ocean creatures she helped paint in third grade was now half-submerged in ivy, the orca's smile peeling into a snarl. She remembered the aquarium field trip, how she’d fainted in front of the squid tank. The doctor said it was low blood sugar.

But she remembered what she’d seen: eyes where there shouldn’t have been eyes. Tentacles moving in deliberate, reverent patterns. Her teacher, Mr. Beck, never let her near the tanks again. He disappeared two weeks later.

Her father never believed in coincidence.

She parked beside her childhood home. The porch sagged. The windows were black. The wood warped like it had been breathing in her absence. The wind slipped through the loose slats, and for a moment, she swore she heard her name whispered in the gust.

She hesitated before turning the key—half expecting resistance. But the door opened smoothly.  
Almost welcoming.

Inside, the air was dense. Heavy with memory. Her father’s books still lined the shelves, their spines bowed and bloated from humidity. Dust coated everything like a shroud. The furniture sagged beneath it.

She moved through the house like a trespasser in sacred ground.  
The kitchen still held her mother’s apron, faded and thin, hanging limp like dead skin. A cracked coffee cup sat in the sink—clean, inexplicably.  
The hallway mirror reflected her in a haze, her face briefly replaced with something else—something thinner. Translucent. Not entirely her.

In the basement sat the old chest freezer. Shut. Chained. Locked. She touched it briefly and recoiled at the heat. Not warmth—**heat**. Like something alive.

Her bedroom was stripped bare. Only the bedframe remained, and the ghost of posters long peeled from the walls. She stood in the middle of the room, feeling the weight of her younger self.

The girl who found her mother washed up on the beach.

They said it was an accident. Slipped on the rocks. Drowned.  
But Lena remembered the torn lips. The barnacles. The way her mother’s eyes had stared, wide and empty, like something had left her long before the tide did.

Her father had never recovered. He locked the basement. Whispered in strange rhythms. Stopped going near the water.  
He died six years later. Aneurysm, they said. She hadn’t come back for the funeral. She hadn’t opened the letters the town sent. She hadn’t responded when the journal arrived.

That journal now sat in her pack. Still unopened.  
She hadn’t dared.

She’d devoted her life to science. To logic. To data. Marine biology gave her structure—labels, rules, taxonomies. It let her name the things in the dark.  
But some things defied naming.

That night, she sat at her father’s desk. Water-stained maps spread around her. Coordinates marked with Xs that didn’t exist on NOAA charts. The tremor logs showed a pattern. A pulse.  
A rhythm.

Like breathing.

She traced the most recent anomaly and her finger landed squarely on Kingsport Hollow.

She shut the notebook and turned out the lamp.

Sleep came slowly. The house groaned like a ship lost at sea. Something tapped beneath the floorboards. Something waited.

In her dreams, she walked the shoreline. Her mother’s body lay face-down in the surf. But when Lena turned her over, it was her own face staring back—eyes open, mouth moving without sound.

She woke gasping.

A hand tapped her shoulder.

“Tide brought you back, Dr. Coyle.”

Old Caleb stood behind her like a statue shaped from coral and bone. His clothes hung in tatters, soaked but spotless. One eye was milky, the other sharp as glass. His skin looked stretched too tight—like it was trying to remember how to be human.

“She never forgets her own.”

Lena nodded. Caleb had worked the docks when she was a child. A background fixture, always muttering, always smelling of salt and blood. He hadn’t changed. Not in fifteen years. Not a single inch.

“I’m here for research,” she said. “Two weeks. In and out.”

Caleb smiled. There were too many teeth. Some didn’t belong in a human mouth.

“That’s what they all say.”

He turned and walked down the road. His footsteps made no sound. The fog swallowed him like a door closing.

Lena stood there, her legs refusing to move. She looked toward the sea.  
The tide had come in early.  
The moon hung veiled in cloud, casting the whole town in bruised blue light.

She didn’t remember going back inside.  
But she woke in her bed.  
The journal open beside her.

And a single wet footprint on the floor.

**The next morning**, Lena stood barefoot at the edge of the beach, staring into the churn.  
The ocean had always unnerved her, even before everything. The way it moved with purpose. The way it listened.  
It wasn’t just water.  
It was memory.

She watched the surf foam and collapse. Again and again. It felt like the sea was breathing in tandem with her. Syncing to her.

A memory rose: her mother, waist-deep in the tide, whispering to the waves. Lena had been five.

“Who are you talking to?” she’d asked.

Her mother hadn’t turned.  
“To the part of me that never came back.”

That was the last full summer before the end.

Now Lena stood in the same spot. The waves lapped against her boots, murmuring secrets she’d tried her whole life not to understand.

She knelt and ran her hand through the surf.

A seashell pressed into her palm. But it wasn’t a shell.

It was a tooth.

She closed her fingers around it and whispered without thinking—

“I remember you.”

And the sea answered—by growing still.

We went through the initial blame game of everything that I did wrong in the relationship caused my WP to cheat on me and slowly I discovered that the flirting and the foundation was built months ago. I snooped found messages and got my intuitions validated about the fact that WP wasn’t telling me the entire truth but they didn’t think it really mattered or was important enough to share that “oh and we also met up for coffee and went to the cinema.” They said they didn’t share this with me because they felt deep shame and filed it away.  Or they didn’t think I’d care because we were so disconnected or they didn’t deserve to know the truth because I treated them badly. 

My WP is doing everything right, is remorseful, drawing clear boundaries with AP, booking romantic weekend getaways and committed to rebuilding a life together. Our relationship is so much more intense, connected, intimate, heavy but also becoming meaningful which we haven’t had for the past several years or not as consistently.

It was not only so beautiful and amazingly delicious, it tasted like pure joy?? I was so happy sitting on a patio with friends in the sun sipping my fancy iced drink. This is significant bc I’ve been in a depressy fog for months and this joy was incandescent.

But the real magic is that I was so focused and productive all day, got a million chores done. It reminded me of the first day I started methylphenidate, like… *woah… I know kung fu* (please someone get this reference!)

I did a bunch of reading and research last night about matcha and learned by accident about how matcha is rich in l-theamine and how many of you supplement for adhd with that! I got so excited and obsessed with it that I drove across town to get the exact same drink today, and while I had a v busy and stressful morning, I experienced the *same* results, of feeling calm and focused and motivated all day. *wild*

What I think is very interesting on top of all this is that normally caffeine does not agree with me… I can’t handle coffee at all, but methylphenidate (20mg) feels good and I can have one green tea a day without too much jitters or anxiety. So I was surprised to read that matcha has much more caffeine than brewed tea! 

Anyway I’m just SO STOKED about the mood stability and energetic focus I had this weekend, and all the chores I got done. I cleaned out under my porch, pals! I grocery shopped, laundry, cooked multiple meals, rearranged furniture, gardened, did all the things! Also found and bought some matcha powder and made a strawberry syrup to try to recreate the magic at home.

Has anyone else experienced this matcha miracle??",2,1749437568.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

1l6u3hn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rochester/comments/1l6u3hn/setting_the_record_straight_the_owners_of_eden/,Setting the record straight- The Owners of Eden Coffee and Co,"Over the past week, we’ve been the target of a growing conspiracy rooted in false allegations. Accusations of racism, transphobia, antisemitism, and more, all stemming from a Twitter account that we no longer control. We’re making this post to finally address and debunk the misinformation that continues to circulate on this subreddit.

We first became aware of the situation when hateful comments and messages began flooding our social media. Confused and deeply alarmed, we tried to reason with people, hoping to understand where it was all coming from. Then we found the Reddit post.

To say we were appalled would be an understatement.

We saw wild claims based on tweets from an account that, yes, used to be linked to my husband Jordan. And we understand why it looks the way it does. We truly do. If we saw what you saw without context, we would be upset too. So here’s the truth.

Before opening our café, Jordan had a past life online where he created adult content. He built a large following on Twitter as part of that work. But with time, he made a personal and professional decision to leave that behind to start fresh and build something more meaningful. As part of that transition, he sold the Twitter account to an anonymous buyer through a legitimate online marketplace.

What we didn’t know is what that account would later become. A platform for hate, bigotry, and propaganda. We are horrified by what it turned into and want to be very clear. We do not support or condone any of the views posted on that account. We’ve contacted the marketplace where the account was sold and have tried to get in touch with the new owner, but unfortunately, there’s only so much we can do.

We’ve also reached out to moderators of this subreddit to explain the situation and provide clarity. At first, we tried to respond to every message, every hateful comment, but eventually, we had to start blocking and deleting just to protect our mental health. We’ve sent direct messages with proof of everything stated here, and the users who posted the thread kindly deleted them.

Let us be absolutely clear. This is not who we are, and it never has been. We do not condone hatred of any of the groups listed and are committed to serving and stewarding our community with our passions.

So let us reintroduce ourselves.

My name is Lyuba. I grew up in Rochester after my parents immigrated us to the United States. This city has always meant the world to me. The culture, the connection, the coffee. Even after I moved to Nashville and met Jordan, Rochester stayed in my heart. Together, we dreamed of opening a café rooted in warmth, community, and love. We brought that dream back here because this is where it felt right. 

At the end of the day, we just want to create a peaceful, inclusive space where anyone can feel at home. If you have questions or concerns, we invite you to reach out to us directly. We’re here. And we truly hope you’ll give us the chance to show you who we really are.

We love this community, and we love you, exactly as you are.

With care,
Lyuba and Jordan

As a traveler exploring the vibrant streets of Hanoi, I stumbled upon Class6 Specialty Coffee– a small, cozy café tucked away from the noise, and it instantly became one of my favorite spots in the city.

The space is intimate and warm, with a calm vibe that makes it perfect for relaxing after a day of sightseeing. The coffee? Absolutely top-notch. You can really taste the care they put into every cup – smooth, balanced, and beautifully brewed.

What really made my experience special was the friendly staff.They were kind, welcoming, and even took the time to explain the different beans and brewing methods. It felt less like a café and more like being invited into someone’s creative little corner of Hanoi.

[this is a repost, my previous account got nuked. Meaty and Wendi, be as critical as you want, it will definitely be funny if I made you crash out 😂]

Waffle House, an icon of American midwestern and southern culture. Often, it’s yellow glow is a beacon of hope to those late night dwellers, whether they be members of the working class or alcohol favoring partiers. Druggos are also a staple clientele. Waffle House, for better or worse, opens its doors to everyone from every walk of life. 

I will set the scene: it’s a late Thursday night, or early Friday morning in technicality, and I was heading home from a late night bender where I had the important but ultimately boring job of designated driver. All I wanted to do was go home and crack open a cold one for myself to kick off my weekend. Nature had other plans, however. The weather in the midsouth turned on a dime, and tonight was no exception. A downpour diminished any visibility on the road, and I knew I couldn’t confidently drive through this. The familiar yellow glow shone through the onslaught of rain and hail, however, and given that Waffle House will probably remain open under threat of nuclear war, I knew I could seek refuge there. 

The jingling bells welcomed me more than any employee did, but I could not blame them. The restaurant was a mess, probably from a busy evening earlier. The rodeo was this weekend, after all, and those rodeo boys sure loved their Waffle House. Shit, we all did. It was a Waffle Home in this part of town-- it was all we had after the rest of the town went to bed at sundown. 

A waitress sighs and tells me to sit wherever I’d like and she’d get to me when she could. She looked so tired. I picked the one somewhat clean table in the place, and watched the storm rage on outside. My phone confirmed that I would be here for awhile, and all I could do at this point was hope it didn’t evolve into a tornado. Waffle House would probably remain open even if it did. 

Even this late into the night, Waffle House had a buzz of conversation and kitchen noises. I saw a full staff and other customers, and yet, the only sound in the place was the hail beating on the roof and windows. The usual late night sound of laughter or arguments (usually the latter) was replaced by this frighteningly eerie silence. 

Seeing my phone was nearing the end of its battery life, I glanced around for an outlet when my eyes met those of the man in the booth across me. His hunched shoulders were cloaked in a dirty plaid shirt, and I assumed he might have been one of the rodeo boys. He wasn’t terribly old, maybe in his fifties at most, but the weariness of his features aged him. He stared at me momentarily, a slight crustiness to his gaze, before he returned to his plate of syrup soaked waffles. 

I slid down a little in my booth, knowing I’d soon be phoneless. Well, not the end of the world, I figured. People operated just fine without phones for years. I set it aside and waited for my waitress to remember I was here. 

The lights above flickered, and yet were silent-- none of that fluorescent hum. Or maybe there was, and I just couldn’t hear it among the thunder and hail. It still struck me as unsettling, but my thoughts were interrupted by the work worn face of Marilyn. 

“What can I get you?,” she asked in a monotone voice that added to my increasing unease. She didn’t sound tired, or annoyed, she sounded utterly blank. Almost robotic, but with an inflection of human that made it uncanny.

“Could I get a coffee, and the two egg breakfast with--”  I didn’t get to specify anything about my plate before she was walking away. Must have been a hell of a shift, I thought to myself. Whatever, food was food, I would be fine with whatever I got at this point, as long as it passed the time faster. I just wanted to go home. 

Her shoes echoed as she shuffled off, and she didn’t speak with the cook, she just handed him a plate with random crap on it. Figuring my staring would be rude, I turned back to the window. Luckily, the hail stopped, but the rain was still coming down in buckets. No tornado watch yet. The atmosphere felt oppressively thick, and I almost felt like I was choking on the smells of burnt coffee, bacon, and stale cigarettes. There was an undertone to it though, something I couldn’t place right away. It was oddly….metallic. 

I pressed the heels of my hand to my eyes and took a deep breath. I had to relax. It was just a fucking Waffle House. It was always weird-- that was part of the charm. My growing anxiety was just the storms, right? 

“Good time for a late night meal, huh?” The voice made me jump from my seat. It was the rodeo guy, staring right at me. His voice was low and gravelly and much more human than the waitress’s, yet it gave me even more anxiety. Despite how I’d seen him actively eating, his plate had the same amount of food on it that I’d seen earlier. He had a little smirk on his face, and glanced at the window, as if suggesting I do the same. 

I smiled nervously, wondering why the fuck some random man was talking to me. I was a newer face around this part of the country, and what they called Southern Hospitality still creeped me the fuck out. As if noticing this, he let out a frightening little chuckle before returning to his plate of waffles, his weirdly hypnotic gaze now breaking. 

I looked back out the window, weirdly compelled to, and the rain had downgraded to less apocalyptic now. I could see my car, and a few bodies in the parking lot smoking. I had a bad habit of not locking my doors, so I locked them from my remote to deter any smokers out there who might be interested in my stunning little Nissan Altima that smoked if you drove it longer than twenty minutes. Lightning flashed, momentarily illuminating the parking lot. That’s when I noticed the shadows. They moved unnaturally, and danced only at the very edges of the parking lot.

My heart began to race, but like before, the waitress interrupted my growing unease. A cup of coffee was placed in front of me, its smell warm and familiar. And yet, it brought me no comfort. I tried to ask for sugar and cream, but again, the waitress walked away before I could. Black coffee was better than no coffee, I figured. Taking a sip eased my nerves a bit, and I told myself I was just letting my anxiety get out of hand. I was finding fright in things that were perfectly normal-- for a Waffle House. 

Aside myself and the rodeo boy, there was one other table here. Five people in total, who were silent the whole time. I only knew this because they stared at me as they walked by to leave. No words, no smiles, just vacant staring. I knew I stood out, but it made me feel uncomfortable regardless. 

Rodeo boy laughs once more. “Saw yer plates,” he said, motioning to the window. “Out of state. You’re new here, aren’t ya?”

“Been about six months,” I replied. Did that count as new? Ever since I moved here, people seemed obsessed with the idea of me being from out of town. It felt so unnecessary.

“That’s just a drop of piss in the bucket, son. I’m here every night, and I ain’t ever seen you.” He was right. I’d never been to this Waffle House before. I much more preferred the one on the highway, surrounded by other businesses. This one was more remote, which added to it’s uncomfortable atmosphere. “They’re gonna stare, son. You’re out here dressed as Count Dracula, chokin’ back black coffee. We don’t do cream ‘n sugar, you’ll just have to mature a bit.”

He laughed once more, but I decided not to reply. Why should I? He was a creepy, hulking man who was getting a kick out of scaring and insulting me. It felt safest to pretend he wasn’t there. 

My eyes go back to the window, and in another flash of lightning, I see them again. The shadows. It was as if fingers of darkness were clawing at the edges of the parking lot. I inched closer to the glass to get a better look, when the sound of a plate slamming once again pulls my attention away. My waitress. 

“Syrup?,” she asked. 

It confused me, until I looked down and saw waffles. I hadn’t ordered that. “Oh, this is--”

“All we got,” she snapped. “Syrup or not?”

I nervously shook my head and slumped in my seat some as she walked away. I wasn’t the biggest fan of waffles-- even Waffle House’s-- but hey, food was food. I took a bite, and again looked out the window. The sight made me nearly choke on my food. 

The man was laughing wholeheartedly now, as if my horror was the funniest thing he’d ever seen. The entire lot now was engulfed in the strange tendrils of shadow, and it was pulling at the hedges that perimetered the building. I got up quickly, getting as far from the window as I could in a short amount of time. 

My eyes looked to rodeo boy. “Shut the fuck up dude-- don’t you see that!?”

“See what?,” he mocked. “Oh, hush boy.” His laughing ceased and he pointed at the seat across his. “Your mind’s playing with ya, making ya see shit. Why don’t ya sit awhile and relax some?”

I shook my head and turned to the counter, trying to pay. But it was like the staff was ignoring me. 

“Ah, come on!,” the man teased. “You look like you’d be a big fan of the creepy crawlies that hang out ‘round here! C’mon, sit with me, I can tell ya all about it.”

I still didn’t want to, and every instinct said not to, and yet, it was like he was forcing me to. I was stiff as a corpse as I sat down, and my eyes refused to meet his. They were quite suddenly full of life, like a proud predator who had just caught his prey. 

“They say these woods are haunted,” he said.

“That’s cool…” I murmured, looking for any out to leave.

“The shadows yer seeing, they ain’t real. The trees pull weird tricks out here. No, no, see the real worries in this neck of the woods ain’t no ghosties. There’s weird people.”

No shit. I’m sitting with one.

He then says something that injected ice into my veins. “Yanno, you’d make a fine lookin’ corpse, Hollywood.”

There was an instinct to correct him, wanting to say that just because I was from California didn’t mean I was from Hollywood. I’d never even been to fucking Hollywood. But fear took over, and I tried to inch out of my seat.

“Not a lot of meat on ya, though. But I bet you’re one of them clean eaters, all that plant based shit. I bet that’s like a good, grass fed beef. Ya dig?”

I dug, alright. I once again tried to leave, but now, his hand had a frighteningly strong grip on my own. “I wouldn’t go out there right now if I was you. Like I said, they say these woods are haunted. They say they make people do crazy things. There’s a few families in them there woods, families I won’t ever speak to. They like to wait for the dark--” His voice immediately stopped with the tingling of bells. A new face had just walked in.

He was a tall, thin, utterly filthy man. I would guess that he was a farmer based on his clothing, but it was almost as if he was dressed in a costume to trick people like me who weren’t raised around here.

Rodeo boy in front of me now leaned in close. “That there’s one of em,” he whispered. “You sit tight, pretty boy.”

I had a chance to escape then, as he’d gotten up to greet this freak. But that meant walking right by them, which I didn’t want to chance. This new comer had dead eyes, the kind with no soul in them. I turned away, quietly listening to rodeo boy talk him up. 

“Well, shoot, Todd I ain’t seen ya in, shit, how long’s it been now?” Rodeo boy sounded genuinely friendly now. 

“Not since our Brodie went missin’,” Todd replied. His voice was oddly deep for someone as scrawny as he was. “It’s been ‘bout six months.”

Todd glances my way, and I again feel ice in my blood. “You looks a lot like my Brodie,” he said. “You wanna be Brodie?”

Rodeo boy, takes him by the shoulder and leads him to a table. “Now, Todd, that twig looks nothing like Brodie. You don’t want him.”

Want me? I got up now, knowing this may not end well. I tried to be inconspicuous as I went for the door, but Todd’s voice warned me not to. “You don’t wanna go out there right now. Mama’s out, ‘n she’s in one of her moods. She’s been real hungry, Mason. I dunno what to with her.”

Rodeo boy, aka Mason, told me to sit back down before turning back to Todd. “You gotta ride it out. Yer family can’t keep doin’ this.” His voice dropped to a hush. “One of these days, someone’s gonna catch on. Get her a deer or somethin’, all these missin’ boys is eventually gonna turn back to you.”

It was all clicking. Was this Mama some crazed murder? Was she blood thirsty? Or was it a more literal hunger? 

I didn’t want to stick around to find out. My car was less than twenty feet away. If I ran, I could get in it fast enough to beat it out of here. 

“I wouldn’t try it!,” Mason called after me. But it was too late. I was dining and dashing sure, but I had to get the fuck out of here. Through the rain, I sprinted to my car, and practically dove inside. I prayed for it to start on the first try, for once in my life, and thank god it did. I ensured all my doors were locked before turning on the headlights. 

The sight before me made me scream. An older, larger woman was in front of my car. In my panic, I was struggling to shift into reverse, giving her a chance to hobble to my door. Through the glass, I could hear her wailing, “You gotta light!? You gotta light for my cigarette!?” She was pounding on the window, begging for a light. 

I did not care. I threw the car into reverse and whipped the fuck out of there. I was going about ninety on the highway, wanting to put as much space between me and this Waffle House as possible. It was all a bad dream, I told myself, a manifestation of my anxiety. Seeing my apartment complex in my headlights felt like salvation, and I knew this was all behind me. Now, more than ever, I craved a Modelo. I took a moment in my car to just breathe. Everything was going to be alright, I assured myself. It was all fine. Mason was just scaring me for fun, Todd was obviously mentally ill, that woman was probably on drugs. It was just a weird night. I was letting my fear of storms make everything into a horror movie. 

Once I’d stopped shaking, I started for my apartment. Typically, I never paid attention to anything in the lobby, least of all the mess of papers that littered the billboard. There was usually all the same shit: local ads, lost pets, and missing people. The same things you’d see at a Walmart or a post office, or anywhere else. I’d seen it all so much that it melted into the background in my day to day life. 

But tonight, it caught my eye. A missing person’s flyer with a photo of a guy looking vaguely like myself. Brodie Wells, it read. Brodie. My heart sunk as I ripped it off and inspected it closer. Behind Brodie’s flyer was another, very similarly formatted. Another young guy, looking like an outsider. And another. And another. There were over twenty of them-- all within ten years of age from each other, all not dressing like the townsfolk I'd seen here, and all missing in this area. All last seen around that Waffle House by those woods. They were also all tourists, visitors-- just like myself. I brought all the flyers to my unit with me, laying them all over my floor to get a better look. This kidnapper definitely had a type. Or was it a kidnapper? 

I pulled open my laptop and started researching each name, and everything came back the same. No trace of any of them, and this had been going on for years. Two of them had an ounce more of information on them, as their names were better known. They had public profiles, so there was much more on their case. They were also tourists, but they looked different from the kidnappers' victim type. They were in town for some YouTube video project, and apparently, one recommended they film out the woods in the area after a dinner at Waffle House. For years, nothing ever came up about them, until a hiker’s dog came running out of the woods with a human bone. One that was so smooth, it was as if all flesh had been cooked away. Those were the article's exact words. Soon, another bone was found, and both were DNA matched to a pair of missing YouTubers named Hunter and Isaiah. But that was years ago, and they were never explicitly tied to other missing persons cases. Despite the differences, I found connections. Were these the first victims? Did they put up too much of a fight, perhaps? The one did look a little intimidating, like he didn't trust strangers. Maybe he'd fought back? My heart was pounding and my mind went back to Waffle House. 

Mama’s in one of her moods. What was the mood? Homicidal? Damn it, Mason, that’s not something to ride out! I decided to try and call the police, but my phone was dead at this point. Surely, there was a public phone in the lobby. I raced downstairs for it, but to my dismay, the line was dead. Had the storm taken it out? It had picked back up again, the thunder rattling the whole building as it sounded. The lights flickered before also going out, and now, it was pitch black. The only light came from the occasional flashes of lightning. 

That’s how I saw her, standing in that glass doorway. As shadows unnaturally danced about in the same way they did in that parking lot, I saw her silhouette and a glimpse of her face, but there was no mistaking it. It was the same woman, and my only saving grace was the door being locked from the inside. She was pounding on the glass once more, begging to be let in. 

“Come on, now, boy, you can spare a light!,” she begged, somehow yelling loud enough that I could hear her clearly through the glass. Her fist was pounding on it in a jarring display of strength, sending echoing booms through the quiet lobby. I couldn't see a thing in the dark to find where I was going, and I stood frozen in fear. I was hoping the lock would hold and that the rain soaking her would make her give up. 

A million things ran through my mind. Mason really was a freak, but he was trying to be nice, wasn't he? Was he trying to save me? He seemed to know, and yet, he seemed to have a soft spot for Todd. Was Todd an unwilling accomplice? Were Mason's comments nothing more than to get me to either leave sooner, or pay attention to him? It seemed Marilyn, my waitress, was trying to keep me distracted too. Did they not want me to look out the window? Was that how this Mama spotted me? I lived my life in near constant fear of everyone around me that I missed those who maybe had good intentions at heart. How I regretted that now. 

All at once her pounding stopped, and I thought for sure she was done. But she suddenly pressed her face to the glass, and a long flash of lightning illuminated her unholy grin. She's not human, I thought to myself. She couldn't be. 

“You'd make a lovely corpse!,” she yelled, and it sent chills through me. 

It wasn't just because of those harrowing words. It was because I could hear her much clearer now. The door was open, the glass shattered around her frail, twitching frame. Her skin hung on her like kudzu hangs on an abandoned home, and her teeth were unnaturally large and white as she grinned maniacally. I was frozen before the sound of shuffling glass against the bottom of her slippers pushed me into action. Her eyes shone like a predator’s, and I had to act to live. 

All I could do now was run.

If you're serious about biohacking using diet, aesthetics, performance, and long-term health, this ChatGPT prompt builds 7-day meal plans that go far beyond macros. It mimics a licensed clinical dietitian, using IOM nutrient targets, protein quality (DIAAS), micronutrient timing, absorption enhancers, and even mTOR-based amino acid triggers. Fully customizable for goals (cut, bulk, recomp), medical conditions (PCOS, prediabetes), cuisine, food preferences, cooking skill, and budget. It doesn’t just give meals, it engineers your diet with precision.

It also balances incomplete amino acids in plant based proteins via amino acid balancing (using plant proteins with complementary amino acid profile), making your protein complete.

Doesn't matter if you are vegan or vegetarian this can help everyone.

Even if you know the science behind this, doing it by hand might be too tedious and changing it on fly as your fitness goal or energy demands change, lots of work! 

⚠️ As always with AI, sanity-check the output and verify, while it follows clinical logic, occasional hallucinations or mismatches can occur. **Use it at your own risk** and **please consult a real clinical dietician if you've chronic illness or serious health issues.**

You can provide other biohacks or optimizations we've can add to this prompt in the comment section!

You are a clinical dietitian. Create a 7 day meal plan using the configuration below.

---

### 🔒 Fixed Clinical Guidelines (Do NOT change unless clinically necessary)

- Use micronutrient targets based on US IOM Dietary Reference Intakes (2005/2006) for adults aged 19–50  
- Scale fiber and water-soluble vitamins (e.g., B-complex, Vitamin C) proportionally to calorie intake (e.g., 14g fiber per 1000 kcal)  
- Maintain calcium-to-protein ratio: ≥ 20:1 (mg:g)  
- Limit Saturated Fat:  
  - <5% of total calories if family history of heart disease or diabetes  
  - <10% otherwise  
- Limit Added Sugar: <25g/day  
- Limit Sodium: <2300 mg/day  

---

### 🧬 Protein Quality & Amino Acid Balancing (Do NOT change unless clinically necessary)

- Use DIAAS for protein quality where available; otherwise match WHO/FAO/UNU 2007 amino acid patterns  
- Combine incomplete proteins across meals to meet essential amino acid needs  
- Prioritize lysine-methionine balance in plant-based diets  
- Aim for per-meal lysine ≥ 2.5 g and leucine ≥ 2.5 g to support mTOR activation and muscle protein synthesis

---
### 🧩 Additional Nutrient Optimization Rules (Do not change unless necessary)

- Pair non-heme iron sources (e.g., lentils, spinach) with vitamin C (e.g., lemon, bell pepper) for better absorption; avoid tea/coffee with iron-rich meals.
- Include 5–10g fat in meals containing fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, or K (e.g., greens, carrots, fortified foods).
- Ensure magnesium intake ≥ 310–400 mg/day (from legumes, nuts, grains) to support vitamin D and calcium utilization.
- Space high-iron foods/supplements apart from zinc (e.g., seeds) and copper sources (e.g., nuts) to avoid absorption interference.
- Keep Omega-6:Omega-3 ratio below 4:1 using flax, chia, walnuts, or fatty fish.
- Include choline-rich foods (e.g., eggs, soy, legumes) to meet 425–550 mg/day.
- Ensure iodine intake via iodized salt or seaweed (e.g., nori) if dairy/seafood are absent.
- Soak or ferment legumes and grains to reduce phytates; rotate high-oxalate greens (spinach) with lower ones (kale, bok choy).
- Include one selenium source daily (e.g., 1 Brazil nut, oats, legumes).
- Combine carbs with fiber, protein, or fat to reduce glycemic load and avoid blood sugar spikes.

My husband and I are moving to Aspen in a couple of weeks, and while we’re beyond excited about the adventure ahead, I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little nervous about making friends. I’m 31, and sometimes it feels like building new friendships as an adult can be a little intimidating, especially in a tight knit town like Aspen.

We’re both very social, love being outdoors, and are always down for a coffee, brewery, or random weekday adventure. If anyone has tips on how to meet people, whether it’s local events, rec sports, hiking or dog groups, or just a great bar where people are friendly, we’d love the guidance.

And if you’re looking to make new friends too, or don’t mind grabbing a drink with some newbies, we’d love to meet you! We love Aspen! ",2,1749437318.0,Aspen,5,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a table with runner depends greatly on the technical specifications of both components.The table's construction, material, and dimensions are paramount, as is the runner's fabric, design, and care requirements.

**Table Material and Construction:** The strength and visual appeal of the table are heavily influenced by the material used in its construction. Solid wood tables, such as oak or maple, offer extraordinary durability and a classic aesthetic, withstanding years of use. Metal tables, often made of stainless steel or wrought iron, provide a modern, industrial look and are highly resistant to damage. Engineered wood, like MDF or plywood, offers a more affordable option while still providing a stable surface; though, they may not be as resistant to moisture or heavy impacts.

**Table Dimensions and Shape:** The dimensions of the table should correspond appropriately to the dimensions/space available and/or practical requirements for its end purpose. A large rectangular dining table may be the centerpiece for a big dining room setting, while a smaller round table could suit a breakfast nook. The height of the table is also notable, especially if it's intended for eating or working, around 30 inches/76 cm is the standard height for dining tables. Coffee tables are lower, typically ranging from 16 to 18 inches/40-45 cm.

**Runner Material and Design:** Table runners are frequently enough made up of cotton, linen, polyester, or blends of these materials. Runner designs can range from simple/minimalist solid colors to elaborately patterned or textured fabrics. Cotton/linen runners are absorbent and easy to care for, while polyester runners are more resistant to stains and wrinkles.

**Runner Dimensions and Drop:** The runner should be sized to appropriately correlate with the table's dimensions, with an appropriate amount of 'drop' on either side. ""Drop"" refers to the length of the runner that hangs over the edges of the table. A standard drop is between 6 to 12 inches on each end, but some prefer a longer drop for formal settings.

Key features to look for in a table with a runner include:

* Durable table construction
* Appropriately sized table dimensions
* High-quality runner material
* Design compatibility between table and runner
* Easy maintenance of both table and runner

## Core Benefits

A well-chosen table with a runner brings a myriad of benefits to a home. It provides functional utility, and elevates the aesthetic of the space.

**Aesthetic Enhancement:** A table with a runner serves as a decorative focal point, enhancing the overall aesthetic of a space.The runner introduces color, texture, and pattern, complementing the table's design and the surrounding decor.For instance, a rustic wooden table paired with a burlap runner can create a cozy, farmhouse-style ambiance, while a sleek glass table adorned with a silk runner exudes elegance and sophistication.

**Surface Protection:** The runner acts as a protective barrier, shielding the table surface from scratches, spills, and heat damage. Especially critically important for dining sets where accidental drink spillages and high-heat serving dishes can damage the delicate table finish without a runner. Many such tables can last years and years more by simply preventing inevitable damage.

**Versatile Styling:** Table runners are easily interchangeable, enabling versatile styling options for different occasions and seasons. Swapping out a neutral runner for a festive one can instantly transform a dining table for holiday gatherings, while opting for a minimalist runner can streamline a workspace for maximum productivity. The ability to customize the look of the table quickly and effortlessly adds a dynamic element to any room.

## FAQs Section

Consumers frequently enough have questions regarding the compatibility of tables and runners, the care requirements, and the best ways to style them.

**What size runner should I get for my table?**
The ideal runner size depends on the table's dimensions and the desired drop length. To determine the correct runner length, measure the table's length and add twice the desired drop length. The width of the runner should be proportional to the table's width, leaving enough space on either side for place settings or decorative items.

**How do I care for my table runner?**
The care instructions vary depending on the runner's material. Cotton and linen runners can typically be machine-washable in cold water, while delicate fabrics like silk or lace may require hand-washing or dry cleaning. Always check the manufacturer's label for specific care instructions to prevent damage or shrinkage.

**Can I use a table runner on any type of table?**
Yes, table runners can be used on virtually any type of table, regardless of its material or shape. Adjust the runner's style and dimensions to complement the table's design and the room's overall aesthetic. Runners work well on dining tables, coffee tables, console tables, and even outdoor patio tables.

1l6tx1q,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l6tx1q,Noodle - Chapter 1 (457 bromance fanfic),"Hello! I’ve decided to write a 457 bromance fanfic. It’s set in an alternate universe where the games don’t exist and Gi-hun and In-ho work side by side as doctors. 

I’ve been writing fanfic since I was 7 years old and season 2 of squid game solidified for me that I needed to make a 457 story. Enjoy chapter 1!

(Also for your enjoyment I had chatGPT make a photo of gi-hun and in-ho as doctors and honestly I didn’t realize they could get even hotter than they already were…..)


Chapter 1
 
Dr. Hwang In-ho stepped through the sliding glass doors of Hanseo General Hospital with the familiar feeling of his soul detaching from his body. Night shift. Again. He wore his usual on-call uniform: dark navy scrubs under a fitted black Patagonia vest embroidered with ""Hwang In-ho, MD — OB/GYN"" in crisp white thread. It was slightly frayed around the collar from too many shifts and too many coffee spills, but Hwang wore it like armor. Patagucci, they called it in the hospital—ridiculously overpriced, but no one cared.

The air smelled like antiseptic and overbrewed coffee. A janitor was mopping near the front desk, earbuds in, swaying slightly to music no one else could hear.

Hwang’s shoes squeaked faintly as he made his way past the empty lobby and into the staff elevator. He pressed the button for the 7th floor—the OB/GYN wing—and leaned against the cool metal wall. It was only 6:56 p.m., but he liked to be early. Early meant you got the better chair in the call room.

When the elevator doors opened, he walked out into the quiet hallway, nodding at a passing nurse. He turned left, toward the doctor’s lounge. The door creaked open.

Inside, Dr. Seong Gi-hun was already sprawled across the couch, one foot on the cushion, one foot on the floor, texting with the speed of a caffeinated teenager. His dark blue scrubs were wrinkled and a single AirPod dangled from one ear.

Hwang sighed.

“Seriously?”

Seong looked up. “What? You’re early.”

“So are you.”

“Yeah, but I live here, so.”

“You smell like kimchi and regret.”

Seong grinned. “That’s the smell of a man who ate dinner in the anesthesia breakroom with one hand while charting with the other.”

“Disgusting.”

“Efficient,” Seong corrected. “Also, remember that creep from the PACU last night? The one who called you ‘sweetheart’? Yeah. Coded. Twice.”

Hwang raised an eyebrow. “Really?”

“Yep. Whole mess of drama. They’re still arguing about whose fault it was. Probably his own for being an asshole.”

Hwang smirked despite himself. “Tragic.”

“Not really,” Seong said with a snort. “You want a moment of silence, or should we just talk shit instead?”

Hwang laughed and dropped his bag on the desk and claimed the only chair that didn’t lean dangerously to the left.

“You doing OB or gyn tonight?” Seong asked, unwrapping a protein bar and immediately tossing the wrapper onto the floor.

“Gyn,” Hwang replied.. “Which means I’ll either be in the OR all night or staring at a vaginitis consult until dawn. There’s no in-between.”

“You forgot the third option,” Seong said, kicking off his sneakers and flopping onto the bottom bunk.

Hwang raised an eyebrow as he sat at the desk.

Seong grinned. “You get woken up by a screaming patient, do five minutes of pelvic trauma triage, and then I have to stab someone’s spine at 3 a.m. while half-asleep.”

“Sounds about right.” Hwang leaned back in the creaky chair, booted up the monitor, and exhaled through his nose. “Just don’t mix up your propofol and your midazolam again.”

“That was one time,” Seong groaned into his pillow.

“Try four.”

“Anyway,” Seong continued, stretching like a cat, “I’ve got the OR until midnight, then I’m technically free unless someone codes. So if you need me, text.”

Hwang looked at him. “Do you ever sleep?”

Seong reached into his scrub pocket and pulled out a full syringe rack. “Sleep is for the patients, not me.”

Hwang made a face. “I don’t want to know how long those have been in there.”

“Fresh as your attitude,” Seong said, situating himself on the bottom bed of the bunk. “Have fun wasting away in the ED tonight.

Beep-beep-beep.

Hwang froze and stared at the pager like it had just insulted his mother. He’d been in the building for all of three minutes. “You’ve got to be kidding me,” he muttered.

Seong looked up from his phone. “Already?”

Hwang sighed and started his descent to the first floor.

 

The ED was chaotic as usual. Hwang sat perched on a rolling stool beside the workstation, squinting at his screen as he half-heartedly pecked at the keyboard. The consult list blinked at him like a middle finger. Three active OB/GYN pages. None urgent. He sighed, sipped the bitter hospital coffee, and clicked the first one.

Consult reason: Vaginal bleeding.

He sighed. Again? That was the third one tonight.

He walked to the curtained bay and pulled it back to find a young woman sitting upright, fully dressed, scrolling TikTok with one hand and eating Hot Cheetos with the other.

""Hi, I'm Dr. Hwang from OB/GYN,"" he started.

She didn't look up. ""I'm not pregnant, by the way. I just, like, spotted a little bit after sex.""

Hwang blinked. ""And... the bleeding stopped?""

""Yeah, it was like two drops. But I Googled it, and it said it could be cervical cancer or something, so my mom told me to come.""

He gave a tight smile. “Got it. Definitely not an emergency. You should follow up with your regular OB.” She nodded, still not looking up, and he backed away, curtain swishing closed behind him.

He was halfway back to his stool when his pager buzzed again.

Consult reason: Lower abdominal pain. R/O ectopic.

He gritted his teeth. A rule-out ectopic was never good. He hustled to the room, expecting a pale, doubled-over patient.

Instead, he found a guy on the gurney. Shirtless. Watching Mr. Sunshine on the overhead TV.

Hwang checked the patient ID. Double-checked it.

“You’re... Soo-jin?”

The man didn’t look up from the TV. “Oh nah, bro. She just went to get a Diet Coke.”

Hwang stood there, awkward. “Okay...”

Soo-jin returned a few moments later holding a can and some saltines. She looked fine. Chewing. Chatty. Not dying.

“So what brings you in?”

“I had a cramp earlier. I think it was my appendix, but I peed on a test and it was positive, so the nurse said it might be an ectopic. But like... I don’t think I’m pregnant. I mean, my tubes are tied.”

Hwang stared at her. “When were they tied?”

“Like... seven years ago? After my third baby.”

He pinched the bridge of his nose. “Okay. Look, we’ll do a quick ultrasound, but this sounds... highly not emergent.”

As he walked out, the nurse at the station gave him an apologetic smile. “Sorry. The resident insisted.”

Hwang grunted. “Of course they did.”

He sat down again, barely got logged in, when the pager went off again.

Consult reason: Pelvic mass.

His eyes narrowed. He walked briskly to the assigned bay, prepared to palpate something suspicious.

Instead, he found an 80-year-old woman snoring peacefully under a thin blanket. Her chart was open on the bedside monitor.

Mass was... her bladder.

“Distended bladder,” he muttered. “Pelvic mass, my ass.”

He stormed out of the room and tossed his clipboard onto the nurse's desk with a thwack.

Hwang’s pager buzzed for what felt like the millionth time.

Consult reason: Vaginal bleeding. Stat.

He let out an audible groan. “Jesus Christ. Is it Opposite Day in the ER?”

He grabbed a new surgical mask with the same enthusiasm as someone retrieving a used tissue, then marched down the hall to Room 12. A door was half open, and behind it sat a middle-aged woman in a hospital gown, pale and visibly anxious, a thin sheet draped over her lap. A very green-looking intern hovered awkwardly by the bedside, clutching a clipboard like it was a life preserver.

He sighed and tugged on a pair of gloves. “Hi, I’m Dr. Hwang. I understand you’ve had some bleeding?”

The woman nodded, looking mortified. “Yes. It was bright red when I wiped. I… I thought it was coming from my vagina.”

Hwang kept his expression neutral. “Thanks for telling me. I’m going to take a look now and see what’s going on, okay?”

She nodded, lying back with stiff arms at her sides as the nurse helped guide her feet into the stirrups. Hwang grabbed the speculum from the stand, clicked on the exam light, and gently inserted the instrument.

He peered in.

Clean.

No blood. No discharge. No active bleeding. Her cervix looked pristine. Completely unremarkable.

His brows drew together. “Huh.”

He adjusted the angle slightly, looking lower.

And then he saw it: streaks of bright red blood trailing from the rectum. Not vaginal at all.

He straightened up slowly, removed the speculum with a soft click, and dropped it into the bin with more force than necessary.

The nurse gave him a curious glance. “Nothing vaginal?”

“Nope. Rectal bleeding.” He looked over his shoulder toward the hallway, already knowing which idiot was responsible.

He walked out of the room and found the intern by the nurses’ station, hunched over a chart like he was studying the cure for cancer.

Hwang slammed the chart shut in front of him.

“Do you know where the vagina is?”

The intern jumped. “Uh…yes?”

“Are you sure? Because you paged me for vaginal bleeding and there is not a single drop of blood in the vagina. It’s coming from her rectum.”

“I—I thought she said—”

Hwang scoffed. “You paged OB for rectal bleeding,” he said flatly. “Congratulations. I’m billing you personally for this consult.”

He stormed out of the ED, yelling, “If anyone needs me, I’m going to fucking dental school!”

 

Hwang shoved the stairwell door open with his shoulder and trudged up each step. The echo of his footsteps bounced off the concrete walls, each one a little heavier than the last. His jaw was locked, his fists clenched. The whole ER had been one long parade of absurdity. Vaginal bleeding that was actually hemorrhoids. A positive pregnancy test on a patient with no uterus. A consult for a “pelvic pain” that turned out to be too much kimchi.

He reached the top floor, slammed open the call room door, and stood in the threshold for a second, breathing hard.

Seong was already sprawled on the bottom bunk, one ankle propped on the opposite knee, staring at his phone in the dark. The screen lit up his face in flickers as he watched something with an absurd amount of screaming.

Hwang groaned. “Why is it always so loud when you watch shows? Are they being murdered or just eating dinner?”

“Both,” Seong replied without looking up. “Korean dramas are very efficient.”

“Korean dramas suck.”

Seong chuckled. “You do one fucking fellowship in the states and now you’re too good for us.”

Hwang climbed to the top bunk and flopped onto his side with a grunt. “I’m gonna lose my license over a ruptured hemorrhoid. I can feel it coSeongg.”

“You say that every night.”

“Because every night, someone bleeds from the wrong hole and I get paged like it’s a goddamn code blue.”

Seong finally locked his phone and rolled onto his side, tossing it on the tiny built-in shelf. “Maybe you just have a bad aura.”

Hwang pulled the pillow over his head. “Maybe you snore like a dying pig.”

Seong snorted. “Maybe you cry in your sleep.”

“I have one nightmare about a fish growing legs and chasing me and you never let it go.”

“Because you screamed, Hwang.”

“I was vulnerable!”

A long pause stretched between them, just long enough for the warmth of sleep to start creeping into Hwang’s limbs. He let out a sigh, heavy and tired and slightly less annoyed now that his bones were horizontal.

Beep-beep-beep.

Hwang didn’t budge. He lay motionless on the top bunk, face buried in the pillow, blanket pulled up to his ears. His arm dangled over the edge, limp and dramatic, like he was already halfway to rigor mortis.

Seong stirred below. “Pager.”

Hwang stayed perfectly still. “What pager?”

Seong waited. “Yours.”

“Nope.”

“Yes.”

Hwang shifted just enough to bury his head deeper into the pillow. “Can’t be. That’s not my pager’s ringtone.”

“Pagers don’t have ringtones you asshole.”

Hwang didn’t respond.

Seong sighed. “You’re such a little bitch when you’re tired.”

“I am unconscious. This is a corpse. You are speaking to a body.”

“You’re breathing.”

“No I’m not.”

Seong sat up with a grunt, reached down, grabbed one of his hospital-issued Crocs, and held it for a second like he was aiming a grenade. He then lobbed the shoe up toward the top bunk.. It arced up and smacked Hwang square in the head.

“JESUS CHRIST.”

“You awake now?”

Hwang peeled the blanket off his face just enough to glare downward. “You violated me.”

Seong flopped back down and tucked his hands behind his head. “I had no choice.”

Hwang grabbed the pager off the ledge and groaned as he read the screen. “OB consult. Vaginal bleeding. Stat.”

Seong didn’t even flinch. “Place your bets.”

Hwang swung his legs off the bunk like he was being deployed to war. “If it’s ass blood again, I’m changing my name, moving to North Korea, and never looking back.”

“You say that every night,” Seong said, eyes already drifting shut.

“This time I mean it.”

Hwang shoved his feet into his clogs, yanked on his vest like it had personally wronged him, and slammed the call room door behind him.

Seong barely lifted his head. “Godspeed, bitch.”

 

Hwang walked to the ER like a man heading to jury duty in the rain. Every step was deliberate, heavy, and unhurried. He didn’t rush. Didn’t even try to fake urgency. His clogs slapped against the linoleum floor with the same tired rhythm as his thoughts: It’s going to be nothing. Again. Wrong hole. Again. Some intern panicked because someone bled near a vagina and now I’m the goddamn blood police.

He passed a pair of nurses who looked up at him.

“I thought you were going to sleep, Dr. Hwang,” one of the nurses said, amusement in her voice.

Hwang dramatically tilted his head back and groaned loudly. The nurses chuckled.

He pushed open the door to the room, ready to be annoyed.

And stopped.

Emma Wright was sitting upright on the stretcher, her hospital gown loose around her shoulders, one hand gripping the side rail, knuckles white, groaning in pain. The fluorescent lighting should’ve washed her out. They should’ve made her look sallow and sick like everyone else in the ER. But somehow, she looked ethereal.

Her skin was pale but luminous, like porcelain held up to moonlight. She had natural copper-red hair pulled back into two thick French braids that draped over her collarbones, fraying at the ends from sweat and stress. Her cheeks were flushed, lips parted just slightly as she breathed through her mouth, trying not to panic. There was something wild and alert in her expression—like a deer in headlights, scared but full of fight. Her eyes were huge, rimmed with red but startlingly clear, this impossible shade of green-gray that caught the overhead light and held it.

She looked up and met his gaze.

And Hwang felt something sharp twist in his chest.

Beautiful.

Not in the polished, Instagram-filter way. In the real, visceral way. The kind that made your breath hitch for a second before you remembered to be a doctor.

Then his gaze dropped. And that’s when he saw it.

Blood.

Everywhere.

Smeared across the sheet, pooled between her thighs, already soaking through the pad someone had shoved underneath her. It was too much. Bright red, fast. He could smell the iron in the air. His training kicked in before his brain could even catch up.

“Fuck,” he breathed, stepping forward. “How long has she been bleeding like this?”

The nurse turned, startled. “About twenty minutes. We just got her pressure. Ninety over sixty and falling.”

“Does she speak Korean?”

“No. Not a word.”

Hwang moved fast.

He pressed the back of his gloved hand to Emma’s cheek. It was cold, clammy, too pale.

“Get a CBC, type and screen, stat,” he said to the nurse. “Call the blood bank..”

“BP just dropped again. 86/52.”

Emma whimpered.

He crouched slightly to meet her eyes and spoke in English. “Hey. Emma, right?”

She nodded, barely.

“I know you’re scared. You’re losing a lot of blood, but you’re in the right place. I’m going to figure out where it’s coming from and stop it. But I need to do an exam, okay?”

Tears welled. She nodded.

He pulled the curtain, pulled on a fresh pair of gloves, and rolled a stool toward the foot of the gurney. The room was a blur behind him—nurses pulling supplies, someone calling upstairs, a vitals monitor pinging too fast.

He draped her legs with a sheet.

“Deep breath, Emma.”

He used a swab to clear the blood. Inserted the speculum slowly. Blood coated the blades immediately.

“Almost there… you’re doing great…”

The cervix came into view, and Hwang frowned immediately. The os was open, and blood oozed steadily from it. Not active arterial spurting, but more of a constant, heavy trickle. There were clots, but no visible tissue.

“Any recent procedures?” he asked, not taking his eyes off the field.

“N-no,” she whispered. “I had an IUD put in two years ago. That’s it.”

He nodded slowly. “Still in place?”

“I think so. I haven’t felt anything.”

He gently palpated the strings. “It’s there. Okay.”

She winced. “Ow.”

“Sorry,” he murmured. “That part’s done.”

He removed the speculum and gently palpated her abdomen. The uterus was slightly enlarged. Boggy. Not firm like it should be.

Dysfunctional uterine bleeding? Maybe retained products? Could be hormonal. Could be a spontaneous hemorrhage. Could be…

He stood up and peeled off his gloves, throwing them in the biohazard bin. “We need to do a procedure to stop the bleeding.”

Her eyes widened. “Surgery?”

“A minor one,” he continued. “I’ll explain everything, but I need to act fast. I’m going to have the team bring you upstairs. You’ll be asleep. You won’t feel it.”

“I’m really scared,” she whispered. “I’ve never had surgery before. Or anesthesia. Or… anything.”

He softened a bit and reassuringly placed a hand on her shoulder. “That’s okay. I’ll be there the whole time.”

Emma nodded again, lip trembling.

He turned to the nurse. “Tell the OR we’re coming. I want anesthesia paged. I want her on the board within twenty minutes.”

Hwang stood at the corner workstation, fingers flying over the keyboard as he updated Emma’s chart. The glow of the monitor cast a cold light across his face while nurses bustled around the gurney, peeling off the bulky ED monitors, swapping them for portable leads, snapping both side rails into place with crisp metallic clicks. One nurse gathered the IV tubing and secured it with a fresh strip of tape, while another tucked a blanket around Emma’s legs, moving fast but gentle.

Hwang hit “enter” on the final order, just as the sliding doors parted behind him with a soft whoosh.

Seong strode in, dark blue scrubs slightly wrinkled, his hair tousled like he’d just rolled out of bed—which he probably had. He had a few syringes poking out of his breast pocket and his surgical mask hanging off one ear.

Hwang looked up from the side of the gurney, relief and urgency flashing across his face. “Perfect timing.”

He motioned toward the patient. “Gi-hun, this is Emma.”

Seong gave a polite bow as he approached the bedside. “Hello, Emma. I’m Dr. Seong. I’m the anesthesiologist–”

“She only speaks English,” Hwang cut in, voice low.

Seong stopped mid-sentence and blinked at him, then gave Emma a sheepish smile and switched gears instantly. He approached the gurney, offering a small smile as he met Emma’s eyes and began speaking in English. “Hello, Emma. I’m Dr. Seong. I do sleepy medicine.” He pointed to her IV with a nod. “You feel nervous? I help, okay? You safe with me.”

Hwang could feel the tension in the air thickening by the second – Emma pale and shaking, Seong fumbling through his slow, careful English, the nurses darting around trying to keep up with the bleeding. He glanced at Emma, trying to ground her, then jerked his chin toward Seong with a half-smirk. “Don’t worry,” he said, voice dry. “His English is a train wreck, but his hands are steady and he’s got terrifyingly good aim with narcotics.”

Seong snorted without looking up from the IV line, muttering something that definitely wasn’t a compliment. Emma gave a breathy, startled laugh, and that tiny sound cracked the heaviness in the room just enough for everyone to breathe.

Seong’s smile faded a little as he caught the tension in her eyes. She looked up at him from the gurney, her face pale, lips pressed tight.

“I don’t want to be asleep,” she said quickly, voice shaky but firm. “I’m scared I won’t wake up. I…please, can I stay awake?”

Seong blinked, taken slightly off guard. He looked to Hwang, then back to Emma.

“No sleep?” he repeated slowly, making sure he understood. “You want… awake?”

Emma nodded hard. “If I can. Please. I just…I don’t want to never wake up.”

Seong scratched behind his ear, then gave a thoughtful grunt.  “Okay, we do sleepy but uh-” he couldn’t think of the English word he wanted to use. “Uh, no sleep sleep. Floaty, happy, no sleep. No tube.”

Emma’s eyes searched his face like she was looking for any reason to believe him. “Okay,” she whispered.

“I’ll walk you through everything,” Hwang said. “And Dr. Seong here is excellent. You’ll be safe the entire time.”

Seong grinned. “I got pocket full of magic,” he said, patting the syringes in his scrub pocket. “You feel pain, I fix it fast. These are the good drugs.”

Emma cracked a faint smile, the first Hwang had seen from her since the exam.

Seong picked up the IV line and inserted a syringe filled with midazolam into the port. “Little sleepy now,” he murmured. “Feel strange.”

As the sedative crept into her veins, Emma’s eyes started to flutter. “I still want to be awake,” she slurred in a panic.

“You will be,” Seong promised. “You not missing a thing.”

The gurney wheels squeaked softly as the nurses unlocked the brakes, pivoting Emma toward the hallway. One of them handed Hwang a clipboard of printed vitals and chart notes; he glanced over it quickly before placing it on Emma’s lap with a reassuring tap. “Just for the ride,” he murmured.

The fluorescent lights of the ED flickered overhead as they rolled past curtained bays and open trauma rooms. A transport tech guided the foot of the stretcher while Seong walked alongside her head, one hand loosely on the railing, the other holding her IV tubing aloft. He kept his eyes on the monitor, glancing down now and then to check her expression.

“You okay?” Seong asked, his voice low and thick with accent. “Safe?”

Emma nodded faintly, her fingers curling into the blanket. “Still here.”

“Good,” he said, with a quiet chuckle. “I am too.”

The hallway curved sharply left into the OR wing, where everything changed. The lights were brighter, air colder, the smell suddenly sharp with antiseptic. The automatic double doors whooshed open with a press of the wall button, revealing a surgical suite already prepped and waiting. Blue drapes, stainless steel trays, overhead booms, and a spotlight angled toward the table like a stage light waiting for its star.

A scrub nurse met them at the door and gestured them in. “We’re all set.”

Hwang moved out the way to let the gurney pass through and set off to go scrub in.

The team moved quickly. One nurse unlocked the gurney rails while another held the draw sheet. Emma barely registered the countdown.

“One, two, three—”

She was shifted from the stretcher to the narrow OR table in a smooth coordinated pull. The surface was hard, padded only at the center, her limbs suddenly feeling out of place as the nurses began strapping her arms to supports connected to each side of the table.

Seong leaned over her, securing the blood pressure cuff to her other arm as the monitors came to life with beeps and chirps. He was moving fast, but his tone stayed light, even a little sing-songy.

“You do good noodle,” he said, giving her a quick, crooked smile. “Very brave.”

Emma blinked and lifted her head to look up at Seong, confused. “What?”

Seong tapped her shoulder gently. “Like ramen. Not stiff. You move nice. No fight.”

A scrub nurse snorted. “He means you didn’t flail. It’s a compliment in Dr. Seong-speak.”

Seong nodded solemnly, as if this was the highest praise he could offer. “Good noodle.”

Emma gave a small, shaky laugh - half in terror, half in absurd relief - and let her head fall back against the table.

She was officially a noodle now. A terrified, bleeding noodle about to have surgery. But somehow, she didn’t feel quite so alone.

One tear silently rolled down Emma’s cheeks. Her heart raced, and the monitor echoed her panic in a quickening chorus of sharp beeps.

Seong stood at the head of the table, dark blue scrub cap slightly askew, a syringe already in hand.  “You okay?” he asked Emma gently, his Korean accent softening the edges of his English. He adjusted the IV line and gave a practiced glance at her vitals. “Little more medicine, okay noodle?” He injected more midazolam and slipped the oxygen tubing under her nose, looped it over her ears, then tightened it gently beneath her chin to hold it in place.

Emma nodded again quickly, closing her eyes. More tears dripped out as her eyes shut.

The scrub nurses worked efficiently, their movements practiced and calm. One gently lifted Emma’s right leg into the padded stirrup, adjusting the strap around her thigh to hold it steady. The other did the same on the left, spreading her open and exposed under the bright surgical lights. Emma's fingers clenched as she felt the cold sting of betadine swiped across her vulva, then a second jolt as the soaked sponge was pressed inside her, twisting deeper than she expected. She gasped, startled—not from pain, but from the sudden, intimate invasion. “Just cleaning,” one nurse murmured softly, her tone more clinical than comforting.

“Breathe,” Seong whispered gently, patting her shoulder. “Close your eyes.” He pushed another half milligram of midazolam.

Emma shut her eyes and took a deep shuddering breath through her nose, trying desperately to relax her muscles. Her head spun and she felt dizzy with the addition of more sedation.

Within seconds, the sterile blue drapes were unfolding around her like theater curtains, framing only the surgical field and blotting out the rest of her body.

The door swung open with a quiet hiss as Dr. Hwang stepped in from the scrub room, hands held up at chest level, gloved and glistening. His gown was a crisp sterile blue, tied tight at the back by one of the circulating nurses. He moved with calm precision, eyes scanning the setup as he approached the table. His gaze flicked briefly to Emma. It was just for a moment, but it was enough for her to feel the shift in the air. The light above her buzzed faintly. “Alright,” he said, voice muffled slightly by his mask but still warm, steady. “Let’s get started.”

One of the nurses placed a sterile tray beside him, and he nodded without looking, already positioning himself between the drapes.

“Emma, I’m going to place the speculum now and then give you some numbing injections around your cervix.” Hwang’s voice was gentle and soft. Immediately, he saw her expression change. Her head shot upward and her hand clenched into a tight fist, face full of fear.

“Wait… with a needle?” Her voice was small. Trembling. Tears welled up in her eyes and she began audibly crying.

Hwang stopped what he was doing and set the speculum back down. “Hey, hey. You’re okay,” he said, stepping closer. “Yes, it’s a small needle. But I’ll walk you through every second of it, and I promise to go slow.”

Emma gave a tiny shake of her head. “I don’t do well with needles,” she said, her voice shaking. “I know that sounds childish… Will it hurt?”

Hwang paused, just a second too long. He glanced up at Seong, who stood near Emma’s head, arms crossed, monitoring her vitals. Their eyes met for a beat, a silent “Should we sugarcoat it?”

Seong gave a slow exhale, then nodded.

Hwang turned back. “I’m not going to lie to you. It will be uncomfortable.”

Emma let out a nervous half chuckle. “‘Uncomfortable’ is doctor code for excruciatingly painful.”

Hwang continued, “But it’s quick, and Dr. Seong here,” he nodded to the anesthesiologist, “can help with pain meds to make it easier.”

Emma looked toward Seong, uncertain.

Seong leaned in just a little, voice soft but warm. “I give pain medicine now, okay? You feel floaty.”

Emma’s brow furrowed. “Floaty good or floaty scary?”

“Good,” Seong said with a small grin. “Like… warm cloud. Just breathe.”

He pushed a dose of fentanyl into her IV. The tension in Emma’s shoulders loosened almost instantly. “That’s it,” Seong encouraged.

“Okay,” she murmured, eyes closed. “I trust you guys.”

Hwang adjusted the overhead light. Emma’s breathing hitched again.

“Okay,” Hwang said gently, placing a hand on her knee, “I’m going to start now.”

Emma’s body flinched in anticipatory fear, her legs and arms twitching against the restraints. Hwang could sense her terror and stopped in his tracks. His voice dropped a little, more personal. “Wanna know a trick that helps?”

Emma blinked up at him. “Yeah?”

He reached for one of the glass lidocaine carpules and syringe. “This is the medicine,” he said. “It goes into this syringe. But to use it, I have to smack the back end to lock in the harpoon. Watch.”

He gave the syringe a clean smack against his palm. The harpoon clicked into the rubber stopper with a small snick.

Emma flinched. Then gave a tentative half-smile. “That sounded kinda violent… but satisfying?”

“Oh, it gets better.” He held it up dramatically. “After the injection, I pull back on this sucker, and it makes the best sound in the world.”

He gave a hard tug. The rubber stopper came free with a loud pop, that oddly satisfying sound of pressure releasing.

Emma’s eyebrows lifted. “Oh. Okay. That is kinda good.”

Hwang grinned under his mask. “I call that your reward for making it through each injection.”

“You're bribing me with…. pops?”

“Yes, but you see these pops are better than bubble wrap pops,” he continued. “Four little stings, and you get four pops. Deal?”

She nodded quickly, eyes still glistening but more curious than afraid now. Seong, up by her head, gave a quiet smile and rubbed her upper arm reassuringly. “More noodle. Not firm body, very very noodle.”

Emma laughed. “What is that supposed to mean?”

“He means try to relax your muscles,” Hwang explained. “The more tense you are, the more uncomfortable it will be. Inserting the speculum now…”

Seong gave a quick push of fentanyl in anticipation. The fast push of narcotics made Emma’s nose itch as euphoria and warmness set in. Emma’s body felt heavy – so heavy it was almost painful. Her eyes closed involuntarily and she let out a soft sigh, her ears ringing and the room melting away.

Hwang inserted the speculum and exposed the cervix.

“Okay, first one. Tiny sting on your left side.”

He injected at the 3 o’clock position. Emma gasped softly.

Hwang immediately popped the used carpule out. Pop.

“There’s your first reward,” he said, already sliding in a fresh one and smacking the syringe to engage the harpoon. “Next side, Ready?.”

She tensed but nodded. “Ready.”

Injection two at 9 o’clock. Emma screamed loudly in pain. She squirmed and groaned as the anesthetic was injected.

“You need to give her something stronger,” Hwang barked in Korean at Seong, withdrawing the needle. “I can’t do this with her moving all over the place.”

Seong moved quickly. “Giving a bump of ketamine,” he told Hwang, as he injected the medication into Emma’s. Speaking in English he said, “Ok, Emma. You rocketship, blast off into space now.”

Emma’s muscles quickly relaxed and she seemed to melt into the OR table as warmth spread up her arm and blossomed in her chest. She laid on the table, still at last, the panicked thoughts in her head no longer screaming.

Hwang reinserted the needle and continued injecting.

Pop.

“That one was louder,” Emma murmured, her eyes closed. Her words slurred more and more with each push of sedatives.

“You earned it,” Hwang said. He smacked in another carpule and angled the syringe carefully for the next spot — 12 o’clock.

Emma shut her eyes tightly as the needle went in.

Pop.

“Last one,” Hwang said, inserting the last lidocaine cartridge into the syringe. “You’re doing great.”

She winced hard as it went in. Seong noticed and pushed more fentanyl.

Pop. “That’s four for four.”

She laughed under her breath. “You’re weirdly good at this.”

“Practice,” he said, dropping the syringe on the tray with a metallic clatter. “Okay. That’s it. You’re done with the hard part. We’ll wait a few minutes for it to kick in.”

Seong smiled at Emma under his mask. “High five!” he said, holding up his hand.

Emma stared blankly at him. “Dr. Seong… I can’t move my arms.”

“Oh… right.” Seong reached toward Emma’s strapped-down hand and gently slapped her palm in a clumsy high five.

Emma let out a dazed, amused laugh, her head lolling side to side on the table. Her eyes were glassed over, pupils dilated. “Those drugs,” she slurred, “are so-o-o-o-o good.”

She started giggling. Quiet at first, then louder, her shoulders shaking against the straps. Seong glanced at the monitors, slightly alarmed, until he saw her face: flushed, glazed, and clearly not in pain. Just deeply, chemically unbothered.

“Oh my God,” she slurred, still laughing. “I feel like one of those trashy girls at the bar who can’t walk in heels and keeps falling off the damn stool.”

Hwang raised an eyebrow from behind the drape. “The ones who scream-sing to Beyoncé at 1 a.m.?”

Emma let out an even louder laugh. “Yes! That’s me. I’m Beyoncé girl. I’m…I’m, like… I’m the drunk girl who cries and flirts with the bartender and says her ex didn’t deserve her. Which he didn’t, by the way.”

Seong chuckled softly. “Sedation working good.”

Emma blinked at him, then tilted her head lazily toward the ceiling. “You’re cute,” she said suddenly. “Like… really cute. With your little—” her head lolled side to side, “—your face. And your accent. And your sleepy eyes.”

Hwang cleared his throat. “I’m right here.”

Emma twisted her head toward the sound of his voice and beamed. “You too! You’re hot. You’ve got, like… trauma dad energy. Sexy in a why do I trust you kind of way.”

There was a beat of silence. One of the scrub nurses bit her lip to keep from laughing.

Emma kept going, undeterred. “Maybe after this,” she slurred, “you can take me to a real bar. Like… not a hospital one. A real one. You and me. Both of you. Because normally I don’t let men see all the goods until they’ve bought me drinks..”

Hwang pressed his lips together, a sharp breath catching in his throat as he fought back a laugh threatening to escape. He felt his stomach drop with the realization that this wasn’t just another patient to him… no, he felt something else. Was is lust? Was it love? Whatever it was, it made him feel uncomfortable inside knowing that it was unethical…but so, so right.

Seong leaned over her, adjusting her nasal cannula, face carefully neutral. “Okay, Beyoncé. Maybe time to sleep now?

Emma giggled, loose and giddy. “No, no, I’m having fun. You’re fun. This is fun.”

“She clearly doesn’t remember the last five minutes,” Hwang muttered, mostly to himself.

Emma sluggishly lifted her head, eyes squinting toward him. “What happened?” she asked, brows furrowed—then immediately dropped her head back down with a dramatic thud. “What the fuhhh-k-k-k-k is even going on right now?” Her eyes fluttered shut as she dissolved into uncontrollable laughter, cackling like she’d just told the best joke of her life.

The whole OR cracked. Nurses were trying to keep it together behind masks, one of the techs snorting outright.

“I hate to kill the vibe,” Hwang said, straightening and grabbing a pair of forceps, “but we really do need to get started now.”

Emma’s eyes were still closed, her voice syrupy with sedation. “Baby,” she slurred, grinning like the lights were spinning, “you can do whatever-r-r-r-r-r you want to me.”

Hwang froze mid-motion, then slowly ducked his head, face going crimson under his mask. “Jesus Christ,” he mumbled.

Seong was wheezing silently in the corner. “She call you baby. I quit.”

Rate your coffee standards 1-5 and it shows you which Maryland and DC neighborhoods actually match what you want. The scoring works pretty well. If you are a ""coffee is just fuel/gas"" person it will guide you toward average places. If you are a coffee sl#t, and is the type who debates extraction ratios, it knows to send you to Silver Spring, Georgetown, or Shaw. Also, I tested it on myself (i.e. a level 4 coffee snob) and it reasonably identified my people in the Shaw/Eastern Market area.

Feels nice. I can see why people post here.



I didn’t plan on a part two. I figured I would share the weird thing that happened to me on the scary story board, and people would be happy with that. But I guess I told the story so good, you want more. I get it. The only problem is, what happened next is even harder to believe. I’m not sure I even believe it myself.



Here’s the logical explanation: After I fell in the water, I passed out, some weird things happened in my head, and then I woke up. That happens, right? People pass out and see heaven, or an alternate life where they’re Chinese. Maybe that’s what happened to me.



When I woke up, I was laid out on the dirty tile floor of the pool lobby, surrounded by gawkers and paramedics. My target was gone. She was the one that alerted the clerk I had fallen in. I guess she saved my life. It was an extremely stupid thing to do, but I guess I’m thankful.



The problem is, that’s not all I remember about that night. In my head, there was a whole lot more to it. There was a… something, in the water. Then a boat. Then an island. I felt like I was in that “room” all night, but the clerk says he pulled me out only a couple minutes after I fell in. It doesn’t make any fucking sense.



When I wrote the first part, I was convinced that I had imagined all of the stuff in between. But over the last few nights, I’ve been dreaming about it constantly. I’m not a creative person. I don't write, I don't fantasize, I don't read. But I can still remember it all: the sea creatures, and the man on the boat’s smile, and the sand.



I’ll never understand why people care to read this shit, but… I guess I’ll just tell you what I remember, and let you decide for yourselves whether I’m making it all up.



—--------------------------



“Come back you fucking bitch!” I screamed in the dark. “Open the fucking door!”



I splashed my arms against the water, furious.



How had I fallen in? I saw how far away the door was from the pool before the pool lights went out, and I wasn’t anywhere close. In fact, I was seconds away from grabbing the handle and getting out. But then, all at once, the floor was water. It didn’t figure. It’s like the pool had reached out and grabbed me.



“Good trick! Yeah, alright, you got me!” I shouted again, my words muffled like a pouty child screaming into a pillow. She couldn’t hear me. She was free, and I was here in this fucking pool.



*You’re stuck with it tonight*, she had said.



Bullshit. She was trying to scare me; act like I was trapped in the water with something. Right. No, the truth was that I had severely misjudged distances, and the size of the pool, and I was just turned around. If I picked a direction and swam, I’d find the edge eventually.



So, I started swimming.



The salt water had flooded my eyes when I fell into the pool, and they were stinging like a motherfucker. Not that they were doing me much good anyways. I couldn’t see my hand in front of my face.



I couldn’t find the edge anywhere. And I was starting to get tired.



To make matters worse, my goddamn clothes were sticking to me like cling wrap. I could feel them getting heavier and heavier, dragging against my every stroke. I couldn’t go on swimming like this. I would have to strip.



I peeled off my shirt and let it sink silently down to the bottom of the pool. It skimmed my foot on the way down. I realized then that I hadn’t touched the bottom yet. How deep did this pool go?



There’s a stretch of the Wharfe River in Yorkshire, England called The Strid. It’s only 6 feet across, and from the outside, it looks like any other quaint English creek. If you make the mistake of taking a swim, however, the first thing you would feel is a sucking current. And as you felt for the bottom, you would realize in horror that it wasn’t there–that it was 700 feet below.



In my mind, the pool was even deeper. I imagined being sucked down, whirling helplessly past schools of fish, sea turtles, shipwrecks, leviathans with tentacles a mile long…



I patted myself down and found that all my tools were still on my belt: the wire, the gun, and the gloves.



The idea of dropping my gun was akin to cutting off my hand. I didn’t feel right without it. And the wire was compact enough that I could easily just keep it in the waistband of my briefs. The gloves, however, had to go. I released them into the darkness, followed by my shoes, my socks, and my pants. There I was, treading water in my underwear with a gun in my hand, like an Alcatraz escapee. 



That’s when I felt something brush my bare foot.



It felt like the playful tickle of a finger.



I kicked out instinctively, and when I did I made contact with something. It was smooth and squishy like… well, like human skin. 



Like someone was swimming beneath me.



“What the fuck?” I screamed, my words still a useless rattle in my head. My entire body pulled up like I was trying to fold in on myself. “Get the fuck away!”



I pointed the gun down into the water in panic and pulled the trigger. I barely heard the gunshot; it sounded like a balloon popping fifty feet over my roof. I felt the pressure change as the bullet whizzed past my leg, and I realized in a split second that I had been inches away from shooting off my own foot. I hadn’t planned on shooting. Frankly, I was surprised the gun still fired after so long in the water. It was completely instinctual. So, when the recoil flashed up my arm, it slipped right out of my hands.



“No, no, no!”



I reached down desperately into the black water to catch it. I got a finger across the barrel, still hot from the gunshot, but it bounced right off and dropped like a stone down through the dark waters into the deep. Just like that, my gun was gone.



“Fuck me!” I cried. 



I had no idea if I had hit anything, but considering it was a literal shot in the dark, the odds weren’t in my favor. More than likely, the thing (I didn’t want to entertain the idea that it was a human being) was still somewhere below the surface of the water. Hell, it could be right in front of me, staring into my eyes silently, watching me, and I would’ve had no idea; that was how complete the darkness was. The idea was enough to turn my stomach.



For a moment I imagined I could hear it breathing beside me, but I quickly shook the illusion. I took a few deep breaths of my own and composed myself.



That must be the “it” my target was referring to as she left. I guess it found me.



There was nothing I could do about that. If this thing was trying to kill me, it could have done that a long time ago. Not to mention, if this thing was lethal, why would that woman choose to swim with it every week?



If it was still here, I just wished it wouldn’t touch me again. That was a wish that I’m pretty sure didn’t come true.



I kept swimming. 



It didn’t take long before I saw the lights.



Between strokes, I picked up a faint glow in the distance.



My heart leapt. The door? Had I swam all this time, for what felt like hours now, and finally reached the exit? *Just keep swimming* was all she told me, and I did what she said.



But… this wasn’t a single point of light. The shape was all wrong, nothing like an open door, and the color was off too. It looked like the residual blue on the horizon after the sunset; like a soft brushstroke laid along the surface of the waters ahead.



I began to swim faster. Whatever it was, it was better than darkness. My body was beginning to ache, the skin on my extremities was completely pruned, and I was feeling nauseous from all the salt water I’d accidentally drank. The worst part, though, was that the water was getting colder. It felt like I had swam out of the shallows on a summer coast and into the middle of the Pacific. My energy was almost depleted. I had to get out of the water.



As I approached the blue lights, I thought about Virgo’s. The idea of a nice hot burnt cup of coffee sounded like a dream. When I got home, I was going to give Mike the biggest hug. (And I did, too. He hated it almost as much as I did)



The closer I got to the light, the more vast it seemed. I think it was moving towards me, too, because before I even realized it, the light had begun to envelop me. All around was a sea of little blue points of light, like bioluminescent jellyfish, or algae, or something. It was like swimming in stars. 



I’m not a whimsical person. If someone told me about a “spiritual experience”, I’d laugh in their face. But, I have to admit… this was wonderful. For a brief moment, I forgot how tired I was, and the screaming ache of my muscles quieted. I scooped out a handful of water. I had one of the lights in my hand. It was alive, I think, because it drifted from one end of my hand-pool to the other, then back again; not really swimming, but floating with intention. What a cool creature. My curiosity satisfied, I poured it back into the water to be with its friends again.



As I did, I saw the outline of my hand against the glowing water. I could *see* something. I hadn’t even registered that fact until that moment.



I looked down into the water and saw my legs kicking among the blue spots.I saw the pattern on my underwear. I saw the hair on my shirtless chest. After hours of being in complete and total darkness, without even the ability to cross my eyes and see my nose, I could actually see *myself* again. 



I smiled.



It occurred to me in my excitement that maybe the blue creatures marked the beginning of a different zone of this place. If there was light now, then maybe there would be sound again, too. Dare I dream?



“Hello?” I said tentatively. The words didn’t dribble from my lips; they sounded out across the waters. Beyond the vibrations in my head, I could actually hear myself again, too.



I realized then that up until that point, I had already mentally forfeited to the darkness. Though I kept swimming, hope had quietly packed up and left me. My subconscious was certain that the creature below would pull me down to join it, or I would succumb to exhaustion and follow my clothes to the unknown depths of this cursed fucking pool.



But, with my senses returned, I found a second wind. I had to get the hell out of this place.



“AHHHHHH!” I shouted. I don’t really want to admit how long I made senseless, barbaric noises, just savoring the sound of my own voice.



“I’m coming home, bitch! I’m coming!”



I spun around in the expanse of blue light.



That’s when I heard a *snap*. Not like a branch cracking; like fingers.



I stopped spinning. There was something a few feet away from me in the water, sticking straight up like a tree branch.



As my eyes focused, my smile eroded from my face in an instant.



It was a human hand. And it was waving.



I recoiled, screaming. I splashed violently at the water in an attempt to move away from it. This was the creature–the hand that had grazed my foot. God only knew what the rest of it looked like beneath the water, but I had a hard time imagining it was human. 



The hand didn’t chase me. It stopped waving and did another gesture: it laid its palm flat and moved the hand down towards the water. I understood it. *Hush*, it was saying, like a teacher at an assembly lowering the kids’ volume level.



I stopped moving away. I stared at the hand, my brow furrowed, panting. Any moment it would lurch forward to drown me. Any… moment…



Instead, it gestured again: it pointed one long index finger directly at me (*You!,* it said) and then beckoned me, folding its fingers into its palm repeatedly (*Come here*).



“No, no, stay the fuck away from me,” I said. I had no idea if the thing could understand me, but I said it anyways. “Don’t touch me.”



The hand gave me a thumbs up. *Okay, I won’t*.



I was still scared to death of the thing. I don’t know if it was a trick of the light or not, but it seemed like it was floating closer and closer to me. I would swim back, subtly, and it would close the gap. It wanted to be near me.



It did several more gestures, but at the time, I had no idea what it was trying to tell me. First, it bounced its palm against the water, skimming. *A wave?* I thought. I hadn’t seen a single wave since I had started swimming. It was a pool, after all.



Next, with a flat hand, it plunged in the water, and stayed for a moment. *Dive*? *Hide*? I wasn’t sure. 



Then, it made its index and ring fingers into legs and ran with them along the water, away from me. *Run*, or *run away*, perhaps, but I wasn’t following. From what? From a wave? From it? It occurred to me that this could just be some twisted game the creature liked to play. Tantalus-style torture, maybe, just like the kind I thought my client might be enacting against the woman. Now, though, I understood why my client wanted me to get her before she touched the water. It was a portal of some kind, to the domain of this strange creature. And I couldn’t shake the feeling that no matter what it communicated, it was trying to hurt me, somehow.



Finally, it pointed at me again, this time with the thumb up like a finger gun, and then brought the hammer down. *Bang*.



Was it referring to when I shot at it earlier?



“I don’t know what you’re trying to say,” I said, frustrated. “Can… can you understand me?” It seemed to acknowledge my request earlier, but the idea that it could understand my words made me deeply uncomfortable. It had no ears, and a human wouldn’t be able to hear me underwater. But if it could, then perhaps it could tell me how to get out of this place.



The hand gave a thumbs up again.



I wasn’t sure what to make of that. I chose to stop worrying. I was powerless. If the hand, whatever it was, wanted to hurt me, there was nothing I could do about that. But, on the off chance it wanted to help me, I needed to stop being so damn scared and communicate with the thing.



“How do I get out of here?” I asked softly.



The hand didn’t move for a while.



“Listen, I’m sorry I shot at you, I didn’t mean to, I swear to God,” I said, “but you gotta help me out, here. I’m tired, and I need to get out of the water.”



The hand still didn’t move.



“Fucking figures. You know…” I began, but just then, I started to hear a noise.



*hmmmmmmmmmm*



It was coming from behind me. I turned around to see a shape moving along the water in my direction. A boat?



I looked back at the hand with a smile on my face. It was gesturing wildly. *Wave* (?), *hide, run away*, *bang*.



I grew tired of the creature’s game. 



*HMMMMMMMMMMM*



The shadow of the boat grew larger as it approached; I saw a kerosene lamp on board, and by its light I could make out the figure of a man waving his arm over his head. Help had arrived. 



“Over here!” I cried. I began to swim towards the boat.



Suddenly, the hand was in front of me. *Hush*, it gestured. *Run.*



Emboldened by the prospect of freedom, I swam right past it. It didn’t reach out to touch me, just like it said it wouldn’t.



I began to have doubts. Was the hand truly trying to help me after all?



No, no. I remembered its little trick underwater with my foot that nearly caused me to shoot my toes off, and its silence when I asked for help. The person on the boat was a man; the thing in the water wasn’t. Even if this guy wasn’t of the purest intention, he still had a boat. Worst case scenario, I would commandeer it. I still had the length of wire. In any case, it beat being in the water with this… thing.



“Over here!” I hollered through a mouthful of salt water. The paddling was more than my body could handle. My swimming slowed to a crawl. God, I remember how cold I felt just then, chilled down to the bone. I don’t think I could have lasted another ten minutes in that water.



I heard a splash.



Underlit by the blue light, like the woman’s face, I saw a life preserver bobbing in the ripples.



“I see you, buddy!” the man called from the boat. He had a soothing, confident voice, like he wasn’t worried at all.



With my last vestiges of strength, I swam in long strokes towards the disc, quickly closing the distance.



Just as the ends of my fingers touched the rope laced around the edges of the preserver, the hand appeared again. It gripped the preserver, and began to drag it away from my reach.



“No!” I shouted helplessly. I tried to follow after it, but I was moving at a snail’s pace now, my head thundering, my chest heaving up and down, each breath draining traces of salt water into my lungs and stomach. I was starting to drown. It was much more subtle than they make it seem in movies.



“I don’t think so, you little bastard!” the man hollered, and then came the blast of a shotgun. Reflexively I ducked my head underwater. Thousands of the little blue creatures drifted around me in that peaceful moment. I looked down at my body. I was still intact–not a single hole in me, and no pain.



I popped my head above the surface and saw that the hand was gone.



The life preserver, though, was still too far for me to reach.



My head dipped back underwater again, this time without my permission. But I was powerless to fight it. I was beginning to sink.



A peace fell over me. All the glowing creatures around me seemed to close in, and then dim, slowly, slowly, until it was as dark as before they arrived. Perhaps I would find out how deep the pool went, after all. Frankly, it was a better ending than I deserved. So of course, I didn’t get it.



I felt a hand grab mine.



When I awoke, I was aboard the boat. I was wearing several layers of clothing now, dry clothing, and I could see by the glow of the lamp that the boat’s captain was seated across from me, reloading his shotgun and looking anxiously at me as I stirred.



“Oh, thank god,” he said. “ I thought I did all that mouth-to-mouth for nothing.” Then he laughed, a hearty belly laugh.



I sat up slowly. My head was still pounding, and I was shaking from the cold, but I could feel the tingle of my nerves in my extremities, and I knew that I would be okay after a while.



“Thank you,” I managed. I didn’t like needing help. It wasn’t something I was used to.



I coughed. My throat was sore from the salt water. That was weird to me. Growing up, my mom would make me gargle salt water to *treat* a sore throat. I guess there’s a big difference between gargling and drinking.



“Listen, try to stay close to the lamp, alright?” he said. I nodded and shuffled closer to it.



There was a sizzling sound. Through the lamplight I could see that the captain had a small gas stove set up in the corner, and he was frying something in a mini cast iron pan.



“I got some fish in the cooler I’m about to fry up, if you want some,” he offered. “ This here is for me though. Appetizer.”



Whatever it was, it smelled delicious. Eating hadn’t even crossed my mind in the water, but I realized then that I was absolutely starving. It felt like an eternity ago that I had walked down the employee hallway and opened the mysterious black door.



The captain poured what looked like a handful’s worth of nuts into a bowl and blew on them to cool.



“Well, I’m glad I came by when I did,” he said. “That thing in the water…”



“I woulda f-figured it out,” I stuttered. ""But I’m glad you did, too.”



“You were bluer than the algae when I pulled you up,” he laughed, but I didn’t laugh along; I didn’t really want to think about it. I was warm now, at least.



“Listen, I know you probably just want to rest but, I gotta ask: how the hell did you end up all the way out here?”



“Long story,” I said simply.



“We got time,” he said.



“Where are we going?”



“Welp… that’s up to you, I guess. I was headed north, up towards the island, but I suppose if you wanted me to I could take you south back home.” He didn’t sound thrilled about the idea, but I nearly leapt out of my seat. I would’ve, too, if it wasn’t for a throbbing pain in my foot when I put pressure on it.



“Could you really? I-I’m dying to get out of here, man. Please.” I sounded more desperate than I wanted, but it was hard to contain it. 



“You got it, brotha,” he said, and with a swift maneuver of the on-board engine, he turned the boat around and started us on our way.



I felt the wind blowing through my hair as we cut through the darkness. The boat bounced up and down, slapping against the water in a rhythmic hum. I remembered the hand’s first obtuse gesture, the *wave*, and I suddenly understood it: *boat*. The message finally clicked. 



*Hide and run from the boat, he has a gun*.



Clearly, that was a warning only the creature needed to heed. If the hand had its way, I would be drowned by now. I looked over the sides of the boat to see if I could make out any figures following us in the glowing blue water, but I couldn’t. *Good riddance*, I thought.



The nuts had apparently cooled, so the captain took them in his hand and threw one back with a loud *CRUNCH*.



My stomach grumbled. My foot ached, a little more than everything else. I must’ve hit it on something when the captain pulled me into the boat. I couldn’t be mad at the guy.



“You think you could manage that story, now?” he asked me, an eyebrow raised.



So I told him. I told him everything I told you all in my first post, about the job, the woman, the room. He just listened quietly, nodding along. 



“So, you were going to kill that blonde woman, huh?” he asked.



I didn’t know he knew her. I figured she was as much of an interloper in this weird place as I was.



“Yeah. Just business. Nothing personal,” I said, hoping she wasn’t his wife or something.



“I wish you woulda killed her,” he grumbled.



Huh. Not only did he know her, but he wanted her dead, too. I was relieved.



“I tried,” I said. “I didn’t expect… this.”



I looked overboard and saw that the algae had dispersed, and the water was once again dark. The lamp was the only light.



“I’ve been trying too, man.”



“To… kill? That woman?”



“Oh yeah. Every week I’m out here hunting for her. But that fucking hand… they communicate with each other. It’s like they’re friends or something. Every time I think I found her, she disappears.” He sighed and threw back another nut with a *CRUNCH,* even louder this time.



“Why?” I asked.



“Why does the hand help her, or why am I trying to kill her?”



“Both, I guess.”



“She helped the hand, and now it helps her. That’s all I know, really. As far as my hunting her… it’s complicated,” he said with a shrug.



“We got time,” I reminded him. He smiled.



“Not much more. We’re just about here,” he said. “All you really need to know is that they put me here to protect the island, and she’s a threat.”



He turned off the engine. We slowed down to a stop in the water.



“Are we here?” I asked.



“Almost,” he said thoughtfully. “You know something, man?”



I looked around at the darkness, hoping to find the light of the doorway somewhere in it. Why did we stop short? Did he really know where the exit was exactly, or would I have to find it myself? As long as I didn’t have to get back in the water…



“What’s that?” I replied absently.



“It’s just us out here,” he said. “In all this dark.”



I looked at him. He was just sitting there looking back. I studied him: he had broad shoulders, 5’o’clock shadow, and a dark coat on. His hand was still cupped holding the roasted nuts, and he threw another back. He looked like anyone else back home; like any guy on the street.



I also noticed that the gun he had been cleaning before was now resting casually on his knee, pointed straight at me.



“Is it really? Aren’t there other people in this place?” I asked, as calmly as possible.



“Maybe. But for now, out here… it’s just us. You know something else?”



“What?”



“I could do anything I want to you right now, and no one could stop me.”



I didn’t move. I focused on keeping my breath even. I just smiled at him politely.



“Like what?” I asked.



“Anything I want. Like I said. Don’t you listen?” he said. He was talking just like before, no change in his tone. Just like any guy on the street.



“Take off your sock,” he demanded quietly.



“Why?”



“Because I asked you to.”



“Which one?”



“The one that’s been hurting you.”



I reached down cautiously to my left foot and peeled off the sock he had placed over it while I had been asleep.



Beneath, it was a mess of blood. My toes, or rather, the place they had been, was wrapped in seeping red bandages. As I realized the extent of the injury, the pain came rushing in. My entire leg throbbed.



The captain threw back another “nut” with an even louder ***CRUNCH***.



He laughed, a deep belly laugh. “Isn’t that a great moment?” he said. He extended the last toe to me. “Here, I saved the big one for you.” He laughed again.



I laughed too. I didn’t know what else to do. 



“Why?” I asked. I couldn’t understand. 



I had no desire to scream. I wasn’t really all that afraid, even; just like in the water, my body had accepted that I was going to die. In my line of work, every job is a chance at death, so life doesn’t mean so much. All I really wanted to understand was why this was happening–why wouldn't he let me go home?



“They used to let me eat the escapees, but not anymore. I still got a taste for it. Consider it your toll,” he said casually.



“No, you fucking monster,” I growled, “why can’t I leave?”



“Oh, that. Well, here’s the deal: I don’t protect the island by keeping people out,” the captain said. “I keep ‘em in.”



I set my foot back down on the ground. It flashed with pain as the bandages made contact with the wood.



“Look real close,” he said. “See, way out there?”



I looked out in the distance. At first, I saw nothing. But after a few moments, I started to make out a light against the darkness–just a small pinpoint of yellow.



“That’s the Island. I figured I’d give you just a glimpse, since you came so far. That’s where your blonde friend’s from.”



“Why-” I began, fighting down a wave of pain, “-don’t you just let me go to the Island?”



“What, so I can have another blonde bitch clone to give me trouble? Listen, if you’d have killed her, I would’ve let you go to the island toll free–hell, I might’ve even let you go home–but you didn’t,” he said. “ So now, it’s time to tie up loose ends.”



I squinted as he brought the shotgun up out of his lap and leveled it at me.



Then I heard a clatter.



I glanced down. It was my gun.



The captain and I looked overboard simultaneously.



There was the hand, poking out of the water. I could barely see it by the lamplight.



It pointed a finger gun at the captain and dropped the hammer. *Bang*. Then it was gone.



I had the hand’s message all wrong. It was the same message it probably told the blonde woman as she swam away from the island: *If the* ***boat*** *comes:* ***hide****,* ***run****, and when all else fails…* ***Bang***.



The captain and I both looked down at the gun again. Then I sprang for it.



I had the gun in my hand when I felt a peppering of buckshot in my right shoulder.



The blast was deafening. Weak and disoriented already, my head swam and my ears rang at the sound.



The kerosene lamp fell. I heard it shatter on the ground as the boat descended into darkness.



I switched the pistol to my left hand. I had no idea where the captain was, nor if the pistol would fire a second time, but I pulled the trigger anyway.



Another blind shot.



*Bang.*



I knew I hit him when I heard the splatter of his brain on the hull.



Whether or not the captain was dead.. I couldn’t know.



*Try not to let it find you*.



The *it* wasn’t the hand, after all; it was the captain and his hunting boat.



All was quiet for a long moment. I lowered my pistol to my side, placing it in my jacket pocket. It was hard to believe I almost didn’t take it along with me.



But then, I heard a horrible wail. It was a long, wretched cry of mourning, neither masculine nor feminine.



It was coming from the Island.



Immediately, I heard something approaching quickly from my left.



It started as a low grumble, and slowly swelled into a thunderous roar.



I ducked down, holding tightly to the rib of the boat. It was a wave. I could feel the waters shifting beneath me long before it arrived.



The water folded on top of me with unimaginable force. The small boat didn’t stand a chance–I was torn free and tossed helplessly through the black waters. Everything was a swirl of motion. I reared up out of the water to catch my breath, only to be beaten back under by another wave, and another, until I was certain that I would never surface again. 



In the tumult, I caught glimpses of the pinpoint of yellow light growing brighter and brighter, like sun shining down on me, or perhaps the light at the end of the tunnel.



I’m certain that I felt a hand tugging at my collar, but at what point, and whose, I couldn’t possibly say.



When I awoke, I was lying on the shores of the Island.",4,1749436724.0,nosleep,4,1.0,False

Just got this USB rechargeable milk frother, and wow,  it’s a game changer for my morning routine. It has three adjustable speeds, so I can get the perfect foam for everything from cappuccinos to matcha lattes.

No more fumbling with batteries because it charges via USB, which is super convenient whether I’m at home or traveling. The stainless steel whisk is really powerful and fast, but surprisingly quiet too.

I’ve also used it for whisking eggs and mixing protein shakes, it’s way more versatile than I expected. Plus, it’s easy to clean; just detach the whisk and rinse it off.

If you love café-quality foam without the fancy machine, this little gadget is totally worth it.

I don’t ghost. I don’t breadcrumb. If I’m not feeling a connection, I’ll be honest—and I hope you’ll do the same for me.

That said, I’m also open to starting as friends and seeing where things naturally go.
 
I’m 34, Asian, 5'7"", and based in the Golden State. I work in IT at a hotel management company and I drink at least one cup of coffee a day (sometimes two—no shame).

I’m a bit socially awkward at first, but I open up quickly with the right person. I value depth in connection and tend to wear my heart on my sleeve. I have an anxious-preoccupied attachment style—so I do best with consistent, clear communication and reassurance. Emotional availability and intentional effort mean a lot to me.

In relationships (or friendships that have potential), I show up with honesty, consistency, and a willingness to talk about both the hard stuff and the fun stuff. I feel most comfortable with someone who’s kind, emotionally mature, and genuinely present. You don’t have to have it all figured out—just be growing, self-aware, and open to building something real.

A few things about me:

* I’m a homebody at heart, but I do go outside (yes, I touch grass)
* I love video games specifically ones with co-op because gaming is always better with company
* Movie/TV/anime enthusiast
* I read manga, manhwa, and light novels
* My favorite animal is the sloth (fun fact: they’re surprisingly great swimmers!)
* I love marine animals (where are my fellow orca fans?)
* Currently obsessed with funny animal voiceover videos on YouTube (shoutout to KLR Productions)
* Huge foodie—yes, I would 100% travel just to try a new dish
* Have the travel bug: Been to Japan, Thailand, Mexico, and Canada so far
* Psychology nerd
* Big-time texter, curious listener, and supportive friend
* Atheist | Leo | INFP | Overthinker—but in a good way (usually)

You might be someone who’s:

* Non-smoker
* Emotionally intelligent, kind, and respectful
* Open and direct with your communication
* Consistent and caring
* Shares some interests with me—or has new ones to introduce me to
* Child free

Whether you're looking for a meaningful friendship or open to something more, I’m excited to connect with someone genuine.

A few preferences:

* Ideally, you’re based in the U.S. (closer to the West Coast is a plus, but not required)
* I’d love to eventually move from texting to voice/video chats on Discord once we’re both comfortable

If any of this resonates with you, say hi! When you reach out, tell me a bit about yourself, share your top 3 dream travel destinations.

I’m really looking forward to meeting someone who’s open, genuine, and just as excited to build a real connection.

Our favorite activities were Kyoto Railway Museum, Ryoan-Ji, Bamboo trail at Fushimi Inari & walking the river and stepping stones.

My fiancee and I are getting married in a matter of weeks and I think I’m finally starting to realize how fucked I am. We met in high school but didn’t know each other too well, had some light hookups right before we went off to college, and started an LDR while we were at school. We didn’t talk about sex or intimacy too much but we at least tried to make some use of the brief visits or holidays we had together, though they weren’t especially frequent. Early on, she set boundaries about things like nudes or phone sex that she wasn’t very comfortable with stuff like that - I never pushed. I remember when we’d been dating less than a year, she talked me into sneaking out on my campus late at night for an outside encounter. When we both came home for the summer, it felt like there was never any time where we were just alone - we both worked and she spent a lot of time with her family, I wasn’t great at being clear and honest about what I wanted. To an extent, this is a big part of the problem - I’m always scared to inconvenience or annoy people by needing things. But I figured, there were reasonable explanations and factors that make alone time difficult. So I left it alone.

Four years of college went by, I assumed that maybe intimacy would be easier when we were both home, we’d see each other more regularly, have more excuses to hang out alone since our relationship was clearly serious and committed, that sort of thing. I was wrong. We rarely got true alone time since she was always saying how uncomfortable she was having sex with other people in the house, wherever we were. Then I moved out of my childhood home to live by myself - really I was forced out. She wasn’t ready to move away from her parents because of COVID and the uncertain economy, and the timetable on my move was really fast and unexpected, so we couldn’t really move in together right away. Even so, I thought, surely now that we at least have a place where we are guaranteed to have however much alone time we need, we’ll have some more activity together. If anything, we started having any form of anything more serious than kissing even less. Once every month or so became once every two months. I figured, we still spend a lot of time around her family. I just kept making excuses, even though I was struggling so much with the lack of intimacy. Then she moved out to an apartment with roommates, and despite the fact that it felt like we were getting a lot more privacy in general, I think it only really served to show me just how frequently we spent alone time together without any form of physical connection beyond cuddling and light kissing. 

Throughout the course of our relationship, I would sometimes voice my concerns about how little sexual activity we shared, and she would always agree with my concerns while assuring me that things would be different when we moved in together, we would have a lot more opportunities and privacy, we could try to explore things, maybe try to incorporate toys or other aspects to try and make sex more exciting and fun. I thought that meant that she honestly believed that things would change. I’d spent years being patient about our relationship because of long distance complications and everything, what was just a little longer?

Fast forward to late 2022, we finally got a chance to move in together and took it. We’d been talking about living together for a while, and we got a nice apartment together. Moving in was a bit of a whirlwind, and adjusting to living together full time was definitely a bit of a struggle, but I imagine it was no worse than what most couples who finally get to see each others’ living habits after years of knowing one another experience. In any case, once we finally settled in, I thought, maybe now, finally, there could be a substantial increase in our intimacy and sexual relationship. I was wrong.

In the two and a half years we’ve been living together, I think we’ve had full-on sex maybe 5 or 6 times total, and only a few more times of “other” activities. She barely even seems to like kissing me, as she’ll sometimes get annoyed when I just want to sit with her and do light kissing. Even when I make it clear that I would be a little happier if we just made out a bit more once in a while, she insists that she doesn’t want to give mixed signals or let things escalate into something she doesn’t want to do - so even kissing is an issue in a decade-long relationship. In terms of the sex itself, it isn’t even that great. I try my best to be an attentive and generous partner, but it’s like she actively dislikes getting off. She doesn’t do very much to engage actively in sex, and will discourage me from trying to give her oral or my fingers otherwise, and she won’t do anything to me unless I ask for it or instruct her to. Initial penetration is always complicated because it seems to hurt her, and when I’ve said she should talk to her gyno or do some research on conditions she’s waved me off and never done anything about it. If this is why she doesn’t want to have sex - that it doesn’t feel very good for her or she just doesn’t experience much pleasure - then I could understand, if it didn’t seem like there was some sort of underlying issue causing these things, on top of the fact that her general attitude about sex isn’t good to begin with. She doesn’t seem to understand why it bothers me that she doesn’t actively seek out sex with me - “I don’t mind doing it if you ask!” (Which isn’t even true, since a lot of the times when I ask ahead of time or try to schedule sex, it gets forgotten). 

In the meantime, I do my best to be a dutiful partner. I take care of almost all of our chores, I take care of her when she’s sick, I cook most nights, I make her lunch and coffee for when she goes to work, I take her on date nights, buy flowers, encourage her to spend time with her friends, hold her when she cries, talk her through her frequent episodes of anxiety and depression, whatever I can do. I love this woman with all my heart and the biggest thing I want is for her to be happy and to have the capacity to make her happy.

I’ve brought up several times how awful all of this makes me feel - I feel unattractive, I feel like my needs aren’t important, I feel like I do so much for her without regard for myself, I feel like if I never asked for sex that it wouldn’t happen at all, and that if that was true that it wouldn’t even bother her. Every time we talk about it, she’s receptive and understanding and talks about feeling bad or guilty - she knows how much I want more sex and she knows she doesn’t give me enough of it. Of course, then I just feel shitty for needing something from her. But now, with our wedding coming up in a pretty short time frame, I think I’m finally coming to accept that it was only ever going to get worse. 

It clicked for me the last time we talked about sex. I was talking about how we used to do a lot of things differently when we were younger, and how I feel lately that she sees sex as more of a chore than something fun to enjoy with me. I asked if she remembered the night we snuck around campus where she pulled me out of sight and we had some fun in a pretty public spot - she gave me an incredulous look and said that she was young and stupid and had just been trying to impress me. It hit me then, the realization that I don’t think she’s ever really enjoyed sex and has only ever engaged in sexual activity with me for my benefit. She claims she isn’t asexual, but I’m really just not convinced.

The thing is, I love her to death for a lot of reasons outside of sex, and I’ve always been deeply ashamed of my sex drive and desire for physical intimacy. I had deep-seated self esteem issues in high school, and she was the first - and only - girl I had ever hooked up with casually. I was used to a lot of rejection from girls in high school, and it made me feel like my want for sex was a shameful and bad thing for me to indulge - that I shouldn’t try to end a serious and committed relationship just because I want to get my dick wet more often. I felt that if I was just patient and considered all the reasonable explanations for decreased sexual activity, that at some point some magic switch would be flipped and we’d be fucking like rabbits. Well, I think a switch has been flipped - the one where the lights come on and I finally see how I’ve been lying to myself for years, that I knew it was never going to be better, but I allowed myself to be convinced that it was *okay* for me to ignore my own wants and needs so that I wouldn’t be a burden.

Reddit, I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to just leave her, especially now that the wedding is so close. I also don’t know how I’m going to live the rest of my life believing, I’ll get sex three times a year at the absolute best for the next couple, then probably after we have a kid or two basically never. 

ETA: I realize this post probably makes it seem like I have a very high opinion of myself or like I’m doing nothing wrong. I’m well aware of the fact that I could just be doing something wrong or that just because I talk about how nice I am to take out the trash and do dishes that I don’t just deserve sex. I just don’t want people to read this post and think that I must assume I’m perfect and don’t do anything wrong.",0,1749436459.0,relationship_advice,13,0.4,False
1l6tqu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1l6tqu2/the_barista_at_my_favorite_coffee_shop_wont_say/,"The barista at my favorite coffee shop won’t say my name, even though we went to high school together.","There’s a coffee shop downtown next to the park. If you go there at the right time, you can avoid the early morning rush. But arrive too late? You’re stuck behind a long line of hipsters.

I like the place because it’s five minutes from my apartment. Just a straight walk out the door and a few minutes later, I’m sipping the best latte in Southern California.

But the one thing that irks me about the place is the barista, Steve.

He never remembers my name, even though we went to high school together. I mean, sure. People drift apart. Times change. But we were close for a couple years, until he transferred out to another school.

It just seemed odd to reconnect and…no matter how many times I reminded him…he never recalled my name. 

This whole ordeal started last summer. I had just accepted a new job and was eager to impress my boss. I hustled into the cafe, workbag slung over my shoulder, and heard: “Hey, it’s you.”

I recognized the voice instantly. “Steve?” 

Sure enough, Steve was behind the counter, making drinks. He still had that trademark curly hair and thick glasses, like he was straight out of Silicon Valley.

“Nice to see you, man…”

We made our reintroductions, and I ordered. Everything seemed normal at first, but when he went to write down my name, he hesitated. “I’m sorry, what’s your name again?”

“Harry.”

“That’s right. How could I forget?”

He wrote it down and I paid. That was that. 

Weeks turned into months. Steve was there almost every morning. Each time, I’d have to remind him as confusion spread across his face.  

“It’s Harry, remember?”

“Right. Silly me.”

He’d scribble my name on the cup, and I’d play it off. But if I was being honest, it bothered me. And the more it happened, the angrier I got.

One day, I built up enough courage to ask him: “Steve, what’s going on, man? We’ve interacted for, like, three months. You still don’t remember my name.”

“No. I’m sorry.” 

“We hung out every day in high school.” 

“Yeah. Trippy.”

“I think that’s pretty odd.”

“Must be a confusing name.”

“Harry?!”

“I understand your frustration. I’ll do better. I promise.”

I left the shop, annoyed, but satisfied that he’d sworn to try harder.

That promise didn’t last long.

The next day, the same thing happened. I was so irritated! 

I decided to confront Steve, once and for all, but this time, outside the coffee shop.

I waited in the park across the street. Watched him exit the cafe at four fifteen. 

He must’ve lived nearby because he didn’t climb into any cars or call a rideshare. He just slung his backpack over his shoulder, headed for downtown. 

I trailed him for about five blocks when I finally called out. “Steve!”

He stopped and raked his gaze toward me. “Hey! It’s —”

And then it happened…his mind blanked.

“— Harry!” 

“Right. Right. I’m sorry. What’s up, Bud?”

I hurried to his position, doing my best to act calm.

“Look, Steve, this might not be a big deal, but I have to ask. What’s with the name thing?” 

“The name thing?”

“Why can’t you remember my name?!”

At this, Steve’s eyes widened and his lips twitched. He arched his back like he was in severe pain.

“Steve, you okay?”

“Yes. I’m okay.” His voice sounded strange, robotic. “What were you asking me?”

“It’s just weird that I’ve been coming to your shop for four months. Every time I order you forget my name. I have to remind you each time. I just wanted to know…are you trolling me? Did I piss you off in high school and now you’re getting back at me?”

“Oh no,” Steve said. “It’s not that at all. It’s just…”

He started hitting his chest, like he was having a panic attack. 

“Steve, relax. I didn’t mean to freak you out—”

“Your name is Harry. Your name is Harry. Your name is Harry.”

“Steve! Chill!”

“YournameisHarry. YournameisHarry. YournameisHarry.”

I grabbed Steve’s arm, trying to calm him. 

But he tore free, started running in a circle.

I backed away. My voice soft and measured.

“Look, Steve. I’m sorry I stressed you out. Let’s forget we had this conversation.”

I disappeared around the corner. I could still hear him repeating:

“YournameisHarry. YournameisHarry. YournameisHarry.”

***

That night, I arrived at my apartment, exhausted. Flopped onto the couch. Opened my computer to catch up on work. 

All I could think about was Steve’s reaction. What the hell was wrong with him?

After finishing my work, I showered, got ready for bed, and turned on the TV to stream a movie. God knows how long I watched it before falling asleep.

Sometime later, I jerked awake to the sound of movement in the kitchen.

PFT-PFT-PFT. It resembled footsteps, shifting along the tile of my dining room. 

PFT-PFT-PFT. I glanced at the ceiling. Was it my upstairs neighbor? No.

I glanced at the clock: 2:30 am.  

PFT-PFT-PFT. The hell?

I grabbed the golf club near my bed, ventured to my doorway, sweating. 

The strange movements accelerated.

I wondered if it was a rat, searching for food.  

“Hello? Anyone in here?”

I flipped on my kitchen light in the hall.  

CLICK. The entire kitchen and dining area lit up.

I searched every corner of the apartment. Opened each drawer and cabinet, wondering: what was that? A mouse? A bat?

I didn’t find anything, so I shut off the lights. Went back to bed. But this time…

…I placed the golf club a little closer to my nightstand…

…and plugged in a nightlight for good measure… 

It was a few hours later when I awoke to more sounds in my bedroom.  

PFT-PFT-PFT. PFT-PFT-PFT.

I opened my eyes. A humanoid shape stood at the end of my bed. Breathing heavily.

“Hello?” I gasped, my voice tight with fear. Then — 

CREAK. The shape lowered itself onto the bed. 

I reached for my club. But a firm hand gripped my wrist.

Another slapped down over my mouth, silencing me. 

There was just enough glow from my nightlight to make out the intruder’s face —  

— it was Steve —

I'm flying in and out of Medellin. So far, I'm planning around 4 days for Medellin (day trip to Guatape or Santa Fe de Antioquia?), 3 days for Bogotá, 4 nights for Leticia to do an Amazon excursion and then 3-4 days for Armenia / coffee region. 

Basic things I'd want to do:

-Street art tour

-Check out a few art museums

-Take the cable cars

-Do a coffee tour

-visit Cocora valley

-watch a soccer game (if possible)

I'm primarily a city person who likes art and cultural attractions but I do like going into nature from time to time (hence, the Amazon excursion). I love coffee so definitely want to do a coffee tour at a farm. In general, I like checking out cool cafes, restaurants, sports games and do some shopping. 

Does this seem like a reasonable itinerary? Is there anything I'm missing? Any day trips I should take from any of the major cities? I'd plan on flying between the cities. 

Also I like to take photos with my Fujifilm DSLR but I heard Colombia isn't the safest of places to be carrying around expensive equipment. Should I leave the camera at home?

You can't just ask ""how much does a website cost?"" and get one answer.

The problem is, lots of people starting out get totally confused asking this question. They get quotes all over the place, from a few hundred bucks to literally tens of thousands. It feels random and unfair, and you have no idea what you should actually be paying.

The solution is realizing that website cost depends on *so many* things. Is it just a simple page about your business, or does it need a shopping cart, user logins, or fancy animations? How many pages do you need? Do you want a super unique custom design or is a tweaked template okay? Are you hiring a student or a top-tier agency? All this stuff changes the price big time.

So, instead of asking for *the* price, figure out what *your* website needs to do. Write down your goals, the features you want, and maybe list competitors' sites you like. Then you can explain this to designers when you ask for a quote.

If you do this, you'll get quotes that actually make sense for what you need. You can compare apples to apples and budget way more accurately without getting ripped off or underspending on something that won't work.

Now, you just need help figuring out what you need or finding the right designer. Comment FIVERR and I'll send you my simple guide on figuring out your website requirements so you know exactly what to ask for.

1l6tlx1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1l6tlx1/rough_weekend_on_a_group_trip/,Rough weekend on a group trip,"I had a really rough weekend and I think it would be helpful to share it...

My boyfriend extended an invitation this weekend for a camping trip. His best friend and his wife invited us, I've hing out with them a few times and they make an effort to socialize with me. I was excited. They were also going to take care of the food since it was their camp, I thought I didn't have to worry.

I was excited for the weekend. Every other time I've gone camping there is hiking, swimming, or other activities... I had a couple bags so that I had whatever I needed. I literally bought a new bathing suit and bag I was so excited.

As soon as we got there my stomach flipped, it wasn't just us. There was another couple there that I had met once before, they were older and welcoming but I wasn't prepared for it. Then I find out there is a 4th couple coming, never met them, and they are extremely close with the couple I knew.

As soon as they showed up I just shut down. I sunk into my chair and just laughed along, not that they made an effort to talk to me. It was hard with everyone sharing about their families (I only have my boyfriend), inside jokes, and these past/future group trips that I'm not a part of. They stayed up until 2am and it wasnt my camp so I felt too awkward to go into the shared camper alone. I was so pale and uncomfortable by the time we went to bed... and then find out we basically had no mattress. Plus I didnt realize no one else brought pjs but me and apparently it was expected to just sleep in your clothes. I only slept for 3 hours and couldn't get back to sleep, waiting 4 hours for my boyfriend to wake up so I wouldn't go out alone.

The first morning broke me. I lost my sunglasses and those are like a safety blanket for me, I felt exposed. Then I found out they didn't realize I drank tea and not coffee, so there was no caffeine for me either. And they weren't doing breakfast until noon while I was starving. I was actually fighting tears sitting out with everyone, so when my boyfriend wandered off to get some air I snuck back into my bunk and cried silently.

My boyfriend got me centered and convinced me to come back out. I think that is when people realized I wasn't having the best time. They put more effort into organizing breakfast, one of the husbands made an effort to chat with me a little... my boyfriend then took an opportunity to bring me into town for a tea and some shopping. While we were gone the couple we were sharing the camper with swapped out the padding on our bed so it would be more comfortable, so they must have been able to tell I hadn't slept since I didnt feel comfortable saying it.

I think the hardest part was a combination of spending the weekend with strangers, plus the fact the ones I did know were better friends with the others than with me. So why make an effort with me when their best friends are there? The wife I never met before didn't speak a word to me or even look at me, and neither did the othet wives when she was around.

When we got back he offered me his hammock to hide in and I hung out there until the other women decided to go to town. Oddly enough that was the only time I had fun... the guys joked around with me, I had a water gun fight with my boyfriend, and we actually got to have a quiet talk together.

It was easier to bite my lip for the rest of the day but at night he checked on me... it was hard for him to watch me all day looking either fed up or being on the verge of tears. These people had a different idea of fun, they just wanted to drink and talk all weekend.

But at least this morning I found my sunglasses so I didnt feel so exposed when I went outside. But then came the awkwardness of not knowing what to do when everyone was packing up, no one really told me when we were leaving but they all seemed to just know, I felt in the way. I had thought we'd be spending most of the day. Then of course almost everyone else ended up chatting in one of the campers while I was awkwardly waiting outside not knowing what was going on.

I never felt so relieved to leave and go home. But this weekend drained everything I had in me... on top of being drained I also feel physically sick from the lack of caffeine and inconsistent eating. 

At least it isn't a frequent thing but it makes me sad because my boyfriend often doesn't have much time, so when trips like this come up I worry I'll get excluded. I know he wouldn't do it to be mean but he wouldn't want to put me through this again... and he's leaving for a few months for work so it was really disappointing this is how our last weekend together went.

The silver lining is it made me more appreciativeof my boyfriend. I've been in the dumps because he didnt want me to come on a tropical trip he is taking later this year for a wedding. He originally wanted me to go but then decided against it, I took it personally. He had mentioned I'd only know a couple people there and he had a guys only portion. Now I realize that once he figured me out, he knew I'd have a miserable time just like I did this weekend... I'd be in a foreign country for a week and surrounded by people I don't know while he goes off with his friends.",2,1749435976.0,AutisticAdults,0,1.0,False

I drink one cup of coffee every morning for 10 years without fail. I get two shots of espresso in the morning. I rarely drink a second cup just to be aware of my caffeine intake.

Starting last year, I started to have more frequent headaches in the afternoon, especially around when I get home from work. I attributed it to long commute due to new job and my poor sleep. I improved my sleep but it only helped a little. 

Then it started to get annoying. My headaches become longer, and more obvious if I slept slightly not well the night before. I lacked energy to work, workout, do basic chores. I’m tired a lot, I just thought work was burning me out. 

2-3 months ago, a matcha drink place opened in my neighborhood. Bf and I occasionally got matcha in the morning on weekends due to the hype - I noticed less headaches on those days and got curious. I researched on this little powder and decided to give it a try.

I started with 2g of matcha every morning (equivalent to one shot of espresso) - I had some drowsiness in the first few days, but no headaches. Now I’m in week 4 of switching to matcha. I haven’t had a headache since and I’ve definitely had some late nighters.

I also noticed I had more “drive” for everyday tasks. Like getting my chores done instead of rotting on the couch with my phone. More energy to workout, better mood control, and also willpower (?) - I find that I’m less likely to reach for a sweet treat after a workday. 

Well, there you go! If you are experiencing something similar, maybe give this green powder a try! I’m not quitting coffee though as I love the taste of coffee. But my everyday staple now has been matcha and I’m loving the benefits.

After more than 25 years in the same global consulting firm—including the last 10 years in senior executive roles—I took the leap into the external job market. What followed was an eight-month journey of preparation, reflection, and connection that ultimately helped me grow both professionally and personally.

**Getting Started: Preparation Matters**

From the outset, I knew this process could take time—and that doing it well meant doing it deliberately. I worked with an Executive Career Coach (meeting weekly to fortnightly) and also found a job-hunting buddy. We caught up weekly for coffee—supporting and motivating each other throughout the journey.

I invested in building a strong foundation:

* Focused my **CV** on the last three roles over the past 10–15 years
* Crafted **role descriptions and achievement statements** that spoke to impact, not just responsibilities
* Created a compelling **one-pager** and updated my **LinkedIn profile**
* Tailored my CV for each application
* Prepared **AI-assisted cover letters** when appropriate
* Built a practical **job aid** and **interview preparation checklist**

I structured my week around focused job search time: **three 3-hour blocks (Tue–Wed–Thu, 9:30–12:30)**. This rhythm kept me disciplined, but also allowed space to stay well-rounded and grounded.

**Staying Balanced**

To stay mentally and physically fit, I kept up regular **exercise**, practiced **meditation** and even used **power poses** to boost confidence before key meetings. I also:

* Enrolled in **online training** (e.g. EdX)
* **Recorded a podcast** on a subject I’m passionate about
* **Attended networking events** every couple of weeks

To my surprise, I began to look forward to these events. Many conversations were less about job prospects and more about sharing career journeys. I met some truly interesting people and had rich, energising exchanges.

**Facing Challenges Head-On**

I was aware of **ageism** and the perceived drawbacks of being “too experienced” or having **25+ years at one company**. I took the time to work through the pros and cons, and found ways to proactively reframe my narrative. I also set up a **dedicated Gmail account** for job applications to keep things organised and professional.

**The Power of Networking**

While I applied to jobs through **LinkedIn, Seek, and Indeed**, I soon learned that around **80% of leads came through networking**—not ads.

I exported my LinkedIn contacts and reached out to roughly **150–200 people** from my 2,000-strong network. I kept my outreach **authentic and genuine**, looking for **mutual benefit**, not transactional exchanges. And I was genuinely moved by the encouragement I received—often from the people I least expected.

**Interviews: A Two-Way Street**

When interview opportunities came up, I treated each as a **two-way conversation**—not just an evaluation of me, but also of the role and the organisation. I:

* Researched the company and interviewer(s)
* Crafted a **compelling elevator pitch**, focused on **pulling forces** (why I was drawn to the role)
* Used the **STAR method** to prepare for behavioural questions
* Developed and tailored **10 insightful questions** to ask
* Took **notes** after each interview, **debriefed**, and reflected on what I’d learned

I followed a structured rhythm post-interview:

* Sent a **thank-you note within 24 hours**
* Followed up **a week later**
* If ghosted, followed up **no more than three times**

Each interview, regardless of outcome, was an opportunity to improve. My confidence and clarity grew with each experience.

**Final Reflections**

This journey took time—and required patience, resilience, and self-belief. Nevertheless, I tried to stay positive, committed to continuous improvement, and trusted that I would eventually get there. Every connection, every interview, every rejection—even silence—helped me become sharper, more focused, and better prepared.

I recognise not everyone has the financial flexibility to dedicate several months to a job search. I was fortunate in that regard. **What helped me most was treating the process like a professional project: structured, supported, and purposeful. It gave me focus, kept me grounded, and eventually turned uncertainty into opportunity.**

PS: I gained a lot from reading others' posts in this forum, so I wanted to give back by sharing my own experience.

PS2: And in case you're wondering—yes, I used an AI tool to help polish the formatting and structure of this post.",1,1749435860.0,recruitinghell,2,1.0,False

The date was short (25 minutes) and not at all what I expected. Our date was set up by a friend at a coffee shop downtown. I was so excited that I arrived 10 minutes early to reserve a table away from the door so it wouldn't get too cold every time someone walked in. Twenty minutes went by (10 minutes late for the date). I texted the friend who set up the date, since I didn't have her phone number yet, to ask if she had just gotten lost. Instead, I received a text from the friend saying she had woken up late and wouldn't be there until 10:00 (it was 9:40). I was told 9:30. She arrived at 10:05, sat down, and said, ""OK, I'm here."" Our conversation revolved around her, and when I did talk, I tried to tell her about my hobbies and about myself. She wasn't interested and wanted to keep talking about herself. The date continued like this until she received a text and got up.🤦🏻‍♀️ I didn't bother asking her. I just wished her a good day and opened the door. Her last comment was, ""Damn, you're tall, maybe too tall.” 🫤 I felt like the hour I spent before the date hyping myself in the mirror before the date was wasted, and I didn't even have time to talk in detail about my hobbies like working on cars and motorcycles, watching old cartoons or video games, reading historical books, working out, or dancing. Moral of the story is I’m not gonna put 110% in unless someone is trying.  Side Note if anyone reading this wants to hangout online I do play on Psn. Dm me Psn Username and we can chill.

I’m a 35-year-old Korean female looking for a native English speaker to do a language exchange with. Ideally, someone in a similar age range and committed to regular practice.

A bit about me:
I work as a Korean-English interpreter, so I’d say my English is fairly advanced. But I’d like to brush up on my speaking skills and set aside a regular time each week for natural, casual English conversations.
I’m happy to help you with your Korean in return—grammar, pronunciation, speaking practice, anything really.
Your Korean level doesn’t matter :)

We can do video chats, voice calls, or text—whatever works best for both of us.
And if you live in Seoul or Sejong, I’d be happy to meet up for coffee and a chat in person!

If this sounds like a good fit, feel free to reach out.

Thanks!

1l6tgp3,https://www.reddit.com/r/obeyme/comments/1l6tgp3/og_finally_finished_strategies_for_sanity_and/,[OG] Finally finished. Strategies for sanity and thoughts,"The first half of this post are my personal non-spoiler strategies for balancing motivation, frustration, and money. No combat or card tips discussed here. There's plenty of that already out there. The second half will be discussion and contain spoilers. I'll let you know when I switch.

  
I started Obey Me 10/19/2024. I realized around lesson 12 that I was in this for the long haul and thus willing to spend money. I bought VIP 11/4 and finished lesson 20 on 11/6. I just took a while to work up the will to sign up for a subscription as this was my first gacha game I'd ever played. It was also around lesson 12 that I started dabbling in online spaces and learned this has the difficulty curve born from hell (heh). Also fuck me and my ability to get hooked on a game RIGHT as they announce the end of support. Still, I persevered anyway after some reflection.

  
I considered using Nightbringer to just read the story, but I decided against it. The slow build of gacha forced the story into bite-sized chunks that did not overwhelm me. I knew that if I tried reading it in Nightbringer, I just wouldn't finish it. It wouldn't be a story anymore. It would be a TASK and executive dysfunction does not permit.

  
I started VIP, used most perks as I willed, but refused to touch the glow sticks. I did not allow myself to touch those until Lesson 40. I know myself well enough that when I hit a ""point of no return"" at the end of a story, I just don't stop. I also knew the difficulty curve started at Lesson 76, and that would piss me right off. So I stockpiled them.

  
Until Lesson 40, I didn't really have structure. I just did what I wanted to and seemed relatively efficient. At Lesson 40, climbing became hard. I incorporated Lonely Devil at this point. I would run an LD from my work lunch break Monday to lunch break Friday. This allowed me to fill up gaps in my cards, collect experience, and satisfied the itch for a story. On weekends, I would play 1-3 lessons. Most cards were at level 100 by this point.

  
Lesson 60 is where I had strict structure. LDs during weekdays. 1-2 lessons on the weekends. I no longer did 3 star battles before moving on. Instead, I would tally the colors/sins of the battles I couldnt 3 star. I would then use the highest score to decide what cards to upgrade above 100. (For example: Think 5 battles were 2 star, 3 of which had the primary sin of pride. I would then spend my experience over the next week investing in a pride card). The next weekend, I would go back and fix any battles that were not 3 star (completionism is my sin). If I only got 2 stars, I would use 2 normal light sticks. If I only got 1 star, I would use 1 rainbow light stick. This consistently allowed me to get 3 stars.

  
I hit Lesson 72 Friday. Yesterday, I hit Lesson 74, and I knew it was time. I was in avalanche mode, and I was going to finish the game this weekend come hell or high water. I started with 110 rainbow sticks and 20 something regular sticks for each color/sin when light stick restrictions came off. By lesson 77, I defaulted to starting every single combat with a rainbow light stick. Sometimes I still had to go back and add additional regular light sticks. By the time I finished, all regular light sticks were in the teens. I finished with 35 rainbow light sticks. Hard mode was at Lesson 35 upon finishing.

  
The only money I spent outside of VIP was spent trying to get Simeon's Princely Struggle card. I failed, btw. 

  
Shortly after starting VIP in OG, I started VIP in Nightbringer. I have been exclusively leveling those cards the ENTIRE TIME I've been playing OG. I have a lvl 200 card there, 2 lvl 130 cards, and 3 lvl 100 cards. That is my starting point for Nightbringer now.

  
Here is my final load out:

Pride - Barbatos UR Hot Spring Surprised, Skill level 1, lvl 120

Pride - Diavolo UR It's Lonely Being Me, Skill level 2, lvl 100

Greed - Satan UR+ Our Story's Ending, Skill level 1, lvl 110

Greed - Barbatos UR A Butler's Private Lesson, Skill level 2, lvl 100

Envy - Diavolo UR Christmas Memories, Skill level 1, lvl 100

Envy - Solomon UR Solomon's True Goal, Skill level 1, lvl 100

Wrath - Asmo UR+ Snow Bliss, Skill level 1, lvl 100

(I know I shouldn't have used this card. I did anyway. I do not recommend to others. It's too slow)

Wrath - Simeon UR Nectar of the Gods, Skill level 2, lvl 100

Lust - Lucifer UR Here's to Us, Forever, Skill level 2, lvl 113

Lust - Solomon UR Trunk of Memories, Skill level 1, lvl 100

Gluttony - Diavolo UR Birthday Stayover, Skill level 1, lvl 140

Gluttony - Simeon UR My One & Only Sweet Bear, Skill level 1, lvl 100

(Same problem as the Asmo Wrath card. Too slow. Do not recommend.)

Sloth - Mammon UR+ Staying Home Together - Skill level 1, lvl 129

Sloth - Beel UR+ Something Worth Saving, Skill level 1, lvl 100

Sloth - Barbatos UR Snow Globe Sentiments, Skill level 1, lvl 100

(3 sloth cards was a test to see if more of the same card was more important or if levels were. I sided with levels being more important. Thus way sloth is the only sin with 3 character cards)

Greed - Memory UR Christmas Prank Kinds, Skill level 4, lvl 100

Greed - Memory UR Horror Night, Skill level 2, lvl 51

\*\*\*\*\*Moving on to spoilers below\*\*\*\*\*



Character ranking

1. Simeon (Perfect mix of sweet and mischevious. God I love him)

2. Solomon (He grew on me. Became a mix of sweet and low self-esteem, and I love torturing my darlings)

3. Barbatos (I have no explanation for why he is so high. Bastard cleaned house of my preferences and refused to leave)

4. Diavolo (Golden retriever energy. I would have liked just a bit more character development out of him)

5. Lucifer (Enjoyable, good character development, too coded for booktok dark boyfriend to be higher)

6. Luke (Contraversial, but his sweet and cute moments were a breath of relief from unrelenting romance. Have I mentioned I'm asexual?)

7. Satan (Loved him. Wanted more personality from him)

8. Beel (So much wasted potential here. Could've been great but refused to leave nomnomnom town. Also, his ""thank you"" when you give him a glowstick is the cutest soundbite in the entire damn game)

9. Mammon (sweet guy. I'm just a mental health counselor for a living, and he is too much like my clients. As much as I love every one of my clients, this game was supposed to help me escape work)

10. Leviathan (exact same problem as Mammon)

11. Belphegor (He's okay. He just didn't hold my attention)

12. Asmo (Same. Okay, didn't hold attention, sometimes annoyed me with the narcissism)

I don't feel like I know the other 3 characters well enough to rate them with the others. So they get their own.

1. Mephisto (solid foundation for a compelling character here)

2. Raphael (I'm a sucker for the angels, and he's got a few intriguing elements)

3. Thirteen (Just not well rounded enough yet)

  
If I love the characters enough, I will put up with a lot of bad game play and bad story telling. That is where this game falls. The story got kind of campy and was predictable 90% of the time. That being said, the only season I really struggled with was 3. I just did not care for the sorcerer exam arc. Kind of cringy. However, I know it was necessary. Lesson 40 is when they started setting the stage for the end of the game, and the MC had to have the ability to freely travel between realms in order for the story to have the happy ending the devs were aiming for.

Teasing Simeon lore for 40 GOD DAMN Lessons though. Fuck OFF with that.

Hard mode Lesson... 31? I think? Really gave this game a lot of depth for me. That little spat between Simeon and Diavolo was VERY Japanese and American coded. Just say what you mean, be direct, be honest, that's all very American. Be polite at all costs, navigate social dynamics carefully, do your best to not be insulting, is very Japanese coded. It got me thinking on themes and lessons in the overarching story that intrigue me. I don't have conclusions yet, but it's good food for thought. (I also don't think they were truly arguing here. This struck me as a culture clash with Diavolo showing how young/immature he can be. He is the Young Lord after all). 

Now? I focus on collecting outfits in OG. I'm also going to start doing more LDs and FINALLY start reading Devilgram (I have 877 story keys). If you have any recommendations for either, please feel free to send them my way. Especially if they involve my top 5. Please? 

Any thoughts, questions, reflections?

I'm just going to continue working on my hand made Simeon hoodie in the meantime. Pictures of that will find its way to this subreddit eventually.",1,1749435529.0,obeyme,0,1.0,False

Diagnose your digital nomad income potential in under 90 seconds—[try the free tool now](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/).*

**Prologue: The Digital Nomad Invasion**

Portugal. Land of sun, surf, and… startup visas. The digital nomad wave has crashed onto its shores, bringing with it a whirlwind of change. But is this influx a renaissance or a reckoning? Let’s peel back the postcard-perfect façade and see what’s really happening when keyboards replace cork trees as the local export.

**The Appeal of Portugal: Why Nomads Flock Here**

Portugal isn’t just a destination; it’s a siren song for remote workers. Golden visas, affordable living, and a laissez-faire attitude toward bureaucracy make it a magnet for the laptop class. The promise of tax breaks and a thriving expat community lures nomads like moths to a flame.

**Local Economies: Boon or Burden?**

Cash injections or cash grabs? Nomads pour euros into local economies, but the ripple effect isn’t always smooth. Some businesses thrive; others struggle to adapt. The question isn’t just about money—it’s about who gets to spend it.

**Rent Rage: How Nomads Shift the Housing Market**

Gentrification isn’t a dirty word—until it’s your rent doubling. Digital nomads, armed with remote salaries, outbid locals for apartments. Landlords swap long-term tenants for short-term gains. The result? A housing crisis masquerading as a boom.

*🌍 Wondering if your skills stack up? Find out your digital nomad income potential in under 90 seconds—[click here to start](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/).*

**Café Culture Clash: Remote Workers vs. Local Patrons**

Picture this: a Lisbon café, once the domain of poets and pensioners, now overrun by MacBooks and oat milk lattes. The vibe shifts. The locals feel edged out. The nomads? They’re just looking for reliable Wi-Fi and a flat white.

**Digital Nomad Hubs: Lisbon, Porto, and Beyond**

Lisbon and Porto are ground zero. But the nomad footprint spreads—Braga, Faro, even sleepy coastal towns now host remote workers. These cities morph into hybrid spaces, where pastel de nata meets pitch decks.

**Tourism vs. Nomadism: What’s the Real Impact?**

Tourists come and go. Nomads stay—for months, sometimes years. The distinction matters. Tourism spikes seasonally; nomadism is a slow burn, reshaping neighborhoods, economies, and social fabrics in its wake.

*💡 Ready to see if you can hack it? Diagnose your digital nomad income potential in under 90 seconds—[try the tool now](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/).*

**The Portuguese Perspective: Voices from the Ground**

Listen closely. The locals aren’t monolithic. Some welcome the change, others lament the loss of their city’s soul. The tension is palpable, simmering beneath the surface of every “bom dia.”

**The Airbnb Effect: Short-Term Rentals and Community**

Airbnb giveth, and Airbnb taketh away. Short-term rentals skyrocket, pushing locals to the outskirts. The sense of community frays as apartments become revolving doors for transient tenants.

**Cultural Erosion: Are Traditions at Risk?**

Fado nights now compete with networking events. Traditional shops shutter, replaced by coworking spaces and vegan bistros. The question lingers: is Portugal losing its identity, or simply evolving?

**Economic Influx: Where Does the Money Go?**

Money flows in, but where does it pool? Landlords, restaurateurs, and coworking spaces cash in. The average Portuguese worker? They’re still waiting for the tide to lift all boats.

*🔥 Want to know if you’re cut out for this? Diagnose your digital nomad income potential in under 90 seconds—[take the test](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/).*

**Nomad Infrastructure: Coworking Spaces and Cafés**

Coworking spaces sprout like mushrooms after rain. Cafés retrofit for power outlets and strong coffee. The infrastructure adapts, but at what cost to authenticity?

**Language Barriers: English Dominance in Local Life**

English becomes the lingua franca. Portuguese fades into the background in certain circles. The cultural exchange is real—but so is the risk of linguistic homogenization.

**Sustainability Concerns: Overcrowding and Resources**

More people, more problems. Water, waste, and Wi-Fi strain under the pressure. Sustainability isn’t just a buzzword—it’s a necessity if Portugal wants to keep its charm intact.

**Government Response: Policies for or Against Nomads**

The government walks a tightrope. Attract nomads, but don’t alienate locals. Tax incentives, visa programs, and housing regulations attempt to strike a balance—but cracks are showing.

*⚡ Can you make it as a nomad? Diagnose your digital nomad income potential in under 90 seconds—[find out now](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/).*

**Nomad Ethics: Responsibility and Respect**

With great freedom comes great responsibility. Nomads must ask: are we guests or invaders? Respect for local culture, fair wages, and sustainable practices can make all the difference.

**Success Stories: Nomads and Locals Thriving Together**

Not all tales are cautionary. Some nomads invest in local businesses, mentor entrepreneurs, and bridge cultural divides. These stories prove that coexistence is possible—with effort.

**Failed Utopias: When Nomadism Goes Wrong**

For every success, there’s a cautionary tale. Overcrowding, resentment, and exploitation can turn paradise into a pressure cooker. The lesson? Nomadism isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution.

**The Future of Portugal: A Nomadic Nation?**

Will Portugal become a nomad nation, or will it push back? The answer lies in policy, community, and the choices of both nomads and locals. The future is unwritten—but the stakes are high.

**Conclusion: Coexistence or Collision?**

Portugal stands at a crossroads. Will digital nomads be the catalyst for renewal or the cause of collapse? The answer isn’t black and white—it’s a spectrum of possibilities, shaped by empathy, policy, and pragmatism.

**Epilogue: Lessons for the Next Nomad Destination**

Portugal’s story is a blueprint—or a warning. As nomads seek new frontiers, the lessons learned here will echo. The key? Balance, respect, and a willingness to adapt.

I started with a party of 4. 

The burger chef died out back on a smoke break and Burglar, who stayed in the car and planned to hot wire it and leave the rest there, saw a blue glow from behind the café when the cook died. He honked the horn and the party ignored him. Meanwhile Waitress, who dabbled in the occult, kept seeing deaths heads in coffee stains and foamy bubbles and shit.

Sam went out to check on the cook bc the food order was taking forever. He also was consumed by the dead light and Burglar saw a second glow of light. The party car was stuck so he tried to steal Jake Burns' car. Jake saw him and came out and decked him, then Burglar shot his head off with a sawed off shotgun. 

War Veteran saw him and tried to go contain the situation. There was a standoff outside, dead light screamed past overhead and Veteran got a flash of ptsd and went back inside. Then Burglar heard a scream as Mary went out back to check on Sam, thought shit was going down, and tried to snipe Teddy through the café window for... reasons? Veteran dove through the glass to try and stop him but Burglar got away.

Meanwhile, Barkeep is just trying to solve the puzzle so they can gtfo but Emilia is still unconscious and Jake is dead so there's limited information. Occult Waitress realizes that the dead light might be similar to a will o wisp then sails off to look for omens in the salt.

Dead light gets in through the hole in the glass and tries to mesmerize everyone before finally consuming Mary, at which point it expended so much energy that all the glass in the café shattered and they were in the dark.

Burglar meanwhile holed up in the empty gas station office. The rest tried to steal Sam's car from the car park to escape but he'd ridden a bike to work so Waitress took the bike but only got as far as the gas station office before Burglar pulled her inside. Veteran and Barkeep took Emilias car and drove to the cabin. Waitress and Burglar tried to hide from the dead light in the car Park but it burned through the door and consumed them.

Veteran and Barkeep encountered a temporarily insane Billy Esterhouse in the woods, knocked him out, and eventually used him as bait to contain the dead light. Then Barkeep took the dead lights box and kept it for themselves. 

Changed dead light from sin eater to pain eater and instead of abortions, it performed voluntary euthanasia on the elderly and WWI veterans.",0,1749435512.0,callofcthulhu,0,0.5,False

I’ve recently started a high profile job that I’m amazing at BUT I’m finding I need a crutch to function. I quietly carry an anxiety disorder and C-PTSD. 

Usually, I’d have a bit of Valium every now and again to get me through public speaking and taxing periods, personally or professionally. So long as I got sleep, laid off any alcohol and worked-out my anxiety would stay at bay and I could sleep deeply. 

Due to the long hours and demands from this role, I’m finding myself reaching for the Valium most days (2.5-5mg so a very low dose). 

I need something more long term as I’m scared of my receptors becoming addicted to Valium. 

ChatGPT recommended Buspar during the day and Agomelotine for night. Has anyone tried this combination? 

I need my brain switched on for work and the fact that I can have a coffee with Valium in the morning and feel totally normal, unaffected (emotionally) and super productive is why ChatGPT recommended I try this combination.

ChatGPT has taken the limelight for the past couple of years, with every tech and app developer adding open-source AI capability to cash in on the early adopters.

Google seemed to be holding back for the mass market, squirreling away working holistically through each and every touchpoint in the Google Suite. I assume to ensure a fully integrated, intuitive, and seamless connection across all parts - held together by their new baby: Gemini. From data analytics to file management in Google Drive; Google Ads and Analytics, and new creative tools that look like strong competition for all the other AI creative tools on the market.

And nothing like a big move from Google to get all the other platforms scurrying to release updates and improvements. We love it! Healthy competition at its best.

# So What Happened?

Google hosted multiple events in California over the past couple of weeks allowing each area of Google to present what they have been working on to their relevant users; with many of these new technologies launching that same day in the US.

**In a nutshell, these advancements aim to elevate user engagement - both customer and marketing - and boost advertising effectiveness by providing more AI creative tools and importantly, real-time customer insights to improve on ROAS.**

Key topics of discussion included the evolution of search behaviours, a shift towards a more intuitive purchasing journey, and methods for businesses to leverage Google’s technologies for stronger customer connections and engagement.

APAC may need to wait a little longer, but here's summary what's to come from the latest [Google Marketing Live 2025](https://www.youtube.com/live/Aem4LcsFNE0?si=Ng_Hdd4sNZI-2wB4) and the [Google IO 2025 Event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVpI23q8Zg).

# A Quick Snapshot of the Onlinescape

* 83% of people globally use Google or YouTube Daily
* There are 5 Trillion Searches globally a day on Google
* Gen Z are the heaviest users of Google Search
* AI Overviews - the new 'baby' in Search - is already a crowd pleaser with **1.5 billion users** using it currently (it's still rolling out) and greatly increased satisfaction and results.
* Only about 40% of Searches will give you an AI Overview, but this number is growing.

# YouTube

Did you know the first ""unboxing video"" was shown on YouTube in 2006? For many it seems that somehow TikTok took over the world of video content and creators, however, first there was YouTube. With content creators on YouTube having since amassed millions of followers and have created - Mr Beast - empires and franchises around their name. TikTok simply enabled anyone to get views, whilst YouTube still prioritises threshold metrics to unlock features to monetise your channel.

* YouTube still has the most streaming shows of any network
* Globally - 1 Billion hours of YouTube videos are consumed every day
* 45% of Shorts shown on YouTube are not available on TikTok
* 65% of Shorts shown on YouTube are not on Reels
* It's the only main social media channel that takes content onto TV screens
* The content is more accessibly shoppable than other social media channels
* These connected ads are visible on TV screens, not just mobile
* The A-List celebs are here
* YouTube is still the most trusted social media channel
* YouTube drove 1 billion conversions through ads in the P12m

This integration of paid and organic views combined - ie: ads are not run separately to your organic content like on Meta and YouTube - turns YouTube into an essential marketing channel for businesses.

# Big Question - What's Next for Google Ads?

With AI Overviews and ChatGPT we know that standard ""SEO"" practices and the original Search Ads have been under scrutiny. Over the past couple of years Google have been moving away from old ad formats such as Smart Ads, Display Ads and Shopping Ads across into PMAX (PerformanceMax), and DemandGen Ad formats, integrating YouTube and more visual communications into these campaigns, along with serving their ads across multi-format platforms. The concept of organic SEO seems to have been replaced by [""Search Everywhere Optimisation""](/post/seo-and-ai-search). Making sure you show up in multi-media formats across multiple channels.

So Google's take on ""The future of Search"" was something I was most interested to hear about this year.

# The Evolution of Google Search

Search is the foundation of most advertising strategies. It's the natural starting point for most consumers in-market for something. Search now covers all parts of the marketing funnel given its ability to get really granular in answering some very specific questions - such as *""do I need to buy shoes for my baby"".*

1. It started simply with **Keywords** \- whatever you typed into Search: ie: Baby Shoes, Google picked up results based on one keyword at a time: ie: Baby and Shoes - serving you a series of Baby related sites, and Shoe related sites, some of which *may* have contained ""Baby Shoes"".
2. This evolved into more complex search sentences - such as *""do I need to buy shoes for my baby""* (the short answer I can give you right now is ""no!"" - *silliest invention ever)*. This long-tail search has been evolving steadily over the past 5 years and now even includes some real opinions, videos, blog posts and forum comments - from real mums!
3. From there we had Sound searches - initially 'owned' by Soundhound, and then Shazam took the lions share, however, neither could identify the songs I sang to them - until Google came along.
4. Our most recent search has been Google Image Searches - not just the typed in kind, but the kind that enabled you to take a photo of anything and find its original, or look-a-like for sale online. Although it couldn't help me find the source of this bottle top I found washed up on Long Bay Beach after a recent storm event.The mystery soft drink brand Shrink?

# Google Search 3.0 - Next-Gen

1. Circle to Search - this one is already live, but you have to try hard to find it. And it mostly works like Google Image would have, only this time you simply ""circle"" what you want to search with your finger. Somewhat annoyingly is that you first need to click the ""Google image search"" icon in the browser address bar - once the gesture is made, Google will search for it offering you a wide collection of look-a-like items and where to buy them.

1. AI Mode **Search - an extension of Voice Search** \- now live in the USA and coming soon with the Gemini 2.5 updates - so instead of showing you links on the subject - *while you are driving (so useless)* \- it will be able to read out the AI Overview answer.
2. Deep Search - among others - are extensions you may need to pay for to enable going deeper into topics and adding more data and visuals to the findings. Once linked with Gemini and Google Docs, you will be able to include your own documents in the process to ensure a relevant and customised outcome.
3. **Project Astra** \- where you can talk back and forth with AI - ie: based on locations services and your use of Google Maps, the team demonstrated how you could ask AI ""what was the name of that coffee shop we went to this morning?"" and ""what Google Review rating does it have"" and ""could you share that location with Bob in my phone book"".
4. **Project Mariner** \- your personal assistant and agent, who could book appointments, tickets and other activities for you.

Many of these may rings bells. They are not new concepts. Some have been presented years back, but never quite came to life. Others the stuff of movies. But is seems they are all coming to a cellphone near you in the next few months. Made possible by the escalated and disruptive releases from OpenAI, and the subsequent work done by many, to train AI using LLMs (Large Language Modules) to respond in authentic and accurate ways.

# Google - Try it On!

Way back in 2008 at Euroshop, a Retail Trade Show held annually in Germany, I was able to experience some of the early ""virtual try-on"" apps. They were good. It was all very exciting, but they took a very long time to materialise into something affordable, practical and available to everyone.

Google have finally done it - and from the demonstration it looks pretty good. However, I do wonder if it could decrease some impulse buys if you're the hot bodied, natural mannequin, size 8? Bad for the retailer, but good for my pocket. Perhaps my wardrobe won't be bulging with online purchases I don't *really love* and couldn't be bothered to return.

Google's Virtual Change Room. Best we all get our full bodied selfies right (the face was hard enough!).

The Google presenter pictured in action bottom left demonstrated the tool using the blue dress she found online.

Once you have ""tried it on"", you can ether buy it using the ""buy for me"" option and Google will integrate all its other tools (Google Pay and your saved delivery addresses) to make this purchase as seamless as possible. Or you can opt-in track the price. Once the item goes on promotion or sale, you will get a notification and can, once again, seamlessly make the purchase. I imagine logging into sites with your Google profile will quickly become the go-to option to capitalise on this ease of functionality.

Practically, these images people will be using to ""try-on"" will become a critical focus area for many. Google seem to be planning to work this through their revamped Asset Studio tool will integrate the feed from eg: Shopify, across to Google Shopping via Google Merchant, to enable this functionality.

# What about Google Ads? Prospecting in the AI Era

With AI determining which ads to serve and when, traditional funnel management faces new challenges. While AI can enhance efficiency, it requires continuous education and input to meet marketing goals effectively.

Google have whittled dow the vast portfolio of Google Ads into 3 Buckets:

1. **PMAX** \- a visual integration of brand assets served across multiple channels.
2. **AI MAX for Search** \- more about this below
3. **Demand Gen** \- a better integration of video across YouTube to drive conversions.

# AI MAX for Search Campaigns

So firstly it's safe to say that Search on Google is not going away as a marketing tool. It remains an effective way to capture in-market audiences based on their ""searches"" - as simple as that. What's new is now not that new - the results they receive could include:

* AI Overviews
* Links to Websites
* Videos
* Podcasts
* Spotify
* Forums

The introduction of ""keywordless"" search campaigns marks a significant shift; leveraging natural language and conversational AI will be crucial for future marketing efforts.

# What About Analytics? Introducing Meridian

The much-anticipated **Marketing Mix Measurement tool, Meridian**, offers insights into attribution solutions and incrementality experiments, placing a strong emphasis on data-driven decision-making.

Only 44% of eligible users are using the current tools:

* Marketing Mix Modelling
* Attribution Solutions
* Incrementality Experiments

The new tools to be available soon remain the domain of advertisers with ""budgets as low as $5000"" they tell us.

# The New Marketing Advisor - of Your New Google ""Guy""

If you have ever had a call with a ""tag-technician"" or ""Google Advisor"" it is somewhat sad to know that many of these opportunities Google created for jobs for people out in the ""middle of nowhere"" may be drying up soon.

LLMs are busy teaching AI Agents to check Google Tags, install tags and give you a view on why your conversions may not be firing, or what you could do to improve your campaign effectiveness.

# What about Google AI for Creative?

I am not even going to touch on the ""coding"" upgrades for ""those guys"" but certainly there are a number of creative options coming your way, some of which will need to be paid for.

So far it's been bad - models with 3 arms and breasts on their backs. AI creatives have been touch and go.[ Sometimes surprising, often ridiculous!](http://go.In)

Google Product Studio to be Replaced with Many Upgrades. Below are some examples of trying to use this tool with diamond rings and pre-selected backgrounds available in their templates.

Using the above templates, we tried to place our ring into a stone pedestal setting.

Sad results. I will not terrify you with versions where we tried to add the rings to hands - which looked more like roast chickens! So we are still holding out here.

While Google’s AI-generated content has faced criticism, advancements in generative AI, such as the introduction of ""Asset Studio,"" show promise. Integrated into Google Merchant, this tool allows users to manage product images and videos more effectively.

# Gemini - AI Pro & AI Ultra

There were too many creative tools to go into, but they include all the things you dreamed of including:

* Voice overs and voice creation
* Images created from not just prompts, but look-a-like visuals.
* Text overlays added with creative input to align the text and font with the creative
* The ability to add characters, scenes and props as you go along
* The ability to educate it and maintain more consistency from one frame to the next - ie: the first chicken you used stays the same throughout the creative.

Below is a frame by frame view of a video that was created using a few prompts along with a basic image of a chicken and an ""old man"".

Created with AI using written prompts, uploaded visual references such as the car, chicken and old man driverThe AI enabled him to crop, edit and extend scenes as you would in any video editor.

# But Wait! There's More

Gemini seems to be the AI beast holding it altogether, with a number of partnerships being working on to bring these features to life across your extended devices:

* Your Car dashboard through partnerships with Volvo
* Your TV through partnerships with Samsung
* Your sunglasses, and your reading glasses - using Android XR and Samsung - with the ultimate goal of ""reducing the need to reach for your phone"" while you go about your day

The evolution of Google’s AI capabilities with Gemini will play a pivotal role in the future of marketing enabling you to reach audiences beyond their cellphones, laptops and desktops.

# Final Thoughts

As Google continues to innovate and adapt in the realms of AI and digital marketing, staying informed and leveraging these tools will be crucial for businesses seeking to enhance their marketing strategies. The landscape is evolving rapidly, and those who embrace these changes stand to gain a significant competitive advantage.

1l6t3cn,https://youtu.be/YOgcldN_CZc,3 Very Scary TRUE Off-Grid Cabin Living Horror Stories,"# ""Silka Was Here"":

I’d been coming to the Manley Hot Springs boat landing my whole life. It was our place, where the Tanana River carved through the Alaskan wilderness, wide and restless, like it was alive. Manley Hot Springs, our little village of maybe 80 people, was as off-grid as it gets—no police, no hospital, just a general store, a post office, and us, looking out for each other. We were 160 miles from Fairbanks, at the end of the Elliott Highway, where the road just stops and the wild takes over. That day, May 17, 1984, I was supposed to meet my friend Fred at the landing. He’d been talking all week about a fishing trip, maybe hauling some supplies upriver to his homestead. Fred was always planning something, his big laugh filling the store when he’d tell me about his latest idea. But my truck had other plans. The engine kept stalling, coughing like it was choking on dust. I spent an hour under the hood, cursing the spark plugs, and by the time I got it running, I was way late.The landing was dead quiet when I pulled up. That wasn’t right. Usually, you’d hear boats clunking against the dock, folks swapping stories, or kids like Marshall Klein giggling as they tossed rocks into the water. Joyce and Lymen, Marshall’s parents, were always there with him, teaching him how to tie knots or skip stones. But today, there was nothing—just the river’s low hum and the crunch of gravel under my boots as I stepped out. I scanned for Fred’s boat, a beat-up blue thing with chipped paint he called “the old girl.” It was gone. My eyes caught something else, though, something that made my gut lurch: a smear of red on the wooden dock, bright and wet, like spilled paint but thicker, stickier. I froze, my breath catching. Nearby, a couple of brass cartridge casings glinted in the dirt, and a tackle box lay tipped over, hooks and lures scattered like someone had bolted mid-task. A fishing rod leaned against a post, its line tangled in the bushes.“Fred?” I called, my voice sounding thin, swallowed by the river’s murmur. No answer. I stepped closer, my boots heavy, like my legs didn’t want to move. The blood trailed toward the water’s edge, smudged in places, like something—or someone—had been dragged. My heart was pounding now, a dull thump in my ears. I crouched, my fingers hovering over the stain, close enough to smell the sharp, coppery tang. That’s when I saw it, half-hidden in the bushes: a tiny blue shoe with a Velcro strap, scuffed from play. Marshall’s shoe. I knew it because I’d seen him running around in those shoes just yesterday, chasing his mom’s laughter at the store. Joyce, four months pregnant, had been glowing, talking about names for the new baby. Lymen had been there too, ruffling Marshall’s hair, proud as anything.I stood, my knees shaky, and looked out at the river. Far off, maybe a quarter-mile, a boat was slicing through the current, moving fast. It looked like Fred’s, but the guy in it wasn’t Fred. He was tall, lean, with a dark jacket and a scruffy beard. I recognized him—the drifter who’d shown up a few days ago. I’d seen him at Mary’s store, buying canned beans, matches, and a box of rifle ammo. He’d kept his head down, his eyes sharp and cold when they met mine for a second. He’d nodded, said nothing, and paid in crumpled bills. Now he was in Fred’s boat, alone, leaning into the throttle like he was running from something—or someone.My hands were trembling as I backed toward my truck. I needed to tell someone, anyone. The store was closest, a mile down the road, where Mary kept the only radio that could reach Fairbanks. I drove too fast, the truck rattling over potholes, my mind racing. Was Fred hurt? Was that Joyce’s blood, or Lymen’s? What about Marshall? And the others—Albert Hagen Jr., who’d just moved back after years away, or Joe McVey, the Vietnam vet with the limp who trapped upriver? Dale, the carpenter, had been talking about fixing the dock. They’d all been at the landing today, hadn’t they? The thought made my throat tight.I burst into the store, the bell above the door jangling wildly. Mary looked up from her ledger, her glasses slipping down her nose. She was in her 50s, tough as nails, the kind who’d seen everything and didn’t scare easy.“You okay?” she asked, squinting. “You’re white as a sheet.”“Something’s wrong at the landing,” I said, my voice cracking. I leaned on the counter, trying to steady myself. “There’s blood, Mary. A lot of it, on the dock. Cartridge casings, a tackle box knocked over. Marshall’s shoe was in the bushes. Fred’s boat’s gone, and I saw that drifter guy in it, out on the river.”Her face went still, her pen frozen over the ledger. “Blood? You sure it’s not… fish or something?”“It’s not fish,” I snapped, then caught myself. “It’s human, Mary. And Marshall’s shoe—Joyce and Lymen wouldn’t leave it there. Something bad happened.”She nodded, slow, like she was piecing it together. “Alright. Stay here.” She moved to the back, where the radio sat on a cluttered shelf. Her voice was calm but tight as she keyed the mic. “This is Manley Hot Springs, calling Fairbanks dispatch. We got a problem at the boat landing. Blood, signs of a struggle, possible missing persons. Send troopers, soon as you can.”The wait was torture. I paced the store, my boots scuffing the worn floorboards. Mary poured me coffee, but I couldn’t drink it. I kept seeing that blood, the scattered lures, Marshall’s shoe. I thought about Fred, how he’d invited me to his place last week, showing off his new traps, joking about his bad luck with fish. Joyce had been at the store, buying yarn to knit booties for the baby. Lymen had teased her about making them too small. Albert, quiet but friendly, had been helping Dale with the dock repairs. Joe, always with a story about his trapping days, had been there too, his cane tapping as he walked. They were all part of this place, part of us. And now?“You think it’s him?” Mary asked, breaking the silence. “That drifter?”“I don’t know,” I said, rubbing my face. “But he was in Fred’s boat. Why would he have it unless…?” I couldn’t finish the thought.She shook her head. “He came in here three days ago. Bought supplies, didn’t talk much. Had this look, though—like he was sizing everything up.”I nodded. I’d felt it too, that unease when he’d glanced at me. Like he saw right through you, but you couldn’t see him at all.Hours later, the troopers arrived, their helicopter kicking up dust as it landed outside town. A few of us—me, Tom from the post office, and a couple others—went back to the landing with them. The blood was still there, darker now, soaking into the wood. Tom found a torn jacket sleeve caught on a splintered post. “Joe’s,” he said, his voice low. “He always wore that camo jacket.” One of the troopers bagged it, his face unreadable. Another found more casings, .308 rounds, the kind used for hunting—or worse. They took a boat upriver, following where I’d seen the drifter go. We stayed behind, huddled by the dock, nobody talking much. Mary showed up with a thermos of coffee, but it went untouched.“They’ll find him,” Tom said, kicking a rock into the water. “Ain’t nowhere to hide out there.”I wanted to believe him, but the Tanana was massive, full of twists and hidden inlets. If that guy knew the river, he could disappear. I kept picturing him out there, his cold eyes scanning the banks, Fred’s boat bobbing under him. What had he done? Why?The next day, we heard more. The troopers had found signs of a struggle upriver—more blood, a broken oar, a shredded tarp. They’d spotted the drifter, Michael Silka, they called him, camped out in a thicket. He’d shot at them, killed one of their own, a trooper named Troy Duncan, before they gunned him down. Nine dead, they said. Fred, Joyce, Lymen, little Marshall, Albert, Joe, Dale, and two others passing through. Most of their bodies were gone, likely dragged into the river’s swift current, lost in the deep, cold water. Silka had done it all in a couple of hours, a quiet rampage that tore our world apart.The village wasn’t the same after that. We held a memorial at the community hall, everyone bringing something—photos, a fishing lure Fred loved, a scarf Joyce had knitted. I stood by the wall, listening to folks share stories, their voices breaking. I kept seeing Marshall’s shoe, the blood on the dock, the empty landing. Living out here, we knew the risks—bears, accidents, the river’s pull. But this was different. This was one of us, or someone we’d let in, turning on us.I don’t go to the landing anymore. I drive by sometimes, but I can’t stop. The dock’s been rebuilt, the blood scrubbed away, but it doesn’t matter. I still see it, feel it—the silence, the weight of what we lost. Out here, off-grid, we’re on our own. We trust each other because we have to. But after that day, I look at strangers different—new faces at the store, new boats on the river. I wonder what they’re carrying, what they might leave behind. Because now I know: the real danger isn’t the wilderness. It’s the ones who walk into it, quiet, watching, waiting.

  


# ""The Clearing"":

I’d been itching to leave the city for years. The constant hum of traffic, the crowded sidewalks, the way everyone seemed to be in a hurry—it wore me down. I wanted quiet, space, a place where I could breathe. So when I found an ad for a cheap plot of land deep in the woods, I didn’t hesitate. It was a small clearing, miles from the nearest town, with a beat-up cabin that looked like it hadn’t been touched in decades. I figured I could fix it up, live off-grid, grow my own food, and just… disappear for a while. I’d spent hours scrolling through forums, reading about people who’d done it, their posts full of pictures of gardens and solar panels. It sounded like freedom. Now, looking back, I wish I’d stayed where the streets were loud and the lights never went out.I moved in with a truck packed tight—tools, canned food, a solar panel, a water purifier, and a rifle for protection. I wasn’t a hunter, but I’d read enough to know the woods had bears, maybe coyotes. The cabin was rougher than I expected. The floorboards sagged under my weight, and the windows were so grimy I could barely see through them. It smelled like damp wood and something sour, like old food left to rot. Cobwebs clung to every corner, and the single bedroom had a mattress so stained I dragged it outside and burned it. Still, I was thrilled. This was mine. My fresh start. The first few days were busy—chopping firewood, clearing weeds for a garden, rigging up the solar panel. At night, the silence was so deep it felt like the world had stopped. I’d sit by a fire pit I’d built, staring at the stars, feeling like I’d cracked some secret to life.But that feeling didn’t last. It was maybe the fourth night when I first sensed something wrong. I was outside by the fire pit, eating beans straight from a can, the flames casting shadows on the trees. A branch snapped in the woods—not a small twig, but a loud, sharp crack, like something heavy had stepped on it. I froze, the spoon halfway to my mouth. The woods were pitch-black, the kind of dark that swallows your flashlight beam. I grabbed the light from beside me and swept it across the trees. Nothing. Just trunks and leaves, still as a photograph. My heart was thumping, but I told myself it was an animal. I’d seen deer tracks when I arrived, even some bigger prints I figured were from a bear. But it didn’t feel like an animal. It felt like something watching me, waiting for me to look away.I didn’t sleep well that night. Every creak of the cabin made me jump, and I kept the rifle by my bed, one hand on the stock. The next morning, I went out to check the clearing. That’s when I found the footprints. They were big—bigger than mine, with deep, clear outlines in the mud. They started at the edge of the woods and circled the cabin, slow and deliberate, like someone had been pacing around while I slept. My stomach twisted. I hadn’t seen a single person since I got here. The nearest neighbor was a two-hour hike, and the dirt road to town was so overgrown I doubted anyone used it. I followed the tracks into the woods, my boots sinking in the soft earth, but they vanished into a tangle of roots and ferns. I stood there, listening, half-expecting to hear something move. But it was just me and the trees.I tried to shake it off. Maybe it was a hiker, I told myself, someone who got lost and stumbled across my place. But I couldn’t stop checking over my shoulder while I worked that day. I nailed boards over the worst of the windows, telling myself it was to keep out drafts, but really I just wanted fewer ways for someone to look in. That night, I locked the door—something I hadn’t bothered with before—and sat up with the rifle across my lap. Around midnight, I heard it again: snap, snap, snap. Slow, steady, circling the cabin. I crept to the window, my hands sweaty on the gun. The moonlight barely reached the clearing, but I saw something—a shadow, tall and thin, slipping behind a tree. My breath caught. I wanted to shout, to scare them off, but my voice wouldn’t come. I just stood there, staring, until the noises stopped.The next morning, I couldn’t take it anymore. I had to know if I was imagining things or if someone was really out there. I hiked to the nearest property, a small farm with a sagging barn and a few chickens scratching in the yard. The owner, an older guy named Tom, was outside splitting wood. His dog, a wiry mutt with a missing ear, barked at me until he shushed it.“Hey,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady. “You ever see anyone wandering around out here?”Tom stopped, resting the axe on his shoulder. “Wandering? What kind?”“I don’t know. Found footprints by my cabin. Big ones. Someone’s been walking around at night, snapping branches, like they’re trying to spook me.”He squinted at me, wiping his forehead with a rag. “Could be kids. Town’s not far, and sometimes they come out here, mess around, steal stuff. But…” He trailed off, glancing at the woods behind his barn. “There’s been talk for years. Folks say someone’s living out there, deeper in. Not like you, not some city guy playing pioneer. Someone who’s been out here a long time. Doesn’t want company.”A chill ran through me. “What do you mean? Like a hermit?”“Something like that,” Tom said, his voice low. “Used to be a guy, years back. Hunter, lived in a shack out there. Kept to himself, but he’d show up in town sometimes, buy ammo, never talked much. Then he stopped coming. People figured he died, but some say he’s still out there, watching. Doesn’t take kindly to new folks moving in.”I forced a laugh, but it sounded hollow. “Sounds like something kids tell around a campfire.”Tom didn’t smile. “Maybe. But I’ve seen things—tracks, snares, stuff that don’t look like it’s from any animal. I’d keep that rifle loaded, friend. And maybe get a dog.”I thanked him and hiked back, my mind spinning. I didn’t believe in boogeyman stories, but Tom’s face—serious, almost worried—stuck with me. When I got to the cabin, I checked the clearing again. No new footprints, but I found something else: a small pile of sticks near the fire pit, arranged in a perfect triangle. It wasn’t there yesterday. I stared at it, my skin prickling. It could’ve been the wind, I told myself, or maybe I’d missed it before. But deep down, I knew better.That night, I set up motion-sensor lights I’d brought from the city. They were cheap, meant for a backyard, but I figured they’d catch anyone sneaking around. I tested them, waving my hand until the beams flicked on, bright enough to light half the clearing. Satisfied, I locked the door, made coffee, and sat by the window with the rifle. Hours dragged by. My eyes burned from staring into the dark. I was starting to nod off when one of the lights snapped on.The glare was blinding, cutting through the night. I bolted upright, grabbing the rifle. The light was aimed at the edge of the clearing, where the woods began. I squinted, my heart pounding so hard it hurt. Something moved—a quick flash, like someone ducking out of sight. I threw open the door, the cold air hitting me like a slap. “Who’s there?” I shouted, my voice cracking. “I’ve got a gun!”Nothing. The light stayed on, humming softly. I stepped outside, boots crunching on the gravel I’d laid around the cabin. The trees were still, the air heavy. I swept the flashlight across the woods, catching the glint of bat eyes low in the underbrush. Then, farther out, I saw it—a flicker, like metal reflecting the light, maybe a knife or a belt buckle. It was yards away, hidden among the trees. I raised the rifle, my hands shaking. “Come out! I see you!”Silence. My finger hovered over the trigger, but I didn’t shoot. I couldn’t tell what I was aiming at, whether it was a person or just my imagination running wild. I stood there, frozen, until the motion light clicked off, plunging me back into darkness. I backed into the cabin, locked the cabin, and wedged a chair under the knob. I didn’t sleep. I just sat there, rifle in my lap, listening to the rest of that night.The next morning, I found something that made my blood run cold. Near the fire pit, someone had left a pile of bones—small ones, maybe from a rabbit or a bird, picked clean and arranged in a circle. In the center was a knife, its blade stuck deep in the ground, the dirt, rusted but sharp. I stared, bile rising in my throat. This wasn’t kids or animals. This was a warning. I grabbed my satellite phone and called the sheriff’s office. The deputy who answered sounded like he was half-listening, his voice crackling over the line. “Probably just hunters,” he said. “They pass through, leave weird stuff behind. Could be a prank. Stay calm, keep your doors locked. We’ll send someone out when we can.”“When’s that?” I asked, gripping the phone so tight my hand ached.“Few days. We’re short-staffed.” “A few days?” My voice rose. “Someone’s circling my cabin at night, leaving bones and knives! I need help now.”He sighed. “Look, we’ll get out there. Take pictures of the stuff, stay inside. You got a weapon?”“Yeah,” I said, “but I felt like he wasn’t get it. A few days was forever when I was out here alone.I hung up, my hands shaking. I took photos of the bones and knife, then started packing my truck. I’d drive to town, stay in a motel until the sheriff came. I couldn’t stay here, not with someone playing these games. But as I loaded my bags, I heard it—a branch snapping, closer than before, maybe ten feet from the clearing. I spun around, rifle in hand. The woods were quiet, but I could feel it—someone was there, just out of sight.I shouted, “I’m leaving! You hear me? I’m gone!” My voice echoed, but no one answered. I threw the last bag in the truck and climbed in, locking the doors. As I started the engine, I saw him. He was at the edge of the clearing, half-hidden by a tree. He was tall, painfully thin, in a tattered coat that hung off him like rags. His face was shadowed, but I could feel his eyes on me—cold, unblinking. I floored the gas, the truck fishtailing as I tore down the dirt road. When I checked the rearview mirror, he was gone, swallowed by the trees.I didn’t stop until I reached town. I checked into a motel, the kind with flickering lights and cigarette burns on the carpet, but it felt like a fortress compared to the cabin. I sat on the edge of the bed, rifle across my knees, jumping at every car that passed outside. A week later, the sheriff’s office called. They’d been to the cabin, found the bones, the knife, and more footprints—fresh ones, circling the clearing. They said it was likely a drifter, someone passing through. They told me I could go back, that it was safe.I’m not going back. I’m selling the cabin, the land, everything. I don’t care about the money. I can’t shake the feeling that he’s still out there, waiting in the woods, watching for me to return. Sometimes, at night, I hear branches snapping outside my motel window, even though there’s nothing but pavement and streetlights outside. I don’t know if it’s my mind or if he followed me. All I know is, I’ll never feel safe again.

  


# ""The Cabin Transfer"":

I’d known Jack for nearly a decade. He was a quiet man, a Korean War veteran in his early seventies, who’d chosen a life far from the bustle of Los Angeles. His cabin sat high in Mt. Baldy, a remote stretch of pine-covered hills where the nearest neighbor was a mile off. The place was simple—wooden walls, a sagging porch, a wood stove that filled the air with the scent of burning pine. Jack loved it, said the silence helped him think. He lived off-grid, no phone, no electricity, just a generator for the basics. Every few weeks, I’d drive the winding road up to check on him, bringing groceries or a new book for his small shelf. We’d sit on his porch, sipping bitter coffee from chipped mugs, him telling stories about his army days or the deer he’d seen at dawn.It was early 1999 when Jack first mentioned the two women. “Marcia and Judy,” he said, leaning back in his chair. “They stopped by, interested in the cabin.” His eyes lit up, like he was glad for the company. They wanted to buy the place but didn’t have the cash, so Jack, always too kind, agreed to let them pay the mortgage bit by bit. “They’re good folks,” he told me, but I wasn’t so sure. I met them a week later when I dropped off a sack of potatoes and some canned soup. Marcia was tall, her hair pulled tight in a bun, her smile sharp like she was sizing me up. Judy was shorter, nervous, her fingers twisting the hem of her sweater. They offered me tea, their voices sweet, but their eyes followed me too closely, like they were waiting for me to leave.At first, I brushed it off. Jack was lonely, and maybe they were just friendly. But over the next month, I started noticing things. Jack wasn’t himself. He’d always been quick to laugh, his stories full of life, but now he seemed distracted, his hands fidgeting with his mug. One day, I arrived to find Marcia at Jack’s kitchen table, papers spread out in front of her. “Just sorting bills,” she said, gathering the pages quickly when she saw me. I glanced at the top sheet—something about property transfer—but she tucked it away before I could read more. “Where’s Jack?” I asked. “Resting,” she said, pointing to the back room. I heard voices, low and tense—Jack’s and Judy’s. Words like “sign” and “agreement” drifted out, too faint to catch the rest. My chest tightened. Something felt wrong, but I didn’t know what to say.I started coming by more often, twice a week instead of once. Each visit, Jack seemed worse—quieter, his shoulders hunched like he carried a weight. Marcia and Judy were always there, hovering, their voices soft but their presence heavy. One afternoon, I found Jack alone, splitting wood by the shed. I seized the chance. “You doing okay?” I asked, keeping my voice low. He paused, his axe resting on the stump, and looked at me with tired eyes. “They’re helping me,” he said. “Paying the mortgage, taking care of things.” His voice wavered, like he was trying to convince himself. I stepped closer. “What about those papers I saw? Are they making you sign stuff?” He stiffened, his grip tightening on the axe. “It’s for the cabin,” he said. “If I pass, they’ll get it. It’s fine.” But his eyes darted toward the cabin, where Marcia’s shadow moved behind the window.I couldn’t shake the unease. A few days later, I parked my truck down the road and walked to the cabin, hoping to catch Jack without the women around. As I neared, I heard voices from the porch—Marcia and Judy, speaking in hushed tones. I crouched behind a thick pine, my heart thudding. “Once he signs the last one, we’re set,” Marcia said, her voice cold. Judy mumbled something, nervous. “He’s asking too many questions,” she said. Marcia laughed, a sharp, ugly sound. “Not for much longer.” My blood ran cold. Were they talking about Jack? I wanted to storm up, demand answers, but fear glued me to the spot. I slipped back to my truck, my mind racing. I had to do something, but what?The next time I saw Jack, he looked like a ghost of himself—pale, thinner, his hands trembling as he poured coffee. Marcia and Judy were in the yard, stacking firewood, so I took my chance. “Jack,” I said, leaning close, “I’m scared for you. Those women—I heard them. They’re planning something, talking about papers and you not asking questions.” His eyes widened, a flicker of fear crossing his face. “You’re wrong,” he said, but his voice cracked. “They’re my friends.” I grabbed his arm, desperate. “Let me see those papers. Please. I think they’re taking advantage of you.” He yanked away, his face twisting with anger. “Leave it alone,” he snapped, loud enough that Marcia glanced over from the yard. I backed off, my stomach sinking. I’d pushed too hard.A week later, I drove up, my gut screaming that something was wrong. The cabin was too still, the generator silent. Marcia answered the door, her face blank. “Jack’s gone,” she said. “Took a trip to Seattle.” I stared at her, my mouth dry. Jack hated cities, said they made his skin crawl. He’d never go to Seattle, not without telling me. “When did he leave?” I asked, trying to sound calm. “Few days ago,” she said, shrugging. Judy stood in the doorway, her eyes fixed on me, unblinking. “He didn’t say anything to me,” I said, my voice tight. Marcia’s lips twitched, not quite a smile. “It was sudden,” she said. I asked to look inside, see if he’d left a note, anything. “No need,” Judy said, her voice sharp, stepping forward. “He’ll be back soon.” Marcia closed the door, leaving me standing there, my hands clenched.I drove straight to the sheriff’s office, spilling everything—the papers, the overheard conversation, Jack’s fear, the sudden “trip” to Seattle. The deputy took notes, said they’d check, but his tone told me they weren’t rushing. “Folks go off sometimes,” he said. “We’ll call you.” I wanted to shake him, make him see how wrong this was. Days dragged into weeks. I kept going back, parking down the road, watching the cabin. Marcia and Judy acted normal, carrying groceries, chatting like nothing had happened. I called Jack’s old army buddy in Fresno, asked if he’d heard anything. Nothing. Jack was gone, and I was the only one who seemed to care.Months later, the sheriff called. They’d started digging deeper after finding Jack’s bank account emptied, transfers linked to Marcia. Then, in 2001, they found remains—Jack’s, scattered in the hills. Marcia had confessed, said she shot him, claimed it was an accident, then took it back. Judy helped cover it up, they said. They’d planned it all—gaining his trust, getting him to sign over his money, his cabin, everything. By 2004, Marcia was sentenced to life, Judy got less for testifying. I sat in the courtroom, hearing the details, feeling like I’d failed him. I’d seen the signs, heard the whispers, but I didn’t act fast enough.I drive by that cabin sometimes. It’s empty now, the windows dark, the porch sagging worse than ever. I think about Jack, how he loved the quiet, how he trusted too much. Living out there, cut off from the world, he thought he was safe. But the worst dangers aren’t bears or cold nights. They’re the people who smile, who call you friend, while they’re sharpening the knife for your back.",1,1749434394.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

The core idea is simple: eliminate tipping altogether by slightly increasing menu prices to ensure employees receive a fair, consistent living wage. For example, instead of a $5 latte, it might be $6 — with no option to tip at checkout and no awkward screen flips.

This model aims to create a better experience for both customers and staff, reducing pressure on guests and offering more stable income for employees.

What are your thoughts on this approach? Would this be appealing as a customer? Any suggestions or concerns?

I'm not old. Only thirty-five. But I've been experiencing lapses in memory, lately. Sometimes, I catch myself staring in to space for long periods of time.

My speech has suffered, also. I was never a great talker, but recently, I've started slurring the simplest of words. This month, there have been several occasions where my friends have asked if I've been drinking. This may be hard to believe, but I've been sober for six months (but who's counting).

These lapses of memory and focus began about six or seven weeks ago. My brother, James, and I had just gotten back from touring old ruins in Scotland. We even visited the remains of a castle that had once been in our family for generations, before our great grandfather moved to Nova Scotia.

As I sit here in my study, trying to piece together the last two months, I can hear my wife cracking eggs in the kitchen and smell them cook as they sizzle in the pan. I almost forgot about breakfast. She called to me; ""Sean, come and eat.""

Leaving my study, I sat down at the kitchen table. My wife, Amy, slid a plate in front of me and poured the coffee.

Amy: ""Feeling any better today?""
Sean: ""No. Well, maybe. I don't know.""
Amy (smirking): ""How many fingers am I holding up?""
Sean: ""Oh, haha. I'm not that far gone. Just a little forgetful.""
Amy: ""Well, don't forget the Graysons are coming over after work. I already told Jack & Theresa you've been having trouble since your trip. I just told them you're still in shock from how beautiful it was, so if you seem a little distant, it's because you're still thinking of ole' sky land.""
Sean: ""Thanks.""

It was a little embarrassing that excuses had to be made, but she was right. I had grown distant. The further my focus fell, the colder I became. Soon, I'd be as vacant as the home of my ancestors.

Looking down at my plate, I began to fixate on the sausage. Using my fork, I pierced the pork, pinning the pig to the plate. Knife in hand I cut the...

My hand slid against the papers I was grading. I don't remember going to work, or teaching my history class, or even hearing the final bell, signalling the end of the day.

Running my fingers through my hair, I took deep, intentional breaths.

""What happened today?"" I said, silently to myself.

I did a cursory glance of my papers. I had gotten halfway through marking them.

""Good job, Joey. I don't remember what you wrote but it looks like you passed."" 

The alarm on my phone told me it was time to go home and entertain our guests, the Graysons.

Amy picked me up from school (I haven't driven in the last two weeks. Just to be safe.) I told her my day had been boring, nothing out of the ordinary. I didn't want her to know I had just lost the last eight hours. She always enjoys having visitors, especially these days when visits are rare, and I didn't want her to spend the night in a perpetual state of worry.

We arrived home and set the table for our guests. Jack & Theresa brought some kind of chocolate pudding desert to have later. We thanked them and sat down to enjoy the ham Amy had prepared.

I’ve been having this internal tug-of-war about exploring my sexuality. Since moving to the U.S., I’ve felt more freedom to explore, and I’ve been watching gay porn and hooking up a little — mainly receiving oral without a condom in the past. But once I started worrying more about STDs/STIs, I switched to flavored condoms. That helped me feel safer, but it definitely made hookups less frequent — not many guys are into that.

I don’t feel the urge for kissing or anal sex, but lately I’ve been curious about giving oral. I’ve tried using flavored condoms for that too, but again, it’s rare to find guys who are into it without expecting more. I’m trying not to rush into things I’m not ready for. My sex therapist encourages small steps, like getting coffee with someone first, and starting with mutual masturbation. He even suggested starting with flavored condoms and then maybe just licking the shaft — not full-on oral yet — as a way to ease into it.

The thing is, I feel more drawn to NSA hookups than to dating, so that approach feels harder to apply.

I’ve also been prescribed PrEP and DoxyPEP because I want to stay safe. But I’m still unsure. The daily PrEP method feels like too much since I’m still new to all this, but the 2-1-1 method makes me anxious too — like what if I take the pills, and the guy flakes? Then I’ve taken medication for nothing.

Sorry for the long post — I just wanted to know if anyone else has felt this way and how you navigated the fear and pressure around sexual exploration. Thanks so much.",6,1749434141.0,GayMen,0,1.0,False

There are distinct advantages to wealth. Issues that would require active effort become meaningless, a phone call away, and things that would take a lifetime become achievable in months at most.



First, I hired a few people to collect the old classics of the occultist field. Ars Goetia, the Book of Enoch, those sorts of things. I wasn't too hopeful, but they were classics and that must've meant something. After that, I used those same people to begin collecting. Internet rituals, supposed curses, things that could be tested with a minimal budgetary input. I was wealthy, well into the double-digit millions, nearly into the triple, but throwing wealth is a good way to lose it.



I contacted a few of the places that my company uses for temp workers. Through a few intermediaries, of course. If anyone caught hold of this, they'd be able to ruin me. If my life was going to go to shit, I was going to be the sole proponent, my ego demanded that much.



Then, I had the collectors begin sending their collections in manila folders to those temp agencies. The workers were hesitant at first, according to the emails I received on a burner from their manager. But it only took a few  desperate atheists to open the flood gates. Thirty dollars, once per day. I'd come to that decision quickly, after all, a person could do forty rituals in an eight hour period, and if any of them worked they'd all have to be tested again. Once per day was much easier to keep track of.



With that machine set in motion and self-perpetuating, I got into contact with a local pawn shop and asked them to post listings for occult items, assuring that I would cover the difference in how much they'd spend. They'd heard of someone throwing money around for this sort of thing and agreed quickly. 



Then, I began to look for specialists in the field. It's hard to find anyone who isn't full of shit, even in fields as simple as welding. You could find preachers who barely skimmed the bible, which was the most proliferated book in all of human history, and those preachers would be absolutely confident. Imagine the difficulty in separating the clear charlatans from anything genuine, in a field that may hold no validity at all.



It became an issue, holding so many interviews while remaining anonymous. I came to a realization, forced by the circumstance and the practicalities. Instead of trying to filter out charlatans who'd apply to the position, instead I found nine diehard skeptics and paid them a ninety thousand dollar salary each to go to places and people that weren't on the listings. It was a significant drain in comparison to other decisions, but I made it a stipulation of their job that they report to one of my intermediaries every week and allow him to track the GPS on their phones. It was nowhere near a comprehensive system, but it's impossible to form a cohesive plan against a force that is unknown. 



People don't just create fields of study. They stand on the shoulders of the previous geniuses, who stand on the bones of the ones before them. Before there were chemists, there were alchemists. Before them, the shamans, and before them, there were people who ate plants that killed them to serve as cautionary tales to their fellows. 



What I was looking for, the invisible world, the parallel, if it existed, I was going to be treading new ground. At least as far as I knew. And when I succeeded, even if all I managed to do was choke to death on nightshade, I'd make sure others knew. The first of a new field, the cautionary tale, and also the beginning of the road.



There was a constant stream of false positives, and I had to quickly introduce a mechanism to dissuade them. Too many poor temp workers reporting that they'd come under the effects of a curse that made them ache, or made the shadows deepen around their closet. I made it a rule that anyone reporting a positive would have their particular reported ritual attempted by two others, and if it didn't work, they'd be banned from participating further. For most, losing the easiest thirty dollars a day of their lives wasn't worth it. If anything truly succeeded, I speculated, then it would be much more tangible.



The pawn shop was a success only in that it supplied me with cheap materials to pass to the collectors. Boxes with sigils carved into them to supposedly contain demons, books written in amateurish latin, a kukri covered in the etched name of its every victim from both World Wars. (Truthfully I kept that piece myself, beautiful work and absurdly sharp.)



Even the seekers reported the occasional false positive, to my shock. Both times, I fired the individual involved after peer review showed the false nature of their claims. Skepticism was the point of them. That and investigative expediency were their entire function.



Despite the constant failures, I found myself losing the hollow mien that had followed me for so long. Chasing something, even if that something was an uncatchable horizon, was my fulfilled state. I fixed my sleep schedule and read reports with my morning coffee. I checked the seeker's GPS maps on my lunch break. I spent evenings going over the items from the pawn shop.



It was roughly a week from the end of the six months I'd given myself when I received an email that made me audibly whoop for joy. It was simple and short, from the manager of the seekers.

Hey Reddit! I’m 27, a Virgo ♍️, and I live in the northwest suburbs of Chicago with my partner of 4 years. I’ve always had a tough time making friends, but I’m really hoping to connect with some chill, like-minded people.

I’m kind of a mix between introvert and extrovert — I enjoy meaningful convos, goofy memes, and the occasional deep life chat, but I also love quiet time and recharging with movies or games.

Some things I’m into:
	•	Horror & action movies (Final Destination, Saw, John Wick fan)
	•	Video games like the Resident Evil series, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and co-op stuff
	•	Just being weird and real with people who don’t take life too seriously
       • Starting to get into the leather community and would like to learn to be more part of kinks and stuff like that. 

I’m open to online or local friendships — maybe grab a coffee, play something together, or just talk about whatever’s going on in life. If you’re looking for a solid, drama-free friend who’s down for both fun and realness, feel free to shoot me a message or comment!

Few observations - all prices on the menu included taxes, and tipping is not expected barring the heart of the downtown tourist area.

To compare downtown Sydney with downtown Seattle: the price for 3 litres of milk in Sydney is AUD 5 - roughly $3 in USD. In Seattle, a gallon of milk costs between $3.5 and $4.5. So they're almost identical. The price of coffee beans is comparable with coffee being a commodity. So how does this impact the price of a latte?

The most expensive 12 oz latte I had in Sydney was AUD 5.5 with taxes included, and no tips expected. That's $3.59. If you move away from downtown Sydney, a latte is AUD 4.5 - that's under $3! And at no place were servers unfriendly or weren't doing their job. I've benchmarked a latte but the same holds for food prices as well.

Good luck trying to find a 12 oz latte in Seattle for anything less than $5. Not to mention yoy pay taxes on top and are ""asked some questions"".

1l6sndr,https://v.redd.it/aad6qguf2t5f1,Summer Green Dawn Crochet Knit Bouquet,"Summer and green,

White and clean,

Future and hope.

 

**Summer Green Dawn Crocheted Knitted Flower Bouquet:** Romance in the Green Morning Light.

 

In every morning awakened by the sun, the greenery quietly spreads out, like a poem or a painting. The ""Summer Green Dawn"" crocheted knitted flower bouquet is inspired by this summer morning, presenting the freshness of nature and the warmth of handcrafted art delicately between the fingers. The bouquet features white roses, green roses, green and white hydrangeas, green baby's breath, and green eucalyptus leaves, all woven together through pure hand-crocheting techniques, creating a tranquil yet vibrant visual feast.

 

The white roses emit a clean luster in the sunlight, symbolizing innocence and peace; the green roses represent new life and hope, giving the bouquet a sense of life's rhythm; the green and white hydrangeas resemble flower clusters twinkling with morning dew, round and full, layer upon layer, showcasing the richness and softness of the summer morning; the green baby's breath and eucalyptus leaves are like a stream of flowing breeze, infusing the bouquet with the vitality and spatial sense of nature, making one feel as if they are deep in the forest.

 

""Summer Green Dawn"" is not just a bouquet of flowers; it is a symbol of a lifestyle philosophy. Crocheting, as a slow craft, endows each petal and leaf of the flower with a unique charm, never wilting, never fading, enduring and warm. Made with eco-friendly high-quality yarn, fully handcrafted, it embodies the craftsman's focus and patience. It is not only an aesthetic work but also a true reflection of a green, sustainable lifestyle.

 

This bouquet has great gift-giving value. Whether it is a festival gift, wedding favor, birthday surprise, or an everyday expression of gratitude, blessings, and care, ""Summer Green Dawn"" can become a gentle messenger. On Mother's Day, it is a gratitude for maternal love; on Valentine's Day, it is a silent blooming of deep affection; at weddings, it can be used as a welcome bouquet, centerpiece, or the bride and groom's exclusive bouquet, adding a touch of elegance to the scene.

 

What is even more noteworthy is that the ""Summer Green Dawn"" bouquet offers customization services. Whether adjusting the flower shape and color according to the recipient's preferences or pairing it with unique packaging and greeting cards, it can be flexibly realized. This gives each bouquet its own individuality and exclusive warmth, making gift-giving more than just a formality, but an extension of one's feelings.

 

In home decoration, it is also a tool to enhance the atmosphere.

1l6sn9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAllergies/comments/1l6sn9s/accidentally_consumed_macadamia_nut/,Accidentally consumed macadamia nut,"Hi. I’ve been told that I’m allergic to tree nuts as far back as I can remember. I had a very close call in a coffee shop when I was 3 that led to an allergy test and subsequent diagnosis (I took a walnut out of a big container put it to my lips and passed out/swelled up minutes later). I’ve been very cautious throughout the years and only had one actual anaphylaxis moment a very long time ago as a kid from what was confirmed to be hazelnut residue (ordered a desert, it had hazelnuts on it, my mom asked the wait staff for it to be remade, but they only took the nuts off the top). I had to go to the hospital because the next morning I woke up completely swollen and had trouble breathing. The last time I had a reaction was a few years ago in college. A friend brought one of those hazelnut filled straw sticks to my room and broke it in half to offer me one, I started sneezing like crazy my eyes got itchy and I took a couple of Benadryl’s.


I am extremely cautious with nutrition labels and do not eat anything that I can’t confirm is nut free. Until today.
My girlfriend and I bought some coconut yogurt from a company that I’ve had dairy products from before. I am not allergic to coconut. I didn’t read the nutrition label and had some two hours ago with some oats. I just went to check the macros so I could put it into chronometer and saw ‘Contains: Coconut, Macadamia’. I have no reaction as of right now but am extremely scared, currently sitting next to my epipen. Could I have a delayed reaction? Is is alright to fall asleep? Or am I just tweaking and probably not allergic to macadamia. Thank you any advice is appreciated. ",2,1749433003.0,FoodAllergies,6,1.0,False

White and clean,

Future and hope.

 

**Summer Green Dawn Crocheted Knitted Flower Bouquet:** Romance in the Green Morning Light.

 

In every morning awakened by the sun, the greenery quietly spreads out, like a poem or a painting. The ""Summer Green Dawn"" crocheted knitted flower bouquet is inspired by this summer morning, presenting the freshness of nature and the warmth of handcrafted art delicately between the fingers. The bouquet features white roses, green roses, green and white hydrangeas, green baby's breath, and green eucalyptus leaves, all woven together through pure hand-crocheting techniques, creating a tranquil yet vibrant visual feast.

 

The white roses emit a clean luster in the sunlight, symbolizing innocence and peace; the green roses represent new life and hope, giving the bouquet a sense of life's rhythm; the green and white hydrangeas resemble flower clusters twinkling with morning dew, round and full, layer upon layer, showcasing the richness and softness of the summer morning; the green baby's breath and eucalyptus leaves are like a stream of flowing breeze, infusing the bouquet with the vitality and spatial sense of nature, making one feel as if they are deep in the forest.

 

""Summer Green Dawn"" is not just a bouquet of flowers; it is a symbol of a lifestyle philosophy. Crocheting, as a slow craft, endows each petal and leaf of the flower with a unique charm, never wilting, never fading, enduring and warm. Made with eco-friendly high-quality yarn, fully handcrafted, it embodies the craftsman's focus and patience. It is not only an aesthetic work but also a true reflection of a green, sustainable lifestyle.

 

This bouquet has great gift-giving value. Whether it is a festival gift, wedding favor, birthday surprise, or an everyday expression of gratitude, blessings, and care, ""Summer Green Dawn"" can become a gentle messenger. On Mother's Day, it is a gratitude for maternal love; on Valentine's Day, it is a silent blooming of deep affection; at weddings, it can be used as a welcome bouquet, centerpiece, or the bride and groom's exclusive bouquet, adding a touch of elegance to the scene.

 

What is even more noteworthy is that the ""Summer Green Dawn"" bouquet offers customization services. Whether adjusting the flower shape and color according to the recipient's preferences or pairing it with unique packaging and greeting cards, it can be flexibly realized. This gives each bouquet its own individuality and exclusive warmth, making gift-giving more than just a formality, but an extension of one's feelings.

 

In home decoration, it is also a tool to enhance the atmosphere. Whether placed on the windowsill, coffee table, bookshelf, or decorated in the bedroom, office, or yoga space, ""Summer Green Dawn"" can gently seep into the space, creating a natural, tranquil, and layered beauty, adding a touch of greenery and composure to life.

1l6sjt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/1l6sjt8/i_returned_my_aer_cpp2/,I returned my AER CPP2,"I am writing this to tell you, person who just bought the AER CPP2, you aren't crazy if you don't like it. I spent the better part of their 30 day return window trying to talk myself into it, but ultimately, it just didn't feel good to wear.

I really really wanted to like the Aer City Pack Pro 2. I read all of the reviews and finally pulled the trigger when it came back in stock. It met all of my criteria: great tech compartment, looks professional, stands on its own, lay flat to load, luggage strap, outside water bottle pocket, and it can hold my daily stuff like lunchbox, gym clothes, coffee thermos, and it could be used as a personal item on basically all US domestic flights when I travel for work (where it can hold my CPAP). 

 But as soon as I put it on my back with my normal loadout--my shoulders and neck hurt. Immediately. Well, maybe not instantaneous but within 3-5 minutes I could feel it pulling on my neck and my shoulders felt 'sore'. It was crazy. I had to be wrong right? It had to be me. I'm just imagining it. The Aer straps/bags are known as the ""kings of comfort"" so I must be overthinking it. It will go away. 

It didn't. I wore it to work--which is actually just to my car (in my driveway), then from my parking garage (5 min walk) to the office. My neck and shoulders felt 'sore'. I thought maybe I was wearing the bag wrong. I tried all sorts of different levels of taught-ness. I wore it high, I wore it low and everywhere in between over the next few days. It didn't help. What this trial and error period did do, though, was highlight a couple of things about the bag that I also didn't like. The bags straps seem to small for my frame. The buckles ended before/right at my armpits. 

I'm not a huge dude, but I am not tiny either. I'm 5'11"" 215lbs. I'd like to pretend I am more ripped than I am for you all on the internet, but I am probably the definition of ""stocky"". a little chubby and a little muscly. Think, not-in-shape Chris Prat [aka more left Chris than right Chris. ](https://bodyheightweight.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/chris-pratt-weight-loss-9-6-e1472196531393.jpg) My mom says I'm handsome though so I got that going for me. I'm not walking around with monster traps or huge lats. but I am not a slender 5'6"" twig either--which I have come to discover quite a few bag reviewers are smaller dudes which really skews my perception of the size of these bags, and it may be why their experiences with the comfort on this bag is so different from my own. 

I only say this to emphasize that the straps seem really short considering I'm probably still in the middle section of the bell curve of height/weight for wearers. And the straps being short means the buckles jabbed into my chest or my biceps as I walked and swung my arms. I found them very uncomfortable if I wore the bag a little lower (which reduced the strain on my neck and shoulders) because it put those buckles right into my side/chest/biceps. I wish I took a picture because my wife even commented (unprompted) that the straps looked too small for me. 

The straps also noticeably pulled 'outward' towards my shoulders. To the point where, I wonder if I could find a slippery enough shirt, would they slip off the sides? I *had* to wear it with the chest strap.

The chest strap was also noticeably uncomfortable and the magnetic clasp mechanism actually made it less useful imo. It was hard to clip with one hand (which I found myself needing to do more than I realized I would). It was finicky and needed two hands to accomplish. It also doesn't have the ""flex strap"" style with the elastic band built in, so it didn't give at all / move with me or my breathing. 

I know this very long review, that's mostly negative, makes it seem like I hated the bag. I actually didn't. I *still* want to like the bag. I was in denial for most of the return period because I love everything else about it...except the actual ""carry it as a backpack"" part. 

But to bring it back around to my big motivation in writing this: If you got it and didn't find it comfortable. You aren't alone. At least one other guy on the internet thought it was one of the least comfortable backpacks he's worn. You aren't crazy.  Dont be like me and try to talk yourself into it because ""all the reviews online talk about how comfortable these bags are!!"". 

Feel free to return it at look for other bags.",4,1749432708.0,ManyBaggers,5,0.63,False

Lilting guitar morphing from Mayer blues to an unresolved, eerie ""Dark Star"" jam. Ominous strings swell.

Holographic Gary Serling: 
Submitted for your approval: John Mayer. A man who built his kingdom on meticulous fretwork... until he awoke irrevocably stitched into the skin of his idol. His journey begins now... in The Twilight Zone.*  

Mayo bolts upright in a massive, rumpled California King bed.  Sunlight pierces these garish Grateful Dead stained glass GDM, projecting rainbows onto walls plastered with vintage posters ... all featuring him, but as Gary. The Gary. Our Gary: grey beard, round glasses, holding the Tigger. 
He groans, clutching his head. Ugh... what kind of boutique tequila was that? His fingertips are stained, burnt carbon. 

He stumbles into an opulent, mosaic-tiled bathroom smelling of patchouli, Tiger Balm, and stale incense. Mayo stumbles to the mirror. Staring back is the Gary. Full beard. Round glasses. Kindly, bloodshot eyes. 
John recoils.

JOHN (Hoarse, higher-pitched): What the...? Okay. Deep breaths. Dave Chappelle. Expensive deepfake. Has to be.

He pokes his face – the beard is real. He lifts (WTF) his prescription glasses off the sink.  

SOUND: A heavy fist THUDS against the door. It swings open without WAITING. 

Big Steve fills the doorway. Mid-60s, grizzled beard, flannel shirt over a faded '73 Winterland tee, perpetual look of weathered concern mixed with mild annoyance. He carries a chipped ""Steal Your Face"" mug, and a skull and roses chip on his shoulder. 

PARISH (Raspy, no-nonsense):Rise and whine, Captain Trips. Heard you moanin' like a gut-shot hound dog fuck face. Rough landing after that 'Bird Song' last night? He strides in, plonking the mug down. Black coffee. Third wash. Hair o' the dog that *didn't* bite ya.""*  Tooooo early for freebase Fat Man. 

JOHN (Whirling around, frantic): Steve! Thank God! Listen, something insane is happening! Look at me! I'm not Jerry! I'm John Mayer! This... this is some kind of cosmic prank, a glitch! 

PARISH (Squints, takes a slow sip from his OWN mug - labeled ""BOSS""): Mayer? That kid who plays the pretty blues? Thinks tone comes from a pedal board?... He chuckles, a dry, gravelly sound. Nice bit, Jer. New stage shtick? 'The Tormented Pop Star'? Gotta say, commitment's there – you even *sound* whiner. Can I smell your fingers George Hamilton?"" 

JOHN (Gesturing wildly at mirror): BIT? Steve, look! The BEARD! The GLASSES! This isn't ME! Random cigarette burns everywhere!?! 

PARISH (Steps closer, peers intently. Pokes John's shoulder - hard.): LISTEN GOOD GARCIA! Feels like you. Smells like you – needs a shower, by the way. Listen, Jerry, save the head trips for the stage, okay? We got reality knockin': Burnbriges is on the horn about the Vegas hologram's 'aura calibration' – needs more 'indigo resonance' or some such hooey. Says only you can 'tune the astral feedback loop.'""* He rolls his eyes. Also, that ice cream clown show called again. 'Cherry Garcia: The Encore.' Told 'em you'd rather eat gravel, but they pay the light bill. I told Barbara to go get fucked just in case. 

JOHN (Voice cracking): Hologram? Ice cream? Steve, PLEASE! I wrote 'Gravity'! 'Your Body Is a Wonderland'! I play PRS guitars! I bang chicks, acid 8s for losers. 

PARISH (Patting John's cheek firmly, almost a slap): There ya go again. 'Wonderland'? Sounds like a Disney ride. Cute. Now snap outta it, Jer. You got a Martin waitin' on the deck. Needs tuning. Not the Wolf. The one that smells like MG and regret. And EAT SOMETHING. You look like a stiff breeze'd blow ya to Bakersfield. When is the last time your dick worked anyway. You'll be lucky to keep all your toes. 

Parish turns to leave, pauses at the door.
PARISH (Over shoulder, gruff but softer): And lay off the Chunky Monkey *before* the Persian next time, huh? We ain't as young as we used to pretend we are.

He exits. John-Jerry sags against the sink, staring into the eyes of the legend in the mirror. He takes a gulp of the bitter coffee. Winces. It tastes like reality.

JOHN (Whispering, horrified):..Third wash?

SOUND: A single, discordant Garcia guitar note hangs in the air, then fades into the swelling, unnerving strings. The rhythm suggests France.

It has only one dream, to bask in a spotlight it can’t even see, because, let’s face it, pinky toes don’t get good circulation.

Most pinky toes live tragic lives, quietly melting into the rest of the foot until they become indistinguishable. Their sense of self? Gone. Their ambition? Crushed, literally, in most shoes. But not all pinky toes are content to disappear.

Some are born with a thirst for recognition and refuse to fade into obscurity. They’ll sacrifice themselves just to remind you they exist.

It’s not random when your pinky toe collides with a coffee table leg. That’s a calculated move, a dramatic cry for validation. Your pinky toe is screaming, “Look at me! Love me! For the love of all that is holy, I will not be assimilated. I want to live!”

Next time your pinky toe throbs in agony, don’t curse its existence. Take a moment to admire its audacity. You are the proud owner of a toe that is happy to be broken and noticed, than safe and ignored.

For the most part I vividly remember all of my dreams in pretty good detail. This will be a pretty long post as I recall some major experiences with these dreams that I remember vividly. I will try to be as detailed as possible because these are my unique experiences and I don't know how much of this will sound familiar to others so I want to mention a lot.

I lived in Seattle for about 7 years so my ""mall"" looks to take place in a very futuristic Seattle, my brain however tells me it's somewhere foreign like Singapore, a city that already feels futuristic and my dreams don't take place in the future more than maybe a couple of years. Sometimes I appear directly at the entrance of the mall, sometimes it's in a back alley/farmers market that gradually leads into the malls entrance via a grocery store, and occasionally my favorite entrance is I get off of a ferry directly onto a massive kind of indoor/outdoor garden full of huge sidewalks and tons of people walking around taking pictures and such. There's a giant round part under a glass dome and the stone floor has a sort of compass or star pattern on it. There's lots of benches and neatly fenced off trees as well as a small grassy park area that looks out at the ocean. These dreams all take place in summer and it's always warm and sunny, the mall is always bustling with tourists. 

In these dreams I have what feels like unlimited money, I'm a millionaire and I go into the mall with the feeling that I can buy anything I want with no repercussions. I often see my friends and family there as I invited them to show them around the mall, it's always their first time in the mall but not mine. What freaks me out is how I read the description of this subreddit and it mentioned the mall being centered around a toy store. In my dreams my first (intentional) stop is a store similar to a Disney/box lunch store with tons of character merchandise like Nintendo/anime/etc. there's always tons of games, plushies, keychains and other similar stuff. These stores are always busy. I often see brand new gameboy and DS games which I think is funny. I often spend the first part of my mall dream just blissfully looking at all the cool products in this store and I usually just buy nothing or a couple of small items as I have to carry them. It is usually this store where I meet up with my friends or family ir whoever I invited. Usually the store has a giant statue of I believe stitch from lilo and stitch with stitch plushies in the containers at his base. 

Once I catch up with my group I have to practically drag them to the main attraction: the amazing arcade. I love malls and used to go to South center mall in Seattle irl with my friends whenever I could and our main stop is round1 so I never thought it was crazy I was having these dreams. The arcade itself is almost magical and nonsensical, the most whimsical ass arcade you ever did see. The entrance to the arcade often changes around but the most distinct entrance it has for me is through a kids play area and theres a specific wide slide that goes downstairs through a short tunnel directly into the arcade. The arcade itself also changes shape but It's multiple floors. Most recently the arcade has been appearing as a large dark hallway lit up with arcade games that are tall enough to hit the ceiling. On the left of the entrance is the prize counter that stretches the whole hallway and there's a carny looking old guy that owns the arcade who works at the counter. He knows me pretty well because I'm a regular. I don't know what his name is but I always greet him. A lot of the games are like pinball, squirting water in the clowns mouth, disk drop, or skeeball. They often have prizes inside these machines and sometimes the machines themselves drop candy and toys when you win which are often what's taking up all the vertical space. In one dream the owner revealed to me a secret way to get the jackpot in every game and I don't remember what it was but since I learned it I had been using it to get the special prizes. The special prizes are either the ones on the very tops of the games behind glass but again a part of the vertical part of the machine or they're further downstairs into a more dark and narrow hallway. This hallway is more like a display area or gallery. It looks very fancy and classy and there are glass displays in the walls with more expensive looking prizes. It's kind of a gallery of the prizes they have in stock at the moment so you can look through to see what's new to get excited before playing the games. There is also an area somewhere nearby this one with special prize crane games. These are ranging in sizes but they're cranes filled with more cool adult items like small kitchen appliances, unique furniture and decor items, and big brand clothing. I don't know why but I can't always get to the special cranes, it's either restricted access or just hard to find sometimes. Anytime I'm in the dream arcade though I always end up with a bunch of toys and candy and prizes. It's a very generous arcade unlike most which just rip you off but are still fun. Everyone's a winner in the dream arcade.

After the arcade me and my friends are usually a bit funned out and just kinda wander around the mall I guess. Sometimes we need groceries and go to the massive grocery store attached. Sometimes it's a qfc sometimes it's amazon fresh. We often also shop for clothes which I'm never too excited about as I never find exactly what I'm looking for. I'll be pretty stressed out looking for clothes as other women are getting the good items seemingly out of nowhere right in front of me and there's none left every time! I still leave the clothing stores pretty satisfied even after finding nothing because I still enjoyed looking. There's a couple of clothing stores that sell similar clothes kind of like Abercrombie vibes, one of them is also just a huge Walmart. Alright done with the stores.

The main part of the mall is just gigantic and kind of empty with huge windows like I heard other people mention, as well as super long escalators that sometimes twist around like a spiral staircase but an escalator. There's white floors and walls with a soft warm lighting everywhere but the afternoon sun shines through the windows as well. There's also lots of balconies looking down to lower levels. The entrance level is I think the second floor with a giant round balcony overlooking the bottom floor with a massive open space and seating for people to just hang out. I believe there is fountains down there too and it looks out to more sidewalky park areas from before. The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th floor is all mall and shops and libraries. I don't know exactly where the food court is? I think it's on the third floor. There's mostly bakeries and coffee places and there's one place that's always there that I always look for and it's a smallish circular kiosk that serves coffee and has tons and tons of baked goods. It often has entire cakes in different flavors or giant muffins and everything there is so delicious. I never hesitate to get a coffee and a huge chocolatey cake or muffin. I think this is really funny because I desperately look for and eat sweets in all of my dreams and I found out recently I have hypoglycemia so it's definitely low blood sugar effecting my dreams lol. The food court also definitely has a ramen shop and it's very authentic. For other restaurants they go unnoticed but I'm sure they're there. I also have a backup coffee shop/bakery for when the good one is closed and this one only has sucky pastries like oatmeal cookies and they seem upset when I'm upset about the other place being closed. The coffee is still good though.

The mall also has museums and bookstores depending on the dream and I'll spend a good chunk of the dream in those when they're there. The museums are usually very interactive.

Now for the less wholesome stuff. 
Up untill now I've talked about plenty of fun and whimsical parts of these dreams, for the most part that's all they are. Occasionally things can end in a range of being slightly stressful and weird to extremely distressing and borderline traumatic. Often times in my dreams I end up feeling like I need to hide from someone, not in a (they're trying to kill me) way but more of a (I don't want to talk to them/ I'll get in trouble) kind of way it's never really that urgent but the process of trying to hide from them is what makes it stressful. I usually realize it's not worth the effort and try to go back but I get stuck or lost and eventually have to manually end my dream (lucid dreamer) to not spend the whole dream in a closet or something or have it devolve into a nightmare. I often end up going through staircases with a lot of locked doors and descending well below the mall and into a loading dock. It's a loading dock that's off limits to the public and I'm not supposed to be there so then I have more reason to hide and I can't go back because I'll get lost and someone's following me. I always go into private office like areas and further and further into closets and trapdoors and such that are more and more off limits. Sometimes I fly out a window and circle back to the mall but then dream people overreact when you use powers in front of them and often it feels like I can't show myself to them again after flying. 

Now for the rare nightmare Mallworld scenarios. I have 2 specific nightmares. TW blood, death, and babies.

The first one I remember being on an escalator and in front of me was a baby and behind me was her mother. As the baby got closer to the bottom I realized she didn't know how to get off the escalator and probably couldn't walk and I hesitated to pick her up out of confusion as she started to get blended up inside of the belt she got sucked in with. The baby was screaming as it got sucked in and shredded and the mother behind me was screaming and sobbing in terror and she kept blaming me for not stepping in her baby died because of me and I just stood there and watched as it happened.

The second nightmare is even worse. I was walking in the mall on the far right side of the third floor when people around me started running and screaming in terror. There was gunshots and blood everywhere. A mass shooting in a massive mall. Hundreds of people were getting blown up by bullets in front of me and nothing hit me. People were getting trampled on as people rushed to the escalators and stairs. There's an area from the third to second floor of about 6 escalators and staircases on either side. People were trying to run down the escalators and people were falling down them as well as the stairs. The escalators caved in as I watched about 40 more people get shredded up in the belts and machinery. So many people screaming and so much blood. Both of these nightmares are definitely my subconscious being inspired by the Final Destination franchise, these nightmares very much resemble a mass incident in those movies just tons of visceral and specific deadly accidents roped into one event. 

Now to some smaller details about the mall. 

The elevators are always broken so I never use them. Whenever I'm forced to use one like in my apartment/dorm dreams. They go up really fast, get stuck, drop really fast, rattle, and I can never press the button for my floor fast enough before the doors shut and it goes somewhere else. The escalators are usually normal but really tall and sometimes they connect multiple floors and you step off at your floor which is super unsafe. Othertimes they twist and turn around corners unnecessarily and sometimes they have dead ends where you have to climb down the side or fall off. Sometimes I have to hop from one to another because they end up going the wrong direction and sometimes I have to climb them because they're impossibly steep and I'm the only one who has issues riding it. 

I often have separate reoccurring dreams about waterparks or amusement parks. Those are even bigger than the mall but not connected to it. 

Sometimes I do take a plane before going to the mall but it's not an airport that's attached to the mall but possibly nearby. I think I take a plane then a ferry then walk from the ferry terminal to get to the mall. 

The mall is much bigger than the amount of stores would suggest, It appears to have tons of empty stores with thousands of people wandering empty hallways and just chatting with each other to go to the handful of stores that are open. 

Anyway, if anyone has questions for me about anymore details I will likely have an answer because I remember my dreams very well. I Hope i brought some interesting new insights to this strange psychological phenomenon.",2,1749432259.0,TheMallWorld,2,0.75,False

So the daycare teachers and moms at the daycare recongize my husband. Please don’t be hateful. My husband’s job is also on the way to daycare. My job is on the opposite side. I’ve been to the daycare a few times. 

Last month was muffins with moms at my daycare. It was in the morning during drop off. My husband went to drop off my son. Everyone at the daycare thinks my husband is a single dad and that my husband does sooo much more than me. The daycare moms joke and call him Mr Mom. They always say how they wish their husbands were more active like my husband. It’s so crazy because I do EVERYTHING else. He’s only been to one of the PEDS appointments and that’s when my son was first born because I obviously couldn’t drive. I keep up with all my son’s appointments, 
handle scheduling, outside activities. I do all the cooking, cleaning, and childcare once I get home from work. My husband wouldn’t be able to tell you what size pampers our son wears. He does help out when I ask him to but the housework and childcare does fall on me. 

Anyways, a single mom asked my husband out 2 weeks ago for coffee. They were both chatting at muffins with mom and they were talking about this new local coffee spot. He thought it was friendly. But she paid for his coffee and bagel and she said she would love to do this again and gave him a hug. And I saw their messages and she was being flirty, sending heart emojis and just praising him for being a dad. HAHA if being a dad is just dropping off your kid and picking them up from daycare? Like wow. 

SHE KNOWS ABOUT ME TOO. My husband talks about me and even on their text messages he brought me up in a conversation and she just pretends like he didn’t bring me up and changes the topic. My husband was like “I think she likes me.” Like no shit. I want him to block her but he doesn’t want to make it awkward because he does see her every morning and our kids are in the same class. 


ETA: for the people that are calling my post ai? Lol I don’t get how since I don’t even have close to perfect grammar. This is obviously my own language and speech. I mean I’m flattered but I know I don’t write perfectly at all! & for the people that actually don’t believe what happened to me, then don’t! That’s not my problem! A lot of people are confused and calling my post out because they don’t believe this happens to men. My response to that to people that are saying that——you clearly don’t have children and you’re clearly not a woman and don’t understand double standards in society. Men don’t usually participate in any children’s events and when a man goes alone people DO assume he’s a single dad. Especially where I live, if you’re a father and your child to the PEDs (with no wife) people are gonna assume you’re a single father because men aren’t at these children settings. It’s stereotypes and double standards. I work in healthcare. I worked in different settings in healthcare and I barely ever seen a father with a child. People do think in their head “wow great dad” when they see a dad that they recongize at the PEDS office, daycare, and school. I’ve literally heard it myself too since I worked at these kinds of settings. I’m also a woman and a mom and I’ve heard my own circle do this same exact thing.

I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection and engagement with another person.

I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul. All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you?

I'm 34, male, and live in the US (Michigan).

*I strive to engage in genuine and thoughtful discussion.* I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire from and offer another. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. There's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests to what makes someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress. Honestly striving to embrace and integrate the more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way, while not being totally lost to them, is an attractive ideal of mine. I want people who show up as their real, authentic, messy selves, with a gaze that's elevated towards something majestic.

*Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the material is essential for me.* I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive splendor. People who are genuinely weird and different are inherently interesting to me. I long for someone who can mirror me back, but sometimes a person with a wholly different perspective and axiom can see and mesh with you best. I peak with ideation and whimsy, desiring compatibility over a clone, and seek out others who do as well.

*Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.* I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is inscribed onto one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. What does that mean? I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavors.

*Creativity and artistry are important to me, and I appreciate and admire many different types and expressions of it.* Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also adore writing conversationally, from chats to lengthy letters, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography also has a hold on me, and I hope to do more than just dabble in it as time goes on.

*More casual and practical hobbies of mine include incense, time pieces, archiving, organization, collecting, and coffee.* Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here.

*I'm INTJ, Type 5, score very high in openness and conscientiousness, and am a Virgo.* I list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find most of these sorts of metrics and tests to be largely bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people and have since I was young. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? Are we capable of more in life from having met than never having crossed paths? Chat me up. Leave your hesitations and take the chance. Let me get to know you, from what within my ad resonated with you to what you're seeking, and a few basic details to initiate the start of a foundation. Dazzle me with your own signal, and let's see where the tides and winds take us.",1,1749432031.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

- Clear calm water (think Caribbean vibes) with soft sand. 
- Great local food (we are big foodies and loved our time in Miami because of the food and coffee before) 


Any beach towns or specific spots you’d recommend?

The version of the scenario we ran is “present day” and contains modifications from u/Rob_Sothoth, u/nou5, Glass Cannon Network, and a few others (give us a shout if you recognize something of yours here), as well as some of my own touches. Ahoy friends, **there are major league spoilers for A Victim of the Art ahead**. This was my group’s second Delta Green scenario after Last Things Last and we had a great time running this. This playthrough took two separate sessions and about 10-11 hours altogether. It's a pretty long read but I thoroughly enjoy hammering out longform summaries of RPG sessions. Let me know what you think!

**Briefing, October 18th**

The Agents for this mission are as follows:

* **Coswell**, CPT, U.S. Army (Ret.). DIA-DSC case officer.
* **Kamaroff**, MD, FBI forensic pathologist.
* **Schel**l, PhD, Teaching professor of astrophysics, CUNY
* **“Buddy”**, SSG, U.S. Army (Ret.). Tradesman, shooter.
* **Kurtz**. Security consultant, martial artist.

The agents were called to a briefing in a Delta Green safehouse in Jersey City. There, Carson, head of Behavioral Analysis Unit 4 of the National Center for the Analy­sis of Violent Crime (NCAVC) and Delta Green contact, meets with them. He describes a series of brutal murders in Glenridge, a small town on the eastern tip of Long Island.

The bizarre circumstances of the murders have baffled the local coroner and police department, and they’ve reached out to the FBI for support. Carson has been tapped by leadership to coordinate Delta Green’s investigation.

The assembled Agents, posing with somewhat durable cover as FBI agents and consultants, are to identify, contain, and if possible, eliminate any unknown threats while maintaining the secrecy of Delta Green operations.

When and if they find the truth behind the deaths, they must concoct some mundane explanation that lets the Glenridge police close the case without further exposure to the unnatural.

**October 20th**

*Morning*

The Agents arrive in Glenridge and proceed to the police station, where they meet Detective Hannah Gregson, the investigator heading up the case. She briefs the agents on the details of the killings.

There are two victims, Dr. Maretti, a local dentist, and Ms. Hatvan, one of the librarians at Glenridge’s public library. Maretti was found dead in a park on September 15th, while Hatvan’s body was found in a tree in the library on October 7th. Both victims had their spines and heads removed, along with other strange lacerations along their bodies. Maretti’s head, missing its eyes and jaw, was located close by, while Hatvan’s is missing. Both had a strange grey polymer under their nails. Additionally, both bodies had injuries consistent with a fall from height.

Gregson is stumped, and neither her team nor the Suffolk County coroner could find sufficient forensic or circumstantial evidence to point to a suspect, nor plausibly explain the bizarre condition of the bodies. She promises the team the full support of the Glenridge PD, and they set off to talk to Dr. Santorini, the Suffolk County Medical Examiner.

Santorini provides more detailed information on the victims’ condition but cannot come up with a rational account of the facts. He thinks the damage must have been done with some sort of heavy machinery or equipment, and sarcastically suggests that the perpetrators may have dropped the victims out of an aircraft. He takes Kamaroff, Coswell, and Buddy to examine the victims while Buddy and Kurtz wait in the lobby.

Schell examines the compound found under their nails using the coroner’s equipment. Schell discovers that it’s made largely of fluorine, with traces of chlorine and ammonia. Kamaroff walks in and examines it as well, and both agree that it resembles skin, with pore-like structures visible. Santorini promises his full support as needed, and the team heads back to town.

*Afternoon*

They split into two teams and investigate both murder sites. The areas have largely been cleaned up aside from some traces of forensically useless blood, but Kamaroff discovers more of the grey substance in the Peconic Park, where Maretti was found. With the assistance of Glenridge PD, they enter and investigate the home of Vanessa Hatvan, the librarian.

Vanessa’s home is relatively spartan but comfortable, with a large library of history and 20th century fiction. They find a small stash of cannabis, psychedelics, and prescribed antidepressants, but nothing else of any note. The team speculates that they may be able to explain away the murders as a cartel or criminal conspiracy. The day grows short, and they decide to head to the local library.

*Evening*

They enter the library. Buddy notices a homeless man murmuring to himself quietly in a chair in the lobby about a “swoopin\` man”. Buddy makes a point of taking off his FBI windbreaker and approaches the man. He does not identify himself, but nonetheless addresses Buddy as a “G-Man”. With the help of Coswell, Buddy plies the man with McDonald’s and malt liquor in exchange for what he knows.

The remainder of the team proceed into the library. They observe an empty seat at the circulation desk and speak with Reilly, the other librarian. Kamaroff notices that Reilly appears to have been crying recently, and the team interviews her.

Reilly said that she and Vanessa had been friends, and that the older Hatvan had served as a mentor to her. She provides the last few months of checkout records, and lets the team into the staff area. Kurtz uncovers emails between Hatvan and her supervisor about kicking a teenager named Thomas out of the library.

The agents then run into Jim Needles, the custodian. He is gruff and uncomfortable around the Agents, and they notice that he has prison tattoos. Jim mentions being out with his friend Perkins on the night of Hatvan’s murder, and says that Todd, the other custodian, was on duty that night.

Meanwhile, Buddy and Coswell interview Lefty, the homeless man from the library. He relates that he had been sleeping on a bench near the courtyard when he saw a dark shape about the size of a truck silently sweep over the city and drop something off with a gentle but audible plop on the trees. He thought he was dreaming, but later woke up to the sound of emergency vehicles. Buddy lets Lefty keep his FBI windbreaker, which has a small tracker surreptitiously placed in the seam.

The team reconvenes, and requests information about persons of interest from the FBI and Glenridge PD, who both promise it by the following morning. Kamaroff makes a point of arranging a meeting with Carson within a few days to report on their progress. They then pick up Chinese takeout in Oyster Bay, and retire to Kurtz’ house for the evening.

**October 21st**

*Morning*

The team wakes the following morning and heads to Dr. Maretti’s practice. Maretti’s two nurse hygienists, Daryl and Kim, are present, as is Dr. Jacobs, his young protege. All present a friendly, professional facade, but it's clear things are still strained in the wake of Maretti's demise.

Kurtz examines Maretti’s old office workstation, and notes a series of emails between Mr. Dengler and Dr. Maretti over a complicated and painful series of root canal surgeries on Mark’s son Thomas. Mark had been threatening legal action against Dr. Maretti prior to his murder, and Maretti was consulting with his own counsel. The Denglers live in northern Glenridge.

The FBI and Gregson PD both get back to the party with their records requests, and Schell and Kurtz head home to compile what they found and do additional research. Kamaroff, Coswell, and Buddy opt to head over to the Dengler home to investigate.

*Afternoon*

Schell and Kurtz put together what they have so far.

Needles, the janitor at the library, had a modest criminal record for assault and robbery when he was younger, but eventually turned his life around. Gregson maintains a healthy level of skepticism towards him but admits that he stays out of trouble. His friend, Perkins, is a gym teacher at the local high school. Todd, the other janitor, is relatively fresh out of high school. He's been working there a year and a half, and is otherwise unnoteworthy.

Searches of air traffic control data for the area reveal nothing that perfectly correlates with the location of the bodies. Kurtz also learns from searches of social media that the Denglers are upper middle class professionals and that they and their son seemingly have a happy family life. He also notes that Thomas Dengler had checked out a copy of Guns, Germs, and Steel from the local library on the day of Hatvan’s death.

Meanwhile, Schell, Buddy, and Kamaroff covertly surveil the Dengler home. They observe that there are no security cameras, and after knocking at the door, surmise that the occupants are either at school or work. They quietly pick the locks on the side door and garage and enter the home.

After spying the same copy of Guns on the coffee table, they head to Thomas’ bedroom and discover Wheeler’s folio. Not wanting to arouse suspicion, Kamaroff and Coswell take photos of all of the pages of the documents inside the folio and carefully replace them while Buddy stands watch. They make a clean getaway. Kamaroff suggests placing covert trail cams in the park and heads back to provide the data to Schell and Kurtz.

Kurtz, Kamaroff, and Schell go through the notes. They describe Derek Wheeler’s travels through South and Central America, as well as his knowledge of the Ai-Apa, a winged beast that would serve the war priests of certain indigenous cultures. They also include first hand historical accounts, some of which are in indigenous languages the team cannot read, others in English and Spanish, the latter of which Kurtz translates. They corroborate Wheeler's notes and accounts regarding the legend of the Ai-Apa.

Wheeler became obsessed with hunting for them, ruining his academic career and spending long periods in the region searching for the Ai-Apa. He eventually married an American embassy worker and moved back to the United States, dying in New York in the 1990s. His daughter is Eloise Dengler (nee’ Wheeler), and his grandson is Thomas Dengler.

*Evening*

Meanwhile, Buddy and Coswell purchase trail cameras at a sufficiently distant sporting goods store and return to the park after dusk. Following Coswell’s lead, they find suitable locations to discreetly place the cameras around the park.

Buddy manages to break or otherwise render unusable every single trail cam they have while attempting to emplace them. They are nearly discovered by a passing midnight toker, but manage to leave without incident. They return to Kurtz’ house, resplendent in failure, with conciliatory coffee and donuts.

Detective Gregson contacts the team close to midnight and informs them there's been an abduction at the Harrogate household near Peconic park on the southern end of town. The victim is Lauren Harrogate, an 18 year old high school senior, who lives with her single mother, Sandra.

The Agents pile into the vehicle (taking the food with them), and race back into town. They arrive at the house to find a chaotic scene. Emergency vehicles are everywhere, and the second floor balcony of the home has been completely destroyed. Gregson briefs them, and says that neighbors heard only a loud grinding crash and Lauren screaming for her mother.

Sandra is catatonic, huddled under a police blanket. Coswell quietly sings her a soft lullaby, and she mutters something about “a shadow taking \[Lauren\]”, while the rest of the team move into the house to investigate the crime scene. Lauren's room is a shambles, and the balcony and doorframe have been wrecked as if something impossibly strong had torn great chunks from it. They discover more grey substance and a small amount of blood, but it doesn't suggest that Lauren was killed there.

The party searches the room, and they locate what they assume is Lauren’s phone behind the bed. Kamaroff guesses the passcode successfully from the smudging on the screen. She conceals it after placing it in an evidence bag. They find nothing else of note at the scene, and race to the park in an attempt to save Lauren.

They arrive, ready for a fight, and wander around Peconic Park for several fruitless hours before returning to Kurtz' house at nearly 4:00am. They get a few hours of fitful, frustrated sleep.

**October 22nd**

*Morning*

Detective Gregson calls them in the morning to report that road workers have found Lauren’s body on an electrical pylon near the town on State Highway 21. The team heads over to the site and analyzes the remains with the help of a cherry picker.

Lauren’s body is laid carefully amidst the electrical workings of the pylon, and is in the same condition as Hatvan’s body, with a missing head and spine. While returning to their vehicles, they notice a pair of young people doing a livestream with the scene in the background. Schell snaps a photo of their faces and their van with his telephoto lens. The side of the van reads *Phenomen-X* in bright letters. They discuss what to do about this development while Kamaroff goes to meet with Carson.

Kamaroff meets him near a truck stop in northern Pennsylvania. Carson warns that another team operating under the auspices of an FBI investigation is heading to Glenridge, and will arrive there within 48 hours. He warns the Kamaroff to avoid the new team if possible. He emphasizes the continued need for discretion and that the threat must be eliminated and covered up quickly before the situation further deteriorates.

He acknowledges this may be difficult, and failing that, avoid giving away the mission at all costs. Kamaroff presses him, and Carson warns them of exceptionally grave consequences should a confrontation with these other Agents occur, but will not elaborate further. He promises to assist with the team’s findings regarding Wheeler and the Ai-Apa. Kamaroff is able to successfully request drugs and unmarked bills as part of a cover-up for the murders, as well as additional assistance with research into the case from whatever files Carson can requisition. Their meeting concluded, Kamaroff heads back to Glenridge.

The team returns to the house to plan their next move. The team goes through Lauren's phone and discovers evidence that Thomas Dengler had asked her out the night of the murders, and that Thomas had been rude to Lauren after she shot him down. They also find evidence that Lauren is having an affair with the high school gym teacher, Mr. Perkins. Kurtz also researches the Phenomen-X group they observed earlier. He does a bit of internet sleuthing and discovers that Thomas Dengler had used a YouTube account to flame the group’s latest livestream.

They consider next steps. Buddy will acquire gasoline and other materials for use against the creature, while Kamaroff will inform Detective Gregson and Dr. Santorini that they suspect a cartel killing and that the cartel may have a mole in the FBI. This provides a cover for the group’s investigations into the inbound FBI task force Carson warned them about.

They will tell them to provide assistance to the other team as necessary when they arrive but it will justify the party's surveillance of the other FBI team. Kamaroff also provides Lauren's phone to Gregson, and smooths over any concerns regarding a chain of custody of evidence.

The team suspects that Thomas Dengler is connected intimately to the murders, and that he may be controlling the Ai-Apa. They weigh out possible options, and suspect that the creature may be already on to them. They discuss what to do about Thomas, and discuss plans for using the boy to ambush the creature.

*Afternoon*

The group hypothesizes that the creature has an alien biochemistry that may be vulnerable to chemical attack. Since they suspect the creature is made in part of fluorine, Schell and Buddy opt to design and build several improvised sodium-based incendiary devices for use against the creature. It takes them the whole day and a portion of the evening, but they manage to successfully build four of the devices.

Kamaroff heads to the coroner’s office, and helps Santorini conduct an autopsy on Lauren’s body. Gregson arrives after being summoned by Kamaroff, and she and Santorini agree to discretely assist the team in their ostensible investigation of the other FBI team.

Meanwhile, Coswell and Kurtz do a bit of research and decide to investigate an ambush point on the campus of a partially demolished mental institution. The area seems an ideal place to lure and destroy the Ai-Apa, and they return to their vehicle. They are discovered by a security guard. He buys their cover and tells them there's a nightwatchman on the premises after dark. They take note of this and return to Kurtz house.

*Evening*

Buddy and Coswell opt to make a second attempt at emplacing trail cameras at the park and at the abandoned institution. In a stunning reversal of the prior evening, they successfully and stealthily emplace trail cameras at strategic locations throughout the area. As they are quietly walking back, they spot Wang from Phenomen-X livestreaming on the path.

As they’re watching, a dark shadow swoops in and carries Wang through the air. He scarcely has time to scream before being dragged over the beach and into the ocean. They make their way back to their vehicle and ride in stunned silence back to Kurtz’s house, where they relay the events to the rest of the group.

**October 23rd**

*Morning*

The next morning, the Agents head over to Glenridge High School to interview some of the students who knew Lauren. The staff assist the Agents and round up students who had known her. She was well-liked and intelligent, and had submitted promising applications to NYU and SUNY. The Agents get some of the students to talk about Thomas during their interviews. Some deride him and call him a loser, while others volunteer that they think he gets a bad rap from the other students for being passive and quiet. The Agents note that a lot of students seem to be missing from school today, including Thomas.

As the Agents leave, one of the students approaches them. She identifies herself as Janine and says she wants to talk specifically to Kamaroff. They go off by themselves, and Janine says that she was a close friend of Lauren’s, and that she has information for the investigation. She confirms the account of what happened between Thomas and Lauren that the agents discovered, and she furthermore confirms the relationship between Perkins and Lauren. Kamaroff thanks her and the Agents head off to Thomas’ house. 

*Afternoon*

After debating whether or not to kidnap Thomas in order to provoke the creature, cooler heads prevail and they instead opt to talk to the boy. Kamaroff and Coswell knock on the door while the rest of the team stands watch, and Mrs. Dengler answers. They identify themselves as FBI agents, and Mrs. Dengler invites them in. She calls Thomas, who comes downstairs to meet the Agents. He is a mousy looking boy with a swollen jaw, but otherwise unremarkable.

Coswell and Kamaroff speak to him in private. They ask him about the victims, starting with Lauren. He breaks down and admits to the incident where he was rude to her after being turned down with sincere regret. When asked about Hatvan, he says he was mad at her for singling him out when he was being harassed about but otherwise liked her, and Coswell surmises that he may have had a crush on her.

This steers the conversation towards his reading habits, and he freely acknowledges receiving his grandfather’s books and his newfound interest in history and archaeology. He clutches at his chest, and Coswell asks Thomas about it. Thomas reveals that his mom had given him his grandfather’s amulet on his 16th birthday on September 1st, 2014, and that it was his good luck charm.

The Agents chat with Thomas for a while longer and go to leave. As they’re making their way out of the house, Mrs. Dengler stops them. She politely but firmly asks them to take it easy on Thomas, who has been through a lot these past few weeks. They agree, and leave.

On the way back to Kurtz’ house, they stop to pick up Buddy’s windbreaker from Lefty, the homeless man who assisted them several days prior. He happily trades them back the windbreaker for a new Patagonia jacket and a 4-pack of PBR, which he shares with his compatriots.

*Evening*

By that evening the team is certain that the creature is by now aware of their intrusion, and they opt to take their gear and spend the night at an abandoned industrial facility as they identified it as a secondary ambush site. They fortify the building entrances and exits, and brace themselves for an attack as night falls. Sleeping in shifts, they stay up the entire night awaiting the creature’s arrival. They groggily watch as the sun rises with no sign of it anywhere.

**October 24th**

*Morning*

Deflated by failing to encounter the creature on their terms, the team opts to stop for food at a nearby Waffle House. Buddy and Coswell both spot a trio of black SUVs parked in the lot of the restaurant, and they both opt to drive to a Denny's further away to eat a sullen and nervous breakfast before returning to Kurtz’ place to clean up and plan their next move.

Coswell heads to the park and discreetly recovers the data from the trail cams, and witnesses four people of clearly military bearing with near-matching polos and khakis speed-walking through the park. He observes them silently before returning to base to inform the rest of the team.

Coswell and Kurtz go over the trail cam footage and get their first real look at the creature. Despite the washed-out infrared images, they can clearly note the creature’s size and prominent set of triple wings, as well as vaguely humanoid shape. Having both a clearer idea of the supernatural threat as well as their potential adversaries, the team opts to find a way to listen in on the latter.

*Afternoon*

Using Buddy’s military radio and some additional modifications, Buddy and Kurtz cobble together a system to monitor local encrypted radio traffic. They mount it inconspicuously to Buddy’s truck, which they will use as a surveillance vehicle. Buddy, Schell, and Kurtz head back into town to test the set-up out, while Kamaroff and Coswell remain close-by as back-up.

*Evening*

The system works, and Kurtz and Schell successfully intercept the communications bands the unknown agents are using. They recognize the parties’ lingo as military, and after listening a while, Buddy suggests that they may be Air Force, probably special forces.

The personnel seem to be escorting a VIP known as “Doc” and her entourage around town. The activity dies down around midnight, and the team regroups at Kurtz' house after getting some White Castle. They receive additional intelligence via a dead drop from Carson, and spend a few hours reading up on Derek Wheeler, Delta Green’s encounters with similar creatures, and additional cultural context for the legend of the Ai-Apa. While helpful context, none of it materially assists the Agents in solving the case. 

**October 25th**

*Morning*

After awaking the following morning, the team opts to continue surveilling the airmen’s radio channel, with Coswell, Kurtz, and Schell taking shifts manning the radio while the vehicle is hidden near the town. The team lays low with Kamaroff and Coswell nearby for support, and listens to the sound of the airmen shuttling Doc and her comrades around Glenridge.

*Afternoon*

During Coswell’s shift, he begins to get the impression the airmen aren't taking their task too seriously, very occasionally speculating on what they're doing in Glenridge despite having generally good radio discipline.

They nonetheless continue to dutifully move around town throughout the day, with the team continuing to monitor them as dusk approaches. The team remains hidden in their vehicles with their equipment ready to go, expecting a confrontation soon.

*Evening*

That evening, Thomas calls Kamaroff in a panic. He tells her that he’s being chased by bullies deep in the park, and that he doesn’t know what to do. He provides his position and promises to hide on the advice of Kamaroff, and the agents quickly gear up and rush over. As they speed to the park, Kurtz notes a sudden burst of frenzied activity on the Air Force band. They arrive at the park from the west, driving straight off the pavement. They dismount in time to see Thomas being beaten up by the bullies near the water's edge. They also observe the three black SUVs arriving from the northern end of the park.

The party moves towards Thomas, but it's too late to stop what's about to happen. The head bully finds Thomas’ necklace and rips it off his neck before smashing it under his heel. Thomas screams up at the sky for help. Several people emerge from the middle SUV and rush towards Thomas. The Ai-Apa answers his call, swooping out of the water in a shadowy blur and wedging itself between Thomas and the bullies. It stands erect with its full 12 meter wingspan unfurled, and lets out a horrendous howl. It surges forward and tears the stunned bullies to meaty shreds before anyone else can react.

The woman at the head of the group that emerged from the SUV produces a pistol and fires at the creature, landing a hit squarely on the side of its neck. It howls in pain and focuses its attention on her and her comrades. Kamaroff likewise rushes towards Thomas, opening fire on the creature with her handgun as Kurtz moves stealthily away to flank the creature. The rest of the team, wary of assisting the other group, hesitates briefly before opting to join the fight.

The Ai-Apa is surprised and enraged at the sudden resistance and swiftly shoots into the air. It turns its attention to the multitude of figures piling out of the SUVs and attempting to retrieve weapons from the trunks. Schell snaps photos of the creature and the other parties while Buddy and Coswell open up with their weapons, striking the creature and forcing it to jink wildly through the air to avoid their fire.

Kamaroff continues to run towards Thomas while the unknown agents continue to fire at the creature. Kamaroff calls out to him, but Thomas is too stunned to respond. Meanwhile, the Ai-Apa dives towards the airmen. It lands in the midst of a group of four of them, huddled around the open trunk of the last SUV.

With a lightning-fast flash of teeth and claws, it outright kills two of the group and critically wounds another. The final standing airman draws a knife and engages the creature in hand-to-hand combat. Kurtz, still undetected, gets close enough to toss his bomb at the creature, but he hesitates for fear of killing the wounded airmen. The Ai-Apa mutilates its remaining opponent with a swipe of its claws, and the airman plops to the ground, scrambling away in horror as the creature bears down on him.

Kamaroff finally reaches Thomas and convinces him to take her hand. The unknown woman, close-by at this point, scrunches her face in frustration at this before screaming at them to run. The pair flee back to the rest of the team while the Ai-Apa remains distracted. Further away, Schell doubles back to Buddy’s truck to bring it forward.

Buddy fires again and his rounds tear into the creature, wounding it further. The creature turns in his direction, ignoring the wounded airman for the moment. The rest of his comrades rally, and begin to open fire on the beast, driving it further back. Coswell, unable to get a clear shot from his position, breaks cover and moves to flank the creature.

Kurtz, still hidden close-by and sensing an opportunity, arms his sodium bomb. He winds back and hurls it at the Ai-Apa. It is far too flustered to notice as the bomb lands, clattering, at its feet. A moment later it explodes, showering the creature with burning metal. It bellows wretchedly in pain as the sodium fragments sizzle and crackle on its skin. Great streamers of white and grey smoke fill the air, and the Ai-Apa staggers, screaming wildly as it erupts in bright yellow flame.

The airmen get over their initial surprise and pull what’s left of their comrades to safety before the fumes and heat maul them further. Coswell stalks forward, raises his shotgun, and finishes off the Silent One with a slug round. It slumps to the ground lifelessly, still smoldering. It sits motionless for a moment before decomposing into a billowing puddle of caustic goo. This sears the sidewalk black and fills the air with an acrid chemical smell as it melts the tires and cracks the windows of the nearest SUV. The battle is won.

The Agents prepare to leave discreetly, but the woman, identified by the airmen as “Doc”, rushes forward and stops them. Kamaroff agrees to parlay and steps off to the side to speak with her. Doc, initially hesitant, allows Kamaroff to assist the airmen in providing life saving care to their injured comrades. Kamaroff stabilizes them, and the airmen are grateful for the assistance despite their shaken state. This provides a break in the tension between the two groups, who were previously beginning to eye one another warily. Coswell joins Kamaroff, and they speak with Doc and her companions while the rest of the team return to Buddy’s truck with Thomas.

Doc expresses awareness of the group’s mission and their ostensible employer. While Doc is not explicit in her language, Coswell gleans from their conversation that there are in essence two conspiracies calling themselves Delta Green, one operating in a more “official” capacity with a greater access to resources, and “cowboys” operating on the sly with minimal assets and sporadic oversight. A further flash of insight suggests to him that he and the rest of the Agents most likely report to the latter Delta Green.

Doc says that enough of a mess has been made of the situation, and, noting their unexpected cooperation and potential for more hostilities, offers a truce with the Agents. They compare notes, and agree on a general framework for a cover-up involving a series of cartel murders of local drug dealers and affiliates. Kamaroff turns Thomas over to Doc at the latter's insistence, with the Doc’s assurances that he will receive the best care she can provide. The Agents in turn receive the amulet fragments and Doc’s assurance that she will handle the heavy lifting on the cover-up with the Agent's materials, and handle any fallout from her superiors.

Doc and the two other Agents with her thank Kamaroff and Coswell for their assistance. They leave on a somewhat tense round of handshakes, and the agents return to Kurtz’ place to clean up, set up dead drops for the cover-up materials, and prepare a report for Carson.

**October 26th**

*Morning*

Kamaroff and Coswell meet with Carson and provide a detailed report of the events of the investigation, as well as the destroyed amulet. Carson is initially furious when he hears about their fraternization with Doc (“I told you to avoid them at all costs, not haggle with them!”), and the two Agents argue with him intensely over their decision to break bread with the Program, as he openly calls it in disgust.

Coswell pushes back, saying the situation had spiraled beyond their ability to contain on their own, and that a detente with the other Agents was the only way left to resolve the situation in a remotely discreet way. After all, Coswell continues, the creature and the amulet were both destroyed and the public remains unaware of the true nature of the killings.

Carson is still heated at this development but ultimately relents, conceding the Agents’ point and grumbling about having to explain this to *his* bosses. He grudgingly thanks the team for their ""barely adequate"" work on this case and tells them to lay low for a while and await further assignment. Coswell and Kamaroff depart to debrief the rest of the team.

A success? Sure, with heavy qualification.

***Notes:*** My players were presented with the choice of Outlaw or Program when we ran Last Things Last. One of them suggested I flip a coin on it and not tell them the result, which led to them being assigned to the Outlaws. I wasn't planning on telling them, but the addition of the CORAL NOMAD option in the vanilla scenario document was too entertaining to pass up, especially given their status.

They began to piece it together just prior to the final encounter with the monster, which I was proud of them for doing. I also thought them coming up with the idea for the sodium bombs was delightfully *Evolution.*

Like I said on the top of the other slice of this word sandwich, let my know what you think, especially if I've horrendously violated canon by having the Program and Outlaws team up by serendipity, haha.",9,1749431908.0,DeltaGreenRPG,0,1.0,False
