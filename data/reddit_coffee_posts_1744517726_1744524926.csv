I am very PC unsavvy, I only the very basics, so please bare with me. 

The message I got at first mentioned something about changing SATA to RAID (forgot to take a pic), then after consulting with chatGPT, I turned on CSM and got the message in my first pic.
Now upon restart/turning PC on it goes straight into UEFI BIOS.

I will continue asking Grok or chatGPT, but thought some of you may know a quicker way to solve this.
chatGPT sked me to check if the drive is loose or connected properly and yes it is, I haven't tinkered with the PC at all, since last turning it on a year ago.
Also, I noticed the time has been reset to year 2009, I updated it yesterday, but it was back to 2009 again today.

Let me know what information or pictures I need to provide, I honestly don't know what else to share, tysm for your time.

I‚Äôm finally in a place where I can buy my first espresso machine after years of wanting one, but I‚Äôm hitting some option paralysis.

I'm not a complete beginner to the world of espresso. I've never worked as a barista, I‚Äôve been around a lot of machines and folks who really know what they're doing. I mostly drink straight espresso, americanos, and lattes.

I‚Äôm planning on getting a DF64, which eats up some of my budget, so now I‚Äôm trying to decide what machine to pair it with. 

The biggest issue I'm facing is not wanting to feel the need to upgrade in a year. I could get the bambino and probably be happy for a little bit but I do really like the idea of something with some heft and power to it. I've found a really good deal on a Quick Mill Pippa and am leaning that direction but wanted to see if there was anything I'm missing or should be thinking about. If anyone has any advice or recommendations I am all ears. I'm so ready to stop looking at gear and start drinking some coffee. Thank you! ",1,1744524472.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Recognize this executive? She's Chief Administrative Officer, Matt Schroeder's Chief of Staff, and almost certainly a colossal waste of money. This is the corporate shill that recently lectured us about diversity and women's month all while the company was contemplating chapter 22.

Why the hell does our bumbling CEO even need a chief of staff? It's not like he's the president of a f\*\*\*king country or something. How many of our stores were told they can't even have an assistant manager anymore? Seems fair to me that Schroeder can prepare his own coffee and write his own damn notes. We ask many of our store managers to do much more than that on a daily basis as it is.

But where's that ""smaller and leaner"" mentality at the top?

Can our clown-car CEO not tie his shoes or type his own Spot messages about tough choices or admirable sacrifices without this diversity czar?

How much is this person drawing in salary?

Shit, while we‚Äôre at it, how much is SVP Chief Merchandising Officer Bryant Harris getting? Just a reminder that we still have almost no product to merchandise. Wouldn‚Äôt the salaries of these two unneeded consultants be better spent on a couple of pallets of product for our stores?

Come on! What the F\*\*K is the actual plan here, Schroeder? Was it just always your intention to bullshit everyone and string them all along while you and your inner circle desperately try to sell the company before clock strikes Chapter 22? For the record, selling the company wasn‚Äôt discussed at our last, distant, town hall.

And don‚Äôt try to convince us like you did in the recent spot message by implying nothing has changed and that a sale was always in the cards. I call bullshit. Despite you crying otherwise, \*plenty\* has changed.

Many stores are forced to open or close with just one employee on the front end. It‚Äôs not safe and it‚Äôs not smart. It‚Äôs even against policy, but it‚Äôs still happening because there‚Äôs simply no other choice. How‚Äôs that for smarter and leaner? FFS.

But hey, our teams will still do it! Maybe it‚Äôs because the few that are left genuinely love their stores or maybe it‚Äôs because Jessica Kazmaier wrote an uplifting message on The Spot about diversity. I‚Äôll let you all decide which one is more likely‚Ä¶

Meanwhile we watch Matt Schroeder and his group of windbags, who I refer to affectionately as Potato, Harpy, Igor, and \[sometimes\] Boots--fly from store to store. During these costly and often unneeded trips, they ask our teams how they are feeling.

How the fuck do you think they feel?! How about you fire Jessica, Bryant, and yourself and ship these stores a few more pallets of product instead?

While we‚Äôre at it, how about you do what someone else on here suggested and just get rid of more middle management like divisional leaders? Perhaps then the diversity czar could get directly involved with the regional leaders and not have to waste company time and money posting messages on the spot spouting useless trash.

And to everyone of us that‚Äôs pissed off because they actually LIKED the brand at one point and, like me, you‚Äôre convinced this company is truly going to die, what‚Äôs the harm and giving these sacks of deception a little noncompliance?

Something along the lines of ‚ÄúFuck you. You can open your own fucking pharmacy until you shed the unneeded hacks at the top and present to all of us an actual plan to put the company on a better path.‚Äù

Recently, I overheard a store manager on the phone with her mother expressing doubt and sorrow about her future with the company. Here is how she described her typical day at work to her mother:

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry ma‚Äôam but we don‚Äôt have any of the products you‚Äôre looking for. No we‚Äôre not closing! The product is coming I promise! Have you had your flu shot? Hey wait! Did you know COVID is on the rise? Ma‚Äôam? Hey! Come back!!‚Äù

Enough said.

PS: We're still awaiting your resignation. Please take the executives mentioned above with you.

**TL;DR : Executives useless. Waste of money and flesh. Make them resign now. Retail and pharmacy teams should consider putting foot down to end the executive honeymoon since there‚Äôs nothing to lose at this point. Sad ending- Matt Schroeder is Luke‚Äôs father.

1jy0xgb,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1jy0xgb/fragrances_i_love_and_ones_i_hate/,Fragrances I love and ones I hate,"Hi all! I'm new to the fragrance community. Years back I found my favorite fragrance by chance from a sephora sample, and I've been chasing to find my next favorite since then. It was Bvlgari the Roman Night which has since been discontinued :(

I've sort of started an addiction to buying samples from decant sites. So here are some of my favorites so far and some of my least favorites.

Faves:

Portrait of Lady by Fredric Malle - 10/10 amazing. Smells like flowers and incense. I've read some people find it too intense or ""old lady"" like, but I don't get that at all. If anything, I find it fairly mild compared to some of the white florals I've tried and loved. 

Oudgasm Vanilla Oud 36 by Kayali - 8.5/10. I love the scent but it's like I got smacked in the face with incense. I can see myself wearing it on rare occasions, but far from a daily scent. 

Blackberry and Bay by Jo Malone - 9.5/10. I want to give this one a 10/10 but it fades almost as soon as I apply it. Smells like picking berries when I was a kid. A very nostalgic very green scent. 

Jasmin Rouge by Tom Ford - 10/10 I love Jasmine scents and this one is THE Jasmine scent. Sweet, but not too sweet. I can wear this day or night, any season honestly. 

Black Opium by YSL - 8/10 this one grew on me. Sweeter than I'm used to. I don't get coffee from it at all - smells like candy to me. 

L'interdit Givenchy - 8/10 I adored this one initially, but then I couldn't help but notice the artifical bubblegum of the tuberose. Still a good scent if you ignore that. 

Fire At Will Jovoy Paris - 10/10 I didn't think I'd love a vanilla scent this much (I know there are 2 on this list, but this is a more pure vanilla to me) but this one?? This is it for me. Sweet, but not too sweet. Like vanilla frosting. 

Good Girl by Carolina Herrara - 8.5/10 not my typical vibe, but most of my favorite scents don't work too well for warmer weather and day time and this still carries the spirit of those without the heaviness. 

Euphoria Calvin Klein - 9/10. Longevity for me isn't great, but I love this scent. A little lighter and more playful than what I usually like, but great and wearable. 

Scents I don't like:

Initio Addictive Vibration - 4/10 Maybe this will grow on me, but upon first whiff I get the scent of that throat numbing spray medicine and black licorice. 

YSL Libre - 3/10 I can't really put my finger on why I dislike this so much. It almost smells... too clean? Too light, but also with this sort of sour-sweet note that I just can't do. It's just not my vibe.

Except Plant. He‚Äôs too cool.

So, you want to make your own Smash character? That‚Äôs adorable.

‚ÄúWaluigi?‚Äù you‚Äôre asked. 

‚ÄúDr. Eggman?‚Äù

‚ÄúRayman?‚Äù

No?

You smile. You say you want something more niche. Something obscure.  
You want a deep-cut from Nintendo history.

‚ÄúROB,‚Äù you whisper.

Silence.

The dev team looks around nervously. A single coffee mug shatters on the floor.

A chill enters the room.

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù they say. ‚ÄúSure. ROB. A little toy robot. How bad could this be?‚Äù

You had ideas. Terrible, unspeakable ideas.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs start with the tilts,‚Äù they suggest.

And you go, ‚ÄúYeah. So, I want the down tilt to come out on frame 3. Be +3 on shield. And let it combo into itself. Forever. Also, make it be the best ledgetrapping option ever.‚Äù

The devs stare at you. ‚ÄúOkay, what about forward tilt?‚Äù

‚ÄúSafe. Disjointed. Moves his entire body forward like he‚Äôs got beef.‚Äù

They gulp. ‚ÄúU-Up tilt?‚Äù

‚ÄúMake it anti-air. Make it fast. Make it combo into up air. Let it juggle for forty minutes.‚Äù

At this point, someone‚Äôs crying.

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù they stammer, ‚Äúsurely the smash attacks will be reasonable.‚Äù

‚ÄúForward smash,‚Äù you say, ‚Äúshould be a sword. Not look like a sword, just function like one. Give it range. Give it kill power. Disjoint so big Marth mains are crying.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy? He doesn‚Äôt even have arms!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, but he has lasers.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶And throws?‚Äù a voice trembles.

You smile wider.

‚ÄúGive him a kill throw. Make back throw delete stocks at ledge. And up throw can kill, just for fun. Give him a down throw that buries, but not like a real bury, just make it just long enough for a guaranteed up smash or up air at most percents.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶y-you‚Äôre designing a monster.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just getting started.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd specials?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I want a laser. A big one. Chargeable. Goes through other projectiles. Reflects off walls. Also make it unreactable at close range. Combos from down tilt.‚Äù

""Ok, that's reasonable. He at least has to charge this move-""

""No. I want it to charge automatically.""

They stare at you. You stare back. ""And make it frame six, while you're at it.""

‚Äú‚Ä¶Anything else?‚Äù

‚ÄúA spinning top. Hits like a truck. Sets up into everything. Controls the stage. Make it pick-up-able. Of course, it has to reflect projectiles as well.‚Äù

And just when they thought it couldn‚Äôt get worse-

""He should also have an item""

The Gyro.

Oh. The Gyro.

A spinning top.

It:

* Zones
* Edgeguards
* Starts combos
* Ends combos
* Controls neutral
* Reflects projectiles
* Leads to kill confirms

The devs are sweating now. ""What about-""

A smirk appears on your face. ""Give him zero-to-death combos with Gyro. And not hard ones like the Ice Climbers either. I mean easy, twenty minutes in training mode kinda combos.""

At this point, they aren't questioning your obvious insanity. ‚ÄúAnd aerials‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúNair should combo, kill, and stall his fall. Up air should kill off the top and combo. Down air should spike harder than your heartbeat after fighting ROB. Forward air should be fast, safe, and combo. Back air should be a wall.‚Äù

‚ÄúBUT WHAT‚ÄôS HIS WEAKNESS!?‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶he's a little tall?‚Äù

""You can't-""

""I'm not done! I want him to have the most egregious, most unfair recovery in the whole game.""

The devs freeze. ‚Äú‚Ä¶You mean, like, a teleport? A multi-jump? Something gimmicky with angles?‚Äù

You shake your head. ‚ÄúNo. I want jet fuel. I want him to fly. Like, actually fly. No hitbox, no vulnerability, just straight-up hover over the blast zone for eight full seconds like it‚Äôs a goddamn sightseeing tour.‚Äù

‚ÄúWh-eight? Eight seconds?!‚Äù

‚ÄúGive him angles. Let him weave in and out. Let him fake out edgeguards and then recover high, low, backwards, upside-down, on the other ledge if he wants. And if you do catch him? He‚Äôll just nair and drift away like nothing happened.‚Äù

Someone vomits into a trash can.

‚ÄúAnd when he finally lands? Let him ledgetrap with gyro and down tilt. Let him turn the corner of the stage into an unholy vortex where stocks go to die.‚Äù

One dev whispers, ‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs a toy‚Ä¶‚Äù

You lean in. ""And that's not all.""

They begged you to stop as you made him a heavy.

They pleaded as you made him fast on the air and ground.

They offered you other characters, cooler ones, more balanced ones. ""Crash Bandicoot! Shadow the Hedgehog! Please!""

But you didn‚Äôt want balance.

You didn‚Äôt want fairness.

You just wanted... ROB.

I practically get paid to play video games and do homework all night. At the same time, it‚Äôs also the most exhausting and degrading thing I‚Äôve ever experienced in my short 22 years of life.¬†

I entered the workforce at 16 with a neutral attitude towards people. I worked two front desk jobs, a sandwich shop, retail, and for DoorDash. I figured working for a hotel would be a walk in the park compared to my past endeavors. I hardly ever got to sit down when I worked retail. Despite my high expectations, training for the first and second shift was surprisingly difficult. I had to go home early on my second day because I was so tired and anxious, not to mention starving from the lack of lunch breaks allotted to front desk workers. You either have to DoorDash, get chips from the vending machine, or pack your own lunch which none of us have the energy to do.

With issues adjusting to the inconsistent sleep schedule came multiple intense psychotic breakdowns within my first month of employment. It felt like legit psychosis. When they offered me the full time position of night auditor, I jumped for joy. Perhaps I‚Äôd feel better if I was around less people. My boss sat with me and ‚Äútrained‚Äù me while I screwed around on my phone, waiting for guests to appear. The rest of the training was assigned via a website that neglected a good majority of basic how-to‚Äôs. For what felt like weeks, I dealt with 100% silent nights, except for the occasional scammer calling. It wasn‚Äôt until December of 2023 that things started getting rough.

It‚Äôs 11pm on Friday, December 15, 2023. I am blasted by a piercing wave of shouting and a whiff of cheap beer as the doors \*whoosh\* open. Children weave in and out of the lobby, destroying everything in their path. I have no idea what‚Äôs going on. The 2nd shift explains to me that we get teams every weekend, and sometimes they do this. I ask what I‚Äôm supposed to do. ‚ÄúJust clean up and put everything back when you‚Äôre done.‚Äù *Put everything back? What on earth would need to be put back?* People finally head back to their rooms around 2:45, and I open the dining room doors to my demise. The floor is littered in crumbs, trash can overflowing, tables and chairs rearranged into an impossible pattern. My heart drops along with my jaw. Surely it can't be this chaotic every weekend.¬†

Come mid-January, the weekends have been all the same. On top of the mess left by the sports parents, each shift my coworkers leave me with the parting gift of a full trash can and even more crumbs all over the back office. I tell my boss about this, and she addresses the situation with said co-worker, Bunny. An hour after arriving home from my shift, I receive a nasty text from Bunny about how I‚Äôm lazy and yada yada yada. I end up getting angry and calling her a fat \*redacted\* straight to my boss‚Äôs face. In other instances where my co-workers leave messes, my boss reminds me about the importance of teamwork.¬†

Meanwhile, my mental health is deteriorating from working every weekend with the sports parents. Not to mention the holidays too unless I request them off. I‚Äôve tried asking these people to quiet down and even screamed at them once or twice, but they always just laugh and continue to drink. I address the grown adults‚Äô outrageous behavior at a meeting, to which the sales manager responds ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre the only one that cares.‚Äù My boss follows up by telling me I don‚Äôt need complete quiet, and the parents pay for the use of the dining/meeting room. This makes no sense considering other guests are expected to pay $300 to rent out the meeting room for only a couple of hours.

Fast forward to the present day, the issues have yet to be addressed. Different groups of sports parents return each weekend, each exhibiting the same immature behavior as the last. Second shift is still leaving messes, but I don‚Äôt like to snitch. I fear that my boss is encouraging them to leave the messes for me because ‚Äúthird shift doesn‚Äôt do anything anyway.‚Äù On the other hand, the breakfast chef snitches on me every chance he gets. The coffee isn‚Äôt hot enough. There were a few crumbs left on the dining room floor. A chair wasn‚Äôt put back. He snitches, and my boss always says something to me. She‚Äôs encouraging the behavior.

I still don‚Äôt interact with many people on weeknights, but when I do, I dread every second of it. I hate the sound of the phone, the desk bell, suitcase wheels, small talk, all of it. Occasionally, I‚Äôll go through extensive measures to avoid guests. Telling walk-ins and inquiring callers that we‚Äôre full, going to the ‚Äúbathroom‚Äù the second the phone rings, ‚Äúforgetting‚Äù to take down my BRB sign,¬† or, if I‚Äôm making coffee, hastily retreating to the darkness of the kitchen the moment I see a guest approaching. Even guests hanging out in the lobby irks me. I wish the common areas had closing hours. I keep my happy ass parked in the back office unless someone rings the desk bell. My coworkers and I often hide the bell, as the very sound triggers an inexplicable rage in all of us.¬†

As I write, I nurse a headache from the sound of the phone ringing all night. It rang five times the whole night, which is five times too many. A guest requested that 12 paper receipts for separate rooms be slipped in an envelope under her door, but the printer was down. It goes down about once a week. My manager gave me a few techniques in hopes of fixing the printer, but after a while I just gave up. Hopefully she‚Äôll leave a bad review about how she didn‚Äôt get paper receipts and they‚Äôll finally fix the printer.

¬†All 12 of said rooms came down to the lobby around 4 am, cheerfully shouting small talk at each other across the lobby. This is the hour after I make the coffee, so I use that time to regroup. It puts me out of my groove when guests appear in the lobby before 6 am when breakfast opens. I‚Äôm not sure why. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm neurodivergent. I‚Äôm getting tested for autism soon. I‚Äôve always had issues respecting authority. Aside from DoorDash, I‚Äôve been fired from every job prior. Perhaps it just took the worst of customers to bring it out of me.

Every day, I try to bring myself to go out and greet people during the last hour of my shift. Yet something keeps me glued to my seat unless a guest approaches the desk. I don‚Äôt want to get up and pretend I‚Äôm happy to see you unless you truly need something. The receipts. Oh, those damn paper receipts. You‚Äôre telling me instead of two clicks on my end, an email on yours, and an earth-friendly transaction, I have to do eight clicks while you stand and drum your fingers impatiently? You think I‚Äôm not in a hurry to get you the hell out of my face?

¬†I took the third shift because I realized a week into the gig that I hated people.¬† The phone calls I took during the second shift were lethally draining, despite the guests being polite. A month later, it all hit me at once.¬† I had terrible baby fever when I started working here. Now I‚Äôm debating sterilization. I refuse to get on elevators with strangers or attend family events because I find the excessive small talk suffocating. They don‚Äôt even do anything wrong, I just dread their presence. Since I was 8 I had dreamed of becoming a real estate agent, and even took a few classes immediately after high school. Now I‚Äôm wondering if my lifelong dream is even worth all of that face-to-face interaction.

Alas, I stay because I love the free time I get at work. Is it worth it though? Is it worth being constantly angry and tired? All I do in my free time is sleep, rot in bed, or think about how much I hate my¬† job. I feel like no matter how loud I scream, my cries will never matter. Yet somehow, this is ‚Äúhaving it easy.‚Äù¬†

TLDR: Boss is dismissive of employee concerns. Other employees leave messes for me frequently. Sports parents have squashed my ambition to become a mother someday. Other guests are just generally draining, thus causing me to avoid any type of social interaction outside of work.",2,1744523602.0,hatemyjob,0,1.0,False

Adrian Vale‚Äôs hands trembled over his keyboard, his breath shallow. His heart pounded so loudly it drowned out the quiet hum of his apartment. He checked the equations again, line by line, desperately searching for an error. There had to be one‚Äîthere should be one. But there wasn‚Äôt.

He had done it. **He couldn‚Äôt poke holes in it.** He believed he had unified everything in the universe into his work‚Äîjust a few hundred pages. Every motion, every accident, every flicker of choice‚Äîcaptured. **He had found the fundamental equation of reality itself.**

It had started as late-night exercises, idle mathematical explorations that he toyed with after his departmental work. He had no grand expectations‚Äîjust the simple joy of playing with numbers. Then, one night, he had stumbled upon something strange. An elegant symmetry in a differential equation governing motion. A relation between probability waves and gravitational warping that shouldn‚Äôt have existed. He followed the thread, pulling at it night after night, the equations growing denser, deeper‚Äîuntil, at last, he saw it. **The God's Will Equation.**

The final word on physics. The ultimate unification.

He imagined how the world would react‚Äîhow it **should** react. A Nobel Prize? A fundamental rewriting of physics? A new golden age? He saw his name etched in history beside Einstein, Newton, and Feynman. **He had solved the riddle of existence.**

He couldn‚Äôt sleep that night. At dawn, eyes bloodshot, he ran downstairs and burst into the kitchen where his wife was making breakfast. He rambled breathlessly, words spilling out faster than she could comprehend. Something about spacetime curvature folding into probabilistic matrices, about constants that weren‚Äôt constant, about an equation that whispered the shape of destiny itself.

She smiled patiently at first. But as he frantically gestured, drawing on napkins and talking of the end of randomness, her smile faded into concern. Still, Adrian was undeterred. **This was too big.**

He published immediately. He uploaded a preprint. He sent copies to former mentors, current colleagues, even prominent physicists he‚Äôd never met. He attended colloquiums, not to listen, but to corner speakers and insist they look at his work.

He marked his calendar: a Nobel by next year. Or maybe a Fields. Or the Turing, for good measure. He bought a bottle of champagne, tucked away for the announcement. **He counted the days.**

But reality did not care for his dreams.

His colleagues dismissed his findings. The first responses were polite skepticism‚Äîconstructive critiques. His advisor, a man he had admired since his student days, tried to let him down gently. ‚ÄúAdrian, you‚Äôve always had a brilliant mind, but this‚Ä¶ this is just rambling in mathematical notation.‚Äù

Adrian stood before his department, equations scrawled across the board, eyes blazing. **They challenged him.**

‚ÄúIf this really predicts everything,‚Äù one physicist asked, ‚Äúthen tell me what I‚Äôll say next.‚Äù

Adrian flinched. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not how it works. The data‚Äîthere‚Äôs not enough resolution in real time to‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre claiming determinism. Total, universal determinism,‚Äù another interrupted. ‚ÄúSo predict this coin toss. Or the next presidential election.‚Äù

‚ÄúChaos exists,‚Äù Adrian said. ‚ÄúInitial conditions are unknowable with perfect precision in many real-time systems. I would need more data than is available. That doesn‚Äôt mean the framework is wrong.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat about black swans?‚Äù asked a statistician. ‚ÄúEvents that lie outside any model‚Äôs prediction because there‚Äôs no precedent?‚Äù

Adrian tried to explain. ‚ÄúThe theory maps what *can* be determined from what *is*. It doesn‚Äôt conjure knowledge from absence. It isn‚Äôt prophecy‚Äîit‚Äôs law.‚Äù

His words fell flat.

Every answer he gave raised more doubts. Every attempt to clarify deepened the skepticism. His inability to provide a satisfying test case was taken as proof of fraud or delusion.

The whispers grew louder. His emails went unanswered. Students avoided his lectures. **The world had turned its back on him.**

Then came the psychiatric evaluation.

The university claimed concern for his well-being. His funding was pulled. His office was quietly reassigned. One day, he came home to find his wife waiting for him at the door, her expression tired, defeated.

‚ÄúAdrian,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this anymore.‚Äù

She begged him to step away, to come back to reality. He refused. **His work was reality.** She packed her bags, took the kids, and left. He watched her car disappear down the street and felt nothing. Not yet.

He tried to visit his children. His son hesitated at the door. His daughter barely looked at him. His wife had moved on. He had been **replaced.**

Then, finally, the walls of the psychiatric facility. The sterile rooms, the murmurs of the doctors. He stared at the ceiling, **questioning everything.**

What if they were right? What if he was insane? **What if his grand theory was nothing more than a beautiful delusion?**

He walked the halls in silence. Some days he was lucid. Others he spoke aloud to himself, writing symbols in the air with his finger. The doctors watched, puzzled. His notebooks were taken. His charts, confiscated. He begged for just one file, one fragment to reconstruct‚Äîbut there was nothing.

He sank into despair.

**How do you prove truth when the language to express it does not yet exist?**

But then, clarity struck.

His equation had predicted everything. The rejection. The ridicule. The institutionalization. Every event had been inevitable. He ran the simulation further‚Äî**the world did not change.** His work, lost to time, buried under the weight of human ego.

But then, he adjusted the parameters. He let the simulation run centuries forward.

A golden age. A future where energy, medicine, even space-time itself had been rewritten by the principles embedded in his work. **But he was forgotten.** His name erased from history, his sacrifices unrecognized.

He then tweaked the parameters to run the equation again. What would happen if he never revealed his work? He stared impatiently at his laptop, waiting for an answer.

Inconclusive. A true black swan. Not enough is known about the world to converge.

He was back in his kitchen. The smell of coffee. The soft clatter of plates. His wife humming as she made breakfast.

She turned to him. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre up early.‚Äù

He looked at her, truly looked at her. The warmth, the familiarity. The life he could still have.

The cursor blinked.

He hovered between worlds.

Should he tell her? Or stay silent?

Should he suffer for the betterment of the world‚Äîor should the world suffer for its ignorance?

Threads in the Dark

Science keeps finding new strands in the web:

Ants build colonies that behave like superorganisms, their collective intelligence emerging from countless tiny interactions.

Forests communicate through fungal networks, sharing nutrients and warnings across species.

Quantum particles defy distance, spinning in instant sync even when separated by light-years‚Äîa phenomenon Einstein called ""spooky action at a distance.""


Funny how the oldest spiritual traditions knew this first. The Buddhist concept of pratƒ´tyasamutpƒÅda (dependent origination) insists all things arise together. Indigenous cosmologies describe rivers and mountains as relatives, not resources. Even Western science, once obsessed with reducing the world to isolated parts, now studies systems: ecosystems, neural networks, economies. Because the cracks in our old worldview can‚Äôt be ignored anymore.



The Double-Edged Network

Modern technology didn‚Äôt create interconnectedness‚Äîit just made it impossible to ignore. Consider:

A meme born in a basement can topple governments.

A bank collapse in Zurich starves families in Zambia.

Your Amazon habit melts glaciers while funding space tourism.


The web giveth (instant global collaboration, unprecedented access to knowledge) and the web taketh away (viral disinformation, supply chain domino effects). We built hyperconnection without understanding the first thing about balance. Like giving a chainsaw to a toddler.



Tugging on the Web

Here‚Äôs the uncomfortable part: every action does ripple. But most ripples get lost in the noise. To actually steer this ship, we‚Äôd need to:

1. Spot the leverage points‚Äîlike redesigning social media algorithms to reward nuance over outrage.


2. Break the addiction to simple stories‚Äîno, that political crisis isn‚Äôt about one villain; it‚Äôs about 200 years of tangled history.


3. Listen to systems thinkers‚Äîthe unsung heroes mapping how climate change, capitalism, and culture actually interact.





A Thought Experiment

Next time you‚Äôre stuck in traffic, consider:

The gasoline in your tank began as ancient plankton, now funding regimes and wars.

The asphalt beneath you contains bitumen shipped from Venezuela‚Äôs collapsing economy.

The podcast you‚Äôre listening to was edited by someone in Manila, paid less than your hourly parking fee.


This isn‚Äôt guilt-tripping. It‚Äôs pattern recognition. And patterns are power.

It was a cozy place, all exposed brick and mismatched armchairs, a far cry from my usual sterile, modern haunt. I approached the counter, ready to order my usual black coffee, when the woman behind it looked up and beamed.

‚ÄúHey, Liam! Long time no see! The usual?‚Äù

My name. How did she know my name? I‚Äôd never seen her before in my life. She was petite, with vibrant purple hair pulled back in a messy bun and a constellation of silver rings adorning her fingers.

‚ÄúUh, hi,‚Äù I said, a knot of confusion tightening in my stomach. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve met. How do you know my name?‚Äù

Her smile faltered, replaced by a look of genuine surprise. ‚ÄúLiam, it‚Äôs me. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ all of us. You know?‚Äù She gestured vaguely around the empty shop. ‚ÄúEveryone knows.‚Äù

I blinked, trying to process her words. ‚ÄúEveryone knows what?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat we‚Äôre you,‚Äù she said, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all you, Liam. How could you forget?‚Äù

I laughed, a nervous, incredulous sound. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs impossible.‚Äù

She just tilted her head, her purple strands catching the soft morning light. ‚ÄúIs it? Think about it. Doesn‚Äôt it‚Ä¶ feel right?‚Äù

I glanced at another employee, a young man wiping down the counter. ‚ÄúHey, do you know who I am?‚Äù I asked him.

He looked up, a serene smile on his face. ‚ÄúOf course, Liam. We all do. We‚Äôre all you.‚Äù

I paid for my coffee, my hands trembling slightly, and practically fled the shop. The coffee tasted bitter, like ash in my mouth. The walk to work was a blur of bewildered thoughts. Had I gone crazy? Was this some elaborate prank?

I burst into my boss, Mr. Henderson‚Äôs, office, ready to share the bizarre encounter, expecting a shared laugh at some quirky barista. ‚ÄúMr. Henderson, you won‚Äôt believe what just happened‚Ä¶‚Äù

He looked up from his paperwork, a warm smile spreading across his face. ‚ÄúAh, Liam. Good morning. Did you sleep well? You seemed a little‚Ä¶ out of it yesterday.‚Äù

‚ÄúOut of it? No, I‚Ä¶ I went to this new coffee shop, and the woman there, she knew my name, and she said‚Ä¶ she said she was me. And the other employee too! They all said they were me!‚Äù I waited for the punchline, the shared amusement.

Mr. Henderson‚Äôs smile didn‚Äôt waver. ‚ÄúWell, of course, Liam. We all are. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ fundamental, isn‚Äôt it? Surprised you‚Äôre just realizing it now.‚Äù

My blood ran cold. He wasn‚Äôt joking. He genuinely believed it.

The day crawled by, each interaction a surreal echo of the morning. My colleagues greeted me with knowing smiles, their eyes holding an unsettling familiarity. Every conversation circled back to the same baffling truth: they were me.

That evening, fueled by a desperate need for answers, for escape, I booked a last-minute flight. If this was some localized madness, a shared delusion, then surely a change of scenery would break the spell. I liquidated my savings, the numbers on the screen feeling strangely insignificant, and boarded a plane to London.

Stepping onto the cobbled streets of London felt like entering another world, yet the feeling of wrongness persisted. The customs officer who checked my passport greeted me by name, a conspiratorial wink in his eye. The taxi driver launched into a conversation about my preferences, things no stranger could possibly know.

In a dimly lit pub, nursing a pint of ale, I found myself drawn to an elderly woman sitting alone in a corner. Her eyes were sharp and unsettlingly knowing. I took a deep breath and told her my story, the words tumbling out in a desperate rush.

She listened patiently, her gaze unwavering. When I finished, she nodded slowly. ‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre finally waking up, are you?‚Äù Her voice was raspy, like dry leaves rustling.

‚ÄúWaking up to what?‚Äù I pleaded. ‚ÄúThis‚Ä¶ this can‚Äôt be real.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, but it is, dear boy,‚Äù she said, her lips curving into a faint, unsettling smile. ‚ÄúYou are the only real consciousness in this universe. Everyone else‚Ä¶ we are all constructs. Projections of your mind, existing solely for you to perceive.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs insane,‚Äù I whispered, the ale suddenly turning sour in my stomach.

‚ÄúIs it?‚Äù she countered. ‚ÄúThink about it. Have you ever truly known the inner thoughts of another? Felt their independent existence as vividly as your own? We are reflections, Liam. Echoes in your grand, solitary play.‚Äù

The implications were staggering, terrifying. If I was the only real person‚Ä¶ then nothing else truly mattered.

Shaken to my core, I stumbled out of the pub and into a rental car. My thoughts were a chaotic storm. The rain slicked the unfamiliar roads, the headlights cutting through the darkness. Distracted, lost in the horrifying reality of my solipsistic existence, I didn‚Äôt see the pedestrian until it was too late.

The sickening thud, the screech of tires, the horrifying realization of what I had done. I scrambled out of the car, my heart pounding in my chest. A young man lay motionless on the wet asphalt.

Sirens wailed in the distance. When the police arrived, their faces were grim. But as they approached me, their expressions softened with recognition.

‚ÄúLiam,‚Äù one of them said, his voice surprisingly gentle. ‚ÄúTerrible accident.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I killed him,‚Äù I stammered, pointing at the lifeless figure. ‚ÄúYou have to arrest me.‚Äù

The officer exchanged a look with his partner. ‚ÄúArrest you, Liam? But‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre you. Why would we arrest ourselves?‚Äù

A wave of nausea washed over me. There were no consequences. Nothing mattered.

The next few weeks were a descent into a terrifying freedom. I walked into banks, demanding money, my face uncovered. The tellers smiled sadly and handed over the cash. The police who arrived simply shook their heads and let me walk away.

The moral compass that had guided my life shattered. If no one else was truly real, what did it matter what I did? I started small, petty thefts, but the lack of consequence was a chilling invitation.

Soon, petty theft wasn‚Äôt enough. I wanted to test the limits, to see just how far this terrifying reality extended. I committed murder. The act was brutal, gruesome, and the faces of the victims‚Ä¶ they were my own, contorted in fear and pain. The police arrived, saw me, and simply turned away.

The weight of my actions, or rather the lack thereof, was crushing. The world had become a grotesque stage play, populated by my own unfeeling projections. I was a monster in a world of mirrors.

Finally, a bleak and terrifying thought took root. What would happen if I ceased to perceive? What would happen if I ended my own consciousness?

In a dingy hotel room, overlooking the indifferent cityscape of London, I made the irreversible decision. The world around me swam, the faces of the countless ‚Äúme‚Äùs I had encountered flashing before my eyes. Then, darkness.

But it wasn‚Äôt the end.

I gasped, jolting awake in a sweat-soaked bed. The air was thick with the smell of dust and something vaguely floral. The room was dimly lit by the soft glow of a gas lamp. The wallpaper was patterned with faded roses.

Disoriented, I sat up and looked around. This wasn‚Äôt my London hotel room. This wasn‚Äôt even my apartment back home. The furniture was antique, heavy and ornate. Through the window, I could see a dusty street lined with horse-drawn carriages and people in long skirts and bowler hats.

A woman entered the room, her hair piled high in elaborate curls. She smiled warmly. ‚ÄúGood morning, darlin‚Äô. Slept well?‚Äù Her accent was thick, Southern.

‚ÄúWhere‚Ä¶ where am I?‚Äù I stammered.

‚ÄúWhy, you‚Äôre in Galveston, Texas, sugar. It‚Äôs 1925. You don‚Äôt remember?‚Äù

I stared at her, my mind reeling. Texas? 1925? This had to be another dream, another facet of the solipsistic nightmare.

But as the days turned into weeks, and the weeks into months, a strange sense of normalcy began to settle in. The people I met had their own distinct personalities, their own inner lives that felt undeniably real. They argued, they laughed, they grieved. They didn‚Äôt look at me with that unsettling knowingness. They didn‚Äôt say they were me.

The world felt solid again, the consequences of actions tangible. I got a job, made friends, even started to fall in love. The horror of London, the terrifying realization of solipsism, felt like a distant, fading nightmare.

Had I truly woken up? Was this another layer of the dream? Or had the universe, in its infinite branches, finally offered me an escape from the suffocating prison of my own mind? I didn‚Äôt know. But for the first time in a long time, I felt a flicker of hope. And in 1920s Texas, I began to live again, cautiously, tentatively, in a world that finally felt like it existed beyond the confines of my own consciousness.",1,1744521631.0,u_Best-Bonus-4525,0,1.0,False

You wake up. Check your phone‚Äîa device built from minerals mined across three continents, assembled by workers in another, powered by algorithms designed by someone you‚Äôll never meet. The coffee you drink? Grown under a warming sky, its price dictated by speculative markets halfway around the world. Before you‚Äôve even tied your shoes, you‚Äôre already participating in a planetary-scale network older than civilization itself.

This isn‚Äôt metaphor. It‚Äôs physics. Philosophy. Biology. The hard truth humming beneath the surface of daily life: nothing exists in isolation. Not you. Not that tree outside your window. Not even the atoms in your bones.



Threads in the Dark

Science keeps finding new strands in the web:

Ants build colonies that behave like superorganisms, their collective intelligence emerging from countless tiny interactions.

Forests communicate through fungal networks, sharing nutrients and warnings across species.

Quantum particles defy distance, spinning in instant sync even when separated by light-years‚Äîa phenomenon Einstein called ""spooky action at a distance.""


Funny how the oldest spiritual traditions knew this first. The Buddhist concept of pratƒ´tyasamutpƒÅda (dependent origination) insists all things arise together. Indigenous cosmologies describe rivers and mountains as relatives, not resources. Even Western science, once obsessed with reducing the world to isolated parts, now studies systems: ecosystems, neural networks, economies. Because the cracks in our old worldview can‚Äôt be ignored anymore.



The Double-Edged Network

Modern technology didn‚Äôt create interconnectedness‚Äîit just made it impossible to ignore. Consider:

A meme born in a basement can topple governments.

A bank collapse in Zurich starves families in Zambia.

Your Amazon habit melts glaciers while funding space tourism.


The web giveth (instant global collaboration, unprecedented access to knowledge) and the web taketh away (viral disinformation, supply chain domino effects). We built hyperconnection without understanding the first thing about balance. Like giving a chainsaw to a toddler.



Tugging on the Web

Here‚Äôs the uncomfortable part: every action does ripple. But most ripples get lost in the noise. To actually steer this ship, we‚Äôd need to:

1. Spot the leverage points‚Äîlike redesigning social media algorithms to reward nuance over outrage.


2. Break the addiction to simple stories‚Äîno, that political crisis isn‚Äôt about one villain; it‚Äôs about 200 years of tangled history.


3. Listen to systems thinkers‚Äîthe unsung heroes mapping how climate change, capitalism, and culture actually interact.





A Thought Experiment

Next time you‚Äôre stuck in traffic, consider:

The gasoline in your tank began as ancient plankton, now funding regimes and wars.

The asphalt beneath you contains bitumen shipped from Venezuela‚Äôs collapsing economy.

The podcast you‚Äôre listening to was edited by someone in Manila, paid less than your hourly parking fee.


This isn‚Äôt guilt-tripping. It‚Äôs pattern recognition. And patterns are power.



So‚Äîwhat thread will you pull on today?

(Drop your wildest examples of unexpected connections below. I‚Äôll start: Did you know the Great Depression altered marriage patterns in rural Mongolia? True story.)

Prologue: The God of the Void

There were things beyond existence. Concepts that stretched past the furthest reaches of thought, past the limits of anything that was. And beyond those limits, there was the Void.

It was not a place. It was not a state. It was the finish line‚Äîthe end. That which swallowed everything and left nothing. And at the center of this endless nothingness, there was a being.

The God of the Void. The End of All Things. The Ultimate Nullifier.

And yet, despite being an all-encompassing, absolute being, he was‚Ä¶ impressed.

Humans‚Äîthose little fragile creatures‚Äîhad spent their short, fleeting existences grasping at knowledge, pushing past boundaries, reaching. They had touched upon concepts that even the lower gods struggled to comprehend. They had even started forming ideas that hinted at the nature of the Void itself.

They would never truly understand it. Not completely. But they would get close.

That realization made the God of the Void feel something strange. Not annoyance, not fear. It was something else. Pride.

So, on a whim‚Äîbecause that's all it really took‚Äîhe decided to do something no god before him had ever dared.

He would experience humanity firsthand.

He would reincarnate.

And so, the God of the Void became Kairos. A name given, not taken. A man, not a concept. A being, not an end.

Unfortunately, the moment he became, the universe decided to throw him into the worst possible place imaginable.

Site-19, SCP Foundation

Emergency Containment Procedures Initiated.

Unidentified Entity Manifested in Corridor B-12.

All available units, respond immediately.

Kairos blinked. One second, he had just‚Ä¶ existed. The next, he was standing in a stark, metallic hallway. Dim red lights flickered overhead, alarms blaring, as at least twelve men in body armor aimed rifles directly at his face.

""Hands up! Get on the ground!"" one of the guards barked.

Kairos let out a slow breath, rolling his shoulders. ""Ah‚Ä¶ great. So this is how humanity welcomes visitors, huh?"" He sighed, raising his hands lazily. ""Alright, alright. No need to freak out. I'm unarmed. Just your friendly neighborhood, uh‚Ä¶ anomaly?""

One of the guards muttered something into a radio. ""Command, we have a humanoid anomaly. No immediate hostilities, but uncooperative.""

""I literally just said I‚Äôd cooperate,"" Kairos muttered under his breath.

The guard turned back to him. ""You're coming with us. Move.""

Kairos shrugged. ""Lead the way, Captain Hardass.""


---

Interrogation Room - Site-19

Kairos was shoved into a cold, featureless room with a single table and two chairs. The door slammed shut behind him, locking with a heavy clang.

""Man,"" he muttered, rubbing his wrists. ""I feel so welcomed already.""

A few minutes later, three junior researchers entered, clipboards in hand, their expressions a mix of curiosity and caution.

""State your name,"" one of them said.

""Kairos."" He leaned back in the chair, crossing his arms. ""No last name. No middle name. Just Kairos.""

The researchers scribbled something down.

""Age?""

""Twenty-four. Physically, at least. Mentally? Eh‚Ä¶ infinity's a hard number to pin down.""

More scribbling.

""And what are you, exactly?""

Kairos smirked. ""Oh, I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ God of the Void? The End of All Things? The finish line that nothing can cross?"" He made a little waving gesture with his fingers. ""That last one has a nice ring to it, don‚Äôt you think?""

The researchers stared at him. Then, in unison, they wrote something down.

""Possible delusions of grandeur.""

Kairos rolled his eyes. ""Oh, come on. You people study reality-breaking nightmares and unholy abominations, but the second a guy claims to be a god, it‚Äôs delusions? Tough crowd.""

One of the researchers muttered, ""We should contact senior personnel.""

Enter the Mad Scientists

An hour later, three new figures walked into the room. Three of the most infamous minds in the SCP Foundation.

Dr. Jack Bright. Immortal madman. Legendary troll. Wearing his usual amulet and a grin that said, I could cause so much chaos right now.

Dr. Alto Clef. The wildcard. Ex-GOC, part-time reality-bender, full-time asshole. Carrying a ukulele for no goddamn reason.

Dr. Kondraki. Photographer, bug enjoyer, possible war criminal. Coolest guy in the room, but also the most likely to get them all killed.

Kairos raised an eyebrow as they took their seats. ""Huh. Now, you three look like fun.""

Bright smirked. ""We get that a lot.""

Clef strummed his ukulele. Horribly.

""So,"" Kondraki started, ""You claim you're the God of the Void.""

""Yup.""

""The end of all things.""

""Mhmm.""

""And you‚Ä¶ just happened to appear in the middle of Site-19?""

Kairos spread his hands. ""Hey, I‚Äôm as confused as you are. I was just chilling, doing my whole 'godly contemplation' thing, and boom‚Äîhuman form, middle of a high-security paranormal prison. Not exactly my first choice for a vacation spot, but here we are.""

The three scientists exchanged glances.

Clef turned to Bright. ""I give him a seven out of ten. Good delivery, but the whole 'void god' shtick is kinda overplayed.""

Bright nodded. ""Agreed. We've got, like, three other reality-bending humanoids claiming to be gods.""

Kairos snorted. ""Yeah? And how many of them actually are?""

Silence.

Kairos leaned forward, his grin fading slightly. His presence shifted, something vast and unfathomable pressing against the edges of reality. The walls of the room seemed to pull away, the lights flickering.

""See, gentlemen,"" he said softly. ""The difference between them and me?""

The room went dark.

""They pretend.""

A slow, creeping cold filled the air.

""I am.""

And then‚Äîjust as suddenly as it came‚Äîthe pressure vanished. The lights flickered back on. The three scientists sat still, unmoving.

Clef let out a slow breath. ""‚Ä¶Well, shit.""

Kondraki rubbed his temples. ""Bright, why the hell do we always get the weirdest ones?""

Bright chuckled. ""Job security.""

Clef shook his head and looked back at Kairos. ""Alright, Void Boy. You‚Äôve got our attention. What now?""

Kairos leaned back, stretching. ""Honestly? I was hoping for a cup of coffee. Cream, no sugar.""

Clef snorted. ""Yeah, not happening.""

Kairos sighed. ""Man‚Ä¶ you bastards are a tough crowd.""

O5 Council Decision

Three hours later, a secure encrypted meeting was held. The O5 Council, the highest authority in the SCP Foundation, reviewed the case of the ""humanoid anomaly claiming to be a god.""

""Another one?"" O5-4 muttered. ""That makes, what, the hundredth self-proclaimed deity this year?""

O5-7 sighed. ""At least he's polite.""

O5-1, the highest authority, spoke. ""We need to classify him.""

O5-3 tapped a pen against the table. ""We don‚Äôt know what he is. He exists, but we don‚Äôt have any data on his abilities.""

O5-12 leaned forward. ""We can't contain him, because we don't know what needs to be contained.""

O5-6 crossed his arms. ""We can‚Äôt just let him go, either.""

Silence.

Then O5-1 said, ""Then we classify him as Undefined.""

Murmurs.

O5-5 frowned. ""Undefined?""

O5-1 nodded. ""He will be designated as an SCP with no documentation, no item number, no object class. No files will be written about him, no records will be stored.""

O5-10 smirked. ""A ghost in the system.""

O5-1 exhaled. ""For now.""


---

Back at Site-19

Kairos yawned, leaning back in his chair as Bright returned with the verdict.

""Good news,"" Bright said. ""You're an SCP now.""

Kairos raised an eyebrow. ""Oh? What‚Äôs my object class?""

""Undefined.""

""Item number?""

""Undefined.""

""Nickname?""

""Undefined.""

Kairos blinked. ""So‚Ä¶ basically, I‚Äôm an SCP, but I don‚Äôt officially exist?""

""Pretty much.""

Kairos let out a low whistle. ""Damn. You guys really don‚Äôt know what to do with me, huh?""

Clef smirked. ""Nope.""

Panick attacked and a stranger. Story telling.,"I have been struggling with anxiety and depression for a long time. Today, I decided to go out with my boyfriend after I have been depressed and anxious for a week. My boyfriend got his dream job and we were so happy to celebrate his success. We went out to eat sushi. After that, we went to go shopping to prepare for his first day of work with nice shoes and clothes. We were looking around the shopping mall for few mins and I wanted to go another stores and we were apart. When I was about to shop at another store , I noticed I don't have my phone anymore with me. My anxiety kicked in right away and I went to the same place where my boyfriend was but he was no longer there. I run back and forth to find him, I started feeling panick after running for an hour but still don't see him. 

I went to the entrance again and I decided to sit somewhere near the entrance. I didn't know what to do, I don't remember anything nor do anything properly. There was an old man sitting near me, I asked him for help if he could call my phone number. He tried but still nobody answered. Then, we started chit chatting,

I asked "" Are you alone?"" 
He said "" Yes, I am""
I asked "" Do you have family?""
He said "" Yes, I did. I had my wife but she passed away 2 years ago""
I said "" I am sorry for your loss, Do you have children ""
He said "" No, my wife couldn't have child, so I didn't have any. I am alone since she passed away. I am so happy that you talked to me because I am bored alone. I want to talk to somebody and I am happy talking with you now. It is even better if your boyfriend still can't find you so I can talk with you longer""

I started feeling happy and not really nervous anymore. He offered me to have a coffee, I denied in the beginning. when we were about  to have a cup of coffee , my boyfriend found me. Then, I introduced him with my boyfriend and I offered him that I would buy a coffee for him if he still wanna drink. But he decided to go back home after saying goodbye to me and boyfriend. 

He calmed me down and I found out he wasn't lyimg to me that he is a phycologist. He studied psychology and worked as a teacher at local universities. I wish I would have talked to him a bit longer. ",1,1744521262.0,Anxietyhelp,1,1.0,False

I have no skill in interior design, but i also love it and love reading about it. It just doesnt come naturally to me i dont think! 

I would love opinions on the following:

* Which colour dining table should i go for? Personally I am leaning towards a walnut dining table (pictured in option 1). I love the contrast against the warm oak wood flooring, however I am then struggling to see how the rest of it falls into place eg dining chairs, bar stools, coffee table etc
* I dont like the matchy matchy look - however where do I draw the line. what SHOULD be matching? eg should dining chairs and bar stools be from the same family? 
* Couches - i will be buying 2 x couches. Should these match, or would you opt for a different colour/style couch?
* I have no idea where to start re coffee table, side tables or console.. HALLLPPP

Other things to note: 

* The whole house is currently painted grey internally. this is not my favourite, however we have agreed not to make any big changes before living in the home for a while, so for now its staying. 
* The pictures of the actual rooms are how the real estate listing had it styled. i have included a floor plan based on what size furniture i am looking at for the space. 
* The only furniture i actually own so far in the pictures is the black and rattan TV unit. 
* I am usually drawn to orange, greens, rust - earthy colours, hence the throw/cushions and artwork but again, i dont actually own these things (yet?) ",1,1744520859.0,DesignMyRoom,1,1.0,False

32yo male living at home. Growing up my family was (still is) emotionally shut off and unable to discuss anything difficult or 'adult'. Mother was a borderline alcoholic, and my father worked a lot. I sort of raised myself. Poorly. Everything is forced and awkward. Conversations are repetitive and surface level. I had periods where I tried and tried to assert boundaries. Nothing ever changed.

My father, whenever walking near me, even if I am in my bedroom with the door closed, will say out loud ""choo choo"" as he walks by. He will just sort of make this tsk tsk sound with his mouth and then I hear the words ""choo choo"". It fucking drives me mental. It's only when I know he knows I'm around as well.

It makes me feel as though he views me like a little kid who needs some silly soothing funny words thrown around to reassure me that everything is all ok and that I can relax. I don't know how to explain it. It makes my blood boil.

He will walk past my bedroom and go tsk tsk choo choo and then literally say what he is doing quietly / under his breath such as 'going to the kitchen' or 'ah, make a coffee'.

Just typing this makes me cringe.

He must do this every time I am around. I am so fucking tired of hearhing choo choo tsk tsk choo choo as he frantically walks pasy me or my bedroom.

I am a seasoned cruiser but new to NCL. I am a travel advisor so I want to try all lines, naturally. 

Husband and I just booked Aqua in October - very excited! 

My question is I am not the biggest Starbucks fan but I love coffee and espresso drinks. What are my options besides Starbucks on NCL? 

Does the buffet/restaurants have decent coffee or is it old school ‚Äòconcentrate‚Äô style? 

For reference my favorite spot on a Princess ship is the International Cafe for its brewed coffee and selection of espresso drinks.

Monday was supposed to be my first day back at work after being on Maternity leave. My 9 month old seems like he has lost a lot of weight, has been eating and drinking poorly. We've been staying at the pediatric emergency hospital unit since Thursday and man I need a fucking break. The hospital bed sucks. Seeing my 9 month old trying to breathe through the snot and losing his voice is killing me. Seeing my 'always reliable' husband shivering and shaking, worried sick about our infant is also killing me. He is trying so hard to give me a break but I'm worried he will just drop our baby so I'm obviously taking over everything.

It took 9 tries to find a vein in my baby's body. 9 fucking pokes. 5 adults had to hold him down. Fuck. Seeing him start off thrashing to ending up just whimpering is something that I haven't stopped thinking about.

I just want to go and cry in a corner. I want to cherish my new baby kicking me, I want to feel the relief of being back at work. I want to enjoy thinking of baby names but I'm just running around town, making sure my husband is hydrated and eating, assisting the nurses every time the baby needs his vitals checked, changing every single diaper at an unfamiliar location (at a height that makes my back hurt). I wish that I'd just collapse so I can take a break. We have no family and I can't impose this on our friends either. Frankly they don't need to be exposed to whatever virus we have.  

I'm surviving on Tylenol and coffee. At least I didn't catch whatever these two did. ",1,1744520451.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

Friday:

Dinner at Corretto Dee Why
Outdoor table. Across from the beach but no actual view of the ocean.  Still great vibes and people watching. Food was really good.  Had a raw tuna taco entree, and beef rump main.  Both were above average in terms of flavour and execution.  Garlic bread was a miss.  

Saturday : 

Coffee 1 at Coast Palm Beach. Campos beans and well made. Didn‚Äôt have brea here cause we were chasing a beach vibe. 

Breakfast at Dunes Kiosk Palm Beach.  Again no view of surf but lovely outdoor setting.  
Had the BEST bacon and egg rolls.  What is that bread?! Like between a roll and a Turkish.  Truly will have me drive 2hrs for that alone. 
Walked across carpark to soak in the surf.  

Coffee 2 from Palm Beach Cafe and Restaurant.  They sell Salvador Coffee Roasters coffee and it did not disappoint.  

Lunch: Oceana Traders in Avalon. Takeaway fish and chip place with a couple of tables.  
Had Fried Cod and salmon poke bowl. Both were fresh and delicious.  Beach was walkable from here.  
Returned here on Sunday to pick up lobster pie and seafood chowder to take home. They had fish stock and crustacean stock as well as various risottos in the freezer.  

Dinner: Jonah‚Äôs. Great food with big portions and good service.  Nothing to fault.  Recommend lunch or early dinner to realty soak in the views.  

Sunday:

Breakfast: Lovat Cafe in Avalon. Highlight was the location. Sitting in the sand under trees with beach stretched out in front.  
Had big breakfast burger and eggs benny.  Well made and tasty.  Coffee was great too. 

All in all awesome food finds. 

Shopping?

Assume the role of an experienced writer with 20+ years of experience.

Write the following speech:

A man who abandoned his son before he was Born. After 30 years, he searched for his son and found him. They're now at the cafeteria. The man start talking.

Start.

- Output:

(The man, let's call him Arthur, shifts uncomfortably in the plastic cafeteria chair. He looks older than his years, lines etched deep around his eyes and mouth. His hands tremble slightly as he cradles a lukewarm cup of coffee he hasn't touched. Across from him sits his son ‚Äì a man now, maybe showing faint traces of Arthur's younger self around the eyes, but otherwise a stranger shaped by a life lived entirely without him. The air hums with the low murmur of the cafeteria, the clatter of trays, but between them, the silence is vast and heavy.)

Arthur: (Clears his throat, the sound unnaturally loud) Right. Well. Thank you... thank you for agreeing to this. To meet me. I know... I know this is beyond awkward. Surreal, even. Feels like a scene I‚Äôve spent half my life trying not to write, and the other half rewriting in my head until the words lost all meaning. And yet, here we are.

(He takes a shaky breath, looks down at his hands, then forces himself to meet his son‚Äôs gaze, holding it briefly before looking away again.)

Thirty years. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs an obscene amount of time, isn‚Äôt it? An entire life. Your entire life, practically. And for all of it‚Ä¶ I wasn't there. There's no easy way to say that. No clever turn of phrase, no metaphor I can conjure from decades of fiddling with words that can soften the bald truth of it. I wasn't there.

(He pauses, gathering himself.)

When your mother‚Ä¶ when she told me she was pregnant‚Ä¶ I wasn't a man. Not really. I was a boy playing at being one, terrified and drowning in my own perceived inadequacies. Fear is a corrosive thing. It makes you selfish. It makes you rationalize cowardice as‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even know what I called it then. Prudence? Survival? Lies I told myself. The truth is, I ran. I chose the path of least resistance for me, and in doing so, I committed an act of profound‚Ä¶ absence. An abandonment not just of her, but of you. Before you even drew your first breath.

(He grips the coffee cup tighter, the warmth long gone.)

I've spent decades‚Ä¶ living with the echo of that choice. It‚Äôs not something you outrun. Believe me, I tried. Built a life, had successes, failures‚Ä¶ the usual tapestry. But there was always this‚Ä¶ hole. This knowledge. A story with the most crucial chapter ripped out by my own hand.

(He looks up again, his expression etched with a deep, weary sadness.)

I‚Äôm not here to ask for forgiveness. God, no. That‚Äôs not something I have the right to ask for, let alone expect. Forgiveness is earned, and I‚Äôve done precisely nothing to warrant it. I‚Äôm not here to make excuses, either. Fear, youth, stupidity‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre explanations, maybe, but they‚Äôre not excuses. They don‚Äôt absolve anything.

Finding you‚Ä¶ it wasn‚Äôt easy. Took time. Took facing things I‚Äôd buried deep. Why now? Maybe‚Ä¶ maybe you reach an age where the ghosts get louder. Where the silence you created becomes unbearable. Maybe you finally understand that the least ‚Äì the absolute least ‚Äì you can do is face the consequence of your actions. Even if that consequence is just‚Ä¶ sitting here, in this plastic chair, looking at the man you failed before he was born.

(He gestures vaguely with a hand.)

I don‚Äôt know what you want to know, if anything. I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre feeling ‚Äì anger, indifference, curiosity, contempt‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre entitled to all of it. All I wanted‚Ä¶ all I felt I had to do, finally‚Ä¶ was to show up. To acknowledge what I did. To let you see the face of the man who made that choice all those years ago.

(He leans forward slightly, his voice dropping, earnest now.)

I imagine you have questions. Or maybe you have none. Maybe this is the first and last time we‚Äôll sit across from each other. That‚Äôs your prerogative. Entirely. You owe me nothing. Not your time, not your attention, not an ounce of understanding.

But‚Ä¶ if you do have questions‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll answer them. Honestly. As best I can. That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs the only thing I can offer you now. Thirty years late.

1jxzyhm,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1jxzyhm/my_journey_from_daraa_to_a_new_beginning/,My Journey: From Daraa to a New Beginning,"
I was born in Daraa, Syria‚Äîa city that would soon become the epicenter of a national uprising. As I grew, so did the unrest around me. The sounds of gunfire and explosions became the backdrop of my childhood, replacing lullabies and laughter. The civil war wasn‚Äôt just on the news; it was outside our door, shaping every aspect of our daily lives.

My father, a man of principle and hope, joined peaceful protests, believing in a better future for Syria. One day, during a demonstration, a bomb exploded near his group. Miraculously, he survived, but shrapnel embedded in his arm served as a constant reminder of the dangers we faced. That incident was a turning point‚Äîwe realized we could no longer stay.

Leaving our home was heart-wrenching. We navigated through a landscape littered with checkpoints and the echoes of conflict, each step fraught with uncertainty. Our destination was the Al Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, a place we hoped would offer safety and a chance to rebuild.

Upon arrival, we were met with harsh realities. The camp was overcrowded, with families living in tents that offered little protection from the elements. Basic necessities were scarce‚Äîclean water, adequate food, and proper sanitation were luxuries. Children, including myself, faced health challenges due to these conditions. Despite the hardships, the resilience of those around me was inspiring. Communities formed, support systems emerged, and amidst the adversity, hope persisted.

The first two years of the conflict in Syria were marked by profound loss. We lost so many loved ones, including two of my uncles who were martyred. Each loss deepened our resolve to find safety and a semblance of normalcy.

Determined to escape the escalating violence, we set our sights on Irbid, a city in northern Jordan. However, the journey was fraught with peril. Jordanian officers manned the borders, denying entry to Syrians. Undeterred, we resorted to sneaking across, one by one, fully aware of the dangers but driven by the hope for a better life. Along the way, we faced additional hardships, including multiple robberies by those who were supposed to protect us 

Upon reaching Irbid, we encountered a host country grappling with its own challenges. Employment opportunities for Syrians were scarce, and many of us were left without work. Living on a meager 60 Jordanian dinars a month, we struggled to meet basic needs. Social tensions simmered, and instances of discrimination were not uncommon. I recall a particular altercation that escalated into a significant fight between my family and a Jordanian family. The conflict ignited when a young man shoved my cousin simply because he was Syrian. In defense, my uncle, father, and other relatives intervened, leading to a scuffle that resulted in one injury. Thankfully, it wasn‚Äôt severe; we managed to stop the bleeding with some coffee.

Life in Irbid was grueling. We lived on a meager 60 Jordanian dinars a month, struggling to meet basic needs. The constant stress and uncertainty weighed heavily on us. I often saw the hopelessness in my father‚Äôs eyes, a man who had always been our pillar, now on the brink of giving up.

Then, after three years of relentless hardship, we received a call that would change our lives forever. The American refugee camp contacted us, asking if we would consider resettling in the United States. At first, we thought it was a prank. But as the reality set in, my parents deliberated, torn between hope and fear. They didn‚Äôt want to make a decision they‚Äôd regret, but ultimately, they said yes.

The resettlement process was rigorous and time-consuming. It took about six months to complete the necessary meetings and screenings. We were hopeful that this opportunity would lead to stability after losing everything, yet we couldn‚Äôt shake the fear of the unknown.

After a long and exhausting journey, we arrived in Phoenix, Arizona. Having never flown before, the experience was both thrilling and overwhelming for us. At the airport, two kind individuals greeted us and guided us to our new apartment. We were astonished‚Äîour rent was covered for the first three months. Was this really happening? This was America‚Äîthe land where dreams come true.

At just seven years old, I couldn‚Äôt fully grasp the gravity of leaving Syria, but I sensed an emptiness within me. I saw it in my parents‚Äô eyes too‚Äîa deep longing for the homeland we had left behind.

Adjusting to life in America came with its challenges. Not knowing English made everything feel awkward, especially at school. But within five months, I began translating for new Arab refugees, helping them navigate this unfamiliar world.

We were the first Arab refugees in our apartment complex. Within a year, about 17 Syrian families had moved in, and together, we rebuilt a sense of community that reminded us of home.

In search of stability, we moved between states four times. Each move brought new challenges, but also new opportunities to grow and adapt.

We are deeply grateful to the American government for the opportunities and support they provided. They believed in us when our own country could not. Their faith allowed us to rebuild our lives with dignity and hope.

Now, with Syria experiencing significant changes, it‚Äôs bittersweet to think about leaving the country that became our sanctuary. After nine years, the prospect of returning home fills us with mixed emotions‚Äîjoy for the chance to reunite with our roots, and sorrow for the goodbyes we‚Äôll say here.

As we prepare for this new chapter, we carry with us the lessons, friendships, and experiences that have shaped us. America gave us a second chance; now, we hope to contribute to the rebuilding of our homeland.

Context, an old partner of hers from. 20+ years ago reached out. Wife told me then said she has no intentions to respond. A few weeks go by and she places her phone down on the table and I notice a message from the guy and ask her are they messaging, was told just a few messages. Said I have no issue with it just would have been nice to have been told out of courtesy considering she said she wasn't going to. 

She said they had unresolved issues and he wanted closure and she also felt like she wanted closure. I didn't think much of this. 

Then all of a sudden the messaging is daily! I asked if she had intentions to catch up, she said no but if we bumped into each other I'd probably sit down for a coffee. 

I shut down a bit when cold as I wasn't buying it. 

A little while later we have a fight and I said direct to her I don't trust this guy as I don't know him, I then said to her I trust her but based on various discussions I don't believe her versions of what these discussions are about. 

Anyway fast forward, she handed me her phone today to read a message from her mother. I then decided to open the other messages. I shouldn't have but I did. 

I'm upset and confused. This guy asked about my working schedule asking if I work days or nights, her response was I'm at home most nights but when home I'm working (totally untrue) paints me out to be someone who isn't present at home. 

Various messages of him using cheeky innuendo, she doesn't respond in the same manner but she also isn't being clear and shutting it down. 

Then today I see a message where she apologised for not messaging much the night before as she was out for a birthday dinner with friends.... when in reality she was at home having a mini date night with me. 

Why lie about what you did? Also it's great to know I plan a date night only for her to lie about it to people. Why hide it??

1jxzw4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/SafetyProfessionals/comments/1jxzw4i/my_experience_at_an_undisclosed_pizza_place/,My experience at an undisclosed pizza place.,"TLDR: I‚Äôm a manager at this place, been there 6 years, this gm is my age, and new to the location but has not been at a place busy like this. He‚Äôs worked here for 2 years, very hot headed and cruel kinda person, gets stressed out easily. 

Had an incident where he threw a large object at someone in a fit of rage when he first started(2 years ago) and I still don‚Äôt feel right about it, he asked around about who reported him; Humiliated other managers and employees with his disrespectful demeanor on weekly if not daily basis 4 of them quit as well as several other employees. He seems to really enjoy putting people down publicly. 

Yesterday He publicly humiliated me in front of the entire staff and several customers, then when I had to relieve myself (condition bound) and in control of the workflow situation with many staff able to take my place. 

Proceeded to rave about me in the bathroom in front of everyone again and threw away everyone‚Äôs drink, causing other employees to have a panic attack and feel unsafe. Knowing my condition and all. 

I had to talk to upper management about it because he wasn‚Äôt available and don‚Äôt feel it was handled 
Well and may have a repeat occurrence like before(he‚Äôs never really gotten better with his attitude but hasn‚Äôt thrown anything at anyone since then) but everyone is always anxious when he‚Äôs around. 

Also feel that this happens because we lie to customers about quoted times and so we get more orders then we can handle but we‚Äôre constantly pressured to just keep shoving stuff in the oven which stresses out cut table(people that work with 14inch razor sharp knives) to get incredibly stressed. 

Which may be another case in itself that the environment is too stressful and causes people undue psychological tendencies( anger, rage, panic, apathy) and that we should dissuade customers from ordering by posting proper times(30 minutes to 90 minutes late in a lot of cases for delivery and up to 45 minutes late for pickup.) which will then make them order later and spread the rush out. 

Below is the email I want to send HR or talk to osha. 


I‚Äôm making a complaint against my general Manager, N. At about 4 pm I was making a salad for a customer. The other employees were just getting in for their shifts and N comes over to station which I am. Working at and starts yelling in a very demeaning tone about about half a teaspoon or so bits of red onion in the cheddar bin on the station. Saying ‚Äúwell I wasn‚Äôt over here I wonder who did this, putting a whole handful of red onions in the cheddar bin!‚Äù from previous put downs like this I‚Äôm already so flushed and embarrassed that I couldn‚Äôt even speak because I felt threatened by him. I moved away for my safety, and tried filling up the make table but he kept going yelling across the room ‚Äúhey where you going it‚Äôs fine‚Äù ‚Äúwe‚Äôll just make salads in the bins, and proceeded to put a handful of the cheddar in the red onion. 

At the this point my face is beet red and my blood pressure is through the roof and I‚Äôm shaking, I wasn‚Äôt able to finish making the salad until after he had left the kitchen. And I also removed the cheddar that HE put in the red onion bin. I didn‚Äôt feel normal again until about 45 minutes later as I was able to focus on the rush at work trying to keep my composure from that incident. 

Up until about 5:30 everything seemed fine, N was in the back acting very upset, and dissociated so I was trying to put him out of mind because just the thought of messing something up during the rush might send him over the edge again. At this point I was holding my need to go the bathroom after previous harassment from coworkers and N himself about my bathroom breaks. 

I‚Äôd 4 years ago I gave M(previous general manager who sexually harassed me) my  diagnosis from my doctor about my condition and had mentioned it to N and others at work previously that I struggle with daily I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôre HR or not but I do not wish to to share that unless I know for sure that you are and will not be sharing that information under hippa guidance. 

But at 5:59 I had to relieve myself, telling my line that I was going to the bathroom, while in the bathroom I could hear N over the roar of the ovens and people in the lobby yelling about me being in the bathroom in front of my coworkers, and customers in the lobby. Which only made it harder for me to relieve myself, and by the time I was done washing my hands I had been in the bathroom only 7 minutes. As I looked at the clock up front when I left and when I got back. 

Only to find that the coffee that I had gotten for work had been thrown in the trash, and not just my drink, but every coworkers drinks up front, our air conditioner isn‚Äôt working correctly ¬†and it‚Äôs very hot and humid in the kitchen. We need those drinks to stay cool, and productive. He set a precedent by allowing us to have them in the first place then I come back after he was complaining about me relieving myself in the bathroom and find my drink has been thrown in the trash. 

This is harassment, theft, and he created hostile work environment for myself and the rest of my employees J.G. and T.S. both came to me complaining about that as well J.G. having a panic attack outside, from all this undue duress and hostility for something that he should‚Äôve been accommodating me for in regards to my need to use the restroom and to stay hydrated and focused during an already stressful time. After that was over I had to go the bathroom again and I had diarrhea which was caused by him stressing me out; exacerbating my condition. ¬†I felt I needed to photograph and document because of this whole altercation Which I would also like to bring to oshas attention being told to not increase times to realistic measure during rushes is what is causing this behavior. 

It‚Äôs too much stress for any of us to handle reasonably and it has lead to something like this happening nearly every single Friday and Saturday that I‚Äôve worked here for the last 2 years. I coming to you now because I‚Äôve had enough, I don‚Äôt feel respected, I don‚Äôt inch feel valued, I feel threatened, manipulated, and put down for trying to go above and beyond during these stressful shifts. I‚Äôm working outside my set availability as well to deal with this as two of our managers Cj, and H.G.  quit because of his hostile put downs. Before that even, ¬†R.B. and S.Q. also left because of him. 

So I‚Äôve been working outside my availability to appease him as well as trying to do everything as fast as possible around him because I‚Äôm under constant anxiety worried he may lash out abusively at me for seemingly minor mistakes in the process of doing things I dropped a vat of dough on myself at around 7:20 three Thursday‚Äôs ago which led to me having a sprained ankle.

 I just left early that day and proceeded to walk it off because I didn‚Äôt want to miss work and make him upset. This Thursday I was rushing trying to weigh dough and cut myself in the process instead of leaving to make sure it was okay I just patched myself up there which he was actually very nice about and tried to make sure I was going to be able to make it through work, but that was outweighed by the worry I had if I wasn‚Äôt he would act cruelly towards me. 

This all Started back when T.R. worked here and he asked if we should up delivery times and he threw a large metal tray at him. Since then I haven‚Äôt been able to trust his judgement or emotions at work and I‚Äôve constantly been under anxiety while working there. I would also like to complain on the behalf of T.S. as N a set precedent of allowing us to store our personal foods in the freezers and he has thrown away her ice cream repeatedly and did yesterday as well.¬†

This is the end of the email I talked to upper management about it, but he just has him apologize to me over the phone which felt insincere, and I mentioned that to him and he became combative. Saying I‚Äôm the general manager, you‚Äôre not going to bully me out of a job.  I tried to assure him that wasn‚Äôt the case I just wanted him to acknowledge the way he made me feel and he said it‚Äôs not a big deal I might‚Äôve over reacted a little but now you‚Äôre over reacting and I said we‚Äôre at an impasse then. 

I then called upper management again and he called him and he called back and tried to apologize to me in person which also felt insincere but I took it for what it was worth because he said he would work on his anger management. I don‚Äôt trust him. Should I go to HR, or osha? I feel like I have a good case. ",1,1744519725.0,SafetyProfessionals,8,1.0,False

Only use it to go to the mall on little coffee dates with my wife (obviously she in her Ninebot KickScooter E2 Plus), 5 km distance each way.  
  
Normally, given my wife scooter is way less powerful I put mine in mid e-save mode so mine rides in a similar pace to hers. By the time we arrive back home my scooter battery is around 50% \~ 60% charge.   
  
TODAY something weird happened to me... today this thing was dropping charge like crazy. I wasn't even noticing what was going on because I'm so used to arrive back home with +50% charge that I don't even look the battery charge status anymore. I didn't even make it back home.  
  
We left the mall and after 3 minutes riding I noticed the scooter didn't want to go faster than 6\~8 km, then I looked at the battery charge in my phone and it said 15%. I begun to wonder if I left home uncharged from last trip, so I decided to order a Uber Ride and check this thing back home.  
  
By the time we arrived home and I turned the scooter ON again the thing didn't even wanted to accelerate. Took it to the apartment and connected to the charger. The app showed the battery was at 0% and the estimated time to full charge displayed in the app was 5 hours. It seems to be charging fine (i suppose), its now at 50% charge and says \~02:30 hours:minutes to complete.

It doesn't make any sense, we did the same thing and same route we always do. Normally by the time we arrive to the mall my battery is somewhere 75%\~80%.

Lucky me, I've been vlogging all my trips on the scooter so I went to see the video to check if I actually left the house without full charge and boy... I left the house with 100% battery. In the video I can clearly see how everything was going normal and after almost arriving to a store nearby the mall (500 meters away from the mall) the battery indicator begun to drop bars like crazy.

At the time of arriving the store 1 bar had disappeared (4 remaining), I turned the scooter OFF to enter the store. Turn it ON again to leave from the store to the mall but another bar was gone while OFF (3 remaining wtf), 2/5 of the 500 meters distance between the store and the mall was me walking beside the scooter to don't bother people in the way. Turned the scooter OFF again to enter the mall. Turned the scooter ON again to leave the mall (another bar gone while OFF, I'm at 2 bars now), I'm not even riding it because I have to cross a the avenue using a pedestrian bridge, 1 minute after while on the top of the bridge another bard is gone!!!! (1 bar left), 2 minutes later the scooter won't even accelerate.

Should I go for warranty right away?",1,1744519670.0,ElectricScooters,0,1.0,False
1jxzush,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jxzush,New bookstore in South Durham,"I was pleasantly surprised to see a sign for a new bookstore & coffee shop when I went to renew my tags off of 55 earlier this week. It‚Äôs called Daughters Coffee & Books. 

They opened today (Saturday) and it was quite busy the entire time I was there. It was nice to see so many folks come out to support a new business!

Coffee + new & used books. It‚Äôs not large, but it has a cute space in the back corner for the littles. The used books were in really good shape. Not a massive number of new books, but a selection of stuff that a fair number of women will like based on what has been super popular recently: Abby Jimenez, Sarah J Maas, Rebecca Yarros, Tracy Deonn (a local author). And of course plenty of other books including books for kiddos.

This started about a month ago when I started hearing things, at first I had though I was experiencing auditory hallucinations from being alone so often. Since I barely leave my house, order groceries to my door and barely have friends to invite me out. So my house is my dome.

But because of the frequent hearing door opening noises or walking above me upstairs, noises that weren't mine, I'd gone to investigate where it came from. So walking from the kitchen to the upstairs bathroom, I noticed that my shampoo bottle had been on my bathroom sink instead of the ridge in the shower. 
  I know that I wouldn't do that, I spend a lot of my alone free time organizing and reorganizing. So I would never have put the shampoo there.

After 2 weeks of those small noticings they had gotten bigger my pots and pans would be splayed out on my living room floor, I would find my TV on my dining room table. This drove me incredibly insane, everything unorganized and out of place. 
I had looked in so many place where this thing could have been hiding. 

One night, I had seen a tall thing out side my upstairs bedroom window. A tall, white thing. Running to the barn just behind My house. I had been creeped out beyond All physical belief. Now i had known there was something in my house, or near it like my barn. 

 Now, in this past week. Things have gone missing instead of out of place, with the biggest thing being 2 of the chairs around my dining table or coffee table in the middle of my living room. 
 I hadn't known where these things had gone, and I was way to stupidly scared to check the barn where that thing had ran off to.

Now as I am writing this, I am in my basement. One I've never dared to step foot in since I've bought this house, I was walking down to get a snack from my kitchen fridge, as scratching came of the wooden basement door. As if a dog had been doing it, a very big dog. 

I made a stupid decision to open the door. The door, opening towards the basement flung open as I leaned against it to force the build up and debris on it to open. 
I fell down a flight of stairs, I just woke up from banging my head so hard I passed out. Looking in front of me, a small light hung from the ceiling. My 2 chairs, my coffee table and a old 70s TV on a dresser from my childhood home which both I stored in my barn had been splayed out in front of me as if someone was making a living down here. 

 The only thing that seems more off than the objects is the non-human like face I see in the mist of darkness that the light bulbs stingy light just can't reach‚Ä¶ my hands are shaking horribly as I right this. I do not know what this thing wants, but I feel drawn to walk towards it.

Last year, he confessed his feelings. He never pressured me‚Äîhe just said he‚Äôd wait and hoped I‚Äôd eventually feel the same. We went on one date, but then he made a joke that didn‚Äôt sit well with me. It wasn‚Äôt intentional, but I felt disrespected enough to cut ties with him around April or May.

Then this January, we randomly ran into each other at a coffee shop. It was a casual ‚Äúkamusta,‚Äù and I didn‚Äôt feel any anger anymore. He apologized sincerely, and we slowly reconnected. The closeness came back. He invited me to hang out again, introduced me to his parents. Even if we were ‚Äújust friends,‚Äù it was obvious he still had feelings.

Eventually, he told me he had accepted that I didn‚Äôt like him back. And I was honest‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt have feelings for him at the time. But I told him I didn‚Äôt want to lose him again. After that conversation, things changed. He slowly pulled back. We stopped talking as often. And I didn‚Äôt realize until then‚Ä¶ I had already fallen for him.

At first, I didn‚Äôt like him physically. He wasn‚Äôt my ‚Äútype.‚Äù But he was kind, respectful, helpful, and genuinely a good person. Now I see all the green flags I used to overlook. I think the connection built over time through real friendship and presence. I started missing him. Not for the favors or help‚Äîjust for him.

Now I‚Äôm the one catching feelings. And maybe it‚Äôs too late.

But now that he‚Äôs slowly disappeared from my life, it stings. Some days I feel like I want to cut him off mentally just to move on. But emotionally? I still care. I still love him. I miss him every single day. And yeah, it hurts.

We‚Äôve both lost a fair amount of weight and I‚Äôm extremely proud of us, but we have a lot more to go. We‚Äôre both doing the keto diet (no, not ‚Äúdirty keto‚Äù) and it‚Äôs working great for us. 
However, like everyone, we have individual needs and issues with food. I have a problem with not wanting to eat full meals, and just grazing throughout the day. My husband, on the other hand, has a problem with self-control. We‚Äôve had discussions in the past about how I feel that he should work on that issue instead of accepting it, but I just want what‚Äôs best for him at the end of the day (but that‚Äôs another topic). So in the meantime, I have agreed to hide certain food from him. 

We have these keto chocolates, and while I might eat one or two a day, if he has full access to them he will eat them until he is full. I found this fake book and began hiding all of the chocolates in there, and I divvy out one or two a day into a candy dish. It has worked great so far! Also it gives my apartment a haunted house/secret study vibe lol. 

The fridge, however, is a lot more challenging. I find that I can have a hotdog every once in a while if I am too tired to make dinner, and it keeps me from just eating snacks. (Before you say it, they are a good brand with clean ingredients and I use a keto bun). My husband really didn‚Äôt want me to buy them, because he said that he will eat them for every meal if he knows that they‚Äôre in the fridge (because they‚Äôre quick and yummy). I told him I would hide them. My first attempt was just to see if he would actively look for them. I put them in a baggie inside of a brown paper bag and put them in the very back of the fridge. We have a lot of fresh food in our fridge so they weren‚Äôt even visible. But he still found them! And I only found out because they‚Äôre almost all gone üò≠üíÄ. 
So here is my current idea (pictured). I‚Äôm mostly posting this because the absurdity of it has me laughing every time I see it. There‚Äôs a super low chance he would ever grab the coffee creamer specifically, since I like to make us our coffees when we have them, and the creamer kinda sucks anyway haha. But picturing him accidentally dunking a wiener into a cup of coffee is killing me üòÜ

I cant remember exactly but i started experincing bowel issues around the time i started med maybe few months after Im not sure if i just deveoped bc of poor diet (ive now changed that diet so prob not) or if i developed it geneticly my father has diberticulitus (idk how to spell) my uncle has colitous and my mom had IBS temporarally bc of stress. so who knows. I never struggled with it before only until about a ffew months after i started the meds but deffinetly not right away. my symtoms primaraly consist of consipation, painful bloating, gas burping and the other one, as well as having trigger foods such as fried foods and carbs. Somtimes if i even eat all the right foods I still get the symtoms! its so frustrating!

Docter changing doseage?

I am thinking of going to the docter to lessening my doseage to maybe lessen the symtoms. it did get so bad where i had to go to the hospital once and the pain was so bad they thought it was my apendix. turned out it was just a very bad bowl flare up and ive had a few in the past maybe 5. this is starting to affect my daily life. its so hard to choose over my mental health or my physical health. as well as not being able to afford therapy.

1jxzea1,https://www.reddit.com/r/managers/comments/1jxzea1/aita_was_just_told_at_work_that_im_bossy_and_that/,AITA? Was just told at work that I‚Äôm ‚Äúbossy‚Äù and that other people have been annoyed with me. I literally had no idea.,"So I (30F) work at a hotel, at the front desk and was taking a break with my boss (who is a friend) and we were talking about the possibility of me becoming a supervisor. It‚Äôs not a definite thing, just a position that management‚Äôs thinking about opening because no one wants to work nights and they want someone available to assist with guests or night audit. I‚Äôm the only team member who‚Äôs completely flexible in my schedule and is willing to cover people. 

So basically she was saying that if I wanted the job I‚Äôd need to step it up with my performance( no more little mistakes)which I don‚Äôt make often, but I always take accountability for when I do and do my best not to make again. But then she said ‚ÄúOh and you need to work on your bossiness. It‚Äôs pissing people off.‚Äù Um, what??

I was so shocked, I was like ‚Äúwhat do you mean? Bossy? What did I do?‚Äù Because as far as I knew everything was fine and all my coworkers liked me. I always say hello to everyone and they say hi back, no one ignores me so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm being excluded. In fact everyone jokes with me and communicates with me about what I need to know to do my job. And just to be clear I don‚Äôt make jokes about people at their expense. That‚Äôs rude and mean and also one of the easiest ways to get fired. 

So she just says ‚ÄúYeah, you know, sometimes you can be bossy. Just bossy.‚Äù And I said ‚ÄúI actually didn‚Äôt, can you please give me an example? Because if I was rude to someone and didn‚Äôt realize I don‚Äôt want to do it again so I need to know what the specific behavior is.‚Äù 

And she said she couldn‚Äôt tell me who complained just that it was multiple people. And I said ‚Äúno I get that, but what behavior is it specifically? I won‚Äôt know what to correct if you don‚Äôt tell me.‚Äù 

So basically she tells me that sometimes when I‚Äôm talking to my coworkers, I don‚Äôt always say please and thank you. And that sometimes I interrupt conversations. And that it comes across as me telling people what to do. Ok fair, that wasn‚Äôt my intention but that‚Äôs not what matters, impact is. But then she goes on to say that when the idea of me becoming a supervisor was floated to other managers there were some hard no‚Äôs because they were worried that I‚Äôd become a TYRANT if given that position. 

And I was just shocked. I told her ‚Äúok I hear you on all the other stuff, that‚Äôs me being a little socially inept, and I will definitely reflect on that but a tyrant? What do you mean telling people what to do?‚Äù 

She said ‚Äú you know like when you‚Äôre telling people about an issue sometimes you say (hey x is broken) instead of ( hey y can you fix x? It broke again)‚Äù and I just said ‚Äúyeah I definitely do that, it‚Äôs mostly after I‚Äôve already done the second version and I‚Äôm just updating the person on a situation again and I also say please and thank you just as much.‚Äù 

She said ‚Äúno I‚Äôve heard you do it before. And it pisses people off.‚Äù She then told me that I just pissed off a manger yesterday(who has never mentioned or even hinted that I‚Äôve been inappropriate or rude with him and is on a joking basis with me)
 
And that I was rude to him at the end of the day when I came into the back office and told him about a situation with a room. All I said  was ‚ÄúHey room 224 didn‚Äôt get cleaned today. I already talked to the guest and they‚Äôre ok. I just brought them some towels and coffee. Just wanted to let you know.‚Äù That‚Äôs it, I didn‚Äôt raise my voice. I wasn‚Äôt disrespectful to him or accusing him of anything. I was just telling him about an issue with the room and that I‚Äôd handled it, but apparently when I left the room, he was just like ‚Äúwhat the fuck?!‚Äù 

And that earlier in the week I had interrupted a conversation that he was having in his office, but I remember the incident and it was with his door half open so I couldn‚Äôt see that he was talking to anyone and I was just saying hi as I was clocking in and then I said oh sorry for interrupting, and then left? 

I just told her thanks for letting me know and I‚Äôll work on it.

My biggest thing is why was this never brought up? So that I could be aware of how I‚Äôm coming off and have time to correct myself. Especially when we‚Äôve been talking about the supervisor position for AWHILE. And I‚Äôm not angry that certain people don‚Äôt like me. That‚Äôs just going to happen at any job you have, but it was never my intention to come off like I think I‚Äôm better than others. 

And I‚Äôm mortified that people would perceive me that way and I‚Äôm going to be more aware of how I‚Äôm interacting with my coworkers. 

But this new knowledge is also bringing up feelings of resentment because not only am I the only person who‚Äôs willing to work odd hours and cover people(and they call out a lot) but I‚Äôm also the only person who does not claim my meal and rest break penalty‚Äôs when I don‚Äôt have someone to cover me( happens multiple times a week, because all the managers like to leave at 5 or earlier). Money that I could really use. Which I was asked to do to be seen as a team player and with the understanding that it would make me look good for the supervisor position. And it‚Äôs been months. 

I know that these are two separate issues, but now I‚Äôm thinking that I don‚Äôt want the drama thats clearly going to come with the position and I just don‚Äôt know what to do next. And the fact that I‚Äôm friends with my boss just makes this even more difficult. So, do you guys think that I‚Äôve been acting inappropriately and that I‚Äôm an asshole or do you think that I‚Äôm just direct? Either way I‚Äôm just gonna keep my head down and keep working, but fuck man I did not expect that.",12,1744517815.0,managers,25,0.83,False
