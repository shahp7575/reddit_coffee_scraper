1i91xd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1i91xd0/allegedly_avoidant_exdate_inb4_tldr/,Allegedly avoidant ex-date (inb4: TL;DR),"Hi, it’s almost 2 weeks since the girl I’ve been dating (23F) has dumped me (24M) out of sudden. Since the very beggining I’ve had this feeling that she may be an avoidant and now I see her almost as a walking example of an avoidant, but I’d like to share my story and try to verify it. This place seems to be the right one (thank you, algorithm), so If you wanted to look at it, I’d be grateful.

We met on tinder. And I’m not gonna lie – she seemed so damn perfect I almost couldn’t have believed this. I have some experience with dating apps and, except her, there was no one that would make me so impressed. Everyone was at best quite okey, but she… she was everything I could ever dream of in life, especially on dating app. We had a match, so I wrote to her and… nothing. I haven’t even been left on read for like month or two so I accepted that she’s probably never going to see it and write back. But one day I saw notification and it turned out that she has replied to me. She was very impressed and visibly interested but at the same time she seemed to be very ashamed of the fact she writes back so late. She explained that she hasn’t been on tinder for quite a long time because of hard time at work, uni and so on. She even stated that she shouldn’t have written after so long and that she’s sorry.  I reassured her that this is fine, that I understand and that I’m glad she wrote to me. After few messeges she started to ask me very specific and direct questions – about my perception of intimacy, both emotional and physic, about my goals, about my boundaries in life and relationship and so on. She perceived it as weird but I perceived it as very mature and important and reacted positively on it. For few days we texted daily on tinder and everything was fine, completely adequate and normal. She even proposed to meet each other irl and we scheduled a meeting.  Suddenly she started to see my messages and write back with a huge delay and rather short, she herself explained that it is due to her working a lot which turned out to be true, cause she really worked not only 5 days a week but also took additional tasks for the 2 remaining days – she worked all the time, apparently. From the other hand, she used to brag about not having time for herself, house chores, friends and literally anything except from work and uni. I understood it somehow because I am master of laws myself so I do understand what does it mean to study something very time consuming. She also stated that she has very hard time in work due to incoming end of the year and that it shall last till the January. I told her that I do understand, that I appreciate that she communicates about it and that I’ll be patiently waiting till the January when things get easier for her. It is also important to state that at the time I lived in town about an hour from the city she was living in, but in January I was about to move there due to work (it had nothing to do with her, I would’ve moved there even if I didn’t meet her).

The time was passing, we met for the first time and month later for the second time. After the first meeting she told me that she is glad she finally met someone normal and that this meeting will definitely not be the last one. After this the texting was still quite occasional from her side but I knew about this hard time at work so I understood. After some time I proposed second meeting and she agreed. We met and this one resembled a date – we went to a restaurant and in the ending she asked whether I’d like to hug her what I obviously did. It was very important part because she was quite frequently saying that she doesn’t like physical intimacy of anyone but she would like to like it and that she doesn’t like it because no one made her used to it before. She was still a virgin and generally avoided physical contact even in non-sexual context. She also claimed that she has never been in a relationship and directly said that she “escaped”/”run from” every possible relationship so far but she hoped not to run from this one.  Which also seems important – at the very beginning of this second meeting she told me something like “listen… I do not use my phone 24/7, really. If I must I use it but I try not to if I doesn’t have to and I get easily tired of the screen”. Later she admitted that she wanted me to write less but then she told that the problem is not that I write frequently and a lot but that she has no time to read this all and text back when she works. I told her that this is okey and that I wouldn’t mind if she texted back after work or called back to discuss what I wrote to her. After this second meeting/date she reluctantly (as before) texted and replied but called me at new year’s eve with wishes. It was the moment we stopped using tinder and started using phones. We never had each other on socials because she wanted to take it slow and was very grateful that I did not insist on moving to socials fast, despite I totally wanted to cause tinder sucks as a communicator. Anyways from this moment we started to text via SMS and get rid of tinder, we totally started to operate via phones. She also asked frequently whether I date with other women (I was not), do my friends know about her, do my family knows about her and so on – all the answers was right and she seemed happy about this. She also stated that her mother is nice so I may have a nice mother-in-law. It is also quite interesting, because she was raised by a single mother and she claimed that she is not very close with her as a mother and that her grandma is more of a mother figure in her life. Anyways, sometime after second meeting I texted her that I found a flat to rent, that I am about to meet with owner and see it and that I may tell her later about how it went. She texted me that she would like to hear about it and then that she would like to highlight that she is interested and thinks about me even though she is so busy right now. I replied that I do know, that I do understand and that she doesn’t have to worry about it, because I know about her hard time at work and that I’m patiently waiting till January. She replied with happiness and relief.

Sometime after this  days I told her that I just rent this flat so soon I would move to the city she lives in. Immediatelly after this she called me (first time since new years eve, it was around January 3th), she congratulated me and she asked how I perceive future of this relationship. I told her that I am enthusiastic about it and that I look at it with hope, she told me that she either and started to sob that she’s completely aware that she may ruin everything due to her perpetual business and that she would like me to know that if it gets ruined this will be only her fault. I told her that everything is alright, that I do know that making a room in your life for a partner isn’t something you do in one day, that I hope it will start getting better when I move in already (she knew that I lived like 20 minutes on foot from her work and from her flat, so meeting would become extremely easy). She once again seemed relieved and told me that she knows it would sound funny cause she had claimed that she didn’t like physical contact but she would love to hug me now. During this call she asked me if we were going to meet in nearest future, but this topic somehow faded away. This was very nice call actually and I felt good with the fact she called, she wanted to meet, she stated that she would love to hug me and so on. The next day I realized that we didn’t schedule a meeting so I texted her and she told that she wanted to schedule one but the subject faded away because she decided it will be easier to schedule when I am already moved in the city. When I moved in I informed her about it and we talked via SMS a lot about some cutely stupid things like that I do like ketchup but hate tomatoes or that she is lactose intolerant, I asked her for opinion about my new backcloth I’m about to buy and so on. Suddenly, out of nowhere, especially in the context of this nice talk we’ve been having, she hit me with something like “\[my name\], I really do appreciate your effort and how much you engaged in this but I beg you to consider every possible course of things because so far I am not sure of anything and I am afraid I will hurt you.” after which she just casually returned to our sweet little smalltalk. I told her that I am completely aware of risks involving dating and that I am totally aware that everything may happen but that I would rather be myself, engage  the way I always do and if it won’t work out between us I would be aware that it failed when I was myself and that I didn’t act like someone I am not. I was expecting her to dump me after her message but she positively shocked me with something like “I am very grateful for this message. Goodnight :\*”. I was totally WTFed. I expected everything but this. She has never before texted me goodnight. She has never before sent me a heart emoji, a kiss emoji or something. And now she does both of this. In THIS exact moment. I was positively shocked.

After this everything was as before, no change in any direction, and few days after this I asked her about her free time in January so we could start seeing each other more regularly. She didn’t tell me anything long-term (like whole January or sth) but she told me that she caught a flu but if I’m not scared by it I could catch her the following day after her work and grab a fast coffee. I agreed and finally we met at her work. She had an idea of me walking her to her place but due to snow and her being ill I proposed to stay inside not to risk her health and that later I could accompany her in her ride home with a bus. She agreed, so we grabbed a coffee. We spent great time together, she grabbed my hand herself and told me things like “it is nice to see you even for 40 minutes” or “my friends asked about you and advised me not to run from this too soon”. Suddenly she asked me if I could be friends with someone I’ve dated. I told her that I could not, that I am too sensitive for this, that It would hurt me, that It would be weird for the next person I would date If I had my ex-date still around and that generally I do not do such things and would like not to. She told me that she know this was a stupid question and then it went very well. We talked about some important things like what we expect from the relationship, what makes us happy and unhappy in relationship and so on. I also told her that she shall know that I am afraid of being rejected and that this correlates with me having anxious attachment style. I would like to highlight here that I’ve been in therapy for almost 2 years, I am working very hard on myself and my therapist claims I do behave like someone with generally healthy attachment style right now. She (the girl I was dating) also stated that I am the only man around whom she feels safe and that I am the only man who’s touch she eagers despite generally not liking it. At the end she decided to return home by taxi, so I told her to let me know when she returns safely and we parted. I’d like to highlight that I always asked her for feedback that she returned home safe, that she always agreed to do so and that she never did. Anyway, I returned home and after some time I asked if she’s home safe. Around midnight she text me that she did return home safely and we started another sweet little smalltalk. Once again she interrupted this sweetness with something like “I would like to tell you sth but I know that you’ll get angry at me”. I asked her to say it and she said “I am afraid that if something doesn’t work out between us in the future I would lost a great friend too…  damn, I fucking hate my concerns…”. I asked her what she meant, is she going to friendzone me and is everything okay between us but she replied with something like “This is not something for texting and especially not in the middle of night. I really gotta go to sleep or I won’t weak up for work tomorrow”. I told her that I understand but I would like to talk about it tomorrow because it seems to be important and I wouldn’t like to left this unsettled. She didn’t text back, proly went to sleep and I totally lost my shit. I panicked. I freaked out. I called 2 my best friends and vented to them. I was totally confused what just happened, why she suggested friendzone when everything was so great today and recently and why did she left me alone with this for whole night after starting this herself.

In the morning she texted that she’s losing her voice due to illness. I replied something dry to this and after some time I sent her long but calm text in which I stated that I am totally confused, that I would like to talk about it and settle it, that I do understand her being at work and ill but also wouldn’t like to be left with this for couple of days and that I am not mad at her and that I believe that this is some misunderstanding we can settle and laugh from and that I do not accuse her of any malicious intents and so on and so on. She replied that she will text or call me after work and then proposed that I could approach her after her work instead. I did so and I was totally convinced that we are going to talk about this situation and rectify it. I was shocked that she started it with “Listen anon, you’re a great man and you will be a great father and husband…”. Long story short she stated that she want to withdraw from this relationship romantically but would like to stay friends, that she isn’t ready for a relationship and bunch of things that didn’t make any sense like “you need to finish your therapy first” (she wasn’t in therapy in the first place and my therapists said there is no problem with me being in relationship while still In therapy) and other things that I suppose was just projecting herself on me cause she was referring to things that I and my therapist would totally tell about her and not me. I also directly told her that she may be avoidant and described the avoidant’s behavior pattern that I totally saw in her but she either denied or just stayed silent. She also insisted that she does it for my own good, that it will benefit me and bunch of other stuff like this that I totally did not buy. Finally she stated that I shall think about this and contact her if I would be interested in being just friends. I told her that I wouldn’t be able to be friends with her and that we either have romantically-based relationship (talking, dating etc.) or no relationship at all.

The next day I had a therapy and talked about it, I thought that I may understand what she meant so I asked her for a phone call and she agreed but it turned out that I was wrong and she meant what she meant. Tbh I didn’t even know that she ended this all the previous day and she notified me about this directly the day I called her. We talked for a while, I tried to show her my point of view and what I learnt during therapy, she totally denied it all and still tried to explain to me why she doing it for my benefit and so on. In the end she got almost mad and asked why I do not understand that she’s doing it for me blah blah blah, I told her that I do not understand it cause it doesn’t make any healthy sense. After this we calmly decided that we do not have anything more to say to each other so we wished each other the very best and ended the call. After few hours she phoned me again out of sudden, she had crying voice, I asked her about it but she claimed it was due to her illness, she told me that she wanted to thank me and that she wishes me the best and that she thinks that she made a right decision. I told her that if she thinks so and if she is at peace with herself thanks to it then I am glad she made this decision even if I do not agree with this and with the reality that this decision creates for me. Then we once again thanked ourselves for everything, said lots of goodbyes, byes and so on and finally hung up. Few days after this I texted her despite I’ve never ever done sth like this since I was like 17. I told her that I know this is stupid but I miss her and that everything reminds me of her, which was true. She texted back after few hours that she is thankful for a kind text and that I will manage to deal with it and that I shall give myself time. I didn’t texted back and tomorrow’s gonna be a week from this text and almost 2 weeks from the day she dumped me.

My algorithm on socials started to show me content about avoidant partners and everything fits her so well I am almost sure she was an avoidant, my therapist also thinks so but I wanted to share this story with you and maybe get some feedback from you either. I also wonder: shall I expect her to reach out for me again? Shall I reach out for her in 3 or 6 months? or shall I forget about her? I totally do not know what to do and do not understand what happened even though I generally understand majority of avoidants patterns and so on.",1,1737742379.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False

What neighborhoods would you recommend for someone who loves exploring on foot, grabbing coffee at local spots, and browsing unique stores? Bonus points if there’s good green space nearby!

Also, if you have specific recommendations for cafes or shops I should check out, please share. I’d love to start building a list for when I get there.

I have adhd and because of that I have a new hobby or interest each week .

I've tried to help her get out of said marriage, but she insists that if the divorce doesn't go 100% like she wants it to (aka smooth sailing and she gets full custody of her kids), then she'll take her own life. She says this often. I'm not a fan of it. That's an example of how unhealthy these conversations can be.

Here is the problem at hand. We were at my house recently, discussing our parents. I expressed my frustration about the situation: I love my parents even though we don't have a relationship, and I would prefer that they not suffer slowly and die horribly. It's hard not to be a little angry at my mother, for the fact that she's making the end of my father's life so much more stressful and difficult. 

Hope did not like my take. She insisted that it was apathetic toward our mother, and when I tried to explain that I am empathetic, I'm just *also* frustrated, she wasn't having it. 

Hope told me that I needed to be more empathetic like she is. This was her example of her empathy: six months ago, a child in our area died in an accident. I didn't know the child. Hope met her a small handful of times over the last half-decade or so, because she has her own kids around the same age. It was an awful situation, and I will not deny that. The mother of the child has been posting to Facebook about how she wants to take her own life, and my sister has sort of been obsessing over it. She's vehemently in support of the mother's posting (which worries me- I don't think the mother should be posting these things to Facebook personally), to the point that she reached out to the woman and told her that she should keep posting about it. 

In addition, my sister has been crying over the child. Every single day, for six months now. She put herself up on a pedestal about this, essentially saying that she was empathizing ""the right way"" by allowing it to cripple her. 

Now, I try not to snap at Hope. I don't tend to put my foot down or call her out in general, because I worry about her flipping out over it. As a result, we don't often have disagreements about things. I voiced to her that I thought this was very unhealthy behavior. It's good to empathize, but I don't see this as empathy. I think she needs to stop reading this mother's posts and work on developing coping mechanisms with her therapist. I was calm and did not yell. 

Hope lost it on me. She told me that I was putting a toxic spin on her kindness, that I was heartless and had no empathy for her or for anyone. She went so far as to say that she didn't want a relationship with someone who sees her as unhealthy and ended our relationship altogether. We had a long back and forth where she hurled insults and gave me no opportunity to slow things down. Very out of character for her. 

This came as a huge shock. We have been exceptionally close over the last five years. My husband (M 25) and I see her children as our own, that is how close we are. But Hope would not listen to reason. She left and has not spoken to me in over a week. With my family trauma, my heart has taken a beating. If Hope comes back and tries to apologize (which I am 99% sure will happen), I honestly don't know what I'll do, because I've done this song and dance with my other family members and I'm sick of it. And Hope knows this. 

Maybe I shouldn't have been so upfront about my feelings like that. And I may have triggered her by calling her unhealthy. I'm not sure. It's a very difficult relationship to navigate, so I wanted an outside opinion. ",1,1737741735.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

It is fascinating to me that I would surround myself with the cacophony of voices to find comfort. And while I feel a deep connection to everyone around me, and consistently do, there is still something inside of me that rages at every person here. I have no issue with any particular person, no one has done anything to me, but me. They are all living their lives, minding their own business and trying to find peace in this world just like I am.  

I suppose it could be the defensiveness to which I have subscribed for the last 2 months; its a considerable culprit. But it also seems to be my general attitude towards humanity. Over the last few months, I have seen how quickly people will jump on other’s suffering, including my own, disguised as “opportunity.” This is nothing new, in fact one of the first tactics you learn in a sales job is that every problem for the customer is an opportunity for you. The intent behind these trainings is to ensure that the person selling receives a personal reward for taking advantage of a situation. Of course this is standard operating procedure in the principle of behaviorism. Bell rings, dog salivates in anticipation of reward. But something always felt very dark about that. Taking advantage of fear, sadness, general discontent, or even hunger to leverage a personal reward; seems a little shady to me at the very least and downright shameful at worst.  

I was always told that my perspective needed to change. I needed to find a way to spin it positive. We are doing the customer a service, so it’s not that bad. This was also a lame argument as well. The entire premise of taking advantage of others is something deemed deplorable by most of modern society, until it’s business. This is the difference between ethical, moral behavior and choosing against it. If money is involved, it’s just business. No one should be offended.  

And still I was offended, because for whatever reason when I would sit across from Mr. And Mrs. Homeowner and show them a $50k contract, pressured them to sign, took a check, it and still felt like taking advantage. Every sale, every signature, every platitude to nullify their objections felt like an inherent lie, even if logically it wasn’t. In new spiritual speak, it didn’t resonate with me. 

So why do other people find this so easy to do? There seems to be all rationale on their side, and I’m just being a judgmental prick. And yet, I can no longer bring myself to be this person, and even when I take the jobs I apply for in sales or sales management, my soul seems to scream out in pain against it. I find myself quitting positions I get in sales and am outright rejected from sales management jobs even though I have plenty of experience and success in that field. Why is there a twist away from these possibilities? I cannot engage with the mindset of self-gain anymore. This doesn’t mean I don’t want money; I really do. I like Money a lot, just like anyone else. But if my money isn’t going to serve someone other than myself, I don’t go after it. The extra dollar just for me, the grind mindset to set myself apart, away from the “common folk”; that desire has died.  

I would also love to sit here and say that I have no judgement of it when other people carry that mindset, but that would be a lie as well. I shut down when people take me on a tour of their financial success. “Look at this new thing I bought; I’m really about quality not quantity; I bought this because I really needed it for X reason.” You know what? I’ve been there; I did that too. I’m not guiltless from this perspective or action. For 3 years, from 2020 – 2023 I did everything I could to buy my happiness. I could not feel anything other than the joy of a purchase. I felt myself peeling away from the happiness of playing with my kids, or going outside, or being engaged in any sort of social circle. I just tried to buy everything and insulate myself with my purchases from the world that didn’t understand me.  

I see this now my closest friends and peers; so many of us are working to continue the ongoing material wealth that is perpetuated mindlessly by our lack of self-worth and adequate time to appreciate anything. This is the biggest issue I have identified in the last year. We are expected to devote 45-55 hours a week into a career that will have a negligible net benefit to anything long term and ultimately takes us away from the people and places where we genuinely want to spend our time. Even now, the productivity space has been commodified; buy this app, this journal, this planner to get more of your time back. I found that most of these items required just as much upkeep as anything else, the maintenance of which continued to take me away from being in the moment. The perpetual planning of my life was destroying my creativity and desire to be a part of the whole. I could never live in the present because I was always planning for the future. And then there was the debrief of the day, looking to the past for my inefficiencies to better predict my patterns of behavior moving forward. I was a great analyst, for my own life, and the businesses I worked for because I could do this task more quickly and efficiently than anyone I came up against. Competitive productivity became my new game, and the reward was all the shit that I had accumulated in my garage. God damn, I had a lot of boxes.  

This was a skill, like any other, that has/had its benefits and costs. When you spend the majority of your time thinking about productivity, everything in your life becomes about productivity. I remember days when I would sit and pass judgement on my wife, and even my young 7-year-old son because their productivity did not meet my standard. Too many clothes on the floor to wash, well you’re not organizing or planning well enough. Dinner not done by 6 PM, well it’s because you didn’t prepare better. You missed and appointment, well it’s because you didn’t have it written down. I was constantly appraising the value of the help I received from my own family, while ignoring the love and patience they consistently showed me.  

I think I understand now why I enjoy the chaos, the noise, and the voices all over. I can’t think in that space; I’m forced to face my own consciousness. Watching these people around me converse and have relationships with each other is a blessing because I can be invisible in a space while not having to think about what anyone is saying or doing. I’m having relationships through osmosis; occasionally tapping into a conversation here and there. I can sit here and write this without interruption, whether from other people or my own thoughts.  

This is also simultaneously why I am angry and hateful; I’m jealous of them. This isn’t about them. It was never about them, you neurotic fuck (talking to myself here). While you sat there and blamed everyone for your negative view of people because of “sales tactics” and materialism, the real reason you are angry is you don’t feel connected to them, often to anyone. You spend so much of your time trying to be elitist, to knowing better than they do, than trying to build bridges. You keep trying to escape something that you know already exists right here. You remember having these connections. You remember high school and feeling a part of the team. You remember the early days at Groundworks where your people loved you, and you loved them, and you would do anything for them. Stop denying your own materialism. Stop denying your desire for wealth, money, and power. You’re a fucking human too. Own it. Use it. And grow through it.  

The table in front of me that had a group of 8-10 sitting and chatting has now left. There are still groups of people in this coffee shop, carrying on their conversations like I was never here. Noise from the chatter and the constant shuffling of tin and metal mixers, cups, and utensils peppers the occasional quieting, the gaps in conversation, the lost train of thought. There is a bible study group in the closed meeting room in front of me. People have been chatting about the bible for hundreds of years now, what more could there be to talk about? 

And yet, here I am, alone, wishing I could be in that room with them. I may not have anything to say, but the joy of hearing people share their ideas feels good to me. I miss that, more than anything about my job. I miss sharing ideas. But if I’m going to spend my time thinking about how everyone’s ideas but mine are dumb, selfish, and stupid, of course I’m not going to be allowed to share mine, because I’m the genius, and no one can understand me. I have been hurt enough by being rejected by jobs, friends, and people around me. Why should I continue to try? 

Because I’m human too. As much as I try to avoid that fact, it’s the truth, or at least part of it. So, while I sit here in judgement of materialism, other people, and their bat shit thoughts, I want to hear their bat shit thoughts. There is no ultimate positive, no ultimate negative, there just is, and are, the thoughts and actions of us and others. Each thought and action has a benefit, and a flipside cost. Both are true, both are paradoxical.  

I think until we understand that, we cannot advance as a society or a species. We must be able to acknowledge that for everything we do, every action we take, whether the intent is positive or negative, we must own the results and consequences. I see people, constantly, able to take actions that they feel are the most benefical to themselves and the other, but what results is something so broken, and even sinister, that they detach themselves from the decision at all. And I see the people who are truly heroic; taking those consequences and attempting to spin positivity out of them to squeeze out benefit for everyone. But until the initial decision maker owns up to the action, the action will keep being taken. There doesn’t need to be judgement, just observation, love, learning, and appreciation.  

Voices and noise. I just want to be a part of the conversation. I don’t want to be entropy. I am not entropy.  ",1,1737741448.0,DiaryOfARedditor,0,1.0,False

Hey there! 😊

I’m a 28-year-old from Europe, and I’m here looking for a connection that feels authentic—something built on shared understanding, good conversations, and maybe even a little magic. Whether we start with a friendly chat or dive into the bigger questions of life, I’m open to seeing where the journey takes us.

# A Bit About Me

* **Who I Am:** I’m a writer at heart—someone who’s fascinated by the world’s little details and always looking to capture its fleeting moments in words. I believe there’s poetry in everyday life if you look close enough. I’d describe myself as curious, introspective, and quietly optimistic.
* **My Interests:**
   * **Music:** I’m on a journey to become a vinyl collector (once I have the space for it!). I love crafting playlists that feel like soundtracks to moments in life, and I’m always hunting for new tracks that speak to the soul.
   * **Nature and Exploration:** Whether it’s hiking to catch a golden-hour view, wandering unfamiliar streets, or just stargazing on a clear night, I’m happiest when I’m exploring.
   * **Creativity:** I’ve been dabbling in photography lately, trying to turn fleeting scenes into lasting memories. Writing has always been my first love, but this new creative outlet is giving it some competition.
   * **Gaming and Relaxing:** On quieter days, I enjoy diving into a good game or settling in for a movie marathon—it’s all about balance, right?

# What I’m Looking For

I’m hoping to meet someone who’s as curious about life as I am. Here’s what I’d love in a partner:

* **Kindness:** You lead with your heart and care about the people around you. You’re the kind of person who finds joy in small gestures and values connection over pretense.
* **Curiosity:** You see the world as a big, wonderful puzzle to explore—whether that’s through travel, learning something new, or simply seeing the beauty in the everyday.
* **Openness:** Life is full of surprises, and you’re not afraid to embrace them. You’re willing to share your dreams, your quirks, and maybe even your favorite coffee order.
* **Partnership:** Someone who wants to build something together—a shared world full of laughter, quiet moments, and spontaneous adventures.

# Why Message Me?

I’d like to think I bring a unique mix of thoughtfulness and enthusiasm to the table. I’ll remember the little things about you—the way your favorite song makes you smile, the dreams you’re too shy to share, or the stories that light up your eyes. I’m loyal, steady, and the kind of person who shows up for the big moments and the small ones.

I believe in the magic of connection. Whether it’s through a shared playlist, a midnight chat, or a day spent exploring something new, I want to create moments that matter—moments that turn into memories we’ll always carry.

# Let’s Start a Story

If any of this resonates, send me a message. Let’s talk about music, share our favorite books, or dream up an imaginary trip to the most beautiful place we can think of. Or maybe we’ll just start with “hello” and see where the conversation takes us.

Every story starts with a single step—this could be ours. Looking forward to hearing from you. 😊",2,1737741442.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

1i91izp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1i91izp/fragile_need_supportadvice/,"fragile, need support/advice","I’ve been really fragile lately and could use some support. My EMDR therapist was previously doing weekly sessions with me but has encountered some medical issues and so our sessions have become relatively infrequent. She’s currently biweekly at best, though I’ve only seen her twice in the last 2 months thanks to holiday confusion. Seemingly her schedule is stabilizing, though our day and time is changing around and it’s still biweekly going forward, which doesn’t feel great. 

In the meantime I’ve really been struggling. I had to take a partial hospitalization after a family emergency in November had me having multiple panic attacks in a week and I’ve since come back from that but I’m not where I was before the emergency either. I’ve had to take anxiety meds more often, and I had a panic attack the other day over something super small. I’ve had trouble focusing at work, especially last week when I wasn’t able to get my Adderall prescription thanks to resurgent shortages in my area, and I keep feeling that awful tightness in my gut that tells me something is wrong. I feel like someone is over my shoulder, like everything’s gonna come crashing down in an instant. I’m doing my best to avoid the news but as a trans person right now I feel really vulnerable in ways that are nearly impossible to sit with. 

Today, my glasses broke, and I had to do another whole set of breathing exercises *and* take an anxiety pill to avoid a panic attack. I had to make multiple phone calls and make plans to get my glasses fixed and plans for what I do while they’re being repaired and it felt very hard to do that. Brain fog has been a consistent companion as of late. 

I’m having nightmares more often, too. Nightmares where the family trauma and the political drama of the day bleed together in this horrible miasma where I can’t find any safe place amidst a hostile world. 

Little things send me spiraling. The panic attack the other day was about a zipper on my jacket being stuck—I felt trapped, like I couldn’t get it off. I spilled coffee last weekend and it made me break into a hard sob. My glasses broke and I’m having to work to avoid panic. I regularly have to ask my partners whether or not they’re mad at me, because I’m always worried that they are. 

I don’t know what I need to do to stabilize. I feel like my medication dosages are all wrong for what I’m going through but I don’t have a psychiatrist right now—my GP has been handling refills on my existing dosages while I’ve still got them, and the partial program got me on an anxiety med, but I don’t have a regular provider that can review my intake, and finding one has been an absolute mess, and feels particularly difficult to do when I’m already in a fragile state. 

I’m tired of being so fragile. I’m tired of having emotional flashbacks at every turn. I’m tired of having to ask my wife to tell me that no one’s going to hit me for the smallest mistakes. I don’t know what I need to do to feel okay, and I fear that things are only going to get worse as my therapist continues to change our schedule around and the governmental situation becomes increasingly hostile towards trans women like myself. 

I feel guilty asking my therapist for more. I love her to death, and EMDR has been incredibly helpful lately, but the instability clearly isn’t working for me and I feel it’s not my place to ask for something different. I’m also scared that I’m not going to be able to find a provider like her, one that is informed on childhood sexual abuse, that is queer inclusive, and that is knowledgeable about and caring towards dissociative identity disorders. 

What should I do? What can I do to try and make myself feel okay? How can I be more resilient against the external pressures, big and small? How do I let myself breathe, and how do I care for myself? What should I be asking for?",1,1737741416.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

I’ve had to take anxiety meds more often, and I had a panic attack the other day over something super small. I’ve had trouble focusing at work, especially last week when I wasn’t able to get my Adderall prescription thanks to resurgent shortages in my area, and I keep feeling that awful tightness in my gut that tells me something is wrong. I feel like someone is over my shoulder, like everything’s gonna come crashing down in an instant. I’m doing my best to avoid the news but as a trans person right now I feel really vulnerable in ways that are nearly impossible to sit with. 

Today, my glasses broke, and I had to do another whole set of breathing exercises *and* take an anxiety pill to avoid a panic attack. I had to make multiple phone calls and make plans to get my glasses fixed and plans for what I do while they’re being repaired and it felt very hard to do that. Brain fog has been a consistent companion as of late. 

I’m having nightmares more often, too. Nightmares where the family trauma and the political drama of the day bleed together in this horrible miasma where I can’t find any safe place amidst a hostile world. 

Little things send me spiraling. The panic attack the other day was about a zipper on my jacket being stuck—I felt trapped, like I couldn’t get it off. I spilled coffee last weekend and it made me break into a hard sob. My glasses broke and I’m having to work to avoid panic. I regularly have to ask my partners whether or not they’re mad at me, because I’m always worried that they are. 

I don’t know what I need to do to stabilize. I feel like my medication dosages are all wrong for what I’m going through but I don’t have a psychiatrist right now—my GP has been handling refills on my existing dosages while I’ve still got them, and the partial program got me on an anxiety med, but I don’t have a regular provider that can review my intake, and finding one has been an absolute mess, and feels particularly difficult to do when I’m already in a fragile state. 

I’m tired of being so fragile. I’m tired of having emotional flashbacks at every turn. I’m tired of having to ask my wife to tell me that no one’s going to hit me for the smallest mistakes. I don’t know what I need to do to feel okay, and I fear that things are only going to get worse as my therapist continues to change our schedule around and the governmental situation becomes increasingly hostile towards trans women like myself. 

I feel guilty asking my therapist for more. I love her to death, and EMDR has been incredibly helpful lately, but the instability clearly isn’t working for me and I feel it’s not my place to ask for something different. I’m also scared that I’m not going to be able to find a provider like her, one that is informed on childhood sexual abuse, that is queer inclusive, and that is knowledgeable about and caring towards dissociative identity disorders. 

What should I do? What can I do to try and make myself feel okay? How can I be more resilient against the external pressures, big and small? How do I let myself breathe, and how do I care for myself? What should I be asking for?",1,1737741346.0,EMDR,0,1.0,False

I just got my first apartment in Madison, WI where I’m about to start my first full time job. I feel paralyzed with anxiety when it comes to furnishing the space and need some help thinking of what color schemes and just overall ideas. I’d like to stay under $3,000 if possible. My roommate has said that he likes a midcentury vibe, but I really can’t imagine myself allowing him to put a leather couch in the space. Perhaps a midcentury modern style is more feasible? Honestly the space is very new and I don’t want it to feel like my grandparent’s home. I need barstools, a couch, TV, coffee table, etc. but don’t want to go out and buy anything before I get some other opinions as I’ve heard your barstools should match your couch?

Please see the pictures of my new space attached and ignore my various belongings strewn on the floor (I just got the keys this morning!). Also the collapsible chair in the picture is just there so I have a place to sit until I figure out what I’m doing!

Day 1-5
- worst anxiety of my life
- panic attacks
- insomnia
- s***idal
- not worth it
- headaches, bodyaches, fatigue

Day 5- Day 15
- things start getting better
- more stable appetite? I get hungry after waking up, around 1 pm, around 5 pm before workout and after workout dinner
- sleeping like a fucking log. 7-9 hours undisturbed sleep
- started incorporating sunlight in mornings for energy instead. It works. Still can’t believe it works
- started reducing sugar also
- still wanted caffeine. I was missing the routine of going to office and getting a warm cup of coffee. Replaced by filling cold water in bottle and drinking instead. Very refreshing. 

Day 15+
- Not as stressed. Honestly I used to lose my shit over everything. Now I’m so much more.. sane?
- Sometimes when things get hectic I wanna have coffee and “handle it”. The ol’ excuses of the addict. This time around I just dropped few things and set boundaries. Worked wonders
- i don’t know if quitting caffeine helped sugar withdrawal or reducing and eventually quitting sugar helped with caffeine withdrawal but god it has just worked
- main energiser: meaningful social connection 
- still working on focus
- poop schedule is fixed without coffee!!

Because of this he’s asked me to do more chores since I’m home more. I do our laundry together, I keep the room clean( I’ve been on strike cause he can’t clean up after himself) I wake up in the morning to get us coffee. Usually when he asks me to get him something it’s easy, like pbj, cereal, cofffee. But when I say no I don’t feel like it, he just can’t take it for an answer. He will ask me over and over, he’ll complain how tired he is or make up reasons why I owe him til I give in. I’m mad at myself for giving in so often. I’ve never in my life been served like I’ve served him. He grew up with a bunch of women babying him and making special food for him. I don’t see it as my love language, but I do it for him anyway. He’s always super happy and grateful when I make him stuff. I just never saw myself serving a man almost everyday. It makes me feel bad about myself. And we’ve argued about it a few times now, so he’s asking less and I’m not asking for rides. One time I said no sandwich he started saying he dosnt have to bring me everywhere he goes then. Like oh no I can’t go to the bank with you because I didn’t do what you wanted. It was just weird, he was trying to find something he could take away from me. Every time I say no it’s a problem. 

This morning I said no I don’t wanna make coffee, he said “ I told my boss about you not making me stuff anymore and he said two can play at that game.” This isn’t a game for me, this is him disregarding how I feel. When I first moved in his mom would make him lunch for work and tea in the morning, and it used to weird me out, but I’m not close with my mom so idk if it’s a normal sweet thing and I’m a weenie. I’ve gotten in my head about it a lot, ew I feel like his mom replacement. I don’t see myself doing this forever, I’m trying to set boundaries. I’m trying my best to get a full time job so we can be equal in this relationship. I just wanna know if maybe I’m thinking way too much about it and making myself feel bad.

The Bastard Provocateur

### **Chapter X: The Silent War**     
     
The air in Casa Montalvo’s private study was heavy with the scent of old leather and freshly brewed coffee. Sebastián Montalvo y Estrella sat behind a carved mahogany desk, reviewing a stack of financial reports. Across from him stood Martín Montalvo, his cousin and the family’s representative in the Puerto Rican Banking Guild.

Martín adjusted his glasses, his tone professional but edged with concern.

Martín:
“We’ve traced some of the funding for Aleida Soria’s operations. It’s routed through dummy corporations tied to the North American Trade Federation. They’re funneling resources into her network, likely to destabilize Mars and the Aegis Accord.”

Sebastián leaned back, steepling his fingers. “And our response?”

Martín:
“We’re leveraging our partnerships. The Montalvo family banks are discreetly tightening credit for businesses with ties to the Federation. Additionally, our allies in the guild are conducting a quiet audit of suspect transactions. It’s slow work, but we’ll cut off her resources.”

Sebastián nodded. “Good. The more isolated she becomes, the fewer options she’ll have. But we need to move faster. Soria’s privateers are growing bolder by the day.”


---

The Banking Guild

Martín opened a leather-bound ledger, its pages filled with elegant script detailing the accounts and assets of the Montalvo family and their partners.

Martín:
“The Guild’s leading families are on board—Ramos, Vélez, and Del Valle have pledged their support. They see the consolidation of the Bayamón district as an opportunity to strengthen the Crown’s influence and stabilize the island’s economy. If we can finalize the duchy’s incorporation, we’ll have the financial leverage to counter Soria’s disruptions.”

Sebastián studied the ledger, his mind racing through the implications. The Bayamón Duchy would be a cornerstone of Puerto Rico’s expanding governance model, but it also represented a delicate balance of power.

Sebastián:
“And the Duke? Have we settled on a candidate?”

Martín hesitated. “There’s been talk of naming one of the Del Valle sons. They’re well-regarded, and their family has a history of loyalty to the Crown. But some of the other families are pushing for an outsider—someone without ties to the old networks.”

Sebastián frowned. “The wrong choice could alienate key allies. But if we choose someone too connected, we risk entrenching the very systems we’re trying to reform.”


---

A Calculated Gamble

Sebastián’s thoughts were interrupted by a secure call from Director Elena Morales. Her face appeared on a nearby screen, her expression focused but weary.

Elena:
“We’ve made progress on Soria. Her privateers are operating out of a series of hidden bases in the asteroid belt. The funding trails we’ve been following match Martín’s reports—they lead straight to the North American Trade Federation.”

Sebastián leaned forward. “And Soria herself?”

Elena:
“She’s been careful, but we’ve tracked her to a station near Ceres. It’s heavily fortified, and she’s surrounded by loyalists. Taking her down won’t be easy.”

Sebastián:
“Then we hit her where it hurts. Cut off her funding, disrupt her supply lines, and force her to make a move. If we can destabilize her network, she’ll have no choice but to surface.”

Elena nodded. “I’ll coordinate with Martín and the Guild. But Sebastián, we’re running out of time. If Soria consolidates her position, the Federation will use her as a foothold to undermine everything we’ve built.”


---

The Bayamón Duchy

That evening, Sebastián convened a meeting with the Montalvo family’s closest banking partners. The discussion centered on the final steps for incorporating the Bayamón district as a duchy.

Martín:
“The numbers are solid. The duchy’s revenue streams—ports, manufacturing, and agriculture—are more than enough to sustain its governance. But the transition will require significant upfront investment, particularly in infrastructure.”

Sebastián:
“Then we make the investment. The duchy isn’t just about economics—it’s a symbol of stability and progress. If we can make Bayamón a model for the other districts, it will strengthen the Crown’s legitimacy.”

The room buzzed with quiet agreement. Among the attendees were representatives of the Ramos and Vélez families, as well as a new face—Victoria Quintana, a sharp-eyed woman who had recently risen to prominence in the Guild.

Victoria:
“If I may, Governor, the success of this venture depends on more than just numbers. We need to ensure the people see the duchy as a benefit, not an imposition. That means transparency, accountability, and tangible improvements in their daily lives.”

Sebastián smiled faintly. “Spoken like someone who understands the stakes. You’re absolutely right, Victoria. And that’s why this has to be done carefully. The people must feel the change, not just see it on paper.”


---

As the meeting concluded, Sebastián pulled Martín aside.

Sebastián:
“Keep the pressure on Soria’s network. We can’t let her use this transition to her advantage.”

Martín:
“I’ll do what I can, but Sebastián… be careful. Soria isn’t just a threat to the colony or the Accord. She’s a threat to you. She knows how to exploit vulnerabilities, and she won’t hesitate to do so.”

Sebastián’s gaze hardened. “Then we give her no openings. This isn’t just a battle for Mars—it’s a battle for the future. And I intend to win.”

Do NOT go into your local Starbucks from now until the 27th and request an empty hot cup.

Don't sit inside your local Starbucks and pull it out to make it seem like you made a purchase! We are absolutely watching every single customer as all times because we have ALL the time in the world, so we will DEFINITELY notice. If a barista comes and asks you to purchase something definitely DON'T show them your coffee cup and politely assert that you already made a purchase. Definitely don't use this to get into the bathroom either. Don't take your empty coffee cup in hand and go up to the counter to request a Trenta water.

If a barista gets suspicious of you, definitely DON'T purchase a cream cheese for $1.00, an avocado spread for $1.25, or a bag of butter popcorn for $1.50 (some of our cheapest items) so you can stay as long as you want. And please know that we were instructed to police EVERY PERSON that asks to use the bathroom. So please DON'T tell us that you'll buy something after you use the bathroom, and then leave right after, because we'll definitely do something about it! ;>

In all seriousness, I despise these rules. Not only are they blatantly unethical, I refuse to do this company's dirty work. If you choose to do any of this, just don't give your local barista's a hard time. Most of us hate these rules and don't agree with them, but also don't wanna lose our jobs. If you're asked to make a purchase or leave, be peaceful about it. Otherwise, stay smart, stay safe, and stay kind please!!

This is about my coworker who's 20 years older than me, I will call him A. to make this story simpler.. I'm in my 20's and he's in his 40's. 
First of all I know the sayings about don't shit where you eat"" etc.

I have known him for over 3 years. In the beginning we didn't even talk much, I found him a bit intimidating and I'm pretty sure he didn't had any interest to get to know a younger coworker better. 

After one year at my job, another coworker of mine let's call him B. joint our team. He's probably 50 years old but we definitely clicked. We became great work buddies. B. was very social and befriended A. After a few months of B. and me working together, A. joined our daily coffee meetings and we started talking too.

I found out that A. was very funny in a sarcastic way and after a few weeks when B. wasn't around (sick, vacation, meetings) we went to grab coffee together alone.

I didn't see him in any romantic lighting, just as a coffee buddy. At one point my team started to meet after work to go out to grab some drinks every Friday, this was some bonding we thought would help us to work better. 

I joined my team and A. and B. talked even more with me and we definitely enjoyed our time every Friday.

We became a well known trio in our office. We laughed and did great work together until I decided to go back to school to get my master degree. 
I told A. and B. about that and B. replied that if I leave, he would leave too. He wanted something knew and did apply to get another job in our company which transferred him to a different part of town. 

I was sad for A. because both of us were leaving him alone, before we parted ways we said we should meet for drinks every second Friday.

A., B., and I met almost every second Friday through that year until I graduated and went back to work.

This time A. and I were alone. We did pick up there where we left it off one year prior.
We acted like nothing changed but our other coworkers started talking about us a few weeks later that we were seeing each other/ hooking up. 
It made some things really awkward at first. We both talked about how crazy our coworkers were and that we just grew a friendship in those 2 years that we knew each other.

We continued our 2. week ritual with B. after work. We told him about our crazy coworkers and about what they were saying. 
B. laughed and said we should put oil in that fire as a joke how insane our coworkers were and just joke with them about us.

A. and I. grew even closer through those weeks. Most people were talking about us and not with us which only made our coffee machine meetings more important.
One week we had a bad day and thought we should go out for drinks after work to calm down. It wasn't a Friday so we didn't ask B. Especially since he has a family and most likely didn't have time for our spontaneous meeting.

This situation occurred more often and A. and I ended up meeting daily after work. We talked for hours and repeated it for weeks. Him and I had so much fun spending time together as friends but we kept it a secret. Probably scared how our coworkers would react after all those rumours that already went through our office.

We continued to meet B. but at one point we just kept quiet about meeting after work without him, we felt bad that we spent so much time without him but we knew he wouldn't join us more than every 2. week.

A. went on vacation and I was alone for the first time after starting work again. I was fine the first week but the second one I started to miss him a bit. I started to think about him more often but I didn't message him because I wanted him to enjoy his vacation without any work related things disturbing him.

After his vacation we continued to spend even more time, we meet daily and we joked about how we didn't get sick of each other. 

A few months ago we thought that we could meet on one weekend too, I invited him to my place and we just talked, drank and listened to music until he went to sleep on my sofa and I went to sleep in my room.

I started to think about A. in a more romantic way during these weeks but I ignored it because I thought this was just because we spent so much time together. We were basically 15-18 hours together during work and after work for months. 

Our coworkers just didn't stop making comments about us which we rolled our eyes about. They didn't even know how often we met after work but the comments how we behaved at work were all they needed to make us feel awkward.

Last month our Christmas Party happened and our company went out for dinner. Afterwards we went to the clubs. 
Like always A. and me spent the whole evening together. We were drunk and laughed pretty much all night, we went outside to smoke another cigarette when he put his hand on my waist to guide me outside. He lives on the opposite side of town so I asked him if he'd like to stay at my place for a couple of more drinks.
He agreed and after all our coworkers left we called a taxi. 
We had one more beer and talked till 5 a.m. before we went to sleep. He on my sofa and I went to sleep in my bed like we did once before.

The next day I drove him home, knowing full well I wouldn't see him for the next 3 weeks because of the holidays.
This time I missed him a lot and I thought about him daily. I didn't text him expect for wishing him Merry Christmas. He called me 2 days later telling me he drove too fast and he had to take 4 weeks off of work because the police stopped him.

I told him that I was a bit sad not seeing him for one whole month already sad that I hadn't seen him in 2 weeks by that time. 
He said he would probably take those 4 weeks in April. I replied that he at least could go on vacation during that time, to what he replied with that none of his friends had time in April. After a second of thinking, he asked me if I would consider going on vacation with him in April. He caught me of guard and I replied that I would speak with him about it in person when we meet again.

I was hesitant at first, I definitely liked A. but this could ruin our strong friendship. After a few days thinking about it, I wasn't debating if I should go, only where we should go. 

After our long vacation time we met at work again and we started off where we left off and we met after work for drinks. I asked him if the vacation topic he mentioned on the phone was still on the table and he said yes, his offer still stayed. I told him I would be up for that and so we made a plan to meet on the weekend to plan our trip.

Now we arrive to last weekend. This is the thing where I need help with. 

I probably left out how often our eyes look for each other's at work, how often he pokes my side, tickles me and how often we joke around. To be fair I understand why my coworkers think that we are in a relationship.

Well this evening started like any other. He arrived and we decided to order food. I was nervous which never really happens around him but I definitely blushed a bit and stuttered around in the first 30 minutes. We drank some beers, ate our food and afterwards I set down next to him on the table. We looked for a good country for our vacation in April and after 1 hour we had our 7 day trip booked. 

We continued drinking and at one point, I'm not sure how it happened because of the amount of alcohol we ended up cuddling on my sofa. I know that I somehow made that move on him. I wanted to be closer to him, he was definitely enjoying it to. I was laying on his chest, my arm around him, my leg over his legs and his hand on my butt. 
We both were very drunk at this point. I somehow came up with horoscopes (which I hate and don't believe in) but in our drunken state he read through them. Looking if we were compatible and laughing about the stuff that was written. We were super tired. Around 5 a.m. 
He asked me where he should sleep and I told him that we could train for our upcoming vacation and sleep in the same bed. 

He and I walked to my bedroom, we changed clothes infront of each other and went to sleep in my bed. Nothing happened expect my cold feet touching his which he reminds me of till this day to mess with me.

Next morning I woke up, I turned my head and saw him which I didn't expect at first until the memories hitted me again. 

We slept till 3 p.m. somehow we managed to get out of bed, we behaved like we always do just very tried. No one mentioned the night prior but it wasn't awkward.

He left my apartment and I went back to sleep.

On Monday I was scared shitless. I was scared that I ruined our friendship and how we would acted around each other, when I saw him he laughed and seemed happy. He was joking around and when no coworker was around he mentioned my cold feet and made jokes about horoscopes. 
I was still not feeling good after that weekend and that alcohol that's why I felt a bit cold towards him eventho he acted very nice.

On Tuesday we met after work, I thought we would talk about the elefant in the room. We didn't. We laughed, kept it casual. We were standing closer together. He talked about our evening, he said I was his property referring to a joke at work but we didn't seem to find a way to talk about that night and what it meant.

This continued the whole week. I saw a dog and said: ""Ohhh he's so handsome."" and he replied with: ""I hope you mean the dog and not it's owner."" I started laughing and we continued our game of being flirty and friendly like always. 

We definitely sit even closer together and we touch each other's sides, shoulders, waist's, hand's more often than we already did before last weekend but we are still not talking about the night at a level that might tell me what he feels.

Yesterday we went for a coffee break again and we met B. He was in our office break room after a meeting he had. We were happy to see him and we started talking.
At one point B. said in a joking matter that since he is gone he hopes A. took care of me. A. and I both looked at each other. B. continued with how he hopes we would grow even closer together so we had someone on work to rely on. 
A. definitely was holding back how close we already became because we knew B. didn't mean it in that way and how he worded it. 

After B. left me and A. looked at each other. We both were awkwardly laughing about that situation and how innocent B. thought our coworker friendship is. 
A. asked me if we should tell B. about our vacation. I told him that it's up to him.

Now to come back to my question. Do you think A. could like me or is this just a weird friendship that we both have, I definitely feel a spark every time we touch but except for last weekend, I didn't act on it and I will not continue acting on it until we talk about that night properly.

How does this story and his behaviour sounds to you guys?

Step 1 —> passed june 2023 
Step 2 —> 262 jan 2025

Resources 

- Uworld 
- Cms forms
- Divine 
- Amboss
- Youtube 
- Nbmes 

Started with Uworld random non timed initially doing about 20 q per day due to my med school finals which lasted till jan 2024. Tha goal during this period is to try retaining as much as possible from step 1 and not having a big gap. 

After my med school finals i started doing 40-60 q per day finished my first pass with 67% 

Took amboss free assessment

At that point some where around april I realized i had defects in psych and obgyn so i began doing cms forms for these subjects which improved my performance.
Started my 2nd Uworld pass and took nbmes 6,7,8 (don’t recommend) 
Started my first round of cms forms did all of them old and new for all subjects was doing around 2 ped day
Finished my second pass of uworld then took nbmes 10 and 11 booked eligibility period 

Dedicated —> 2 months 

First month did my second round of cms forms and took 1 nbme every week 

The day typically consisted of 2 cms forms and 1 review block from an nbme i already took 
I did the forms very well reading every explanation of all questions . In general cms forms are easier than uworld but contain some new concepts that is not in uworld. During this time i also made very short notes from the nbmes of things i got wrong and topics that i didnt see before (literally one liner eg: bone mass on xray best next step —> MRI , biopsy to confirm)
I found this really useful further into dedicated to quickly review nbmes without having to go through the whole thing.

Second month was nbmes + non medicine stuff(QI,patient safety etc, )

The day started with 2 blocks of solved nbmes while taking notes
I also did the amboss articles for QI, patient safety and others you can find them here somewhere.
Did the 200 HY twice and also did the 100 ethics , 100 risk factors, 45 QI, screening and vac  (highly recommend) from amboss
Also did biostats from uworld, amboss and randy neil ( hate this shit )

1 day out 
Woke up early did nothing and went to sleep early 

Exam day 
Woke up 7:30 had breakfast (oat meal) and coffee and took a couple of protien bars, Penut butter sandwiches, and coffee. 
Did 3 blocks back to back with 2 mins break while seated 
Then took a break went to the toilet had a sip of coffee and went back in did 1 block then took a break to pray duhur went back in for 2 more blocks then a break to pray asar ate half a Penut butter sandwich sip of coffee then 1 more block then a break then last block .
The exam it self feels like a blur hardly remembering any question (thank god) 

My advice 
- do Uworld well dont rush it. It is your primary source for learning but stay away from it during last month. The exam is closer to nbme and cms forms especially free 120 (most representative of the real exam) style of questions and for the most part are not trying to trick you. The real exam is easier than the nbmes
- try to improve your timing on questions as much as possible (most questions on the exam are long unlike nbmes)
- do all the cms forms twice if you have the time they will boost your score
- have a solid routine to your day to not waste time 
- excersise and do other activities during your dedicated to avoid burn outs
Finally sorry if the write up is random and disorganized 
Feel free to ask me any thing.

With Mark, he immediately told him about the overtime protocol. With Irving, he asked him how his night was going.

To me this implies that there is a certain level of trust Lumon has in Irving. Milkshake thinks that if something unusual happened, oIrving would tell him. Instead, oIrving comes up with a story that easily implies he could have fallen asleep watching a classic movie he has seen a bunch of times. Milkshake seems to accept this answer.

To me this implies that the cover story of being asleep would potentially alleviate Milkshake's fears about the OTC being activated, which further would imply that sleep interferes with the severance process, something that has been heavily theorized based on oIrving's constant coffee drinking. It also potentially implies that Burt is an ally in the fight to expose Lumon, since it seems like he would have reported it to Lumon after Irving was banging on his door if he was a company man.",2,1737740312.0,SeveranceAppleTVPlus,3,1.0,False

Men of Reddit, I need your help and advice.

I 35F attend a therapy group and there is one guy 37M there that I like.

The first time we crossed paths, we had to stop and look the person next to us in the eyes. We didn't know each other, he smiled, and I held back my smile.

The second day we met, when he was talking, he only looked at me out of the whole group. Later that same day, I walked into the corridor and he was standing with his back to me. He turned his head when he saw it was me who had entered, didn’t break eye contact, turned around, and kept looking at me for a while. I again froze and didn’t smile.

The next time, I decided I should show that I'm interested, and when I saw him, I immediately said ""Hi,"" and he just waved his head.

On Wednesday, we ended up in a subgroup with three people, and we finally got to talk. We smiled, chatted a bit.

This morning, he greeted me with a smile. I smiled back. During the theraphy  session, our eyes met a couple of times, but only for a split second. When we were leaving this time, he didn’t say goodbye to me or even look in my direction.

I’ll see him only two more times. 

Can you tell me what this looks like? Maybe he lost interest after talking to me? I can’t decide if I should ask him for coffee, or if it seems like I shouldn’t. Or how should I behave during the next two sessions to get a better sense of things?

Would it be okay to ask him on the last day if he wants to grab coffee sometime, and if he agrees, give him a note with my number?

P.S. Based on his social media status, he is single.

Way too many home buyers are stuck on the current ""RATE"" and they are all hopeful that rates go to the low 6s or into the 5s.....some are even waiting for the 3s and 4s. The truth is we don't know what the rate will do. Don't get stuck on what the rate is today.....because the rate is the rate. Focus on what your monthly PITI will be and if you are able to afford that today. Focus on where a lot of your expenses are going to on a monthly basis. Is it daily coffees for your favorite coffee shop, is it going out to a nice dinner multiple times a month, is it all the different services you subscribe to but rarely use, or is it the multiple vacations/trip you take somewhere per year? Sometimes you need to make a sacrifice to achieve success in the long term.

Also, take into consideration that inventory remains at an all time low. Those who purchased during the pandemic with 3% rates have equity that they are leveraging and not selling. They are taking HELOCs/HELOANS while keeping the low rate, and using the equity to acquire more properties This is causing home prices to remain at all time highs. And take into consideration those that work in Tech and have seen their companies stock prices skyrocket making many of them millionaires overnight...NVIDIA is a perfect example.

Lastly, if you have kids or are planning to have kids take a step back and start planning ahead. In 2023 the avg age of a FTHB was 34, in 2024 it was 38. If things ""were"" to continue as they have, what will the future generations be able to afford? Our job as parents, is to help our kid achieve all their goals. Some of those goals may be to pay their college tuition for 4yrs, maybe its to help them with a down payment on a property, or pay for their wedding. We can't rely on our careers, because one day you have a job and the next day you don't. But what we can rely on is building that equity for the LONG TERM and having it allow us as parents to help our kids achieve their goals.

To conclude, stop chasing the RATE and hope it goes down but focus on what you can comfortably afford today.

To them literally going out on a holiday trip without me, without telling me (I found out by accident...), not giving a sh\*t/not knowing what to respond when I confronted them about it on our last meeting before New Year's Eve, and not even reaching out to me when I left the group chat.

A little more context: one of them got separated from his gf around the time I mentioned, and since then he's been more and more distant with me. He was usually the main proponent/planner of our meetings, and since ""the breakup"" happened, him and the other one have been mostly meeting up with this other group of friends I know, but they pretty much never invite me in on their agenda. I'm on a different group chat with all of them, and it's been infuriating seeing them plan all these activities week after week and then not being able to do basic sh\*t like meeting with me.

They barely message me anymore (usually when a topic comes out it's me starting it on the group chat or DMing one of them directly).

A couple months ago, I end up finding out (on the freaking WEDDING of a relative of one of my ""friends"", that's how close we were before) that they are planning this holiday trip and it's pretty much already set. They never even allude to the possibility of me joining...

Come NYE party, I jokingly start ribbing them for it, and start getting more worked up when they try to deflect/avoid the topic, to the point of actually getting angry and chewing them out.

One of them brings out something that happened last time I went on a trip with them and this other group (which was more than half a decade ago btw, and which is or SHOULD BE buried six feet under).

I bring the fact that it was a videogame console's life span ago, and I have been multiple times on a group with EVERYONE involved on the trip without issues. They don't know what to respond, tell me I'm being a nag and that I should change the subject.

I leave the WhatsApp group the next day.

Literal radio silence from them, for ten days.

I want to make things right with them. Visit one of them one day, on his home, really just want to talk about things and try to see what's going on. We go to a coffee shop and order something. He plays dumb about it, and I'm too big of a chicken to bring it up.

I propose we go get dinner one night to talk about it. This time I make allusion to what happened, tell them I want things to remain the way they were between us. They agree and we have a relatively normal night out.

Cut to the present. They're out on their trip, posting IG stories and having a grand ol' time without me. I messaged them once on their first day. They said some basic NPC sh\*t and then went and have been radio silent on the group since then.

I see their IG stories, trying to act all cool and chat up chicks and pose for the camera with their new ""besties"". What the hell?

\---

I don't know what to do. I've been losing sleep and feeling incredibly depressed this past month due to all this stupid drama going on. And I'm pretty sure they don't even register that, nor care about it.

It's so unfair. We spent so many years and made so many memories together. Been through so much. One of them, R, felt like a brother to me.

I'm at a point where I want revenge against them, making them feel as shitty as I do right now typing all this. I know it's pointless, and to be honest I don't think I could bring myself or think about any way to ""get even"".

I hate them right now, and don't know what to do. I feel like they took something precious, an effigy we've been building for a decade and a half and took a huge rancid toxic sh\*tty dump over it.

\---

**TL;DR:** One of my best friends has a break up with his SO. Since then, him and another friend of mine are completely prioritizing a different friend group and pretty much ditching me for them. They are currently on a holiday trip with them, and I wasn't even supposed to find out about it apparently. I confronted them about it and they didn't know/didn't care what to respond. They have been radio silent for a while now, even though I implied I didn't want things to change between us and we ""made peace"" since that previous event. I feel like shit and don't know how to cope or what to do.

**- Discounts and Giveaways:** I have a roadside shop that I run as a side business that sells hot breakfasts from 6AM to 9AM on weekdays (coffee, bagels, and fruit cups). It is not my main job, just a side thing. I give discounts on Monday mornings for people who can prove they were in a church on Sunday. I give away free stuff on other days of the year for veterans, families with more than two children, and other people I want to honor. My new idea will be to have Kendu days where anyone who owns Kendu gets a free breakfast, and I will have info available on the spot for people who ask questions and want to buy.

**- Business Owners Alliance -** I have also started meeting with a few small business owners who do locally sourced stuff and we are hoping to create a local economy that is not based on the U.S. dollar. This group is extremely independent-thinking, creative, and hard working. I will shill directly to them, and if I combine this network with my discounts and giveaways at my own store, it may create a micro-economy around here that is Kendu based, which would be good for everyone. I need more cooperation from our group to make this successful, but I think it is possible, especially if Kendu keeps climbing and building its own momentum.

**Other Ideas That I Cannot Do, But Hope Someone Does**

**Kendu Documentary**

The Kendu story is worthy of a documentary someday. Lots of people here have said this. Somebody here probably has video editing skills and someone else here probably has interviewing skills and story-telling skills. Get a bunch of you guys together, interview Josh and Kevin and grab some sound bites of stuff Miazaki has said, and actually make a documentary! Comment below if you have actual skills for this, and are willing to collaborate. Hopefully a team develops. We do not need to wait for Kendu to hit 100B before we start this. Just release previews as you create it, and by the time you are done, Kendu will be hitting its stride and it will be perfect timing.

**Actual Kai Ken Dogs**

The Kai Ken is a real breed, and anyone could get a breeding pair and start selling puppies. It could be really fun to have a whole pack of puppies running around. I suspect you could get a decent following on social media if you just post pictures and videos of them being cute, and that would reach an entirely different kind of audience than the ordinary memecoin shills. If you sell the puppies, you could accept Kendu as payment.

Those are my ideas. What other ideas are there? Are there things we could collaborate on?",12,1737739820.0,KenduInu_Ecosystem,3,1.0,False

While this seemed like a great idea from the consumer perspective (spreads out the crowd, shorter lines and wait times), the theaters never really found a way to make it profitable.   At first the auxiliary concessions were not open during matinees......then they were not open outside of Friday/Saturday nights.....and after a while they were simply never open.  



Now they they just exist as these grim reminders of an era when operators were a lot more optimistic about attendance numbers.  Most of them were never converted into anything else, some were emptied out and just used from storage of random junk......some still seem to have candy shelves stocked in anticipation of that wild day when they can finally re-opening (fingers crossed fro Barbenheimer 2).  If you ever wanted to eat a box of 15 year-old Goobers you could probably hop the counter and grab some.

  
The only theater that's been recently built only has one single concession stand that does it all (booze, pizza, wings, coffee, candy, ice cream).  It seems like they want to abandon the idea of having multiple-stops and lines for different foodstuffs.

  
But that's just my town -- I am curious what it is like across the rest of the country.  Are they still building theaters with auxiliary stands?  Do you ever see them in use?  Will MacGuffins be the next to die?",8,1737739621.0,blankies,9,1.0,False

I (27F) have been in a relationship with my now ex-boyfriend (29M) for two years—one year as friends and another year as a couple. Last Saturday, one of my friends from a previous workplace reached out to me. I shared with him how I was struggling to find a professional job and how I was trying to break a pattern that many Africans living abroad struggle with. He and I are both from Africa, and my boyfriend is European. My friend encouraged me, saying he believed I could succeed, which gave me hope, especially since we share many similarities.

On Saturday, my boyfriend knew about everything, and I told him who my friend was. I even offered to go together if he was uncomfortable with me meeting him, to which he responded, “It’s okay, don’t worry.”

So, I met my friend, and we went to a pizza place, had a great conversation, and even discussed relationship advice from a guy’s perspective. When I returned home, I was eager to share what we talked about with my boyfriend. I greeted him and started telling him about my day, but he immediately cut me off. He asked if I paid for my own meal, and I said no. I don’t know much about European culture, but in African culture, if a friend pays for your meal one time, you would return the favor next time, and it’s considered normal.

However, my boyfriend flipped out. He asked why a man would pay for me unless it was a date, and then he accused me of cheating over pizza. I offered to send my friend the money for the meal if it upset him, and I apologized while explaining that this is a normal practice for us. He then asked to see our messages, and I gave him my phone. That’s when things got worse. He began berating me, calling me names like “bitch” and “whore,” just because I had shared my career struggles with my friend. He even said, “How dare I share my fear of abandonment,” but I never mentioned that to my friend at all. In one of the messages, my friend greeted me by saying, “Morning dear, where shall we meet? Coffee shop or pizza place?” (which is a common and endearing way for Africans to address their friends).

I don’t understand why he acted this way, especially since he already knew everything about my friendship. He even tried to manipulate the situation by claiming it was a test, and that when he “allowed” me to meet my friend, I failed.

Additionally, my boyfriend had been paying for the apartment bills because I wasn’t working much (he convinced me to quit my warehouse job so I could depend on him while working on my certification for a better job). I shared the costs for our food, did all the cleaning, cooking, and grocery shopping, and also helped him with his mental struggles alongside my own. He quit his job five months ago, and I offered to cover the bills and cut back on our food expenses. But now that he stopped working, he’s assumed that I’m changing him for a potential man who could provide for me, even though there’s no reason for him to think that. I feel like I’m being accused of stealing, even though I haven’t done anything wrong.

So, I’m asking: is this really cheating?

1i90cwx,https://www.reddit.com/r/loveafterporn/comments/1i90cwx/a_letter_to_those_who_know/,A letter to those who know,"I woke up this morning still feeling like dog shit.

It's been weeks since I saw it.

I was crying on the way back home.

I was crying just now. Before even touching my coffee.

Thinking about that girl, that photo, seeing it on his phone.

An erotic and provocative picture of another women saved on his phone. 

Thinking about the moment he first saw her post, clicked on it, the thoughts and feelings he was having, and the thoughts that led to his decision to take a screenshot of it. 

We were together when he did that. And if we happened to be fighting or on the outs, we knew how much we loved each other and supposedly respected each other. We were supposedly in love with each other. How could he do that if he really loved me? How could he do that if he respected me?

This picture looked as if she had taken it herself and sent it to him.

That was my first thought when he swiped to it in his phone gallery for both of us to see and take in.

No...

My first thought was he’s cheating on me, because I didn’t know yet that it was a screenshot of an instagram post.

I thought it was a photo a woman had sent to him via messaging.

How long has he been cheating on me?

How long has he been talking to her?

Did she send this to him today?
It was among recent photos, so I knew it was during our relationship.

How does he know this woman?! I’m going to explode, fall apart, or wither into nothing.

Am I ever going to have a faithful man??

It looked personal to me. It looked intimate, and very provocative. The image is seared into my brain and won’t go away.

These thoughts and feelings of betrayal and pain flood.

Another thought. What if he fantasized that he was with her and she had sent this to him?

Speaking of. I have to live with the fact that he was fantasizing what he wanted to do to her. He imagined having sex with her. He imagined having his hands all over her body. Touching her. Thinking of the places he wanted to do things to. Kissing her. Being inside her. Among other things unfortunately, maybe imaging how she feels inside, or the sounds she probably makes when she’s moaning or screaming. Maybe they were more intimate thoughts? More like, caressing her, telling her sweet things, making love to her, having her in his life.

She looked nothing like me. She was so sexy, beautiful and perfect in her lingerie. I was immediately jealous that she caught the attention of “my man” out of a crowd of pictures and posts, and I was jealous that I didn’t look like her. Even jealous that I didn’t look like her to get that sort of attention from him.

He doesn’t want me. He settled, and she is what he really wants, or at least someone that looks like her. 

I thought of her as his perfect ideal lover and how he wants her to look.

I think, if I was his ideal lover, he would have been looking at my picture and screenshotting it to his phone. 

I think, if he really loved me and if I was really “the one”, he would have scrolled past her.

He would have seen it, but averted his thoughts to me. 

I need to know if my thoughts are accurate.

I need to know if I’m “the one” or not. 

(I experienced ALL of this. I felt the pain and flood of emotions. I felt every thought and every word you just read. It was real for me. No matter what he says, the explanations of his experience. My heart still broke. My image and beliefs I had for him that I loved and provided me with security and safety were shattered to pieces, and left me feeling lost and broken.)

*** It's important to know that the pain, feelings, thoughts repeatedly come back whether or not I am going about my day, or taking time to process this and grieve. What you're reading up above, was not the only time I experienced that in my head since it happened, and it's not always within my control to stop it or prevent it from happening. It's a daily battle that I have to live with for now. 

To him:  I would love to just erase my experience and take in yours so that it wouldn't be as painful. But I had to find out the way that I did, you didn't even take care of me even in that moment. And NOTHING can change that. And nothing can change how wrong it was to give another woman that attention AND save her on your phone when you were telling me that you love me and you only have eyes for me. Now I have to experience betrayal trauma all over again. I have to grieve and process, and there's no way out of it but through it. I have to live with this pain, those thoughts and doubts, that image in my head, and the emotions. The emotions! I am a sensitive and emotional person, on top of being an overthinker. Do you have any idea the rollercoaster you put me on??? And I'm just supposed to believe and trust that eventually I'm going to feel restored and healed, ready to have that type of trust with someone again?

TL;DR: My experience and thoughts of what happened. I share my thought process and hope to receive some answers or support.

1i90bxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1i90bxd/perfectionism_and_obsessions_can_be_one_of_the/,Perfectionism and obsessions CAN be one of the worst things in your life.,"At least, this is the worst of all the things that disguise themselves as ""good"" but are actually so destructive you can’t even imagine.

I want to give this some visibility because social media thinking has turned into a melting pot of repetitive ideas: Work hard! Stop procrastinating! Take breaks when you need them! Sleep is a game changer! Quit coffee! Start exercising! Stop scrolling and watching porn! The list goes on and on, a never-ending cycle of ideas that, in my opinion, and from my experience, are the perfect recipe for self-destruction, especially if you start to become hyper-aware of every single aspect of these ideas, leading you to a never-ending rabbit hole of unhappiness and ""never enough""

Imagine this scenario. You've probably experienced it a million times yourself. You wake up one day, feeling a little less refreshed than you'd like. Turns out that you slept 1 hour less than ideal.

* ""Oh no! It must’ve been the processed pizza I ate for dinner. now my productivity will be cut in half! I need to stop eating rubbish. I didn't realize how harmful these foods were! (turns out, that you went to sleep in an alert state, thinking that you would not sleep enough because you had bad nutrition that day)
* ""Or maybe it’s because I didn’t stretch enough. It’s supposed to be 40 seconds per muscle. I didn't take my time to relax and shower with hot water! I'll try it today to see if that finally works""
* ""Or maybe it’s because I didn’t reach 10,000 steps yesterday, and now there’s too much energy built up in my body. I’ll cancel the family dinner so I have time to walk the steps. Otherwise, I can't reach. I need to exercise more!""
* ""Or maybe I drank too much water before bed and had to get up to pee, which delayed me falling asleep. No water after 8 p.m.! But then I should cook with less salt because I get thirsty... but then I don't drink enough water and I should to be energetic, otherwise, I will get headaches! Let's google this to know the DEFINITE answer.""
* ""Oh! I know! I scrolled on my phone, and I felt my brain activate. Tonight, I’ll put my phone away by 9:00 p.m. I NEED to read a book, that's much better. The bed is only for relaxing!""
* ""Or maybe it was my partner calling me. Even with a blue-light filter, the screen still keeps me awake. I’ll have a serious talk with them about not calling after 9:00 p.m.""
* And yet, I’m still tired. What do I do? Should I keep working hard or take a break? What does science say? Let’s Google it.

Do you realize how destructive this cycle can be? The mental and physical energy it consumes is INMENSE, far greater than the energy lost by sleeping one hour less, scrolling before bed, skipping a workout, or not meditating. We are being bombarded with the ideal routine, the ideal nutrition, the ideal amount of exercise, the ideal amount of screen time per day. List goes on. Our lives turn into a battle against ourselves to reach that ideal, to finally ""have it together"". Every day is a pursuit of control. How many times I felt this black cloud in my head? How many times I felt drained, thinking this had to do with X habit I was doing wrong? How many times I just gave up on fixing it, and suddenly, felt a HUMONGOUS relief and energy again? Otherwise, you keep searching for the perfect solution, for the perfect method. There are hundreds of them, and they are usually called ""The \[insert name\] rule"". A bible could be written with all of them. Every person using them claim that each one is the definitive one. As a consequence, your mind starts to absorb all this information and jump from branch to branch like a monkey would.

I'd suggest that one day, you give up on this thinking. Just surrender to the idea of it being out of your control. Accept the ""mediocre"" day. Don't want to ""do something NOW to fix the day"". Recognize that, wanting to stop feeling anxiety and guilt **is a form of anxiety itself.** It is the same demon with a different disguise. Your own mind is the single worst enemy you can think of. Not the McDonalds you ate, not the ice cream and the sugar, not even the scrolling and the porn. Yes, these things are not the best for your life, but the real enemy is hiding behind these things. the majority of us have an imposed crippling fear of mediocrity and failure that put us in a mental torture chamber.

Let me repeat this: Sleeping five hours one night with a healthy mindset and going on with your day is far better than living in a mental prison of perfectionism and obsessive productivity.

I am 36 and had my first child in June 2024. I am 5' 7"" and was \~180 lbs. when I got pregnant (and was actively trying to lose weight at this time, I feel best between 155-165 lbs.).

Went up to 235 in pregnancy, but having a summer baby I dropped a good chunk of the weight right away just on daily walks and what not. Was back to 190 by August. Then in the panic of returning to work and not wanting my milk supply to suffer I ate a LOT and tried every gimmick (oat milk, ""lactation cookies"", coconut water, etc. that is way too many calories) and from October-December the scale hung around 200 lbs.

I am still breastfeeding, but as of January 1st I decided to get back on track and if my milk supply dwindles, so be it. I have made it 7+ months and have plenty of frozen milk to get me through if needed.

So I stopped the oat milk coffees and other ""milk boosting"" foods. I know what works for me, I've been thin before, and although I am not using a calorie tracker (triggered ED tendencies in the past), I know that I am eating significantly better than I had for the past 4 months.

I also started back at the gym interval weight training 3x a week and making sure to walk everyday.

All of that and the scale hasn't budged. Not even 1 lb. I really thought that I would see the lbs. fall off as I am very careful, and I have had some NSV's, but I really want to see movement on the scale.

I'm struggling - I know my body is changing since having a baby but does anyone have experience losing the baby weight? I need to lose at least 20 lbs. before I feel comfortable getting pregnant again. Please help.",3,1737738477.0,loseit,2,1.0,False

A wall that didn't make sense; an opaque barrier sitting on the edge of our sleepy town. 

I was inches away from it, so close to touching it, so close to falling through. 

To my left, Lizbeth Wainwright was standing, half lidded eyes glued to it. 

On my right, Harry Carlisle stumbled back, spluttering out a sharp cry. 

There were twenty five of us. 

Twenty five seventeen year olds standing in a line. 

I ran home. 

Mom was gone, her coffee was still warm. 

*Everyone* was gone. 

It was just us. 

Emma Thomas was convinced it was the rapture, and we had been left behind. 

But then she went crazy, and threw herself into the barrier– only to disappear. 

Until that moment, the barrier had been completely impenetrable. 

But food was running out. 

We were blocked from the outside world, and breaking through was our only shot. 

Noah Price poked the barrier, and we all watched, as his finger slowly slid through, almost like it welcomed him. 

“Holy shit,” he whispered, moving closer, sticking his entire arm through. 

“Are you *insane*?!” Lizbeth tried to yank him back, but he was already through, already slipping into nothingness. 

Other kids followed. 

I watched others slowly disappearing through the wall, noticing their sudden smiles of relief, like a gentle hand was coaxing them towards safety. When it was my turn, there were three of us left. 

Harry saluted me with a grin. “I guess I'll see you on the other side?”

When he disappeared, I followed. 

But to my confusion, it bounced me back. 

Lizbeth frowned. ""Try again. Maybe it's... confused?"" 

""It's not confused,"" I grumbled. ""It's stubborn.""

This thing wouldn't even let me *touch* it. 

“I'll try.” Lizbeth took a deep breath, and stepped straight through.

She didn't even say goodbye, too desperate, too starving, to remember she had empathy. 

Leaving me… *alone*. 

I tried again, this time slowly, with just a finger. 

To my surprise, my fingertip did slip through. 

But my body, once again, was dragged back. 

Back to *pain*. 

*”Anyone in here?”* 

The voice was so close, reality slamming into me. 

*”Charlie, I know you're in here.”*

Blinking rapidly, I found myself pressed against clinical white tiles. 

They were familiar, covered in scribbles and smileys.  

Inside my school bathroom, my life seeping out of me in streaks of scarlet. 

Gritting my teeth, I sucked in a breath. 

Opposite me, Lizbeth’s head was hanging, streaks of blonde stuck to scarlet cheeks, her hand still in mine. 

Harry was curled up, unmoving, his head tipped back.

*Footsteps.*

I held my breath, my eyes flickering, my breaths shuddering. 

The door I leaned against flew open. 

*""Found you.""*

My body slumped backwards. 

And just like that, once again I stood in front of that barrier. 

And this time, I slipped right through.",34,1737738356.0,shortscarystories,7,0.97,False

1i907pa,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1i907pa/irvings_paintings_s2e2_spoilers/,Irving's Paintings (S2E2 spoilers),"In season 1, my theory on Irv's paintings is that his Innie experienced something so impactful that he just couldn't get rid of the image of the elevator/hallway. Like it was a defining experience for Innie Irving so strong that single image bled through. His frantic painting was a means of trying to resolve this ephemeral memory - like trying to grab running water with your hand.

But with a single line in S2E2 it has flipped my theory a full 180. ""My Innie got the message.""

This now puts his paintings in a completely new perspective. It's not Outie Irving trying to grab a memory from his Innie, it's Outie Irving trying to **plant** a memory, an image. That's why it's this daily ritual, with the same song over and over, and drinking coffee. He's using every sense on repeat to try to get *something* ""through"" the severance barrier.

This opens up a whole new line of questions. Outie Irving documents on severed workers/the map of their homes always gave me a reporter vibe. Like he's an undercover journalist, and that's been my vague personal theory. But now it seems he has *some* kind of information about the severed floor, and we know that he's working with someone.

God I love this show. A single line of dialogue puts an entirely new perspective on Irv's paintings and motivations.

The Billionaire And His Son Want Me Back
1.Chapter 1

""Mrs. Vanderbilt, the food's gone cold again. Should I reheat it?"" The housekeeper's cautious tone carried a hint of impatience as she glanced at Paisley Sutton.

Paisley sat alone at the large dining table, the vast space around her amplifying her solitude. She glanced at the time and then at the housekeeper, whose frustration was over her face. ""Just clear it away,"" said Paisley with a faint smile that barely masked her weariness.

It was her birthday today, yet neither her husband nor son had bothered to come home. The stark absence of their presence made the silence in the room deafening.

The housekeeper began clearing the table with swift, almost annoyed movements, muttering under her breath, ""Mrs. Vanderbilt, not to be rude, but why go to all this trouble? You knew neither your husband nor your son would be back tonight, yet you insisted on preparing a whole feast.

""Reheating this food three times tonight? It's exhausting. Honestly, as a wife and mother, you're not exactly winning any awards. Otherwise, why would they both avoid you like this?""

""You're right. I've failed spectacularly,"" Paisley replied with a bitter smile. The words stung, but she no longer had the strength to argue. In this house, even the housekeeper had no qualms about being openly dismissive toward her.

She understood that the housekeeper's attitude mirrored the Vanderbilt family's treatment of her. She scoffed internally, 'If my husband and son don't respect me, why would anyone else?'

Seeing Paisley's quiet despair, the housekeeper softened slightly, a flicker of pity crossing her face.

With a sigh, she muttered, ""People always cling to things that don't belong to them. If I were you, I'd let go. Let it all go. You'd be doing yourself a favor—and maybe even others.""

Paisley didn't respond, but the words lingered, sinking deep into her mind like stones dropped into a still pond.

The room remained quiet, save for the clinking of dishes being cleared away. The chandelier overhead cast a soft, golden glow, but it only emphasized how hollow the space felt. Paisley's chest tightened, her heart weighed down by the emptiness she'd grown accustomed to.

The housekeeper finished clearing the table and retreated to her quarters, leaving the vast dining room eerily silent.

Paisley turned off all the lights, her movements slow and deliberate, as if each step required effort.

Cradling the cake box, she climbed the grand staircase and returned to her bedroom. The space was cold, the kind of cold that seeped into her soul rather than her skin.

She settled onto the plush sofa by the window, the moonlight spilling in faintly, casting soft shadows on the walls.

Carefully, she opened the cake box. Inside was a delicately crafted dessert meant for celebration, though the atmosphere couldn't feel less festive.

She removed the cake, placed a single candle on top, and lit it. The flickering flame reflected in her tired eyes in an overwhelming darkness.

Just as she was about to gather her thoughts, a sharp WhatsApp message shattered the silence in the room. The sound was jarring in the quiet space, its abruptness making her heart jump. She hesitantly reached for her phone, only to find it was a video message.

She clicked on it, and the screen revealed a scene from a VIP hospital suite. Her husband, Dominick Vanderbilt, and her young son, Grayson Vanderbilt, sat by the bedside of a gorgeous, frail-looking woman.

Paisley recognized her instantly. It was Marissa Prescott, Dominick's childhood sweetheart, to whom Dominick had once been engaged. This video was from her.

""Dom, I'm so sorry to keep you here so late,"" Marissa's weak voice came through, punctuated by soft, deliberate coughs.

""It's no trouble,"" Dominick replied, his tone warm and gentle, with a tenderness Paisley hadn't heard from him in years. It wasn't just warmth—it was affection, even indulgence.

'So, he's been with her all day,' Paisley thought, a faint, self-deprecating smile curling her lips. She couldn't even remember the last time Dominick had spoken to her without an edge of irritation, let alone with this kind of fondness.

A pang of bitterness twisted in her chest as she wondered when his voice, once a source of comfort, had turned into a weapon. Now, it seemed, every word he directed at her was either critical or cold.

""Marissa, you don't need to worry,"" came Grayson's soft, childlike voice from the video. His small, chubby body crawled up onto the bed, snuggling into Marissa's arms. ""Daddy and I love staying here with you. We don't wanna go home.""

The boy's next words hit like a dagger. ""I love having Marissa around. I wish she was my mommy.""

The video ended abruptly, leaving Paisley staring at the blank screen.

Her hands trembled as she set the phone down. The candle on the cake flickered, its glow dim against the suffocating darkness in the room.

Finally, Paisley made up her mind. She drew a deep breath and blew out the flame. The dimness swallowed the room as her voice broke the silence, soft and almost a whisper. ""Happy birthday to me.""

Dominick returned home well past midnight. The house was shrouded in darkness, an unusual sight. There was always a light left on for him, no matter how late he arrived, but tonight, that small comfort was conspicuously absent.

His brow furrowed with irritation as he handed Grayson off to the housekeeper. Without a word, he strode toward the master bedroom, his steps brisk and sharp. When he noticed the light spilling out from under the door, his grim expression eased slightly.

Inside, Paisley sat upright on the sofa, her posture unnervingly composed. Beside her was a neatly packed suitcase, and on the low coffee table in front of her lay a divorce agreement, stark and unmissable.

Dominick's fleeting relief vanished, replaced by a cold, impenetrable look. His voice was clipped and edged with annoyance. ""Paisley, what is this? Another one of your stunts?""

Paisley could feel the tension between them crackle like static in the air. She didn't have the energy to entertain his accusations, nor did she have the desire to dig into the complicated mess he called a ""stunt"".

She stood her ground, her voice quiet but unwavering, ""Dominick, I want a divorce.""

He sighed heavily, his fatigue evident as he loosened his tie and tossed it onto the sofa. That was when his gaze fell on the small cake sitting on the coffee table, its candle burned down to the wick.

""It's your birthday today?"" His tone carried faint disbelief, laced with a trace of guilt. He'd forgotten, and his assistant hadn't reminded him either.

""It doesn't matter,"" Paisley replied, shaking her head. She pushed the divorce agreement closer to him, her expression unwavering. ""Sign it. Let's end this.""

Dominick's brows drew together, his irritation and confusion flaring as if she were the one making a scene. ""Why?"" he demanded, his tone accusatory. ""Because I forgot your birthday? Don't you think that's a little melodramatic?""

He glanced at the agreement with a hint of mockery in his eyes, and then stretched out two fingers, pinching the paper between them. Slowly, he began flipping through it, one page at a time, as if inspecting it like some trivial document that didn't matter.

He sneered, ""You ask for nothing? You're going to leave empty-handed? Paisley, where would you even go without me?""

A bitter laugh escaped Paisley's lips, though her heart felt heavier with every beat.

'So that's it,' she thought. 'He's so certain that I'm trapped, that I have no one to rely on in Harrowfell, no place to go. That's why he's so confident, so sure he can keep draining me of every last ounce of love and patience.'

Her inner voice hissed with venom, 'What an arrogant, self-satisfied jerk.'

Yet on the outside, Paisley remained eerily calm, her silence more cutting than any retort.

She let out a cold, mirthless laugh. ""Where I go is none of your concern. All you need to do is sign the papers and meet me at the City Hall tomorrow."" Her voice was calm, but the ice in her tone could cut through steel.

At that, Dominick's temper flared, his voice laced with frost. ""Have you really thought this through?""

She didn't bother responding, simply tossing the pen onto the table near his hand. ""Stop wasting time. Sign it.""

Her unwavering resolve struck him like a blow. For a moment, Dominick faltered, his mind clouded with a fleeting sense of unease. Her once-soft eyes now burned with an unyielding determination he hadn't seen before.

Slowly, he drew in a deep breath and massaged his temple, the weariness in his expression growing more pronounced. ""Fine. Divorce it is,"" he said, his tone heavy with frustration. ""But Sonny's custody? That's off the table. You're not taking him.""

Before Paisley could react, a small voice pierced the tension. Grayson had woken at some point and now dashed into the room, clutching Dominick's arm tightly.

He glared at Paisley, his little face twisted with anger as he yelled, ""I'm staying with Daddy. I don't want to go with you. You're a horrible mom. A witch!""

""Sonny,"" Dominick snapped, his voice sharp enough to startle the boy.

But Grayson was undeterred, his tear-streaked face defiant after getting screamed at. ""I'm not wrong,"" he shouted, his words tumbling out in a storm of emotions. ""You're just a useless housewife. Grandma and Aunt Kayla said so.

""If you hadn't come between Daddy and Marissa, she would be my mom right now.""

Pinching the bridge of his nose, Dominick sighed deeply, ""Grayson, enough—""

But Paisley cut him off, her voice slicing through the air like a blade. ""I don't care about Grayson. I don't care about anything. I just want a divorce."" Her tone was final, leaving no room for negotiation or second-guessing.

Dominick's lips tightened into a thin line, his expression hardening in disbelief. He hadn't expected Paisley to say something like that—something so resolute, so cold. To refuse to take Grayson with her after the divorce, after everything she had been through for Grayson, felt unthinkable.

Dominick couldn't forget the sacrifices she had made to bring their son into the world. Paisley had nearly lost her life on the operating table, and afterward, she had poured herself into raising Grayson, tending to him with an intensity that bordered on obsession.

She had given him everything, every part of herself, to make him safe, healthy, and loved. And now, she was simply saying she didn't want him and didn't want anything to do with him.

Even Grayson seemed stunned into silence by her words, his sobs abruptly halting as he stared at her in disbelief. But the shock didn't last long. A twisted smile crept onto his face, one too bitter for a child. ""Good.

""Daddy, hurry up and divorce her. Then Marissa can be my mommy.""

The words hung in the air like poison, choking the remnants of warmth left in the room. Dominick ignored Grayson's outburst entirely, his sharp gaze fixed on Paisley like a predator sizing up its prey.

His voice dropped an octave, cold and commanding. ""I'll ask you one last time—are you absolutely sure about this divorce?""

Paisley met his eyes without flinching, her tone calm yet resolute. ""Yes.""

She watched Dominick's pen carved his name onto the divorce agreement, his movements deliberate yet forceful. Without hesitation, she picked up her copy, the weight of it oddly liberating.

She grabbed her suitcase and headed toward the door. Her voice was steady, but the undercurrent of finality was unmistakable. ""9:00 a.m. tomorrow. City Hall. Don't be late.""

Just as her fingers tightened around the handle of her suitcase, her wrist was seized in a firm grip. Dominick's hand was broad, his veins prominent along the back of it, exuding a raw, masculine allure that once had her utterly captivated.

She'd been obsessed with those hands, with the man they belonged to. But now, his touch felt like repulsive shackles.

""Let go,"" she said icily, her voice stripped of all warmth.

Her thoughts churned bitterly. 'What's the point of clinging now? Isn't this divorce exactly what everyone wanted? Dominick, his family, and the housekeeper seemed eager to see me gone.'

Dominick's lips curled into a mocking smile, his tone laced with dark amusement. ""In such a hurry to leave? What? Got yourself a lover on the side already?""

A wave of exhaustion swept over Paisley, sinking into her very bones. She looked into his eyes, her words cutting through the tension like a knife. ""Dominick, I have never hated you more than I do right now.""

For a moment, her words seemed to shake him. His grip loosened, and he let her wrist slowly slip from his grasp. His tone softened, almost imploring. ""It's late. Even if you're set on leaving, you could wait until morning.""

A dry, humorless laugh escaped her lips. She pulled her hand back, her gaze unwavering.

Without sparing him another glance, she grabbed her suitcase and walked out. The sound of the door closing behind her echoed in the vast emptiness of the house—a house that had imprisoned her for four long years.

Her departure felt like breaking free, but the weight of her pain and disillusionment lingered, trailing behind her like a shadow she couldn't quite shake.",1,1737737953.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

Couldn’t figure what the issue was and ended up just putting the basket in with no coffee beans and hitting the button for one shot to get myself the hot water.

Anyways since then every time I’ve tried to use the steam wand button to froth my milk, for some reason it does exactly the same thing. Steam wand does nothing, doesn’t even get warm, machine whirs and then a bunch of steam comes out from where the espresso shots are supposed to come out.

1i8zvdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i8zvdn/aitah_for_not_telling_my_sisterinlaw_that_she/,AITAH for not telling my sister-in-law that she peed in the wrong body wash?,"I (46F) and my husband (46M) had a falling out with his sister (40F), a few years ago. We had agreed to split the rent and bills during a tough time for both of us, and it imploded almost immediately due to 1) her refusal to respect communal furniture and spaces, and 2) her lying to us about the cost of bills to get us to pay a higher percentage than we agreed. My husband and I quickly moved out, and since she had never “gotten around to” adding us to the lease, she was stuck in the apartment until the lease ended. We have since moved out of state and bought a house.

Fast forward to now. SIL called my husband to ask if she and her new boyfriend (M35) could stay with us on their way to a friend’s wedding in our new state. She said she wanted to make amends and patch things up. I was skeptical, but I told my husband he could decide and I would do my best to get along. Well, when they got here, she had brought along an additional friend (F30-ish) as well as her boyfriend. Fine, okay. Rude, but whatever. 

I settled SIL and her boyfriend into the guest bedroom, and made up the daybed in our gaming room for the extra friend. The friend asked if she could shower. I said yes, and directed her to the bathroom. She grabbed her stuff and went in and showered. Well, the next morning, we heard SIL and her boyfriend go into the bathroom and start the shower. Then we heard giggling. When SIL and her boyfriend came out, she looked smug, and he looked subdued.

SIL went to wake up her friend and they left to get iced coffees. The boyfriend immediately asked me to take him to the airport. I was confused, but said sure (my husband was at work at this point, he left while they were getting dressed). In the way to the airport, the boyfriend told me that he was done with SIL, that she had peed in my body wash, shampoo and conditioner while they were in the shower.

Here’s the kicker. I don’t use body wash. I use soap that a friend of mine makes with goat’s milk because I have sensitive skin. My husband uses it, too. I also use bar shampoo and conditioner and a body balm bar, so none of the bottles in the shower were mine… they were all her extra friend’s. I had moved mine and my husband’s stuff into our smaller bathroom to make room for the guests. 

I said “thank you for telling me,” and left it at that. I dropped him off at the airport. When I got home, SIL and her friend were piled up on my couch with the coffee and breakfast, watching Netflix. I said “good morning,” and logged into my computer to play Diablo IV for a while. I said nothing. Neither SIL nor her friend mentioned the missing boyfriend. 

Later that day, my husband texted me and asked if we’d all like to go to dinner at our favorite sushi place. I told him that the boyfriend had left and gone home, but that I would ask SIL and her friend when he asked me why the boyfriend left, I told him he should probably ask his sister. He said OK, and we all agreed to go out for sushi. I told SIL and her friend that I was going to take a shower and the diabolical light in my sister-in-law‘s eyes told me all I needed to know…

when I walked past the main bathroom and down the hall into the bathroom that only had a shower stall, SIL looked frozen. All the way through dinner she was nervous, and when her friend went to shower before bed she looked panicked, but she didn’t say anything. “Oh, gross! Nasty!” shrieks started coming from the bathroom minutes later.  The friend came out wrapped in a towel yelling that I was disgusting for pissing in her stuff, that SIL was right about what a b-word I am, etc.

The wrap was visibly **not cooked properly** \- I could taste the raw flour, and the wrap was visibly doughy, moist, and translucent. It was inedible and clearly unsafe.

I contacted Uber Eats through twitter/X to request a refund and explain the situation. I even mentioned that I’d tried throwing it in the air fryer to salvage it, but it was still horrible. Their response? A canned message saying they couldn’t issue a refund and that I should leave feedback for the restaurant instead.

I escalated it, quoting the Consumer Rights Act 2015, which states that **goods must be of satisfactory quality, fit for purpose, and as described**. They still refused and kept sending robotic responses.

At this point, I’ve told them I’ll be reporting the issue to Trading Standards. It’s not just about the refund anymore - it’s about how dismissive and unhelpful they’ve been, even when the issue is about food safety.

I know food delivery platforms often get complaints, and to some extent it's the restaurant that cooked it, but this is next-level frustrating. Honestly, it’s the principle of it at this point. They partner with these restaurants, they are who I've paid, and if the food they deliver is unsafe, they should take responsibility.  
  
I’m left wondering though:

* Has anyone else had their refund denied for something like this?
* Did anyone successfully escalate their complaint with Uber Eats and get a resolution?
* Any advice on how to handle this going forward outside of reporting to TSA?

Lol. No, but seriously. And maybe, for someone like me, I need to embrace keeping myself in a situation where I’m a little uncomfortable.

I’ve lived in a car for four years, and lately I have been thinking about upgrading to an SUV or minivan. But sitting here in a hotel room (I usually grab one twice a month), I’ve come to the realization that when I am comfortable, I do not thrive. Rather, I do nothing. 

When I get a hotel room, I will check in at 3 PM and then often scroll on my phone and eat snacks until the next morning. 😂. (After I have my coffee, I do usually get some good work done on my laptop and I start organizing etc .)

When I’m in my car, especially if I am in a city where car dwelling is not 100% acceptable, I will

- try to get up and move from my sleeping spot before dawn
- get uncomfortable in the car bucket seat during the day, so I mix up laptop work with delivery work to keep me moving
- keep moving until at least 7pm because i need to use a restroom at that point before I settle down for the night. 

All of this keeps me outdoors a bit and on a somewhat healthy schedule (that and getting my 10k steps in). 

I honestly think if I had a nice minivan, I actually might deteriorate.  😂😂😂

(kinda long post),"So the entire gist of this post is that I have no idea what research design should I pick, but based on our process its either experimental or quasi-experimental, but I'm not sure since I don't really understand the difference between them.

*What's the process?*

Basically we aim to develop an AI voice-in voice-out communication aid (VIVOCA) for those with speech impediments/impairments, especially cleft palate and dysarthria, but for our native/national language (Filipino) since there are already solutions for English.

First we plan on obtaining samples by having the participants (speech-impaired, of course) speak a set of words, which will of course be recorded.

Then we use that data to train three different deep learning models; a convolutional neural network, a recurrent neural network, and a hidden markov model, and test their effectiveness in interpreting the impaired speech properly in order to find out which is effective.

*So what?*

Judging by the process, it would be experimental, as, well, we plan to test the effectiveness of three different AI models in interpreting slurred or unclear speech.

However, based off of **my** understanding, quasi-experimental lacks the random assignment of an experimental design, and the only random part that I can think of in the research is selecting an audio recording for the testing phase, which in paper would still not be random as we need to test all recordings (I think).

I'm running on Scribbr and an iced coffee, it's past midnight in where I am and I can't think straight lol, if anyone can help it would be greatly appreciated

Edit: I'll also insert a question regarding the research instruments, because I'm not sure if having both a structured observation (for collecting the audio) and an experiment/test (testing the AI models) is right",1,1737736367.0,research,0,1.0,False
1i8zfb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesHoffmann/comments/1i8zfb7/fermented_coffee/,Fermented coffee,"Yesterday I accidentally bought a bag of anaerobic fermented coffee (360 hours) from Colombia and I hated it. Before noticing it was fermented, I called the roaster because I thought there was a defect in the coffee as it tasted like ""overfermented"" cacao beans and stale peanuts. The roaster was also surprised by my reaction because I have been buying from them for years, they asked me for my recipe and method and we exchanged some notes but as I had left home, I couldn't try adjusting my recipe.

They were also new to this processing method, at least the person I spoke to in the phone. They have other varietals from the same farm, so I guess they were offered natural anaerobic coffee along with the other batches.

After I hang up the phone I noticed the coffee was listed as ""Natural - Anaerobic"" so I started reading. I reached James's QA video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhX0N1\_ye7E) on weird fermentation processes, so I ended up listing to Lucía Solis's podcast and some presentations she had given. This morning I tried different recipes and continued exchanging notes with my roaster, they were really interested in tweaking, and they ended up suggesting the following recipe for v60 if anyone is interested:

* Grind: 16 (EK 43) (mid-course)
* Ratio: 15.8
* Coffee: 31.5 g
* Water: 500 g, 94ºC
* Pour 1: 100 g x 60 sec
* Pour 2: 250 g
* Pour 3: 500 g (3.30 overall)

Anyway. I tried this recipe and others (I don't have a mahlkonig), mostly following the general advise to treat this coffee as a ""dark roast"" in the sense that lowering temp and increasing the grind size might help me getting a more clear cup of coffee. In the end, I was able to achieve a better cup, but in no sense I would prefer this to a natural processed coffee, washed or honey. Since we have a close relationship with my roaster, they agreed to change the coffee for other bag, but this experience left me with so many questions.

Overall, I feel like I don't agree with Lucías's philosophy on using winemaking fermentation techniques in coffee, mainly because the roasting of the coffee adds up another whole dimension that does not exist in winemaking. I would not even go as far as making similarities between coffee and cacao processing because the way you use the beans is completely different. To me, fermented coffee tasted like a cacao beans that had a defective fermentation process (purple toned beans).

* Am I judging this method too hastily?
* Should I give it another chance but with a more experimental approach?
* Why did James changed his opinion on this new methods, as he explained in the video?
* Will he make a video about this methods in the future?",0,1737736234.0,JamesHoffmann,11,0.25,False

I took myself and the kids out to lunch and we all felt better and got home to take naps. 

Before I left I tried to talk to H who was regulating in the attic. He wasn't calm but he wasn't insulting and I could listen to his pain even though he yelled (like LD advices). 

So apparently he feels completely neglected by me during his sickness since yesterday morning. True, because I've been ignoring him for the last 3 days (due to my hurt from his criticism of last week, phew!). I hadn't offered to bring him food, water or coffee while he lay all day in his room shivering. Or ask him how he's feeling, even this morning when he came down. I didn't consider his needs in any way though I'd cooked for the kids. It's true he had made the kitchen sparkle for me when he woke up at night to get water and a bite.

Okay, I'll own it. I was being petty and passive aggressive with him after having been vulnerable 2 days ago.

He expected me to wake him about the trash this morning since I'm always welcome to wake him up for emergencies (apparently this was one,  but ftw I didn't know. Still think this is mad).

On usual days I don't wake him up unless I need something. He is often up before me. He will sleep in on weekends. But this has been a fire starter in our marriage always. We never fought about money, faithfulness or in-laws. Only sleep. I don't know if I should pray or count my lucky stars. 

Indeed, PI and the yelling are the challenges. I've received good advice on this subreddit before about the yelling, which works well for us. But this week I focused on the negative and it has blown up in my face for real. 

Takeaway: LD is right, what I focus on increases a lot. I need to choose my focus wisely.

He ended up liking the very gorgeous woman in our crew (around my age, possibly 25?) and I encouraged them both to pursue each other as they both liked each other and I figured he wasn't into me.

We remained friends a bit over time, he and texting every once in a while and always sharing a laugh thru memes on Instagram.

I couldn't tell you why, but my feelings for him came back swinging this month. He and the the bombshell he has pursued had apparently not worked out at all and it was very short lived. 

He's in another country for work right now, and I texted him earlier this month to see if he wanted to meet for coffee (I'm trying to see all of my work friends more, so it wasn't just him) and he joked ab it being a date which I laughed off trying not to be too serious. I just want to get to know him more and see if my feelings change.

Now I checked in on the coffee get together and he's just ignored me all day. Idk what happened, I feel stupid, and besides a few bad jokes back and forth between us, I don't know what's wrong. 

Any advice? If I move too quickly it could upset my career, but if I move too slow it could exacerbate these feelings and make me self conscious around him at work. I've only ever been in an abusive relationship in my teens/early twenties so I don't know all the new dating or ""talking"" etiquette. Pls help ",1,1737736032.0,relationship_advice,7,1.0,False

Up until early December, we were long distance. He lives in a state that borders New York, so New York City is very close by. I've ALWAYS been really interested in going to NYC - all the romance movies set there make it look like this incredibly magical place. He'd never been to New York, so I had this really romantic fantasy in my head of us going for the first time together and getting to experience that together. We even had semi-made plans to go once we were living together, go spend a weekend in the Big Apple.

Last April he announced he bought tickets with a friend to go see a show in NYC in January of 2025. We fought about it a lot. I was really upset, I told him I'd really wanted to experience that for the first time with him. He really didn't understand it. I finally just gave up on fighting about it, because he wasn't going to understand why it made me so upset. I genuinely considered breaking up with him over it because it was something I'd been really looking forward to. But I didn't want to lose him over something so stupid, so I gave up and decided to just stop caring. We briefly made plans to go the following October for my birthday, but...

Honestly at this point I don't care anymore. It's horrible to say but he ruined the idea of going for me. I just don't want to go anymore. Since I was little and saw the American Girl doll flagship store on one of those American Girl movies, I'd wanted desperately to go to NYC. It just looks magical - going to Times Square, Central Park, that giant bookstore that has like 5 stories, all the cool bakeries and coffee shops and places...

I don't know. He's there now, and I'm completely alone, and I guess that's bringing up those feelings again. He's sending me pictures and I just keep wishing I was there with him, getting to experience this with him. Like, I'm actively crying just thinking about how I'm sitting here alone in our apartment while he's out there experiencing something for the first time that I wanted to experience alongside him. But instead he's going with his friend. Going and exploring without me.

How do I work through this? He's going to come home tomorrow afternoon and I'm just going to be a mess. I need to get myself together before he comes back.

EDIT: I forgot to put a TL;DR.

TL;DR: I thought me and my boyfriend (neither of us have gone to new york city before) were going to go together and experience that for the first time, something I spent over a year romanticizing, but he decided to go with a friend instead. I don't really want to go anymore because I kind of don't care, it kind of destroyed my desire to go, but now that he's actually there and sending me pictures and stuff I'm getting upset over it again and I need to pull myself together before he comes home tomorrow.

EDIT 2: I'm not looking for people to imply I'm a bad girlfriend or that he deserves better or whatever else you're going to say, I just want advice on how to regulate my emotions so we don't spend the next week arguing about this. You try picturing your significant other sending you pictures of themself at the Empire State Building when that's something YOU wanted to do with them.",1,1737736003.0,relationship_advice,17,0.66,False

	1.	I add 3 teaspoons of coffee grounds to the filter chamber.
	2.	I boil 1 cup of water in a small saucepan and pour it into the chamber to brew.
	3.	While the coffee is brewing, I boil 1.5 cups of milk in the same saucepan. Once the decoction is ready, I mix it with the milk.

But I’ve been running into two problems:

	1.	The milk often burns or curdles when I boil it.
	2.	The coffee flavor isn’t as strong as I’d like.

It occurs to me that I should tell you from one mom to another. You will be OK even though now you are not OK, and it’s OK to not be OK.

Even though being OK seems a long way off and nigh impossible. Even still, you will be more than just OK. 

My son babbles something in an intelligible language. 

You will in fact be great.

Sooner than you think, the haze of newborn days will be behind you. Your child will cuddle and clap and stand and dance and laugh. He will conversationally mutter “up, up, up,” while holding your hand as you walk about the halls of your own home because it’s much too cold to go play outside like he really wants to.

It baffles me how one can go from being so very not OK to being more OK than they’ve ever been in the short span of a year, but trust me when I say—you will get there. 

Perhaps it will take longer—perhaps a shorter time—but there will come a day when you realize your hours are far more full of laughter than of tears, and in fact, you don’t remember the last time you cried in anything but joy.

The little hand that grips yours now by reflex will hold it out of trust. The voice that wails for you in the middle of the night will still wail for you in the middle of the night, but now you will know exactly what to do to calm it, and you will feel capable—not overwhelmed.

You will grow to be so much stronger than you ever dreamed you could be, and all for the love of a little person who looks to you as their everything when they are in fact YOUR everything.

You will want time to neither rush nor slow because you are so happy right where and when you are.

My son cruises around the coffee table and takes two brave, wobbly steps towards the couch.

You will know that these are the best days of your lives.

1i8z7id,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1i8z7id/am_i_right_not_to_trust_my_aunt/,Am I right not to trust my aunt?,"I really need help to understand the situation because I don't know who to trust anymore.

I (34F) grew up in a pretty unstable environment. My mom passed away over 20 years ago, living with my father wasn't easy and there always was drama in my extended family. This, plus a very abusive romantic relationship at 20yo, and the will to build a better career and life for myself compared to the one I would have had at home, made me decide to move abroad. I've been away for many years now.

Most of my family was never supportive, always criticised my choices. I am the first one to have a degree in my family (I actually have two) and the first one to move abroad, so I guess they don't have the mental openness to understand me. For example, when I mentioned I was moving to a new country for work (I lived in different places), I was laughed at straight to my face and told ""I have no home"" by one of my aunts, or when I opened a business, I was told that they didn't believe it would be successful and it was destined to fail by another aunt. Despite all this, I believe to have built a decent life for myself. And with time, I learned to take my distance from these people.

Fast forward to a few months ago, I lived together with the man whom I thought was the love of my life. We were very happy. Then he found a very good job in his home country and told me to follow him there as soon as possible so we could finally have our family and children. After a couple months I quit my job, sent a notice to leave my apartment, and only a few weeks before reuniting he sent me a message saying that he loved me and loved being with me, but he was overwhelmed by the approaching of my arrival, was afraid to let me down, and it was better to let me go so I could find someone who could give me the love and stability I deserve. I already knew he felt he was not good enough for me, but I always reassured him, and there were no warnings before the breakup that he was gonna do it, he never communicated anything about it to me. I was blindsided. Heartbroken, homeless, jobless. I went immediately no contact. I had wonderful friends who helped me with housing while I looked for another job. I thought I could do better financially, as the country I was living in is pretty expensive especially for a single woman who doesn't share a house, so I looked for a place with a better balance salary-cost of life, and I found it in a couple of months and went back to my home country to prepare my visa.

I was happy for the job but still emotionally messed up due to the trauma of what happened, so I thought to meet my relatives next time I visit as I was too vulnerable and not ready to talk with them for now. I am not good at lying and I knew that I would start crying once asked ""how are you?"", so I stayed away as much as possible from them while home even though they knew I had arrived as they all live in the same street. After a while not visiting her, one of my aunts (55F) called me and asked me to meet for a coffee. She was the aunt who had helped me the most among them growing up, and even though there were a couple episodes that made me lose trust (she was very controlling when she visited me for my graduation years ago), I still had some hope with her and thought that she actually came to see me so maybe she cared about me, so I agreed. As predicted, I cried when she asked me how things were. I decided to give her a chance and told her what happened. She mostly felt reassuring. Then she said to text her over the next few days to meet again, and left to meet my other aunt (first red flag). Long story short, I texted her shortly after, and she never replied. My cousins (her daughters) texted me out of the blue after some days (they never do - other red flag) to casually talk, but I cut it quite short as I felt they were getting in contact with me because they were told about my coming move and wanted to benefit from it. So, even though I have no certainty of this, I felt like my aunt didn't care about me after all and just met me to know my business and spread gossip around. I felt fooled, betrayed. After 12 days I got to know from the only relatives I trust that she was asking around about me. Then I met her by chance the day after, which was not really by chance but her asking where I was and coming there. When I saw her, I asked her ""is everything ok? I texted you and you didn't reply"" and she basically said that she maybe saw the message but had her mind in the clouds a bit, but basically flipped the script and made it about me not going to her house - so according to her the fault was mine since I didn't pop up to her place. I told her no, that I was waiting for her to reply to me. Of course I could have visited her or sent her a reminder, but the thing is that I am tired of chasing people. I am tired to beg for attention. She said to text her. I texted her. She didn't reply. That's it. She then said that my cousins will come to visit me once I am settled, confirming that she at least told them about it (if she said it to my other aunt I will never know because we don't talk, but at this point is very likely and she probably laughed at me and at what happened when she heard it).

Sometimes I feel bad because I do have some nice memories with her growing up, but I am so tired of this family drama. I did so much to build a life for myself, create my boundaries, heal from my traumas, find balance and feel happy and at peace, but every time I come back home I feel like the teenager of 20 - 15 years ago. Am I right not to trust this aunt? Fortunately I will leave in a couple weeks, but the same problem will present itself next time I visit, hopefully in quite some time.

**Hello hello!**

Allie X is a popheads gem, and to tell the complete story of how we got here, we need to go back to her previous album Cape God. 

**Background:** 

After the release of Cape God, Allie X's awaited Cape God tour [was canceled](https://www.nme.com/news/music/allie-x-cancels-upcoming-us-tour-dates-due-to-illness-3193495) due to a flair-up to her autoimmune disease. Allie X eventually released the deluxe to Cape God, but quietly took a back-seat from her art to recover. All of the traction she gained from Cape God was halted in its tracks. 

In her absence from the music scene, Allie X ran into controversy when [making headlines](https://ew.com/music/allie-x-responds-dog-in-car/) by being accused of leaving her dog in a hot car. After releasing a public apology, and after being radio-silent on any news of new music and going back on tour, Allie X needed her next move to change public narrative.

**Release:** 

After lightly teasing new music on social music, in an unexpected move, Allie X announced a brand-new single. With only a 4 day announcement, Allie X released 'Black Eye' on October 3rd, 2023. 

Then, after a month of speculation, Allie X announced her 3rd studio album 'Girl With No Face' [via Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/allie-x-new-album-girl-with-no-face-1234879341/) while also dropping her next single, 'Girl With No Face' on November 16th, 2023. With this announcement, it was also revealed that this was Allie X's first entirely self-produced album.

Allie X released 2 more singles before the album's release -- Off With Her Tits on January 18th 2024, and Weird World on February 21st, 2024. 

Two days after released Weird World, Allie X released her 3rd studio album 'Girl With No Face'. 

6 months later, Allie X would eventually announce going back on tour. 

On October 31st, 2024, Allie X launched her tour while simultaneously releasing the deluxe version of 'Girl With No Face' -- 8 months after the initial release of the album. 

**Reception:** 

The album received universal acclaim, and is hailed by many as her best album to date. Many fans praised her lyrical vulnerability for being candid with living with an auto immune disease. She was also praised for her triumph in self producing her first album, with many people complementing her production.

Public opinion of Allie X was not just restored but strengthened -- making her a staple in the indie-pop scene. 

---
  

**Weird World:**

In the album's introduction, Allie X talks about the reality of accepting that she will never be normal. As a nod to her experience living with a chronic illness, she finally comes to acceptance of how it has hindered her in a world that is forever changing. 

**Girl With No Face:**

In this song, she has transitioned into being the leader of a group of outcasts. She sings this song in first and third person, so it’s not clear if the person she’s singing about is herself or someone else. Or both? Whatever the intent is, the individual she’s singing about is a bad-bitch regardless. 

**Off With Her Tits:**

In this song, Allie X sings about being trapped in her body. This is a metaphor for being trapped in her body, or maybe she actually doesn’t like her own tits? Either way, this song’s lyrics are very cheeky, witty,  sarcastic, and is an album highlight.

**John and Jonathan:**

In this song, Allie Z sings about a gay couple. This could allude to the fact that she acknowledges that her fanbase largely consists of gay boys, and she ponders if they love her in the same way she loves them? Either way, John and Jonathan order cool coffee drinks at the cafe. 

**Galina:**

One of the album's best songs, Allie X sings about Galina. You could make the claim that this album is about Allie X pleading to herself through a 3rd person point of view to ‘wake up’, and if the context of Allie’s career is applied, it could be a retrospective view of telling herself to try and move past her illness. “I’m running out of time”, could be viewed as Allie pleading with herself that she needs to hurry up because her career is running out of time. 

**Hardware Software:**

One of the album’s out-of-pocket songs also directly addresses her inability to get out of bed and to lose strength due to her autoimmune disease. 

**Black Eye:**

At this point in the album, Allie accepts that with a black eye (a metaphor of sorts), she can continue moving forward. She can manage to live her life as-is, and is an empowering song to keep moving forward. Or maybe she’s a kinky masochist? I’ll let you decide. 

**You Slept on Me:**

While sampling [Maniac by Michael Sembello](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GCNUeTFSbA) on one of the album’s catchiest tracks, Allie X preemptively and accurately predicted this subreddit’s reception to this album.

**Saddest Smile:**

While being the last song produced on the album, Allie X sings about putting on a brave face and smiling through the pain. She’ll be smiling, despite being sad.

**Staying Power:**

In this song, Allie X sings about her sustainability in pop music. Despite that so many things are going wrong for her, she has staying power. She has been here, and bitch get ready 'cause she’ll always be here.

**Truly Dreams:**

Truly Dreams is Allie X’s come-full-circle moment on the album. While the album launches to her depressive relaxation that she’s in a word world, in this song, she loops back around to fully accepting it with grace. This song also beautifully concludes this album’s mission statement by bringing the album full circle. Due to the genius of how she pulled this off, Truly Dreams solidified itself as a career highlight for Allie X. It’s not only the best song on the album (in my opinion), but it’s one of the best songs in her entire discography.

- - - 

**Conclusion:**

Allie X had a comeback for the ages. Not only did she overcome hardship with her autoimmune disease, she came back with a vengeance and proved everybody wrong. While Girl With No Face wasn't wildly popular with the general public, hopefully this album will be reflected back as one of the pop-greats in the 2020's. 

Just like the song Truly Dreams says, Allie X ~~a weird girl~~ is *still our* dream girl in a weird world. With her music, she will always keep us dreaming... <3

**A Personal Thank You to Allie X:**


Allie, if you’re reading this, I want to personally thank you for this album. This album has done a lot to help people feel normal about their chronic illnesses, and has also meant a lot to queer/trans people as well. This album means so much to so many people, and we are grateful for your vulnerability and your bravery. Thank you.

1i8z62j,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1i8z62j/my_mother_has_very_poor_spending_habits/,My mother has very poor spending habits,"I struggled with spending a lot of money for a long time. I'm finally realizing where I get it from, my mother. 

Growing up we didn't have a lot of money. I'm very lucky to have a job now with stable income, however I'm still trying to unlearn the way I spend money. 

I didn't realize it until just now but I've learned all these behaviors from my mother. 

1. Although we didn't have a lot of money I would constantly see my mother spend money on BS. Like she would complain about how broke she was and that she was struggling, and then three days later will buy some shower gel because it's on sale. She still does this to this day. She'll tell herself she won't spend any more money on unnecessary products and then 3 days later come back with 5 things of shower gel. It's why there's no space in our closet. There's too much stuff up there that just isn't being used. I've picked up on this behavior and now I spend an ungodly amount of money on body care. I literally have like 10 lotions. Yes I use all of them but it's not necessary to have all of that. I'm not spending  any more money on body or hair care until everything I have is finished. One because I plan on moving and then two I just want to save money. 

2. When I was younger my mother would use gifts as an apology. I guess in a way I internalized this and would buy myself stuff when inwas sad. Also I don't have friends. I was stuck in the house 24/7 because of family issues and couldn't go outside. So I would just buy things to make me feel happy.

3. My mother has the worst spending habits on food. I just realized this like 20 minutes ago. Mt father went to Africa and gave me his OTC card which can be used to buy food and groceries. It only gets refilled every 3 months. Now my first mistake was telling my mom this. This card was supposed to last about 3 months. There's only 100 left in it when my dad receives like 500. My mom is wasting the money on it. She asked me if she could keep it because she wanted to buy coffee and potatoes. She said the coffee was almost finished, there's still coffee left irs half full. She also said there's only half a bag of potatoes, then use everything that is left. 

She just wants to waste the money at this point. She does not have a job for her to be wasting money like this. Then she's going to start complaining that she's struggling and can't afford food. I'm never trusting her with something like this again.

1i8z3a6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nook/comments/1i8z3a6/are_there_any_benefits/,Are there any benefits...,"to owning a nook over a kindle. Reason I'm asking is they just built a B&N 5 minutes from where I usually go to sit, read, and enjoy my coffee on Saturdays while reading a kindle or the occasional physical book and even signed up for something with B&N.

My son was wanting my Kindle and I saw the Nook station but I am not familiar with Nook anything. Are there any benefits to having a nook and a B&N account, is there like a kindle unlimited with nook?

I've seen a lot of YT vids recently and the nook isnt really favorable so not sure if its worth the investment or  if I should get my son his own kindle. Appreciate any advice, experience and or suggestions. Thanks!

Here's a video of me putting water inside my Flair 58+ chamber. I set the heating to max and the water enters the chamber over 5 minutes after the machine signaling the temp's been reached.

The beep you hear in the videos are from my kettle being rested on its base. The kettle in this video is set at 93 c, 220 ml of water. I usually work with less but I wanted to heat more to avoide possible issues with the kettle mismanaging temperature with low quantity of water. I've tested the performance of my kettle in the past and it seemed to work pretty well.

At the end of the video you can see the flair heating control lights flashing once again, like the hot water actually brought the temp of the flair down. 

If I wait a bit for the bubbles to disappear and pull a shot, it doesn't seem overly extracted to me and the resulting coffee in the cup is not particularly hot either.

Yet you can see the sizzle for yourselves. Do you guys have similar reactions?",1,1737735278.0,FlairEspresso,5,1.0,False
