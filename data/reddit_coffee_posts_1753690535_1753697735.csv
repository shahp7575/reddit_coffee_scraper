Smoother onset, less crash and still getting my Coffee Craving.","Ive been on 60mg Elevanse(Vyvanse in eu) for a couple of months now. And from my experience the best way to increase smoothness and consistency. And people seem to take it on many different ways and Ive just wanted to share the way i take it.

Here are the 3 Rules I've been following and what has been working best for me:

**1. Take the medication at the same time every day**

Consistency is key here, it sets the rhythm for your body and keeps a predictable rhythm for your body.

**2. Pair it with a ""small"" easy digestible, protein rich and some fats.**

Many users report taking it with a protein shake is optimal, I do agree with this statement, but with some trial and error I've refined it a bit for better digestion and sustained energy:

* Protein Shake (30-40g protein, made on water+milk)
* 1-2 bananas or some other fast digesting carb source
* 1 spoon honey (I love honey)
* 1 spoon of peanut butter

Take Only Elevnase now, no other supplements, ive experienced much less varied results. This combination gives a solid base without being to heavy, I find eating something a little extra like a banana and PB helps avoid the stomach getting upset by the Protein Shake, my stomach can get upset after only a protein shake making me not have the desire to eat more later.

I snack on the banana and peanut butter, chug half my protein shake and take my Elevanse and down the rest of the protein shake. Now just chill for an hour, take a walk or a morning run, meditate, stretch or take a nap if that's your thing, no pressure here.

**3. Eat a ""proper"" Breakfast, Drink your Coffee and Supplements at least an hour later:**

This is like a second breakfast, or more like a proper fully fledged meal. Containing more protein, healthy fats and some complex carbs. Healthy fats and proteins support brain function and gives long lasting energy.

Examples:

* Protein Oats
* Eggs, Whole Grain Toast and Avocados
* Greek Yogurt, Berries and fruits, more honey and a spoonful and

The Supplements i take and recommend in the morning are Fish Oils, Vitamin-D (most people are deficient) and a multivitamin, females should supplement with iron regardless IMO. (PSA I'm not a licensed nutritionist just what works for me)

Now enjoy your meal and coffee and when done get to work or just enjoy your day :)

And of course remember to stray hydrated, fill up your Stanley Cup or Motivational Bottle and maybe add some electrolytes, and have some easy small snacks on hand. And don't wait more than 3-4 hours before eating something small or a proper meal.



Keep in mind i am a male powerlifter, and swear by honey and PB, so i need to eat a lot. Everyone's appetites and nutritional needs differ, as allays ymmv. Good luck on experimenting and finding out what works for you. I do understand this routine does not work in everyone routine but that's what i do and it works for me.

Just the midday Elevanse peak speaking on a day without obligations. So i figured id share my findings and hopefully it helps someone else dialing in their routine. I'd love to hear how it goes if someone tries it out or have some twists in their routine",1,1753697628.0,VyvanseADHD,0,1.0,False

**DETAILZzza:**  
Needed a chic black backpack. Fast. Got fieldwork coming up in August, didn’t wanna bring anything too flashy or bulky. Just something sleek, low-key, still looks put together. That’s honestly why I decided so quick. No time for factory spreadsheets or weeks of window shopping. Just needed it handled. Done.

For context: been eyeing the auth Saint Laurent City Backpack since early 2023. Back when I didn’t even know this whole rep scene existed. I used to scroll the retail site and just stare at it. Never pulled the trigger, price was dumb. So when I saw it again as a rep and realized I could get basically the same thing for way less? Easy yes. Also, didn’t see this bag on any seller’s album, not even being lazy, I actually looked, so when it popped up? Again, EZ Yez.

Still kinda new to reps. A little paranoid about customs, 'cause let’s be real, things have been weird lately. So I didn’t ship it to my house. Used my office address, put my dog’s name as the recipient, and threw in a fake number just in case. Told the concierge like, “Hey, if a package comes under a weird name… just don’t ask.” And they didn’t. Bless.

And plot twist, it came way earlier than expected. Thought it’d land sometime in August. Showed up July 20, packed clean, zero issues, and pristine. No clue what shipping magic Rose pulled, but I’m not questioning it. Just grateful.

Bag’s... kinda scary close to auth ngl. Same size, same shape. Same feel. Leather’s soft. Not stiff. Doesn’t look plastic. Slouches how it should. Black’s deep, not that weird blue-ish tint some reps have. Hardware’s fine. Zips smooth. Stamp’s where it should be. Stitching’s clean. There’s like... a little wave on the top of the front pocket. You’d only notice if you’re really staring. Materials feel solid. Weight’s right. Doesn’t feel cheap. What else... and oh, TWO CONS: First thing that kinda sucked, took forever to air out. That factory smell? Heeella strong out the box. Threw in a dryer sheet and left it open for a day, it’s kinda fine now. hehe. Second, it's not that Matte BUT. I'm totally not mad about it.

Now the fun part,  
I work corporate. Lots of lowkey fashion police in the building. People who clock your bag before they say good morning. Walked in with the backpack, got a couple compliments. Someone even asked if I just got it from a store, it looked that fresh. So when they asked where I got mine, I just said,

Then went back to my iced coffee like I didn’t just ruin someone’s week.  
And if any of them are lurking here… yeah. They’ll prob know this is me. 🤣

**Would you recommend this item to others?** Absolutely yes. To my corp girlies and guys out there who always carry techs w/ them, yep this IS the B.A.G.

1mbcbkv,https://i.redd.it/r1l8k4w6blff1.jpeg,"(REMADE & IMPROVED) I got some speculation on what would happen next, for the story and WOTFI 2025 (i think)","After the events of Guns N' Puzzles, Mr. Puzzles is absolutely heartbroken and full of guilt after destroying his friendship with Mr. WPNZ and Toomp. Meanwhile, the latter two are being on the hunt from the Death Cube.

Mr. Puzzles out of nowhere saves the two by swooping in and holding their hands out of the area the death cube surrounded them. Mr. WPNZ and Toomp are still furious to Mr. Puzzles, when he clearly saved their lives. After a while, the two just say why he's here when he said they meant nothing to him. Mr. Puzzles responds by regretting his words, he now actually realises how much he and Toomp actually meant to him. At first, Mr. WPNZ denies, before Mr. Puzzles shows the bullet Mr. WPNZ gave him, saying that he still has it despite everything and changing his mind. Mr. WPNZ and Toomp do give him a second chance, but they don't immediately forgive him.

The 3 then make a little hideout from the Death Cube, as Mr. Puzzles tells Mr. WPNZ that when all of this is over, he will KILL the SMG4 crew. Mr. WPNZ stops him, saying that he's tried that before, with his own family. He tells Puzzles it's not worth it, there's no use trying to chase the same people. Eventually, you HAVE to let go. Make new friends. He knows this when Karen's kids turned from his side in Silence of the Cats. After a while, the 3 start to warm up to each other again.. It wasn't long before the Death Cube found them however. This culminates in another high speed chase with the 3 and the Death Cube. after some shenanigans, the Death Cube stops them by, as Mr. Puzzles is supposedly killed by the Death Cube. Furious, Mr. WPNZ and Toomp try to send in a finishing move before the Death Cube unleashes an attack that's never seen before, sending Mr. WPNZ and Toomp in the air.

For a moment, Mr. Puzzles is woken up in chains covered in demonic goop. He is then encountered by his insane side. His demonic side. His side tells him how useless he is. How he left the friends he's made from heart. How much he's failed too many times. He then sees his side destroy the bullet Mr. WPNZ gave him. In a blind rage, he frees himself from the chains and defeats the side in him, waking ip after being paralysed by the Death Cube, promising to save his friends.

Mr. WPNZ and Toomp go on to try and find the Death Cube so they themselves could finish it in memory of their fallen friend. Meanwhile, Mr. Puzzles tries to think of ways to track down the two. Eventually the 3 reunite, until not just the Death Cube once again finds them, but the entire police. One escape later, the police gives up on finding them, as they head back to the prison, ordered by Mr. Monitor. Meanwhile, the 3 escaoe from the police until they crash back to the Showgrounds. With no other option, Mr. WPNZ says they'll have to take shelter at the Showgrounds. Mr. Puzzles feels reluctant to do so, knowing that they all hate his guts.. but he lets him choose anyway.

They come across the SMG4 crew in the castle at the front door. They are all pissed off at WPNZ and Toomp for bringing Mr. Puzzles here, which he says they made up, with Puzzles replying that he's got nothing up his sleeve this time. The crew are reluctant, but they let them in anyway. Mr. Puzzles sees Meggy for a moment with a murderous look on his face, clenching his fist. Mr. WPNZ sees this and stops him for a moment, nodding his head in disapproval. Mr. Puzzles explains his whole ordeal with Meggy, to which Mr. WPNZ says that he should just move on from her like the convo from way earlier. Puzzles processes this, while Mr. WPNZ holds his hand onto his. Meggy sees this, seeing a bit of growth between him and WPNZ, before shaking her head and walking away.

Meanwhile, back in prison, Mr. Monitor is still trying to track down the 3, till he finds them in the Showgrounds. The Death Cube's eye illumates in the dark.. as it leads to WOTFI 25.

WOTFI 2025

The door knocks... The police pull up at the front door. Mr. Monitor immediately arrests the 3. Mr. Puzzles, Mr. WPNZ and Toomp all try their best to fight against the police, before they lose their battle as Puzzles and WPNZ are handcuffed, while Toomp is encased in a glass container. The crew stop them from being arrested, as they'll do anything to get them out of the situation (well not so much for Puzzles) so, Mr. Monitor challenges them to a game, where the officers, the Death Cube and him dare them to do various challenges to let them free. This also includes Puzzles, WPNZ and Toomp too... although they're given much deadlier challenges.

Many challenges later, Mr. Puzzles, Mr. WPNZ and Toomp are seemingly thought into doing a normal challenge, until they're caught off guard and get trapped in a giant metal box. Mr. Puzzles concocts a way out by asking Toomp to turn into a shovel and digging out (""... that was easier than I thought"") until the guards catch them as one final chase scene ensues... in the form of a rap battle. The SMG4 crew later distract the guards to catch up with the 3, as they and the Death Cube all catch up to them.

They all later arrive at the Border. Mr. WPNZ is in a very critical condition that he can no longer use his own weapons anymore. Toomp is nothing but a small pile of red goo. Everyone else is badly injured. It's over... Until Mr. Puzzles sees the gifted bullet... he knows exactly what to do. The Death Cube charges up it's full power, as it's ready to suck up everyone in the border.. until Mr. Puzzles chucks the bullet straight into it's mouth. The Death Cube starts to choke, as it starts to suck everything in, as everyone tries to not get sucked into it's mouth, while Mr. Puzzles is holding on to a lamppost to dear life. Soon, Mr. Puzzles instructs everyone to get Mr. WPNZ, Toomp and themselves out of the border. Mr. WPNZ sees Mr. Puzzles giving up his life to save everyone. He asks, ""COME HERE, YOU BASTARD, JUST GRAB MY HAND"" he says, to which Mr. Puzzles replies.. ""No... it's time I stop hurting others."" The others try to get out as fast as possible, while Mr. Puzzles lets go from the pole and gives up his life to save everyone due to realising how much pain and suffering he's caused. He closes his eyes, sheds one final tear as he's sucked in the mouth of the Death Cube, smiling, as he says one final line.. ""... That's all, folks."" as he turns the TV knob on his head, turning off his screen as the Death Cube explodes, killing everyone near the area. The others are hit by the waves of the explosion, knocking everyone out unconscious.

Soon after, everyone gets up from the damage. Mr. WPNZ and Toomp look around to find Mr. Puzzles, to which they see a giant pile of the debris of what was once the Death Cube. The two try and dig through the debris, hoping that Mr. Puzzles is within the debris... unfortunately, they weren't lucky. All they found were burnt TV parts, mangled beyond repair. All that remained intact were his hat and the gifted bullet, all of which have been burnt from the fiery explosion. Mr. WPNZ, completely frozen, fell to his knees.. as he lost a friend he truly had. Toomp comforted WPNZ, who is shaken by the loss of his fallen friend. The others see the commotion happening, to which they start to feel slight empathy for Mr. Puzzles. Meggy especially, as she finally saw that Mr. Puzzles DID indeed change for the greater good.

A few months later, Mr. WPNZ arrives at Karen's house, knowing she hates him, and that they can never be together again. He asks to keep Toomp with them to ensure that she and her kids are safe. Karen begrudgingly denies at first, before seeing how innocent Toomp is (and how he's like a dog), she does make her choice as she decides to keep him. However, before Karen could keep him in, Mr. WPNZ asks her to talk to him, to which she waits. Mr. WPNZ kneels down and says goodbye to Toomp, not before giving him Mr. Puzzles' burnt hat on his head, something to remember him and Puzzles by. Mr. WPNZ then says goodbye to Karen as he says he's got a coffee shop to guard. (3's) He leaves, not without the burnt bullet. He keeps it in his pocket as he walks away into the sunset.",1,1753697597.0,SMG4,1,1.0,False

I love my kid more than anything in the world. She’s funny, smart, adorable, everything. But… lately I’ve been feeling like I kinda don’t even know who *I* am anymore.

Before she was born, I used to write. Like actually write, poetry and journaling and all that stuff. I had time to *think*. I used to go on walks just to clear my head. Grab drinks with friends without planning it a week in advance. Sleep in. Binge shows. Just… exist. Be me.

Now I feel like I’m permanently in survival mode. It’s diapers, snacks, cleaning, meltdown, rinse and repeat. I can’t remember the last time I finished a coffee while it was still hot. I honestly miss *myself*.

And yeah, I know this is all part of the deal. And I don’t regret being a parent, not even for a sec. But I also feel like nobody talks about the fact that becoming a parent means saying goodbye to certain parts of your old self. And that sh\*t hurts sometimes.

1mbcb8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/bikers/comments/1mbcb8b/feeling_lost_after_friends_passing/,Feeling lost after friend's passing.,"Hi guys, I hope my post will be allowed and won't be triggering to anyone. But I'm feeling so lost right now. I don't ride motorbikes or drive, but I was lucky enough, in the past, to be a passenger on a sports bike, and had the best time. There's something goosebumpy about the sound, speed of one, let alone a few, passing by. What I'm trying to say I absolutely loooove bikes, although I don't ride. Anyway, back to why I'm writing here. A friend of mine, M62 got killed on his bike 18 days ago, after being hit by a van, driving on countryside roads. My friend used to live in those end, we randomly met about two years ago, around 30 minutes away on his bike, from where he lives. We became friends and he'd make the journey down every so often, for a catch up and a coffee. Old school legend in my eyes, full of amazing stories, loved his tattoos, started farming ducks and chickens, for the passion of it, wouldn't hurt a fly. His health was fragile all his life (he was a victim of a certain scandal but due to the stigma, he suffered in silence), he also had a big growth on his neck, and was due to have it removed soon. So he came on his bike, for a pre op catch up and coffee. We spoke about his life and it was super special. The next day I had a call from the police, trying to trace down his relatives, informing me of his passing that morning. And I haven't been right since. We mainly bonded, because he was also a loner, no family or kids, so it's all hit me even harder. 
I was assured by the police that my friend did nothing wrong. So the f van took him out that morning. My friend used to pride himself on having had invested into airbags fitted gear, he knew his health was fragile. I always said ride safe, and he'd reply I will, don't worry, and hey, I got my airbags to keep me safe, should anything happen. Airbags didn't save him, his expert knowledge of the roads didn't save, he didn't get the chance for the operation, its just so tragic and unfair. I am having t-shirts printed for awareness. But other than that, I feel powerless and really want to do something, either some petition for some change, or asking someone about organising a charity ride around those ends (p*ss all the drivers off, slow them down), but I wouldn't have a clue where to start, especially as I don't ride. Would anyone have any advice on what I could do to raise awareness? Are there enough signs for drivers on country side roads, informing them more of entry/exit points? 
Each time I hear a bike now, I send a thought to the rider - be safe! 
I know it's a lot to read etc, but I want to keep his memory alive. Let the world (or just the locals) know that he mattered. 
Be safe you all out there. Drivers are prix! ",1,1753697564.0,bikers,0,1.0,False

I will be moving into a new house in a few months and i want to reset/switch my coffee grinder setup at the same time. 

I also want to get more into filter/pour over coffee. But my wife solely drinks espresso with milk (1 each day). We therefore likely need a grinder setup that can handle espresso and filter coffee every single day. 

Budget around 1.000 **$**

My current setup is:

* Machine: Lelit Bianca V3
* Espresso grinder: Eureka Specialita
* Filter grinder: Wilfa Svart

I am looking into several different grinders and options. 

**Option 1: One grinder to rule them all!**

A grinder for both espresso and filter. Currently i have the follwing grinders on my watch list:

* Timemore Sculptor 64S
* DF64 Gen 2
* DF83V
* Mazzer Philos

Can you recommend one of these grinders for both espresso and filter daily ? Or would you recommend a different setup?

**Option 2: Two new grinders**

Two new grinders - one for espresso - one for filter (there is the option to keep the Eureka Specialita as espresso grinder). 

For this setup i have looked at:

Espresso: 

* DF64 Gen 2
* DF54
* Timemore Sculptor 64S
* DF83V
* Keep the Eureka Specialita

Filter: 

* Fellow Ode Gen 2
* DF64 Gen 2
* Timemore Chestnut S3

What is your setup like and is there any grinders i have missed? What is the best setup for around 1.000 dollars for both espresso and filter?",1,1753697548.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

One thing I’ve always wondered is that I always drink my daily energy drink and/or coffee when I go walking. Presumably this stimulant will elevate my HR and potentially slightly reduce my VO2 Max as a result? I’d be willing to forego caffeine for a while if I thought it would help me get to 65, ha!

**1. Cinnamon** – Helps regulate blood sugar and curb cravings. I throw it in coffee or oatmeal.

**2. Black Pepper** – Contains *piperine*, which may block fat cell formation. Bonus: it boosts absorption of other nutrients.

**3. Turmeric** – Anti-inflammatory (thanks to curcumin), which matters because inflammation is linked to fat gain.

**4. Ginger** – May boost thermogenesis and appetite control. Great in tea or smoothies.

**5. Cayenne Pepper** – *Capsaicin* raises body heat and may help burn more calories.

None of these are miracle fixes, but combined with solid habits, they can make a small but real difference. Plus, food just tastes better.

I didn’t respond. Couldn’t.

Every muscle screamed—RUN—but I just stood there, frozen. Like an idiot wax figure in a haunted diorama.

Because he was here.

The Night Manager.

He didn’t just look at me. He peeled me apart with his eyes—slow, meticulous, clinical. Like a frog in a high school lab he couldn’t wait to slice open. I didn’t move. Not out of courage. Just the kind of primal instinct that tells you not to twitch while something ancient and awful decides if you’re prey or plaything.

He tilted his head—not like a person, but like a crow picking over roadkill.

“Phase Two,” he said, “is not a punishment.” Great.

“Though if you prefer punishment,” he added, “that can be arranged.”

His voice was polished, sure—but empty. Like someone programmed a seduction algorithm and forgot to add a soul. “It’s an adjustment,” he continued. “A clarification of expectations. An opportunity.”

That last word made the old man flinch. And honestly? Good. Nice to know I wasn’t the only one whose stomach turned at the sound of him talking like a recruiter for a cult.

The Night Manager turned toward him, slow, and smiled wider.

“You remain curious.” He said it like it was a defect that needed fixing. The old man stayed silent. Maybe he wasn’t even supposed to be here—but right now, I was glad he was. Anything was better than being left alone with this thing.

Then those unnatural eyes locked on me. His grin aimed for human and missed by miles. “You’re adapting. Not thriving, of course—but surviving.”

Well, thank you for noticing, eldritch boss man. I do try.

Then—he moved. Or didn’t. I don’t know. There was just less space. “I evaluate personnel personally when they make it this far,” he said. “Five more nights, and then we begin your final review.” A performance review. Wonderful.

His grin stretched just a bit too far. Perfect teeth. The kind of smile you'd see in an ad for dental work… or on a predator pretending to be human.

“Most don’t make it this far,” he said, voice light now, like this was some casual lunch meeting. “Still, you’re not quite what I expected. But then again, you’re human—blinking, sleeping, feeling. Inefficient. But adorable.”

I spoke before I could stop myself. “You call us inefficient, but you spend a lot of time pretending to be one of us. For someone above it all, you seem… invested.”

Something flickered behind his eyes—not anger. Amusement. “Oh,” he purred. “A sense of humor. Careful. That tends to draw attention.”

He smiled again.

“Especially mine.”

Ew.

He stepped closer. “If you’re very good, and very quiet, and just a little clever…” His voice dripped syrup. “You might earn something special.” His grin stretched wider, skin bending wrong. “Something permanent.” From his jacket, he placed a black card on the shelf as if it might bite.

**Night Supervisor Candidate – Pending Review**

My heart stuttered.

“I’m not interested,” I said. My voice shook, pathetic but honest.

He leaned close enough to make the air taste rotten. “I didn’t ask what you’re interested in,” he murmured. “I asked if you’d survive.” Then he straightened, smoothed his immaculate lapel, and rushed toward the door like he was late for something.

At the door, he paused, one hand resting lightly against the glass as if savoring the moment. He looked back over his shoulder, eyes gleaming. “Oh, and Remi?”

My name sounded poisoned in his mouth.

“Try not to die before Tuesday,” the Night Manager said, smooth as ice. “I’d hate to lose someone… promising.”

He winked, then slipped out. The doors hissed closed behind him. The air didn’t relax—it thickened, heavy as a held breath, and for a long moment it felt like even the walls were listening.

I collapsed to my knees, legs drained of strength. My heart was pounding, but everything else inside me felt frozen. Somewhere between panic and paralysis. The old man had vanished too. No footsteps. No goodbye. One second he was there, the next… gone. Like there was a trapdoor in the floor only he knew about.

The store stayed quiet as if none of this had happened. I waited. One minute. Then two. Still nothing. Only then did I remember how to breathe. The Night Manager’s card still sat on the shelf. Heavy. Like it was waiting to be acknowledged.

I didn’t touch it.

Not out of caution, but because I didn’t trust it not to touch me back. I used a toothbrush and shoved it behind a row of cereal boxes, like it was a live roach, and headed toward the breakroom. I needed caffeine. 

In the breakroom, I poured the last inch of lukewarm coffee into a cracked mug and sat down just long enough to read the rules again. Memorize them. It was the only thing that made me feel remotely prepared. Eventually, I got up and forced myself to keep working. Restocking shelves felt normal. Familiar. Safe.

Until it wasn’t.

It was 4:13 a.m. I remember that because I had just finished putting away the last can of beans when I heard it. Tap. Tap. Tap.

On the cooler door behind me.

I turned automatically.

And froze.

My reflection was standing there. It was me—but not me. Something was off. Too still. Too sharp. Then it tilted its head. I mirrored the movement, instinctively. It smiled. And that’s when my stomach dropped. The first rule slammed into my mind like a trap snapping shut:

“**The reflections in the cooler doors are no longer yours after 2:17 a.m. Do not look at them. If you accidentally do, keep eye contact. It gets worse if you look away first.**”

So I didn’t look away.

I locked eyes with the thing wearing my face. It tilted its head again. Wider smile. Too wide. My skin crawled. My breath caught. I was stuck—and the rule didn’t say how to get out of this. I had one idea. Use the rules against each other.

I slipped my phone out, eyes locked on its gaze, and in a voice barely more than a whisper, I said: “Hey Siri, play baby crying sounds.”

Shrill wails filled the aisle. Instant. Echoing.

And I saw it—the reflection flinched.

Then I heard footsteps from Aisle 3.

Heavy ones.

I had used the second rule: “**If you hear a baby crying in Aisle 3, proceed to the loading dock and lock yourself inside. Stay there for exactly 11 minutes. No more. No less.**”

The reflection’s grin cracked, its jaw spasming like it was holding back a scream. Then it snapped, bolting sideways—jagged, frantic—and melted into the next freezer door like smoke sucked into a vent.

I didn’t wait to see what came next.

I ran. Sprinting for the loading dock, every step a drumbeat in my skull. But before I could slam the door shut, I glanced back.

Ten feet away, barreling straight for me, was a nightmare stitched out of panic and fever: a heaving knot of arms—hundreds of them—clawing at the tiles to drag itself forward. Too many fingers. Hands sprouting from hands, folding over each other like a wave of flesh. Faces pressed and stretched between the limbs like trapped things trying to scream but never getting air. It rolled, slithered and sprinted straight at me, faster than anything that size should move.

I slammed the door, locked it, killed the crying sound, and fumbled for my phone to set the timer. Eleven minutes. Exactly, like the rule said.

I sat on the cold concrete, shaking so hard my teeth hurt, lungs dragging in air that didn’t seem to reach my chest.

Three booming bangs shook the door, wet and heavy, like palms the size of frying pans slapping against metal.

Then—silence.

I stared at the timer. The seconds crawled. When the eleven minutes were up, I opened the door. And the store looked exactly the same. Shelves neat. Lights buzzing. Aisles quiet. Like none of it had ever happened.

But it had.

And I’d figured something out. This place didn’t just follow rules. It played by them. Which meant if I stayed smart—if I stayed sharp—I could play back. And maybe that’s how I’d survive.

The old man came again at 6 a.m. with the same indifference as always, like this wasn’t a nightmarish hellstore and we weren’t all inches from being ripped inside-out by the rules.

He carried a battered clipboard, sipped burnt coffee like it still tasted like something, and gave me a once-over that landed somewhere between clinical and pitying.

“You’re still here,” he said, like that was surprising.

I didn’t have the energy to be sarcastic. “Unfortunately.”

He nodded like I’d just reported the weather. “Did you take the card?” he asked.

I shook my head. “It didn't seem like a normal card”

The old man didn’t nod. He didn’t do much of anything, really—just stood there, looking at me the way someone looks at a cracked teacup. Not ruined. Not useful. Just existing without reason.

“You made it through the reflection,” he said finally. “That’s something.”

I leaned against the breakroom doorframe, hands still trembling, trying to pretend they weren’t. “Barely. Had to bait one rule with another. It felt like solving a haunted crossword puzzle with my life on the line.”

That, finally, earned the faintest twitch of a grin.

“Smart,” he said. “Risky. But smart.”

I waited. When he didn’t say anything else, I asked, “Why did he show up?” 

“He showed up because you’re still standing.” the old man said, his voice going flat.

I didn’t respond right away. That thought—that just surviving was enough to get his attention—made something cold slither under my skin. The Night Manager didn’t seem like the kind of guy who handed out gold stars. No. He tracked potential. Watched like a spider deciding which fly was smart enough to be worth webbing up slowly.

“Why me?” I finally asked.

The old man was already walking away, clipboard tucked under one arm. “You should ask yourself something better,” he said. “Why now?”

I followed him.

Down past the cereal aisle, past the cooler doors (which I now avoided like they were leaking poison), past the place where the mangled mess of hands chased me. That question stuck with me. Why now?

“Did you ever take the card?” I asked suddenly. “Did he ever offer it to you?”

The old man’s footsteps slowed. Just slightly. Barely enough to notice. But I did.

He didn’t turn.

“I said no,” he replied after a beat.

“And?”

“I’m still here, aren’t I?”

Not exactly comforting.

We walked in silence for a while, the hum of the fluorescents buzzing overhead like mosquitoes in a motel room. The store didn’t feel real anymore. It hadn’t for a while. It felt like a set, a stage. Like we were performing normalcy just well enough to keep something worse from stepping onstage.

“He said Phase Two was a clarification of expectations,” I said. “What does that actually mean?”

He gave me a look I didn’t like. Like he wasn’t sure if I was ready for the answer—or if saying it aloud would invite something to come confirm it.

Then he said, “It means you’re on your own now.”

I stopped walking.

“What?”

He turned to face me fully for the first time since we started this walk. “Up until now, the rules were enough. You followed them, or you didn’t. Cause, effect. But Phase Two means you’ve graduated from ‘basic survival’ to something else. Now things notice you.”

A beat. “And the rules?”

“They still matter,” he said. “But now they twist. Shift. Sometimes they bait you.”

I stared at him. “They bait you?”

He nodded. “And sometimes the only way out is by using one against another.”

I exhaled slowly. “So there’s no safety net.”

“No,” he said, almost gently. “But if it makes you feel better… there never was.”

I felt the walls press in again.

This wasn’t a job anymore. It never had been.

It was a trial. An experiment. A maze, maybe. With rules that sometimes saved you, and sometimes led you straight into the Minotaur’s mouth. And the Night Manager?

He was just the one watching which rats figured out the shortcuts—and which ones continued to stay in the maze.

That night, I slept like a log.

Not because I was calm—hell no. It was more like my brain knew I wouldn’t survive if I showed up to work even half-asleep. Like some primal part of me finally understood the stakes.

When I dragged myself in for the next shift, the old man was already there—just like always. Same bitter coffee, same battered clipboard. But this time, something about him was different. Not tired. Not grim.

Determined.

“It’s three more nights until your evaluation,” he said, like it mattered to both of us. I nodded slowly. “Should I be dreading the three nights… or the evaluation itself?” He didn’t answer right away.

Instead, I asked, “What happens after Phase Two?”

He froze. Just for a second. But enough.

Then he said it—quietly, like it was a confession, not a fact. “Oh. I never made it past Phase Two.” I blinked. “Wait… but you’re still here.”

He smiled. Not warmly. Not bitterly. Just… thin. Mechanical.

“Yes,” he said. “I am.”

Something in my gut twisted.

Because I know what happened to people who broke the rules. Who failed. They were erased. Gone like they’d never been here at all.

But him? He stayed. And that’s when I realized all the little things I’d been filing under “weird but whatever.”

The way the lines in his face deepened every day, like time was carving at him but never finishing the job. How he only ever sipped at that lukewarm sludge he called coffee, never swallowing enough to matter. How his footsteps made no sound. How the motion sensors never blinked when he walked by. How the store itself acted like he wasn’t even there.

“How long have you been here?” I asked, quieter than I meant to.

His eyes didn’t quite meet mine. “Long enough.”

The silence stretched.

“You okay?” I asked.

“I’m always okay,” he replied instantly.

Too instantly.

That was when I knew.

He looked like a man. Talked like one.

But whatever he was now…

Whatever Phase Two had done to him…

The [Mocha Bubble + Sans font duo](https://weandthecolor.com/mocha-bubble-sans-font-duo-sam-parrett-set-sail-studios/204865), a thoughtfully crafted pairing by Sam Parrett of Set Sail Studios, rises to this challenge with remarkable finesse. This font duo is not merely a fleeting trend; it represents a significant shift towards more organic, friendly, and approachable aesthetics in typography. Its relevance is underscored by the current design ethos that prioritizes authenticity and a human touch. The **Mocha Bubble + Sans font duo** delivers exactly that, making it a pivotal tool for designers and brands aiming to connect with their audience on a more personal level.

[The typeface is available here.](https://setsailstudios.com/downloads/mocha-bubblesans-font-duo/ref/234/)

This article will explore the intricacies of this unique font pairing. We will delve into what makes the Mocha Bubble and Sans fonts a cohesive and versatile system. We will also examine why this duo is gaining traction and how you can effectively leverage its distinct personality in your own creative projects. Prepare to be inspired by the playful possibilities that await.

# Deconstructing the Duo: What is the Mocha Bubble + Sans Font?

At its core, the **Mocha Bubble + Sans font duo** is a carefully curated set of four distinct yet complementary typefaces. Sam Parrett has created more than just two fonts; he has engineered a typographic system designed for interaction and creative exploration.

# Mocha Sans & Mocha Sans Bold

The foundation of this pairing is Mocha Sans, a modern and contemporary contrasted sans-serif font. Its clean lines and balanced proportions provide clarity and a touch of elegance. This font is a workhorse, suitable for body text, headlines, and everything in between. It comes complete with a full set of uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as punctuation.

Recognizing the need for emphasis and hierarchy, Parrett included Mocha Sans Bold. This bolded version maintains the core characteristics of the original but with added weight, making it ideal for creating visual impact or ensuring legibility at smaller sizes. Have you considered how a subtle change in font weight can dramatically alter the tone of your message?

# Mocha Bubble & Mocha Outline

The true star of this pairing is arguably Mocha Bubble. This playful, organic, hand-drawn bubble font injects a sense of fun and fluidity into any design. Its soft, rounded forms are whimsical yet controlled, avoiding the overly childish feel that can sometimes plague bubble fonts. Like its sans-serif counterpart, it includes a full set of uppercase and lowercase characters and punctuation.

To expand the creative possibilities even further, the duo includes Mocha Outline. This outlined version of the bubble font offers an additional stylistic layer. It can be used on its own for a light, airy feel or paired with the regular bubble or sans versions to create eye-catching, multi-dimensional text effects.

# The ""Why"": Analyzing the Appeal of the Mocha Bubble + Sans Font Duo

The rising popularity of the **Mocha Bubble + Sans font duo** is no accident. It taps into several key design trends and fulfills specific creative needs that resonate with modern audiences. Its appeal lies in the masterful balance between its two core components.

This font duo masterfully combines a clean, modern sans-serif with a playful, hand-drawn bubble font. This contrast is the source of its dynamic energy. The juxtaposition of the structured and the organic creates a visual harmony that is both engaging and aesthetically pleasing. This allows designers to convey professionalism and personality simultaneously. Think about the brands that successfully blend approachability with a sense of authority.

The hand-drawn quality of the Mocha Bubble font brings a much-needed human element to digital design. In an era dominated by pixel-perfect graphics, the organic and slightly imperfect nature of this font feels authentic and relatable. This ""human touch"" can make a brand feel more personal and trustworthy.

The inclusion of four distinct fonts (regular, bold, bubble, and outline) makes this duo incredibly versatile. It is not a one-trick pony. This set can be adapted for a wide range of applications, from branding and packaging to social media graphics and editorial design. The ability to mix and match these fonts within a single design, or even within the same word, opens up a vast playground for typographic experimentation.

# The ""How"": Practical Applications and Design Inspiration

Understanding the ""what"" and ""why"" is essential, but the real magic happens when you start applying the **Mocha Bubble + Sans font duo** to your own work. Here are some practical ideas and inspirational starting points to get your creative juices flowing.

# Branding and Logo Design

The **Mocha Bubble + Sans font duo** is exceptionally well-suited for creating memorable and approachable brand identities. The sans-serif font can be used for the primary brand name to ensure clarity and professionalism, while the bubble font can be used for a tagline or secondary brand mark to inject a dose of personality. This combination is ideal for brands in the food and beverage, children's products, or creative industries.

Consider using the Mocha Outline font layered over a solid version of the Mocha Bubble font for a three-dimensional effect in a logo. This can create a visually interesting and memorable mark that stands out from the competition.

# Social Media Graphics and Marketing

In the fast-paced world of social media, grabbing attention is paramount. The bold and playful nature of the Mocha Bubble font is perfect for creating eye-catching headlines and quotes for Instagram, Pinterest, and other visual platforms. Use the Mocha Sans font for supporting text to ensure readability.

How can you use this font duo to create a consistent and recognizable social media presence? By assigning specific roles to each font within your design templates, you can build a cohesive visual identity that is instantly associated with your brand.

# Packaging and Product Design

The tactile and organic feel of the **Mocha Bubble + Sans font duo** makes it an excellent choice for packaging design. The friendly and approachable nature of the fonts can make a product feel more inviting on the shelf. Imagine this font duo on a bag of artisanal coffee, a jar of organic jam, or the packaging for a line of natural skincare products.

The legibility of the Mocha Sans font ensures that important information, such as ingredients and instructions, is clear and easy to read, while the Mocha Bubble font can be used for the product name to create a strong visual hook.

# Editorial and Web Design

While the bubble font might be too playful for long-form body text, it can be used to great effect for headlines, pull quotes, and section titles in magazines and on websites. The Mocha Sans font, with its excellent readability, is a solid choice for the main body copy. This combination can make editorial content feel more dynamic and engaging.

# A Font Duo for the Modern Designer

The **Mocha Bubble + Sans font duo** by Sam Parrett is more than just a collection of fonts; it is a versatile and expressive typographic tool that empowers designers to create work that is both contemporary and full of personality. Its thoughtful design and comprehensive character sets make it a valuable addition to any font library. Whether you are a seasoned professional or just starting, this font duo offers a world of creative possibilities waiting to be explored.

1mbc2w8,https://youtu.be/scaSlMva7fE,I Tested the New ChatGPT Agent: It's a Glimpse into the Future of Personal AI Assistants,"Hey everyone,

OpenAI recently rolled out the ""ChatGPT Agent,"" and it's a significant leap from the conversational AI we're used to. Instead of just answering prompts, it now has a ""toolbox of skills"" to actively perform multi-step tasks. It essentially operates within its own virtual machine, allowing it to browse the web, run code, create files, and interact with external tools.

I spent some time testing its capabilities and documented it in a video. Here are a few things I had it do:

* **Competitor Analysis:** I gave it a URL and asked it to find the top 5 competitors and summarize the findings in a CSV file. It browsed the web, gathered the data, and generated the downloadable file.
* **Trip Planning:** I asked it to plan a 10-day trip with a $1000 budget, specifying my passport type. It researched visa-free destinations, found flight options on Skyscanner, and compiled hotel recommendations.
* **Presentation Creation:** I prompted it to create a slide deck on ""Coffee Consumption Around the World."" It researched the data, generated charts, found relevant images, and put together a 9-slide presentation.

The whole process is transparent; you can watch the agent's ""play-by-play"" as it works and even take over the browser to intervene if needed.

This feels like a major step towards autonomous AI agents that can handle complex, real-world tasks. It's not perfect yet, but the potential is massive.

1mbc2qu,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mbc2qu/the_apple_orchard/,The Apple Orchard,"The apples were already ripe when she arrived.

Bright red, fat with juice, bending the branches in the early October sun. Which was strange, because no one had harvested this orchard in years.

Marla stood at the edge of the trees, suitcase still in hand, and stared.

Her uncle's house sat up on the hill behind her — a sagging Victorian thing with moss on the shingles and a roof that dipped like it was tired. He’d died alone in that house last winter. A neighbor found him in the kitchen, door wide open, frost in his beard. No sign of violence. Just gone.

Now the house — and the orchard — belonged to her.

She was going to sell it.

Stay a week, clean it out, sign the papers. Maybe take a jar of apple jam for the road.


__________

On her first night, she heard singing.

It came from beyond the trees, low and lilting, like a hymn hummed through closed lips. She stepped onto the porch, wrapped in her coat, and saw no one. Just the orchard shifting in the wind, leaves trembling like breath.

The next morning, an apple lay on her windowsill.

Not placed. Not fallen. It was standing upright, perfectly still, with a bite missing.


__________

The locals didn’t ask what she was doing there.

At the diner in town, the waitress handed her coffee and said, “You’re not staying long, are you?” The tone was polite. The eyes were not.

Marla shook her head. “Just cleaning the place up.”

“Good.” The woman smiled, thin. “Storm season’s early this year. Lotta trees get cranky.”

Cranky?

She let it go. Thought maybe it was a saying.

But when she stopped at the hardware store, the man behind the counter asked if she had salt.

“For what?”

“For the edge of the orchard,” he said. “If you’re staying the night.”

She didn’t answer.

He put the salt in her bag anyway.


__________

On the third night, she found the masks.

They were in the shed. Old, carved from wood, painted in earth tones. Red mouths. White eyes. And one larger than the rest, split down the center like a seed pod.

They smelled faintly of iron.

A note sat beneath them, scrawled in her uncle’s hand:

“Do not let the last fruit fall.”

That night, the trees moved without wind.


__________

Marla stopped sleeping. She watched the orchard from the attic, flashlight clutched tight. Some of the apples were turning brown — but not rotting. Just darkening. Like bruises that went all the way to the core.

At midnight, she saw figures between the rows.

Not people. Not quite.

They were tall and slight, with limbs that bent too smoothly. The bark didn’t creak beneath them. It sighed. One of them turned — slowly — and looked up toward the attic.

Toward her.

She ducked before it could raise its hand.

In the morning, there were hoof prints in the frost.


__________

On the fifth day, she packed.

Screw the house. Screw the sale. Let the realtors deal with it.

She threw her suitcase in the car and hit the gas. Made it fifteen miles before the road curved in a way it shouldn’t. Too tight. Too long.

And then the orchard was there again, waiting.

Same wind. Same smell. Same ripe, red apples bowing low as if offering themselves.

She got out, shaking.

A small boy stood at the edge of the trees, watching her.

He didn’t speak. Just pointed to the orchard. His shirt was soaked to the elbows. Sticky. Red.

“Who are you?” she whispered.

He smiled — and behind his teeth, there were seeds.


___________

That night, the apple fell.

Just one. The final one. It landed soft, soundless, in the wet grass beneath the oldest tree.

The wind died. The house groaned.

And something opened in the ground.

A split in the soil, too round to be natural. Sweet rot spilled up from it, thick and warm and humming.

Marla didn’t scream.

She put on the mask instead.

The largest one.

The one that split like a seed pod.

Because some part of her knew. Some blood memory in her bones told her the truth:

The orchard didn’t grow because of sunlight or rain.

It grew because every year, it was fed.

# Best Soaps 2025: reviews & How to Choose

The humble bar of soap has come a long way. No longer just a basic cleansing tool,today's soaps offer a wide array of benefits,from nourishing skin and fighting acne to providing aromatherapy and supporting sustainable practices. With so many options available,finding the perfect soap for your individual needs can feel overwhelming. This guide explores the best soaps projected for 2025, providing detailed reviews and offering guidance on how to choose the right soap for a healthy, happy clean.

## Key Features Analysis

The best soaps of 2025 are expected to showcase advancements in natural ingredients, sustainable practices, and specialized formulations.

**Natural and Organic Ingredients**

Modern consumers are increasingly aware of the ingredients in their skincare products. The top soaps will prioritize natural and organic ingredients, such as plant-based oils (olive, coconut, shea), essential oils, and botanical extracts. These ingredients are gentler on the skin, less likely to cause irritation, and often provide additional benefits like moisturizing and antioxidant properties. The demand for openness in ingredient sourcing is also driving innovation in this area.

**Sustainable and Eco-Friendly Practices**

Sustainability is a major driving force in the soap industry. Leading brands will focus on eco-friendly packaging (recycled, recyclable, or biodegradable), ethical sourcing of ingredients, and reduced water consumption in manufacturing processes. Look for certifications like Leaping Bunny (cruelty-free) and RSPO (sustainable palm oil) to ensure that the soap aligns with your values.Many soaps will also be packaging free.

**Specialized Formulations**

Beyond basic cleansing, soaps are now formulated for specific skin types and concerns. Expect to see a wider variety of soaps designed for sensitive skin,dry skin,oily skin,acne-prone skin,and even conditions like eczema and psoriasis. These specialized soaps often contain targeted ingredients like colloidal oatmeal, ceramides, salicylic acid, or tea tree oil to address specific needs.

**Aromatherapy and Sensory Experience**

The sensory experience of using soap is becoming increasingly important. Many soaps now incorporate essential oils and natural fragrances to provide aromatherapy benefits during cleansing. Lavender, eucalyptus, peppermint, and citrus scents are popular choices, offering a range of moods and effects from relaxation to invigoration.

**Exfoliating Properties**

many consumers look for soaps that provide light exfoliation. This is achieved through the addition of natural exfoliants such as ground oatmeal, coffee grounds, dried herbs, or jojoba beads.These ingredients help to remove dead skin cells, leaving the skin feeling smoother and brighter.

Key features of the best soaps of 2025 include:

 Natural and organic ingredients
 Sustainable and eco-friendly practices
 specialized formulations for different skin types
 Aromatherapy and sensory experience
* Exfoliating properties

## Core benefits

The best soaps will provide a range of benefits beyond simply cleaning the skin.

**Gentle and Effective Cleansing:** The soaps will deliver a thorough cleanse without stripping the skin of its natural oils. This is crucial for maintaining healthy skin barrier function and preventing dryness and irritation. Many soaps will feature a balanced pH formulation to further ensure gentle cleansing.

**Skin Nourishment and Hydration:** High-quality soaps will incorporate moisturizing ingredients like glycerin, shea butter, and hyaluronic acid to replenish the skin's moisture levels during cleansing. This helps to prevent dryness and keep the skin feeling soft and supple.

**Targeted Skin solutions:** Soaps formulated for specific skin concerns, such as acne or eczema, can provide targeted relief and support. Ingredients like salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, or tea tree oil can help to combat acne, while colloidal oatmeal and ceramides can soothe and protect sensitive skin.

**Overall Skin Health and Appearance:** Regular use of the right soap can contribute to overall skin health and appearance. Clean, well-hydrated skin is less prone to dryness, irritation, and premature aging. Certain ingredients, like antioxidants, can also help to protect the skin from environmental damage.

**Enhanced Well-Being Through Aromatherapy:** The use of essential oils in soaps can provide aromatherapy benefits, promoting relaxation, reducing stress, and improving mood. This can contribute to a more positive and enjoyable cleansing experience.

## FAQs Section

**What Ingredients Shoudl I avoid In Soap?**

Avoid soaps containing sulfates (SLS/SLES), parabens, phthalates, artificial fragrances, and dyes. These ingredients can be harsh on the skin and perhaps harmful to your health. Choose soaps with natural and organic ingredients whenever possible.

**How Do I choose The Right Soap For My Skin Type?**

If you have dry skin, look for moisturizing soaps with ingredients like shea butter, glycerin, or hyaluronic acid. For oily skin, choose soaps with gentle cleansing agents and ingredients like tea tree oil or salicylic acid. Sensitive skin requires mild, fragrance-free soaps with calming ingredients like colloidal oatmeal or chamomile.**Are Bar soaps More sustainable than Liquid Soaps?**

Generally, yes. Bar soaps typically have less packaging, which is frequently enough recyclable or biodegradable. Liquid soaps, conversely, require plastic bottles that may not always be recycled. Though, the sustainability of a soap also depends on the sourcing of its ingredients and its manufacturing processes.

**How Often Should I Be Showering With Soap?**

This depends on your activity level and skin type. If you have dry skin, showering with soap every other day or less may be sufficient. If you are vrey active or have oily skin, you may need to shower with soap daily.Avoid overwashing, as this can strip the skin of its natural oils.

1mbc0ug,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_anudeepika/comments/1mbc0ug/conversations_ill_never_forget_lessons_that/,“Conversations I’ll Never Forget — Lessons That Changed Me”,"*“Sometimes one sentence can change the direction of your whole life.”*

Some words stay with you long after they’re spoken. Right ?

They arrive unexpectedly — over coffee, in a long walk with a friend, having a conversation on a dinner table with family or during those quiet moments when someone sees something in you that you haven’t yet seen yourself. These conversations don’t fade, they stay in your mind forever and reflect back to remind you who you are and what you deserve.They stay, like bookmarks in the pages of your life.

Here are a few that keep on reflecting when required. Maybe they’ll mean something to you too.

# 1. “Value yourself. Stop giving second chances to people who never gave you a first try.”

I was in a loop of forgiving the same people. It always happens to me. Giving energy to those who never really showed up for me. Telling myself, *“Maybe they’re just busy. Maybe I expect too much.”*

But during a conversation with someone once told me this :  
Stop convincing yourself they’re not that bad when you always leave feeling worse. That’s not love. That’s your fear of being alone dressed up as loyalty. ***It made me realize that, People who care don’t leave you guessing. They make you feel safe, seen, and supported. They will always be true to you.***

So, finally I try stop returning to places that didn’t welcome me the first time. I started choosing people who chose me back. It was difficult at first. But eventually, peace took the place of chaos. That’s how I knew I was growing.

# 2. “Love people who love you — not the ones you keep trying to convince.”

This one came during a vulnerable conversation with my brother and I will never forget this. I was telling him how much I had done to keep someone or everyone I like in my life — how I texted first, made plans, forgave their silence, accepted the excuses.

He asked me, ***“But what do they do for you?”***

That’s when I realized: I was pouring from my cup into someone else’s, while mine stayed empty. And I should do whatever I want to do for other but, without any expectations. And, value people who value me at first.

We often chase the love we want, not realizing we’re ignoring the love that already surrounds us. The friend who always checks in. The colleague who listens without judgment. The family member who celebrates even our smallest wins.

Sometimes, the people we overlook are the ones who truly see us.

Now, I choose trying to invest my energy where it returns with warmth. That shift alone has changed the quality of my relationships.

# 3. “Always value the people who know your worth — and remind you of it when you forget.”

We all have days when we doubt ourselves. When we question if we’re good enough, smart enough, or doing enough.

*“You don’t need to prove your worth. The right people already know it.”*

It reminded me how important it is to keep people in your life who reflect your best qualities — not just your flaws. Who remind you of your growth, not just your mistakes. Who hold up a mirror and say, *“Look how far you’ve come.”*

Those people are rare. When you find them, hold them close.

# 4. “Degrees are just paper. Experience is your real qualification.”

I’ve always respected education. But there was a time I let a gap in my formal learning make me feel “less than.” Like I had to catch up. Like I didn’t belong in certain rooms.

Then one day, I heard someone say this in one of the video on YouTube  
*“Your life experiences are worth more than a thousand certificates. You’ve lived, learned, adapted. That’s your edge.”*

The lessons I’ve learned through heartbreak, moving abroad, learning to live alone, managing finances, building resilience, working hard, try to get best in everything— they’re not written on a resume, but they’ve shaped who I am more than any degree could.

Books give knowledge. But life gives wisdom. Both matter. But don’t let one invalidate the other.

* Have you ever held onto someone who didn’t hold onto you?
* Are there people in your life who remind you of your worth — or only make you question it?

We grow through experiences, yes. But often, it’s the words people say — the ones we weren’t expecting — that truly plant a seed of change.

So here’s a thought: Next time someone says something that shakes your perspective or brings comfort, write it down. Carry it with you. Let it guide you.

# Closing thoughts

Not all conversations are long or dramatic. Some last just a minute. But the right words, said at the right time, can stay with us for years.

And when you really listen — not just to others, but to yourself — you start to realize that you’ve collected a library of truths.

Use them. Share them. And maybe, your words will be the conversation someone else never forgets.",1,1753696522.0,u_anudeepika,0,1.0,False

1mbbx7t,https://i.redd.it/23ffz6cr6lff1.jpeg,Stop for Gas,"Weary and tired and with many miles to go, Ed pulled off the highway for gas and coffee.

He pulled into the dusty station and got out of the car and stretched.  It had been at least half an hour since the last station he saw, and in West Texas, who knew how long it would be until he saw another? 

“Been at it awhile?”  He turned towards the voice.  Sitting in a rusty lawn chair by the entrance was an skinny old woman with curly, dirty white hair. She looked to Ed a bit like Betty White, if Betty White hadn’t ever done The Golden Girls but instead had picked up a meth habit. 

“A bit, yeah.  Heading to Houston.”  Ed reached for the pump.

“Don’t you even think of it!  I’ll take care of that for you,” she hurried over to take the pump out of his hand.  “You just relax a sec.  Houston’s still quite a ways off.” 

“Thanks,” he said.  Watching as she popped open the lid to his gas tank and slid the pump in. 

“Fill her up?” She asked.

He nodded, standing there awkwardly.  He hated full service stations.  Not only was he fully capable of doing this chore himself, but he hated this awkwardness.  Is he expected to tip?  He had never been sure.  On a road trip through New Jersey, it seemed that every gas station attendant had frowned at him when he didn’t tip, but maybe they were just assholes. In New Jersey, you could never be sure who the asshole was in any given situation, you could only be sure there was one.

“You got a restroom?” He asked. 

“Yep,” she pointed. “Just around back there. The sign says you need a key, but it ain’t working right.  There’s a bolt on the inside.” 

“Thanks.” He walked towards the bathroom.  He didn’t need to go, he just needed to be away from the old lady. 

“There’s coffee inside if you want it!” She called after him. “Just made the pot fresh!”

“Thanks,” he called back to her as he turned the corner.  The bathroom door was rusty and propped open with a small tin trash can. 

He nudged the trash can aside with foot and tried closing the door, but it wouldn’t quite close all the way. No matter.  He had just wanted a few minutes alone anyway. 

He stood there, next to the toilet, trying to not to breathe in the stink and checked his watch.  Just after four o’clock.  He just might make it before midnight. 

After waiting a full minute, he flushed the toilet with his shoe and stepped out of the bathroom.  Like it or not, he had to deal with Methy White for just a minute more before he could get the hell out of this shithole. 

“Woah, there!”

As he turned the corner, he found her standing there, waiting for him, a cup of coffee in her hand.

“Got a cup of coffee for you!  On the house.  Didn’t know how you take it.”

“Uh, black is fine.  Thanks.”  He took the cup. 

“There’s cream and sugar inside if you want some. Don’t say you fine if you ain’t, now.” 

He took a sip.  It was bitter, but fine. He just needed the caffeine. 

“How much do I owe you?”  He pulled out his wallet, but struggled while also holding the coffee.

“Oh, the coffee’s free, hon.” 

“Of course.  Thanks, again. But the gas?”

“Oh, Jesus, I’d lose my tits if they weren’t hanging off me. Of course for the gas. Let’s go and check.”

She strolled inside the little station and he followed.  He had to smile.  She was sweet in her own toothless sort of way. 

She walked behind the register and started poking at buttons.  “It’ll come to about 38 dollars and fourteen cents.” 

“Sounds good.”  He set the coffee down on the counter and pulled two twenties out of his wallet and watched as she counted out the change. 

“You been here long?”  He asked, trying to be polite for a change. 

“Oh, I’ve been in the area all my life.”  She handed him one wrinkled dollar and some coins. 

“Does it get lonely?”  He asked, sliding the money into his wallet. 

“Oh, my.  You’d think so, but no,” she replied. “Every new customer’s like a new friend.” She smiled.

He smiled back.  “Well, it was very nice to meet you...”

“Barbara. But call me Babs. Everyone does.” 

“It was nice to meet you, Babs.  And thanks again for the coffee.”  He held up his cup, toasting her before he turned back towards his car. 

She followed him outside, watching him get in. 

“Drive safe!” She called, waving to him as he strapped on his seatbelt. 

He nodded back. He took one large gulp of coffee before he turn the key in the ignition. 

The dashboard lights came on, but the gas gauge didn’t rise. The arrow stayed firmly pointed at “E”. 

“That’s funny,” he thought to himself as he drifted forward.  His eyelids suddenly felt very heavy and he could feel a slight tingling in his fingers. 

He struggled to look up at her, standing at his passenger window, smiling from ear to ear. 

He collapsed. 

Babs came around to his side of the car and reached over his slumped body to grab the cup of coffee from the cupholder. She poured it out beside the car. 

Skillfully, she reached into the car and slipped it into neutral and started to move the car forward.

With years of practice, she was able to handle the car better than any onlooker would have ever expected.  Behind the station, there was a gaping hole in the ground, a deep, dark pit.  She wrestled with Ed’s pants for a moment to free his wallet, then slid the car the last few feet and watched it tumble down into the darkness.

“Y’all come back now,” she smiled, counting the money in the wallet.

Mia Turner stood frozen at the entrance to the living room, her fingers clutching the strap of her work bag. Her sister Lily had interrupted her while she was getting ready, insisting their mother had something important to discuss. 

“Mia, sit down,” her mother, Mary Turner, ordered, lounging on the worn-out sofa like a queen holding court. Her bright red lipstick clashed with the faded blush on her face, her manicured nails tapping against her wine glass.

“Can’t this wait? I have work,” Mia replied, her voice tight. “I can’t afford to be late again.”

Her mother raised an eyebrow. “Work? You mean playing servant to those rich snobs at Casa Lounge? Please.”

Mia bit her tongue. She knew better than to rise to the bait. She needed this job. Casa Lounge wasn’t just a paycheck; it was her lifeline, the first step in her plan to save enough money to leave Willowcrest and the stigma of being a Turner behind.

Ethan, her older brother, sat slouched in the corner, scrolling through his phone. His indifference to the chaos of their family was almost admirable. At least he stayed out of the endless bickering.

“What’s this about, Mom?” Mia asked, her patience slipping.

Mary’s lips curled into a smile. “We have good news.”

Mia blinked, skeptical. “Good news?”

“Yes!” Lily, the eldest, jumped in, practically glowing with excitement. “I got a golden invite to the Willowcrest Unicorn Party!”

Mia blinked again, slower this time, trying to process how this was supposed to be good news. The Unicorn Party—the most exclusive, over-the-top event for the rich and powerful—was as far removed from her world as the moon.

“And this is good news… how?” Mia asked, genuinely baffled.

“Attending will be nice though,” Ethan muttered without looking up from his phone.

“Nice?!” Lily’s voice rose an octave. “Do you have any idea what this means? The richest bachelors in the world will be there! This is it!”

“And how did your name end up on the list?” Mia asked, her tone sharper than she intended.

“Connections,” Mary said smugly, swirling her wine.

Mia didn’t want to dig deeper into what kind of “connections” her mother was referring to. She knew the answer wouldn’t be pleasant.

“Okay, so Lily’s going to some fancy party. What does that have to do with me?” Mia asked, checking the time on her phone. She really couldn’t afford to be late.

Mary leaned forward, her voice dropping into a conspiratorial tone. “This is our chance, Mia. Lily just needs to catch the eye of the right man. A billionaire. Someone who can change all our lives.”

Mia resisted the urge to roll her eyes. Of course, it was another one of her mother’s schemes. Everything in Mary Turner’s life revolved around chasing rich men, and her daughters were no exception.

“I’m happy for Lily,” Mia said flatly, rising to leave. “Congratulations and good luck with the party. I have to go.”

“Sit down, Mia,” Mary snapped, her tone sharpening.

“I can’t be late—”

“Sit!”

Reluctantly, Mia dropped back onto the couch, glancing at the clock on the wall. She was already cutting it too close.

“Listen, you all know how much we suffer and lose after that old bastard put me in Jail. This is a one time opportunity that will change our lives forever”

“ How does that even concern me? Or did the whole family get invited?”

“You wish…” Lily said with snort. “ No one is inviting you to that kind of party with that face”

Ethan chuckles, pulling eyes to him

“Lily you have to stop pretending, like Mia isn't the prettiest in this family” Ethan said, eyes still fixed on his phone.

“Eww, don't say it like that you're my brother” Mia smiles, always trying to get under his brother's skin

“Did I mention she is the most stupid?”

“I try”

“Enough both of you” Mary scolds

“I seriously need to get to work mom, whatever this is obviously doesn't concern me”

“Always so proud talking about it, like it's a real job?” Anna, the middle sister, said with a snide laugh.

“At least I’m doing something!” Mia snapped.

Before the argument could escalate further, Mary’s phone buzzed. She checked the screen, a sly smile spreading across her face. “Same time, same place, Barry? I’ll be there,” she said into the phone, her voice dripping with seduction.

Mia felt a wave of disgust wash over her. She didn’t need to guess what the call was about. It was her mother’s usual business—entertaining some wealthy man in exchange for cash, gifts, or favors.

As Mary hung up, she turned her attention back to Mia. “The point is, we all need to contribute to get your sister everything she needs for that party. You included.”

“This is ridiculous mom! Count me out,” Mia said, her voice steely.

Mary’s eyes narrowed. “Don’t be selfish, Mia. This is for the family.”

“I don't have have money”

“Yes you do” Anna rushed to say. “You've been saving a lot of money for college.”

“Like you said college”

“This is more than college and I've told you a thousand times you're a Turner you have no business with College” Mary says, checking her phone.

“ And I have said it a million times, I'm not like you! I don't want to be like you, I don't want to sit around and wait for some rich guy to come change my life”

“So you think you're better than us now?”

“Oh my god! I'm leaving. Lily I'm sure you can sort yourself out, and if you do get your billionaire boyfriend or husband remember not to give me a dime from his money”

Mia grabs her bag and heads for the door.

College in another country is her way out, no one is jeopardizing that for her.

There's nothing she wants than to leave this town, remove the curse name she bears from her existence.

“Oh you're a Turner, never mind”

“You're a Turner you have no say”

“Girl you're a Turner”

“You're Turner Shut up and open your legs”

“Not a Turner trying to form modesty”

# Chosen For The Game

Alexander Blackwell was known for many things in Willowcrest: his wealth, his looks, his reputation as the bad boy every story tried to capture, but never quite could. Patience, however, wasn’t on the list. Yet, for Zoe Harrington—his girlfriend—he tried. Tried being the word.

Casa Lounge was his usual spot in the evenings, the perfect escape before his underground matches. Tonight, though, he wasn’t supposed to be here. He had a fight in less than two hours, but it was Zoe’s birthday. And Zoe got what Zoe wanted—most of the time.

He sat back in his booth, swirling his glass of whiskey lazily as he watched Zoe talking to a new face in Willowcrest, her glittery dress hugging her like a second skin. She was shamelessly rubbing her body on him—Dickson, or whatever his name was. A new face in Willowcrest, clearly is unaware of who Alexander was.

The sight didn’t bother him; nothing Zoe did ever truly got under his skin. Their relationship thrived on chaos. He smirked, watching her antics, amused more than anything else. She was testing him, as always.

When Zoe finally realized her games weren’t ruffling his feathers, she walks over to him, her pout on full display.

“You don’t even get jealous anymore,” she whined, plopping down beside him.

Alexander looked up from his glass, his voice calm and cool. “What do you want me to do, break some poor guy’s nose?”

Her pout deepened. “When did you even start caring about people?”

“I don’t.”

“Exactly my point!” She crossed her arms, glaring. “You’re so… boring now.”

Alexander hummed in response, his attention flicking toward the crowd again. But then his gaze caught on someone. A Turner.

There she was laughing with her coworker at the bar. Her smile lit up her otherwise simple features, her uniform crisp and modest.The sight of her irritates him.

He did consider asking his friend that owns the place to fire her when they first employed her.

“Man, why would you employ a Turner?”

“She's pretty”

“Still a Turner”

“Won't be one when her pretty lips are wrapped around my dick”

“Seriously?”

“Come on I want to have a taste of all of them”

He blinks back to reality, jaw tensed. He knew all about the Turners. Everyone in Willowcrest did. A family that had no business staying in this town.

“I feel like our spark is dying.”

Alexander sighed, half-listening as he took another sip of his drink. “You say that every day, babe.”

“I mean it this time. I think we need… more games.”

He raised a brow, setting his glass down. “Games? Zoe, we did threesomes the entire month of October. What’s left?”

She leaned forward, pressing her lips against his, her tone dropping to a playful whisper. “I want us to go extreme this time.”

He tilted his head, watching her with mild amusement. “You’re insane.”

“We both are.” She smiled sweetly, her eyes glinting with mischief.

He sighed, leaning back. “What’s your big idea this time?”

“We break up for a month,” she began, her smile widening. “We each date someone new. You sleep with them, I sleep with mine.”

Alexander stared at her, incredulous. “You’ve officially lost it.”

“Oh, come on! It’ll be fun,” Zoe pressed. “It’s not like we don’t always find our way back to each other.”

“And what’s the benefit of this game? Or is this just your twisted idea of fun?”

“To spice up our relationship!” she said as though it were obvious. “And—” she added with a wink—“you’ll be saying no to my birthday present if you don’t agree.”

“Thought you wanted a shopping spree in Paris?” he drawled.

She waved it off. “Changed my mind.”

Alexander sighed, rubbing his temple. “Fine.”

Zoe practically squealed, climbing into his lap to kiss him. “Thank you, baby!”

“I’m already regretting this,” he muttered against her lips.

“Okay, okay, let’s pick!” Zoe said, bouncing excitedly. Her eyes darted around the lounge. “Not her. Not her. Oh—her!”

Alexander followed her gaze, his glass pausing mid-air. His eyes landed on Mia Turner, and he nearly choked on his drink.

“A Turner?” he asked in disbelief.

Zoe nodded enthusiastically. “Yup. I heard she’s different from her sisters. Lucas even tried to get with her, and she turned him down. Can you imagine? She might actually give you a challenge.”

Alexander shook his head firmly. “I’m not getting anywhere near a Turner, Zoe.”

“But she’s pretty,” Zoe argued.

“She’s still a Turner.”

“Alex, please?”

“No Zoe I’m not putting my dick into a Turner “

Zoe pouted, turning her attention to her nails. “Fine. If you’re not going to play, fine. But I guess my birthday’s ruined.”

Alexander groaned. As twisted as their relationship was, he loved Zoe. They’d grown up together, transitioning from childhood friends to lovers. And while she drove him insane, he couldn’t imagine life without her.

“Fine,” he finally relented.

Zoe lit up, throwing her arms around his neck. “Yes! Thank you, baby! Okay, now your turn. Pick someone for me.”

Alexander leaned back, scanning the room. His eyes landed on Jeremy—a local businessman and soon-to-be groom. A wicked smirk curved his lips. “Him.”

Zoe frowned. “Jeremy? Isn’t he getting married next month?”

“Even better,” Alexander replied smoothly. “Like you said, the game is sweeter if it’s harder to achieve.”

Zoe grinned. “You’re twisted, Alex.”

“I’m a Blackwell babes ?”

# The Proposal

Mia was exhausted. Her legs ached from standing for hours, her head throbbed from the endless stream of demanding customers, and her soul felt drained from another day of pretending to be unbothered. 

Casa Lounge had been bustling tonight, and all she wanted now was to catch the next bus home, crawl into bed, and pray that her mother and siblings were out of the house. She couldn’t deal with them today—not with their drama, their judgment, and their constant reminder of the name she desperately wanted to escape.  

She stood at the bus stop, clutching her bag tightly, watching as headlights passed by, one after the other. The night air was cool, the breeze teasing strands of her hair.

Her thoughts were interrupted by the purr of an engine. Mia looked up, startled, as a sleek black sports car slowed to a stop in front of her. Its headlights bathed her in blinding light. She squinted, taking a step back, ready to bolt if necessary. Nothing good ever came out of expensive cars stopping for people like her.  

The door opened, and out stepped Alexander Blackwell.  

Mia’s breath caught in her throat.  

He wasn’t just handsome; he was devastatingly handsome. Towering with broad shoulders, a face carved like a Greek god, and an aura of confidence that demanded attention, Alexander Blackwell was every bit the enigma he is said to be. His presence was overwhelming, the kind of presence that knocked the air out of your lungs before you even realized it.  

He leaned casually against his car, his gaze fixed on her like he had all the time in the world.  

""Hey,"" he said, his voice smooth and laced with an edge of arrogance.  

Mia blinked, unsure if her brain was playing tricks on her. She glanced behind her, twice, certain there must be someone else he was addressing. Surely, ‘a Blackwell’ couldn’t be talking to her.  

""I’m talking to you, Turner,"" he said, smirking.  

Her mind went blank. All she could do was stammer. ""W-what? Me?""  

""Yup.""  

Mia clutched her bag tighter. She looked at him like he’d just announced the sky was green. ""Why… why are you talking to me?""  

His smirk deepened, and then, without warning, he said, ""Go on a date with me.""  

Mia froze. The words hit her like a thunderclap. Did she hear him right? She blinked rapidly, waiting for the punchline, but his face remained serious, even amused.  

""What?"" she choked out. ""Y-you have a girlfriend.""  

Alexander shrugged, pushing his hands into his pockets. ""Not anymore. We broke up. Check the news, Turner.""  

The casual way he said it made her feel like she’d stepped into some alternate reality. Her mind struggled to catch up.  

""I don’t understand,"" she said, her voice shaky.  

""How much?""  

Mia blinked again. ""What?""  

""I said, how much to go on dates with me?""  

It took her a second to process his words. Her jaw dropped as realization hit her. ""You… you want to pay me to go on dates with you?""  

""Maybe,"" he said, his tone nonchalant, as if he were discussing the weather.  

""Why?"" she demanded, her voice rising in confusion. “ You don’t even know my name!""  

""I know enough, Turner."" 

God! she hates when she's being address like this

Mia felt anger under her exhaustion. Her hands balled into fists at her sides. ""No,"" she said firmly.  

Alexander raised a brow. ""What?""  

""I said no.""  

He tilted his head, genuinely surprised. ""Why?""  

Mia stared at him, incredulous. ""What do you mean, why? You don’t even know me. You’ve never talked to me before. And now you suddenly want to—what?—buy me for dates? When I just saw you yesterday with your girlfriend""  

""Don’t tell me you were watching me, Turner,"" he said, his smirk returning.  

""You wish,"" she snapped.  

""Trust me, that can’t be part of my wishes,"" he said coolly. His eyes glinted with amusement. ""Name your price, Turner.""  

""I said no!"" she spat, her voice firm. ""You can’t just buy people to go on dates with you. I’m not interested.""  

Alexander’s smirk faltered for a split second. He stepped closer, his presence overwhelming, as he stared down at her. ""You’re a Turner,"" he said, his tone dropping. ""Stop acting like you have any pride""  

Her chest tightened, anger bubbling inside her. ""Please, leave me alone,"" she said through gritted teeth.  

He stepped back, his smirk returning like a mask. ""Three dates, Five thousand, for each.""  

Mia’s eyes widened. ""What?""  

""You heard me. Sleep over it, Turner.""  

And just like that, he turned, got into his car, and drove off, leaving her standing there, speechless, her thoughts swirling into chaos.  

“What the hell?”

# The Tempting Offer

Mia barely got any sleep that night. She tossed and turned, replaying the surreal encounter with Alexander Blackwell over and over in her mind. The way he’d looked at her, the arrogance in his tone, the absurdity of his offer—5,000 per date? It felt like a cruel joke, one meant to humiliate her.  

But then the thought of the money would creep back in, unbidden. 5 thousand dollars. For three dates, that will be 15 thousand dollars. It was more money than she could hope to save in years at Casa Lounge. 

15 thousand could pay for a lot, rent, food... It could be her fastest way out of Willowcrest. 

Mia sat up in bed and groaned, running her hands through her hair. No. She shouldn't even entertain the thoughts. 

Whatever game Alexander Blackwell was playing, she wanted no part of it. That money might save her now, but taking money from a Blackwell will definitely come with strings she wasn’t willing to pull. 

By morning, she was still exhausted but determined to stick to her decision. She trudged out of her tiny room and into the kitchen, hoping for some coffee to start her day. As she entered, she heard her sisters talking, their voices low. 

“There's no way it’s real,” Lily was saying, her tone dripping with skepticism.  

“It could be,” Anna shot back, flipping her hair over her shoulder. “People are saying it all over town.”  

“What’s going on?” Mia asked groggily, heading to the cupboard to grab a glass. “Where’s Mom?”  

“Out. Probably won’t be back until God knows when,” Anna replied, not even sparing her a glance.  

“You’re delusional if you think they’ve broken up,” Lily said, laughing. “Zoe would rather chew glass than break up with Blackwell.”  

Mia froze, her hand clutching the glass tightly.  

“Or maybe he broke up with her,” Anna said with a sly smile.  

Lily snorted. “Oh my God, Anna, don’t tell me you’re still holding onto the hope that you’ll get him one day. It’s embarrassing at this point.”  

Mia turned slowly, her stomach sinking as she listened to the exchange.  

“I’m not delusional!” Anna snapped. “And you’re one to talk. At least I tried. Unlike you, who’s too busy chasing any rich guy who gives you a second glance.”  

“‘Tried’ is an understatement,” Lily said, cackling. “Walking around naked in the Blackwell mansion three days after you were employed? Please. That was pathetic.”  

Anna’s face flushed, and she opened her mouth to retort, but Lily kept going.  

“Face it, Anna. We’re Turners. The Blackwells doesn’t even look at us like we’re human. They hate our family’s existence.”  

“Whatever,” Anna huffed, crossing her arms.  

Mia forced herself to move, walking to the sink to pour herself some water. Her hands were shaking, and she prayed neither of them would notice. 

HmmOnce inside, she grabbed her phone from the nightstand and immediately opened the Willowcrest Morning News. There, staring back at her in bold letters, was the headline:  

\*\*Alexander Blackwell and Zoe Harrington Call It Quits.\*\*  

Mia’s heart raced as she read the article. Zoe had confirmed the breakup in an interview the night before, saying they’d decided to take a “break” to focus on themselves. The tone of the article was suspicious, though, hinting at drama behind the scenes.  

Mia put the phone down and leaned against the wall, her mind spinning. Was this why he’d approached her? Because he was single now and needed someone to… what? Fill the void? Become part of his ridiculous games?  

She shook her head.

She couldn’t let herself get sucked into whatever madness was going on.  

Just then, her phone buzzed in her hand. The notification made her stomach drop. She hesitated for a moment before looking at the screen.  

The message was from an unknown number.  

Good morning, Turner. Don’t bother asking how I got your number. My offer still stands: three dates, 5,000 for each one. You have three days to decide.  

Mia stared at the message, her heart pounding in her chest. Her fingers trembled as she read it again. She could practically hear his voice in the text, that cool, arrogant tone that told her he was used to getting exactly what he wanted.  

For a moment, she considered deleting the message, pretending it never existed. But instead, she sank onto the edge of her bed, clutching her phone tightly.  

Fifteen thousand dollars.  

Her mind raced with possibilities. She could finally afford to leave Willowcrest, start fresh. 

But then the image of Alexander Blackwell’s smirk flashed in her mind, and anger bubbled to the surface.  

Three days

# The Blackwells

The Blackwell mansion loomed like a dark, silent predator as Alex walks up the marble steps and pushed through the heavy doors. 

The house was grand—but it felt nothing like a home. 

Dinner here wasn’t about family bonding; it was a calculated performance, one Alex hated but endured because his mother and brother were involved. The only two people who ground him to this dysfunctional circus. Well… them, and Zoe.  

He walked into the dining room, his steps echoing against the polished floors. His family was already seated, the tension visible before a single word was spoken.  

“What’s this nonsense I hear about you and Zoe?” his father, Charles Blackwell, demanded without so much as looking up. His tone was sharp and cold, like a blade slicing through the air.  

Alex didn’t falter, didn’t blink. He slid into his seat with a practiced ease, his face carefully neutral. “Good evening, Father,” he replied smoothly, ignoring the obvious jab.  

“Did you ice that cut, darling?” His mother, Esther, leaned forward, her soft features tight with concern. Her gaze flicked to the small wound on his temple from his most recent underground fight.  

Alex waved her off. “It’s fine, Mother.”  

“I can’t believe you let a rookie do that to you,” Charles sneered, his voice filled with disdain.  

“I won, Father,” Alex said, his voice edged with amusement. “That’s what matters, isn’t it?”  

Charles’s lips curled into a snarl. “You think this is a joke? I told you to postpone your fights for the week. Investors are flying in tomorrow, and you’re moving around, looking like some street thug. Do you realize the stakes? We could lose millions!”  

Alex leaned back in his chair, completely unfazed. “And yet I made sweet money last night from fighting. Your priorities are not mine, Father.”  

Charles’s gaze darkened. Without warning, he grabbed Julian’s wrist and slammed it onto the table.  

Alex stiffened.  

Julian, his older brother, winced, his lips trembling as he fought to suppress any sound of pain. Alex’s stomach twisted as he watched the familiar scene unfold.  

Charles Blackwell wasn’t a father. He was a tyrant, a monster! A manipulator who thrived on power and control, and when Alex pushed his limits, it was always Julian or his mother who bore the brunt of his wrath.  

“Do you think this is a game, Alexander?” Charles hissed, pressing harder on Julian’s hand.  

Julian’s eyes were shut tight, his breath uneven, but he didn’t cry out. He never did. 

Once, Julian had been Alex’s hero—the older brother who could do no wrong. Now he was a shadow of that man, a hollowed-out shell who survived on drugs.’  

Alex’s jaw clenched, rage boiling beneath the surface. His mother’s wide, pleading eyes locked on him, silently begging him to do something.  

Alex forced himself to keep his tone calm. “I’ll handle the investors,” he said, his words precise and deliberate. “It won’t affect the meeting. You’ll get the contract.”  

Charles finally let go of Julian’s hand, leaning back in his chair with a satisfied smirk. “Good. That’s what I like to hear.”  

Julian pulled his hand back quickly, cradling it under the table. His face was pale, but he didn’t say a word.  

Alex wanted to slam his fist through the table, but he didn’t. That’s what Charles wanted—to provoke him, to control him.  

Instead, Alex picked up his phone and scrolled aimlessly, pretending to care about the plate of food in front of him.  

“Fix whatever mess you’ve made with Zoe,” Charles added, his tone icy. “Her father and I are already discussing the wedding date. I won’t have your antics ruining our alliance.”  

Alex smirked, though it didn’t reach his eyes. “Of course, Father,” he said, not looking up. He couldn’t exactly tell Charles the truth” 

His mind drift to that server girl 

Turner—the fiery server girl who’d told him off at the bus stop. He hated to admit it, but her rejection had stung. Most people in Willowcrest would’ve jumped at his offer, yet she’d turned him down without a second thought.  

Something about her had gotten under his skin.  

“Did you hear me, Alexander?” Charles barked, snapping him out of his thoughts.  

Alex slipped his phone into his pocket and stood abruptly. “Loud and clear, Father. Enjoy your dinner, Blackwells.”  

Without another word, he strode out of the dining room.  

The cold night air hit him like a slap as he stepped outside. He leaned against his sleek car, running a hand through his hair. He needed to cool off.  

His phone buzzed in his pocket.  

Pulling it out, he glanced at the screen, his heart drops. It was a text message, and it was from Turner.  

‘I’ll do it.’

Alex stared at the message, his heart thudding in his chest. For a moment, he didn’t move, didn’t breathe.  

He loves challenges but getting entangled with a Turner is a challenge he had no interest in taking part in.

He wished she had said no.

# Let The Game Begin

The balcony of the Blackwell Grand Hotel overlooked a city alive with wealth, secrets, and power plays. Alex stood with a glass of wine in hand, the chilled night air brushing against his skin. Beside him, Zoe leaned in, her arms draped around his waist as if she were staking a claim.  

""How long do you plan on playing this game?"" He asked.

Zoe chuckled softly, her lips brushing against his ear. ""It's getting very interesting, Alexander. Don’t ruin the fun.""  

He hummed, neither agreeing nor disagreeing, his eyes fixed on the horizon. His thoughts drifted to the server girl.

""I can’t believe she agreed so quickly,"" Zoe said, breaking into his thoughts.  

""I told you, she's a Turner,"" Alex replied, his tone dismissive.  

Zoe tilted her head, her blonde hair cascading over her shoulder as she studied him. ""Seriously, babe, bribing her with money should be considered cheating. Where’s the challenge in that?""  

Alex turned his head slightly, giving her a sharp glance. ""No rules against it, Zoe. And what did you expect? That I’d sweet-talk her into a date? Casual conversation with her is painful enough. I offered what Turners are slaves to—the one thing they respond to."" His lips curled into a smirk. ""And like the perfect bait, she took it.""  

Zoe shivered, but not from the cold. Her smile widened, her eyes glittering with mischief. ""God, babe, your hatred for them gives me chills. I mean, I get it. You should hate them, but... it’s not like the whole family wronged you. Her brother was the only one who got involved with Julian.""  

Alex’s expression hardened, his sharp jawline tightening. His voice was cold and deliberate. ""And what is her brother, Zoe?""  

""A Turner,"" she whispered with a wicked smile, clearly pleased with his reaction. ""But babe, I have to admit—watching you squirm every time you talk about her makes this game so much more entertaining. Your pain and discomfort? Pure gold.""  

Alex didn’t respond. He drained the rest of his wine and turned his gaze back to the city, his thoughts darker than the night sky.  

—

Mia stood behind the bar at Casa Lounge, wiping down glasses and trying to ignore the twisting in her stomach. It had been two days since she’d last seen Alexander Blackwell, and she wasn’t sure if the relief or disappointment was stronger.

His message still lingered in her mind, taunting her.

Three dates. Five thousand per date.

It wasn’t normal. Nothing about it was normal. What kind of man paid that much money for a date? Who even pays for a date?

She paused mid-wipe, her reflection in the glass catching her attention. She didn’t need this kind of chaos in her life.

The door to Casa Lounge swung open. Mia turned her head and froze.

Alexander Blackwell

He wasn’t alone. His two friends, Lucas and Sam, flanked him, laughing at something she couldn’t hear. But Alex’s gaze was locked on her the moment he entered the bar.

Mia felt her heart lurch in her chest, and her hands gripped the counter to keep herself steady. She couldn’t move. She couldn’t look away. He was walking toward her, his dark, commanding presence drawing the eyes of everyone in the lounge.

Her throat went dry as he closed the distance between them.

“Tomorrow after work,” Alex said, his voice low and smooth. “I’ll pick you up.”

That was it. No explanation, no pleasantries. Just a statement delivered with absolute confidence.

Before Mia could find her voice, he turned and walked to the back corner of the lounge, where his friends were already settling into a booth.

Mia exhaled sharply, her grip on the counter tightening. Her knees felt like jelly, and she was sure her face was flushed.

“What was that about?” Emily, her coworker, whispered from behind her, nudging her with an elbow.

“Nothing,” Mia said quickly, her voice shaky.

Emily raised an eyebrow. “Nothing? That was Alexander Blackwell. He doesn’t just walk up to people, Mia.”

“Drop it,” Mia muttered, focusing on the glass in her hand. But her heart was pounding so hard it felt like it might leap out of her chest.

She glanced over at the booth where Alex sat with his friends. He didn’t look her way again, laughing at something his friend had said, but she couldn’t shake the feeling that he was completely aware of her every move.

Non odiatemi ma per problemi di salute non bevo caffè con caffeina, ma mi piace il gusto del caffè quindi ogni tanto mi piace farmi una bella tazza di … decaffeinato 😁
Essendo che non mi “serve” la caffeina, me lo faccio solo per il gusto pertanto deve essere buono (altrimenti che senso ha?). Mi trovo abbastanza bene con Illy decaffeinato ma con la polvere non sono tanto soddisfatto, ho voluto pertanto provare a prendere direttamente i chicchi e macinarlo manualmente: è niente, il caffè ha un sapore bruciato, amaro, poco gradevole, sa di cane bagnato misto copertone. Eppure quando provo lo stesso caffè con metodi diversi (capsula top), il gusto cambia parecchio.

Ecco cosa uso per il mio espresso “manuale”:
	•	Macchina espresso portatile USB (marca OutIN).
	•	Acqua scaldata manualmente a 92°C.
	•	Chicchi di Illy decaffeinato (tostatura media).
	•	Macinacaffè manuale, macino al momento. Ho provato molto fina e medio fina (spoiler: uguale)
	•	Riempio il filtro senza pressare troppo.

Per confronto:
	•	Ho provato lo stesso caffè ma in polvere (Illy decaf): il risultato è decisamente migliore.
	•	Ho provato le capsule Illy decaf nespresso: gusto ottimo, direi 8/10.

Con i chicchi invece il sapore è bruciato e sa di cane bagnato/copertone. Imbevibile, devo dolcificarlo. Ho smesso di berlo, se non per il cappuccino. Come è possibile che lo stesso caffè ma in grani macinato sul momento abbia un sapore peggiore dello stesso in polvere e dello stesso in capsule? Sbaglio io qualcosa?

Altrimenti dovrò passare al lato oscuro e andare solo di capsule.

I need some advice here. A baby/young pigeon flew into my coffee shop today.

A Tutor’s Candid Guide to Surviving (and Thriving) as an International Student in Deutschland","**Ah, Germany!**  
Land of precision, punctual trains (well, theoretically), and paperwork that could make a grown adult cry. You arrive, suitcase in hand, dreams in heart — and then reality greets you with a bureaucratic slap.

Let us begin, dear student, with the first few weeks of chaos:

Your Anmeldung appointment is scheduled for the year 2097.

Your health insurance is “active” but mysteriously not working.

Your blocked account is indeed blocked — emotionally and financially.

And jobs? Well, unless you speak fluent German or are a wizard, good luck.

But fear not! This guide shall illuminate the path through the fog of confusion.

🧹 What Jobs Can You Actually Do?

There are three noble categories of student employment:

Werkstudent Jobs These are part-time roles related to your studies — marketing, IT, finance, etc. They pay well, look great on your CV, and require… German. And experience. And possibly a small miracle.

Internships Mandatory or optional, paid or unpaid — internships are the golden ticket to networking and future employment. Also, free coffee.

On-Campus Jobs Research assistant, library helper, or social media overlord. These are flexible, often English-friendly, and conveniently located near your next lecture.

>

🏙️ Big City vs. Small Town: The Eternal Struggle

Big Cities (Berlin, Munich, Frankfurt): More jobs, more English, more rent, more competition. Also, more hipster coffee shops.

Small Towns: Fewer jobs, fewer people, fewer distractions. Lower rent. Higher chance of befriending the local bakery lady.

>

🕰️ Can You Balance Work and Study?

Yes. But only if you treat your calendar like a sacred text.

A Realistic Weekly Routine:

Mon–Thurs: Classes by day, cleaning job by evening (4 PM–7:30 PM).

Fri: Job applications, lecture reviews, and a well-earned döner kebab.

Sat–Sun: Restaurant shifts, laundry, existential dread, and maybe a nap.

>

🧠 What If You Don’t Speak German?

You’ll survive — but you’ll thrive faster if you start learning immediately.

Start with English-speaking roles in big cities or international firms.

Enroll in a language course — even A1 German opens doors (and bank accounts).

Practice with locals — or at least with the cashier at Lidl.

>

🎓 Work, Study, and Actually Live

Yes, it’s hard. But it’s also worth it.

You’ll gain:

Financial independence

Cultural wisdom

Professional experience

German skills

And stories that will make your future self laugh (or cry)

\- She was asking follow-up questions about my life (apparently that's a big green flag)

\- Her response times were getting faster over time

\- She was using way more emojis with me than I see her use in group chats

\- The AI even pointed out she was ""soft launching"" opportunities to hang out



The app gave her interest level as 97%  and said I should definitely ask her out.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions is crucial for prospective buyers. Understanding the nuances of live edge coffee tables helps make an informed decision.

**How do I Maintain a live Edge Coffee Table?**

Maintaining a live edge coffee table is relatively straightforward, but requires regular attention. Dust the table regularly with a soft cloth to prevent buildup. Avoid placing hot or wet items directly on the surface, as this can damage the finish. Clean spills promptly with a damp cloth and mild soap. For oil-finished tables, re-oiling every 6-12 months is recommended to maintain the wood's natural beauty and protect it from moisture. For polyurethane or epoxy-finished tables, occasional polishing can help restore the shine.

**Are Live Edge Coffee Tables Environmentally Friendly?**

The environmental impact of a live edge coffee table depends on the sourcing of the wood. Look for tables made from sustainably harvested wood, reclaimed wood, or wood from fallen trees. Sourcing wood locally reduces transportation costs and minimizes the carbon footprint.Some manufacturers also use eco-friendly finishes, such as water-based or plant-based options. Choosing a live edge coffee table made from lasting materials helps support responsible forestry practices and reduces environmental impact.

**What Should I Consider When Choosing a Base?**

The base of a live edge coffee table should be both sturdy and aesthetically pleasing. Consider the style of your living room and choose a base that complements your existing decor. Metal bases offer a modern, industrial look, while wooden bases provide a more natural, rustic feel. The height of the base should be appropriate for the tabletop,typically around 16-18 inches for a coffee table.Ensure that the base is strong enough to support the weight of the tabletop and that it is securely attached.

## Key Features Analysis

The Big Train Chai Tea Vanilla mix boasts several features that contribute to its appeal and functionality.

**Flavor Profile:** The blend combines the traditional spices of chai, such as cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, and ginger, with a creamy vanilla flavor. This combination aims to deliver a balanced and harmonious taste, appealing to a wide range of palates. The vanilla is intended to complement the spices without overpowering them.

The taste is designed to be rich and satisfying, providing a comforting and warming sensation. Big Train aims for a flavor profile that is both authentic to chai tea and accessible to those who may not be familiar with its more intense spice variations.

**Ease of Preparation:** The powdered format allows for quick and easy preparation. The mix is designed to dissolve readily in hot water or milk, requiring minimal effort and time. This makes it a convenient option for busy individuals or those looking for a hassle-free beverage.

The preparation process typically involves simply scooping the desired amount of powder into a mug, adding hot liquid, and stirring until fully dissolved. This simplicity makes it an accessible option for users of all skill levels, eliminating the need for specialized equipment or brewing techniques.

**Versatility:** The mix can be used to create a variety of beverages, including hot chai lattes, iced chai lattes, and even blended chai smoothies. This versatility allows users to customize their drinks according to their preferences and the season. It can also be added to baked goods or desserts for a unique flavor twist.

The ability to adapt the mix to different applications expands its appeal beyond a simple hot beverage. This opens up possibilities for creative experimentation and allows users to incorporate the chai vanilla flavor into other culinary creations.

**Ingredients:** The mix typically contains ingredients such as sugar, nonfat milk, dried milk, vegetable oil (coconut), corn syrup solids, black tea powder, honey powder, natural and artificial flavor, sodium caseinate, spice, silicon dioxide, mono- and diglycerides, sodium citrate, sodium silicoaluminate, and soy lecithin. The specific ingredients may vary slightly depending on the specific product formulation.

It is important for consumers to review the ingredient list to ensure it aligns with their dietary needs and preferences, particularly regarding sugar content, dairy components, and potential allergens.

**Packaging and Shelf Life:** The mix is typically packaged in resealable bags or canisters to maintain freshness and prevent moisture absorption. The packaging is designed to be durable and easy to store. The product generally has a long shelf life, allowing users to purchase in bulk without worrying about spoilage.

The shelf life is typically indicated on the packaging and can range from several months to over a year, depending on storage conditions. Proper storage, such as keeping the mix in a cool, dry place, is essential to preserve its quality and flavor.

## Core Benefits

The Big Train Chai Tea Vanilla mix offers several practical benefits for consumers.

**Convenience:** The primary benefit is the convenience of having a chai latte experience readily available at home or in the office. It eliminates the need to visit a coffee shop or spend time brewing traditional chai from scratch. This is particularly appealing for individuals with busy schedules or those seeking a quick and easy beverage option.

Having the mix on hand allows users to enjoy a comforting and flavorful chai latte whenever they desire, without the added cost or time commitment of purchasing it from a commercial establishment.

**Cost-Effectiveness:** Compared to purchasing chai lattes from coffee shops, the Big Train mix offers a more cost-effective alternative. A single bag or canister of the mix can yield numerous servings, resulting in significant savings over time. This makes it an attractive option for budget-conscious consumers who still want to enjoy the taste of chai.

The lower cost per serving allows users to indulge in their chai latte cravings more frequently without straining their budget. This is especially beneficial for those who regularly consume chai lattes.

**Customization:** The mix allows for customization of sweetness and strength. Users can adjust the amount of powder used to achieve their desired flavor intensity and sweetness level. This flexibility caters to individual preferences and dietary needs.

The ability to control the sweetness and strength allows users to create a chai latte that perfectly matches their taste preferences. This is particularly useful for those who prefer a less sweet or more intensely spiced beverage.

It was in good condition and reasonably priced. He expected it to sell the next day, electronics were always in high demand after all, but when he woke up and grabbed his phone to start his daily doomscrolling routine, he audibly ‘bruh’ed.

Twenty people had messaged him. All of them were asking the same stupid question: “Is this still available?”

Greg hated that response. So much so that he had specifically mentioned he’d leave anyone who sent that text on seen. If those fucking bots had the decency to read the description they’d know that, but nooooo, they chose to piss Greg the fuck off — before his morning cup of Joe mind you.

He grit his coffee stained teeth. Those fucking fuckers were gonna pay.

Greg, being the petty son of a fucking gun he was, replied to all twenty stupid fucking messages with Facebook’s stupid fucking recommended reply: “Yes, are you interested?”

It didn’t take long for them to reply. Like the bots they were, they all said: “Yes.” One lazy fucker just sent the blue thumbs emoji.

Greg, even more pissed off, sat up in bed, crisscrossed, pressing his back against the headboard, and locked the fuck in, which is to say he slanted his neck and slumped his shoulders into gamer posture.

He replied: “Cool.”

They soon replied with variations of: “Is the price negotiatable?”

Greg wanted to throw his phone at the wall and scream until his vocal cords snapped like guitar strings because he had, again, SPECIFICALLY fucking mentioned in the description of his fucking listing that the price was fucking firm, but he took a deep fucking breath in, and sent another fucking message to each of the dumb fuckers.

“No. Which you would know if you read the description.”

It took a bit longer for them to reply, Greg assumed they were taking the time to read the description so his anger faded, until he read what they said after.

“Oh, you’re too far.” Every single of them said this. Every single one of them DIDN’T CHECK HIS LOCATION BEFOREHAND.

Steam literally whistled out of Greg’s ears. His face reddened. His eyes turned to flame emojis. He grabbed his phone and snapped it in half on his knee like breaking a popsicle, but he didn’t stop there, oh no, he proceeded to shove both pieces of his phone in his mouth and chew. Glass fragments dug into his gums, blood oozed out from the corners of his mouth, his teeth turned red, he chewed and chewed, glass crunching and shattering into swallowable pieces, when he was all finished, he gulped with an ‘ahhh!’ and proceeded with his morning routine of making a cup of Joe.

1mbbats,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbbats/urgent_advise_needed/,Urgent Advise Needed,"Some background, I am 19 year old male born and raised in the UK. 

I've had horrible bouts of anxiety since I was 7 years old, the first that I can properly remember was from when I was in year 2 in primary school and my nice teacher who I was used to had to leave school for a while and she was replaced by this older, scarier teacher who was strict and intimidating. At first I was so scared of her that I started vomiting but after a few days I just starting telling my mum that I was sick because I was too afraid to go back to school, after a week she made me go back anyway and an hour after being at school I'd tell the teachers that I felt sick and wanted to be sent home. After two weeks I went to the doctors because my mum thought I was having some kind of health problem and they even took my blood but obviously nothing came of it. My teacher came back to school but my anxiety still persisted and it all came to a head when I ran out of the class fire exit because I saw my mum walking home through the window. I remember how stressed and miserable I made my mum even now because she got to the point where she didn't know what to do with me until I started bringing one of her old hats around with me in my bag like some kind of stress ball and somehow that worked (I was 7). 

Anyway I have had many bouts of anxiety throughout primary and secondary school but none of them were ever as bad as the first that I just detailed above and that leads me to the reason I am making this post. I never went on any anxiety medication nor have I ever spoken to any kind of therapist, when I was 15 years old in 2021 I was coming to the end of secondary school and I got really ill one day, I had some kind of stomach infection that had me bed bound for a week and during that week my anxiety returned strongly for the first time in years and I could barely handle it because not only was it health anxiety but it was also anxiety about my future and what I wanted to do with my life which was an anxiety that I had never experienced before. I stated having anxiety nightmares where I would wake up shaking and some days it would make me feel so sick that I would ask to leave school and leaving school made me feel worse because I'd tell myself that I was just using my anxiety as an excuse. Fortunately it settled down for a while until 2023 when the same kind of anxiety returned accept this time it persisted for so long that I started to question the quality of my life.

I'd be sitting in an ICT class meant for 30 students while only 4 others because sixth form is like that when out of the blue I'd just start feeling extremely hot and panicked to the point where I'd have to go and sit outside on the street for five minutes, that would happen to me at least once a week until one day when I was happening it was like something in my head broke and I realised that if I died I'd never worry again, never feel sick again, never feel like my life had no purpose and so on, that was the first time I ever truly thought about dying and up until that point I was afraid to die. I carried on despite that with a new found sense of freedom because I just didn't care anymore because whenever my anxiety came up I'd just tell myself that one day I'll be dead and whatever is worrying me won't matter at all. After spending months like that I got to a point where I'd just be walking home and suddenly I'd start tearing up out of nowhere. Eventually though in December 2023 I lost it and the school safe guarding lead who deals with kids behavioural problems didn't know how to help me because I was weeks away from being 18 so my parents to me to see a doctor and he said to speak to these two women at another health place who didn't help at all and they got me to start taking Cognitive Behavioural Therapy calls once a week and those didn't help me in the slightest so I went to a doctor again literally beside myself and he said he wouldn't give me anxiety medication because I wasn't 18 yet and they often made people worse anyway.

It is now mid 2025 and I've been working at a factory 5 nights a week for minimum wage and up until now I was just dealing with it and getting by but my anxiety has returned and I find myself thinking about my future again, I don't know what career I want to do and I know that my parents won't let me live here forever working 30 hours a week. Somewhere in the last ten years I've devolved another kind of anxiety that makes me terrified to try new things for some reason, last night I bought a can of alcohol I thought would be nice and it took me two hours of looking at it to actually try it because I kept thinking 'what if I don't like it'. When I got this stupid job I was very anxious to the point where I was pacing for an hour downstairs the night before my first shift,  hit my shin on the coffee table that many times that there was a bruise for two weeks. For the last five months I got into that state where the anxiety stopped bothering me because I kept telling myself that I'll be dead eventually and that it doesn't matter but a couple months ago my grandad died and I kept on working and my job is very boring (lots of time for reflection) and now I'm back in a state where the idea of being dead one day isn't a comfort anymore because it doesn't change the fact that I am alive right now. I just don't want my anxiety to rule my life anymore, sick of this cycle where I'm either worried or maddeningly depressed. Still haven't tried medication and I did speak to a therapist one time for a couple hours but since then I just haven't told anybody but my diary and the internet how I feel. To anybody who escaped this cycle, how tf did you do it?

# Know Your Weaknesses

As a non-native speaker, **lengthy questions are my kryptonite**. They require me to mentally translate, and I often get lost, forcing me to re-read multiple times. That's why I wasn't aiming for a 100-question pass; **my target was 150**. Time management was absolutely crucial. I allotted myself a little over one minute per question. If I couldn't find the answer within that time, I'd pick the most plausible option and move on.



# Study Materials

I started with the **(ISC)² OSG 9th Edition**, reading up to page 200+. Many suggested the ""DestCert"" book was better and easier to understand, so I switched to that and read it cover-to-cover. While the DestCert book was decent for highlighting key points, it didn't go into the depth of the OSG, as others had mentioned. So, I went back and finished the entire OSG. I also purchased **QE** to practice and assess my knowledge. I found the practice tests incredibly helpful for refining my mindset and focusing on what the question was truly asking, as well as for practicing my time management.



# Exam Day Experience

I arrived at the test center early today and was allowed to start my exam 30 minutes ahead of schedule. A few sips of coffee helped me stay awake and focused. The exam began with about 20 easy questions, but then it started to get harder. To make matters worse, the test center was undergoing construction, and the constant drilling noise was incredibly distracting. It was tough trying to read lengthy questions while being interrupted by the racket! Fortunately, I was given earplugs, which I had to press in tightly throughout the entire exam to maintain my focus.

By the 50th question, I realized I was falling behind my time target and had to pick up the pace. When I reached the 100th question, I honestly thought I'd fail there, but the exam continued! I took a few deep breaths and kept going. The exam finally ended at 150 questions with just two minutes to spare. Relief washed over me! After a quick two-minute survey, I walked out of the room, fully expecting to have failed. But then, the lady at the counter took my result and said, ""Congratulations!"" I was shocked and couldn't believe I had actually passed!  


Special thanks to **DarkHelmet** and **Tresharley** for constantly reminding me to **""JUST ANSWER WHAT THE QUESTION ASKS!""** On a side note, the ""manager mindset"" approach didn't work for me on this exam.

**TLDR;** Know your weaknesses and plan your strategy. The **(ISC)² OSG** and QE are sufficient. Focus on answering exactly what the question asks, and be aware that the ""manager mindset"" might not apply to every exam.",5,1753693583.0,cissp,1,1.0,False

My question is would I be putting my career in jeopardy if I quit my first public service role without another offer?

I had another job offer for federal department (but the commute without a car would have been two hours one way approximately) otherwise, I am mostly in merit pools. I got my citizenship end of last year. 

I am about two months in my current role and after I got my contract extended they put additional work on me. I received some training but I get limited help and some anger if I ask questions. My manager did intervene but since he doesn’t the role too well, every little mistake gets me reprimanded since he thinks I made a major mistake. Even if there was a misunderstanding and I didn’t make the mistake or if for e.g I had reason to believe something wasn’t completed and emailed something someone else already sent. I am constantly feeling pressure and feeling inadequate.  I can’t ask for help since very few people listen meanwhile I am still getting trained on more work.

Socially I am lonely at work so maybe I am overestimating the negatives. I think maybe my work isn’t technical which could be why the higher AOs wouldn’t prefer talking to me. If I approach a group to chat at lunch most of the group wouldn’t prefer chatting with me. They reply politely enough but there are no follow ups and it is the same two people who really engage in a chat with me. So I mostly have lunch alone and I am excluded from coffee trips. I mention this part since being neurodiverse I feel maybe I am being too sensitive to rejection.

In Belfast and other major areas along the coast it can work out near 7 quid if not more for a plain croissont or traybake with a coffee. Ive seen places charge 3.50 for a small caramel slice and some charging 3.50-3.70 for a coffee. Some places can be a bit cheaper but i think the bare minimum youd pay for the cheapest coffee and cheapest traybake is around 6 quid. Realistically if youre in Belfast or any other major place youre talking 7-8 quid for a coffee and a bun.  It works out just the same now to go to an actual bakery for a better fresher pastry for the same price.

## Key Features Analysis

The blanket coat is more than just a stylish statement; several key features contribute to its functionality and comfort.

**Material and Construction:** Understanding the composition of the fabric is crucial. Many blanket coats are made from a blend of wool, acrylic, and polyester. Higher wool content generally signifies greater warmth and durability. The weave also matters; a tightly woven fabric will provide better wind resistance,while a looser weave might offer a softer,more relaxed feel. The quality of the stitching and seams is another essential indicator of the coat's overall construction and longevity.

Blanket coats often incorporate recycled materials, adding an eco-conscious appeal in line with contemporary trends. Some feature water-repellent finishes too, enhancing their practicality in various weather conditions.

**Design and Style:** Blanket coats come in a wide array of designs, from simple, minimalistic wraps to more elaborate pieces with fringe, embroidery, or patterned details. The shape can vary greatly, too, some resembling oversized cardigans, others styled as classic overcoats. Lapel styles vary; some feature wide shawl collars for added warmth, while others offer more streamlined, collarless options. Belted styles provide a more defined silhouette, allowing you to cinch the waist and create a more tailored look.

assess whether a pattern will flatter your silhouette as heavier, blocky patterns can add more visual weight to the body. Consider too how different patterns will affect the coat's versatility when pairing items from your existing wardrobe.

**Size and Fit:** Finding the right size is essential for a comfortable and flattering fit. Blanket coats are often designed to be oversized, but it’s crucial to ensure the shoulders fit properly and the length complements your height.Check the manufacturer's size charts carefully, and consider whether you prefer a more relaxed or fitted look. Some brands offer petite or tall sizes to accommodate different body proportions.

Consider whether the fit will accommodate multiple layers underneath. Do you anticipate wearing the blanket coat over sweaters and thicker clothing?

**Warmth and Insulation:** The primary function of a blanket coat is to provide warmth. The level of insulation will depend on the material and thickness of the fabric. Wool blends generally offer good insulation, while lighter cotton or acrylic options may be more suitable for milder weather. Some blanket coats feature a lining for added warmth and comfort.The presence of a lining also affects how the coat drapes,preventing excessive stretching.

Consider how the garment breathes. Materials like wool manage moisture differently compared to sythetics like polyester, which can trap sweat.

**Care and Maintenance:** Before buying, its wise to check the care instructions to ensure the coat is easy to maintain. Some blanket coats may require dry cleaning, while others can be machine washed. Check the specific instructions on the label. Consider also that darker patterned coats will be better at hiding stains compared to lighter, solid-coloured options.

Consider how different fabrics are affected by water, high temperatures, and abrasion during washing. For example, high heat will frequently enough ruin wool's elasticity and softness by felting the fibres together.

Key features of the best blanket coats include:

* High-quality wool blends
* Versatile designs
* Comfortable oversized fits
* Excellent insulation
* Easy maintenance

## Core Benefits

Blanket coats offer several key benefits that make them a popular choice for outerwear.

**Remarkable Comfort:** The primary benefit of a blanket coat is its unparalleled comfort. Made from soft, cozy materials, it feels like wearing a warm blanket. this makes it ideal for chilly days when you want to feel snug and comfortable without sacrificing style. The relaxed fit and soft texture create a comforting and enjoyable wearing experience.Consider whether the texture will sit comfortably against your skin. Some people may experience irritation by coarser wool and other fibres.

**Stylish Versatility:** Blanket coats are incredibly versatile and can be styled in numerous ways. They can be dressed up with tailored pants and boots for a chic, refined look or dressed down with jeans and sneakers for a casual, everyday outfit. The wide range of designs and patterns allows you to find a blanket coat that perfectly matches your personal style and wardrobe.Experimenting with different tying methods if the blanket coat has a drawstring offers a range of stylistic options. For example, looping the drawstring around the body and fastening it at the back can create a more fitted silhouette.

**Enhanced Warmth:** Blanket coats provide excellent insulation, keeping you warm and cozy in cold weather. The thick,layered construction traps heat and protects you from the wind. This makes them a practical choice for autumn and winter,offering a stylish alternative to traditional heavy coats.

Consider how the length of the coat affects thermal performance. While longer coats will envelop your entire body,they will be bulky if they lack breathability.

**Effortless Chic:** The blanket coat exudes an effortless chic aesthetic. Its relaxed, bohemian vibe adds a touch of sophistication to any outfit. Whether you’re running errands, meeting friends for coffee, or traveling, a blanket coat instantly elevates your style. It’s a statement piece that’s both fashionable and practical.

Consider pairing the blanket coat with more form-fitting underlayers for a sharper contrast. This will draw more attention to the blanket coat's silhouette.

Always check the care label for specific instructions. To prolong the life of your coat, avoid over-washing and store it properly when not in use.

So I just saw this tweet from Sandman (that Japanese guy who does the One Piece translations with all the cultural context) talking about what Torishima said - you know, the Dragon Ball editor. Basically he said DS manga is whatever, it's all about the godly animation that made it famous. Raw beans vs roasted coffee type deal.

And look, I get it. This is what a lot of redditors think too, especially the One Piece crowd (and we all know they've been salty ever since post-timeskip went to shit).

But here's the thing - if you actually look at the data instead of just parroting what everyone else is saying, this take falls apart pretty fast.

## The Receipts

If anime was really carrying everything, then explain these manga numbers:

**82 million copies sold in 2020 alone.** That's not a typo. For context, One Piece - the literal king of manga - sold 7.7 million that same year, and that was actually the best year for them. DS outsold them by over 10x. With manga sales. Not anime viewership.

**Every single volume averages 5 million copies.** Again, this is crushing One Piece numbers, and OP has been the industry standard forever.

**Did this with only 23 volumes.** Shortest series ever to hit 220 million total copies. Most series need like 100+ volumes to even dream of these numbers.

**At one point, all 22 volumes held every single spot on the weekly manga charts.** Every. Single. Spot. When has that ever happened?

https://www.epicdope.com/demon-slayer-manga-breaks-yet-another-record-for-sales/?utm_source=chatgpt.com

**Volume 23 sold 2.86 million copies in week one.** All-time record.

## What This Actually Means

Yeah, the animation is insane. Ufotable went absolutely nuclear on the production and it looks incredible. But here's what people miss - if the manga was really just ""raw beans"" like Torishima said, people would've watched the anime and moved on.

Instead, they kept buying the manga. And buying it. And buying it.

You don't accidentally sell 82 million copies of something in one year because of an anime. People had to actively go out, find the manga, and decide it was worth their money. Multiple times. For 23 different volumes.

The anime gave it exposure, sure. But the manga had to have something worth reading for people to keep coming back like this.

## Bottom Line

I haven't read or watched a single episode of DS, so I have zero skin in this game. But the numbers are the numbers. You can't fake manga sales data, and these records are absolutely bonkers.

The animation definitely helped blow it up. But dismissing the manga as just ""raw beans"" when it's literally rewriting industry records? That's just cope from people who can't handle that something new came along and dominated their favorites.",0,1753692523.0,animequestions,0,0.5,False

I’ve poured my longing into every line, begging you to see me, to make me your dawn, not a thought you brush aside at daybreak.

These letters carry my regrets, apologies for when I left you, when life’s storms were too wild to share. I thought my pain too heavy, so I pulled away, and I’m sorry. I’m sorry for the flood of messages I sent, impatient, then erased in fear, stealing my voice before you could hear it. Each word was a confession, a hope that you’d see my heart, open and raw, waiting for yours.  

They hold my celibacy, a vow I keep for you, my body stirred only by dreams where you’re real, your touch a flood that wakes me trembling, alive with you.

They ask why my love isn’t enough, why the silence cuts like a knife, why you don’t cross these miles to choose me.

Paul and I had spent over a decade building a life together—growing our business, mapping out our future, and counting down to the wedding we'd always dreamed of. Then, with one accidental click, it all shattered.

I found a shared document in his Cloud Drive—one I was never supposed to see. Inside were secret meet-up plans, steamy love notes, and hotel receipts. The gut punch? He was cheating with Claire Winslow, my most trusted employee. In that moment, something inside me snapped.

Our perfect life? A sham. Our business? Soon to be mine alone. And the wedding? Oh, it wasn't getting canceled. It was going to be the beginning of their nightmare.

I wasn't some weepy fiancée who'd slink away quietly. No, I'd take everything from them—piece by piece, until there was nothing left. They thought they could betray me and walk off unscathed. They had no idea who they were dealing with.

Wedding planning had me swamped—juggling work while prepping for what was supposed to be the happiest day of my life. One night, as I finalized our guest list, I shared it with Paul via Cloud Drive. He was away at a conference, so this was how we stayed organized. Everything seemed flawless… until I noticed something odd.

A few days earlier, he'd logged into his email on my laptop, so when I opened the drive that night, it defaulted to his account. Scrolling through folders, one document stood out: \[Business Projections Q3\]. Dry title, standard stuff—except I hadn't created it, and it wasn't tied to any active project.

Curiosity got the best of me.

I clicked, expecting spreadsheets. Instead, the first line hit like a sucker punch: \[Can't stop thinking about that night at the hotel… next time I'll wear red.\] My stomach lurched. This wasn't a work file. It was shared exclusively between Paul and an unfamiliar email: \[email protected\].

Hands shaking, I checked the edit history. The full story unfolded—coded talk of post-meeting hookups, fake ""work dinners,"" even plans to keep their affair going after our wedding like it was just a minor inconvenience.

I sat there, numb. They'd used our business as cover, plotting romantic escapes while I'd poured my soul into building our future. The document wasn't even hidden. He'd gotten so bold, so sloppy, he didn't bother deleting the evidence. Now it glared at me from his shared folder, a cruel cosmic joke.

""Hey, Ruby—sorry, I can't make the tasting today. Can your mom go with you?"" Paul's voice was all fake regret when I called to remind him. Same excuse, different day. I forced a breezy tone. ""No problem. Just don't overdo it at work, okay?""

The second I hung up, my fists clenched. His reckoning was coming. And I'd make sure it hurt.

After days of ugly crying and rage-spiraling, I pulled myself together. Step one of my ten-part revenge plan? Gather proof.

Thanks to our shared WeCloud account—meant for syncing calendars and photos—I dug through his phone, emails, and bank records without tipping him off. Scrolling my photo gallery, I spotted new uploads from his device. Mostly boring work shots… until I landed on a lingerie selfie of Claire in a hotel mirror.

My chest caved. Swiping frantically, the next photo sealed it: Paul, shirtless in the same room, smirking at the camera.

Then, while working from home (as he ""stayed late at a meeting""), I opened our Streamify app and spotted a private playlist called \[Late Nights\]. Not our music. Not public. Clicking it revealed a soundtrack to their affair—songs like ""Secret Love Song"" and ""Dirty Little Secret,"" peppered with Claire's notes: \[For our weekend getaway\], \[That night.\]

It took weeks, sneaking around wedding prep and work, but soon I had it all—messages, receipts, photos. Filed away, ready for the perfect moment. I'd strike when it destroyed them most.

Chapter 2

The second step was cutting him off from our social circle—but I had to be smart about it. Too fast, and he'd notice. Too obvious, and I'd look suspicious. So I started small, planting seeds in casual conversations.

Over brunch with friends, I'd sigh and say, ""He's been so busy lately—always out of town for work. I get it, but with the wedding coming up… I just wish he were around more.""

The perfect balance of understanding and subtle concern. Just enough to make them sympathetic—but also suspicious. I'd brush it off with a smile, like it was no big deal, but I could see the doubt flicker in their eyes.

Over time, I painted him as distracted, distant—unreliable. When his friends (who conveniently worked with me) asked about wedding plans, I'd say, ""Oh, I've been handling most of it. He's swamped with work, flying out every other week. But it's fine—he's stressed.""

The more I played the patient fiancée, the more people questioned him. They'd whisper behind his back—Why isn't he helping? Doesn't he care? Friends texted to ""check in,"" some outright saying, ""It's weird he's not more involved, don't you think?""

I'd laugh it off, playing supportive, but the damage was done. His friends stopped inviting him out—""Didn't want to bother him."" Others made excuses when he reached out. ""Too busy.""

I never accused him outright—that would've been too obvious. Instead, I let them believe he was the problem. And slowly, they all drifted to my side.

By the time he noticed, he was already isolated.

While he was distracted with her, I moved to step three: taking control of our assets.

This wasn't something I could rush—he was too involved in the business. So I worked quietly, under the radar.

I started small. During meetings with our accountant, I'd ""double-check"" paperwork he'd already signed. He'd wave me off—""You handle it."" Perfect.

Soon, I was the one managing everything—contracts, investments, property. I slipped in clauses, transferred assets to my name, rewrote documents. All while he was too preoccupied to notice.

I even hired my own lawyer—someone he didn't know—specializing in hostile takeovers. We built an airtight case. If he ever fought back, I'd win.

By the time he glanced at a bank statement or questioned a decision, I had an answer ready. ""It's all under control."" And he'd relax, trusting me.

He had no idea I was stealing everything from him.

Soon, the business he thought we shared would be mine—every asset, every dollar, every property.

And he'd have nothing.

Chapter 3

Claire Winslow wasn't just his secret lover—she was one of our longest-standing employees, practically there since day one. She held a key role in the company, which made things complicated, but also gave me the perfect opportunity to ruin them both. If I played my cards right, I wouldn't just expose their affair—I'd destroy their careers in the process.

I knew I couldn't just blow the whistle without consequences, so instead, I took my time dismantling her position, piece by piece. This was step four.

First, I needed to plant the seeds of doubt. Whenever Claire and I discussed potential business leads, I'd ""accidentally"" slip her bad intel.

""Hey, Claire,"" I'd say casually over coffee, ""I heard from a contact there's a big investor eyeing our market. Might be worth looking into.""

Of course, the deals always fell through. The investors I sent her to were either uninterested or notoriously difficult to work with.

Before long, Claire started fumbling in meetings, looking more and more incompetent in front of the board. Rumors about her failures spread fast, and she had no idea I was the one pulling the strings.

Nobody called her out directly, but the writing was on the wall—she was being phased out. Fewer meetings, fewer requests for her input. It was only a matter of time.

But I didn't stop there. While she was busy chasing dead-end leads, I worked behind the scenes to rally the team around me. I positioned myself as the indispensable leader—the one who got things done.

Every time Claire messed up, I was there to clean up the mess, making sure the team saw me as the steady hand they could trust.

In meetings, I'd drop subtle hints about her poor judgment. ""I know Claire thought this deal was promising, but it seems like things didn't pan out… again. Maybe we should rethink our approach.""

I never outright blamed her—just enough to make everyone question if she was cut out for leadership.

Behind closed doors, I worked key team members, taking them out for drinks, planting doubts. ""Look, I know Claire means well, but she's been making some risky calls lately. We can't afford to keep losing investors.""

Slowly, they started seeing me as the real leader. Every mistake she made pushed them further into my corner.

By the time board meetings rolled around, I was the problem solver while Claire struggled to explain why her deals kept collapsing. Her confidence crumbled—she grew defensive, desperate, which only made her mistakes more obvious.

Begged God. Pleaded.  
Day and night. Hands trembling, heart raw.

It was for my dad.  
Stage four. Doctors gave him weeks.  
But I had faith. Real faith.  
I believed God would heal him.

But he died.

Just like that.

And in the silence that followed, my prayers stopped too.

What was the point?  
Why cry out if Heaven goes quiet?

I felt abandoned.  
Every verse about God’s goodness felt hollow.  
Church songs made me want to scream.

But grief has a strange way of stripping everything down.

And somewhere in the numbness, I whispered one last broken sentence:

*“God… if You’re still there, show me.”*

I didn’t see lightning.  
No miracles. No voice from Heaven.

But the next morning, a friend dropped off coffee and sat with me in silence.

A week later, I found my dad’s old Bible.  
He had underlined this:

>

And I wept.

Because maybe the miracle wasn’t in the healing.  
Maybe it was in the *presence*.

In the God who sits with us in our sorrow.  
Who doesn’t always fix it, but never leaves us in it.

**Have you ever prayed for something and didn’t get it?**  
You’re not alone.  
And it doesn’t mean your faith failed.

It might just mean God is showing up in a different way.

1mbatp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/phtravel/comments/1mbatp6/puerto_princesa_trip_postmortem/,Puerto Princesa Trip Post-Mortem,"I concluded my 4 days and 4 nights trip to Puerto Princesa City in Palawan. I was able to give this a try, thanks to my CebPac SuperPass. I am sharing my experiences in going to this city:

**Flight:** Our flight was scheduled during last week during the habagat, Dante, and Emong. I was really anxious because I thought it would be cancelled since CebPac was cancelling a lot of flights. The morning of the day of our flight, I received an email from CebPac that our flight was rescheduled early morning the following day. For me, it's fine. Wag lang cancelled since there was a tiny hope of pushing forward. And we had enough time to drop our things to our hotel before we were fetched by our tour service. We're able to fly on time and reached PPS ahead of our arrival time. Amazingly, the weather in PPS was so nice; not a glimpse of gloomy weather, unlike sa Manila.

**Hotel:** Our hotel was located 2 kilometers from the airport but it felt so rural. It's just 10 minutes tricycle ride from the airport. Worth it for its price since I really booked the cheapest one, but it's very good though for our comfort. I booked this via Agoda. 

**Tour:** Since I tagged my parents along, I booked a tour service I found on Facebook, after careful and thorough screening and price comparison. Originally, our Day 1 should be the Underground River Tour but got cancelled due to high levels of water in the cave and suspension of government work that day. We're diverted to the Honda Bay Tour where we went to Pambato Reef, Luli Island, and Cowrie Island. Luli Island is so pretty, we took our lunch while our legs were dipped in the water. You can snorkle in Pambato Reef to see the fish and coral reefs in the water. Cowrie Island is also nice, some stalls to choose from, including food, drinks, and massage. And the water is very clear to take an enjoyable swim. Our picnic lunch was provided by our tour, very generous set of food.

Day 2 again was supposedly Underground River but due to the same reasons above, it was replaced by a half-day city tour. We opted for the afternoon schedule to give us more time to rest, especially my parents. We went to Mitra's Ranch, Baker's Hill, Butterfly Garden and Tribal Village. We cut our trip short since my mom was nauseous already; she's not a fan of van trips, hahaha. You can have an amazing view of Honda Bay from the top of Mitra's Ranch. You can buy the famous hopia from Baker's Hill and grab some coffee or pizza here. But what I enjoyed the most was the Butterfly Garden and Tribal Village. We saw the native Palawan peacock pheasant featured in the 100-peso bill, a bearded pig, and some insects, among others. But the highlight was a showcase of the culture of the Palaw'an Tribe. I learned so much from it. We requested to be dropped off at SM Puerto Princesa to grab our dinner, and there are lot of options to choose from. We grabbed a tricycle back to our hotel.

Day 3 was a missed opportunity for Underground River since it's not available and the other alternative tour suggested to us was not amenable to our parents. So I improvised an itinerary for us during this day. We rented a tricycle to bring us to Palawan Special Batallion War Museum. I super duper love this place; you'll learn a lot during the Japanese occupation of Palawan. We also went to the Immaculate Conception Cathedral (pretty church!) and the Plaza Cuartel beside it. Unfortunately, Plaza Cuartel is temporarily closed for renovation since a WWII tunnel was discovered here. Afterwards, we went to the Crocodile Farm which was 30 minutes from the city proper. But here, we saw a lot of crocodiles from small to large. There are other animals as well, like the bearcat, porcupine, eagle, and other reptiles. We went back to the city and dropped off at SM again to grab our lunch, watch a film in the cinema, and rest. As a final destination, we took a tricycle to the Baywalk where you will have an amazing view of PPS Bay/Honday Bay. There are also a lot of food stalls. This was where we grabbed our dinner before going back to our hotel.

**Transportation:** I realized that it's difficult to commute and to do a DIY trip of Puerto Princesa City since jeepneys are rare and car-hailing apps are inexistent. You will mostly rely on tricycles which imposed an abnormal price. The cheapest the we've got was 15 pesos per head for 1.5-km trip to Baywalk. But mostly, we were paying 200 to 250 pesos per tricycle trip if it's outside our tour. It's really pricey and cut a lot from our budget.

**Overall:** I can say that 3 days is enough to cover everything in PPS; there's not much to do if the beach trip is out of the scene. That's why it's advisable to do another trip to Balabac, El Nido, or San Vicente if you have the time to do so. For us, maybe I''ll return next time to visit El Nido, Coron, or San Vicente, whichever is amenable to be combined together to make the most out of time in Palawan. I love the slow pace of life in Palawan, especially in PPS. Even though it's a city, the place exudes provincial life.

***Drop your thoughts below on where we should go next in Palawan. What are the best combo trips that we should go for next? Is there a ferry going between Coron and El Nido? Can I put El Nido and San Vicente together?***",1,1753691872.0,phtravel,1,1.0,False

Small talk used to be something I could avoid. Now? It’s at the coffee machine. The elevator. 

Here are skills that helped from [Better Small Talk](https://www.befreed.ai/book/better-small-talk-by-patrick-king)

**1. Preparation is the key**One small trick I learned: prep 2–3 casual topics in advance. It could be something I watched, weekend plans, a local event. When my brain goes blank, I have something to fall back on.

2. **The 1:1:1 Method** This one saved me during awkward moments: • Say hi to **1 person** • Ask **1 question** (e.g., “Any fun weekend plans?”) • Share **1 thing** (e.g., “I’m trying to survive Monday without caffeine”) Do it once a day. Low-stakes, high payoff.

**3. Following up matters** 

 If starting a conversation feels hard, try this: don’t start one. Just listen carefully. Pick up something the other person mentioned, and follow up later. That won’t let the conversation die awkwardly either.

**4. Behavior first, comfort second** Waiting until I “feel ready” never worked. And honestly, the silence in those moments? Painful. So I started with just a “Good morning.” That’s it. I stopped overthinking what to say and began treating small talk like a simple greeting, not a performance. Turns out, acting confident is often the first step to actually becoming confident.

If small talk makes your skin crawl, you just need a few tools. I also read [Fine Art of Small Talk](https://www.befreed.ai/book/the-fine-art-of-small-talk-by-debra-fine), which gets a deeper understanding of small talk. I highly recommend it if you're trying to rebuild your social muscles post-WFH.

I woke up to a second life—this time determined to avoid every single run-in with Ethan.

When he said he wasn't going home for break, I packed my bags and left for the village alone.

He helped Linda rent the house next door, so I moved out.

He chose to stay at the school for work, so I applied to Northwest Industrial University instead.

In my past life, even our own children had begged me to divorce him when we were old—just so that after death, he and Linda, that ill-fated pair, could be buried together.

Staring at my acceptance letter, I nearly broke down.

No one knew I'd been given a second chance.

At the last possible moment, I switched my college application to Northwest Industrial.

Even my teacher was stunned. ""Didn't you say your fiancé was staying here? Going so far away—do you really think he'll wait for you?""

At the mention of Ethan, his younger self flashed in my mind—tall, handsome, the golden boy everyone admired.

Truth was, people always thought I'd lucked out. He was ambitious, striking, now a military officer—while I was just the girl who'd stumbled into his life through an outdated betrothal.

I smiled and answered loud enough for the whole room to hear: ""Teacher, we live in the age of free love now.""

""That engagement? A relic of feudal society. Unacceptable!""

She blinked, then grinned and patted my shoulder, eyes shining with approval.

School was over. I stepped outside, melting into the crowd, finally free.

Chapter 2

In my past life, I never made it to college.

Ethan and I were set to marry in just a few days, and soon after, I became a mother—so my education ended there. Ethan stayed in school a little longer before enlisting in the army.

Then, the distance between us grew.

He climbed the ranks, and wherever he was stationed, Linda and her daughter followed.

Meanwhile, I was trapped in a small world—serving his parents, raising our children, watching them grow from clingy toddlers into adults who slowly drifted toward Ethan's new life.

By the time I found out about his wedding to Linda's daughter, it was already over. An old friend's photo showed them glowing, serving tea to their parents, looking every bit the happy family.

Later, my own son begged me to divorce.

""Mom,"" he said, ""Dad's suffered his whole life. If it weren't for you, he would've been with my mother-in-law years ago.""

""Mom, you two were never right for each other. Why can't you just let go?""

Even my daughter-in-law couldn't stand the sight of me.

But how could I give up?

I couldn't accept that I'd spent years nursing his parents when they were bedridden, while he was off with someone else.

I couldn't accept that when our son spiked a fever in the middle of the night, I ran barefoot for miles to get help—while he was playing house, tutoring another woman's child.

And I especially couldn't accept that after sacrificing everything for this family…

He said it.

They said it.

Everyone said it.

That we were never meant to be.

That I was the one who refused to move on.

But I held on.

Years of hardship carved themselves into my face, leaving me worn and weary.

Even in death, I swore I'd drag them down with me.

As for whether they'd end up together after I was gone—I didn't care anymore.

I was too tired to care.

In the end, I died the day my son came to plead for the divorce one last time.

He ranted, he begged, and when I stayed silent, he stormed out in anger.

He never heard me call after him.

He never saw me collapse the moment the door slammed.

And in that final second, I regretted everything.

Why had I clung to him?

Why had I wasted my entire life on him?

But then—

I woke up.

Back before I married Ethan.

Back when everything could still be different.

Chapter 3

Back home, I tucked my acceptance letter away and got to work in the kitchen.

The two-bedroom apartment was courtesy of Ethan's unit—a small perk that barely made up for everything else. As I chopped vegetables, my eyes drifted to the calendar hanging in the living room. There it was: the date for college orientation next month. I grabbed a red marker and circled it, my heart pounding.

I stared at that bold red circle, a flicker of hope burning inside me.

Soon.

Soon, I'd be free.

Ethan walked in just as dinner hit the table.

Of course, Linda and her daughter trailed right behind him. ""Sis, sorry to drop by again,"" Linda said with that practiced smile of hers.

She had that porcelain complexion, an oval face, and that bright red coat of hers—always dressed to impress.

Her daughter, already treating the place like her second home, squealed at the sight of food and immediately helped herself—one bowl for her, one for Ethan, one for Linda.

None for me.

By the time I stepped out of the kitchen, the three of them were already cozied up at the table, laughing like some picture-perfect family.

Then—spit.

All three of them choked at the exact same second.

""Mommy, it's like eating a salt lick!"" the kid whined.

I just leaned against the kitchen doorway, arms crossed, watching Ethan scramble to pour them soup—as if that would help.

Spoiler: It didn't. The soup was worse.

Linda left in tears, of course. Right before storming out, she sniffled at Ethan, ""Your wife clearly hates me. I won't impose again.""

Ethan walked her out like some dutiful knight, then came back scowling.

I didn't bother waiting for the lecture. Just turned back to the stove and started chopping.

""You did that on purpose?"" He sounded genuinely confused.

Then came the sob story. ""Her husband died in the line of duty. Made me promise to look after them. And you—you cook so well. The kid loves your food.""

I stayed quiet.

Ethan sighed, shoulders slumping. ""Fine. If it bothers you that much, we won't invite them over anymore.""

Chapter 4

The morning after Ethan left, I pulled out my suitcase and started packing—I'd be heading back to the village in a few days.

Sure, we'd been promised to each other since childhood, with all the formal exchanges of tokens and birthdates. But to truly cut ties, I needed to officially call off the engagement in front of the village elders. No loose ends.

As I folded my clothes, I spotted the quilt covers and pillowcases I'd spent years secretly embroidering—tiny stitches, late nights, all for nothing. Without hesitation, I stuffed them into a bag, along with the new shoes I'd made, and marched down to the pawn shop at the end of the street.

Thirty bucks. That's what years of careful needlework got me. Not much, but enough to cover meals and coffee at college for a while. Every penny counted.

Back home, I grabbed a marker and slashed a thick X over today's date on the calendar.

Twenty more days.

Twenty days, and I'd be free.

Ethan returned well past midnight.

The dinner I'd made sat cold and untouched on the table.

""I already ate at school,"" he said offhandedly.

But the faint trace of white tea perfume clinging to him told me the truth—he'd been with Linda and her daughter. He must have gone out to avoid an awkward meal at home.

I didn't press him. Silently, I cleared the dishes and retreated to my room.

My high school textbooks and test papers were everywhere—piled on the desk, spilling onto the floor, even creeping into the living room. I started bundling up the ones in my bedroom, planning to tackle the rest tomorrow after Ethan left.

Since I was moving out, none of my things had any right to stay.

A soft knock interrupted me.

Ethan. He always respected my space, never barging in without permission.

""What is it?"" I asked, blocking his view of the half-packed boxes.

A pause. Then, his voice, measured and calm: ""I'm filling out the marriage report. Can we set the date for the ninth of next month?""

The ninth. The same day we'd married in my past life.

My gaze flicked to the bags by the door. ""Marriage is a serious thing,"" I said evenly. ""I'll need to ask my family first.""

Silence stretched between us before his footsteps finally faded down the hall.

I exhaled, sinking back against the headboard.

The truth was, with his status, he didn't need my family's approval to file the paperwork. And it wasn't like I had much family left—my parents had died young, and his parents had taken me in because of the betrothal.

To everyone else, I was already one of them. The marriage report was just a formality.",1,1753691652.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

""Sweetheart, please... just do this one thing for me. If you give in to Mr. Lowell, I'll finally get that Director promotion...""

Tears blurred my vision as I stood outside the hotel, wiping them away with trembling fingers. My husband's desperate plea echoed in my ears. Then, steeling myself, I walked toward that room.

What I didn't know—what I couldn't have known—was that Mr. Lowell wasn't alone.

Inside, several middle-aged men waited, all with thick necks and greedy eyes.

Because the ""Mr. Lowell"" my husband had mentioned wasn't just one man.

My stomach twisted. I wanted to run, but my legs wouldn't obey.

The juice Daniel had given me earlier… something was off.

My name is Emily Laurent. I've been married for just a year.

Life with Daniel had been perfect—until it wasn't.

For the past month, he'd been drowning under work pressure, obsessed with landing a promotion.

Tonight, he invited his boss, Richard Lowell, to our home for dinner—a last-ditch effort to secure his future.

I left work early, bought fresh ingredients, and cooked my best dishes—roast chicken, garlic mashed potatoes, glazed carrots—paired with two bottles of expensive Cabernet.

When Daniel arrived with Mr. Lowell, I forced a polite smile.

First impression? Greasy. Overweight. Balding. The kind of man who made your skin crawl.

No wonder Daniel joked privately that people called him ""Fat Richard.""

The moment he stepped inside, his beady eyes locked onto me.

""Emily, what a lovely wife you have,"" he said, gripping my hand too tightly, his thumb brushing my knuckles. ""Beautiful and talented, I bet.""

I yanked my hand back, mumbling an excuse to wash up in the kitchen. Only then could I steady my breathing before bringing out the rice.

Dinner was a performance. Mr. Lowell raved about my cooking while Daniel nudged me under the table—Keep drinking with him. Smile more.

I wasn't a drinker. One glass left me dizzy.

Daniel, though, downed most of the wine, laughing too loud, steering every conversation back to the promotion—only for Mr. Lowell to smirk and change the subject.

After dessert, they lounged on the sofa while I cleaned up.

Then—hands. Thick, clammy hands snaking around my waist from behind.

I spun around.

Not Daniel.

Mr. Lowell loomed over me, his breath reeking of wine.

""Mr. Lowell—you're drunk. Let me pass—""

He blocked the doorway, arms spread. ""Emily... your husband's passed out cold. You do want that promotion for him, don't you?""

His grin widened as he reached out, his fingers grazing my cheek.

Chapter 2

My body locked up for a heartbeat, my mind blank with shock.

But when Richard Lowell's fingers grazed toward me, my reflexes kicked in—I swatted his arm away and bolted from the kitchen like my life depended on it.

The living room revealed Daniel sprawled on the couch, snoring lightly like nothing was wrong.

Richard materialized in the doorway moments later, his expression sour. ""Well, Emily,"" he said, adjusting his tie, ""since you're... indisposed, we'll continue this conversation at the office tomorrow. About your husband's promotion, of course.""

He paused at the door, flashing teeth that didn't reach his eyes. ""Oh, and compliments to the chef. That pot roast was divine.""

I managed a stiff nod, my goodbye wave trembling. The second the door clicked shut, I exhaled like I'd been punched.

Daniel groaned awake almost immediately. ""Where's Richard?"" he mumbled, rubbing his face.

My throat tightened. ""Honey, that man—he's not who you think. His hands were all over—""

""Come on,"" Daniel scoffed, suddenly alert. ""Every woman at the firm worships him. They have lunch dates, for Christ's sake.""

The words shriveled in my mouth. I'd expected concern, maybe anger—not this blind defense.

Weeks passed with Daniel's promotion dangling like a carrot. Then came the confession over takeout: ""It's Sophia Roland now,"" he admitted, pushing lo mein around his plate. ""Rumor is she showed up at Richard's place with 'gifts' last night. Babe, if you just—""

""Absolutely not."" My chopsticks clattered onto the table. That slimy smirk of Richard's haunted me.

Daniel caught my wrist. ""This is our future. Double salary. Annual bonuses. Maybe even Bali?"" His thumbs traced circles on my skin—the way he'd done during our courthouse wedding. ""One dinner. One gift. That's all.""

I should've held firm. But the bags under his eyes, the way his dress shirts hung looser these days...

""Fine,"" I whispered.

Two hours later, I stood shivering in the driveway—black miniskirt riding up, stockings snagging on my own doubts—wondering how delivering a bottle of Scotch turned into this.

Chapter 3

My husband drove me to Mr. Lowell's apartment building, his knuckles white on the steering wheel. He thrust the carefully wrapped gifts into my hands. ""You should go up alone,"" he said, avoiding my eyes.

The elevator ride felt endless. When I reached the penthouse, I barely had time to ring the bell before the door flew open—revealing Sophia Roland, our office manager, draped over Mr. Lowell like a human necklace, her lips planted on his neck.

My breath caught. For a heartbeat, I thought I'd interrupted a marital moment—until recognition hit. Sophia recovered first, flashing a Cheshire cat smile as she sauntered past me. Her blouse buttons were mismatched, and when our eyes met, hers burned with pure venom.

""Here about Daniel's promotion?"" she purred, leaning close enough for me to smell her Chanel No. 5. ""Good luck with that."" Her mocking laughter trailed behind her like toxic perfume.

""Emily! What a surprise!"" Mr. Lowell boomed, acting like we'd just bumped into each other at a coffee shop. The apartment was conspicuously empty—no wife, no kids, just an uncomfortable silence and my pounding heart.

I extended the gifts with both hands, my smile straining. His fingers lingered too long against mine, the contact making my skin crawl after what I'd just witnessed.

He poured water I didn't want. ""Your husband's talented, no question,"" he began, circling like a shark. ""But the board favors Sophia for this promotion..."" His eyes dropped to my wedding ring. ""Unless you're willing to... negotiate.""

The implication hung between us, thick as cigar smoke. When I didn't respond, he waved at the untouched gifts. ""Take these back. Meet me tomorrow at The Ritz-Carlton—Suite 808. Show up, and Daniel gets promoted the next morning."" His smile turned wolfish. ""Sleep on it.""

Daniel's face darkened when he saw the rejected gifts. He slammed the steering wheel so hard the horn blared. ""Goddammit! I knew Sophia would pull this shit!""

1mbar4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1mbar4z/the_wedding_theyll_never_forget/,The Wedding They'll Never Forget,"Chapter 1

Paul and I had spent over a decade building a life together—growing our business, mapping out our future, and counting down to the wedding we'd always dreamed of. Then, with one accidental click, it all shattered.

I found a shared document in his Cloud Drive—one I was never supposed to see. Inside were secret meet-up plans, steamy love notes, and hotel receipts. The gut punch? He was cheating with Claire Winslow, my most trusted employee. In that moment, something inside me snapped.

Our perfect life? A sham. Our business? Soon to be mine alone. And the wedding? Oh, it wasn't getting canceled. It was going to be the beginning of their nightmare.

I wasn't some weepy fiancée who'd slink away quietly. No, I'd take everything from them—piece by piece, until there was nothing left. They thought they could betray me and walk off unscathed. They had no idea who they were dealing with.

Wedding planning had me swamped—juggling work while prepping for what was supposed to be the happiest day of my life. One night, as I finalized our guest list, I shared it with Paul via Cloud Drive. He was away at a conference, so this was how we stayed organized. Everything seemed flawless… until I noticed something odd.

A few days earlier, he'd logged into his email on my laptop, so when I opened the drive that night, it defaulted to his account. Scrolling through folders, one document stood out: \[Business Projections Q3\]. Dry title, standard stuff—except I hadn't created it, and it wasn't tied to any active project.

Curiosity got the best of me.

I clicked, expecting spreadsheets. Instead, the first line hit like a sucker punch: \[Can't stop thinking about that night at the hotel… next time I'll wear red.\] My stomach lurched. This wasn't a work file. It was shared exclusively between Paul and an unfamiliar email: \[email protected\].

Hands shaking, I checked the edit history. The full story unfolded—coded talk of post-meeting hookups, fake ""work dinners,"" even plans to keep their affair going after our wedding like it was just a minor inconvenience.

I sat there, numb. They'd used our business as cover, plotting romantic escapes while I'd poured my soul into building our future. The document wasn't even hidden. He'd gotten so bold, so sloppy, he didn't bother deleting the evidence. Now it glared at me from his shared folder, a cruel cosmic joke.

""Hey, Ruby—sorry, I can't make the tasting today. Can your mom go with you?"" Paul's voice was all fake regret when I called to remind him. Same excuse, different day. I forced a breezy tone. ""No problem. Just don't overdo it at work, okay?""

The second I hung up, my fists clenched. His reckoning was coming. And I'd make sure it hurt.

After days of ugly crying and rage-spiraling, I pulled myself together. Step one of my ten-part revenge plan? Gather proof.

Thanks to our shared WeCloud account—meant for syncing calendars and photos—I dug through his phone, emails, and bank records without tipping him off. Scrolling my photo gallery, I spotted new uploads from his device. Mostly boring work shots… until I landed on a lingerie selfie of Claire in a hotel mirror.

My chest caved. Swiping frantically, the next photo sealed it: Paul, shirtless in the same room, smirking at the camera.

Then, while working from home (as he ""stayed late at a meeting""), I opened our Streamify app and spotted a private playlist called \[Late Nights\]. Not our music. Not public. Clicking it revealed a soundtrack to their affair—songs like ""Secret Love Song"" and ""Dirty Little Secret,"" peppered with Claire's notes: \[For our weekend getaway\], \[That night.\]

It took weeks, sneaking around wedding prep and work, but soon I had it all—messages, receipts, photos. Filed away, ready for the perfect moment. I'd strike when it destroyed them most.

Chapter 2

The second step was cutting him off from our social circle—but I had to be smart about it. Too fast, and he'd notice. Too obvious, and I'd look suspicious. So I started small, planting seeds in casual conversations.

Over brunch with friends, I'd sigh and say, ""He's been so busy lately—always out of town for work. I get it, but with the wedding coming up… I just wish he were around more.""

The perfect balance of understanding and subtle concern. Just enough to make them sympathetic—but also suspicious. I'd brush it off with a smile, like it was no big deal, but I could see the doubt flicker in their eyes.

Over time, I painted him as distracted, distant—unreliable. When his friends (who conveniently worked with me) asked about wedding plans, I'd say, ""Oh, I've been handling most of it. He's swamped with work, flying out every other week. But it's fine—he's stressed.""

The more I played the patient fiancée, the more people questioned him. They'd whisper behind his back—Why isn't he helping? Doesn't he care? Friends texted to ""check in,"" some outright saying, ""It's weird he's not more involved, don't you think?""

I'd laugh it off, playing supportive, but the damage was done. His friends stopped inviting him out—""Didn't want to bother him."" Others made excuses when he reached out. ""Too busy.""

I never accused him outright—that would've been too obvious. Instead, I let them believe he was the problem. And slowly, they all drifted to my side.

By the time he noticed, he was already isolated.

While he was distracted with her, I moved to step three: taking control of our assets.

This wasn't something I could rush—he was too involved in the business. So I worked quietly, under the radar.

I started small. During meetings with our accountant, I'd ""double-check"" paperwork he'd already signed. He'd wave me off—""You handle it."" Perfect.

Soon, I was the one managing everything—contracts, investments, property. I slipped in clauses, transferred assets to my name, rewrote documents. All while he was too preoccupied to notice.

I even hired my own lawyer—someone he didn't know—specializing in hostile takeovers. We built an airtight case. If he ever fought back, I'd win.

By the time he glanced at a bank statement or questioned a decision, I had an answer ready. ""It's all under control."" And he'd relax, trusting me.

He had no idea I was stealing everything from him.

Soon, the business he thought we shared would be mine—every asset, every dollar, every property.

And he'd have nothing.

Chapter 3

Claire Winslow wasn't just his secret lover—she was one of our longest-standing employees, practically there since day one. She held a key role in the company, which made things complicated, but also gave me the perfect opportunity to ruin them both. If I played my cards right, I wouldn't just expose their affair—I'd destroy their careers in the process.

I knew I couldn't just blow the whistle without consequences, so instead, I took my time dismantling her position, piece by piece. This was step four.

First, I needed to plant the seeds of doubt. Whenever Claire and I discussed potential business leads, I'd ""accidentally"" slip her bad intel.

""Hey, Claire,"" I'd say casually over coffee, ""I heard from a contact there's a big investor eyeing our market. Might be worth looking into.""

Of course, the deals always fell through. The investors I sent her to were either uninterested or notoriously difficult to work with.

Before long, Claire started fumbling in meetings, looking more and more incompetent in front of the board. Rumors about her failures spread fast, and she had no idea I was the one pulling the strings.

Nobody called her out directly, but the writing was on the wall—she was being phased out. Fewer meetings, fewer requests for her input. It was only a matter of time.

But I didn't stop there. While she was busy chasing dead-end leads, I worked behind the scenes to rally the team around me. I positioned myself as the indispensable leader—the one who got things done.

Every time Claire messed up, I was there to clean up the mess, making sure the team saw me as the steady hand they could trust.

In meetings, I'd drop subtle hints about her poor judgment. ""I know Claire thought this deal was promising, but it seems like things didn't pan out… again. Maybe we should rethink our approach.""

I never outright blamed her—just enough to make everyone question if she was cut out for leadership.

Behind closed doors, I worked key team members, taking them out for drinks, planting doubts. ""Look, I know Claire means well, but she's been making some risky calls lately. We can't afford to keep losing investors.""

Slowly, they started seeing me as the real leader. Every mistake she made pushed them further into my corner.

By the time board meetings rolled around, I was the problem solver while Claire struggled to explain why her deals kept collapsing. Her confidence crumbled—she grew defensive, desperate, which only made her mistakes more obvious.

When the moment was right, I struck.

In a critical meeting, I laid out her string of failures, letting the investors and board members grill her with questions she couldn't answer. Then, I made my move—suggesting a vote of no confidence, proposing I take over her responsibilities to ""stabilize"" the company.

With the groundwork I'd laid, it was effortless. The board voted in my favor, and just like that, Claire was out.

A classic quiet firing—we shuffled her into a dead-end department, making her miserable until she'd have no choice but to quit on her own.

She never saw it coming. Too wrapped up in her affair with my fiancé to realize I'd been orchestrating her downfall from the start.

The best part? She couldn't even blame me without looking like a sore loser.",1,1753691579.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Besides the nightly potty breaks and potty accidents in the house (two days clean then two leaks on the kitchen floor in just one hour!!), she is just freaking crazy.
She usually is widely awake at 4:45 in the morning. We go potty and would like to sleep until 6 then but not with Ms. Puppy. She will bite our feet, nibble on the carpet, the bedframe, the crate, her bed.
YES, we tried giving her something to chew on (from coffee wood,  frozen cloths, cold tethers, kongs to dry horse scalp or a treat ball). Nothing will calm her down. Today morning we put her in the closed crate (usually she sleeps in the open crate so we hear her standing up to potty), today we closed it because we had to get that extra 30 min of sleep. She cried a few minutes but calmed then. 
The next extreme moments are before AND after eating. She bites, nibbles, pulls on everything. We tried to calm her after eating but that’s possible for like 10 minutes, then she’s going crazy again. 
Problem is, I have to work alongside. I’m in home office the whole week but have to do my 8hrs work including conferences and stuff. That is absolutely not possible with this monster destroying everything. Even the crate didn’t work after breakfast, she just cried for 15 minutes and tried to destroy it from the inside. I also don’t want to take the positive feeling towards the box from her more than that, or otherwise  she won’t sleep in it at night. 
And yes, we do go outside with her regularly (at least every 2 hours), we try short rounds in the leash (which she absolutely hates, so no calm walk). Even if we just go in the garden to her potty place she finds everything much more interesting (the fence, the gras, the trees). There is ABSOLUTELY NO WAY to just “go potty calmly” because she always finds something to freak out about. 
As you can see I’m emotionally devastated and need help. Please tell me it gets better. Please give me some tips on how to calm these little monsters without destroying the trust built between us. I’ve got the feeling to do everything the wrong way. 
I love her, but really just in the moments she is asleep. Other times a day I’m crying almost nonstop. ",4,1753691387.0,puppy101,6,0.83,False

I've no idea how long ago or where in CT, if anyone can help research. I'd love to hear what happened to him. Without him knowing. 

Back story- When I was 13, year 9 at Ledyard High School, in Connecticut USA.
I had a 18 year old boyfriend who was a nasty piece of work. I can't understand why the adults around me didn't know what was going on and stop it. I was scared and good at masking. 
I don't mind giving more details to help find what happened. I'm new to redit, and not sure how much to say. I'll give you the jist.

I was a freshmen, he was a senior in high school. He rode my bus, I always being kind, befriended him. 

He, basically, took me hostage. He became my boyfriend and totally controlled my life. 
He and his friends had guns. We used to shoot in the woods at trees. He threatened to kill my family if I told anyone. 
I went from a sweet kind girl to a drug/alcohol addicted crazy person in 18 months. 
My mom once even noticed the finger bruses around my neck, but I lied. Mom and dad were busy at work and I actually, at 14, believed he would kill my family and leave me alive. 
It ended because he graduated, so when he came on to school grounds to force me out of class. And then attacked a teacher. 
The school decided to expell me. It's almost funny now.

Yes, I was expelled from Ledyard High school because my ex made a scene. 
So the next day, I'm home alone. He breaks in. Does bad stuff. Actually almost ends me. My brother gets home from school, to madness. Calls the police. He runs off. 
I'm a mess, lie to police. Knowing he'll be back, I tell my mom, he'll be back. 
So mom gets home and kinda throws me out of the house. 
I'm set to live with a family member who lived a few towns away. 
I was 17, living on the streets of New London CT when I went to rehab. I stayed sober 30 years,  went to Post University and moved overseas. 
I moved overseas because I never wanted to ever see him again. I didn't join FB for years because I was afraid he'd somehow find me. 
I've not told this story in years. I'm feeling positive and it's nice to remember how strong I am. 

Anyway, sorry,
I was trying for the short version but I've ADHD. Lol. 

Now, recently I heard he'd be shot in a drug deal. Nice. 
And paralysed, even better. Sorry. 
I've tried to research it but no luck. I'll share more information via pm, I didn't want to embarrass his family. I hope they didn't know but they must have. 
Anyway, hope you have a lovely day. I'm off to refill my coffee. ",2,1753691123.0,abusesurvivors,0,1.0,False

1mbal75,https://i.redd.it/sgevclv7rkff1.png,Top use cases for stablecoins,"**Let’s talk stablecoins: What are they actually g*****ood*** **for?**

Okay, so you’ve heard the buzz. Stablecoins this, stablecoins that. Maybe your crypto-savvy friend won't shut up about USDT or USDC. But beyond the noise, what’s the actual point of these things? I mean, *why* are they everywhere lately?

Let’s break it down — no suits, no jargon. Just real use cases that make stablecoins... well, stable and surprisingly useful.

# 1. Everyday payments without the volatility headache

Imagine trying to pay for coffee with Bitcoin. By the time the barista scans your wallet, the price might've jumped or tanked. Not ideal.

Stablecoins, pegged to real-world currencies like the US dollar or euro, stay pretty... boring. And boring is *great* when you're paying rent, shopping online, or splitting lunch. You're not gambling — you're transacting.

And guess what? On platforms like [bitloga.com](https://bitloga.com/index.php?ref=274), you can swap in and out of stablecoins quickly and without the usual nonsense.

# 2. Cross-border transfers that don’t rob you blind

If you've ever tried sending money internationally — you know. Fees, delays, conversions, headaches. And banks? Don't even start.

Stablecoins cut through all that. Want to send $500 from Berlin to Tbilisi? Boom — it's there in minutes, often for pennies in fees. No surprise charges. No exchange-rate voodoo.

It’s like the future showed up and said, “Hey, wiring money shouldn’t feel like pulling teeth.”

# 3. Parking your value (When markets get weird)

Crypto markets can be... emotional. One minute it's all green candles. Next? Pure chaos. Sometimes, you just wanna hit pause.

Traders — both seasoned and just-started-yesterday — often move their assets into stablecoins during high volatility. It’s like jumping off a roller coaster and chilling on a bench while still staying inside the park.

Think of stablecoins as your digital piggy bank — minus the pig.

# 4. Onboarding new users (Without scaring them off)

Let’s face it — jumping into crypto is intimidating. Wallets, gas fees, seed phrases... it’s a lot.

Stablecoins offer a softer entry. They're familiar (a digital dollar still *feels* like a dollar), and they don’t rollercoaster in price. It’s why more and more apps, especially in emerging markets, are using stablecoins as a first step into Web3.

(We’ve seen it first-hand at BitLoga — people are way more comfortable starting with USDT than with something like ETH or BTC.)

# 5. DeFi, Yield farming & other wild things

Okay, now we're getting spicy.

For those a little deeper into the rabbit hole, stablecoins unlock a whole buffet of DeFi tools. You can lend them out, earn yield, provide liquidity, and more — all while sidestepping price crashes.

They’re the unsung workhorses of the decentralized world. Not flashy, but always working behind the scenes.

# So… Are Stablecoins Boring?

Kinda. And that’s exactly why they’re powerful.

In a space full of hype, speculation, and crazy price swings, stablecoins offer clarity. Simplicity. Reliability. Whether you're a crypto vet or still googling “what is blockchain,” they’ve got a role in your toolkit.

And when it comes time to exchange them — quickly, safely, and without drama — platforms like [bitloga.com](https://bitloga.com/index.php?ref=274) are built for that exact moment.

**Final thought?** Stablecoins aren’t trying to reinvent the wheel. They're just making sure the car runs smoother. And sometimes, that’s exactly what we need.",1,1753690897.0,BitLoga,0,1.0,False
1mbakue,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndhorrorstories/comments/1mbakue/player_abuses_his_wife_and_brother/,Player Abuses His Wife and Brother,"I really do love this game. The psychological benefits of being able to mentally place yourself in a dangerous situation and talk your way out of it, that's a principle selling point for working through trauma. If a person has any underlying trust, control, or paranoia issues - this game puts a spot light on it. 

I've recently ended a campaign (without finishing it, a second time) do to one players continuingly abusive and controlling behavior. It would have been a whole year this October.

Gloomstalker/Assassin (Hubby), Circle of the Moon Druid (Wifey), and Eldritch Knight (Bro). The fact that I didn't just outright ban Hubby's uber-class combo is beyond me. Broken from day one, but I wanted to see where it went. I did beg him to pick something else, which he ignored - that should've been my second red flag.

Hubby needed to break the game. I never called him on cheating dice rolls (and TBH, even though they had the books, they didn't become familiar with the rules) but one time my 3/2, Rogue/ Ranger some how got 42 HP with a single longbow hit.

Hubby also did not like his wife having a few beers, even though he and I would go through a pitcher or two. He would tell her how to play her character, constantly second guess her, and put her down right in front of me. As far as I could see, wifey was head over heels for Hubby (who doesn't want that) but she could only stand so much of it before she started handing it back to him. Bro was great, no complaints. Every time they'd do this he got this look on his face like he had greater insight in their martial bliss.

Originally we played at coffee shops and pubs but then they got a house and we played there until one time i found myself having to acclimate to the potent smell of dog piss in order to run my game. After that, we only played 3 more times at the saloon. 

The last game, they're in a mine. They encounter a Spectator. The thing doesn't even get to move and they do 97 HP before i can even roll initiative with this Readying Action-SOCOM seal team bullshit. So, wanting to have an experience different than what they've done for the last 9 months, in my great DM brain, decided the Spectator heals itself completely and then we roll initiative.

Well, no body was happy with that. They wanted to breeze through the place and i did not facilitate that endeavor. Ultimately, I saw this and let them kill the damn thing in the second round, totally deflating my efforts and interest in playing with this group any longer. I shouldn't have to cheat.

I've never argued more with another player. The game would come to a screeching hault when he did not agree with the Stealth setup for the scene. The biggest gripe I had was the number of times I had to explain how Readying An Action works...until the start of your next turn...that's it, you can't hold it forever.

I'm starting a new group. Grateful for the learning experience, won't be doing that again. These assholes stole miniatures from the saloon's supply of board games to use for their PCs and never returned them.",4,1753690858.0,dndhorrorstories,2,1.0,False

My Alpha husband, Ferris, handed me the cold contract, his voice devoid of any warmth:  
“I have a beloved partner who has temporarily left me. For the next three years, you will simply take her place as my Luna.”  
I accepted it all quietly and obediently—  
Three years were enough for me to plan a perfect exit.  
He sneered, “Boring Omega she-wolf.”  
When the contract finally expired, he thought I would remain his loyal shadow forever.  
But he was wrong—I never intended to stay.  
In the darkness of night, I dialed that long-forgotten number: “Dad, I’ve accepted the Black Mountain pack’s marriage proposal.”  
Later, at the solemn clan ceremony, Ferris watched helplessly as I linked arms with the Black Mountain Alpha, radiant with glory.  
In that moment, the world he had meticulously built crumbled to pieces.  
He finally understood that what he had let go of was not a temporary substitute—  
but the one and only true Luna destined by fate to resonate with his soul.

""I just sent you a divorce agreement. Alpha Ferris and I signed it on our wedding day three years ago. Could you check if there are any issues?""

I stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, my fingers unconsciously tracing the edge of my phone.

""Luna, I've reviewed the agreement. Everything looks fine.""

My lawyer's professional voice came through the speaker.

""There's one month left before the three-year term expires. Once it's up, the divorce will automatically take effect. You'll be free to leave the Silver Moon Pack and start fresh.""

""Thank you.""

I hung up and lifted my gaze to our wedding photo on the wall.

In the picture, I wore a pristine white gown, smiling so wide my eyes curved like crescent moons.

Beside me stood Alpha Ferris in his tailored suit—devastatingly hands0me, yet not even a hint of a smile graced his features.

Love versus indifference. Crystal clear.

""That day's finally coming. You must be thrilled,"" I whispered to myself, my fingertip gently tracing the cold, sharp lines of the man's face in the photo.

The sound of keys jingling at the front door made me quickly pull my hand back and turn around.

""I'm home.""

I took Ferris's suit jacket as he shrugged it off, then squatted down to help him into his slippers.

My movements flowed with practiced precision, like I'd rehearsed this routine a thousand times.

Ferris loosened his tie, his expression remaining distant.

""Next month's Moonlight Gala for the Silver Moon Pack—I need you there as Luna.""

Thinking about that divorce agreement set to activate in one month, my hands paused while folding his jacket.

I shook my head. ""I can't make it.""

""Why not?"" Ferris frowned.

I opened my mouth to explain, but suddenly something clicked in his mind. His eyes turned glacial.

""Is this because I've been spending time with Ashley? Are you jealous?""

""I told you on our wedding day—I'm in love with someone else. You said you wouldn't interfere.""

My heart clenched violently, like someone had torn it wide open.

Right. My mate, my Alpha, had told me on our wedding night that he already had a she-wolf he truly loved. He'd only married me to shut up the pack elders.

Not only that, but on our wedding night, he'd forced me to sign an agreement to divorce after three years.

Looking at Ferris's irritated expression, I managed a weak smile.

He thought I was jealous. Throwing a tantrum.

I am merely fulfilling his wish by leaving the Silver Moon Pack next month, so I will not be able to attend the banquet.

He must be ecstatic. Soon he'd be free to marry his true love.

With a bitter smile tugging at my lips, I reminded him, ""Ferris, do you remember the agreement we signed three years ago?""

Three years ago, the Silver Moon Pack and Stardust pack announced their upcoming alliance through marriage.

These were two of the wealthiest and most powerful packs in the werewolf world. With their heirs becoming mates, both packs would reach unprecedented heights of strength and prestige.

I'd harbored a secret crush on Ferris since childhood. Learning I'd become his Luna had sent me over the moon.

But on our wedding night, Ferris handed me divorce papers.

""I'm in love with someone else. Her name is Ashley Carter. Since she's an omega, my father refuses to let her become my Luna.""

His tone was cold, his words brutally direct. ""I need three years to become Silver Moon's true Alpha. After that, no one will dare oppose our union.""

""For these three years, we'll just play the role of husband and wife. Then we divorce.""

That night, I signed as he wished, then cried in the bathroom until dawn.

But less than three months after our wedding, Ashley vanished without a trace after a fight with Ferris.

Ferris went crazy searching for her. He pulled every string, used every connection, but found nothing.

During that period, he'd stay out all night, coming home reeking of alcohol with terrifyingly dark eyes.

Until one night, he stumbled home completely wasted and pinned me to the bed.

His kiss crashed down on me, heavy with alcohol, but he whispered, ""Ashley... why did you leave? Why are you with someone else? Don't you trust me?""

My entire body went rigid. My heart felt like someone was crushing it in their fist—the pain nearly suffocating.

So... he'd found her.

But Ashley was with someone else now.

That night was my first time, yet Ferris held me while calling another woman's name until sunrise.

The next morning, Ferris saw the blood on the sheets. His eyes flickered with something unreadable, but he said nothing.

I acted like nothing had happened, preparing his fresh clothes and even gently reminding him about his important meeting before he left.

I pretended everything was fine, but inside, I was bleeding out.

Married for three years, secretly married for three years. The Silver Moon wolves knew their Alpha had taken a Luna, but only a select few knew her name or what she looked like.

I didn't care about any of that. From then on, I became even more careful about taking care of Ferris.

Ferris was always buried in pack business, frequently skipping meals. At night, his stomach would cramp with excruciating pain.

So I'd wake before dawn every day, spending hours brewing medicinal herb soup.

When he was exhausted, I learned massage techniques to ease his tension.

He loved quiet, so I never made noise around him. I hid my naturally cheerful, sunny personality and even softened my footsteps.

Gradually, Ferris seemed to accept me as his mate.

He started giving me small gifts on holidays.

When I fell ill, he'd personally hunt down rare herbs based on the healer's prescriptions.

He'd even hold me close during the night, his palm pressed against my waist, his body heat scorching.

Ferris never mentioned divorce again, as if that agreement had never existed.

I was naive enough to believe that maybe, just maybe, he could learn to love me.

Until three months ago, when Ashley returned to the Silver Moon Pack after her breakup.

Ferris rushed back to her side almost instantly.

He'd take her to dinner, go shopping with her, even cancel crucial pack meetings because Ashley mentioned feeling ""a little down.""

Standing at the window, watching Ferris's car head toward Ashley's apartment yet again, I finally understood.

True love is true love. No matter how much I gave, it could never compete with a single glance from Ashley.

At least the three-year contract marriage was finally ending.

I told myself these three years had been nothing but a dream.

Now the dream was over. Time for me to leave.

""The agreement from three years ago?""

Ferris's voice snapped me out of my memories. I stared at him in shock, my throat tightening.

He... didn't remember the divorce agreement?  
These three years, I'd been counting down every single day, terrified that the moment our contract expired, he'd leave without hesitation.

Yet now, he seemed to have completely forgotten about it.

I opened my mouth to remind him when Ferris's phone suddenly rang.

The moment he answered, Ashley's tear-choked voice came through the speaker.

I couldn't make out her words, but I watched Ferris's expression shift dramatically.

""Don't be scared. I'm coming right now.""

He hung up, grabbed his car keys, and bolted for the door.

In his rush, his shoulder slammed hard into my body.

I stumbled backward, my spine hitting the doorframe with enough force to make me gasp in pain.

But Ferris never looked back. His figure had already vanished through the doorway.

I steadied myself against the wall and slowly made my way back to the bedroom. When I removed my jacket, a dark bruise was already blooming across my shoulder.

I retrieved the first aid kit and silently applied ointment to the injury, feeling like my heart was being carved open with a dull blade, slice by agonizing slice.

I sat on the bed's edge, staring blankly at the darkening sky outside until my phone rang.

Ferris.

""Come to Silver Pine General Medical Center.""

My heart lurched. ""What happened?""

""Just get here.""

When I arrived, I spotted Ferris standing outside the operating room from across the corridor. Ashley was nestled against his ch3st, crying pitifully.

My steps faltered. Something clamped around my ch3st, making each breath a struggle.

""What's going on?"" I approached them, keeping my voice soft.

Ferris looked up at me. ""Ashley's mother has acute leukemia. She needs an immediate bone marrow transplant.""

I blinked in confusion. ""And?""

""We've tested everyone in Silver Moon Pack, including myself. No matches."" Ferris's tone remained flat. ""You have a donation record on file at the medical center. You're compatible.""

My pupils contracted as disbelief washed over me. ""You want me to donate bone marrow?""

""It's your responsibility as Luna.""

Ferris closed his eyes. When he opened them again, only cold determination remained. ""Hold her down.""

At his command, several warriors stepped forward and gripped my shoulders. One pulled out a syringe.

""Ferris Vargan!"" I struggled desperately. ""I already donated years ago—I can't donate again! This will kill me! Let me go!""

""If you do this, my father and the entire Stardust pack will never forgive you!""

The warriors hesitated, their grip loosening as they looked to Ferris for guidance.

""You'd tell any lie to avoid donating."" Ferris's voice turned glacial. ""Hold her. I'll take full responsibility for any consequences.""

The warriors didn't dare defy their Alpha. They pinned me down as the needle pierced my skin.

The anesthetic worked quickly. My consciousness began to blur, my strength fading until I couldn't fight anymore.

A healer spoke quietly nearby: ""Alpha Ferris, this surgery requires a family member's signature.""

Ferris took the pen and paper. ""I can sign right now.""

Family member...

My heart clenched violently.

Right. Legally, I was still his Luna.

This was the first time he'd so readily acknowledged me as his Luna.

And it was only so I could donate bone marrow to Ashley's mother.

How fu/cking ironic.

The nurse handed over the surgical consent form. Ferris wrote his name with careful, deliberate strokes.

For some inexplicable reason, his pen hesitated mid-signature, and a sharp pain shot through his ch3st.

Ashley urged him gently, tears glistening in her eyes. ""Are you having second thoughts?""

Ferris's gaze flickered, but he said nothing. He finished signing and watched as I was wheeled into the operating room.

The moment those doors closed, my tears finally fell.

So this was how deeply Ferris loved Ashley—enough to sacrifice my life for her sake.

Ferris, I'm never going to love you again.

The surgical lights blazed on while the corridor fell silent except for the sound of breathing.

After I disappeared behind those doors, he stood at the corridor's end, staring at that cold, steel barrier for what felt like hours—like a caged wolf unable to catch his mate's scent.

He tried to sit but lasted only seconds before springing back up to pace restlessly.

Only when he saw me being wheeled out of surgery did he finally exhale.

""How is she?""

The doctor removed his mask, but his expression remained grave. ""The surgery went smoothly, but the Luna's body is... extremely weak. Recovery will be difficult. She'll need careful, constant care.""

Ferris nodded. ""I'll go see her.""

He'd barely taken a step toward the patient room when a hand caught his arm.

Ashley.

""Ferris,"" she said softly, ""the beta just came from the Werewolf Council. They need you back immediately to handle the border territory dispute. It can't wait any longer.""

""I know you're worried about her, but you're the Alpha. The pack has to come first.""

Ferris's throat worked as uncertainty flashed in his eyes.

Ashley stepped forward, blocking his path. ""Go handle pack business. I'll stay and take care of her. I promise, when she wakes up, I'll be the first thing she sees.""

Ferris nodded and left the hospital with his subordinates.

I don't know how much time passed before I slowly opened my eyes after surgery.

I turned my head with difficulty, my throat feeling like sandpaper. My first instinct was to search for—

Ferris.

But the person in my line of sight was Ashley.

She smiled at me. ""You're finally awake. Thank you, Aurora. You saved my mother.""

I looked up at her without speaking.

Ashley wiped away tears, her voice thick with emotion. ""I really never imagined... after all these years, Ferris would still love me this deeply.""

She paused, as if lost in memory.

""Do you know? Last year on my birthday, he flew all the way to Paris just to bring me a necklace... It was a design I'd mentioned liking once in passing, and he actually remembered all that time.""

""But I was still angry with him then. I threw the necklace right back at him and wouldn't even let him through the door.""

My fingers clenched violently, nails digging deep into my palms.

I remembered perfectly. Last year, Ferris had told me he was traveling to Mississippi for business negotiations with the Ghost Wolf Pack.

When he returned, he'd brought back a necklace and casually given it to me.

I'd been overjoyed, treasuring it in the bottom of my jewelry box—too precious to even wear.

But it turned out... that was Ashley's reject, something he'd carelessly passed along to me.

Ashley continued, ""And the Christmas before last, I had a huge fight with my boyfriend at the time and posted something really depressing on Instagram. When Ferris saw it, he flew over that same night and stood outside my apartment building all night long. It was snowing heavily, but he just stood there, never daring to come up and knock.""

My heart twisted painfully.

I remembered that Christmas night—Ferris had been unusually passionate, making love to me seven times straight until dawn.

That entire night, he'd been rough and relentless in bed. Even when his harsh movements hurt me, I'd gritted my teeth and endured it.

Because I thought he was finally starting to feel something for me.

When I woke up the next morning, the bed beside me was already cold. I assumed he'd left to handle urgent pack business.

It turned out... he'd rushed off to see Ashley.

""These past three years..."" Ashley's tears fell again. ""I've been stubborn, deliberately avoiding contact with him. But Ferris never forgot me for a single day. He wrote me a letter every day, even though I never once replied.""

I suddenly found it hard to breathe.

How many late nights had I seen the study light on, thinking he was handling pack affairs? I'd even brewed coffee specially to bring him.

It turned out... he was writing love letters to Ashley.

I'd always believed that at least during Ashley's absence, Ferris genuinely wanted us to become a real married couple.

Now I understood. From beginning to end, it had all been my own delusional fantasy.

The heart I thought I'd finally warmed belonged entirely to someone else.

Seeing Ashley about to continue, I abruptly stood up.

My face was pale as paper, but I forced my voice to remain calm. ""I'm not feeling well. I need to rest.""

A flash of triumph crossed Ashley's eyes. ""Of course, you just had surgery. You should rest more.""

Her footsteps finally faded outside the door.

I lay on the hospital bed with my eyes open, staring at the blank ceiling.

After discharge, I silently packed all my belongings, waiting only for the divorce agreement's expiration.

During this time, I could track Ferris's activities daily through Ashley's social media—

The surgery had been successful, but he never once came to check on me. Instead, he immediately arranged the finest private room for Ashley's mother, flew in top medical teams from abroad, and personally supervised every treatment plan.

Ashley's latest Instagram post was a photograph.

Ferris knelt on one knee, tying her shoelaces.

Her caption read: \[I'll never meet anyone who loves me this much again.\]

My heart clenched violently. Tears splashed onto my phone screen, blurring the image of Ferris's tender profile.

I remembered how I'd cared for him with the same devotion all these years.

When his stomach troubled him, I'd brew medicinal soups daily.

When work kept him busy, I'd leave the lights on waiting for his return.

Every piece of fruit I brought him was peeled, cored, and cut to perfect bite-sized pieces...

But now he was doing these things for someone else.

I took a deep breath, wiped away my tears, and mind-linked Ferris.

After a long pause, Ferris responded coldly, ""I should have told you not to interrupt when I'm working—""

For the first time, I cut him off:

""Ferris, let's break our bond.""",3,1753690771.0,BlackNovel,8,1.0,False

My daughter looked at her and said, “Mommy.”  
That day, I finally woke up.  
I drafted the divorce papers, gave up custody, and walked away from it all, building a billion-dollar empire from scratch.  
But when I returned home one night with a business partner, my ex husband cornered me against the wall.  
“Divorce?” he said, eyes dark. “Not a chance.”

After seven years of marriage, my husband, Trevor, fell for another woman—even our daughter wanted her as her new mom.

When Celeste Rodriguez landed at the airport in Andostan, it was already past 9:00 pm.  
It was her birthday. Her phone buzzed with messages from colleagues and friends—but not a single one from her husband, Trevor Fleming.  
Celeste's smile faded.  
By the time she reached the villa, it was already past 10:00 pm.  
Hannah Lynd, the housekeeper looked startled. ""Mrs. Fleming... what a surprise.""  
""Where are Trevor and Jo?"" Celeste asked, handing over her luggage.  
""Mr. Fleming isn’t back yet. Miss Jordyn’s upstairs playing.""  
Celeste climbed the stairs. In her room, Jordyn sat in pajamas at her desk, completely absorbed.  
""Jo?"" Celeste called.  
Jordyn turned, her eyes lighting up. In a happy tone, she greeted, ""Mom!""  
But then she quickly got back to what she was doing earlier.  
Celeste walked over and hugged her tight, planting a kiss on her cheek. Yet the little one pushed her away and squirmed. ""Mom, I’m busy.""  
It had been two months since Celeste last saw Jordyn. She missed her so much that no amount of kisses felt enough. She wanted to talk to Jordyn.  
She noticed the necklace Jordyn was threading. ""Jo, are you making a seashell necklace?""  
""Mm-hm!"" Jordyn perked up visibly. ""Wynn's birthday is in a week. Dad and I picked and polished these ourselves. Pretty, right?""  
Celeste’s throat tightened. Jordyn didn’t look up, only added brightly, ""Dad even got her a custom gift, tomorrow—""  
Celeste felt a pang in her chest and couldn't hold back anymore. ""Jo… Do you remember it's my birthday today?""  
""Huh?"" Jordyn glanced up briefly, then quickly looked back down at the string of beads in her hands, She complained, ""Mom, don’t talk, Look, I messed up the bead order—""  
Celeste stood there in silence for a while, but Jordyn never looked back up. Finally, Celeste pursed her lips and left the room without another word.  
Downstairs, Hannah said, ""I called Mr. Fleming. He said he’s busy tonight and you should rest first.""  
""I see."" Celeste replied softly.  
She hesitated, then called Trevor. It rang for a while before he answered.  
his tone was indifferent as usual. ""I'm busy. Let's talk tomorrow—""  
A woman’s voice chimed in: ""Trevor, who is it?""  
Wynn.  
Celeste gripped the phone tighter.  
""No one important,"" Trevor answered her.  
Before Celeste could say anything, Trevor had already hung up.  
Celeste stared at the screen. Two or three months apart, and this was all he had for her.  
After so many years of marriage, he’d always been cold. Distant. Impatient.  
She had got used to chasing after him, calling again, begging for time. Yet tonight, she didn’t bother.  
Perhaps she was just too tired.

The next morning, Celeste thought it over and decided to call Trevor again.  
There was a time difference of about 17 or 18 hours between Andostan and their home country. In Andostan, today was her actual birthday.  
She didn’t just come here for Jordyn. She wanted one thing: a family meal. Her only birthday wish.  
Yet, Trevor didn’t answer.  
A long time later, he texted: What’s up?  
She replied: Lunch today? Just the three of us.  
Trevor answered: Okay. Send the address.  
Alright, she typed back.  
That was it. No acknowledgment. No “Happy birthday.” She wasn’t surprised. But it still stung.  
As she headed downstairs, she overheard Jordyn talking with Hannah.  
""Aren't you happy that Mrs. Fleming is here, sweetie?"" Hannah asked.  
""Dad and I promised to take Wynn to the beach tomorrow. If Mom comes, it'll be weird. She’s always mean to Wynn.""  
""Mrs. Fleming is still your mom, sweetie. That’s hurtful.""  
""I know, but Dad and I like Wynn more. Can't Wynn be my mom instead?""  
Celeste froze.  
She had raised Jordyn herself most of the time. But over the past two years, the more time Jordyn spent with Trevor, the more attached she became to him. When Trevor came to Andostan to expand his business last year, Jordyn had insisted on coming along.  
Celeste was reluctant and had hoped Jordyn would stay by her side. But she couldn't bear to see Jordyn upset, so she agreed.  
And now, Jordyn didn’t even want her as her mom anymore.  
Celeste stood frozen in place, her face pale. To think that she had pushed aside her work to come to Andostan with the intention of spending more time with Jordyn.  
Now, it seemed unnecessary.  
She walked back to her room, pale and quiet, then repacked the gifts she’d brought.  
Later, Hannah texted: Madame, I took Jordyn out. Let me know if you need anything.  
Celeste sat on the bed, feeling hollow and lost inside. She had abandoned her work and made this trip, only to find no one wanted her here.  
Her arrival was nothing but a joke.

After a long while, she left the villa. Aimlessly, she drove around in this foreign yet familiar country.  
By noon, she remembered she had planned to have lunch with Trevor and Jordyn. As she recalled what she had overheard in the morning, she hesitated about whether to go home and pick up Jordyn.  
Then, a text from Trevor came: Something came up. Lunch’s canceled.  
Celeste stared at it.  
She should’ve known. Trevor always canceled on her. His work, friends, and everything else always came before her, his wife.  
Once, she’d cry. Today, she just felt… empty.  
Celeste was at an utter loss. She had come all this way excitedly only to be met with indifference from both Trevor and Jordyn.  
Aimlessly, she drove around. Eventually, she found herself outside an old favorite restaurant which she and Trevor used to frequent.  
Just as she was about to walk in, she saw them.  
Trevor. Jordyn. Wynn.  
Wynn sat next to Jordyn, laughing, feeding the little one the pastries she had taken a bite out of. Jordyn giggled, with her legs swinging around happily. Trevor smiled as he served food to both of them, but his gaze never left Wynn.  
What a happy family of three!  
So this was his ""something came up.""  
And this was the daughter she had carried for ten long months and nearly lost her life to bring into this world.  
Celeste laughed humorlessly. She stood there watching for a long time. Finally, she turned and drove away.

Back at the villa, Celeste drafted the divorce agreement.  
Trevor had been her teenage dream—but he had never truly seen her. If not for that one night and his grandfather Arnold Fleming’s pressure, he never would’ve married her. She thought loving him hard enough would be enough, but seven years proved otherwise.  
For a long time, she felt lucky to have Jo—her only source of comfort. But now, even Jo didn’t seem to want her.  
That was it.  
She was done—with the marriage, the lies, the thankless role of wife and mother. It was time to leave all this behind—and reclaim the promising life she'd given up!  
She sealed the divorce papers, handed them to Hannah, then grabbed her suitcase and walked out, bound for the airport. On the way, she finally dialed the number she’d been avoiding for months.  
The line rang once. Twice. A click.  
“Hello?”  
She took a breath, steady and sharp.“That offer still stand?”“I’m in.”  
...  
At around 9:00 pm, Trevor and Jordyn returned home.  
Jordyn clung to the hem of Trevor's coat and got out of the car sluggishly. Because Celeste was at home, she was reluctant to return that night.  
But Wynn had said that Celeste came specifically to be with her and Trevor, and if they didn't return, she would be sad. Trevor also said that if they didn't go home that night, Celeste would definitely insist on joining them on their outing to the sea the next day.  
Reluctantly, Jordyn agreed to come home.  
Still worried, she muttered gloomily, ""Dad, what if Mom insists on tagging along with us tomorrow?""  
""She won't,"" Trevor replied confidently.  
In all the years they'd been married, Celeste had always tried to find ways to spend more time with him. But she was also sensible. As long as he made his stance clear, she wouldn't dare make him upset.  
In Jordyn's memory, Celeste always listened to Trevor. Since he said she wouldn't, she felt reassured. As a result, her mood lifted. She made her way into the villa cheerfully and told Hannah she wanted to take a bath.  
""Sure, sure,"" Hannah replied to Jordyn. Then, she remembered Celeste's instructions and handed an envelope to Trevor. ""Mr. Fleming, this is from Mrs. Fleming. She asked me to give it to you.""  
Trevor took the envelope and asked casually, ""Where is she?""  
""Mrs. Fleming packed up and went back to the country this afternoon. Didn't you know?"" Hannah responded.  
Trevor paused mid-step as he was heading upstairs. He turned back, feeling a little surprised. ""Has she gone back?""  
""Yes.""  
Why had Celeste suddenly come to Andostan? Trevor hadn't given her a chance to tell him about it. He hadn't cared to ask either. Upon learning she'd left, he didn't dwell on it.  
Jordyn was a little surprised too. When she heard the news, she felt a small twinge of disappointment. She'd been thinking that even if Celeste didn't join them for the outing tomorrow, it might be nice to have her around at home in the evening.  
Polishing the seashells made her hands hurt—she had been counting on Celeste's help in finishing the necklace.  
Though it had been months since Trevor and Celeste had seen each other, she had made the effort to visit but only to leave without seeing him in person. Hannah recalled Celeste's grim expression as she left and thought that things felt a little off.  
She couldn't help but say, ""Mr. Fleming, Mrs. Fleming looked upset when she left. She seemed angry.""  
Hannah had assumed Celeste's sudden departure was due to an urgent matter. Upon realizing Trevor hadn't known she'd left, she began to feel something was amiss.  
""Angry?"" Trevor repeated in his mind.  
In his presence, Celeste had always been patient and accommodating. So, she could get angry too? This was new.  
Trevor smiled faintly and responded to Hannah perfunctorily before heading upstairs.  
Back in the bedroom, he was about to open the envelope Celeste had left when Wynn called. After answering the call, he tossed the envelope aside and walked out the door.  
A short while later, the envelope slipped off the bed onto the floor.  
That night, Trevor didn't return home.  
The next day, Hannah noticed the envelope on the floor when she was cleaning. Recognizing it as the one Celeste had asked her to hand over, she assumed Trevor had already seen it and placed it in a nearby drawer.  
…  
Right after getting off the plane, Celeste went home and began packing her belongings. She had accumulated quite a few things in the house since she'd been living there for six years, after all. But she only took a few sets of clothes, two sets of daily necessities, and some books that were related to her field of study back in college.  
After their marriage, Trevor had been depositing money for her and Jordyn into two separate accounts every month. One account was hers, and the other was Jordyn's.  
However, Celeste was used to spending her own money only. She had never touched the money in Jordyn's account. Because she loved Trevor, whenever she went shopping and saw clothes, shoes, cufflinks, or ties that suited him, she couldn't help but buy them.  
In contrast, she didn't have many expenses on a daily basis because all she did was go to work. Her heart and mind were always focused on Trevor and Jordyn. She wanted to give them the best of everything.  
Most of the money Trevor deposited into her bank account was spent on him and Jordyn.  
Given this spending pattern, there shouldn't have been much money left in Celeste's account. But over the past year, her opportunities to buy things for Trevor and Jordyn had decreased significantly because they were in Andostan.  
Now, there were over three million dollars in her account. That amount might not matter to Trevor, but to her, it was no small sum. And since it was her money, Celeste didn't hesitate to transfer it out.  
She left both cards behind, dragged her suitcase out the door, and didn't look back.  
Celeste had an apartment near her workplace, which was a little over 1,100 square feet. She'd bought it four years ago to support a friend who had been struggling to meet their sales targets. She had never lived there before.  
Now, the apartment came in handy. She had it cleaned regularly, so it wasn't dirty. After a quick tidy-up, it was ready to move in.  
After a long day, Celeste washed up and went to bed around 10:00 pm.  
…  
The shrill sound of an alarm jolted Celeste awake. Startled, her mind went blank for a moment.  
When she came to her senses, she realized that while it was 1:00 am here, it was 7:00 am in Andostan, where Trevor and Jordyn were. This was their usual breakfast time.  
Ever since Jordyn had gone to live with Trevor in Andostan, Celeste had developed the habit of calling her at this time every day. As she was always exhausted from work and was used to going to bed early, she had set this alarm to ensure she wouldn't miss the call.  
At first, Jordyn hadn't adapted well to living in Andostan and had missed her terribly. She had called Celeste constantly. But as time went on, the calls that used to be full of yearning and dependence had grown perfunctory and impatient.  
The alarm was no longer necessary. She just hadn't been able to let go.  
Smiling bitterly, Celeste deleted the alarm and turned off her phone before going back to sleep.  
…  
Meanwhile, Trevor and Jordyn were nearly done with breakfast. Though he knew Celeste usually called Jordyn at this time, he wasn't always home and hadn't paid much attention to the routine.  
He noticed that Celeste hadn't called that day. The fact registered in his mind, but he didn't care. After finishing breakfast, he went upstairs to change.  
Jordyn, finding Celeste increasingly annoying, had grown less fond of their calls. Upon realizing that Celeste hadn't called yet, she figured something must have come up.  
She grabbed her backpack and bolted for the door.  
Hannah hurried after her. ""Ms. Fleming, it's still early. There's no rush!""  
Jordyn ignored her and ran to the car happily. She was thrilled that Celeste hadn't called on time that day. If she stayed home, she might still have to talk to Celeste later. Well, she didn't want that!  
…  
After getting married to Trevor, Celeste had joined Fleming Group for his sake. Now that she was planning to divorce him, she saw no reason to stay.  
The next morning, Celeste handed her resignation letter to Zeke Jackson after arriving at the office.  
Zeke was one of Trevor's personal secretaries. When he saw Celeste's resignation letter, he was extremely surprised.  
He was one of the few in the company who knew about the relationship between Celeste and Trevor.  
Anyone familiar with Trevor knew that he didn't love Celeste. So, he had been cold to her and rarely went home after their marriage.  
To get closer to and win over Trevor, Celeste had chosen to work at Fleming Group.  
Her initial goal was to become his personal secretary, but Trevor refused vehemently. Even when Arnold stepped in, he couldn't get Trevor to agree. In the end, Celeste had to settle for a position in the secretarial team, becoming one of Trevor's many ordinary secretaries.  
At first, Zeke had worried that Celeste's presence in the secretarial team would create chaos. But to his surprise, she didn't bring them any trouble. Although Celeste used her position to get closer to Trevor, she was mindful of her timing and never overstepped her boundaries.  
On the contrary, she worked diligently and performed exceptionally well, hoping to gain Trevor's respect. Whether during her pregnancy, childbirth, or any other time, she strictly adhered to company policies and never sought special treatment.  
Over the years, Celeste rose to become the head of the secretarial team. Zeke had observed her feelings for Trevor from the sidelines all the while. To be honest, he had never imagined she would resign one day. He felt skeptical about her willingly giving up her position.  
Something must have happened between Celeste and Trevor for her to resign now. Zeke understood that this was something he wasn't privy to—it must be something significant enough for Trevor to have ordered her to resign.  
While he found it a pity, Zeke maintained a professional tone. ""I acknowledge that I've received your resignation letter. I'll arrange for someone to take over your duties as soon as possible.""  
""Alright."" Celeste nodded and returned to her workstation.  
After working for a while, Zeke started an online meeting with Trevor to report on company matters. As the conversation neared its end, he suddenly remembered Celeste's resignation.  
""Oh, Mr. Fleming, there's one more thing—""  
Although Zeke had told Celeste he would quickly arrange for someone to take over her position, he wanted to gauge Trevor's thoughts on the matter first. If Trevor wanted Celeste out immediately, he would make the arrangements right away.  
But as the words left his mouth, he remembered that when Celeste first joined the company, Trevor had explicitly stated that all matters regarding her employment should be handled per company regulations. He made it clear that there was no need to report anything to him since he wouldn't concern himself with her.  
And indeed, over the years, Trevor had never actively inquired about Celeste's work at the company.  
Even when he encountered her at work, he treated her like she was a complete stranger.  
When Celeste was set to be promoted a couple of years ago, the team had hesitated. Everyone was aware of Trevor's dislike for her. They had even brought it up with him to gauge his opinion back then.  
Trevor had frowned in annoyance and reiterated that he wouldn't interfere and that they should handle it according to company policy. He had emphasized that they shouldn't bring up Celeste's matters with him again.  
Seeing Zeke's hesitation, Trevor frowned. ""What is it?""  
Zeke snapped out of his thoughts and quickly replied, ""Oh, it's nothing.""  
Since Trevor was already aware of Celeste's resignation but hadn't brought it up, it was clear that this matter wasn't important to him. So, Zeke decided to proceed as usual and handle the matter according to company regulations.  
With that resolved, Trevor ended the call.  
…  
""What are you thinking about?"" At noon, a colleague patted Celeste on the shoulder.  
Celeste came back to her senses and smiled, shaking her head. ""Nothing.""  
""Don't you need to call your daughter today?""  
""No, not today.""  
Typically, she called Jordyn twice a day—once at 1:00 am and once at around 12:00 pm.  
Her colleagues at work were aware of this habit. What they didn't know was her daughter was the child she had with the company's CEO.  
After work, Celeste went to the supermarket. She bought some groceries and a few potted plants before heading home.  
After dinner, she browsed online for information about the upcoming technology exhibition.  
After that, she made a call. ""Please reserve a ticket for next month's tech exhibition for me.""  
""Are you sure?"" the person on the other end replied coolly. ""The last two times you asked me to reserve tickets, you didn't show up. Do you know how many people's lifelong dream is to get one of those tickets? You wasted them thoughtlessly.""  
The annual tech exhibition was a major event in the industry, and tickets were not easily obtainable.  
Their company had a limited number of slots, and many IT elites working for them eagerly vied for the opportunity to attend it.  
""If I don't show up to the exhibition this time, I will never ask you to reserve a ticket for me ever again,"" Celeste promised.  
There was silence on the other end before the line disconnected.  
Celeste knew that he'd agreed. The corners of her mouth tugged upward into a smile. What she hadn't said was that she wanted to return to the company.  
Though she was one of the partners of her tech firm, she had stepped back during its early days to focus on marriage and family. Her decision had disrupted their development plans and cost them many opportunities.  
Her colleagues had been both angry and frustrated with her. Over the years, they had rarely been in contact.  
While Celeste was eager to return, she knew she had been out of the industry for too long. If she went back unprepared, she was worried she wouldn't be able to keep up with the company's current pace.  
So, she planned to spend some time familiarizing herself with the industry's latest developments before making a concrete decision.  
For the next few days, Celeste focused on her work during office hours and spent her evenings tending to her own matters. She didn't reach out to Jordyn or Trevor, and they didn't contact her either.  
Celeste wasn't surprised. For over half a year, her communication with them had been one-sided. They had only passively responded to her efforts.  
…  
Meanwhile, in Andostan, Jordyn had developed the habit of calling Wynn first thing every morning.  
That day, she called Wynn right after waking up as usual. However, the call didn't last long before she burst into tears.  
Wynn had told her some bad news. ""I'm going back to the country soon.""  
Devastated, Jordyn finished the call and immediately phoned Trevor. ""Dad, did you know about this?""  
At his office, Trevor flipped through some documents. ""Yes.""  
""When did you find out?""  
""It's been a while.""  
""Dad, you're so mean…"" Jordyn hugged her pink stuffed pig and cried loudly. ""I don't want Wynn to leave. If she's not here, I don't want to go to school here anymore. I want to go back too!""  
Trevor's tone remained even. ""It's already being arranged.""  
Jordyn didn't understand. ""W-What do you mean?""  
""We're going back next week.""  
Jordyn jumped out of bed in excitement. ""Really?""  
""Yes, really,"" Trevor replied.  
""Then why didn't Wynn tell me just now?""  
""It was just finalized. She doesn't know yet.""  
Jordyn was ecstatic. ""Dad, let's keep this a secret from Wynn. We'll surprise her when we go back to the country, okay?""  
""Alright.""  
""You're the best, Dad! I love you so much!""  
After hanging up, Jordyn was still overjoyed. She sang and danced on her bed.  
After a while, she suddenly thought of Celeste. For the past few days, she had been in a great mood because Celeste hadn't called her. In fact, to avoid talking to Celeste, she had deliberately left home early and even turned off her phone or kept it far away from her after school.  
But after two days, she was worried that Celeste might get angry if she found out. So, she stopped doing that. To her surprise, Celeste hadn't called at all in the days that followed.  
At first, she thought Celeste had discovered that she was deliberately avoiding her calls. But then she remembered that based on past experiences, that wasn't very likely. If Celeste knew she had done something wrong, she would immediately ask Jordyn to correct her wrongdoing instead of sulking and not calling.  
After all, she was the most important person to Celeste. Jordyn knew that Celeste loved her the most, so she didn't think that Celeste would purposely refrain from calling her simply because she was upset.  
As Jordyn thought about this, she suddenly missed Celeste. It was the first time in days she had thought about Celeste, and she couldn't resist dialing Celeste's number.  
But just as the call connected, she remembered that while she would get to see Wynn after returning to the country, Celeste would undoubtedly try every possible way to prevent her from meeting Wynn. She wouldn't be able to see Wynn whenever she wanted like she could now.  
This thought dampened Jordyn's mood.  
It was midnight in Celeste's time zone. She was already asleep when she was woken by the call. Upon seeing Jordyn's name on the screen, she was about to answer when the call abruptly disconnected.  
Although Celeste had written in her divorce agreement that she would relinquish custody of Jordyn, she still felt a sense of responsibility as her mother. Worried that something might have happened, Celeste immediately called back.  
When Jordyn saw the incoming call, she turned her head away and refused to answer.  
Celeste became more concerned and quickly called the landline at the villa.  
Hannah answered promptly. After hearing Celeste's concerns, she reassured her, ""Ms. Fleming should be fine. She went to bed late last night and woke up late today. When I checked earlier, she was still asleep. I'll go upstairs to take a look and call you back.""  
Feeling relieved, Celeste replied, ""Thank you.""  
When Hannah went upstairs, Jordyn was already in the bathroom brushing her teeth.  
After Hannah relayed Celeste being worried about her, Jordyn lowered her head and lied, ""I accidentally hit the call button.""  
Hannah believed her and didn't doubt what she said. Seeing that Jordyn was still brushing her teeth, she went back downstairs to update Celeste that Jordyn was fine.  
Jordyn watched as Hannah left. She huffed and finally felt a bit better.  
After hearing Hannah's reassurance, Celeste felt relieved too. Still, having been abruptly woken, she struggled to fall back asleep. She wasn't in great shape the next morning at work.  
The envelope containing the divorce agreement was completely forgotten by Trevor after the phone call with Wynn.  
On the day they returned to the country, Trevor packed the last document into his briefcase and ensured that nothing was left behind before heading downstairs.  
""All set. Let's go.""  
The Lincoln stretch limousine departed from the villa and headed to the airport.  
…  
That night, at around 10:00 pm, the plane carrying Trevor and Jordyn landed on time. By the time they got home, it was nearly midnight.  
Jordyn had fallen asleep before they arrived. When Trevor carried her upstairs, he passed the master bedroom and noticed the door was open, but the room was pitch black.  
After putting Jordyn on her bed and tucking her in, he returned to the master bedroom and turned on the light. Then, he glanced at the bed and found that it was empty—Celeste wasn't there.  
Just then, the butler, Peter Hawk, came upstairs with his luggage.  
Loosening his tie, Trevor asked, ""Where is she?""  
Peter replied, ""Mrs. Fleming is on a business trip.""  
Half a month ago, Peter hadn't been around when Celeste had left with her suitcase. The other maids told him that Celeste left with a suitcase, so he had assumed she was traveling for work.  
Now that he thought about it, this was unusual. Celeste rarely went on business trips. Even when she did, they typically lasted only two or three days.  
This time, she had been gone for over two weeks.  
""Alright,"" Trevor responded indifferently, asking no further questions.  
...  
The next day, Celeste unexpectedly ran into Trevor at the company. She hadn't known that Trevor and Jordyn had returned to the country. Caught off guard by their sudden encounter, Celeste froze mid-step.  
Trevor also seemed slightly surprised to see her, but he assumed she had just returned from the business trip and didn't think much of it.  
He passed by her coldly, his face expressionless. As usual, he treated her like she was a stranger and turned to enter the building.  
In the past, if Celeste had found out that he'd suddenly come back, she would have been overjoyed. Even if she couldn't throw herself into his arms in such a scenario, she would have been very happy and excited. Her eyes would light up as she greeted him.  
Even if Trevor remained indifferent, she would have smiled and wished him good morning enthusiastically.  
But now, Celeste merely glanced at his handsome face before lowering her eyes. There was no longer any trace of the joy and excitement she once felt.  
Trevor didn't notice any of this and was already walking away.  
Watching his tall and composed figure disappear into the building, Celeste wondered when he had returned. Since he was back, perhaps the matter of their divorce could soon be addressed.  
Having resolved to go through with the divorce, Celeste didn't dwell on him further. After she returned to her workstation, she quickly immersed herself in her work.  
Half an hour later, Zeke called her and instructed her to do something. ""Prepare two cups of coffee and take them to Mr. Fleming's office.""  
In the early days of her marriage, Celeste had learned that Trevor enjoyed coffee. In hopes of winning his favor, she had spent a great deal of effort studying how to brew it perfectly. Her efforts had paid off. After tasting her coffee, Trevor began to specifically request it, both at home and at the office.  
When she first realized he genuinely liked the coffee she made, Celeste had been thrilled. She naively believed it was the first step toward gaining his approval.  
But she had underestimated his dislike and wariness of her. While he liked her coffee, that was all he liked. His attitude toward her remained cold and distant.  
Even when he wanted her coffee, he would have Zeke reach out to her. Once the coffee was prepared, someone else would pick it up for him. He never gave her the opportunity to approach him herself.  
Only on rare occasions when no one else was available did she get the chance to deliver it to his office personally.  
This time, it seemed she was to take the coffee directly to Trevor herself from Zeke's tone. After brewing the coffee, Celeste placed the cups on a tray and carried them to his office.  
The door to his office was ajar.  
As she approached and was about to knock on the door politely, she saw Wynn sitting on Trevor's lap. The two of them seemed to be locked in a passionate kiss.  
Celeste stopped in her tracks, her face turning pale.  
Upon seeing her, Wynn shot up from Trevor's lap, looking flustered.  
Trevor's expression darkened, and he questioned in an icy tone, ""Who allowed you to come in?""",1,1753690745.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False
1mbajpk,https://i.redd.it/wzwg4qfxqkff1.jpeg,meet jonathyn,"this right here is my only OC, named after myself and modeled pretty much entirely after myself (i’m quite unimaginative) the only parts of her that are different from me irl are the lore and age (her being 23 me being 15 :P)

i’ll probably repost this with her redesign when i eventually draw the redesign just fyi

to sum her up she’s a judgmental, antisocial, socially anxious/awkward, tired, coffee addicted, lesbian bottom

her lore is that she’s a half succubus half angel raised in texas (she doesn’t know about the half angel part but has her suspicions) who was appointed the judge/high prosecutor of hell who is known as judgement by other demons (fun fact: i called her that before i got into the helltaker fandom, when i actually played helltaker i laughed my ass off because it also has a character named judgement who is the high prosecutor of hell). she doesn’t actually do a lot of, well *prosecuting* she may be judge, jury, and executioner of hell but satan was like “hey i know you’re the judge and all, but a lot of lesser demons have been getting to the mortal realm. and since you were raised up there you’re best suited for the job of rounding them up” so yeah, right now she’s border patrol for hell. she also suppresses her horns and tail currently (gonna change that in the redesign) she can’t suppress her wings though because they’re technically angelic in nature and the magic she’s using is demonic suppression

if you recognize her than it’s probably because i am quite active in r/OriginalCharacter_RP (i’m still debating whether or not to make her interactions with other characters there canon or not)

she is quite strong of course, i’m not getting into it because this is already really long, but anyway yeah that’s her. my only OC

feel free to ask questions about her or if you want i can answer questions *as* her, the answers won’t look very different though",6,1753690735.0,OriginalCharacter,8,1.0,False
1mbajj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1mbajj6/his_celebrity_mistresss_downfall/,His Celebrity Mistress's Downfall,"I gave up my twenty-billion-dollar inheritance and cut ties with my family, all for my boyfriend of five years, Ignatz.

But just as I was about to tell him I was pr\*\*nant with our child, he dropped a bombshell.

He needed me to take the fall for his childhood sweetheart, Everleigh. She'd been in a hit-and-run, and her career couldn't handle the scandal.

When I refused and told him about our baby, his face went cold. He told me to terminate the pr\*\*nancy immediately.

""Everleigh is the woman I love,"" he said. ""Finding out you're pr\*\*nant with my child would destroy her.""

He had his assistant schedule the appointment and sent me to the clinic alone. There, the nurse told me the procedure carried a high risk of permanent infertility.

He knew. And he still sent me.

I walked out of that clinic, choosing to keep my child. At that exact moment, a news alert lit up my phone. It was a glowing article announcing that Ignatz and Everleigh were expecting their first child, complete with a photo of his hand resting protectively on her stomach.

My world shattered. Wiping away a tear, I found the number I hadn't called in five years.

""Dad,"" I whispered, my voice breaking. ""I'm ready to come home.""

Chapter 1  
""What did you just say?""

The question hung in the air of our minimalist apartment, the one I had designed. My voice was barely a wh\*\*per.

Ignatz Turner, my boyfriend of five years, didn't even look up from his phone. He just repeated it, calm and matter-of-fact.

""I said Everleigh needs you to take the blame. It was a hit-and-run, Gen. A minor one, nobody was seriously hurt, but her career can't handle a scandal right now.""

I stared at him, at the handsome face I had loved for so long. Now, it looked like a stranger's.

""You want me to say I was driving her car? That I hit someone and fled the scene?""

""It makes sense,"" he said, finally lifting his eyes. They were cool, rational. ""You're a private person, an architect. You don't have a public image to protect. You can handle the heat. Everleigh... she's fragile.""

My hands started to shake. ""Fragile? Ignatz, she broke the law. What about my record? My career?""

""It won't affect your career,"" he said, waving a dismissive hand. ""Our lawyers will handle it. A fine, maybe some community service. It's nothing.""

I felt a cold anger rise in my ch\*\*t. ""Nothing? Ignatz, do you have any idea what you're asking? I left my family for you. I gave up my name, my inheritance, everything, so we could have a normal life away from their influence. I did that for you.""

""And I appreciate that, Gen, I really do,"" he said, his voice softening. He stood up and came toward me, trying to take my hands. ""That's why I know you're strong enough to do this one more thing for us. For me.""

He was close now, his familiar scent filling my senses. It used to comfort me. Now it made me sick.

""There's something else,"" I said, my voice trembling as I backed away from his touch.

He stopped, a flicker of annoyance crossing his face. ""What now?""

""I'm pr\*\*nant.""

The words came out, quiet but heavy. I had just found out this morning. I had been planning a romantic dinner to tell him, to celebrate.

Ignatz froze. His charming expression vanished, replaced by a look I had never seen before-a cold, hard panic.

""No,"" he said.

""Yes. I took a test. I'm six weeks along.""

He ran a hand through his perfectly styled hair, pacing the room. ""This is a disaster. An absolute disaster.""

I laughed, a broken, hollow sound. Tears I didn't know were there started streaming down my face. ""A disaster? It's your baby, Ignatz.""

""Everleigh can't handle this right now!"" he snapped, turning on me. ""The stress of the accident, her anxiety... finding out you're pr\*\*nant with my child would destroy her. She's not strong like you, Gen. She needs my full support.""

""So I'm the one who gets sacrificed? Again?"" The words were squeezed out from between my teeth. ""My life, my reputation, and now... our baby?""

He stopped pacing and looked at me, his eyes now holding a chilling sort of pity. ""We can't have this baby. Not now.""

My world tilted. The floor felt like it was dropping out from under me. ""What are you saying?""

""I'm saying you need to terminate it,"" he said, his voice dropping to a low, persuasive tone. ""It's for the best. For everyone. Once this all blows over with Everleigh, we can try again. It's just... bad timing.""

The air left my lungs. He was talking about our child like it was an inconvenient appointment to be rescheduled.

""It's your child, Ignatz,"" I whispered, my voice hoarse. ""Your bl\*\*d.""

""And Everleigh is the woman I love!"" he yelled, his composure finally cracking. ""She's sensitive! This would break her! Can't you understand that?""

I just stared at him, my mind a blank wall of pain. After a long, silent moment, a sad, twisted smile formed on my lips.

""Okay,"" I said. ""Okay, Ignatz.""

Relief washed over his face. He didn't see the emptiness behind my eyes.

Just then, his phone rang, a cheerful pop song I recognized as one of Everleigh's hits. He answered it immediately.

""Leigh? Hey, baby, what's wrong? Don't cry, I'm on my way. I'm coming right now.""

His voice was a gentle, loving ca\*\*ss. A voice he hadn't used with me in years.

He hung up and grabbed his keys, not even glancing at me as he rushed to the door.

""I'll have my assistant schedule the appointment for you,"" he said over his shoulder. ""Just do it quickly.""

Then he was gone. The door clicked shut, leaving me in a silence that was louder than his shouting.

The next day, I was at the clinic. The air smelled of antiseptic and quiet despair. The nurse who took my information looked at me with pity in her eyes. It made my skin crawl.

She handed me a clipboard with a consent form. His signature was already there at the bottom: Ignatz Turner. He had signed it this morning, before he even knew if I'd agree. He was so sure of me.

""The doctor wants you to know,"" the nurse said softly, avoiding my gaze, ""that due to a minor complication, this procedure carries a high risk of future infertility. There's a chance you might not be able to conceive again.""

The clipboard slipped from my numb fingers and clattered to the floor.

He knew. He must have known. The doctor would have told his assistant, and his assistant would have told him. He knew this could leave me barren, and he still signed the form. He still sent me here to erase our child and my future.

I bit down on my lip, hard. The coppery taste of bl\*\*d filled my mouth, but I felt nothing. Just a vast, cold emptiness.

I was ready to go through with it. To just get it over with, to cut out the last piece of him inside me. I stood up to follow the nurse.

And then I felt it.

A tiny, unmistakable flutter deep in my womb. It was too early for a real kick, the doctor had said. But I felt it. A flicker of life, a silent protest.

Don't let me go.

""No,"" I said, my voice loud and clear in the quiet room.

The nurse turned, surprised.

""I'm not doing it,"" I said, pulling my arm away. ""I'm keeping my baby.""

I walked out of that clinic, leaving the consent form on the floor. The afternoon sun was blindingly bright, and for a moment, I felt a surge of strength. I had my baby. That's all that mattered.

Then I pulled out my phone. The screen lit up with a breaking news alert from a celebrity gossip site.

The headline was a punch to the gut: ""Everleigh Hooper and Boyfriend Ignatz Turner Expecting First Child! Sources say Hooper is overjoyed after a recent health scare.""

The article was filled with pictures of them from last night, leaving a fancy restaurant. Ignatz was holding her, his hand placed protectively on her flat stomach. They were both smiling, glowing for the cameras.

Below the article, the comments section was a sewer.

""Who is that Genevieve Ball person? The one who did the hit-and-run in Everleigh's car? Probably some obsessed fan Ignatz felt sorry for.""

""I heard she's been stalking him for years. Good thing he's finally with someone on his level.""

""She looks so plain. Of course he chose a star like Everleigh. And now they're starting a family! So happy for them!""

I bit my lip again, harder this time. I felt the skin break, the warm trickle of bl\*\*d down my chin. But I still couldn't feel the pain. I was completely numb.

I looked down at my own stomach, and a single tear rolled down my cheek and fell onto my hand.

""It's okay,"" I whispered to the tiny life inside me. ""I'll protect you. I promise.""

I wiped my face, my expression hardening. I opened my contacts and found my lawyer's number.

""I need you to draw up divorce papers,"" I said, my voice steady and cold. ""And I want everything I'm entitled to.""

Chapter 2  
When I got back to the apartment, the front door was slightly ajar. A knot of dread tightened in my stomach. I pushed it open slowly.

The sound of soft laughter drifted from the living room.

There, on the custom-made sofa I had picked out, sat Everleigh Hooper. Ignatz was sitting on the coffee table in front of her, feeding her a strawberry. She giggled and leaned forward to k\*\*s him.

It was a perfectly staged, in\*\*mate moment. And I had just walked in on it.

Ignatz saw me first. His smile faltered for a second, his eyes hardening. ""Gen.""

Everleigh looked over, her big, innocent eyes widening. She immediately shrank back against the cushions, making herself look small and scared.

""Gen, can you give us a minute?"" Ignatz said, keeping his voice low, as if I were an intruder. ""Everleigh isn't feeling well. I'll come to the guest room later.""

I let out a short, sharp laugh. ""The guest room? Ignatz, this is my apartment. My name is on the lease. If anyone should leave, it's her.""

He stood up, his expression turning pleading. ""Please, just for tonight. You know how she is. We grew up together, I've always taken care of her. She needs me right now.""

He was trying to appeal to the part of me that had always made excuses for him, for their ""special"" bond.

""I'll get her a hotel tomorrow, I promise,"" he said, his voice a low murmur. ""We'll sort this out.""

I didn't say another word. I just turned and walked to the spare bedroom, closing the door behind me.

I couldn't block out the sounds. A few minutes later, I heard their laughter again, louder this time, mixed with the sound of the TV. They were settling in for the night. In my home.

I curled up on the bed, not bothering to change. The tears I had held back all day finally came, soaking the pillow in the dark.

Much later, I heard the bedroom door creak open. A shadow fell across the bed.

""Gen? Are you awake?"" It was Ignatz, his voice a guilty wh\*\*per.

He sat on the edge of the bed, his weight making the mattress dip. He reached out and touched my hair.

""I'm sorry about today,"" he said, his voice thick. ""It's just a lot to deal with. The baby... we'll have another one, Gen. When the time is right, I swear.""

I lay perfectly still, my body rigid. He didn't know. He thought I had gone through with it. He was apologizing for the inconvenience, not the monstrous thing he had asked of me. The irony was a bitter pill in my throat.

Suddenly, a sharp scream came from the living room. ""Iggy! Iggy, where are you?""

Ignatz shot up from the bed as if he'd been electrocuted. ""Leigh?""

""I had a nightmare!"" she wailed. ""Come back!""

Without a second thought, without another glance at me, he bolted from the room. ""I'm coming, Leigh! I'm here!""

For the rest of the night, the sound of his low, soothing voice drifted down the hallway as he comforted her, leaving me alone in the dark.

The next morning, I dragged my exhausted body out of bed. The smell of coffee and bacon filled the air. For a delusional second, it felt like any other morning.

Then I walked into the kitchen.

Ignatz was at the stove, flipping pancakes. Everleigh was perched on a stool, wearing one of his expensive silk shirts, her bare legs dangling. She was laughing as he playfully dabbed a bit of whipped cream on her nose.

They looked like a happy couple in a coffee commercial. I was the ghost haunting the set.

Everleigh saw me and her bright smile vanished. She instantly adopted her frightened-doe look, clutching Ignatz's arm. ""Oh. Genevieve. You're up.""

""Iggy,"" she whispered, loud enough for me to hear. ""I want orange juice. Freshly squeezed.""

""Of course, Leigh. Anything you want,"" Ignatz said, turning to the fridge without a single glance in my direction.

The moment he was busy with the juicer, Everleigh's entire demeanor changed. The fear melted away, replaced by a smug, triumphant smirk. She looked directly at me.

""He was so disappointed when he thought you were pr\*\*nant,"" she said, her voice a syrupy poison. ""He told me he never wanted kids with you. He said the thought of it made his skin crawl.""

I froze, my hand on the counter. My head snapped up to look at her. My fingers trembled.

""You think you can win?"" she continued, her voice dripping with contempt. ""I'm Everleigh Hooper. My uncle is one of the most powerful producers in Hollywood. Who are you? A no-name architect he picked up out of pity.""

My bl\*\*d ran cold. I knew her uncle was influential. I hadn't realized how much. That's why Ignatz was so desperate to protect her. It wasn't just love; it was ambition. She was his ticket to a world he craved.

Suddenly, Everleigh let out a sharp cry and slid off the stool, collapsing onto the floor. ""Ahh! My ankle!"" she shrieked, clutching it. ""Genevieve, why did you push me?""

Ignatz spun around, his face a mask of fury. He saw me standing near her, saw her on the floor, and didn't hesitate. He lunged forward and shoved me, hard.

""What the h\*\*l is wrong with you?"" he roared.

I stumbled backward, my hip slamming into the corner of the kitchen island. A sharp, searing pain shot through my side. I gasped, clutching the spot.

He didn't even notice. He was already on the floor, cradling Everleigh in his arms. ""Are you okay, Leigh? Did she hurt you?""

He looked up at me, his eyes filled with a cold, terrifying hatred. ""She's fragile, you id\*\*t! I told you that!""

""I... I didn't touch her,"" I stammered, the pain making my voice shake.

""Get out of my sight,"" he snarled, his voice low and dangerous. ""Don't you ever touch her again. I'm warning you, Genevieve.""

He scooped Everleigh up into his arms and carried her out of the kitchen, leaving me standing there, trembling with pain and shock.

My hand went instinctively to my stomach, a silent prayer that the baby was okay.

This was my home. And I had just been declared the enemy.

Chapter 3  
Ignatz didn't come back for two days. I spent the time in a daze, moving through the silent apartment like a zombie. I took down our pictures, packing his clothes into boxes. I even took off my wedding ring. It slid off my finger with no resistance. I had lost so much weight, I hadn't even noticed.

I dropped it into the tr\*\*h can. It made a dull, final thud.

Then, a text message from him lit up my phone.

Can you do me a favor? There's a blue velvet box in my top drawer. A courier is coming to pick it up in an hour. Have it ready for him.

I went to his drawer. Inside was a small, elegant box from a famous jewelry designer. I opened it. Nestled on the black velvet was a diamond necklace, the kind of ostentatious piece I would never wear. I remembered him showing it to me online months ago.

""Isn't it beautiful?"" he'd said. ""I'm going to buy it for the most important person in my life.""

I had thought he meant me.

Staring at the necklace, a bitter laugh escaped my lips. I closed the box.

When the courier arrived, a young man in a crisp uniform, I handed him the package without a word.

""Ma'am, the destination is the St. Regis Hotel,"" he said, confirming the details.

""I know,"" I said, pulling my purse from the hook by the door. I took out the folded divorce agreement. ""I'm going with you.""

The car ride was silent. The St. Regis was hosting a massive press conference for Everleigh's new movie. As we pulled up, I could hear the roar of the crowd and the frantic clicking of cameras.

I walked into the ballroom. The noise died down instantly. Every head turned. Every camera swiveled to face me. I was wearing a simple dress and no makeup. My hair was pulled back in a messy bun.

Whispers erupted around me.

""Is that her? The stalker?""

""What is she doing here? Look at how she's dressed. No class.""

I ignored them all. My eyes were fixed on the stage at the front of the room, where Ignatz and Everleigh were standing, holding hands.

Ignatz saw me, and his face tightened into a knot of anger. ""Genevieve? What the h\*\*l are you doing here?"" he hissed as I approached.

I didn't answer. I just held out the blue velvet box.

""You forgot this,"" I said, my voice surprisingly steady.

Everleigh snatched the box from my hand and opened it with a g\*\*p of delight. ""Oh, Iggy! It's beautiful!""

She turned to him, pouting. ""Put it on me. Right now.""

Ignatz hesitated for a fraction of a second, his eyes darting between me and her. Then, his face hardened, and he took the necklace. His fingers brushed against her skin as he fastened the clasp.

Everleigh leaned in and ki\*\*ed him full on the lips, her eyes locked on me the entire time. It was a declaration of victory.

I stood there, silent.

Then, she did it again. She let out a tiny g\*\*p and staggered, pretending to lose her balance. ""Oh!""

""Gen, I warned you!"" Ignatz roared, lunging forward to steady Everleigh. He glared at me, his face contorted with rage. ""Are you trying to hurt her?""

I said nothing. I just held out the divorce agreement I had been clutching in my hand.

He barely glanced at it. Everleigh suddenly clutched her stomach. ""Iggy, I don't feel well. My stomach hurts.""

""What?"" His attention snapped back to her, all thoughts of me and the papers gone. ""Okay, baby, okay. Let's get you to the hospital.""

""The papers, Iggy,"" I said, holding them out again. ""Sign them.""

""Just sign it so she'll leave!"" Everleigh mo\*\*ed, pressing herself against him.

Without even reading it, he snatched a pen from a nearby table, scribbled his name on the line, and shoved the document back at me.

Then he swept Everleigh into his arms and started pushing his way through the crowd of reporters. ""Let us through! It's an emergency!""

I clutched the signed papers to my ch\*\*t and turned to leave. As I walked away, someone deliberately stuck out a foot.

I went down, hard.

My head hit the marble floor with a sickening crack. The world exploded in a flash of white-hot pain.

I heard gasps from the crowd. Through a haze of pain, I saw Ignatz stop and look back. He took a half-step toward me, his face a mess of confusion.

""Iggy, let's go!"" Everleigh whined, tugging on his arm. ""She's just faking it for attention.""

He looked from me, lying on the floor with bl\*\*d starting to pool around my head, to her. He hesitated for one more second.

Then he turned and left, disappearing into the flashing lights of the paparazzi.

I lay there, the polished floor cold against my cheek. My vision was blurring. People were staring, whispering, pointing. No one moved to help.

With a gr\*\*n, I pushed myself up. My head was spinning. I realized my wedding ring was gone. It must have flown off when I fell. The ring that had been so loose on my finger. A symbol of a marriage that had been hollow for a long, long time.

I didn't even look for it.

Ignoring the stares and the cameras, I stumbled to my feet, my legs shaking. I walked, one foot in front of the other, out of the ballroom and into the street.

I flagged down a taxi. The driver's eyes went wide when he saw the bl\*\*d on my face.

""Hospital?"" he asked, his voice full of alarm.

I wiped a smear of bl\*\*d from my cheek with the back of my hand.

""Yeah,"" I said, a grim smile touching my lips. ""But I'm not gonna die.""

Chapter 4  
The emergency room doctor was gentle as she stitched the gash on my forehead. ""You need to be more careful,"" she said, her brow furrowed with concern. ""A fall like that could have been much worse, especially..."" She trailed off, glancing at my chart.

Before she could finish, the TV in the corner of the waiting area, which had been murmuring quietly, suddenly blared to life with a ""Breaking News"" graphic.

My face filled the screen. It was a grainy cell phone video of me on the floor of the ballroom.

""Sources inside the St. Regis claim Genevieve Ball, ex-girlfriend of mogul Ignatz Turner, staged a dramatic fall today in an attempt to win him back,"" the anchor said in a grave voice. ""This comes on the heels of new reports alleging Ms. Ball has a history of erratic behavior and infidelity.""

The world went dark at the edges. I gripped the side of the hospital bed to keep from fainting.

Before I could even process the slander, the door to my curtained-off cubicle was thrown open with a deafening bang.

Meredith Turner, Ignatz's mother, stood there, her face a mask of pure fury.

""You little wh\*\*e!"" she screamed, lunging at me. Her hand connected with my cheek in a vicious slap that sent my head ringing.

Before I could react, two large men, bodyguards I recognized, grabbed my arms. They hauled me off the bed, ignoring the doctor's protests.

""What are you doing? She's my patient!""

""Get out of the way,"" Meredith snarled at her, and they dragged me out of the hospital, my bare feet scraping against the pavement.

They threw me into the back of a black SUV and drove to an old, abandoned warehouse on the industrial outskirts of the city. They dragged me inside and threw me onto the filthy concrete floor.

""Kneel,"" Meredith commanded, her voice echoing in the cavernous space.

I tried to scramble away, but the bodyguards forced me down. My knees hit the cold, hard ground with a painful crack.

Meredith pulled out her phone and dialed. ""Ignatz,"" she said, her voice dripping with venom. ""Your pathetic wife is here, making a scene. She's brought shame on our entire family.""

I could hear Ignatz's panicked voice on the other end of the line. ""Mom, what did you do? Where are you?""

""Don't you worry about it,"" she sneered. ""I'm just teaching this little tramp the lesson you've been too soft to teach her. You can't be this soft, son. She's been cheating on you, playing you for a fool!""

""Ignatz!"" I screamed, desperate for him to hear me. ""It's not true! I'm pr\*\*nant! She's lying!""

There was a pause on the other end. Then, Ignatz's voice came through, low and defeated. ""Gen... just do what she says. I'll make it up to you later. I promise.""

The line went dead.

Hope died with it.

They left me there, kneeling in the stifling heat of the unventilated warehouse. Sweat and bl\*\*d trickled down my face, dripping onto the dusty floor. Hours passed.

Then, a sudden, sharp cramp seized my abdomen. It was a pain so intense it stole my breath. I looked down. A dark, wet patch was spreading on the thin fabric of my dress.

No. No, no, no.

Panic, raw and primal, clawed at my throat. I scrambled to the massive steel door and banged on it with my fists.

""Help! Please, somebody help me! My baby!""

I could hear Meredith's voice from the other side, cold and dismissive. ""What baby? That little ba\*\*ard? Let it die. It was never welcome in the Turner family anyway.""

""It's Ignatz's baby!"" I shrieked, my voice cracking with desperation. ""It's your grandchild!""

The only answer was the sound of her footsteps walking away, fading into silence.

I was alone.

I spent the night on that cold floor, bleeding in the dark, the pain in my belly a relentless, tearing agony.

When the sun came up, the door finally opened. One of the bodyguards looked down at me, his face impassive. ""Mrs. Turner said we can take you to a hospital now.""

The next thing I knew, I was on an operating table. The lights were too bright, the voices around me were muffled. I felt a profound coldness spreading through me, a sense of something precious being irrevocably lost.

As they wheeled me into a recovery room, my phone, which had been in my purse, buzzed on the bedside table. It was a text from Ignatz.

I'm so sorry, Gen. Mom went too far. But you have to understand her position. This has been so hard on all of us.

A single, hot tear slid from the corner of my eye and traced a path through the grime on my face. My fingers trembled as I picked up the phone.

A few hours later, a lawyer I didn't recognize delivered a crisp, white envelope. Inside was my divorce certificate, officially stamped. It was over.

I scrolled through my contacts, my thumb hovering over a name I hadn't called in five years. A name that represented a life I had thrown away.

I pressed the call button.

It rang twice.

""Well, look who it is,"" a deep, male voice said, laced with a familiar, teasing smile. ""I was beginning to think you'd forgotten all about me.""

""Kaleb,"" I whispered, my voice breaking. ""I need help.""

""I know,"" he said, his tone instantly serious. ""I'm already on my way. Dad's with me. Just hang on, Gen. We're coming to bring you home.""

I've snagged some converse that fit well, and have a couple pairs of Thursday boots that look good but are a little narrow.

I tend to wear jeans, a t-shirt, and an overshirt of some kind, depending on the season. I'm looking for something that's more on the casual side, but also give off a slightly more formal vibe than, say, the converse. I was looking at [these low tops,](https://thursdayboots.com/products/mens-premier-low-top-sneaker-coffee)or [this pair of high tops](https://thursdayboots.com/products/mens-premier-high-top-sneaker-brown-coffee?variant=41912661770330), but I know there are mixed thoughts on the brown leather, white sole combo. But they do come in wide sizes, which is a lifesaver.
