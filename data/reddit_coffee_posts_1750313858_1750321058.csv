So 2 years ago I found out that my boyfriend M 35 and his co-worker F (married at that time) are texting a lot. . Some of the texts were them flirting, they spent all day at work together. But that seems to be not enough, they write each other almost all the time during office hours but also started writing on the weekends, in the evening. While he went to the mountains with his friends, he sent her same pictures he sent to me (not selfies or anything like that) but pics of all of the guys and him there, video from the pub of them singing, pic of dogs in the pub..Innocent things right..But why the need? Why send the same things he sent to me at 11 pm to just a co-worker at the same time? But they were texting about badminton - because they go together during lung break quite a lot and she said that next time she will train with him and he replied, what will we train? and she replied badminton what he meant by that and he said that you can train a lot of things, but that he also meant badminton...This he explained to me, that that was too much and he realized that, but couldn't tell me why he did it, I asked if it was alcohol, why the need. I feel so betrayed that he is texting me and at the same time he is texting his colleague, sending her the same pics..

He also started to call her name in a diminutive form (don't know if that is a correct way to say that). She asked him to join her on a work trip and he said I will go anywhere with you.

I confronted him about all of this, said that this is too much for me, this is flirting and I am not okay with that, I asked him how would he feel if I texted with my coworker like that, if I wrote him while I was away drinking, after office hours.

I told him that I want him to limit the contact with her to only work-related..

He said he loves me, he didn't mean anything by that, he would never act on that, it stops there for him, that he will change the tone, now that he knows that I am not okay with that, he won't engage that.

This was almost 2 years ago.

Well, same situation repeated a few times..I read their conversations and found something everytime..I know it´s bad to look, I feel bad for going through his phone, but my trust was broken...

And at first he tried to limit the messages, but fell right back into it...

In January, I discovered that she was divorcing her husband. Didn´t know what to think of that.

I also read one of their conversations when they were discussing their seating plan. Now they are sitting across from each other and when we were on vacation, she wrote to him that she misses him, that she has no one to kick under the table with her legs. And now they were messaging if it was better for him to sit next to her or stay across from her so he could have contact under the table, to which she replied that she liked both options, but that if he sat next to her she wouldn't have to keep getting up, when she wanted to express everything to him only with one look.

Then they were discussing her vacation this year, that she has lot of vacation days and will be using them (guess it´s needed and good for her because of the divorce) and he wrote that he won´t let her go and then that he will want reports from her - to stay in touch.

Well I read all of this and confronted him again..it´s tiring because it keeps repeating..I honestly don´t know what to do, because he told me it´s just flirting and it means nothing to him and the reason he flirts is because it´s for fun and that he has been doing it for years and it´s hard to stop.

Also he usually doesn´t tell me anything about this colleague, he for example had a day off and just went to work to stop by for a coffee to see her (not her specifically he said, she was there with another coworker) and he did not say this to me. He avoids telling me anything related to her, because I guess he is afraid of my reaction, I called her names, eventhough I don´t even know her personally, but he just made me not like her..In summer he also didn´t tell me he was leaving for a weekend for a run race they both (and more people from work) signed up for and he told me the evening before, eventhough we had plans and were supposed to go to see his parents and he promised to help mine...so many other examples

I told him that what I hate about this it that I told him more than once that this is uncomfortable for me, that it hurts me and I think it´s disrespectful and that I don´t like it and he promised he will stop now he knows I don´t like it. But I heard this before..and it keeps happening..

He tells me he loves me, that he doesn´t have feelings for her, that it´s just stupid flirting that would never lead to anything more. I asked him how would he feel if I was doing same things and he said he wouldn´t mind, which I find a bit too hard to believe. I don´t know what to do, because my trust is broken and I love him, but he keeps disappointing me and it´s tiring...He keeps repeating that it means nothing to him, and I keep repeating to him that I don´t like it and that he should respect that..

Now last month, I discovered something again...this time it was different, because he hid the messages from me, they were archived.. I saw that when he was on a trip with his friends during the weekend, he was texting with her at 2 am in the morning, she sent him a selfie, which he marked with heart hands emoji. She was in different country for a football match with other people, to which I found out, he was the one taking care of booking their tickets to the match (not paying, but making the effort). During the weekend, he constantly made effort to write to her, asking about the match, exchanging pictures, then he proceeded to send her videos with them singing (just the sound, he didn´t tell his friends he was filming, so it was just take on his feet and the sound of them singing) - three pointless videos at 2 am, none of these he sent to me. To this he told me he hid this because he was ashamed..well I´d be too if I were him, if I was told many times by my fiancee that this hurts him...Well that isn´t everything. I went to a fight with him, told him we are over and that I didn´t want to be together anymore. We were both crying a lot, I let him go away on the weekend to his parents. But then I also found out about another lie. In December after their company christmas party, he went to a lunch and he claimed to me he was there with more people, because they needed to discuss some gossips. Well...he was there only with her. Because in the hidden messages, there was also a group chat to which she sent photo of him across the table in the pub. So I confronted him about that and he was cornered and lied, he told me there were other colleagues too, but the pub was full so they sat at other tables...well BS, I felt like a complete idiot, because from the picture it was obvious, it was just them there..he finally admitted that..He didn´t tell me, because he knew my reaction would be bad. But...my reaction is always worse when he is fucking lying about stuff. If it means nothing, why hide it, why not talk about it, why not mention your colleague more at home? I talk about my colleagues (male, females) all the fucking time, I tell him everything, I go with my male coworker for a lunch - I tell him. Because I have nothing to hide, he sends me something funny - I tell my fiancee...Here I can tell they barely talk about me, which I should probably be glad he doesn´t discuss our intimate life, but not even mentioning, setting some boundaries?

It´s a lot..

Well we kind of made up, he seemed to finally realize how much it hurts me..but I still don´t know, I am still not over it, I don´t trust him now, I don´t know if I can trust it won´t happen again after a while...

1lf5eqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1lf5eqv/should_i_bother_reaching_out_to_an_old_exbest/,Should I bother reaching out to an old ex-best friend or is that friendship better left in the past as a memory?,"Sorry in advance for this being long. I (31F) partially just need to get this off my chest and partially want to know if people think it's even worth trying to reach out to my old ex-best friend (31F). I met my childhood best friend, let's call her Stacie, when we were 3 years old. We grew up going to the same small private school and were basically sisters. After freshman year of high school I changed to public school while she stayed at the private one, but we stayed as close as ever, especially once we could drive. 

She ended up coming to my high school's prom as a date of a friend of mine, let's call him Brad, while I went with my then-boyfriend now-husband, let's call him Tim. Stacie and Brad ended up dating through high school graduation (2012) and for a couple years into college. All four of us did freshman year of college at community college. 

When we all went off to the University, Tim and Brad ended up rooming together. Stacie and I didn't live together since I was finishing up a job obligation in a different city before moving there and she moved right as sophomore year started. I ended up with an apartment to myself and she lived with three other roommates, but we both ended up staying at our boyfriends' place a lot. 

By the time I moved down, school had been going for a couple months and Stacie had decided to try and rush into a sorority. Brad didn't want her to and I specifically remember talking to her about it in her car one night because she was torn on what to do. During that conversation she decided she was going to rush, I think mostly because she felt like she missed out in high school going to the small private school (by small I mean each grade having about 20 kids). I was nervous that it would change our relationship but I wasn't going to tell her not to do it for my own selfish reasons. Looking back, her decision that night is what changed everything and I wish I had said more of what I was feeling. 

Once Stacie joined, she was definitely loving it and I was happy for her, but she starting to change. I started to witness her instigating strange arguments with Brad. She became completely ridiculous and unreasonable with him. For example, one night the two of them were going to a party. Stacie wore tall stilettos (against our warnings) and predicably ended up in a lot of pain. Brad literally gave her a piggy back ride home for probably about 2 miles. Then the next morning she was pissed at him for the ""way he carried her"" because she was sore. She was screening at him and stormed out of the apartment and slammed the door. Tim and I heard the whole argument (paper-thin apartment walls) and it was just so bizarre. I started to see a very selfish side of her and she started to party a LOT which wasn't really my thing. I started to get more serious with Tim and we moved in together once our leases were up and Brad and Stacie broke up. 

Stacie and I just kinda drifted apart. She had a ton of friends from her sorority and I felt kinda forgotten about so I focused on my relationship with Tim and school and probably wasn't prioritizing her, as well. We'd still occasionally see each other but it took more effort than ever before. It seemed like she didn't care though. For example, on my 21st birthday we had plans to go to a restaurant and she was over an hour late while the rest of us just waited for her to show up and she didn't apologize or anything. I'd try to grab coffee with her occasionally but she made it hard to plan with her and if we did get together she literally would talk about herself the entire time, I couldn't get a word in, and she didn't care enough to ask me anything. I was really sad but I kept getting more hurt anytime I tried so I started to give up trying. 

My last straw came in 2017. Tim and I got engaged in January and planned our wedding for that September. I had to make the heartbreaking decision to not ask Stacie to be in my wedding party. I had other good friends so that wasn't the problem, it was just sad that she wouldn't be a part of my wedding day the way I'd always imagined growing up. She was always going to be my maid-of-honor but now she was just going to be a guest. We sent out save the dates in February to give people plenty of heads up and we sent out the invites in late spring. Both were sent to her and her family and they all RSVPed (our moms' are best friends and our families grew up together so we invited all of them). Well, about two weeks before the wedding Stacie texted me letting me know that she wasn't going to be able to make it to the wedding. Her excuse was that she didn't know the date of the wedding and that she realized she had to work that day. I was heartbroken. It seemed like a bullshit excuse considering how much notice she'd been given and that if she wanted to be there she could have talked to her boss about it. She'd worked that job for years and was well respected there so I'm confident it wouldn't have been an issue. Also, the wedding was in the area so not inconvenient, and I know it wasn't because she needed the money from that shift. That night I cried a lot, not just because she wasn't going to be there but also because I felt like I was mourning the death a lifelong friendship. I made the decision that night that this was my last straw. Stacie didn't care about me anymore and I couldn't waste anymore of my time hoping that I could get that relationship back. Her whole family came to the wedding but she was not there. 

Tim and I got married, started our careers, bought a house, and just started to move on with our lives. Over two years went by with zero contact to/from Stacie when she randomly reached out to me at the end of 2019. She asked if we could get together to catch up. I was on the fence about it because I really had moved on, but I felt like our ~18 year friendship deserved a second chance. We met up at one of our old regular high school shopping spots. When she saw me she ran up to me for a hug and was crying. I felt really bad that I wasn't crying too, but again I had moved on. We hung out for about 3 hours and it was the strangest 3 hours... She was acting so bizarre and frantically talked the whole time and she couldn't keep a thought path going. I could barely even ask how she was doing or anything cause it was so hard to get a word in. Afterwards when I was talking to Tim about it, I realized it was almost like she was on drugs or something. It's hard to explain how strange it was. I told myself that I tried, it was weird AF, and that I really was done. 

During the 2020 COVID shutdown, she randomly invited me to a couple parties but 1) I was either TTC and/or pregnant which made me more high risk so I had to/wanted to take it all seriously and 2) parties weren't my thing in college so I'm not sure why she thought they would be at 26. I appreciated the thought and effort but I declined both times. I ended up having a miscarriage in the fall of 2020 and she knew it happened but she never reached out which told me she was done trying, too. In 2022 she did reach out asking if I wanted to go to our old private school's 10 year reunion (I graduated from the public high school but I still grew up with all those people and she's was asking me to be her plus one) but I felt really awkward going since I hadn't seen most of those people in over 10 years and the only person from that school I still talk to lives halfway across the country and wouldn't be there, but it was a nice gesture from her and I made sure she knew I was grateful for the thought (I also sorta felt like it would be crashing since I didn't actually graduate from there but I spent 10 years with all of them- it was a weird dilemma). 

That was the last time we communicated. Our moms' are still best friends and they see each other probably every week or every other week. I get the occasional update through my mom but for the most part they avoid talking about both of us since it's just kinda awkward now. I know she's single, a teacher, and just finished getting her masters in teaching. She also has dealt with some serious mental heath issues (which I have too so I understand) but that could account for the weird situation in 2019. Every year I still always send her a Christmas card.

I got pregnant again in 2023 and gave birth to my sweet boy last year. For some reason since having him, Stacie keeps randomly popping up in my head. He turned one recently and I'm starting to feel the heartbreak of the missing friendship again. I'm not sure why. It could be because years ago she would have been ""Aunt Stacie"" and I'm sad my son will never know her. It also could be that since I'm a stay-at-home mom now that I don't have coworkers to talk to and maybe the hole of no coworkers is actually the hole that she left behind that they temporarily filled and now it's open again. I have other good friends who are also all married moms and we talk nearly everyday but two of them ended up in different states so we don't actually get to see each other very often (and two are still local and we make an effort to get together every couple weeks). Stacie is still nearby and maybe that's why I'm partially tempted to try to rekindle something. But maybe what I miss isn't even Stacie, but the friendship we used to have or maybe just the idea of what a friendship with her these days could look like. 

We never had a big fight or anything, it just fizzled out as our lives and priorities drifted apart. Our lives are still pretty different though and I don't know if she'd even respond if I texted her. We still follow each other on social media but she never likes anything I post. She doesn't really post much but I hope she's happy and doing well. I should add that I'm a pretty timid person and reaching out to her would be hard for me. The most I feel confidently comfortable with is sending her the Christmas cards but that's a subtle gesture. At this point it's been a solid 10 years since we were friends. Does anyone have any thoughts or suggestions? Should I reach out or just let it be? Or if anyone might have any insight into how she maybe could have felt on the other side of all this that maybe I missed? Sorry it's so long, I just wanted to paint a clear picture.

Regardless of your religious beliefs, please read and ask yourself how you would feel. 

Ok so Emilie when head first all in very excited in love with the church and had a passion to soaking up all she could.  She followed the churches rules and was devoted. She loved the community that the church gave as well.

She marries Brady believing he was was a devoted as she was. After all he was raised Mormon. And his whole family is Mormon. 

She married him believing he was that.. a Mormon man who she would have a family with and live the Mormon life. 

She went to church every Sunday. She said she started noticing little things that Brady was doing that was against the church. 

Like not wearing his undergarments. He said they were uncomfortable. She went and bought him new ones. 

He would skip church. 

She realized hey he's not that into this

They went to lunch. He ordered coffee. A huge NO NO with the church. She had to make a decision in that moment. Stick by the man she loved, to not divorce like her parents. To stick with her vows to stay with her husband. Or to stay with her church. She even had already weighed how marriages didn't work if one person stayed in the church and the other partner left. 

She chose Brady over her faith

She says all this in the podcast 


Personally I think she made it okay by telling herself she also had doubts in her faith. But those doubts didnt happen until Brady wanted out of the church.

He'd been sneaking around and doing things, like drinking coffee and whatever else 

Sure that seems stupid but its lies he held from her about his lack of faith. The faith he used in order to get her. 

What does he say he loves about her? Her ambition 

The man himself is lazy. Doesn't work. Has no ambition. 

Failed at even watching his own child


Harsh but true. Who leaves a 3 year old to play next to a pool? On more than one occasion even!!! 

I hope she leaves him. She deserves better.

after days spending online and countless research I came to the conclusion that there is no sure shot way to cure this totally, other than lifestyle changes. so i did.... make some change?
• i began practicing pelvic floor relaxation exercises since i am not experiencing any leakage i figured a tight PF might be the case. im not sure tho. 
•i also started doing yoga to help my mind stay in tune with my body? i can't bring myself to meditate altho ive been trying from YEARS. so im just trying to practice yoga mindfully. and... after two weeks do i feel a hint of relief? i do.
• i no longer chug down a 250ml glass of water altogether. I've filled up my bottle and i try to finish that by in taking smaller quantities. has that helped? oh, surely! 
• i haven't had coffee in days, unlike many im not a caffeine addict and i use to have it once in a while so it was that easy to cut it off COMPLETELY.
• after reading so much about bladder retraining from the veterans of this sub who have successfully mitigated their symptoms i couldn't but try for myself. initially i went every 15 mins? or I'd wait out another 15 until i went. so now on really good day im able to function normally for 1.5 hrs atleast until I've an urge and go. so im easily able to wait it out for 2 hrs and 3-3.5hrs on the best days. on bad days which are more in nos. than good ones, I easily have an urge within an hour, so i wait out another 30 or 45 mins until giving in. 

next, my gynac asked my to get an ultrasound, for which i went yesterday and my reports were completely completely normal. im experiencing 0 pain or burning sensation or any pelvic discomfort. im gna pay him a visit soon to figure out what we can do next bcoz im yet to be diagnosed.

 with god's grace I've no urgency in the night (or while i sleep) i almost feel like a normal individual in the evening hours. however I've noticed my body has grown more intolerant to ac/cold temp? idk if it makes any sense but i feel a more urgent need whenever im in a fully air conditioned, chilled room esp during the day like i literally lose my mind and start gasping for air (not literally). (i come from india > hot climate > ac is our messiah in summers > can't survive without one) 
everything has been so difficult since then. it's so damn frustrating to deliberately control things which you're not supposed to by default, like urinating? it used to seem like such a minor body activity until that fine week when i realised it had gone out of my (subconscious) control so now I've to control it consciously. there is honestly so much at stake when im this young, im yet to get my degree I've not been able to focus on a single thing. im worried about how I'll be facing my 3 hour long exam i mean ofc im allowed to get up for washroom but even a single min matters for me..... idk if I'll ever be the same. idk if I'll ever stop being anxious over the availability of a clean bathroom nearby or not. im not sure how this might end up affecting my career and my relationships. im not sure about anything and it's depressing. to wake up everyday with a single hope that today is the day your symptoms may magically disapper and by the time you make your bed you're already running to bathroom... that's enough to ruin your day. there's so much to life yet it feels pointless when im not functioning properly. i dont understand why i or anyone of us has to go thru this horrible condition. 

i hope we all get better at some point in our lives and learn to live fully, like we are supposed to. sending you all love, positivity and strength 💫🩷🙏🏻",1,1750320486.0,OveractiveBladder,0,0.99,False

Back in April i made a honey jar to reconnect with my ex (we had separated in Feb after 7yrs together). I used honey, sugar, coffee, cinnamon stick, rose petals, and a written petition. It seemed to work, we got back in contact & even met up in May.

Lately though, things have shifted. I’ve been working the jar as usual, lighting candles and focusing my intention, but she’s become more distant and we still have contact  but she seems irritated and cold. 

Last night I had a dream where I said to myself, “What if the jar has gone sour?” and then immediately followed with “Maybe I should make a new one?” I’ve been thinking about that all day. It wasn’t a scary dream or anything, but it got me wondering if it’s time to shift my approach.

I’m not asking for an interpretation, just wondering what others might do in this situation. Would you make a new jar, add a different kind of spell, or continue working the original?

Ps. This post is not about my dream, it’s about my honey jar and how it made my ex all sweet and friendly but now opposite (despite her telling med she cares about me). Feeling there is more to do",1,1750320133.0,Spells,0,1.0,False

Firstly, hi, i should slow down

Second, hi, did i drink a lotta coffee and stimulants..

Three, I edited this on Ibispaint (ate lunch at the wrong time, much laterer) and I have a specific intense phobia of worms, but also I have profound love for one specific worm and therefore i refuse to kill tomie

Four, I've always wanted to see a depiction of this one panel, but now I get why noone does so, and I feel like someone's gonna adapt this on netflix, i'll give the directors and writers a heads up, don't do it.. its hard..

Five, am I tired? Very

Six, why do i profoundly love tomie, not because shes pretty and she gives off an energy most people want to have (confidence, femme fatale esque and being a baddie).. but because I relate to her circumstances, when I was sixteen, people gave me death threats bc I didnt answer dms, and more events similar that i developed psychosis, thats why my dms are still closed today

Seven, nothing just a discussion: omg the first time i saw this panel i was like eww, the second time, ewww, the third time (third time I was making this picture so i searched for it again), and again, ewww, but the more I paid attention to the details and placements, I realised, those are legs.. the worm tomie doesnt have four arms.. and its so cute, she has braids (who tf has been braiding a worm) and bows, and also its a moist worm.... I dont know how to make a wet effect on the worm..

So I (M45) went on a date with someone my friend set me up with. A woman she worked with. Said we’d hit it off, have a lot of similar interests and tastes, etc. it’s been a while so I said sure, why not. Met up with this woman and she wasn’t bad looking. Not drop dead gorgeous but not ugly by any means. But something was off with the way she looked and I couldn’t place it. But I went ahead with the date. We had some drinks, ate some food, threw some darts, talked about movies and video games. She invited me to her place for some coffee and while we were drinking coffee she told me she wanted to sleep with me but she wanted to tell me first, well, long story short she had a penis. I was instantly turned off. I have nothing against trans people I just prefer vagina. I didn’t say anything bad, I don’t think. I mean I wasn’t like “ew gross no thanks”. I tried to be polite as possible. I said thanks for letting me know, and I had a great time but I’m not interested in sleeping with a trans woman. Suddenly I’m the scum of the earth, transphobic, homophobic, everything phobic and people like me are what’s wrong with the world and I probably voted for trump (I didn’t vote at all). Anyway, I did have a great time with her and I was prepared to continue spending time with her platonically, until she exploded like that. And yes, I’ll admit I lashed out in kind when she started berating me and I called her a dude and said I wasn’t gay. But none of that happened before she attacked me verbally. So I left and a day or two went by and I get calls from my friend saying this chick is spreading all kinds of horrible news around her job about their coworkers friend so now she’s caught in the middle of it all. 

Anyway, I’ve never done one of these before so I don’t know how to end it. I just want to know what other people think, AITA for not wanting to sleep with her? I know I’m the ahole for lashing out when she exploded. But what about before that?",1,1750319981.0,AITA_Relationships,2,1.0,False

Here are the meeting minutes for the Sudden Valley Long-Range Planning Committee meeting held on June 5, 2025.

# Sudden Valley Community Association

**Long-Range Planning Committee Meeting Minutes**

**Date:** June 5, 2025  
**Time:** 6:37 PM – 8:02 PM  
**Location:** Sudden Valley Dance Barn & Virtual via Web Conference

* Mitch
* Elizabeth
* Ken
* Chad
* Rick (Online)
* Gary Bara (Online)

**Guests & Staff Present:**

* Janine Harbor (Guest)
* Tammy (Guest)
* Spencer (IT Support)

# II. Call to Order

The meeting was called to order by the Chair at 6:37 PM.

# III. Opening Remarks & Land Acknowledgment

The Chair began the meeting with a land acknowledgment, recognizing that the committee gathers on the ancestral homelands of the Coastal Salish Peoples. A correction was noted for the written agenda, which should read ""Coastal"" instead of ""Coat.""

The committee's stance against racism in all forms was also affirmed.

# IV. Roll Call & Agenda

1. **Roll Call:** All committee members were present, with Rick and Gary Bara joining online.
2. **Adoption of the Agenda:**
   * A motion was made to amend future agendas to include a dedicated line item for ""Committee Discussion"" to allow for more open conversation.
   * **DECISION:** The committee unanimously agreed to add a ""Committee Discussion"" section to all future meeting agendas.
   * The current meeting's agenda was adopted as presented, with the understanding of the future amendment.

# V. Approval of Previous Minutes

* The minutes from the May 1, 2025 meeting were reviewed.
* Two corrections were noted:
   1. The name of guest Janine Harbor needed to be added to the attendee list.
   2. A typo of ""Coat Salish"" should be corrected to ""Coastal Salish.""
* **DECISION:** The May 1, 2025 minutes were approved with the noted corrections.

# VI. Subcommittee Reports & Discussion

The majority of the meeting was dedicated to receiving and discussing reports from subcommittees tasked with exploring potential revenue-generating and community-enhancing projects.

**A. Parking Revenue (Presented by Ken & Chad)**

* **Analysis:** The subcommittee conducted a survey of parking availability at key locations:
   * **AM/PM Beach:** Currently \~20 spots with the potential to increase to 30 with minimal work.
   * **Rotunda/Mailbox Area:** \~25 designated carpool spots, with an additional 10-12 spots available in a currently chained-off area.
   * **Marina/Dog Park:** Approximately 50 total spots, including truck/trailer parking.
* **Core Issue:** It is unclear whether parking congestion on busy weekends is caused by a lack of spaces for residents or by non-residents utilizing the lots.
* **Proposed Solution:** To gather concrete data, the subcommittee proposed a study.
* **COMMITMENT:** Ken and Chad will prepare a formal proposal for the Board to implement a free vehicle sticker system for residents. This will allow the association to conduct a study over the summer to accurately track resident vs. non-resident parking usage and determine the true nature of the parking problem.

**B. Solar Power Plant on Airstrip (Presented by Mitch & Rick)**

* **Initial Finding:** Generating revenue by selling solar power back to Puget Sound Energy (PSE) is not viable, as PSE only offers credits against the association's own energy bill, not cash payments.
* **Alternative Opportunity:** The subcommittee discovered PSE has a program to lease land from communities for solar energy projects. PSE would cover all costs of development, installation, and maintenance, while paying the association a lease fee for the land.
* **Feasibility:** The airstrip property appears to meet all of PSE's preliminary criteria for such a project. Mitch has already engaged with the county regarding the ongoing Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) review to advocate for such green projects in the watershed.
* **COMMITMENT:** The subcommittee will ask the Board for permission to submit a formal application to PSE to determine their interest in leasing the airstrip for a community solar project.

**C. Assisted Living Facility (Presented by Elizabeth & The Chair)**

* **Problem:** Residents needing assisted living options currently have no choice but to move out of Sudden Valley.
* **Potential Location:** A 14.88-acre, association-owned parcel (32932) has been identified as a suitable and properly zoned location.
* **Developer Interest:** A commercial developer in Bellingham was consulted and expressed interest in a partnership model where the association retains land ownership, the developer builds the facility, an experienced company operates it, and the association receives revenue via a long-term lease.
* **COMMITMENT:** The subcommittee is awaiting a follow-up from the developer on the project's viability and will continue to explore this opportunity.

**D. Coffee Shop / Food Service (Presented by Elizabeth & April)**

* **Focus:** The subcommittee focused on repurposing the old administration building into a food service establishment.
* **Concept:** The space is ideal for a coffee house, bakery, and/or ice cream parlor. It is centrally located, has parking, and is walkable from the recreation area.
* **Professional Opinion:** After consulting with a restaurateur, the concept was deemed viable for a limited-menu operation. The group suggested approaching an established local coffee company, such as Woods Coffee (whose CFO is a Sudden Valley resident), to assess professional interest.
* **COMMITMENT:** The subcommittee will contact an experienced, professional coffee operator to explore the feasibility of leasing the old administration building for a new community coffee shop.

# VII. New Business: Barn 6 Preliminary Plans

The Chair presented the working blueprints for the new Barn 6 building. The committee reviewed the two-story design, which includes:

* **Ground Floor:** A multi-purpose court for basketball, volleyball, pickleball, etc., a prep kitchen with a serving window, large storage rooms, offices, meeting rooms, and restrooms. Roll-up doors will allow for an open-air connection to the outside.
* **Second Floor:** A large open-plan room (for events, dances, etc.), an adult/senior center, an additional meeting room, and a large balcony.
* Feedback was provided, including a suggestion to swap the locations of the adult center and a meeting room to provide better access to the kitchen and restrooms.

# VIII. Next Meeting

The next meeting is scheduled for **Thursday, July 3, 2025, at 6:30 PM**.

# IX. Adjournment

The meeting was adjourned at 8:02 PM.

I am an independent app developer and digital nomad living in Bali. Lately I have realized how important marketing is. I want to get better at it and learn how to create content to advertise my apps and social media. If I really want to be %100 independent, I need to be as good at marketing as I am at building.

I have never been in Vietnam before, but I will go there soon. I plan to rent a hostel near the beach for a month and sign up for a gym. For work, I will spend most of my time inside, but I also want to explore a few good places to work.

A few friends told me Da Nang is a great place to focus and lock in because there is not too much going on.

That is basically my plan. Do you have any suggestions? 

It can be anything, from recommending another city, a coffee shop to work, food to try, a gym to join, or a hostel to rent. I am open to any feedback on my decision.

Hi everyone,  
  
I’m using a Timemore Chestnut C3 grinder, mostly for pour-over (typically 25g of coffee at around 18–20 clicks). Occasionally, I switch to 30 clicks for cold brew

What I’ve noticed is that when I return to 18–20 clicks for pour-over, the grind (and resulting taste) feels a bit different—like the same number of clicks doesn’t always produce the same grind size. It’s subtle, but definitely noticeable in the cup.

Has anyone else experienced this kind of inconsistency or offset after switching grind settings back and forth? Any idea what might cause it?

On the day I was supposed to get my marriage license, I found myself at city hall bright and early, waiting from 8 AM until it closed.

Just as I was walking out, feeling the curious stares from the crowd, I got a message from Austin Herrera, saying something had come up at work, and we'd need to [reschedule.ac](http://reschedule.ac/)

When I got back to our empty house, I opened my phone and saw an Instagram post from Austin's childhood sweetheart: \[Thanks for the birthday gift, Austin.\]

The photo showed a beautiful scene on an island, and in the corner, I could still see a guy with a well-defined physique.

Scrolling through the comments, it was all compliments and a bit of playful envy about having such a great friend.

After giving the post a like, I decided to reach out to my friend. \[Hey, can you set up that blind date you mentioned last time?\]

\*\*\*\*\*

I'd been in love with Austin for six years, and during that time, I'd transformed from a young girl into a woman nearly thirty.

My family had been all about the wedding talk, and I kept bringing up marriage with Austin, but he always seemed to put it off.

Just when I thought I might be done waiting, he surprised me by proposing in public not too long ago.

Today was supposed to be the big day for us to get our license.

Two days ago, my mom called out of the blue, saying, ""Sweetie, I consulted someone, and they say the day after tomorrow is a perfect day for you to get your license.""

I couldn't help but laugh, and of course, Austin heard me. He pulled me into a warm embrace and assured me he was all in for anything I needed.

But then, right before our license appointment yesterday, he suddenly started packing his bags for a business trip. Before he left, he gently ruffled my hair and said, ""Don't worry, it's just for a day. I'll definitely be back in time.""

Looking into his calm eyes, I held back the words I wanted to say. I just smiled as I dropped him off at the airport, feeling happy. Even last night when we talked, he swore he was already at the airport.

Today, I woke up early, put on some light makeup, and headed to the city hall with my driver's license in hand. I couldn't help but daydream about the amazing life we'd have together.

As time ticked by, the fresh rose in my hand slowly wilted. I called Austin multiple times, but none of my calls went through, and I couldn't shake the worry that something might have happened to him.

I even reached out to a coworker who was supposed to be traveling with him, trying to get some intel. Turns out, they hadn't been on any trip at all.

""Ms. Parks, I heard Mr. Herrera took a week off just to get ready for the wedding. I'd be thrilled to attend your wedding,"" the guy said.

""I'll see you then,"" I replied, chuckling weakly before hanging up.

I still found myself wondering if this whole thing was some sort of surprise that Austin was planning for me.

When I finally got home, the place was empty, and as I flipped the lights on, I realized there wasn't going to be any surprise waiting for me after all.

Feeling a bit let down, I collapsed on the couch and tried to clear my mind about what Austin was actually up to.

Just then, I got a message from Austin: \[The company had a temporary issue. We'd have to get the license some other time.\]

I replied with a simple \[Sure.\]

Then, out of curiosity, I opened Instagram and found a post from Austin's childhood sweetheart. \[Thanks for the birthday gift, Austin.\] It was accompanied by a photo of an island.

There was a girl in a cute swimsuit lounging under a coconut tree, donning a wide sun hat and carrying a limited edition bag. And in the reflections of her sunglasses was a solidly-built guy snapping a pic of her.

Yeah, that was definitely Austin off on a supposedly ""temporary"" commitment.

Scrolling through the comments, I saw others lamenting how they wished they had a brother like him.

I couldn't help but chuckle. Honestly, I felt pretty foolish. Just earlier, I was all worried about him, and now here I was, making excuses for his obvious lies.

I was so hopelessly dumb.

A dull ache settled in my chest. I'd been in love with Austin for six long years, and those sweet moments we shared were often tainted by things that didn't really belong to us.

There was his childhood sweetheart, Rosemary Read. Her parents had passed away when she was young, and she ended up being raised in Austin's home, which made them incredibly close, almost like siblings.

On my birthday, I'd find myself blowing out candles alone while he'd get wrapped up in some excuse related to Rosemary. He'd even bring her along on our dates, saying he couldn't leave her alone at home.

And when he finally proposed, he bought her a dress from the same collection he picked for me because, apparently, she liked it too.

All those memories flooded back, and every argument we had over Rosemary ended with that same phrase from him. ""She's just my little sister.""

My heart sank a little deeper, especially knowing he was off vacationing on some island with Rosemary while I sat at home waiting for him.

Six years. How many more of these could I take? Growing up without a father, I always wanted a complete family, dreaming that my future kids would have a happy home.

I smiled bitterly, wiping away the tears that had slipped out.

I even liked this post, hoping he'd take a hint. Then, I turned around and casually messaged a friend: \[Hey, can you set up that blind date you mentioned last time?\]

\*\*\*\*\*

Austin returned home three days later. He walked in with an icy chill hanging around him and stood in the foyer, waiting for me to come help with the bags.

I stayed put on the couch, not giving him a glance.

When I didn't move, he finally spoke up, ""Laurel, I'm home."" I just hummed and kept my eyes glued to the TV.

Noticing something was off, he hung his snow-drenched jacket by the door and made his way over to me. He wrapped me in his arms and softly asked if I was upset.

""Laurel, I'm sorry. That project was a bit tricky,"" he said.

I tuned into his steady heartbeat, which didn't skip a beat even when he lied.

""I saw Rosemary's Instagram,"" I shot back, locking my gaze on him to see how he'd react.

When I dropped Rosemary's name, I could see his face tighten with annoyance, and I could hear it in his voice. ""Rosemary just happened to be there, and I swung by for her birthday. How many times do I have to tell you I think of her like a little sister?""

Just like I thought, he was sticking to the same old script. ""Oh, so you had time for her birthday but no time to give me a call?"" I asked.

During the time I couldn't reach him, my mind raced, wondering if he was safe. I felt a lump in my throat as I fought to hold back tears in front of him.

Austin pressed his lips together and stubbornly added, ""What difference does it make? We still couldn't get a license anyway.""

I looked at him, the guy I'd spent six years with, and felt a wave of disappointment wash over me. For a moment, I didn't even want to argue.

Just then, the doorbell rang. I got up to answer it, and it was Rosemary. She had a big bag in her hand and smiled warmly at me. ""Laurel, you're here. I brought Austin's stuff he left at my place.""

She handed me the bag, revealing a bracelet around her wrist.

My heart dropped when I saw it, and I froze as I took the bag in my hands. That bracelet was special. Austin had traveled to several cities to get it for me.

When he gave it to me, he said, ""I hope this brings you luck.""

Turns out, what I thought was something unique between us, he had given to Rosemary too.

""Sorry, Laurel,"" Rosemary said, her hands together and her head tilted, her eyes wide with innocence.

# Chapter 2 Break Up

""You're not upset that Austin took me on vacation for my birthday, are you?"" Rosemary asked.

I looked at her, not saying a word, and quietly closed the door behind me.

\*\*\*\*\*

I went cold turkey with Austin. Every time we fought about Rosemary, it would spark a silent war. Austin had gotten used to this pattern, knowing that after three days, I'd be back in front of him, ready to make up.

I hadn't even drifted off to sleep when there was a loud knock at my door.

""Laurel!"" Austin shouted, his voice filled with frustration.

I opened the door, and he shoved his phone at me. ""How many times do I have to say it? Rosemary is just my sister! Why do you take it so personally?""

I was clueless. ""What did I do to her?""

""And you have the nerve to ask! Did you say something to her when she came over? Mom said she's been off since she got back, and now she's in the hospital because of her depression!""

I glanced at Austin's phone, the screen showing a picture of Rosemary lying weakly in a hospital bed, her wrist wrapped in thick gauze.

""I didn't say anything to her,"" I said. I was being honest.

Austin said to me sharply with one hand around my neck, ""If anything goes wrong with Rosemary, you can forget about marrying me.""

I wanted to call him a psycho, but I couldn't get half a sound out of my throat, and I frantically scratched at Austin's hand, desperate for him to let me go.

Just when I felt like I might pass out, he threw me to the ground and looked down at me, condescendingly saying, ""After everything we've been through, if you don't go after Rosemary again, I might actually think about marrying you.""

With that, he turned and stormed downstairs, snatching the keys from the table before slamming the door behind him.

I was left sitting on the floor, struggling to catch my breath. It felt like my heart was completely shattered. He made these wild accusations without a shred of proof, and it was like he was losing it over it all.

I wobbled a bit as I pushed myself up, steadying myself against the wall, and grabbed the phone that had been ringing off the hook on the nightstand.

""Laurel, it's been ages! Want to grab a drink?"" It was Erin George, my high school classmate, someone I hadn't seen in years.

She had just landed in Newton City and was only around for a day before she headed back.

Taking a deep breath to steady my nerves, I agreed to meet her.

\*\*\*\*\*

Erin had reserved a fancy dining room and invited a few of our close friends from the area. The vibe was chill as we all caught up, sharing stories from our lives while reminiscing about the good old times.

""So, Laurel, how are things with you and Austin? Still not married?"" Erin shot me a teasing look.

Back in the day, everyone figured Austin and I would end up together since we were high school sweethearts who went to the same college.

I tugged at the collar of my turtleneck sweater, avoiding eye contact as I swirled the wine in my glass before downing it. ""Nope. Guess it just wasn't meant to be.""

Polly Maxwell frowned, leaning in. ""Is it you or him who doesn't want it anymore?""

""It's him,"" I replied, feeling the weight of those words.

Suddenly, Polly slammed her hand on the table hard enough to send her fork clattering to the ground. ""Is it because of Rosemary? I warned you ages ago that she'd always be in the way between you two, but you wouldn't listen!""

I couldn't help but let out a bitter laugh and shake my head. I always thought Austin just liked pampering his ""sister.""

""Rosemary?"" Laura Watson chimed in, pulling out her phone to show us something.

She played a video that caught everyone's attention: there was Rosemary, wildly banging on a middle-aged guy with her heel. The man held her wrists firmly and was telling bystanders, ""My wife is just having a tantrum, so don't mind her.""

With tears in her eyes, Rosemary was begging, ""No, please help me!""

The video ended with a tall guy standing up to confront the burly man, announcing that the police were on their way. Just before he left, the burly guy leaned in to whisper something threatening to Rosemary.

""It went viral in my neighborhood—everyone was saying the guy was a psychopath and warned to be careful when going out."" Laura looked at me, her eyes filled with pity. ""It looked like Rosemary.""

""It's her,"" I said calmly, unable to shake the unsettling feeling.

The woman in the video looked just like Rosemary, from her hair to the outfit she wore.

Austin had vaguely mentioned that Rosemary had been molested as a child, leaving her with deep psychological scars. I couldn't help but think the psycho had something to do with her suicide.

""Quit bringing her up. I told you Austin's no good for you. When the hell are you finally gonna dump him?"" Polly, a bit tipsy, shot me a disapproving look, like she was ready to jump on me if I said I still had feelings for Austin.

Outside, the rain drizzled against the window, and I noticed a dull ache from the bruise on my neck.

I stared at the raindrops sliding down the glass, feeling a bit lost. ""Just a couple more days.""

\*\*\*\*\*

A week later, Austin got in touch again. The whole Rosemary situation had somehow made the news, and I followed it reluctantly.

The report said the man was in a psychiatric hospital, and the girl who was involved was under close protection by her family.

I knew Austin was aware of the truth. When he called, instead of apologizing, he casually informed me he'd be home for dinner tonight. I shrugged it off, ""Anything else?""

The agent waited patiently for me to sign the contract, and I double-checked everything before putting my name down. Austin was quiet for a while, then finally said, ""Laurel, about the other day, I...""

I kept silent, waiting for him to continue. In the end, I didn't get the apology I expected. Instead, he blurted out, ""Let's get married, Laurel. I'll meet you at the city hall tomorrow.""

I couldn't help but smile ironically, feeling an unusual heaviness in my heart.

Had I been so indulgent with him over the years that I'd given him the impression this was how to make it up to me? Did he really think I was that easy to brush aside?

""No, thanks,"" I replied.

His displeasure was clear. ""What do you mean, no?""

I strolled over to the window to take in the view of Newton City, a place I'd been stuck in for what felt like ages. I moved here for Austin since his whole family was based in this city.

I saved up every penny to buy this house, hoping that one day, if I got married, my mom would come to live here with me. It'd make it easier to care for her.

But honestly, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being pretty selfish, making her move to a strange city just for me. Right now, though, I'd never felt more sober.

""I mean, we're done,"" I said.

Austin was about to say more when I heard Rosemary's voice blaring on the other end. ""Austin, where are you?""

He left me a quick, irritated ""Cut it out"" and hung up.

The agent beside me pretended not to notice the commotion and flashed a smile, saying, ""Ms. Parks, the funds will arrive within 24 hours.""

I nodded and handed him the key. ""Thanks. Here you go.""

# Chapter 3 Choices

After selling the house, I drove back to the place I shared with Austin and opened the door to an eerie stillness.

It seemed Austin hadn't been around for a while—he'd been busy taking care of Rosemary at the hospital.

I couldn't help but smirk a little. Honestly, that was fine by me. I'd rather not run into him.

Most of my stuff was in the second bedroom, and over the years, I'd had my fair share of arguments with Austin about Rosemary.

I had spent my time in that room during the rough patches and felt like I was constantly keeping my head down.

A bitter smile crept across my face as I packed up my things, remembering how submissive I used to be.

I didn't bother keeping anything that reminded me of Austin. Two hours later, I wiped the beads of sweat off my forehead with a tissue, feeling a mix of exhaustion and relief.

Then, my phone rang. I glanced at the caller ID and saw it was my mom. I hesitated for a second before answering. ""Hey, Mom.""

Her voice was filled with that familiar mix of excitement and nostalgia. ""Laurel, how's it going? Have you gotten the license yet? Have you and Austin talked about the wedding plans?""

I felt something tighten in my throat as I opened my mouth, but nothing came out.

There was a long, awkward silence, and when my mom began to press me, I took a deep breath, fighting back tears. ""Mom, I'm not getting married.""

""What do you mean, Laurel? What's going on?"" Her tone turned anxious.

I tried to explain, ""I just don't think Austin and I are right for each other.""

Her voice rose slightly. ""But Laurel, you've been together forever! Why say this now, right before the wedding? Come on, you're 27, not a kid anymore.""

It struck me that without even asking what I was feeling, she just urged me to get married.

Tears filled my eyes, and I had to cover my mouth to keep from breaking down. After what felt like forever, I found my voice, ""Mom, I really just don't want to marry him.""

My mom didn't hold back her frustration. ""So what do you want, then? Just give up on all these years?""

When she heard my firm answer, her tone shifted. ""Laurel, how can you just say you don't want this after all this time?""

""Well, I just said it,"" I shot back, feeling overwhelmed.

My mom's voice suddenly went all high-pitched, probably still trying to convince me, and before she could make a sound, I heard a dull thud from the other end of the line.

""Mom?"" I called out but got no response.

A wave of panic hit me like a freight train. ""Mom! What's wrong? Please answer me!""

All I could make out was a faint moan of pain coming from her. My heart clenched tight, and I hung up in a hurry, flipping on the home security feed.

In my panic, my phone slipped from my shaking hands, sliding under the couch like it was covered in grease.

I dropped to my knees, desperately reaching for my phone. The security footage showed my mom, clearly in distress, clutching her chest and reaching for her medicine on the table.

All I wanted to do was dive through the screen and hand her the pills she needed.

I had only one thought racing through my mind: save my mom. I quickly opened my contacts and dialed my aunt, Bonnie Porter, who lived in the same building with my mom.

""Come on, pick up!"" I pleaded, praying she'd answer fast.

The ten seconds felt like an eternity, but finally, Bonnie picked up. I burst into tears, sounding like a total mess as I exclaimed, ""Aunt Bonnie, my mom is having an attack! You need to hurry!""

Bonnie sounded surprised but jumped into action, heading over to my mom's place while trying to calm me down.

I hung up and immediately called for an ambulance, anxiously switching back to the feed, just hoping someone would get to my mom in time.

At that moment, I regretted everything about moving to Newton City alone and leaving my mom all by herself. Watching her suffer through a screen felt like a nightmare.

I couldn't help but blame myself for being so hasty in talking to her and pushing her buttons.

The self-loathing and regret were overwhelming. I shouldn't have done that. I was so wrong. I promised myself, never again.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity of two minutes, I heard the doorbell chime, signaling that Bonnie had entered the house.

She rushed in, looking almost like an angel descending from above, and quickly administered the medicine from the table to my mom.

Through the monitor, I watched as my mom's pale expression started to ease up while my phone slipped weakly to the floor.

Bonnie called me to let me know that my mom was out of danger, and I insisted she take her to the hospital for a follow-up.

It wasn't until I hung up that I felt like I'd regained my sanity, and my heart, which was racing like crazy, finally calmed down.

Taking a deep breath, I picked up the pace with my packing. The thought of leaving Newton City was getting harder to shake off.

The moving guys were still on their way, so I was waiting and checking in with Bonnie about my mom's condition when, out of nowhere, Austin appeared right in front of me.

The sound of the bouquet hitting the floor snapped me out of my phone trance, and I was taken aback by his sudden presence.

He was all dressed up in a sharp suit and tie, with his hair styled just right, showing off a smooth forehead that gave him a touch of mature charm. A bunch of delicate roses lay discarded at his feet.

His eyes looked stormy, filled with suppressed anger as he gritted out, ""Laurel, what do you mean by that?""

""Didn't I tell you? I want to break up. Do you not get it?"" My emotions were all over the place, and I was starting to lose my patience, saying whatever popped into my head.

He kicked the coffee table in frustration, sending glass flying, and pointed at the photo I had tossed in the trash, shouting angrily, ""I'm going to get a marriage license with you today. What do you mean?""

So that was why he dressed up—he thought we were heading to get a license. I assumed he dressed to the nine to pick up Rosemary from the hospital.

""I don't need that—"" I tried to shoot back.

Before I could finish, he cut me off, ""Didn't I promise to marry you? What do you want? Are you done with your little tantrum? If you don't marry me, what are you going to say to your mom?""

Looking at his smug face, I couldn't help but think he knew how much my mom had been looking forward to my wedding for ages.

So he knew all the time. He kept me waiting for three long years before finally agreeing to marry me, fully aware of my mom's situation.

It was just heartbreaking. What was I even doing falling for him?

I found myself staring at Austin in silence, my eyes reflecting a deep emptiness.

His anger started to fade as he seemed to regain some composure, and he began to softly coax me, ""I was wrong to stand you up, Laurel. Can we move past this?""

My resolve started to waver, but not because of him—it was all about my mom. I really worried that she would get so upset over everything that it would send her into another health scare.

She'd been adamant about me starting a family, and she'd definitely prefer Austin, the guy I've been in love with for years, over some blind date she barely knew.

That bruise on my neck was a constant reminder that I shouldn't just give in. But my mom was still stuck in that hospital bed, and it stopped me cold.

Just as I was about to crack, something unexpected happened that helped me decide what to do.

# Chapter 4 Just A Bad Dream

At that moment, a figure suddenly appeared, and I was taken aback to see Rosemary standing right in front of me.

She looked drained and pale, wearing a white dress that did nothing to hide her distress.

""Laurel, are you mad at Austin?"" Rosemary's eyes were glossy with unshed tears, and there was a mix of fear and helplessness in her expression.

She continued, her voice cracking, ""It's all my fault. I didn't clarify things with Austin, and that's what led to the misunderstanding between you two.""

I remained silent, my gaze fixed on Rosemary.

""Please, don't be angry with him. I'm truly sorry,"" she pleaded, clearly overwhelmed. ""Austin has been planning for ages to get a marriage license with you."" She bit her lip, looking extremely weak.

I was about to reply when Austin, whose face was dark with frustration, said, ""Laurel, enough already. Rosemary came here to apologize—what more do you want from her?""

I noticed the bruise on her wrist, wrapped in cloth, and shifted my attention to Austin, ""Austin, how about you make a choice? You can either have me or Rosemary.""

""That's enough, Laurel!"" he snapped, glaring at me as though he could burn a hole right through me.

The answer had been clear for a while, but here I was, still holding on. Not for him, but for myself. Six years. How did I lose myself in all this and end up loving a guy like him? I had no idea.

I looked at Austin, trying to keep my cool, and gave a faint smile. ""So, if I go celebrate another guy's birthday, hang around when he's sick, and baby him every now and then, does that make me just some shameless woman in your eyes?""

""Laurel, Austin and I are not what you think,"" Rosemary mumbled, her surprise evident.

""Come on, Rosemary. You know Austin and I are getting married, so why do you keep showing up looking all innocent? You're playing the role of the 'good girl' pretty well,"" I shot back.

With those words, Rosemary froze, disbelief written all over her face, and then she burst into tears.

Pop! Austin's brow furrowed in anger as he stared at me, who had been slapped to the ground by him.

""Laurel,"" Rosemary's reaction was immediate as she rushed to help me.

But I caught a glimpse of a smirk creeping onto her lips just before she lowered her gaze. It was quick but telling.

""Fuck off!"" The words flew out before I could stop myself, and Rosemary stumbled back a couple of steps.

""Laurel,"" Austin said, his eyes heavy with disappointment. ""You've turned into a green-eyed monster. Rosemary was just trying to help you, and you went and pushed her away?""

Rosemary started tugging on his arm, stammering, ""Austin, I'm fine. It's my fault. I made Laurel mad.""

I finally managed to stand and let out a soft laugh. ""What a twist! Did I even touch you, Rosemary? No matter what happens, suddenly it's my fault? Am I like some kind of biochemical weapon just for you?""

Rosemary looked stunned, lost for words, but then tears started streaming down her face as if they were on a mission.

""Laurel, I want you to apologize to Rosemary! Or else I'm not getting married,"" Austin demanded, furrowing his brow. He seemed totally unfazed by the breakup talk.

Sure, I usually brought up breakups during our fights, but in the end, all it took was a little coaxing from him, and I'd be back on his side, pretending nothing had ever gone wrong.

I didn't want to dwell on these arguments to protect our feelings.

But suddenly it hit me: what Austin and I had was just me fooling myself, constantly backing down and giving in.

""Austin, we're done. I'm the one who called it off. You both handle it from here,"" I said, wanting nothing more than to walk away from the mess and that scum for good.

With that, I grabbed my suitcase and headed for the door, not looking back. Rosemary was still trying to reason with Austin. ""Austin, you should go after Laurel. This is all my fault,"" she pleaded.

""Relax, she's just having a little meltdown. She won't really break up with me,"" Austin assured her.

Once I settled into the cab, I noticed the two of them on the security camera, wrapped up in each other's arms, and I couldn't help but smirk a little. They claimed there was nothing between them, but deep down, I knew the truth.

I raised a hand to my cheek, still tender from Austin's earlier blow, and it felt like a knife twisted in my heart. The ache spread through my body, a reminder of the six years I'd wasted.

I wasn't crying, but my heart felt so heavy it was hard to breathe.

After a moment of reflection, I pulled up the video I had just recorded and posted it on my Instagram.

Since I decided to cut ties with Austin, I figured it was only fitting to finish what they started. I wasn't going to take this slap for nothing.

I crafted my last message: \[A shoutout to those who'd supported me over the past six years. I am officially breaking up with Austin.\]

With a final click, I powered off my phone. Clutching an ice pack over my throbbing head, I glanced at the city disappearing beneath me.

There was a mix of humiliation and anger in my heart, but seeing the bright blue sky somehow lightened the burden a bit.

Before I knew it, I drifted off to sleep, only to wake up with tears streaming down my face. Just then, a long, elegant hand offered me a gray handkerchief.

""Here,"" the owner of the pretty hand said, his voice smooth and calming.

""Thanks,"" I mumbled, taking it awkwardly.

""Are you alright?"" he asked, a note of concern in his tone.

I nodded, forcing a bittersweet smile. ""I'm fine, just a bad dream.""

I dreamt back to the first time I laid eyes on Austin, my heart racing—it was definitely one of those love-at-first-sight moments.

Later on, I even went so far as to lower my standards just to get into the same school as him. I thought it would lead to a better life, but honestly, I was just squandering my best years.

It was interesting how sometimes the wrong person could feel scarier than facing a real demon.

I let out a deep sigh and turned to glance at the guy sitting next to me. Just one look, and my whole body froze.

My heart raced as I managed to stammer, ""Un-uncle Alex, what are you doing here?""

Alex Herrera raised an eyebrow, sizing me up before casually saying, ""Didn't you break up with Austin? Why do you still call me uncle?""

# Chapter 5 An Awkward Encounter

I took a deep breath when I unexpectedly ran into Alex on the plane. How did I end up meeting him here? He was Austin's uncle and Raphael Herrera's youngest son.

In the Herrera family, he was the one everyone feared—especially Austin.

Growing up, Alex was molded to be someone else entirely. When I first heard his name, I pictured a woman, but instead, I found this incredibly handsome guy—more stunning than most women I know.

Not only did he have looks, but he had also got this air of sophistication about him. At a young age, he was already seated as the president of Herrera Group.

Though he was only six years older than Austin, Austin had to call him uncle, and I was dating Austin, so I'd been doing the same.

But now that Austin and I were officially done, it felt silly to still call him that.

""Did you and Austin have a fallout?"" Alex asked, his voice lowered as he crossed his legs, a knowing smile on his face.

""No, it's a breakup,"" I said, trying to sound confident.

""A breakup?"" He looked surprised, still smiling, but I could tell he didn't buy it.

I mean, who could blame him? Being married to Austin, a rich young man from the Herrera family, seemed like a dream for most women.

Besides, after six years together, how could I possibly just walk away from that? Back then, I was all-in on Austin.

Everyone thought I was just lucky to be with him, and honestly, if he'd revealed his true identity back in school, I might not have been his pick in the first place.

Now, I was nearing thirty with nothing to show for it—who was I to break up with him? Even Austin assumed I was head over heels for him and that suggesting a breakup was just me throwing a fit.

""Yeah,"" I said, taking a deep breath to steady myself, trying my best to keep it cool.

""I saw your Instagram."" Alex looked up slowly, his voice still calm and soft.

It felt like the way an elder talked to a younger person, but the light in his eyes—slightly reminiscent of Austin's—hit me with a mix of panic and awe.

I honestly hadn't expected Alex to keep tabs on my Instagram, and I'd even forgotten he had an account. He rarely said much online, just a few holiday photos now and then. I seriously wondered if he even used it himself.

""As long as you've thought it through,"" he added.

I was taken aback for a second, waiting for Alex to drop some words of shame or caution about being impulsive. Instead, he surprised me with his response.

The tension in my chest vanished instantly as I managed a shy smile and nodded silently.

I didn't breathe a sigh of relief until the plane touched down and I watched Alex stand up and grab his luggage.

Although he wasn't as intimidating as I had imagined, he still had this unshakeable aura that felt heavy.

As I stepped out of the airport, a black Alphard suddenly pulled up right in front of me.

Before I could process it, the driver came over and said, ""Ms. Parks, Mr. Herrera asked me to give you a ride.""

I opened my mouth to decline, but when the window rolled down and I saw that gorgeous face, words just vanished.

At that moment, it hit me—Austin's fear of Alex was totally justified. The guy had such a strong presence that I felt too timid to say no.

""Get in the car. It's going to rain soon,"" Alex said, glancing at me with that cool gaze.

I found myself sliding into the car without a second thought. Sitting beside him, I quickly masked my emotions. My face was calm, but inside, I felt this strange unease.

After all, I had just broken up with Austin. Why would Alex bother giving me a ride? Was it just because of the rain? Or maybe he felt sorry for me?

Trying to figure it out was a lost cause, especially since Alex and I had only crossed paths a few times.

It was not like a guy like him would focus on someone like me. Maybe it was just pity, some kindness for someone who had just got out of a serious relationship. Honestly, I decided not to overthink it.

""Where to?"" Alex's calm voice pulled me out of my thoughts.

""The hospital,"" I replied almost automatically, without thinking twice.

Honestly, I felt a bit awkward saying that, but I was already thankful that I kept my home address under wraps.

All of a sudden, it started pouring rain. It didn't even register with me that it was actually raining.

Half an hour later, we pulled up outside the hospital. The driver got out, grabbed my luggage from the trunk, and strolled over with an umbrella in hand.

As I stepped out, I glanced back at Alex, who was sitting in the car with his eyes half-closed. I swallowed my thanks and left.

Taking my suitcase and turning my back to the sleek black car, I finally let out a long sigh of relief.

In my mind, I couldn't shake the image of Alex's striking profile. He was clearly in his early thirties but carried an air of maturity that made him seem older.

It was a shame, too, because, with a face like that, Alex would probably attract a lot of young admirers.

As I walked into the hospital and fished out my phone, a call came in from an unknown number. After a brief moment of hesitation, I hit the answer button.

""Laurel, what the heck is wrong with you? Do you even realize that Rosemary is sick because of you?"" It was Amanda Herrera, Austin's mother, and her angry voice echoed through the line.

I stood there for a second, stunned, gripping my suitcase tightly.

""Laurel, you need to come back right now and apologize to Rosemary. Clear things up online and say you posted that video by accident. We'll let this slide!"" Amanda demanded.

I instinctively ran my fingers over my throat, which still felt a bit sore.

I was relieved that I hadn't gone through with getting a license with Austin.

Honestly, I was grateful for the last three years of not marrying him. It took me a while to truly see how ridiculous I was being.

Looking back on the past six years, it felt like I'd thrown a piece of my heart to the wolves.

I looked at her and said, ""Mrs. Herrera, Austin and I are through. So, do me a favor and don't bother me again.""

""Laurel, enough already! You're really crossing the line here. My mom called you—so what the hell do you want from me?"" Austin's voice came through, sharp and frustrated.",1,1750318455.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

1lf4rwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToLoseWeightFST/comments/1lf4rwy/will_detox_tea_make_you_poop/,Will detox tea make you poop?,"I never thought I would write an entire post about digestion, but here we are. After a winter of desk work, delivery food, and feeling like a balloon by 5 p.m., I decided to test whether a detox tea could *actually* help. The one that kept popping up was **Lulutox detox tea**, so I bought a bag, drank it daily for six weeks, and tracked everything: energy, cravings, scale, even bathroom visits. If you are wondering “will detox tea make you poop,” or searching for an honest **Lulutox tea review**, here’s the unfiltered rundown.

**What I wanted to know**

1. Would I spend half my day in the bathroom?
2. Could it ease the bloating that made jeans feel like a torture device?
3. Would the claims about gentle energy and gut support hold up?

I was not looking for a miracle cleanse or rapid weight drop. I just wanted my stomach to stop rebelling after every meal.

**The ingredient list looked legit**

I always skim labels before putting anything in my body. **Lulutox tea ingredients** include matcha green tea, oolong, sencha, yerba mate, guarana, dandelion leaf, milk thistle, nettle leaf, ginseng, goji berries, lemongrass, stevia, and a pinch of citric acid. Everything is plant based, gluten free, and soy free. Caffeine sits at around 18 mg per cup, far less than coffee but enough to wake me up. No mystery laxatives hidden at the bottom of the blend, which was a relief.

**Week 1: First impressions**

Taste surprised me in a good way. Lightly peachy, not bitter, and no need to add sweetener. Days one through three produced zero urgent bathroom trips, just a mild diuretic effect like any herbal tea. By day five my usual evening bloat started to back off. My gut felt calmer, and sleep was deeper than usual.

**Week 2–3: Energy shift, cravings drop**

Around day ten I realized I had not reached for a second coffee in a week. The steady lift from **lulutox tea** was enough to get me through Zoom calls without the mid-afternoon crash. I also noticed fewer snack attacks. I cannot claim scientific proof, but the combo of green tea catechins and yerba mate may be helping metabolism and satiety. Small win: two pounds gone without diet overhaul.

**Week 4–6: Real changes**

By the end of the month my scale showed 4.7 lbs less, but the bigger difference was visible: flatter lower belly, no nightly food baby. Digestion stayed regular, not explosive, just predictable. So, does **detox tea make you poop**? In my case, it kept things moving without drama. No cramps, no racing to the restroom, just smoother transit.

I tracked side notes:

* Skin looked clearer, maybe because I was better hydrated.
* Morning brain fog lifted.
* I was drinking more water overall, which never hurts.

**Side effects and safety check**

I had zero negative **Lulutox tea side effects**. Reddit threads mention mild headaches early on if you forget to hydrate, so keep a bottle handy. If you take meds or have medical issues, talk to a professional first. From what I can tell, the formula is gentle and avoids harsh stimulants, so **is Lulutox tea safe**? It was for me, but bodies vary.

**Buying without getting duped**

I saw copycat listings on random sites that looked sketchy. I ordered mine from the [**official page**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JD9JH6F/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST) and it arrived in five days. They email brewing tips and an ingredient sheet, which felt transparent. If that link ever dies, here is the backup I bookmarked: [**alt link**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JD9JH6F/?uid=34821&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST). Same discount, same shipping time.

**Final verdict**

*Did Lulutox detox tea make me poop?* Yes, but in the normal, healthy-bowel-movement sense, not the sprint-to-the-bathroom sense.  
*Did it help with bloating and energy?* Absolutely.  
*Did it melt fat overnight?* No, but paired with sensible eating and daily walks, the pounds came off naturally.

If you want a balanced approach to resetting digestion without extreme measures, **Lulutox detox tea does it work,** at least it did for me. Keep expectations realistic, drink water, and listen to your body.

1lf4reo,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1lf4reo/fiction_made_me_his_wife_novel_when_freya_stone/,"Fiction Made Me His Wife Novel When Freya Stone woke up, her head felt like it was exploding. She rubbed her head and sat up, only to be scared back down by the scene before her.","**Chapter 1 Awakening in the Novel**

When Freya Stone woke up, her head felt like it was exploding. She rubbed her head and sat up, only to be scared back down by the scene before her.

In front of her were rows upon rows of bags, and the floor was covered with countless clothes. Lying on the bed, she felt as if she were in a sea of bags and clothes. Except for the small empty space beneath her, there was almost no place to step.

*Didn't I die?*

Freya stared blankly at the ceiling, her mind recalling the despair she felt when she was stabbed to death by a thug, the pain in her heart making it almost impossible to breathe. Indeed, she had died, absolutely no mistake about it.

But the scene before her eyes wasn't fake either.

*So, did I time-travel?*

Speaking of time-travel, Freya felt that this scene looked very familiar. *Where have I seen a room like this before, packed with bags and clothes?*

As she thought about it, Freya suddenly widened her eyes and sat up from the bed again...

*That novel!*

Two days before her death, Freya had read a novel titled ""I Love You, My Mr. Lavette."" In the book, there was a minor character who didn't even qualify as a supporting female character, and she had the same name as Freya. That was why she remembered it so clearly.

This minor character was the wife of the novel's antagonist, a brainless gold-digger who only knew how to spend money. Her existence was meaningless, serving only as a blemish on the antagonist's otherwise perfect life.

At the end of the novel, it was mentioned that the antagonist had been defeated by the male lead. The final scene depicted the minor character lying in a newly rented room, surrounded only by the bags and clothes she had bought in the past, the last things the antagonist owned.

Freya still remembered that passage.

""The only things Louis had left were his wife lying in the bedroom and her expensive bags and clothes. But Louis himself knew that this woman, who never paid him any attention except when she wanted money, would soon leave him with her bags and clothes. He had failed, and he would end up with nothing.""

*So, I've time-traveled to after the novel ended?*

Freya looked around, her eyes aching from the overwhelming array of colors. But if converted into money, it would still be a considerable sum for her.

She was grateful for the minor character's past habit of shopping sprees, as these items were now left behind. If she had bought houses or cars, they would have been frozen or seized by now.

Rubbing her temples, Freya thought of the now-bankrupt antagonist and sighed deeply. The antagonist's character, family background, and even abilities were impeccable. It was just that he was in competition with the male lead in business, and with the female lead's help, the male lead had foreseen all his plans, leading to his bankruptcy. He was quite an unfortunate fellow.

The reason the minor character had married Louis was purely because her grandpa had once saved his grandpa. Out of gratitude, Louis had married her after she became an orphan.

The minor character was beautiful but only cared about money. After marrying Louis, she had no sense of being a wife and only spent the money he gave her on shopping. The two of them lived separate lives, and now that Freya had taken over, she didn't have to worry about being exposed or Louis giving her a hard time.

Looking at the bags and clothes around her, Freya sighed again. This was probably the most luxury goods she had ever seen in her life, but unfortunately, she had no interest in these things.

Moreover, these items belonged to Louis. The money he gave was out of care for his wife. She wasn't his wife, and now that she was here, she couldn't just take the remaining wealth and leave while Louis was at his lowest point. Besides, the minor character had no relatives, and Freya had just arrived here with nowhere to go.

**Chapter 2 Organizing Things**

Thinking about the description of Louis in the novel, Freya felt that no matter what, she couldn't abandon him at this moment. In the past, Louis had provided for the minor character, and now that she had taken her place, Freya believed it was her duty to do the same. She could work to support him. If she were to leave, it would only be after he had his own income or career.

After spending some more time sorting out her memories and thoughts, Freya got up and began tidying up. The minor character had been completely clueless about household chores. Two days ago, upon learning that Louis had gone bankrupt and that she would no longer receive money, she had done nothing but cry and drown her sorrows in alcohol. All the things she had brought with her were haphazardly piled up in the two-bedroom apartment Louis had recently rented.

It was a miracle Louis had such a good temper and didn't hold it against her. Otherwise, anyone would have been driven mad by the chaos of this place, where there was barely any room to step.

Organizing all of this was a massive task. It took Freya a full three hours to stuff everything into a corner of her room. The pile now reached the ceiling, with over a hundred bags and more than eighty sets of clothes.

Looking at the mountain of luxury goods she had stacked up, Freya wished she could trade the clothes for more bags. After all, bags were easier to sell than clothes.

When she woke up, it was two in the afternoon. Now, it was already past five. Feeling her stomach growling, Freya rummaged through the bag on the coffee table by the door and found her ID card, bank card, and a few hundred dollars.

She didn't even bother checking the kitchen. Louis and the minor character had just moved in a couple of days ago, and neither of them knew how to cook. The kitchen was undoubtedly empty. She would have to find food herself.

She could have ordered takeout, but after some thought, Freya decided against it. The apartment had only been roughly tidied up, and she still needed to clean it properly later. The tables and chairs probably weren't clean, and she didn't want to eat while inhaling dust.

Although the apartment Louis had rented was small, the neighborhood was quite nice, with good security and a convenient location. There were plenty of restaurants downstairs. Freya casually ate a bowl of noodles and, remembering the scarce supplies she had seen in the bathroom, stopped by a nearby supermarket on her way back. She returned carrying a bag of daily necessities. She had also bought items for Louis, choosing colors and styles based on what she remembered he preferred.

Back at the apartment, she started cleaning again. When she opened the door to Louis's room, she found that aside from a few more items on the bookshelf and desk, the room only contained a bed and a few essentials. Freya sighed helplessly. It was hard to imagine how this man, who had grown up in luxury, could endure such a life now.

There wasn't much to organize in his room. After a quick look, she wiped the desk, arranged the documents neatly, and then closed the door, returning to the living room to continue cleaning other areas.

By the time she was finally done, it was already ten.

After washing up, Freya set her late-night snack on the coffee table in the living room, planning to relax and enjoy the food she had brought back.

Just as she unwrapped the food and was about to take her first bite, the sound of the front door opening echoed through the room. Freya looked up and met a pair of eyes as dark and clear as glass.

**Chapter 3 First Meeting**

The owner of those eyes looked at Freya expressionlessly, his gaze sweeping across the room unintentionally. A flicker of surprise flashed in his eyes before his attention returned to Freya.

At the same time, Freya took in the man before her. He was extraordinarily handsome, living up to the lavish praise the author had used to describe him. However, his striking appearance was overshadowed by his aura. For the first time, Freya understood how someone could resemble an ancient nobleman, someone who could effortlessly transform into a dashing swordsman with a sword, a commanding general on the battlefield, or a dignified scholar with a book in hand, making others feel ashamed of their own inadequacies.

Unconsciously gripping the fork in her hand, Freya felt a wave of nervousness. She was an imposter, after all.

*Is it possible that someone like him wouldn't notice something's off about his wife?*

His eyes seemed as though they could see through everything.

""Did you hire a cleaner? Do you still have enough money?"" His voice was like the clinking of jade, carrying a hint of husky magnetism.

Freya instinctively shook her head and murmured, ""No, I cleaned it myself.""

""You cleaned it?"" He was visibly surprised.

""Yes, I did it myself,"" Freya replied, taking a deep breath and looking up. He was staring at her with clear astonishment in his eyes.

Their gazes met for a moment before he was the first to look away. He took off his coat and hung it on the hook by the door. ""Do you still have enough money?""

""Yes, I do. What about you?"" Freya asked reflexively. He looked at her in surprise again, then replied gently, ""I do.""

After that, silence fell between them. Louis glanced at the food Freya was eating on the table and suddenly said, ""I'm sorry.""

""What?"" Freya was caught off guard. Following his gaze, she quickly shook her head. ""No, there's nothing for you to apologize for.""

Louis walked over and sat down on the couch across from her. He spoke carefully, ""The property issues have mostly been resolved. All the movable and immovable assets under our names have been seized. Although there's nothing left, we don't have any debts either, so you don't need to worry about that. I still have thirty thousand dollars left. After everything is settled, I'll start earning money as soon as possible. Your card should have sixty thousand dollars on it. I've already paid six months' rent for this apartment. If you want a divorce, I'll give you another twenty thousand, and you can stay here until you find a place to rent.""

Freya knew that Louis had already gone above and beyond for his wife. Their total assets now amounted to only ninety thousand dollars. What he meant was that if they divorced, he was willing to give her eighty thousand dollars and allow her to stay here. He certainly wouldn't take the bags and clothes, which meant he would be left with only the apartment and ten thousand dollars.

Seeing her silence, Louis added, ""From now on, I'll set aside a portion of my earnings for you every month. At least three thousand, okay? I'm not sure about the future, so that's all I can promise for now. If I ever manage to rebuild my fortune, I'll compensate you.""

Freya quickly shook her head. Louis fell silent, his entire demeanor quieting. Realizing that her gesture might have been misunderstood, she immediately explained, ""No, I don't want a divorce, and I don't need you to give me money. Don't worry, I still have enough to get by. I've accepted the situation and will spend more carefully from now on. I'll also earn money myself. You don't need to put so much pressure on yourself. Ordinary families don't actually spend that much in a month.""

**Chapter 4 Her Cooking Skill**

""You don't want a divorce? But yesterday, you said..."" Louis was caught off guard by her response.

Freya remembered that the minor character had indeed been furious yesterday, calling Louis useless and threatening to divorce him. Her face stiffened. ""Oh, that was because I was drunk. I didn't mean it. I've thought it through now. I can't divorce you at a time like this. Since we're married, I won't leave you now. From now on, I'll take responsibility for our life together. You don't need to worry about me. I can support myself, and maybe even support you.""

When she looked up, Louis was staring at her with a strange expression. She knew her reaction was a complete departure from how the minor character had behaved before, and for a moment, she didn't know what else to say.

""If you don't want a divorce, then forget it. Just let me know whenever you change your mind,"" Louis said, not pressing further. He rubbed his temples, exhaustion evident in his features, and then got up to go wash up in the bathroom.

Freya awkwardly lowered her head and continued eating. She heard Louis pause for a few seconds after entering the bathroom, probably noticing how drastically different it looked after her cleaning. Then, the sound of running water started as he began washing up.

By the time she finished eating, Louis had also finished washing up. Contrary to Freya's expectation of another awkward encounter, he emerged fully dressed, his unfairly handsome face as composed as ever. He thanked Freya politely and headed to his bedroom, pausing briefly to say, ""You should get some rest too,"" before closing the door.

Staring at the empty food container in front of her, Freya scratched her head, feeling as though she were in a dream. After organizing her thoughts once more, she went to wash up, then returned to her room and opened her laptop. She applied to open a personal store on an online secondhand marketplace before shutting down the computer and going to bed.

The next morning, Freya woke up at her usual time of six-thirty. After a moment of thought, she reluctantly got up, tidied the ingredients she had bought the day before, and started brewing coffee. Then, she went downstairs to buy breakfast.

When she returned, Louis had just stepped out of his room.

Even early in the morning, the man looked as composed and graceful as ever, with no trace of the exhaustion from staying up late. Hearing the noise, he looked up and, upon seeing the breakfast in Freya's hands, rubbed his eyes as if doubting what he was seeing.

""Good morning,"" Freya said, holding up the breakfast. ""I bought some food and made coffee. Go wash up, and it'll be ready.""

Without waiting for a response, she went to the kitchen to check on the coffee, ignoring Louis' bewildered expression behind her.

Since both of them had stayed up late the previous night, Freya had brewed coffee to help with their fatigue. By now, the coffee was almost ready. She poured two cups into the porcelain mugs she had bought the day before, arranged the breakfast on plates, and boiled some eggs while preparing a simple salad. By the time Louis came out of the bathroom, the table was set with what could barely be called a hearty breakfast.

The scene looked warm and inviting, but Louis felt none of it. He knew his wife well, married for over three years, she had never shown any talent for housework or cooking. Her only skill was shopping, and the background check before their marriage hadn't mentioned any of these abilities either.

*Was she just pretending this whole time?*

The calculating look in Louis' eyes was unmistakable. Freya quickly offered the excuse she had prepared the night before. ""Before, we had maids and helpers, so I never had to do anything. Now that it's just the two of us and we're short on money, it doesn't make sense to keep eating out. My cooking isn't amazing, but it's edible. If you don't mind, you can come home for meals from now on.""

**Chapter 5 Keeping Herself Busy**

""So, back then, when Grandpa asked if you could cook, were you lying to him?"" Louis sat across from Freya, took a sip of coffee after saying this.

Freya was stunned. *What? There was such a thing?*

She quickly brushed it off. ""My skills are nothing compared to the maid's. At the time, I thought Grandpa was used to eating delicacies, so I didn't want to embarrass myself.""

This reason was barely passable, Louis nodded. ""Actually, the taste was not bad.""

Louis drank his coffee quickly, but only ate one bun and a little of the rest. Freya looked at his not-so-slim figure, thinking such a small amount of food couldn't possibly fill him up. Noticing his elegant eating manners, she suddenly realized that asking a man, who since childhood has been accustomed to fine dining, to eat simple food was indeed asking too much of him.

*Well, even when a big shot hits rock bottom, he can't just turn into a regular person.*

She felt this kind of life was normal, but for Louis, every day was probably torture. Unfortunately, she couldn't afford to provide him with delicacies, so Louis had to make do with mundane food.

After the meal, Louis offered to help take things to the kitchen, but Freya quickly stopped him. ""It's okay, I'll take care of it. I can do the dishes, you go ahead with whatever you need to do.""

Louis put down the plate and fork. ""I haven't finished dealing with the business, I'll probably be back tonight. Don't worry about me, call me if you need anything.""

""Alright, go do what you need to do.""

Once Louis left, Freya finally felt at ease. Even though the man had toned down his aura, the noble air about him was unmistakable, and his imposing presence was still faintly visible. If Freya hadn't met many such people before, she might not have been able to handle it.

Today, she had a lot to do. Not only did she need to furnish the house, but she also had to photograph those bags and clothes to sell online. With so many items, she estimated selling them all could fetch over a million, providing Louis with some initial capital.

Also, she needed to research the web novels of this world and consider returning to her old profession.

Freya was a web novel writer. Her university major was interior design, but after graduation, she didn't want to pursue it as her main career, so she turned to writing. Occasionally, she took on freelance design jobs for extra cash, sometimes helped write promotional materials, and also did handicrafts. She had multiple streams of income and had been living quite comfortably.

After washing the plates and forks, Freya walked around the house, made a list of things to buy, and then went out. She never enjoyed shopping, so she bought what she needed and returned quickly. After putting everything in place, she started photographing the bags and clothes.

After a busy morning, she had only managed to photograph a little over twenty items. At noon, she cooked herself a bowl of noodles and, following her old habit, took a nap until two-thirty in the afternoon., then got up to continue photographing.

By the end of the afternoon, she had only finished photographing the bags and was utterly exhausted. In her past life, she only knew how to shop, spending all day buying things, eating out instead of at home, and refusing to eat much to maintain her figure, leaving her body quite weak.

In the evening, she had oatmeal and reheated the bread from the morning. Freya decisively went back to her bedroom to read web novels. Physical activities were too much for today, so she could only engage in mental labor.

**Chapter 6 Intersection**

Nearly two hours later, Freya clapped her hands in satisfaction and downed the coffee on her desk in one go. The web novels in this world were a bit behind compared to her original world, meaning she could rewrite all the stories she had written before but in an even better way. This was absolutely delightful.

She had carefully studied two websites and decided to publish on both. As long as her submissions were accepted, she would update diligently and consistently, then she wouldn't have to worry about making a living.

Just as she was about to create a new file, she suddenly heard the sound of the front door opening. Freya hesitated for a moment before jumping out of bed and shuffling out in her slippers. She had no choice. This morning, she realized the front door hadn't been locked last night. Louis was probably too used to living in a villa, where security was taken care of for him, and had forgotten that doors in this kind of place needed to be locked manually.

Louis paused in the middle of hanging up his coat when he saw her come out.

Freya greeted him while hurrying to lock the door. ""You're back. I only noticed this morning that the door wasn't locked last night. In a villa, there's security, but here, if you don't lock the door at night, a thief could pry it open in no time.""

""Oh, got it.""

The two of them were basically strangers. Freya tried to make conversation. ""Have you eaten?""

""I have.""

""I bought some more household essentials today. If you need anything, just let me know, and I'll pick it up next time.""

""No, I'm good for now.""

End of conversation.

*What more is there to say?*

Freya thought for three seconds before decisively retreating. ""Alright, if there's nothing else, I'll head back to my room. Call me if you need anything.""

""Okay.""

Only after Freya closed the door did Louis take a proper look around. He even strolled through the kitchen and bathroom. The apartment had noticeably more items today, making it feel much more lived-in. There was even a small potted plant on the windowsill. The dining table now had tissues, a tea set, and a vase of flowers. Even the toothpick holder was a cartoon character. Everything was so lively and full of personality.

The corners of his lips curled into a smile, unreadable in its meaning. Glancing toward Freya's room, he found it amusing. This woman actually planned to settle in here, as if she had become a completely different person.

Freya had no idea what he was thinking. She was too busy organizing her laptop. Back in high school, the original owner of this body had worked hard and gotten into a top university, but once there, she had mostly coasted through. Her computer skills were awful, and this laptop was unbearably slow. She needed to clean up the system and see what kind of things the original owner had left behind.

As she browsed through the files, she came across a folder labeled ""Photos."" Inside, there were multiple subfolders. Most contained the original owner's selfies, some had pictures of her parents, others had snapshots from college events, assignments, and saved images. The last folder's name was just a string of random characters.

Freya clicked on it, and it was full of photos of the original owner with some guy. The man looked like the typical high-flying professional, handsome, but with a face Freya instantly disliked. He had the look of a cunning scumbag, especially when he smiled. It gave off an unsettling, insincere vibe.

Seeing how close the two of them were in the photos, Freya felt her soul tremble. She quickly checked the dates. Thankfully, they were all from before the marriage. That had scared the life out of her.

Keeping a few less intimate pictures, she immediately deleted the rest. It all came back to her now. This guy was the original owner's college boyfriend, a rich second-generation heir. But they had broken up ages ago. There was no reason to keep these anymore.

Good thing Louis wasn't the type to be petty. If he had found these, it would have been a ticking time bomb.

**Chapter 7 Doubts**

By the time Freya was done tinkering with her laptop, it was nearly eleven o'clock. She yawned, then flopped onto the bed and went straight to sleep.

The next morning, she woke up even earlier than the day before. Instead of going out to buy breakfast, she made an omelet, poured some milk, and prepared two small side dishes. She had forgotten to toast bread yesterday, so this would have to do.

By the time Louis got up, Freya had almost finished preparing breakfast. He came out after washing up, just in time to eat.

""You can make omelets?"" Louis looked at the dish in front of him, fluffy eggs filled with green peas, diced ham, beef, and cheese, once again adjusting his perception of Freya.

""Yeah, I don't cook a lot, but I can manage simple dishes. It's nothing fancy, just edible. Don't expect too much.""

Louis took a bite and nodded. ""Not bad, it's actually pretty good.""

""As long as you like it."" Freya didn't even look up, already thinking about her plans for the day.

""I'll be coming home for lunch today,"" Louis suddenly said.

""What?"" Freya quickly responded, ""Oh, okay. What do you want to eat?""

""Whatever you make, I'll eat. But I'd like spaghetti.""

""Got it."" Freya thought for a moment. ""How about pork ribs, scrambled eggs, salad, and mushroom soup? Will that be enough for you?""

""Should be.""

""Alright then, go do your thing. Lunch will be ready a little after twelve.""

After finishing breakfast, Louis tidied himself up and left. As usual, Freya cleaned up the dishes.

Once outside the apartment complex, Louis got into a car parked by the entrance. His former assistant, Derek Trent, who was also the childhood friend his grandpa had chosen to accompany him growing up, was behind the wheel. As soon as Louis settled in, Derek handed him a paper bag.

""Louis, breakfast from The Baker's.""

""No need, I already ate. Freya made breakfast.""

What?"" Derek froze mid-motion, still holding the bag. ""Ms. Stone can cook?""

""I only just found out myself. Yesterday, she made coffee, and salad, which I thought was shocking enough. When she said she could cook, I figured she was just bragging. But this morning, she actually made an omelet. And when I told her I'd be back for lunch, she said she'd cook that too.""

Derek frowned. ""She's not plotting something, is she? Weren't you two basically living separate lives before? She never knew how to do anything. Oh, right, wasn't she pushing for a divorce? I already looked into the process, but now she's completely silent about it.""

""She says she's not divorcing anymore. She's accepted this life, plans to live properly, and even wants to earn her own money so I don't have too much pressure."" Louis leaned back against the seat, his tone unreadable.

""Wait, is Ms. Stone suddenly feeling bad for you? Planning to stick with you through thick and thin? If that's the case, she's not as bad as we thought.""

Louis spoke flatly. ""She did nothing in college, spent the last two years of our marriage doing nothing but shopping, said she wanted a divorce one day, then changed her mind the next. What do you think?""

Derek didn't know how to respond. After a moment, he said, ""Well, people say you see a person's true nature in tough times. Maybe she just had a change of heart. You know, some people don't realize who they are until they go through hardship. We've seen plenty of people turn their backs on you lately, maybe Ms. Stone is just someone whose character only shows under pressure.""

""Maybe."" Louis didn't seem too concerned. ""Let's go. She won't change anything in the grand scheme of things. We'll just wait and see.""",1,1750318297.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

""Reina, you're back. I made your favorite roasted ribs. Wash your hands and come to have some.""

When Reina Blake's mother, Amy Penn's loving, caring voice rang out, she looked aside at Ernest Roland, her stepfather, with a strange feeling deep down.

In order not to upset Ernest, Reina's stepfather, and Lizeth Roland, Ernest's daughter, Amy was always cold and strict to Reina when Ernest was around. Amy in fact treated maids better than Reina.

Reina wondered why Amy was acting so weird today.

In fact, after so many years, Reina had gotten used to Amy's attitude toward her. It was Amy's second marriage, and she married Ernest with Reina, who was seen as a burden, no less. Life after marrying into the Roland family for Amy wasn't easy. Ernest was a very cold and selfish man, and he had become even colder to Amy after his business thrived these years.

""Mom,"" Reina called out softly.

There was a flicker of unease in Amy's eyes, but Reina didn't see it.

Amy's sudden kindness made Reina have the urge to cry. She walked to the bathroom, washed her hands, and went into the dining room.

Amy and Ernest were already seated.

""Won't we wait for Lizeth?"" Lizeth was Reina's stepsister.

""No. Let's eat,"" Amy said and then lowered her head to eat.

Reina had had the feeling that Amy was very strange today. Sure enough, after she had a few bites, Amy opened her mouth again.

""Reina, your father's company has been having a financial crisis, and he would like your help.""

Reina frowned and looked at Amy. ""How am I supposed to help?""

""Do you remember Mr. Dewar? Gilbert Dewar, the man who came to your father's birthday party this year. He is deeply attracted to you. He says that as long as you marry him, the two families will be in-laws, and he will help our family through the financial crisis...""

Amy's voice was getting lower and lower.

Meanwhile, Reina's face was getting paler and paler.

The ribs made by Amy were always delicious, yet Reina felt that the rib that was in her mouth was bitter.

Of course, she remembered Gilbert.

It was a middle-aged man in his early fifties who was chubby with squinted eyes. Everyone could tell that he was a nasty man indulging his own sexual proclivities. When Ernest introduced him at the party that night, he held Reina's hand and wouldn't let go. She was so angry that she washed her hands a dozen times that night.

And now, Amy wanted her to marry Gilbert.

""He is in his fifties and is old enough to be my father.""

""Older men are better at doting on their wives. Besides, Mr. Dewar has no children. If you can get him a son after you marry him, I'm sure the Dewar family will be yours,"" Ernest said with a smile.

Reina thought, ""If he is that good, why don't you ask Lizeth to marry him?""

Reina sneered silently. Instead of looking at Ernest, she looked at Amy. ""Mom, is that what you think as well?""

""Reina, Mr. Dewar says that he will treat you right..."" Amy said. Although she felt that it was unfair to Reina, she had always been obedient to Ernest. Therefore, she persuaded Reina, ""If it weren't for Ernest, you and I would have no one to lean on, and we wouldn't have had such a carefree life. Now that the Roland family is in trouble, we have to help him.""

Reina thought, ""A carefree life?

""I would have been better off if Mom hadn't married Ernest.

""When Dad died, he left us tens of thousands of dollars in savings and two houses. Mom married into the Roland family, gave all our savings to the Roland family, and sold a big house to help Ernest with his business.

""Among all these years of my life at the Roland's place, I have to suffer with poor food and clothing, and I always have to put up with Ernest's disgusted look and Lizeth's bullying.

""And now, they are so over the line that they want to ruin my lifelong happiness?""

Angrily, Reina stood up and looked Ernest and Amy in the eye. ""I won't marry him. Go ask Lizeth to marry him. She is the daughter of the Roland family!""

""You have no choice!"" Ernest said furiously. ""Lock her up. I've discussed with Mr. Dewar already. I will take her ID card to get her marriage certificate with Mr. Dewar tomorrow, and then I'll send both her and the marriage certificate to the Dewar's place.""

After he finished speaking, three servants rushed at Reina at the same time, grabbed her, and locked her in the room.

**Chapter 2 The Biggest Jerk**

Reina thought, ""Do you really think you can lock me up by this?""

She looked at the locked door and bit her lip. She found a small screwdriver from the toolbox under the bed, removed the window cover, jumped out, took her ID card, and headed to the café to find Victor Webster, her boyfriend.

She had to get married before being forced to marry Gilbert by Ernest.

She figured that everything would be solved as long as she married Victor.

She looked through the glass and saw Victor, who had already arrived. There was at last a smile on her pure, pretty face.

She walked toward him quickly.

Although she and Victor had only been going out for half a year, they were in a very stable relationship.

Proposing to him might seem abrupt, yet her hands were tied.

""Victor, I have something to say to you."" The nineteen-year-old girl wanted to act calm, yet after all, she was proposing to her boyfriend, which was a big deal. She couldn't help but blush a bit uncontrollably.

As she was nervous, she missed the solemn look on Victor's face.

""Reina, I have something to say to you too.""

""What? OK. You first.""

""Reina, I'm getting engaged to Chloe."" Victor's words made Reina's mind blank.

She stared at him without moving, forgetting to react.

A second ago, she was thinking of asking him to marry her.

She simply felt glad that she didn't propose out loud, or she would have humiliated herself.""

""I'm sorry, Reina. My family arranged the marriage for me a long time ago. There's a lot of competition in our family, and if I don't marry Chloe, I'll be out of the line of succession. Reina, believe me. The only woman I love is you. Wait for me, and I swear I'll marry you after five years when I have real power.""

Although Victor apologized, he didn't seem very guilty.

""Are you done? What a coincidence. I came to you today to break up with you!"" Reina looked at him and tried to force a proud smile.

She was betrayed one after another, which caught her off guard, yet she wouldn't allow herself to look like a loser.

She was glad that she didn't love Victor that much.

Victor's natural sense of superiority made him unable to accept that Reina would offer to break up with him, and his face darkened. ""Do you have to be this stubborn, Reina? Think about who you are. Who are you to marry into the Webster family? I promise that I will marry you one day, which is the best thing that you can ever expect. Think about it!""

Once again, Reina realized how cheeky one could be. ""Victor, I've seen jerks before, yet you are the biggest, cheekiest jerk I've met. Do you think you're Prince Charming that everyone wants?""

""You just don't know what's good for you, right, Reina?"" Victor growled through gritted teeth.

A trace of sadness flashed across Reina's eyes.

Today was such a bad day for her, as she was betrayed by her mother and her boyfriend.

She took a deep breath and stared at him coldly. ""Victor, you're too much of a jerk that I can handle.""

She stood up and picked up the coffee the waiter had just brought her.

Victor's expression changed, as he thought she was going to throw the coffee in his face.

She looked at him and suddenly was amused.

So, she smiled sarcastically, ""Rest assured. It'll be such a waste throwing such great coffee on you.""

Then she took a few sips of the coffee, took out her purse, paid for her cup of coffee, and turned to walk away.

\*\*\*

Around the corner, Hugh Walton curled up his thin lips. He said, his clear voice carrying a teasing smile, ""She seems cuter now than she was twelve years ago.""

Arturo Finn, his assistant, followed his gaze, and then there was an awkward expression on Arturo's face. He thought, ""Cute? Really?""

Hugh ignored Arturo's expression and said casually, ""Come to think of it, I'm of marriageable age, too.""

Arturo was stunned.

He thought, ""What's going on?

""Mr. Walton, you change the subject too quickly... Don't you think?""

**Chapter 3 Too Handsome to Be True**

An hour later, Reina walked into one of the city's largest matchmaking agencies.

""I'm looking for a husband. He has to be between 20 and 30 years old with good looks and good conduct. He must have no bad habits. It's fine if he's poor without money, cars, or properties. As long as he can go get the marriage certificate with me now...""

Before she finished speaking, the staff who was answering the phone had already put the phone down. The staff glanced at Reina's name on her profile and then took her hand with great enthusiasm. ""Ms. Blake, right? Have you got your ID card?""

Reina was stunned. ""Yes...""

""Great. We have just the right guy for you. His name is Hugh Walton, and he's eager to get a marriage certificate as well. He's right outside the door. I'll take you there!""

Therefore, Reina was speed-dated in 30 seconds and enthusiastically stuffed into a car by the staff.

A pleasant, deep male voice sounded beside her.

""Hi. I'm Hugh Walton.""

He was wearing a dark blue shirt, looking clean and fresh, with a noble and dignified temperament.

He put his hands gently on his legs. His black trousers made his fingers look unusually slender, fair, and bony.

His features were so stunning that they seemed to have been favored and carved by fate.

He had a prominent nose, and he was now looking at her with a smile, curling up the corners of his thin lips.

His deep eyes were so bright that it was like they were filled with stars in the sky, and others simply couldn't look away.

He was handsome.

He was so handsome that Reina couldn't help but stutter, ""Hello... I ... I'm Reina Blake.""

She thought, ""I have trouble breathing, as he is so good-looking.

""Are all the matchmaking agencies this good these days?

""In fact, I had prepared myself for the worst before I came here. I could live with anyone who wasn't completely nasty.

""How can this man be so handsome?

""He's too handsome to be true. Am I in a dream?""

""Shall we go and get the certificate?"" Hugh looked at Reina, who was adorable because of obvious nervousness, and smiled gently.

""OK. Sure. But you don't know me. Are you sure it's OK?"" In fact, she thought that marrying her would be a great loss for him.

So, she reminded him kindly.

""I'm glad a pretty girl like you is willing to marry me. After all, as a man, regarding this aspect..."" Hugh paused and looked at his legs.

He wanted to say that he couldn't walk, yet his words and seeing that he was looking at his thigh gave Reina the wrong idea. She thought he meant sexually and said, ""It's fine. I don't mind that. In fact, Platonic love is wonderful.""

Hugh was surprised when hearing her words.

The smile in his eyes grew bigger.

He realized that she had gotten the wrong idea, as he never said that he wanted Platonic love. Yet he explained nothing.

He said slowly, ""My legs were hurt, and I can't go anywhere without a wheelchair. Of course, the doctor said I might recover.""

Reina looked at his legs.

As they were sitting in the car, she hadn't noticed it till now.

""Do you mind?"" he asked, his voice gentle.

She thought, ""Do I?

""Of course, I don't!

""Given my circumstances and the fact that I have to get married today, I cannot ask for more when I find a man like him.

""Besides, I always fall for pretty faces. If I get to live with him every day, I'll be in such a great mood.""

Reina looked at Hugh's face, who was stunningly pretty, and shook her head firmly. ""No.""

Hugh smiled even more as he watched her determined expression. ""You're a nice girl,"" he said.

She was stunned and figured that she should return the favor now that he was praising her.

Therefore, the cute Reina said, ""You're a nice gentleman.""

Arturo, who was driving, couldn't help but chuckle, causing even his shoulders to shudder a bit.

**Chapter 4 Her Handsome Hubby**

It was an hour later.

Reina and Hugh were standing at the entrance to City Hall, each holding a certificate.

Reina looked down at the stamped marriage certificate, feeling great as if she had gotten her revenge.

She had been a pushover for 11 years, and finally, she fought back today. She would love to see the look on Ernest, her dear stepfather's face when he saw the marriage certificate.

Everyone else thought that they had her in control and that she must not dare or be able to say no to them. Yet she was determined to tell them that she wasn't someone to be bullied.

Yet for now, she remembered that her ""husband"" was right next to her. Though it felt unreal, he was indeed her husband. ""Are we ... married?""

Hugh looked up, and there was a smile on his handsome face. ""Yes, honey.""

His voice was deep, mellow, and textured. When he said the word ""honey"", he said it slowly and there seemed to be affection carried in his voice. Reina felt that her ears were burning after hearing his voice.

She finally looked like a shy nineteen-year-old girl. She forced an unnatural smile and stuttered, ""Well...""

She found it hard to call him ""hubby"". Though Hugh was so handsome, and he had already conquered her with his pretty face, she couldn't really call a man she'd known for a few hours her hubby.

""I don't have a house here, so..."" He wanted her to choose a neighborhood.

Reina interrupted him before he could finish his sentence, ""It's fine. Both of us are young. As long as we work hard, we will have a big house to live in one day.""

She thought, ""He's so handsome. If it weren't for the fact that he has no house, no car, and is disabled, he certainly wouldn't need to go to a matchmaking agency.

""Given the critical situation, I'm more than happy to find a man in his condition.

""He is a man who is physically challenged, so I'm sure he has very low self-esteem. As a kind, pretty girl who adores pretty looks, I should try my best to be kind to him and try not to discourage him.""

Hugh was speechless.

It was the fact that he didn't own a place in Hitherville. Because of the big economic case that year, everything in the Walton family was gone, yet that didn't mean that he couldn't afford a place now.

Seeing the strange expression on his face, Reina figured that he must have been rather inferior, so she quickly comforted him, ""You know what? In fact, I hate rich people. I wouldn't have married you if you were with a luxury car and some fancy villa.""

Her soothing words made the corners of Hugh's eyes twitch slightly.

He quietly took out his phone and texted Arturo, ""No need to come over to pick me up.""

Not far away, a black Maybach S62 parked quietly on the side of the road. Meanwhile, Arturo in the car was looking at Hugh's text with a puzzled face.

Then he received the second text from Hugh, saying, ""Cancel the hotel reservation and book a medium-class hotel.""

Soon, Hugh texted him again, ""For now, I am a disabled person with no house, no car, and no money.""

Arturo was shocked.

He thought, ""Is Mr. Walton possessed?

""He got married in a flash. And I can live with that.

""Yet even animals know that when courting, they ought to show how perfect they are. Shouldn't Mr. Walton, as a higher animal, be driving a fancy car and taking Ms. Blake to buy the largest villa in the city at once?

""Also, I never figure out whether Mr. Walton falls in love with her at first sight or simply chooses to sacrifice himself so as to find out the truth back then.""

\*\*\*

After instructing Arturo, Hugh looked at Reina and said tenderly, ""Then, honey, shall we go celebrate our marriage now?""

""Perhaps later. Let me think. Maybe we can have a place after all. My mom and I have a house left by my dad, and I'll go ask my friends whether I can find a good lawyer. In such a way, maybe I can get it back.""

She didn't hold her hopes up, yet now that she had already had a complete fallout with Ernest, she decided to go for it after all. Let alone that she would have a place to live, at least she could hold on to some of the things left by her dad.

""A lawyer?"" There was some change in Hugh's eyes, and he looked at her. ""I do have a friend who is a lawyer. He is very skilled, and it is said that he has never lost a case.""

""Really?"" Reina's eyes lit up when she heard his words. She said excitedly, ""Call your friend and ask for his help then. If I can get my house back, we'll have a place to live in!""

Seeing how thrilled she was, Hugh smiled.

**Chapter 5 Lizeth Can Be the Lucky Woman**

After cutting Amy off a hundred times, Reina walked into the Roland's place briskly.

""Well? Has she picked up?""

""No.""

""Damn girl! She doesn't know what's good for her at all! I'll teach her a great lesson when I see her!""

""How ungrateful. The Roland family has raised her for so long, and this is how she repays us? Can she really bear to see us go bankrupt?""

Reina heard their scolding as soon as she entered the door.

She sneered.

""Reina!"" Lizeth was the first to see Reina enter. She immediately exclaimed in surprise, ""You're back.""

Lizeth thought, ""Who knows? The bitch, Reina, actually comes back herself.""

""You damn girl! You still remember you live here?"" Ernest was always a tyrant at home. When he saw Reina come back, he began to scold her at once.

""Reina, how could you escape by climbing through the window?"" Amy had a disapproving look on her face.

Both Amy and Ernest scolded Reina the second they saw her.

Reina thought, ""I don't mind how Ernest treats me. Yet Amy is my mother!

""What kind of mothers push their daughters into an abyss?""

""Dad, Mom, Reina is back. Don't be mean to her. See? You're scaring her,"" Lizeth said, acting like a spoiled kid, and then walked to Reina. She said to Reina gently, ""Reina, nice to see you back. We're glad you've thought it through. I haven't congratulated you on being about to marry into a rich family. I heard that Mr. Dewar is very rich. In fact, he might be richer than our family. Also, he is good at doting women.""

As Lizeth looked at Reina's pretty, fair, and exquisite face without makeup, a trace of jealousy flashed across her eyes. Then she smiled even more tenderly. She thought, ""So what if Reina is pretty? She ends up marrying Mr. Dewar, that old bastard anyway. I heard someone say that Mr. Dewar is a big fan of torturing pretty girls in bed.

""And as for me? As long as the Roland Group's business thrives, I can marry any young, promising man I want in the future.""

As she spoke, she wanted to put her arms around Reina's, deliberately trying to make it look like they were close to each other.

Yet Reina, disgusted, dodged and looked at her coldly.

Reina thought, ""Lizeth has always been a scheming phony. Even since I got to the Roland's place, I've been plotted against by her either directly or indirectly.

""Yet this time, they won't get their way.""

Reina curled up her lips and smiled.

She was curious. Now that she wouldn't be able to marry Gilbert, would Ernest ask Lizeth, his precious daughter, to marry over for the sake of the company?

Ernest changed his expression and said soothingly and kindly, ""Alright, Reina. The important thing is that you're back. The Roland family didn't raise you for nothing. Reina, get prepared to marry Mr. Dewar. I assure you that you'll have a great life after you marry into the Dewar family.""

Reina calmly listened to them. After they finished, she slowly took out the marriage certificate and put it on the table.

She smiled, ""I'm never as lucky as Lizeth, and this time is no exception. It's a shame that Mr. Dewar is so wealthy, as I'm married already. Lizeth can be the lucky woman.""

Then she looked at the three and enjoyed their expressions.

Lizeth's eyes turned red with anger and fluster when she saw the marriage certificate. She grabbed it from the table and opened it at once. ""What is this? A marriage certificate? Are you married? Who are you married to? It's not Victor, is it?""

She was relieved when she saw that the name on the marriage certificate wasn't Victor.

She was always jealous that Reina and Victor were dating. As far as she was concerned, an ordinary woman like Reina didn't deserve to be with Victor, who was handsome and came from a well-off family.

She was the one worth being together with Victor.

""Stop messing around and trying to fool us with a fake marriage certificate, Reina. How could you get one without your ID card?"" Ernest did not look at the marriage certificate at all. There was a look of contempt in his eyes, and it seemed that he thought Reina was pulling child's tricks.

""So, it's fake. I was wondering how you could marry such a handsome man,"" Lizeth glanced at Hugh's photo on the certificate and sneered.

""You're young and naïve, Reina. Do you think marrying a good-looking young man means a happy life? You're wrong. Men should be judged by their capabilities. Mr. Dewar may be a bit old, yet old men are better at doting on women. Besides, he is rich...""

Ernest persuaded Reina when he saw five men in black suits walk in while surrounding a man in a wheelchair.

The man in the wheelchair was with a stunningly handsome face and an extraordinary temperament.

Reina turned around and saw Hugh. She walked toward him while saying deliberately coquettishly, ""Hubby, you're here finally. My family doesn't believe me when I told them that I'm already married.""",1,1750318199.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

I’m just someone who probably spends more time watching people miss their trains than they do watching their lives unfold. But if I were that camera, I’d probably need therapy.

Every morning between 7:15 and 7:30 AM, two people cross paths like they’re in a meticulously choreographed Telugu rom-com. She’s clearly out of his league; he’s got the charm of a broken vending machine—persistent but questionable. Yet somehow, hope floats. Maybe it’s the humidity.

I've witnessed couples of every permutation—teenagers who mistake the metro platform for a dating app, newlyweds pretending like marriage didn’t just hit them with EMI schedules, and old couples trying to remember if they’re still fighting or if it was just gas. Sometimes it’s even two men or two women. If that sentence made you flinch, maybe spend some time figuring yourself out before judging theirs.

This one guy though… man’s running on vibes and sugar levels unknown to science. He's got the optimism of a morning RJ and the energy of someone who thinks “good vibes only” is a personality type. The girl? She’s probably just trying to catch her train in peace, but fate—or maybe TSRTC’s poor planning—keeps shoving this guy into her timeline.

Maybe it’s love. Maybe it’s just Hyderabad being extra on weekdays.

Either way, I'm not here to predict. I’m not an AI model trained on Shakespearean meet-cutes. I’m just another metro commuter with too much curiosity and too little coffee. But if there's one thing I've learned, it's this:

Life in Hyderabad doesn’t wait. But at Tarnaka Metro Station, love apparently does. Daily. Between 7:15 and 7:30.

🔺You’re constantly tired —even after a full night’s rest
It’s not physical exhaustion, it’s emotional fatigue. The kind that no coffee or nap can fix.

🔺You count down to the weekend by Monday afternoon
Every day feels like a long journey to Friday. You’re not present, just pushing through.

🔺You’ve stopped trying to grow
No more learning, no more curiosity. You do just enough to get by, and the idea of taking on anything extra feels like a burden.

🔺You dread meetings and interactions with your team
Not because you’re introverted—but because you no longer feel connected, heard, or appreciated.

🔺You’re emotionally detached from your work
Whether the project fails or succeeds, you feel numb. You used to care. Now you just shrug and move on.

🔺You fantasize about quitting—often
You’ve Googled “how to resign gracefully” ""how to resign without Plan B""more than once. Maybe even updated your CV... halfway.

🔺You don’t talk about work with pride anymore
You used to tell people what you do with a spark in your voice. Now, you avoid the topic or simply say, “It’s okay.”

🔺The stress outweighs the joy
Every job has its tough moments. But if every moment is tough and the joy is rare, your soul is telling you something.

1lf4kpk,https://www.reddit.com/r/prolife/comments/1lf4kpk/may_i_have_your_help/,May I have your help?,"I am looking for advice.

For anyone tired of arguing about Abortion, some friends and I have written a compelling novel that helps Pro-Life folks make the case through the power of storytelling.

This book is designed to attract (primarily) young female readers and engage them in a fair-minded journey that decimates every argument in favor of abortion (cover below).

For those who can most benefit from reading the book, it needs to be located where it can grab their attention.

One thing I want to do is donate copies to Pro-Life organizations who can gift them to mothers who are deciding. So, if you run or know of any organization open to that, please let me know.

It also strikes me that one of the biggest ways this book can get into the right hands is through Pro-Life friends.

To reach the Pro-Life community, I have thought of posting social media ads. Reddit was one platform that came up because there are highly targeted groups, but feedback also suggests that Reddit users aren't too excited about ads. I'm also looking at Truth Social, which uses Rumble to serve ads. Reviews are saying that Rumble ads are hard to track, so it may not be my best bet out-of-the-box. 

I'm open to using more mainstream advertising, but I have a limited budget, so it needs to work well enough to be self-sustaining. Given how anti-life so many mainstream social platforms tend to be, I have heard that it can be difficult to get Pro-Life messages approved or to get the reach and conversion rates necessary to make a campaign self-sustaining. So, any of you who have successfully used platforms like Facebook or X to promote Pro-Life messages, what advice do you have?

Another idea is to connect with Pro-Life business owners who have retail locations and cater to women, such as coffee shops, beauty salons, health stores or fitness centers. This idea actually excites my quite a bit, because the book would stand out and grab attention from people who typically wouldn't pick up a Pro-Life book. For this idea, who do you know that would be open to this possibility? What advice do you have?

If more details about the book would help with your advice, you can learn more at [https://angelsblood.sbs](https://angelsblood.sbs)

We are currently drinking a mix of decaf and the good stuff due to pregnancy, but usually both prefer just caffeinated beans.

We recently tried a Delonghi Eletta Explore trying to go for the cheaper super auto route but found the temperatures for milk drinks were pretty terrible for us (not hot enough) and returned it. Now thinking of splashing out some more cash to go for something that better meets our needs.

We drink coffee daily 2-3 cups each,  but do not have refined palates. One of us likes coffee on the stronger side, the other weaker. We would prefer a machine with easy maintenance and cleaning options (anything to help ease life with a newborn!) But one that just doesnt need attention all the time would be a nice start. Currently in Aust I have found options for the Jura S8 at roughly $2,200 and the KitchenAid KF8 for $2,000. Any recommendations on the better machine to go for?

I started a new job a couple weeks ago, and there’s a guy in a far more senior position whose office is a couple doors down. Knowing the power dynamics, I sort of keep my head down and mind my own business when passing him sort of thing. 

We had a work social thing a week or so ago, and one of my team members had mentioned he’s super friendly and he’d mentioned to her that I looked cool. Good to know and confidence boost kinda thing but nothing major lol. 

Anyway skip to last Friday, he knocks the door of my office and introduces himself. It’s just us there at that point and he says he’s leaving, and that I’m the last one out. We chat and he leaves. I get up to pack up and there’s two people still working right outside my office. Then the limerence thoughts crept it. Did he come by just to say hi? Am I delusional? Probably the latter lol

We’ve only spoken briefly a couple times, very chill. But yesterday he asked what was on my necklace - and then gently grabbed it to inspect it closer. 

Today I was in the kitchen, checking my phone waiting for the coffee machine sorta thing. I saw him approaching but didn’t wanna play the “OMG hey!” so I didn’t acknowledge. He came past and squeezed my shoulder as he did so. Again, no idea if I am absolutely batshit crazy for thinking this is anything other than polite. But I don’t trust my delusions lol.

Can't tell if I'm decompressing or dissociating anymore.Wake up, work, fake-smile, nod in meetings, drink coffee that barely works anymore, reply to messages I don’t care about. Come home, microwave dinner, pretend I’ll do laundry “later”... crash. Repeat.

I used to have goals. Now I have to-do lists I never finish.

Even simple things feel heavy. Grocery shopping feels like a boss fight. Replying to texts feels like homework. I can't remember the last time I wasn’t tired. And the worst part? You just keep going anyway, like a glitchy robot running low on battery. No big breakdown, just small daily malfunctions.

1lf4bet,https://www.reddit.com/r/JEE/comments/1lf4bet/unusual_jee_dropper/,Unusual Jee Dropper,"So here’s the deal—I'm officially a super-unusual JEE dropper. Took a drop, yeah, but actually studying? Bruh, that’s a whole other vibe. I’m so unfocused in life right now, I’m low-key ashamed of myself. I dropped everything after 10th grade—I was doing great back then. My family (except Papa—his hype levels are infinite) was stoked with my marks. But then came the real issue: 11th and 12th. I basically didn’t study at all. And I don’t even know why I got so sleepy all the time. I literally wasted two years sleeping, and yeah, I know it.

When the 12th result dropped, everyone was shook. My scores tanked. And tbh, I kinda knew it was coming. I’m still eligible to take JEE Main and Advanced, so I decided to drop—no pressure from fam or anyone. They just want me to chase something in life. If not for them, then for my dreams.

But here’s the tea: I’m literally falling asleep all the time. Coffee is my lifeline while studying. I even joined a library. For the first few days, it was lit—no backlogs, consistent grind. But deep down, I knew it wouldn’t last. Then, family came home one day and… well, distraction city. 😑

I’m studying online, and my head and eyes hurt constantly. Doctor gave me prescriptions, but meds won’t do the studying for me. I know I’m not putting in the work I should. Sometimes I feel straight-up useless, like everything’s messed. But then I remember people who believe in me, telling me I’ve got potential. I just have zero clue where that fire went. Where’d my study enthusiasm even disappear to?

I’m struggling—hard. Not because I can’t understand the concepts, but because I can't muster the motivation to even start. I feel super low, almost like I wish everything would just end. My scores are right at cutoff. A friend or two will text, but for the most part, it’s radio silence. I wanna lock myself in a room, grind like crazy, get into a top IIT. That’s the dream, man—just get in, that’s it. Pls, get ur act together, gosh.

I used to be an inspo for my little sis and juniors at school. Now? I’m a ghost. Every time I reflect on how things turned out, I literally cry. Everything’s being wasted and I’m not doing jack squat.

I feel so selfish.

Bye for now, trying to get my focus back.

Thanks for reading.

Don't wanna dump this on my friends—they wouldn’t get it

1lf4aab,https://www.reddit.com/r/flightscheap/comments/1lf4aab/best_airline_to_fly_to_paris_top_options_for_your/,Best Airline to Fly to Paris: Top Options for Your Dream Trip,"The City of Lights beckons, doesn’t it? You’re daydreaming of croissants, café au lait, and strolling along the Seine. But before you can savor those Parisian moments, there’s a crucial step: getting there. And let’s be honest, choosing the right airline can feel like navigating the labyrinthine streets of the Marais blindfolded. There are so many options, so many promises, and frankly, so many potential pitfalls. You want comfort, convenience, maybe even a touch of glamour, but without breaking the bank. Finding the sweet spot can be tricky, a bit like trying to find a quiet corner in the Louvre during peak season. My friends, let’s unpack this together.

The Quest for the Ideal Wingman: Pondering the Best Airline to Fly to Paris
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, you’ve decided Paris is the destination. Excellent choice! Now comes the slightly less enchanting part: sorting through the multitude of airlines vying for your business. This isn’t just about finding the cheapest ticket, although that’s undeniably a juicy part of the equation. It’s about the whole gosh-darn experience. Will you be crammed in like sardines, or will you have a little elbow room to unfold that map of the city? Will the flight attendants greet you with a genuine smile or look like they’d rather be anywhere else? These details, while seemingly small, can significantly impact your overall impression of the trip, even before you land in Charles de Gaulle. We're digging into the nitty-gritty to help you determine, for *you*, the **best airline to fly to Paris**.

### More Than Just a Seat: What Defines a Great Airline Experience to Paris?

Think about it. When you’re locked in an aluminum tube for hours, soaring across the Atlantic, the quality of your experience matters. It's not just about getting from point A to point B. It's about the journey itself. So, what are the key ingredients that transform a potentially grueling flight into something far more palatable?

- **Comfort is King (or Queen, as it Were):** This is a biggie. Legroom, seat width, the ability to recline without completely decapitating the person behind you – these things are paramount, especially on a long haul. A comfortable seat can mean the difference between arriving in Paris feeling refreshed and ready to hit the ground running, or arriving feeling like you’ve been wrestling a badger in a phone booth.
- **Service with a Smile (Hopefully):** The crew can make or break a flight. Friendly, attentive, and efficient service goes a long way. Nobody wants to be greeted by a scowl or feel like they’re inconveniencing the flight attendants by simply asking for a glass of water.
- **In-Flight Entertainment Options:** Are you a movie buff? A serial podcast listener? Good in-flight entertainment can be a lifesaver on a long flight, helping to pass the time and keep boredom at bay.
- **Food and Beverages:** Airline food isn't exactly Michelin-starred cuisine, we all know that. But some airlines do a decidedly better job than others. And having a decent selection of drinks, including that all-important morning coffee, is important.
- **Punctuality and Reliability:** This is non-negotiable. Delays and cancellations are a traveler’s worst nightmare. You want an airline that’s known for getting you where you need to be, on time.
- **Baggage Policies:** Understanding baggage allowances and fees *before* you fly is crucial. Nobody wants to be hit with unexpected charges at the airport.
- **Loyalty Programs and Perks:** If you’re a frequent flyer, the benefits of an airline’s loyalty program can be a significant factor in your decision.

Deconstructing the Contenders: Examining Key Airlines for Your Paris Journey
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that we've got our checklist in hand, let's take a look at some of the major players who can whisk you across the pond to the City of Lights. Each airline has its strengths and weaknesses, and what's the best fit for one traveler might not be for another. It's like picking your favorite flavor of macaron – a highly personal choice.

### The Hometown Hero: Why Air France Might Be Your Go-To for a Truly French Experience

When you think of flying to Paris, Air France is probably one of the first airlines that springs to mind. It makes sense, doesn't it? They are, after all, the national carrier. And there's a certain je ne sais quoi about flying with the airline that calls Paris home.

Before you’ve even landed, you’ve immersed yourself a little bit in the French culture. The announcements are in French and English, the food often has a distinct French flair, and the flight attendants (more often than not) exude that cool, effortless Parisian vibe. It's like a little appetizer for your trip.

Air France often flies into their hub at Charles de Gaulle (CDG), which can be convenient if you have connecting flights within Europe via Air France or their SkyTeam partners. They have a wide network, so you're likely to find direct flights from many major cities.

**However**, they can sometimes be on the pricier side, especially if you book later. Their customer service can be a bit hit or miss depending on the day and the individual you interact with. And while the French food on board is a nice touch, it doesn't always live up to the culinary standards you'll experience on the ground. But hey, it's the thought that counts, right? For a true taste of the French experience from the moment you step on board, Air France is a compelling option, potentially making it the **best airline to fly to Paris** for those prioritizing cultural immersion from the get-go.

### The American Heavyweights: Exploring Delta, American Airlines, and United

The major US carriers – Delta, American Airlines, and United – operate numerous flights to Paris, often from their respective hubs. Opting for a US-based airline can be a good idea if you're a frequent flyer with one of their loyalty programs, as you can earn and redeem miles.

- **Delta Air Lines:** Often lauded for its customer service and reliability, Delta has a strong presence at CDG, partly thanks to its partnership with Air France. This means code-sharing flights and potential benefits when flying on either airline. Delta generally offers a good in-flight experience, with decent entertainment options and reasonably comfortable seats, especially in their Premium Select or Delta One cabins. If you're looking for a reliable option with good connections and a generally positive reputation, Delta is definitely worth considering.
- **American Airlines:** Another major player, American Airlines also has a significant number of flights to Paris. They are part of the Oneworld alliance, which includes British Airways and Iberia, offering connections to other European cities. American's service and in-flight product can vary depending on the aircraft, so it's worth checking the type of plane operating your flight if comfort is a major concern. They've been investing in their premium cabins, which are quite good, but economy can be a bit more of a mixed bag.
- **United Airlines:** As a member of the Star Alliance, United offers connections with airlines like Lufthansa and SWISS. United has also been upgrading their fleet and cabins, with improved seating and entertainment systems on many of their international routes. While their reputation in the past may have been a bit shaky at times, they've made efforts to improve the passenger experience.

Choosing among these three often comes down to price, your departure city, and where your frequent flyer loyalty lies. All three offer decent options for getting across the pond, and they can certainly be contenders for the **best airline to fly to Paris** depending on your specific needs and preferences.

### The Budget-Conscious Conquerors: Finding Affordable Fares to Paris

Okay, let's talk turkey. For many travelers, the bottom line is the driving force behind their airline choice. And thankfully, there are airlines out there that specialize in offering more wallet-friendly fares to Paris.

- **Norwegian Air Shuttle (Though Less Prominent Now):** While Norwegian wasn't always a budget carrier *per se*, they shook things up on the transatlantic routes for a while with competitive pricing. Their model focused on a lower base fare with add-ons for things like checked luggage, meals, and seat assignments. While their long-haul network has shifted a bit, it's worth keeping an eye out for potential deals, though their presence on US-Paris routes has diminished.
- **Smaller European Carriers (with connections):** Sometimes, the cheapest way to get to Paris is by flying a budget carrier from a nearby European city. You might find a great deal on a flight to London, Dublin, or Amsterdam, and then hop on a quick, inexpensive flight or train to Paris. This requires a bit more planning and can add travel time, but the savings can be significant. Think Ryanair, EasyJet, or Vueling for the short hop.

**Important Note:** When considering budget airlines, be meticulous about understanding their fare structure. Those low base fares can quickly get inflated with add-ons for checked bags, carry-on size restrictions, seat selection, and even boarding pass printing at the airport. Always do the math on the total cost before you book.

Beyond the Brochure: Considering the Nuances of Your Travel Style
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Finding the **best airline to fly to Paris** isn't just about comparing prices and checking off boxes. It's about understanding your own travel style and priorities. Are you a minimalist, or do you pack everything but the kitchen sink? Do you crave a luxurious journey, or are you happy with a no-frills experience as long as it's cheap?

### The Luxury Seeker: Who Offers the Most Pampering on the Way to Paris?

If your idea of a perfect flight involves champagne, lie-flat seats, and gourmet meals, then you're looking at the premium cabins. While pretty much every major airline offers business and first class, some do it better than others.

- **Air France La Première:** Their first-class product is renowned for its privacy, comfort, and exceptional service. It's an experience, not just a flight.
- **Delta One:** Delta's business class is consistently rated highly, with comfortable lie-flat seats and good service.
- **United Polaris:** United has significantly invested in its Polaris business class, offering a much-improved experience over their older product.

Of course, flying at the pointy end of the plane comes with a hefty price tag. But if luxury is paramount and your budget allows, these airlines offer a fantastic way to arrive in Paris feeling completely refreshed.

### The Value Hunter: Balancing Cost and Comfort

For most of us, it's about finding that sweet spot between price and comfort. We want a decent experience without feeling like we're draining our savings account just to get there. This is where comparing features within economy class becomes critical.

Look at things like:

- **Seat Pitch:** This is the distance between a point on one seat and the same point on the seat in front of it. A higher seat pitch generally means more legroom.
- **Seat Width:** While airline seats seem to be getting narrower by the year, even an inch or two can make a difference in comfort.
- **Entertainment System Quality and Selection:** A good screen and a varied library of movies and TV shows can be a lifesaver.
- **Power Outlets or USB Ports:** Essential for keeping your devices charged during a long flight.

Reading reviews from other travelers is incredibly helpful here. Websites like Skytrax and SeatGuru offer invaluable insights into what flying with specific airlines on specific aircraft is really like. Don't just take the airline's word for it!

### The Points and Miles Maven: Leveraging Loyalty Programs

If you're deep in the world of airline loyalty programs, your choice might feel a bit pre-determined. Sticking with an airline you have elite status with can unlock a host of benefits that significantly improve your travel experience, even in economy. Think priority boarding, extra baggage allowance, lounge access, and preferential treatment during irregular operations.

- **Star Alliance:** United is your main US carrier.
- **Oneworld:** American Airlines is your main US carrier.
- **SkyTeam:** Delta is your main US carrier, with a strong partnership with Air France.

If you have significant points or miles accumulated, consider which airline allows you to redeem them for flights to Paris with the best value. Sometimes, booking award travel can open up options in higher cabins that would otherwise be out of reach financially.

Navigating the Logistical Labyrinth: Airports and Connections
-------------------------------------------------------------

Getting to Paris involves more than just choosing an airline. You also need to consider the airports you'll be flying into and out of, and if you'll have any connections along the way.

### Charles de Gaulle (CDG) vs. Orly (ORY): Which Airport is Right for You?

Paris is served by two main international airports: Charles de Gaulle (CDG) and Orly (ORY).

- **Charles de Gaulle (CDG):** This is by far the larger of the two and the main hub for international flights, especially those from North America. CDG is located northeast of the city center and can feel a bit spread out and overwhelming, especially to first-time visitors. However, it has excellent transportation links to the city, including the RER train line.
- **Orly (ORY):** Located south of central Paris, Orly primarily handles domestic and European flights, but some international routes do operate there. It's a bit smaller and often considered easier to navigate than CDG. Getting to and from Orly can also be straightforward using the Orlyval connection to the RER.

Your airline choice will likely dictate which airport you fly into. Air France, for example, is heavily based at CDG. Consider the location of your accommodation in Paris and the easiest way to get from the airport to where you'll be staying.

### The Art of the Connection: Making Sense of Layover Logistics

If you're not flying direct, you'll have a connection. The length of your layover, the airport you're connecting through, and the ease of navigating that airport are all factors to consider.

- **Minimum Connection Time:** Be aware of the minimum connection time required by the airline and airport. Cutting it too close can lead to missed flights and unnecessary stress.
- **Airport Size and Layout:** Connecting through a large, complex airport like London Heathrow (LHR) or Amsterdam Schiphol (AMS) might require more transit time than a smaller, easier-to-navigate airport.
- **Airline Alliances:** Connecting flights on partner airlines within the same alliance (Star Alliance, Oneworld, SkyTeam) can often simplify the process, as baggage is usually checked through to your final destination, and you might not need to change terminals.

A good connection can be a smooth, effortless transition. A bad one? A mad dash across the airport, potentially ending in a missed flight and a lot of frustration. Factor this in when comparing options.

The Wildcard Factor: What Else Can Influence Your Choice?
---------------------------------------------------------

Beyond the tangible aspects of comfort, price, and route, there are other, less easily quantifiable factors that can sway your decision when considering the **best airline to fly to Paris**.

### Reputation and Customer Service History

Some airlines just have a better reputation for customer service than others. This can be particularly important if something goes wrong, like a delay or lost luggage. An airline with a reputation for being responsive and helpful can make a stressful situation much more bearable. Look for reviews on independent sites and ask for recommendations from friends and family.

### Environmental Considerations

For some travelers, the environmental impact of flying is a growing concern. Airlines are taking steps to reduce their carbon footprint, from investing in more fuel-efficient aircraft to offering carbon offsetting programs. If this is important to you, research the environmental initiatives of potential airlines.

### Personal Preferences and Past Experiences

Sometimes, it simply comes down to personal preference. Maybe you had a fantastic experience on a particular airline in the past, or perhaps you've had a negative encounter that makes you hesitant to fly with another. Our past experiences, both good and bad, inevitably shape our future choices.

Wrapping it Up: Finding Your Perfect Flight to Paris
----------------------------------------------------

So, after all this consideration, what's the definitive best airline to fly to Paris? The honest answer is, there isn't one single, universally ""best"" airline. It truly depends on your individual priorities, budget, travel style, and where you're flying from.

Here's a little summary to help you think through your options:

- **For a touch of French culture from the get-go:** Air France
- **For reliability and good customer service (generally):** Delta Air Lines
- **For leveraging frequent flyer benefits with a US airline:** American Airlines or United Airlines
- **For the budget-conscious traveler (with careful planning):** Explore connecting options with budget carriers.
- **For ultimate luxury:** Air France La Première, Delta One, or United Polaris

My best advice? Don't just jump on the first cheap fare you see. Do your homework!

1. **Determine your priorities:** What's most important to you – price, comfort, direct flight, loyalty points?
2. **Compare prices and features:** Use flight comparison websites, but also check the airline's website directly for potentially better deals or clearer information on add-ons.
3. **Read reviews:** Get insights from other travelers about their experiences with specific airlines and routes.
4. **Consider the logistics:** Think about the airports, connection times, and how you'll get to your accommodation in Paris.
5. **Look for deals:** Be flexible with your travel dates if possible, as flying at off-peak times can significantly reduce the cost. Sign up for airline newsletters and follow them on social media for sale notifications.

Ultimately, the **best airline to fly to Paris** is the one that gets you there safely, comfortably, and without breaking the bank, all while aligning with your own travel preferences.

I woke up at 7:30, went to the kitchen to make coffee and literally craved an effing chocolate early morning (because that is what I did earlier). Over the passage of the day, I made sure that I would keep myself busy and would consume water in case I had a craving. 

I mean its too soon to see any visible changes but then again I did have a whole choco-chip cookie yesterday. Lets see what tomorrow has in store.

1lf3yw3,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_K1R4_SH1KE1/comments/1lf3yw3/flicker/,Flicker,"“Augh!” I cried, bringing my hands to my eyes in desperation.  The spray bottle fell to the ground and I followed soon after.  My rear landed first as I rubbed my eyes with my fingers.

Calming my composure, I sat there on the floor and attempted to sop up the window cleaner from my crying eyes with my sleeve.  It wasn’t even that much, just a few drops that splattered back at me from spraying it on the surface.

Taking a few deep breaths, I blinked my eyes a few times and brought them back to the glass door, reflecting the interior as if it were a mirror.  

Reflecting the idiot staring at it.

Sighing, I brought up my hand and gazed at my watch.  “*10:46 p.m.*” I thought to myself.  “*An hour and fourteen minutes left.*”

Suddenly, the building went black.  The door returned transparent, displaying the lights above the businesses across the street.  My heart rate began to increase as my whole body flinched.

As quickly as they turned off, the lights flashed back on.  The thumping from my heart was slowly returning to its normal pace.  “*They’ve got to get those damn lights fixed.*”

I sprawled myself onto the carpeted floor and let out a loud groan.  It echoed throughout the small, empty office building for a few seconds.  The lack of sound in the building was slightly off-putting.

Scrunching my eyebrows, I thought to myself, “*I better not develop a liminal space fear during this job.*”  I chuckled.  “*I’ll be filling up a mop bucket and get sent to ‘The Backrooms.’*”

Forcing myself to sit up once more, I attempted to rub the tiredness from my eyes.  I brought my attention back to the bottle of glass cleaner on the floor.  With a deep and exaggerated sigh, I grabbed the bottle and stood back up.

“*Sitting here on my ass isn’t going to pay the bills.*”

I spit out the spearmint toothpaste into my sink.  “Mom!” I exclaimed, leaning on the small counter.  “You don’t need to send me anything!”

“Magda, you’ve been without a conditioner for months.” the voice over the phone shot.  “Your hair is going to fall out!”  

“I’ll be fine.  Shampoo gets the job done.”

I looked at the ends of my hair.  A plant’s roots sprawled out from a single strand of my dry, brown hair.  “*I guess a conditioner would be nice.*” I thought to myself.  “*I’ll die before she finds out though.*”

I heard a thud on the other line, more than likely her hitting a table.  “You need to take better care of yourself.  If you keep neglecting your health, you’re going to have some major issues down the road.”

“Mom, it’s just conditioner.  It’s not that big of a deal.  I’m not going to die.” 

 “But your hair is.”  I sighed and pinched the top of my nose.  “I’m working as a pizza delivery driver and a night janitor, not a model.  How my hair looks doesn’t matter.”

There were a few seconds of uncomfortable silence.  I looked down at the tile floor, the white shade stained a slight gray tint.

“I just worry about you, rakkaus.” she continued, her tone now much more relaxed.  “You’re working so much and disregarding little health things.  I’m just concerned that you might start brushing off big health things down the line.”

I stayed quiet for a moment, ashamed of how annoyed I got with her.  “Alright mom.” I began, sighing.  “I’ll take the conditioner.  Just get me the cheapest one.  You need to save the money for mummo.”

She breathed a chuckle.  “You’ve always been such a grandma’s girl.”  I laughed a little, wiping leftover toothpaste from my mouth with my shirt.  “I think asking to save money for her medical bills goes beyond just being a grandma’s girl.”  “Don’t forget about all that you’re sending as well.”  “It’s the least I could do in exchange for her helping to raise me.”

“We both miss you.”  I could practically hear her smiling on the other end.

“Are you almost ready for work, rakkaus?” she asked, her voice kind.  “Oh crap.” I said, realizing the time on my phone.  “Yeah, I just have to get dressed.”

“Okay good.” she replied.  “Make sure you stay careful though.  There’s been several disappearances around that office building.”

I furrowed my eyebrows in confusion as I laid out clothes on my bed.  “How did you hear about that, mom?”  “Just by seeing some articles about the area.”

I stopped what I was doing and asked, “You saw a random article about my specific new job place from all the way in Finland?”  “...yes…” a quiet voice replied.

“Are you stalking my workplace again?”  The other line stayed silent for a few seconds.  “...no…”

“Mom!” I exclaimed, throwing my free hand in the air.  “I’m a grown woman, I can do research on the places I apply to myself.”

“Okay, okay.” she responded.  “I’ll stop.  I’m just scared about my baby all alone in America by herself.”  “I understand.” I replied.  “It just surprises me you’re still doing that from when I was sixteen.”

She giggled, “I was always a helicopter mom when it came to you getting a new job.”  “Was?” I questioned.  We laughed together.

“I’ll let you go now, rakkaus.” she sighed sadly.  “Have a great day at work.”  “Thank you mom.” I responded, a warm smile emerging on my face.  “Minä rakastan sinua.”  “Minäkin rakastan sinua.”

The smile on my face slowly vanished as I brought myself back to reality with the sound of the dial tone.  “*We’ll be together soon enough.*”

Yawning, I opened the glass door of the building, the same one that repelled window cleaner into my eye.  I glared at it harshly.

“Did the door do something to you, Ms. Mäkinen?” a voice called.  I looked in front of me at the smiling young man, his brown suit freshly pressed with no sign of a single wrinkle.  His usual attire.

“Oh, good evening, Mr. Crawford.” I replied, giving back a similar smile.  “Please,” he began.  “There’s no need for formalities.  You know I’m just Davit.”

“Then that means I’m just Magda.”  “Very well then.” he bowed his head slightly, his blond hair falling in front of his face.

“Now then,” he continued, gesturing behind me.  “The door?”  “Oh!” I laughed, my cheeks growing warmer.  “I-it’s nothing.  I just had some window cleaner splash back at me.”

He responded with a hearty laugh.  “Talking with you Magda, is the perfect way to end the day.”  His green eyes gleamed with excitement as he continued, “Being the boss’ son makes the day so boring with meetings and constant perfect professionalism and it gets tiring, you know?”

I nodded my head in agreement.  I had no idea what that was like.

“He wants to treat me like an important business man, but he makes me turn in my keys before I leave.”  “How come?” I asked, visibly confused.  He scratched the back of his head, “It’s probably because I always end up leaving something, so it’s probably an incentive to make sure I have everything before I leave.”

I laughed, “That’s more than likely it.”  He laughed with me.

“Well, would you allow me to walk you to your station?” he asked, moving to the side.  I gave him a look of confusion.  “You mean my corner in the garage with all the cleaning supplies?”

He laughed again, “I suppose so if you want to put it like that.”  I shook my head and smiled.  “There’s no need for that, Davit.  Thanks for offering.”

His smile suddenly dropped and he looked at me blankly.

Less than a second later, he returned to his happy and joyful attitude.  “All right then, Magda.” he started, giving me a wave.  “I’ll see you tomorrow.  Stay safe!”

I gave him a wave back and he was out the door.  

I walked across the small area with three couches that formed a ‘u’ shape with a short coffee table in the middle.  When I entered the garage, I was greeted by the sound of a saw.  Covering my ears, my eyes met those of the operator.  

“Sorry about that, little lady.” he said after he turned the saw off.  “I was finishing up some last minute cutting.”  “You’re alright.” I told him, my ears throbbing.

“You the new janitor?” he asked, looking me up and down, a slight smirk emerging on his face.  I was wearing a red, old shirt from a pizza chain I used to work at with hand-me-down flare jeans and worn out sneakers, so I have no clue what he was looking for.

“I am, I’ve been here a few weeks.” I replied, trying not to show how uncomfortable I was.  “Well,” he said, his eyes traveling around me again.  “You be careful around here.  Little ladies have gone missing.”  I gulped, “I’m aware.”

“Just telling ya.” he responded, walking closer.  “Don’t want none to take our little janitor.”  He gave me a smirk disguised as a smile as he placed a hand on my shoulder, close enough to my neck for his fingers to brush on it.

“The back door in here is unlocked just to let you know.” he informed me, with a sing-song voice, stepping away.  The door shut behind him with a loud thud.  I rolled my eyes and scratched the side of my neck.  “*Good thing I only work after everyone’s gone.*” I thought to myself.

Walking to my corner, I could immediately tell something was off.  “My damn apron is missing again!” I exclaimed, rushing toward the hook where I always put it after a shift.

“*That creep is probably the one who keeps moving it.*.”  I thought, opening up the cabinets containing various cleaning supplies.  I eventually found it on the floor in front of the mop bucket.  “*At least it wasn’t in a hard to find spot this time.*""

I sneezed, the sharp smell of bleach piercing my nose.  The bleach mixed into the water as I swirled the mop in the combination.  My eyes began to water, typical for this part of the job.  I used the back of my arm to wipe my tears, praying no bleach got on that part.

I flopped the mop onto the bathroom floor and it let out a splat.  After a few seconds of moving it along the tile, I had to lean against the wall.  My arms were already tired from scrubbing down the bathroom furniture and breakroom just fifteen minutes prior.  I let out a few deep breaths and moved my shoulders in a few small circles.

“Just another hour.” I said to myself.  “Another hour and I can rest.”  I took a quick swig of my water, my dry throat rejoicing.

Suddenly, the lights went out.  I jumped in fear as something poured on my shirt and pants.  The lights flickered back on, revealing the mysterious liquid was only water.

“Ah damn it.” I said, placing the water bottle on the sink.  I grabbed some paper towels and patted them on my shirt.  My eyes landed on an area on my pants.

“You’ve got to be kidding me.” I shot, staring at the bleached splatter on my left shin.  I attempted to rub it off with paper towels, but it made no difference.  I kept going, my face growing hotter and hotter with frustration and embarrassment.  

I threw the wet paper towel down on the ground and placed my back end on the door and braced my arms on my knees.  Taking a few shaky deep breaths, I attempted to calm myself down.  “They’re just jeans.” I told myself.  “Nothing to get worked up about.”  I picked the mop back up and continued to work.

The loud hum of the vacuum ran throughout the small building, drowning out any other potential sound.  It hurt my ears, as it had nowhere to spread in the small office.  I turned it off as I ran out of cord and had to change which outlet it was plugged into.  I switched off the light and the small office space became close to pitch black.  Thin lines of light seeped through the closed blinds.

A black figure interrupted the yellow and orange, walking along the outside of the window.  “*Wow,*” I thought, checking the time.  My watch read 10:37.  “*Someone’s doing overtime.*”  I chuckled to myself and moved the vacuum out of the room.  Luckily, I was almost done with vacuuming.  All that was left was the small carpeted area in front of the door.

I plugged the cord into an outlet beside the small table with a sign in sheet and a message that read, “NO CLASSIFIED DISCUSSIONS.”  I was still unclear as to what this business really did.

Standing back up, I looked at myself in the reflection of the door.  I was a mess.  My hair was scraggly, my jeans were stained with bleach, and the bags under my eyes were darker than usual.  I took a deep breath and let it out with an overly loud raspberry.

It went dark.

The lights had gone out only for a second.

But I saw it.

The newly pressed brown suit.

His bright green eyes now wide shrouded in shadow.

Staring at me.

Stalking me like prey.

The lights went back on and my reflection was all I saw.  “*Huh?*” I thought, my heart rate accelerating.  “*Was that Davit?*”  I backed away from the door slowly, not taking my eyes off of it.  “*Why was he staring in the building like that?  He could just knock if he wanted in.*”  I began to hyperventilate.  “*Was he staring at me?  And why like that?  Does he want to hurt me?*”  I walked away more quickly, trying to sort out my thoughts.  “*Why do I feel so scared?  He can’t come in here to get me, right?”*

My eyes shot open in realization.  At the same time, I heard thudding on the pavement heading in the direction of the garage.

I ran across the building to try and reach the back area.  Flinging open the door, I sprinted to the outside entrance, guided by a slight light illuminating the outline.

Just as I reached the handle, the door moved open.  I snatched it with my other hand and pulled with everything I had.  It closed.  My reflexes kicked in and I locked the handle.

As I reached for the deadbolts, I realized I didn’t hear anything.  One would expect him to be pounding on the door or trying to force it open, but there was nothing.  “*Is he still there?*” I sheepishly thought, hands glued to the doorknob.  Shaking, I brought my eye up to the peephole.

Nothing.  Even at night, the lights from the outside are still on so it wasn’t so dark as to not see anything.  I let out an uneven breath, trying to gain my composure.

A green eye stared back at me.  An eye devoid of any emotion or brightness.

An instant after, a loud pounding on the door commenced.  I flinched back in shock.  Breaking out of my trance of fear, I slid over the top deadbolt into the wall.  The thrashing’s target was changed to the door handle.  Within a few hits, the knob completely fell off.

“Magdaaaa.” a sing-song voice called out from the hole in the door.  “Unlock the door pleaseee.”

A shiver ran down my spine.  His voice was so condescending.  It was as if he was speaking to a small child, trying to lure it into a trap.  This man wasn’t Davit.  There was no cherry tone or laugh in his voice.  This was a monster.

“Magda!” it yelled, pounding the door harder than before.  I used this chance to sprint to the door I came through.  Before making it past the threshold, an object caught my eye on a workbench.  Sliding it into my pocket, I made a run for the entrance.

I breathed a sigh of relief as I saw the short distance I had to cross.  Ramming my body into the door, I jerked the handle down.  My shoulder began to pulsate with pain.  The door hadn’t opened, in fact the handle didn’t move either.  I yanked the handle up and down but it wouldn’t move.  Checking the deadbolt wasn’t locked either, I thought, “*It must’ve messed with the door before the lights flickered!*”

The lights went out.  They didn’t immediately turn back on as if they glitched.  They stayed off.  The entire building was left in darkness.  It dawned on me that there was a power control panel in the garage.  If the lights are off, he got inside.

I ran down the hall and went into the first office on my right.  Putting my back to the wall, I covered my mouth to silence my panting.  I rushed into my back pocket to retrieve my phone and what I grabbed from the workbench.  I just managed to dial 911 before the garage door opened and I sucked in a breath.  

“911, what’s your emergency?” the voice chimed on the other end.  “942 Carlswood street NE, building F.” I whispered quickly.  “There’s a man at my work trying to get me.  I don’t know what he’s going to do but my life is threatened.”  Before the operator could respond, I turned the call volume all the way down and slipped my phone into my pocket.  I prayed this was still being recorded.

“Magdaaaa.” it called again.  I held my breath.  “Are you hidinggggg?”  Its soft footsteps on the carpeted floor got louder and louder.  I stared at the ground, the hallway slightly illuminating the doorway.  Its shadow moved across and further down the hallway.

“You know,” it began, causing me to flinch.  “This is a small building.  Not many places to go.”

I peered at the edge of the door frame, my hand gripped tight on the object from the workbench.  Taking in a shaky breath, I clenched my teeth to keep them from chattering.

“Boo!”

Its head poked through the door, grinning from ear to ear.  Dark green eyes with dilated pupils looking deep into mine.  “I found yo-”

I plunged the tweezers deep into his right eye.  He screamed as blood erupted and streamed down his face.  Grabbing his jacket collar, I pulled him down to the floor and jumped over the flailing body.

I sprinted across the floor and into the office closest to the door.  Quickly grabbing the first chair I could find and running back, I swung the chair into the door.  The glass shattered, covering the ground.

“Get back here!” Davit yelled, charging at me.  “You’re mine, Magda!”  I turned and threw the chair at him, knocking him back down.

I hopped over the glass, making sure to pick up a shard, and ran out into the parking lot.  It wasn’t long until there was the sound of crunching glass behind me.  My efforts to run were futile because only a few seconds passed before I was pushed to the ground, knocking my shard out of my hand.

Davit turned me over to face him and sat on my torso.  Blood ran down his face and dripped onto mine.  He stayed there, panting and grinning.  I attempted to hit him but he grabbed my wrists.  He tightened his grip and I gasped, fearing they would snap.

“You’re so troublesome, Magda.” he remarked, tilting his head to the left to get a better look.  “I thought you would go down easy, but now I have tweezers in my eye.”  He laughed.  “I suppose I should’ve known better, considering you’re a poor street rat fighting for survival in the world.”

I wiggled my body around in an attempt to break free, tears forming in my eyes.  I glanced over at the shard of glass laying on the pavement.  Davit followed my gaze and frowned.  “Aw damn it.  Your only weapon.”

He grabbed both of my wrists with one hand and got the shard.  “I was going to keep you around, you know?” he said, his sick grin returning.  “You were going to be with me for a while.  It would’ve been so nice.”

He observed the glass in his hand, flipping it over and turning it.  “It really is a shame you turned out to be such a little chihuahua.”  He erupted in laughter before turning back to look at me.

“You know what would be hilarious?” he asked, his smile piercing the corners of his eyes.  “What if I kill you with the thing you thought would protect you?”

I felt my eyes widen with fear as he rose the shard in the air.  He swung it down, aiming for my left eye.  My hand had slipped out of his grasp and blocked.

I screamed as my hand was pierced, the bones fracturing and tendons tearing.  He pushed down more and I curled my fingers around it.  I shoved the glass away from my face, every second cutting deeper into my palm.

“Just die!” he cackled, putting more body weight into it.  Tears streamed down my face knowing I was just delaying the inevitable.  I was going to die here.

Davit looked up, something catching his attention.  Then I heard it.

Sirens.

“Cops?” he asked, frantic.  He glared at me, eyes burning with rage.  “You bitch-”

He was cut off,  blood spurting out of his mouth as I plunged the glass shard deeper into his neck.  His shaky hand reached up to lightly grab my arm, trying to push it away.  His hand slipped off, caked in a deep red.

He stared at me again, his eyes glazing over more with each passing second.  His mouth opened as to say something, but only blood pooled out, covering his neat suit.

Red and blue lights flashed across this body.  He slumped over to his left and fell on the ground with a splat.

I am a 27 year-old male. I don't smoke. I don't have hypertension. I am never obese. I don't have diabetes. I drink alcohol sparingly.

Sedentary is a yes, because of my office job, but I do travel to and from the office by train and a decent amount of walk, 8000-10,000 steps per day when I work. I don't claim to eat healthily either, but I don't see how it is already a cause for problem.

My father passed on heart disease at age 56... But he was diagnosed at age 50, and was a very heavy smoker since his teenage years.

But again, I do not see how any of that may cause an actual heart problem for me at this age.

But... I had an emergency back on May 22... I feel dizzy on my way to work, pale, and drenched in sweat. Going to the hospital, I figured my EF is at 23%; severe heart failure.

I... I have started feeling unwell since April 20th... But I was still energetic as of my age in January. In hindsight, I probably have had minor shortness of breath starting Feb. Not sure when, but I did have a bad cough in Feb and in Mar, and a high fever in Feb that resolves in just 1 day.

MRI shows microiinflamation with increased T1 and T2, and ""subtle non-ischemic scar"" in mid LV. I also get some akinesia with general hypokinesia LV, and general hypokinesia RV at 40% EF.

The MRI Doc thinks it's Myocarditis. Another doctor I met before the MRI also thinks it is unlikely I already have a blockage, especially at my age and profile. They both specifically tell me to do a CT Scan to rule out blockage. My social healthcare doctor, however, thinks Myocarditis is impossible, seeing I have no fever or cough at the time I meet him and want to do a catheterization.

I am really sorry for any reader that may be offended... But it feels unfair... Why do I have something so severe when there are many people who treat their body worse and get no problem? Why is it at this age, when I still wish to try things that I cannot do anymore now?

I lost opportunities and activities I enjoy.

I... I was aiming for a Masters degree scholarship... And it requires a full health certificate after the MCU. So it is now impossible. My career still needs developing through hard work and opportunities. My 63-year-old mother is not at her healthiest in regards to skeletal health, but I find it really disheartening that she ended up being the one taking care of me rather than the other way around. I was actually planning to get insurance this year, but now I will never have heart-related illness covered... I am unmarried, and never had sex due to religion and cultural reasons; an esperience that may change henceforth.

I enjoyed spicy hotpots. I do enjoy both the social and chemical aspects of coffee and alcohol. Thick ramen. Spicy foods. I enjoy bowling and watching horror movies. Drinking plain ol' water. Yes I quite enjoy drinking water, it's my favorite drink. All of which I can no longer enjoy without reservations anymore...

I... I am scared.

I am scared my lifespan will be cut short. I am scared I am now a burden for my family. I am scared that my friends, while understanding, finds it hard to accommodate my meal restrictions. I am scared I lost so many opportunities in life. I am scared I will have a worse illness in my future without any insurance to cover it.

I am going to do a CT scan now, if nothing else, ""to rule out CAD"". But I... Cannot help but worried. What results are good for me? Do I need implants? Is it possible to even get back to normal?

I hope I don't sound too whiny, especially to fellow heart failure patients here. But I feel like I need reassurance... I need experience and wisdom... I hope anyone that is willing to sympathize can help reassure me, if you can spare it.",2,1750314846.0,HeartHealth,0,1.0,False

I just had a brilliant idea.

Now that you can enforce laws, i had the idea that you could enforce debt slavery on your subjects/protectorates/sphere members while you alone have slave trade active.

This would mean a massive import of slaves, particularly if some of those countries are in east asia, and they can be purposefully employed if you build enough, in your south american colony coffee/tobacco/sugar plantations or in the wonderfully productive bread basket of the nile. All the while freeing up your core pop to work proper jobs/ collect paychecks.

TRIGGER WARNING: Violence, SA and dr\*g use is mentioned in this story.

Hi there. So, I’ve come across the stories posted by my friend user AshimaN2025 (F30), she wrote about my relationship with my ex “Marlon” (M31), how she took him in after I kicked him out and just wanted to say that in her story, I (F29) am the aforementioned “Paige”. I spoke with Ashima about it and assured her I’m fine with her telling this story. However, after reading her posts and many of your comments, I feel I just need to maybe shed a little light on what the relationship with me and Marlon was like.

This is not much of an “update” per se, as the only real new developments from what Ashima mentioned in her last post are that she has given Marlon 30 days to move out, Marlon’s mom Sylvia (F68) got him fired from his job and Marlon has been increasingly desperate in trying to keep his life together. This is really just more for context to what Ashima has already mentioned and for me to tell my side of the story so if you haven’t already done so, please read her posts before reading mine.

Also, as I feel Ashima in her previous posts already did a pretty good job in covering the situation we’re in, I’m going to try and avoid repeating parts she’s already mentioned.

I am originally from New Jersey but moved here to California in late October 2021 after my grandpa passed away from COVID the year before, thus inheriting his house here in Oakland. I didn’t really know anyone here but about week after moving into my new home, is when I met Marlon.

We met at a grocery store that I would frequent and we got to chatting after I commented that I liked the Linkin Park shirt he was wearing. He had scruffy hair, stuttered a bit and to me he came across as this quirky and kinda awkward type of guy but I personally found it cute, so after running into him and chatting with him a few times, I took out a sharpie and wrote my number on his arm, telling him to call or text me if he ever wants to chat or meet up outside of Safeway.

For about two weeks, Marlon and I would text and call back and forth almost every day. With that in mind, on the second week, while we were talking on the phone, with me talking about how I grew up watching Star Trek and I just asking him if he wanted to go out with me to the Chabot Space & Science Center which will reopen on November later that week to which Marlon eagerly said yes too.

We went out on our first date on Saturday, November 13th to the Chabot Space & Science Center, I liked that he was smart, engaging, quirky and just a delight to be around at the time. After that, since he took a cab there, for dinner, I then drove us to this Chinese restaurant near the tattoo shop I worked at (I would later buy it off of the previous owner when he retired) and told him of how on Christmas Eve, while Christian families may serve up ham in their homes, it was a thing for my family and other Jewish families to go out to Chinese restaurants instead. Our first date went really well so we kept seeing each other.

In the three years we were dating, I told him everything about myself, my family and my family history. I told him of how I’m of Czech Jewish descent on my dad’s side and Sephardic Jewish on my mom’s side. I told him of how my paternal great grandpa was the only member of his family to have survived Auschwitz and how the trauma of him losing his entire family caused him to instill in us the value of family and staying close to each other. I told him of how my mom was originally from Portugal but emigrated here to the States in the 1970s to be closer to her family here, which is why I have dual US and Portuguese citizenship, etc.

I also opened up to Marlon about how when I was 17, I was kidnapped, r-ed and tortured, causing me to develop PTSD and develop a dr\*g addiction which took me years and treatment to deal with. This was something only very few people know about, my own family doesn’t know the full extent of what happened but I told Marlon everything, all of which was in confidence. I made Marlon promise not to share what I told him to anybody.

Marlon however was generally very reluctant to talk about his family which I respected but eventually he did talk about how he grew up in a very conservative and strict household, how his family scoffs at the college educated and how he is the primary provider for his family, with Marlon saying that he does what he can to “earn” his parents love. I told him that love is not earned but rather its unconditional and based on mutual support for each other.

His immediate family were very toxic, his brother “Ryan” (M35) bullies Marlon and his parents encouraged it, they mocked Marlon for going to college, but now his parents are using him as a meal ticket as well as intending for him to be a long-term financial support system for Ryan.

Marlon however does have an aunt and uncle who I will call Grace (the older sister of Sylvia) and Todd, who were actually genuinely nice people and have shown him love and compassion. He even recalled of how his aunt Grace (F72) would often times defend Marlon whenever Sylvia started berating him during family gatherings. When Grace did this, Sylvia would often backdown according to Marlon only for Sylvia to take out her anger on Marlon later.

Anyway, in the three years we’ve been dating, Marlon and I have travelled back to the east coast three times to spend the holidays with my family. This was for Passover in 2022 and 2024, as well as Chanukah in 2023.

To Marlon, the way my family and I interacted with each other was like a culture shock. My sister Noa (F26) and I could have disagreements, talk back to and even mildly argue with our parents over certain things and it not being that big of an issue, how we could just candidly talk about things with each other, our parents respecting our personal space and privacy, etc. Additionally, my parents made it a point to make Marlon feel welcome, my parents were super supportive of us and for Chanukah, my mom even got Marlon a present.

All of this, my family being able to talk candidly and even have disagreements with each other in a healthy manner, as debates are something my dad has generally encouraged as it promoted critical thinking skills. Additionally, our parents being supportive of my sister and I, our parents not trying to guilt trip us or play favoritism, just felt strange and foreign to him. For Marlon, he described my family dynamic as being the type of family dynamic he’d only see on TV or in movies. He always assumed it was just fake or for show, as based on his experiences, especially with his own family and to a lesser extent, seeing how his extended family interacted with each other, to him dysfunction was normal.

Now from reading the comments on Ashima’s posts, quite a few of you did comment and ask why I stayed with Marlon for as long as I did. This is the part where I explain that.

For the first two years of us dating, back when Marlon’s parents weren’t really all that involved in our relationship, things were actually really good. I enjoyed spending time with Marlon, he was kind, compassionate, great at listening, engaging, a bit weird in a cute kinda way. My relationship with Marlon when it was just the two of us was great.

The first time I actually met Marlon’s family was on New Years Eve in 2022. Marlon told me they wanted to spend New Years in a proper house and they wanted to know if I’d be willing to host them so I did. Also, as a buffer, I also invited my friends Tiffany (F30), Luna (F29) and my cousin Jacob (M33) as well as his wife and kids who were also visiting at the time.

Right off the bat, Marlon’s parents were unpleasant people. When I introduced myself, upon them learning that I owned my own home and had my own income, Marlon’s parents seemed genuinely offended by that. In fact, quite a few things at my home offended them.

They didn’t like the fact Jacob’s kids were just in the living room watching Glee which Marlon’s mom loudly complained that it was “woke trash” which she believes promotes homosexuality. She also didn’t like the fact she saw my old Bernie 2016 t-shirt just laying on my couch with Marlon’s mom calling Bernie Sanders a “woke, Jewish socialist”. I playfully responded by saying so am I, as again, I grew up in an environment where I was encouraged to talk back, which Sylvia seemed offended by.

During the dinner, Marlon’s dad and brother Ryan talked about how Marlon is a disappointment, with Ryan calling Marlon a loser. This caused an awkward silence in the dining room so I shot back by rhetorically asking Ryan “so, what do you do for a living” and “tell me Ryan, where did you go to college again”. This caused Ryan to shut up and stare at me angrily.

I doubled down by bluntly pointing out to Ryan and Marlon’s dad that Marlon is not only the only one in his family who’s been to college, but that he’s the only one among them who has a job (at the time) and pointed out that he’s basically paying for their everything so they’re not exactly in a position to talk down to him. Sylvia then snapped, incoherently screaming at me and I pissed her off even more by just laughing at her, which I’m guessing pissed her off even more.

After a little more back and forth, Marlon’s family then stormed off even before we could get to the New Years’ countdown.

After the party, when everyone else went home, Marlon essentially told me off for talking back to and arguing with his parents like that. Sometime after they left, while the rest of us were in the living room celebrating New Years, Marlon actually stepped away from the party to take a phone call from his mom who berated him because I stood up for him.

I reminded Marlon that I’m his girlfriend so yes, I did stand up for him and defend him the same way I expect him to defend me if it came down to it. We got into an argument because of that and we ended up sleeping in separate rooms. He later apologized for telling me off, saying that he did appreciate as nobody but his aunt Grace has ever done that for him it but he also went on to say that his mom was wanting me to apologize to them, which I refused. Admittedly, this was a massive red flag I ignored.

This New Years Eve dinner did cause this lingering issue in the back of my head which admittedly, I should have addressed more firmly and that was the fact most of Marlon’s income was going towards supporting his parents and older brother. Three adults who were ridiculously ungrateful and entitled, yet dependent on Marlon. They would mock and ridicule Marlon while making demands of him, and honestly it pained me to see this.

We did talk about it for a while, but I agreed to not interfere or weigh in on his family matters so long as their behavior does not affect me or our relationship. I did however also suggest that he try to at least gradually reduce his support for them.

I did however try to at least get him to question and sow doubt in his decision to support his family by asking him things like “has  your parents ever thanked you”, “what do you gain from spending time with them”, “do they make you happy” and “if we do eventually get married and have kids, do you really think you’d still be able to support them as well as us”. Marlon can never really give a straight answer to any of these questions; he kept trying to shut these questions out of his mind and he’d often use the justification “because they’re family” as his reason to keep supporting his parents and brother. After a while, he also asked me to stop asking him these kinds of questions so I did.

Things started to go downhill at around July 2023 when Marlon’s family started becoming more involved in Marlon’s lives, with Sylvia trying to micromanage his life and have been pressuring him to either get a higher paying job or to get a raise. This has resulted in Marlon having near daily phone conversations with his parents, with him pretty much flinching every time the phone rings, Marlon being told to come over to their apartment so that they could berate him again and a few times even come over to my house to talk down to him here. Also, just wanted to point out, after the New Years Eve event, I was never the one who opened the door for Marlon’s family, as on the two times since the party that they’ve come over to my place, it’s been Marlon who answered the door and let them in. Admittedly, after the party, I should have just told Marlon that his parents weren’t allowed into my home, period.

So, in the occasions where they did drive over to my place to talk down to and berate Marlon or where they’d do so in a place where I was also present, there would be this pattern in which I would jump to Marlon’s defense, talk back to his parents, argue with them only for Marlon to defend them as I was trying to defend him. This resulted in the three of them coming at me as well just for trying to defend Marlon. Once his parents left, I’d then get into fights with Marlon over why he’s defending them while I’m trying to defend him, he’d say he’s trying to “keep the peace” and keep everyone happy, and how he’s just trying to earn their respect.

This was also when Marlon told me that his parents didn’t like the fact I was Jewish, that I had tattoos on my body or the fact that I had an LGBTQ flag, Ukraine flag, BLM banner, Yellow Ribbon banner, etc in my shop. He then tried to get me to “compromise” with his parents by trying to tell me to take down the flags and banners in my shop, cover up my tattoos and at least tell his mom that I’m willing to convert. After that, I angrily told Marlon that I don’t want his parents in my house ever again, if they come over again, I will get the cops involved and I threatened to break up with him, as at this point, I felt he was wanting me to change for his parents’ approval.

Marlon then tried to backtrack, begged me not to leave him and promising to set boundaries with his parents, which he never did. Again, another failing on my part as I should have just broken up with him at this point.

Throughout the next few months, I’d also find Marlon either crying, talking down to himself, telling himself that he needs to try harder and just being a mess. I in turn, I’d find myself trying to comfort and console Marlon, being there for him, holding him when he’s having a panic attack, etc. I do believe in being there to emotionally support and care for the ones you love which is why I did this, which I don’t regret as I would do that for any of my loved ones or people I care about. However, I understand now it needs to also be reciprocal.

Over the next few months, I was basically no-contact with Marlon’s family but from out of the blue, Marlon’s mom Sylvia started trying to call and message me, making demands that I support them as well. With Sylvia’s calls and messages basically conveying that as Marlon’s future wife I needed to “pitch in” and support them as well, let them live in my house and Sylvia basically stating that as Marlon is the “man of the house”, I need to obey him (IN MY F\*\*\*ING HOUSE) and let him control my finances, but also that he still has an obligation to support them using my money.

I tried ignoring her or just being blatantly rude by hanging up on her mid-rant, but when I did this, she then started making more insane demands. Sylvia then started asking if me and Marlon were trying to have kids, how she wants to name any child me and Marlon have, once messaging me to find a girlfriend for Ryan, etc.

All of this was stressing me out so I did also try to bring this up with Marlon but when I did, he wouldn’t take it seriously, or he’d try to dismiss it and on a couple of occasions, he even in a coy manner asked me to just “consider” it. There was basically no point in talking to Marlon about this at this point so I just flatly told him to tell his family to stop contacting me.

This clearly didn’t work though as finally on October last year, Sylvia and Ryan came to my shop to demand that I financially support them, I told Sylvia that she is not my responsibility, Marlon may want to waste his money on them but I don’t but none of this was getting through to Sylvia as she just went on and on about her debts, credit cards, etc. While Sylvia was ranting, I turned to see Ryan having climbed over the counter and trying to figure out how to open the cash register. This was all too much for me so I just pulled out my phone and called 911.

While I was on the phone with the operator, I suddenly felt a punch to the side of my face followed by being pushed down onto some shelves, knocking me over. I was dazed for like 5 seconds before realizing Sylvia was scratching at my face and hands as she was trying to grab my phone. 

Doug (M53) who is a barber and friend from across the road then came in along with a couple of his patrons to help me. With one of Doug’s patrons pulling Sylvia off of me while Doug pinned down Ryan. Another passersby and one of my customers also happen to come in and helped in restraining Sylvia and Ryan.

When I finished the 911 call, Sylvia was screaming at Doug and his friends, calling them the N-word, with Marlon’s mom calling me a crack w\*\*\*e and j\*nkie.

The police arrived, I showed the security cam footage, they arrested Ryan and Sylvia, and I was taken to hospital after the assault. I did press charges which is why Ryan is now in jail and Sylvia was forced to pay a fine. Ryan was also charged with assault as used a wallet chain in his pocket as well as a chair to assault Doug and one of the passersby who came to help.

When Marlon got home later that evening, he came in shouting at me for calling the cops, complaining that he now has to pay their legal bills and demanding that I withdraw my statement and say that I made it all up, ignoring the fact that I showed the police the security camera footage, that there were multiple other witnesses and the fact that Ryan assaulted two other people. I had a bleeding lip, scratches on my neck, a concussion and bruising on my face.

Also, just wanted to correct a minor detail from Ashima’s first story. Marlon only started demanding that I drop the restraining order against his family after I broke up with Marlon.

I stared at Marlon in silence for a few seconds and just simply said “you didn’t even ask if I was okay” to which Marlon immediately responded by saying “why the hell do I care if…” to which he abruptly stopped and immediately tried to backtrack so I told him to just stop and to not bother. 

There was another silence in the room so I told Marlon “your mom called me a j\*nkie and a crack w\*\*\*e… how does she know about that”. He was silent so I got up and screamed at him “HOW THE F\*\*K DOES SHE KNOW THAT” to which Marlon admitted that he told his mom of what happened to me as she wanted dirt on me.

I then told Marlon that I was done with him, I can’t deal with his family, I don’t feel safe around his family, he broke my trust, it’s killing me to watch Marlon humiliate himself to not only cater to but entertain his family who will never reciprocate his love for them, but more than all that, I can’t be with someone who can’t be there for me and who I can’t trust. I can’t be with someone who I can’t see a healthy future with.

After I said that and started tearing up as I told him that I was breaking up with him because I can’t do this and it hurts too much to be with him.

Marlon then tried to backtrack again, begging me not to break up with him, with Marlon saying things like “we can talk about this” and “we can make it work if we just talk”, but when Marlon said “I want to keep both my family happy and you so if we…”, I shouted back at Marlon “I HAVEN’T BEEN HAPPY WITH YOU IN THE LAST 15 MONTHS”.

Marlon then asked “can you just pretend you’re happy”. I responded to that by asking him “is that what you do with your parents, pretend you’re happy with them”. Marlon had no response to that.

I then caught my breath and composed myself enough to tell Marlon to pack his s\*\*\* and that he has 4-days to get the f\*\*\* out of my house, adding that when I come back I don’t want to see Marlon or his stuff still in my home. I then went to my bedroom, packed my stuff and my laptop into a backpack and went over to Tiffany’s place asking her and her husband if I can stay with her for a couple days as Marlon moved out of my house to which they graciously agreed.

Throughout the night, Marlon did spam me with calls, messages and texts, asking me to just talk about it. I just replied with two messages, one by text and one by Facebook telling him that if he’s still in my house by Wednesday, I’m calling the cops and getting a restraining order against him too.

On Monday, I received a call from Ashima who told me that she reluctantly agreed to let Marlon move in with her and we discussed details such as when he’s moving out, things he may have in my house as well as me agreeing to forward any of Marlon’s mail or packages directly to her place. It was a short phone call.

On Wednesday, I asked Tiffany’s husband Christian (M35) if he can drive me over to my place as I didn’t want to go back there alone just in case Marlon or his family were there. When we got back to my place, Marlon’s car as well as his stuff in my house were gone. Christian also helped me change the locks of my house while he was there.

A few days after Marlon moved in with Ashima, she contacted me asking if we could talk. We met up for drinks and I told her most of the situation of what happened. I also warned her to set boundaries with Marlon and to definitely keep his family away from her for her own safety.

Also, in case you were wondering, yeah, I’m doing okay now. In the almost 8-months since I broke up with Marlon, he for up until March of this year has tried calling me, messaging me from different accounts and he even dropped by my house and shop about four times wanting to “talk”. I usually told him to go away or simply ignore him and after he goes off on what I’m guessing was a rehearsed speech which I kinda tuned out, he’d just leave.

Ashima and Tiffany has also promised to help keep Marlon and especially his family away from me considering that I have a restraining order against his family.

On a separate note, I am now dating a guy named “Virgil” (M33). We went to the same high school together but he was a few years ahead of me and we reconnected back in June last year when I found out he moved here to California and went to the same gym as me. He told me he moved here work so we started meeting met up for coffee, catching up and me showing him around but just as friends since I was still with Marlon at the time. We didn’t start dating until March this year.

I haven’t mentioned this to Ashima yet but my last run-in with Marlon was a couple weeks after Virgil and I started dating. 

Virgil was driving me back to my place and as we pulled up into my driveway, I saw Marlon sitting on my front porch. I exited his car and asked Marlon what he was doing at my place. He then told me that the house key I gave him a couple years ago doesn’t work anymore.

Marlon then tried talking to me but he was disjointed in what he was trying to tell me, jumping between “I just want to talk”, to “how could you do this to us”, asking for a second chance and Marlon saying that he could “forgive” me for “seeing another man” if I just gave him a second chance. Virgil then told Marlon to back up as Marlon ignored him, and just kept shouting at me things like telling me how his mom still follows me on Instagram (I’m guessing she created another account just to stalk me but idk) and how his mom doesn’t approve of me dating a black guy (Virgil is mixed-race as his mom is white, his dad is black), so just I cut off Marlon telling that I never cared about what his mom thinks, we’re not dating anymore and that he has to leave. 

The whole time, I was also trying to hold Virgil back, staying between Marlon and him as I didn’t want them fighting. I also told Virgil just to ignore Marlon and that I’ll explain things to him when we get inside.

As Virgil and I were entering my house, Marlon then frantically started screaming at me, telling me that I’m still his girlfriend and that I’m “hurting our chances of getting back together”, etc. Marlon then turned to Virgil and asked him “do you know she’s a dr\*ggie and a criminal”. At this, I then turned around, rushed towards Marlon and threw him against the column as Marlon tried explaining that he just said that to get my attention and just wanted to talk. 

I composed myself and told Marlon that if he ever comes to my house or business again uninvited, I will take him to court, get a restraining order and tell his boss that he’s been using his sick days to stalk me, as well as having my lawyer convey that fact to his employer so that they actually take it seriously. I then reminded Marlon that if he loses his job, he won’t be able to support his parents.

I then calmed down, told Marlon that I still think he needs to cut off contact with his parents, reminding him that his mom and brother ruined his relationship with me, and that he won’t have a life unless he cuts them off. However, I also told Marlon that I want him to be happy, but it won’t be with me.

Once inside my house and after Marlon left, I explained this whole situation to Virgil. We talked about it, he said he still wants to be with me, which I appreciate and that, if necessary, I will get a restraining order but I don’t really want to go to court any more than I have to.

I stayed with Marlon for as long as I did, stayed with him for the last 13 to 15 months in which I was no longer happy being in that relationship in what I guess was a baseless hope that things would get better and the memory of how good the first two years of the relationship were. Before I met Marlon’s family, before they interfered in our relationship, interfered in my life, things were good but I know now that Marlon from 2021 is not the same Marlon today in 2025.

If I had a magic wand, I would love nothing more but to go back to the late 1990s and get CPS to take Marlon away from his parents so at least, Marlon could grow up in a healthier home, even if it is in foster care but I know that’s as fanciful as the idea of Marlon’s parents ever actually loving or appreciating him.

Marlon believes he’s being noble and selfless by caring for his ungrateful family. I cannot reason with that. I don’t know how to.

Lastly, as for why I haven’t yet pursued a restraining order against Marlon yet, it is because up until a couple of days ago, Marlon still had a job and I knew that if I took Marlon himself to court and/or pursued a restraining order against him too, it could get him fired and the stress of all this could cause him to spiral even further. Despite everything he’s done and that has happened, I still don’t want to cause harm to him if I could avoid doing so, plus he’s never assaulted me or threatened me yet. I just want him out of my life but without making his any more difficult.

Sorry if my story seems a little disjointed. I spent all night trying to write it, am tired and my thoughts and memories are kinda all over the place right now.

I'll ask Ashima to link my story to her update.",41,1750314240.0,EntitledPeople,13,0.95,False

I work as a barista and I recently had a boob job about 16 days ago. I am returning to work tomorrow and i forgot that I don’t know if im able to tamp shots. We really have to hustle at my work and I thought two weeks would be fine because im an idiot and I don’t think the np (nurse practitioner) really knows how much I have to work. She said that I would be fine to return to work but I’m panicking right now 😭. I wont stock heavy things and such but I was just informed hr might not even give me accommodations bc its elective surgery. So yay. I genuinely hate this job tho and am just trying to save more money for when I move into my apartment next semester of college. Although most of my expenses should be covered by my college fund. I genuinely just want to quit because I hate this job and everyone is going to hate me because im not going to be fast. I don’t want to hurt myself and im not going to risk it for stupid coffee. I have a shift tomorrow morning early so I can’t even call my surgeon and ask if tampong shots is okay and they most likely won’t give me accommodations anyways. I didn’t tell people at my work im getting a boob job because it’s humiliating I told them im getting back surgery. So if hr says no then they will all know that I got an elective surgery. Im so tired I just want to quit and never go back but they put out the schedule for the next 2 weeks and I like some of the people at my job. I genuinely don’t know what to do im so upset. Someone help. Im not asking for medical advice just asking what would you do.

1. Track Every Baht for 7 Days
I started by writing down every single thing I spent money on for one week, coffee, snacks, 7-Eleven runs😛. It really helped me see what I was spending on autopilot.

2. Limit “Convenience” Food
Street food is cheap if you’re eating actual meals. But all those small buys like bubble tea , fried snacks added up to 1,200 THB in just two weeks. Now I set a weekly “treat budget.

3. Cash Envelope System (Old School, but it Works) I withdraw a set amount in cash at the start of the week and split it by category: food, transport, fun. When the envelope’s empty, that’s it for the week. 

All this really Forced me to be more intentional.",1,1750314150.0,personalfinanceTH,0,1.0,False

Not sure if this is the right place, but I’m going through a breakup right now and it’s been tough. I don’t really feel like I can talk to my close friends about it at the moment, so I figured maybe someone here might relate or be going through something similar.

If anyone’s up for a chat, coffee, or just wants to vent together, I’d really appreciate it. Sometimes it helps to talk to someone a bit outside of your usual circle.
