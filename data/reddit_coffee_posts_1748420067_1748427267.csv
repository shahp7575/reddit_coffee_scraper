(Map Included!),"https://preview.redd.it/09jprko9zh3f1.png?width=1574&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d0e2095d850001c5445d0caa10e582df740af80

Hey r/nova!

My wife and I are currently in another part of Virginia and are seriously considering a move to Northern Virginia. We've been looking at a neighborhood in Alexandria that I believe is called **Bren Mar** (see attached map for the general area we're looking at!).

We're hoping to get some insights from those of you who live in or know this general area well. We don't have school-aged children yet, but that might change in the future. The location seems promising for our current jobs (commutes within DC Beltway area), but beyond that, we're looking for a good feel for daily life.

Here are some things we're particularly curious about regarding Bren Mar:

* **Vibe of the neighborhood:** Is it generally quiet, family-oriented, diverse? What's the overall atmosphere like?
* **Walkability/Bikeability:** How easy is it to get around without a car for errands, dining, or just recreational walks/bike rides? Are there good sidewalks or trails?
* **Amenities:** What are your favorite local spots ‚Äì restaurants (especially hidden gems!), parks (like Holmes Run Trail access?), grocery stores, coffee shops, unique businesses nearby?
* **Commute:** For those who commute from Bren Mar, what are your experiences like, especially towards DC, Arlington, or other parts of Alexandria? How's access to 395/495/Duke Street during peak hours?
* **Safety:** How safe do you feel in the area, particularly at night?
* **Pros and Cons:** What are the biggest upsides and downsides of living in Bren Mar, in your opinion?

We've done some initial research, but nothing beats firsthand accounts from residents. We appreciate any and all thoughts you can share!

üß† My Brain on 3D: A Love-Hate Protein Shake

Learning 3D is like going to the gym. At first, everything hurts.
Your Blender file crashes.
Your UV map looks like a broken tortilla.
Your render time is measured in dog years.

But then‚Äîsomething clicks.
You make your first satisfying camera orbit.
You light a scene like a digital Spielberg.
You stop calling the software ‚ÄúCinema D‚Äù (true story).

Let‚Äôs be honest. You can still survive with strong 2D skills.
But if you're aiming for top-tier projects, premium clients, or that satisfying ""how-did-they-make-this?"" reaction‚Ä¶

3D is not a trend. It's a power move.

Not because everyone is doing it. But because 3D lets you show more, explain faster, and wow harder.

1kxd9v6,https://www.reddit.com/r/mounjarouk/comments/1kxd9v6/water/,Water,"TLDR: what is happening in my body (physiologically speaking) in relation to mounjaro  if I don't drink enough water? 

Just starting on the 7.5mg dose, and been on this mounjourney since the start of April. All going good, and although I'm slightly frustrated by slow progress at times, I do have to keep reminding myself that in the 9 weeks or so of doing this, I've lost just over a stone, or 7kg.  

At the same time, I decided to use the Freestyle Libre blood glucose monitoring patch. I don't need it medically - although I am type 2 Diabetic, I'm not reliant on insulin. I bought the monitors myself (not through NHS). What I saw was that at first I was spending a lot of time above 7mol/mm, which is to be expected. However, over these weeks I've found that my blood sugars are staying predominantly in the 4-7 zone, which is absolutely fantastic!  Mounjaro is amazing.

Anyway, one thing I noticed was that while I'm not that hungry any more, I'm not that thirsty either. I find myself with a dry mouth, and yet still have no desire to drink. My wee has been a lot darker and clearly I'm dehydrated at times. I have to force a drink down me.  It's not good. My main source of liquid is probably coffee and diet coke (perhaps at most one can a day). 

Can you help me understand the physiology as to why I need to drink lots of water?  What's going on and why does my weight loss need it? I know I need to drink, accept that, but what's going on in my body with mounjaro when I'm not drinking enough? 

Could it be me not drinking enough is slowing the whole process down?

A few months afterwards, without any contact in between, I replied to one of her Insta stories because it seemed interesting. From then on we started to exchange messages at an alarming frequency (it was going very fast for me, especially since I wasn't interested in her romantically, but I always answered to be polite, and not with one word replies).

I didn't know how to communicate that it was going too fast, but I of course didn't reply to her flirting and set small boundaries every time I could (no, I wouldn't send pictures, redirecting the convo when she was flirting, etc.).

After a few months of this, she point blank told me she was interested, still by message, and we had an awkward conversation where I said I wasn't.

At that point I started questioning myself, wondering if I'd sent mixed signals, which she told me the next day I hadn't (but then, why had she been relentlessly flirting?).

Things calmed down for a while, we had much more platonic, a bit less frequent conversations by message, and I thought that was well.

We then saw each other for coffee, and it was nice.

Fast forward to these past two weeks, where she's been flirting again, telling me she thought I was very hot, calling me cute, asking if I was thinking of her and how cute she was, etc.

I deflected every time, but I think I should have been firmer, and now I'm feeling anxious even thinking about her.

I don't want to hurt her by being harsh, but I genuinely feel anxious at the thought of even opening my messages.

I cannot see her in person right now either, so messages are the only conversation option.

I also don't know if she thinks she's being friendly with these comments, or just teasing, but surely not?

So I'm usually the guy who rolls his eyes at health supplements because let's be real, most of them are overpriced BS. But my sister kept bugging me about this Fatty15 thing after she started taking it, and I finally caved just to get her off my back.

Started taking it in January and didn't really think much about it for the first month or two. Then one day I realized I hadn't had my usual 2pm coffee crash in weeks. Like, I'd just power through the afternoon without feeling like I got hit by a truck. That's when I started paying attention.

The sleep thing was weird - I've always been a light sleeper but suddenly I'm sleeping through the night more often. My Fitbit even shows my deep sleep improved (yeah I'm one of those people who checks their sleep score lol).

What really sold me was when I forgot to take it for about a week when I was traveling, and I felt noticeably more sluggish. Like my body was actually missing it, which never happens with supplements I've tried before.

My wife says I'm less of a grump after work, but she might just be being nice üòÇ. Though I do feel more... balanced? Hard to explain but just more even-keeled throughout the day.

Look, it's not cheap and I hate spending money on this stuff, but it's one of the few things I've tried that actually seems to do something. Been about 6 months now and I just reordered another bottle, so that should tell you something.

It works like any regular Bingo game. You get a board, numbers start flying in fast, and you have 90 seconds to tap and score as many points as possible. It gets pretty competitive in a fun way.

What I really liked is that you're actually playing against real people. No bots pretending to be players, which is a huge green flag for me.

[Winzo Review](https://preview.redd.it/7d6hyyzyth3f1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10c39b6040328fca86a4b3ce1f7c02fea6763fb9)

I got a $1 bonus when I signed up, and so far I've made around $12 just playing low-stake games for 20 to 50 cents. Not a fortune, but hey, it paid for my coffee.

Here‚Äôs what I liked most about playing on Winzo:

1. No annoying ads
2. Instant deposit and withdrawal
3. You can play tons of other games on the same app like Solitaire and Candy Match

Quick tip: Use your turbo boosts smartly. Especially the 2x boost when you're close to completing a pattern. It really helps rack up points.

I‚Äôd rate Bingo on Winzo an easy 8.5 out of 10. It‚Äôs quick, fun, and gives you some real value. Not a way to get rich, but a cool way to make your free time a little more rewarding.",0,1748425397.0,esports,0,0.5,False

""Ok so here are your keys, front door, Parking garage, pool, and Mailbox. I'm a teacher so I'm usually gone during the day."" Said Andrew he was wearing a button down and kaki cargo shorts he looks dorky cute he hands me the Keys. 

I smile "" Thanks. I'm a full time student and I work so I understand. Are you a teacher at the college?"" I ask

""Yeah. You go to Windinnberg?"" He asked

""Yea starting 3rd year and a triple major. Now you get all the books."" I say pointing and chuckling at my boxes. 

""Wow I applaud you."" He says smiling 

""Thanks school starting tomorrow lets go porcupines!"" I said 

""Weird school mascot."" We laugh and I nod

We sit there and talk about weird roommates we have had in the past. We shared a six pack and a 3/4 bottle of vodka we stoped drinking at 8pm but we continue talking until about 1am. 

He's really funny and cute. 

----------------->
Andrew POV

It's 5am and I hear the shower going. Can I call a sub on the first day. 

I walk into the kitchen and I make coffee and I sit on a barstool eating corn flakes and drinking coffee and playing on my phone . I try to remember what me and  Xandria did last night. I hear the shower stop. 

Flashback 

""I dare you to tell me how old you really are."" Says Xandria sort of slurring. 

""I'm 24 25 in November."" I say 

""I knew you weren't super old your too-"" she started laughing ""never mind.""

""Your really pretty. Like a 10."" I say

""Thanks your a 10 too."" She says Smiling

We started drinking more and more and more. 

""What is a fantasy of yours?"" I ask her. I'm not sure why maybe to use as example in one of my classes. 

""I have many. Like getting Fucked by a teacher on their desk. Or-"" I cut her off

""Anything Dirtier?"" I asked Drunkly

""Oh a Dirty Boy... I like that."" She said licking and sucking on her finger  ""ok... sitting on my hot male employer or Sexy Teacher's desk in a short skirt or skin tight dress ... with no panties... they notice and can't stop thinking about it. They go down on me and probably have sex... Shhhh! Don't tell anyone."" She said whispering parts and smiling ""I'm sleepy."" Then she put her head down and started to snore. 

Flashback over

Andrew Pov 

Oh my god ok  no Drinking before school days. She's so beautiful. Ugh why'd I pick the hot roommate. 

After a few minutes she walked out the bathroom in a bodysuit. I have 3 sisters and I was in a long term relationship for a while I know things. 

""Oh, Hey didn't think you would be awake."" She said walking over to where I was and poured herself some coffee in a large mug that said 'I'm the motherf*ckin Queen! #Slay' 

""Hey yea I get up early sometimes. Cool mug."" I said smiling 

She laughed. ""Oh yeah my dad got it for me I love coffee and mugs so it's perfect."" She smiled. 

""So what time is you first class?"" I asked 

""7:30a. It's the class my step-mom teaches. I love to irritate her early in the morning."" She said smiling. 

""Really? That is waaayy to early for a class."" I say

""Yeah but it's fun because we bother each other. I bother all my teachers on the first day scratch that the first week or two. It's highly entertaining. "" she said looking up at me. 

""Why?"" I ask ""are you a troublemaker in class?""

""No never but it's a fun way to loosen up the class and to judge the level of the teachers."" She said smiling ""I bet your a Hard Nut to crack."" She said in a whisper 

Yup I need to take a shower. 
----
Xandria POV

He asked if I was a troublemaker really? Do I look troublesome.  

Maybe me not wearing pants right now might be troublesome. Didn't think he would be awake but I have to stay confident. 

""No never but it's a fun way to loosen up the class and to judge the level of the teachers."" I said smiling. 

I look down to pick up my coffee but I see that his friend Johnson has joined us. This will be fun. 

""I bet your a Hard Nut to crack."" I said in a sexy whisper. He's so hot. 

He chuckled. ""No I like to have fun with my class and get to know each student most of my classes are long. Like the class that's everyday it's 2hrs and 45 mins."" He said smiling aw. He's sweet 

Ugh I wish I remember more of what happened yesterday and what we talked about ugh it's just empty space. I'll remember by Thursday. 

I'm going to get ready and go to Starbucks.

Andrew POV

She got up and got more coffee and went to her room. I went to take a shower and get ready for work. 
-

On Campus I walk around and find my classrooms. Two of my best friends from childhood teach at the school. 

Mandy Elliott the most gorgeous lesbian you'll ever see and very Confident. She teaches English and something else it changes every year. I met her in kindergarten. 

Joe Panini yep like the food. :) we go all the way back to 2nd grade. Those were the times. He's actually co-Leader of the business and finance department at the school he teaches many classes he calls his students future Millionaires. 

We go to a town owned coffee shop and talk. 

""Hey let me see your class list for your classes today."" Said Mandy 

""Why?"" I asked handing it to her reluctantly 

"" I want to see if you have any one my kids in your classes. ""

""O...Kay."" I say and me and Joe continue talking. 

""Yes!! Yes!"" Said Mandy Smiling and poking Joe to show him something.

""What?"" I ask worried 

""You Have Abernathy in 2 of your classes today. I'm totally stopping by I'm sorry she is literally my favorite student ever."" Said Mandy Smiling so huge and Joe Finishing the thought   

""Yea she's like a walking encyclopedia and she's really¬† pretty and Hilarious she has the Personality of Pizza Cookie Puppies and Love wrapped together."" Said Joe Smiling 

""Yeah she's in one of his classes every semester she's a Public Relations Major. You'll meet her she'll explain it."" Said Mandy finishing her Donut. 

""Oh ok. She sounds interesting."" I said finishing my sandwich. 

--
I walk into my classroom I see that there are about 20 students here already this class is really big about 50 students. 

I don't look at them I write on the Board My Name My email office hours and their textbooks. 

It's 9am. 

I turn around smile looking around the room and I see Xandria fifth row 8 over from both sides. She smirks then raises a eyebrow. Oh no. 

""Hello Class My Name is Andrew Benson and you can call me Professor Benson or Mr. Benson but I prefer Professor. I'm going to take attendance. Attendance is very important for my class when you're here on time you get 10 points if you're late you only get 5. It's just like the real world. But after the first few days you will come in the Class and sign by your name. Ok. Awesome. Let's get started."" I said smiling  going to my desk picking up the class list. 

""Aavery Lynn. ""

Xandria raised her hand and made eye contact with a girl I suspect to be aavery. She started with a valley girl accent or impression.""I'm aavery Lynn I am a psychology major wait not anymore I'm a education major now because no one would believe me when I said I was a psychology major. Shocking right?"" She smiled 

The other girl started laughing then the class joined in. ""I'm Avery Lynn that's all true and also your paper has a typo it's only one A."" She squinted at the Xandria. 

""Alexandria Abernathy."" I said and the class 'ooh'd'

A boy in the 3rd row 4th seat from my left raised his hand. Xandria got a baseball and some paper ball out of her bag. 

Then two teachers walked in didn't say anything. The boy said ""my name is Alexandria and I am a A-hole with a big brain and a beautiful face and that's all I am. I think I'm smarter than everyone and if you disagree with me I will beat you senseless the textbook."" He said while sounding like 70 year old chainsmoker woman. 

She through a paper ball and got him right in the back of the head. He didn't move. She through 5 more. 

Mandy and the president of the fine arts department were just standing and watching. And 2 men came in the back door and just sat at the top steps. 

""What can't handle the truth!!"" He said and stood up. 

She grabbed 2 paper balls and the baseball walked in the the aisle. She's wearing a skirt. Hmm. Anyway the look of murder in her eyes whoa who is this kid?

The class around him were saying 'say sorry' 'dude just be quiet.' 'Sit down'

""You know Carter I literally hate you to the highest extent of the word."" She said 

""Hey guys I think we should all calm down. Everyone please take a seat."" I Said 

""Sorry Professor Diplo I will take my seat."" She said as she walked to her seat Carter hasn't sat down yet. 

""Just Remember you were Waitlisted and I wasn't."" Said Carter 

When he said that she threw the baseball but thank god he had sat down at the moment it passed him the ball was going so fast that in dented the wall. (Nope a small hole is now there) 

""Hmm. Lucky you."" She said with a smile 

""That would have killed him. Abernathy. Starter Carter sub."" The man with the baseball cap on sitting on the top step next to a man in a suit. 

""But Coach!"" Said Carter 

""No I saw you outside you provoked her."" The coach said 

""Um ok let's get back to attendance."" I say regrouping everyone 

I went through the list Xandria doing what she did with Avery for 2 more people. Everyone was pretty civil the man with Mandy left and the coach Guy left. The man in the suit was Xandria's Dad he loves to see what she does to new teachers. 

I didn't get home until 6:30pm I was extremely tired. Xandria is a very interesting person, in our second class she was 2 mins late and her friend was freaking out the whole 2 mins and when she got there. She just stared at me and talked in an English accent.
---------------->
Xandria POV

It is 6pm I didn't go to my Teacher aide class; i wasn't feeling good¬† I text the teacher and he said he won't hold it against my record.

I started dinner I made enchiladas and I made the table. 

My life motto is 
                No pants are the Best Pants.  

I had taken my pants off when I got home I took a bath and did my night routine. I was wearing a big shirt 

Anyway food. I washed all other dishes. Made a plate for me and Andrew he walked in as I was putting the plates down. 

""Hey are you hungry?"" I asked as he walked in he noticed the no pants ""I made enchiladas.""

""Ooh my favorite."" He said as put all his things down. And started eating and reading and answering text messages. 

I sat down doing the same. 

""Hey I hope it's ok about the no pants thing. I hate wearing pants. I just feel comfy here."" I said with a smile 

""It's you house too it's ok."" He said smiling

""I also had a allergy attack something in the air got me. I got hives all over needed air."" I explained. 

""You have allergies too. Good to know and the hall closet has every allergy medicine ever."" He said getting up and rinsing his plate. ""Hey, if you cook I'll always wash the dishes. I'm the worst cook ever so you never have to worry about dishes."" He chuckled stop being handsome stop!!

""Ok and I could teach you a few easy dishes if ever want to learn."" I say smiling and handing him my plate. 

""Really? That'd be cool."" He said Putting the dishes on the dish rack. ""Hey can I ask you a Question or a few?""

Oh no what is it. ""Sure."" I shrug 

""My first class has 50 students how do you know them all? Or all of you know each other?"" He ask leaning on the sink. 

""Oh, we mostly all grew up a town over and bunch by bunch we moved here.""  I say laughing. ""Anything else?""

""We don't know much about each other. Want to play 21 Questions?"" He ask walking back to the table 

""Haha ok let's make it 25+ Questions."" I say 

""Deal."" He said.

I've (f33) had MS since 2008, and I've been with my bf (m33) since a few months after diagnosis, but my bf gets upset with me often. It's so hurtful. Even just asking a simple question. Well, I stayed up all night to wash his new towels, got up from my nap, and asked why he took them out of the bag I placed them back in. He said he was going to start using them to dry our pupdog after baths. I get it, but I worked hard on them towels. I'm not saying it's a hard thing to do, just that I washed the towels because he asked me to. Of course, I also wanted to because any gf (s)would. I understand not everyone is like that, that's just how I grew up. Bf works, gf doesn't. Bf works out of home, gf works in the home. You do yyour share, I do mine. Everyone knows that people with ms need their sleep. Stuff like that. Granted, I had been staying up for the few nights previous. Ehh. It's not even about the sleep. Just that doing anything with ms is tiresome. He then proceeded to tell me I'm the one who got mad, and criticized him. In my eyes, it was more of a complaint than criticism. But then he said I use MS as an excuse to get angry. Ugh. Something along those lines. He said something, and I threw my paper coffee cup on the ground, and it spilled everywhere. He then flipped the table over destroying what was left of the coffee table I wanted to refurbish because I could care less about the rest of the furniture here. I know I threw my cup down, but it looks to me like he gets angry in more destructive ways a lot quicker than I do, and he doesn't even have ms. Not to mention he KNOWS my father did this all throughout childhood. He also knows how bad stress is for ms. Not using it as a crutch, but I'd be empathetic had he come down with a life altering disease some odd years ago. I just don't feel like I did anything inherently bad to deserve all that. The other day it was a newly adorned hole in the wall. You guessed it, because instead of handling my one asked question like an adult, he started yelling which made me escalate, and I might have said the wrong thing. I didn't mean to. Just the anger boils inside of me, and so on. I'm not bipolar or anything. It is just not so frequent mood swings. I have really sad days also. I don't know if I have psudorbulbar affect(sp?), but it sure seems like it after all these years. I thanked him for taking the burden off me because he cleaned the downstairs, and THEN said something about the towels. He then said it's not 'normal' for people to get 'mad' at things like that. I wasn't even mad. Just a little irked. I just don't know anymore... It kinda seems like projection to me, but who knows? I'm not all sunshines and rainbows 100% of the time, but honestly, who is? He's such a great bf aside from his own every now and then what I like to call a 5yr olds temper tantrum, and it really only flares when I have a question or something to say. THAT'S not normal behaviour, if you ask me. Let's also be honest about the pot calling the kettle black. I just no longer want to get blamed for things that 1. Either didn't happen, or happened, but in a completely different manner than he says. Or 2. Getting told the anger he shows is my anger because it must be easier to push the blame on someone with a debilitating disease because he knows it's a damn symptom. Other than that he's spectacular. And no, he doesn't act like this with anyone else. Even if there's an offending remark made to him.  I just need a third party to put their 2 cents in. Please , and thanks.

Tldr; my bf since 2009 gets angry intermittently. I have ms, and he said I use that as an excuse to get mad myself.

The truth? I'm already intrigued. The way you talk... like you know you'll be a little dangerous for my peace of mind? You're right. But I'll love every second of it.


I don't know the sound of your laugh, the rhythm of your voice, or the way your eyes light up when you're lost in something you love. But I think about you more often than I care to admit.


You're a mystery I'm aching to unfold, page by page, day by day. I imagine the way your hand might fit in mine, the way our conversations might stretch into the early morning hours, effortless and infinite. I wonder what it will feel like the first time our paths cross, if you'll smile and I'll know, deep in my bones, that it was always meant to be you.


I'm not looking for perfection. I'm looking for something real. Someone who will see the mess and the beauty in me and choose to stay anyway. Someone I can build a quiet, steady kind of magic with‚Äîno fireworks needed, just a love that feels like home.


You've been dancing around the edges of my imagination, and let me tell you, the version of you in my mind? She's got an alluring smile, a laugh that makes my day better, and a way of looking at me like she knows all my secrets... and likes them anyway.


I want to learn all your quirks, your go-to coffee order, the way your voice changes when you talk about something you're passionate about. I want to tease you, challenge you, make you laugh until you can't breathe‚Äîand then kiss you quiet.


Let's skip the part where I pretend to be subtle. I think about the tension that'll hang between us when we first meet. You'll act like you're unimpressed, but your eyes will say otherwise. And I'll smile, that slow, knowing kind of smile, because I'll already know: you're the one l've been waiting for. 

I like a woman who knows what she wants. Even more, I like a woman who can keep up. So when we finally meet‚Äîdon‚Äôt be shy. Bring that fire. Look at me like you‚Äôve already undressed me in your thoughts (you have, haven‚Äôt you?). Touch me like you‚Äôve been waiting your whole life. And talk to me like no one else exists.


I‚Äôm not looking for ordinary. I want wild nights and soft mornings. I want banter that turns into kisses, and kisses that leave us breathless. I want to make you feel seen, wanted, and wrecked in the best way. You deserve someone who never stops choosing you. Every damn day. 

Just one thing, darling: when you fall‚Äîand you will fall‚Äîmake sure it‚Äôs deep. I don‚Äôt do halfway. I want all of you, or nothing at all.

Until then, I‚Äôm working on becoming someone worthy of you. Someone who won‚Äôt just love you, but will cherish you. Who will protect your heart like it‚Äôs a fragile miracle. Because that‚Äôs what I believe love should be‚Äîa sanctuary, not a battlefield.


So take your time, love. But not too much time‚Äîl'm getting a little impatient over here lol.


Wherever you are, I hope you're safe and I hope you're smiling. I'll be here when the timing is right.

Hi there,

Question: what should get looked into?

(Sorry super long message).

Currently going through an early miscarriage, had faint lines for a week now on extra sensitive (10 *mIU/ml*)strips (from 11/12 DPO shadow, no progression from 13/14 DPO, started bleeding last night 19/20DPO).

I think I experienced 3 other early mcs this year, but did not test bc for the first two of them my partner was traveling and wanted to test together (and was naive... thought they would stay and did not even have tests yet the first time), but had very different cycles than usual with multiple days of pink and brown on and off spotting and some days with mild to extreme cramping from 9DPO onwards & late period and weird smell sensations (house smelled like horse stable :O). And for the third the cramping started at 7 DPO and spotting at 8 DPO and continued into a 10 day bleeding & cramping so did not have the chance to test. I have never have had (pink) spotting during my cycle before, and when we took a month off last month my cycle was shorter than usual 26 days (usually 28-30 days) - but flow was like normal: 5 days and 1.5 days of cramps, no cramping nor spotting in between. Between the first and second was also a short cycle with regular flow and no in between symptoms. This month my cycle was slightly off: ovulation very late around day 22/23 (tested with LH strips). I believe my hormones are off the last months because I always seemed to align quite well with my flo app in terms of cervical mucus days and estimated fertile window, and cycle length. So I hope it is OK for you that without positive tests I see those experiences as pregnancies as well, unfortunately they don't really count for my GP.

I think getting pregnant is not the issue but staying longer than 3/4 weeks is, as we tried 5 months out of 6 months and I had 4 wonky cycles in those months, one regular one, and one regular one when not trying.

Now a few things that have been looked into (some blood tests results at the bottom)

During the third time I found out that I was very short on iron (7) and ferritin (16) (also unf not the first time in my life), so supplemented that, took a once month break, and ferritin was up to 45 in 1 month, and I expect it now to be between 65-75. Thought & hoped that was the culprit. In the current cycle I did not start spotting and cramping from 9 DPO, so I had faith in this one :(, light cramping started around 12 DPO and I hoped it was part of growing a bb and only one time I had the tiniest spotting until bleeding now.

And two months ago, after the third time of 10+ days of cramping and bleeding I was referred to the gynecologist for an ultrasound, where physically everything seemed fine, endometrial thickness was good, sliding viscera, no signs of endometriosis, sufficient follicles in which the developing one was measuring well. Their conclusion: might have been early mcs, but also periods can just change sometimes and just continue trying, and work with sensitive pregnancy tests which I this month started doing. I have had some bloodtests and progesterone was very low in luteal phase but the gynecologist was not worried and more focused on length of luteal phase. Where I live there is a distinction made between referrals to the gyn for menstrual problems and for reproductive concerns, and this referral was for menstrual problems.

Lil more info: turned 36 this year, BMI around 20, have been taking quite some supplements over the past 5 (CoQ10, C, E, D, B complex incl folate, zinc, magnesium, omega-3 and iron), eating healthy (lots of vegetables, beans and legumes, wholegrains, full fat yoghurt and butter, eggs, all organic, also weekly sardines, almost no sugar, almost no alcohol, no coffee, little/no meat tho hence low iron), work part-time, love my job, I walk a lot daily, do quite some slow yoga and some meditation, acupuncture, low dose aspirin for the last two tries, sleeping early and little light pollution at night for the last 2 months. But also have been def been sad and stressed around this situation from the second time (which has been hugely exacerbated by my GP's attitude), which contaminates stress in other parts of my life, and have been feeling physically uncomfortable with all the cramping which makes me want to be less social and more alone. Did share my situation with some friends and work and they have been very supportive and sweet. What else.

Oh yes, I have noticed a skin rash on my arms and hands in my luteal phase during the times I thought I was pregnant starting around 2 DPO - becoming inactive around 8/9 DPO.  
Also my right ovary has been hurting (not constantly but maybe lil stab daily, and now the pain is more prominent on that side while ovulation was on the other) since Jan/Feb (nothing found on ultrasound) and seems worse around ovulation (also when ovulation is in other ovary) & during bleeding. I think my first pregnancy came from that side. This is a symptom that I have had before though when I was low on iron.  
And I have sensitive bowels (quick to have loose stool) especially when stressed so that has not been great in the past months. It was actually fine during the first month of trying, deteriorated then for a few months, but got better during this month only to deteriorate again from 9/10 DPO.

My partners sperm has been tested for motility (65%) and morphology, normal morphology was 4% (after 3 days of abstinence), so slightly low but we don't have 3 days of abstinence during my fertile window, so we hope it is a bit better then.

To be honest, (unfortunately like many others I believe :() I don't have the best experience with my GP & gyna.  
I asked my GP this week to have vaginal progesterone for the next try, she said there is no proof it helps (I thought it may reduce the chance when you have had multiple early mc: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6516817/). She also asked me a few months ago after hearing me upset: use some LH strips to see if you are actually still ovulating without actually asking my anything about my cycle. She doesn't really believe the previous experiences were pregnancies as I did not use a test and says it can be normal to have several days of spotting and cramping outside of your menstrual cycle, and bleeding for 10 days (also when never experienced before). She refused to do bloodtests my acupuncturist asked for, which is OK, was worth the try. But then when I had them done somewhere else and found low progesterone, she did not want to look at it because she did not request those tests.

I asked the gynecologist if my low iron might be a problem, she said she did not know of any correlation between low iron and infertility but that it would be good to have my iron levels up (which I found confusing as I had did a little rabbit hole deep dive into it https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10285297/). She works in a large hospital where people get referred to when having trouble conceiving, and she also works as a fertility gynecologist. I have already heard two stories of people I know going to Belgium for fertility support bc they do more extensive testing and treatments in Belgium than where I live (Amsterdam, Netherlands), and that is actually quite common (sorry in Dutch: https://nos.nl/nieuwsuur/artikel/2473041-voor-een-baby-naar-belgie-duizenden-nederlanders-doen-het). I also did not find the job title for a reproductive endocrinologist in the Netherlands, and wonder if it actually exists over here, but cannot imagine it doesn't.

Hence, I am also calling upon the reddit oracle: what should I look into?  
I have read the following along some posts in similar situations:  
Ureaplasma, Hysteroscopy: uterine NK cells and endometritis, Ruling out endometriosis and adenomyosis, HLA DQ Alpha gene, Balanced translocation, homocysteine levels, fasting insulin, APS/antinuclear bodies, Karyotyping, (rash: progesterone allergy??)

Many thanks, I really appreciate any help/advice.

Community cat na inaalagaan ng katabing isa pang coffee shop at gasoline station. Yang babae na yan involved din sa discrimination sa mga buntis. Nung nagpost sila ng job hiring na hindi pwede ang buntis.

Huling huli na sa CCTV na sila ang kumuha ng pusa. Pero nung nagapproach yung kabilang shop kung aware ba tong babae na to sa nangyari, ang sinagot ba naman ""no need to update, wala akong paki"". Sabay travel and chill chill. Sinungaling!

Tapos nung pumutok na sa social media ang conversations nila ng kabilang shop pati ng kuha ng CCTV. Biglang nag-iba ang statement nya. Sabi nya kinuha daw nila ang pusa at in-adopt. Palusot!

Nung hinahanap na sa kanila ang pusa, wala naman silang maipakita. Nagbigay lang sila ng video ng isang pusa na nasa kanila daw. Pero nung tiningnan ng kabilang shop yung video, hindi naman yun yung pusa na tinutukoy nila. Mapag-imbento ng istorya!

Nagdeactivate ng FB profile si babae. Pati ng page ng coffee shop. Eventually nag-activate din ulit. Sabay kabig na sige tutulong daw sila sa paghahanap. Pero ang totoo nagtravel ang chill ulit sila somewhere.

Huh? Una wala kang paki pero kinuha mo naman talaga. Dahil may kuha ng CCTV biglang inaddopt mo na pala pero wala ka naman mapakita. Gumawa ka pa ng video ng ibang pusa naman pala. Tapos ngayon biglang tutulong sa paghahanap. Sinungaling! Walang iisang tahi ang istorya.

Buti na lang nahanap na ang pusa. Sa kabilang bayan pa nakita! May mga mabubuti pa ring tao sa mundo na may compassion sa mga hayop at nakipagtulungan.. Nahanap ang pusa na wala kang naitulong! Kasi ang intensyon mo talaga iligaw yung hayop! 

Tapos ngayon may mga post post ka na ganyan? Marami ka pang post tungkol sa mga basher mo. Ang tingin mo sa mga nagagalit sayo ay hater mo. Inosente ka? Bakit kaya nagagalit yung mga tao sayo no? Anong akala mo sa sarili mo wala kang ginawang masama? Napaka-kapal ng muka mong babae ka. Feeling almighty ka kasama ng circle of friends mong mga kunsintidor ng kawalang hiyaan mo. 

Kung makikita nyo lang yung ibang mga post at comments nyan malalaman nyong napaka walang hiya nyang babae na yan. Nagpa-interview pa sa mainstream media. Kakasuhan nya yung kabilang shop dahil daw sa paninirang puri. Sya pa ang may gana na magsampa ng kaso? Huh? Hoy babae ka, may resibo ng mga statement mo. Huling huli ka din sa CCTV. Anong pinagsasasabi mo?

Hindi mo kailangan maging 'pet lover'. Ang kailangan lang compassion. Ano namang malay ng pusa sa mga nangyayari sa buhay mong babae ka? Hindi ako mapagpatol talaga sa ganito. Pero tong babae na to iba talaga eh. Kuhang kuha ang inis ko.
Isa na ata tong babae na to sa mga pinaka walang kwentang tao sa lahat. Sinungaling. Makapal ang mukha. Feeling almighty. Antigas ng muka. Wala na akong pakialam sa itsura mo pero ansama ng ugali mo.

But, on my own I am drinking non stop.

Except when I have to work. No drinking before work. No drinking at work. Be functional.

My girlfriend was eligible for a trip to Israel because she is Jewish and got booked on one last week. This was done months ago.

We have been interested in adopting a cat. Right before my girlfriend left she found one on Petfinder. She was adorable and my girlfriend gave me the go ahead to meet the cat and make a decision.

Here is the time line. I took time off on Friday to Sunday. I had to work Monday and then had Tuesday and Wednesday off.

I met the cat on Monday a week previous to my time off.. Loved her. Was asked if I could pick her up the next day. I had to work that day but decided to call out in order to pick up the cat and spend some time with her at our place. Make her feel at home. Feed her and all that.

Started drinking when I got her home.

We watched some movies and I passed out.

I woke up at seven in the morning. I was supposed to work at one pm.

Was not feeling well. At nine I was starting to go through WDs. I called work and told them that I still wasn't feeling well and that I wouldn't be at work. No problem.

Started drinking again.

Two days off. You can imagine how that worked out.

I woke up on Sunday already starting to go through WDs. The cat wants food. My girlfriend has called me and said that there was a rocket attack near where her group was staying and I missed a phone call because I was blacked out.

The cat, by the way, was not ready to be left alone. I was supposed to work at one pm. It was ten am and I'm already coughing and know that I am not gonna make it eight hours without seizing. I check my work app and it turns out that I had requested the whole weekend off.

I feed the cat and call work. Apparently, work thinks that I'm supposed to come in. I send them evidence that I am, in fact, off.

Keep drinking. Know that I should probably slow down because I do actually have to work the next day. Totally don't.

The cat is doing well and loves me.

I wake up at seven am. The cat is sitting on my face. I need my blood pressure medication. I make the calculated decision to finish off the vodka. And have a sleep.

My girlfriend calls while I am asleep. The cat continues to sleep. I wake up at eleven am by my alarm and realize that I am still drunk. And that I have to go to work.

I make coffee. Take a shower. Brush my teeth twice. Squirt Visine into my eyes. Walk to work and just before I get there start pooping breath mints.

Yeah, still way wasted but for some reason no one cares to call me out on it. Not my boss or my bosses boss or even the assistant boss boss.

I power through the eight hour day. Then my boss keeps us for half an hour and I can do that even though I've been retching for four hours. Fortunately I have a bit of vodka.

I get home. The cat has been bored all day because even though I bought a bunch of toys the cat only likes the one that looks like a mouse.

Don't have to work the next day. You know what happens.

Finally get a call from my girlfriend. She is exited to meet the cat. Asks if I am going to meet her at the airport. With her parent. Which would have been okay if it was her mother but now it is her father, who I think has issues with my consumption, even though he also is something of a drinker.

I was so dunk that I made a beef bourgeois. A dish that involves pork and meat combined with cheese. All of which is not Jewish freindly. And I have a lot of it. Thinking about just giving it the closest homeless.

Got a notice that my vet wants to see my cat tomorrow. And I'm supposed to meet my girlfriend at the airport. With her father.

I have not been sober in seven days.

1kxcmiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/ytehainam_vn/comments/1kxcmiy/why_does_my_blood_pressure_vary_so_much_when/,üîé Why does my blood pressure vary so much when measured at home each morning?,"Blood pressure (BP) is **not a fixed number**‚Äîit's a dynamic physiological indicator that fluctuates naturally based on **circadian rhythm**, **nervous system activity**, and various environmental or emotional factors, especially in the morning.

# üß† 1. Morning fluctuations are physiological

In the early morning, your body releases **cortisol and catecholamines (like adrenaline)** to prepare for the day. These hormones cause:

* A slight **increase in heart rate**
* Mild **vasoconstriction** (narrowing of blood vessels) ‚Üí Result: a **natural rise in morning BP**

This is known as the **""morning surge""**. While normal, it can be risky for people with hypertension or cardiovascular disease if the surge is excessive or abrupt.

# ü©∫ 2. Common reasons for inconsistent BP readings at home

# ‚öôÔ∏è a. Measurement errors

* Arm not at heart level ‚Üí ¬±10 mmHg variation
* Talking, moving, or measuring without resting ‚Üí falsely elevated readings
* Cuff too loose, too tight, or misplaced ‚Üí inaccurate values

# ‚è±Ô∏è b. Inconsistent timing

* Measuring at 6:00 AM one day and 7:00 AM the next = different biological conditions
* Drinking water, coffee, or exercising before measurement also affects results

# üß† c. Autonomic and emotional effects

* Anxiety, poor sleep, nightmares ‚Üí heightened sympathetic nervous activity
* Anticipatory stress (""home white-coat effect"") ‚Üí artificially high BP

# ‚úÖ 3. How to measure and interpret BP correctly at home

**a. Best practices for home BP monitoring:**

|Condition|Recommendation|
|:-|:-|
|Time|Within 1 hour of waking up|
|Rest state|Sit quietly for 5 minutes first|
|Posture|Sit upright, arm at heart level|
|Measurements|Take 2 readings, 1‚Äì2 minutes apart|
|Recording|**average**Use the   of the two|

**b. Look at patterns‚Äînot isolated numbers**

‚Üí Don‚Äôt overreact to one-off high or low readings. Track BP **at the same time each morning**, under consistent conditions, for **5‚Äì7 consecutive days**. Then analyze the **trend**, not single data points.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è When to be concerned

Seek medical advice if:

* Morning BP consistently ‚â•140/90 mmHg (or ‚â•150/90 if age >60)
* Fluctuations ‚â•30 mmHg between days despite proper technique

**Disclaimer 2: English isn‚Äôt my first language, ChatGPT helped me with the phrasing**

Let me start with something that seems obvious to me:  
From what I read here, it seems that if the Airbnb matches the description and photos, I‚Äôm supposed to give 5 stars. And if it doesn‚Äôt, should I give 4? Honesty in the listing like accurate photos, accurate description is *the minimum bar*. It's the baseline. If the place doesn‚Äôt match the photos or the description, then yes, it deserves *less* than 4 stars. Not 4. Less. That‚Äôs not a good experience. That‚Äôs misleading.

But here‚Äôs the part where I seem to disagree with many hosts here: even when everything matches the listing, it doesn‚Äôt automatically mean it‚Äôs a 5-star experience.

Let‚Äôs be real. Everyone posts their best angles. If the bedroom window looks out onto another apartment block, it‚Äôs probably *not* in the photos. But if there‚Äôs a view of the Eiffel Tower or Central Park, then *of course* there‚Äôs going to be a big, beautiful photo of it. So are those two places equal? Should I rate them the same?

And depending on the kind of trip I‚Äôm on, I don‚Äôt expect or want the same things. If I go to Paris for the marathon, I‚Äôm looking for something simple, functional, quiet. But if I‚Äôm going for a romantic weekend with my partner, I might want something with charm, maybe a view, a certain feeling. Those expectations matter.

To me, a 5-star stay means *‚Äúwow.‚Äù* I was impressed. It went above and beyond. That includes both the place and the host.

Let me share a real example. I recently stayed in Italy, and this was a true 5-star experience.

Not only was the house spotless and beautiful, but it had everything we needed. A proper Italian espresso machine with a large selection of coffee. Plenty of towels. Toiletries. A welcome basket with fresh fruit and a bottle of wine. Nothing was missing.

And on top of that, the host was exceptional. He shared his personal mobile number. Gave us a bunch of local recommendations, including hidden gems we wouldn‚Äôt have found on our own. He suggested a restaurant by the lake and told us to book in advance. We did.

The next day, he asked if we had managed to reserve. When we said yes, he actually called the restaurant *himself* to ask them to give us a table with the best view over the lake.  
Then, the day before checkout, he told us there was no one coming after us, so if we wanted a late check-out, just let him know, no problem at all.

That‚Äôs what 5 stars means to me.

When I give 4 stars, it still means it was very good. I was happy. But I want to save 5 stars for something *truly exceptional*.

So when I read posts here that say:  
> ‚ÄúAs a host, I‚Äôd never host you again if you gave me 4 stars. It‚Äôs detrimental to a host and it‚Äôs Airbnb‚Äôs fault.‚Äù

Honestly, that just makes me want to stop using Airbnb altogether.

You're blaming your guests for something that isn't their responsibility. If the system is broken, why should we be the ones fixing it? That‚Äôs backwards.

Organize. Pressure Airbnb. Join forces. Switch platforms if you need to. But stop telling guests to ignore what 5 stars *should* mean just to protect your metrics.

Sometimes I‚Äôm booking a simple, affordable place that meets my basic needs. Sometimes I‚Äôm looking for a special experience. Of course those two places won‚Äôt have the same price. And they won‚Äôt get the same rating either. The Eiffel Tower view comes at a price ‚Äî and a rating.

**Bottom line:** it‚Äôs not the guest‚Äôs job to fix a flawed review system. That‚Äôs Airbnb‚Äôs job. Or yours, collectively. But don‚Äôt shift the responsibility onto us.",0,1748422760.0,airbnb_hosts,12,0.19,False

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** My ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. The type of connection I want also understands, accepts, and embraces the reality that there's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests that make someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress - it strives to embrace these more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way, while not being totally lost to them.
* **Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive sensations in which such interaction, of various sorts, creates an elated state of splendor. I peak with ideation and abstraction, and seek out others who do as well.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is inscribed onto one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavors.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations and thoughts. I also adore writing conversationally, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography is also something I dabble in, although not as much as I'd like. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, and coffee.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelg√§ngers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with. A person who understands that no one will ever be your clone and dares to take exuberant advantage of that fact seems required for the deepest sorts of bonds.** ¬†I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably detailed chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention; anything dazzling will also do. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",2,1748422494.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

1kxc3rk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kxc3rk,Ginger bug/soda recipe + Survey,"Hi r/fermentation,

I am currently working on my bachelor project, and my topic is fermentation. Part of my project is to create a digital tool, and I finished my first prototype (Unfortunately it's only in metric, would love to create a version for US).

[**Ginger soda/bug recipe - Template**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XsizU9rxH4FftM8bZpJdItJOoDp_ww73oEB7h_hfSxo/copy)

Also I would appreciate if you could take 2 minutes and fill out my quick survey!

[**Fermentation tracking - Survey**](https://forms.gle/uoW18dbYY1cZrUW39)

**Ginger bug/soda:**

My process for the bug was pretty straightforward. I started by dicing up some ginger and adding sugar to the container daily for the first three days, then gradually reduced the feeding frequency. I played around with different amounts, and the bug evolved along the way. Now I cut the ginger into slightly larger pieces, instead of a fine dice. After the initial active period, I only add more ginger once a week, plus on the days I use it to make drinks. I also switched to feeding it with sugar every second day, since I felt like it was getting too sugary when I did it daily.

For the ginger soda, I started with about 2‚Äì3% sugar, but nothing really happened. Then I tried using a store-bought juice with around 8% sugar, and that kickstarted things. So I increased my sugar content to roughly 7%, and after about three days of fermentation, I‚Äôve been getting pretty good results. One of my recent batches, a ginger turmeric soda, was made with 7% sugar as well, but I didn‚Äôt let it ferment long enough. It ended up still quite sweet and not very fizzy. For my current batch, I‚Äôm planning to let it go one extra day to see if that balances it out better.

I appreciate any tips you might have, I am planning to make a soda with filter coffee, because I am missing a nice fizzy coffee drink.

**TL;DR** Built a simple ginger soda tracker for my fermentation bachelor project (metric-only for now). Started tracking after some sweet/flat batches, now it‚Äôs more consistent. Sharing the tool + a short survey if you‚Äôve got 2 mins.

1kxc0zv,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1kxc0zv/im_tired_of_remote_jobs/,I'm tired of remote jobs!!,"Alright, I gotta get this off my chest. I'm seriously done with remote jobs!

At first, I thought remote work was the dream. Flexibility, no commuting, freedom to work from anywhere... all that jazz. But after 4 years, I‚Äôm realizing it‚Äôs not for me at all.

Why? Well here it goes..

1.Comfort zone - this is the biggest culprit. Real talk‚Ä¶ the comfort zone is a trap. It‚Äôs slow death with cozy pillows and decent Wi-Fi.

Comfort robs you of urgency. It makes you second-guess instead of strike. It makes you soft. And worst of all..it whispers, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre okay here,‚Äù while your soul‚Äôs screaming, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs f\*\*king go.‚Äù

Not anymore.

2. I feel like I‚Äôm stuck in a loop of isolation, distractions, and fake flexibility.

3. It messes with your head. My energy‚Äôs off. My focus is worse.

4. And the worst part? I don‚Äôt feel like a man on a mission. I feel like an idiot glued to a screen, just waiting for Slack messages, and for that ""Zoom call at 3:00 PM"" to start.

5. There‚Äôs also zero separation between work and life. My desk is my dining table, my bedroom, my everything. It‚Äôs not healthy at all. I mean how on earth people LIKE THIS?! Then I take a 10-15 min. break, and I go outside, so I can ""enjoy"" looking at the same stuff I looK at EVERYDAY - the street, the neighbor's house, the this, the that... I mean, it's actually freaking boring. 

6. I actually WORK WAY MORE when I'm remote. People even ask you to install apps on your phone so you can answer your colleagues. I mean, on my last job I realized that everyone was a workaholic. What gives?! Most of them were in their 20s with issues like ulcerative colitis and sh\*t. Jesus....

I can go on and on...

So, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm craving something different now. I want to be around people again.

I want a place where I walk in, get SH\*T done, feel the momentum, and actually WALK OUT with that sense of accomplishment. That's it. No post-work notifications. None of that sh\*t.  Switch off.

Office jobs (at least the good ones) create routine, structure, real teamwork. You actually bond with your team. You move in sync. You can feel the energy in the room. That‚Äôs what I need. I want presence. I want fulfilment.

I want to spark simple conversations, laugh at stupid sh\*t... like the old days.

And honestly, I need to DOMINATE again. Show up sharp, focus hard for 1-2 hours, (and then go out to smoke a cigarette or drink coffee and just... chat. Simple-talk).

Remote work diluted that in me. It really did. Office work brings it back.

I look back to 2018-2019, and 2020-2021... man, I was so happy. All those videos, and pictures with my old colleagues... man, all that matters. I was in the zone. Now I gotta get back!

Anyone else feel this shift? Or am I just built for the old school grind?",1,1748421491.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1kxbz8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShackAtTheNexusOfHere/comments/1kxbz8k/do_you_believe_in_gods/,Do You Believe In Gods,"Angela took a long sip of her drink as she regarded her date. He looked just like his photos on his online dating profile. The same thick, dark hair, the same trim muscular physique, conventionally attractive face, even the height of six feet, were all in order. He was wearing a shiny silverish gray button up shirt, with slick black slacks and polished black dress shoes. It was a clubbing look, and not what she would have expected from a man who had just asked her if she believed in God.

She set her glass down on the table, fought a nervous urge to twirl her curly red hair with her fingers, and looked into her companion's bright green eyes. She pursed her red lipsticked lips and swallowed the last drop of liquid before asking in an incredulous tone, ""Pardon me, Jerome, but did you just ask me if I believed in God?""

""No,"" came the patient reply. ""I actually asked if you believe in gods. Plural. Like, their existence, in general. If one exists, then they all exist.""

""Oh, I see,"" she replied warily. ""Are you some sort of Jesus freak, or what? If you've brought me here on false pretenses so that you can earn religious brownie points by subjecting me to the teachings of your church, I'm going to be very upset, and I'm going to leave."" She actually was getting angrier as she spoke, so the last words were spoken rather stridently.

""Well, please don't leave,"" Jerome calmly pleaded, his hands held forward in a placating gesture. ""I promise that I'm not spreading the word of any religion. I asked you here because I'm genuinely interested in you. I just want to know your thoughts on the subject. That's all.""

She almost demanded to know if he couldn't think of a better question to ask, to get to know her, but immediately began to feel foolish about that. It was a perfectly valid subject, after all, and would probably prove to be a lot more interesting than talking about favorite songs or movies. Beside that, she thought his pleading face was cute. She allowed her attitude to soften.

""Well, okay then,"" she said. ""In that case, the answer is no. I don't believe in God. Or gods.""

""Fair enough,"" he replied with a relieved smile that showed his perfect white teeth. ""But, why not?""

""Creationism, to begin with,"" came her quick response. ""We know how the universe works, with physics and biological evolution. There is no need for a divine creator to be the first cause that personally crafted every object in existence.""

He nodded, knowingly. ""Sure, but so what? There are only a few gods who are said to have created the universe in their stories. Most are not. It's not a necessary quality of all gods to have been that creator. Anyway, if gods are real, the stories about them don't need to necessarily be completely accurate, since they're told by humans. And you don't believe the stories anyway, so there's no need to quibble. You must have something better than that. What's the real reason?""

""Because,"" she retorted, ""the idea of some omnipotent, omniscient, spirit in the sky, who looks like a man with a long beard, and judges people for random things that he calls sins, just never made any sense to me. The idea is just ridiculous on the face of it, you know?"" 

""No,"" he replied with an air of disappointment. ""Nothing can ever be ridiculous on the face of it unless you have previously proved it to be impossible. It's like claiming that you've proved a general negative. Beside that, I never placed the qualifiers of omnipotence and omniscience on the question.""

""But, wait a minute. Isn't that a prerequisite of godhood?"" she asked while tearing a za'atar roll and smearing it with spinach dip. A single ear of einkorn, placed on top of the rolls as decoration, fell onto her plate. She glared over it defiantly while nibbling on the roll.

""Really?"" Jerome was saying. ""Was Pan omniscient or omnipotent? Was Damuzi, or Inanna, Anansi, Thoth, Sekhmet, Kokomothena, Marduk, Odin, Triton? Ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of the thousands of gods reported to have been encountered by humans were not said to be omnipotent or omniscient, nor omnipresent either. Even the tiny fraction that were, actually weren't.""

""Wait. Wait,"" she pleaded. ""I don't recognize several of the names you mentioned, but I know Odin was called the All Father, and I'm pretty sure Marduk was something similar. Weren't they supposed to be omnipotent?""

""No,"" he declared. ""It's very clear from their myths that they had limitations. Even in the Tanakh, Yahweh himself is shown dealing with certain limitations of his power.""

""Yahweh?"" she asked with surprise. ""As in God the Father? I know I've heard preachers say that he is omnipotent!""
 
""Of course you have,"" he agreed. ""In English. Which is not the original language that particular scripture was written in. Politically motivated translation into a modern language like English distorts the original meanings of ancient texts. Preachers and priests further distort things for their own purposes. Plus, Yahweh himself is older even than the ancient Hebrew culture, at one point being a part of the pantheon of El, which included his arch rival, Hadad. His character was altered somewhat when his previous history was scrubbed from the record."" 

""So, he's not the Almighty God, then?"" she asked, confused, but gaining interest.

""Oh, he's still almighty,"" Jerome explained. ""It's just that the term, almighty, really applies to his having exclusive access to all of the real power that actually exists in the real world. It does not extend to the silly parlor tricks that break the laws of physics, and would unmake reality, which people who get hung up on that modern word, omnipotent, tend to propose as some sort of proof of the non-existence of an intelligence greater than their own.""

""So that means there are no miracles,"" she mused.

""If by miracle you mean an act of some deity which alters events and situations in favor of their worshippers, then yes, there are miracles aplenty,"" answered Jerome as though it had been a question. 

""Most miracles I've heard of have broken the laws of physics,"" Angela said flatly.

""I'll bet that if you really think about that, you'll find that it isn't true,"" claimed Jerome. ""Most miracles are really rather mundane, in the larger scheme. Nothing that happens is impossible, therefore if something happens which seems impossible, it is far more likely to have actually been merely very improbable in the particular time and place in which it occurred. The laws of physics never get broken, we simply don't know enough to know all of the ways in which they might be manipulated. Even the gods have to learn how."" 

""Interesting,"" Angela said. She was actually enjoying the conversation, so far. ""But, if all of them are real, how can there be one called the one true god? What is the point of monotheism?""

""Excellent question,"" Jerome replied. ""Originally, the title of the One True God, or Most High God, indicated a seat of authority. He was the one with the power to command all the others, in a hierarchical pantheon of sorts, or to destroy any who wouldn't fall in line. Monotheism is a reflex of human desire. Religious devotees are like sports team fanatics. Their side is always number one, so their god is always the only true god, so others must not exist, according to their reasoning. Gods that they don't worship get demoted to angels and demons.""

Angela wasn't convinced. ""Hm,"" she murmured. ""And how does all of this mythology add up to me having to believe that any gods exist?""

""Oh,"" said Jerome. ""It doesn't. It only indicates that the main objections which you have are unconvincing. And, of course you shouldn't simply believe in something without good reason, either.""

""Yeah,"" she agreed with the last sentence. ""Okay. So, what's the good reason?""

""So, let's start with your definition of what a god is, first. It's important to define our terms,"" he said.

Angela frowned. She was a little surprised, and thought it was a bit late to start defining terms. ""Uhm, well, I suppose my minimum definition of a god would have to be something powerful, like way more powerful than any man, and smarter, too, of course. Moral perfection is necessary, I suppose. It would have to be physically perfect as well, and made of something different than material flesh, something spiritual, immortal, or there's no point."" 

""All right,"" he said. ""Right away, I'm vetoing the morality clause. Morality is subjective, and has never actually held up as a godlike quality. So, we've got power, intelligence, physical perfection, and immortality. That all checks out, but why spiritual? What do you mean by that?""

""Shouldn't a god be made of something other than what we are?"" she asked. 

""I suppose that all depends on your perspective.  It's a bit of an amorphous concept. What exactly is spirit, by your understanding?"" he wanted to know.

""I think it must be sort of like a living energy or something,"" she said, unsure of her answer. It honestly wasn't anything that she had ever given any thought to.

""A living energy?"" he repeated. ""Okay. We can work with that. The ancient concept was of a life force that allowed a body to move and be alive, so that's pretty similar. Of course, modern people know that the body moves by electrochemical impulses in the nervous system, controlled by the brain. Thought, as well, has a physical seat in the same sort of impulses in the neurons and synapses. So, spirit turns out to be a physical process, albeit one that cannot be directly observed in an easy way. But, if spirit is electrochemical impulses, what is a god that is only spirit?""

""I don't know, it's your theory,"" she said, perhaps a little too dismissively.

Jerome pushed through. ""Can we allow that a god may be composed of some exotic, but nevertheless physical, matter, which would necessarily have much more of these electrochemical impulses? That would place it within the realm of known possibilities in regard to evolution while mostly satisfying the demands of our current definition.""

Angela screwed up her face just a bit and replied, ""I guess that we can allow that, but just because a thing may be does not mean that it actually is. What you have now is speculative fiction.""

""That's perfectly all right,"" allowed Jerome. ""So far we've only been working up to admitting that the existence of gods is possible, and therefore not ridiculous.""

""Very well, Jerome, but what about immortality?"" she demanded.

""Oh that's an easy one,"" he said confidently. ""There are sea creatures which are immortal. There are invertebrates that can go into suspended animation for millennia, seeds that can sprout after millions of years. Immortality isn't even improbable. It just requires the right situation.""

""I've never heard of those things,"" she confessed. ""I'll have to take your word for it. But, what is the actual probability of such a god existing?""

""I couldn't guess at the numbers,"" he said, gesturing with his hands in the air in front his eyes. ""But I'd have to say the probability is actually pretty high. If a niche exists, something will eventually evolve to fill it.""

""Isn't that just a superior animal? What's so godlike about it?"" She thought she had him this time.

""Aren't you just a superior animal to a homo habilis?"" he asked. ""If you were to come across one of those fellows, with your long lifespan, comparatively giant stature, superior thinking ability, and magical seeming devices, mightn't he think that you're a god?"" 

""Perhaps,"" she conceded. 

""Right,"" he went on. ""The essential quality of the whole concept of gods is that whatever is smartest, strongest, and most superior, is a god. And something always holds that place.""

""Weren't you going to tell me a good reason to believe in these hypothetical beings?"" she asked, attempting to redirect.

""Of course,"" he replied with gravitas. ""There is only ever one acceptable reason to actually believe in any god, and that is that you have experienced that god personally. First hand knowledge is a must.""

They were briefly interrupted as the waiter arrived with three large platters of food. He was a funny looking fellow, with broad flat nostrils and a hirsute face. He wore a white linen cap that seemed much too big for his head, but was held up by his large ears. Tufts of curly, dark brown, hair jutted out below the cap and concealed his ear tips in a way that seemed almost deliberate. He walked with a peculiar gate, limping on both legs, and the tips of his shoes seemed never to quite leave the floor. Nevertheless he managed to balance the trays gracefully with his large, hairy, hands. The first platter bore a variety of appetizers made of olives, spiced meats, goat cheese, and grape leaves. Jerome's entree was lamb chops with a buttery sauce of rosemary and garlic. Angela's entree was baked chicken and potatoes with fennel and chopped figs. Their beverages were a house specialty made with a light mead. 

Several minutes passed in relative silence as they ate their food. They had both been made quite hungry by the intensity of their conversation. Angela chewed a morsel of potato with pensive deliberation, staring into the middle distance.

""What are you thinking about?"" asked Jerome. 

""I was just considering,"" she replied. ""If we are saying that this type of god we've come up with probably does exist, then it stands to reason that there is a possibility that the ancient gods existed, and were like that, allowing for the factual distortions of human storytellers.""

""Yes, of course,"" he said.

""So where are they?"" she demanded. ""They're immortal aren't they? They should still be around. We should be able to see them, if they're not at the bottom of the ocean. Or are they invisible?""

""Oh, they are still around, and not quite invisible,"" he opined. ""The human eye can't see what isn't moving, so the eyes move all the time and the brain compensates, giving steady visual input at a specific frequency range. The gods need only be moving at a separate frequency range to remain hidden. In fact, they likely inhabit a greater number of dimensions than humans do, as well. However, like all lifeforms, they have a barely perceptible luminescence. Unfortunately, it is drowned out by the light frequencies humans use to see by. Becoming visible to people in this dimension set requires an expenditure of certain energies.""

She blinked several times. ""That is not at all what I thought that you would say.""

""Oh? What did you think?"" he asked in amusement.

""I thought that you would say that they had come to Earth in a spaceship from some far off world. That they grew bored with us and all of our praying for an easier life, so they got back in their ship and flew back home. I know I would,"" she explained.

""Space aliens?"" he scoffed. ""Impossible! Have you not seen star maps that show our position in the Milky Way? We're in the middle of the Orion Spur, which is surrounded on all sides by light millennia of dark void. Nothing living would ever get in or out, in a space vessel. No, it's far more likely that the gods are homegrown, hyperdimensional entities."" 

""Well,"" she insisted, ""I think they could still be from a planet other than Earth. One that is also inside the Orion Spur. Hypothetically.""

""Okay, sure,"" he allowed. ""But, humans have never detected any type of signal that shows the existence of extraterrestrial life in this galactic neighborhood, and the search has been intense. It's difficult to credit.""

She stared at him. ""Seriously? That's your argument?""

He looked surprised for a second, and then laughed loudly when he made the realization. ""Ha ha! Well, I suppose, given the general subject matter we're discussing, maybe it is a bit rash to declare what is unknown to be impossible. Mea culpa!""

""Oh, careful!"" she said with mild sarcasm. ""That almost sounded like an admission to being wrong.""

He grinned. ""I'll always admit to being wrong, if I am, but only if you prove it to me. Then I'll change my mind. I hate actually being wrong much more than I hate having someone merely believe that I'm wrong.""

Neither of them had noticed that several other patrons of the bistro had now taken an interest in their conversation. 

A woman at a tabel across the room, with skin as dark as a moonless night, and golden stars bejeweling her deep black hair, stood from her chair and stared at the couple with eyes like galaxies. The ambient light moved from bright amber to deep blue as it passed through the veil of her proximity.

Meanwhile, a great scarlet viper with jagged bolts of incarnadine racing along it's coils unfurled itself from a table in the dark corner by the kitchen door, it's eyes flashing crimson flames. 

Throughout the bistro, similar characters had turned their attention to the couple and their unusual conversation.

""What was that thing you were saying about certain energies making gods visible?"" asked Angela, blind to the strange watchers.

""Oh, right,"" answered Jerome. ""In every myth, if a mortal wishes to speak with his god, he must go to a sacred place, and make a sacrifice. Any living thing could be a sacrifice to it's associated deity, usually being burned on an altar, but the most potent sacrifice was always blood.""

""Blood?"" she wrinkled her nose in disgust. ""Why blood?""

""Probably,"" he went on, ""because it is an obvious symbol of life. Once an animal has been exsanguinated, it's life functions definitely cease, including the spiritual processes of the brain. Spilling the blood is terminating the mind. Consumption and destruction. Energy, however, is never lost or destroyed, so it must be transformed. In such cases, it is transformed into a sort of key, that unlocks a direct connection between dimensions in spacetime, which allows the the establishment of contact between god and worshipper.""

""That's horrifying!"" Angela replied, shuddering in revulsion.

""So is the life of an obligate carnivore,"" said Jerome as he brandished the bone from his final lamb chop. ""At least they don't have to think about it. The universe is not inclined to honour our delicate sensibilities, as much as we might like for it to be."" 

""I'm sensing a sort of connection between meat eating and blood sacrifice,"" Angela said as she watched the bone drop to Jerome's plate, to rest with the others. 

""Probably,"" he agreed. ""I imagine that represents a paradox in human thinking that made us invent the concept of sin as a stand in for the unacceptable flaw of nature, that life is killing until you die. For most creatures, anyway.""

The waiter returned seemingly from nowhere, insinuating himself suddenly, as waiters are apt to do. 

""Has everything been to your liking?"" he asked. ""May I tempt you with some dessert, or perhaps some coffee?""

""Everything has been delicious,"" replied Jerome. ""And dessert sounds good. What do you think, Angela? Should we have something sweet?""

""Yes, I think I would like to,"" she said. ""What are the options?""

The waiter smiled, delighted to list the sweets on offer. ""We have milopita bougatsa, baklava, tiramisu, or chocolate mousse. We also have a citrus and pistachio cheesecake which is a house specialty.""

They agreed on the cheesecake, and the waiter limped away toward the kitchen as they resumed their conversation. They did not observe him as he gestured with some irritation toward his more exotic customers to retake their seats.

""You know,"" Angela said, ""I think there may be a completely different explanation for stories of people meeting gods, if we're still assuming there's any truth to them.""

Jerome's eyes widened in surprise as his smile widened with pleasure. ""Tell me your theory, please!""

""It seems to me,"" she began, ""that if mental energy is what they need to contact humans, and mental energy comes from or actually is electrochemical impulses in the brain, then maybe what the gods are, physically, is a thoughtform in the brain.""

""A thoughtform?"" he asked incredulously. ""Like a figment of the imagination? How could they perform miracles? How would they obtain multiple worshippers?""

""Whoa, slow down!"" she rejoined. ""It was you that said miracles were mundane. Humans can do it themselves, I suspect, if they've got a divine instructor in their heads. And religion gathers worshippers for their god just by telling stories to vulnerable people. They seem to be doing just fine."" She smirked and sipped her drink.

Jerome pursed his lips and furrowed his brow in consternation. He, too, sipped his drink. The two of them regarded each other in awkward silence. At the other tables, there were many arched eyebrows on inhuman faces that were raptly eavesdropping, anxiously waiting for the reply.

""Wouldn't that mean, though,"" he asked ""that other types of deity, which began as thoughtforms, could obtain a larger existence? I'm talking about obviously made up characters, like Glycon, Cthulhu, Xemnu, or the Flying Spaghetti Monster."" 

""Of course!"" she declared brightly. ""Remember, if one is real, then they are all real! Plus, I think Glycon actually has a modern worshipper. Some old English comic book writer, if I remember right.""

""Yes, that's right,"" he said as scratched his chin thoughtfully. ""I remember that story, too. Hm. Faith, then, creates the image of the god in other minds, where it spreads, like some kind of mind virus? And that forms it's own reality of mental energy, I suppose. Messy. Unobjective. I don't like it.""

The waiter returned, as though summoned from mythical aether, with two glorious slices of cheesecake, expertly plated with shelled pistachios, a curl of orange zest, and a drizzle of honey. The decadent dessert was so inviting that they spent several minutes just enjoying it together. 

Jerome paused halfway through finishing his cheesecake, and stared at a bite he had balanced on his dessert fork. ""You know, I'm wondering now. If faith produces the energies the gods require, then what effect does doubt have? It would have to be a negative one, I imagine.""

Angela swallowed the morsel she had been savoring, and washed it down with a long sip of her drink, before answering. ""Maybe, the doubt is actually the point. Think about it. They can't show themselves outside of the original brain they're inhabiting without faith. They can't manifest properly without a fully developed thoughtform in the newly introduced brains. If everyone believes in them the first time they hear about them, that's gotta spread them pretty thin. Doubt, on the other hand, creates a situation where people have to build the god up in their own mind, multiplying the mental energy instead of dividing it.""

Jerome had a quizzical expression as he considered her words. There was some implication in them, of a germ of a concept that he had never considered before. Unfortunately, in the moment, he could not grasp it. She smirked at him mischievously. 

""That, is, insane!"" he said finally. ""Absolutely bonkers.""

They broke into mutual laughter. Various entities in the bistro exhaled the breaths they had collectively been holding.

""So, wait a minute then. Does that mean that you believe in gods now?"" he demanded.

""Nope. Sorry. I still need to see some hard evidence. First hand knowledge is a must,"" Angela declared.

""Good! That's good,"" said Jerome. ""Keep an open mind, but never be taken for a fool. Say, should we stay for that coffee, or would it be better to go for a walk?"" He began to look around for the waiter.

A tall man dressed in black entered by the front door, accompanied by the doleful sound of a distant gong. His face was impossibly gaunt, the skin pallid and dessicated. The dust of ages clung to his ragged black shroud, and darkness swirled about him like the shadows of shadows, poorly imitating life. With milky eyes he cast his gaze around the bistro, until it fell inevitably upon a woman in a gown of verdant green. The floral fringe of her ample decolletage matched the hues of her soft dewy skin, and repeated in the vines that bound up her abundant green hair. The tall man grinned a disconcerting rictus smile, and glided in the woman's direction. She smiled at him radiantly as he joined her at the table. Other patrons observed them with attitudes of mounting alarm as she gesticulated animatedly in the direction of Angela and Jerome. 

""Let's get coffee to go, and you can walk me to my car. It's only just around the block,"" Angela decided.

The waiter came with the check. Jerome paid with his credit card, without asking Angela if she wanted to split it. She insisted on paying the gratuity, in cash, and for the coffee as well. The others watched as the two walked out the door. The tall man rose as if to follow them, but he was stopped mid-glide by a delicate hand with crimson polished nails. A sultry woman, in a slinky white dress that clung tightly to her body in the few places that it actually managed to cover some of her creamy soft skin, touched his chest intimately while passing between him and the door. She paused briefly to give the green clad woman a long lascivious wink, her soft pink tongue caressing her plump red lips, before sauntering out after Jerome and Angela, her hips swaying seductively. Her exit was accompanied by the sound of muffled trumpets playing a slow, rhythmic, tune. The remaining entities nodded to one another, as though something of grave importance had been decided, and resumed their roles as patrons of the bistro. 

As Jerome and Angela walked to her car, they refrained from speaking of gods, instead keeping their conversation light and untroublesome. They exchanged phone numbers for the first time, and promised to text each other when they had each arrived safely at their respective homes. Angela had worried briefly that she might have to fend off an offer to follow her home, but Jerome made no such suggestion. He watched and waved in a gentlemanly fashion as she drove away.

Angela waited until she was inside her apartment, with the door locked for the night, before she texted Jerome. ""Home and safe,"" read the text. ""Thank you for a lovely evening."" She was wondering whether to add ""let's do it again soon"" when she saw the little dots appear, which showed he was answering her. She waited a full minute, but the reply didn't come. She figured that he must still be driving. Deciding to just wait until he could safely text, she changed out of her date outfit, ditching her bra, and put on a long night shirt. It bore a picture of a chubby blue gnome girl sitting under a mushroom, and was secretly her favorite article of clothing. To it she added a pair of yellow ankle socks with pink polka dots and pink trim. 

Suddenly she heard the notification sound of her text messaging app, and looked at the screen of her cellphone. Jerome had replied, ""I am now safely indoors for the night as well. Thank you for an engaging conversation. We should do it again sometime."" She smiled, and as she considered how to accept his invitation, another text from him popped up. It read, ""On the way home I was thinking about our different theories. Is there any reason they couldn't both be true? Both things somehow happening at the same time? I thought I had an answer for a minute, but I lost it. I must be tired from talking your ears off. Brain not work good now.""

She chuckled, and sent the reply, ""If you're tired, go to sleep, silly man. We'll talk again later.""

""Promise?"" came his instant response.

""Yes,"" she answered. ""Good night, Jerome.""

""Good night, Angela. Sweet dreams,"" read his final text of the evening.

She shook her head in amusement, and went to bed herself. She layed down and pulled a duvet over her torso, leaving just her feet hanging out, turned off her bedside lamp, and closed her eyes. A sweet little smile still played on the corners of her lips. At the foot of the bed, invisible and un-dimensioned, sat the woman in white. She waited for Angela's consciousness to reach that borderland between the waking world and the land of sleep. Just as Angela was crossing over into deep slumber, the woman in white reached out with her red nailed fingers, touched Angela's foot, and sensuously slid her hand up the ankle, before sinking her nails into the tender flesh. She shared a soft gasp of pleasure with Angela as a warm wave of rapture spread up the leg and into her nethers, where it blossomed into bliss, flooding her brain with oxytocin and dopamine. Angela blushed in her sleep, an image of Jerome arising in her dream vision. The love goddess smiled sensuously with the pleasure of completing her performance, and rose, walking out of the apartment through the locked door, on her way to a similar encounter with Jerome.",1,1748421277.0,ShackAtTheNexusOfHere,0,1.0,False

But I kept at it. And now? I‚Äôm here to save¬†*your*¬†sanity.

Nurse, what‚Äôll you sacrifice to crush your degree?

The panic over discussion posts?

The dread of Canvas after a 16-hour shift?

What are some authentic ways to get closer to this man I like?,"Hi! My question is open to anyone with insight into creating a good relationship with a person who leans avoidant as their attachment style. 

Background: 
I‚Äôve met a lovely guy, an online match and we are about 5 weeks into talking and getting to know each other. I‚Äôm 47F, he‚Äôs 48. It‚Äôs possibly the slowest slow burn of my life, which is what I want in a way, to have a good friendship before all the rest. 

He‚Äôs gorgeous, humble, caring, and I feel calm around him. He has shared he‚Äôs identified that he‚Äôs a dismissive avoidant since the breakdown of his long marriage over a year ago. 

I‚Äôm conscious of not cramping his style but then also aware of not wanting to let go of my own needs or abandon myself in the process. We are in touch fairly regularly on text and speak every other day or see each other for coffee‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs relaxed but consistent. He asks thoughtful questions and seems genuine to me. 

Do you have any advice for me about dos and don‚Äôts? I tend to wait till he approaches or texts, I keep busy in my life, I‚Äôm pretty happy as things are outside of our new connection and not putting too much emphasis on it even though we enjoy time together. He can see I‚Äôm off with friends and travelling for work and not relying on him. 

I said ‚ÄòI sort of miss you‚Äô on text after not seeing him 4+ days and the next time we saw each other he admitted that when I wrote that it felt weird for him and he noticed he pulled away for a few hours. I‚Äôm glad he can be open with me. He wasn‚Äôt requesting anything different from me and admitted it‚Äôs a bit sad, and joked around that there must be couples who say lots of cute things to each other but he‚Äôs not that way. He sends cute texts - I see his effort to keep in touch. While it‚Äôs early days, I‚Äôm taking it as a good sign that he‚Äôs suggested we go out for dinner on Saturday night.

After I lost my dad, everything changed. I saw my mom breaking down silently while putting on a strong face every day. That hit me different. She sacrificed her entire world for me, and I just want to give it all back someday. A nice home, peaceful evenings, and the joy of seeing her relax for once ‚Äî that‚Äôs high up in my goals.

Now, about the future I daydream about (a lot): a beautiful wife who‚Äôs not just pretty but emotionally warm, silly, smart, and soft. Someone I can cook midnight Maggi with, cuddle during weekend movie marathons, and randomly dance with in the kitchen. A partner in all the little joys. I imagine us doing late-night pillow talks about life and dumb things, stealing kisses while brushing teeth, and planning spontaneous weekend trips. And yes, cheeky moments too ‚Äî those cozy cuddles on rainy nights, teasing each other, her wearing my hoodie and stealing my fries. 

More than just romance, I want us to be best friends ‚Äî laughing, fighting, loving. A team.

And then... a daughter. God, I really want a daughter. The kind of bond where she runs into my arms screaming ‚ÄúPapa!‚Äù after school, drawing crayon hearts for me on my birthday. I want to be the kind of dad who ties ponytails, packs lunch with cheesy notes, and tells bedtime stories that turn into life lessons. I don‚Äôt know why, but the idea of holding her tiny hand while crossing the street or watching her sleep beside me just melts me. I want to teach her strength, softness, and make sure she always knows how deeply she‚Äôs loved.

Financially, I‚Äôm not chasing crores ‚Äî I want a *decent package* that allows me to live in peace. Enough to take weekend trips, afford small luxuries, care for my family, and still have a bit to save. Quality over quantity. I don‚Äôt want to be rich in just money, I want to be rich in *moments*.

So yeah, that‚Äôs the goal. A peaceful home with laughter, a strong coffee game, happy parents (or parent), a fun romantic life, a daughter‚Äôs innocent giggles, and a job that doesn‚Äôt kill me but keeps me driven.

Let me know your life goals too, yaar. Curious what keeps you going. ",35,1748421047.0,TeenIndia,36,1.0,False

They really don‚Äôt pay any attention to me and only let me follow them to school because Anna makes them bring me. Anna is my nanny, she has been with me as long as I can remember. My dad is the beta of the pack and really busy, so Anna was brought on to teach me how to ‚Äòbehave like a lady,‚Äô which basically means teach me to be silent unless spoken to and out of the way of the men. She does nothing of the sort, but my dad doesn‚Äôt know that, as long as I make a good show when he‚Äôs around.  
  
My brother spends most of his time with the future Alphas, Killian and Zavier, the future Delta, Harry and the future Gamma Jason. They travel in a group wherever they go, they are almost worse than some of the girls here.  
  
Anna told him to make sure I got to and from school safely after I came home last week with a bruise under my eye and scrapes up my arm. I tried to tell her it was an accident and that I tripped, it was not a big deal, but she didn‚Äôt believe me. She knows I have been having trouble with kids at the school. I live in a werewolf pack that feeds on hierarchy and dominance, of course at some point we are all going to start trying to showcase our dominance, we‚Äôre middle schoolers.  
  
What I have seen though is it‚Äôs more the non-ranked kids who are trying to show off for the ranked kids. They are trying to gain status by being noticed. It‚Äôs funny to think that some kids are popular, just for the rank they were born into, not what they have actually done. Obviously, everybody wants to be the Alpha‚Äôs kids friends. That‚Äôs the height of all popularity. My brother, Harry and Jason aren‚Äôt far behind being rank born. I, however, don‚Äôt matter, even though I am the Beta‚Äôs daughter and have Beta blood. I am the reason that my mother is dead, and that is reason enough to shun me to lower than an Omega. That is why Anna fears for me, she has seen how kids openly treat me and no adult does a thing to stop it, not even my father.  
  
‚ÄúMove it fatty. You‚Äôre taking up the whole hallway and walking slower than a turtle. Are you sure you‚Äôre a wolf?‚Äù Natasha sneers behind me. I just move to the side to try and get out of her way. She sticks her foot between my legs and I trip sideways head first into a locker not being able to catch myself with my armful of books.  
  
The crash brings everyone to a halt. All eyes are on me, but the only ones I care about are my brother‚Äôs. He turned to look at the sound and when I made eye contact he just shook his head, rolled his eyes and turned to walk away, Jason and Natasha following him. The rest of the kids in the hallway disperse too, some laughing quietly, others not so quietly, but no one stops to help me up.  
  
7th Grade:  
  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you ever question my authority in front of another student again!‚Äù Natasha shoulder checks me into a door leading out to the courtyard in the middle of the school.  
  
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt question your authority, I told you that you can‚Äôt hit kids just because they are in your way. If you were late, that is not their fault.‚Äù I shouldn‚Äôt snap back at her, it only fuels her fire, but she‚Äôs starting to get on my nerves. She was late because she skipped second period to go get coffee with her friends and was late getting back to third period, who happens to be a teacher that will report her to her father. Although nothing ever seems to happen when she is reported.  
  
I right myself, set my focus down the hallway and move to walk away from the door that was holding me up, but before I can get two steps, Bianca, one of Natasha‚Äôs little minions steps out to trip me, then proceeds to dump her iced latte on my head. I hear cackles of laughter then others join in, meaning we attracted a crowd.  
  
I look up to see my brother and his friends joining in with the laughter. ‚ÄúMaybe if you trained a little harder and lost some of that baby fat, you wouldn‚Äôt be so clumsy.‚Äù Natasha says not-so quietly to me then, ‚ÄúHey boys, are we up for hanging out at the fire pit tonight?‚Äù To my brother and his friends.  
  


Chapter 2

skylynn  
  
Fall of 8th grade  
  
‚ÄúCome back here you little b\*tch.‚Äù A brunette goes flying by me with Barbie number 2, Leona, stomping after her awkwardly in her wedges and skirt so short and tight I wonder how she managed to keep all her bits covered making the smallest of movements, let alone attempted running. She looks livid and I can see the other two Barbies coming up behind her, strutting, since running or normal walking is not possible in the sky high shoes they are wearing.  
  
I don‚Äôt know what happened, but these three came back from their summer trip abroad and decided they were the queens of the school and normal rules of decency didn‚Äôt apply to them. They were never what anyone would call nice, but they didn‚Äôt outwardly harass people either.  
  
As the beta‚Äôs daughter it was my job to make sure all pack members were protected, even from our own. My father may not want me or take me seriously, my older brother was the true beta, but I took my rank and status seriously anyway since that is the one thing he beat into our heads since birth. We were not to embarrass him in any way as the Beta, the image was the most important thing to him.  
  
I step in front of Leona, hands up hopefully in a sign of peace. ‚ÄúWhy are you chasing her? What did she do, Leona?‚Äù  
  
Leona almost falls over trying to stop her momentum in her sl\*tty getup.  
  
‚ÄúShe got me a D on my paper! That little b\*tch was supposed to make me sound smart and get me an easy grade. She purposely got me a bad grade to embarrass me in front of the new teacher. Get out of my way, skylynn.‚Äù She snarls at me and tries to push me out of the way looking at me like I am some piece of trash under her designer shoe.  
  
‚ÄúDid you pay her to do a good job, or did you just pick a smart kid in your class and tell them they were doing your work?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWhat does that matter? I am a warrior and she is just an omega. She is beneath me and should be glad I was talking to her in the first place.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúHer rank and yours have nothing to do with your school work, and last I checked you are no warrior. You are lazy, and don‚Äôt make time to train, let alone be considered competent. That‚Äôs your fault, do your own work. Leave her alone. She didn‚Äôt volunteer and you didn‚Äôt pay her, she owes you nothing.‚Äù I refuse to move from her path. I don‚Äôt have my beta aura yet, but I figure fake it until you make it right. I stand up as tall as I can, which is not much at my five foot nothing height, and keep stepping in her path as she tries to step around me, to keep her away from the girl. As a ‚Äòwarrior‚Äô she should be more agile and be able to easily step around me, but training isn‚Äôt on this ‚Äòwarrior‚Äôs‚Äô agenda.  
  
‚ÄúYou need to watch what you say to your betters, you murderer. You are not worth sharing breathing room with. Your dad thinks so, your brother thinks so. No one wants you around, so move.‚Äù Natasha sneers as she walks up and steps around Leona. Bianca, hot on her heels like the good little minion she is, forms the triangle they have decided makes them the most intimidating. I think they have seen Mean Girls too many times. ‚ÄúNo one cares about you or your worthless opinions.

**Tuesday, May 27**

I had a good breakfast, a coffee and I watched¬†*The Virgin Suicides*¬†while smoking my JNR. Then I did push-ups, 28 in total. Two more than yesterday.

That was the prime of physical media, when there was a lyrics booklet in the CD cases.

\~Here I am, all clean, fully dressed, Doc Martens with the laces tightly tied, ready to meet my friends at noon. 12:04, ‚ÄúL‚Äù cancels. ‚ÄúM‚Äù cancels. Everyone cancels. Fuck it. This afternoon, I‚Äôm getting drunk. I‚Äôm tired of being treated like the king of fools. And for my appointment to renew my prescription this afternoon, fuck it. I‚Äôm cancelling it. The medication doesn‚Äôt help me anyway. I don‚Äôt feel like going out. I don‚Äôt give a fuck about anything. I don‚Äôt give a fuck about administrative paperwork, I don‚Äôt give a fuck about the baccalaureate, I don‚Äôt give a fuck about the outside world. Everyone always lets me down. I only have my music with me.

\~I don‚Äôt wanna draw. I don‚Äôt wanna read. I don‚Äôt wanna study. I don‚Äôt wanna do anything, really. I‚Äôm just in bed, watching movies, trying to fight sleep, trying to fight suicidal thoughts. I could take a warm bath, take one of my razor blades and cut my wrists. Or I could swallow every pill there is in this place with my vodka, go to sleep and never wake up. But I won‚Äôt. I know there is something better waiting out there for me. Maybe that‚Äôs the worst thing, knowing that. Knowing there is hope. Because if there wasn‚Äôt, I would kill myself for sure. Right the fuck now. But there is hope. So I will go to sleep for now. I‚Äôm very sleepy.

\~4:36 PM. I wish I‚Äôd slept a bit more. But after staying in bed for thirty minutes with my eyes closed hoping to fall back asleep, my thoughts got darker and darker, so I decided to get up. Mom came back. I have no messages on my BlackBerry. No one trying to talk to me, no one making an effort to answer me. I think I‚Äôll just get drunk until tonight, and tomorrow we‚Äôll see. But I think I‚Äôll just go buy another bottle.

\~

Using a BlackBerry only the last past few days made me realise how fucking useless and utterly stupid Iphones are. Don‚Äôt need this shit. People who like me will reach me, really, not with stories or streaks. Fuck that. I‚Äôm a fucking twat, and I like it. I wish I was on¬†*The Boat That Rocked*, I would fit in so nicely. I can‚Äôt wait to find a place like that, where I‚Äôm surrounded with people who get me. I don‚Äôt really see a lot of people, but the truth is I am a social person. I love people. I also hate them. That‚Äôs what makes my character so intricate and complicated‚Ä¶ I think I like being a mystery. No one really knows me or my full story. Most people my age are dumb as fuck, but there are some gems out there who deserve my attention. When I like someone, I know they are special. I know they are‚Ä¶ different. Because for me to like someone, it takes a little something, a little spark, a little scintilla of¬†*je ne sais quoi*. But I know how to spot those people. And when I do, I truly care for them. Most passionately. I don‚Äôt have many friends, but the ones I‚Äôve got, they are treated as royalty. Because I know how to recognise talent, kindness, and loyalty. Sometimes I get fucked, true. I‚Äôve often been told that I am like ‚ÄúBuddha‚Äù, too nice, too forgiving. That‚Äôs true. So what? What if I give away my last 20 bucks to a hobo so he can get drugs, what if I answer a 3am phone call to a friend in need, despite my need to rest, what if I care too much? I like being that way. Fuck what everyone else says. I love my friends, no matter how much they hurt me. And I hate most people, no matter how they try to help me. Reading that back made me realise how pretentious I sound, so thank god nobody is going to read this shit. I wanna buy some more vodka, and some more CDs‚Ä¶ I want to know all the music, all the artists, big or small. I think I‚Äôm on the right track, according to the music people I talk to to buy CDs and vinyls. Most of them are surprised about my music knowledge given the fact I‚Äôm only eighteen. They probably don‚Äôt know that, as Jim Morrison said, music is your only friend until the end. And I live by that.

\~Fuck, my heart is racing again from anxiety. And like the fucking crackhead I am, I swallowed all my lexomil to feel high so I don‚Äôt have any now that I really need some to calm down. I‚Äôm gonna try to calm myself down with some more vodka. I don‚Äôt even know what fucking day it is. I wish I had some weed right now.

\~I just adore Bill Nighy. Such a good performer. I‚Äôm replacing my Naruto framed poster with a¬†*Velvet Goldmine*¬†one I just printed out. God, sometimes I just love living in the future.

\~6:12PM: Today I drank 35cl of vodka. Until now. Not sure if I‚Äôll drink more, but it‚Äôs probable. Oh, man, the things I‚Äôd do for a spliff right now‚Ä¶ Still watching¬†*The Boat That Rocked*. Nowadays, days blend together and movies last for the same amount of time, and I love it! Mostly because my WIFI is crap, and it takes forever to watch one single fucking bloody movie. I would die for some weed or sleeping pills right now.

\~Felt the urge to cut myself again. Instead, I took a 4-color red BIC pen and drew red lines on my ankle, as hard as I could press. Feels good to see all this red on my skin, and the sting from it. Still over two years sober from cutting my skin though. That‚Äôs a win I guess. I wish I could cut one line. One single tiny line of open skin. But I know that this one line would turn into ‚Äúoh well, I‚Äôve already cut a line, another won‚Äôt do anything and no one will know‚Äù. And I will fall into this pattern of self-harming again, when I‚Äôm already an alcoholic. I don‚Äôt know what else to write. Thanks to ‚ÄúM‚Äù, my favourite cousin ever to have pushed me to write everything down since I was ten. I think those years of writing in my diaries have helped me to sort out my feelings. Sometimes I write in English, sometimes in French, whatever feels the easiest at the moment. I like to write in English because if someone finds out about this diary, especially my mom, they won‚Äôt understand a single thing. And English has all these words to describe feelings that French don‚Äôt have. I guess French people were more into describing objects, elements and other material and subjective stuff than feelings like the English did. I loved reading¬†*Jane Eyre*¬†more than¬†*Zadig*¬†by Voltaire. Both are similar in stories (quite, I mean just storytelling), but¬†*Jane Eyre*¬†was so relatable. English words are made to describe feelings whereas French words are made to describe things. Fuck. The vodka is starting to hit again. I wish my Iphone wasn‚Äôt broken so I could transfer some money from my savings to my actual spending account to buy myself a Smashing Pumpkins CD on Vinted.

\~Depression is really a terrible thing. I spent my entire day drinking and laying in bed watching movies. The evening I just layed in bed with my eyes closed for hours, thoughts coming and leaving, filling the silence in my bedroom. Dreadful thoughts. Just hoping that at some point I‚Äôll fall asleep. My mom came in my bedroom to kiss my forehead when I was pretending to be asleep, multiple times, and told me she loved me. As soon as she left, I wiped my forehead. It‚Äôs so fucking weird. I always felt like an orphan, and now there‚Äôs a strange woman coming to check on me from time to time. But I don‚Äôt know her, and she doesn‚Äôt know me. Who the fuck is that woman? I mean, I know her name, I‚Äôve lived with her most of my life, but she‚Äôs an absolute stranger to me. I have blurry memories of her chin, because I was so short it was all I could see, crying and craving motherly love. Now I‚Äôm like fifteen centimeters taller than her. But nothing. I never got anything, except for that distant blurry view of her back, because my eyes were so full of tears. I wish I had a proper mom growing up. Maybe I wouldn‚Äôt be so fucked up, or maybe it was just in my genes from the beginning. Now, I‚Äôm quite suicidal and a strange woman is kissing my forehead. I‚Äôm waiting for her to go to sleep so I can resume my moping in front of my computer. Right now I‚Äôm still in bed, writing this on my BlackBerry. I tried getting up, but I instantly felt nauseous and dizzy, so I laid back down. And I‚Äôm writing random thoughts on an ancient device that no one will ever read. So what‚Äôs the point? Well, writing it down helps me organize this flow of thoughts, and even though it won‚Äôt ever reach anyone, I feel like I‚Äôm being listened to. Just earlier this evening, I thought of writing a will, in case I die. But even that, I could not manage. I don‚Äôt own that much stuff, and I could not explain my death to anyone if it happened. This morning I watched¬†*The Virgin Suicides*. I kinda feel like this movie could explain how there is no explanation sometimes, and we just have to leave it at that. I feel so alone. Today I heard ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt miss what you never knew‚Äù from¬†*The Boat That Rocked*. I half agree, half disagree. But maybe it‚Äôs because of my huge imagination. I tend to make up things in my head and sometimes end up thinking it‚Äôs real. I don‚Äôt really have this separation of reality vs what‚Äôs in my head. I crave love so bad, and I reject it just as much because it is such a strange and‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, new, unknown, distant thing to me. I am kind of repulsed by the whole idea, because I never felt that. So here I am. Me. Eighteen years old, laying in my bed in a pitch black room, writing down some morbid thoughts on my BlackBerry, because no one would mind reading this shit, even less listening to me complaining out loud. Why is my mom not going to bed, fuck. It‚Äôs already 10:35PM, and she‚Äôs still in front of the fucking TV. If she hears me move, or sees light through the gap at the bottom of my door, she will come and cry, cry, cry and fucking cry endlessly, begging me to get better, like that‚Äôs gonna help. Sorry for sounding like an asshole, but I feel so disconnected from this reality, and this family, and this life in general. Tomorrow is Wednesday, I just checked. I am supposed to go to school and pick up some stupid paper or whatever. I don‚Äôt give a fuck. I‚Äôll probably come in drunk, wearing a skirt to piss off my homophobic teacher even though I‚Äôm not into guys, pick up my paper, ask to go to the bathroom and fucking leave the school to go back to my bedroom.

\~Fuck my life. Writing this as mom is sitting right next to me on my bed, staring at me writing on my computer, crying and shit. She‚Äôs saying how much she wants to be with me in this fight. Lmao. She wasn‚Äôt ever there for me when I needed help. I‚Äôm kinda numb right now. She‚Äôs crying. Saying I‚Äôm sorry and shit. Well, that‚Äôs cool. When I was crying, she didn‚Äôt do shit. Now I‚Äôm the one ignoring her cries. There‚Äôs only a candle lighting the room. Ah, fuck, she‚Äôs crying on my shirt again, asking me to forgive her. I don‚Äôt really give a fuck to be honnest. I used to cry too, I used to beg for help too, I used to feel despair too. And no one was there. Now I feel fucking nothing. Thanks, mom. Like crying on my shirt saying you‚Äôre a bad mom is going to make me feel any better. This diary and my music. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs always been there for me. And that‚Äôs it. The only thing I know for certain is always going to be there. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm a bad person for not giving a fuck that my mom is crying like a baby in the next room, or that the fact that I‚Äôm upping the volume of my music to not hear it. Not because it makes me feel sad, because it‚Äôs quite annoying. Maybe that‚Äôs the worst part. But at least I had the decency to not tell her all the things she‚Äôs done wrong in her life as a mom, especially to me but also to my brother. Whatever.",2,1748420810.0,rant,0,1.0,False

1kxbuc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1kxbuc8/another_chatgpt_story/,Another Chatgpt Story,"**Title: In the Shadows of Silence**
 
In a bustling city where life never seemed to pause, there lived a woman named Maya. From the outside, she appeared successful: a graphic designer thriving in her career, with friends who enjoyed her quirky sense of humor. However, beneath her vibrant exterior, Maya struggled with a profound silence that echoed within her‚Äîa silence that stemmed from a pattern of behavior that she could neither understand nor control.

Maya had always been sensitive. As a child, her emotions ran like rivers, deep and tumultuous, but they were met with a fortress of stoicism by her parents. After years of being told to ""calm down"" or ""stop being so dramatic,"" she learned to stifle her feelings and retreat into a shell whenever tension stirred around her. This inclination morphed into an avoidant freeze response during her adult life, especially when it came to romantic relationships.

When Lou entered her life, Maya was drawn to him instantly. He was kind, attentive, and the complete opposite of the loud, chaotic world she often felt overwhelmed by. Their chemistry sparked quickly, and for a brief moment, she revelled in their budding connection. Yet, as they grew closer, Maya began to feel the weight of her past training creeping in. The moment Lou expressed his desire for deeper intimacy, an invisible wall shot up within her.

Suddenly, her laughter faded, replaced by an unnerving stillness. Conversations that once flowed effortlessly became stilted. When Lou leaned in for a hug, Maya felt herself freeze, her body betraying her heart's desire for connection. It was as if her mind screamed, ‚ÄúRun!‚Äù while her heart whispered, ‚ÄúStay.‚Äù This internal conflict left her paralyzed.

One evening, under the warm glow of twinkling fairy lights at a caf√©, Lou sensed the shift in Maya's demeanor. ‚ÄúIs everything okay?‚Äù he asked, concern etched on his face. A question that should have felt innocent bore the weight of her fears. As she stared into her coffee, the world around her blurred into a haze of sound and color. The familiar urge to withdraw tightened its grip, and her heart raced, caught in a struggle to articulate her feelings. Instead, Maya smiled weakly and nodded, sealing herself deeper within her walls.

In the weeks that followed, Maya‚Äôs silence grew louder. Lou tried to reach out, but each time he did, she felt herself slipping away, retreating like a tortoise into its shell. Despite his gentle reassurances, the closer he drew, the further she drifted. Her mind twisted the narrative: ‚ÄúIf I let him in, he‚Äôll see how inadequate I am. He‚Äôll leave.‚Äù The realization that her own fears were sabotaging the beautiful connection made her feel even more trapped.

One day, after an agonizing week of avoidance, Maya made a bold decision: she would finally reveal her struggles to Lou. With trembling hands, she texted him, asking to meet. As they sat across from each other at their favorite park, she could feel the weight of unshed tears welling up inside her.

‚ÄúMaya, you seem distant lately,‚Äù Lou said softly, his voice a mixture of concern and love.

Taking a deep breath, she unburdened herself. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always struggled with intimacy. When things get close, I just... freeze. It‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt let anyone in because I‚Äôm terrified they‚Äôll see the real me and run away.‚Äù 

Lou listened intently, his gaze unwavering. ‚ÄúMaya, I‚Äôm here for you. You don‚Äôt have to hide from me,‚Äù he said. His words were like a lifeline, but Maya felt the familiar urge to retreat clawing at her insides. Yet, anything felt better than staying in silence.

In that moment, something shifted. Bursting through the layers of her defenses was a flicker of hope. She realized that vulnerability didn‚Äôt equate to weakness; it was a bridge to deeper connection. With effort, she began to share her fears and experiences more openly. Each conversation felt like a small step out of the shadows, and although fear still loomed, it felt a bit more manageable.

Gradually, Lou learned to navigate Maya‚Äôs unique rhythms, understanding when she needed space and when she needed support. He never pressured her but remained a steady presence, showing her that she could trust him without the fear of judgment or abandonment.

Maya's journey toward connection was not instantaneous. It involved relapses into silence and moments of uncertainty. Yet with each shared laughter and every gentle gaze, she learned to embrace love rather than fear it.

Over time, she came to understand that while her avoidant freeze response was a part of her story, it did not define her. With Lou by her side, she discovered that together they could create a space where vulnerability flourished, one small step at a time. And in that space, love‚Äîan unwavering light‚Äîbegan to shine.",0,1748420700.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,0.33,False

Got a wild question for you.

Hang with me for a sec and hear me out.

Cool?

Here‚Äôs the deal‚Ä¶

I used to live on coffee and 4-hour naps.

12-hour ER shifts. Patients first, always.

I thought I‚Äôd breeze through nursing school.

Then, 3 a.m. study sessions after doubles had me rethinking life.

But I kept at it. And now? I‚Äôm here to save *your* sanity.

Nurse, what‚Äôll you sacrifice to crush your degree?

The panic over discussion posts?

The dread of Canvas after a 16-hour shift?

It‚Äôs tough‚Äîpatients, family, exams like dragons.

1kxbt3t,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Tarlia/comments/1kxbt3t/things_to_do_in_kuching/,Things To Do in Kuching,"*(Last Updated: 28 May 2025)*

I've answered this question a number of times in r/Sarawak so I decided to compile my replies into one master list of Things To Do in Kuching (and Samarahan) - *according to me*. These things will include arts, culture and entertainment that may be a little less obvious and trickier to find, especially since most of these don't tend to appear on Reddit. 

The reason I have this information is because it is of interest to me - I look out for their events and/or I tend to be part of that community. I'm not your tourist guide, I'm not paid or sponsored to do this, and therefore I'm not obligated to make this list ""complete"". 

If you have something to add to any of the sections below, leave a comment with the relevant info.  If you know if anything listed here that is no longer valid, let me know and I'll do my best to update. If you don't see anything in your interest bracket here, you are welcome to compile your own list; I'll be happy to link to your post.

For opening hours, entry fees, or any information that isn't provided here - jangan malas - follow the links provided or Google it yourself. If you want to know when the next event is, don't ask me; ask them.

With that out of the way, here's my list:

# Things You Didn't Know You Could Find in Kuching

**Spoken Word Poetry** \- [Word of Mouth KCH](https://www.instagram.com/wordofmouthkch) is a spoken word poetry show happening once every two months.

**TTRPG** \- Table Top Role-Playing Games are hosted at [HAUS KCH](https://www.instagram.com/hauskch/) once a month.

# Museums + Activities

There are many other museums in Kuching other than **Borneo Cultures Museum (BCM)**. Last I heard, the **Old Sarawak Museum** was [running free guided tours](https://www.facebook.com/story.php/?story_fbid=753503366572006&id=100057370489056&_rdr) for the building twice a day but I'm not sure if this is still happening. You need to check at the info counter at BCM. I don't know what the status is but at the time, we were able to go in and look at the restored building and the murals on the walls.

The **Islamic Heritage Museum** is also pretty cool. Again you have to check if it's open; last I heard it was closed for renovation. BCM should be able to tell you.

**Chinese Heritage Museum** on the Kuching Waterfront is small but quite packed with info and artifacts.

**Cat Museum at DBKU** \- Only if you really like cats. It's a collection of all things cats - paintings, sculptures, crafts, decorations, etc. Not sure if the cat mummy is still there. The collection doesn't get updated so it's a one-visit wonder. View from the building is spectacular though.

**The Brooke Gallery (Fort Margherita) and Ranee Gallery (Old Court House)**. They have a discounted admissions fee if you visit both museums. Make a day trip of this - park near Old Courthouse, take the sampan to the other side and walk up to the fort. I think you can also use the S-bridge; it's just gonna be a longer walk. Then go back to OCH for the Ranee Museum.

[**Sarawak Heritage Society**](https://sarawakheritagesociety.com/) and [**Friends of Sarawak Museum**](https://friendsofsarawakmuseum.org/) organise talks from time to time. You can follow them on Facebook for updates or email them to be added to their mailing list.

# Art  + Activities

[**Hoan Gallery**](https://www.instagram.com/hoanartgallery) and [**Artavern**](https://www.instagram.com/artavernsarawak) at **La Promenade, Samarahan**. Hoan rotates their collection fairly often so it's worth repeated visits. Their Instagram is up-to-date. Artavern is next door and is the studio of three local artists. You can visit and look at their gallery as well. Make a day trip out of it - Visit the galleries and then go get lunch/dinner or coffee on the ground floor.

[**Urbansketchers Kuching**](https://www.facebook.com/groups/760234620666841) \-  They gather somewhere once a month or something like that to sketch scenes from the street or at events. They post updates on FB.

Seven years into my marriage, I cheated.

It happened the day after catching his wife in bed with her himbo assistant.

Furious, I confronted her. But she just looked at me calmly, completely unfazed.

‚ÄúLucian, don‚Äôt forget our agreement. This marriage is mutually beneficial. As for our personal lives, we agreed not to interfere with each other.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou crossed the line.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you think it‚Äôs unfair, go find someone else.‚Äù

The air froze.

For a long time, my eyes brimmed with bloodshot red as I rasped, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really okay with me going out and finding someone else?‚Äù

‚ÄúSuit yourself.‚Äù

Two light words, yet they struck like a thunderbolt.

Seven years of marriage had turned into nothing more than a joke.

‚Äúfather, I‚Äôve decided to go back to Asteria City.‚Äù

I called my father.

All these years, I walked away from being Wade‚Äôs golden boy‚ÄîAsteria City‚Äôs richest heir‚Äîjust to scrape by with Serena in Helios. Left my name, my family, everything.

Now that everything had become clear, staying here meant nothing to me anymore.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going back to Asteria City? What about Serena?‚Äù

My father sounded surprised.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm divorcing her.‚Äù

There was a long silence on the other end before he finally let out a heavy sigh.

‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs your decision, then come home, son.‚Äù

When I returned, the moment I opened the door, I saw Serena.

‚ÄúWhere have you been? Why are you back so late?‚Äù

Seeing me frozen there without moving or saying a word, she came towards me.

‚ÄúThe overseas project went well, so I came back early.‚Äù

I was surprised. This was the first time Serena had ever taken the initiative to explain her schedule.

Back in the day, even asking about her work would‚Äôve earned me that icy glare, like I‚Äôd just committed some unforgivable sin.

‚ÄúLucian, I have my own work. I have my own life.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe may be married, but I‚Äôm not your caged songbird.‚Äù

And every time, I would apologize right away and promise never to interfere with her again.

But now, even though she finally offered an explanation, I didn‚Äôt feel the slightest joy. Instead, I found it pathetically amusing.

A business trip abroad?

Just earlier, her himbo assistant had sent me a photo.

‚ÄúI casually mentioned wanting to see the Northern Lights, and Serena brought me to Iceland.‚Äù

In the photo, they were passionately kissing in front of a glacier, embracing tightly under the aurora.

‚ÄúThis is your schedule. You don‚Äôt need to explain it to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a bit tired today. I‚Äôd like to rest early.‚Äù

I replied flatly, turned, and was about to head to the bedroom when she grabbed my wrist.

‚ÄúLucian, I brought you a gift.‚Äù

She handed me a beautifully wrapped box.

Over the years, this had become a silent tradition between us‚Äîwhenever one of us traveled, we‚Äôd bring back a gift for the other.

I opened the box to find a glittering diamond cufflink.

Just one.

It was expensive, but incomplete.

Noticing my slight frown, Serena leaned in for a look.

‚ÄúMust‚Äôve been the sales clerk‚Äôs mistake,‚Äù she said, coughing lightly, clearly guilty.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll get you a new pair next time.‚Äù

Even she knew how poor the excuse was.

But I no longer cared enough to question her.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine. Thanks for the gift.‚Äù

Expressionless, I took the box and went straight into the bedroom.

After packing my things, I picked up my phone‚Äîand saw Ellis, Serena‚Äôs assistant, had just posted on Instagram: ‚ÄúAnything I want, you‚Äôll give it to me.‚Äù

In the photo was the exact same cufflink‚Äîmy missing one.

Serena had not only liked the post but commented with a heart emoji.

Even though I already knew everything.

Even though I had already made up my mind to leave.

Seeing my wife flirt so openly with another man still made my heart feel like it was being crushed by an invisible fist.

**Chapter 2**

‚ÄúLucian, I‚Äôve booked your flight to Asteria City. It‚Äôs one week from now.‚Äù

My father‚Äôs message pulled me back from my spiraling thoughts.

One week left.

To bring closure to this seven-year marriage, I came up with a farewell plan.

On the first day, I went to the church where Serena and I got married.

It was here we became husband and wife. And it was here I made a silent vow‚Äîto protect Serena with my life.

But now, standing in this familiar place, I didn‚Äôt know when my eyes had started to blur with tears.

A lifetime... was too long. I couldn‚Äôt keep holding on anymore.

On the second day, I cut up every piece of clothing Serena had ever given me and tossed them into the bin.

I pawned all the jewelry and donated the money to children in impoverished regions.

On the third day, I visited the company Serena and I had built together.

Once it was on the right track, I had stepped down to let her shine, to help her build the image of a strong, independent woman. I stayed home, managing everything and became a househusband.

Now that I was leaving, I wanted to see this place one last time‚Äîa place I had poured my heart and soul into.

‚ÄúExcuse me, sir, who are you looking for?‚Äù

As soon as I stepped inside, the security guard stopped me.

‚ÄúMr. Wade!‚Äù

Then came Ellis.

‚ÄúOh! Isn‚Äôt this our Vice CEO? Mr. Locke, so you know him?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy apologies, sir. Please don‚Äôt report me to Mrs. Wren.‚Äù

The moment Ellis acknowledged me, the guard‚Äôs tone shifted completely.

Vice CEO?

I looked at Ellis‚Äîstill dressed like a college boy, youthful and smug. I couldn‚Äôt help but scoff.

Just days ago, he was a small assistant. And now? Vice CEO?

At this rate, Serena would probably hand him the entire company soon.

‚ÄúMr. Wade, are you here to see Serena?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs in a meeting right now. Why don‚Äôt you wait in my office for a bit?‚Äù

Ten minutes later, I found myself in my old office on the top floor.

Ellis handed me a cup of coffee and grinned.

‚ÄúI heard this used to be your office.‚Äù

‚ÄúSerena said the lighting here is the best and the view is amazing. She told me I deserve the best in the world, so she gave it to me.‚Äù

He paused, smiling at me with amusement, but I could see the smugness and mockery in his eyes.

‚ÄúI only came here to apply for an internship,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúI bumped into Serena in the lobby by accident.‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought I was doomed, but instead, she added me on her contacts and made me her personal assistant.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe cares about me. Every business trip‚Äîno matter where‚Äîshe takes me with her.‚Äù

‚ÄúI said I liked sunflowers, so she planted an entire field just for me. She even picks a fresh bouquet for me every day.‚Äù

He pointed to a vase on the coffee table, filled with sunflowers. His eyes sparkled with pride.

I clenched my pale knuckles, fighting the bitterness rising in my heart.

No wonder Serena had dug up all the roses I had painstakingly nurtured in our garden a few months ago and replaced them with sunflowers.

When I asked her why, she dodged the question.

‚ÄúSunflowers are great. They‚Äôre bright and uplifting.‚Äù

Turned out that was because Ellis liked sunflowers.

I gave a bitter smile. She had completely forgotten the promise she made to me seven years ago when she planted that rose garden with her own hands.

‚ÄúLucian, the more beautiful the roses bloom, the more passionately I love you.‚Äù

Now the roses were gone. And so was Serena‚Äôs love.

Worse yet, she had forgotten I was severely allergic to sunflowers.

Seeing my expression darken, Ellis smiled even wider.

‚ÄúAlready upset, Mr. Wade? As a man, you‚Äôve got to be more mature.‚Äù

‚ÄúBesides, you might‚Äôve tied Serena down with marriage‚Äîbut you‚Äôll never tie down her heart.‚Äù

I looked at this smug little brat flaunting his victory and gave a cold smile.

‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre the one who sent me those photos?‚Äù

I thought he might try to deny it. But to my surprise, he admitted it openly.

‚ÄúYeah. I figured it was better than letting you cling to your delusions.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong, Mr. Wade? Seeing Serena and me together‚Äîare you losing your mind with jealousy?‚Äù

‚ÄúSerena told me more than once‚Äîyour messages annoy her. She never even reads them.‚Äù

His voice rose with every word, and his eyes gleamed with cruel satisfaction.

I gave a bitter chuckle.

He wasn‚Äôt wrong.

Every conversation between me and Serena had always been one-sided.

‚ÄúSerena, I made your favorite barbecue ribs today. Want to come home for dinner?‚Äù

‚ÄúSerena, the weather says heavy storms today‚Äîneed a ride home?‚Äù

‚ÄúSerena, dinner at home tonight?‚Äù

‚ÄúComing back?‚Äù

‚ÄúBack?‚Äù

Thousands of texts sent. A dozen replies. Back then, I told myself that‚Äôs just how Serena was.

But now, watching her and Ellis trade messages like it‚Äôs nothing, I got it. There‚Äôs no ‚Äùjust how she was.‚Äù Only ‚Äùjust not for you.‚Äù

‚ÄúSave the speech, Mr. Locke.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve got the guts, make Serena divorce me.‚Äù

‚ÄúOtherwise? You‚Äôll always be the thief who stole these‚Äî‚Äù I flicked the cufflink on my sleeve, one of the pair Serena gave me last week. The other‚Äôs tucked in Ellis‚Äô pocket.

His face darkens. I turn to leave‚Äî

Then the office door bursts open. Security slams me to the ground before I can blink. Behind us, Ellis‚Äô voice cuts through:

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the cufflink thief. Beat him!‚Äù

**Chapter 3**

What a joke!

The diamond cufflinks were a gift from Serena to me. One of them had been stolen by Ellis, yet he had the audacity to accuse me of theft?

I couldn‚Äôt be bothered to argue. I picked up my phone, ready to call the police.

‚ÄúEllis, since you want to throw dirt at me, fine‚Äîlet‚Äôs have the police decide.‚Äù

But before I could even dial, Ellis lunged at me and snatched the phone from my hand.

He smashed it violently to the ground.

‚ÄúCall the police? Someone like you?‚Äù

Then, without warning, he swung a heavy punch at my face.

Shards of my phone scattered at my feet. The world spun around me as a rush of blood filled my mouth.

‚ÄúThat cufflink was bought at an overseas auction by Serena, and gifted to me. If you didn‚Äôt steal it, how would the one I lost end up with you?‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh‚Äîout of sheer disbelief at this man‚Äôs shamelessness.

‚ÄúHow did it end up with me?‚Äù

‚ÄúEllis, I‚Äôm Serena‚Äôs husband. You‚Äôre the third party!‚Äù

But I hadn‚Äôt expected that revealing the truth about my relationship with Serena would have no effect on him. Instead of panicking, his expression turned even more mocking.

‚ÄúHusband?‚Äù

‚ÄúMr. Wade, the one who isn‚Äôt loved is the real third wheel.‚Äù

At some point, a crowd had gathered to watch.

Heads lowered, murmurs spread:

‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen this guy in the company before, and he‚Äôs claiming to be Mrs. Wren‚Äôs husband? What a joke!‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly. That guy‚Äôs clearly out of her league. Has he even looked in a mirror?‚Äù

As the crowd‚Äôs comments became more and more one-sided, Ellis looked even more smug.

‚ÄúGive it up, Mr. Wade,‚Äù he sneered.

‚ÄúTo Serena, you‚Äôre not even worth a toe of mine.‚Äù

Then he signaled security, who stepped forward and pinned me down. One blow after another rained down on me.

Lucian, after seven years of marriage, you‚Äôve ended up getting stomped on by a homewrecker. What a pathetic excuse for a man you‚Äôve become.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing?!‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know how much time had passed before a familiar voice shouted from the distance.

I struggled to raise my head. It was Serena.

She froze when she saw me lying on the ground, battered and bloodied.

Ellis, on the other hand, dropped his arrogant act in an instant and slipped into a falsely innocent tone.

‚ÄúSerena, not only did this man steal the other cufflink you gave me, he‚Äôs even claiming to be your husband.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was just too angry‚ÄîI wanted to teach him a lesson.‚Äù

Clenching my jaw against the pain, I forced myself to stand.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm one of the owners of this company. Funny how I didn‚Äôt know employees could treat their boss like a thief.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd unless I‚Äôm misremembering, you and I are legally married. Since when did I become the other man?‚Äù

‚ÄúSerena, don‚Äôt you have anything to explain?‚Äù

My words caused the crowd to go silent. They looked between me and Serena, clearly shocked.

All eyes darted between me and Serena. When she didn‚Äôt deny it‚Äîjust stood there silent‚Äîtheir gazes shifted to Ellis, sharp with new suspicion.

His face flushed, then paled. Clutching Serena‚Äôs arm like some wounded puppy.

‚ÄúSerena, I only took the cufflink because I really liked it‚Ä¶‚Äù

After a long moment, Serena finally spoke.

‚ÄúLucian, let me take you to the hospital.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs for the cufflink‚Äîif Ellis likes it, just give him yours.‚Äù

Her words stunned me.

‚ÄúAre you serious?‚Äù I asked, my voice trembling in disbelief.

I‚Äôd known our marriage lacked love, but after seven years, I‚Äôd thought even the coldest heart would warm with time.

Clearly, I‚Äôd been wrong.

When I didn‚Äôt immediately hand over the cufflink‚Äîand even had the nerve to question her‚ÄîSerena‚Äôs face darkened with annoyance.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a cufflink, Lucian. You‚Äôre a grown man‚Äîcan‚Äôt you be generous to a younger guy?‚Äù

Hearing her try to justify this with such hollow words, I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh.

Be generous?

Fine. If that‚Äôs what she wanted, I could give up everything‚Äîthe cufflink, and the marriage too.

I ripped the diamond cufflink from my sleeve and tossed it on the ground.

Then I turned and walked away without looking back.",1,1748420411.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False
