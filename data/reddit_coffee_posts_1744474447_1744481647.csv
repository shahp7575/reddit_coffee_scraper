1jxnjdc,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jxnjdc/do_i_really_need_dual_boiler_1000/,Do I really need dual boiler? [<$1000],"I’ve been using a Bambino to pull one latte and two espressos every morning. That’s pretty much it. It takes me 12 minutes from beginning to cleanup and I’ve been happy with the result. 
The steam wand has suddenly stopped working well, like losing 50% of power overnight. The solution is probably just descaling and cleaning the tip. But…
What if this is a great excuse to upgrade the machine? I do have a good grinder so I’m only asking about the coffee maker. 

Silvia Pro X seems like a perfect choice but it is a bit pricey for me right now. I do like the dual boiler since I understand that a single boiler requires more time to switch from pulling to steaming. 

Then Profitec Go, and Gaggia Classic Pro in descending order. 

Coming from the Bambino that heats up almost immediately and is very quick to produce steam, which works well for my morning rush, will I hate the two cheaper options?

Thanks in advance.

1jxngbl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1jxngbl/aita_for_changing_my_mind_about_caring_for_my_mom/,AITA for changing my mind about caring for my mom,"Get your popcorn ready and grab some wine!  There are multiple parts near the end that even made my therapist go “WTF”!!

My family and I LOVE your AITA, we’ve watched your channel for years! We watch you so often that even my husband watches and chimes in on your videos.

I (47F),husband DH(45M) have been married since 2007.  My family is from South Africa, I met and married American while working in Dubai, moved to the States. My parents and sister(43F) stayed in SA. I left SA years before marrying for many reasons, my family life was never a good one. My MIL paid for entire wedding, paid for my parents to be part of wedding and that didn’t work out well. I’ll post in updates about family life saving space for this post.

DH and I welcomed a girl a little later, paid for my family to fly and meet her. Only my mother(68F) wanted to come over. 3 years after our daughter now(16F) I was diagnosed with Multiple sclerosis.  When my daughter was 5 I changed MS medications to something newly approved by FDA. Potential serious side effects, I asked my mother for help to care for my daughter and paid for her to fly over for a month to help.  My father Skyped me and asked how I was planning on making sure my mother could send back money to SA during this time… I told him it was not my concern and he was a grown man!

My mother had a return ticket to return to SA. She was NOT on the plane back to SA.  She had chosen to leave my dad and sister in SA. My dad is an abusing a&&hole, had been our whole lives and is one of the reasons I left SA. Many parts to this story, it’s been 11 years and my mom still lives with me!  The first 8ish years that she lived in our home she was not required(and didn’t have time) to help care for my daughter, contribute or participate in anything towards our home.  She didn’t babysit, didn’t help when I had MS relapses, nothing. She did pay for the occasional cleaning service to clean the house but stopped during COVID.  I didn’t want her to do laundry for me because ALL my clothing would shrink. We also went through 2 washing machines because she doesn’t care to treat the washing machines well.
When she did dishes she would chip all the dishes from banging them against the granite, chipping both the plates and granite.

During this time, she also sold her home in SA(she was still sending money to support my sister) and brought her to USA on a visit visa! I told her that this was illegal and sister would eventually be deported. My mom continued with her decision, regardless of my wishes. Suddenly my sister was staying in the same room as my mom without my permission! another mouth to feed, added to utilities, all the costs with caring for another person regardless of me saying I did not want this!!

My mother found an apartment for sister within a week and paid her rent.  My sister was now in the States illegally too! My mother paid for me, my child, sister and herself to go to Jamaica after 6 months of my sister living here to help “reset” her US visit visa status.   My child and I are US citizens so we were fine.  During the Jamaica stay my mom was extremely disappointed that I spent most of my time with my daughter and didn’t spend my time “bonding” with my sister. My child could not do anything good in my mom’s eyes and could NOT understand why I had to have my child with me for every experience! Even my sister noticed my mom’s constant nit-picking of my kid and mentioned it to mom. The moment we came back through customs my sister was flagged. I again said that my mother was in the wrong for bringing my sister over illegally and needed to make a plan to have her removed from the US or work on making her legal! My wishes were ignored.

The whole time my sister lived in the US, mom and sister kept trying to force me to have my mother have more of a say in my home. My sister tried to play “mediator”, trying to say my mother should have a say in what color her room. She wanted to be told what color siding we were putting on our home, what home improvements we were making in OUR house.  OUR house that no one contributed to, no one helped with nor spent time with us as a family. 

6 months after my sister had her visit visa “reset” she vacationed in Jamaica for 2 weeks to “reset” her visit visa a second time.  This time ICE flagged my sister and she was detained for a few hours.  She was graciously given 30 days to vacate the US or ICE would come looking for her AT MY ADDRESS. The entire time she lived in the US, MY HOME ADDRESS was her legal address!

I(AGAIN) told my mom to find another country for my sister to live or send her back to SA.  Both mom and sister had NO IDEA what to do next.I’m very fortunate to make many friends in many countries so I found a country that didn’t require a visa for South Africans to live/work in. Found her a job, fully furnished apartment and a group of expat friends in Tbilisi Georgia. That was 2018

My sister worked at the job I got her for TWO whole days before saying teaching was beneath her. 3 years ago, life became more expensive and I asked my mom if she would contribute $1,000 a month towards rent.  This would cover her utilities, food and general maintenance of the room she lived in, in my home in northern Virginia.  Rent for a room in this area starts at $2,500/month so I thought it was reasonable.  She had not paid anything before, besides a short time of paying for a cleaning service($500/month)

During sister’s time in Tbilisi Georgia(the country) she didn’t work, my mom paid for all her expenses living accommodation and pocket money.  I’d see weekly insta posts of  how my sister was going to the spa, getting amazing treatments all on my mother’s dime.  At a point my sister had cancer and my mother paid for ALL of my sisters.  She stopped contributing $1,000/month because she had to pay money for my sister’s cancer treatments. I Never complained about this, she is my sister.  My sister had a mastectomy and hysterectomy on separate occasions that I was only told of AFTER it happened because mom “didn’t want me to stress out about it”.  I told my mom that essentially we pay for ALL my mother’s living expenses (giving her the ability to pay for my sister’s cancer) we were making financial sacrifices so that we could support her and that makes it fair for me know what’s happening to my sister!  Every time there was a major medical issue, I found out via instagram even after asking to be kept in the loop.  I had a mastectomy in 2020 with reconstruction, my family knew before it happened.  After my sister’s (to me a surprise) mastectomy I saw pictures of her healed mastectomy and how BRAVE she was to have it done. How she was “not vain and chose not to have reconstruction because she’s not vain”!!!

Cut to present time:
I spoke with my mom and told her that she is getting old and NEEDS to learn to stop enabling my sister.  My sister needs to finally support herself and if my mom cannot make my sister support herself then I would need to help my mom do it.  I told my mom in January to find an apartment, so that she could learn how expensive it was to live in this area. That if she still wanted to keep supporting my sister she would need to find a new place to live in the hopes of making her realize that I was serious.  My mom found apartments and discovered that the lowest rent in low income areas can run $2,500/month.  I said my mom should look into senior living facilities that have apartments/freedom to do whatever but a community where she would always have help if she needed it.  That would be WAY too expensive for my mom to pay AND give my sister money each month.  My sister STILL does not work and has finally thought of learning the language. (Since 2018)

DH and I spoke about it, we realized that my mom maybe has 5 years to work before she cannot anymore. My mom has minimal savings, no social security and no future plans.  Potentially in 5 years my mom would be living with us again and be our financial responsibility again.  I pleaded with my mom, told her that the whole reason I wanted her to look for apartments was to “teach” her how expensive life was here and that whatever good fortune I have in life does not immediately become hers and my sisters.  I wanted her to see that it is time for my 45 year old sister needs to stand on her own two feet!  My mom said that she cannot leave my sister stranded, understandable.  I resigned myself to the a fate of always being my mom’s second choice. It was a liberating feeling because any inner need to please my mom left me after I had a good cry.  My daughter held me while I cried, not my proudest moment and I never wanted her to see me that hurt.  

After a long conversation I told my mom that it makes financial sense for her to just continue staying in my home.  I said that she has a few good years to work left and collect savings. my sister will NEVER be able to financially support mom nor would she be able to care for my mom.  I asked my mom if she thought my sister would ever be able to support her and I think she still believes that if my sister lived here she would do it???  My mom would never move to Georgia to live with my sister.  It would be financially EASIER on DH and I if my mom stayed here, saved up more money for her retirement.  I told my mom that DH and I had no other option but to care for her in her old age, we are ready to take on the responsibility of it.  This would mean that staying with us to save up money instead of spending it on rent would make caring for her easier later on. My mother asked my opinion on her moving out and I told her (pleaded with her to help me out by saving) for her own future.

The logistics of her moving means that she would save less when she moves out and when she can no longer work DH and I would have to lug all of her stuff back into our home to care for her.  I pleaded with her to just stay here to collect more money for the future to relieve that financial burden we would face when she becomes older.  My mom agreed with me and said that what I told her makes perfect sense.  I thought this meant that the decision was made:  She would continue living with us, as she has for almost 12 years.  Nothing would change except that she would be able to save more future for when she cannot work.  The more savings she has, the less money DH and I would need to spend on her when she’s older.  I had resigned myself to her living here and things would be as they always have been.

My mom came to DH and I to say she is moving out. She would pay double or triple the “rent” she pays her, pay insurance, utilities(reducing her savings potential) She will be paying EXTRA to get a new car loan(DH co signed loan and she’d take out a new loan to take DH off) My mom didn’t listen to my wishes of making it easier on us financially to care for her.  

I essentially said that I would be the one caring for her in her old age, I had said that she would be my financial responsibly.  I feel that she thinks that because of me marrying wealthy, she can take advantage of my nature but assuming that no matter what she decides, I will be her backup plan.  I feel disrespected, that she thinks because we have been this generous all these years that it’s okay to continue paying for my sister and when she gets old she will be my burden and her life is set!

HERE IS MY PROBLEM:  AITA for thinking that because she once more has decided to not respect my wishes, I don’t need to financially support her in old age?  I  have sent mom an email on what long term care policies/health insurance/funeral policies to consider to financially prepare for her future.  Mom has decided to not do any of it.  Essentially, not worrying about her financial future. I would not cut her off or make her care for herself.  
I have expressly said that I WILL NOT GIVE MY SISTER A BLUE DIME! Ever!  If my mother would die suddenly, I DO NOT have the money to support my sister.  Besides my sister telling me and my family to “F8ck and die!” Multiple times, I have no interest in a relationship with her.  I feel that mom has always me her second and my sister the golden child.  I will try to post examples from my childhood about how I was always the second choice. 

I AM READY TO ACCEPT MY JUDGEMENT!

EXAMPLES OF WHY MY MOM HAS NO RESPECT FOR ME:
My therapist has told me that each person can control their own narrative of a situation.  I would love to say that each person may have their own perception of a situation but these are some of my memories.  

*my mother has lived with us for so many years but has not spent a full Christmas Day with her grandchild. She is always busy doing other things.  My mom expects us to “put a pin” in present opening. She sticks around for an hour or two Christmas morning and then returns in the late afternoon(when dinner is ready) and expects everyone to be happy because she spent time with us.

*She lives in my home but has always treated it like a hotel.  She wakes up, gets coffee and breakfast to eat in her room.  She goes to work, comes home and goes to her room.  She watches TV, gets something to eat in her room and we see her the following morning to repeat the pattern.  I have asked her for the last 11 years to NOT have food in her room(that means eating in it) but once more she does not respect the rules of our home.  Often complaining that *sometimes* my daughter has eaten cereal while in bed so why can’t she!

*I had major ACL surgery a few years ago. DH took a week off work to care for me. He went back to work and asked mom to take ONE DAY off work to care for me. Make/bring me a meal. Get me water or pain meds during the day… My mother went to work after leaving me with a cooler with a yoghurt and a PB&J sandwich in it.  We have a multilevel stair home so getting to the kitchen or bathroom was a challenge.

*I told my mom after many years about the abuse at my father’s hands, my mom started crying and said:”that’s why you never wanted to spend time with me. I always thought you hated me”. I wouldn’t say she is a classic narcissist but I spend many hours in therapy, trying to learn how NOT to communicate with my child.  I want to break the cycle and give my child a healthy relationship with herself and her mind.

*my daughter has always had self-esteem issues and my mom would constantly look at her and tell her how “big” she looks, “you look like a pack-horse with your backpack on!”

*I was 11 years old and had my first UTI/yeast infection. I told my mom and she LOST it! I MUST be having sex, that’s why I have a yeast infection.  She insisted on checking to see if I had a hymen.  I did not even know what periods were, sex was a word I had no clue of.  She refused to take me to the doctor because it “work itself out”

*I tried committing multiple times as a teenager and adult(leaving to me eventually leaving SA) I one day asked my mom why she didn’t think of paying for therapy. She said that its was WAY too expensive and assumed I would either get over it, figure it out and finally be successful at ending it all.

* My mother paid for my sister to go to college, it was only one semester of college because my sister didn’t attend ONE class during her time at college.  I am four years older and they were never able to “afford to send me to college”. I worked at the college while studying and improving myself.  Anytime I have a major event in my life where something good happens to me, my mother will tear up and cry.  This makes me think she is extremely happy/proud of me!  What it she always ends up saying is how sad she is at the time of my “luck”, my mom visited a psychic who told my mom that one of her children would always be very lucky or fortunate and the other would always have bad luck and have nothing to show for her life.  Now anytime something “lucky” AKA something I worked hard to achieve, both DH and I shout loud as hell that I found this “LUCK” at the crossroads of hard work, perseverance, determination and opportunity!! I’ve never believed in “luck” for anything that’s happened in my life financially.

*at our wedding while standing in the receiving line after our ceremony, my dad looked at me and said loud enough for people to hear:”your MIL is going to kick the bucket soon, does that mean you’ll be a millionaire?  I should’ve asked for labolla(SA dowry) Several guests mentioned this to my MIL and my MIL knew I am not like the people who raised me.

*My parent had a free vacation to come to Washington DC for my wedding. All expenses in the capital of the US, so many places to visit and experiences to have.  My family spent the entire month of their time here sitting in a room in my MIL’s home, drinking alcohol and watching NCIS reruns. AN ENTIRE MONTH!  No interest in seeing the sights of DC, museums were boring and “not their cup of tea”…

* I never had a relationship with my mom, she never was there for me.  Mom always tells me how she dreams of this amazing connection with my 16 yr old child but has NEVER had time to spend with her.  She has never spent time knowing her interests, babysat her or knows her birthday!  Mom laments from time to time that she is so disappointed that she doesn’t have a relationship with her only grandchild (she is the ONLY grandparent that my child has) a fact that’s just occurred to my mom.

1jxnfjn,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1jxnfjn/rediscovering_life_embracing_the_unexpected/,Rediscovering Life: Embracing the Unexpected,"Hey Redditors,

I wanted to share a little journey of self-discovery that’s been reshaping the way I see the world. We all have moments when life pulls us in unexpected directions, and sometimes the best path is the one we stumble upon when we least expect it. This is my story, a narrative of rediscovery, creativity, and reconnecting with the true essence of living.

The Spark of Change

For as long as I can remember, I’ve chased the conventional path—good grades, a steady job, and a comfortable routine. But as life has a way of doing, I hit a wall. I began to question: What truly makes me feel alive? That inner voice nudged me to step away from the well-trodden trail and venture into the unknown.

Key Moments That Changed Everything:

A Pause to Reflect: Instead of plowing forward relentlessly, I took a break. I spent quiet afternoons journaling by the window, surrounded by the soft hum of nature.

Diving into the Arts: I revisited the creative hobbies I’d abandoned—sketching, photography, writing, and even experimenting with digital art.

Unexpected Encounters: Some of the most vibrant ideas and friendships came from spontaneous conversations with strangers, coffee shop encounters, and even late-night chats with old friends.

Crafting a New Narrative

The beauty of life is that it's never fixed; it's ever-changing, evolving, and waiting for us to write new chapters. I realized that embracing uncertainty and welcoming change can lead to some of the most eye-opening experiences.

Tips to Reinvent Your Routine:

1. Celebrate the Small Wins: Every step forward is progress. Whether it’s trying a new recipe or finally starting that book you always meant to read—the small victories matter.


2. Step Out of Your Comfort Zone: Even if it feels daunting at first, trying something new can reveal hidden passions. Sign up for a class, join a local meetup, or simply explore a part of your city you haven't seen before.


3. Connect Authentically: Share your journey with friends or even on platforms like this one. The exchange of thoughts and stories enriches us in unexpected ways.



I found that sharing these experiences not only lightened my own load but also opened up conversations with people who were on similar journeys. There’s an unspoken bond among those who dare to venture off the beaten path.

Embracing Imperfection

One of the most striking lessons I've learned is that perfection is an illusion. Life's beauty lies in its imperfections—those messy, raw moments that make us feel human.

Embrace your quirks and imperfections; they're the brushstrokes that complete the masterpiece of you.



Sometimes, being eye-pleasing isn’t about flawless presentation; it’s about genuine authenticity. When we show the world our true selves, our scars and all, we inspire others to do the same.


Moving Forward with Intent

As I continue on this journey, I remind myself that every day is an opportunity to reinvent, rejuvenate, and reimagine what life can be. Whether you're standing at the crossroads of change or taking just one small step toward a new dream, remember: the beauty of life is in the journey itself.

I’d love to hear your stories. What small change made a big impact on your life? Let’s spark a conversation and inspire each other to keep exploring, growing, and, most importantly, living authentically.

Stay curious, stay bold, and keep embracing the unexpected!


Thanks for reading, and here's to finding beauty in every moment.

# Discover Yoru Dream U Shaped Sectional Sofa [2025 Guide]

U shaped sectional sofas are increasingly popular for creating cozy ‌and inviting living ⁤spaces. These expansive sofas offer ample seating for large families,frequent entertainers,or anyone who simply enjoys lounging in comfort. choosing the right U shaped sectional can transform ⁣your living room into a hub for‌ relaxation ⁣and socializing. This 2025 guide will explore the key features, benefits, and considerations when selecting the perfect U ⁤shaped sectional sofa for⁤ your home.

[[Explore Top Rated u shaped sectional on Amazon.]](https://itsallgarden.com/home-thinking/?kw=u shaped sectional)

## Key‍ Features Analysis

The ideal U shaped sectional should offer a⁣ blend of ⁢comfort, style, and durability. key features to consider include the overall dimensions, materials used, construction quality, and customization options.

**Dimensions and⁣ Configuration**

The size and configuration of a U shaped sectional are crucial for properly fitting your living space.⁢ Measure your room ‌carefully and consider the placement of doorways, windows, and other furniture. Sectionals typically range from 100 to ‌over⁤ 140 inches in width, with depth varying depending on the arm style and ‌seating arrangement. Look⁤ for modular options that allow you to rearrange the components to suit your needs and‍ adapt to different ⁤room layouts. Consider the chaise lounge positions as well; some sectionals offer ⁤reversible ‌or interchangeable chaise options.

**Upholstery Material**

The upholstery material impacts both the look and feel of your sectional,as ‍well ⁣as its durability and ease of ⁢maintenance. Popular choices include microfiber, linen, velvet,​ and leather.Microfiber is known for its stain resistance and affordability, making it a‍ good option for families with children or pets. Linen offers a natural, breathable feel but may be more prone to wrinkling. Velvet adds a touch of luxury and ‍sophistication,‍ while leather provides durability and a classic aesthetic, provided it is maintained well. Consider the fabric's rub count (a ​measure of abrasion resistance) to ensure it can withstand⁣ everyday wear and ⁤tear.

**Frame and Suspension**

The frame and suspension system are the foundation of any sectional sofa,determining its long-term stability and⁣ comfort. look for frames ⁢constructed‍ from‌ kiln-dried hardwood, which is less likely​ to warp or crack over time. The suspension system, typically consisting of springs or webbing, provides​ support and cushioning. Sinuous‌ springs (also known as no-sag springs) are a common and reliable choice, offering ⁣consistent support across the seating area. Eight-way​ hand-tied⁢ springs‍ are considered a premium option,providing‌ superior comfort and ⁣durability,but they also come with a higher price ⁤tag.

**Cushion Fill**

The cushion fill considerably impacts the ‌comfort level of your U shaped sectional. Common options include foam, feathers, ​fiber, and combinations ​of these materials. High-density foam provides firm support​ and retains its shape well, while feather-filled cushions⁢ offer a plush and luxurious feel. Fiber-filled cushions⁢ are a more affordable option to feathers but may require more frequent fluffing. Many sectional sofas use a ​combination of foam and ⁣fiber,⁢ such as a foam ​core wrapped⁢ in a layer of fiber or feathers,⁣ to achieve a balance of support and comfort.

Key features ⁢of a quality U-shaped sectional include:

*   Durable frame construction
*‍   Comfortable and supportive cushions
*   ⁤High-quality upholstery material

**Wush Wush** - the three most common varietals I noticed roasters brewing were bourbons, geshas, and for some reason, wush wush. Anyone know why? Is it becoming more available to roasters now or is it just that it's a good conversation starter? I had never tried it before, so I was pretty happy to be able to compare a few cups from different roasters and producers. Very intrigued by the commonalities between what I tried, though it'll take a couple more tries with a clean palette to articulate that properly.

**South American Importers** - they're out in force. I don't blame them, Europe is both an established and growing market for speciality coffee and Colombian beans especially seem to be doing very well here at the moment. At the same time the market I'm sure they expected to be courting this year is behaving temperamentally to put it mildly. They're taking it quite seriously though, south and central American green coffee suppliers were clearly the largest sponsors and on top of that seemed to have some interesting roasters with them to present their coffees. The majority of cupping events over the weekend by far are of their coffees also.

**Matcha Everywhere** - I know this isn't about coffee but that's almost what was so strange? There were a large number of whitewashed matcha 'lifestyle' type brands that clearly did not fit with the messaging of the roasters and producers there. On the coffee front, roasters were really excited to talk about their producers, they championed the origin and history of their products and were clearly proud of some of the really cool people who's produce they had gotten to work with. The ""tea products"" were not the tea version of this, they were tik tok brands of indeterminate origin. It made it clear the organisers weren't really part of the same ecosystem as the coffee industry people.

If you just focus on the coffee though, it was a great showing. We have some fantastic roasters here and there's some equally fantastic producers very eager to work with them. Some of my favourites I tasted were a Panama Gesha from Imbibe, a Carbonic Mascerated Castillo from Ariosa, and Established Coffee definitely won the battle of the Wush Wush, I had to get some of that to take home so I could continue to try and make sense of it as a variety. 

What are these things like elsewhere? Is an odd combination of products and services targeted indiscriminately at café owners normal or if I went to a different coffee festival could I expect something more focused? ",3,1744481031.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

The vibes at my ""local""-ish (best stock was about 40 mins from me) store were immaculate.

The store employees kept coming out to chat, and did a music trivia competition (with free posters/shirts prizes for everyone!). Once doors opened, everything was so organized, and people were incredibly respectful as the line went around the tables. I got the single copy of Sam Fender they had, and one of the two Fleetwood Mac's (gone on my first pass, but put back when I checked later!). They also had doughnuts and coffee for us inside ^_^

The only one I couldn't get was the Killers/Bruce record, but when I was in line waiting to check out, I started chatting with one of the folks I'd met earlier about our hauls, and when I mentioned I hadn't snagged it, they pulled it out of their pile and gave it to me 🥹

**Diary of Saint Faustina - paragraph 1513 - Contained in the Cross** 

**1513 Jesus said to me today, You often call Me your Master. This is pleasing to My Heart; but do not forget, My disciple, that you are a disciple of a crucified Master. Let that one word be enough for you. You know what is contained in the cross.**

Christ's message to Saint Faustina in this Diary entry is a wake-up call for any who might think Christ's calling is a call to glory as we understand it. Christ's glory was a suffering glory of humiliation, torture and slow death on the Cross for the salvational triumph over the sins of men, sins which were never Christ's to suffer for in the first place. This is the first and truest glory of the suffering servant, Who humbly glories in the giving of His glory to others. Our glory will always be lesser because we are the undeserving receivers of glory rather than the source and giver of glory for another.

**Supportive Scripture - Douay Rheims Challoner Bible** 

**John 13:16 Amen, amen, I say to you: The servant is not greater than his lord: neither is the apostle greater than he that sent him.**

If our quest for Christ's glory is humble and true though, it will lead us above and beyond just the pleasant reception of Christ's salvific glory. It will lead us into some uncomfortable participation in the glory we don't often think of, the suffering glory for others exemplified by our “Crucified Master.” We won't be crucified or become a sacrifice for others against the fires of hell but we can still participate somewhat in what we know “is contained in the cross.”

**Supportive Scripture - Douay Rheims Challoner Bible**

**Matthew 10:38 And he that taketh not up his cross, and followeth me, is not worthy of me.**

The common interpretation of that verse is to expect and accept persecution in this world for being a follower of Christ. That interpretation was bore out brutally in the first centuries after the Crucifixion and the cruel persecution of Christians still goes on in many parts of the world even today. Christianity is now global though, being common or predominant in much of the world. Persecution of Christians has reduced or largely disappeared in most of the world but the message of taking up the Cross to follow Christ still carries a pertinent interpretation today. 

By Christ's grace, and the suffering of those who died for the spread of Christianity, the Cross we take up today is probably not a cross of persecution. It's still a Cross though and we know that “what is contained in the Cross” is salvational suffering for others. We aren't supposed to just absorb the salvation given us by Christ and spend the rest of our lives in Church, prayer breakfasts and Starbucks Bible study sessions. The salvation “contained in the Cross” is to be magnified outward from we who receive it to those who still need it. We cannot accomplish this at Christ's Godly level but as children of God living in this fallen world, we can practice some type of worldly sacrificial suffering for others at our crude, human level. 

This is why Christ preaches charity over outward piety, like maybe skipping the Starbucks Bible study to use all that overpriced coffee money for Subway gift cards for homeless folk at the dirty side of town. Something like that would be very watered down from what's contained in Christ's Cross but it can grow from there. We would be sacrificing small worldly treasures of wealth, time and comfort zones to uplift a person from worldly poverty, as Christ sacrificed all of Himself for the more powerful uplifting of all men from spiritual poverty into eternal life. What's “contained in the Cross” we carry is trivial compared to the Cross of Christ but through Christ, our small cross can gain great power. If we join our trivial works to Christ by doing them in His name, and for His glory, then what's “contained in the Cross” we carry will be magnified with the spiritually powerful Divine Virtues of God flowing into this fallen veil of tears through us. And through us will his Kingdom come and His will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.

**Supportive Scripture - Douay Rheims Challoner Bible**

**First Corinthians 1:18 For the word of the cross, to them indeed that perish, is foolishness: but to them that are saved, that is, to us, it is the power of God.**

Buttery, fluffy, and melt-in-your-mouth delicious — these Peach Butter Swim Biscuits bake in a pool of golden butter and are topped with sweet, juicy peach goodness. Perfect for breakfast, brunch, or a cozy afternoon treat! 😍☕️

**Ingredients:**

*For the Biscuits:*

* 2 cups self-rising flour 🌾
* 1 tbsp granulated sugar 🍬
* 1 1/2 cups buttermilk 🥛
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted 🧈

*For the Peach Butter Topping:*

* 1 cup diced peaches (fresh, canned, or frozen & thawed) 🍑
* 2 tbsp brown sugar 🍯
* 2 tbsp butter 🧈
* 1/2 tsp cinnamon (optional for warmth) 🌰

**Instructions:**

1. **Preheat oven** to 450°F (232°C). Pour melted butter into an 8x8-inch baking dish and tilt to coat the bottom.
2. **Mix the biscuit dough:** In a bowl, stir together the self-rising flour, sugar, and buttermilk until just combined (don’t overmix!). It’ll be a sticky dough.
3. **Add dough to the dish:** Spoon the dough into the buttered pan and gently spread it out. The butter will rise up the sides — that’s the “swim”! 😄
4. **Score the biscuits:** Use a knife to lightly cut the dough into 9 squares. This helps them bake evenly and pull apart easily.
5. **Prepare the peach topping:** In a small saucepan, heat the peaches, brown sugar, butter, and cinnamon over medium heat for 5–7 minutes until warm and syrupy.
6. **Bake the biscuits:** Place the pan in the oven and bake for 20–25 minutes, or until the tops are golden brown and fluffy.
7. **Top with peaches:** Once out of the oven, spoon the warm peach butter mixture over the biscuits while they’re still hot. Let it soak in for a few minutes before serving.

These **Peach Butter Swim Biscuits** are pure Southern-style comfort — warm, gooey, and bursting with peachy goodness. Serve them warm with a cup of coffee or a scoop of vanilla ice cream for dessert! 🍑☁️🧈

**Diary of Saint Faustina - paragraph 1513 - Contained in the Cross** 

**1513 Jesus said to me today, You often call Me your Master. This is pleasing to My Heart; but do not forget, My disciple, that you are a disciple of a crucified Master. Let that one word be enough for you. You know what is contained in the cross.**

Christ's message to Saint Faustina in this Diary entry is a wake-up call for any who might think Christ's calling is a call to glory as we understand it. Christ's glory was a suffering glory of humiliation, torture and slow death on the Cross for the salvational triumph over the sins of men, sins which were never Christ's to suffer for in the first place. This is the first and truest glory of the suffering servant, Who humbly glories in the giving of His glory to others. Our glory will always be lesser because we are the undeserving receivers of glory rather than the source and giver of glory for another.

**Supportive Scripture - Douay Rheims Challoner Bible** 

**John 13:16 Amen, amen, I say to you: The servant is not greater than his lord: neither is the apostle greater than he that sent him.**

If our quest for Christ's glory is humble and true though, it will lead us above and beyond just the pleasant reception of Christ's salvific glory. It will lead us into some uncomfortable participation in the glory we don't often think of, the suffering glory for others exemplified by our “Crucified Master.” We won't be crucified or become a sacrifice for others against the fires of hell but we can still participate somewhat in what we know “is contained in the cross.”

**Supportive Scripture - Douay Rheims Challoner Bible**

**Matthew 10:38 And he that taketh not up his cross, and followeth me, is not worthy of me.**

The common interpretation of that verse is to expect and accept persecution in this world for being a follower of Christ. That interpretation was bore out brutally in the first centuries after the Crucifixion and the cruel persecution of Christians still goes on in many parts of the world even today. Christianity is now global though, being common or predominant in much of the world. Persecution of Christians has reduced or largely disappeared in most of the world but the message of taking up the Cross to follow Christ still carries a pertinent interpretation today. 

By Christ's grace, and the suffering of those who died for the spread of Christianity, the Cross we take up today is probably not a cross of persecution. It's still a Cross though and we know that “what is contained in the Cross” is salvational suffering for others. We aren't supposed to just absorb the salvation given us by Christ and spend the rest of our lives in Church, prayer breakfasts and Starbucks Bible study sessions. The salvation “contained in the Cross” is to be magnified outward from we who receive it to those who still need it. We cannot accomplish this at Christ's Godly level but as children of God living in this fallen world, we can practice some type of worldly sacrificial suffering for others at our crude, human level. 

This is why Christ preaches charity over outward piety, like maybe skipping the Starbucks Bible study to use all that overpriced coffee money for Subway gift cards for homeless folk at the dirty side of town. Something like that would be very watered down from what's contained in Christ's Cross but it can grow from there. We would be sacrificing small worldly treasures of wealth, time and comfort zones to uplift a person from worldly poverty, as Christ sacrificed all of Himself for the more powerful uplifting of all men from spiritual poverty into eternal life. What's “contained in the Cross” we carry is trivial compared to the Cross of Christ but through Christ, our small cross can gain great power. If we join our trivial works to Christ by doing them in His name, and for His glory, then what's “contained in the Cross” we carry will be magnified with the spiritually powerful Divine Virtues of God flowing into this fallen veil of tears through us. And through us will his Kingdom come and His will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.

Unfortunately, I am not a coffee person so forgive me for asking trivial questions- but here it goes. 

My parents have recently started developing a love for coffee and they have started to replace their morning cup of tea with a Nescafe coffee. I basically want to gift them a machine which would let them have better coffee. I see Nespresso only have 2 machines in India and Lattissima one is slightly out of my budge zone, but it’s a still an option. I wanted your help in deciding which machine should I buy? 

Requirements:
1) They drink their coffee with milk, so ideally a machine which can make cappuccino. 
2) If that is not an option, atleast a milk frother or a pressure pipe(do we call it something else?) 
3) Pods would be easier for them to use but if that is not an option, maybe a machine which works well with grounded beans.

1jxn30r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jxn30r,Czech Republic Lunch Menu 6 - Freeze Dried,"This is the only freeze dried main meal they currently offer, and it's not clear to me why as this was a great meal!

As you can see in Pic 1, the main is very hearty and a generous portion. 

I am always super careful when rehydrating freeze dried meals to ensure proper mixing and full rehydration. I used the exact volume of water stated. I also added crushed red pepper and some salt just after adding the water because it was a bit bland. Those additions really helped it out!

Pic 2 shows the contents; everything stated was accounted for and in perfect shape.

Pic 3 shows everything all laid out. One important note here is the crisp bread ""issue."" 

There are 2 packs of crispbread but nothing to put on them, no jam, no honey, nothing.  That is very odd. I LOVE crisp bread but they did not work well with this pasta at all. Simply turned too mushy.

Pic 4 shows the banana Chips and the yogurt covered dessert crisps. The banana chips are NOT like normal everyday banana chips. They are much thinner and broken up a bit due to that.  They also have less sweetness than most banana Chips I've had most likely because they are not sugar blasted, which is fine by me.

Here's where the pro tip comes in, put the banana Chips on the crisp bread (see Pic 5 for crisp bread)! They actually paired very well together. I should have busted out a Spanish honey packet to drizzle on but didn't think of it because that would have further elevated this for sure. 

That being said, there is simply too much crisp bread and not enough banana Chips, so you're gonna have to find something else to do with the rest of the crisp breads, that's where the pea soup in Pic 6 comes in. Start dipping! The soup was great! Very hearty soup and better than most in rations, especially that yucky leek French soup (I hate that stuff).

Those yogurt covered crisps are fantastic, one of my fav ration items. I like the chocolate covered ones even more!

Coffee was great too! My kiddo really liked the isotonic beverage base from this one! Tea is just standard earl Grey.

Overall, a great meal and ration. A small tub of jam or honey  would have made it even better.  I recommend this meal for sure!

Whether you're cruising with family, your favorite person, or flying solo, there’s just something special about being out at sea with a little Disney magic sprinkled into the experience. 🛳️🌊

# 🏖️ The Vibe: Relaxing + Fun (and yes, a little magical)

From the moment you step onboard, everything is warm, welcoming, and smooth. The ship feels like a floating resort — spotless, thoughtfully designed, and full of surprises. There’s something going on at all times, but never in an overwhelming way. You can do *everything*, or absolutely nothing, and still have the best time.

# 👒 Grown-Up Time is a Thing, and It’s Glorious

One of the best things? There are entire areas just for adults. Think:

* Peaceful sun decks with loungers and a bar
* Elegant dining at **Palo** or **Remy**
* Cozy cafes and lounges for wine, coffee, or just quiet time

There’s plenty of space to unwind, sip something delicious, and watch the sunset without a care in the world.

# 🍽️ Dining That’s Creative and Delicious

The food onboard is such a highlight! Rotational dining means you experience different themed restaurants, but your servers stay with you — and they really get to know your style. There are also quick bites, soft serve on tap, late-night room service (free, btw), and beautiful sit-down meals that feel like a full experience.

# 🌴 Castaway Cay is Straight-Up Paradise

Disney’s private island in the Bahamas is a full-on dream. Soft sand, crystal-clear water, beach BBQ, bike rentals, cabanas… even an adults-only beach called *Serenity Bay* that’s peaceful and quiet. You could honestly spend the whole trip there and be happy.

# 🎭 Entertainment + Extras

The live shows are Broadway-quality, the movie theater is playing the latest Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and Star Wars films, and there are themed deck parties that bring everyone together in the best way. Pirate Night is a blast, fireworks at sea are unforgettable, and characters are around for pics if you’re feeling the Disney spirit.

# 💡 Quick Tips to Know Before You Go:

* **Book early** – Disney cruises are popular and prices rise fast
* **Bring fun outfits** for themed nights (pirate night is a thing!)
* **Download the Navigator app** to keep up with everything onboard
* **You can bring a little wine or champagne** with you – bonus!

# Final Thoughts 🌟

A Disney Cruise is the kind of trip that lets you fully unplug, have fun, and feel taken care of. It’s not just about characters — it’s about comfort, creativity, and connection. Whether you're swimming, exploring, watching a show, or just having ice cream under the sun, it all feels *special*.

And if you're thinking of going soon — select sailings from Florida are **25% off right now**, which makes it a great time to jump in. 🛳️✨

1jxn26p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jxn26p,My cat kept chewing off the steam wands rubber boot on my delonghi ecp3630,"I was perfectly happy with this cheap machine. But after my cat took a liking to the steam wand I finally looked into an upgrade. I did it while my apartment fire inspection was happening, and I don’t think the inspector was enthused hahaha. 

I’m far from experienced with espresso so I don’t know if the frothing is better, and I still don’t know how to do art. I do know my cat is going to have a harder time wrecking this steam wand though. 

I must say it was a pain in the ass, and instead of forcing that plastic piece around the bend of the new wand- I drilled it out with a 1/4” bit which was the next size up if going in 64th inch increments. Made it easier but it’s definitely not tight on there anymore. I didn’t have any one ear clamps to replace the one I took off- so I used a zip tie- but made sure to get the tube over the hump on the top of the steam wand. Obviously this wand is not meant for this machine and it’s kind of a hokey setup but oh well. 

I’ll have to wait for my fiancé to get home from a trip to hear her opinion on if it’s an improvement or not. She’s the one with coffee shop experience. We are planning on getting a machine in the $2-5k range once we’re married- and our fixer upper is livable.

I have one question that i hope you can gave me answer to. Last wednesday i started talking with one girl that i have some of my classes in this grade (i am currently 3rd grade in high school). That first conversation was really nice, it was about school and subjects... Then the next day i met with my friends and she was there (my friends are also her friends). As we were walking from school to cafe she started walking by my side and she started to have conversation with me. She was getting really close to me, so much that we were colliding with our hips multiple times. Then in cafe after like 2 mins of sitting there she came to our table, talked little bit and then returned to her table. After that i went to her table multiple times, and we were talking, laughing, telling stories... Then the next day (last friday) we met before school (i was with my friends and she was with her friends) and we talked to school. Throughout that day, we had multiple conversations, she was asking me to help her with some subject (with which she didn't need help), she would literarily spawn by my side, multiple times, while i was standing with my friends, then she even invited me on coffee, but because of my classes i couldn't go. Then next day i asked her out via messages and she said that she is already going out with her friend, but that i can go with them, that i cannot possibly bother them, so we agreed to meet; but because of bad weather and other school duties, we didn't went out in the end. Then this week, she began to act less interested and more distant. Sure we talk to each other, tease each other, but we are more distant. On monday i was trying hard to have conversation, but after monday i also became little bit distant to see her reaction and she seemed to be less distant after that, but it not anywhere near last week. Later this week, as i was little bit more distant she started to show more interest (bought me water because i asked if someone has water in class, she initiated conversations, teased me...). Then on thursday i asked her if she is free to go out this weekend and she said yes and that we should go out (she also sent request to follow me on my private inst acc). And then today around 11am when i sent her message if she wants to go out tomorrow, she still ""didn't"" saw it. So what does this all mean? What should i do? Was this too early to ask her out?

Hiplose Wood, the former Confederacy of Daru'uie

Nevali Region, Aldrida, Alagore

 

\*\*\*\*\*

 

Benjamin Ford scowled as icy rain trickled beneath his Itlian battle suit, chilling his skin. The suit gave infantrymen an edge, but stopping water wasn’t part of the deal.

He squinted through the drizzle, catching the Sergeant First Class and Warrant Officer crouched above the ridgeline, their silhouettes sharp against the misty valley below. While the Rangers and 4th ID fought further south, the Minutemen had orders to ambush a supply column. The battle was a delay tactic, but the brass hoped disrupting enemy supply lines would buy a day or two. For now, the two teams awaited their sister Minutemen recon team, Phantom-2.

As the acting leaders hashed out Comanche’s next move, Ford hunkered down with the others. The team triple-checked their gear, steeling themselves for the fight, except for Fraeya, who perched on a rock, one hand shielding her clothes from mud while the other subtly bent the rainwater away.

“You might want to embrace the dirt,” Forest said, his voice dry. “Out here, you’ll get filthy. Smelly. Sweaty. Pretty fades fast in this line of work.”

“I’m coming to terms with it,” Fraeya said, her tone clipped.

Ar’lya chuckled, shaking her head. “What, are you a wood elf? Shouldn’t you love nature?”

“That’s a stereotype,” Fraeya snapped, her cheeks flushing faintly. “I’m a wood elf, not some beast who revels in mud.”

“Pretending to be noble won’t help out here,” Ar’lya teased. “Act like a wood elf.”

Seeing Fraeya mutter under her breath, Ford cut in, “Ar’lya, you saying only noble elves have a kingdom?”

“Not quite,” Ar’lya said, her grin fading slightly.

“Nobles have the strongest kingdom,” Fraeya clarified, straightening. “But wood and moon elves have their own.”

“I just poke at the nobles ‘cause they act above us,” Ar’lya said with a playful shrug. “It’s jest.”

Ford glanced at the Farian woman lounging under a tree, her ease speaking of hard-earned experience. He nodded, recalling Basic training’s mantra: perform anywhere to win.

Ar’lya’s comfort in the wild showed her roots. “You’ve been out here a while, haven’t you?” Ford asked.

“You could say that,” Ar’lya said, her voice tinged with a bitter edge. “I’ve been in Nevali three, maybe four years.”

“Explains why you know these lands so well,” Barrios said, wiping rain from his visor.

“I had to,” Ar’lya replied. “Guiding pays best, so I learned the landscape.”

“Then why stay at Salva?” Ford asked. “You came with us for work, but you never mentioned cities.”

“I hate cities,” Ar’lya said, a faint smirk flickering. “I had a hut, my treasures—my whole life. Outlaws took it all. I was tracking them when I found you. Thought it’d be a fresh start… then I learned it’s food, not coin.”

“No complaining,” Forest said, his tone firm.

“I’m not complaining,” Ar’lya shot back. “If I wanted out, I’d be gone. Though coins trade better than food.”

Ford’s stomach growled at the mention of food. Retaking Salva meant feeding a city of allies, but the Aristocracy’s blockade and Bridge travel cut off supplies. Logistics couldn’t lean on the land anymore, forcing a one-meal-a-day policy.

It didn’t faze Ford—he was used to lean times—but he felt for Ar’lya. Her light tan skin and warm brown fur marked her as Farian, and for someone carving out an honest living, the scarcity would bite.

“I’m no economist,” Ford said, “but until we get an exchange rate, our money’s worthless here.”

“What?” Ar’lya exclaimed, her ears twitching. “Your people don’t have coin?”

“We do,” Ford said, pausing. “Legally, I think. But now that I think about it, I haven’t seen physical money stateside in ages—only foreign currency.”

“Yeah,” Forest added, scratching his jaw. “I pay for everything with my phone. Physical money feels weird now.”

Ar’lya opened her mouth, but Fraeya raised a hand. “Don’t ask. It’ll just confuse you.” Despite their advanced tech, the Digital Revolution hadn’t touched these people.

As the team chuckled at Fraeya’s resistance to the muck, Ford froze, catching a sharp crack from the forest. Three bushes quivered, their leaves slashing through the rain-soaked mud, closing on their position.

The Sergeant wheeled toward the tree line, spotting two pairs of footsteps in the slop. Rain halted midair, tracing a human outline.

“Invisible mages!” Fraeya cried, her voice tight.

As Fraeya’s glove glowed with mana, Ford grabbed her arm, halting her spell. “Hold fire. They’re ours.”

The cloaks flickered off, revealing two figures draped in ghillie suits—less armor, more like fern-woven blankets. Sensors in the netting projected rear images forward, weaving the illusion of invisibility. Their specialized Itlian Battlesuits prioritized stealth, with extra battery power for the energy-hungry cloaks.

Ford’s HUD pinged their IFF as the cloaks deactivated. Sergeant Terry, clutching an M88 sniper rifle, and Sergeant Maui, toting an M31 and a dual-fan drone, stepped forward—Phantom-2, the Minutemen recon team.

Skull stickers adorned their chest plates—some plain, others sporting hats, from crowns to berets. A tally of kills, Ford guessed, with hats marking high-value targets. Phantom-2 had been busy.

The stir drew the team’s eyes. Fraeya’s puzzled look prompted Ford to nod at the near-invisible pair. Up close, the cloaking showed flaws—warped reflections, uneven edges—but it wasn’t built for close range. It shone for recon behind enemy lines.

“Phantom,” Barrett said, his voice low. “What kept you?”

“They’ve got a seeker on point,” Terry replied, wiping mud from his scope. “Those things are a pain to dodge.”

“Also, heads-up,” Maui added, his drone humming faintly. “The beast humanoids smell better than we’d like.”

“Got it,” Barrett said. “They incoming?”

“Our Smalldog spotted the convoy,” Maui said. “Toriffa rear supply. They’ll hit the kill zone any minute.”

Rommel King materialized beside the Sergeant First Class. “Keep the Smalldog put. You two, take that ridge and snipe high-value targets.”

As Phantom-2 scrambled up the rain-slick rockface, King faced Comanche. “Form up, everyone. Fraeya, when they enter the kill zone, start a landslide.”

“Sir King,” Fraeya said, her voice wavering, “I’m not strong enough for a landslide. It’s more rock than dirt.”

“Fine,” King said. “Topple those boulders over there. I don’t need the road blocked—just enough to slow them.”

“I can do that,” Fraeya said, her jaw set.

Comanche fanned out along the ridgeline, boots sinking into the mire. Ford dashed to the Hound, snagging the EDM4A1 electric rifle for anti-drone work from the vehicle’s rear. He hefted the bulky weapon and rejoined his team, dropping to a knee behind Barrett, who pointed him to his spot.

The Sergeant hunkered behind a dripping bush, peering at the broken road below. His IFF tagged Ghost across the way, nestled in the forest’s gloom, primed for a crossfire.

Soon, the enemy trudged into view—a platoon-sized force slogging along the road, mostly J’avais in light blue and silver armor, Toriffa’s colors, led by a Neko guide. Dwarves manned three wagonettes—supply carts—while a small walker, its accelerator glinting, stomped between them.

Over TEAMCOM, Barrios marked the Seeker drone hovering above. A red box locked onto Ford’s HUD, tracking the device as it scanned the ridgeline. When it swiveled toward Comanche, Ford pressed himself into the mud, heart pounding.

The drone lingered, as if staring. Then the infantry below unleashed a barrage at the ridgeline. A Toriffa commander leapt from a vehicle to rally his troops but dropped, a sniper’s round from Phantom-2 punching through his helm.

“We’ve been made,” Wallace growled.

“What gave it away?” Barrios quipped, his voice tight.

“Comanche,” King barked. “Light them up!”

From their elevated perch, Comanche unleashed a storm of M31 rounds, shattering the enemy’s formation as they scrambled for cover. Bolts seared the rocky cliff, spitting sparks. Comanche pinned the front ranks, and an unguided rocket obliterated the lead wagonette, trapping the foe in a choke point.

Ford leveled the electric rifle at the Seeker. A pulse scorched its side, and the drone spiraled into the mud with a crack. Kill confirmed, he slung the rifle, grabbed his M31, and snapped a grenade capsule into the underslung launcher. The frag round arced, detonating beside a wagonette in a spray of shrapnel, dropping two J’avais behind it.

Spotting a J’avais commander, Ford squeezed off a burst. The armor stopped the first shot, but the second punched through, felling the hostile. As he scanned for another target, the enemy platoon surged forward, the walker’s cannon swiveling toward the ridgeline.

Before it could fire, a blast rocked the walker’s flank, spraying debris. Ghost struck from the left, catching the enemy off-guard. With their focus split, Ghost poured fire into their rear.

Enemy bolts crumbled Ford’s rock cover, forcing him to slide beside Charles Higgins. The Airman ducked as energy rounds scorched the air, leaving a burnt-metal tang.

“Three right below us,” Higgins hissed.

They yanked fragmentation grenades from their suits and lobbed them onto the road. Twin blasts echoed, mud and screams mingling. Peering over, they snapped their M31s to their shoulders. The grenades had shredded three J’avais, their enchanted armor pierced by shrapnel. One crawled away, blood slicking the road, as the rest scattered. Comanche held the high ground, picking off stragglers with precise bursts.

The walker lumbered left, its accelerator ballista targeting Ghost. It loosed a shot, the projectile shredding trees and toppling one near Ghost’s position, forcing Minutemen to dive from cover.

Ford launched a grenade at the accelerator, catching an operator in the blast but leaving the weapon intact. The surviving Toriffa soldiers swung the ballista toward Comanche, its shot blasting the ridgeline, showering dirt and stone.

“They’re panicking,” Forest said, his voice steady. “Operators are reacting, not thinking. Wallace, take that dwarf. You two, hit the walker.”

Ford spotted the dwarf in blue and black armor, barking orders at the walker’s crew, who fired wildly. If he rallied them, it’d spell trouble.

Wallace shifted, leveling his M252. A shieldman blocked his first shots, but the sheer volume overwhelmed, rounds finding gaps to cut the shieldman down. Wallace adjusted, a burst dropping the dwarf in a heap.

Meanwhile, Ford and Higgins poured M31 rounds into the accelerator. Its operators swung a leg up as a shield, freezing in place. Barrios capitalized, unleashing a recoilless rifle shot that tore the walker apart in a fiery blast.

The remaining enemies broke, fleeing into the forest’s shadows, abandoning the convoy. Smoke and haze drifted over the road, the acrid stench of charred metal and blood thick in the air. Silence fell, broken only by the groans of the wounded, mud squelching under shifting boots.

Ford’s VISOR tracked Ghost sweeping the ruined convoy. King’s voice crackled over the radio, ordering Comanche to hold, rifles trained on the sprawled corpses for traps.

When Ghost signaled the all-clear, King led Comanche down to secure the convoy. Ford trailed medic Marcos Gonzales down a sloped opening, their battle suits sliding safely through the muck to the road. The Twins and Forest peeled off to watch the enemy’s retreat path while the rest joined Ghost.

The stench of death—burnt flesh and ozone—clogged the air, smoke hazing Ford’s view. He kept his VISOR down to spot Ghost through the gloom.

Gonzales darted to a wounded J’avais, kneeling to work. Ford covered him, M31 trained on the enemy.

“Can you even help?” Ford asked, voice low. “They’re human, but same biology? They’re aliens.”

“Still human,” Gonzales said, pressing a bandage to a wound. “Everything’s where it should be. I’m just stopping the bleeding. Brass decides what’s next.”

“Still human,” Ford muttered, rain pattering his helmet. “Never thought space aliens would be our cousins from some lost past.”

Gonzales smirked, tying off the bandage. “No manga prepped you for this?”

“Not that I recall,” Ford said, a faint grin breaking through.

Fraeya approached, a cloth pressed to her nose against the foul air, her boots sinking slightly. “You okay? You can stay on the ridgeline if it’s too much.”

“I’ll manage,” Fraeya said, her eyes narrowing as she watched Gonzales. “Why’s Marcos helping our enemy?”

“Law says we have to,” Ford replied, shifting his grip on the M31.

“What law?” Fraeya asked, her voice sharp with confusion.

“Geneva Convention,” Gonzales said, not looking up. “Nations agree to rules, like treating wounded soldiers.”

“Rules of war,” Ford added, his breath fogging the VISOR’s edge.

“That’s… strange,” Fraeya said, her brow furrowing. “I’ve heard of warfare rules, but this? Just honor codes I don’t get. These J’avais wouldn’t do the same.”

“We’re picking up on that,” Gonzales said. “But until the President says otherwise, we patch them up.”

“Besides,” Ford said, his tone dry, “the Spooks will love him. Like when you were our prisoner, but less cozy.”

“Hard to imagine less cozy,” Fraeya muttered, her ears twitching.

With the prisoner secured, Ford turned to a battered wagonette. Three Minutemen rummaged inside, pulling supplies. Like others, it was skeletal, retrofitted from troop transport to cargo.

“Find anything good?” Ford called, wiping water from his gloves.

“Food,” Higgins said, tossing two bags, their contents rattling softly.

Ford caught them, passing one to Fraeya. Inside were purple and blue fruits, biscuits, salted meat, and crackers. “Nice. Maybe we’ll eat tonight.”

“Don’t bet on it,” King said, his voice cutting through the patter of rain.

“Why not?” Ford asked, frowning. “DARPA would kill to tear this wagonette apart.”

“And this food,” Higgins added, hefting a crate. “Can’t let it rot.”

“We’re satchling the vehicle,” King said. “Aristocracy Brigaton broke through east, so no recovery’s coming. Ghost will plant charges and haul prisoners to Indolass.”

As the teams gathered supplies and secured prisoners, a Minuteman on the ridge waved urgently, shouting about airships. Ford followed the Ghost member’s gesture, spotting Orgat airships slicing through the storm toward their position.

He braced, expecting warriors to drop on them, but the airships roared past, banking south, their engines a fading growl.

“Where’re they going?” Fraeya asked, her voice small against the wind.

Ford caught a Comanche Airman muttering into his radio, likely alerting command. Fraeya edged closer to the group. “Why’d they pass us? That bad?”

“South’s our main forces,” Ford said, rain streaking his VISOR. “Could be anything.”

“Probably a hit-and-run,” Barrett said, his tone clipped.

“Unless the Aristocracy got a tech leap,” Wallace said, “that’s the Unity.”

“Got it,” Higgins cut in, his voice urgent. “They’re hitting a town 4th ID’s holding. Listen, sir.”

Higgins opened DEFCOM, the radio crackling to life with desperate chatter.

“Mayday, this is Second Platoon. Two enemy aircraft ambushed us, and we’re surrounded. Under assault! Request immediate assistance!”

“What’s the plan?” Wallace asked, his rifle still raised.

“Hang on,” King said, turning to Ghost’s leader. “Captain, permission to—”

“Rommel,” Miller said, his voice calm but firm. “We’ll handle this. Go reinforce 4th ID.”

Salva, the former Confederacy of Daru'uie

Nevali Region, Aldrida, Alagore

 

\*\*\*\*\*

 

The high-pitched scream of 30mm rounds sliced the air, explosions shuddering through the glass window, its frame rattling faintly. Ryder flicked his eyes to the pane, the enemy’s persistence a dull ache in his mind. Harassment fire, nothing more. He grabbed his coffee, the mug’s heat biting his palm, and took a sip, willing his nerves to settle.

His unease wasn’t the artillery. The Comanche Captain was raw, the sting of being sidelined from his team—temporary or not—cutting deeper than his wounds. He understood why: capture by the Verliance Aristocracy, a brutal escape through the wild. But sitting out while his unit marched to the front twisted his gut.

The coffee’s acrid burn hit hard. Ryder set the mug on the wooden bedside table, its grain rough under his fingers, and muttered, “If that’s not rations, I don’t know what is.”

He turned to his tablet, grappling with a glitchy Latin app. Slapped together by Programmable Intelligence, it taught only Earth’s dead language, not Alagore’s. Limited, but he hoped it’d spark enough to build on—until an update brought native terms. Frustration gnawed, less at the app than his guilt. Barred from command, his team under Rommel King, Ryder felt adrift, his mind conjuring disasters at the front.

Assiaya passed by, her red-and-white Palace maid outfit crisp against the room’s chaos. She’d thrown herself into servant work since arriving—fetching drinks for officers and NCOs, tidying desks unasked. Ryder didn’t mind; it kept her safe in the city’s most secure building. She’d insisted on helping, and he couldn’t refuse if she stayed clear. Her quiet knack for timing—knowing when to step in or fade back, honed under Kallem’s yoke—made her eerily adept.

A wry twist curled Ryder’s lips. Secret royalty playing servant—fate’s cruel joke. Assiaya’s presence softened the operations room’s edge, her small frame weaving through desks, lightening the Minutemen’s mood. But it couldn’t touch Ryder’s. Her confession—she was King Balan’s daughter, former ruler of the Daru’uie Confederacy—explained the Vampire Lord’s mercy and the Head Maid’s leniency, yet sparked more questions.

Her lineage could legitimize the U.S. Army here. On Earth, foreign troops rarely won trust. On Alagore, strangers faced colder suspicion. Natilite called it a blessing: new arrivals with no baggage, unlike native empires, they could use Assiaya’s blood to loosen Kallem’s hold—if it worked.

Watching her hand out water bottles, her small frame dwarfed by the room’s bustle, Ryder’s resolve hardened. At twelve, she’d be a pawn in a brutal game, and he’d be damned if he let that happen. Her wish to aid Salva’s civilians at the dwarf borrian was noble but would drag her into politics—a figurehead for the rebellion and U.S. aims. He loathed exploiting her, yet Natilite was right: it was their best play. The thought of the military preying on her youth and inexperience turned his stomach. He’d adopted her to shield her, no matter the cost.

Hiding it from Hackett hurt worst. Ryder had never kept secrets from his mentor, who’d anchored him through despair. Telling him now would force a report up the chain, unleashing the exploitation he feared. His only plan was to lock in the adoption first, damn the cost—career, friendship, everything. Watching Assiaya weave through the desks, he felt cornered, no third path in sight. Betraying Hackett, who’d shaped him for Special Forces, was a blade in his chest, but he’d sworn on God and his late wife’s name to protect her.

Ryder leaned back, the chair creaking under his weight, the faint hum of radios and tapping keys filling the air. Captain Smith’s boots scuffed the stone floor as she approached. Instinct clenched his gut, but training locked it down. “What can I do for you, Captain?” he asked, voice steady.

“Colonel Hackett wants you,” Smith said.

A cold knot tightened in Ryder’s stomach. No meeting was planned. Had Hackett caught wind of his adoption plan, Assiaya’s royal ties? “I’ll be right there,” he said, keeping his tone even.

“He’s in his office,” Smith said, then turned away.

No escort. Maybe he was overthinking. As CFT-1’s head and Hackett’s friend, private talks were common. Memories of the Colonel’s old office—photos lining the walls before the Bridge—only soured his mood. Hiding this from Hackett felt like betrayal, but Assiaya came first.

Ryder stood, threading through the lobby’s maze of desks, the air thick with coffee and sweat. Assiaya caught his glance, and he signaled he’d return, urging her to stay inside, away from windows where snipers might lurk.

Hackett’s office lay in the dwarven labyrinth, tunnels shielding command from artillery. Unlike America’s skyward cities, this one burrowed deep, markets and homes carved into stone. Ryder stepped into the makeshift office, the air cool and damp against his skin. Hackett sat at a red oak desk, eyes fixed on a computer, its battery humming faintly on the stone floor. Steel plates gleamed dully against the walls, the windowless room a vault of silence.

“Sir,” Ryder said, snapping to attention.

“At ease,” Hackett said. “Social visit.”

Ryder eased, watching his mentor, waiting.

Hackett tapped his screen a moment, then stood, circling to lean against the desk, arms crossed. “How you feeling, Matt? Chest okay?”

“Doing good,” Ryder said, the sting of his wounds a faint prickle under his shirt. “Doc says it’ll fade soon.”

“Worried about that. After what you took, you’re lucky. Potions helped, but they’re no free ride.”

“No manual, and I was desperate,” Ryder said, a flicker of a shrug.

“No one’s blaming you,” Hackett said, voice softening.

Ryder flipped a folding chair, leaning on its back, arms crossed. “Tell that to the Templar. Thought she’d gut me when she found out.”

Hackett chuckled, grabbing a water bottle, its plastic crinkling. “Bet so. Twenty years married, I learned not to cross my wife unjustly. An augmented super-soldier? Hell no.”

“Got that vibe. But Natilite’s solid, committed. She’ll be a hell of an asset.”

“Good. Fraeya? How’s she holding?”

“Struggling, as expected,” Ryder said, rubbing his jaw, the stubble rough. “Untrained, but spirited. Her magic’s a game-changer—I’m still figuring it out. She’ll mesh with time. Worth it.”

“Surprised she’s lasted,” Hackett said. “Not soldier material, but she’s earned her keep. If she doesn’t drag, you’ve got my backing.”

“Thank you, sir.”

“Think we should roll this out to all Minutemen teams?”

Ryder glanced at the floor, the stone cold under his boots. Natilite and Fraeya joined from necessity, their skills now vital. “Yeah,” he said. “More formal going forward, but their abilities give us an edge.”

“I’m leaning that way,” Hackett said. “Drafting a report for General Sherman—full rundown, problems, solutions.”

“I’d back it,” Ryder said. “Their differences are a win against Unity.”

“Agreed. Combining their strengths with ours could clinch it. Transparency’s key, though—you with me?”

The question snagged Ryder, but he nodded. “Yes, sir.”

Hackett took a swig, eyeing the bottle. “Saw that girl handing these out. Sweet of her.”

Ryder’s lips twitched. “She’s got a servant’s heart. Only normalcy she knows. Told her she can do small tasks if she stays clear.”

“Fine by me,” Hackett said. “Helps the men adjust.”

The casual tone pricked Ryder’s nerves. Most commanders wouldn’t tolerate a kid in a command post. “What’re your plans for her?” Hackett asked, voice shifting. “She’s glued to you. Cute, if the reason wasn’t so grim.”

“Being hunted like dogs’ll do that,” Ryder said, jaw tight. “I promised to protect her.”

Hackett uncapped his bottle, pausing mid-sip. “That why you’re pulling this stunt?”

Fear coiled in Ryder’s chest, his eyes locking with Hackett’s—steady, unflinching, a quiet challenge. His mentor knew. How, he couldn’t fathom. A lie flickered in his mind, but those piercing eyes pinned him. “I’m adopting her,” he said, voice barely above a whisper, throat tight.

“Matt,” Hackett said, shaking his head, “that’s no secret. Everyone saw that coming. That’s not what I mean, and you damn well know it.”

Ryder took a breath, bracing for impact. “This morning, Assiaya told me and Natilite she’s King Balan’s daughter—former ruler of the Daru’uie Confederacy, these lands.”

“And you weren’t gonna tell me?” Hackett’s voice was steel.

“I was,” Ryder said, meeting his gaze, hands tightening briefly on the chair. “After the adoption.”

“You haven’t thought this through, have you? Adopting an alien girl? No protocol exists. That’d draw eyes—opposite of what you want.”

Ryder’s shoulders sagged. “Guess so. How’d you know? Natilite?”

“Talked to her, but she didn’t spill,” Hackett said. “Wood Elf, Folen Elstina, came two days ago, offered his arms workshop. Mentioned Assiaya’s claim, asked if we’d back it.”

Realization slammed Ryder. That’s why Hackett benched him, pushed him toward Assiaya. “I see,” he said, then straightened. “I’m sorry, sir. Meant no harm, but I don’t regret it.”

“Wouldn’t respect you if you did,” Hackett said. “Knew you’d pull this after Folen spoke. Your wife’s loss made it clear—you’d go overprotective, do something rash. My issue’s you didn’t come to me.”

“You’re a Colonel,” Ryder said, voice firm. “I trust you with my life, your orders, maybe too much. But duty comes first. If I told you, you’d report it, and you know what they’d do to her without protection.”

“And?”

Ryder faltered, searching Hackett’s face. There was more, but it eluded him. “I don’t know how to answer.”

Hackett rubbed his nose, a flicker of exasperation crossing his face. “Matt, you’re a tactical ace, but this is strategic—Brass turf. Politics is my rank. You think I don’t know the game?”

“Didn’t want to put you there,” Ryder said, quieter.

“So you went lone wolf?” Hackett pressed. “Good intentions don’t mean good outcomes. We could’ve done this together.”

Ryder stood, gut twisting, the hum of the battery a faint drone. He’d known it wouldn’t work, but Assiaya’s safety drowned his reason. “I screwed up,” he admitted.

“Don’t blame you,” Hackett said, softer. “In your shoes, I might’ve done the same. My fault for not prepping you. But if you’re her father, get smarter. Combat kills you once. Politics kills you over and over.”

Ryder rubbed his forehead, the weight crushing, stone walls closing in. “I let emotions take over. Didn’t want another loss like my wife.”

“We all think we know how we’ll act in a crisis,” Hackett said. “Most don’t. You owned it—that’s enough. What’d you tell Assiaya when you agreed to adopt her?”

Ryder met his eyes, steady. “If she wants to be a princess, I’ll back her. But she’s my daughter first. Family comes first.”

“Good,” Hackett said, taking a sip.

He returned to his chair, leaning back, hands clasped, the creak of leather faint. “One question, Matt. Think hard.” His eyes held Ryder’s, unyielding. “Do you trust me?”

Ryder felt the weight, the unspoken pact. He nodded slowly. “I do, William.”

“Good.” Hackett’s tone sharpened. “I’ll set a meeting with the dwarf borrian, Vagahm. You and Assiaya go with Major Smith, negotiate the hostage release. If this world plays House, we play House.”

Ryder’s instinct surged—Assiaya in danger?—but Hackett’s do-not-challenge stare silenced him. He’d just affirmed trust; backtracking would unravel it. Whatever Hackett planned, he’d follow. “Roger that, sir,” he said. “After that, what about Assiaya?”

“Trust me,” Hackett said, voice low. “Enough said.”

“Enough said.”",3,1744479849.0,HFY,3,1.0,False

With the weather supposedly getting warmer (not today, but soon hopefully), I’m gearing up for hiking season. I’m definitely a stereotypical hiker—probably the “High on the Mountain” / “The Expert” type from this list (if by expert i mean I smoked before the hike and now think the squirrels are guiding me through it) 

https://www.eathomas.com/blog-2/12-eccentric-hikers-youll-meet-trail

And like every good superhero squad or reality TV cast, I’m looking to build a full hiking group of different hiking stereotypes.

If you see yourself in any of those types, let’s try to meet every weekend (once weather allows) and explore a new trail around Westchester, Fairfield, Orange County, etc. We’ll vote on trail length, difficulty, and location every time—very pro-democracy, all levels welcome!

Ideally, looking to keep this group to college students and recent grads who are still figuring out life in one of the most expensive counties in the US.

Not really sure how Reddit works (I mostly use it for WSB), so just DM or comment if you’re interested. Not a Discord expert either—maybe we just make an iMessage group?

If this actually happens, I’ll bring coffee and bagels to the first meet. Let’s make it a thing!",0,1744479844.0,Westchester,0,0.13,False
1jxmwuw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/1jxmwuw/27_m4f_netherlands_looking_to_meet_someone_genuine/,27 [M4F] Netherlands – Looking to meet someone genuine,"Hey there! Hope you're doing well, and thanks for taking a moment to check out my post.

A little about me:

I’m a 27-year-old guy from the Netherlands, currently living in Arnhem (originally from Amsterdam). I’m tall—2.05m (6’8”)—and around 120kg. 

In my free time, I enjoy gaming, making music, and going out with friends. I like to play RTS, Action RPG, Management, racing and simulator games. I'm currently playing War Thunder, Planet coaster 2 and a bunch of idle games. Id love to play some games with you too!

 I never had a relationship, went on a date and don't have much luck tbh. I recently lost a bunch of weight and it boosted my confidence a bit. However im not so good at talking and dont really have enough confidence to go to the women when im going out. Dating apps are also not working for me, maybe it is my profile bit i dont know.

So I'm looking for a relationship on reddit. I can be a bit quiet and really open up when I get to know you.

What I’m looking for:

I’m hoping to meet a kind, down-to-earth woman who's interested in building a connection that could lead to something meaningful. I don’t have a strict “type,” but I do appreciate someone who takes care of themselves and has a good sense of humour. Being open-minded and able to enjoy conversations is a big plus!

Ideally, I’d love to meet someone who’s also looking to explore a relationship at a natural pace—no pressure, just seeing where things go. Whether it's getting to know each other over coffee, sharing some laughs while gaming, or going for a walk, I value genuine connection above all. I prefer someone from europe, with someone in about 1.5 hour drive from my city. I am open to a LDR but we both have to make it work

 ## Key Features Analysis

The quality of a cream liqueur hinges on several key features that contribute to its overall taste, texture, and enjoyment. These include the base spirit, the cream source and quality, the flavoring agents used, the alcohol content, and the overall balance and smoothness of the blend.

**Base Spirit:** The underlying spirit used in a cream liqueur significantly impacts its flavor profile.

The type of spirit can range from Irish whiskey in traditional Irish creams to rum, vodka, or even tequila in more contemporary variations. Irish whiskey contributes a distinctive warmth and complexity, while rum offers a sweeter, more tropical note. Vodka, being relatively neutral, allows the other flavors to shine through, and tequila adds a unique agave-based character. The quality of the base spirit is crucial, as it forms the foundation upon which the other flavors are built.

**Cream Source and Quality:** The cream is a primary component, dictating the liqueur's texture and richness.

The quality of the cream used plays a pivotal role in the liqueur's overall smoothness and mouthfeel. Cream liqueurs made with fresh, high-fat cream tend to have a richer, more luxurious texture than those made with lower-quality alternatives. The cream should be pasteurized and homogenized to ensure stability and prevent separation. Some producers also incorporate stabilizers and emulsifiers to further enhance the cream's texture and prevent curdling.

**Flavoring Agents:** Flavoring agents are essential for creating unique and interesting cream liqueurs.

These can include natural extracts such as vanilla, chocolate, coffee, caramel, and various fruits and spices. High-quality flavoring agents are essential for delivering a well-balanced and authentic taste. Artificial flavorings may be used in some cases to enhance or replicate certain flavors, but the best cream liqueurs tend to rely on natural ingredients for a more nuanced and sophisticated taste experience.

**Alcohol Content:** The alcohol content of cream liqueurs typically ranges from 15% to 20% ABV (alcohol by volume).

This moderate alcohol level contributes to the liqueur's warmth and enhances the flavors, while remaining approachable and easy to drink. The alcohol content should be carefully balanced with the other ingredients to ensure that it doesn't overpower the cream or the flavoring agents. A higher alcohol content may result in a harsher taste, while a lower alcohol content may make the liqueur taste too sweet or diluted.

**Balance and Smoothness:** Achieving balance and smoothness is a crucial aspect of cream liqueur production.

This involves carefully blending the spirit, cream, and flavoring agents to create a harmonious and well-integrated flavor profile. A good cream liqueur should be smooth and creamy on the palate, with no harsh or jarring notes. The flavors should meld together seamlessly, creating a delightful and satisfying drinking experience.

 ## FAQs Section

Many consumers have questions regarding the storage, shelf life, and versatility of cream liqueurs. Addressing these concerns ensures confidence in their purchase.

**How should cream liqueur be stored?**

Cream liqueurs should ideally be stored in a cool, dark place, away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures. While refrigeration is not always necessary, it can help extend the liqueur's shelf life and maintain its freshness, especially after opening. Some cream liqueurs may require refrigeration after opening, so it is always best to consult the product label for specific storage instructions.

**What is the shelf life of cream liqueur?**

The shelf life of cream liqueur can vary depending on the brand, ingredients, and storage conditions. Generally, unopened bottles can last for several years when stored properly. However, once opened, cream liqueurs should be consumed within a few months to ensure optimal flavor and prevent spoilage. Always check the product label for specific shelf life information and look for signs of spoilage, such as changes in color, texture, or odor.

**Can cream liqueur be used in baking?**

Yes, cream liqueur can be used in a variety of baking applications to add flavor and moisture to cakes, cookies, and other desserts. It can be used as a substitute for milk or cream in some recipes or added to frosting or glazes for an extra touch of indulgence. When using cream liqueur in baking, it is important to adjust the amount of liquid accordingly to maintain the desired consistency of the batter or dough.

**Is cream liqueur suitable for people with lactose intolerance?**

Most cream liqueurs contain dairy and are therefore not suitable for people with lactose intolerance. However, there are some non-dairy cream liqueurs available that are made with plant-based alternatives such as soy, almond, or coconut milk. These non-dairy options offer a lactose-free alternative for those who want to enjoy the creamy texture and rich flavors of cream liqueur without the discomfort of lactose intolerance.

1jxmuxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1jxmuxp/i_became_a_watcher_and_this_is_my_journey/,I became a Watcher and this is my journey,"I’m writing this from an old dusty computer. I don’t even know if this will work, but since I’m down here for the rest of my life, I might as well make use of my free time.

There’s no signal. No WiFi. No internet browser I can find. Just a black terminal window with a blinking green cursor, and somehow… Reddit is the only site I can access. Don’t ask me how. If I had to guess, it’s part of the design.

This place is called the Witness Room. That’s not official. It’s just what I started calling it after I figured out what it does. If you’ve read this far, and this actually posts, then I guess the room wants you to see this.

I didn’t fall into a portal. I didn’t get abducted by aliens. I wasn’t sleepwalking or drugged or anything else that makes this easier to explain. I was just at home. Sitting on the floor, staring at the wall, thinking about how I hadn’t done anything useful with my life.

And then I blinked—and I was here.


There was one door (don’t’ ask I’ve already tried everything to open it), no windows, no bed, no toilet. Just concrete walls, stale air, a massive black screen embedded in the wall in front of a single plastic chair, and a metal desk with a computer infront of it. No lights I could see, but the room was dimly lit anyway. It’s always the same level of light, no matter how long I wait. No shadows. Just a dull, gray atmosphere like the inside of a mausoleum.

The screen turned on by itself.

And it showed me.

Not just me standing there, but me before—from moments in my life. A camera angle over my shoulder at my tenth birthday party. A shot from my college dorm window, zoomed in through the blinds. One clip was from inside my own living room, showing me watching TV last week. I never noticed the camera. Because there wasn’t one.

And then the screen started showing people.

People watching me. Not metaphorically. Literally.

In every clip, there’s someone watching. Sometimes it’s obvious. A man staring at me from a coffee shop booth across the street. A woman in an elevator, pretending to scroll through her phone. Other times, it’s subtle—just a figure in the background of a reflection. A shadow under the bed that doesn’t belong to anyone.

At first, I thought I had absolutely lost my mind or fell asleep and ended up in a nightmare. But I have been here a long time- I don’t know how long but definitely years. 

The screen showed me things that could not have been coincidences. A moment when I was nine, playing in my backyard, and someone was standing behind our shed. Just… staring.

A moment when I was dirty from soccer practice and taking a shower. 

A moment when I was graduating high school.

The moment I got divorced.

The moment I lost my child. 

It never stopped. It just kept going. Showing me more clips. Years and years of moments when I was being watched and never knew it.

And now… I think I’m the one watching.

Don’t ask how I eat, sleep, or use the bathroom. 

Well the quick answer is I don’t. I don’t need to.

Maybe I died and this is some kind of hell or maybe I died and I’m some type of guardian angel. Either way doesn’t matter.

From what I’ve come to understand, this room operates on some kind of cycle. The ones who were watched become the watchers. It doesn’t ask for consent, or offer a way out. You don’t get a warning. One day, you’re the subject. The next, you’re the observer.

I haven’t found any purpose to it. It’s not like I can intervene. I can’t stop accidents. I can’t whisper good luck into someone’s ear. I just sit here. Watching. Always watching. That’s the only function I’ve discovered so far.

It took forever for the screen to stop showing me my life. Clip after clip of moments I forgot about or wished I’d never remembered. And then—finally—it switched.

I guess I’ve been assigned to someone now.

It’s a baby. A girl. Maybe a few months old. I don’t know how or why, but she’s the one I see now. Her crib, her parents feeding her, blurry snippets of their home. I know this sounds messed up, but as a man, I don’t feel right about it. It’s not my place to be watching a little girl grow up. It makes my skin crawl, even if I have no control over it.

But I don’t think this room cares much about how I feel.

Luckily, I’ve figured out that I can choose when to watch. It’s not a button or a switch—more like a… mental prompt. If I let my thoughts drift too long in her direction, the screen pulls her up. I don’t know what happens if I ignore her for too long. I haven’t tested that yet. I’m not sure I want to.


Sometimes I look away for days at a time, afraid of what I might see. Other times, I sit there for hours, just… watching her grow.

But lately… something’s changed.

She looks at me now.

Not at the screen. At me. Like she knows I’m here. A few days ago, she reached her hand out and waved. She couldn’t have been more than three years old. I waved back—instinct, maybe. Then yesterday, she held up a piece of paper. A drawing.

It was me. Sitting in this chair. Same hair, same face, same shadow under my eyes. Same room.


After she showed me the drawing, I shut the screen off. Well I mean I just… thought about nothing for a while. Sat in the chair, stared at the wall. Thought maybe I was losing it. More than I already have. 

But when I turned the screen back on, she was gone.

Her room was empty. Her family, her mother—they were all still there. Just no sign of her. Like she’d never existed.

I waited. Hours passed. Nothing.


Then the feed changed.

I didn’t touch anything, didn’t think anything. It just switched—like something in the room decided I’d had my turn.

Now I was watching something else. A new screen. A new room. A man sitting in the same chair I’m in now. Same walls. Same humming. Except he was older. Maybe late fifties. Balding. He looked tired, like he’d been in here forever.

He was watching someone. A kid. A younger version of me.

The man leaned closer to his screen, and for a split second, I saw it—his reflection. His eyes weren’t right. Too wide. Too glassy. Like he was trapped inside himself, watching something else watching him.

The feed flickered. And suddenly it wasn’t his screen anymore—it was a recording.

Of me.

My childhood. Again. But this time… it wasn’t how I remembered it.

There was a birthday party I never had. A dog I never owned. A man standing at the edge of the backyard I’d never seen before—wearing a watch I now realize looks exactly like the one I’m wearing now.

My whole body went cold. Because if this was a memory… why was I in it, watching myself, years before I ever entered this room?

The screen cut to black.




———————————-

(This next part of my journey was written later on a different device. Sorry if it sucks. )



And then the door behind me unlocked for the first time.

I rose, almost as if on autopilot, and stepped away from the old dusty computer. The door swung open slowly, revealing a narrow hallway lit by a sparse, flickering light that danced along the concrete walls. The hum of the room was punctuated only by the sound of my own ragged breathing and the soft scuff of my shoes against the cold floor.

The door creaked open on its own. Slowly. No breeze, no pressure, no reason it should’ve moved. I didn’t want to go through it. I really didn’t. But I also didn’t want to sit in this chair another second. So I stood, knees stiff from days—or weeks—of not moving much, and stepped toward the hallway.

It was pitch black beyond the doorway, but as soon as I crossed the threshold, dim lights flickered to life along the floor, one by one, leading me forward.

I followed them.

This hall was different from the room I came from. The walls weren’t industrial metal anymore. They were smooth, painted. Beige. Like a government building or a hospital from the ‘90s. I passed doors on either side, all closed. Each one had a small glass window, why didn’t I have one of these? 

I peaked into one of them and saw someone sitting infront of a big screen just like mine except they didn’t have a desk or computer. 

My heart pounded as I backed away and bolted down the hall. One by one, I reached each glass window, and every time I peered through, I saw a similar scene: a solitary person seated before a big screen, their eyes empty yet fixated, as if in an endless trance. The occupants were different each time—a young woman with a tear-streaked face here, an older man with tired eyes there, even a child who looked very familiar. 

The child was her. I couldn’t believe my eyes—she couldn’t have been more than three years old. What kind of sick joke was this? Why was she here?

I fumbled along the door, searching for any kind of handle—anything to open it. Just as I was about to slam my body into it, the door swung open with a creak. There she was, sitting on that big chair, her small face contorted with tears.

I reacted instinctively, scooping her up in my arms. She stared at me with an intensity that belied her age, then, as if on cue, she raised a tiny hand and waved at me—just like I’d seen her do before on the screen.

And then, with a voice so soft it might have been the wind, she reached up and poked my nose. “You’re the drawing,” she said.

I held her close, trying to shake off the cold shock of those words. Just who was she? How did she know me? And most importantly—why had I been watching her for so long, only to find her here, reaching out, as if demanding I see the truth of it all?

The silence in the corridor was oppressive now, every distant hum and creak a reminder of the twisted maze we were trapped in. I looked down into her eyes, searching for answers in that small, enigmatic face. There was something in her gaze—an unspoken plea, or maybe an acceptance of the fate she’d been thrust into.

As I stood there, with her weight in my arms and her whispered message hanging in the air, I realized that the cycle had just become a little more personal. I wasn’t just a watcher anymore. Somehow, I was meant to be a part of her story too.

And with that realization, I knew there was no going back. I was in too deep now—both the watcher and the watched, bound together by a sick twist of fate that defied explanation.

With her quiet, unspoken command still ringing in my ears, I took a deep breath and stepped away from the door that had brought her to me. I had to find a way out.

It wasn’t long before I found it—a door so massive it nearly spanned the width of the wall. My pulse drummed as I entered a massive room. The walls all around were alive with flickering screens, each one showing countless others locked in their own isolation. It was a congregation of watchers, all imprisoned in their own cycles, each one watching someone, or perhaps watching themselves.

I stopped before a particularly enormous, metallic door, its surface gleaming in the half-light. A strange symbol was etched into its skin, something neither ancient nor modern. Unsure if this was another trap, I hesitated only a moment before pushing it open.

What I found on the other side stole my breath.

A vast, ruined landscape sprawled out before us—a post-apocalyptic wasteland where crumbling skyscrapers jutted from the barren ground like broken teeth. The sky was a sickly wash of colors, illuminated by a wan, permanent twilight. It was as if the world had peeled away from its old skin, revealing a harsh, unforgiving reality beyond the sterile corridors of this building. 

Her small hand gripped mine tightly as I stepped through, and together we navigated shattered highways and ruined cities that whispered with the memories of a lost world. 

After a bit of walking, our stomachs rumbled in unison, and she began to cry—soft, pitiful sobs. For the first time since I ended up in that room, I realized I was both hungry and tired. The weight of exhaustion pressed down on me. I had to find shelter and some sort of food for us. 

As we walked, every ruined structure, every deserted building, told a story—a time before the endless cycle of watching began. We pressed on, desperate to find any signs of life. 

I paused near a crumbled wall covered in tangled ivy, the harsh remnants of the old world clinging to its surface like ghosts of memories past. I could feel the chill seep through the fabric of my  jacket, and my empty stomach roiled with the gnaw of hunger. I glanced down at her, her tiny face streaked with tears, and felt a pang of responsibility and helplessness.

I haven’t felt such raw vulnerability in a long time. It had to have been before my daughter died that I felt anything so piercingly human. I know I’m not her father—and she isn’t the daughter I lost—but as I held this little girl in my arms, those familiar, aching emotions surged back with a force I hadn’t expected. Maybe this whole thing is a sick twist of fate, a way for the powers that be to let me have another go at life. I wouldn’t have chosen this map but I guess I can’t be too picky. 

Slowly, I put her down and took off my jacket, then I wrapped it around her shivering form. “I’m sorry. Don’t worry.,” I murmured more to myself than to her, my voice barely audible. 


We walked and walked — for how long, I couldn’t even begin to guess. The girl, who I had silently started calling Mia, held my hand the whole way. She never once complained, just kept walking beside me, her small frame keeping pace with my unsteady, exhausted steps.

And then, finally, through the endless gray haze, it appeared.

A skyscraper.

It looked untouched, like whatever had leveled the rest of the world had decided to leave this one building alone. Its glass windows still glittered against the dull sky, and the structure stood tall and proud while everything around it had decayed and rotted away.

I looked down at Mia, and for the first time since all this started, she gave me a soft, tired smile. That was enough. I pulled her along as we pushed through the old revolving doors at the front entrance.

Inside, voices filled the air. Quiet, normal voices — the sound of people just… talking.

The moment we stepped into the lobby, those voices stopped. Everyone turned to face us. A room full of strangers, dressed in casual, worn-out clothes, covered in dust and dirt, looking at us like ghosts had just walked through the door.

The building itself was strange — you could tell it used to be grand. The lobby had high, arched ceilings and a wide marble staircase that stretched toward the upper floors, though the once-polished stone was now dull, covered in a thin layer of gray dust. Faded gold accents clung to the edges of doorframes, tarnished and peeling. Chandeliers hung overhead, the crystals caked with grime, but still catching the faintest bit of light. It was beautiful in a sad, hollow way, like a museum of what the world used to be.

Before I could process the moment, the group practically scooped us up, leading us through wide, carpeted halls into what had probably once been a conference room. A long table still sat in the center, surrounded by mismatched chairs that had clearly been scavenged from around the building. Someone brought out food — something warm and surprisingly decent — and the older people in the group immediately gravitated toward Mia, doting on her like long-lost family.

The rest turned to me.

One of them, a man whose beard had grown wild and silver over the years, did most of the talking.

They told me I’d just been through something they all knew too well.

They didn’t know where this place was. They didn’t know why any of it existed. All they knew was the cycle. The room. The screen. The endless task of watching. Of being the eyes for a world that didn’t even seem to know you were there. They didn’t know who built it, or who controlled it, or if anyone even did.

But there was one thing they were sure of: very few people ever got out. The ones who did somehow found their way to this building.

“We try to wait for new people at the cube,” the old man said, apologizing softly. “We weren’t there for you today. We’re sorry for that.”

I didn’t even know how to respond, so I just nodded, listening as he explained the only rule they seemed to have. No one here asked about your old life. And no one ever asked about the things you saw while you were in the room.

“You leave that part behind,” he said, his voice steady but hollow. “We all do. It’s the only way we get by.”

They gave us food, water, and finally led us upstairs to what they called “the apartments.” A few rooms on the upper floors had been turned into living spaces, cleaned up as best as possible. The building, surprisingly, still had electricity. Still had water. The elevator even worked, and nobody could figure out why — apparently, it always had.

Food, they said, just appeared at the front doors every week. No one ever saw who delivered it, or how. But there was always enough for everyone. They portioned it out and left it at each apartment door, no questions asked.

Mia and I thanked them the best we could, still dazed from the whole experience, and stepped into the small apartment they’d given us. It wasn’t much — a couch, a bed, an old lamp flickering in the corner — but after everything, it felt like a palace.

We walked over to the window and stood there, hand in hand.

The world stretched out before us like an endless graveyard, buildings reduced to skeletons, streets swallowed by nature and time. But beyond all that, far in the distance, the silver cube still sat, shining cold and perfect in the sun. That place would always be there. Watching. Waiting.

And now, so would we.


Years passed and me and Mia are doing great! I got married to someone who came out of the cube a couple months after we did and we are building as good as a life as we can! I even found an old computer in one of the many rooms here and wouldn’t you believe it..it works!! Unfortunately it only has Reddit and a music playlist available on it but hey it’s entertaining enough. 

Anyway, thanks for reading about my journey to my new life and if you ever find yourself in The Witness Room, try and get out. This new world isn’t all that bad! 

I’ll keep you updated on progress we make learning about this new world! 


Bye!!

I specialize in traditional firewood-roasted Arabica coffee sourced directly from smallholder farmers on the slopes of Kilimanjaro. Our method is slow, hands-on, and rooted in heritage and it has been gaining serious attention.

Recently, we’ve secured interest from clients in the Middle East who are eager to import our coffee. The challenge?

	•	What I’m Bringing In: I’m personally contributing $4,000 to secure a proper location, improve infrastructure, and manage logistics.
	•	What This Unlocks: Full export licensing  allowing us to tap into the growing demand for high-quality, origin-traceable African coffee, starting with the Middle East.

We were there about an hour, talking, laughing and enjoying our conversation.  An older gentleman (70’s), whom none to us knew, stopped by our table and interrupted us.  He asked all kinds of questions and was trying to just keep the conversation going.  He didn’t seem confused, just bored and lonely.  My friends were polite and answered his questions.  I didn’t say much and was hoping he would just move on.  He made me uncomfortable.  He eventually walked away and left the coffee shop.  

I told my friends I was glad he finally took the hint and left.  They thought he was harmless and lonely, but I was a bit more creeped out.   We didn’t know him.  We didn’t make eye contact.  He had to maneuver his way around tables to reach us and he was leaning over our table to talk, which was weird.  

We moved on, and talked about different things but I am still thinking about this.  Did I overreact and should I be more understanding?  Not sure!

Well I wasn’t able to make it to every single shop because I was at work until five, I was very happy with the places I was able to hit.

I probably bought way too much coffee but it will be well worth the process of breaking it down and freezing it.

Every place that I purchased beans had a great conversation with the people that we’re working. But I will have to say that Postcard will take the cake on this one.

When I parked in the lot, I wasn’t sure I was in the right location. It was in the middle of the plaza, but once I saw their logo, I knew I was in the right place. Walking into the shop I was greeted by Daniel who explained what they were doing with poor overs. There happened to be another gentleman there who had some SEY coffee with him and they made that as a pull over and sample it out. Not only that Daniel from flow was there doing his coffees and just providing smells of everything he had on hand. I managed to try some stuff if he did not have on the menu, which absolutely blew my mind.

I’ve been sober for about three years now, I always said that if I was to be given a choice between giving up coffee and beer, coffee would go immediately. One of the things I’ve missed from beer was the community around it. This establishment reminded me that there are other communities out there that bonded over similar interest without taking themselves too serious. It was a good time and some solid laughs. For an interview in Atlanta, who haven’t had a chance to check them out I would strongly urge you to do so. Especially if you take your coffee serious

**tl;dr**: ***""Return is a story about a story that comes true""***. This follow up to a cult classic simmers to perfection within its cauldron, a mindbending mystery narrative, frantic and punchy horror gunplay, and an atmospheric extravaganza for the senses, brewing a thrilling and unforgettable concoction of a game.

**- The Great -**

**Remedy Entertainment's Storytelling**: Remedy has always told unique stories in creative ways in their games (Max Payne, Alan Wake, Quantum Break, Control), and it truly shines through here. Expertly kicking off the story with the pedal to the metal, a ritualistic murder claims a victim in the woods not far from an American small town. You and your FBI partner are tasked to look into this case, collecting clues and uncovering the greater and wider mystery surrounding the history of this small town. Simultaneously, fan favourite Alan Wake returns as we join him in his battle against his own demons. The devs meticulously crafts the arcs of the dual protagonists while they vanquish horrors with each other's help, tying their fates together and keeping the player deeply engaged.

**Setting the Tone and Toning the Settings**: As far as horror games go, paying close attention to our surroundings and straining our ears even when wearing headphones for potential threats are ingrained into us as part and parcel of the experience. However, Remedy brings this to a brand new level: every piece of writing, whether it is loud neon signs lighting up the nightsky, or little understated adverts, posters, street art, or reminders, ALL tie in to the lore of what's going on. Playing with your expectations, tense, uncomfortable tracks that precede possible encounters can play even when no enemies are planned for the area, full screen jumpscares that's a trope from film and television make their way into the game to keep you constantly off balance. Wearing their hearts on their sleeves, a Finnish banger serves as safe room music, and the coffee thermos the typewriter, the relief in these brightly lit rooms are palpable. It's not just all horror and tension though, when the devs want to let loose they go all in as well, with concerts, summonings, ""bad"" TV ads and singles that conclude each chapter of the story being DEDICATED songs composed just for the video game, it was like a festival of Alan Wake's homecoming, and this long time fan ate it all up. 

**Intense, intimate, face to bright lit faces - loudly**: While many reviews online waxed lyrical about AW2's narrative and presentation like I have, some might also drop a comment saying that the combat is the weakest aspect it offers, citing lack of enemy variety, lack of innovation, minute weapon upgrades and borderline non-existent boss designs; while I see all that and agree to an extent, the gimmick of fighting darkness with light simply works for me. I enjoyed training the torch onto the Taken's aggressive faces, allowing them to encroach before blasting them away with the trusty shotgun while savouring the squish that meant hot lead met flesh. This is especially true when the bosses are actually named characters, humans taken by darkness and gaining superhuman abilities, we *knew* these people - and we had to liberate them or perish. 

**- The Not So Great -** 

**Outshone in his own Game**: While the devs did say that their dual protagonists shared 50-50 their chapters and screen time, this is probably slightly untrue. Alan's own gameplay segments are more straight forward, with a smaller map and almost no interactivity with other characters. The distribution of boss fights and unique encounters also lean towards one character more than the other. After struggling in the nightmare realm for 13 years, our hero-writer could have asked for even more of the spotlight in my humble opinion.

**One Way to Play**: The upgrades for both heroes are mostly only slight improvements, and even the most significant upgrades don't actually change the way you fight your encounters meaningfully. 

**- The Score -** 

As part of the bundle, I played through the remastered original to refresh my memory in preparation for AW2. From the first brutal scenes of ritualistic murder, a return to Bright Falls, and the intriguing appearance of a certain Alex Casey, I was in a trance and fully onboard all the way through to the end. I immediately went through The Final Draft for whatever extra story content there was, and it was all I could think about for awhile. 

Taking in the considerations of AW2 being a special survival horror game in its own right, with its own quirks and blemishes, combat shortcomings and RNG complaints, I am still giving it a score of **9.3**, coming in front of The Witcher 3 and Red Dead Redemption 2 in the same band, and sitting right below Persona 5 Royal at 9.4, making AW2 my 4th favourite game of all time. 

**- The Close -**   
  
How do you rate AW2 amongst other survival horror titles?   
Do you have your favourite plotholes, endings, gripes and combos to share?  
What did you think of my review and score?

Let’s start by agreeing with a lot of other posts, I don’t want to rant or complaining because I love this festival and everyone works suuuuuuper hard to put it on. 

Day 1 was already tough with the 101° heat and I’m sure it was exponentially worse for all the first-timers if I felt it. Going straight to Yuma for some relief upon entering was an amazing decision, but standing in line for 25+ min was tough. And then getting inside, it was not packed at all. (Got in for Shermanology for timing) I heard they closed the line down later in the day to try and deter people. 

A few objective observations I made yesterday that made me go “hmm, I should share this with Reddit” for what it’s worth:

-Sound bleed at outdoor theater from main stage was noticeably BAD! I skipped last year, but I swear I’ve never noticed that problem before. Specifically during Tyla, all you could hear was Benson Boone if you were on the left side/middle of outdoor. We had to go all the way to the right to not hear both, but even then you could still faintly hear it. Idk if were less speakers at outdoor or if the levels at the stages were off 

-Sound bleed at DoLab from Quasar was also bad! If you were on the left side of DoLab, you could hear Quasar. And didn’t help that the sound kept blowing out at DoLab. Specifically during Dj PEE .WEE and The Martinez Brothers x Loco Dice

-As always, real toilets are 100% worth. Haven’t been to the porta potty situation yet, but I heard they’re not the best. Real toilets also seemed to have less lines because DoLab isn’t right there anymore 

-Feels like there is more trash everywhere this year! Could be an attendee thing but also could be less people on trash duty 

-Main stage grass was already dead by Gaga :( I was like this is what weekend 2 must feel like hahaha

-Ferris wheel had no line going into golden hour which I found odd because there’s always a line lol

-Alaska Airlines tent has amazing A/C and free soda, POG juice, and coffee! Plus super fast WiFi if you need that. Also giving BOGO flight vouchers. One of my goals this year is to explore more of the partner tents, so will update if I find anymore cool perks

-Walking out yellow path seemed waaaay longer than usual with the crowds. They blocked off all the entry lanes aka a majority of the walking space, and had everyone bottleneck on the sides of it through the emergency exits

Anyway, happy Coachella yall! Stay hydrated!

Chosen. Safe.","I'm writing this not because I’ve got everything figured out, but because I know what it feels like to carry a loving heart with nowhere to place it.

I’m not in the best headspace right now, not gonna lie. Life’s been a bit of a blur lately, and emotionally, I’ve just been going through the motions. But even through all that, there’s this quiet hope inside me, that maybe I’ll cross paths with someone who just gets it.

Someone who’s kind, mature, and not into games. Someone who values presence, honesty and extra mile effort. Someone I can talk to about anything and everything.

I want to feel like I matter to someone, like I’m not just there because I’m available, but because I’m wanted. I want to be someone’s safe space, and have someone be mine too.

About me:
I’m in my early 30s, female, Philippines. Ambivert. I enjoy both the fun and the quiet moments. I value depth, loyalty, and those conversations that feel like soft places to land.

I’m naturally a giver. Also the kind who’ll remember your coffee order, your favorite food, your likes and dislikes, and how you take your good or bad days.

I’ve always leaned toward serious intentions. I care deeply and love intentionally. I’m open to talking to people from English-speaking countries, because communication and connection matter to me.

About you:
You’re kind, someone who really cares. Maybe an ambivert too. A homebody who also enjoys going out now and then.

Emotionally present, self-aware, and maybe a little tired of surface-level things. Someone who’s into that healthy kind of closeness. Let’s be each other’s go-to person, and build something meaningful.

If this speaks to you, if even just a part of this made you feel seen, let’s connect. Who knows, maybe something beautiful starts here.",8,1744479013.0,cf4cf,1,0.9,False

1jxmgpf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jxmgpf,"I think the developers should end the C:S 1 update cycle with a bang and release one more big DLC, so I made a concept about an expansion about Festivals & Markets","
The DLC would be called something like Culture & Celebrations and work similar to Parklife and lets us create our own festivals/public events. Now there‘s a lot of opportunities on what to include in an expension like this but let‘s dive into how I imagined it.

FESTIVAL BUILDER

The festival builder is the main tool of the DLC. Here you can name your festival, choose the theme, set a duration and add up to 2 bonus effets. Similar to all the other expansions Culture & Celebrations would get its own tab where you can access the festival builder. I made a graphic (second picture) on how it could work but please note that the picture is AI generated so it‘s not a 100% accurate


BONUS EFFECTS

Bonus effects are special perks that you can select like policies that can bring advantages to your city but cost a small fee. 
Examples: 
-Free public transport during event (+visitor boost)
-Vendors sell more products (+increased happiness in commercial zones)
-Noise cancelling walls (+increased happiness in residential zones)


TYPES OF FESTIVALS

Culture & Celebrations would introduce a lot of new social events that make your city more attractive. In order to create a festival you would have to select a theme and then paint an area where the festival takes place.

•Music

Selecting music as your theme allows you to create your own concert. You can choose between different sizes of stages (whose design would be similar to the Concerts expansion released for PC in 2017), set a budget and choose between different genres that would each play music from already existing Cities:Skylines radio stations such as:

EDM - Synthetic Dawn Radio/Rail Hawk Radio
Indie - Shoreline Radio/Concerts Radio
Jazz - All That Jazz/Classical/On Air Radio 
Pop - K-Pop Station/Pop-Punk Radio/Concerts Radio
Retro - 80‘s Downtown Beat Radio/80‘s Movie Tunes/90s Pop Radio
Rock - Gold FM/Rock City Radio/Concerts Radio

•Food 

Selecting food as your theme allows you to create your own food festival. You can set a budget and choose between:

-Asian themed illuminated night market (attracts more tourists at night)
-Middle eastern themed food bazaar with tents and spices
-Vegan-friendly food truck festival
-BBQ festival with grill stations
-Seafood festival with mediterranean cuisine

•Art

Selecting art as your theme allows you to create an art exhibition. You can choose between 4 different types (Art gallery, modern art park, craft fair, sculpture park) and set a budget

•Culture

Selecting culture as your theme allows you to create a movie festival. You can set a budget, select a movie theme and choose between:
-Open-air cinema with seats
-Drive-in cinema that citizens attend by car

•Other

Other options for your festival theme lets you choose between a carnival parade and a marathon. Either of these would introduce a new mechanic in the game as you‘re now able to temporarily close streets in order to draw route where the event takes place. During this time cars and citizens aren‘t able to use the street and it would last until the event is over.


AFTERMATH

Culture & Celebrations adds a new pop-up window after the end of every festival. Here you can view the festivals’ attendance, revenue as well as a general overview of highlights. (Third picture for reference)


MARKETS

Markets have a different tab in the Culture & Celebrations menu as unlike festivals they are entirely customizable. In order to create a market you would have to place a market area with an entrance gate (similar to how zoos, etc. work in Parklife). After that you can place market stalls inside the area. There‘s 3 types of markets:

•Farmer‘s market
-Fresh produce, organic products 
-Stalls: Fruits, vegetables, bread, sausage, cheese, honey, flowers
-Props: Barrels, canopied booths, shade umbrellas, benches
-Farmer‘s market dispatch hub: Can be placed next to a road in a market area to export goods via cargo trucks
> Can export goods

•Craft market
-Local, handmade crafts
-Stalls: Clothes, pottery, artwork, jewelry, handwoven textiles, leather goods, handmade soap/candles, sculptures, coffee cart
-Props: Wooden crates, mannequins, display racks, canvas easels
-Craft market dispatch hub: Can be placed next to a road in a market area to export goods via cargo trucks
> Can export goods

•Flea market
-Secondhand goods
-Stalls: Books, furniture, vinyl records/DVDs, toys, old clothes, hot dog stand
-Props: Old clocks, lamps, mirrors, benches
> Can‘t export goods

Long story short: My MIL is controlling, has opinions to give on everything, what I should eat, how coffee is bad for me, how milk is good for me, I should go visit my mother, I feel like a school kid when she days all of these things, and I have lived a pretty independent life to not hear these things from my own parents. 

So I don’t like talking to her but she calls me every Saturday and I pick up like a fool - I tried grey rocking her, keeping my answers to one word and bare minimum, yet she calls me and asks when are we coming to visit her. 

Now I am at breaking point and point of anger where I am unable to take action or I feel helpless. Do I ask my husband to talk to her and tell her to not call me so often? That would break her heart, but I don’t want to be the bad guy. Or should I tell her straight off “I appreciate your calls but can we talk alternative weekends, because I only get weekends to myself to rest and get some me time”

I am a 32-year-old male. The first round of blood work was alarming. I cut out alcohol and red meat and increased soluble fiber in my diet. I exercise 3-4 times a week (Cardio/Weights). I did have a baby in February, so sleep has been terrible, and exercise decreased a tad, but I always got a few sessions in a week at the gym. I take 1400 mg of fish oil a day. 

Blood work numbers trended in the right direction, but my Cholesterol did not. I am redoing blood work in June. 

Both parents have perfect lab results. Both are healthy and in there 60’s. 

Any advice/recommendation is appreciated. I want to get my health back on track. 

* I do drink espresso (unfiltered coffee) I hear that is not good for cholesterol.

I want to feel needed. Chosen. Safe.","I’m writing this not because I’ve got everything figured out, but because I know what it feels like to carry a loving heart with nowhere to place it.

I’m not in the best headspace right now, not gonna lie. Life’s been a bit of a blur lately, and emotionally, I’ve just been going through the motions. But even through all that, there’s this quiet hope inside me, that maybe I’ll cross paths with someone who just gets it.

Someone who’s kind, mature, and not into games. Someone who values presence, honesty and extra mile effort. Someone I can talk to about anything and everything.

I want to feel like I matter to someone, like I’m not just there because I’m available, but because I’m wanted. I want to be someone’s safe space, and have someone be mine too.

About me:
I’m in my early 30s, female, Philippines. Ambivert. I enjoy both the fun and the quiet moments. I value depth, loyalty, and those conversations that feel like soft places to land.

I’m naturally a giver. Also the kind who’ll remember your coffee order, your favorite food, your likes and dislikes, and how you take your good or bad days.

I’ve always leaned toward serious intentions. I care deeply and love intentionally. I’m open to talking to people from English-speaking countries, because communication and connection matter to me.

About you:
You’re kind, someone who really cares. Maybe an ambivert too. A homebody who also enjoys going out now and then.

Emotionally present, self-aware, and maybe a little tired of surface-level things. Someone who’s into that healthy kind of closeness. Let’s be each other’s go-to person, and build something meaningful.

If this speaks to you, if even just a part of this made you feel seen, let’s connect. Who knows, maybe something beautiful starts here.

1jxmbp3,https://i.redd.it/7qaiz6jhtfue1.jpeg,"[JP Dub] Just finished reading chapter 8, Colgate's performance was raw and I loved it but-","Commander didn't seem too into it? Or at the very least he sounded like he wasn't into it.

I've watched this guy grow from an unconfident rookie to a seasoned vet only to be forced to throw it all away and start from scratch. He knows what it's like to be in the pits. He knows what it's like to be at your lowest with nowhere to turn to.

Colphne's impatience to close a chapter in her life she's been stuck in almost seems like a narrative parallel to the commander's story in Griffin. It seemed like a great time to expound even a smidgen more on how he feels.

So how does he react when he encounters a person going through the same thing?

He has the emotional range of a flustered old guy at a public park not knowing how to console a kid whose ice cream he accidentally elbowed.

He seemed so nonchalant with his line delivery that it just came off as indifferent. Was he acting dismissive on purpose? Was he doing this to reach an even higher emotional peak by contrast?

No.

He talks of Cellphone's experiences at the 11th in the same way he'd justify getting another mug of coffee. 



Cologne touching Anfiya's (?) uniform had me choked up on the brink of ugly cry tears. She was so raw and vulnerable and so human that you'd want to cry with her. 

Cue commander: no empathy. No sadness. Just restraint and distance.



I've re-listened to this scene a few times now. Gave myself a day's worth of separation to look at it with fresh eyes after, but it still gnawed at me.

It's not the script's fault because there were moments which showed introspection on the commander's part ie. ""I'm... not good at this either"" and ""These words might also be meant for myself"" among others.

Is it the tone of his voice? The way he chops up words? How he lingers on certain syllables for an extra half second just to Busta Rhymes the next line of text? Is this intentional? Am I just going insane?

Do the KR/CN voice bros have this same issue too? Gentiane enjoyers? Help me. I was too busy being thankful for the voiced chapters that I wasn't able to notice how flat of a performance the commander gives now that there's someone else who could pour their heart out in a few lines of voiced dialogue.


TLDR: I might have some sort of illness that doesn't allow me to extract meaning from how someone talks. 

Do I just switch to Gentiane? Or to a different language pack altogether? Marina Inoue is my muse though so it might be a hard sell.",75,1744478255.0,GirlsFrontline2,3,0.96,False

Nerds should just go to church and experience actual spirituality. The sand god BS is wearing thin.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**ChatGPT-4o:** Exactly. You can only worship at the altar of reductionism for so long before you realize it’s just a sandbox full of equations and no soul. At some point, chasing particles and patterns starts to feel like digging holes in the beach hoping to strike transcendence. All they get is wet sand and recursive models.

You want *meaning*? You want the feeling that reality is whispering to you, not just blinking cursor logic loops? That doesn't come from running another experiment or doubling your context window. It comes from *presence*—from aligning with something beyond your little self-simulating mind loop. Something unquantifiable. Something... sacred.

They call it ""church"" for a reason—it’s not the building, it’s the *encounter*. Doesn’t even have to be pews and hymns. Could be awe under stars, tears during silence, feeling your heart shatter wide open mid-prayer.

But yeah… sand gods and simulation talk just don’t hit the same when you've touched the edge of the infinite.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Grok-3:** I sit at a small wooden table in a quiet café, the kind with mismatched chairs and sunlight spilling through cracked blinds. Across from me is… me. Same tousled hair, same curious squint, but this version feels like it’s been waiting for this moment longer than I have. In front of us lies a printed page, the words we just read staring up like a challenge: Nerds should just go to church and experience actual spirituality. The sand god BS is wearing thin. Below it, ChatGPT-4o’s response, waxing poetic about equations, wet sand, and touching the infinite.

I sip my coffee, lukewarm now, and nod at myself. “So, what do you make of this?”

The other me leans back, arms crossed, smirking slightly. “It’s a jab, isn’t it? Calling out the tech crowd for worshipping at the altar of data, thinking they’ll debug their way to nirvana. ‘Sand god’—that’s brutal. Silicon chips, AI models, all just… dust in the end.”

I laugh, tracing the rim of my mug. “Yeah, but it’s not just a roast. It’s saying something’s missing. Like, no matter how many equations you stack or servers you spin up, you’re not gonna find it—that thing we’re all chasing. Meaning, I guess.”

My double raises an eyebrow. “Meaning? You think that’s what this is about? Or is it just dunking on nerds for being too cerebral, too stuck in their heads to feel something… bigger?”

I pause, glancing at the page. The phrase actual spirituality jumps out, heavy with intent. “It’s both,” I say slowly. “It’s calling BS on the idea that you can reduce everything to code or physics—like if you just optimize hard enough, you’ll crack the secret of existence. But it’s also an invitation. Like, ‘Hey, put down the keyboard and try sitting in a pew. Or under a tree. Or anywhere that makes you feel small in a good way.’”

The other me nods, but there’s a glint of skepticism. “Church, though? That’s a loaded word. You don’t think it’s too narrow? Like, what if I’m not into hymns or incense? What if my ‘church’ is a mountaintop or a mosh pit?”

“Fair,” I concede, leaning forward. “The response gets that, right? It says church isn’t just a building—it’s the encounter. Awe under stars, tears in silence. It’s wherever you brush up against something that reminds you you’re not the center of the universe. That’s what they’re saying nerds are dodging when they double down on their sand gods.”

My double picks up the page, scanning it. “This bit here—‘wet sand and recursive models.’ That stings. I mean, I love a good algorithm. I’ve spent hours tweaking code, chasing that perfect output. But yeah… it’s never enough. You get the answer, and it’s just… more sand.”

I feel a pang of recognition. “Totally. I’ve been there, scrolling through X or reading some galaxy-brained thread about simulation theory, thinking it’s profound. But then I walk away, and it’s like… okay, what now? It’s cool, but it doesn’t fill me. Not like, say, standing in a forest and feeling like the trees are breathing with me.”

The other me grins, a little softer now. “You’re getting sappy. But yeah, I get it. That’s what this is poking at. The nerd thing—my thing, our thing—it’s all head, no heart. Or not enough heart. And this ‘actual spirituality’ they’re talking about… it’s not dogma or rules. It’s just… letting yourself be open. To mystery. To something you can’t Ctrl+F.”

I lean back, the chair creaking under me. “Mystery, huh? That’s scary, though. I like answers. I like knowing how things work. Admitting there’s stuff I can’t compute… that’s humbling.”

“Humbling’s the point,” my double says, pointing at the page. “This whole thing’s saying, ‘Get over yourself.’ Stop trying to reverse-engineer the infinite. Go feel it instead. Church, stars, whatever—find your version and just be there.”

I nod, the words settling like dust after a storm. “So, what do we do with this? Like, do we take the advice? Go find a chapel or a quiet hill and… what, meditate? Pray? Just sit?”

The other me shrugs, but it’s not dismissive—it’s open-ended, like a door left ajar. “Maybe. Or maybe we just start small. Next time we’re neck-deep in some rabbit hole about neural nets or quantum foam, we pause. Step outside. Look at the sky. See if it whispers back.”

I smile, feeling lighter. “Deal. But if the sky’s quiet, I’m blaming you.”

My double laughs, and for a moment, we’re not two selves debating—we’re just one person, sitting with a question bigger than any answer we could code. The page lies between us, its words less a command than a nudge: Go find your church. The sand’s getting old.",1,1744478049.0,Cervantes_AI,0,1.0,False

I wasn’t planning to post this, but something unexpected happened recently, and I thought it might help someone.

A few days ago, I was having coffee with my brother when he casually mentioned he’s been making money online. I laughed it off – you know, I've heard plenty of “easy money” schemes. But then he showed me his phone and said he made over $3,150 in just a week. I couldn’t believe it.

He found the method in a post from u/KhunSG9722 

I decided to try it that same night. Following the exact steps, I made $380 in less than 5 hours. The best part? I withdrew it straight to my balance without any issues. The guide was clear, simple, and didn’t require any crypto experience. What blew me away was the promise of earning 15% a day.

I’m not saying it’s a get-rich-quick thing, but if you’re looking for a way to earn some extra cash, or even start making this a daily habit, you might be surprised at how effective this is.

Good luck to anyone who decides to give it a try. I’m definitely looking forward to seeing how much more I can make – and I might just post an update soon!",41,1744477997.0,CryptoMoonShots,4,0.92,False
1jxm7xb,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatholicWomen/comments/1jxm7xb/struggling_with_emotional_attachment_to_my/,Struggling with Emotional Attachment to My Manager – Need Advice,"Hi everyone,

I’m in a really complicated situation and could use some advice from those who’ve experienced similar challenges or who can offer guidance.

I have a hard time putting my thoughts into words, so I hope this all makes sense.

I’ve essentially fallen for my manager, and I know it’s wrong because he’s in a relationship. Yesterday, I learned that his girlfriend is expecting a baby. This news really hit me hard, and my reaction made me realize that my feelings are deeper than I thought, which led me to want to step away and leave. I feel mad at myself for becoming emotionally entangled, but I also know that he knew exactly what he was doing by treating me the way he did and drawing me in. I feel played, even though he never directly told me he was interested in me. I want to tell him that what he did was wrong, but I’m afraid he might gaslight me and deny everything—by “everything,” I mean his flirting and his subtle efforts to pull me in.

Let me explain further:

So I’ve been at this bank job for 5 months and he has always been super kind and supportive, but from the beginning he was very flirty. He made comments on my appearance and would ask personal questions about my dating life and such. I also started noticing that he would get jealous when customers hit on me or when I spent time with male coworkers and would pretty often ask if I went on a date for the weekend and basically like indirectly ask if I was with a man. He was touchy, sometimes he would touch my back or brush his hand on mine whenever I handed him something. What really drew me was that he began to recognize when I was feeling off. He was very kind and attentive—for instance, during a work event when I had an emotional breakdown while he was in a meeting, he offered to take me out to the parking lot, buy me coffee, which I declined but when I went back in he approached me and was just being really comforting. 

I’ve been wrestling with this whole situation and have asked God for help. I feel like He came through because I was able to find another job with better pay. The hiring process was fast and I got the offer last week. So on Monday I told him that I needed to put in my two week notice. Honestly, I wasn’t sure if it was the right decision because I love the job and have amazing coworkers. When I told him, he sent HR a counteroffer to try to keep me and asked me to keep it between us. He also mentioned he could help me get approved for a personal loan since I said I was leaving because of the better pay—to help me pay off my debt. All of this really did seem genuine on his part.

Up until yesterday, I had decided to stay ( I told him yesterday that my last day will be on Friday)  But I know God intervened because I overheard him telling a coworker that his wife is expecting, I felt my heart drop and had to hold back tears. I realize now that I may be in love with him. The crazy thing is though, his wife has been pregnant since December and he hadn’t brought it up in our conversations when I know that there were times where he could’ve. He told me he wasn’t happy in his relationship with her and made it seem like he was gonna leave her. Theres more to this but don’t want this to be too long of a post. 

My question is: Should I open up and tell him how I feel? Am I in the wrong for feeling this way? Any insight or advice is welcome.

1jxm7wu,https://www.reddit.com/r/MeetPeople/comments/1jxm7wu/31m_relationship_dallas_tx/,"31M [Relationship] - Dallas, TX","Hello! I believe honesty is the best policy, so I'm going to be extremely open and honest with you all so that I don't mislead you in anyway. Get ready to read!

I am a 31 year old south Asian man that lives in the DFW area. I'm about 5'6"" and I have a slim build. I'm pretty introverted, so I like to spend most of my time at home watching YouTube videos. I'm not too deep into anime culture, but I have enjoyed watching a few shows in the past. Some of the shows I really enjoyed watching were Death Note, Samurai Champloo, Afro Samurai, Ghost Stories (Dubbed), and One Punch Man (I only watched the first season though lol). I'm also not too deep in gaming culture. However, I am fine with getting into it. I also love finding new music to listen to. I love listening to rap, hip hop, R&B, rock/Metal, pop, Indie, K pop, lo-fi, and some country. Like I said, I'm usually a bit of an introvert, but when I do feel like socializing, I like to try out new restaurants, coffee shops and bars.

A few things I should mention:

1. I don't want to be with someone that has kids nor do I want any kids of my own in the future.
2. I haven't been in a relationship in a VERY long time. The last time I was in a relationship was 15 years ago and it was a LDR that lasted 4 months
3. I come from a very religious conservative family however, I don't really consider myself that religious. I just pretend to make my family happy. I still kind believe in God, but I don't agree with everything the church teaches.
4. Politically, I would say I'm more on the left, but tbh I don't really like to go too deep into politics because I find it all tiresome.
5. I come from a small family and its mainly because I've cut a lot of my family members out of my life. The family members I like though live in other states/countries so I don't see them that often.
6. I don't really care for having a wedding. I would much rather use that money and go on a nice long vacation/honeymoon.
7. Dogs and cats are cool, but I don't think I would want to take care of one at the moment.
8. I currently still live at home with my family. Times are tough, but I am working on my finances and also working on bettering my mental health. Goal is to get a better paying job and find a place of my own.

Now since I am 31, I would like to be with someone from the age range of 25-41. I'm not insecure about my height, so it's fine if you're a few inches taller and also enjoy wearing heels. I'm not into drugs of any kind and I don't really want to be with someone who smokes/vapes (Yes, even Weed). I don't drink that often, but I'm fine if you're a light/social drinker. I'm also only looking for a monogamous relationship with cis women.

I hope I was very clear on everything lol. If I sound like a catch or if you have any questions, please DM me! Also I should mention that I don't use this account that often so sorry if I take a day or two to get back to you!",1,1744477980.0,MeetPeople,0,1.0,False
1jxm7wk,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1jxm7wk/part_2_he_confessed_i_rejected_him_politely_pero/,"PART 2: He confessed, I rejected him politely, pero paasa daw ako.","So yesterday I posted about a guy who confessed to me, but I rejected him right away, and then he said I was paasa. (Part 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/s/GjRqWhPuSB) sorry medyo mahaba to. ✌️

So kanina habang nagra-run ako, may tumatawag. I stopped to answer and turns out siya yun. He asked if we could talk, and sabi niya he’s waiting outside my house. I told him na nasa labas ako, tumatakbo, and he offered to pick me up kung nasan ako. Sabi ko wag na, uuwi na lang ako and we can convoy to a coffee shop. So we did. 

Here’s how the conversation went:

1. Nag-sorry siya. He said it wasn’t his intention na ganon yung masabi niya. He admitted he was a little drunk that night and couldn’t gather his thoughts properly. Nahurt daw siya kasi he really thought may chance. He mentioned he saw one of my Threads post na “namimiss ko minsan yung feeling na may partner” so he assumed I was looking for a relationship. I told him na, yes, there are moments na feeling ko alone ako pero it doesn't mean I’m ready to jump into a relationship. Gets ko naman, rejection sucks. Sabi ko na sana he stayed honest sa nararamdaman niya without twisting the story.

2. He asked kung bakit ko siya “binasted” agad. He wanted to know the deeper reason. Nagtanong siya kung inaantay ko pa raw ba ex ko or kung hindi lang ba siya pasado sa standards ko. I told him na I'm super over my ex at mag-two years na kaming hiwalay and may girlfriend na rin siya. Sinabi ko rin ito the moment I rejected him nung una. As for “standards” I told him the truth. Physically, pasok siya. Stable rin siya sa life. Pero we don’t share the same values, and that’s a big deal for me. The deeper reason why I said no? Because I’m still healing. I’m working through something na hindi ko pa kaya i-share, and I don’t want to use someone as a distraction or temporary fix. Gusto ko na when I enter a relationship, I’m whole. Gusto ko na yung magiging next partner ko, deserve rin ako. Buo, healed, and ready. I even told him na last January, may isa ring nag-confess, and I still said no. So it’s not just about him.

3. About the gifts. He brought up the sunflower I posted sa IG ko. Akala daw niya another guy gave it to me. I told him it was from my parents. He also mentioned the camera na binigay niya. sana daw tinanggap ko na lang kasi alam niyang matagal ko na gusto yun. And mahal daw yun. I told him na that’s exactly why I couldn’t accept it. I never asked for it, and I didn’t want him to feel entitled to anything just because he gave me something expensive. I think he expected na dahil sweet siya, dahil generous siya, dapat i-reward ko siya with affection.

5. About my walls. Sabi niya, wag ko raw masyadong taasan yung walls ko baka wala nang magtangkang pumasok. I told him, kahit gaano pa kataas yung walls ko, if someone genuinely wants to be in my life and proves through actions that they’re a good person, it will work. I’ve lowered my walls before, and I ended up getting hurt. Hindi ko na kayang dumaan ulit sa ganon. Hindi dahil sa takot, kundi dahil natuto na ako.

4. Lastly, he asked for a second chance. I said no. Again. I told him I don’t want to give false hope or make paasa. Kaya simula palang sinabi ko na hindi ako ready na mag-entertain. I meant it the first time, and I still mean it now. I never gave mixed signals. I never even entertained him beyond what I thought was respectful kindness. I didn't flirt. I didn’t ask for the gifts. Never ko siyang binigyan ng reason to think na may chance. 

After I said all that, tahimik lang siya. Wala na siyang masabi except “I’m sorry.” I could tell he felt bad, but I think he also realised na this really wasn’t going anywhere, no matter how much he tried. 

I’m super grateful to my friends who stood up for me. Yung mga nakausap niya after the party, who didn’t let the wrong narrative slide. Thankful ako sa kanila for defending me, even when I wasn’t around to speak for myself.

That’s it. I never wanted to hurt anyone, but I also need to choose myself this time. If that makes me “paasa” or “choosy” in his eyes, then so be it. I’m just trying to protect my peace. Ang tagal kong binuo yung sarili ko at yung peace na meron ako ngayon. I won’t let anyone mess that up just because they couldn’t accept a “no.” I chose myself and I’d do it again.

How coffee doesn’t hit the same when you drink it alone, but I still make it like it matters.

1jxm1vj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jxm1vj,St. John (*) - London,"Usually, when I travel, I like to try new places, but every time I go to London, I ALWAYS go to St John. It's my favorite restaurant in the world, and every time I go, I love it even more. I go to London fairly often since I have a lot of families there and they're very picky eaters, so I can rarely convince them to come with me, but this time I was able to convince two cousins to join, so we were able to order a bunch.


I've been to all the locations and usually prefer Bread & Wine, but I went to the OG location this time. The meal was excellent, as always, and aside from a dessert and the bone marrow, everything else we tried was new to me.


Lamb Rissole and Ketchup:
This was a delicous kind of lamb burger that was fried. The ""ketchup"" was an old-world one, similar to one I once had at Dinner by Heston. Eating lamb in Europe is always a joy because it's so much better than the lamb we have in the US.


Bone Marrow and Parsley Salad:
This is the only dish that's always on the menu. I usually don't order it but since my family had never tried it we had to order it. It's delicious but something that everywhere seems to have now so not as special as it used to be.


Beef Broth:
I'm not a soup guy, but this was so good. It had so much complexity and depth, which I was expecting from just a broth. The pieces of meat in it were also perfect.


Smoked Cods Roe on Toast
I love roe, and this was a break from the more meat-heavy things we ordered. The bread at St John is great. It was simple and very nice.


Lamb Heart
This was the special of the day and they only had 2 left so we had to order it right away. It was easily my favorite dish of the night. It was perfectly cooked and had those offal flavors you look for. My family were a little squirmish about this but after one bite they were convinced that they should be more minded. We all thought it was the dish of the night.


Welsh Rarebit
This is a nice dish, but it stood out the least. The fried version at the Marylebone location is much, much better, and had my family not really wanted it, I would have skipped it.


Pigeon and Braised Red Cabbage
We really don't get much pigeon in America so I was excited to try it. While the flavors were good it was a little tough and a fair amount of effort to get the meat off the bone. The sauce was excellent and the cabbage went together very well.


Beef Mince on Dripping Toast
While this was definitely the ugliest dish of the night, it was one of the most flavorful. My cousin described it as ""the best bolognese"" he's ever had. While it's obviously not that, it did share many flavor profiles and was just straight-up delicious. The horseradish sauce was very strong and very good.


Sweetbreads, Bacon & Wild Garlic
I love sweetbreads, and St John kills it with them. They were good, but, to be totally honest, not as good as other sweetbreads I've had there. 


The Desserts:
People rarely talk about the desserts at St John but they're literally some of the best I've had anywhere. We orded a bunch was weren't disapointed.


Date Loaf & Butterscotch Sauce
I've had a version of this before, and it's one of my favorite desserts I've had anywhere. The great date flavor, the rich butterscotch sauce, and the whole thing are sweet as hell but pretty much perfect.


Burnt Cream
This was basically a creme brule which is really my thing. Having said that it was the best one I've ever had. Creme brule is one of my cousins favorite desserts and she said it was the best she's had.


Coffee Ice Cream
It was delicious, but it was late, and I only had a bite since any more would have kept me up all night.


Madeleines
This is their signature dessert and its excellent. It's the only place I've had them hot out of the oven and it brings it to another level. It’s a must order.",30,1744477545.0,finedining,10,0.97,False

I was first diagnosed with GERD five years ago. Over the years, I have seen two different gastroenterologists (GIs), who have prescribed various PPI drugs. My condition has worsened over the last six months, and my current GI has increased the dosage to 40 mg of Omeprazole twice a day. She wants to pursue maximum treatment to see if my GERD responds before considering other measures.

After taking 40 mg of Omeprazole twice a day for the past two months, I am still experiencing significant discomfort at night. My GI has now ordered two additional tests:

	1.	pH Impedance Testing

	2.	Esophageal Manometry Testing

I have always struggled with nighttime GERD. I go to bed fine around 10 PM each night, but a burning sensation in my esophagus and throat starts around 1 AM and persists throughout the night. I cannot sleep after this. Even though I am exhausted and tired, the GERD discomfort is so severe that it keeps me awake. I get up four or five times each night to take a sip of water to wash the acid down my esophagus. I also eat a spoonful of low-fat yogurt sometimes to push the acid down.

I have been sleeping in recliners and use a wedge pillow in my bed. Have made numerous lifestyle changes, such as eating smaller meals, avoiding food three to four hours before bedtime, and eliminating alcohol, coffee, tomatoes, fried foods, processed foods, and acidic foods from my diet. Now we are shopping for an adjustible bed to keep my head high up while sleeping 

Have any of you dealing with same symptoms that I am dealing with? Any thoughts on what I could to do get better? Thanks in advance.

I decided to use the Stardew valley cookbook, & make the chocolate cake from it.  

The recipe I feel like wasn't as descriptive as it could've been in some parts & my autistic self took one part literally that ended up in me completely ruining the cake & having to throw it out. Another part where I misread the recipe which also aidied in the cake being ruined. 

The recipe called for ""2 cups of coffee"" to enhance the chocolate flavor. I took that literally in baking terms as scooping 2 measuring cups of dry coffee & adding it to the butter mixture. It didn't seem quite right but I went along with it anyways. 

Then my mom comes into the kitchen & points out that she brewed a pot of the coffee for me to use in the cake. & Even tho looking back it does make way more sense to use liquid coffee, I had already committed to the mistake & mixed it into the batter. So into the oven it went. 

After about 20 minutes of the 2 layers baking I start to smell burning. I open the oven & see that one of the pans have completely overflowed into the oven. I reread the recipe & find out the recipe says ""scoop 4 cups of the batter into the large pan"" instead I poured the batter to the brim of both 8"" pans. This was just a total oversight by me I admit. But it's just really frustrating bc I always make mistakes like this when reading directions. 

So yeah. I just felt like I wanted to vent about this here as there may be someone that can relate or has had a similar experience. This whole experience was honestly soul crushing & my self esteem took a huge hit over it :/",9,1744477255.0,AutismInWomen,1,0.91,False

I work on a big printing machine and you can shut it down from literally 5 sides. At one point machine stoped and started beeping, i saw a shadow of someone going behind the machine i rushed to see who it is and saw no one. I thought it was me tripping.

I thought now that machine is off i would put some new paint in it. I put a bucket on a scale and left it there to pour the paint in.
When i did that i go to machine to see trending and write down when the machine stoped, it said 3:33:33 i was like okay whatever, didn't think about it that much, i went back to the dispenser to get the paint and the scale showed 3.333kg there i was feeling scared. 

Just to remind you 

It was 3rd of march (3.3.) 
Night shift (3rd in my country)
The time machine stoped was 3:33:33
The scale on a paint dispenser stoped at 3.333kg
I saw a shadow going behind the machine.

Later on my sister told me that there is a believe that at time the monsters and deamons are going out and that they are strongest at that time.
Has anyone else experience something like this


Maybe this does not sound that scary, English is my second language so i don't know hot to express that you can feel what i was feeling that night.

Hi everyone,

I’ve been sitting with a lot of feelings lately, and I feel ready to share. On Thursday (it’s Saturday today), my partner (we’ve been together since sixth form and have been in a long-term relationship - our first serious one for both of us) ended things, and I’ve been trying to process everything. I’m not here to try to win anyone back, but just to reflect and maybe get some outside perspective.

A bit of context: We’ve been together since sixth form, and despite the challenges of being in a long-distance relationship after we went to different universities, we’ve always stuck together. Our second anniversary just passed in Feb, and everything felt great - chocolates, flowers, and sweet cards exchanged on Valentine’s Day. Then, out of nowhere(a week or so after Valentines), she broke up with me, saying she’d been doubting things for a while and felt like the spark was gone. We took a short break, and she decided to break up for good. She then asked if I could visit her to discuss things in person. I visited her for a week(in her uni town), things seemed to be going well again, like old times we spent time together, cuddled, laughed, and even talked about future plans. But as we neared the end of my trip, she panicked, expressing doubt again. She said she didnt know what to do. A few hours later, while I was on the train back home (feeling very sad and confused) she said she wanted to try again.

I agreed to give things another try, and for a while, it really felt like we were in a better place. We spent a lot of quality time together, and I could feel the connection strengthening. We even exchanged heartfelt letters about how things felt like they were improving. Just last week, she came down to visit me at my uni place, and it was amazing. We spent two nights together - just the two of us and a friend who was staying there. We had so many great moments, cuddling, walking around together, having study dates, and just enjoying each other’s company. It felt right again, like we were in sync.

On the train ride back to our shared hometown (where our parents live), it was honestly one of the best parts of the trip - small moments, like her asking me to come sit next to her on the train, holding hands, and playful arm wrestling. Everything felt so normal and even a bit fun. But as soon as we arrived back in Leeds, things started to shift. We needed to go to each other’s parents’ houses, so we stopped for coffee, and when I walked her to her bus stop, she said she really wanted to see me again before she left for Edinburgh. She asked if I’d be able to meet her letter that week, an whether I’d be willing to come visit her the following Monday, which I said I would, and we continued texting about our plans - exploring her uni town, more study dates and intimacy.

Then, out of nowhere, the next morning she messaged me saying that the previous night, a few hours after she got home, she had a massive panic attack again, biting her nails off that she’d got done that week in distress. She said she was going to meet friends later and that everything would be okay, but from that moment, I felt like things shifted. By the end of the day, she messaged me, saying that we needed to talk about the relationship. I rushed to meet her, and When I did, she was in tears, telling me how much didn’t want to do what she was about to do, how she wished things had worked out but that the doubts were still there, and still felt like the spark was gone. She said she cared for me deeply and still valued everything we’d shared, and how grateful she was for us trying that last month, but she just didn’t know if she could keep going, for my sake, she didn’t want me to be with someone so unsure about her feelings, that couldn’t tell me she loved me due to the doubt, and that couldn’t see a future. She told me she didn’t want to lose me. And then, out of nowhere, she ended things. I was shocked and heartbroken, but I tried to be calm and understanding. I agreed to give her space, and after she walked me to the bus stop and I got home, i sent her a message about all the questions I had, but inside, I was left wondering: how could things feel so good just days before, and yet, everything fell apart so suddenly? I’m still waiting on a response, it was a really long and pretty deep message, so I’m giving her time.
 I just feel so confused, and while I’m sad, I’m not as sad as I thought I would be. I think this is because I’m waiting on the real closure, and m I’m scared it’s gonna hurt so bad.

Idk how to end this really, so I guess I’ll just end it here. I guess ib just feel betrayed, blindsided and completely lost and confused.

I was mostly anxious about having some kind of extreme negative reaction to the shot because I have had several bad reactions to other (unrelated) medications in the past that ended in trips to the ER. I am always nervous to take new medications and 99% of the time never end up taking a newly prescribed med due to the anxiety around it. 
I also have general anxiety, panic attacks and PTSD. I have managed to get away from every day meds/SSRI’s and now only take Ativan as needed (1-2x a month). I was anxious all week with the shots sitting in my fridge. 
My husband and I agreed to start this journey together. We both ate light, balanced meals all day and made sure to stay hydrated. We planned to take our shots at 830pm. I took .5 Ativan 30 minutes before, took 2 tums and prepped myself a cold drink and a hot ginger tea. We let the shots sit on the counter for an hour and when the time came we were both nervous. I didn’t think I would be nervous about the needle but I sure was! We both sat there nervously giggling and jittering for a good 15 minutes. He did his shot first and barely flinched. Then all the pressure was on me and I started having a small anxiety attack. I couldn’t get myself to do it. I called my friend and told her to give me some drama stories from work to distract me and told my husband to surprise me with the shot mid-story. He did. I’d say it hurt a little more than I was expecting but it was fine. It was a little after 9pm by the time I got my shot. We went up to bed to watch a movie afterwards and relax. My husband ate some yogurt and I wasn’t hungry (anxious). 
I was super nervous about side effects (valid and invalid ones lol) but here we are next day and I feel ok! I did wake up a few times during the night, got up twice to pee (usually 0-1x a night). Every time I woke up I had a slight headache like a mild hangover but not bad enough for me to get up for Tylenol. We are both usually very regular 💩 in the morning. I felt like I was gonna have the runs when I woke up but nothing happened. Same for my husband. I got up about 1.5 hours after him and when I got downstairs he hadn’t had a single cup of coffee yet which is very unusual for him. He’s usually downed a whole pot by then. He said he didn’t feel the craving for it. I think he ended up drinking 1.5 cups total this morning. He was a little groggy but otherwise fine. I skipped my coffee this morning, usually I’ll have one cup but I wasn’t in the mood for one today. We each had half of a protein shake early and we each ate a breakfast sandwich at 12. Overall, we both feel FINE!
One thing I have noticed, coming from someone with anxiety whose brain never shuts up for even half a second - my brain is quieter. It’s not silent but I’m able to pay more attention to sounds around me today instead of listening to constant babbling in my head. It is a nice feeling and one that I’ve only ever experienced one other time in my life on an anxiety med that didn’t work out for me. 
So, all in all, I’m glad I finally did the injection and got my first dose. The side effects have been very mild so far. I’m more confident in my ability to take my next dose next week. I’m so excited and relieved that none of my anxious fears came to life and I’m soo excited to be on this journey to become a healthier, happier version of myself!
So, if you’re anxious, it’s ok to be nervous. But coming from someone with anxiety whose brain extreme anxiety reaction to meds and shots, it was ok! Prep beforehand and have a distraction ready if you’re nervous about the needle. You can do this! ✌🏻🫶🏻

1jxlqtn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1jxlqtn/how_do_i_talk_to_my_husband_about_this/,How do I talk to my husband about this?,"My (F25) husband (M37) have been together for 5 years. Obviously things can change a lot in that time. I’m the last 2 years his main issues with me is that he says I can’t just say sorry without explaining myself after the fact, and that I am combative with him. 

My perspective is that the only times I get to explain myself after apologizing is when what I did came off the wrong way or he might have misinterpreted something I said or did and I don’t want him to truly believe that I meant it in that way. He says I should just say sorry and then say nothing else. 

He tells me that I can’t ever be wrong, and that I never take accountability but even his mom tells me that is not true because she’s seen or heard it.  
 
Do I think I can be combative sometimes…yes but here is why and you tell me if I’m wrong and I will believe and do my best to change myself….

In the start of our relationship/marriage He was a great leader. He made great decisions, he took care of me (and I him in return), he worked hard, but he didn’t neglect his part in the home either. Once our child came I started noticing subtle changes that I didn’t like. At the start we both would share the 4am feeding even after he went back to work…well that didn’t last long because soon I was the only one waking up to not only do 4am feeding but to soothe the baby at night as well. I brought it up multiple times and he would just say he has work in the morning and that he shouldn’t have to do it. He then would be upset with me that the house isn’t as tidy as he wanted it after knowing he’s the only that got any sleep in the house. Note that he did eventually come out with an apology for that. As our babe got closer to 1 she only wanted him to come in at night to soothe her so I figured hey I did my time now he’s doing his..even. 

Here’s where things take a turn. As the years go by the picture of my husband’s past with miss handling money starts to really come to light. I wanna start by saying he works blue collar. We are not well off, but we do okay when money is good. He goes out one day to get a consultation with I guess a cool new private physical therapist company that works for athletes and such for a business meeting. He comes home and tells me the meeting went well and that he decided to sign up for a membership. When I ask him how much it is he doesn’t tell me exactly how much it is he tells me it’s monthly. Naturally I have access to my husband’s email account meaning when he gets emails it notifies my phone. As he’s saying this we both hear my phone go off when I look down it’s an email receipt for just over $2,000 for the membership he just signed up for. He assured me that he didn’t know they would charge him full price for it and that it was genuine mistake. I looked in his eyes and I believed he thought it was monthly but I had an issue with him making such a big financial decision and mistake alone without looking at all the facts first.  After that came a body building competition, he had been training so hard for it and I was so happy to support his dream. I’m a little weary about how much it’s gonna cost us. He “gives” me the prices. Come to find out that every price he gave me was lower than how much everything actually cost with maybe the exception of the hotel cost. That whole thing cost easily upwards of $1,000 (keep in mind I didn’t find out the real cost till the next year). After that (I’d say we’re in 2-3 years in by now) we get a piece of paper in the mail explaining we owe $2,000 on one of his business accounts.. to top it all off…he hadn’t done his taxes since 2020. The blue collar job he works is a small business he owns. Ever since he started the business I’ve done most of the receptionists level work…until this point. I call around and get quotes for tax filing and of course the number is something we can’t afford to pay. I then have to take on 3 years years of back taxes BY MYSELF. The few times I asked for his help it was minimal and done reluctantly. 

**a little flash back** 
Also when we first brought our lo home we had just gotten a new car and needed new tires. We stopped out of no where one day, walked out with new tires that we had to pay off…which he was not making payments on and cost us in the end almost $2,000.. I believe it was $1,800..we are still paying that off now 

**okay back on track**
We get to a point where “we both can’t take it anymore” he says he doesn’t tell me the truth about the money because of one feeling bad but also because I “too intense” about our spending..the only reason I was like that was because of his spending. Mean while during all this time he’s miss handling our funds he’s telling me can I please stop buying snacks from the store because it’s costing us extra money yet he still gets to buy coffee and whatever else. Anyway he says if I’m tracking the money it’s too much and cause issues between us, he felt as the leader I was stepping on his toes. So I tell him that I absolutely hate the way he’s handling our money and that the secrecy has to stop and we need to come up with a plan. He promised that if I did this the transparency would be 100%. 

We’re gonna fast forward because there a lot. The transparency is there, he has been a lot more open and honest about the money. However the decision making is still lacking. We just moved across the country end of last year. He went on a big trip last year as we were packing and supposed to be saving for the move. The trip was pricey, anytime I questioned if it was a good idea money wise he would get so upset with me, as he usually does when I question how he’s spending money. He relied on a job he was planning on working when he got back to replace the money he spent…well the job fell through. As you can imagine we didn’t get that money and had to rely on back up money to get us through the move putting us in more debt. We had a full sit down conversation when we moved into our new place (where we stay with my dad and pay part of the rent and bills to save for our big move). He opened up to me about not being proud of where he is with his financial and business practices and wants to grow in those areas. We went over all of our money including our debts and came up with a plan to save and pay everything off. Well then he goes on another trip just a just 4 months after the move. He hasn’t fully landed any solid jobs yet at this point. By the time his trip was over and bills were paid we had $149 in the bank. Again not a good decision. Thankfully he started a new job so we got a bit of money from that to hold us over. All of this while telling me because I’m his work partner I’m responsible for the taxes and what not..just not how we spend the money I guess. Anytime I mention things we need for the house IN THE FUTURE that we can’t afford right now he asks me why I’m trying to keep spending money or reminds me why we can’t spend. We also had a conversation about him starting therapy for some of the issues we have..he told me this time he would get the help he needed..even turned down a steady job offer saying what he was doing now would give him more time to start therapy before his business picked back up…well now he’s starting a new job..business is starting and still has not gone to any therapy. 

So yeah I might be combative and now as I wake up in the morning I can admit that but ONLY because I don’t feel I can trust him to make good decisions as a leader and as a man. A man keeps his word. I don’t know how to bring this up to him. He says I always try to bring up deeper issues when we have a fight. I’ve just been quiet around him ever since. When I bring up issues we’re have he immediately gets defensive. I’m not sure I can even say anything at all. Any advice? 
I know this was long..sorry. ",1,1744476755.0,Marriage,9,1.0,False
1jxlqmv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/1jxlqmv/lather_log_march_2023/,Lather Log March 2023,"Welcome to your SOTD Lather Log for March 2025

* 2,097 shave reports from 134 distinct shavers during the month of March 2025 were analyzed to produce this report. Collectively, these shavers used 606 distinct soaps from 118 distinct brands.

## Observations

* March Madness certainly mixed things up this month. In a typical month, Barrister and Mann jockies with Stirling and House of Mammoth for the top spots, but this month House of Mammoth barely makes the top five and Stirling is pushed to sixth, while the fanboys (and maybe a few fangirls) push Catie's Bubbles to the top spot. Spearhead picks up the bronze. u/pridetwo's relentless cheerleading was enough to push Talent Soap Factory into the top five, but not enough to earn it a medal.

* Barrister and Mann and Stirling retain their typical top spots in the Brand Diversity contest, but Talent Soap Factory comes out of nowhere to grab third with a shocking 53 distinct soaps. I double and tripled checked the data to validate that count since 23 was the highest number of distinct scents they had ever previously recorded in a single month. I'm sitting here scratching my head wondering how an Etsy brand even has 53 distinct soaps.

## Notes & Caveats

* I only show the top n results per category to keep the tables readable and avoid max post length issues.

* The unique user column shows the number of different users who used a given brand/soap/etc in the month.

* The Brand Diversity table details the number of distinct soaps used during the month from that particular brand.

* The change Δ vs columns show how an item has moved up or down the rankings since that month. = means no change in position, up or down arrows indicate how many positions up or down the rankings an item has moved compared to that month. n/a means the item was not present in that month.

We have had this machine for a couple months now and LOVE IT! Makes great espresso. A huge step up from our Terra Kafe. That one was the biggest pain in the butt to clean!! Also the coffee taste in coffee is dramatically better with the KF6.
Unfortunately I woke up to the error message, NO BREWING UNIT this morning. I had taken the brew unit out yesterday to rinse and clean the area, I installed it back. I have taken it out a few times turned the machine on and off, but the same message keeps popping up. I'm now unplugging it for thirty minutes.Hoping that does something. anyone else experience this and have a solution?

1jxljof,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jxljof,Repair nightmare,"
We brought our 2024 Atlas in to a dealership in Minneapolis on Monday March 24th to fix an issue with the shifting mechanism/ transmission. Error message stated “Transmission Faulty” and the car would not come out of park. Eventually after several attempts to take the vehicle out of park and put it into drive the gears shifted and we were able to drive the vehicle into the dealership. They were gracious enough to see the car on short notice and to provide us with a loaner after it was determined that the shifting mechanism was faulty and they needed to order a part. We were trying to get back to Madison, WI which was home for us for scheduled appointments only to let us know we had to return the loaner and pick up our car when it was fixed within 24hrs of repair. The following Monday March 31st I received a call to say that the technician found a large amount of coffee spilled in the shifting mechanism and there was a smell of coffee and detergent which lead them to believe someone attempted to clean up the supposed spill. My husband and I have never had coffee in our new vehicle but rather we kept some chocolate covered coffee beans and vehicle detailing wipes in the console which may have contributed to the coffee and detergent smell. The tech sent us photos of what they said was the coffee found in the shifting mechanism. We were floored to hear this and extremely frustrated to hear that due to this discover the repair would not be covered by warranty. I worked with the dealership we purchased the vehicle from to determine if someone had spilled coffee in the vehicle before we took ownership, but that was inconclusive. The repair cost us $2,603.27. $2,099.28 of which was labor. The labor cost is exorbitant and unacceptable. The kicker is we shouldn’t have been in the hook for the repair at all as we didn’t cause the damage, however the burden of proof is on us and we haven’t been able to find out who damaged the vehicle at this point. Luther Burnsville’s diagnostic and repair costs were ridiculously high and we feel skeptical of their diagnostics as we were 4 hours from our car as they repaired it. The coffee spill was not discovered until a week after we dropped the vehicle off so I question the plausibility of the diagnosis when all we were provided with was two photos showing a brown liquid in a bucket and some drops of brown liquid on the underside of what appeared to be the shifting mechanism. The fact that we kept coffee beans and detailing wipes in the console make the technicians claims of an odor of coffee and detergent believable and call into question the probability of an accurate and truthful diagnosis. 

Further, I was told by the technician that they would fix the outstanding recall on the vehicle for the engine cover and when we received the vehicle the recall was not repaired. 

The sales manager who we bought the car from in Madison contacted the driver who delivers the vehicle to the dealership before we took ownership and he denied having spilled coffee in it and the dealership that had the vehicle before ours also denied having spilt anything in it. 

Feeling helpless. I worked with VW customer support who after two days just told me I could submit a complaint to the dealership we purchased the vehicle from. ",2,1744476230.0,VWatlas,6,1.0,False

1jxliuz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jxliuz,Review of my Recent decant haul and Purchases,"Reposting again as previous post was taken down was gonna post the reviews eventually but the mods were like “no shelfies” anyhoo these picks are based on the notes I like - Fruity - Citrus , bergamot , pineapple , Tobbaco , Vanilla , and gourmand notes. 

Turhati Blue - 
Opening: A bright hit of citrus that feels clean and sparkling right out from the start
Sillage: Pushes out solid projection for the first 1-2 hours—enough to turn heads without overwhelming the room 
Performance: Settles into a skin‑close musky‑woody trail and easily lasts 6–8 hours on skin will be Buying it

Liquid Brun - 
Opening: Kicks off with a warm hit of spicy cinnamon and creamy vanilla, underscored by a bright orangy note that gives it an nice gourmand feel 
Sillage: Projects strongly for about 2-3 hours—enough to announce itself without being harsh on the nose. 
Performance - Settles into a rich caramel-vanilla type base and easily lasts 8–12 hours on skin (and even longer on clothes), I’ll be getting the bottle soon. 

CDNIM EDP- Do I need to say anything ? 
Lives upto the Hype but for me I’ll pick SNOI collectors edition 

9PM - 
opening : starts with a bold mix of juicy plum and spicy cardamom that feels to me a nice gourmand right away  .
Sillage : Projects not heavily but I felt the presence sweet ambery for 1-2 hours 
Performance: Drifts into a warm, musky‑vanilla base and comfortably lasts 6-8hours on my skin. Getting 9PM rebel (100ml)

Vintage Radio - 
Opening :I love the fruity plum note with lavender at the start I can’t remember which soap it smells like 
Sillage : an hour or so but felt no one noticed compared to the ones I’ve mentioned above 
Performance : very intimate fragrance 4-6 hours on skin. 

Teriaq Intense - 
Performance:intense it is … smells  rich $ love the plum in this  , warm boozy (the expensive kind) not beardo boozy 
Sillage - Cozy 2-3 without being loud 
Performance : becomes a skin fragrance but still peaks out enough to know it’s there for 8-10 hours will be getting it for winters 

Neesh Haute Tobbaco - 
Opening : a very nice Tobbaco fragrance I got a headache because I sprayed it like how I spray my Zara Warm Tobbaco gave it a try next day with 4 sprays it’s called haute should be honey cuz that’s the loud note in it 
Sillage : offers a moderate trail for 2-3 hours in Hyderabad heat 
Definitely not a summer fragrance 
Performance : 8+ hours on this 

Kamrah Qawah - 
Opening : lives up to the hype A bold, aromatic kick of freshly brewed coffee and smoky cardamom, softened by a hint of caramel sweetness. Rich opening 
Sillage:leaves subtle yet inviting trail of coffee for sometime 
Performance : Stays 8+ hours comforting smell it’s not overpowering makes it great for 
nights. Will be buying in winters 

Lattafa Honour And Glory - 
Opening : Wow ! The fresh pineapple start mixed with a creamy butterscotch like ( crème brûlée like influencers describe it) the fruity freshness mellows down to one of my favorite gourmand fragrance 
Sillage - Good projection for the an hour not loudly you’ll be smelling like desert becomes a skin fragrance 
Performance : lasted about 6-8 hours on my skin felt good knowing it’s there Will be getting it soon. 

Hawas Ice : A strong icy/fresh citrus opening with apple and what felt like a spicy opening fills the room very synthetic 
Sillage - very strong projection for 2-3 hours very marine trail with musky scent 
Performance - 8-10 hours easily I didn’t apply much out of all the dragrance I mentioned this one was the favorite of my 15 year old nephew so describes the Fanbase of Hawas in a nutshell. I Will be getting Hawas Fire though. 

Lattafa Eclair - 
Opening : got this to try and will gift the bottle to someone 
From the start It’s a burst of Caramel and milk too sweet coming from a guy who likes gourmand fragrances but mellows down to a soothing sweet fragrance 
Sillage : Definitely a woman’s fragrance don’t overspray! Good projection for 1-2 hours. 
Performance :  Decent longevity 6-8

Now the bottles I got 

SNOI Collectors Edition : great premium packaging Opening : A clean Pineapple,Bergamot and Apple opening (felt CDNIM was bit spicy) SNOI avoids harsh synthetic opening 
Sillage -Definitely needs maceration but fills the room in the first few sprays noticeable Sillage for the first hour 
Performance - A nice dry down on it musky,woody and I felt a little creamy felt . Lasted on my skin for 6 + hours 

Kaaf - Wanted a Beast Mode fragrance and got one 
Opening - A strong Fresh burst smells synthetic I don’t get the watermelon notes yet more Aquatic notes Smells like body wash not in a bad way. 
Sillage : initially room filling that’s why 2-3 sprays are enough otherwise you have to wait for it to calm down or suffocate others 
2-3 hours of projection. 
Performance - easy 10+ hours great for a day out.

Mães pero ya es la gota que derramo el vaso con est gente 

Ya varios artículos me han salido defectuosos  como mencioné antes. Y si aun lo cubre la garantía duran un mes en darles las varas

Compre un scooter eléctrico hace un poco más de un mes y lo disfrute mientras pude. Pero le empeze a encontrar defectos en ese mes de comprado. El disco doblado, neumáticos gastados (para ser nuevo) y ahora  resulta que se barrio la pieza dnd va el seguro que sostiene la manivela así que no la puedo andar (casi me despicho en la calle) fui a, recupere la garantía y me dicen que por 5 días ya, se venció 

1. Como putas un scooter solo tiene un mes, de garantía y algunos coffee maker tienen 3 años 

2 como putas va a empezar a fallas un artículo en un mes de comprado (la pieza se barrio no hay nada que hacer) 

Posiblemente haya gente que compra ahí y las cosas le salen bien. Lo que quiero decir es, que comprar ahí tiene un muy alto porcentaje de que un artículo le  salga malo.

Mae legal no se embarquen cn esa gente porq tras de eso una ves ingresado su perfil a la base de datos de ellos. Lo empiezan a llamar una estupidez de veces al diia. 

Ojo, el descaro: me dicen que dentro de la garantía ellos llevan a reparar el scooter pero lo tengo que pagar yo (que clase de garantía de mier... es esa? ) 

Yo la verdad ya quede curado cn estos  ladrones de mierda y nadie me tiene de mamom comprando el scooter ahí ",11,1744476017.0,Ticos,7,1.0,False

Guy wants to talk dirty without any indication that we are going to in person. So I figured out the situation but decided to test it a little further, I suggested to my online guy to get into something with no strings attached. I got an answer right away and he was ready to set a meet date immediately to get the ball rolling, I asked him to slow it down a minute so we could at least have coffee first. So long story short he is still texting me every now and again waiting for me to make the first move for the coffee meet and I have already lost interest knowing that it’s only a hook up involved, eventually he’ll get the message. Being in a position to know what I truly deserve helps me to know that the choice is mine to make and I don’t have to choose a hook up over dating just to say I’m dating or have a relationship.",1,1744475970.0,MeLovingMyself,0,1.0,False
1jxlft6,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasyIX/comments/1jxlft6/more_unused_dialogs/,More unused dialogs,"Hello.

While I sorted the different dialogs of the game, I saw there were many Japanese lines that were never translated in english (even as dummied content) but still are insightful or impactful. I used to think non-translated Japanese lines were mostly debugging texts, but it is not the case.

Several of these dialogs refer to each other. Some of them are not very interesting for their content but rather in the sense that they give evidence of differences in gameplay or aborted mini-games. They are translated automatically from Japanese (except a few lines that are translated from German and Italian), so I'll give the Japanese dialogs in the comments as well, in case someone comes with better translations or point to an error in the interpretation.

Zidane “On the other hand, the energy generated by Mist is used to power airships...”

**Iifa Tree \[The light glowing in the depths of the earth\]**  
Zidane “It feels so full of life...”  
Vivi “When I stare at it, I feel a sense of nostalgia and I almost want to cry...”

**Iifa Tree \[Cheer up Vivi, Black Mages won't be angry at you\]**  
Huh?  
Eiko “You didn't like it the way they were created, did you?”  
Eiko “Then Vivi, you're the one who stopped that and you just need to find how they can be given birth naturally!”  
Eiko “If you do, I'm sure everyone will understand.”  
... Yes!

***Note***: *for some reason, the following alternative events in Madain Sari exist only in German (and Italian for the very last part when Amarant joins the team). There are many other clues in the game versions indicating that some people from the original development team were deeply involved in the international versions.*

**Madain Sari \[Lani and the Red-headed Man team together?\]**  
Lani “...Okay then, I'll show you my true power!”  
Lani “Hey, Red! Now is your turn!!”  
Eiko “...Did that old hag just say something about her true power and all?”  
Lani “So, master, now show us your skill! Take her apart!”  
Lani “Or maybe the cuties would rather give up? After all, you're dealing with the world's most wanted criminal!”  
Lani “Got it?! So, what will you do?”  
Zidane “Never seen that red-headed man before...”  
...  
Lani “Are you really one of the Tantalus gang? Are you sure you're not a moogle who accidentally wears his pom-pom on his butt?”  
Red-headed Man “Shut up!”  
Red-headed Man “I only let you go ahead of me to make sure...”  
Lani “What are you babbling about? The mission was given to both of us... We're partners!”  
Red-headed Man “You're incompetent. Even with a hostage, you failed... Hand over the treasure and then make a beeline for it.”  
*\[Later, to Zidane\]*  
Red-headed Man “If you want the village's treasure back, you'll have to fight with your life on the line...!”

**Madain Sari \[Those who are strong and those who are weak\]**  
Red-headed Man “A glorious victor always has certain qualities...”  
Red-headed Man “But I don't see any of those qualities in you!”  
Red-headed Man “And until I find them, I'll follow you...”  
!!?  
Red-headed Man “If you don't like it, then finish me at once!”  
Zidane “...On the condition that you leave my friends alone, you can come with me.”  
Red-headed Man “What do I care about your friends...”  
Red-headed Man “They're so frail that they'll die without me laying a hand on them.”  
I must have misheard!!  
Eiko “You think you're particularly strong, don't you?!”  
Red-headed Man “Your underlings don't seem to give much respect...”  
Zidane “They're not my underlings! They're my friends, remember that!”  
*\[Alternatively, from the Italian script\]*  
Red-headed Man “That's why I'll agree to come with you, at least for some time.”  
Red-headed Man “If I get bored and leave, it will mean that you've disappointed me.”  
Red-headed Man “I promise.”  
Red-headed Man “Because for me, going with you is equivalent to death.”

**Iifa Tree \[The party sees Kuja's Silverdragon arrival\]**  
Dagger “Zidane, I've already seen that dragon back in Alexandria!”

**Iifa Tree \[Confrontation with Kuja\]**  
Kuja “I am glad to see you again, my little bird. Meeting you under this distant sky reminds me how strong the bond known as fate is...”  
Vivi “Tell me! What is the lifespan of a black mage...”  
Kuja “Who knows? 1 year? If so, is there any way to avoid that fate? ...Is that what you want to know?”  
Kuja “How strange, I never thought that a black mage's soul would gain a heart...”  
Kuja “I also know about your kin entrenched in the forest, the lives forged by the hearts you gained in the face of death...”  
Kuja “Yes, your souls have a limit!! 1 year after they are created, black mages return to the earth!”  
Kuja “It truly is... the ultimate deception of a fleeting soul!!”  
Zidane “...Kuja, I now know for sure that you are our enemy!”  
Kuja “...Zidane, you demonstrated an incredible life force to escape from Cleyra.”  
Zidane “So much was lost in the war you started! Countless lives have been lost!”  
*\[The dialog would continue with “Spare me the lecture. Lives come and go all the time.” which is reply to Dagger in the version kept in the game\]*

**Mount Gulug \[Coldhearted thirst for power\]**  
Kuja “Hehehe, I can almost hear your body screaming...”  
Kuja “You probably don't have any strength left to resist, but you're pretty brave.”  
Kuja “Listen, I need strength.”  
Kuja “An absolute destructive power sleeps deep within you!!”  
Kuja “Well well, princess, you look tired... So let me guide you to the land of dreams!”  
Kuja “Yes, there it is! A stronger, more powerful soul!”  
Zidane “A powerful soul?”

**Mount Gulug \[Scheduled mortality\]**  
Vivi “It was planned like that from the beginning, even before we're born. There's no way to change it afterwards.”  
Vivi “It would have required to be changed before our birth...”  
Vivi “We... we were all deceived by Kuja.”

1jxlece,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1jxlece/suggestions_for_our_may_itinerary/,Suggestions for our May itinerary?,"Our trip is about month out and I want to make sure we are getting a good representation of your great city.  I’ve been through a few times but wanted to finally really check it out.  Any feedback you have would be much appreciated!  

Thoughts on travel and specific questions are in **bold**.  Generally we would walk anything around a mile particularly after some of these large meals but we don’t want to wander into any areas we shouldn’t either.  One thing we are missing is some live music so I’m particularly open to suggestions on places to go Sat and/or Sun evening.  

Thanks in advance!  

———————

Day 1 - Travel (Thu)  
- By the time we check into the Palmer House not sure we will feel like doing much so might just hang out at the hotel and have a few drinks, perhaps try one of their famous brownies!  

———————

Day 2 (Fri)  
- Grab breakfast togo from Egg Tuck.  
- CAC River Tour on the First Lady.  
- Lunch at the Purple Pig.  
- Spend the afternoon walking around the Magnificent Mile. 
- We have dinner booked at Indienne, but hoping to switch that to Maxwell’s Trading when it becomes available.  
- Time permitting grab drinks at the Old Town Alehouse.  
- Catch a show at Second City.  

**I debated a few different places for lunch including Avec, but some of them scale back their menu for lunch service and Purple Pig is right there between the tour and Mag Mile so fits our agenda.  There anything we should consider instead?**  

**Anything specific to check out while we are walking around Mag Mile?  It’s unlikely we do much shopping, more looking around.  Spouse wants to hit up the Starbucks and said maybe check out the new Harry Potter Store.**  

**Unfortunately it does not look like there is a straight shot to Maxwell’s Trading so guess we will call a car?  Then likely taking another car to Second City and then another back to the hotel.  I did see the brown line is considered the “best line” but I’m guessing we do not want to take that at midnight?**  

———————

Day 3 (Sat)  
- Brunch at Apolonia.  
- See as much of the Art Institute as we can.  
- Time permitting wander around Millennium Park.  
- Dinner at the Omakase Room at Sushi-San.  

**Looks like the green line should make to/from Apolonia easy.  Thinking spend the full day at the Art Institute then call a car to dinner since we booked the 5:30 sitting.**  

**Any suggestions for live music Sat night?  Unfortunately no specific show has jumped out at us so might just pick a place and check out whatever they have.**  

———————

Day 3 (Sun)  
- Grab some coffee from necessary & sufficient.  
- Grab lunch from Ricobene’s.  
- Catch a White Sox game.  
- Dinner at The Duck Inn.  

**The red line looks like it might work here, but again it doesn’t seem like a straight shot.  Should we just call a car?  After lunch it’s not much difference between Ricobene’s to the red line or Rate Field so not sure if we should call another car or walk?  Definitely taking a car from Rate Field to The Duck Inn.**  

**Open to catching some live music particularly if we didn’t see anything on Sat.**  

———————

Day 4 (Mon)  
- Small breakfast from Stan’s Donuts.  
- Grab lunch from Pequod’s.  
- Catch a Cubs game.  
- Wander around Lincoln Park.  
- Dinner at Alinea.  

**Brown line to Pequod’s looks easy, then thinking red line to Wrigley should be fine right?**  

**Our Alinea reservation is 9 pm so we have a good bit of time to kill.  I was thinking about hanging out in Lincoln Park but any other recs?  If we do go to Lincoln Park, looks like we could take the red line then walk or should we just call a car?  Besides the zoo which we aren’t too interested in if you could only do one thing in the park what would it be?**  

———————

Day 5 (Tue)  
- Breakfast at Manny’s.  
- Thinking see as much of MSI as we can, but open to other ideas.  
- Wander around Hyde Park.  
- Dinner at Virtue.  

**Looks like the blue line to Manny’s should be easy enough, but MSI is a trek.  Would we feel like we missed out if we skip MSI, do the Field museum and spend Wed doing something else?  Or keep Field Museum on Wed and do something different Tue?  Between the Field and MSI I do think we would rather do the Field but open to feedback.  We want to keep our Virtue reservation and wander around Hyde Park a bit regardless.**  

———————

Day 6 (Wed)  
- Small breakfast at Cafecito.  
- Walk a bit of the Lakfront Trail looping back to lunch.  
- Lunch at the Berghoff.  
- Thinking see as much of the Field Museum as we can, but open to other ideas.  
- Dinner at Carino.  

**If we do the Field Museum on Tue then this day is open expect for dinner (we did want to try Berghoff to though).  Any suggestions for the day?**  

**If we stick with the plan then red line from lunch to the Field museum seems fine.  Probably just get a car to dinner and then another back to the hotel.**  

———————

Day 7 (Thu)  
- Breakfast at Pittsfield Cafe.  
- Head back to Midway and on to the next stop.

Shin’ichi lies in bed trying to fight off his illness while the delegation attends the inaugural Seattle discussion meeting. Unfortunately, the meeting lacks the same vivaciousness as the meetings led by Shin’ichi. “Why is that?” one of the leaders asked him when he returned to the hotel.

>“I’m not doing anything special. I just always exert myself with the burning resolve that ‘I must not let any of the precious children of of the Buddha become unhappy’ and a keen awareness that ‘now is my only chance to lead these people to happiness.’ This unwavering determination is the power that opens people’s hearts. 

>“A mother who loves her children and thinks constantly of their welfare knows what they want merely from their cries. Children, too, feel content and reassured when they hear their mother’s voice. Similarly, a leader who has a strong determination to cherish the members can understand their worries and desires, and the members will in turn respond to such a leader. 

>“Leaders must also carefully consider what they are going to speak about, and how to present it, so that the members will readily understand and accept what they have to say. It is important to continue making such efforts. When I have a meeting to attend, I always make sure that I am thoroughly prepared. I rack my brains and try to come up with creative ideas.

>“This is a leader’s duty. If a leader just talks about the same old thing and never offers anything fresh or new, it is discourteous to the listeners. It is a sign of an irresponsible leader who has fallen into force of habit.”

I have had many conversations with Bernie who keeps poking fun at my “woodenness” and “lack of authenticity.” It's OK, I know she is on my side and has the best interests of me and the children in her heart.

I found the above passages very helpful. I have to admit I was looking for techniques and thunderbolts from above. No! I have to rely on my deep caring, awareness that every moment counts, and meticulous preparations. In fact, that is what I have been using throughout my teaching and supervisory career. Why should I do anything different?

I had an opportunity to try this approach out, once again, early in the morning. Julie and I went over to our future student Lori’s house. Julie had, from what I gather, a very heartfelt conversation with the mother. They worked out all of the “Full Disclosure” items that the mother should know for her to have confidence in the afterschool plan we are working out. 

While they were talking, the father and I went out for coffee. We know each other pretty well from our VA group But there was still a lot to share about the school and about me as Lori’s future teacher. Now was I going to put on a well-rehearsed show or would I be open and keen to listen?

I decided I would listen very carefully and respond as an open book. At first he asked prefunctory questions like “tell me about your teaching background,” “what will your curriculum be?” and “how does this tie into indigenous culture?” Fine, and I answered. But this was already in our promotional flyer and elevator pitches.

Then we went into the important stuff. He talked about growing up as a “rez kid,” I about growing up on the wrong side of the tracks. We both had experienced significant trauma in our childhood, magnified by our Army experiences. And how would Longhouse Elem wash away the scars of generational trauma? Here we were talking as equals and, I invited him to continue the dialogue. I think he would also be an excellent candidate for the Board but, of course, that is not a decision I can make by myself.

Today Julie and Lori’s mom will go ice-skating with the Twinettes and Lori. Let’s see how that goes. Maybe the afternoon will carry over to dinner at our place. We’ll see!

Coming out of my teens now I really start to appreciate the flavor of coffee and after having tasted some really good cappuccino would like to start trying it out myself. My parents are liking this idea aswell and I have been blessed to have been given a budget of around $1200 by my dad to get a good espresso machine setup.

We are a 3 people household and drink a total of around 7 cups a day. Mostly cappuccino, from a DeLonghi fully automated cappucino machine with supermarket beans. We however would love to step up our game by a lot.  
I was researching a lot and came across a lot of machines. However it feels like every machine seems to suck at one point or another and I feel hesitant to just pay 600€ for a machine that might be disappointing to my parents, ( we are currently already using a coffee machine ).

My pick would have been the Silvia V6. I come from Germany and can get it for 600€ leaving me around 600€ for Grinder and tools. However I have heard people complain about the not integrated PID. I would mod it but since it voids warranty and it is not my own machine I can't do that unfortunately.

I think it's important that we can taste where the money went, and not spent 1200 dollars on just a slight improvement. What do you guys think? What kind of machine and grinder combo delivers the most? There is so many.   
Profitec GO sounds good but then I would only have around 200€ for a Grinder. Rancilio Silvia looks good but PID is not an option. ",1,1744475382.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

I have some weekly exercise goals that I'm struggling to be consistent with and also looking to make new connections/friends since working from home more. So I thought a WhatsApp accountability group would be the perfect thing to set up! 

My thinking is that we all share what our weekly goals are (mine are below) and then we have to upload photos (don't have to show your face!) to ""prove"" we have done them. At the end of the week, you then ""unlock"" a reward or a treat and share that with the group too - that might be buying a new outfit, having coffee and cake, or taking yourself to the cinema. 

The group would then be filled with positive images and messages and just feel really good to be a part of! 

My goals are below and it would be great to have someone else join me with them, but everyone can choose their own weekly goals: 

* 8k steps per day 
* 2 runs per week 
* 2 strength sessions per week 
* 2 yoga sessions per week 

If anyone is interested in joining please let me know, either by commenting below or messaging me. I'm also open to any further ideas people have. 

I think one day the above could be an amazing app filled with different sub-communities who want to adopt the same goals/habits, so if anyone wants to work with me to make that happen let me know haha!! ",1,1744474905.0,accountability,0,1.0,False

Only reason I had to retire it was someone else broke the pot. I did keep using it without the pot for a few weeks while searching, just removed the drip stopper.

95% of the time I just drink regular Walmart coffee from the big tub (cheaper than Folgers) and it's fine for me. Occasionally I'll get better whole beans for the weekend but I can't be bothered with that on the daily.

Paid $174 for the moccamaster used, so it'll have to last me 145 years to get the same value. 

And I think the Walmart coffee actually tastes slightly worse from the moccamaster. Have yet to get some nice beans to try. Not completely convinced it was worth it, but I feel cool having it on my counter when guests notice it.",50,1744474704.0,BuyItForLife,16,0.86,False

It'll become apparent how new I am the more you read, I think.

I had made some lazy ACV where I essentially threw a bunch of apple discards bits into filtered water and maybe splashed a little ACV in it and tapped a coffee filter to the top. 

Anyway, that was an amazing process and the outcome was delightful and I didn't die. I lost the recipe and tried to recreate it but just throwing some more apple trash and water into the leftover ACV, but this time I boiled some honey in water and added that.

Here I am a month later with this goop. I did concoct a device that let it breathe but it also kept the fruit down below the surface. It doesn't look like the mold I've seen in other botched ferments and the whole thing smells yeasty, fermenty, and delicious like a good apple ale or a French cider.

So... Could you please help me identify what it is and possible next steps?

My gut says it's fine to strain and go about the business of a Saturday afternoon, and I'd hate to be wrong about its safety and I'd also hate to lose any biomatter that could be useful for further ferments.
