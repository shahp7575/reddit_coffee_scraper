1i8yy6t,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i8yy6t,Project 2020 - Mike Trout Collection,"My father is a huge Mike Trout fan, and has basically followed his career since he was playing in high school (We‚Äôre from South Jersey, so stories mentioning him would be in the local papers from time to time).  So back in 2020, I started ordering a few of each of the Trout cards from the Topps website whenever they were released for Project 2020.  I purchased the #4 card as my first eBay purchase ever, because I had this grand idea planned in my mind, and I thought that having the first card in the set as an artist-signed piece would raise this whole idea to the next level.  Then, I lucked out and received a refractor version of the #400 card, which was the last one in the set.  Over several months, I worked with a local professional frame shop to get this just right, museum glass and all, and was able to give this to my father in July 2021.  I really enjoy this Community, and I‚Äôve seen a lot of people sharing cards and other items that they cherish most.  It gave me the thought to share mine with everyone, too.  My Dad‚Äôs up there in age these days, and it makes me happy to think of him being able to look at this every day while he sits in his recliner and drinks his coffee all day long.  I hope you all enjoy it, as well, and maybe have some ideas of your own sparked while checking this out.",1,1737735030.0,baseballcards,0,1.0,False

1i8yx0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1i8yx0r/tattling_is_no_fun_for_anyone/,Tattling is no fun for anyone,"Yesterday, my boyfriend (dating for 1.5 years) and I went out for a short coffee date. We shared a long kiss in the car before he drove me home, like we always do (nothing extreme or intense, just a sweet, slow, kiss). We are consenting adults, by the way. This will be relevant soon. 

Apparently, one of his mom‚Äôs friends saw us. No biggie, if you happen to see a couple kissing in their car, as long as no one‚Äôs getting hurt, impregnated, or violated, just turn around and move on, right? APPARENTLY NOT. She called his mom. Yeah. She called his mom to tell her we were ‚Äúintensely making out.‚Äù Mind you, both my boyfriend and I are ADULTS. I am now extremely ticked, embarrassed, and grossed out.

To add insult to injury, his parents are the judgmental type. I, as their son‚Äôs girlfriend, fall under the harshest scrutiny. Now I am pretty sure they see me as some wh‚Ä¢re who has no respect for their son.I just don‚Äôt know if I can handle having in-laws like this. Imagine the judgement I‚Äôll have heaped on me if I make a mistake while raising my kids?? Golly. Anyways enjoy. I will try my best to find out who tattled so I can avoid her like the plague :)",1,1737734953.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

1i8yvti,https://www.reddit.com/r/wisdomteeth/comments/1i8yvti/8_days_post_op_here_are_my_tips_and_what_i/,"8 days post op, here are my tips and what I personally did","Thursday jan 16th I had all 4 wisdom teeth removed, under anesthesia. They gave me laughing gas as they were putting the IV in and the last thing i remember is them making me bite down on something. Waking up all I remember is getting help walking to the car. 

Getting home I immediately switched gauze and switched them out every 20 mins. When the blood was pinkish, I used the black tea bag method and I didn‚Äôt bleed at all after that. Took my pills, and fell asleep. When I woke up my mouth was no longer numb. I could not sleep that night, guessing from the anesthesia. 

I had 0 pain, only discomfort and soreness. I consistently took my meds every 4 hours (ibuprofen and tylenol). Salt water rinses. Iced as much as I could, and drank broth and ate ice cream. If you are a smoker, get yourself some patches. 

Days 1-3 were the worst of it for me. I basically only had liquids. Took baths. Lounged around. By day three I was able to eat noodles by ‚Äúchewing‚Äù with my tongue. I didn‚Äôt brush my teeth until day 4. I cleaned my tongue a lot before brushing the first time. It gets gross!!! 

Days 4 I was able to eat noodles comfortably, tomato soup, soggy pancakes, and scrambled eggs. Day 5 i started using heat instead of icing. 

Day 6 life was getting better. I had 0 pain still. Keep taking your meds!!! This was the first day I left the house and got an iced coffee. Still eating carefully. Ate oatmeal and eggs for breakfast. 

Day 7 I started vaping again. This is all up to your pain level, if it doesn‚Äôt feel right don‚Äôt do it. I also started irrigating this day. I feel great just weird that there are holes in my mouth. Still taking ibuprofen when I feel that I need it. 

I also didn‚Äôt poop for 4 days, lol. Get some fiber in you! Be consistent with your meds. Set alarms. Ice yourself good. If you are a weed smoker, get yourself some thc drinks it helped a lot too. Also want to add, i had a week off of work. It really helped me take care of myself having nothing else to worry about. 

I hope maybe this helps somebody, again this is just my experience and what I personally did. Ask your dentist questions!!!! On day 8 i feel amazing. ",1,1737734874.0,wisdomteeth,0,1.0,False

1i8yte4,https://www.reddit.com/r/emetophobia/comments/1i8yte4/rant_about_normal_people/,Rant About 'Normal' People,"TW for mention but nobody gets sick in this story!

I saw someone else recently post that it's insane we are considered freaks for not wanting to be sick when other people are the sick and gross ones.. and I have been thinking about that. 

Today I accompanied my wife to the DMV. I of course get nervous in crowded places, but I tried to calm down and think rationally: Who is getting sick in the DMV? I actually relaxed! #win.

A man and his boyfriend are standing in line for the clerk, near where I am sitting. I am not really noticing their conversation. One man squats down to fix his shoe or something. But he stays there.... ok odd but people are odd! I hear his boyfriend say ""Well if you're gonna tu\* then you'll feel better after"" just calm as if he was talking about getting coffee after.

WHAT!!!!! I grabbed my stuff and told my wife I'd meet her outside. I think I actually ran down the block. I was so scared but nothing actually happened. BUT WHAT ON EARTH! WHO GOES TO THE DMV WHEN THEY'RE SICK! WHO TALKS ABOUT IT SO CASUALLY IN PUBLIC! THAT'S INSANE FREAKAZOID BEHAVIOR! 

My (non-phobic) wife agrees that is insane behavior but also thinks I overreact and ruminate too much (I have OCD). I don't know how to not worry everywhere we go when sick people seem to wake up and decide they need to go on a quest. You are not a hobbit you are sick. Stay home. If you feel sick suddenly, LEAVE!!!??? I have IBS and if my belly hurts I simply go home. Normal behavior. 

Why am I expected to shell out money for therapy when staying home is free. I just feel like the normal one in this scenario and it makes me so angry that I have to live in fear because other people can't control themselves. 

Sorry for ranting, I hope this story doesn't make anyone anxious but it ruined my entire day. ",2,1737734705.0,emetophobia,1,1.0,False

*Vilantian-Hurdop Trade Cooperative offices*

Undersecretary Ah'nuriel was having a very odd day. Of course, odd days were becoming almost normal of late. Her husband had sent her a long message detailing how much he missed her scent. She'd gotten fairly good at guessing what wasn't being said over the past few years. Messages with hidden meaning were only meaningful if you knew how to read them. And what was being said was difficult - most of their contracted work was going to the Sword of the Light Gods, however the Terrans were beginning to hire companies of their own accord. That was the reason for the meeting today. A Terran who appeared to be wearing subtle joint braces underneath a very oddly fashioned suit - it covered the entirety of his body, with a few cloth decorations. The entire thing was black save for a white shirt. His sunglasses were unusual, and not just because he only had two eyes. They were square and very dark, making his entire hatchet-looking furless face somehow more off-putting. Old instincts were warning her that this Terran brought danger to her door.

The undersecretary took a breath, remembering that somehow this species was a formidable one ‚Äì and one of her tasks was to find out why. Still, the Terran was polite enough and allowed himself to be sniffed first. His scent was cloying, and almost resembled a Minister's in some ways ‚Äì there was an honest deception to him, as if he expected things to be withheld.

She took a breath, considering her first move. ""So how can the Trade Cooperative assist you today...""

The man smiled easily. ""Smith will suffice. Agent Smith, representing Skunkworks Insurance. We'd like to investigate an opportunity for trade. If you're not familiar with us, our business is risk assessment at the core. We assess risk and set a price on assuming a worst-case scenario for that risk. In dangerous times we may refuse to business in an area entirely. But now with the peace accords, the risk is substantially lower. We'd like some assistance from the Trade Cooperative.""

And there was the deception wrapped in a smooth voice. Or at least the first one. Their business wasn't entirely risk assessment, but something else. The undersecretary kept her fur low with an effort. ""Well, our business is the trade of goods, so there may be areas of overlap. But I'm not certain what more we could commit to without specifics.""

""Well, multiple Terran companies have expressed interest in forming permanent partnerships here and paying well for their partnership. Worlds like yours and Hurdop Prime are rare ‚Äì high gravity, atmosphere conducive to our life forms, and land that's good for many crops. Not Terran, of course; your gravity would kill most of our plant life. But, as a manufacturing center, many things that you can make here are far more expensive to make on other worlds. In addition, there are Terrans who would come here to train physically - athletes training their muscles in higher gravity would make exceptional leaps over those that don't. In return, economic prosperity and perhaps unique items of our own that can withstand this environment. We'd like assurances that this peace is a binding one, and that honoring our contracts won't leave us at a loss.""

Ah'nuriel cocked her head slightly. ""Perhaps that is a question better answered by the Minister of Foreign Affairs.""

""Come now, Undersecretary. A meeting with the Foreign Affairs department would leave me with bland reassurance no matter the truth in addition to my already aching knees. I seek the honesty that only comes from a balance sheet. In addition, I understand that you have something of a personal stake in continued peace.""

Her fur flared almost of its own volition. ""That information is...accurate. But not quite relevant.""

""On this, we must agree to disagree - risk assessment requires accurate information, and a great deal of detail. With that said, here is some information that I have from Terran companies."" Agent Smith slid a small datapad over. ""Those are the companies willing to invest, and the amounts they are willing to pay at this time. They are substantial, and with assurances of security could grow. Which would mean the amounts they pay us would grow, and everyone goes home happy. Of course I would ensure my superiors knew your name in my reports. So, information for information. There's no reason to say yes or no right now - my superiors are arranging a conference at our offices in New Casablanca in a few months, and we are making an attendee list right now. Purely speculative for the moment, but I'm sure if I polled your co-workers right now there would be several interested parties. With the right voices in the right ears, a great deal can change. A captain could have a name, for example.""

Ah'nuriel nodded reluctant agreement. ""Information for information, then.""

*Homeplate*

Gryzzk's life had never been so busy. There had been a few days of respite as his ship and crew had celebrated and enjoyed a fine night at Sparrows, and then began the process of correcting and implementing new things that their victory had allowed the company to purchase. Inertial dampeners, a secondary shielding system, some additional systems for weapons, new paint, and what may have been most important, a new coffee maker for Engineering. For himself and the bridge team, however, it meant exceptionally long days in a command simulator, where they'd been run through multiple engagements and tactical sequences. After each engagement, the proctors from the 7th would go over everyone's errors in excruciating detail. The proctors were dark magicians at finding errors - even when they'd run through simulated exercises perfectly, there was still a detail that had been overlooked, a way it could have been done better. He'd lost the entire ship on several occasions, which unnerved him as the proctors went over every failing he'd had during those engagements. It was disheartening until O'Brien had finally told the proctors to give them the room. In the conference room over tea, coffee, and foul language they finally were able to gain a sense of what was happening; each simulation was meant to test a specific aspect of their skills, and in the portions they were looking at, Gryzzk and the rest of the crew had performed admirably. Within the rest of it was dressing for them to find mistakes and play headgames - O'Brien pointed out two specific instances where Gryzzk had done something, been called out for it, and then did as they suggested and still merited a chewing out. Things seemed to go better somehow after that, with them acting and reacting to things with a bit less tension.

All of that meant precious little time with his wife and children. He'd had a chance to watch the news a bit more, and it seemed as if every day there was something new that made him feel as if his company was falling behind on a tally sheet that existed only in his mind. Even the Swords of the Light Gods had taken on a successful job ‚Äì a passenger escort run between New Casablanca and Vilantia. It nagged at him until after three weeks he sent a terse voice message to the Major advising that he was going to stand the company down for a week to assess their next steps prior to their next job.

The reply message was a soft chuckle and a ""Your company, your rules.""

His delivery of the news at the morning briefing was met with relief and cheers from the crew. As much as they would have kept going for a few more weeks if he'd asked, Gryzzk had observed the Terrans observed that they seemed to believe the time for family and new friends was important ‚Äì perhaps that was one of their secrets.

They finished up the day's work and Gryzzk found himself on the couch at the end of the day as the children all took spots, with Nhoot staying close to Gryzzk and Gro'zel staying closer to her mother, while the twins took their place in the middle of all of them. Gryzzk frowned a bit as the mercenary news of the day was a re-enactment of the Sword's second engagement - a battle against a Throne's Fortune base which left Gryzzk talking to the wallscreen - only to have his opinions confirmed by the commentators. The Swords seemed to be taking every opportunity to simply overwhelm with force and then destroy even when it would have been more profitable to disable and take the ships whole; particularly since the Hurdop government had formally disavowed the Throne's Fortune as a renegade element and confirmed that there would be a bounty paid for proof in the form of letters of marque.

One of commentators was blunt. ""It's like they're a bully who got beaten and tries to prove they aren't weak by picking on the ones they know don't have a shot. If this is an advert for their skills, I dunno who's buying...""

The one bonus of the arrival of the Swords was that more Vilantian shows were available; the family sat and watched a few classic comedy shows and smiled appropriately, but something seemed off about them. Perhaps it was the time, but the jokes didn't make either of them laugh like they used to.

Still, they went to bed and the next day they took one of the shuttles to New Casablanca. Not the bar district, but the more family-friendly shopping district, filled with temporary stalls dotting the more permanent structures where a dazzling array of goods from Terra could be purchased. While Gryzzk only kept his rank tab on himself for emergency communications, the girls had refused to leave until their purple berets were on their head with their rank proudly placed. Grezzk took the lead, finding a small area of shops that had started to stock items from the Vilantian homeworld. Grezzk took the opportunity to pay a shameful price for some foodstuffs and a few small items that reminded them of home.

Once outside, several Vilantians were waiting, their scent an undisguised disgust. They wore the gold and black uniforms of the Swords company with ranks that designated them as senior staff ‚Äì all in all this did not bode well.

""Nameless captain, step forth. We do not wish to harm you. We bear a message from the Minister of War.""

Gryzzk closed one pair of his eyes for a moment. ""I recall Commodore A'Drapir's message quite well, friends - may the dead gods treat him well.""

""I do not recall Commodore A'Drapir being named Minister of War. The Minister himself has an offer. He sees that you have become something unexpected; and with that he offers his voice in Restoration and a role within the Swords of the Light Gods. Your own ship, your own crew consisting of the finest Vilantians from Clan Aa'Porti. Picked soldiers to do your bidding ‚Äì if you do his bidding. The Clan Way calls to you. Your Great Lord calls to you. The Minister would have your voice in the future of Vilantia. Answer yes with your full voice, and all this-"" there was a vague gesture to their surroundings ""-can be a forgotten memory.""

There was a pause ""What future would that be?""

""A future where the Clan Way is made truth and the worlds of this sector are held to it.""

Gryzzk closed his remaining eyes, knowing that what he was going to say would probably condemn him in the eyes of at least three Ministers. ""Not long ago, the Clan Way was the only way I knew. But there is a better way. Clans built not by a birth more than thirty generations past, but choice. My clan is young, built on those the Clan Way would have us cast aside, ignore, and condemn. If we win victory, we learn. If we are defeated, we do not pretend it didn't happen. This offer would have suited me once. But it does not suit me now. When I walk from the twilight, it will be on my own feet with a clan of Vilantians, Hurdop, and Terrans at my side.""

The disgust and fury in their scent made the girls recoil behind Grezzk, and finally one of them spat at the ground. ""None who dwell in the twilight may pass judgment on those in the light. Minister Aa'tebul will lend his voice to more worthy causes. We will not fight this day."" So saying, they spun and walked away with precision.

Grezzk swallowed, and both Gro'zel and Nhoot came out from behind Grezzk. Grezzk had a slight smirk on her face.

""Lord A'Gryzzk, we must make another child soon."" She leaned into him warmly for a moment before they began walking to the shuttle with their purchases.

""I'm no lord. I just do what's best for my family and those under my command.""

""And those under your command would call you a Lord.""

""You realize that would make you a Lady, correct?""

""It would ‚Äì but only because you shine so brightly.""

Gryzzk shook his head. ""I don't like it. A Lord is born a Lord, and I was not born such."" Still, there was anxiety. He'd effectively become a lord by the acclaim of those he commanded, and even prior to that with managing Lord A'kifab's household. But to become a lord seemed almost insulting in some way.

There was a bit of consideration and silence before Gryzzk caught a familiar scent and turned to call out. ""Edwards?""

Edwards stepped from around a market stall ‚Äì she was wearing a set of hooded grey robes that covered her almost head to toe. She looked a bit embarrassed, but smiled. ""Gonna have to wear perfume next time. Ugh.""

""Why?""

""Hiding my scent, obviously."" She shrugged. ""So what'd those bumblebees want?""

""They wanted me to come work for them.""

Edwards blinked. ""Oh. You, ah, thinkin' about it?""

Gryzzk shook his head. ""No. I have a clan already, as you recall.""

Edwards seemed relieved. ""Okay, cool. Yeah, that must have been hard.""

""Not as much as I thought it would. I have something meaningful here, and we have agreed to things. Together. They did not wish to include anyone else. But we have a conundrum of sorts."" Gryzzk paused to consider how to couch the question. ""Titles are important to us. Lead Servant, Lord, Greatlord, things like that. Does Terran or Hurdop culture have a title that fits this situation that we're in?""

Edwards chuffed softly. ""Whatcha mean?""

""Well essentially a commoner in what is traditionally a noble position.""

""Oh yeah, your captains are...but not really for the Hurdop...sorta."" Edwards' eyes unfocused as she seemed to be reading a tablet from her memory and she started thinking out loud. ""But...Samoan - Matai, no. Feudal Japan - Jizamurai, maybe but we'll keep going...Nordic - Jarl - nah too close to earl they'd call me out for playing too much Skyrim again..."" Finally she snapped back to reality. ""I'll have to think about it. I'll talk to Engineering but we might just need to invent a new word for you, Cap.""

""Indeed. If it comes to that let me know. Now, to the other question I have ‚Äì why were you following me?""

Edwards looked like a child about to get disciplined for marking the walls. ""Well, respectfully Cap, you've made some enemies. Bad Moon's put money on the board for an asskicking with you as the recipient, and few of the Swords were making noises about bringing you into the light according to Reilly.""

""How does Reilly know?""

""She bought 'em a couple drinks. Apparently we all look alike to you.""

""Remind me to compensate her.""

""She said she'll trade the drinks for a refresh on her roots from Mama Grezzk."" Edwards smirked a little.

Grezzk seemed taken aback slightly. ""Mama?""

There was a nod. ""Mmm-hm. On the ship Nhoot calls him Captain Papa, so Mama just kinda grew out of that.""

Grezzk's fur flickered. ""I. I hadn't considered that. Of course, we'll be here whenever she wishes."" She paused for a moment. ""Let her know that tonight we're having a garlic chicken recipe for dinner.""

They shuttled back to the company area and split off; Edwards heading to her room in the barracks and Gryzzk leading his family to their quarters. Gryzzk settled in on the couch with the boys and checked his tablet while the girls ran to their room to play with their new toys. Grezzk began marinating the chicken and preparing the rice before settling in on the couch.

""You don't like the idea of being a Lord, do you?""

Gryzzk shook his head. ""It feels wrong, somehow.""

She leaned into him gently. ""Whatever they call you, you will always be my handsome hand.""

For a long moment, there was a bubble of peace as the universe shrank to a small officer's quarters with girls playing and giggling, two boys cradled between their parents, and the parents enjoying the opportunity to stare at a hologram of a Vilantian sunset.

The silence couldn't last forever, and there was a chime at the door. It was Reilly, grinning happily with a small case filled with hair colors. Gryzzk put the boys in their beds as Grezzk lowered the gravity to match the ship before opening the door to let Reilly in who was promptly greeted by Nhoot and Gro'zel who simply had to show off their new toys. There was some general laughter and amusement as Reilly nuzzled Grezzk's neck briefly and then sneezed.

Reilly was bouncing a little bit and seemed to almost be everywhere at once, dipping a finger in the marinade and pronouncing it to be 'zippy', and then looking at the twins and ooh'ing and sniffing them delicately so as not to wake them. After that she was teaching the girls to dance. Oddly. Finally she flopped on the couch and tapped on Gryzzk's tablet.

""You didn't read the message I sent, Cap?""

Gryzzk quirked at her. ""I didn't yet.""

""Stuff's happening. Got a lead on a new job outta Hurdop Prime, and the news is going to be interesting tonight.""

The new information was accepted casually, and Gryzzk took his tablet back for more information on the job. It appeared to be a specific request from a new Hurdop trading company called the Great Triangle of Hurdop. The job itself seemed simple; escorting a pair of ships from Hurdop Prime to Terra Prime, then to Vilantia prime, and finally a return to Hurdop Prime. It seemed simple enough, but at the same time it was concerning. He looked at the pay for the job before forwarding it to Rosie with an inquiry if they could add about five percent more and stipulate payment for hazards and combat.

Rosie agreed, and they sent an amended version of the request back to the Great Triangle.

Dinner was a raucous affair, as Reilly told jokes and stories about how Gryzzk was aboard the ship. Finally as they cleaned up, the twins began to stir for their food, and Reilly was polite enough to wait that out while they watched the news. The mercenary-focused section was as interesting as Reilly had promised.

""...and in new stand-ups, we've got a few. Bad Moon Company has announced the formation of a new associate company, the Foreign Legion of Terra. This comes on the heels of Swissguards press release regarding their own Terran Legion of Foreigners and - oooh, here's a little outside the box thinking - Polar Bear Company's rolling out the Foreign Terran Legion. Funnily enough, they're all rocking shades of purple for their colors. Great marketing teams out there."" The announcer shook his head and turn to his co-anchor for more commentary while Reilly began laughing so hard tears were forming.

""Oh. My God."" Reilly wheezed. ""This is awesome.""

""I'm not sure I understand."" Gryzzk tried to focus on the commentators, who seemed pessimistic - they agreed that the 7th Cavalry had caught some manner of lightning in a bottle with the 'OG Terran Foreign Legion', but whether that success could be replicated was an entirely different manner.

Reilly giggled a little bit more before gathering herself and quoting from a movie that Gryzzk vaguely remembered. ""It's like that thing - 'Are you the Judean People's Front?' 'Fuck off! Judean People's Front. We're the People's Front of Judea!' It's hilarious, we're so good we've already got knockoffs.""

Grezzk finally got the twins resettled and changed for bed, and came out to get Reilly's hair color refreshed properly. It was an odd thing to watch, as Grezzk and Reilly chatted amiably about things - Reilly was enthralled by certain aspects of Vilantia, and made casual allusions to shore leave and possibly even vacationing there when the chance came. Finally with her hair color re-purpled and ends re-done, Reilly took her leave.

""I do believe we're going to have to ask your bosses to look at the applications you forwarded sooner rather than later."" Grezzk smiled softly.

""Mmm. Probably. We'll need to avoid damage on this next job.""

""Worry about that on the next job. I would have my handsome hand warm our bed tonight.""

He laughed it off and said, ‚ÄúAt least I didn‚Äôt burn it down, right?‚Äù Like that‚Äôs the standard we‚Äôre operating with. Another time, he left the stove burner on all night. I woke up at 3 a.m. to get water and almost lost my mind when I saw the flame still going. When I confronted him about it, he just said, ‚ÄúOh, I must‚Äôve forgotten. Chill, dude.‚Äù

But last weekend was the breaking point. We had people over to watch the NFL playoffs, and Dave was already being obnoxious, yelling at the TV like a lunatic. Then, when his team scored, he literally jumped onto our coffee table like it was a trampoline. It was a cheap IKEA table with a glass top, so you can imagine how well that went. It shattered into a million pieces. There‚Äôs glass everywhere, everyone‚Äôs staring, and Dave‚Äôs just standing there laughing, saying, ‚ÄúWell, guess we‚Äôre upgrading now!‚Äù

I absolutely lost it. I yelled, ‚ÄúAre you f***ing serious right now? You can‚Äôt keep acting like a goddamn idiot and expecting us to deal with the mess!‚Äù

Dave, instead of owning up to anything, got defensive. He was like, ‚ÄúRelax, man. It‚Äôs just a table. Why are you always so uptight?‚Äù At this point, I was seething. I told him, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just the table! It‚Äôs the pizza, the burner, the mud you track in, the shower curtain you broke because you thought swinging on it was a good idea‚Äîit‚Äôs everything! You act like this is some frat house, but we‚Äôre not here to clean up after your dumbass!‚Äù

It got loud. Dave started yelling back, saying I‚Äôm ‚Äúno fun‚Äù and I ‚Äútake everything too seriously.‚Äù He even tried to drag Mike into it, saying, ‚ÄúMike doesn‚Äôt care when I screw up!‚Äù Mike, of course, just stood there looking uncomfortable because he knows Dave‚Äôs full of shit.

At one point, Dave said, ‚ÄúIf you hate living with me so much, why don‚Äôt you move out?‚Äù And I snapped back, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you move out? You‚Äôre the one treating this place like your personal crash pad!‚Äù It ended with him storming off to his room, slamming the door like some angsty teenager.

Now, the apartment is a mess‚Äîboth literally and figuratively. Dave hasn‚Äôt apologized or even mentioned the table. He‚Äôs been passive-aggressively ignoring me and making sarcastic comments to Mike about how I‚Äôm ‚Äútoo serious for my own good.‚Äù Mike thinks I could‚Äôve handled it better, but Tom‚Äôs firmly on my side. Tom even said, ‚ÄúIf he breaks one more thing, I‚Äôm charging him for it,‚Äù and honestly, I might do the same.

I feel a little bad for how ugly it got, but I‚Äôm at my wit‚Äôs end. I can‚Äôt keep living with someone who acts like an overgrown toddler. AITAH?",1,1737734474.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

(Y1 V6) - She was able to trick Haruka and the Ayanokoji group into making them believe that she was the one who had calculated the sugar, despite the fact that she had only asked someone nearby how much sugar Haruka had put into her coffee. She was also able to dispel the uncertainty that the Ayanokoji group had, since Hiyori was from Class 1-C, they naturally thought she would be as troublesome as the rest like Ishizaki, Ryuen and Ibuki. Yet, despite this preconceived notion, Hiyori was able to give off a very good first impression due to her great social skills (Emotional Facilitation, Emotional Understanding, Social Skills, Social Awareness, Charisma, Communication)

(Y1 V7-V11.5) - Hiyori was able to deduce out that Kiyo was X. Technically, this feat isnt deduction ü§ì, but the distinction isn't really relevant here, but ill explain anyways. This conclusion is actually split up into 2 reasoning feats, figuring out that Ry≈´en was taken down by X and that Ibuki, Ishizaki and Albert were also taken down by him, and then figuring out that said person was Kiyo. 

The first part was Abductive Reasoning, as Ry≈´en having been taken down by X isn't a set rule, and all the information she had was incomplete, thus the conclusion she created was the most likely one based on the premises. This abduction most likely occured alot sooner, probably after Ry≈´en's resignation. (Ry≈´en was looking for X, Suddenly Ry≈´en steps down and isn't looking for him anymore, Ry≈´en must've found X, X must've been the one to make Ry≈´en step down)

The second feat would be her knowing that it was Kiyo, which is most likely inductive, making a general conclusion from a specific set of evidence. Like pattern recognition. I don't have the best memory of what happened here, though Hiyori most likely observed that Ishizaki, Albert, Ibuki and Ry≈´en all of a sudden started having a weird dynamic with Kiyo. Ishizaki and Albert started to have respect for Kiyo, whilst Ibuki seemed to resent him. They also seemed to trust Kiyo with saving Ry≈´en from expulsion, which means they had some trust in his abilities. Especially after the events of y1v7, this means Kiyo was most likely involved in the entire scene. Because Kiyo was one of the last suspects for being X, this means Kiyo is X, and was the one who put down Ry≈´en and his gang. So boom, Hiyori > Horikita in logical reasoning üòùüòù

(FSEQ: Emotional Understanding, Reasoning: Inductive Reasoning, Abductive Reasoning, Sensory: Observation, Intuition)

(Y2 V4) - In her conversation with Kiyo in the UIE, she had predicted that he would have taken the exam solo (Prediction)

(Y2 V4.5-V5) - Before the unanimous exam had started, Hiyori was able to reason and predict that the next exam might have something to do with expulsion, especially one of the questions. Hiyori ofc wasn't able to foresee what question might be on the exam, but based on the last exam in Y1 V10, she knew exams like this were very possible and not unlikely. Hiyori was able to predict that Ryuen would use such tests to his advantage in order to expel Tokito from his class, so she used Kiyo as a middle man to trick Katsuragi into speaking his thoughts about the class out loud to her. This, plus the Tokit≈ç fight would cause Katsuragi to want to protect Tokit≈ç from expulsion, which would be important for the next exam. Hiyori also did this to indirectly get Katsuragi to talk about the reason he was invited to Ry≈´en's class

During the UVE, Ry≈´en ofc made his plan to use Hiyori and others to form a block vote to get Tokit≈ç to reveal himself 

When Tokit≈ç had been singled out, Ry≈´en had been intending to expell him, but Katsuragi had intervened, explaining the trick, and getting Ry≈´en to change his mind and keep Tokit≈ç. Ry≈´en had thought that Hiyori was spying on him beforehand and snitched on him and Tokit≈ç to Ry≈´en, thus Ry≈´en put him in the block vote since he thought that Katsuragi would protect Tokit≈ç

Hiyori did not tell Ry≈´en shit though, and Ry≈´en was completely unaware of Tokit≈ç and Katsuragi's disagreement, and fully wanted the class points and to get rid lf Tokit≈ç. It was Hiyori who had Indirectly manipulated Katsuragi into creating a false premise about the situation, but had also forseen Ry≈´en's and Tokit≈ç's actions during the exam, and countered his plan from the shadows

(Y2 V9.5) - When Kamuro questioned Hiyori about her opinion on Kiyo and her conversation, Hiyori pretended that she didn't hear anything as she ‚Äúphased out‚Äù as the matter was about Class A and thus did not concern her. Kamuro believed this prospect, and did not question further. Hiyori was obviously able to hear their conversation as she was stood right next to both Kiyo and Kamuro, though she was able to use her acting and emotional management skills to create an air of her being phased out of their conversation

Hiyori had also seen through Hashimoto, plus his real reaaons for the conversation (FSEQ/SQ: Emotional Management, Social Skills, Communication, Charisma, Thinking: Fast Thinking, Deception: Acting, Sensory: Intuition, STP)

Imo Hiyori now outsmarts > Kiry≈´in, Horikita, Matsushita, Katsuragi, Nanase, Kushida, Kanzaki, H≈çsen, Utomiya, Hashimoto

1i8yliu,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1i8yliu/new_portafilter_issue_delonghi_dedica/,New portafilter issue [Delonghi Dedica],"Hi.

I have recently decided to do something fancy about my old DeLonghi Dedica (EC685.BK). As I have already bought Baratza Encore ESP I has high hopes for the grinding capabilities and bought a non-pressurized bottomless portafilter to replace the stock, pressurized one. I have run into some trouble though as I struggle to pull any viable shots with it.

With the pressurized one I could use the very end of the ESP spectrum setting on the Baratza (pretty much when ESP range setting ends) as otherwise little bits could get past the filter plate and clog the pressurizing hole in the basket. I hope a non-pressurized basket woudl allow me to grind finer. However, I was not successful in getting coffee with the new portafilter with a finer grind as some coffee would go through but the machine would either stop pumping or the portfilter would start to unscrew. I can get coffee using the same end-ESP range grind setting as with the pressurized one but there seems to be quite a bit of splattering.

So I am stumped as it seems that when I go finer the puck is too compressed for the coffee to flow and withe the coarser one there might be channeling. I am wonderign whether ethere is something I could try to maybe actually utilize the new portafilter or is it a lost cause and time to apologies to the stock one for trying to replace it.

* Classes - I'm used to boutique classes such as F45, 1Rebel, Barry's Bootcamp etc - I thought Blaze would be a lot more challenging than it is. I think I forgot that this is essentially a leisure centre and they have to cater to a lot of different levels - I wish they had beginner/intermediate classes.

I have been in pain for a while with 3 wisdom teeth that have to come out, but I was injured a year ago and out of work so my actual liquid funds have been low to non existent. I told them this all through my consultation, I finally got the money for the CO pay $152.00 ( for a surgery, not regular office copay) my wife took off work and I put off training for the new job I got to have this procedure done, I'm in massive pain. After a consultation and scans before the procedure I gave them my background which the only important part for this post is I have a substance abuse history long ago, years and years since I have touched anything and told them this, and also told them to NOT prescribe me any pain meds ( this is on their chart they noted that I don't want anything) after all that they still told me not to drink alcohol or use any drugs 72 hours prior, I mean what did they not understand about being completely sober for years ? So here's where they decided to make their own assumptions 
  I was told not to eat or drink from midnight on which I didn't, but I was up most of the night in pain, so in the morning I was out of it and had literal a half a sip of coffee before catching myself and dumping it out. So in the interest of just being honest with them I told them this. At first it wasn't a problem but then I noticed their body language and demeanor changing, I'm very good at reading body language and observant and my hearing is phenomenally good. So standing outside the door the basics of the conversation the two people had was that I had a substance abuse history and then I was probably lying about everything that I told them and that I probably had a full breakfast. 
So after paying, waking up at 6 am, having my wife take off work to be with me ( this is required when they put you under or they won't do the procedure and the person can't even leave the office for 5 minutes they have to sit there the whole time)  they refuse to put meunder to do the procedure which is the whole reason why I was doing it because I have a bad phobia and I get really bad anxiety and bug out when I have my mouth held open and people working inside of it I've already damaged my teeth my tongue and my cheek at the dentist trying this. 
Their reasoning for not wanting to do it was because of the sip of coffee I had had milk in it, and then I could possibly asperate and die, seemed funny to me knowing that I probably have a lot more bile in my stomach than a half a spoon or a spoon of coffee, so needless to say after making a scene, I left and went and did my own research and come to find out that it's pretty much b*******, it's over 50ml of milk that would possibly cause a problem , coffee would have been fine cause it's considered a clear liquid. 
But I'll tell you that was the worst experience, assuming I'm a lying drug addict, one of theain reasons I don't go to doctors and usually lie about my history when I do, it's not that I care because I don't, it's because of how they automatically change up and treat you different, I specifically had them put NO pain meds in my chart, so u can't say I'm drug seeking and their worried about that. Completely unprofessional to treat someone like this, it's been 15 years since I have had a drink or drug, but I will tell you doctors and nurses willake sure they treat you as if your still in active addiction, and again the reason I'm in pain alot and avoid doctors.

Hey there! üòä

I‚Äôm a 28-year-old from Europe, and I‚Äôm here looking for a connection that feels authentic‚Äîsomething built on shared understanding, good conversations, and maybe even a little magic. Whether we start with a friendly chat or dive into the bigger questions of life, I‚Äôm open to seeing where the journey takes us.

# A Bit About Me

* **Who I Am:** I‚Äôm a writer at heart‚Äîsomeone who‚Äôs fascinated by the world‚Äôs little details and always looking to capture its fleeting moments in words. I believe there‚Äôs poetry in everyday life if you look close enough. I‚Äôd describe myself as curious, introspective, and quietly optimistic.
* **My Interests:**
   * **Music:** I‚Äôm on a journey to become a vinyl collector (once I have the space for it!). I love crafting playlists that feel like soundtracks to moments in life, and I‚Äôm always hunting for new tracks that speak to the soul.
   * **Nature and Exploration:** Whether it‚Äôs hiking to catch a golden-hour view, wandering unfamiliar streets, or just stargazing on a clear night, I‚Äôm happiest when I‚Äôm exploring.
   * **Creativity:** I‚Äôve been dabbling in photography lately, trying to turn fleeting scenes into lasting memories. Writing has always been my first love, but this new creative outlet is giving it some competition.
   * **Gaming and Relaxing:** On quieter days, I enjoy diving into a good game or settling in for a movie marathon‚Äîit‚Äôs all about balance, right?

# What I‚Äôm Looking For

I‚Äôm hoping to meet someone who‚Äôs as curious about life as I am. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôd love in a partner:

* **Kindness:** You lead with your heart and care about the people around you. You‚Äôre the kind of person who finds joy in small gestures and values connection over pretense.
* **Curiosity:** You see the world as a big, wonderful puzzle to explore‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs through travel, learning something new, or simply seeing the beauty in the everyday.
* **Openness:** Life is full of surprises, and you‚Äôre not afraid to embrace them. You‚Äôre willing to share your dreams, your quirks, and maybe even your favorite coffee order.
* **Partnership:** Someone who wants to build something together‚Äîa shared world full of laughter, quiet moments, and spontaneous adventures.

# Why Message Me?

I‚Äôd like to think I bring a unique mix of thoughtfulness and enthusiasm to the table. I‚Äôll remember the little things about you‚Äîthe way your favorite song makes you smile, the dreams you‚Äôre too shy to share, or the stories that light up your eyes. I‚Äôm loyal, steady, and the kind of person who shows up for the big moments and the small ones.

I believe in the magic of connection. Whether it‚Äôs through a shared playlist, a midnight chat, or a day spent exploring something new, I want to create moments that matter‚Äîmoments that turn into memories we‚Äôll always carry.

# Let‚Äôs Start a Story

If any of this resonates, send me a message. Let‚Äôs talk about music, share our favorite books, or dream up an imaginary trip to the most beautiful place we can think of. Or maybe we‚Äôll just start with ‚Äúhello‚Äù and see where the conversation takes us.

Every story starts with a single step‚Äîthis could be ours. Looking forward to hearing from you. üòä",0,1737733635.0,r4r,1,0.5,False

I would like to inquire about stories and advice from people who have ADHD and who have successfully quit caffeine. 

Backstory: I‚Äôve (unknowingly) self-medicated with coffee since I was a teenager and I find it near impossible to function without it. This month I was determined to slowly taper off, and even with a slow tapering from an already small daily dose of high quality grind coffee (1 tablespoon/day), I get extreme withdrawals to the point that I genuinely question how such a low dose and it‚Äôs minuscule changes can have such severe effects on my brain chemistry. 

Due to being in my final year of uni, studying computer science, I had some extra coffee this week and back at square one: trying to quit (for various physical and mental health reasons) and the withdrawals again are ridiculous. 

I understand that if I just were consistent and  didn‚Äôt cave in after successfully decreasing it over 8 days, I wouldn‚Äôt be in this situation. The reason I caved in was of course because the withdrawals were simply too much, my brain felt like mush and I desperately needed my fast, clever caffeinated self. 

For reference, I‚Äôm a healthy person otherwise who eats super clean. 

I would like to hear from others who have successfully quit caffeine and how it impacted your ADHD. Please do not attempt to influence me to take medication, as I have tried it before and I do not feel that ADHD medication was healthy for me. 

TL;DR: As a person with ADHD, I‚Äôm looking for advice on how to quit and how to maintain high levels of productivity, as I feel unable to function without coffee and do not want to go back to ADHD medication. ",4,1737733530.0,decaf,1,1.0,False

I press the Latte Macchiato button, then on the first out of the three options I press the down button all the way down to where it shows the ground coffee icon. 


I press start.... and depending on how much I fill it (either with 4 scoops or all the way full), it will just cancel itself out and not make anything OR if the shoot is all the way full the machine just froths my milk and then stops making the rest. 

I also notice that unused coffee grounds seem to be going straight from where I put the coffee into the ground coffee shoot and down to the tray below. They aren't wet or anything. 


Everything is completely clean inside the drip tray and the entire pull-out tray... and there is plenty of water.


Using beans works perfectly, but trying to figure out this ground coffee problem is driving me nuts!

Coincidence? I think not.

# First Thoughts

When the MEATER Pro arrived, I was skeptical af. It costs more than my first date with my wife (which, tbh, might explain a lot). The packaging is all sleek bamboo and minimalist design. It's like if Apple decided to make meat thermometers.

But here's where it gets interesting. Unlike my previous relationship with ""smart"" kitchen gadgets (RIP coffee maker that needed its own IT department), this thing actually makes sense. It's basically a very fancy stick that goes into your meat and tells your phone when to stop cooking it. Simple as it sounds, it's something I never knew I needed.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Heads up:

**BEST PRICE on the MEATER Pro here:**

[**https://amzn.to/4hvS19g**](https://amzn.to/4hvS19g)

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Features that matter

**Heat resistance.** This handles up to 1000¬∞F, which means it can survive my cooking even when I'm channeling my inner dragon. For context, that's hot enough to make my previous thermometers curl up and cry.

**Six sensors.** It's got five internal sensors and one ambient sensor, which is five more sensors than I had when I was using the ""cut and peek"" method. These sensors work together like a really nerdy boy band to find the actual lowest temperature in your meat. 

**Wireless.** This thing is completely wireless, which means I can actually close my grill lid. The range is impressive enough that I can monitor my cook from the bathroom (don't judge, I wash my hands after).

**App actually works.** The app isn't some afterthought coded by an intern during lunch. It's actually good. It gives you real-time temps, estimates cooking time (usually more accurately than my ""eh, probably 20 more minutes"" method), and even accounts for resting time. 

# Pros

* **Idiot-proof accuracy.** The ¬±0.5¬∞F accuracy might sound like overkill, but for someone who once served chicken tartare by accident, this level of precision is like having training wheels for being a functional adult. Each unit comes with a calibration certificate that looks fancy enough to frame (I didn't, but I thought about it).

* **The charging situation.** The bamboo charging block isn't just for show (though it does look nice enough that my wife stopped hiding it in the drawer with the other ugly kitchen stuff). A 15-minute charge gets you 12 hours of cooking time, which is longer than any relationship I had in college. And it's magnetic, so it lives on my fridge like a fancy adult version of those alphabet magnets.

* **Smart home integration.** It works with Apple Watch and Alexa, which means I can check meat temps while pretending to pay attention during Zoom meetings.

* **Actually waterproof.** You can sous vide with it, wash it in the dishwasher, or use it in the rain because apparently some people grill in weather that isn't perfect (couldn't be me).

# Cons

* **Price.** Let's address the wagyu in the room. Isn't cheap. You could buy a lot of backup pizza with that money. 

* **Bluetooth drama.** Sometimes it has connectivity hiccups. It's not a dealbreaker, but occasionally you'll need to do the old ""turn it off and on again"" trick.

* **Takes practice.** The app has more features than my car, and yes, you'll actually need to read some instructions.

# Last word (for now)

If your Google history is just endless variations of ""how do I know if chicken is actually done,"" this gadget is worth having around. 

The MEATER Pro won't turn you into Gordon Ramsay overnight (thank god - one is enough), but it will stop you from serving accidental steak tartare to your mother-in-law. Is that really worth the price? Well, that's up to you. Depends how much you like her, I guess.

I am SO disappointed in kidani village. 

Front desk lies about literally everything. 

This morning at Sanaa had a poached egg, they got it wrong twice, and the third one had eggshell in it. 

Said the hot tub was closed for inclement weather, but it is 67 and sunny. Also, jambo house pool was open, so why wasn't that one closed for inclement weather? Does it only affect one park? 

Then today ""it's open"" so I walk ALL THE WAY OUT THERE, FOR IT TO BE CLOSED! I go back to the front and ""oh 12 to 5"" ...so why did you not tell me that in my swimsuit earlier?

No care or concern. Staff are so rude. 

Day 1 of epcot the after hours was so closed you couldn't even get a cup of coffee. It looked like it was closed down. What's the point of after hours if you can't even enjoy the park? 

Magic kingdom you can't even enter the park for the fireworks hardly. You have to go all the way around and maybe get into the roped off area. A cast member told us fireworks were at 10. But turns out it's at 8. 

Animal kingdom there was a 195 minute wait for expedition everest. I was in the single rider line, left to go find my mom, and came back and it was ""full for the entire day"" then I was able to get in line later. So, not for the entire day then?

The game you play to get on guardians is insane. Went to ask guest relations if I was doing something wrong. They said no, turns out, the one time I pulled to refresh it worked. (So I WAS doing something wrong)

As someone who worked remotely, I often struggled to find the right space to focus. I found myself traveling all the way to Belapur and Seawoods in search of coworking spaces. But let's face it‚Äîthese spaces were not just far but also quite costly.

Sometimes, I even resorted to working from coffee shops, buying expensive coffees just to have a seat to work. While this might work for a while, it wasn‚Äôt sustainable‚Äîneither for the wallet nor for productivity.

That‚Äôs when the idea struck me: **Why not create a space right here in Panvel for people like me?** A place where people hustling in and around Panvel don‚Äôt have to compromise on their work or travel far just to get a functional, professional workspace.

And that‚Äôs how **SpaceIvy** was born‚Äîa coworking lounge designed to solve this very problem. Located right at the heart of Panvel, it‚Äôs a space where you can work without breaking the bank. At just ‚Çπ75/hour, we‚Äôve made it the **most affordable coworking space in the area**, with coffee included for all the coffee lovers out there!

If you‚Äôre someone who‚Äôs been struggling to find a WFH-friendly workspace or tired of traveling to far-off coworking spaces, **SpaceIvy is here for you.**

As a special launch offer, **the space is open for free until February 5th**! So why not drop by, check it out, and see if this place can become yours?

Feel free to call or WhatsApp me at **7093337139** if you‚Äôd like to visit or learn more.

I tried it all- only drinking on weekends, limiting my drinks, beer only. Took Rx medication. Dry January. Alternating a beer/drink with a water. Only drinking on full stomach. No drinking before 6PM. Never drinking two days in a row. Nothing would work. 

I could quit for a while, and then crash even harder with a big bender. Rinse, repeat. After four drinks, call the candyman and stay up for 3 days ripping lines with questionable company. Fun, fun, fun. 

Fuck it. Went to a meeting. Got a book. Read it. Decided to give AA a legitimate effort- show up, do what the instruction manual says to the letter. Got a sponsor. Did what the sponsor said, to the letter (when it aligned with the instruction manual). I was going to prove these fuckers wrong. AA would not work for me. It's a cult.

After all, I held prestigious job titles. Big expense account. Cool house on a golf course, cool cars in the garage, hot wife. My only problem was booze, and these losers in AA had nothing to offer me. I had all the answers. 

I kept going back. 90 in 90, because they told me to. Worked the steps, made the stupid amends. Did the silly holding hands circle. Even made coffee for others during meetings, and went around and filled mugs. Passed the basket and counted the dollars. Frickin' admin work. I was a VP. That's my new, current model year Vette out in the parking lot, don't you see it? This was so dumb. I'm not one of you AA'ers. 

Sponsor said if I didn't get humble, I'd drink. Said I wasn't being rigorous enough. So I doubled down, just to prove him wrong, too. Did all the ""helping those in need"" bullshit. Sharing my experience, strength and hope nonsense. 

Got a year. Then two. Coming up on 19. Didn't relapse. Still not a believer, found a higher power in reason, because I'm the analytical type. Logic and reason dictate that I don't drink, so it's my higher power. 

Got cancer. Dad died. Lost jobs. Didn't drink. Recovered from the incredible financial hole I had dug. Still trying to prove that AA is a cult and doesn't work. Failing miserably. Best failure of all time. 

What'd I learn? Get humble. Consider you might not have all the answers. Follow the instructions in the book, not the advice of people who can't manage their own lives. Show up. Lose your preconceived notions, because they just might not be correct. An honest effort can produce results. It'll suck, but it just might be your best shot at living a decent life.

So I was talking to a guy on hinge with who I had a great conversation. He asked me out but I couldn‚Äôt at the time but we still kept chatting and said that we‚Äôd love too when we‚Äôre both back because he was leaving too. Turns out by a huge coincidence he works at a radio station that I work in one day a week. I hadn‚Äôt  really heard from him during the break but I texted him when I was back and he said he was too.
I texted him again later saying I‚Äôd be working at the radio so that he wouldn‚Äôt be blindsided. He was like okay great so not much reaction by text. He then left me on read for the rest of our conversation. When I saw him for the first time it was a very close work setting and we were next to each other the entire time. We were both nervous I can tell and he seems shy but we still managed to talk. He finished later as he actually is an employee but I gained the confidence to ask him if he might want to get a coffee once he has finished and he seemed very happy too. He said he‚Äôd let me know when he was done. He never did so I went home. The next day I put a question about book recommendations in my story and he answered so I texted him asking about it. I said sorry if I made him uncomfortable and he said that he needed to apologize to me instead for not texting me but that we could do something on a weekend. I saw him at work today and everything was normal and chatty. At lunch we both went to a supermarket talked the whole way back and forth. Right as we were going back into the office I said that if he had changed his mind it was 100% okay if he wanted to forget about before but that I needed to know. He said he was very busy ( which is true) and that he goes home on some weekends ( not in the same city) but that he would be down to get a drink on a weekend. I said I didn‚Äôt want to force him and he said he wouldn‚Äôt be. Everything was like before and I‚Äôve left home now.

I‚Äôve brought it up to him before, and it generally gets better for around week, and he goes back to the way it was before. 

 Today, I got home from work and say the dishes and yelled at him. I asked him if he forgot what we talked about, if he‚Äôs incompetent, etc.

1i8xxgb,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i8xxgb/argentina_jan_25_report_of_a_few_things/,Argentina - Jan 25 - report of a few things,"I spent a lot of time researching the current state of Argentina travel and got very little. I went anyway. About two weeks, Buenos Aires and Mendoza. Here are a few tips that might help you.

Despite everything you read about currency and money and blue rate and sketchy cambio, that's all mostly a THING OF THE PAST. The reality of travel here is everyone uses cards and apps, including the locals. The maximum size of paper bills is about USD $10 (10k ARS) and that's one bottle of midrange wine at the corner store, people are not carrying big wads of cash. They are using contactless. Everywhere. (This is a common thing among many countries in Argentina's spot, because the government would like the tax revinue, so they make cash harder). You will NOT have trouble using your card or apple / google tap to pay almost anywhere. AND YOU GET A GOOD RATE (seems to pencil out at about 1200 right now looking at my card). So don't worry about it.

That being said, getting a bit of cash is necessary for one thing, tips. Apparently 10% ""propina"" is normal. You'll either see it auto-added to the bill, or you'll see a tip jar and attempt to leave cash. The only way I found to \*easily\* get cash is an ATM. They appear to spit out not that much money, and charge some huge fee. If I read right, they are charging USD 10 to withdraw USD 30? I hope I misread it.... but I don't have the energy to mess with Western Union just to carry enough cash for tipping.

In order to use the public bus systems - which are frequent and very useful - you \*have\* to have a SUBE card. Getting the physical SUBE card right now is not easy. Apparently the physical cards come and go. It appears you can't use the SUBE app as a foreigner because you don't have the right ID number. You can use the BA metro if you find a turnstyle that takes tap to pay directly. On the other hand, SUBE cards in Mendoza seem plentiful, lots of places offer them downdown. I think they're the same card and probably work everywhere in the country.

Cabs. I found using actual taxis hard. As a traveler, you never know if the particular street and time of day will have floating free cabs, or not. Airports, sure. Downtowns have ranks. The cabs have a friendly red sign that says ""free"" when they're free. The cabs seem honest. But, Uber works here, as does a local app called Cabify. In general, I found Uber and Cabify work almost like rest of world, in that the car takes about twice as long to arrive as it says. I ended up comparing prices on Uber and Cabify for a while then settled on Cabify. I also tried a local ""radio taxi"" app but found 2/2 times a taxi would accept then drop, then another would accept, then drop, so I stopped trying - maybe it's a good way? just didn't work for me.  In BA, a 15 minute ride (which will get you pretty far, like Palermo to the downtown), is usually somewhere around USD 6, and at that point I'm good. Longer rides - or at night - seem to get surcharge-y, I often paid ARS $10k and I think I've even paid $20 for a ride.

In general, in January 2025, prices are \*NOT CHEAP\* for most things. There was a massive round of inflation through mid 2024, but Millie's monetary policies are working, leading to general civil contentment. Even local bars and corner stores have people out enjoying a coffee or splitting a 40oz if they're less well off. But with foreign exchange (and thus things like cards) working, prices are high. For example, a mid-range bottle of malbec at the corner store is USD $10, and the bottom shelf is like USD 4. Getting a plate of pasta at a local cafe for lunch is USD 10ish. A cafe is like USD 3 or 4 depending on the kind of place (but with multi-hour sitting). High end tourist places are expensive even by my standards - I did spend something like USD 100 on a good meal, and Mendoza michelin star tasting menus are like USD 300. At one place I joined a waitlist for a table and the fee if you are a no-show is USD 50! The fancy hotel in Mendoza right on the square (park hyatt) is well over USD 250 a night.

Things that \*are\* cheap are AirBnbs and taxis. Most other things - and tourist experiences - are more like what I'd expect in the rest of the world. Don't go expecting a bargain!

Oh, a word about domestic air travel. Dang its easy and cheap. Between JetSmart, FlyBiondi, and Aerolineas, there are a lot of flights, a lot of competition, and low prices. If you go budget all the way (pick a cheap time of day, don't by the extras) you might fly for USD 35 (think ryanair). If you want to travel like a human you might pay USD 70. If you lard up with extras or pick a popular flight you might pay USD 150. BA airports are a little chaotic but not more than London or anywhere else. For domestic flights you don't have to do the ""3 hours before"", but I wouldn't cut is super close - it's kind of like how post-pandemic america is (1.5 hours if checking luggage, 1.0 if not).

In a lot of places, you'll see vestiges of the old ways. Don't be surprised, it's just how it is. For example, I took an air flight, it was on a SkyMiles (Delta in US) airline where I don't have status, and needed to check two bags. Therefore I had to pay for the second bag, no problem. When I got to checkin, they checked me, took both bags, but then explained I would have to go to a cashier counter 100m away, pay, and they would give me my final boarding pass. The ""multi-step"" process happens plenty of other places, I've seen bakeries with two different cashiers, you buy what you want, they wrap it up, they give the parcel to the cashier, you only get it out of hock by paying. In the old days you probably had to bring a chit back to the other counter.

A word about dining etiquette. Argentians like a hearty ""good morning!"" (or whatever) in spanish when you enter a shop, and eye contact. If you're a regular you might be expected to shake or hug, I've seen that. Getting a menu is often a leisurely affair, although once you get a menu things tend to move along (not like in other places). You \*will not\* be approached, they are very polite, you have to make eye contact or flag someone down to order, order more, get a menu back after they've taken it away, get a check, pay. That's good service to them! I've been in places (like china) that use this system but the argentinians use it almost to a fault. Related, the staff often stands so they have a clear view of their area, which sometimes means standing out at the curb looking into the restaurant. They have a system, just give a signal. If you don't see your human make a signal to some service human and they'll usually find the right one. Or maybe they won't, and you'll have to try again. Restaurants aren't supposed to be fast - I mean, there is fast food, but a sit down restaurant isn't it. Oh, and I've had more cases in a week and a half where someone forgets something. Don't worry, take it in stride.

Generally, if you're going to sit, go sit, and someone will be along. If you want to hurry them up, give them a little eye contact or an eyebrow. I've started asking ""can I sit here?"" just to move the process along a bit. It's usually possible to order at the counter and then sit down, but generally ordering at the counter is for take away, and they'll take your order (it really speeds things up) but they'll be a little confused. Whether you pay at the table or at the counter is about 50/50 so far. Also, when you ask for the check, you can save a step by mentioning ""tarjeta"" (card) and they'll bring the contactless thing. Huge time saver.

Tipping has been a bit of a mystery. Local businesses seem to be struggling too. I've now seen a couple of places with the dreaded ""tip buttons"" on the contactless payment systems. I've seen 10% added to checks. Generally, you're expected to ""round up"" during the contactless, and the staff will show you the bill and say ""that amount?"" by which they mean ""would you like to add a little here, or are you planning to leave cash?"" :-) . One place they refused to accept a tip with contactless, another place they required it to be two steps. It's all over the map.

One final word about language. Dear god, the Argentinian accent is something special. They should almost call it a different language, it's about as different as brazillian portugues from european. Even super useful words like ""aqui"" are like ""a-shee"". In reality people in the service industry seem to take a cue from how you say good morning or hello, and will shift accents to try to accommodate. But they don't slow down! They also believe it is polite that if you start in spanish, they're going to continue in spanish. I finally have figured out I'm getting pegged as a brazilian, I believe how I say good morning, and they get a lot of brazillian tourists. It's good to simply announce your language (both ""I speak"" and ""my language is""), and they'll try to muddle through with you, especially if you use a bit of eye contact and smiles. If you speak central american (eg, mexican) spanish there's probably something you can say to get most people to try to speak that accent. In general, I have now found that a hearty (if slightly mangled good morning / good day / good evening) followed by a ""habla anglais?"" with a smile, maybe even a shot at ""I speak a little spanish...."", is the best policy.

A final word about safety. I have no idea what anyone has been talking about that this is an unsafe country. As a 6 foot white guy, sure, I tend to not have to worry, but I notice locals don't worry either. Plenty of unaccompanied women walking home on deserted streets at 1am, which surely doesn't happen in oakland, for example. In general the mood here is pretty good, not the kind of desperation you hear about, or might have been true 6 to 18 months ago - IDK I wasn't here. It's quite possible if you get out into the real slums you'll have a problem - but that's certainly true in the US! - there's parts of every US city where I'm like ""oh oh, time to turn around"". I honestly feel safer than I do in America. Not as safe as Japan, of course.

There, i've given back. It's been good travels here. Don't let what you read about the currency, or safety, set you off, but don't come expecting a bargain.",13,1737732411.0,travel,5,1.0,False

By that logic, manually vacuuming my floors while owning three shedding cats was my personal brand of crazy.

So, decided to try out this iRobot Roomba Y0140 model.

Here's what happened next.

# First Thoughts

The thing about robot vacuums is they promise a future straight out of The Jetsons, but the reality is more like WALL-E meets your drunk uncle trying to navigate a dark hallway. So my expectations were pretty low to begin with.

The setup was surprisingly straightforward, which immediately made me suspicious. Nothing in my life that involves both technology and cleaning has ever been simple. 

But there it was, this little black disk, sitting in its charging station looking like it was ready to either clean my floors or become self-aware and take over my smart home devices.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Features that matter

**The navigation system.** The ""smart navigation"" system actually does clean in surprisingly methodical rows, though occasionally it gets existential and decides to spin in place for no apparent reason. It's like watching a tiny robot have a mid-life crisis in your living room. I actually find this quite entertaining though.

**4-stage cleaning system.** The edge-sweeping brush is particularly impressive, reaching into corners like a nosy neighbor trying to peek through your windows. The suction power isn't going to replace my full-size vacuum, but it's strong enough to handle daily debris and the eternal cat hair situation.

**Mopping feature.** The mopping function is like that friend who shows up to help you move but mostly just pushes things around while looking busy. It's not useless, but don't expect genuine cleaning. It's more like a light dusting with a damp cloth.

**Battery life/charging.** Gives you 120 minutes of runtime, so it can handle my entire apartment before needing a recharge. When it does need juice, it somehow finds its way back to the charging station like me in my college days stumbling home after last call. Not always gracefully, but it gets there.

**The iRobot home app.** The app is surprisingly un-terrible. You can start cleaning sessions, set schedules, and even get cleaning reports, though I'm not sure I needed that level of documentation about my home's filth.

# Pros

* It actually works.
* The navigation system is smarter than my ex (low bar, but still).
* Setup is easy enough that I didn't need to call my nephew for help.
* The app doesn't make me want to throw my phone across the room.
* It's quiet enough that I can run it during video calls without sounding like I'm broadcasting from inside a jet engine.

# Cons

* Gets stuck under furniture exactly 3 inches off the ground (which is, coincidentally, all of my furniture).
* The mop feature is more ""symbolic"" than ""functional"".
* Needs emptying more often than my coffee maker needs refilling.
* Occasionally tries to eat charging cables like they're some sort of robot spaghetti.

# Last word (for now)

The Roomba Y0140 isn't going to transform your home into a museum-grade display of cleanliness. It's more like that friend who helps you clean up after a party: good intentions, questionable execution, but hey, at least you're not doing it alone. 

If you're the type who's accepted that ""perfectly clean"" is a myth sold by Instagram influencers, and you just want your floors to be presentable enough that you won't die of shame when your mother-in-law drops by unannounced, this little robot has your back. 

It's especially clutch if you've got pets who seem to be running an underground fur-distribution network or if you're trying to convince yourself you live in the future.

For the past week or so, my husband has randomly taken an increased interest in making sure that I‚Äôm being more ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù as he put it last night, and holding me accountable for certain things. My mental state hasn‚Äôt been that great recently and so things like showering and brushing my teeth have been getting put on the back burner in favor of mere survival.

For a bit of context, the longest I‚Äôve EVER gone without a shower was about 5 days, when my depression and executive dysfunction were at their very worst. And I always make sure to at least use personal wipes. 

But recently, every night my husband has been pushing me to shower and brush my teeth because he knows I‚Äôm bad at it. I KNOW he‚Äôs right, I just don‚Äôt like it.

And then last night, we got a new coffee table delivered (yay for building things!!!!!) so of course I was wildly excited to put it together A S A P. It ended up taking longer than expected (as things tend to do with this disorder) and around 9:30pm he came out to remind (tell) me that I still needed to eat dinner, shower, brush my teeth, and get ready for sleep.

I tried my hardest to fight him on it but inside I KNEW he was right. I just didn‚Äôt like it because I had a fun new toy to play with!! So eventually he managed to convince me to pack up with the promise that I could finish tomorrow/today. So now I can‚Äôt wait to get back home so I can finish building my new coffee table (it has a lift-top!!!!)

So I‚Äôve been pouting (internally and sometimes externally) because the external force that I always dreamed of having to help hold me accountable‚Ä¶ is doing exactly what I wanted‚Ä¶ and I hate it‚Ä¶ but I can‚Äôt say anything about it because I know he‚Äôs right.

What I've settled on is the following. Forgive the vagueness in spots, still unsure how I want to proceed.

Season a lean cut of steak with light amounts of salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes, and ground coffee.

Cook the steak on a stovetop in a small amount of light oil. Once cooked, set aside. Reduce heat. Add sliced mushrooms into the pan with some chopped chives to cook them in the steak juices. (Mushrooms first, wait a bit, then chives, so the chives don't overcook.)

Once the mushrooms are cooked, drain the pan, keeping the pan's drippings. Mix up a little bit of water, corn starch/flour, and something balsamic?, then add the drippings to the mix to create a drizzle.

I have never tasted Bittermens Elemakule Tiki bitters that seem to be the most popular one, but I knew that I wanted my version to be spicy and tropical. I tried to find recipes online but found only a few. 

Perhaps some consider it cheating but I asked a well know AI language model chatbot for help. I made a detailed prompt asking for a recipe that was tropical fruit forward, a recipe that was mainly spicy, and a third recipe with elements of both. That third recipe was okay but not good enough. For example, it was completely lacking a bitter component. I tweaked the recipe a bit and added dried Curacao peel as my bittering agent.

Other ingredients are dried pineapple, dried mango, cinnamon, pimento, cloves, mace, vanilla and fresh ginger. I macerated everything in a combination of home made strong alcohol and Wray & Nephew rum. 

After three weeks I filtered the liquid. It was spicy indeed! But the alcohol was also too strong, over shouting most flavours. I added some water, passion fruit syrup and grenadine. After a night in the fridge all solids and undissolved oils in the liquid settled and I filtered it through a coffee filter.

I'm very happy with the result. At first you'll taste the spices followed by tropical sweetness and then the bitterness of the Curacao.

1i8xprb,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1i8xprb/dirty_blood/,DIRTY BLOOD,"I was called by my adoptive NMom as dirty blood after I accidentally met her at the grocery store. I have heard her call me many things but to be called dirty blood just hurts so much.  
I'm adopted. I don't know who my biological parents are. All my life, all the family I knew was from my adoptive parents.  
I was close with my adoptive father but for as long as I remember, my adoptive mother was absent in most of my important milestones. She refused to go on stage with me to present my medals during my junior years, she was absent in both my high school and college graduation. Never heard any congratulatory words from her or even a simple ""I'm proud of you"". The one who I always hear that from was my adoptive father.  
When my adoptive father died, my adoptive NMom really began showing her fangs. She'd recall things about my past and use it against me and mock jokes about me being fat when in fact, I am not even obese. She's not physical yet but she borderlining on violence that whenever she's angry when things don't go her way, she would slam doors, tables, scream, say expletive words.

She used my adoptive father's death to earn sympathy from other people while making me the bad guy saying that I was never there to care for my dad while he was sick. But of course that was BS. I was there up to his last breath and I was the only one who held my father's hand until he died. While my mom was busy calling her friends on messenger ""crying"" while telling them that dad just died.

There were others who believed her lies but those who remained skeptical about her BS were those who met me and knew how close I was to my father. My dad would often bring me out for a Saturday coffee date when I was young. Of course, he ordered me juice back then but it was kind of our bonding time together. I usually met his friends in one of our regular coffee shop and they would often comment how close I was with him and my dad often replying ""Of course, she's my kid.""

I'm used to tuning out the words she spoke about me and have been going no contact but today she really caught me and used that chance to hit me where it's worst. I kept my face calm and cold not to let her know I was really affected by it but after she left, I had an immediate panic attack. It was a good thing that therapy taught me some things on how to manage it.

Sometimes I wonder if the stories from my relatives saying that she was the one who wanted the adoption was even true because for as long as I can remember, I never remembered receiving a sincere physical affection from my adoptive mom nor even knowing what maternal love is like. When she does it, it is for a show in front of other parents. But alone, she never hugs me and would often had a look of disgust if any part of her skin just slightly grazes me.

It was my adoptive father who I bonded so much.  
He's been gone for 4 years now.

A quick update on mod activity!","TL: DR: I‚Äôm programming the automod to remove posts (edit: *and comments*) by users who have less than 100 post karma and 200 comment karma, to vastly automate and reduce the flood of repost/scam bots. Hopefully I drew it up right and it‚Äôll work.

Greetings, Tarnished Warriors!

Over the last month, I, u/warp_legion, with aid of u/saphirepuma, was promoted by them to moderator to take over running the subreddit.

Many of you will have no doubt seen that for many many months, repost and scam bots have run rampant. That ends, hopefully today, tho I have manually removed well over a hundred reposts at least, and removed dozens of those usually Radahn festival tshirt scam bot posts. 

I say in complete truth that approximately 2 of every 3 posts on this sub were being made by repost/scam bots. That‚Äôs how bad it was.

Today, however, I have an announcement!

I‚Äôve just, hopefully, as I am completely new to this, activated the automod to nip in the bud and remove posts made by users with less than 100 post karma, and more importantly, less than 200 comment karma, which is about 90% of bot accounts, which chiefly run off of reposting, well, posts, and thus languish with 0-250 comment karma.

I do apologize, I know that will stop at least a few genuine fellow Elden Ring fans from posting till they‚Äôve gotten a little more karma (an up to date list of subreddits that have lower minimum karma requirements can be found on google), but I promise that this will finally end the scourge of the bots.

Now, I hope it will work straight away, and will check in about 12 hours to see if the automod is working as intended, but as I am brand new to trying to program it via following guides, I may have well messed up and will need to retweak it. I beg your patience if that turns out to be the case!

I will release another PSA in a few days if it‚Äôs working tho, discussing the future of the sub and what events or contests or whatnot we could do. A new subreddit icon, and banner perhaps?

Tell me your ideas!

Edit: While I am upon my soapbox, please remember, any and all of those posts of a t-shirt, coffee mug, painting, poster, etc with Elden Ring related themes are *scams*. The ones I see mostly here are a plethora of Radahn Festival t-shirt scams, but there are others, and occasionally Dark Souls related ones. 

Don‚Äôt click the links the bots post! Report those scams especially if they slip past the automod, even if bots haven‚Äôt started linking sham websites in the comments yet. They will eventually unless it‚Äôs reported and removed.",2,1737731654.0,EldenRingMemes,4,0.67,False

They have been on high alert since our visit by the black eyed children. I gently roll out of bed so I don‚Äôt squish anyone. Then I walk downstairs. Not feeling like cooking, I just make a bowl of cereal. As I sit there and eat, I think. So lost in my thoughts, I don‚Äôt hear Maddy walk up.
‚ÄúHey.‚Äù

‚ÄúJesus Christ.‚Äù I yell with a start.

‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù Maddy says as she sits down.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it. Today is the big day. You ready?‚Äù I ask.

Maddy sighs.
‚ÄúI guess. Still don‚Äôt like how this went down.‚Äù

I can understand that. When mayor Brown said he was gone after Election Day. He wasn‚Äôt kidding. He has already moved out of the mayor‚Äôs house and he said he‚Äôs leaving town exactly at twelve o one tonight. I take Maddy‚Äôs hand.
‚ÄúListen. I know this hasn‚Äôt been the way you wanted it but you won. Chances are you would‚Äôve won anyway. Before he dropped out, you were ahead in the polls.‚Äù

Maddy smiles.
‚ÄúI guess.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no guess to it. You won. Who cares if it was a bit unconventional?‚Äù

‚ÄúI know. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶.you know. Not the same.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶hey. You ready to move in the mayor‚Äôs house? Aka your childhood home?‚Äù

Maddy leans on the counter.
‚ÄúYeah. It will be nice to move out of mom‚Äôs house. She‚Äôs not happy, she says I should stay and be closer to the advisors.‚Äù

I giggle a bit.
‚ÄúSounds like her. Considering every angle.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be at the victory party right?‚Äù Maddy asks.

‚ÄúWe will all be there. Now get out of here. Don‚Äôt you have to be at your campaign headquarters?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure do. I want to thank what volunteers I have left.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo go‚Ä¶go. I‚Äôll see you tonight. Congratulations mayor.‚Äù

We hug and Maddy leaves. I finish my cereal and head to the guesthouse. I knock on the door and Fang answers it.
‚ÄúHey, Fang. Where‚Äôs Holden?‚Äù

‚ÄúHolden is right here.‚Äù Holden says as he walks up. He looks like he just got out of the shower.

‚ÄúDude. Ready for tonight?‚Äù

Holden rubs Fang‚Äôs head.
‚ÄúGo wake up Lilith. We got a big ass day today.‚Äù

Fang smiles and takes off.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready. What time we got to be there?‚Äù Holden asks.

‚ÄúPolls close at eight so eight thirty.‚Äù

‚ÄúYup. I‚Äôll be there.‚Äù

‚ÄúWear a suit.‚Äù I say.

Holden tilts his head back.
‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúListen asshole. This is a big day for Maddy. Don‚Äôt fuck this up for her.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk. Fine. Whatever.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou swear?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúYes, I swear. No get out of my face.‚Äù Holden says before slamming the door shut.

Smiling, I make an iced coffee and then head out to the fairy colony.
‚ÄúHello, ladies. Maddy‚Äôs victory party is tonight give me something special.‚Äù

I sip my coffee and gossip as the fairies braid my hair. The end result is two French braids. One running down each side of my head.
‚ÄúExquisite as usual. Thank you.‚Äù

‚ÄúTell Maddy we would love to do her hair.‚Äù A fairy tells me.
,
‚ÄúI would but she‚Äôs already gone. I‚Äôll tell her tonight and maybe she will get her hair done for the mayor‚Äôs Christmas party.‚Äù

The fairies cheer and I leave. As I walk up, Aurora walks out of the back door.
‚ÄúWhen did you get here?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúJust now.‚Äù

‚ÄúReady for tonight?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúSure am. Brought a change of clothes and everything.‚Äù

‚ÄúCool. Good.‚Äù I say then I lean in. ‚ÄúAny sign of the black eyed children?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. I think they are honoring the agreement.‚Äù

I‚Äôve been thinking about this.
‚ÄúOk. Why were there so many?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, see. I think they were going to hit the town hard and when you fought. It free all of them here. I‚Äôve seen no reports of anyone missing. So in a roundabout way, you might have saved many lives.‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess it‚Äôs good I picked a fight.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy did you do that? That was crazy as hell.‚Äù Aurora says before lighting a cigarette.

‚ÄúCan I have one?‚Äù I ask.

Aurora gives me a cigarette and I light it before answering.
‚ÄúYou know. This is my home. Mom kinda ran this place like a sanctuary. It angered me that they were invading.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat was crazy though.‚Äù 

I take a drag.
‚ÄúI know. I had to defend my home.‚Äù

I take another drag.
‚ÄúI get why she is the way she is.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho? Your mom? How so?‚Äù Aurora asks.

‚ÄúThe pressure of this life. As I grew up, I would see my mom out here at night sometimes. ,Smoking, thinking. I would ask if everything was alright and she would say yes but I know now that she was lying.‚Äù

I take another drag.

‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt know how she did this. Starting out she had nowhere near the support I have. It‚Äôs crazy.‚Äù

Aurora takes a drag.
‚ÄúI can see that. I have to say, you e done well so far. I mean‚Ä¶a days walk from here is a lot of ground. A lot of people will be safe now because of you.‚Äù

‚ÄúStill not everyone.‚Äù I reply.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt save everyone. There‚Äôs no way. There‚Äôs this old saying that goes. Tend to the garden you can touch.‚Äù

I take a drag.
‚ÄúI see your point.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know I‚Äôm right. So stop worrying, ok?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe. We do have a reason to celebrate tonight.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah we do. We riding together?‚Äù Aurora asks.

‚ÄúSure. Sounds fun.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk. I‚Äôll see you later. I got things to do in the conservatory.‚Äù

‚ÄúLater.‚Äù

Aurora leaves.

I sit there and finish my cigarette. Then I go and practice my hatchet skills. After about a hour and nothing else to do. I take a nap. After sleeping part of the early afternoon away, I get up. I decide to change plans a bit so I go get some lunch at Esmeralda‚Äôs. After I go home and after some time I get changed and head to the office. Aurora is already there and dressed to the nines in a low cut, black cocktail dress.
‚ÄúLookin good, bitch.‚Äù I say.

Aurora laughs.
‚ÄúI know. Thanks.‚Äù

Holden walks in wearing a pinstripe suit.

‚ÄúHey, sailor.‚Äù Aurora says.

‚ÄúYeah, yeah, yeah. I look ridiculous in this bullshit.‚Äù

‚ÄúBullshit? You look good.‚Äù I say.

‚ÄúCan we leave and get this over with?‚Äù Holden asks.

‚ÄúThe victory party awaits.‚Äù I say.

As we walk out of the house. Several black vans pull up.

‚ÄúWhat is this bullshit?‚Äù Holden asks.

As many men get out. I say.
‚ÄúExcuse me. Can I help you?‚Äù

One of the men holds up a finger. A moment later a black, old school impala drives up. I man wearing a beat up cowboy hat gets out.

‚ÄúCan I help you?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúWell good evening. How are you little lady?‚Äù The cowboy asks as he takes off his hat.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine. I‚Äôm just wondering why you‚Äôre here.‚Äù I answer.

‚ÄúOh, excuse me. My name is Wyatt. Pleased to meet you. I happen to know your mom. We go way back. Is she here?‚Äù

My blood runs cold. My mom has told me about this man.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs away on business. She should be back any day now.‚Äù

What puts his hat back on and grimaces.
‚ÄúYou sure about that? She‚Äôs been gone for a hot minute.‚Äù

Shit. He knows.

‚ÄúLook, dude. Mom‚Äôs not here but she could show up at any minute. I suggest you leave. If she wants to catch up with you, she will.‚Äù

Wyatt snaps his fingers and all of his men pull out guns and point them at us.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right. Aim at the werewolf. He‚Äôs the present threat.‚Äù Wyatt says.

‚ÄúAre you out of your fucking mind? Mom is going to kill you for aiming at her daughter. She already owes you for shooting her.‚Äù I say.

Wyatt laughs.
‚ÄúShe told you that? I‚Äôm tickled. Hell, your mom has more lives than a cat. Every time I had her dead to rights somehow she survived. Irritating really.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúWell. I‚Äôve expanded my operations. I now also collect things and sell them to very rich people. Things that are in your mom‚Äôs vault.‚Äù

I laugh despite myself.
‚ÄúYou would have better luck going to the barbershop and getting a unicorn horn.‚Äù

Now Wyatt laughs as he looks at his men.
‚ÄúWell looky here. Baby Faust has jokes.‚Äù

Then he becomes serious and looks back at us.
‚ÄúUnfortunately the jokes stop here, little lady. Now move aside and let us get what we came for.‚Äù

‚ÄúOver your dead body.‚Äù I tell him.

Wyatt raises an eyebrow.
‚ÄúHard way it is then. Fine.‚Äù

Right when Wyatt says fine, Aurora waves her hand an energy shield raises and protects us from all of the bullets.
‚ÄúInside!‚Äù I yell.

We scramble and shut the door behind us. Holden strips quickly and transforms. I look over at him.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do anything. Not yet.‚Äù

Holden snarls at me.
‚ÄúShut up. Give me a second and let me think.‚Äù

The gunfire stops. My house has several new holes in it. Mom is going to be pissed when she sees this.

‚ÄúAce! Ninja!‚Äù I scream.

All of the gremlins come down.
‚ÄúAce, Ninja. Sneak out the back with Holden. Aurora and I will distract them and give you some room to work your magic.‚Äù

Aurora interrupts.
‚ÄúStay in the woods and wait for my distraction.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is the distraction?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll know it when you see it.‚Äù

‚ÄúGo.‚Äù I say.

Holden, Ace and Ninja run to the back of the house. Snowflake chatters.
‚ÄúThe rest of you go downstairs. They are here for the vault. Make sure they don‚Äôt get to it.‚Äù

The gremlins nod and take off. I look at Aurora.
‚ÄúWhat distraction are you going to make?‚Äù

Aurora gives me a slight smile.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve been making defensive measures since the black eyed children.‚Äù

‚ÄúCool. You should‚Äôve told me.‚Äù I say.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll see. Watch.‚Äù


Wyatt and his men have reloaded and are unleashing a new wave of bullets. After that Wyatt calls out.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be stubborn like your mom. She always takes the hard way. Be smart not dumb like her.‚Äù

I lift my head closer to a broken window.
‚ÄúOk. Let‚Äôs talk percentages.‚Äù

‚ÄúNow we talkin. What do you have in mind?‚Äù Wyatt asks.

‚ÄúNinety five percent in my favor.‚Äù

Wyatt laughs.
‚ÄúLittle lady, you are out of your goddamn, fucking mind.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know about all of that. My mom did all the work collecting this stuff. We‚Äôve kept it safe so there are storage fees to discuss.‚Äù I say as I glance out the window. 

I see Wyatt shake his head.
‚ÄúYou are so much funnier than your mom, sweetheart.‚Äù

I just need to keep him talking for maybe a minute more.

‚ÄúHey, can I ask you a question?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúSure. My men need a couple more seconds to reload. Shoot.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy fuck with my mom? You have to know she has powerful allies.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou talking about the Kingdom of Dusk, the Blood Fang, the goddamn leprechauns, the fairies here and at the park, Nova and her sirens, your boy and The Pack and lastly Helsing. You‚Äôre going to have to be more specific.‚Äù

He knows everything.

‚ÄúAll of them.‚Äù I say.

Wyatt laughs.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve been watching your mom for decades at this point. I know everyone she has become buddy buddies with. In relation to all of that. I‚Äôve made plans on how to deal with each one. I got buddies too.‚Äù

In spite of myself I yell.
‚ÄúWhat is your deal with my mom? I don‚Äôt think she even understands.‚Äù

Wyatt becomes serious.
‚ÄúSpeaking for myself. I never liked her. To tell you the truth, the first time I saw her I got a funny feeling. Not ha ha funny but peculiar. Add in the fact she has been a pain in my ass for all these years don‚Äôt help. Hey, did she ever tell you about the time she was chasing me and I almost blew her up? That goddamn car of hers saved her life.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. She did.‚Äù I reply.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had some adventures. I‚Äôll miss her‚Ä¶and you.‚Äù

I look at Aurora.
‚ÄúNow.‚Äù

Aurora closes her eyes and mumbles some words I don‚Äôt understand. When done she claps her hands. The instant she claps several pillars of fire erupt from the ground. There is mass confusion as Wyatt and his men drop to the ground and roll. This is the distraction and now the boys attack. Holden leads the charge and kicks a man on the ground that had just put out the fire. Holden then picks up a man and cuts his throat with a talon. Aurora pops up and sends a fireball to awards one of the vans, upon impact it blows up. Ace swoops down and falcon punches him in the head, dropping him. I take this as my cue and run out the door and straight towards Wyatt. He had just put out his fire when I slam into him. He goes flying and lands several feet away. I then jump towards him with my hatchet high in the air. As I do this, he pulls out a gun and fires and hits me in the leg. I crumble and hit the ground as he aims again and smiles.
‚ÄúGuess your not like your mom. You brought a hatchet to a gun fight.‚Äù

Before he can do anything, Ace swoops down and hits him in the head. Wyatt rolls as he curses. I waste no time and get up and with my one good leg, I lunge at him. I land on top of him and as I do, he puts his gun under my chin.
‚ÄúThis life is brutal. Your mom should have taught you better.‚Äù

He pulls the trigger and there is only a click.
‚ÄúSeems you have your mom‚Äôs bullshit luck.‚Äù

I scream and swing my hatchet. Wyatt swings his head to the side as he swings his other hand. I miss but he hits me in the temple. Dazed, he grabs and gross me off of him. He gets up before I can and kicks me in the face. I fall backwards with my broken nose and he tips his hat.
‚ÄúUntil next time little lady.‚Äù

He grabs a gun from one of his dead men on the ground. As he runs, he fires several rounds towards Holden. As Wyatt gets in his car, Holden roars and starts running towards him. As Wyatt pulls away, Holden jumps as he does this. Artemis‚Äôs claw materializes over Holden‚Äôs right hand. The claw sinks into the trunk and Holden is dragged along. Ace flies and tries to distract Wyatt as he drives away. His car careens and power slides. This was done on purpose because Holden was slammed into a tree so hard it breaks. The impact was so great. The claw rips through the metal of the trunk and Holden is left on the ground. He starts to get up but falls. I look towards the house and point as I yell.
‚ÄúScorn go get Ace.‚Äù

Scorn flies out of a broken window and in the direction of Wyatt‚Äôs car. Many of Wyatt‚Äôs men are still here. Broken, beaten and in half of the cases, dead. Some are charred beyond recognition. Aurora walks out of the house.
‚ÄúY‚Äôall fucked around and now are going to find out.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. Call Chief Bannon.‚Äù I say.

‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. Hurry.‚Äù

As Aurora dials, Holden slowly gets up. Lilith and Fang run up to him. I totally forgot they were here. They were smart and waited for all of the gunfire to stop before running out. They surround Holden and help him up and walk towards me. When they get close I say.
‚ÄúJesus Christ, Holden. You look like Swiss cheese.‚Äù

Aurora hangs up.
‚ÄúPolice are in their way. Don‚Äôt worry about Holden. I‚Äôll take care of him. Right after I take care of you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm good. I just got hit in the leg.‚Äù I say.

‚ÄúAnd the shoulder and your one arm.‚Äù Aurora replies.

I look down and see for sure I‚Äôve been hit two more times.
‚ÄúFuck! When did that happen?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúSafe to assume during the gunfight.‚Äù Aurora deadpans.

‚ÄúHa, ha very funny. Help me up.‚Äù

Aurora helps me up and I lean my head back and yell.
‚ÄúFuck!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù Aurora asks.

‚ÄúMaddy‚Äôs party. We can‚Äôt go now. We look like ok corral survivors.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôll understand. Once she hears what happened.‚Äù

Snowflake walks up as he chatters.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm good dude. Hey, see those guys? If any of them move before the police show up. Eat thier face.‚Äù

One of the remaking men starts to scooch back.
‚ÄúJesus Christ.‚Äù

‚ÄúHoly shit. Where‚Äôs Ninja.?‚Äù I ask as I look around.

I see him by the edge of the woods standing next to a dead body. By the looks of it, there was a fight to the death. In the distance sirens could be heard. I look at Holden.
‚ÄúYou should get into the guesthouse. I doubt the hospital can or would help you in this state.‚Äù

Aurora looks at Lilith.
‚ÄúGet him in the guesthouse. Make him lay down and don‚Äôt let him move. I‚Äôll be there shortly.‚Äù

Lilith nods and starts walking Holden to the guesthouse. Fang walks behind them to guard the rear. As the sirens get closer, Aurora looks me over.
‚ÄúSeems all of the shots went clean through, not sure about the shoulder. It looks a little sus.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat all feel sus and hurt like hell.‚Äù I say as I walk towards the steps leading to the front door. I sit down.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good. Save your energy.‚Äù Aurora says as she sits down next to me. ‚ÄúSo what the fuck was that?‚Äù She asks.

I sigh.

I was disgusted with my body and decided it was time to change.

Crazy part is none of my clothes fit me anymore, started wearing my clothes from 8th grade again. Went down roughly 8-10 waist sizes

Some details about my diet is I don‚Äôt drink soda diet nor regular, I only drink coffee and water, the occasional sparkling ice or 0 calorie monster. I rarely eat sugar, but I still will eat processed foods pretty regularly as I‚Äôm a poor single dad that is a terrible cook. Weightloss has kinda stagnated, only lost 10 lbs in the last 2 months.

He is 75, super MAGA (I am not). He is retired military, but now despises the military. After retiring, he taught high school but hated it. He lives in the middle of nowhere in Arkansas, hates to eat out. Hates to go shopping. Has dogs but they are functional only - he doesn‚Äôt play with them, etc. He loves to hunt but is having trouble with his legs so it‚Äôs a touchy topic. Hunting hasn‚Äôt been fruitful lately, so that‚Äôs a source of irritation. He is a gun guy, but hates any type of gimmicky ‚Äúgun or shooting‚Äù type of gift. He is not into clothes, doesn‚Äôt run any longer (see above re:legs). He has watched multiple streaming series with my stepmom and is not a reader. Doesn‚Äôt take pictures, is not a collector of anything, is not a gourmet eater, likes plain black coffee only (nothing fancy whatsoever). 

He built four houses, owns a huge plot of land, has done things like composting worms, is very into taxidermy and wildlife stuff (tracking, animals, trees, that kind of stuff), has a food plot for deer, doesn‚Äôt super enjoy traveling. 

Things that have been fairly successful: a personalized knife (probably the best gift ‚Äì he uses it constantly and references it often), steaks, a jerky assortment, a personalized walking stick, a memory book full of pictures and my thoughts, dvds on WWII and planes. 

Even though it sounds like he is a grump, he is a great father. For multiple reasons, I would really like to hit this out of the park. Any suggestions welcome! ",2,1737730312.0,Gifts,38,0.75,False

The intent is to meet in public and see if there is any chemistry. I'm not looking for dinner or food or being stuck in a dine-in situation with someone on a blind date. I'm looking to talk and have a conversation to learn more about this person. I don't want to commit time and money to a meal where we are obligated to spend a set amount of time with each other or have pressure to leave the venue, if things hit it off.

I initially suggested meeting at a mall where we could walk around and interact in public, maybe grab a drink or coffee or something.

She came back telling me she wanted to go to a specific cafe, which is very hipster and not conducive to having a conversation, based on the lack of seating and very small dine-in area.

Weather is an issue, so outdoor activities are not available at this time.

How should I interpret this behavior? I was kind of disappointed that my match did not like my suggestion, and a little turned off by her counter-suggestion to meet at a place where I would feel uncomfortable meeting. The other thing is, I feel like we are now negotiating on a venue, rather than making sincere efforts to meet for the sake of meeting and getting to know each other better.

1i8x15u,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1i8x15u/im_feeling_burnt_out_in_my_relationship_long_read/,I‚Äôm feeling burnt out in my relationship. (Long read),"My (24M) girlfriend (23F) and I have been together for two and a half years, and I feel like I‚Äôm the only one who has ever put in the effort. Here‚Äôs some examples.

I text her every morning and say good morning, I love her, and that I hope she has a good day. Sometimes she doesn‚Äôt even respond. In her defense, I work in construction so I‚Äôm up at five or six in the morning some mornings, and she works in retail so most days she stays up late and sleeps until noon. I‚Äôm usually already up for six hours before she‚Äôs awake, but I still wish she‚Äôd say she loves me back. I‚Äôve brought up to her and she apologized and said she‚Äôd respond more often, but I‚Äôve noticed no change. Some mornings I don‚Äôt say it just to see if she‚Äôll finally tell me she loves me first, but it never comes.

We‚Äôre in a medium distance relationship. She lives about an hour away, so we usually only see each other once a week. She‚Äôll spend the night at my house during the weekend (I live in my own house I bought before we started dating, she still lives with her parents) and when she does spend the weekend with me, I drive and pick her up, and I take her home. It‚Äôs a combined four hours of driving any time she comes over. She refuses to drive herself because she‚Äôs a fairly new driver and has never driven a longer distance than 20 minutes before meeting me. I‚Äôve asked her to lighten my load a little, but any time I ask her to drive she conveniently ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt feel good‚Äù every single time I ask her to drive, yet this never happens when I say I‚Äôll come get her. 

I can already hear the argument ‚Äúyou‚Äôve been dating for two and a half years and you have your own house, why doesn‚Äôt she just move in with you?‚Äù she refuses to live under the same roof as me until we‚Äôre married. Legally and ceremonially and all. So that‚Äôs out of the question, otherwise that would solve one of the largest issues. Which is ashamed because I have plenty of space for her and live in a much nicer neighborhood than her family does, but that‚Äôs her decision and I won‚Äôt try to convince her otherwise. This was a condition she laid out from the start. But I‚Äôm also just not ready for marriage yet, financially specifically. So her moving in to combat that specific problem is off the table for now.

We both game, and we play PC together almost every night after work. However, we never play the games I want to play. We have very conflicting tastes in genres of games. I prefer co-op games or open world survival games where you just work together. She prefers competitive games and shooters, which I‚Äôve just simply never been a competitive person so I struggle to enjoy myself when playing these games. I want to relax after work, not sweat in a shooter, you know? But this doesn‚Äôt matter to her. If I want to spend time with her, I have to play the games she wants to play, and usually have to play with her friends. If I suggest a game I want to play, she says she wants to play her games with her friends. So I‚Äôve had nights where I played by myself in my own game and let her play with her friends when I didn‚Äôt want to play her games. (For those that are interested or curious, she plays games like Overwatch, Fortnite, etc. I play games like 7 Days to Die, Stardew Valley, and others of those genres.)

I even see it in the more intimate side of things. When we cuddle, I‚Äôm the one rubbing her back for her, or playing with her hair. She never does the same for me, even when I explicitly ask for it. And any time I do, it‚Äôs just half-assed. She also just never initiates. I‚Äôm always initiating everything. I want to feel wanted sometimes too. Going back all the way to the start of the relationship, I‚Äôve initiated the first everything. First contact, first date, first kiss, etc.

Even when we send each other things on Instagram, I take the time to watch the things she sends me and respond to the things she says about them, and I‚Äôll reference something I‚Äôve sent her in later conversation and she doesn‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about. She never looks at the stuff I send her, and I don‚Äôt even send much. I‚Äôll send her like two reels all day and she‚Äôll send me close to fifty, and I‚Äôll watch all of them.

I notice she‚Äôll completely ignore what I say when we‚Äôre talking. We‚Äôll be playing a game, I‚Äôll say something, and it‚Äôs like I wasn‚Äôt even talking. I‚Äôll mention something that would answer a later question she has, I‚Äôll mention what I said earlier would answer that question, and she doesn‚Äôt even know what I said. Then when I repeat what I said, it answers her question. It happens all the time. I‚Äôm just tired of it.

Every morning after she spends the night, I have to drive her to a Starbucks so she can have coffee, because she drinks coffee every morning. I don‚Äôt drink coffee, so I don‚Äôt have a coffee maker. I‚Äôve suggested to her that she should buy a little coffee maker for herself and leave it at my house, that way we don‚Äôt have to go out every morning and buy her coffee. But she says when she has me to go get her coffee, why would she bother making it in house? I said, ‚Äúwell what if I didn‚Äôt want to go drive you to get coffee?‚Äù and she said she just wouldn‚Äôt come over then, because she can‚Äôt function without coffee as she gets a headache without it because her body is so accustomed to drinking coffee every morning. This is asinine and pathetic to me frankly, but it‚Äôs another condition for being with her and I simply put up with it. I‚Äôve even offered to buy the damn coffee maker for her, but her condition for this was that it had to be a very specific coffee maker that could brew a special kind of coffee that she likes, and it was hundreds of dollars. So I just dropped it. I just can‚Äôt relate to any of this as somebody who doesn‚Äôt drink the stuff or really doesn‚Äôt understand any of it. This along with the driving were the only issues that she didn‚Äôt promise to change in some regard.

So with these other issues I‚Äôve had conversations with her about, she says she‚Äôll change, and then she doesn‚Äôt. I feel like she‚Äôs almost too comfortable with me sometimes. I‚Äôm fiercely loyal to a fault. I‚Äôve always been one to talk through my issues and work on things no matter how difficult, and she knows this. I think she thinks I won‚Äôt leave so long as she doesn‚Äôt cheat on me, so she thinks she can get away with behaving more selfishly. 

I don‚Äôt have any suspicion that she‚Äôs cheating or anything of the like. Despite my complaints of inconveniences, she‚Äôs a good person. I know she wouldn‚Äôt do that to me. I‚Äôm also her first boyfriend, and she‚Äôs also extremely sheltered and socially awkward, frankly I don‚Äôt think she could even talk to another guy let alone cheat on me with one. She didn‚Äôt have any experience with men until me, but that doesn‚Äôt excuse her lack of initiation when we‚Äôve been together for almost three years and I‚Äôve had conversations with her about it before. 

So I‚Äôve just stopped trying anymore. I don‚Äôt text her good morning anymore, I don‚Äôt text first anymore. I do my own thing. I‚Äôm not going to ask her to come over any more. If I see no change, if she doesn‚Äôt start initiating, I‚Äôll have a final conversation with her and say she needs to put in more effort, or I‚Äôm done. This is just my way of venting about it.

the one thing i hate *so much* about my eating disorder is how it causes me to compare my portions, exercise routines, weight, etc. with other people, but mostly with my sister.

my ED is constantly causing me to assume my sister has an ED too so that it has someone to *compete* with. this is so fucked up.

i've been struggling a lot with this, especially in the last week. i don't know why, but lately i feel like she's been eating less. maybe she's just not that hungry, maybe she has a stomach ache, maybe she ate more before, or maybe she's becoming disordered like me. i don't know, i hope not. i wouldn't wish this on anyone. or maybe she isn't eating less, i don't know. 

i can barely get through dinner (we both live with my parents and we all eat dinner together) without wanting to cry. she's been eating less over the last few days, and i can't help but want to sob about it.

it's so stupid to be mad at because she eats lunch and eats some snacks throughout the day, and i just get through the day with some fruit and coffee until dinner. 

sometimes she declines the snacks i offer her, sometimes she doesn't. but when she does, my brain immediately goes to ""oh she has an ED too"", ""she'll be thinner than you"", ""maybe she's anorexic too"", ""why are you eating this if she won't"". WHY WON'T MY BRAIN SHUT UP.

she is shorter than me (she's 5'3, i'm 5'6) but she is more active than me. she goes to school, sometimes works out (she lifts weights and used to be a runner), walks a lot, and i don't do anything other than wallow in my depression.

it's not fair. i look skeletal yet fat and bloated at the same time, and she always looks slim. healthy and slim. it doesn't matter what she eats, she looks good.

my eating disorder has taken away so much from me already and now it wants to take away the good relationship i have (or maybe *had*) with my sister. we were close, and now it feels like my eating disorder is pushing me away from everyone, even my sister. 

please give me advice. i can't stop crying about it all. and please don't judge me, I'm already having a hard time admitting this to anyone. thank you for reading this.",7,1737730060.0,EDAnonymous,2,0.9,False

1i8wyf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1i8wyf8/i_have_this_mind_boggling_talent_of_being/,I have this mind boggling talent of being rejected by women who have shown clear interest in me.,"
I guess above all I‚Äôm saying this out of frustration more than anything and feel like I need to vent a bit. 

More often than not, I get rejected. Meaning I go on lots of first dates but not many seconds. I‚Äôd say 60-70% of the time I get no seconds dates. I guess having ADHD can make it difficult to connect with people sometimes and well I do struggle to socialize. So you can say I‚Äôm an acquired taste. 

Of course I‚Äôve had a few girlfriends and FWBs and one nights here and there but they don‚Äôt have happen often. Most of my dating life is going on first dates with no second. 

I obviously try my best to improve my social skills and always working on my personality through reading, hobbies, meditation, gym, etc. But simply put‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs hard for me. Truly. It‚Äôs very rare for me to date or sleep with someone I‚Äôm really into. 

And well this past weekend I went on date with a very cute girl. She was a bit too shy, but I thought we connect just well. We had lunch, then coffee, walk in the park. And it eventually I held her hand and she was cool with it. Eventually I kissed and she was cool with it. We ended the date making out, and she held me tight in the car for a good 2 minutes. When I walked her to her car and said bye, she again held me tight and put her head on my chest and stayed there for a while before we said bye. Sounds all good right?

Well no, cause she hasn‚Äôt really replied to my text or shown any interest.

Before that there was a match I had with another woman, but she never did reply to me. Fine, it‚Äôs cool, no replies on apps are common. Only one time we saw each other at the club. Both recognized each other. I didn‚Äôt approach cause I thought it‚Äôll be weird to approach someone who never texted you back. Well, all of a sudden she approaches me. Says recognizes me and wanted to say hi. We talked a bit, before she decided to give me her number. We left it at that, and before she left the club she went back to me to say bye. All good right? Again no, after exchanging 
 several basic text messages she never did reply to me again. Several days I send another messages saying how you doing and again no reply. 

Before that, another woman similar to the first. Went out on a date, finished with us making out, said a nice exciting goodbye/goodnight, text me when you get home/ see you later, and then nothing.

At the moment there‚Äôs this girl I took out a few months back who‚Äôs always texting me first and really into the conversation. We have seen each other at the bar often and last time she approached me and hugged me. Closing time comes and it‚Äôs clear she waited for me outside the bar, we talk and say goodnight and go back to our friends. She then texts me ‚Äúwyd‚Äù and well you know the rest, but once I tell her to come over she stops replying. This happened like 2-3 times with this girl.

I mean I‚Äôd understand, and it wouldn‚Äôt be so frustrating, if it were me starting some of the interactions/being the first to show interests and then being rejected. That‚Äôs fine it happens. Or I‚Äôd understand if a girl rejected my kiss or something and naturally wouldn‚Äôt be interested in me for another date. 

Shit in a way I understand the behavior of these women too, I guess sometimes people get caught up in the moment, go home , think things through and realize they‚Äôre not interested‚Ä¶

I guess whatever, I‚Äôm not really blaming these women for anything‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just frustrating is all. It can really jade someone after a while. I never really know what I do right or wrong. Even on the dates that have to seconds or sex, I never know what went right. 

It‚Äôs difficult having a mental illness that makes connection difficult and not come naturally. ",7,1737729866.0,dating_advice,9,0.73,False
1i8wybr,https://i.redd.it/xfu1dym1fyee1.jpeg,What Really Happens in Davos?,"Inside the World Economic Forum's Annual Meeting

The mention of Davos often conjures images of billionaires, world leaders, and celebrities sipping champagne while discussing global inequality in designer snow boots. But beyond the clich√©s and memes, the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting in Davos is a complex and carefully orchestrated event. Let‚Äôs dig into what really happens in Davos, Switzerland, when the world‚Äôs elite descend on this tiny Alpine town.

What is Davos?
First, let‚Äôs clarify what we‚Äôre talking about. ""Davos"" is shorthand for the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting, held every January in the Swiss ski town of Davos-Klosters. This isn‚Äôt your average conference. It‚Äôs a gathering of political leaders, business titans, academics, NGOs, activists, and even the occasional celebrity to discuss pressing global issues, from climate change and economic inequality to artificial intelligence and global health.

The WEF, founded in 1971 by Klaus Schwab, describes its mission as ‚Äúimproving the state of the world.‚Äù Whether it achieves that lofty goal is up for debate, but the sheer concentration of influence in one small village is undeniable.

What Happens in the Sessions?
1. Panels and Discussions
The official agenda includes hundreds of panels, keynote speeches, and roundtable discussions. These sessions feature heavy hitters like CEOs, heads of state, Nobel laureates, and activists. Topics range from ""Harnessing AI for Good"" to ""Averting the Next Global Recession"" and ""Accelerating Climate Action.""

One recent standout session was the 2023 panel on greenwashing in corporate climate pledges, where activists directly challenged major corporations to turn rhetoric into action. Such panels often spark public debates well beyond the walls of Davos.

While some sessions are livestreamed, many are private and off-the-record. That‚Äôs where the real conversations‚Äîoften the boldest and most controversial‚Äîhappen.

2. Networking, Networking, and More Networking
Davos is as much about the hallways as it is about the conference rooms. Many deals, collaborations, and partnerships are born over coffee or at exclusive after-parties. Whether it‚Äôs a tech mogul meeting a policymaker or an NGO leader pitching their cause to a philanthropist, the true currency of Davos is connections.

For example, Microsoft‚Äôs CEO used the 2019 Davos meeting to announce its $500 million initiative to help address the global housing crisis, developed in conversations with both private-sector leaders and urban policymakers during the event.

Behind Closed Doors: The Real Power Plays
While the public-facing agenda is packed with ambitious goals, the private meetings are where the heavy lifting happens. For example:

Policy Discussions: Government officials meet to align on trade agreements or geopolitical strategies. For instance, in 2020, Davos hosted a pivotal U.S.-China trade discussion that influenced the tone of their economic relations.
Deals and Investments: CEOs and investors often announce or negotiate massive deals. For example, at the 2022 meeting, India‚Äôs renewable energy sector secured billions in international funding commitments.
Influence Building: Activists and thought leaders use Davos as a platform to influence those with power and money. Greta Thunberg‚Äôs fiery speeches at Davos are now legendary, putting climate justice at the top of the event‚Äôs agenda.

The mix of open dialogue and closed-door meetings creates a blend of transparency and exclusivity that fuels both progress and criticism.

Who Goes to Davos?
Attendees are often referred to as ‚ÄúDavos Man,‚Äù a tongue-in-cheek term coined by political scientist Samuel Huntington to describe the globally minded elite who thrive in interconnected markets. But the guest list has expanded in recent years.

Some Key Attendee Groups:
World Leaders: Presidents, prime ministers, and central bankers. For instance, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen were key speakers in 2023.
Corporate Titans: CEOs of companies like Microsoft, JPMorgan, and Coca-Cola. In 2022, Elon Musk notably criticized the event, branding it ‚Äúboring,‚Äù while still participating in discussions remotely.
NGOs and Activists: Greenpeace, Amnesty International, and high-profile activists like Malala Yousafzai bring human rights, environmental, and social justice issues to the forefront.
Celebrities: Bono, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Will.i.am have all attended in advocacy roles, using their influence to highlight issues like poverty and climate change.
Journalists: Reporters from outlets like The New York Times, BBC, and CNBC cover the action, often shining a light on what‚Äôs happening behind the carefully worded press releases.

What About the Criticism?
Davos isn‚Äôt without controversy. Critics argue that it‚Äôs an elitist event where the rich and powerful talk more than they act. Some call it a ‚Äútalk shop‚Äù that offers little in the way of tangible solutions. Others highlight the hypocrisy of discussing climate change while private jets flood the local airport.

Protestors also flock to Davos each year, decrying economic inequality, environmental destruction, and the growing gap between rhetoric and action. For example, in 2023, activists dressed as oil executives threw fake money in the air to protest the perceived inaction on fossil fuel dependence.

Does Anything Tangible Come Out of Davos?
Despite the skepticism, Davos does produce results. Here are a few examples of tangible outcomes:

COVAX Initiative: During the pandemic, the WEF played a key role in launching COVAX, which distributed COVID-19 vaccines to low-income countries.
Partnership for Global Education: In 2015, the WEF helped broker the $2 billion partnership to improve education for children in developing nations.
Climate Action Announcements: At the 2023 Davos, several companies announced plans to become carbon neutral by 2030, including tech firms and energy giants.

The Perks and the Parties
Let‚Äôs not ignore the lighter (or shall we say, more indulgent) side of Davos. Extravagant parties hosted by tech companies, luxury brands, and even governments are part of the culture. Think champagne, gourmet food, and live music‚Äîthough some events have toned down the excess in response to criticism.

And yes, people do ski. After all, it‚Äôs Davos.

Davos in the Age of Change
In recent years, the WEF has faced increasing pressure to diversify its attendee base and focus on action over discussion. Climate change, economic inequality, and the rise of populism have shifted the tone of Davos from celebration to urgency.

Still, for better or worse, Davos remains a focal point for global decision-making. While not everyone agrees on its effectiveness, the sheer concentration of power, wealth, and influence ensures that what happens in Davos doesn‚Äôt stay in Davos‚Äîit echoes across the world.

Conclusion
Davos isn‚Äôt just about power lunches and photo ops. It‚Äôs a unique forum where global leaders, CEOs, and activists gather to shape the world‚Äôs trajectory. Whether they succeed or fail is a debate that continues long after the snow melts in Switzerland.

Weight gain and acne. Feel slow. Can‚Äôt remember shit. Can‚Äôt stop eating. I can‚Äôt help but think my pysch earlier this year did this on purpose ‚Äî gave me Prozac. I was doing so fine but then I drank multiple coffee drinks and fell into manic psychosis where I thought people were out to get me. I hate that I have relative ideation and it can be hard to differentiate what people say. Now that I got bipolar, I feel like I can‚Äôt live or move away and start a new job. I feel stuck. I don‚Äôt like the jobs I‚Äôm in right now, I regret so much that I turned down this job in ATL a few months before my manic episode. Somehow I wonder that if I took that job, moved in with a friend (I had family and friend support) then this manic episode wouldnt have happened and I would still be in contact with the guy I loved. Ever since then I‚Äôve been struggling to make decisions, know what my passions are, know what my direction in life is. I literally feel so ugly bc of my weight gain and acne, I don‚Äôt feel like who I was. I got this teaching job offer in NYC and it‚Äôs a really hard job that is about 60hours per week bc of lesson plans and preparations. I don‚Äôt even think I can do that type of job anymore. Like I feel like I won‚Äôt adjust anymore it‚Äôs so sad. I had that opportunity to leave and I was too hung up on the possibility of the guy to move to Atlanta. I also asked too many people for opinions and lost my own sense of direction. I internalize what people say so easily. I‚Äôm so fucking scared about my life right now. I plan on getting of lithium bc I don‚Äôt like it. It‚Äôs been about it‚Äôs been like 6 months on it since June 25. I don‚Äôt know what to do, I keep ruminating on past mistakes with guy (like I could have had it all but I messed up- part of me thinks I was manic while talking to him hence emotionally reactive/triggered a lot), not taking the ATL job (was my ticket to a way out but didn‚Äôt take it), bipolar diagnosis taking away my self confidence, self esteem, everything I had. I thought I knew what my life would be like. I‚Äôm 29 and so scared. I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm wasting my life away. It‚Äôs like I lost desire or don‚Äôt know what I want anymore. I‚Äôm not depressed. I‚Äôm just in a bad situation. Yes, these thoughts make me want to stay in bed but I do eventually get up and go on about my day. I can‚Äôt take it anymore. I have therapy and have done partial hospitalization for like 2 months. This sucks. I‚Äôm stuck. I start this other part time job next week‚Äî I‚Äôll be busy from 9-6 everyday. I don‚Äôt get any other full time job offers even though I apply. One of the part time jobs I‚Äôm at I just sit there ruminating since there‚Äôs nothing to do. It‚Äôs like damn I should be writing a novel there but I just can‚Äôt do it. I also am self aware to notice and analyze why things happen and what action/reaction caused things to occur and it‚Äôs my downfall. I don‚Äôt know. I gained like 20 pounds in 7 months. I was able to travel abroad and live alone and cook on my own when in my early 20‚Äôs and now bc of this I‚Äôve lost so much. 8 months ago I had a possible job opportunity across the country but I let the ball drop. I was scared to move. Or unmotivated. I don‚Äôt know moving is now the most ideal for me now bc of this bipolar thing! Things have gotten worst and I‚Äôm getting more into a hole. I don‚Äôt know if I can do this anymore. I‚Äôm definitely getting off Lithium for sure. Maybe spend a month unmedicated. But who knows. Somethings wrong with me. Someone help.

To them literally going out on a holiday trip without me, without telling me (I found out by accident...), not giving a sh\*t/not knowing what to respond when I confronted them about it on our last meeting before New Year's Eve, and not even reaching out to me when I left the group chat.

A little more context: one of them got separated from his gf (28 F) around the time I mentioned, and since then he's been more and more distant with me. He was usually the main proponent/planner of our meetings, and since ""the breakup"" happened, him and the other one have been mostly meeting up with this other group of friends I know, but they pretty much never invite me in on their agenda. I'm on a different group chat with all of them, and it's been infuriating seeing them plan all these activities week after week and then not being able to do basic sh\*t like meeting with me.

They barely message me anymore (usually when a topic comes out it's me starting it on the group chat or DMing one of them directly).

A couple months ago, I end up finding out (on the freaking WEDDING of a relative of one of my ""friends"", that's how close we were before) that they are planning this holiday trip and it's pretty much already set. They never even allude to the possibility of me joining...

Come NYE party, I jokingly start ribbing them for it, and start getting more worked up when they try to deflect/avoid the topic, to the point of actually getting angry and chewing them out.

One of them brings out something that happened last time I went on a trip with them and this other group (which was more than half a decade ago btw, and which is or SHOULD BE buried six feet under). 

I bring the fact that it was a videogame console's life span ago, and I have been multiple times on a group with EVERYONE involved on the trip without issues. They don't know what to respond, tell me I'm being a nag and that I should change the subject.

I leave the WhatsApp group the next day.

Literal radio silence from them, for ten days.

I want to make things right with them. Visit one of them one day, on his home, really just want to talk about things and try to see what's going on. We go to a coffee shop and order something. He plays dumb about it, and I'm too big of a chicken to bring it up.

I propose we go get dinner one night to talk about it. This time I make allusion to what happened, tell them I want things to remain the way they were between us. They agree and we have a relatively normal night out.

Cut to the present. They're out on their trip, posting IG stories and having a grand ol' time without me. I messaged them once on their first day. They said some basic NPC sh\*t and then went and have been radio silent on the group since then.

I see their IG stories, trying to act all cool and chat up chicks and pose for the camera with their new ""besties"". What the hell?

\---

I don't know what to do. I've been losing sleep and feeling incredibly depressed this past month due to all this stupid drama going on. And I'm pretty sure they don't even register that, nor care about it.

It's so unfair. We spent so many years and made so many memories together. Been through so much. One of them, R, felt like a brother to me.

I'm at a point where I want revenge against them, making them feel as shitty as I do right now typing all this. I know it's pointless, and to be honest I don't think I could bring myself or think about any way to ""get even"".

I hate them right now, and don't know what to do. I feel like they took something precious, an effigy we've been building for a decade and a half and took a huge rancid toxic sh\*tty dump over it.

\---

**TL;DR:** One of my best friends has a break up with his SO. Since then, him and another friend of mine are completely prioritizing a different friend group and pretty much ditching me for them. They are currently on a holiday trip with them, and I wasn't even supposed to find out about it apparently. I confronted them about it and they didn't know/didn't care what to respond. They have been radio silent for a while now, even though I implied I didn't want things to change between us and we ""made peace"" since that previous event. I feel like shit and don't know how to cope or what to do.

Today‚Äôs my fasting day in week 3 of ADF. Usually I do M-W-F and eat on other days. But today, I broke my fast around 18 hours mark in the afternoon because I was in my office‚Äôs year end lunch and it was really hard to not eat at all. So I had half a bowl of tonkatsu with rice. Other than that, I am still consuming coffee + monkfruit extract and water. Nothing else.

The half tonkatsu rice bowl is estimated to be around 320cal, \~10g proteins, and 35g carb. So my fasting today isn‚Äôt totally derailed although not ideal. I guess I will still get benefits of calorie restrictions but not autophagy. I will continue fasting until 10AM tomorrow to compensate and realign (so that‚Äôs another 18 hours, total 36‚Ä¶).

And this weekend I will do 18:6 to compensate if I can. And only eat high-protein, moderate fat, and lower carb meals.

Our jobs are in critical areas. Many of these jobs cannot be outsourced or filled by non-citizen H1B workers. Despite this, federal employees are often paid less than their private sector counterparts, and we receive few perks. For example, I have to purchase my own coffee and, when I started, had to bring in my own desk and chair since the ones provided were falling apart. Many of us choose federal service because we are patriots who take pride in serving our country.

Yet, what I often see on the news are claims from the right that federal employees are overpaid and lazy. Ironically, these same voices advocate for the continued use of H1B employees, many of whom work in the tech industry with extravagant compensation packages and perks that federal workers can only dream of.

I recognize the importance of H1B workers and don't wish to criticize them. However, as a party that champions an ""America First"" agenda, I can't help but question why Republicans are so quick to attack American federal employees who are serving our nation while defending H1B workers.

This post explores what a Personal Board of Directors is, why it‚Äôs transformative for leaders, and how to build one tailored to your needs.  

---

Have you ever felt stuck when making a big decision, unsure how to navigate a challenge, or simply wished for a sounding board to refine your ideas? Many of the most successful leaders‚Äîwhether they‚Äôre executives, entrepreneurs, or changemakers‚Äîdon‚Äôt go it alone. They rely on what‚Äôs often called a *Personal Board of Directors* (PBOD).  

This concept, inspired by the formal boards that guide organizations, applies the same principles to individual growth and leadership. A PBOD isn‚Äôt about hierarchy or authority; it‚Äôs about surrounding yourself with people who challenge, support, and guide you toward your goals.  

### What is a Personal Board of Directors?  

A PBOD is a carefully selected group of individuals who offer advice, accountability, and fresh perspectives tailored to your career or personal aspirations. Unlike traditional mentorship, this network is diverse and multi-faceted, bringing together mentors, peers, industry experts, and personal supporters to address different aspects of your growth.  

### Why You Need One  

Here‚Äôs how a Personal Board of Directors can transform your leadership journey:  

1. **Diverse Perspectives:** A PBOD provides a range of insights, helping you see blind spots and explore innovative solutions.  
2. **Accountability:** Regular engagement with your advisors ensures you stay on track and committed to your goals.  
3. **Skill Development:** Your board members can help you strengthen areas where you want to grow, offering tailored feedback and guidance.  
4. **Career Navigation:** Trusted advisors can provide clarity on career moves, industry trends, and leadership strategies.  
5. **Support During Challenges:** Whether you‚Äôre facing setbacks or tough decisions, a PBOD offers a safe space to work through obstacles with resilience.  

### How to Build Your Personal Board of Directors  

If this idea resonates with you, here‚Äôs how to get started:  

üåü **Identify Your Needs**  
Think about where you want to grow. Do you need strategic advice, emotional support, or technical expertise? Your goals should guide the type of advisors you seek.  

üåç **Seek Diverse Voices**  
Diversity in experience, industry, and thought is key. Consider including:  
- A mentor with deep expertise in your field.  
- A peer who understands your challenges firsthand.  
- Someone from a different industry who can bring fresh perspectives.  
- A coach who can challenge and inspire your growth.  
- A trusted friend or family member for emotional support.  

üìû **Reach Out and Build Relationships**  
Most people are honored to be asked for their advice or perspective. Start by reaching out for a conversation, sharing your goals, and explaining how their input would make a difference.  

üìÖ **Set Up Regular Check-Ins**  
Consistency is key. Schedule regular touchpoints‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs quarterly one-on-ones or informal coffee chats. These meetings should be meaningful, goal-oriented, and mutually beneficial.  

üîÑ **Evolve Your Board Over Time**  
Your needs will change as you grow. Reassess your board periodically and adjust its composition to align with your evolving goals.  

### Real-World Examples  

Successful leaders often credit their trusted networks for their achievements:  
- Oprah Winfrey speaks about her ‚Äúcouncil of advisors‚Äù who guide her in both personal and professional endeavors.  
- Richard Branson emphasizes the value of seeking advice from mentors and peers to drive innovation within Virgin Group.  
- Sheryl Sandberg has highlighted the importance of honest, challenging feedback from trusted colleagues.  

### Tips for Success  

- **Be Respectful of Their Time:** Come prepared to meetings with clear goals and updates.  
- **Offer Value in Return:** Look for ways to support your advisors, whether through introductions, insights, or gratitude.  
- **Stay Open to Feedback:** Growth requires vulnerability. Be ready to hear constructive criticism and act on it.  
- **Show Gratitude:** A simple thank-you goes a long way in maintaining strong relationships.  

### Let‚Äôs Discuss  

What do you think about the idea of a Personal Board of Directors? Do you already have a similar network, or are you inspired to create one? I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts, experiences, or questions. Let‚Äôs start a conversation about how we can all grow through connection and collaboration!

The fake leather seats sweat with late August humidity, and my backpack, slunk over one shoulder, slaps against the back of each seat as I walk from the last row toward the door. I share the stop with Jenna, who, when we were in elementary school, had a trampoline in her backyard, and Michael, whom, when we were toddlers, I was forbidden from playing with because his brother told my brother that the only way to heaven is through Jesus Christ. I walk down the road behind Jenna and Michael. My house comes before theirs on the dead end road. To the west are the homes and the river. To the east is the woods.¬†

My parents bought the house just after they were married. At the time, it was a small two bedroom home with access to the basement from the outside. As their family grew, so did the house, and by the time I had come into being, my dad had doubled the house‚Äôs size, but failed to install central air conditioning.¬†

My grandpa helped my dad build the house. Together they formed a unique beautiful ranch home with vaulted ceilings and large picture windows over the front door. My mom designed the landscaping. A large Oak tree, with a zinnia garden at the base of its trunk, was on one side of the front lawn. A pond, surrounded by several varieties of ferns and hostas, was on the other. The sidewalk stretched from the front gate along the large detached garage and up to the front steps.¬†

¬†I walk up the front porch and through the red front door into the foyer. My mom sits at the kitchen peninsula, her back to me, her head tilted upward, eyes squinting in the sunlight that streams through the skylights, her right elbow planted on the counter, a cigarette dangling from her right hand, smoke dancing in the streams of light. I take off my shoes and leave them on the ground in the foyer.¬†

‚ÄòPut your fucking shoes away,‚Äô she says. She doesn‚Äôt turn her head. She doesn‚Äôt move her arms. She just sits as still as a lion before it pounces.¬†

I ignore her and walk through the kitchen. I rummage through the cabinets and fridge to find some food. She doesn‚Äôt move. Her cigarette, still dangling from her hand, grows a long ash that falls onto the countertop next to the Dave and Buster‚Äôs ashtray I gave to her on my 10th birthday.¬†

‚ÄòEating. Always eating. No wonder you‚Äôre so fat,‚Äô she says. ‚ÄòI could tell it was you when you walked through the door. You open the door fat. You walk fat.‚Äô

I stop looking for food. ‚ÄòFuck you,‚Äô I say. I walk to my room. I slam the door. I lock it. 	I clear the floor in front of my door, brushing dirty laundry, old children‚Äôs books, action figures and fish tank accessories aside with my foot, and pull my dresser over in front of the door. I brace the dresser with a two by four I keep under my bed against my bed frame. I put my backpack on the desk my dad made for me. I open the two windows, turn on my ceiling and oscillating fans, and find Harry the Orangutan, my favorite childhood stuffed animal.

¬†I sit on my bed with him and lift his arm, revealing a hole in his armpit. I dig around inside his stuffing and pull out a small bag of weed, a lighter and a pipe I made out of a dowel rod scrap from my dad‚Äôs bin in the garage. I pull a box from under my bed that has empty toilet paper rolls, rubber bands and dryer sheets and quickly make a filter to breathe out through. I turn on the Dark Side of the Moon and take as long of a drag from my pipe as I can. I lay on my bed and stare at the ceiling fan.

*Two more years,* I think. *Just two more years.*¬†

    I lay there as tingles pass through my body in waves that start from the small of my back and roll up through my shoulders. I raise and lower my back with them. Over and over and I follow the sensation with my back, and I let my mind wander. *When I see the fan, I know it's there. But if I don‚Äôt see it, is it there?* I wonder. *What would Ricky think?*¬†

Ricky is the best to be high with. Once, we went to the grocery store and bought a box of Bubba Burgers and eight burger buns. We grilled the burgers, smoked a bowl and ate them all on his back patio. We would play guitar poorly and sing Jason Mraz at the top of our lungs. We once ate a whole bag of potato chips while lying on his bed. ‚ÄòRicky,‚Äô I said ‚ÄòI just found the best way to eat a chip.‚Äô He looked at me, opened his eyes wide and stared at me. ‚ÄòCharlie. What is it?‚Äô he said. I took one chip in my hand and extended my arm over my head. ‚ÄòStart like this,‚Äô I said, ‚Äòand then slowly, very slowly, while staring at the chip the whole time, move the chip to your mouth.‚Äô Ricky took a chip in his hand, extended it above his head, and at the pace of a sloth, lowered the chip into his mouth. ‚ÄòIt builds the anticipation, and nothing tastes better than anticipation,‚Äô I said.¬†

I become anxious to be with Ricky, laying on his bed with him, listening to Led Zeppelin and eating chips. I was anxious to be anywhere other than here. He is at work today. Danny is with his girlfriend. So is Adam. So is Mike. Nick and Josh are at Vinny‚Äôs, and though I can go there, Vinny‚Äôs basement smells like cat urine, and his parents won‚Äôt let me spend the night. I text Ricky to let me know when he gets off work.¬†

I hear my doorknob start to rattle then a knock. ‚ÄòWhat?‚Äô I say.¬†

‚ÄòIt‚Äôs Dad. I‚Äôm going to work.‚Äô

‚ÄòOkay. Give me a minute.‚Äô I put the weed and pipe back into Harry‚Äôs armpit and put him in my closet. I undo my barricade and open the door. ‚ÄòIs there any dinner?‚Äô

‚ÄòYour mother didn‚Äôt make any.‚Äô

‚ÄòAre there any leftovers?‚Äô

‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know Charlie. Why don‚Äôt you look.‚Äô

‚ÄòMom‚Äôs in there and she‚Äôs drunk again.‚Äô

He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. ‚ÄòShe‚Äôs asleep on the couch now. You should be okay.‚Äô¬†

‚ÄòWhen are you sending her back to rehab?‚Äô

‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know Char‚Äì‚Äô

‚ÄòFuck you both.‚Äô Mom sits up on the couch and grabs her pack of cigarettes.‚ÄòFuck you Steve. Fuck you Charlie,‚Äô she says.

‚ÄòI‚Äôm going,‚Äô says Dad. ‚ÄòLet Rick know that he needs to get his laundry out of the washing machine.‚Äô

‚ÄòI don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs home,‚Äô I say.

‚ÄòFuck Rick too!‚Äô Mom‚Äôs voice grew louder ‚ÄòThe maid quit! He can do his own damn laundry.‚Äô She fumbles with her pack of cigarettes and finds it empty. ‚ÄòSteve, give me cigarettes.‚Äô

‚ÄòLet me know if things get really bad,‚Äô Dad says to me and begins to walk away.

‚ÄòSteve! I said give me some god-damn cigarettes!‚Äô¬†

‚ÄòJesus Christ, Carolyn!‚Äô he yells. ‚ÄòI bought you three packs this morning. How the hell did you smoke three packs today? What did you do all day?‚Äô

‚ÄòThe maid quit!‚Äô she says.

Dad tosses a pack of cigarettes toward her. They bounce off the top of the back of the couch and hit her in the shoulder. She exclaims in pain, grabs her arm and doubles over onto the floor. ‚ÄòYou fucking asshole! You abusive fucking asshole!‚Äô¬†

He turns back to me. ‚ÄòI packed your lunch. It‚Äôs in the fridge. If you leave tonight, bring it with you.‚Äô

‚ÄòDo you have any cash?‚Äô I ask.

‚ÄòWhat do you need cash fo‚Äì‚Äô¬†¬†

Mom interrupts him. ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs a fucking asshole who takes all the money. Where‚Äôs my money, Steve? Where‚Äôs my credit card, Steve? Where‚Äôs my car, Steve?‚Äô She sobs between words, still clutching her arm and laying on the ground.

‚ÄòI gotta go,‚Äô he says and walks to the front door. I grab my backpack and follow him.

‚ÄòI‚Äôm leaving too,‚Äô I say.

‚ÄòGrab your lunch,‚Äô he says, ‚Äòand text me where you end up.‚Äô

‚ÄòI will. It will probably be Ricky‚Äôs, or maybe Nick‚Äôs.‚Äô

Dad leaves the house but the smell of Brute, his favorite drugstore cologne, lingers behind him. It's his working smell. His leaving smell. He has several smells. His Christmas smell is cedar and kerosene, which he wears while making adirondack chairs in the garage as Christmas gifts for one of my nine sets of aunts and uncles. His out in public smell is cigarettes and coffee. His off day smell is barley and hops.

He works midnights as an airplane maintenance manager for United Airlines. He started as a mechanic at a small area airport, but when he asked my grandpa for Mom‚Äôs hand in marriage, Grandpa told him he needed to get a real job in order to support her. So Dad applied at United. Over the years, he worked to get a promotion so that he could make more money.¬†

He wasn‚Äôt happy though. Soon after his promotion he had to fire Pedro, his work friend. I liked Pedro. He would be at our house sometimes when I would get home from¬† elementary school, sitting on the dock with a fishing pole leaning against the railing, a Miller Lite in one hand. ‚ÄòHeyyyyyy Chuck,‚Äô he would say, ‚Äòthey‚Äôre biting today.‚Äô I would sit and fish with Pedro in the fall. ‚ÄòSee that ripple there?‚Äô ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs the discharge pipe from the water treatment plant. It stirs up all the muck on the bottom of the river, and the little fish come and eat it up. If there are little fish there, there are big fish there to eat them!‚Äô When Pedro stopped coming, I asked Dad why. ‚ÄòI have to pay the bills,‚Äô he said bluntly.¬†

I grab my lunch, stuff it into my backpack and leave the house, my mother still yelling, and swearing at me as I close the door. I see Jerry, our next door neighbors to the left, leaving his garage and walking to his front door. We make eye contact and he shakes his head and walks inside. It's dark out now, and I text my brother Rick not to come home. I then text Ricky again to call me when he gets off work.¬†

I meander through the neighborhood, passing the homes of my friends. I see Kim, Nick‚Äôs mom, through their living room window, watching TV, but Nick‚Äôs car isn‚Äôt in the driveway. I pass Adam‚Äôs dad‚Äôs house. All of the lights are out, and Adam is only there every other weekend. Josh‚Äôs kitchen light is on, but his mom‚Äôs voice carries through the front door and she is not in a good mood. I walk for hours until I return to Giant Oak Dr. I stand at the end of my driveway and see, through the front kitchen window, my mother sitting at the kitchen peninsula, her back to me, her elbow resting on the counter, her hand raised in the air, a cigarette dangling from her fingers.",1,1737728503.0,Memoir,0,1.0,False

That is, GDP accounts for wealth in the country where it is consumed rather than where it is produced, which seems to be a problem.

1i8wdox,https://i.redd.it/iy23x5saayee1.jpeg,I took a family member to dinner at Once Upon a Time in France. I was a little bit reluctant because I remembered that there may have been a scandal. Oh boy!,"But since it was their special day, of course we would go. We were sat in a crappy little room off the main that was so cold that we had to wear outerwear. The waitress tried to do this sexy French theatrical thing that was super uncomfortable but so what. I don't understand why she needed to wear a 3-in skirt with hose and look like she was in a Robert Palmer video, but I just thought, maybe I don't understand the French.

We figured we would get a tiny little salami appetizer, two non-alcoholic beers, and the classic beef steak with fries.

The only good thing I can say is that the non-alcoholic beers were absolutely delicious. 

I didn't expect the appetizer to be big but it came with six pieces of meat and two of the thinnest slices of bread that I'd ever seen. It was like bread was $45 a loaf or something. But it tasted really nice. 

It then took 45 minutes for us to see our server before our food came. We had ordered medium rare and both of our steaks were basically Pittsburgh and cold in the middle. We decided to suffer through that since we couldn't see any staff members and both of our steaks were so fatty and grisly that they were nearly impossible to cut through. My partner's steak was about 3/4 just garbage that couldn't be eaten. The fries that came with were so overcooked that they were nearly inedible as well with probably three to four times the amount of salt that you usually use in a restaurant. I ate about half of mine because I was starving and by the end I had one of those little sores on the side of your tongue you get when you eat too much salt.

We didn't see a staff member for another 45 minutes and they asked how the meal was and I said well we can't eat this because it's absolutely terrible. They said they would comp us for one of the meals and would we like coffee. I said we don't want any fucking coffee because we need to go home and eat. Not even a whisper of an apology. 

When we got home. I searched and found the post about this place and it all checks out. Somehow. Nashville foodies want to protect this place. I'll tell you what, it just needs to be shut down. There is some hinky shit going on. It smells like sex and cocaine and scandal.

I'm going back to my usual restaurants which are mostly Middle Eastern, Latino, and Asian family-owned stuff which never let me down. This place is comically disgusting. ",140,1737728262.0,nashville,95,0.94,False

The men appraised her.

‚ÄúFollow us,‚Äù said the bandanna man.

They went slowly down a street of broken cobblestone, swishing their flashlights back and forth. The buildings on either side were boarded up, or their windows smashed out. The humid cold slipped through her jacket like a knife. She felt a twinge of hate for the country‚Äôs weather. This was what the troops had endured for years‚Äîwhat she had endured for years. Suicides on the front were at an all-time high. People came. People died. They were always cold.

She was aware of her limp and tried to hide it by using the ball of her left foot. Her trekking days were over, but she compensated with jujitsu and a deadly striking game. The men did not seem to notice or care about her handicap. Did they even know who she was?

They stopped their urban journey for a rest in the boxed circle of what was once a little park. In the circle was a dried fountain centered with the statuette of a nymph lifting a delicate foot out of the dusty and leaf-scattered pool.

‚ÄúSit. Rest,‚Äù the bandana man said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine,‚Äù she said.

He sighed and sat down.

The bearded man stepped away, lifted his gun, and scanned their perimeter. ‚ÄúTime is short.‚Äù He spoke with an American accent.

‚ÄúPlease, Madame President,‚Äù said the bandanna man.

They knew.

‚ÄúWe wait here a little.‚Äù He shrugged off his backpack and took out a thermos. ‚ÄúCoffee?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, thank you,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúIt not poison. If I want kill you, I just cut throat. Or shoot you in head. But throat more fun.‚Äù

‚ÄúTry,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúSee. Already I like you.‚Äù He laughed. ‚ÄúNobody knows you are here.‚Äù

There was noise from the outer shadow. In a blur, he had his pistol in his hand. The bearded man swung around, catching a broken window in his spotlight. A second later, a black cat jumped up to balance on the ledge. It eyed them still as stone, mewed twice, then jumped down and vanished on its prowl.

The bearded man took a deep breath. ‚ÄúFucking cats.‚Äù He let out a dry chuckle.

The bandanna man produced a cloth, which he laid out on the stone, then put down two silver coffee cups. He carefully filled the cups then the lid of the thermos. He spoke something in Georgian. The bearded man took the lid and drank on his watch.

‚ÄúPlease.‚Äù He gestured. ‚ÄúThe last time president of United States come to front lines, daddy wasn‚Äôt glint in Dedushka‚Äôs glass eye.‚Äù He smiled.

She stared at him, trying to dredge up faces from the hours of intelligence research. ‚ÄúGeneral Orlov is your father?‚Äù

‚ÄúDa, one and only. He send greeting. And good coffee.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhich son are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúAlexi.‚Äù

‚ÄúColonel Alexi Orlov?‚Äù

‚ÄúGeneral now. I get promotion after smart drone put missile into Dima‚Äôs camping tent. War crime. Is okay. Maybe drone think fishing pole is gun.‚Äù

‚ÄúGeneral Dima is dead?‚Äù Her heart skipped a beat. Next to his father, Vladimir Orlov, Dima Orlov was the single most important leader in the Federation of Eastern European Nations. He had been the mastermind of the Western push after the Battle of Tbilisi and the number one target of the Allies.

‚ÄúWhen did it happen?‚Äù

‚ÄúSummer.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for your loss,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúIs okay. Not alone. Lenya and Kiril were with him. Was Lenya‚Äôs birthday. Ten years old.‚Äù

She sat down. ‚ÄúChrist, I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

He shrugged. ‚ÄúIs war. Dirty business. If we had autonomous drones, maybe we do same.‚Äù

She picked up the silver cup, nodded to him, and sipped. Strong, hot, and sweet.

Next, he took from his bag a tin box and opened it. Shining his light inside, she saw little cookies dusted with powdered sugar. He ate one.

The accusation in the air did not need to be said. Used legally, AI drones were a more humane way to wage war. They were accurate and could easily identify a fishing pole from a gun, a fishing trip from a military camp, and children from soldiers. Either Alexi was lying, or there had been a major cover-up.

She ate a cookie. It was good with the coffee.

‚ÄúYou promised your people you end war,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúEnd it or win it,‚Äù she replied.

‚ÄúThere is no winning. Not for anyone. You know that.‚Äù

She did know it. ‚ÄúWe can negotiate,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúAlso, no negotiation.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen why? What do you want?‚Äù

He held up his hand, displaying their dismal surroundings. ‚ÄúThis was cute little park. My mother bring me here when I am child.‚Äù He grew quiet, looking at his hands, fingertips powdered in white. ‚ÄúWhat do _you_ want?‚Äù he asked with a war-weary look.

‚ÄúMe?‚Äù

He nodded.

She thought quickly. ‚ÄúA ceasefire. Through the new year.‚Äù

He shook his head. ‚ÄúFrom your Thanksgiving Day to your Christmas Day. One month. Don‚Äôt want soldiers get lazy.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúDeal.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd General Orlov wants backchannel.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt. The allies would never agree.‚Äù

He looked down at the cookies and coffee. ‚ÄúYou want to stop war? You must do what is hard.‚Äù

She tried to calculate the possible fallout should an unauthorized backchannel ever be discovered. There were too many variables. Too many actors on the stage, and she didn‚Äôt have time. ‚ÄúDeal,‚Äù she said.

Alexi smiled. Nodded. Drank his coffee.

Hope coursed through her. If this could happen, it would be the longest ceasefire in fifty years. They could give the troops a real Thanksgiving dinner. Rotate some of them home. But more important, it was a foot in the door for negotiations. It set a precedence. She held out her hand. He studied it, then shook it. And he did not let go. He squeezed harder. Brought his face close to hers and said, ‚ÄúThank you. Do not forget.‚Äù

‚ÄúI will not,‚Äù she said.

They finished the coffee and cookies. He packed up, but before he stood, he said, ‚ÄúOff record. Between you and me, can I ask?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúDid USA nuke my city?‚Äù The tone was a sincere question, and her mind swam at its implications.

‚ÄúNo, we did not,‚Äù she said firmly, truthfully.

He nodded and shrugged.

‚ÄúAlexi,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúthe Allies did not drop the bomb that day.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe too did not drop bomb. Maybe dark ops, deep states, FEEN, Allies‚Ä¶ Who knows? Radiation under bridge, like water. Let‚Äôs go. Is time.‚Äù

They wove through streets strewn with debris and burned-out cars, down passages, and across courtyards. The fog never lifted.

At a dead end, the man with the beard stopped. He painted his light over something in front of them. At first, she thought it was the side of a building, though its color and texture were out of place with the surrounding brick and cement construction.

‚ÄúThe wall,‚Äù whispered Alexi.

They approached cautiously, guns at the ready.

At its base, the street was destroyed, leaving chunks of stone and gravel as if it had come up from beneath like a root. The buildings on either side were likewise torn through. The structure was black and vesicular as lava stone, and at the proper angles, their flashlights brought out a glint of obsidian, a glimmer of dark opalescence.

She looked up to where it continued into the murky night and fog. When she reached out to touch it, Alexi grabbed her wrist and shook his head.

The men let out tells of nervousness in the way they moved, pointing their guns at the shadows.

‚ÄúThis is it,‚Äù said the bearded man.

Alexi lifted his gun and turned a complete circle, taking in the area as if he were expecting to be rushed at any moment.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget, Madame President,‚Äù he reiterated, resting a strong hand on her shoulder. ‚ÄúCode word: coffee and cookies.‚Äù

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúCoffee and cookies.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry about your brother and his children.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet it go,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe war within a war.‚Äù

He handed her his flashlight. ‚ÄúThere. Go now.‚Äù He pointed at the heavy front of a Stalin Building that had been driven through by the wall, its rusty bricks marred by the wounds of war. The upper balcony had been blasted away, and two lonely pillars that once held the ceiling reached to the sky like empty hands. Had the wall not been there, she thought it would topple over. Debris-littered steps led to a porch and a large wooden door beneath an archway. Alexi gestured again. ‚ÄúGo.‚Äù
