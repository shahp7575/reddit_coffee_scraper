1r9nnro,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_FrierenAgain/comments/1r9nnro/update_its_been_about_a_year_and_a_half_since_my/,Update: It's been about a year and a half since my first and only post.,"After seeing tons of reddit posts get read on podcasts, I decided to create a reddit account and make my very first post. I asked ""Am I the asshole if I ice my roommate out?""
In the post I complained about her lack of cleanliness and her selfishness leading me to no other choice than ""icing her out"". For how big of an issue it was, I merely described it as filth. That was too kind. When I said ""ecosystem in my sink"" I literally found some sort of parasitic worm growing in our sink after she thawed a bunch of deer meat using coffee mugs and then never cleaning them and leaving them covered in blood in the sink. When I said ""piles in every corner of our shared spaces"" I would attempt to clean up these piles and then humongous spiders would scitter out because this crap had been sitting there so long that creepy crawlies would make it their home. I still cannot believe I put up with that. I did move out, maybe about a month or so after that original post. What I couldn't see at the time and thus, failed to mention, was that she was quite literally a bad person. I even mean that with no malice. It wasn't even the cleanliness issue that broke the camel's back. A high-schooler she worked with got kicked out for a night and she mentioned he'd be crashing on our couch. I was sympathetic at first and said it was alright for the night. I asked his age and she said he was 18. Him being kicked out for a night turned into ""oh he's coming over tonight to play uno"" where she would then provide him with enough alcohol and weed to incapacitate a horse. This persisted for a couple days throughout the week, for about 2 weeks. I obviously took issue with this. I told her I was worried about 1.) Giving drugs to someone underage,  highly illegal 2.) His parents out looking for him and breaking down our door and 3.) HE IS STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL THIS IS WILDY INNAPROPROATE, I was met with ""You're bf comes over all the time with no warning I don't see the problem"" (obviously paraphrasing). Mind you, my boyfriend is my age and the apartment was so dirty I was ashamed to have him hangout with me anywhere but my room. On top of the high-schooler situation, she would bring in pets without my permission. First a cat,  which I (regrettably) didn't mind since they're pretty independent. On my part, it set a bad precedent. Two years later she ambushed me with a large dog. This poor guy was so lonely. He would crap everywhere because she wouldn't take him out enough. She got tired of  him doing that, so she would lock him in her room when she was gone. When he would crap all over her room and chew up things that smelled like her since he missed her, she would just get angry. When he ate a hole in the wall trying to escape her room, that's when she got a crate. This poor dog lived in a crate while she was out working or drinking or smoking weed. Once she got the dog, she hated the cat for not liking the dog. She would  yell and stomp at him. The whole time she had that cat she only changed the litter box like once every 3 months. I would often try to help these animals but there was also this war inside me that screamed it wasn't my responsibility or my job to finish what she started. I guess my update is that she was much worse than I even let myself realize, and that I am in an immensely better place now. My friend (best friend) that let me move into his spare room was wonderful and showed me how a roommate is really supposed to be. The best part, my bf and I ended up applying to and renting the apartment right below him and we get to visit and play DND with all our friends easy peasy.

\*\*Description:\*\*

Hey everyone, my name is Josef. After failing computer science three times, I decided to take a different route and became a Class 1 truck driver to pay the bills. Along the way, I taught myself game development in Unity. This is my first shipped project, \*\*AEGIS: STAR-WEAVER\*\*, a premium-style sci-fi memory and logic puzzle game. I coded and created almost all the 3D assets from scratch while on the road in my truck or at local coffee shops. I’m working with almost no marketing budget — literally $1.60/day on Apple Search Ads — so I’m counting on community feedback and word of mouth.

The game features challenging puzzles that test your memory and logic. I’d really appreciate it if you could test it out and give me brutal, unfiltered feedback on the difficulty curve and mechanics. Does the puzzle logic make sense? Is it too punishing? Your honest critique is exactly what I need to improve!

Before my feet even hit the floor I was mentally running through everything I needed to do, stuff I forgot yesterday, emails I hadn't answered. It set this anxious tone for the entire day.

About 3 months ago I started doing something dumb and small that's made a weirdly big difference. I spend the first 5 minutes after waking up just talking out loud.

Not affirmations or anything like that. I literally narrate what's in my head while I make coffee. I'm stressed about that deadline on Thursday, I need to email Sarah back, I think I'm low on groceries, I had a weird dream about high school. Stream of consciousness, zero filter.

I record it on Willow Voice so I get a text version. While I drink my coffee I skim through it and pull out the 2-3 things that actually matter today. Everything else, I can see it written down and let it go because it's captured. It doesn't have to bounce around in my skull all morning.

This works better than journaling for me because talking has basically no friction. I tried morning pages for years and it never stuck. Sitting down to write felt like a chore before my day even started. Talking while the coffee brews doesn't feel like anything. It's just me mumbling in my kitchen.

I'm not claiming this is some revolutionary thing. It's simple and kind of silly. But my mornings are calmer and I show up to work less scattered, so I'm keeping it.

I have had 18 illnesses in the past year. Here is the breakdown of what happens if I get even slightly less than 9 hours of sleep:

* **8.5 hrs vs 9 (one night):** Exhaustion, dizziness when standing (POTS?), sore throat, stinging eyes, bleeding gums/lips, low-grade fever.
* **8 hrs vs 9 (one night):** Same symptoms, but doubled in intensity.
* **8 hrs vs 9 (3 nights):** A full systemic ""crash."" Fevers up to **102°F**, swollen lymph nodes, and a 7–10 day recovery. I appear ""contagious"" (viral symptoms), but when others are exposed, they recover in 2 days with minor symptoms.

**Workup:** I've seen several PCPs, 2 immunologists, hematology, ENT, and sleep specialists. Extensive labs are ""normal."" Sleep study was ""textbook"" for quality/efficiency—yet I have extreme hyperacusis (a running sink wakes me from REM) and I'm hyper-sensitive to stimulants (one coffee lasts 18+ hours).

**The Diagnosis:** Genetic **Circadian Sleep Wake Phase Disorder**. It’s a rare mutation that runs in my family where melatonin/cortisol rhythms are delayed. It’s not insomnia; it’s permanent jetlag. Through treatment, I’ve shifted from a 6am–3pm cycle to 1am–10am. Stanford is currently conducting studies to find a cure for this specific mutation.

**The Struggle:** I’m a UCI grad and a Lime Fellow working remotely for an East Coast startup. I’ve been there 7 months (part-time), but they want to convert me to full-time and are pushing 9:30 AM PST meetings.

I feel judged for not waking up before 10:00 AM, even though ""pushing through"" literally makes me febrile and bedbound.

1r9n1z6,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1r9n1z6/teeth/,Teeth,"The very first thing I noticed about Jennifer were her teeth. 



Ivory white with almost a pinkish tint, so straight and even, that for a second it felt like she had an extra row. She smiled at me and I was completely smitten before I could catch her name, so in my head for those first couple days she was just “the teeth girl”. It’s embarrassing to admit now, but I became more clingy than a newborn duckling, following Jenny around the school hallways, where she reigned. 



In those first weeks I had a very vague understanding of how the social hierarchy worked, so I just felt endlessly lucky as I bathed in all the special attention that Jennifer’s circle was entitled to on the basis of proximity to the queen. I never knew why she picked me. I mean, she already had friends, God, she had an entire flock following her everywhere she went, admiring everything she did, ready to offer everything they had. And yet she would ditch them to go get hot cocoa with me after classes and watch stupid romcoms on her king sized bed, while I played with her thick brown hair, practicing making french braids.  



Marcus said it was because I was pretty and Jenny collected pretty people the same way one might collect pretty things. I wasn’t ugly of course, but there were plenty of girls in our grade who had bigger eyes or shinier hair or smaller waists. Maybe she did pick me because I was sort of cute, but I love to think that she chose me because she knew how well we would get along. After all, Jenny had a sixth sense about those kinds of things. 



We started school in September as usual and autumn was bliss. We went on long walks, treated ourselves to caramel coffee every other day and wore the cutest matching scarfs made of natural wool (courtesy of Jenny). By October I pretty much couldn’t imagine my life before or without Jennifer. We spent every waking moment together from early morning, when she would text me “helloooo Ani” with a long, even row of o’s. I, of course, replied right away. I knew people were gossiping behind our backs, but Jenny never cared about that sort of stuff, so neither did I. She was still the most gorgeous girl in the entire school and therefore the most popular one as well, so who cares what a couple of losers had to say about her and her best friend spending a little too much time together. Anyway, we didn’t even kiss before the first snow and at the point everyone was too preoccupied with murders to notice or give a fuck. 



I think the first time Jenny mentioned Lillith was early November. We were in her room as usual, just talking and whatnot, when she asked me if I was properly Christian, like baptized and stuff. I said no. Jenny said that was great, because I was a clean slate and I laughed because I didn’t really know what she meant. I somehow sensed that this was important to her and I felt proud that I was clean. I asked her if she was a clean slate too, but Jenny smiled and said she has already made her choice, which sounded all kinds of mysterious and cool. 



Then she asked me if I really loved her. If I wanted to do something so special for her. If I wanted to prove that we were really meant to be together. She said she can make us be together for a really, really long time, maybe even forever, if I just listened and did everything that she asked me to do. It probably sounds stupid, but you just don’t know Jenny. The way she says things, the way she looks at you, the way her hands feel on your face - hot and cold at the same time. So of course, I melted. Of course, I said yes. I would’ve said yes if she asked me to jump off the cliff. 



But she asked for something different - to chop off my pinky finger on the left hand. I was a bit scared at first, but Jenny said if I do it right - it won’t hurt. She gave me some pills from her nightstand and then we waited for thirty minutes until they kicked in. By then I was feeling so relaxed and happy I wouldn’t mind chopping my entire hand off. Jenny gave me a knife that looked kinda funny - like one of those old daggers they use in movies - and said that I should do it in the bathroom, so it would be easier to clean. 



On my way there I felt even dizzier than before and suddenly without Jennifer next to me all of it seemed so gross and absolutely insane. Surely, Jenny was just joking. Trying to test me, see how far I would go for our friendship. I stumbled back into the bedroom. Jenny looked disappointed. She helped me to the bed and sat nearby, stroking my hair. Even blurry, she looked so beautiful. I felt her putting the knife in my hand. 



“C’mon, baby, you just have to start it and then I can help you finish it off.”



Something about her voice felt so calming. With my eyes closed I brought the left hand as close to the blade as I could and pushed the knife under the skin. The last thing I remember before falling asleep were Jenny’s lips, closing around my finger. 



I woke up sore, but not as dizzy. There was no pain, only light weakness. I made my way to Jenny’s vanity table. My reflection looked the same as always. I gave myself a big smile. My teeth were ivory white with almost a pinkish tint, so straight and even, that for a second it felt like I had an extra row.

Thank you In advance for your time.","Hi, my name’s Craig, and I’m an alcoholic. Another day, another meeting. I don’t know why I come to these things. Oh yeah — that court-ordered bullshit. I’m always fucking up. Ever since my breakup with Maria. She always said I had a problem. I wouldn’t have such a problem if she wasn’t such a bitch.

Furthermore, now I can’t see my son without supervised visitation. Clearly, I’ll never learn, considering I’m on my second flask in the restroom — mixing my alcohol with free coffee and donuts. I can’t believe people buy into this 12-step crap. All around me are these smelly, homeless lowlifes and prostitutes. Jesus, how do I get out of this?

As I’m sitting down, one of the sponsors on the podium asks if anyone would like to share. Of course, Jerry raises his hand. This guy is a clown. He’s been clean and sober for almost a year. He always tells the same story — how he had a house, a sports car, a beautiful wife — until he lost it all by mixing alcohol with opioids. He even throws in all the orgies he was a part of.

Man, fuck that guy.

The only part of his story I’m even remotely envious of is that he reclaimed custody of his daughter. His ex-wife used to — and still does — smoke out of light bulbs, if you know what I mean. That poor girl.

But to continue my lovely life story, let’s go back seven years.

I’ve tried a lot of things to quit. Nothing ever works. If I’m happy, let’s drink. If I’m sad, let’s drink. If I’m mad — you guessed it — I’m having a drink.

One day, I came home early and there was a car in my parking spot. I didn’t think much of it, considering Maria’s sisters sometimes stopped by. Those self-centered bitches never thought maybe they should find a spot on the street so I wouldn’t have to walk a block to my own condo. You know — since street parking is open during the day.

On my way to the condo, I passed my favorite place — the liquor store — and grabbed a three-pack of tall cans. There was no way I was going to be sober with the in-laws over. So I grabbed my black plastic bag of fun and change, then walked out through the neon-lit doors.

Not without being stopped by this homeless guy named Poppa D — a regular outside the liquor store. He asked, like he always did, if he could have a smoke and any spare change. I handed him my last dollar and made him promise to buy drugs or a woman with it. He laughed and agreed, then said, “Man, if I could get all that for a dollar, I’d be the richest man alive.” We laughed, and I took off down the street.

Okay, Craig, I thought to myself, don’t be a dick to Maria’s sister. She always said you never make an effort to make friends. Thoughts of how much I hated those chicks flowed like a river of anguish.

Walking up the steps to my door, I turned the key and entered. First thing I did was put two of the three beers in the fridge. I cracked open the first can, took a sip, breathed deep, and sighed.

I don’t know how I’m going to tell Maria I’ve been laid off for the second time in a year and a half. Considering she’s four months pregnant, she’s not going to be happy. Maybe I’ll hold off until everyone leaves.

Hold on a second… where is everyone?

Walking up to the second floor, I heard giggling from the bedroom. I turned the door handle. It was locked.

What the fuck?

She heard the knob turn. “Shit. CRAIG!” she yelled.

“Who the fuck is in there? Open the goddamn door!” I shouted, shaking the handle until I kicked the door so hard it crumbled in front of us.

I saw a man in my bed with my wife, scrambling to grab his clothes so he could run. In a fit of rage, I swung the wildest punch. He ducked. I missed.

I lunged at him and bit him like a rabid dog.

The next thing I knew, everything went black.

Here’s a sample Reddit post draft in a personal, conversational tone that feels organic and honest, while including the required link three times:

**Title:** Ever heard of “The Brain Song”? It actually changed how I think about memory and focus.  

Hey folks,  

I wanted to share something pretty weird but kind of awesome I stumbled onto recently — *The Brain Song for Memory*. I’ve always struggled with keeping things organized in my head (especially when I’m juggling work, deadlines, and a side hustle). Someone mentioned this idea of using rhythm and sound patterns to “train” your brain to retain more information, and honestly, I thought it was another gimmick.  

But I tried this one: [https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song](https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song) — and I can’t explain it, but it actually *did* something. I felt a weird sense of mental clarity, kind of like my brain was syncing with a rhythm it didn’t know it needed.  

What surprised me more was how music — or “sound engineering for the brain,” as they call it — can actually influence focus and short-term memory. We know music enhances mood, but I underestimated how effective it could be as a *tool for productivity* until I tried it.  

If you’re curious about how your brain responds to rhythm or want to see if you can “tune in” to better focus during your work sessions, definitely check out [https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song](https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song). I’m genuinely interested to hear if anyone else experiences the same kind of mental boost.  

I’m still testing it during my morning routine — along with coffee and my usual to-do list hack — but part of me feels like there’s some untapped synergy here between sound, memory, and motivation.  

So yeah, if you’re into brain optimization or just like experimenting with new productivity tools, check it out for yourself: [https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song](https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song). Would love to know if it clicks for you too — or if my brain just vibed weirdly well with it.

Not all obviously but I can’t help but notice how easily embarrassed people get. It is often impossible here to talk to a girl and have a calm conversation in the moment for its own sake.

I started building more relationships with home builders and they always send me architectural plans in order for me to create my bid. I used to print these out at Staples (cost me $50-$100 per plan and a couple hours of my time) in order to do the takeoff. I looked at switching to digital software but most software costs thousands per year (paid upfront) and they all had a steep learning curve and took hours of training to be able to use the software effectively.

  
since I have a background in software engineering, I decided to make my own tool a few months ago that fit my need. I made it super easy and simple to use and created it so I could use it on a browser so I could swap between my desktop and laptop. I've been improving it ever since and decided to release it completely for free for anyone to use. this is not a sales pitch, there is absolutely nothing you can buy, nowhere to put any card information, this is legitimately free. I developed this myself and it costs me a couple cups of coffee a month to run.

  
if you're interested in using the tool, it's accessible at [easytakeoffs.com](http://easytakeoffs.com) for absolutely free. my goal is to help other businesses create bids more efficiently, especially contractors who are not too tech savvy and don't want to spend thousands a year just to be able to create accurate bids.

What if there was a small countertop device that mixed shower gel automatically using scent pods, so you could combine scents and create something you actually like instead of committing to one reusable bottle? It could be AI-powered based on your own preferences.

The goal wouldn’t be adding complexity, but simplifying things into one reusable system and potentially lowering cost per use if pods were inexpensive (kind of like how coffee machines changed how people make drinks at home).

I’ve been diagnosed with Ménière’s disease for 5 years. Today my ENT suggested considering a cochlear implant (CI) and I’m looking for some advice. Apologies in advance for the long post.

I was first diagnosed a month after I first had COVID. I had severe hearing loss of my left ear and rotational vertigo. I was blessed to have an ENT readily accessible and received my diagnosis relatively quickly. In my first 6 months with the disease, I experienced constant vertigo and episodic hearing loss. My symptoms would almost completely resolve with high dose steroids but would return relatively soon after the course of steroids finished. Eventually, my hearing stopped responding to the steroids and I was left with moderate hearing loss on the left. I still had frequent vertigo attacks and when my first ENT recommended surgery, I sought a second opinion. I was also taking diuretics, betahistine, and was VERY strictly following a low salt, no caffeine and no alcohol diet.

My next ENT thought I may have a vestibular migraine component. I started high dose magnesium and riboflavin and my life changed within a month. My vertigo symptoms subsided. I still had wicked tinnitus and hearing loss that weren’t responding to oral or intratympanic steroids. I got an Oticon 3 hearing aid for my left ear which helped immensely with the tinnitus and (moderate) hearing loss. I was still having monthly flares and eventually made changes to my work schedule to optimize my sleep and had almost three blissful stable years.

In 2025, I had my first miscarriage and I had a DRAMATIC swing in symptoms. My hearing dropped, I developed LOUD pulsatile tinnitus, and my vertigo was worse than it’s ever been. Since, I’ve done two rounds of egg retrievals and an embryo transfer via IVF.  Every time, I've manipulated my estrogen levels, I have had return of terrible Menieres symptoms. Last month, I had my second miscarriage after IVF, again associated with debilitating symptoms. I completed vestibular PT, have started IV magnesium infusions for the migraine symptoms. The vertigo and imbalance have improved but I’ve been left with declining word comprehension. My word comprehension is 68% even when amplified to 90dB.

Today has been a month since my last attack. I honestly thought my hearing had stabilized, but my word comprehension remains the same. After reviewing my symptoms and my case, my ENT (whom I love and trust) mentioned considering a CI. It felt completely out of the blue for me. If it would be helpful, I’m open. But I’m also reading about what an adjustment it is. And most folks on this Reddit seem to have worse hearing when they got their CI.

So. Anyone have any thoughts? Advice? I’m still low salt. Caffeine and alcohol in moderation (one cup of coffee a day and one drink a day on weekends, respectively) don’t really have an impact. I still take magnesium, riboflavin, triamterene, beta-histine, and a multivitamin.

1r9mpq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatcarshouldIbuy/comments/1r9mpq8/rav4_vs_chr/,RAV4 vs C-HR,"Hello! 

Recently my 2016 RAV4 XLE was totaled out by the insurance company, so obviously I am in the market for a new car. I am in my 30s and live in a big city but was never hindered finding street parking, and usually take two to three 800 mile road trips a year, hello Chicago, with smaller 300ish road trips between. 

I'm torn between getting another RAV4 because I did really love that car and how reliable it was, the space it offered, and how it drove. Though, in hindsight, I guess I didn't really use all the cargo space, and my road trips are usually me and one other person, once in a while 3+ but not often. Outside of road tripals it's the usual to Costco, the coffee shop, restaurants, and work occasionally.

The other option is the C-HR because I do like the design and they it's smaller, but it doesn't offer as much in a difference besides maybe the price and finding something with lower miles. 

I have a budget of $20k USD  and don't know much about cars, i.e engine size or how fast something is. I'm looking for something reliable and isn't a nightmare to work on or for my wallet if issues arise. 

Another option was the Honda HR-V, but I like what Toyota has to offer in their cars feature wise. ",1,1771564865.0,whatcarshouldIbuy,2,1.0,False

**January 4****^(th)****, 5366 CE**

***Bluefin, Destroyer, The Bridge***

**Currently 5.98 billion KM from Earth, at RA: 22h 40m 42s, Dec: -01° 29’ 02”**

 

***Alexander Wyeth***

Alex watched as both Ellie and Isabella relaxed in their seats with their eyes closed. Hopefully Isabella’s first true foray into the QF computer was going smoothly. The first time was never a pleasant experience.

He wondered if either of the girls would realize the solar system had just been forced to endure the universe’s most mediocre composer.

If he were to guess, Ellie would overlook it entirely. His daughter had a habit of missing the forest for the trees, and there was more of a chance she would somehow manage to derive the composer’s galactic credit score than realize the composer had broken physics for the sake of shit music.

Hopefully whatever entity wrote that three-minute piece had a day job other than musician, otherwise the definition of intelligent life needed to be reworked. Credit where credit was due; the bastard had gotten the piece stuck in his head.

Alex tapped the armrest of his chair to the rhythm of the galactic interloper’s tune and leaned back in his chair.

Isabella Silas was a different story. In the 90 minutes he had known her, she had proven to be one of the most naturally gifted dualists he’d ever met. The ensign came across as effortlessly human, and Alex was almost positive that a small part of her actually enjoyed her humanity, even if she wasn’t nearly ready to admit it. Most dualists with as few hours in an organic body as Isabella were hardly functional in the non-digital world.

Alex suddenly ceased his tapping. He frowned and flicked his eyes downwards.

*“Ellie, you snot. I hear you insulting me in there. I don’t fancy myself a philosopher! Quit embellishing!”*

*“It isn’t healthy to lie to yourself, Dad.”*

*“No one’s forcing you to repeat my little pearls of wisdom!”*

Alex smiled and shook his head. He barely had the chance to take a sip of coffee before he needed to intervene again. This time, it was considerably more important that he stepped in. Isabella had enough on her plate as it was already.

*“Not yet, Ellie. Isabella doesn’t need to know that she isn’t strictly beholden to the passage of time in the QF computer. This has been enough of a firehose of information as is. You guys just go ahead and work on the data set your own way this time.”*

*“Fine.”*

As it so happened, Alex *did* wonder how long they would be in the QF computer. He had some business to take care of, preferably before they were back on the bridge.

It shouldn’t take too long.

With a full body stretch befitting a man his age, if not appearance, Alex got up from his chair and sauntered over to the nondescript, automatic kitchen integrated into the bridge’s rear bulkhead. The thing didn’t work half the time, and of the half that it did, the food it produced tended to stretch the definition of palatability. Next time he bought military equipment, he was going to ensure that not *everything* was provided by the lowest bidder.

Shrugging, Alex sent a single solid kick towards the base of compressor vent, resulting in a satisfying gong.

“Alright George, I’ll admit it. I’m *extremely* impressed you managed to sneak onboard. I’m even more impressed you somehow managed to compress yourself into the kitchenette of all things. I’ve got to be honest; I wouldn’t’ve believed it if I didn’t see it.”

The unit’s compressor kicked on as if to mock him, but George remained silent. Alex gave him a few moments, then sighed. “Please get your ass in the nav computer or something. I suspect Isabella will want to hear your voice here real soon. She’s been banging off the rev limiter for 90 minutes straight. She’s gonna come down at some point, and besides, there’s no way its comfortable in there.”

Only then could Alex feel the navigation system’s firewall trip. He allowed the familiar presence to slip by without putting up any resistance.

“Ha, fucker!” George yelled gleefully through the bridge speakers. “See how that feels, huh?! To have your shit get violated by a foreign entity. Not good, eh?”

Alex rolled his eyes. “Yes, George. I admit defeat. I’m impressed, you wily contortionist of an AI.”

“Glad to hear it,” George replied smugly. “What gave me away?”

“The coffee machine didn’t have a ‘go fuck yourself’ setting before.”

“Really? Damn, I just figured yours would. Was trying to be authentic, you know? Was the cup of joe good, at least? Never made it before.”

“Really funny.”

“Just a heads up, but you guys *really* probably most definitely shouldn’t use that machine anymore. I did some heinous things with the code in order to get myself to fit. I don’t think it’ll ever be the same. Hell, I practically had to fold myself up my own ass to squeeze in there.” George cleared his digital throat. “At a minimum, never use the creamer again.”

“Jesus Christ, I don’t need the details. Just uh, hang tight until the girls are back.”

Alex went and sat back down. They would be arriving at Slipher Station in about 5 minutes from their frame of reference, and about 8 minutes from the frame of reference of an outside observer. Assuming the UAS Naval contingent on site weren’t complete pricks, they’d probably be out of there in five or ten minutes.

It would be ideal if they could arrive on Earth less than an hour after the first transmissions reached Earth’s atmosphere. He was going to be answering questions for weeks at a minimum. Any rest they could get now would go a long way.

Thankfully, relativistic speeds weren’t legal inside Neptune’s orbit. There was too big a risk of smashing into something important when cruising at speeds above 0.75c. The trip from Neptune to Earth would take them about 9 hours as a result. It gave them plenty of time to decompress, and Alex strongly suspected Isabella was going to need it. She had just taken several big losses back-to-back.

Alex flicked his eyes back downward and spied on the QF computer. He wondered how far along they were with their analysis. He smiled when he saw the directions both girls had taken.

Isabella, the clever bastard. There was the wack-ass human logic they needed to see. Who, but a human, would think it was acceptable to throw out one unit in exchange for a completely different one? On a whim, no less.

Ellie, in the meantime, was brute forcing her way through n-body calculations in an attempt to bend the damn universe to her will. It seemed his daughter was succeeding.

Satisfied, Alex relaxed into his seat for the first time all morning.

By the time Ellie and Ensign Silas returned to their bodies, Alex had already beamed their findings onwards to both Slipher and the inner solar system. The more information they could sling around before arriving, the better.

He could tell from the look on Ellie’s face that she was jealous Isabella had ‘heard the music’ so to speak, and she had not. It wouldn’t do much good to tell his daughter that the groundwork she had just laid towards finding the source of the anomaly would’ve taken him hours to develop, not 4 minutes.

Ellie needed to accept that she wasn’t always going to have every solution.

For the time being, however, Alex was more concerned about Ensign Silas’ well-being. The young officer had yet to have the gravity of the morning’s events come crashing down over her. He needed her to hold out for just a bit longer. They would be decelerating into Slipher Station’s controlled airspace at any moment.

Biting the bullet, Alex glanced over at the ensign and activated the apertures on his auxiliary computer.

*“Ensign Silas?”*

Alex watched as Isabella jumped in her seat, understandably surprised she just heard a voice in her head. She turned and looked at him with wide eyes until understanding washed over her face.

“Oh, you’re sending me messages through my coalesced constructs. I keep forgetting my auxillary computer defaults to the ‘on’ state now.” The ensign furrowed her brow in concentration and pushed a message back.

*“Alex, can you hear me?”*

*“Yup, clear as day, 5 by 5.”*

*“Can anyone else?”*

*“If your intent is to keep things private, the easiest way is obviously encryption. Low-probability-of-intercept emission practices are always prudent, however. Encryption doesn’t matter if the enemy never picks up your signal in the first place.”*

*“Understood. Is there something you wanted?”*

Alex closed his eyes. *“I trust you’ve been able to infer General Kiruna’s intentions for you by now?”*

*“The general wants me to accompany you to Earth as a witness representing the UAS Navy…”*

*“That is correct… Isabella, I attacked you less than two hours ago, and I understand that any additional time you spend in my presence can be perceived as both unethical and outright offensive. I’m confident I can work something out with the UAS contingent on Slipher to get you off this crazy train if that’s your wish. I’ll ensure nothing is held against you, career-wise, or personally. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to apologize enough for how this morning turned out.”*

Isabella turned to Alex and cleared her actual voice.

“If there’s one thing you should know about me, it’s that I’ve got thick skin. My progenitor manages sewage on Ganymede, always has, always will. They aren’t freeborn like I am; someone designed them for the role. I’ve gotten used to being shit on, day in, day out, quite literally. I want to get to the bottom of this nonsense more than any person in this solar system. Sarah, Eli, and George… I’ll do whatever it takes to find out what happened to them. If sticking with you helps me accomplish that goal, then I’m sticking with you, full stop.”

Alex closed his eyes and nodded. “We’ll do whatever it takes, I promise.”

“Good.”

“I do have at least one answer for you in the interim.”

Isabella looked at him quizzically. “What do you mean.”

A voice crackled over the bridge speakers. “Sup, Corndog. Didn’t think I’d leave you alone with these fuckers, did you?”

“George?!”

“Isabella?!”

Ensign Silas practically leapt out of her chair. “How?! When?!”

“Well, I wasn’t going to let Alex have the last laugh. I beamed myself from *Syren’s* shuttle to the last working section of Edrick’s array, then used that big ole’ aperture to compress myself into *Bluefin’s* automatic kitchen. A clever bit of maneuvering, if I do say so myself. I also learned how to make coffee,” he added.

Isabella looked to Alex, brow raised.

“He’s telling the truth,” he acknowledged. “Well, maybe not the coffee part.”

“You said my coffee was good!” George whined mockingly.

“I never said anything of the sort.”

It was Ellie, however, that narrowed her eyes. “Why did he just call you ‘corndog’?” she asked.

“I can answer that,” George replied haughtily. “It’s because dualists are similar to meat-pops, except they’re ripped from their digital homes, receive a thorough *battering* during training, and always end up completely *fried* in the end. Ya get it?”

Ellie huffed. “Stupid.”

“Well, Little Corndog, you can’t exactly fault my logic, can you?”

Ellie turned towards Alex with an exceptionally unenthused expression. “Dad, if George continues to call me ‘Little Corndog’, I’m going to stick him on a thumb-drive, flush him down the toilet, and purge the contents of the holding tank into space.”

Alex rolled his eyes. “Another time. We’re up on Slipher.”

*Bluefin’s* navigational subroutine performed an automated handshake with Slipher’s controller, bringing them to an unoccupied volume of space. It came as no surprise when the viewscreen revealed they were still around 100,000 km from the station itself. No doubt they were taking precautions, and Alex couldn’t’ blame them.

He fiddled with his console and used *Bluefin’s* optical sensors to zoom in on Slipher. Unlike most large-scale space stations dotting the solar system, Slipher *wasn’t* an ever-growing mishmash of various modules that had been added at random over the years. The station had been built as a singular unit, funded by a gas tycoon that thought future tenants might try their luck at mining Triton and Neptune. The thing had been built in the asteroid belt and slowly dragged into an orbit around Triton.

There were no costly mining rights in the system, so as shit as the profit margins were, just about anyone with the desire to start their operation in gas mining could set up shop for little to no cost. The *real* genius of the operation, however, had little to do with mining. It was in the lease the station had contracted with the UAS Navy some 300 years prior. Something like 70% of Slipher’s profits came from the fact the station served as a relatively large naval base.

Everyone aboard *Bluefin* watched as the speck of a station made its lazy orbit around Neptune’s largest moon. Triton was a desolate, but beautiful moon. Its surface was young, with few visible impact craters to speak of, and the plains of the frozen surface did well to reflect what little of the sun’s light managed to reach the system.

The crown jewel, of course, was Neptune itself. The gas giant’s surface wasn’t nearly as festooned as Jupiter’s rich in swirls and color, but people were nearly always enamored with its rich, blue color.

Alex was busy admiring the view when the comms subroutine indicated they were being hailed. With the flick of his wrist, he put the caller up on the viewscreen. The gray-haired Admiral that appeared on screen was unfamiliar to him, and the UAS Naval officer didn’t seem to care for making polite introductions.

“Private Vessel *Bluefin*. This is Admiral Hendricks, commanding officer of the UAS Naval contingent on Slipher Station. We’ve received the data you have sent over the past hour or so and have questions.”

Alex prepared himself for the worst. Some uptight asshole was going to run them through the regulatory ringer, hanging them up at Slipher until someone with real authority could come fetch them. He groaned aloud. This was the last thing they needed. What they *needed* to do was follow their messages to the inner system; not dick around at some frozen waste of a space station.

Perhaps the Admiral could see Alex’s apprehension, because the man’s facial expression softened.

“Alexander Wyeth. I must admit I had never heard your name until this morning. Under normal circumstances, I would feel obliged to follow the book to a T and bring you in for questioning.” The grizzled officer paused for a moment. “*However*, there are several people I trust aboard Slipher, human and AI alike, who vouch for both your character and your efficacy.”

The Admiral adjusted his uniform before continuing. “Over the past 20 to 30 minutes, every single person aboard Slipher witnessed what transpired at the Edrick Optical Array. Every one of us saw the *UAS Syren* engulfed by some sort of unexplainable calamity, something so outrageous that even the most inventive of us could never have imagined it.”

He closed his eyes and sighed. “We also received the message General Kiruna sent before the *Syren’s* bridge was lost to us. You should know that I have every faith in her decision-making abilities. The truth is, there is no reason for you to waste your time here at Slipher. Every minute you are delayed from reaching the inner system is a minute wasted, a minute that could be spent in the search for the *Syren* and her shuttle instead.”

“I only posit two demands before we let you run on in home.”

Alex could see the severity on the Admiral’s face. He didn’t seem a man to be trifled with.

“First: If Ensign Isabella Silas no longer wishes to be aboard the *Bluefin*, then she will be allowed to disembark at this very instant. She is one of us, and I will be damned if she no longer wishes to be aboard a ship that played a part in attacking the station under her protection and isn’t allowed leave. The second demand is quite a bit more straightforward. I need you to promise you will do everything in your power to seek out whatever destroyed the *Syren* and make them pay.”

“I await your response to my demands.”

Alexander blinked, utterly dumbfounded. That had not gone quite how he expected it. Who the hell did he know on Slipher that would be willing to vouch for him? And have enough clout for it to actually matter?

He turned away from the viewscreen and looked Isabella in the eyes. The ensign looked as resolute as she ever had.

“Well, Ensign Silas?” Alex asked.

Isabella stood up from her console, adjusted her uniform, and faced the viewscreen. “Sir, I am all good to go. I don’t intend on disembarking here. Doing so would be a waste of the Navy’s time.”

The Admiral cleared his throat. “And you, Mr. Wyeth?”

“We’ll find the fuckers.”

“Glad to hear it. Now quitting fucking around and get back to Earth.”

…

…

…

A few hours later, Alex showed Isabella to her stateroom. The day was hardly half over, but it was clear her human form was beginning to crash. The ensign practically fell asleep on her bunk before Alex could close the door – nothing a few hours of shuteye couldn’t fix. It was becoming clear to everyone onboard that sleep was going to be a rare commodity in the coming days.

Turns out, likability isn't about faking charisma or forcing yourself to be an extrovert. It's about small, specific behaviors that trigger trust and warmth in people's brains.

Most of us think we're unlikable because of personality flaws, but honestly? It's usually just habits we never learned. Society doesn't teach this stuff. Schools don't explain how human connection actually works. So here's what I found from researchers, therapists, and communication experts that actually moves the needle.

# Ask follow-up questions that show you were listening

People don't remember what you said. They remember how you made them feel. When someone mentions their weekend trip, don't just nod and move on. Ask ""what was the best part?"" or ""how'd you pick that place?""

Psychologist Arthur Aron found that mutual vulnerability and genuine curiosity create closeness faster than anything else. His research on interpersonal closeness showed that asking progressively personal questions builds connection. It's not about interrogating people, it's about giving them space to be interesting.

[The Like Switch](https://a.co/d/0iYLsaq0) by Jack Schafer (former FBI agent) breaks this down perfectly. Schafer spent decades getting criminals to trust him, and his techniques work for regular relationships too. The book explains ""friendship signals"" your brain sends without you realizing. Insanely practical. This is the best social psychology book for people who hate fluffy self-help.

# Remember small details people tell you

Your coworker mentioned their dog's surgery last week? Check in. Someone said they had a big presentation coming up? Follow up on it. These tiny moments create disproportionate warmth.

Professor Dale Carnegie wrote about this in [How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://a.co/d/0isLLVks) decades ago, and neuroscience keeps proving him right. When you remember specifics about someone's life, their brain registers you as safe and attentive. It's not manipulation, it's just how trust gets built.

Use an app like Ash if your memory sucks. It's designed as a relationship and communication coach that helps you track important details about people in your life. Honestly changed how I maintain friendships. You can set reminders to check in on things people told you about.

# Validate feelings before offering solutions

This one trips people up constantly. Someone vents about work stress, and you immediately jump into fix-it mode. Wrong move.

Therapist Nedra Glover Tawwab talks about this in Set Boundaries, Find Peace. She explains that most people aren't looking for solutions when they share problems, they're looking for validation. Say ""that sounds really frustrating"" before ""have you tried talking to your manager?""

The podcast Where Should We Begin with Esther Perel demonstrates this beautifully. Perel is a couples therapist, and you can hear how she creates safety by validating emotions first. People soften when they feel heard. Solutions can wait.

# Match energy levels without becoming a chameleon

There's a difference between mirroring and people-pleasing. Behavioral psychologist Vanessa Van Edwards studies ""charisma cues"" and found that matching someone's energy level (not their entire personality) increases likability scores significantly.

If someone's excited, bring your energy up. If they're having a rough day, don't bulldoze them with positivity. It's about meeting people where they are.

Captivate: The Science of Succeeding with People by Vanessa Van Edwards is loaded with research on this. She ran studies on thousands of interactions and identified specific verbal and nonverbal cues that make people magnetic. This book will make you question everything you think you know about first impressions and social skills. Read it if you've ever felt awkward at parties or networking events.

If you want a more structured way to work through these social psychology insights, there's an AI-powered app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that pulls from books like Captivate, The Like Switch, and expert talks to create personalized audio learning plans. You can set a specific goal like ""become more likable as an introvert"" or ""improve conversation skills in group settings,"" and it generates a tailored plan with adjustable depth, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples.

The app also has a virtual coach you can chat with about your unique social struggles, whether that's remembering details about people or knowing when to validate versus solve. It sources content from psychology research, relationship experts, and communication science to make the learning more structured and actionable than just reading random books. Worth checking out if this topic resonates and you want to go deeper without spending months researching like I did.

# Admit when you're wrong quickly and without drama

Nothing kills likability faster than defensiveness. Researcher Brené Brown found that people who can own their mistakes without spiraling into shame are rated as more trustworthy and approachable.

When you mess up, just say ""you're right, my bad"" and move forward. Don't over-explain or make it weird. People respect that so much more than watching you squirm through justifications.

Her book Daring Greatly explores vulnerability as strength, not weakness. She explains how perfectionism actually distances us from others. Game-changing perspective.

# Show up consistently, even in small ways

Grand gestures are nice, but consistency builds real connection. Texting someone a meme they'd like. Grabbing coffee regularly. Showing up to their events when you say you will.

The Huberman Lab podcast had an episode with psychiatrist Dr. Paul Conti about relationships and social connection. Conti explained that our brains are wired to trust patterns, not exceptions. Consistent small actions signal safety. Inconsistency, even with good intentions, signals unpredictability.

Try Finch if you want to build better relationship habits. It's a self-care app with a focus on emotional health and building sustainable routines. You can set intentions around reaching out to people and track patterns. Surprisingly helpful for staying connected without it feeling forced.

Look, none of this is rocket science, but it works because it aligns with how human psychology actually functions. We're wired for connection, but most of us never learned the specific behaviors that trigger trust and warmth in others' brains. These habits take practice, not personality overhauls.

**RECAP**

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/wt0EKsWTLd): **September 8, 2024**

Let me describe my family a bit. I am the youngest of four children, by far the youngest. I have two older brothers and one older sister. My mom is my dad's second wife. From his first wife, I have an older half-sister, who is three years older than my oldest full sibling. His first wife (his childhood friend) cheated on him way before, and after my dad made sure my half-sister was his, he divorced her. He met my mom and a few year later they tied the knot, and the rest is history.

My half-sister has always been welcome in our house. She gets along really well with all of us and even calls my mom Auntie. Her mom, though, has always been a bit of a harpie. She hates my mom for many reasons outside of ""she stole my man."" My mom is a retired fitness model and current Pilates instructor. so she looks really good for her age while she's more average and plump. So she would always make snarky remarks like ""Oh did you gain weight?"" or ""Are you pregnant again?"" even though my mom never stopped taking care of herself. With me though, she dotes on me and calls me the son she never had. With my older siblings, she mostly just ignore them.

So my half-sister is getting married, and my dad and his ex agreed to split the cost of the wedding 50:50. My dad doesn't care about planning for the wedding, so he left it all to the ex and the bride. During one of our meet-and-greet dinners, my half-sister revealed that she also invited my dad's estranged brother and parents. I can still remember my dad shooting a glare of pure anger at her. I asked my mom later why he reacted like that. I never met my uncle or grandparents on my dad's side, but from how my mom spoke, my dad's ex cheated on him with his brother, and his parents knew it for years before confessing. So my half-sister could really have been my aunt or something if the sperm chase went wrong.

My dad's ex was together with my dad's brother for a while after she and my dad divorced, but split soon after. And my dad refused to forgive his family for fooling him like that, and he went no contact with them for 25 years.

So back to the dinner, my dad asked in a very stern, yet quiet voice why she would, and my half-sister wanted to make her wedding more meaningful by also having a family reunion. And her mother supported her. She told my dad to bury the hatchet, at least for her daughter. My dad said she didn't have any right to tell him how to act.

On her way out, my dad's ex and I bumped into each other, and she commented to me how she hoped that I wouldn't have a chip on my shoulder like my dad does. If not for that, they could still be one whole, happy family. I didn't like her tone and reminded her that she was the one who cheated and broke the family. And I told her that she could have been my mom. The last part made her cry like crazy as she ran out of the house. My dad asked me what happened, and I told him, and he just grunted.

Did I go too far?

She even compared me and my dad when he was younger.

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/qkUx3Mih8S): **September 10, 2024 (two days later)**

Wow! I didn't expect so much response for my first ever post on reddit! Thank you so much for all your comments.

I am glad that at least I wasn't being cruel. My dad's ex just bawled so much and suddenly that I thought I did something awful, and I was worried.

As of now, I don't really know what my dad is going to do. I know that my mom and dad are talking about it, but he really seems conflicted. I thought about asking him, but my oldest brother told me not to. He said that I had nothing to do with it, so I shouldn't bother him.

But my full siblings and I just talked to my half sibling about what she had done in our whatsapp chat tonight.

First, my full sister tore my half sister a new one, calling all sorts of names before my brother told her to stop or leave the chat. Then he asked her why she did what she did.

Turns out that her ""idea"" of including a family reunion in her wedding was an idea from our paternal grandparents and her mom. Unlike myself and my full siblings, my half sister regularly visited her grandparents and talked to them a lot about us. My grandparents apparently wanted to see us really bad, and her mom popped the idea. Then my second oldest brother said that while it was her wedding and she could invite whom she liked, she didn't take our father's feelings into account. 

There was a reason that he went no contact with them for all these years. And it wasn't up to her to try to fix burnt bridges. My half-sister then asked if he was going to pull money out of the wedding, and my sister sent a brutal message ""Is that the most important thing right now, you \*\*\*\*\*"". I added that our father hasn't told us anything.

Then my half-sister said that she shouldn't have even done this to begin with, and my sister commented. ""You think?!"" She wondered if she could unsend wedding invitations to her grandparents and uncle, but then her mom might pull her money. I sent a chat to my full-sibling's only chat, if dad could fund the whole wedding if that meant not inviting his brother and parents. My oldest brother told me to ""can it and don't bother dad"". She also asked how our dad has been, and I said that he is very conflicted and talking only to my mom about it.

I then asked if her mom was okay since I made her cry. She said that her mom calmed down when they returned home. Apparently they got into an argument when she called my dad a stubborn sob.

To be honest, I think she is in a very tight spot. She can either piss off our dad or her mom. I don't know what my dad is going to do, and my oldest brother already reminded me twice that this wasn't my business.

I honestly think dad would be up for paying for the entire wedding if his estrange family didn't come. Of course it's his money though. Or maybe he is just so angry that he might pull out all together.

Edit:

\- I didn't post the entire conversation that my full siblings and I had with my half sister. I pulled only the relevant parts.

\- What I was thinking when I thought my dad could pay for the entire wedding was ""Does dad hate his family to the point where he would pay for everything just for them not to be there?"" I wasn't actually suggesting he pay for everything! That's stupid.

\- Looks like a lot of you are wondering if my half-sister knew what happened between my dad and his family. She knows that they hurt him badly, and he's never forgiven them. But not the specifics of how they had hurt him. She knew the cheating part, but not the ""family lied to him for years"" part. Apparently that's not something her mom or my dad's family discussed with her.

Hello. So I am the half-sister to the [PlaneRoof8162](https://www.reddit.com/user/PlaneRoof8162/), who made the posts regard me. 

[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1fc49z0/aita_for_telling_my_dads_ex_that_she_could_have/) & [Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1fdbl9u/update_aita_for_telling_my_dads_ex_that_she_could/?sort=new)

My brother told me about his posts on reddit about me a few days back. He suggested that I do the same here.

First of all, I love my baby brother more than any other member of my family since I've helped take care of him since he was born.

Second, I am very grateful for my father. He never mistreated me or made me feel lesser than his other children. So I did not mean to betray him in any way!

My mother had told me about her affair when I was in middle school, so I understood early on why they weren't together. I don't think I was ever angry at her since I was always welcome to see him and his family at any time I wanted.

But I wasn't aware until recently that the affair was related to my uncle. I asked my grandmother many times why my father would never visit them, and she would say it was because he was too busy with work or his kids. I asked my father one time, and he just said the same thing. I showed him their socials before, and he merely brushed over them. But I remember he never talked about them before, at least in front of me. 

Skip forward to recently. While I was coming up with the wedding invitation, I remember my grandparents and my mother asking if they could be invited. And I said, not knowing what had really happened, said of course.

And then the dinner happened, like my baby brother described in his first post. After the dinner, my father was so cold to me that I confronted him as to what was the huge issue. My father told me that I should have known better than to invite them to a wedding that he was paying for. And I asked him what the heck was the problem. My father then asked if I knew what they did, and I just replied that he never visited them.

Then I heard from Auntie that my mother had an affair with my uncle way before they married and their parents knew and hid the secret. I swear to god that I didn't know about this! I then asked why he never told me this, and my father answered that he already did the worst he could do, which was to never talk or see them ever again. 

He had no intention of souring my relationship with his estranged family. I then asked my father what I should do...and he just hugged me hard, and he said that he said it was my choice. I returned the hug and went out with my mom, and she was crying when she was walking out.

I confronted my mom immediately when we got home. My mother went a tirade about how my father was one who chose divorce and to break up his family, so I left. 

Now I am considering canceling their wedding invites, but I don't know how to do the best way. To be honest, I don't want them at my wedding any more. If they want to celebrate it, they can do it at a different time. I don't know if I should write a letter to them. I don't want to push aside any members of my family.

**PlaneRoof8162’s Post:** 

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/s0zAQbjtwy): **September 17, 2024 (five days later from sister's original post)**

Hello everyone.

I have some small updates and won't have any updates for a while.

So my half-sister came over Sunday and talked to my dad. Basically she made the decision to have the wedding without her extended family, and pay for the half of the wedding by herself and her fiance. She sort of figured that her mom would pull her money out for making that decision. Dad seems to be much happier about it. I saw her crying a alot and my dad hugging her. Not sure on what happened exactly, but I am guessing she apologized and he accepted it.

She stayed with us during the weekend, and her mom came by. Mom and Dad wouldn't let her in, so my half-sister and her mother talked outside for a bit. I guess it started off well, but then I heard shouting from outside, so when I came downstairs, both of them were screaming at each other. My Dad calmly walked out and told my half-sister to go on in. He talked to her calmly while she went back and forth from screaming and crying.

Then a car came by, and a man stepped out. He walked towards my dad and held out his hand, but Dad didn't take it. He sort of looked like my dad, but shorter and with longer hair, so I guessed that he was my uncle. He tried to talk to my Dad, but my Dad pretty much ignored him. I went to my brothers and told them what was happening, and they immediately walked down and outside. They told me to stay inside, so I continued to stare out the window.

My brothers just stood on the balcony. The new man said hi to them, but they didn't respond. Anyway, my dad spoke a bit with his ex wife for a while and came back inside with my brothers. His ex-wife was glaring at my dad for a bit before going back to her car with the guy. When my brothers sat down, I asked if that was my uncle, and the oldest one nodded. Apparently my two older brothers met my uncle purely by accident before.

Things were smooth that night. My half-sister's fiancé came by, and we all had a nice dinner. My mom and my sisters went away to plan the wedding since her mother is not joining in anymore. My brothers, my dad, me, and the fiancé just talked about stuff until we heard lots of honking right outside. We went to check it out, and my uncle was back with my dad's ex-wife.

My dad told my mom to call the cops while he tried to handle the situation. My brothers, my dad, and my half-sister’s fiancé went out. There was some yelling and screaming, but then the cops came and they went away. So for the time being, my half-sister will be staying with us.

I thought all was done until I got a text from my dad's ex after school yesterday. She asked if I could help her with something. I just blocked her number, but she then texted me on another number. I'm pretty sure my parents and brothers would say block her again, but there is nothing stopping her from using new phone numbers to bug me. Not sure what I can help her with anyway.

[Update (in comments)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/P0A5FEuYJQ): **February 27, 2025 (six months later from the 1st OOP's last post)** 

So a lot of people have been asking for updates. I supposed I will just comment here instead of making a new post.

I got married a few months ago and am expecting my first child! Six weeks pregnant this week.

My wedding had gone off without out a hitch. My father and his family all came, and my mother and my grandparents were uninvited. Instead they reached out after the wedding and honeymoon, hoping that I don't ghost them forever. No more drama there, so that is good.

And since my pregnancy, my father and Auntie (his wife) have been very supportive. They have been buying things from my baby registry so that I would have everything that I need.

I told my mother about my pregnancy, and she wanted me to move in with her so that she could help, but after everything I am keeping my distance unless I have no choice.

1r9m6uz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r9m6uz,UPDATE: AirPods stuck in frog case,"Greetings friends. I have come to you today with an update. It's day three of frog-gate in my home and the battle has been hard, I'm nearing my limit and I'm ready to croak.

I have genuinely read every comment, thank you so much for your ideas. You all deserve a detailed update post so I'm sitting at a desktop computer preparing this for you all, because this is serious business, as we all know...

# FAQ

To clear up some common areas of confusion:

* The entire frog is **firm plastic**, it is not silicon, rubber or ceramic. Here is a video from someone on Instagram [where you can see the frog in detail (not my video)](https://www.instagram.com/reels/DQDyDzIE21c/)
* I put my actual AirPods case in the frog backwards, which means the second part of the frog can't attach, which is why I want to remove the AirPods (so I can put them in the correct way and have a working, beautiful frog case)
* The thin clear case that you can see between my AirPods case and the frog is part of the frog, it isn't removable
* Yes it is silly to have a huge frog case for a product that already comes in its own case but I am always losing my AirPods case in my bag so want them to be easier to find (and also I just love the frog).

# What I've tried

Here's everything I've tried and the commenters who suggested the ideas. Note, that all of these things were done **after WD40 and olive oil had already been dribbled in the gap** between the frog and the pods, so I believe they all had the best chance of working that way. I've also been warming it and cooling it intermitently to see if temperature changes help, and they haven't.

>u/needcollectivewisdom

>I'd try with duct tape. Wipe off the WD40 first. Get a piece of duct tape, fold 2"" on itself to create a non sticky tab you can hold, then tape as much of the airpod surface possible. Give it a good press on the tape to ensure it's on the airpods, then pull / wiggle. Shove toothpicks or something else under as it shimmies up. Clean sticky residuals with Goo Gone.

This was a great idea, I did this, but because there is so little surface area showing of the bottom part of the AirPods (i.e. the main portion of the case that isn't attached by the hinge) it just slipped off after a bit of pulling (duct tape aparatus pictured).

>u/Visual_Anywhere_4485

>Centrifugal force? Tie some string around both legs and swing it like a yo-yo, around the world? Just like 3–10xs to loosen it? Or in a room with no fragile items and lots of pillows.

This still makes me laugh, but I did try this today, I put the case in a sock (pictured) and swung that bad boy like a yoyo champ, but it didn't work.

>u/stickypooboi

>What’s keeping it in is the friction of the interior of the frog. What the toothpick does is it creates a wedge and reduces the surface area on your case and that reduces the force you need to remove it. Best of luck!

Stick Poo Boi's suggestion showed the most promise because they have the same case and had the same issue as me. Unfortunately this didn't work. I've now jammed a knife, a thinner knife, cardboard, dental floss sticks and a bottle cleaner in between the frog and my AirPods. None of these items even enabled the AirPods to *wiggle* let alone be pushed free. I also used a thick wooden chopstick to push up on the bottom of the case while I had these items in place creating a gap and nothing. 

I actually *laid down on my floor,* put the chopstick in place with the thick end up against the charging port, had a wire bottle cleaner creating a gap between the frog and the AirPods, and while lying down, I balanced one end of the chopstick on the floor and pulled down with my full strength, both hands, on the frog hoping I could lodge the pods free. Nothing.

>u/Direct_Composer_9532

>Try putting more things in the butthole. That could work.

This poor gal's butthole has been on the receiving end of every kitchen impliment I own. 

>u/vegasbeck

>My son has the same one and has had the same issue. Not sure how he got it out but just know you’re not alone. Lol

VegasBeck checked back in after speaking with their son and even though their suggestion didn't work, I appreciate the follow up!

And now for the big dogs. These were some of the most suggested techniques throughout the thread, and SirTrinium was one of the first to suggest them all:

>u/SirTrinium

>get a disposable straw or a coffee stirrer that is a thin straw and flatten the tip and force it around the airpod case and try to get it to the back of the case. then blow as hard as u can. should come right out

>a good electric duster or can air or air compressor would also do it without the straw.

>another fun solution would be a massager held to the frog to see if the back and forth nudges the case out.

Well Sir, I tried the first one in a range of ways, I also went to the office store and bought a can of compressed air to try and expand the gap between the two and it didn't work. And finally, I got the most powerful ""massager"" that I own and gave my little frog the ride of her life on it, and the vibration did nothing to loosen it. 

# An inevitable conclusion...

**IN SUMMARY:** I have been defeated. If I have the energy I might take it to a phone repair shop or the Apple Store and see if they can have a crack, but I'm coming to terms with the fact that I think I will need to dissect my beautiful frog daughter and buy another one.

I see a lot of folks in here asking about how to source green coffee directly from farms without going through the usual broker middlemen, so I wanted to drop a line and introduce myself.

A little background: I’m an LA-based camera operator and DP, but I’ve been living full-time in Costa Rica for the last 10 years. Over time, I've built strong local connections that allow me to bypass the traditional export routes and go straight to the source.

Case in point: As I’m typing this, I’m riding in the back of a van hauling a 3 quintales micro-lot of 2,000m Washed Geisha and some high-altitude SL28 down from the Los Santos region. We literally just pulled these off the depulper today after spending the night breaking bread at the farmer's family cabinas.

I’m hand-carrying a small lot of this back to Los Angeles on March 5th. While I’ll be sampling some out to a few local shops, my main goal right now is to broaden my connections. I would absolutely love to get an official score on this lot. If there are any certified Q-Graders or experienced home-roasters in the LA area who want to cup and evaluate this, I’d gladly trade some of this green Geisha or SL28 for your palate and time.

Also, since I live down here full-time, if anyone is actively looking for boots on the ground in Costa Rica to help navigate farm connections or the export side of things, I’m happy to chat.

1r9m6e5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r9m6e5,Primeira vez em SP!,"Fala, galera!

Fui pela primeira vez a São Paulo neste Carnaval e, entre programações familiares e atrações culturais, tentei visitar alguns dos restaurantes discutidos por vocês e por outros fóruns/comunidades que acompanho. Vou compartilhar minhas impressões e avaliações. Tenho fotos de alguns lugares, mas de outros, infelizmente, não.

D1 – Bella Paulista e Almanara

Começando pelo, definitivamente, dia mais fraco.

A Bella Paulista foi a padaria que eu e minha família escolhemos no primeiro dia, enquanto esperávamos o horário do check-in. É uma padaria com muitas opções, mas, das que experimentei, todas me pareceram medíocres, e caras pelo que oferecem.

Já o Almanara era a opção mais “diferente” e “financeiramente viável” dentro do JK Iguatemi (risos). Brincadeiras à parte, eu queria ir a um restaurante de comida árabe, já que é uma culinária muito forte em São Paulo, pelo que vocês comentam por aqui, e porque minha única experiência prévia havia sido no Habib’s.

Tive uma experiência razoável para boa. As esfihas não me surpreenderam, tampouco o quibe. No entanto, o combo de pastas do mezze (coalhada seca, babaganoush e homus), acompanhado de pão sírio, foi excelente, especialmente como primeira experiência mais “autêntica”. A coalhada seca tinha um azedinho agradável, o homus trazia algo que remetia a umami, e o babaganoush apresentava um sabor defumado marcante, quase lembrando tabaco. Ótimas primeiras impressões.

D2 – Udon Jinbei, 89 Coffee, Noite Rooftop Bar e Pao com Carne

No segundo dia, a experiência já melhorou bastante.

Almoçamos no Udon Jinbei, especializado em udons e donburis. Eu já havia comido donburi na minha cidade natal, mas o udon foi uma estreia, e que estreia: sensacional. O caldo era excelente, com leve sabor de peixe e notas predominantes de porco e cogumelos. O macarrão, então, nem se fala, diferente de todos os que já experimentei na vida.

No 89 Coffee fizemos uma parada rápida. Que lugar caótico, não só ele, mas a Liberdade como um todo, que, segundo os comerciantes, estava “vazia”, risos. Lá tomei apenas um chocolate quente, com ótima textura, mas senti falta de um sabor mais intenso de chocolate. Minha namorada pediu um pão com Nutella, que achei normal, e um chew de pistache que, no máximo, considerei medíocre.

Tentando fugir dos blocos de Carnaval, acabamos indo ao Shopping Light, que, ironicamente, estava ao lado de um bloco. Para escapar ainda mais, subimos ao Noite, um rooftop/bar dentro do shopping. Tomamos um drink, bom, mas nada memorável, e, quando o movimento diminuiu, voltamos ao hotel.

À noite, fomos ao Pão com Carne, depois de várias discussões que vimos aqui no Reddit sobre os melhores sanduíches de São Paulo e também por recomendação de um amigo que mora na cidade. E aqui tivemos uma grande alegria, ambiente agradável e comida excelente. O clássico é muito bem executado, com um leve toque de chimichurri que faz diferença. Só um adendo: no reddit recomendaram pedir o milkshake deles, achamos bom, mas nada marcante, facilmente esquecível.

D3 – Z Deli Sandwiches e Dengo Chocolates

Z Deli é mais um queridinho do subreddit, e com razão. Que comida sensacional.

Foi lá que experimentei pastrami pela primeira vez, e parece que mudou a química do meu cérebro. Não sei dizer se é algo específico da casa, mas essa carne tem algo especial, sem dúvida. O hot dog também é incrível, a salsicha artesanal tem textura completamente diferente da industrializada e sabor superior até a outras versões artesanais que já provei. Para mim, um dos pontos altos da viagem. Pedimos ainda uma soda de gengibre que estava ótima, perfeito contraste.

Depois da Z Deli, procuramos uma sobremesa. Fomos a uma sorveteria no centro, mas a fila estava inviável por causa da chuva e do horário. Tentamos o Brim, mas o tiramisù, que, segundo minha namorada, é um dos destaques da casa, estava em falta. Seguimos, então, em direção ao hotel e, no caminho, paramos na Dengo.

A Dengo tem um chocolate absolutamente incrível. Eu já ouvia o pessoal do Ceia Clandestina, Gustavo e Rafael, elogiarem a marca em testes cegos, dizendo ser, provavelmente, o melhor chocolate do país. Precisei provar para crer, e, de fato, é um dos melhores chocolates que já comi na vida, amargor, doçura, leveza e textura perfeitamente equilibrados. Apenas um adendo, não gostei dos “quebra-quebras”, pois, para mim, tiram a suavidade e parte do que torna o chocolate especial. Também provei o chocolate quente deles, ótima textura, sabor intenso e um toque marcante de especiarias.

D4 – Peti Gastronomia e Buzina Burgers

Quando soube que iria a São Paulo, já sabia que precisava ir ao Petí, restaurante de culinária contemporânea, com cardápio rotativo, do qual ouvi falar pela primeira vez há cerca de cinco anos, no Jogabilidade, por meio do Eduardo Sushi, junto com Casa do Porco e Ikousha.

No Petí, novamente, senti que “a química do meu cérebro foi alterada” (risos). Como ficou claro ao longo do texto, na minha cidade não tenho tanto acesso a culinárias autorais ou mais experimentais, o que acaba me limitando.

A tarte tatin de tomates estava deliciosa. O atum era muito saboroso e salgado no ponto ideal para mim, embora eu ache que tenha passado ligeiramente do ponto. A sobremesa, um brownie com chantilly de missô, tinha um sabor único e muito interessante.

Minha namorada pediu o carré, que estava bom, acompanhado de uma excelente salada de repolho. A pavlova me surpreendeu, um bolo de azeite não parecia promissor, mas a combinação de sabores, azedo, doce e salgado, e texturas, bolo, granola e calda de jenipapo, criou algo realmente singular.

À noite, fomos ao Buzina. Pedi o Parm e fiquei me perguntando, como ninguém pensou nisso antes? O queijo ralado e o molho de tomate combinam perfeitamente com o sanduíche e deixam aquele inevitável gosto de “quero mais”.

D5 – Modern Mamma Osteria

Por fim, fomos ao Modern Mamma, onde provamos a clássica lasanha de vitela e o quadrucci. Massas excelentes. Acho que, pela experiência de comer, prefiro o quadrucci, a lasanha, apesar de deliciosa, é um pouco mais difícil de manejar à mesa. Em termos de sabor, ambas estavam ótimas, e a apresentação é lindíssima.

Amei a culinária de São Paulo, me fez muito querer voltar e experimentar, discutir, debater, explorar mais.

Obrigado a vocês, que mesmo sem saberem, me ajudaram a escolher esses lugares também! ",21,1771563226.0,ComiEmSP,5,1.0,False
1r9m5qp,https://i.redd.it/r34dnn8uykkg1.jpeg,Iran in 2026: What the World Needs to Know,"I wrote this text in the early days after the internet came back following the blackout, but I wasn't mentally prepared to post sooner, my apologies.

My previous posts on this matter

[Post 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTheWorld/s/zLUm4huDdM)

[Post 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTheWorld/s/XR90rdQXre)

So I'll try to keep this short without sacrificing any important information, based on the responses I got on my last post I figured I'd give a general summary on Iran's history, political situation and living conditions.

let's start with the most important one. 

## What ppl demand:


What ppl in Iran are calling for is a total regime change, it's not just about economical dissatisfaction, it's not calling for changes in law, it's a total regime change, this can be realized by the numerous videos of ppls chants in more than 100 cities. (ppl are chanting for a regime change and return of Pahlavi, not chanting for reform.) 

Things that have led to ppl being against the regime:

1. Everything being segregated based on gender

2. Unimaginable inflation

3. Spending the resources of our country to limit the ppl and fund terrorism across the globe

4. Religious, political and ideological pressure, everything is censored, everything is monitored, and regime has shown violence towards ppl who do not follow their regulations (cutting fingers arms legs, whipping, carrying ppl behind the trucks and publicly beating them, sexual assault, and public executions), Iran has had the highest execution rate per capita many years, (yes even higher than China and North Korea), and this is not counting shooting ppl on streets or ppl dying under interrogation. 

5. Lack of food and water and polluted air...

Iran was occupied 47 years ago by islamists led by Khomeini, they obtained power by violence and bloodshed, and this violence didn't stop after they completely gained control. Anything deemed ""Western"" by the Ayatollahs was banned; ties, owning a dog (house pet), T-shirts for men, freedom of speech... were banned. And a few years after that they made Islamic hijab mandatory for women while men were busy fighting with Saddam (Iran-iraq war). Before war and during war they mass executed ppl by calling them terrorists and calling the victims ""supporters of مجاهدین خلق"", although the executions were rapid and they didn't have to prove these allegations and freely executed ppl. Seyed Ibrahim Raisi gained the title (executioner of Tehran - جلاد تهران) around that era.

## Media censorship


Since the early days they took over all the forms of media, all the TV stations in Iran are under the control of (Seda va Simaye Jomhoori Eslami - صدا و سیمای جمهوری اسلامی) which is directly controlled by (beyt rahbari - بیت رهبری) which is basically where Seyed Ali khamenei (current dictator) resides. All news, whether online or on paper are managed by irgc and beyt rahbari, it's not as if they limit news, they're the only ones publishing news. Ppl who are independent journalists face punishment if they ever publish anything that goes against the regime's narrative. An example would be *Niloofar Hamedi*, the reporter who shared the picture of #Mahsa_Amini 's parents grieving photo in the hospital was arrested. (Mahsa Amini was killed by (Gasht Ershad-گشت ارشاد) which is also known as the morality police.

## Internet censorship

Even though the regime has full control over other forms of media, internet has been a way to access free information and debunking regime propaganda. There isn't a single popular online app that isn't filtered in Iran. YouTube, Twitter(X), Telegram, Pinterest, TikTok, Instagram, all filtered by the regime, even Reddit. (it takes me days to make a post here). After Telegram being a pain in the a** for the regime during the previous protests and Iranians spreading uncensored news via their channels, the regime started a massive wave of obtaining Iranian Telegram channels with high members to use them to spread their own propaganda during dire times, football channels, movie channels, fandoms, any channel with any theme was a target and they managed to capture many of them, either by paying or threatening.

## Brainwashing of youth

So I'll keep this part short as I'm planning to make a separate and more detailed post specific to this later, the whole thing is that we were told since we were young as 6 (by the media, school, in mosque...) that it is an honor to sacrifice our lives for the Islamic regime and muslim brotherhood and to scream death to America, death to Israel, death to non-believers and death to whoever that apposes the Supreme leader.

## State violence

## Morality police (Gasht Ershad - گشت ارشاد) 

As many of you may not know the regime has laws for how ppl should dress. The morality police is created and managed by the regime and the forces solely monitor ppls clothing on the streets, ppl who do not dress according to their standards are violently beaten and dragged by the morality police. (You may have seen regime propaganda of women without hijab on the streets but the only reason is ppl are fighting back and the morality police cannot enforce it, so it's not that ppl are free to dress however they want, it's that ppl are actively fighting for it). Banks, restaurants, hospitals... Must refuse services to anyone who doesn't follow the Islamic dress code (restaurants and coffee shops face the threat of being closed off and doctors face the threat of losing their license in case of providing services)

## Basij

Basij is a militia under irgc control, they recruit members in young age, primarily from mosques and schools, starting from first grade to high school. the members are used in producing propaganda, during riots and everywhere that the regime needs an extra hand. the Basij forces have directly been used to supress protesters using riot guns and in many cases by military grade weaponry.

## Proxy terror groups

Many terror groups in the middle east are either directly controlled and funded by the regime and irgc or are financially and militarily supported, such as Hezbollah, Zeinabiun, Fatemeeun, Hamas, Hashd-alshabi..., these groups carry out attacks both outside and inside Iran for the regime, and during the current protests and the previous ones were directly used against the civilians, leading to 1500 deaths in 3 days during the #bloody_november   #آبان_خونین and tens of thousands in current protests.

## Tactics they've used against the protests



(Idk if these tactics have been used elsewhere or are unique to the Islamic regime)


A phenomenon that we call لباس شخصی (plain clothes); they're higher ranking soldiers of irgc, Faraja, Basij... that are dressed just like civilians and infiltrate the protests. At early stages of their protocols (several years ago) they had the role of identifying the protestors and the leaders, after ppl learnt about their operation ppl started covering their faces (videos of old protests shows that ppl barely have any face coverings - 2009 protests for example - compared to the recent protests - last 5 years) so they changed their tactics to separate leaders and protesters from the crowd and arrest them, but during the #Mahsa_Amini protests ppl were well aware of these tactics and according to numerous videos ppl attacked them as soon as said agents started dragging protesters away, and now during current protests they silently carried stabbing attacks, both to mentally and physically harm protesters and to create a sense of distrust among protesters.

Dressing as civilians is not their only dirty tactic, they use public transportation, ambulances, fire trucks... to ambush ppl (I've explained this in my previous posts)

Once the number of protesters (during the current protests) significantly increased and the usual anti riot tactics deployed by the regime were proven ineffective, national television broadcasted that ""Mossad and US agents have infiltrated the country and are causing riots, they're armed and dangerous, stay at home and the foreign agents will be dealt with"". They announced warnings across different platforms, cut the internet access nationwide, called back their لباس شخصی forces (the ones dressed as civilians) and started a bloodbath against civilians. Marksmen standing on the rooftops of banks, mosques, schools, bridges and raining bullets on protestors, their forces shooting at ppl from cars and trucks, even mounted LMGs in some cases.

There is no hope for success without foreign aid/intervention.

### What will happen if the protests don't achieve any results:


This has happened before so it is as clear as day, when the crackdown is successful and they manage to stop the protests on the streets, they'll go after the ones they've identified, ppl who managed to escape, ppl who have recorded or shared the videos of protests, and a silent wave of mass executions will start (just like every single previous mass protests)


The information I've shared on this post is either my testimony as a witness or from documented and recorded events, I'd be happy to answer your questions.

plz don't start any argument on whether Islam is bad or good, this post is about Islamic Republic regime not Islam as a religion. starting such arguments will just hurt the spread of the news so plz plz plz don't start religious debates. ",752,1771563169.0,AskTheWorld,333,0.91,False

""Do you want to get pizza, split some wine, and just stay in with a scary movie?"" 

Blissfully happy, domestic and settled with a man who makes me feel at home. 

 

10:35 the next morning, my roommate texts me that Tank's got a nosebleed. 

I go home immediately. 

1:00PM...he still had a nosebleed. Two doses of yunnan baiyao and a compress, a calm house...it did nothing. Bright red. He's lip licking so he's swallowing more than I can probably see. And his gums are going pale. 

4:00PM...I knew in my heart he was going to have to leave me before it got worse for him. 

We ordered Taco Bell for the humans, and chicken nuggets for him. I even took video....he was acting like himself completely unaware of what was going to happen.

And by 9:00, I was looking down at his lifeless body and leaving the vet without him for the last time. 

He wasn't scared. Actually, he pulled me into the vet because he liked them there. They always gave him treats and snacks and the most attention in the universe. He got a barkuterie board, with chocolate and chips and donuts. I took a picture of him with it and he was genuinely the happiest dog in the world right there. When the time came, he was full snout into a jar of Skippy, after a brief moment of pulling his paw away from the vet because he thought he was getting his nails trimmed. (His second least favorite thing in the world....but the peanut butter won.) He was asleep before his head even hit the tile floor. And then he was gone. 

He never even knew how sick he was. And I never ever wanted him to know. He had ONE bad cancer day after he was diagnosed. And one was enough. 

I knew I was losing him. He was 13 years old and American Bully mixes simply don't make it to years ending in teen for the most part. I knew he was on borrowed time to begin with. I knew the cancer was terminal. He was on palliative care at home for exactly all those reasons. 

I just hoped we'd had more time. I didn't even get a month with him before I could see that god damned tumor in his nostril. 

Every morning hurts now. I come downstairs to complete silence. No tappy nails, no wagging tail. No dog snorts. No Tank on the couch, going upside down, happy to say good morning to his mom. I can't thank him every morning for watching the house and protecting me from the ghosts and the goblins and the nutcrackers. I can't lay all over him and tell him he's perfect, that he's the cutest dog in the world, that I love him. Because he's gone. And I would do anything to come downstairs tomorrow and have one more moment with him. I'd do anything in the world to be late for work because I had coffee with my best friend before I left one more time. 

 

I came home to a house that just hurts. Tonight was the first night since September that I didn't spend my evening hanging out downstairs because my dog was there. I stayed in my room, mostly with the door shut, and I felt guilty for that because I know the cats are mourning too. I just needed to keep being away, just a little bit longer. I feel horrible right now for so many reasons but mostly because of the massive paw print sized hole in my heart. 

 

I don't feel like myself without him. 

I picked his ashes up from the vet today after work, and I brought him with me to run my errands because he loved to go anywhere and everywhere with me. 

I stopped at Ham and Bone. I got churus for his cats (and for Alec's cat, Crowley) and I got him his favorite cookie. The one he bullied me into going to get him one morning in January when I said ""treato"" and he literally walked to the door, sat down, stared at me, and started snorting. 

""Well go get my snack then. You said it!"" 

And I did then. 

I wish I could now. That last snack will be in his urn until it's absolutely time to get thrown out. 

 

I miss him. I miss holding on to his fur, him just silently there for me every time I've cried- and god, have I cried a lot these last few years. I can feel him shedding all over me, stanky dog breath kisses, not understanding why I'm crying but just happy to be with me. 

 

I had him for more than a decade, but I'm going to miss him forever. 

Losing Brains, my cat, hurt. 

This one is next level. 

 

And every time I look at Dio (my other cat and the last of my original trio of furkids) right now I'm so scared of the day he has to leave too.

I can't picture my life without my animals in it. 

I love my pets, and they're my whole world. 

""They give us one thousand great days...one one really awful one.""
