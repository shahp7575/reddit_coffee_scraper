1n6fj23,https://v.redd.it/k32zbqvr6qmf1,Help what Mod is this from??? [Fo4],"I've recently been replaying Fallout 4 after a long time and I've ran into something I have never seen. I was exploring the Concord Speakeasy and in the room with the skeleton and mannequin on the bed, the tv in the room turned on and had the video from The Ring on it and a spooky child voice. It scared the shit out of me and now I'm wondering what mod could have added that in. I looked through my mod list and can't think of one that would have that. I haven't played Fallout 4 in a couple of years and I know the next-gen update added a Halloween pack but after looking stuff up, I couldn't find anything related to it. Here is my mod list, maybe somebody knows what could be the culprit.

1n6fird,https://www.reddit.com/r/expats/comments/1n6fird/not_speaking_the_language_is_probably_one_of_the/,Not speaking the language is probably one of the hardest things about this life,"I‚Äôve been abroad a few years now, and I think one of the biggest things that caught me off guard wasn‚Äôt the culture shock, the paperwork, or even the money stuff. It was just like...how isolating not speaking the language really is.

And yeah, I thought I was ready. Before I moved abroad I was crushing it in a certain app. But that isn't really preparing you.

Like yeah, you expect it to be tough. But until you‚Äôre living it, sitting around a dinner table with coworkers, or meeting someones family and just nodding politely, or smiling through confusion at the pharmacy, or hearing laughter around you without knowing why (don't worry its not about you). You don‚Äôt realize how much it wears on you. And how quickly you start to feel like an npc.

Most people I‚Äôve met while abroad never get past the ‚Äúordering a coffee‚Äù level. Some don‚Äôt even get that far. And it‚Äôs not because they‚Äôre lazy or don‚Äôt care (maybe a little). Part of it is because most language learning tools are built for engagement (read: profit), not fluency.

I‚Äôm talking about the dopamine-apps. Streaks, levels, dancing owls, ‚Äúthe duck is red.‚Äù It feels good in the moment, but it doesn‚Äôt get you in to the language. It doesn‚Äôt teach you what people actually say or how they say it.

**What finally started working for me was dead simple.**

1. I watch content I already enjoy (YouTube).
2. I pull the transcript.
3. I highlight the useful stuff, real phrases, new words, expressions.
4. I drop them into my spaced repetition app and review them.
5. Then I rewatch the content, and actually I catch things I missed the first time.

It‚Äôs not sexy. It‚Äôs not gamified.

But it actually works. I understand more, say more, and connect more.

i know this probably sounds like common fuckin sense to a lot of you. especially those of you who ACTUALLY speak the local language where you live. But I also have run into my time abroad probably hundreds of people who can't get beyond the ordering a coffee stage...some cant even get that down...so YEAH, this might be obvious, but it WORKS.

  
and i think its important to talk about here because being an expat the language barrier is one of the hardest things we run into....

I've lived abroad in 3 countries now. I know the struggle. I'm about to move to a fourth.

It‚Äôs slow at first. But it snowballs. You learn the stuff people really say. Studying the vocab for the specific video then following along to hit helps you pick up the actual cadence of it all. You get more slang, the filler words, the tone. It makes everything else  like grammar, pronunciation, etc just easier because you‚Äôre not just memorizing words, you‚Äôre learning in context.

If you‚Äôre an expat struggling to get past surface-level survival phrases, I just want to say this is something we all struggle with.

Anyway. That‚Äôs what worked for me. Thought it might help someone else.",0,1756807687.0,expats,0,0.4,False

I will be pursuing mbbs and a lot of you will say that i should be thankful, i mean yeah I am thankful but I can't deal with this loneliness anymore. Since I was a kid, i have always been lonely. During my NEET preparation, i was isolated from everyone and focused only on my studies, i had only 2-3 friends from my coaching 
and after giving NEET, i have been sitting idle in my house all day. In order to cope with my loneliness, i installed a dating app and went on a few dates so that I could feel less lonely but it's been 1 month and I have been going on no dates at all because I don't like it at all, meeting strangers through app is no longer my thing and it gives me extreme level of anxiety as well as I reside in delhi where crimes tend to occur every other minute.   i just feel super lonely, i don't have any friends to talk to, i wish I had friends with whom I could hang out and have fun but i don't have any. There was a guy I was talking to lately who basically ghosted me so now I feel extremely lonely, i just feel like I am wasting my prime youth, people at my age are going out, clubbing, having fun and I am sitting in my house all day like a pig. i feel like I am wasting my potential even though I have lost interest in everything. Recently I got myself a violin, i thought I will keep myself busy but after playing for 2 days, i got bored. I feel extreme level of loneliness residing inside me. I am hoping when I will enter medical college, I will make friends and date in order to fill my space for loneliness but I am not sure, what if I feel more lonely there, what if my life becomes shittier. I have also developed these negative thinkings, i can't even go out because I have social anxiety ( i developed it during my NEET time) i feel very nervous when I go out and I also feel I am suffering from mental illness. Like my behaviour is changing a lot, I am becoming very arrogant and egoistic, my heart is getting filled with extreme hatred for everything in the world apart from coffee and fitness.

Basically I told her (through text) about this guy I‚Äôve been talking to for 5 months and that I blocked him over a disagreement (I posted the reason on my profile) anyways, she claimed that I was being dramatic and I overreacted in which took me by surprise but I wanted to hear her out so the next day I went out with her on a little coffee date and we started talking about it. Now mind you I‚Äôm 17 and shes 19 so shes always been the older more mature one in the friendship and I always trusted her and her advice but I was so shock when she told me that if I refused to deal with men using offensive words in general then I‚Äôll never get a boyfriend because that‚Äôs just ‚Äúhow guys are‚Äù. She then went on and on about how I can trust her on this because she‚Äôs been in lots of relationship (which I mean it‚Äôs true) and I‚Äôve never been in a relationship and that I‚Äôm not experienced enough to understand. I told her I found what he said offensive in this specific context and she just flat out said ‚ÄúBabe..maybe you‚Äôre just not meant to be in a relationship then‚ÄùI mean after hearing that of course I got a little upset because what is that supposed to mean? Just because I don‚Äôt tolerate certain ‚Äúsmall‚Äù situations? That means I‚Äôm unworthy of dating? She went on and said my standards are unrealistic and that guys only want a chill girlfriend not a girl that ‚Äúfreaks out over small things‚Äù. At that point I‚Äôm sick of it so I told her‚Äújust because you‚Äôre used to dealing with shitty men doesn‚Äôt mean good men don‚Äôt exist. Stop projecting it onto me‚Äù and she started crying. And of course I‚Äôve known this girl for years so I felt gulity and apologized. She didn‚Äôt say anything after I‚Äôve apologized and just left the cafe. I sat there at the cafe for a really long time contemplating what I should do. At the end of the day she‚Äôs one of my best friends, known this girl for 8 years and I just don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm ready to break the friendship, but on the other side I think shes completely wrong here. 

For the people that have read my other post: She was never really like this, I‚Äôve seen all the comments and I don‚Äôt know but i wouldn‚Äôt say she‚Äôs the textbook definition of a pick me, but I mean I wouldn‚Äôt really know because we don‚Äôt really talk about boys in our friendship and again I‚Äôve NEVER dated before, I‚Äôve only started being more open to dating this year so yeah we never talk about relationships and stuff hence why I never knew this side of her. And she‚Äôs been in many relationships and the guys she‚Äôs been with are not the best but also weirdly enough she moves on REALLY fast. Idk what the psychology is, I don‚Äôt even know if there is one but if anyone know please lmk because I wanna help her but I really don‚Äôt know how.

Over the years, one thing I‚Äôve noticed is that the right **hospitality supply** choices can make or break the guest experience. It‚Äôs not just about filling rooms; it‚Äôs about creating an environment where people feel cared for.

Here are a few essentials that I believe every hotel should prioritize:

* **Quality Bedding & Linens** ‚Äì Guests always remember how well they slept. High-quality sheets, pillows, and duvets aren‚Äôt just a luxury‚Äîthey‚Äôre an investment in repeat business.
* **Bath Towels & Toiletries** ‚Äì Fluffy towels and reliable amenities (soap, shampoo, conditioner) often set the tone for how ‚Äúpremium‚Äù a stay feels. Cutting corners here shows immediately.
* **Guest Room Essentials** ‚Äì From hangers and lighting to coffee and condiments, these little touches make the difference between ‚Äújust a room‚Äù and a welcoming space.
* **Furniture & Hardware** ‚Äì Durable bed frames, desks, and chairs not only enhance comfort but also save hotels from frequent replacements.
* **Eco-Friendly Supplies** ‚Äì More travelers are looking for sustainability. Options like biodegradable tableware or energy-efficient air conditioners show guests you care about the planet too.

Of course, the right hospitality supply strategy isn‚Äôt one-size-fits-all. A boutique B&B may focus more on personalized touches, while a large property might emphasize consistency across hundreds of rooms. But in the end, the essentials remain the same: comfort, reliability, and sustainability.

I‚Äôm curious‚Äîif you‚Äôve stayed in hotels often, what details stood out to you the most? And for anyone in the industry, what hospitality supplies have made the biggest impact on guest satisfaction in your experience?",2,1756807076.0,hotels,0,1.0,False

It would have been really beneficial. However, I'm at the point where I'm losing sleep over this unexpected twist in my life. I'm sorry this is so long, TLDR at the bottom!

BACKSTORY: I (31F) was extremely close with my cousin (28F, we'll call her C for cousin) ever since childhood. We all grew up together close as kids and it continued throughout school and college as well. We had a big friend group we used to be a part of (kinda fell apart due to COVID) and we've been on many vacations, concerts, and girls trips together throughout the years. She was one of my best friends and we share many similar interests and I trusted her with my life.

Things started getting rocky between us around the time I started seriously dating a guy (who ended up becoming my husband!) I knew that she desperately wanted to be a wife and mother but had trouble finding suitable partners, in her opinion. Things escalated when I got pregnant when I wasn't married to my husband. She sent me a long message condemning me for having a child ""out of wedlock"" and that I was embarrassing my parents. Looking back, I probably should have dropped her right then and there. She would eventually tearfully apologize and admit to being jealous.

Despite becoming a parent and eventually a spouse,
 I still made efforts to include C in my life. We hosted game nights, friends' holidays, and sports watching parties and always invited her. My husband also ensured that I could spend one on one time with her frequently. She would always express how much she wanted to be a wife and mother but had no idea how to make it happen. I told her I'd be willing to do anything to help her find happiness. I knew how hard it was in the dating scene. She would be somewhat thankful but reluctant.

Eventually, she did meet a guy and she seemed happy! She met him while out with a different group of girlfriends (I was close to one of them, we'll call her T, 28F.) Unfortunately, they only dated for 2 months and he ended it because he thought she was ""too boring."" C was clearly devastated and it was obvious to everyone that she thought this guy was ""the one."" She spiraled into a bit of a depression and had a major falling out with the girlfriends due to the short lived relationship. I stood by her side as she cried over and over about feeling hurt and betrayed.

As time continued on, I felt like she was distancing herself from me and choosing to hang out with my sister (23F) and her sister (23F) more often instead of me. She stopped asking if I wanted to hang out or anything. We went from talking 2-3 times a week to not talking for weeks. I would periodically ask her if everything was okay and she assured me that everything was fine and that she was just trying to spend more time alone. Except that I would find out she was secretly planning an international trip with our sisters and didn't want to tell me.

I was getting weird and negative vibes any time I talked to her or was around her. Something progressively felt off or strange but I could never get a definitive answer. She continued barely speaking to me and I was going through my own issues as well (navigating parenting now 2 young children and looking for employment after an unexpected layoff.) She continued only hanging out with my sister, her sister, and other family members. Any time I tried to make plans, she would either already have plans or she would make plans with me but cancel at the last minute.

Finally, in January of this year, it all came to a head. She reached out after about a month of no texting to complain about how the guy she briefly dated almost 3 years prior had announced his engagement. Again, being the ""good friend/cousin"" I thought I was, I expressed how sorry I was to hear and that it must be really upsetting for her. After brief conversation about that, I decided to get ballsy and try asking her if everything was okay between us because the bad vibes were feeling physical at this point.

To my surprise, she launched into a tirade about how she's sick and tired of me asking if things are okay. She said that as a mom and wife, I need to be with my family first and foremost. She said she has no one and that she's all alone. She also said that I must have issues if I think she's constantly upset with me. She ended by saying that she didn't have the emotional capacity to be friends with me anymore. I respected her wishes and stopped communicating with her. It was nearly 9 months of no contact, with the exception of brief sightings at family gatherings. I grieved the friendship ending but I knew I couldn't stand to be in a one sided friendship anymore. Also, I only asked her maybe 4 times over the course of 5 years if she was upset with me. I wasn't always asking.

PRESENT DAY: This Saturday, my cousin texted me after almost 9 months of no contact. She said she hoped myself and my family were doing good. She said she thinks about me a lot, wanted to talk, and asked me if I would be up for coffee. I cautiously agreed, but at this point, it's mainly to try to get some closure. I didn't realize how much this was going to stress me out. I'm supposed to meet her this coming Saturday morning and have had trouble sleeping, despite religiously taking gummies for sleep. I don't know what is going to happen but I'm just an internal mess. I'm very skeptical and have no positive expectations about this. 

How should I feel? Am I crazy? I've become very angry towards her over the past 9 months to the point of almost blocking her on everything. I feel ridiculous and stupid for letting someone get to me this way. I'm sorry for any clarity issues, it's 5:49am here and I'm tired but cannot fall asleep haha. I also left out a lot due to how long this is already but I included the major details.

Thank you for reading and I hope your life is amazing or becomes amazing. I appreciate any advice or kind thoughts.

TLDR: Cousin/lifelong friend became distant and jealous over time. She ended our friendship in January and after almost 9 months of no contact, she reaches out out of blue wanting to talk/meet in person.",3,1756806985.0,lostafriend,0,1.0,False

I recently took the Academic IELTS (computer-based) on **31st August** at a center in India and wanted to share my preparation, exam-day experience, and some tips. Hopefully, this helps anyone preparing for the test.

# üìå Results

I was honestly surprised by how fast the results came. I got them **just 28 hours after the test!**

# üìñ Preparation

* **YouTube resources:**
   * [IELTS Liz](https://www.ieltsliz.com/) ‚Äì great for understanding each section and practicing questions (her website is also very helpful).
   * IELTS Advantage ‚Äì really useful for practicing while watching videos.
* **Practice materials:**
   * IDP provided a **Burlington book** (seems like everyone in India gets one after registering). I used it for the last 4 days before my exam.
   * Took **mock tests on** [**ieltsonlinetests.com**](http://ieltsonlinetests.com) ‚Äì these were very close to the actual exam in listening and reading.
* **My take:** If you studied in a decent English-medium school in India and already have a good grasp of the language, **self-study is enough for 7+ band**. Many consultants try to sell overpriced courses by demotivating you, but YouTube + practice books are more than enough.

# üó£Ô∏è Speaking Test

* Conducted via **video call** with an Indian examiner.
* Key tip: **Speak naturally** ‚Äì like talking to a friend at a coffee shop.
* Don‚Äôt fall for the advice of memorizing idioms or rehearsed answers.
* My experience:
   * Fumbled in **Part 2** (spoke for only a minute and repeated myself), but the examiner was supportive and encouraged me with gestures to keep speaking.
   * **Parts 1 & 3** went fluently, and I just stayed natural.

# üéßüìö Listening & Reading

* Very similar to the mock tests on ieltsonlinetests.com.
* These turned out to be my **highest-scoring sections**.
* **Tip for reading:** Start with **Passage 3** (usually the hardest) and move backwards. This ensures you don‚Äôt run out of time on the tough part.

# ‚úçÔ∏è Writing

* By this time, I was **tired** and my **bladder was full** üòÖ. Big mistake not to go earlier.
* I completed Task 1, but halfway through Task 2 I had to go to the washroom.
* This cost me some proofreading time, and I‚Äôm sure there were a few punctuation mistakes.
* **Lesson learned:** Always go to the washroom before starting LRW.

# ‚úÖ Final Thoughts

This subreddit really helped me discover the right YouTube channels and stay motivated.  
Overall, if you prepare smartly with the right resources, **self-study is more than enough for a strong band score**.

Feel free to ask me anything about the process!

Maybe I‚Äôm overreacting though.

We met when we were in college. Some of the best days of my life were with her. I love her so much, and even to this very day I love her. She was spontaneous and funny, but focused and smart. She had a great body and was great in bed.

We graduated the same year and we both shared a career based aspiration over anything else. We were workaholics and we always looked, studied, and helped each other out when it came to jobs. We would work part time jobs, as we searched and eventually my then girlfriend found a full time job which changed.

I got a job soon after and we were very work oriented and promotion centered. Eventually I got a promotion and she did too. Currently I‚Äôm comfortable where I‚Äôm at and she is still striving for another position at her spot. We both have different jobs, so our career trajectory is a bit different, but we nonetheless are proud of our accomplishments.

I‚Äôd argue she‚Äôs carrying this marriage and I owe so so SO much to her and I have no idea where I would be if I didn‚Äôt sit next to her in that course level 100 class.

I am very much happy with where we are, but I feel like that spark and connection has faded away. I still love her so much and I‚Äôm so proud of her work. That focused and smart element of her is still there and is stronger than ever. That spontaneous and funny side has seemingly vanished. 

Gone are the days of nights out, pillow talks, friendly get togethers, and deep intimacy. We are both exhausted from work and want to do nothing but just kick back and relax. Watch some TV, eat dinner, maybe even do a little more work, and go to bed. On the occasion we may see a movie, eat at some local chain, or have coffee, but they just don‚Äôt feel the same. It has this obligation feeling to it that more so ‚Äústrikes off‚Äù that feeling of having fun, rather than actually having it. We don‚Äôt really have much of a sex life anymore sadly, and I just sort of feel like it‚Äôs something we ‚Äúgrew out of‚Äù.

I‚Äôd love to go out and plan or reserve some expensive dinner with her. A fancy place where I decide the week before if I should wear cologne. Maybe she‚Äôs picking out some beautiful outfit and what kind of lipstick she would wear. I would love to travel when it‚Äôs not business oriented and even go out of the country. A cruise or some destination where we meet some locals and befriend them for the day. Maybe spice up our sexual life. I‚Äôd love to just walk around naked in our place for a day, something we both fantasized about but alas, never did.

Maybe I‚Äôm saying too much, but the point is was there a point where I should have told her to slow down? Tell myself? I feel like we spent our 20s working hard that we owe each other some time together. A little ease on the brakes, but it feels too late now. Is the life I ask for something I missed? Does it come later?

1n6f93x,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1n6f93x/the_weather_mage_15/,The Weather Mage 1/5,"'Damp', 'Misty', 'Drizzle changing to rain later in the day', or vice versa. All are weather terms that Doctor Frank Mercer encountered as a weather modeling specialist in his windowless labs within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Center for Weather and Climate Prediction complex in College Park, Maryland. But there, they were just words. Here, in a suburban neighborhood south of Seattle, in February, those words take on precise meanings and implications, as do the distinctions between a 'shower', a 'squall', and a 'downpour'. Droplet size, density, horizontal velocity, and duration all play a part in how wet you are going to get, and how much coffee it is going to take before you feel normal again. But then, just when the relentless twilight of the perpetual overcast threatens to sap your will to live, another weather pattern emerges.

Frank stood in his driveway, car fob forgotten in his hand, and stared at the blue sky he had not seen since renting this house six weeks earlier. Sparse cumulus clouds were all that remained of the prior overcast. Birds and insects joined in the sense of exuberance. The patterns of ice and rock on the glacier-clad stratovolcano dominating the South-East horizon, though over 60 kilometers away, were clearly visible through the rain-cleansed air as if the distance were only half. The local weather reporters describe mornings like this as ""The Mountain is out."" But the lenticular cloud kissing the summit promised that this respite would be short before the rains returned.

For Frank, the break in the rains, if they lasted long enough, might help him get a lead on the issue that brought him all the way out here in the first place. Any good modeling requires that you first use the model to make a prediction, then gather data and compare the actual weather to the prediction, and finally tweak the model in response to any discrepancies in preparation for the next round of predictions. However, the previous summer, the National Weather Service models exhibited a discrepancy that Frank could not make sense of. Nearly every sunny weekend, the measured winds would diverge in a way that could only be replicated by modeling a tiny area of extraordinarily low pressure over a particular spot. Such things can sometimes happen over a tremendous heat source such as an active caldera, but usually not this strongly, and never *only* on weekends. Frank was able to get a research grant and rent a modest house very near the predicted epicenter, but he had arrived in mid-winter, and he hadn't seen a single sunny day since.

Frank's quiet contemplation of the mountain ended with the all-too-familiar rumble of his neighbor's ancient diesel Ford F-350 as it came into the neighborhood. True to type, Tim downshifted, causing that old diesel to spew a cloud of black smoke right in front of Frank. At the same time, Tim rocked his steering wheel just enough to make his homemade 'truck nuts' swing wildly from his hitch as if the truck itself was strutting. Tim worked the graveyard shift at one of the many warehouses down in the valley and tended to arrive home right about the time that Frank was starting his commute. Tim was overbearingly friendly and sociable, and when he found out his new neighbor was also a relatively young white male living alone, he made a point of 'greeting' Frank like a bro. The arrival of the dreaded F350 broke Frank out of his reverie, motivating him to get in his own vehicle to begin the long, painful Tuesday morning commute to the University of Washington.

Frank's organization had negotiated an office for him in the Atmospheric Sciences and Geophysics building, where he would have ready access to the University's modeling computers. There, he spent the morning configuring his simulations to integrate data from dozens of portable weather stations. Placing those weather stations had required scouting candidate locations for a couple of miles in every direction from his house and then negotiating with the landowners. Businesses weren't too bad, but much of the target area is semi-rural, interspersed with denser suburbs. People out there (and their dogs) don't always take kindly to strangers knocking on their doors, and it's hard to look 'official' when you are drenched to the bone. Frank would be damned if he were going to waste any of those hard-negotiated stations, so he checked his connections and code over and over while he waited for the anomaly to recur.

But lunch is lunch, and Frank was a foodie who would never let work interfere with it. This day, the sun was still shining, so Frank grabbed his jacket and his rather sizable lunch bag and headed for the plaza between the chemistry and aero-astro buildings. There were only a half-dozen broad benches spaced out around a circular fountain, so Frank was more than a little pleased to find an empty one. His lunch today consisted of generous helpings of St. Louis-style beef brisket, cornbread, and baked beans. Yeah, it was a little light on green vegetables, but he had spent the entire weekend smoking the brisket himself, following a recipe he learned from his father. Even cold, the smell was garnering hungry looks from passersby.

Engrossed, Frank was startled when a soft voice said, ""May I join you?""

He barely managed not to choke on his bite of cornbread when he looked up to see the divine visage smiling back at him. She appeared to be about his age, although a face like that doesn't show age, and he could be off by five years in either direction. Steeply arched eyebrows, a small chin, and broad cheekbones surrounded piercing brown eyes so dark they were almost black. Her eyelashes were almost lost under her epicanthic folds, and the whole visage was framed by straight, jet-black hair, center-parted and flowing around her shoulders. When he was unable to get a word out, she gestured around the plaza and said, ""The other benches are full.""

Frank slid himself and his spread-out lunch to one end and motioned for her to sit down. Then, finally winning his war with the cornbread, he managed to hold out a sauce-and-crumb-dappled hand and said, ""Doctor Frank Mercer, National Weather Service, prediction modeling"".

She looked at his hand without touching it while she sat down. Placing her lunch bag on the bench, she said, ""NCWCP? In Maryland? You're a long way from home. Doctor Rachel Nguyen, UW Physics."" Frank was... not good at casual social situations, but Rachel seemed unfazed by his awkwardness. Instead, she reached into her lunch bag and pulled out two paper napkins. Handing them to Frank, she nodded at his lunch and said, ""That smells amazing. What is it?""

He told her about the pleasure and ordeal that is cooking brisket the proper way, going on for perhaps too long, while unconsciously continuing to wipe his now thoroughly cleaned hand, until finally she just reached over and took her napkins back. Then she dug two large plastic-wrapped Vietnamese-style shrimp spring rolls and a container of peanut sauce from her bag. ""I'll trade you one homemade spring roll and some of my special dipping sauce for half of your remaining brisket.""

Ah, the privilege of being a professor; If you don't have a class or meeting or other timed event to get back to, you can, on occasion, take a long lunch out by the fountain. Frank nattered on about how a childhood tornado trauma in St. Louis sparked his interest in weather modeling, his work at NOAA, and the specific problem that led him to Seattle. When he finally remembered to shut up about himself and ask her about her, he was actually surprised that she was still listening. To the contrary, she seemed actually to be interested, or perhaps just very good at putting him at ease. But when it was her turn to talk about her work, he didn't understand many of the terms she used, and kind of hoped he was misunderstanding her use of the terms he did understand. Otherwise...

""So, you have a theory on how to, um, bend space to make two points that are far apart in our spatial view become functionally adjacent? So you can, er, staple them together with a, what? A star gate?""

""Not just a theory. We built them. Two of them. One in Seattle, one in Sidney.""

""And... you can step into the gate in Seattle and step out into Sidney?""

""Well, no. That was the plan, but there's the gotcha. Space has a rigidity to it. Think of a long piece of rebar. You can bend it in a broad curve quite easily, but it takes a lot of force to bend it in a tight curve. Seattle and Sidney are too close. In fact, Seattle and Proxima Centauri are too close. What we need is a second gate that is further away, like, entirely different galaxy further away.""

Frank liked modeling the weather. Weather is real, tangible, something you can see, hear, smell, and feel. Physicists like Doctor Nguyen use a specialized language of quantum mechanics, relativity, or cosmic strings to describe theories about things that are too small, too large, too distant, or too bizarre to be directly experienced. As they parted, Frank was left wondering what 'space' is that it even makes sense to talk about bending it? But... damn, she was pleasant to talk with.

By evening, the rain had returned. Frank, head down and collar up, slogged his way through the twilight toward his car, unaware that, a couple of buildings west, Rachel and her team were collecting new data that would affect his investigation.

**Quickly about me** (at the risk of some chest thumping): I'm a former international disputes lawyer turned wannabe entrepreneur. Spent a few years doing international arbitration & some UK Civil Disputes with one of India's largest firms (my reporting Partner was a barrister), then moved in-house handling regulatory and dispute work for one of India's largest FMCG brands. I'd always been fascinated by tech since I was a kid, but law felt like the ""practical"" choice at the time. Recently, I've been helping litigation funds and law firms build AI workflows for different things: lead intake, qualification, data transformation consistency, and document analysis - which is where this particular story begins.

I thought I had this whole AI document thing figured out.

For months, I'd been building RAG bots for demos‚Äînothing fancy, just text documents, FAQs, maybe some Excel sheets here and there. Vectorize everything, throw in some prompt guardrails to keep the AI from wandering off into hallucination-land, and boom! Reliable answers. I didn't encounter any hallucinations once I built guard-rails in the system to get it to stick religiously to the knowledge base. Simple RAG.

So when a third-party litigation fund approached me to build an analysis workflow for their case files, I figured: How hard could this be? It's just more text, right? 

Spoiler alert: I was spectacularly, hilariously wrong. 

Here's what I thought I was signing up for: feed litigation documents into my tried-and-true pipeline, maybe write some fancier prompts about legal concepts, and watch it work its magic. After all, I'd already solved the ""hard"" part‚Äîgetting AI to stay grounded in source material without making stuff up. I figured that retrieval would be easier than analysis.

# The Plot Twist That Broke My Brain

I fed my first batch of case documents through the system, asked for a comprehensive litigation analysis, and... it was brilliant. Genuinely impressive. The AI identified key liability issues, analyzed procedural requirements, broke down the legal arguments with the precision of a seasoned litigator. It was able to search through public annual reports of the counterparty, highlighted some on-going litigations, etc. It was great and I was feeling pretty smug.

Then I asked it to find the primary damages claim amount.

""The damages claim appears to be $600,000.""

I was positively excited and in my excitement I missed reading a zero. After I scrolled through the complaint. The actual damages sought were **$6.9 million**. The claim amount needed to be calculated from across different heads - like ""Breach of Contract A - $X""; ""Delay in Performance of Contract B - $Y"" and the like.

I dug deeper, it couldn't straight up tell me where the amount came from, but after doing a ctrl + F with the exact number it spit out, I traced the culprit. It was talking about some random vendor invoices from 2019 which were completely unrelated to the actual damages calculation. The AI had somehow latched onto a throwaway reference buried in discovery materials and decided *that* was more important than the clearly stated $6.9 million claims.

[How my tool was effectively functioning](https://preview.redd.it/pzpygixg1qmf1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7860a5496f9fa3069e6f803469e566570c6a5165)

**Down the Rabbit Hole of ""Smart"" Solutions**

You know that moment when you're convinced the problem is just one clever tweak away from being solved? I lived in that moment for *weeks*.

***Attempt #1 - Decision Tree:*** Maybe I could create a logical hierarchy‚Äîcheck the complaint first, then amended complaints, then discovery responses. The AI would dutifully follow my decision tree and confidently return some random settlement amount from step 2.

***Attempt #2 - Consensus:*** Fine, I'll ask it three times and take the majority vote. Result: $600,000, $2.1 million, and $450,000. At least it was consistently inconsistent, though none of these were anywhere close to the actual $6.9 million.

***Attempt #3 - Clearer Prompting:*** I wrote increasingly elaborate prompts. ""Focus specifically on the Prayer for Relief section."" ""Look for the primary damages claim, not incidental costs."" ""Ignore exhibit materials when calculating main damages."" Each tweak just led to new and creative ways to find irrelevant numbers.

The most frustrating part? Explaining why the plaintiff's legal theory might succeed or fail got a response that would make a litigation partner proud. But ask it to find the one number that the entire case was built around, the number literally bolded in the complaint summary and suddenly it became a very expensive random number generator.

# The Metadata Lightbulb Moment

After far too much coffee and borderline unhealthy obsession with this problem, I finally had my breakthrough moment. The issue was that the AI knew **WHAT** to look for broadly (i.e claim amounts) but it didn't know **WHERE** to look for it because vectors are matched semantically. So it especially struggled with numbers. 

I needed to add coordinates to every chunk of my vectorized documents containing metadata about exactly where that content lived: page numbers, section headers, document types (complaint vs. exhibit vs. discovery), and paragraph positions. Great - solved in theory now to just apply it.

For context - I was initially doing the entire analysis on n8n from document ingestion & vectorization (separate workflow) to document analysis (separate workflow). And I ran into my next problem here. I needed to chunk the document with code and pass it to the vectorization nodes by adding metadata to each chunk. I underestimated how resource intensive this would be. My n8n kept crashing (I run a self-hosted instance) - I increased memory, upgraded my VPS - nothing worked. The community clarified that n8n had a known issue with memory leak from code nodes which caused crashes. I had to split my workflow into 2 different systems: One built on Google Cloud to handle chunking, metadata injection, and vectorization. The other workflow retained on n8n to handle the analysis. 

# What Actually Works Now

After a few tries I had my Eureka moment and it worked! Suddenly my tool could pin-point the exact page, paragraph number with remarkable accuracy. With metadata-enabled chunking, my litigation document analysis workflow went from ""impressively wrong"" to ""actually useful for investment decisions"".

I'm mentioning the stack that worked for me:

***Chunking:*** Google Cloud Run Python Function - PyMuPDF for PDF extraction with metadata like page numbers, etc. With Gemini built-in to handle edge cases of boundary detection (where there aren't clear line/paragraph breaks, etc.)

***Vectorization:*** Open 3 Text Large Embedding with Qdrant (self-hosted) - the metadata is passed as a payload to each chunk.

***Security:*** Moving to GCloud also helped me better secure the document upload process - I was able to generate signed URLs for upload, provide e2e encryption, which automatically triggered the chunking & vectorization process. The security wasn't perfect - we were working on an MVP then.

***Analysis agent:*** Gemini 2.5 pro (the 1M Context Window is just too OP and useful for large analyses) with a detailed system prompt.

The final result - a fairly cost efficient workflow. The total workflow with over 20-30 attempts of chunking, vectorization, analysis of a 5k + page binder cost me less than $30 (not including self-hosting cost - which was around $20 for a month).

 **My Take Aways**

I'm going to be honest here: most of what I thought I knew about building ""smart"" document analysis was wrong.

I went into this thinking I was some hot shot because I'd built a few demo bots that didn't hallucinate. Turns out there's a massive difference between processing clean FAQ documents and dealing with the absolute chaos that is litigation case files.

The hardest lesson? **Preprocessing matters infinitely more than your prompts.** I spent days writing increasingly elaborate prompts when the metadata tagging system would have solved the problem in a day. I of course had to learn about resource limits and the like.

The even harder lesson? **AI is not magic.** It's a pattern-matching machine that needs incredibly specific instructions about what patterns to look for and where to look for them. When I finally accepted that and started working *with* how LLMs actually process information instead of fighting against it, everything clicked.

But here's what I'm genuinely curious about: 

(1) What techniques are you using for vectorization that preserve document coordinates and hierarchy? 

(2) How are you ensuring better security? (I for one am not fully convinced that Open-Source is the only way to ensure security. Even systems like Harvey leverage your existing foundational models.) 

I ended up building a custom chunking system that maintains page numbers, section headers, and document types, but I feel like I reinvented some wheels along the way. Are you using existing libraries that handle this well, or did you also end up building your own preprocessing pipeline?

And for anyone else who's hit similar walls with document analysis‚Äîwhat was your ""metadata moment""? That point where you realized the problem wasn't your AI, but your data preparation?

I'm particularly interested in hearing from people working with financial documents, legal filings, or anything where getting the numbers exactly right matters more than sounding smart.

Tired of waiting for nothing. Although I knew you promised me that you will visit me soon. However, it's been the same words I received coming from you over the years. It has been six long years of long distance. No progress. Ang meron lang is yung promise. Pero it's been six years na kasi puro promise. I love you so damn much and it hurt me so much to let you go. But I had to. Especially if hindi na ako masaya. And my needs are not met emotionally, physically, you name it.

I asked myself if tama lang ba tong ginawa ko? Am I too selfish for choosing myself? At bakit ngayon lang nag sink in sa akin yung breakup natin? It took me months bago maiyak nang ganto.

Alam mo yung mas nakakainis? Miss na miss na kita. Idk if you noticed but I still checked your profile from time to time. Hate myself for doing that tbh. Part of me is still hoping na magkita pa rin tayo over a cup of coffee. Na magkabalikan tayo. Idk. Sana nag-cheat ka na lang para mas madali sa akin mag-move on.

Just wanna let you know na you're still the best thing that ever happened to me. For now I want you to fulfill all your goals. I will fulfill mine. If we are meant to be, then we will be. Universe will find its way. Wag mong isipin just because hindi ikaw yung pinakamayaman sa amerika ay yun na ang dahilan kung bakit ako nakipaghiwalay. Hell no. Kaya kong tumayo mag-isa. If pera lang ang habol ko, hindi ko na paaabutin ng six years ang relasyon na to. I cared for you. In fact, I still do. Your genuine personality and your kindness are what makes me drawn to you. 

If there's one thing na magpapatigil sa akin na umasa is kapag nakahanap ka na ng iba. Then I will finally let you go... for real. I want you to be happy. Iyan din naman ang gusto mo para sakin diba? Na maging masaya.

Happy birthday. Be happy for me. And don't be too hard on yourself. Okay?",2,1756806646.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

1n6f7yo,https://www.reddit.com/r/WebCarrots/comments/1n6f7yo/the_real_deal_on_keyword_gaps/,The Real Deal on Keyword Gaps,"Let‚Äôs be real‚Äîkeyword gaps can be a serious buzzkill for your content. You‚Äôre absolutely right to want to close them, but here‚Äôs the thing‚Äîit‚Äôs not just ‚Äúmy homepage vs. their homepage.‚Äù Nope. It‚Äôs all the stuff your competitors have put out there that‚Äôs now outshining you.  
  
We‚Äôre talking about the whole digital jungle: your website, sure, but also their blog posts, social media updates, LinkedIn profiles, forums, comments, emails‚Äîeven that slick brochure they hand out at trade shows.  
  
Now here‚Äôs where it gets interesting‚Äîthere‚Äôs a way to go way beyond just fixing keyword gaps. I‚Äôm talking about a massive power-up that can make you outrank just about any content your competitors have. It‚Äôs called Content Gap.  
  
Quick snapshot: keyword gaps and content gaps? They‚Äôre not twins‚Äîthey‚Äôre more like distant cousins. Keywords are just‚Ä¶ words. Sometimes they‚Äôre crammed into a page because an SEO tool screamed, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre missing this one!‚Äù So you jam it in, rerun the tool, and‚Äîbam!‚Äîyou get that green checkmark. Feels good, right?  
  
But here‚Äôs the million-dollar question: Are you really good now?  
  
Well‚Ä¶ if you just sprinkled in words for the sake of it‚Äîno story, no depth‚Äîyou‚Äôre probably not. If you‚Äôre using that ‚Äúas long as the word is in there‚Äù mentality, chances are you‚Äôre still miles away from closing the real gap.  
  
Worse, you might have annoyed search engines, missed the AI-driven search game completely, and‚Äîbig one here‚Äîpushed your bounce rate through the roof. People today can sniff out keyword stuffing from a mile away. Nobody likes to read something that sounds like a robot had too much coffee.  
  
Smooth content is the opposite‚Äîit‚Äôs when someone glances at your page and instantly gets it. No keyword tripwires, no awkward phrasing‚Äîjust natural, clear writing that hits the point.  
  
Here‚Äôs an example: instead of screaming ‚ÄúCALL US‚ÄîWE DELIVER 24/7 SERVICE‚Äù, you could say: ‚ÄúCall us anytime‚Äîwe‚Äôre here for you day or night, around the clock.‚Äù Same meaning, but smoother. Feels more human, right?  
Now that you see the difference, let‚Äôs dig a little deeper.  
  
Here‚Äôs what you need to know:  
  
‚Ä¢ Content gaps are about missing topics, not just missing words.  
‚Ä¢ Old-school SEO is fading fast. AI search engines are the new gatekeepers.  
‚Ä¢ AI is smart‚Äîit turns topics into keywords and checks if you actually cover what people are searching for.  
‚Ä¢ Semantics and fancy word swaps aren‚Äôt enough‚Äîyou need both keywords and solid topic coverage.  
‚Ä¢ Well-written, detailed paragraphs often win over raw keyword dumping, especially with AI.  
  
The truth? In today‚Äôs firehose of information, people just want clear, easy-to-digest content. If they find what they‚Äôre looking for quickly, they stick around. And sticking around means lower bounce rates, higher engagement, and a better shot at turning visitors into customers.  
  
Bottom line: close those content gaps, make your stuff better than the competition‚Äôs, and you‚Äôre not just in the game‚Äîyou‚Äôre the one to beat.  
  
So yeah, give them all the answers, make them feel confident you‚Äôve got their back, and you might just go from an option to the choice.

Maybe I‚Äôm overreacting though.

We met when we were in college. Some of the best days of my life were with her. I love her so much, and even to this very day I love her. She was spontaneous and funny, but focused and smart. She had a great body and was great in bed.

We graduated the same year and we both shared a career based aspiration over anything else. We were workaholics and we always looked, studied, and helped each other out when it came to jobs. We would work part time jobs, as we searched and eventually my then girlfriend found a full time job which changed.

I got a job soon after and we were very work oriented and promotion centered. Eventually I got a promotion and she did too. Currently I‚Äôm comfortable where I‚Äôm at and she is still striving for another position at her spot. We both have different jobs, so our career trajectory is a bit different, but we nonetheless are proud of our accomplishments.

I‚Äôd argue she‚Äôs carrying this marriage and I owe so so SO much to her and I have no idea where I would be if I didn‚Äôt sit next to her in that course level 100 class.

I am very much happy with where we are, but I feel like that spark and connection has faded away. I still love her so much and I‚Äôm so proud of her work. That focused and smart element of her is still there and is stronger than ever. That spontaneous and funny side has seemingly vanished. 

Gone are the days of nights out, pillow talks, friendly get togethers, and deep intimacy. We are both exhausted from work and want to do nothing but just kick back and relax. Watch some TV, eat dinner, maybe even do a little more work, and go to bed. On the occasion we may see a movie, eat at some local chain, or have coffee, but they just don‚Äôt feel the same. It has this obligation feeling to it that more so ‚Äústrikes off‚Äù that feeling of having fun, rather than actually having it. We don‚Äôt really have much of a sex life anymore sadly, and I just sort of feel like it‚Äôs something we ‚Äúgrew out of‚Äù.

I‚Äôd love to go out and plan or reserve some expensive dinner with her. A fancy place where I decide the week before if I should wear cologne. Maybe she‚Äôs picking out some beautiful outfit and what kind of lipstick she would wear. I would love to travel when it‚Äôs not business oriented and even go out of the country. A cruise or some destination where we meet some locals and befriend them for the day. Maybe spice up our sexual life. I‚Äôd love to just walk around naked in our place for a day, something we both fantasized about but alas, never did.

Maybe I‚Äôm saying too much, but the point is was there a point where I should have told her to slow down? Tell myself? I feel like we spent our 20s working hard that we owe each other some time together. A little ease on the brakes, but it feels too late now. Is the life I ask for something I missed? Does it come later?

******************
Skylar
6th grade:
I‚Äôm walking into school behind my brother and Oliver, one of his best friends. They really don‚Äôt pay any
attention to me and only let me follow them to school because Mary makes them bring me. Mary is my
nanny, she has been with me as long as I can remember. My dad is the beta of the pack and really
busy, so Mary was brought on to teach me how to ‚Äòbehave like a lady,‚Äô which basically means teach me
to be silent unless spoken to and out of the way of the men. She does nothing of the sort, but my dad
doesn‚Äôt know that, as long as I make a good show when he‚Äôs around.
My brother spends most of his time with the future Alphas, Cameron and Dakota, the future Delta, Sam
and the future Gamma Oliver. They travel in a group wherever they go, they are almost worse than
some of the girls here.
Mary told him to make sure I got to and from school safely after I came home last week with a bruise
under my eye and scrapes up my arm. I tried to tell her it was an accident and that I tripped, it was not
a big deal, but she didn‚Äôt believe me. She knows I have been having trouble with kids at the school. I
live in a werewolf pack that feeds on hierarchy and dominance, of course at some point we are all
going to start trying to showcase our dominance, we‚Äôre middle schoolers.
What I have seen though is it‚Äôs more the non-ranked kids who are trying to show off for the ranked kids.
They are trying to gain status by being noticed. It‚Äôs funny to think that some kids are popular, just for
the rank they were born into, not what they have actually done. Obviously, everybody wants to be the
Alpha‚Äôs kids friends. That‚Äôs the height of all popularity. My brother, Sam and Oliver aren‚Äôt far behind
being rank born. I, however, don‚Äôt matter, even though I am the Beta‚Äôs daughter and have Beta blood. I
am the reason that my mother is dead, and that is reason enough to shun me to lower than an Omega.
That is why Mary fears for me, she has seen how kids openly treat me and no adult does a thing to
stop it, not even my father.
‚ÄúMove it fatty. You‚Äôre taking up the whole hallway and walking slower than a turtle. Are you sure you‚Äôre
a wolf?‚Äù Kaley sneers behind me. I just move to the side to try and get out of her way. She sticks her
foot between my legs and I trip sideways head first into a locker not being able to catch myself with my
armful of books.
The crash brings everyone to a halt. All eyes are on me, but the only ones I care about are my
brother‚Äôs. He turned to look at the sound and when I made eye contact he just shook his head, rolled
his eyes and turned to walk away, Oliver and Kaley following him. The rest of the kids in the hallway
disperse too, some laughing quietly, others not so quietly, but no one stops to help me up.
7th Grade:
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you ever question my authority in front of another student again!‚Äù Kaley shoulder checks me into
a door leading out to the courtyard in the middle of the school.
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt question your authority, I told you that you can‚Äôt hit kids just because they are in your way. If
you were late, that is not their fault.‚Äù I shouldn‚Äôt snap back at her, it only fuels her fire, but she‚Äôs starting
to get on my nerves. She was late because she skipped second period to go get coffee with her friends
and was late getting back to third period, who happens to be a teacher that will report her to her father.
Although nothing ever seems to happen when she is reported.
I right myself, set my focus down the hallway and move to walk away from the door that was holding
me up, but before I can get two steps, Marnie, one of Kaley‚Äôs little minions steps out to trip me, then
proceeds to dump her iced latte on my head. I hear cackles of laughter then others join in, meaning we
attracted a crowd.
I look up to see my brother and his friends joining in with the laughter. ‚ÄúMaybe if you trained a little
harder and lost some of that baby fat, you wouldn‚Äôt be so clumsy.‚Äù Kaley says not-so quietly to me then,
‚ÄúHey boys, are we up for hanging out at the fire pit tonight?‚Äù To my brother and his friends.",1,1756806350.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

However, no one knew that she was already a piano expert at the age of ten. When the song ended, everyone was shocked!
=====
A woman in a white T-shirt and jeans walked out of the train station in Douburgh with a suitcase. 
Her delicate face turned slightly red as the sun hit her. She tucked wisps of curly hair behind her ears. Under her arched eyebrows were a pair of bright and pretty eyes, a slim nose, and Cherry lips. She looked so beautiful even though she had no make-up on. 
""Hello! You are Annabel Hewitt, right? I'm the driver sent by the Benton family.""

Annabel nodded and followed the driver into the car casually. She was already worn out. 

On the way, the driver stole glances at the woman, whose eyes were closed as she rested in the back seat. 

This woman was Rupert Benton's fiancee. 

Rupert Benton was the most eligible bachelor in the city. At just twenty-one years old, he was already the CEO of Benton Group. He was way ahead of his peers. He was a vigorous, resourceful and no-nonsense person, causing many in the business world to be afraid of him. 

His grandfather, Bruce Benton, took it upon himself to find a wife for him. And he picked Annabel, a girl from the countryside. 

With his hands on the steering wheel, the driver took another look at Annabel's innocent face and clicked his tongue. He envisaged that she would have a hard time with the Benton family. 

At this time, Annabel slowly opened her eyes and looked at the strange city with a calm expression. 

The car arrived at the Benton family's residence soon. The driver carried Annabel's luggage for her. 

Annabel barely had one foot inside the house when a well-dressed woman appeared. She eyed Annabel from head to toe with a look of utter disdain. 

""Tracy!""

""Yes, Mrs. Benton.""

As soon as Tracy was given a signal, she began to spray the disinfectant all over Annabel. 

The well-dressed woman was Erica Benton, Rupert's mother. With her hands akimbo, she ordered, ""Her shoes and hair. Spray them, too.""

Annabel's face and body were soon covered with droplets of disinfectant. The pungent smell made her nose a little itchy. She uttered coldly, ""What is wrong with you?""

Erica flipped out immediately. 

""I heard that you're from the countryside, but I thought you would at least be well-behaved. It appears you are the same as the wayward and rude girls they breed over there. I'm doing this because I don't want you to bring any virus or bacteria into this household. Do you want us to get infected with whatever you are carrying?""

Annabel is not a person who likes to listen to people's nonsense.. She would have walked out if she hadn't made a deal with her grandfather. 

""In that case, you should spray some disinfectant in your mouth because it stinks!""

With this, Annabel shoved the servant aside and walked in. 

""You... Oh my..."" Erica pointed at Annabel with a trembling hand. Tracy hurriedly comforted her. 

In the living room, a girl who looked about the same age as Annabel was sitting on the sofa. She had on designer clothes and bright makeup. Her expression was more condescending than Erica's as she looked at Annabel. She was Rupert's cousin, Cathy Benton. 

""Are you Annabel Hewitt, Rupert's fiancee?"" Cathy rolled her eyes when she saw that Annabel wasn't dressed in designer clothes. ""Gosh, Grandpa has no taste. I can't believe he chose someone like you. Anyway, I heard you came here by train. You should have told us you are too poor to afford a plane ticket. We would have bought one for you. Wait, it seems there isn't an airport in the countryside.""

Annabel looked at Cathy with one of her eyebrows raised. 

She wondered if every member of this family was so arrogant. 

There was indeed no airport where she came from, but her grandfather had booked an entire high-speed train to Douburgh just for her. These arrogant people had no idea that she traveled as luxuriously as someone who flew first class. 

Besides, she could have flown here in a private jet if she wanted. 

Annabel could easily make it clear to these people, but she didn't. She just went upstairs. 

Annoyance clouded Cathy's face once she saw Annabel ascending the stairs. She wasn't used to anyone ignoring her, so she followed her. 

""Where is my room?"" Annabel asked the maid behind. 

""Here!"" Cathy said, pointing at a door in the hallway before the maid could reply. 

She pushed the door open and added condescendingly, ""You have never stayed in a bedroom as big as this, have you? You should cherish it while living in here. I'm Rupert's cousin, Cathy. You should fawn over me if you...""

Cathy had barely finished speaking when Annabel walked into the room and shut the door in her face. This made her angrier. 

""Ah! How dare that pauper be so conceited? What was Grandpa thinking?""

The maid warily moved closer and asked, ""Miss, but isn't this Mr. Benton's room?""

Cathy cast a scornful glance at the door. 

""Shush! Don't say a word to her. Rupert hates anyone being in his space or using his things. When he finds out that she's here, just tell him that she chose to stay in this room.""

Cathy's eyes glistened with slyness as she spoke. 

Chapter 2  Night-long Cuddle
Annabel didn't realize that this room belonged to someone else. When she saw that the bathroom was stocked with only men's products, she just assumed that the Bentons were trying to get on her nerves. 

""What an incredible family!"" she muttered sarcastically, walking under the shower. 

She only had to put up with this for three months. She had struck a bet with her grandfather. If she still had no feelings for Rupert after staying here for three months, their marriage would be called off. 

A maid brought in dinner for her once Annabel got out of the bathroom. She ate it and fell asleep almost immediately. 

It was already midnight when Rupert finally came back home from a business dinner. 

He was aware Annabel was arriving today. Bruce had told him to pick her up, but he refused under the guise of having many things to do at work. He had no interest in his fiancee. As far as he was concerned, the marriage would be canceled sooner or later. 

Rupert was fagged out. He managed to take a shower and went straight to bed. 

He was very drunk, so he didn't notice that someone else was in his room until he lay down on his bed. 

The large bulge under the quilt startled him. He moved away abruptly. The room was dimly lit, so he couldn't see the woman's face clearly. Before he could think straight, she rolled over and hugged him. She muttered, ""Teddy, don't be naughty. You should sleep now.""

Rupert froze completely. 

This woman had a very familiar scent, just like that girl... 

It was soothing as his nose pressed against her neck. For some reason, Rupert found himself hugging her back. He fell asleep with Annabel in his arms. 

Strangely for an insomniac, Rupert didn't wake up at any point during the night. He slept like a well-fed baby. 

He had a dream that night. It was about what happened to him ten years ago. In a dark room, a girl embraced him tightly and said in a sweet voice, ""Don't be scared. No harm shall come to you. I'll protect you.""

Later in the dream, he met that girl again. It felt so real. 

The next morning, Cathy woke up at the crack of dawn. She had been hoping to hear the news that Annabel was thrown out of the room once Rupert got back home. But the maid said nothing of such happened. 

Why was that? Didn't Rupert come back home last night? But his car was in the garage. 

Rupert hated anyone being in his space. He couldn't possibly have slept in the same bed as a strange woman. 

Consumed by curiosity and uncertainty, Cathy went to knock on Rupert's door. ""Hey, Rupert! Breakfast is ready. Don't you have a meeting this morning? You should get up now!""

The noise woke up the two people who were fast asleep at the same time. Annabel immediately felt the warmth of someone else. Her head wasn't on a pillow but on a hard chest. 

She looked up, only to meet the sharp eyes of a man. She sat up immediately and was wide awake. ""Who are you?""

Rupert's eyes darkened. ""Annabel Hewitt?""

Since he knew her name, Annabel assumed that he was her fiance, Rupert. But why was he in her room? 

She was just about to question him again when he uttered, ""You came to my room and slept in my bed on your first day in this household. I must say that you are really something!""

""What?"" Annabel looked completely confused. He just said this was his bed? How was that possible? 

Was every member of this family mad and troublesome? 

""Oh my!"" Annabel exclaimed as her mind went to the men's products she saw in the bathroom yesterday. It seemed Cathy had tricked her. 

In haste, Annabel got off the bed and looked at him coldly. ""Just to be clear, I didn't mean to sleep here. Cathy told me this was my room. No offense but I'm not in any way interested in you. come to think of it, I fell asleep alone. Why didn't you realize that someone else was in the bed when you got back? and why did you hold me in your arms for the whole night? Don't tell me you have a crush on me?""

A look of embarrassment clouded Rupert's face when he heard her words. He couldn't deny that he held her in his arms for the whole night. 

Just like last night, he was stunned when he met Annabel's eyes. 

Her beautiful eyes were just like that girl's. 

Annabel squinted at him with a smile. 

""What? Why are you staring at me like that? Are you obsessed with me?""

Rupert came to his senses. His face darkened again. He ordered coldly, ""Get out! And don't come into this room ever again!""

Annabelle gritted her teeth.. She then left with her belongings without hesitation. 

This was their first meeting, but they already didn't like each other. 

Cathy, who was still at the door, was surprised to see Annabel come out. 

Annabel said with an ambiguous smile, ""Good morning! As you wish, your cousin held me in his arms and slept for the whole night. We got along pretty well. You must be happy about that.""

""Nonsense!"" Cathy's face was livid. She didn't believe that at all. 

In her opinion, there was no way Rupert would like Annabel, let alone hold her in his arms for hours. 

But the fact that they had slept together for the whole night was plain to see. 

Chapter 3 New Secretary
Annabel walked away with a fake smile. 

Cathy lost it. ""You bumpkin! Stop right there. I'm not done talking. Let me tell you, Rupert won't marry you!""

Just then, Rupert walked out of the room. 

""Ermm... Rupert..."" Cathy stuttered, moving back in fear. 

Rupert's face darkened. It was obvious that he was angry, so Cathy didn't dare to say anything more. 

Annabel asked a maid to take her to her room. She unpacked her things and then went downstairs for breakfast. 

Erica, Cathy, and Rupert were already seated at the dining table. 

Erica began to criticize her as soon as Annabel sat down. ""Weren't you taught proper etiquette? Not only did you wake up so late, but you also didn't bother preparing breakfast. Do you think you're already the hostess here?""

Taking a glance at Erica, Annabel said flatly, ""I'm not a servant either.""

She would never make breakfast for this family. 

Although Rupert didn't say anything as the two argued, there was no denying that he didn't like Annabel either. 

The atmosphere in the dining room was tense. They ate in silence for most of the time. After breakfast, Erica held out a bank card to Annabel. 

""This card is loaded with about five thousand dollars. Buy yourself some decent clothes before going to the company. Remember to behave well. You mustn't cause any trouble for Rupert.""

To develop the relationship between the two, Bruce proposed that Annabel work in the company as Rupert's secretary. Leonard Hewitt, Annabel's grandfather, agreed to the arrangement. She didn't refuse. After all, it was only temporary. 

Her new employment was no biggie for her, but the bank card was! It was obvious that Erica looked down on her. ""Thanks, but no thanks,"" Annabel said in a sarcastic manner. 

There was nothing wrong with her clothes, as far as she was concerned. They were specially made for her. That was why the Bentons thought they were not designer clothes. Without waiting for Erica or anyone else to retort, she went upstairs to get ready for work. 

She had just gotten into her room when her phone buzzed. It was a bank notification. The sum of fifty million dollars had been transferred into her account. 

A text message from Leonard came through. 

""Dear, I hope they are treating you well over there. I transferred some money to your account. Buy whatever you want. And don't forget to inform me if anyone bullies you. I love you.""

Annabel smiled and texted back, ""Grandpa, I'm not happy here. They are bullying me. It's not funny at all.""

Leonard replied almost immediately, ""Glad to hear that. Anyway, I'm going fishing. Talk to you later.""

Annabel couldn't believe her eyes. 

Sighing, she changed into a professional suit and walked out of the house. The driver opened the door for her. As soon as she got into the car, she found that Rupert was also inside. 

""Didn't you say that you had no interest in me? Why did you agree to work as my secretary then?"" His charming voice had a hint of irony in it. There was also a smirk at the corners of his lips. 

""Don't get any ridiculous ideas just because I agreed. I promised my grandpa to stay with you for three months. Once the timeline expires, we will cancel the marriage,"" Annabel responded, glancing at him indifferently. 

""Huh?"" Rupert sneered. ""Aren't you worried that you will fall in love with me in the next three months? I guess you'll be reluctant to leave then.""

Annabel was amused by his words. 

""Funny you, Rupert. You clearly have a swollen head. For your information, I will never fall for you. Get down from your high horse.""

Although Annabel knew that Rupert was good-looking, that didn't matter to her. He had the repulsive character that she hated in men. 

Rupert pulled a long face at her words. 

She would never fall for him? 

""We will see about that, Annabel. Don't ever forget what you said just now!""

In Rupert's opinion, Annabel was just playing hard to get. Why did she come to his home if she didn't feel a thing for him or wanted to be his wife? 

Annabel smiled and said, ""Okay, I'll keep it in mind. Don't worry. In three months, we will go our separate ways. By the way, we have to pretend not to know each other at the company. I don't want unnecessary drama there.""

Rupert kept in silent. 

Unbeknown to Annabel, she couldn't avoid drama at work. The news about Rupert's engagement had already spread like wildfire. People also knew that his fiancee was from the countryside. 

The employees in Benton Group were in a heated discussion. 

""Guys, have you heard the latest? Mr. Benton's fiancee will work here. She will be his secretary!""

""Oh my! I heard she's ugly. And that she's from the countryside. Since she's poor, she must have attended a substandard college. Can she even understand the documents?""

""Ha-ha! You can say that again. The way I see it, she won't be able to operate a computer.""

The words of the gossipers trailed off as soon as Rupert walked in with Annabel. Everyone's jaw dropped when they saw them. 

Chapter 4  His Superwoman
""Look! Who is that woman that came in with Mr. Benton? She's so beautiful and elegant!""

""Wow! Her legs are so straight and thin! I have never seen anyone as beautiful as her!""

""Is she Mr. Benton's fiancee?""

""How is that possible? It can't be!""

Many of the employees began to wonder who Annabel was. The most common guess was that she was a business partner. But when she left Rupert and went into the personnel department to sign in, they all realized who she was. The news spread in the company in no time. 

It turned out that the woman who came in with Rupert was Annabel. 

People didn't know what to believe anymore. Didn't they say that Annabel was an ugly bumpkin? How come she was drop-dead gorgeous? 

While Annabel was going over the necessary formalities, the employees in the secretarial department were gossiping about her. 

""Annabel is so beautiful! She's even prettier than Heather Norman!"" an employee commented. 

Nina Jones, the head of the department, had a frown on her face and disdain in her eyes. She said maliciously, ""Looks aren't everything. Beauty doesn't change the fact that she's a poor village girl who doesn't know anything about city life. She's not worthy enough to be Mr. Benton's wife.""

Annabel had just walked into the secretarial department when she heard these words. A hint of irony flashed in her eyes. She retorted in a clear voice, ""If I'm not worthy enough to be his wife, who is? You?""

Nina's face froze. She looked away and didn't dare to retort. She couldn't afford to offend Annabel. 

""Ahem! Mr. Benton earlier told me to treat you like every other person in this department. You will receive a fair amount of work despite your status. Here is the document about the advertisement the company is going to shoot today. It's yours to handle.""

With a sneer, Annabel took the document and left. 

The others surrounded Nina again. 

""Nina, is it Marcel's shoot? Annabel is new. Don't you think she will screw it up?""

A spark of mischief shone in Nina's eyes. The face of the advertisement was Marcel Brooks- young and bad-tempered celebrity. He was hard to please and work with. People always avoided him. She looked forward to seeing Annabel mess things up on her first day. 

As soon as Annabel got out, she went through the document that outlined the process of the advertisement. She raised her eyebrows when she saw Marcel's name in there; it was familiar. 

In the CEO's office, Rupert's assistant asked him, ""Nina Jones handed over Marcel's shoot to Miss Hewitt just now. Should I order someone to replace her?""

Marcel's elder brother was a friend of Rupert's since childhood. Everyone knew that Marcel had a bad temper. It went without saying that Annabel would suffer a lot at his hands if she worked with him today. 

Remembering what Annabel said to him this morning, Rupert finally replied, ""No, let her do it.""

He would take delight in her suffering. 

The company was in charge of everything for the shoot. Annabel and some employees went downstairs to welcome Marcel. 

A few minutes passed before a black Bentley drove into Benton Group's premises. Marcel got out wearing a pair of sunglasses. At the age of nineteen, he already had millions of fans all over the world. His fame contributed to his arrogance. He held his head up high and walked like he owned the place. 

Annabel walked up to him and extended her hand for a handshake. ""Welcome, Mr. Brooks. I'm Annabel Hewett, the person in charge of the shoot. It's my pleasure to meet you.""

Marcel didn't take her hand or exchange pleasantries. He just complained with a frown, ""It's so hot. Why didn't you bring an umbrella? Anyway, is everything all set? I don't have time to waste. By the way, buy me a cup of coffee before we begin anything. Don't get me a cheap one. I want one from that cafe downtown. They make the best...""

Marcel's words trailed off when he finally looked at the woman's face. His jaw dropped. 

""Holy moly! Annabel! Am I dreaming?""

Marcel took off his sunglasses and still looked incredulous. 

He hugged Annabel excitedly. 

""Annabel? Why are you here? You work here? When did that happen? Shouldn't you be traveling around the world now?""

Annabel stroked Marcel's head and said with a smile, ""Marc, long time no see. What did you say you wanted to drink again?""

""Nothing! I didn't say anything. What would you like to drink? I can get it for you.""

Everyone present was dumbfounded, to say the least. 

The ever-so-arrogant Marcel not only hugged Annabel but was also speaking to her politely. He even allowed her to stroke his head. 

Was this really Marcel or some clone who was passing off as him? 

Could it be that he was so respectful because Annabel was Rupert's fiancee? But he was usually arrogant in Rupert's presence. What was going on? 

The truth was that Annabel and Marcel met two years ago. 

At that time, Marcel was seventeen. He was filming in the countryside, very close to Annabel's home. 

Some thugs kidnapped him. Fortunately, Annabel saved him by chance. 

Marcel had fearfully watched her beat up the kidnappers so easily. He had thought he was going to die in captivity, but she had come to his rescue like a superwoman. 

She had invited him to her home. Much to his surprise, her home was even bigger than the mansion in Downton Abbey. 

It turned out that she was not only kind but also well-to-do. He couldn't help but hold her in high esteem. 

Chapter 5  Chivalrous Lad
The two walked into Benton Group. And the shooting went on smoothly. 

Some of the clothes weren't up to Marcel's taste. He complained about them. But when Annabel said that they were good, he immediately changed his opinion. 

He set aside his nitpicking attitude just because of her. Whenever he went out of line, Annabel's glance brought him to order. 

Marcel was intimidated by her. Asides from the fact that he respected her for saving his life, he feared that she would spank him if he annoyed her. 

It was estimated that the shoot would take five hours because of Marcel's attitude, but it took only two hours. 

Once it ended, Marcel pulled Annabel and said, ""Let's go. We have a lot of catching up to do. I'll treat you to dinner.""

""No, I can't. I'm not off duty yet!"" Annabel refused him coldly. 

Some of the employees were still on the set. They pretended to be busy, but they gossiped about the two on the spot. 

""What? Marcel offered to buy Annabel dinner but she turned him down.""

""Holy moly! What is she thinking? Doesn't she know who he is? Many girls would jump at the offer. How can she be so arrogant?""

""I wish he could take me instead. I can quit my job just to spend some time with him. Oh, Annabel is so foolish.""

Being rejected, Marcel wanted to cry. After thinking for a while, he asked, ""By the way, why did you start working here? Oh my! Did your family go bankrupt? If so, I can support you. You don't have to slave away here, okay?""

Annabel rolled her eyes and said, ""You know nothing, Marc. Now if you will excuse me...""

She then went back to work. 

Everyone who saw the scene thought Marcel would storm out in a fit of pique. To their greatest surprise, he smiled helplessly and went to the lounge to wait for Annabel until she got off work. 

By closing hour, Rupert walked out of his office and said to Annabel, ""Grandpa made a reservation at a restaurant. Let's go have dinner there.""

Rupert didn't want to, but Bruce threatened him. The man was hospitalized earlier after having a heart attack. On video call, he said, ""You must go. If you don't, I'll pull the plug on this ventilator. Do you want me to die?""

Rupert's hands were tied, so he had to agree. 

Annabel was about to reply when Marcel came in. 

""Annabel, you are off duty now, right? Can we have dinner now?""

It wasn't until Rupert coughed slightly that Marcel noticed his presence. 

""You are here, Rupert!"" he exclaimed. 

Did Annabel and Marcel know each other? Rupert looked at the two in confusion. 

Annabel, who had been silent, finally spoke. ""How about we all have dinner together?""

In the end, the three of them went to the restaurant that Bruce reserved earlier. 

During the ride, Marcel kept talking to Annabel, who replied in a friendly way from time to time. 

When they arrived, Marcel became chivalrous. He opened the door for Annabel and even pulled a chair for her. He also put food on her plate and poured her a glass of red wine. 

Rupert was relegated to the background. It was as if these two were in their own world, and he was just there to watch them. 

""By the way, you still haven't told me why you decided to work in Benton Group. Is there something between you and Rupert?""

Marcel suspected that they were involved with each other. 

Glancing at Rupert, Annabel answered, ""My grandpa asked me to work here. As for what is between us... We are engaged.""

Marcel spat out a mouthful of water. 

""You both are what? What a small world we live in! So, you are the countrywoman whom Rupert got engaged to?""

Annabel nodded casually. 

The rumor of the engagement was widespread in Douburgh, so Marcel knew about it. Since he knew about Annabel's background, he couldn't help but sigh because of how clueless the media was. 

She was indeed from the countryside, but she was far from being poor. The Hewitt family was super rich and had dozens of villas scattered around the world. 

""Are you two in love?"" Marcel looked at them in disbelief. 

""Don't get the wrong idea. We are not in love. The engagement will be canceled three months later,"" Annabel said calmly. 

Marcel breathed a sigh of relief and nodded. Without mincing words, he uttered, ""That's good. Rupert doesn't deserve you. I'm even better than him. You two are nothing alike. He's cold and boring. A marriage between the two of you would be a disaster.""

Rupert knifed the steak on his plate and chewed hard as fury brewed inside him. 

He didn't deserve Annabel? What nonsense! 

""That reminds me, Marcel. Your brother asked me to buy the car you have always wanted. He plans to give it to you. I think...""

""come on, Rupert. I didn't mean that. Can't you take a joke anymore?"" Marcel smiled awkwardly. 

They had a nice meal. After walking out of the restaurant, Annabel and Rupert bid Marcel farewell. 

""Bye, Annabel! I'll visit you whenever I'm free.""

Annabel stroked his head again as they hugged. She waved at him. ""Bye, Marc. Take care!""

She petted him as if he were Teddy, her Alaskan Malamute. 

He grunted and got into the car. On the way back, he finally complained, ""I see why you boldly said that you'll never fall in love with me. You're in love with someone else.""

1n6ezrb,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1n6ezrb/how_to_not_fall_into_old_habits_after_moving_to_a/,How to not fall into old habits after moving to a new place?,"I am moving. It's not exciting, nor a dream home or neighborhood, it's not a good time either - so it feels like a massive chore. I simply had to move out and I needed a little more space too. The chaos that it added to my life has been very very difficult. On top of that the stress of it all, the emotional disregulation, overthinking and the exhaustion cause me to not be able to sleep. I am going at a speed of a snail but pushing through it all every day regardless.

I want to make all this effort and struggle (that feels unreal) worth it.   
So here is the issue. I work from home and I don't do well with that, but I didn't have a dedicated work space until now and that was definitely part of the problem. So the big reason I chose this place was because I can now have a separate tiny office - a small room but it has a window, fits a desk and a bookcase. I am so grateful for that!   
  
However, I feel anxious in the new place, because it feels foreign. All the new noises, paint and furniture smells, lighting and uncertainty... It all triggers something in my brain that is not logical. Logically I know it will pass. I will get used to a new place and make it home. But because I am so unsettled it feels ubearable and I am impatient to make it feel familiar. I even made some light renovations so it looks more like home and it helps but now I think it's more about the functional pattern than visual aspect. I run out of energy and I want to speed up getting to that comforting feeling of being settled in a new place, and I desperately want to just get back to ""normal"" life. I had good plans before the move but now I catch myself wanting to recreate the same set ups that I had at my old place that DID NOT serve me. Just because it's easy and comforting. For example I bought myself an electricaly regulated standing desk that I always wanted but I procrastinate on putting it together and instead I think about how to set up a coffee table so I can sit with my laptop like previously at home (where I am distracted all the time, none work gets done until a day before deadline and I get a back and wrist pain).   
  
I am  so scared that I will get back to my old ways that weren't good for me. Or that even though I now have an office and live close to a park for my daily walks, my brain will find new obstacles. And I think that would be a huge waste. It is such an opportunity for a fresh start, I want to make best of it. I want to make my life easier and better and space better suited to my needs. What do I do to make life bearable now in this weird stage but not fall into old habits?

I'd genuinely appreciate any feedback/support - whether you have tips or not...

Her body crumples in another direction, the last echoes of nerve spasms rattling through limp arms and legs.

But the silence doesn‚Äôt last.

A wet gurgle erupts from the stump of her neck as the body suddenly lurches upright, blood spraying in violent spurts. Her severed head‚Äîlying a few feet away‚Äîjerks once, then splits grotesquely. From the base of her neck wound, pale, glistening limbs unfurl, insectoid and jointed like a spider‚Äôs. With a grotesque click-click-click, the legs lift her head off the ground, violet eyes glowing wide, silver Xs in her pupils catching the light.

The body stands without its head, staggering like a marionette with cut strings, arms reaching out as if searching for something. Meanwhile, the head skitters forward on its new legs, a nightmarish parody of her once-charming self.

And then‚Äîhead and body turn toward each other, both moving in uncanny unison, as if some unseen force still binds them.


Kokoro gently nestles her head back onto her shoulders with a sickening squelch. For a moment, she sways, then blinks rapidly, tilting her head with that same sweet smile she always wears in class. Her lips part‚Äî

But instead of words, a grotesque, stuttering noise forces its way out:

""Urrt‚Ä¶ urrt‚Ä¶ urrt‚Ä¶ urrt‚Ä¶""

Lucky Boy jolts awake, clutching his chest as if the sound had followed him out of sleep. His breath comes ragged, sweat plastering his hair to his forehead. He looks around wildly before realizing‚Äîhe‚Äôs in his bed. Just another nightmare.

He sighs, sinking back into the mattress.

‚ÄúAnother nightmare‚Ä¶ about my neighbor Kokoro,‚Äù he mutters to himself, shuddering. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs one of my closest friends‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs perfect at everything‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶‚Äù

His words trail off as he glances toward the window. Across the way, a light flicks on in Kokoro‚Äôs room. A silhouette passes by the curtains‚Äîher unmistakable twin tails.

Lucky Boy swallows hard. The unease lingers.


""You might wonder why they call me ‚ÄòLucky Boy.‚Äô""

It‚Äôs not because I win raffles or have great grades. Nope. It all started the day I transferred into a brand-new school. Nervous, late, and already lost in a maze of hallways, I bent down to grab a pencil someone had dropped‚Äîonly to trip headfirst and‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs just say my face landed in the worst possible place.

Her bottom.

That ‚Äúher‚Äù being Oshi Kokoro.

She‚Äôs smart, popular, beautiful, athletic‚Äîthe perfect girl. And me? I was just the new kid, Aki Yamaguchi. A nobody. But that accident branded me with a nickname I can‚Äôt escape: Lucky Boy.

Not the worst thing, I guess. Because my new school‚ÄîOtherside Private School‚Äîisn‚Äôt exactly normal. Located in Harajuku, founded by some eccentric foreign investors, it has a reputation for being‚Ä¶ different. And soon enough, I found out why.

Because when Kokoro smiles at me‚Ä¶ sometimes I see something behind it.

***Let‚Äôs start with Part 1 - India (The Golden Triangle Tour)***¬†

* **Day 1 - August 16 (Arriving in New Delhi)**

Arriving on a gloomy afternoon in New Delhi, I booked an Uber immediately and rushed myself to the waiting area which is easy to navigate. I reached my hotel, it‚Äôs near the Delhi Gate called goStops Hotel. After I dropped my bags, I went to¬†**Connaught Place**¬†to have my money exchanged, walk around the area, and eat dinner.

* **Day 2 - August 17 (Exploring Old and New Delhi)**

*Morning.*¬†I booked an Auto through Uber which became a mistake and a lesson throughout my India journey. On my way to Humayun Tomb, a girl on the streets aggressively begged for money and there‚Äôs a moment that she pushed my legs while I moved myself on the other side of the seat. After that, I always book an Uber anywhere I go.¬†

When I arrived at¬†**Humayun Tomb**, I started exploring the museum, the garden, and all the way to the tomb itself. There‚Äôs this security guy that I thought was just being nice to take a photo of me then lead me to the other small area to take more pictures of me, asking for money after.¬†

I prepare for the¬†**Old Delhi Walking Tour**, booked from GuruWalks. I‚Äôm the only one with my guide which became a private tour and he even suggested that I use the Delhi Metro which is really convenient.¬†

I went to a restaurant my guide recommended to me. I went back to Connaught Place to eat dinner and went to India Gate after. I have no idea what was happening at that time but there were a lot of police surrounding the area. While I was walking, the police told us to stop for about 10-20 minutes before continuing my walk towards the India Gate area.¬†

I managed to go inside by jumping on a fence, but I regret it afterwards because the police are even asking the people from inside the¬†**India Gate**¬†area to leave as well. I‚Äôm scared it might lead to a stampede so I just went outside again and went back to my room. I left my room again to have a fun night at the bar nearby.¬†

* **Day 3 - August 18 (Train from Delhi to Agra)**

I reached the¬†**New Delhi Train Station**¬†an hour before my departure time by 6 AM. I chose the Exec. Chair Car (EC) that cost 990.40 INR arriving in Agra Cantt at 7:50 AM. Once I stepped off Agra, I was literally bombarded with a lot of locals who can‚Äôt take no for an answer. I even walked 1km away from¬†**Agra Cantt**¬†and unbelievably the guy was still following me then another guy kept following me after that one guy gave up.¬†

I thought I escaped that? No. Even my Uber driver that I booked keeps on upselling himself on being my driver for the whole trip. A key takeaway is to lie, I told him I already booked everything so I don‚Äôt need any of his service or assistance.¬†¬†

I reached my hotel named Hotel Taj Resorts. It was in the Taj Mahal area so the Uber couldn't go inside at the time I supposed because when I went back to my hotel at night another Uber dropped me off in front of my hotel.¬†

The reception was kind enough to have me check-in early. I had breakfast, took a swim, and a nap for that day which is really gracious on the hotel‚Äôs behalf.

On my way to Agra Fort, I don‚Äôt know if this is another Uber scam but I waited for my driver in a pick-up spot which he accepted. Then suddenly when I reached, he said the car needs a gas fill up so he told me to cancel it and I got charged (which I reported through customer service and they refunded days after).

I went out to explore¬†**Agra Fort**¬†\- Just say no to the local guide outside.

I think you can explore the area by yourself. After Agra Fort, I met another tourist and we went to explore Agra markets as he was looking for these specific sweets and it turns out it was closed that time (Google says it's open). We had dinner in a nearby restaurant. I always use Zomato for nearby recommendations then go back to my room.

* **Day 4 - August 19 (Explore Taj Mahal - Train to Jaipur)**

*Morning*. I booked a guide through hotel reception - Which I also regret after since I don‚Äôt need a guide going to the¬†**Taj Mahal**¬†(in my opinion). We were there until 9 AM. We went back to the hotel since it‚Äôs getting hot that day.¬†

I had breakfast, prepared my stuff before leaving and catching the train to the next city. I went to a nearby coffee shop with a Taj view in the afternoon.

I booked an Uber to Agra Fort train station going to Jaipur. It was a long train ride and I booked the AC 3 Tier (3A) that cost 595.40 INR. I reached Jaipur around 9 PM. It was a great experience, the views are amazing, and the people who are with me are really friendly. There‚Äôs this one guy who is curious about my life back home. I gave him my granola bars so he can share with his children.¬†

*Night.*¬†I reached my hotel - Moustache Jaipur. I made a mistake with my booking dates but thankfully it worked out in the end by deducting the amount that I prepaid. Even though the hotel is under renovation, my stay was great. I went out to eat dinner in a rooftop bar 15 minutes away by walking.¬†

* **Day 5 - August 20 (Exploring Jaipur)**

*Morning*. I booked a¬†**Jaipur Walking Tour**¬†through GuruWalks. I was joined with the Spanish speaking tourists but the guide was kind enough to explain it to me in English afterwards. My favorite part was when we went to the sundial area and astronomical clocks.¬†

After the tour, I went back to¬†**Hawa Mahal**. There‚Äôs this guy who wanted to help and take a photo of me but I needed to buy it in his shop after. I immediately went out and headed to the Tattoo Cafe for a better view of the Hawa Mahal for lunch.¬†

*Afternoon*. I met my tourist friend (that I met in Agra) and we explored the city with a local student by visiting the Monkey Mountain by sunset.¬†

*Night*. We hike down and coincidentally it rains hard before we head to our own hotel. Afterwards, I had a final dinner with my friend (another rooftop restaurant which became a common theme in Jaipur as I noticed).¬†

* **Day 6 - August 21 (Train from Jaipur to Delhi - Fly to Hanoi)**

I head to the train station to catch my train. This was my last train ride until I realized that there‚Äôs a specific waiting area for the people based on your tickets. I was just waiting outside for the most part. I booked the First AC (1A) that cost 1355.40 INR going back to¬†**Delhi Train Station**.¬†

While I was inside the train, I was trying to book a hotel room because my flight was announced that it was delayed for 3 more hours. I got a room inside the streets near the Delhi Train Station.¬†

*Night*. I went out to have my last dinner in Delhi. Of course, in the Connaught Place area, I had a biryani. I walked around and went back to my room to prepare and go to the airport. Always be early, because the queue is so long upon entering. The airline staff also gave me a voucher of 550 INR so I spent it all on a Subway sandwich.¬†

‚Äî-

End of the India Trip summary. I would say it‚Äôs a culture shock for me and I live in a chaotic country too! My only purpose is to visit the Taj Mahal as I‚Äôm completing the new 7 wonders of the world. I love the experiences that I had and I definitely learn a lot of things for my future travels. I would say that India (Golden Triangle Tour) is not for a first time solo traveler. But maybe if you book a tour agency it will be worth all the experience.¬†

* I used an ESIM that I bought from Trip .com (10 GB Total)
* I only use cash around
* Tips are common and they will tell you to give them tips
* Metro is safe and convenient to travel around

1n6er64,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1n6er64/aita_for_not_prioritizing_our_marriage_as_much_as/,AITA For not Prioritizing Our Marriage as Much as I Should?,"I‚Äôm growing increasingly worried that my (M30) marriage with my wife (F30) is becoming numb and black and white. Maybe I‚Äôm overreacting though.

We met when we were in college. Some of the best days of my life were with her. I love her so much, and even to this very day I love her. She was spontaneous and funny, but focused and smart. She had a great body and was great in bed.

We graduated the same year and we both shared a career based aspiration over anything else. We were workaholics and we always looked, studied, and helped each other out when it came to jobs. We would work part time jobs, as we searched and eventually my then girlfriend found a full time job which changed.

I got a job soon after and we were very work oriented and promotion centered. Eventually I got a promotion and she did too. Currently I‚Äôm comfortable where I‚Äôm at and she is still striving for another position at her spot. We both have different jobs, so our career trajectory is a bit different, but we nonetheless are proud of our accomplishments.

I‚Äôd argue she‚Äôs carrying this marriage and I owe so so SO much to her and I have no idea where I would be if I didn‚Äôt sit next to her in that course level 100 class.

I am very much happy with where we are, but I feel like that spark and connection has faded away. I still love her so much and I‚Äôm so proud of her work. That focused and smart element of her is still there and is stronger than ever. That spontaneous and funny side has seemingly vanished. 

Gone are the days of nights out, pillow talks, friendly get togethers, and deep intimacy. We are both exhausted from work and want to do nothing but just kick back and relax. Watch some TV, eat dinner, maybe even do a little more work, and go to bed. On the occasion we may see a movie, eat at some local chain, or have coffee, but they just don‚Äôt feel the same. It has this obligation feeling to it that more so ‚Äústrikes off‚Äù that feeling of having fun, rather than actually having it. We don‚Äôt really have much of a sex life anymore sadly, and I just sort of feel like it‚Äôs something we ‚Äúgrew out of‚Äù.

I‚Äôd love to go out and plan or reserve some expensive dinner with her. A fancy place where I decide the week before if I should wear cologne. Maybe she‚Äôs picking out some beautiful outfit and what kind of lipstick she would wear. I would love to travel when it‚Äôs not business oriented and even go out of the country. A cruise or some destination where we meet some locals and befriend them for the day. Maybe spice up our sexual life. I‚Äôd love to just walk around naked in our place for a day, something we both fantasized about but alas, never did.

Maybe I‚Äôm saying too much, but the point is was there a point where I should have told her to slow down? Tell myself? I feel like we spent our 20s working hard that we owe each other some time together. A little ease on the brakes, but it feels too late now. Is the life I ask for something I missed? Does it come later?

There will definitely be some triggering stuff as I‚Äôm wanting to describe my anxiety. 


This is unbearable and I honestly believe that my depression is because of my anxiety. I feel INCOMPATIBLE with life. 

The racing heart, elephant on my chest, heart palpitations, constantly monitoring every little sensation in my body. Can‚Äôt feel my heart pounding out of my chest? Oh must be something wrong, gotta panic now. Heart pounding out of my chest? Oh it‚Äôll never stop and only get faster and then I‚Äôm gonna go into cardiac arrest and die. Weird sensation in my stomach? Must be my appendix rupturing and I‚Äôm gonna be too scared to go to the hospital and die. Slept on my arm weird so now it hurts? Probably arm pain caused by HEART ATTACK. I feel like my body isn‚Äôt actually mine most the time or like I‚Äôm not real. That I‚Äôll never get it to calm down. And with every panic attack I‚Äôm convinced I‚Äôm going to die. Someone rubs my skin the wrong way, I touch something weirdly textured, or my feet get dry and touch and I‚Äôm FREAKING OUT. 

It never stops. Lights are too bright, everything is too loud. People looking at me makes me extremely uncomfortable. I‚Äôm a sahm so i keep myself in the house as much as humanly possible- I‚Äôm talking I can go weeks without leaving and just have my partner take the kids out so they actually get to enjoy life. Me? My bed is my bestfriend, under the covers, watching movies, trying not to panic or dissociate. I clean and cook, play with the kids but every little moment between is me hiding away from the world. 

I rock back and forth, I‚Äôve even sucked my thumb like I did as a child, hide under my pillow, dumped ice cold water on myself, paced. I got to a point once where I was open to medication after a bad experience, got on Prozac, TERRIBLE idea, it reset my progress and made my anxiety significantly worse and my HR was at like 160 constantly. I‚Äôm too scared to try again. 

I feel extremely depressed. I can‚Äôt walk long periods of time outside without feeling like my legs are gonna give up. I don‚Äôt want to pick things up because I feel my arms are gonna give up. I don‚Äôt want to eat because I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll go into anaphylactic shock and die so I have to wait 5mins after each bite when I try new foods. Huge phobia of doctors and hospitals. I‚Äôve lost 20lbs. I only eat my safe foods. I never feel like I‚Äôve closed a door right, or flushed the toilet right, or hm did I leave the oven that I haven‚Äôt touched in days on? Gotta go check a few times. 

Extreme obsessive thoughts about every negative interaction I‚Äôve ever had. I isolate myself from other adults (or kids, except my own, really just people in general) hate going to the bathroom because I feel claustrophobic and like I can‚Äôt escape. Can‚Äôt go in a car without severe panic attacks because the same thing. I even hate the bath now which used to comfort me. 

Movies, tv shows, music, sometimes cleaning helps, ASMR, and good tea seems to help. A good nights sleep helps which I rarely get because I‚Äôm plagued by nightmares and my body jerks itself out of sleep a lot. I need any natural remedies or just any suggestions. 

I used to drink to cope, conversations were tolerable, rarely anxious, but from my severe trauma I was becoming suicidal and I have been sober for months and have no interest in picking that back up. 

I don‚Äôt drink coffee bc caffeine makes me extremely anxious but I do have a major nicotine addiction. 

Can‚Äôt smoke weed either because it‚Äôs always only ever given me panic attacks. Ugh. 

I‚Äôm exhausted all the time from constantly being on edge or panicking.

******************
Skylar
6th grade:
I‚Äôm walking into school behind my brother and Oliver, one of his best friends. They really don‚Äôt pay any
attention to me and only let me follow them to school because Mary makes them bring me. Mary is my
nanny, she has been with me as long as I can remember. My dad is the beta of the pack and really
busy, so Mary was brought on to teach me how to ‚Äòbehave like a lady,‚Äô which basically means teach me
to be silent unless spoken to and out of the way of the men. She does nothing of the sort, but my dad
doesn‚Äôt know that, as long as I make a good show when he‚Äôs around.
My brother spends most of his time with the future Alphas, Cameron and Dakota, the future Delta, Sam
and the future Gamma Oliver. They travel in a group wherever they go, they are almost worse than
some of the girls here.
Mary told him to make sure I got to and from school safely after I came home last week with a bruise
under my eye and scrapes up my arm. I tried to tell her it was an accident and that I tripped, it was not
a big deal, but she didn‚Äôt believe me. She knows I have been having trouble with kids at the school. I
live in a werewolf pack that feeds on hierarchy and dominance, of course at some point we are all
going to start trying to showcase our dominance, we‚Äôre middle schoolers.
What I have seen though is it‚Äôs more the non-ranked kids who are trying to show off for the ranked kids.
They are trying to gain status by being noticed. It‚Äôs funny to think that some kids are popular, just for
the rank they were born into, not what they have actually done. Obviously, everybody wants to be the
Alpha‚Äôs kids friends. That‚Äôs the height of all popularity. My brother, Sam and Oliver aren‚Äôt far behind
being rank born. I, however, don‚Äôt matter, even though I am the Beta‚Äôs daughter and have Beta blood. I
am the reason that my mother is dead, and that is reason enough to shun me to lower than an Omega.
That is why Mary fears for me, she has seen how kids openly treat me and no adult does a thing to
stop it, not even my father.
‚ÄúMove it fatty. You‚Äôre taking up the whole hallway and walking slower than a turtle. Are you sure you‚Äôre
a wolf?‚Äù Kaley sneers behind me. I just move to the side to try and get out of her way. She sticks her
foot between my legs and I trip sideways head first into a locker not being able to catch myself with my
armful of books.
The crash brings everyone to a halt. All eyes are on me, but the only ones I care about are my
brother‚Äôs. He turned to look at the sound and when I made eye contact he just shook his head, rolled
his eyes and turned to walk away, Oliver and Kaley following him. The rest of the kids in the hallway
disperse too, some laughing quietly, others not so quietly, but no one stops to help me up.
7th Grade:
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you ever question my authority in front of another student again!‚Äù Kaley shoulder checks me into
a door leading out to the courtyard in the middle of the school.
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt question your authority, I told you that you can‚Äôt hit kids just because they are in your way. If
you were late, that is not their fault.‚Äù I shouldn‚Äôt snap back at her, it only fuels her fire, but she‚Äôs starting
to get on my nerves. She was late because she skipped second period to go get coffee with her friends
and was late getting back to third period, who happens to be a teacher that will report her to her father.
Although nothing ever seems to happen when she is reported.
I right myself, set my focus down the hallway and move to walk away from the door that was holding
me up, but before I can get two steps, Marnie, one of Kaley‚Äôs little minions steps out to trip me, then
proceeds to dump her iced latte on my head. I hear cackles of laughter then others join in, meaning we
attracted a crowd.
I look up to see my brother and his friends joining in with the laughter. ‚ÄúMaybe if you trained a little
harder and lost some of that baby fat, you wouldn‚Äôt be so clumsy.‚Äù Kaley says not-so quietly to me then,
‚ÄúHey boys, are we up for hanging out at the fire pit tonight?‚Äù To my brother and his friends.",1,1756804281.0,novelsfree,1,1.0,False
1n6embo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Aalborg/comments/1n6embo/fun_activities_for_couples/,Fun activities for couples,"Hej,

I am an Australian going to move to Denmark soon for work at Aalborg University with my partner. I was wondering if there was some 'hidden gems' that only the locals know that I can surprise my partner with. We are both ~30 years old, active lifestyle, we love bushdoofs (aussie term for camping festivals), and spontaneous adventures.

I used to live in Denmark as a kid for 4 years in √Öarhus. So I have a few 'tricks' up my sleeve. I was thinking taking a trip to Legoland or Djurs sommerland, taking her to sneglehuset, museums/tributes for hans christian andersen. I basically want her to naturally fall in love with Danish culture, food, language, and people just like I did in my childhood. We will both be taking danish lessons the moment we arrive to assimilate as quickly as we can.

If anyone has any recommendations for good coffee, cocktails, nurseries or farms (look at flowers), festivals, or adventure ideas I would love to hear them. This will be her first time travelling to Europe, so she is hella excited.

Testing out the C.O. Bigelow Mentha Shimmer Bare Mint 1648 lip gloss has been a real treat. I wasn‚Äôt expecting much from a gloss initially, but this product surprised me with its sheen, refreshing taste, and how it has integrated itself into my daily routine. Let me walk you through my impressions of using this sweet little gem every day and why it might be worth a spot in your makeup bag.

**Design and Packaging That‚Äôs Both Sleek and Practical**

What caught my attention right away is how compact and functional the tube is. It comes in a practical 0.5 oz size that slides effortlessly into the smallest of purses or even tight car compartments. The applicator works smoothly without creating a sticky mess, which is a win on chaotic mornings when I‚Äôm slathering it on at stoplights. No product waste, no leaking‚Äîjust sturdy packaging. Minor gripe? The shimmer lettering on the tube looks chic but tends to wear off over time, which slightly dulls its aesthetic charm.

**Consistency and Formula: A Perfect Balance**

The formula stands out for its lightweight texture. It‚Äôs not overly sticky like many cheaper glosses or overly watery either. The blend gives a natural shimmer that feels fancy without overdoing it. I particularly enjoy how the peppermint infusion adds a slight cooling tingle that perks me up even before my first coffee of the day. And who doesn‚Äôt love that 100% natural mint added to their gloss? If hydration and shine teamed up, this would be the result.

**Advantages**

- Super lightweight texture that feels non-sticky but glossy.  
- Peppermint adds a cool, tingly sensation, making it refreshing to use.  
- Natural shimmer gives a subtle, polished look great for work or casual outings.  
- Conveniently packaged for on-the-go use.

**Pigmentation and Shine Level: Where It Stands Out**

Mentha Shimmer Bare Mint doesn‚Äôt promise bold lip color, which works in its favor for everyday wear. Its shimmer tint adds a flattering sheen that suits most skin tones without overpowering. On a recent evening out, I dabbed it over a deeper lipstick, and the combination made my lips look plumper and more vibrant. It gave my lips just the right amount of shine in those ‚Äúwe-dimmed-the-restaurant-lights-too-much‚Äù moments.

**Target User: Who Will Appreciate It Most?**

This gloss feels tailored for anyone who veers towards simplicity or subtle elegance in their makeup routine. Whether you‚Äôre a lip balm loyalist looking to dabble in gloss or a seasoned beauty enthusiast who loves a topper to finish your lipstick looks, this product carves a space on both ends of the spectrum. My teenage niece loves it because it‚Äôs less dramatic but fun, while my coworker loves its menthol twist during mid-shift touch-ups.

**Negatives**

- Durability isn‚Äôt excellent‚Äîit needs frequent reapplications.  
- Minor shimmer particles may settle after a while, which isn‚Äôt ideal for longer events.  

**Competing Products**

Comparing this product to other peppermint-infused glosses, the C.O. Bigelow version earns extra points for its clean, refreshing taste and tingly peppermint inclusion thanks to the 2% peppermint oil formula. e.l.f. Lip Lacquer Gloss is a cheaper competitor but lacks the menthol freshness and natural formula. On the higher-end spectrum, Fenty‚Äôs Gloss Bomb Universal Lip Luminizer offers more luxurious pigmentation and longer wear, but for the price difference, it might not be worth sacrificing the natural minty freshness for some buyers.  

**Quality for Price**

This isn‚Äôt the priciest lip gloss out there nor the cheapest, and honestly, I find it worth the price. The balance of natural ingredients, standout shimmer, and peppermint oil feels like the product delivers a niche yet easily justifiable luxury for the cost. It‚Äôs a reasonable pick if you‚Äôre tired of budget drugstore glosses that underdeliver without blowing bank-breaking amounts on prestige brands. For me, its affordability blended with comfort makes it a steal.

1n6el5a,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_No_Fee_8997/comments/1n6el5a/maximizing_nutrition_in_hot_beverages_through/,Maximizing nutrition in hot beverages through higher temperature preparation?,"
When brewing various types of coffees and teas, experts often emphasize that you shouldn't use boiling temperatures, because they say that this ruins it. They say it is imperative to avoid boiling it. What they mean by this seems to be that it becomes bitter, that it ruins the taste if the water is too hot (over 195¬∞-205¬∞F for coffees). 

But that bitterness is largely due to polyphenols, which are one of the healthiest components of coffee. The same probably applies to a variety of different teas.

So, wouldn't it be better just to boil them, over their objections, from a nutrition standpoint? 

The bitterness can be counteracted in various ways, so why not do it that way?

Plus, I just saw some data about how much more caffeine gets extracted when you boil the coffee. It's more than doubled. Something similar probably extends to polyphenols, chlorogenic acid, and a variety of other the 1000+ compounds found in coffee beans, plus a variety of teas, including yerba mate. So why not utilize them ‚Äî use what you've got right in front of you ‚Äî and get the nutritional benefits?

There are other aspects to this as well ‚Äî like minimizing waste and getting the most bang for your buck.

1n6ejea,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1n6ejea/explore_if_aqua_crest_inline_water_filter/,Explore if AQUA CREST Inline Water Filter Delivers Quality Performance Review for Your Refrigerator,"**Reliable Performance and Long Lifespan**  
I‚Äôve been using the Aqua Crest AQF-INL Inline Water Filter for a while now, and what stands out most to me is its longevity. This inline water filter boasts an impressive service life of up to 5 years or 5,000 gallons, which is a huge plus for anyone tired of frequently replacing filters. Personally, I‚Äôve found this to be especially helpful in my refrigerator‚Äôs water line. It‚Äôs comforting to know that for approximately $0.01 a day, I can enjoy filtered water without constant maintenance interruptions. However, it is important to remember that the lifespan can vary depending on your local water quality. As someone who lives in a city with fairly chlorinated water, I appreciated how effectively this filter reduces both chlorine and odors, leaving my water tasting fresh.  

**Ease of Installation Surprised Me**  
One thing I value in any home improvement product is how easy it is to set up, and this filter really delivers on that front. Thanks to its 1/4-inch compression fittings and push-to-connect design, I was able to install it within a matter of minutes without needing to call a plumber or spend ages fiddling with tools. The connections felt secure, and I even tested it with copper tubing in another setup to see how versatile it truly is. Both plastic and copper installations were a breeze. Just make sure you insert the PE tubing into the cartridge deep enough‚Äî20mm as per the instructions‚Äîto avoid leaks. I didn‚Äôt have a single drop escape, which definitely earned points in my book.

**Good Points**  
- Five-year lifespan means you replace it less frequently for lower overall costs.  
- Installs super easily with push-to-connect fittings, great for DIYers.  
- Effective in reducing chlorine, odors, and PFAS, improving overall water taste.

**Filtration Efficiency That Delivers What It Promises**  
The filtration performance of this device deserves some praise. It employs a 0.5-micron coconut shell activated carbon block, along with a fine polyester membrane, which together effectively reduce PFAS, PFOA/PFOS, chlorine, rust, and suspended solids. My water now not only tastes better but also has a noticeably cleaner appearance. If you‚Äôre one of those people who use a refrigerator water dispenser or ice maker regularly, you‚Äôll notice how much of a difference clearer water makes. And for those concerned about material safety, this filter is both BPA-free and lead-free, which gives me peace of mind when serving water to my kids. However, it‚Äôs worth noting, this system won‚Äôt reduce Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), so if TDS reduction is a priority for you, this filter might not meet your expectations.  

**Potential Areas of Improvement**  
- Doesn‚Äôt reduce Total Dissolved Solids, which some users might expect.  
- While it fits most refrigerators, compatibility isn‚Äôt universal, so double-check your model.  
- Service life could vary significantly based on local water conditions, which is worth keeping an eye on.  

**Compact and Durable Design Fits Nicely**  
This inline water filter measures 3.38‚Äù in diameter and 10.78‚Äù in height, a design compact enough to blend seamlessly into refrigerator setups or other water lines like RVs and campers. The lightweight 0.9-pound build made it easy to handle and even reposition as needed. One of my friends actually installed theirs in their coffee maker line and raved about how unexpectedly versatile this product is. I wouldn‚Äôt have thought about that initially, but hearing their experience encouraged me to try it in some non-conventional setups! Though the design is solid, I did find that if you are working in tight spaces, the fittings might need some extra attention to ensure all connections are angled properly.  

**Competing Products**  
When comparing the Aqua Crest AQF-INL to competing products like the PureWater Filters Inline Kit or Culligan IC-EZ-1, some clear advantages emerged. The Aqua Crest‚Äôs five-year lifespan easily eclipses the typical six-month to two-year range of many alternatives. On the other hand, Culligan does offer NSF certification for taste and odor reduction, which is a bonus for those who prioritize verified performance. However, I found the installation process for Aqua Crest to be far simpler than PureWater, whose kit involved additional tools that felt unnecessarily challenging for a DIY-friendly product. Ultimately, the Aqua Crest hits a sweet spot for those who want a balance of longevity, ease of use, and effective filtration without blowing their budget.  

**Value for Money**  
As someone who has tried various water filters in the past, I was skeptical at first about whether this would justify its slightly above-average price tag. Let me just say‚Äîit absolutely does. While the initial investment may feel a touch higher than some other filters, the long lifespan, and reduced maintenance needs quickly make up for it. Instead of replacing filters multiple times a year, using this one for five years could amount to significant savings. The durability and hassle-free operation make it worth every penny in my experience. If you‚Äôre like me and prefer smart spending over short-term solutions, this is a solid pick.

Room is 12 x 15 ft. Sofa is a 72 inch charcoal fabric. The table is round solid wood with faceted sides, 31 inch diameter and 18 inch height. Finish right now is black and has these grooves in it (you can zooom to see).

Does the black finish give good contrast against the floor and sofa or does it just blend in too much?Would a lighter walnut version (same as ground) feel more balanced?.. Curious how you‚Äôd read the contrast in this setup. If this were your room, keep it as is or go lighter?

sea salt caramel

the coffee is not too strong and the sea salt is so creamy but not overly salty. i can drink it in one go but i hold myself back all the time. first caramel latte that suits my taste!

sea salt caramel 

third pic:
matcha latte (rin) 4.5/5 - very nutty and the smell is good! the matcha is strong and thick.. I think they use double matcha? they use fresh milk too.
IDR60k

matcha mochi cheese cake 1/5 - i don‚Äôt like it at all, just not my taste but it was on discounted price and i was with a friend, so we tried it 
(around 45k i guess?) it felt powdery and the matcha is strong so it tastes bitter. mochi just kinda there.. not adding anything but sticky taste.

the cafe ambience is 5/5 and their baristas are really friendly especially if you sit at the bar. 

mind you, they are always busy but not too busy so most of the time I always got a seat, even when I went there during lunch break. the place is not too big though but I think you can sit outside. Little Cokro has a lot of seats available as a foodcourt.

can‚Äôt wait to try other coffee from them! i really can‚Äôt move on from the sea salt caramel ‚ù§Ô∏è",4,1756803390.0,kulineria,1,1.0,False

We also plan to have another kid quite soon (if possible) because we want them to have a short-ish age difference so then I won't be able to use meds due to the pregnancy.

Caffeine, however, has been studied more and is proven to be safe (in small amounts) both during breastfeeding and pregnancy. Caffeine definitely helps me to some degree but I am worried about developing tolerance/getting addicted if I use it too regularly. Currently just 50mg is beneficial to me and I would like to keep it that way.

Is there anyone here self-medicating with coffee who has managed to avoid developing a tolerance or do y'all chug insane amounts?

‚∏ª

üó£Ô∏è Language
If you want any real chance of surviving and actually understanding the culture, you have to know the language. Amharic is tough, no doubt, but that‚Äôs also what makes Ethiopia great‚Äîthe barrier to fit in is high.

üç¥ Food
Pretty much anywhere you go, the food is good. That said, depending on what you‚Äôre used to, it might send you to the bathroom quickly.

üõéÔ∏è Customer Service
Not going to sugarcoat it, it sucks. In a restaurant, it might take 10 minutes before anyone greets you or gives you a menu. It‚Äôs nothing like American service where things move fast. I think the reason is that eating here is more about sitting together, talking, and enjoying the time, not rushing.

‚òï Coffee
You can‚Äôt talk about Ethiopia without mentioning coffee. The buna is solid everywhere I tried, and honestly, most of it tasted about the same. Not something I‚Äôd drink every single day, but definitely enjoyable.

üõ°Ô∏è Safety
For context, I‚Äôm a 6‚Äô4‚Äù, 200lb American Black man, so maybe I‚Äôm not the first candidate to get robbed. I walked around alone at night, but not the same way I would in the U.S.‚Äîno headphones, no flashing valuables. I kept my stuff in pockets with zippers or buttons.

üíò Dating
I‚Äôm 33, so I‚Äôm looking for something more serious than the younger crowd might be. I can say there are plenty of women in the city who are not only beautiful but also nice, kind, and genuinely interested in marriage. I know people say Habesha women only want Habesha men, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true across the board. If you‚Äôre a decent guy and you learn the language, you‚Äôll have no problem meeting someone serious. Personally, I‚Äôm already preparing myself for the day I have to meet a Habesha mom and win her over.

üöñ Taxis
If you use the ride apps, most trips are between $1‚Äì$3 USD. Don‚Äôt just hop in a cab‚Äîalways verify the license plate and make sure the driver starts the meter.

üè† Cost of Living
I looked at a few apartments and wasn‚Äôt super impressed with what I saw. For my next trip (planning around three months), I‚Äôll probably just live in a hotel instead of signing for an apartment.

‚∏ª

I have been making coffee at home for a year with a basic ¬±100‚Ç¨ machine and would like to take a leap in quality.

I have searched a lot and I think I have come to the conclusion with 3 machines: ""Sage bambino Plus"", Gaggia Classic Pro"" or ""Rancilio Silvia"".

I love the Gaggia aesthetically but I keep reading that you have to make modifications or it is not worth it no matter how good it is and I think I'm not in those yet.

With the Rancilio I have the feeling that it's too good for me, but I really want to be told if it's worth it and I'll take the challenge!

And finally, La Bambino, nobody speaks bad about it but it is not cheap either so if the others are a better option I would like to know and since I am buying a good machine I will face the economic difference.

1n6eap1,https://i.redd.it/j4mr8cc7tpmf1.jpeg,BORACAY ITINERARY: EXPECTATION VS. REALITY (Solo Travel),"TLDR: My Boracay trip didn't go as planned because I fell in love with Station 1.

LONG POST AHEAD: Boracay Itinerary + Tips (???)

Around April this year, I went to Boracay to unwind. It was my first solo trip out of Luzon and first time riding a plane alone, too. Aside from the fact that I am an organized person, it was my first solo travel nga so made sure that my itinerary is well-planned kasi mahirap nang mangapa sa pupuntahan at kakainan, alam n'yo na 'yon.

Anyway, the island is small lang naman so I made sure to include all stations on my itinerary. Kaso hindi ko siya nasunod looooool. I really fell in love with Station 1. Doon lang ako every morning. Ang sarap tumambay. As in. Literal na breathe of fresh air!

Many of redditors are asking the updated itinerary from me. Sorry to disappoint you pero I stayed in Station 1 and mas reliable pa rin na sundin 'yong naunang itinerary that I created.

Btw, I'll share my tips, experience, and suggestions:
1. STAY IN STATION 1. Sobrang ganda ng view mo, napakapino ng lupa at kaunti lang ang tao. And in my case when I went there, close to none and lumot compared to Station 2. Idk about Station 3 ‚Äî never got a chance to go there. 
2. Huwag maniniwala na 100 pesos per cup ang taho. Sabi sa akin ng lokal doon, mura lang daw 'yon. I get it, doon sila kumikita sa mga tourists so idk. Buy at your own risk, if kaya mong bumili ng overpriced taho because you have ""I'm on vacation"" kind of reasoning. Haha!
3. Coco Mama is sakto lang. MANGO MAMA IS WAAAAH. Sobrang sarap n'ya for me. Sobrang bumagay 'yong mango, kakanin, latik, and ice cream sa isa't isa. I'm definitely gonna buy Mango Mama again when I go back. ü•π On the other hand, ang ironic lang kasi I love purple, however, I wasn't able to taste Ube Mama (tho based on the reviews, sobrang tamis daw.)
4. Don't go to Boracay without tasting Kolai Mangyan. If you can see, twice akong naglunch doon. Super sarap kasi. And also, very affordable. Can you imagine? Around 100 to 150 lang ang dish tapos GIRL BEACHFRONT PA. Saan ka pa? Try it lol.
5. Sabi nila, Jonah's fruitshake isn't masarap daw. Pero I loved their Chocolate banana and peanut butter fruitshake. Sakto lang ang tamis for me. Doon ako tumambay while watching the sunset. So perfect!
6. Sakto lang lasa ng food sa Aplaya. Hindi na ako uulit.
7. Masarap ang food sa Aria, medyo pricey nga lang. Super helpful pa ng mga staff. 
8. Don't forget the Hanoi Pho. Ang laki ng serving ng pho nila, good for two pax. Also, their spring rolls. Gosh, ang laki girl. Imagine, solo lang ako, pero pinilit ko ubusin. Cheat day malala talaga. Mas maganda talaga may kasama ka sa mga food trip kasi nga wala kang choice kundi ubusin. Isa sa mga downside when you're alone, solo mo lahat ng food at gastos. Hahaha!
9. ICE FLAKES in D'Mall, babalikan ko rin. It literally melts in your mouth. I tried the common flavor, pagbalik ko magtry pa ako ng ibang offer nila. 
10. Kung magstay lang naman kayo sa Station 1, 2 & 3, huwag na kayong magHOHO card. I originally planned to use it kasi if you'll check the routes na dinadaanan ng HOHO bus, talagang maraming madadaanan. Ayon nga lang, I wasn't able to use it kasi gorl, ang tagal ng waiting time, ang init pa. So magconvenience pa ring mag-eTrike tapos 15 pesos lang pamasahe. Sa buong stay ko in Boracay, wala pang 500 pesos ginastos ko sa pamasahe because mostly lakad lang ginagawa ko then mura nga kasi.
11. MEZE WRAP ISN'T A FILIPINO RESTAURANT. Gorl, naloka ako. They offer Mediterranean cuisine pala. AKALA KO KAYA MEZE WRAP KASI KAARTEHAN FOR ""MASARAP."" Jusko, nakakaloka. Hahahaha. Well, it's my fault, hindi ko rin alam bakit this is the only restau na hindi ko sinearch ang menu. Lmao. As an introvert, nahiya na akong umalis kasi nakaupo na ako, eh. So I just gave that chicken kebab a chance kaso hindi talaga, hindi ko bet lasa. üò£ I don't hate it, hindi ko lang talaga prefer, don't bash me.
12. Magpa-Swedish and foot massage kayo. Super worth it. And ang mura lang sa nahanap ko, Malipay Spa? Since puro lakad nga ako, ayon. Hahahaha!
13. Recommended ko and airport and hotel transfers via Southwest Tours kapag solo lang kase nagcompute ako, halos ganoon din naman magagastos ko kapag nagtricycle ako and all that. At least, pagdating ko ng airport may mag-aassist na sa akin papunta ng hotel. Same goes kapag pabalik ng airport. 4am ako sinundo ng van so imagine kung hindi ako nag-avail, edi nahirapan pa ako humanap ng maghahatid sa akin sa Jetty Port. Haha! Ayoko lang ng hassle transpo, that's it.
14. Never again sa My Crepes. Idk sorry hindi ko lang talaga bet. Ang bigat sa tiyan tapos hindi ko talaga masiyadong bet overall, well, at least na-try ko.

If curious kayo magkano nagastos ko naka-25kish ako kasama na lahat lahat‚Äîairfare, hostel, pamasahe back & forth, airport transfers RT, food, alak, pasalubong, shopping before travel, maleta, etc. 

Kaya lang naman din malaki nagastos ko kasi hindi ko nirestrict sarili ko sa mga food na gusto kong bilhin & matikman. Kasi nga it's my first time. Saka solo ko lahat ng gastos dahil mag-isa lang naman ako. I'll definitely go back to Boracay and the next time that I go there, alam ko na kung anong pagkain ang mga babalikan ko. 

At first, I didn't get the hype kung bakit maraming may love sa Boracay. I thought I'm not gonna enjoy it kasi maraming tao. But lo and behold, hindi mo ramdam ang dami ng tao kasi wala naman silang pake sa'yo. Lahat kayo doon may kanya-kanyang agenda and plano so hindi mo alintana ang dami ng tao. Sobrang ganda ng Boracay. Sobrang lapit sa lahat, may beach, may bar, and different restaurants depending on your mood. Higit sa lahat, super WALKABLE. 

Idk maybe boring para sa iba ang itinerary ko pero that's how I function as an introvert, hindi ko prefer mag-activities. Hahaha.

I'm trying to move on but I still think about her a lot.","I'll try keep this to the point and brief as much as I can.
Basically I would describe myself as a very genuine person when it comes to dating. I'm trying to find a partner with a genuine connection. I've been single for about 2 yrs and about 2 months ago I got some girl's number at a singles event.
We went out for coffee and we got on great but she initially said she was looking for something specific and wasn't sure there was a strong enough connection. I was very respectful of this and said I'd genuinely like to keep getting to know her. After this we kept talking and then we subsequently had 3 more dates. A lunch, dinner at my place and then dessert and chilling at her place in the evening.
We shared some kissing on date 3 and 4 and I genuinely thought things were slowly coming along nicely. Then 2 days after the last date she msged me while I was at work and basically said she thought I was a lovely guy but she just wasn't quite feeling the romantic connection.

I was absolutely devastated to say the least. She' the most beautiful, amazing girl I've ever had the pleasure of spending time with and honestly getting turned down like that a 2nd time really hurt me emotionally. 

I realise we weren't even in a relationship yet but I wasn't in denial about anything, we talked and got on really well together, we had a love of some things and then differences in others, I genuinely feel like there was some connection there...and I've always thought it was more than ""not feeling a romantic connection""

I subsequent made a mistake of sending her a few emotional msgs that wkd of the rejection which I felt like a total dick about afterwards and I apologized for, nothing rude just upset and looking for answers, and she told me she had spent a lot of time working on herself to figure out what her values are and what she needs. I dunno if I'm reading too much into this but my gut feel is she did really like me but I perhaps wasn't checking off a couple of things on her checklist possibly?

Anyway she said she was happy to be friends but I think she realises perhaps that isn't possible with how much I like her. I haven't had any contact with her for about 6 wks except for wishing her happy birthday which she appreciated but I still think about her heaps.

I've been dealing with it the best way I can. Been doing heaps of exercise, continuing to go to other singles events and seek other opportunities and I have left her in peace but I still think about her a lot. I can't help thinking that we could've been a great match and I can relate to some people who express being dropped after a short amount of time when it seems unwarranted.

I guess I'm looking for guidance and opinions going fwd. I'd love to casually msg her to see how she is? Is this a bad idea? I've been told by I lot of close family and friends that I didn't do a thing wrong, I treated her amazingly well and it's her loss so as hard as it is should I just honor that?

For a little bit more context. She's a lawyer and seemed like the world's busiest woman when we were seeing each other. The last time we met. I went to her place, made her a chocolate mousse and got her some flowers. I did this purely because I wanted to do something really nice for her and she's been working super hard. She led me to believe this was too much...

https://preview.redd.it/43ff37d3spmf1.jpg?width=1472&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6bb457b2c1235ad40bfc016416928360da816045

A kitchen island is no longer just a functional centerpiece; it's the heart of the modern home, a versatile hub for cooking, dining, and socializing. The evolution of kitchen island design reflects a shift towards more open-plan living, where the kitchen seamlessly integrates with the living and dining areas.

**Beyond the Basics: Functionality and Form**

Modern kitchen islands are designed to be multi-functional. While many still feature a sink or a cooktop, they also incorporate smart storage solutions like pull-out shelves, hidden drawers, and built-in wine racks. The trend is moving towards islands with varying heights, creating distinct zones for food preparation and casual dining. For instance, a raised bar area with stools provides a perfect spot for quick meals or a morning coffee, while a lower, main surface is ideal for chopping vegetables or kneading dough.

**Materials and Textures: A Feast for the Eyes**

The choice of materials is crucial in defining the character of the kitchen island. While classic granite and marble remain popular for their durability and timeless elegance, new materials are making a big splash. Reclaimed wood adds a rustic, warm feel, while concrete countertops offer a sleek, industrial aesthetic. For a more luxurious look, homeowners are opting for waterfall edges, where the countertop material extends all the way to the floor, creating a seamless and dramatic effect. Incorporating different textures, such as a smooth countertop paired with a ribbed wood base, adds visual interest and depth.

**Lighting and Integration: Setting the Mood**

Proper lighting is essential for both functionality and ambiance. Pendant lights hanging above the island can serve as a stunning focal point, while under-counter LED strips can create a soft, inviting glow. The key is to layer lighting to suit different tasks and moods. Smart home integration is also becoming a standard feature. Islands can be equipped with built-in charging stations for devices, pop-up power outlets, and even integrated speakers, making the space more convenient and connected.

**The Social Hub: Creating Connections**

Ultimately, the most significant role of a modern kitchen island is its ability to foster social interaction. By facing the island towards the living area, the person cooking can be a part of the conversation, rather than being isolated. The island becomes a natural gathering point during parties, a place where guests can mingle and enjoy a drink while watching the host at work. It's a testament to how kitchen design has evolved from a purely utilitarian space to a central, social hub where memories are made. By thoughtfully considering the design, materials, and features, a kitchen island can be transformed into a beautiful and highly functional asset that truly becomes the heart of the home.",1,1756802754.0,interiordesignideas,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone! Just wanted to share my experience so far, still pretty new to this but already seeing some promising results.

I'm 50, about 1.78m, and honestly I've struggled with weight my entire adult life. Started playing tennis in my mid-40s which helped a bit, but the last couple years were brutal - lost both my parents and definitely ate my way through the grief. My weight just got stuck despite staying active with tennis, which was incredibly frustrating.

A few weeks back I hit this wall where I was like ""okay, traditional dieting clearly isn't working for me"" and I was genuinely feeling pretty defeated. That's when I found this community and started seeing all the transformation photos **some of you** have posted. I mean, these before/after shots are just incredible - **you guys** look completely different!

It felt like maybe this could actually work for me when nothing else had.

Started at 111kg (245 lbs), sitting at 106kg (234 lbs) now. Took me a while to figure out that I couldn't just fast and then eat whatever I wanted during my window - calories still matter, go figure!

My routine has settled into starting my eating window around 2-3 PM and eating until I'm naturally hungry the next morning, which usually works out to 16-18 hours of fasting. What's surprised me most is the mental clarity during fasts and how different actual hunger feels compared to what I thought it was before. I really only get properly hungry right at the end of my fasting window, not constantly like I expected.

**Black coffee** in the mornings has been my lifesaver - takes the edge off that initial hunger without breaking the fast.

Oh, and I was tracking everything with some little tool I threw together since I'm too cheap for subscription apps haha.

Just got back from vacation where I completely abandoned fasting for almost two weeks but walked everywhere (easily 10k+ steps daily, plus tennis). Expected to come back much heavier but only gained a pound! Actually gives me hope that maybe my metabolism is starting to work with me instead of against me.

Goal is to get under 100kg (220 lbs) by New Year's. Feels ambitious but doable if I stick with this.

Professional teeth whitening performed by a qualified [**Dentist in Pune**](https://g.co/kgs/nAcnFkV) remains the gold standard. Unlike over-the-counter products, dentists use higher concentrations of whitening agents that deliver immediate and safe results.

* Performed under expert supervision.
* Provides long-lasting results (up to a year or more with proper care).
* Reduces risks of gum irritation and enamel damage.

# 2. Laser Teeth Whitening

This advanced technique uses a bleaching gel activated by laser light. Patients in Pune, especially professionals and young adults, prefer this method for its speed and effectiveness.

* Visible results within a single session.
* Minimal discomfort.
* Safe for sensitive teeth when done by an experienced professional.

# 3. Custom Take-Home Whitening Kits

While DIY kits are widely available, dentists recommend custom trays made in the clinic. These are molded to fit the patient‚Äôs teeth perfectly, ensuring even whitening and reduced sensitivity.

* Convenient for at-home use.
* Gradual, natural-looking results.
* Monitored by a [**Dentist in PCMC**](https://g.co/kgs/nAcnFkV) to prevent misuse.

# 4. Whitening Toothpastes and Strips

Although not as powerful as professional treatments, whitening toothpastes and strips continue to trend for their affordability and accessibility. They work best as maintenance options after a professional whitening session.

# 5. Natural and Lifestyle-Based Whitening Approaches

Some patients prefer reducing stains through dietary changes and natural remedies like oil pulling or activated charcoal. While these methods are less effective than clinical options, they reflect the growing awareness of holistic oral care.

# What Dentists Recommend for Safe Whitening

While trends are exciting, dentists emphasize the importance of safety. Here‚Äôs what top dental experts in Pune suggest:

* **Always get an oral check-up first**: Whitening should only be done on healthy teeth and gums.
* **Avoid over-the-counter misuse**: Excessive use of whitening products can damage enamel.
* **Choose professional supervision**: A dentist ensures the right concentration, application time, and aftercare.
* **Maintenance is key**: Limiting stain-causing foods, quitting smoking, and regular cleanings prolong whitening results.
* **Personalized approach**: Not everyone needs the same treatment‚Äîdentists recommend tailored solutions based on tooth sensitivity, lifestyle, and shade goals.

# The Role of Cosmetic Dentistry in Confidence Building

Teeth whitening is often the first step in a patient‚Äôs cosmetic dentistry journey. A brighter smile boosts confidence, whether for job interviews, weddings, or daily interactions. Many patients combine whitening with treatments like veneers, dental implants, and smile design for a complete transformation.

1n6e2yy,https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1n6e2yy/between_door_4_and_44_in_the_spiritual_hallway/,Between Door #4 and #44 in the Spiritual Hallway,"This article is for ‚Äòspiritual‚Äô people who fall somewhere between religious and atheistic.

If that‚Äôs you, imagine walking down a long hallway lined with identical doors on both sides. Each door has a sign:

Astrology & horoscopes; Numerology; Shamanism; Spiritism; Mysticism; Kabballah; Gnosticism; Magnetism; Hypnotism; Autogenic training; the Symbolon Tarot Deck; Yoga; Kundalini; Ayurveda; Reiki; Clairvoyance; Animal & plant spirits; Meditation (general); Vipassana; Zen & zazen; Tai Chi; Chi Gong; I Ching; Alchemy; Black magic & occult; Satanism; Wicca & witchcraft; Ghosts; Astral bodies; Aura-vibration-energy reading.

You keep walking..

Chakra alignment; Coffee grounds, crystal, and palm interpreting; Anthroposophy & Rudolf Steiner; Biodynamic farming; Aleister Crowley; Osho; Krishnamurti; Carl Jung; Deepak Chopra; Russell Brandt; Eckhart Tolle; The Secret; Dale Carnegie; Self-help (assorted); Alternative medicine (general); Kinesiology; Prana & breatharianism; Tantra; Dream analysis; Chanting mantras; Candle alignment; Psychedelics (general); Ayahuasca; Mescaline; Psylocibin; Alchemy; UFO; Paganism, goblins, elves, and fairies.

Which door will you open?

Let‚Äôs say, #5, Tai Chi. You enter a bright, modestly furnished room with calligraphy paintings on the walls, lacquered parquet floors, a kung-fu sword in the corner, and cherry blossoms in a vase. The teacher bows down, hands you a cup of ginseng, and explains the breathing rhythm while demonstrating basic postures. You start practicing, joining other students, reading books and watching videos. Three months later, you can follow a few sequences and hold ten postures smoothly, keeping the breath rhythm.

Or let‚Äôs say that you open door #19, Vipassana. Entering a sparsely furnished, silent room, you see the backs of people sitting in lotus position. Without making a sound, the teacher points to a note on the wall with a daily meditation schedule and a spare mat to sit on. You try Anapana, a necessary pre-requisite for Vipassana, but, after two hours of monkey mind and aching legs, you book a ten-day silent retreat, which is the proper way to learn Vipassana.

Or, how about door #31, Rudolf Steiner? You enter an Expressionist-Brutalist room with a high ceiling and heavy, purple draperies, full of bookshelves and Lazure paintings. After chatting with a few enthusiasts over coffee and biscuits, you scan the bookshelf for Steiner‚Äôs¬†*Philosophy of Freedom,*¬†which¬†sits between¬†*Man and Woman in Light of Spiritual Science*¬†and¬†*Metamorphoses of the Soul II.*¬†Then, a bell announces the lecture titled¬†*The Relationship between Anthroposophy and the Natural Sciences.*¬†Sitting through the lecture, taking notes, you get overwhelmed by and lost in the terminology of Steinerverse. Your rookie question during the Q&A raises a few eyebrows among participants, most of whom are steeped in the teaching. You'd better start reading.

Of course, your chosen door could have been #11 Reiki, #27 Kundalini, #19 Kabballah, #35 Deepak Chopra, #7 crystals, or a combination of two, even three practices, waiting behind the doors.

The spiritual hallway is endless, but your time and energy aren‚Äôt, so, after a few years of trying and testing, you either land on one or two practices that resonate, possibly sticking to it ‚Ä¶ or you don‚Äôt, remaining in the hallway more than in any one room, whilst peeping in and grabbing door handles, but not entering.

The individual‚Äôs role in a spiritual hallway differs from the role of a religious person:

¬∑ In the¬†**spiritual hallway mode**, everything starts and stops with the individual, the primary mover. He‚Äôs the one choosing the door #4, #14, or #44, and the hallway is his default position, from which he starts and returns. The choice of practice (e.g. Tai Chi), length of stay, depth of engagement, level of commitment and consistency are all¬†*downstream*¬†from the individual.

¬∑ In the¬†**religious house mode**, the individual is secondary. He‚Äôs, after all, in a¬†*house of worship*, not a hallway with 50 doors. And the standalone house (church, mosque, synagogue..) has a single door with a sign (Catholic, Muslim, Jewish..). The house of worship is primary,¬†*upstream*¬†from the individual, a place from which he starts and returns.

Put differently, in the spiritual hallway mode, the individual resembles the sun, around which planets orbit. The arrangement of ‚Äòplanets‚Äô (spiritual practices), including their weight, size, magnetic pull, colour, shape and proximity to the ‚Äòsun‚Äô (the individual) is fully parametrized by him. By contrast, in the religious house mode, the sun resembles God (deity, the sacred..) and the individual the orbiting planet.

Now, your objection to such a distinction might be:

===

‚ÄúBS! The distinction is false because I decide to¬†*make*¬†the ‚Äòhouse‚Äô or ‚Äòsun‚Äô out of Tai Chi, Vipassana, or Reiki, the same way a religious person treats his house of worship. What I¬†*make*¬†of, and get out of, any practice, spiritual or religious, is up to me. There are degrees of orthodoxy in all practices, but I decide where to take mine. Having been practicing Tai Chi daily for 30 years, and now mastering calligraphy, I‚Äôm way more rigorous than my lapsed Catholic neighbour who barely goes to mass.‚Äù

===

Sure, I can‚Äôt argue with your unique practice.

But I‚Äôm not making a particular-personal argument but a general-sociological one, in which my distinction holds, for the following reasons:

¬∑ First, religion comes pre-loaded culturally, and is therefore easier to absorb and stick to than, say, Vipassana or Ayurveda (for a Westerner) because it‚Äôs the ‚Äòwater‚Äô in which the ‚Äòfish‚Äô swims.\* This water is, naturally, Islam for a Moroccan-Saudi-Pakistani fish, Christianity/Judaism for a Spanish-American-Australian fish, Hinduism for an Indian fish, and Buddhism for a Thai-Chinese-Japanese fish, to name the main oceans and omit many more seas and fishes. This water is the collective implicit¬†*mythos*¬†of the home society, in the bloodstream, even though it‚Äôs not at the level of explicit¬†*logos*. Having grown up in a non-religious family, in a secular, atheistic Czech Republic, I‚Äôm nonetheless more receptive to Christianity later in life because I‚Äôm primed by memories of Christmas and Easter, singing carols at school, seeing the nativity, churches, synagogues and cathedrals, and remembering Biblical stories about David, Moses and Jesus. By contrast, learning Kundalini at 31 means starting from scratch.

¬∑ Second, the odds of landing on the¬†*right*¬†spiritual practice (out of 50+) for the¬†*right*¬†person, sticking to it, and valuing it the same way a religious person values his faith are low in my view. That‚Äôs because, as per the previous point, the pathway towards religion is, for me, straightforward (towards Christianity), but the pathway towards spirituality is ‚Ä¶ what? Door #4, #14, or #44 in the hallway? How will I decide? What‚Äôs the basis for the value judgment guiding my selection? Picking and sticking to a spiritual practice as opposed to embracing foregrounded religion requires a combination of luck (to choose the¬†*right*¬†practice), self-discipline, commitment, time, curiosity and energy, most of which diminish with each passing year. There‚Äôs no way to know this but I‚Äôd like to see a comparison between spiritual people leaving their practice and religious people losing their faith.

¬∑ Third, it‚Äôs true that the individual freedom of choice is the default setting in the West, so yes, I can choose Catholicism, Buddhism, or Islam the same way I can choose Tai Chi, Vipassana, or Reiki. This freedom, though, pertains to most areas, such as food, clothes, hobbies, appearance, marital status, friends/partners, education/careers, sport/exercise, music/art/entertainment, political parties, holiday destinations, and even gender.

But the freedom to choose anything doesn‚Äôt mean I will choose the¬†*right thing for me*, and stick to it. And to make the right choice is, with spirituality, way harder than making almost any other choice, incl. religion, diet, clothes, exercise, career, or partner.  
  
Why?

Because most other choices are already somewhat made, as in, pre-loaded. We touched on religion, but there are others. For instance, when at a supermarket, I‚Äôm not scanning all 38 aisles and 500 shelves. When buying new clothes, I don‚Äôt go through the store for hours, rack by rack. When getting in shape, I don‚Äôt try all kinds of sports/exercise one by one. When looking for a job, I don‚Äôt scrutinize, and apply for all offerings. When on a dating app (previously at a club/party), I don‚Äôt sift through and comment on all profiles (previously approach all girls). In each case, the decision-making process is quick, almost automatic, yet not at all arbitrary.

So, spirituality ‚Äî unlike most mentioned choices ‚Äî is different because (1) the end goal, if any, is ambivalent and nebulous, (2) the options are endless, and (3) the basis for my decision-making isn‚Äôt a bedrock, but a quicksand.

Hence my hallway analogy.

**Can AI help?**

Algorithms and AI have been steering our daily behaviour for years. Who isn‚Äôt familiar with GPS navigation, tailored YouTube/Netflix watchlists, personalized social media feeds, customized Amazon purchases, Uber Eats recommendations, Skyscanner, or chatbots? Chat GPT and AI Overview are the newest additions. The general trajectory seems to be to equip, support and empower an autonomous individual to become even¬†*more*¬†autonomous, with increasingly powerful AI tools (e.g. AI agents).  
  
For better or worse, AI is already guiding my¬†**ordinary**¬†life a lot. Can it guide my¬†**spiritual**¬†life as well, as in, take me directly to door #4 and #44 in the hallway?  
  
Perhaps the best possible practice for me is Gnosticism mixed with Kabballah. But I‚Äôll never know because it‚Äôll never occur to me to try either, let alone both combined. For you, it might be Vipassana and Reiki. But how‚Äôll you know? You‚Äôre doing Tai Chi at the moment, on a friend‚Äôs recommendation. You might stick with it for another month or two, until you go to Bali on a yoga retreat and swap it for Kundalini, for six months. Even then, is Kundalini the¬†*best possible practice for you*? The only way to know is to try as many as possible and see what resonates. But that takes too long (years to master some practices), there are too many doors, and, again, you don‚Äôt know the basis for the value judgment guiding your selection.  
  
It‚Äôs crazy that in the age of digital hyper-personalization and customization, there is this massive blind spot, leaving millions of spiritual people wandering in the hallway at best, and sinking in the quicksand at worst.  
  
What‚Äôs needed is an AI ‚Äòtailor‚Äô, or ‚Äòbutler‚Äô, that would recommend the best possible practice to every individual.  
  
How?  
  
By gathering everything about each spiritual practice, teaching, and method based on records, accounts of people, books, history, trends, mentions in journals, and types of people gelling with various practices ‚Ä¶ and juxtaposing that info with your profile (which becomes increasingly precise, reflecting your personality type, character, behaviour, and disposition), to provide a fully tailored, customized spiritual ‚Äòrecipe‚Äô.  
  
Obviously, each person would have a different recipe, but I bet my neighbour‚Äôs boat that with today‚Äôs and emerging technology, there are ways of pointing our hallway wanderer to the best door(s) for him. Once behind the right door, the AI tool isn‚Äôt needed anymore, because then, the wisdom, books, methods, and teachings pertaining to each practice kick in, but¬†***not until the wanderer knows which door to enter.***  
  
It‚Äôs no wonder there is so much hunger for spirituality in the wealthy, liberal, educated, secular, and individualistic ‚Ä¶ but also unmoored, bereft and rudderless West.  
  
The fish¬†*will*¬†swim once thrown in the water. Why leave it flop around on the riverbank?  
  
It‚Äôs about time some tech wiz cracks this nut.

******************
Skylar
6th grade:
I‚Äôm walking into school behind my brother and Oliver, one of his best friends. They really don‚Äôt pay any
attention to me and only let me follow them to school because Mary makes them bring me. Mary is my
nanny, she has been with me as long as I can remember. My dad is the beta of the pack and really
busy, so Mary was brought on to teach me how to ‚Äòbehave like a lady,‚Äô which basically means teach me
to be silent unless spoken to and out of the way of the men. She does nothing of the sort, but my dad
doesn‚Äôt know that, as long as I make a good show when he‚Äôs around.
My brother spends most of his time with the future Alphas, Cameron and Dakota, the future Delta, Sam
and the future Gamma Oliver. They travel in a group wherever they go, they are almost worse than
some of the girls here.
Mary told him to make sure I got to and from school safely after I came home last week with a bruise
under my eye and scrapes up my arm. I tried to tell her it was an accident and that I tripped, it was not
a big deal, but she didn‚Äôt believe me. She knows I have been having trouble with kids at the school. I
live in a werewolf pack that feeds on hierarchy and dominance, of course at some point we are all
going to start trying to showcase our dominance, we‚Äôre middle schoolers.
What I have seen though is it‚Äôs more the non-ranked kids who are trying to show off for the ranked kids.
They are trying to gain status by being noticed. It‚Äôs funny to think that some kids are popular, just for
the rank they were born into, not what they have actually done. Obviously, everybody wants to be the
Alpha‚Äôs kids friends. That‚Äôs the height of all popularity. My brother, Sam and Oliver aren‚Äôt far behind
being rank born. I, however, don‚Äôt matter, even though I am the Beta‚Äôs daughter and have Beta blood. I
am the reason that my mother is dead, and that is reason enough to shun me to lower than an Omega.
That is why Mary fears for me, she has seen how kids openly treat me and no adult does a thing to
stop it, not even my father.
‚ÄúMove it fatty. You‚Äôre taking up the whole hallway and walking slower than a turtle. Are you sure you‚Äôre
a wolf?‚Äù Kaley sneers behind me. I just move to the side to try and get out of her way. She sticks her
foot between my legs and I trip sideways head first into a locker not being able to catch myself with my
armful of books.
The crash brings everyone to a halt. All eyes are on me, but the only ones I care about are my
brother‚Äôs. He turned to look at the sound and when I made eye contact he just shook his head, rolled
his eyes and turned to walk away, Oliver and Kaley following him. The rest of the kids in the hallway
disperse too, some laughing quietly, others not so quietly, but no one stops to help me up.
7th Grade:
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you ever question my authority in front of another student again!‚Äù Kaley shoulder checks me into
a door leading out to the courtyard in the middle of the school.
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt question your authority, I told you that you can‚Äôt hit kids just because they are in your way. If
you were late, that is not their fault.‚Äù I shouldn‚Äôt snap back at her, it only fuels her fire, but she‚Äôs starting
to get on my nerves. She was late because she skipped second period to go get coffee with her friends
and was late getting back to third period, who happens to be a teacher that will report her to her father.
Although nothing ever seems to happen when she is reported.
I right myself, set my focus down the hallway and move to walk away from the door that was holding
me up, but before I can get two steps, Marnie, one of Kaley‚Äôs little minions steps out to trip me, then
proceeds to dump her iced latte on my head. I hear cackles of laughter then others join in, meaning we
attracted a crowd.
I look up to see my brother and his friends joining in with the laughter. ‚ÄúMaybe if you trained a little
harder and lost some of that baby fat, you wouldn‚Äôt be so clumsy.‚Äù Kaley says not-so quietly to me then,
‚ÄúHey boys, are we up for hanging out at the fire pit tonight?‚Äù To my brother and his friends.",1,1756801993.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

1n6dvrw,https://i.redd.it/x0fk4mtumpmf1.png,:D #7036848 I think he wants to ask me out on a date.,"I think he wants to ask me out on a date, because otherwise I don't understand this level of insistence. I'm also surprised by something someone on this Reddit told me, which could be an alternate account of a moderator (they deleted the comments, by the way), and I think, if he's so interested in me, why doesn't he invite me for coffee? Although others think I can't complain about griefing because it's covered by the rules, that's a whole other issue. The rules state that griefing political party flags or portraits of politicians is allowed, not griefing someone's art like this. If it were simply a matter of drawing something better on top, I wouldn't see a problem, but this isn't drawing something better, and you can also see in the image how they are filling that area with green at the bottom right. That's not part of the art, it's griefing too. I also just wanted to say that I appreciate the few people who have helped me repair the Final Fantasy pixel art so far. It's a relief to see that not all of us just stand by and watch. I would appreciate it if the moderators would do something about :D #7036848, although I know they won't. Anyway, when the time comes, I know they'll destroy everything. but for now I'll keep repairing and adding to the pixel art in the surrounding area.

1n6dvj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/1n6dvj3/mortgage_advice_siblings_england/,"Mortgage advice, siblings, England","Hey everyone,

Have a mortgage and brother wants to remove his name, that is fine but he is threatening with solicitors as he wants money from the house and we said yes give us two years to sort things but only when your name is removed...Which he will not do...But keeps threatening for me to do it...??

It gets very complicated so I will try break everything down, our names are on the mortgage for our elderly disabled parents to retire here and not worry about the responsibilities of having a property

-Brother took a loan out to fund the costs to bring his wife from aboard over, he stopped paying the loan saying he can not afford it, loan was against the mortgage so interest aswell as an amount of ¬£1000 was not cleared

-Brother used to pay towards the mortgage, all us brothers paid so when the house sold we all got ¬º, brother stopped and demanded all his money he put in back

-We offered brother to move in the house instead so we would put in money like how he was, he refused

-We offered brother to house our parents even if it was temporary as alot was going on and brickworking it was very intense for everyone, they need someone to live with due to their needs and his partner was not working so she could of cared for them, brother refused

-Brother has never put in any work on the house however his children and himself have damage the house, broken a window, broken items from his children (glass table, swimming pool etc), even caused the fish to jump out stressed due to the behaviour of the children, brother did not pay anything towards damage, he laughed and would take the children home

-Our parents are disabled and child under 18 live here

-Brother is trying to demand how and what mortgage deal we have, brother is trying to take money against the house which we said no, we will sort money when his name is removed (replaced by the other brothers who agreed), brother refuses to acknowledge paying brothers and wants full control, brothers want their name on the mortgage but brother who wants name off refuses to start the process

-Brother on deeds but only wants his name off mortgage loan

We are not refusing money, we have an agreed amount but things take time this was unexpected but he demands he is removed from the mortgage, not the deeds as he blanked that, we have asked him multipe times for him to start the process but he blanks this also, all we asked was time and he covers his own fees and that time included a family meeting, he agreed on but then does not want to as his wife is not allowed to attend or children and then demands it is just myself and him at a meeting to remortgage the property so he can take money out without his name removed from mortgage and deeds or him paying in anything

** Background not as important so not needing to read **
It is becoming hassling now, we have stated for him to remove his name, he is demanding noone else has anything to do with the mortgage, he is refusing to remove his name while demanding it, we generally think that he thinks we do not talk to each other and our stupid, that he will get money for free then not remove his name, he also took our parents round claiming it was for coffee and then verbally bullied them demanding money (likely due to finding out our dad had inheritance), he had not seen them for months before and brother only has paid a few years on the mortgage, he never paid until a long time after it changed into our names and due to everything our parents who were meant to live basically rent free have also had to pick up the costs as we can not afford bills with his amount of money, noone was meant to recieve money until house was sold so he broke verbal contracts, he also threatens to force sale of the house again, with two disabled adults and a child under 18, our parents have lived here since the 90s and would not be able to move, we have not said he can not have money, just living crisis and the actual agreement means not now and certainly not until name is removed, brother also demands when he knows we have things on like everyone is going on holiday so he then 'starts', also the amount he has agreed pre interest would be lost if he did get legal advice/court, it is not that much, under ¬£15,000, I was ill and covering his costs from the loan and then him not paying I had to borrow in form of loans so I would need two years to sort myself out but we want his name off mortgage/deeds so our brothers will replace them but while he says this again, no actions

Thankyou

1n6duku,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marketresearch/comments/1n6duku/building_smart_surveys_ai_surveys_that_has/,"Building ""Smart Surveys"" - AI surveys that has conversations instead of just asking static questions. Useful or overthinking it?","Working on a concept called **Smart Surveys** and want feedback from people who do market research.

**The problem:** Traditional surveys give you ""Customer service: 3/5"" with zero actionable insight.

**Smart Surveys concept:** You provide business context + starting question, then AI has an intelligent conversation to dig deeper.

**Example (Coffee shop investigating service complaints):**

*Business sets up:*

* **Context:** ""Understanding why our service scores are dropping""
* **Opening question:** ""How was your experience with our service today?""

*AI takes over from there:*

* Customer: ""Pretty disappointing, took way too long""
* AI detects negative sentiment + ""too long"" ‚Üí asks: ""What part took the longest - ordering, waiting for your drink, or something else?""
* Customer: ""Waiting for my drink. Like 15 minutes for a simple coffee""
* AI: ""Was this during a busy time? What time roughly?""
* Customer: ""Monday morning around 8am, but it wasn't even that busy""

Now instead of ""service disappointing"" you know it's a Monday morning workflow issue, not staffing or volume.

**Questions:**

1. Does this solve a real problem or are traditional surveys fine?
2. Would you actually use AI that can have these discovery conversations?

Still building this - genuinely want feedback from people who live in the research world.

**What am I missing?**

**Context:** I'm working on this as an addition to our survey platform Revuloop. Right now it does AI survey generation and analytics, but I'm exploring this ""conversational"" approach as the next evolution. If you're curious about the current AI features while I build Smart Surveys, feel free to check it out - would love feedback on the existing tools too.",2,1756801153.0,Marketresearch,7,1.0,False
