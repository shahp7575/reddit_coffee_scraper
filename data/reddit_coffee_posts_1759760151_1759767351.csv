1nzndxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductCheckpoint/comments/1nzndxx/uncover_if_weiman_wood_polish_really_restores/,Uncover If Weiman Wood Polish Really Restores Furniture Shine,"Tackling the everyday challenge of restoring and preserving my wooden furniture, I recently turned to the Weiman 1643ZBP. This 3-in-1 bundle came as a well-deserved answer to dull finishes and streaky surfaces. Having tried various wood cleaners before, I didn‚Äôt expect something exceptional, but I must say, this product surprised me in several ways‚Äîboth good and not-so-good.

**Design and Packaging**  
One of the standout points about this wood and cabinet restorer is how thoughtfully packaged it is. The bottle is lightweight and ergonomic, fitting easily in my hand. This might sound trivial, but when you're tackling a large piece of furniture or several cabinets in one go, an easy-to-hold design makes a big difference. The inclusion of a microfiber cloth is a game-changer for me, saving the trouble of rummaging through old cleaning rags while also adding to the ease of application. Functionally and aesthetically speaking, the design ticks all the boxes without being overly complicated or gimmicky.

**Ease of Use**  
As someone who's not exactly a fan of overly technical cleaning methods, I loved how simple the application was. Give the bottle a shake, apply it to a clean damp cloth, and wipe the surface‚Äîit‚Äôs foolproof. I spent about fifteen minutes on a scratched coffee table from my kids‚Äô escapades; by the end, I could see a noticeable shine returning to the surface. Buffing it out with a dry cloth was equally straightforward, leaving behind a non-greasy finish. The circular motion technique mentioned in the instructions does require attention for optimal results, but it's intuitive enough for anyone to master.

**Key Benefits**  
- The formulation effectively removes dirt, grime, and residue without much muscle effort.  
- A UV shield is a quiet hero here, keeping wood surfaces safe from fading due to sunlight.  
- Reduces scratches significantly; my dining chairs looked almost new after a thorough wipe.  

[Check Weiman 1643ZBP price on Amazon.](https://reviews.senaar.com/p/b0ffcfmnn4/)  

**Performance and Results**  
After testing this product on multiple surfaces‚Äîfrom antique wood furniture to newer cabinets‚Äîthe most consistent thing has been its ability to make everything look polished without an oily residue. By the time I‚Äôd done my trim and wood paneling, even the faint discolorations caused by the sun seemed reduced. The advanced formula definitely works as advertised, and while it doesn‚Äôt completely erase deep scratches, it handles mild ones like a champ. However, I‚Äôd pair it with a good filler for a complete restoration if you‚Äôve got furniture that‚Äôs heavily scratched or damaged.

**Limitations**  
Despite its overall effectiveness, the product isn't entirely flawless.  
- Fails to completely hide deep scratches.  
- The ""natural shine"" claim may fall flat on exceptionally dull or untreated surfaces.  
- Limited quantity in the bottle may not suffice for larger restoration projects.  

**Competing Brands**  
Having experimented with similar products from Old English and Howard Feed-N-Wax, a few differences make Weiman stand out. Unlike Old English, which tends to leave a slightly oily residue, this doesn‚Äôt feel greasy at all, and that‚Äôs a big thumbs-up for me. On the other hand, Howard Feed-N-Wax offers better coverage for larger surfaces, but Weiman‚Äôs UV protection is unmatched. If safety from sunlight damage is your priority, this wood cleaner is the better option. That said, for polish longevity, Howard wax formulas have a smoother and longer-lasting finish, albeit with a touch more effort.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Considering how many features this wood restorer packs into one bottle, I‚Äôd say it offers commendable value. For someone like me who‚Äôs juggling kids, pets, and never-ending cleaning sessions, finding affordable quality in household essentials matters a lot. My biggest wish is that the bottle came with a slightly greater quantity to justify heavy-duty use on bigger projects. Budget-conscious buyers looking for safety and shine will definitely appreciate what this product brings to the table, though the lack of widespread availability in larger packages is noticeable.

1nznb81,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nznb81,5 Days in Chiang Mai reflection. Slower Pace + Crisp Air + omg Khao Soi (curry noodle soup),"I spent five days in Chiang Mai last Novemberz wasn‚Äôt too sure what to expect. But before visiting, my impression of Thailand was mostly shaped by Bangkok, Phuket, and Phi Phi. Super beautiful, yes, but also a bit chaotic in a sensory-overload way.

Heading north felt like stepping into a different rhythm. The pace was slower, the air crisp, and people were just‚Ä¶ more.. zen? You still get those dazzling golden temples and intricate architecture, but being surrounded by mountains makes it feel almost otherworldly.

One of my favorite memories was visiting elephants that truly seemed happy and well-cared-for, with rice fields and waterfalls in the background. It felt surreal.

And the food. my god. The Khao Soi alone is worth the trip.  

If you‚Äôre in Chiang Mai, try ‡∏Ç‡∏ô‡∏°‡∏à‡∏µ‡∏ô‡∏ö‡∏∏‡∏ü‡πÄ‡∏ü‡πà‡∏ï‡πå‡πÄ‡∏Æ‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏ô‡∏à‡πä‡∏≤‡∏á‡∏á‡∏≤‡∏°‡πÄ‡∏ä‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏á‡πÉ‡∏´‡∏°‡πà (no English name, just copy that into Google Maps). It‚Äôs a local buffet with curries and noodles‚Äî annd only 99 baht. Easily one of the most authentic meals I‚Äôve ever had.

The blue, white, and black temples were stunning in person ‚Äî photos online don‚Äôt do justice to the details of the carvings. So intricatee. 

And then there‚Äôs the caf√© scene. Chiang Mai has some of the most creative caf√©s I‚Äôve seen anywhere. There was one that literally look like a little forest, a Japanese-subway-themed spot, another with 1000 koi, and even one that looked like Versailles.

My favorite cafes hopping spots 
- Sunday baker¬†- Cordon blue certified pastry chef
- No.39 Cafe -¬†Super funky spot with a pond in the center (not swimmable) and a cute elevated stage for live music. There‚Äôs a cute slide that you can slide down.¬†
- Transit Number 8 - The Japanese subway themed cafe not only has all the cute stops for photo ops both inside and outside, but it also has a mix of boho and minimalistic modern style spots for photos. There‚Äôs 2 building- one for cafe and one for ice cream. Their affogato coffee was so awesome and amazing. 
- Versaille de Flores - boujie¬†Parisian style architecture 
- Chom Cafe and Restaurant ‡∏ä‡∏°‡∏Ñ‡∏≤‡πÄ‡∏ü‡πà - foggy forest¬†makes you feel like a fairy. Beautiful dessert options 
- Carp Cafe - has more than 1000 koi fish in the pond.¬†You don‚Äôt have to buy food/drinks to enter, you can just pay $100bhat to go in for pictures¬†

But honestly, what made the trip special were the people. Everyone was friendly and laid-back ‚Äî no hard selling or haggling, even at the night markets. Just easy conversations and genuine smiles. ",4,1759766862.0,travel,0,1.0,False

1nzn92u,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nzn92u/richtech_robotics_rr_a_deep_dive_into_an_emerging/,Richtech Robotics (RR): A Deep Dive into an Emerging AI Robotics Player Ahead of Octobers Nvidia Powered Humanoid Robot Reveal,"Hey r/stocks, let‚Äôs talk about a small-cap robotics name that‚Äôs flying under the radar but could pop off soon: Richtech Robotics ($RR). Trading at \~$6.60 with a \~$900M market cap, this company‚Äôs already got real-world AI robots pouring drinks at Walmart and NASA events, and they‚Äôre gearing up to drop a next-gen humanoid powered by Nvidia‚Äôs Thor chip at the GTC conference in D.C. (Oct 27-29, 2025). I‚Äôve been digging into this one, and with the robotics sector heating up, $RR looks like a speculative bet with big upside if they deliver. Here‚Äôs my take - let‚Äôs break it down.

What‚Äôs Richtech All About?

Richtech‚Äôs a Vegas-based outfit, started in 2016, focused on AI-powered service robots for places like restaurants, hotels, and retail. Their big draw is a ‚ÄúRobot-as-a-Service‚Äù (RaaS) model - think renting out bots with recurring revenue from software and upkeep, keeping costs low for clients. Their flagship robot, ADAM, is a humanoid-ish barista/bartender that uses AI (vision and language tech) to mix cocktails, brew coffee, and even chat with customers. It‚Äôs already served over 16,000 drinks at spots like Walmart Supercenters in Georgia, Kennedy Space Center for NASA gigs, and Space Force events. Real deployments, not just lab demos.

The real kicker? Richtech‚Äôs about to unveil a new humanoid robot at Nvidia‚Äôs GTC conference this month. It‚Äôs powered by Nvidia‚Äôs Jetson Thor chip, built for advanced autonomy -think robots that can learn tasks on the fly, not just sling drinks but potentially handle warehouse or healthcare jobs. CEO Zhenwu Huang‚Äôs been hyping 1-2 new models, and this could put $RR in the same convo as Tesla‚Äôs Optimus or Figure AI. With 20+ patents and robots in 10+ countries, they‚Äôre not just talk. The robotics market‚Äôs expected to hit $38B by 2030, and service bots like these tackle real labor shortages in hospitality - big opportunity.

The Numbers: Small Today, Big Tomorrow

Richtech‚Äôs still early-stage, so don‚Äôt expect Apple-level financials. Last quarter (Q2 2025), they pulled in $1.17M in revenue, roughly flat year-over-year, with $4.13M over the past 12 months. They‚Äôre burning cash on R&D (losses around $14M last year), but that‚Äôs typical for a growth company betting on a breakout. Gross margins are solid at \~75% thanks to software and RaaS, and they‚Äôve got low debt with a small cash pile to keep things moving. A $4M sales deal with a joint venture partner is set to close soon, which could juice Q4 numbers, and their recent Russell 3000 inclusion means ETF funds are starting to buy in.

The stock‚Äôs been wild-up 600%+ in the past year, with a 20% jump to $6.60 on October 3 after insane trading volume ($590M, 130x normal). At \~200x forward sales, it‚Äôs priced like an AI darling, but if they scale to $25M revenue by 2026 (doable with RaaS and humanoid pilots), the math checks out for a $3-5B valuation down the line. Compare that to Figure AI‚Äôs $39B private valuation with no revenue-$RR‚Äôs got room to run.

Why Now? The Nvidia GTC Catalyst

The October Nvidia conference is the big one. Richtech‚Äôs new humanoid, powered by Thor‚Äôs edge AI, could steal the show with a demo of real-time task learning. If it goes viral (think X posts or YouTube clips), expect a 30-50% stock pop, like we‚Äôve seen with other robotics names on big reveals. Beyond that, here‚Äôs what‚Äôs cooking:

RaaS Scaling: Q4 results from Walmart and NASA pilots could show revenue ticking up, especially with that $4M deal closing.

Index Boost: Russell 2000/3000 inclusion means passive ETF buying, maybe $50-100M in inflows this month.

Sector Heat: Robotics is hot-Figure AI‚Äôs at $39B, Tesla‚Äôs Optimus hype drives $1T valuations, and smaller players like $SERV are ripping. $RR‚Äôs in the right place.

M&A Potential: Nvidia partnership could lead to bigger deals. Maybe a SpaceX collab for kicks?

Analysts peg a $3.57 price target for 2025, but that feels way too conservative. Momentum traders on X are calling $10-15 by year-end if the GTC reveal delivers.

The Risks

No free lunch here. Richtech‚Äôs burning cash, so dilution‚Äôs a risk if they need to raise more-keep an eye on filings. The humanoid reveal could flop if the demo‚Äôs underwhelming (Tesla‚Äôs Optimus has had stumbles). Competition‚Äôs brutal-Figure AI, Tesla, and China‚Äôs Unitree are bigger players, though $RR‚Äôs service niche gives it an edge. And if the market turns bearish, small caps like this (beta \~2.0) get hit hard. Tech glitches, like a robot spilling coffee mid-demo, could tank sentiment too.

My Take

I see $RR as a high-risk, high-reward play. If the Nvidia GTC humanoid reveal lands (Oct 27-29), $10-15 by year-end is realistic, with $5B market cap potential by 2027 if they hit $50M in revenue (just 1% of the robotics market). Worst case, a weak demo or market dip could drag it back to $4. For growth investors, this is a name to watch - Nvidia‚Äôs stamp of approval and real deployments make it more than hype.

What do you all think? Bullish on the humanoid reveal? Skeptical on execution? Let‚Äôs hear it. Data as of Oct 6, 2025, 10:51 AM CDT. Sources: Company filings, Yahoo Finance, Nvidia GTC announcements. Not investment advice - do your own research!",4,1759766733.0,stocks,0,1.0,False

Bill Wilson, Carl Jung, and the Occult Origins of Alcoholics Anonymous 

You‚Äôll never hear this in a church basement over stale coffee and cigarette smoke, but the sacred text of Alcoholics Anonymous was written on a bed drenched in psychedelic sweat. Bill Wilson, the patron saint of the twelve-step, didn‚Äôt find God in a pew; he found Him in a poison-trip delirium at Towns Hospital in New York, riding the Belladonna Cure‚Äîa brutal cocktail of nightshade and mercury administered every hour on the hour for fifty straight hours. Let me repeat that: fifty hours. The man was essentially force-fed a medieval witch‚Äôs brew until the walls melted and God showed up as a blinding white light. Yes, the Big Book‚Äôs foundational spiritual awakening was brought to you by a high-pressure salesman named Towns, who owned the hospital that treated Bill for alcoholism. He claimed he got the shamanic recipe from some anonymous ‚Äúcountry doctor‚Äù‚Äîwhich is code for either an enlightened medicine man or a homeless guy who really knew his fungi. Either way, Bill W. was absolutely orbiting the planet when he decided to save the world from the bottle.

This was the 1930s, and the Western world was having a collective nervous breakdown. The occult was all the rage with the intellectual elite, a kind of spiritual panic-buying as the British Empire‚Äôs collapse brought back exotic beliefs from the East like souvenirs. Bill dove headfirst into this scene. We‚Äôre talking seances, channeling, the whole spook-show. He was also corresponding with occultist and psychologist Carl Jung, who‚Äôd already decided that alcoholism was a ""spiritual thirst‚Äù and that only a full-blown mystical experience could cure it. Jung was neck-deep in the Oxford Group, a secretive society obsessed with cracking the code of the Templars‚Äô lost spiritual tech‚Äîthe real ‚ÄúHoly Grail,‚Äù which wasn‚Äôt a literal cup but a method: Il Graduale, a step-by-step guide to enlightenment the Catholic Church tried to erase.

So Bill takes this template, this esoteric, alchemical ladder meant to turn the lead of human suffering into the gold of enlightenment, and he simplifies it into the Twelve Steps. It was supposed to be a liberating ascent. But somewhere between the mystical origins and the church basements, the gold turned back into lead. The program that was meant to expand consciousness became a factory for shrinking it. Independent thought was swapped out for thought-terminating clich√©s: ‚ÄúLet go and let God,‚Äù ‚ÄúFake it till you make it,‚Äù ‚ÄúYour best thinking got you here.‚Äù The quest for the Grail became a surrender to groupthink. The pineal gland‚Äôs antenna to the divine was swapped for a lifetime of nicotine and discount donuts.

Bill knew it was failing. He knew most people weren‚Äôt having these profound awakenings. So in the 1950s, he went back to the well (the chemical well). He started experimenting with LSD, hoping it could kickstart the mystical experience for ‚Äúcynical alcoholics‚Äù who couldn‚Äôt get there with coffee and confession. He even treated other members himself. He saw it as a tool, a shortcut back to that Belladonna-grade revelation. But the organization he built had already hardened into a dogma. They looked at their founder, seeing God on acid, and sneered: ‚ÄúBill takes one pill to see God, and another to quiet his nerves.‚Äù

And so AA‚Äôs origin story became the oldest story in the book: a beautiful, dangerous, alchemical truth gets sanded down, sanitized, and sold back to the masses as a lifeline. What began as a wild-eyed quest for God in the psychedelic poison became a program that often feels less like freedom and more like a softly-spoken cage. The seeker‚Äôs journey became a sinner‚Äôs script. Thanks anyway, Bill. We see what you were going for. It‚Äôs a shame the cure for the disease became a symptom of the same sickness.

How the AA Method Works: 
A User‚Äôs Guide to Divine Surrender

The AA process, at its origin, wasn‚Äôt just about quitting the bottle. It was an alchemical biohack‚Äîa forced pathway to spiritual awakening disguised as recovery. It‚Äôs a system engineered to do one thing: elevate your kundalini (dormant spiritual energy) and resurrect the divine light within. In rare, but documented cases, this leads to what‚Äôs been called spiritual awakening, the Christos alchemical rebirth‚Äîthe descent of the Holy Spirit, the quest for the Holy Grail. Today it's commonly known as pineal gland activation. 

Its roots dig deep into the ancient mystery schools of the Greeks and Egyptians and lead all the way to the current day Knights Templar, Rosicrucians, and Freemasons, their common traditions encoded in myth, architecture, and symbol for millennia. And while many occult & esoteric mystery school paths lead to the same enlightenment, they all begin the same way: surrender.

You can approach this awakening through three main doors: love, devotion, or madness. You surrender your rational mind to a person, to a set of beliefs & traditions, or to sanity itself. AA chooses devotion to a set of beliefs & traditions. It doesn‚Äôt matter what you worship‚Äîa doorknob, Shiva, JC, a tree, the group itself, anything but your own miserable, bankrupt ego‚Äîso long as you bend the knee to something other than yourself. This act of submission is the first, crucial step. It‚Äôs about switching off the rational mind, that arrogant, yapping manager in your skull that thinks it‚Äôs in charge.

Think of a dog walking through a city. They look up at a skyscraper, trying to understand it. They can‚Äôt. They don't have the cognitive ability to comprehend human engineering, and they're colorblind to the neon signs we see blazing. Where we see a bright red ‚ÄúOPEN‚Äù sign, the dog sees a dull, gray slab. Their dog brain just cannot process the engineering of a higher species. Now scale that up: You are that dog, trying to grasp divine engineering. God‚Äîor the architecture of the universe, your subconscious, whatever you want to call it‚Äîis the city. Your rational mind is not just useless here; it‚Äôs a liability. It‚Äôs barking at vacuums. 

This is likely why the Bible hammers on-and-on about fear. The most frequently repeated commandment in the Bible is ‚ÄúFear not‚Äù which appears 365 times‚Äîone for every day of the year. It‚Äôs not a suggestion; it‚Äôs a prescription. Your amygdala, that ancient lizard-brain panic button, is the primary obstacle to spiritual progress. You wouldn‚Äôt perform open-heart surgery on yourself while wide awake, would you? So why would you want to stare, fully conscious and rational, into the exposed, corrupted mess of your own soul? To encounter the divine raw would shatter most people. Permanent psychosis, lost forever in the labyrinth of their subconscious.

Enter the sponsor. This isn‚Äôt some cheerful buddy; this is your guide through the underworld. Your guru of the gutters. Their job is to hold the tennis ball‚Äîto distract you while God runs the vacuum cleaner in your brain. You are not meant to do this alone. To stare into the abyss without a guide is to risk falling in‚Äîforever. The sponsor is the voice that says, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look directly at that white light yet. Look at me. Read this step. Call me instead of taking a drink.‚Äù They are the human shield between your fragile, flickering consciousness and the blinding, annihilating light of truth. You learn to trust the process by learning to trust them. And through that trust, you build the courage to eventually trust something even Bigger.

This is where AA‚Äôs genius (or its occult rigor) truly shines. It forces you to confront your deepest, most ubiquitous fears: public speaking, confession, radical honesty. These are not moral exercises; they are neurological drills. Shadow work. Amygdala reps. Every time you stand in a room of strangers and say, ‚ÄúMy name is ______, and I am an alcoholic,‚Äù you are doing soul-work. You are sanding down your own ego, fear, and dishonesty through sheer, brutal repetition.

And this is where esoteric Christianity‚Äôs core tenet ‚Äòradical acceptance‚Äô becomes the ultimate neuro-hack. ‚ÄúTurn the other cheek‚Äù isn‚Äôt about being a doormat, or finger-waving moral advice; it‚Äôs about overriding a million years of evolutionary wiring for retaliation. It‚Äôs consciously quieting the limbic system‚Äôs scream for justice. When you can face the worst possible scenario‚Äîtotal humiliation, failure, death‚Äîand breathe through it, you initiate a profound shift in your nervous system. It's the neurological mechanism behind most esoteric/occult spiritual practices meant to raise the kundalini, including modern day Bikram Yoga. 

Radical acceptance and amygdala training clears blocked chakras. You open energetic channels. You allow the microtubules within your neurons‚Äîthe very structures theorized to facilitate quantum coherence in the brain‚Äîto relax from a state of defensive rigidity. It is in this state of coherence, some propose, that consciousness fully enters the body; that the wave function of potential experience collapses from possibility into being. But when the amygdala is engaged‚Äîwhen you are trapped in fight-or-flight‚Äîthose microtubules constrict. You become a reactive puppet, severed from source, trapped in the illusion of separateness.

This amygdala training, this rewiring of fear, combined with somatic practices like semen retention (a classic occult method for conserving and transmuting vital energy), forms the bedrock of initiating a kundalini awakening. It‚Äôs why these methods are often concealed. We‚Äôve all heard about Gandhi testing his restraint by sleeping beside naked young women. This work goes further (stranger, more extreme) than anyone basking in the ‚Äúpink cloud‚Äù of early sobriety could possibly imagine. Hey, nobody said it was easy. 

Finally, there is community service, aka karma yoga for the broken. This isn‚Äôt about being a good person. It‚Äôs about energy maintenance. As the kundalini fire begins to rise, the system must remain in balance. Selfless service grounds the energy. It prevents you from blowing a fuse and ending up another enlightened lunatic shouting at pigeons (or barking at dogs) in the park. It connects you to something larger than your own awakening, ensuring the current doesn‚Äôt consume the wire.

So no, AA isn‚Äôt just about not drinking. It‚Äôs a factory for saints and madmen. It‚Äôs a boot camp for the soul, using fear as a whetstone to sharpen the spirit. You come for the sobriety. You stay for the awakening. And if you do it right‚Äîwith a guide who knows the path‚Äîyou leave fearing nothing at all.

 
12 Steps 2.0: A Modern Templar Framework for Liberation from Addiction & Compulsive Consumption

Recovery as Counterinsurgency in the 5th Generation of Warfare for your Mind, Body, & Soul

Premise:
Addiction is not a moral weakness or personal failure‚Äîit‚Äôs a systemic one. The myth of a ‚Äòchemical imbalance‚Äô is a victim blaming tactic that obscures reality: we‚Äôve been programmed, poisoned, and preyed upon by bad actors since birth. Real recovery requires rewiring, not repentance. We may be bruised in battle, but we will win the war.

Step 0: We Admitted We Were Under Siege
Before surrender came tactical awareness. We recognized that our minds, bodies, and spirits had been colonized by the evil empires of distraction, depletion, and dependency. This was not by accident‚Äîit was a cleverly disguised ambush attack by a superior army. Eventually we came to a point in our battles where it was necessary to declare a strategic withdrawal, so we could save our lives and fight another day.

Step 1. We Waved the White Flag of Our Ego
We surrendered to our own ignorance, recognizing that our inner world and dysfunction had become unmanageable. We admitted that our mental faculties had been hacked by formidable forces‚Äî Big Pharma, Big Food, Big Tech, and institutional narratives that brainwashed us into adopting self-destructive coping mechanisms of over consumption. Our 'powerlessness' was engineered by a psychopathic system that burns the capitalist-candle at both ends, so they can profit from our gluttony and the ensuing illness it causes. They designed our dis-ease so they could cash-in on the cure, but we refuse to be remedied by the same machine that broke us. We realized that no one is coming to save us but ourselves. So we began our counterattack.

Step 2. The Neurochemical Reboot
Following in the footsteps of AA founder Bill Wilson‚Äôs alchemical journey, we initiated a neural reset: a medically supervised, therapeutic ‚Äòmacro-dose‚Äô of plant psychedelics (ibogaine, psilocybin, or ayahuasca) to dissolve the addictive loops and delete the malware. We buried our old selves ceremonially.

Step 3. The Shadow Integration:
Here, with a guide, we entered the cave. With courage, we turned inward to confront our Shadow‚Äîthe disowned parts of ourselves that the addiction masked. We conducted a searching and fearless moral inventory of our transgressions, resentments, and fears. We did this not for self-flagellation, but for reconnaissance, because to know the enemy within is to disarm it. We did this without excessive rumination and we kept the therapy-industrial complex out of it. Their goal is incurable consumers, not healed warriors.

Step 4. The 90-Day Mitochondrial Crusade
Toxins out, energy up. Fasting, ketogenic nutrition, cold exposure, therapeutic lipids, and infrared sauna became our weapons. We starved the parasites‚Äîliteral and metaphorical‚Äîand reclaimed our cellular sovereignty.

Step 5. The Tribe Transformation
We exited enabler ecosystems, sought those who challenged us, and connected with an ‚Äòinner guide‚Äô or ‚Äòsource of wisdom‚Äô in the form of a recovery sponsor or spiritual guru. No more complaining to our comfort-cult. We built a circle of trusted warriors who sharpened one another 

Step 6. Daily Gratitude and Fear Extinction
We weaponized mindfulness. Through yoga, Wim Hof breathwork, and somatic practices, we recalibrated our amygdala‚Äîrewiring terror into tenacity. We audited our blessings daily, realizing the only way to have enough is to want much less. We shed the skin of programmed consumption and became creators, not captive customers‚Äîfueled by intuition, beauty, and nature - not inertia, indoor misery, and gluttony.

Step 7. Claiming the Courageous Archetype
We studied the laws of nature, the alchemical symbology of transformation, and the sacred myths that mirrored our struggle (Pinocchio, Osiris, Jonah, Odysseus, Dionysus, etc). We imprinted these symbols, story plots, and hero archetypes into our subconscious until the hero‚Äôs journey transformation became instinct. 

Step 8. Engineering Our Hero‚Äôs Journey
We confessed our worst transgressions in a rebirth ritual, then never spoke of them again, because rumination is the foe of joy. We spoke openly and honestly about our personal defects, and listened to other addicts share their recovery stories so we could gain deeper insight into how the disorder of addiction manifests in our own lives. We broke the cycles of victimhood, stopped begging others for their permission, and chose action over crybaby catharsis. Inner-engineering and future-self visualization became our compasses: we met the liberated version of ourselves and followed their map.

Step 9. Biohacking the Reward Regimen
We replaced cheap dopamine hits with earned peaks: flow states, mastery, and real-world wins. Service to others became our highest currency‚Äî guiding those still trapped in addiction, the holy grail.

Step 10. Spiritual Shielding
We adopted a daily meditative or spiritual practice‚Äînot as escapism, but as tactical training for the mind, and a way to balance our energetic bodies.

Step 11. Antifragile Conditioning
We trained like our lives depended on it (because they do). Healthy stress became our ally‚Äî weights, fasting, and cognitive challenges forged resilience.

Step 12. Burn the Blueprint & Carry the Message Forward
We rejected cookie-cutter recovery, recognizing that everyone takes a different path. We internalized the main Jungian principles of shadow integration, subconscious archetype programming, and participation mystique, then burned the specific blueprint. We carried the message forward to struggling addicts, and pledged to update our methods with (real) breakthroughs addiction / shamanic sciences. This is an initial prototype, not a dogma. We evolve or repeat.  

The Templar Oath
""I will not kneel to the systems that broke me.
I will weaponize my healing, protect those still trapped, and reclaim my sovereignty‚Äîby any means necessary.‚Äù

Thanks everyone for your thoughtful feedback.  A few comments: 

1) I didn't realize lovebombing had a real definition, so thanks for the info. 

2) your response that he appeared to be listening to me was reassuring.  And helped me to remain calm and not freak out.

3) he didn't take days off.  Instead, I agreed to his request to have my friend give him updates on my surgery. And we briefly spoke when I returned from the hospital or the following day (I don't remember). 

4) Normally, we meet on weekends, but I said, let's play the following weekend by ear, and he agreed. 


**HOW TO SLOW DOWN**

Soooo... we did meet the weekend after my surgery, and he was kind and considerate.  He suggested things that I could physically do, and if I needed to rest, he entertained himself. It was easy and comfortable.


So, I'm falling for him.  When I'm with him, it feels like 'home.'  (Song: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/8C8CvRRsHSM ) And he feels the same way; he's thinking about the future - and possibly one together.  He's not pushy, but he's thinking about a future, how to handle the distance, meet his family, possible trips, etc.  And mentally, I'm still thinking, ""it was just supposed to be coffee"" but now I have a cute and considerate man who I want to spend my time running errands and laughing with.


I'm going to speak to my therapist, but do you have suggestions on how to slow down?  And/or good suggestions to ask?  We've already discussed health, kids.

1nzn4z5,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1nzn4z5/crooked_homeless_shelter_in_fresno/,Crooked homeless shelter in Fresno,"I guess it all started when I lost my job I was hit with a streak of unfortunate events and because I couldn't pay rent my family or who I was staying with my brothers and did have kicking me out I slept on a bench for about a month at a park frequently being woken up by people asking me if I have a heroin or methamphetamine meanwhile trying my hardest to get into a homeless shelter everyday I would show up at 3:00 in the morning so I could be first in line before anybody to be seen when that didn't work I kind of lost hopelessness it wasn't until I had gotten jumped for my stuff and left pretty swollen up about the face I guess that a caseworker named Ada took me into the shelter I consider her an angel true and sometimes it's still like to thank her for everything she's done for me she saved my life anyways everything was going fine the first three weeks that I was there she was my caseworker and she was working on getting his housing I had gone all my paperwork done proof of income which they asked for they asked for a copy of your social and they asked for a copy of your ID. There's one person at the shelter that I believe is the reason why I'm not being housed. You see I came to find out that my old manager from the store I was fired from and was currently suing is family with a local resident at the shelter named T. You see he had gotten word that I was suing my old company his nephew is the manager of that company not a week later Ada was transferred out of my shelter and my housing abruptly stopped. Was then changed to a person named Dennis who for the most part in my opinion is incapable of being any kind of caseworker/counselor. I began to notice people trying to mistreat me around the shelter like they had some kind of grudge against me and I would like to let it be known that since Ada had departed from the shelter I had received no meetings that's zero meetings with my case worker since which has been continuing until today. I've been here now 9 months still waiting for my case worker to make any kind of meeting or do anything for me. I got to know this place extremely well the truth is that they take in people and House people that they already know and or our family with so they're not actually helping homeless they're picking and choosing who they want in these rooms it just was sheer luck that I got in. T the local resident is a drug dealer he's been a pimp out here on Parkway since the 2000s I've seen him hit women I've seen him sell drugs I've seen him threaten other residents he openly goes after the girls that he feels are attractive even though he's pushing 60 it's amazing what drugs can do. He sells methamphetamine and marijuana out of his room. So the shelter receives donations from other stores around the city and they're supposed to pass them out to the clients unfortunately I've not really seen much of it what happens is that the employees get first pick at whatever kind of donations get brought to us so they end up taking all the good stuff. They take the laundry detergent they take the soaps they take our shampoo and conditioner snacks a lot of snacks and leave nothing for us. Many a times I've heard of people complaining that things come up missing in their rooms because they do multiple room checks invading our privacy. After Ada had left I had gotten written up close to and I'm not exaggerating when I say this but 20 times. I noticed the complete shift in demeanor from all the employees here they would scoff at me and basically treat me like crap. So I did what I do best and I listened. I came to find out that the program director here at the shelter I'm living in was and is good friends with resident drug dealer T. He knew what he was doing yet never reprimanded him or so much is slapped him in the wrist or anything he did. He was able to roll blunts in front of the employees and nobody would tell him anything he would even smoke them on the property and nothing would happen usually somebody gets kicked out for something like that. I knew something was wrong I couldn't quite put my finger on it but I felt like it had a lot to do with me ceiling his nephew. I wasn't aware of how big the problem actually was it turns out that the person in charge of all the shelters in my city is actually related to T and my old manager. They've somehow created a corrupt family organization to steal from the homeless multiple times I've had my ID and social security card missing without any trace of where it went or footage of anybody going in my room since they wouldn't share it with me. When I tell you it's been a living nightmare I mean it it's literally been hell on Earth for me I've spent 9 months almost 10 here with zero progress besides from the first few weeks I was here with Ada that was the only time I actually felt that I was going to be housed. There's a discrepancy of ethnic people that are getting housed compared to non ethnic everybody knows it however nobody likes to say anything because of fear they're going to be put out next. As I pack my things again in my luggage ready for anything or at least to be put out I'm starting to realize the enormity of this family's power and corruption in my city. They literally have everybody's life in their hands and they're getting rich off taking advantage of the homeless. They pick and choose who they want to help leaving the majority of the people in the shelters homeless again. There's favoritism left and right. It's become such a problem that's it's created a racial war between blacks and Mexicans here. Daily I have to walk the streets in fear of my life because of my skin color. What was it last month one of t's good friends got her room here at the shelter and he's a radical Israelite who took it upon himself to cuss me out while I was getting coffee one morning and insult me in various ways. Even busted my friend's lip last week by hitting her with a big walking stick he carries around. He spreads angry hateful messages of supremacy around the shelter and every time he can he gives me the dirtiest looks you can give someone. Another resident named chocolate who hates my guts is being housed today as we speak she's also good friends with T and and told me yesterday that if she really wanted to she could get away with killing anybody at the shelter and she would still be housed. She told me that I have no idea how many nights she's plotted on my demise and ways she can get rid of me and or get me hurt. I've been let down by the system and I've definitely been let down by my city. I've lost hope in being housed by anybody here. Like I said since Aida left I've received zero meetings with my case workers. They just don't care. I'm not too sure what I'm going to do next or what I'm supposed to do in order to receive some kind of help or get housing I'm planning on going homeless again. Word on the street is that they're closing the shelters down in December due to lack of funding. I definitely feel like my rights have been violated here and there's some kind of Injustice going on that can't do anything about. Is it fair that other people get multiple trays of food and I can only get one a day? Is it fair that some people get snacks and some people don't? Is it fair that some people receive help for housing and other people get forgotten? Is it fair that people receive rooms in the shelter if they're related to somebody that works here before people that have been homeless for years? Is it fair that the shelter hires people who are family members or good friends with the people in charge of the shelters to begin with? But then something clicked in my head and I remembered how corrupt my old boss was at my old job. He would force customers to have sex with him and or kick them out and because I had spoke up on it I got fired. Well I recently won a settlement from my old company it's not much but it's something. And I remember how he would run that store corruption with an iron fist and it's just how this family is running this shelter apples don't fall far from trees and I'm seeing that first hand.

Hi I just saw a message on Instagram for a clothing brand looking for a co-founder helping with structure and finance so the founder can focus on the creative aspect.
You don‚Äôt have to invest, could be a plus, but you can also help and require investors for the brand.

Personally I have worked as a hospitality manager for over 4 years, and now recruitment and sales for 2,5 years. In the transport industry and now 1 year in information management where our clients are governmental organizations. Based in Netherlands, the message will be Dutch, keep that in mind. 

I really want to have a job where I get to be more creative and have passion. The brand is pretty cool, edgy and has been excising for 3 years or so. So the message can be playfull and ‚Äúcool‚Äù. That‚Äôs kindoff what I‚Äôm going for.

I can reach out via DM.
But so unsure what to message! I need something catchy and intriguing, but also want to share my experience so he knows I‚Äôm up for the task..  rn I have this long-ass message.. but I don‚Äôt know if it is good enough and if I‚Äôm right for the job. Please rate my message! 

Hi [NAME]

I‚Äôm going to take a shot, because I‚Äôm ready for a new challenge and some passion in my life. I‚Äôve been following [BRAND] since june, and what you‚Äôre doing really speaks to me: raw, playful, and adventurous.

today I saw that you‚Äôre looking for a co-founder who can bring structure and help with investors and partnerships. I might not have all the experience on paper, but I‚Äôm confident I can apply my skills to make [BRAND] investment-ready and build valuable collaborations.

I can‚Äôt invest myself, but I love working hard for something I truly care about. I‚Äôm a dreamer, but also a realist.

In my current role as a sales consultant, I regularly hold client meetings and close deals with government institutions. The industry I‚Äôm in is, to be honest, pretty soul-sucking, and I‚Äôm eager to work somewhere inspiring. Maybe that‚Äôs [BRAND]?

On top of that, I have 4 years of experience as a manager on the beach ‚Äî leading teams, managing and improving processes, and keeping everything running smoothly in a busy, dynamic environment. I stay calm under pressure, am highly organized, and practical.

This feels like a chance to build something completely new and put my energy fully into a brand that truly inspires people. I‚Äôd love to create a movement together with [BRAND]

Would love to grab a coffee sometime and see if there‚Äôs a connection!

You don‚Äôt have to invest, could be a plus, but can also help and require investors for the brand.

Personally I have worked as a hospitality manager for over 4 years, and now recruitment and sales for 2,5 years. In the transport industry and now 1 year in information management where our clients are governmental organizations. Based in Netherlands, the message will be Dutch, keep that in mind. 

I really want to have a job where I get to be more creative and have passion. The brand is pretty cool, edgy and has been excising for 3 years or so. So the message can be playfull and ‚Äúcool‚Äù. That‚Äôs kindoff what I‚Äôm going for.

I can reach out via DM.
But so unsure what to message! I need something catchy and intriguing, but also want to share my experience so he knows I‚Äôm up for the task..  rn I have this long-ass message.. but I don‚Äôt know if it is good enough and if I‚Äôm right for the job. Please rate my message! 

Hi [NAME]

I‚Äôm going to take a shot, because I‚Äôm ready for a new challenge and some passion in my life. I‚Äôve been following [BRAND] since june, and what you‚Äôre doing really speaks to me: raw, playful, and adventurous.

today I saw that you‚Äôre looking for a co-founder who can bring structure and help with investors and partnerships. I might not have all the experience on paper, but I‚Äôm confident I can apply my skills to make [BRAND] investment-ready and build valuable collaborations.

I can‚Äôt invest myself, but I love working hard for something I truly care about. I‚Äôm a dreamer, but also a realist.

In my current role as a sales consultant, I regularly hold client meetings and close deals with government institutions. The industry I‚Äôm in is, to be honest, pretty soul-sucking, and I‚Äôm eager to work somewhere inspiring. Maybe that‚Äôs [BRAND]?

On top of that, I have 4 years of experience as a manager on the beach ‚Äî leading teams, managing and improving processes, and keeping everything running smoothly in a busy, dynamic environment. I stay calm under pressure, am highly organized, and practical.

This feels like a chance to build something completely new and put my energy fully into a brand that truly inspires people. I‚Äôd love to create a movement together with [BRAND]

Would love to grab a coffee sometime and see if there‚Äôs a connection!

When I first initially met him he wanted to sleep with me but he didn‚Äôt want to date me because he felt that the age gap was too much. I stopped talking to him because I was just coming out of a relationship where I had felt used. I changed my number deleted his and moved on. We met again months later and he came and apologised and was very sweet. And we were pretty inseparable after that. 

A year into our relationship I looked through his Instagram and phone. He was always a bit strange with it. I didn‚Äôt know if I was making too much into it. He puts it face down around me, was tense if I picked it up and always turns it on airplane mode.

So I asked to look at Instagram and I went through it and saw that during the first  6 months of the relationship he was still talking to his ex. He had been meeting up with her. And then she seemed to have lost interest and stopped replying and he was still trying to message her and get a conversation going. 

Now this ex is the one who got away. She‚Äôs a former model, works in his dream industry. They broke up because she found him chatting to other women on Facebook. He also had random hey messages to women he says are just friends. 

I didn‚Äôt say anything but it was in the back of my mind. Then he started working with a new female coworker who he was constantly mentioning. When I have opinions on people he would tell me I‚Äôm too judgemental etc, then come home after work and tell me this coworker had said the exact same opinion and he had never heard of it before and how correct this coworker was. It was silly so I got very paranoid and we had a huge blowup and he said he mentions all of his coworkers the same I‚Äôm just paranoid because she‚Äôs female.

I told him about what I saw on his phone and since then he‚Äôs been even more reluctant with his phone.

He told me that he doesn‚Äôt talk to so many women out of respect for me. 

When we first started dating we would be out and he would look at other attractive women. I mentioned about my ex doing it and he stoped but this year it has started up again. We‚Äôve had two blow up incidents where he denies it.

Then I‚Äôve been doing his website for his business as he isn‚Äôt tech savvy . I logged onto his laptop yesterday and then  saw his Instagram was on and said let me look  through it. 

There he is trying to set coffee dates all year with this woman and countless knows how many others. She‚Äôs married. It seems friendly but he has never mentioned  trying to meet up with her. He mentions other less attractive female friends and any failed meetups. He talks about all his male friend meet-ups. Strange his attempts to meet her have never been mentioned. 

Okay whatever they never met up but then he‚Äôs never ever added me on Instagram or any social media. He knows I have an Instagram but never asked if I wanted to be added, but he sure as hell adds every very attractive woman that he knows. The waitress that serves him coffeee he has on there and checks in with her. He hearts women‚Äôs stories. I post WhatsApp stories he has never hearted one of mine! Never responds to videos I send him. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll tell me they‚Äôre all his friends. 

One time we watched a tv show where a couple won a the woman was a beautiful mixed race woman ( a type my partner likes) and he hoped straight on Instagram to follow her and send her a message about a business propsal(he didn‚Äôt have a concrete one at the time and the industries they‚Äôre in are night and day) he also messaged her boyfriend. 

He tells me that he used to talk to beautiful women because he is very insecure and not to sleep with them but it gave him validation.

He‚Äôs still doing that now just in a more sneaky way. Claiming they‚Äôre friends or he as business proposals but really why do all the women happen to be super beautiful? 

He‚Äôs not sending business proposals  to unattractive  women.

I look at it and it looks small and maybe nothing has happened. Maybe I‚Äôm overreacting but I don‚Äôt feel special. I feel off. Am I overreacting by wanting to breakup ",0,1759765769.0,AmIOverreacting,2,0.5,False

Daddy is very excited so I think we can assume our favorite Societal Alpinist is going to have a very good night tonight. The curtains are drawn and the room is only lit by a single gas lamp but I don‚Äôt think he's gaslighting anyone this is genuine excitement in his voice, and they unveil a tiny little model of the train station that he fought so hard for it widowed Mrs. Stinkface. His speech is very misogynistic because its 1882 and he's only talking to the men in the room, even though his wife and daughter are there. So then Daddy turns down the gas lamp and motions to his swag plundering architect to flip the switch on the battery that keeps randomly buzzing throughout this scene (probably because he's a fan of technology but also doesn't want to get deaded by it?) so Mr. White flips it and the cute little model that he even added lights up and this room of white men (plus Bertha and Gladys) goes fucking wild. So they open the curtains and damn those are some quality blackout shades because its like high noon outside and we turn to My Girlie Gladys, her brother Curls, and Mr. White and My Girlie is like ""you really think now is a good time to tell Daddy you don't want to be a nepo baby?"" and Curls is like ""he's in such a good mood he probably won't even realize what I am telling him until tomorrow or something"" and Mr. White is like ""this plan seems half baked, but it's worth a shot"" so Railroad Daddy comes over and is like ""Mr. White your little diorama has me so turned on that if my wife wasn't here I'd pull you into the closet"" and the SA pops over and is like ""I heard that and you will be well looked after tonight"" then Curls clears his throat and is like ""ok your kids are here, but I will ignore that since I need something. So I think Mr. White's diorama is pretty neat and I want to dedicate my life to making my own!"" and RD is like ""but I have cleared the way so you could benefit from nepotism"" and then Mr. White is like ""well I think he just wants to have another string to his bow? you know to like aid your business with knowledge of yet another trade"" and Curls stupidly is like ""no, that's not what I mean, I want to build a new and completely separate bow"" and Mr. White is thinking *this fucking idiot will flame out in under a year he's so stubborn* and I am thinking that kind of stubbornness would make him well suited to someone we know. So RD is like ""I am going to get the women away from here so the sausage fest can truly begin, do your fucking job with a smile on your face nepo baby"" and he whisks My Girlie away.

On the cozy side of 61st Agnes is still in the midst of last week's crash out over Oscar being seen cavorting with the Troublemaker. Spinster sister is like ""is it really that big a deal? all men have flings! at least its not a hooker"" so then Bannister comes in and asks what time she wants her dinner and she's still crashing out over him cheating on her for $100 from the Russells so she tells Ada to tell Bannister to tell Mrs. Gambler what time she wants dinner.

Back at Russell Evil Incorporated, Railroad Daddy is ushering his women folk to the carriage and the Societal Alpinist is like ""that was hella cool! when can this electricity thing benefit me personally though?"" and he's like ""well Thomas Edison is like having a big party to mark the opening of his first plant and I am invited, but once this station is built everyone will probably have electricity"" and the SA is like ""I was totally asking when we could have it in the house, but now you are invited to this party i need to flip this in to societal gains too!"" and RD is like ""oh speaking of that Clay and I have a date with the lawyers so don't wait up"" and the SA is like ""well you snapped at me last week for being uncaring so let me hold your hand and look you in the eye when I say we...like all of us together...will get through this"" and RD is like ""aww that's sweet, maybe you should wait up for me later if you know what I mean"" and my poor girlie Gladys is thinking *that's gross but also I want a love like my parents have.*

Back to the cozy side of 61st but downstairs this time and Bannister is looking at his big payday from the Russell's that nearly caused Agnes to implode in the street between houses. Mrs. Gambler is like ""what the fuck are you going to do with a check? we working class folks usually deal in cash and don't have bank accounts?!"" and Bannister is like ""I'll get one like I am going to get whoever the fuck set me up across the street! It is now my life's mission to find out who snitched on me""

In the street we see Curls walking...did he walk all the way home from Wall street? It's been a minute since I've been to New York but I remember that being petty far. Anyway he looks depressed enough that he just might have...anyway Little Miss Stubborn and the star of the show, Pumpkin, stroll up along side of him and she's like ""yo, what's wrong with you? you're looking a little glum"" and he's like ""I told my dad I don't want to be a nepo baby and he didn't take it very well"" and she's like ""you have to do what's best for you, not for him. Cheer up"" She leaves to feed Pumpkin which is more important and he goes home.

We enter Russell Manor but we are in the most boring servants hall of all time (I am so sorry Lord Fellowes, you know I love you and will follow you to the ends of the earth. These characters and their plots take away valuable time from the people I care about!!)  Housekeeper tells everyone that the mistress wants to make a fuss over the lighting ceremony that Railroad Daddy told her about, Troublemaker is being a bitch about it, Butler is trying to shut her up, Frenchie is excited, the Valet is being a pessimist, and then they discuss if this will be a big enough pull for Ward McAllister to hang out with Bertha again.

Upstairs in the ballroom, Caroline Astor, Jr. is freaking out about how grand it is. My Girlie Gladys is trying to be modest about it and is like ""do you think it'll work for our dance?"" and Carrie is like ""bitch, they are going to move Broadway to 61st and 5th, this ballroom is bigger than a theatre"" and My Girlie is like ""oh but we need more people than just the two of us and I don't know anyone"" and Carrie is like ""don't worry because I know ***everyone*** and they are all nosy and want to see this ballroom first hand, they wont believe me when I tell them how ridiculously grand it is"" and My Girlie is like ""oooh maybe we can ask your future husband?!"" and Carrie is like ""can I give him a date?"" and My Girlie is like ""oh, no I guess not"" and the Societal Alpinist who was obviously listening outside the door the whole time walks in and is like ""what? of course we can give him a date!"" and then she turns to Carrie and says ""I will invite all your parents, especially your mother Carrie, to join us for the ball! they will want to see your little performance"" and My Girlie's face sinks because she realizes this isn't about *her* debut into society...it's about *her mother's* debut into society.

Back at Russell Evil Incorporated, we're having the meeting Daddy mentioned earlier and he‚Äôs like ‚Äúwho has seen this proof that I am complicit in murder?‚Äù and Balding White Man #1 is like ‚ÄúI have it here, it seems legit.

Back on the cozy side of 61st we see Boy Cousin storming out of the house with such anger and speed that he opens and shuts (well, slams) the front door for himself. These rich folks love letting servants do menial tasks like holding the door open, so you know he's pissed. Marian goes into the drawing room and is like ""what is his deal?!"" and Agnes is like ""HE HAS BROUGHT SHAME AND DISHONOR TO THE NOBLE HOUSE OF VAN RHJIN!!!"" and Ada is like ""he's supposedly banging the upstarts maid"" and Marian is like ""shouldn't we be proud that if he's going to be a libertine that he's at least an equal opportunity one?"" and Agnes is like ""SHE MUST BE FIRED!!!"" and Marian is like ""oh this will give you a chance to be friendly with Mrs. Russell!"" and Agnes is like ""why would I be friendly with her when your stubborn ass wanted to defy me and be friendly with her yourself...and before you try to get stubborn again and say no, if you want this roof to stay over your head you'll learn to recognize an order when it is given to you""

Downstairs Jack is like ""YO!!! I was on door duty upstairs when the mistress and her son got in a screaming match and then he had a tantrum and wouldn't even let me do my job!"" and the Bigoted Lady's Maid is smiling because she knows she's caused all of this and she loves to sow chaos, in an effort to sow some more she's like ""sucks that none of you know what the fight was about"" and she strides out of the servant's hall clouded in mystery.

[The kid LIVES for gossip.](https://i.redd.it/g5rd4s45hitf1.gif)

Across the street, Daddy is home and he's eating dinner in the dining room alone. The Societal Alpinist comes in and is like ""I was just relaxing in my private sitting room while still wearing this large bustled dress and all my jewels with my hair pinned up so neat even though it's super late and I should be getting ready for bed when they told me you were being a dandy and having 4 footmen serve you dinner in the dining room alone!"" and RD s like ""yeah I told them to tell you I was here so I would have someone to chat to and look less like a dandy"" so then he tells her what Balding White Men 1 and 2 were telling him and Mr. Smooth Voice and the SA's dumbass is like ""you can't go to prison?! I am making my debut into society!!"" and he's like ""oh I am glad Gladys is finally to come out"" and she's like ""no babe, ME!!! THIS IS ABOUT ME!!!"" and he's like ""are we going to have this fucking fight again?! we did this last week! GET YOUR PRIORITIES STRAIGHT!!!""

Its the next day and we're on a trolly car with Pretty Peggy who is going to *The Globe* to turn in her next article. When Mr. Fortune arrives he's like ""hey do you want to write about electricity?"" and she's like ""oh you mean the light show that Mr. Edison is putting on!"" and he's like ""just so you know a black man named Mr. Lewis Latimer came up with technology that took Edison's concept from in process to complete"" and she's like ""so we are going see a ceremony recognizing him too"" and they both look at each other with the look Black people share when they know white people are going to be predictable.

Back on 61st, Little Miss Stubborn is not being stubborn and doing what she was told, namely asking the Societal Alpinist to fire the Troublemaker. They enter the drawing room and there is a footman pouring tea or coffee or something and the SA dismisses him and while you only get a brief glimpse of this guy's profile I am wondering if one of the requirements for hire at Russell Manor is to be impossibly attractive? Like if I was Gladys I would be a MENACE with all these hot footman running around the house, goddamn. Anyway, so to her credit LMS doesn't pussyfoot about the point and flat out says ""My aunt wants you to fire your made because she thinks she's a floozy"" and the SA is like ""ok but I need proof? do you know how hard it is to find help?"" and LMS is like ""all I know is someone saw her getting too close and too familiar with someone who is part of the 1%"" and the SA is like ""ok I'll think about it but I wanted to ask you if it's ok that I invite your boyfriend to a party but I can't invite you because I only have one seat left since your Girl Cousin is making me invite some rich illegitimate daughter"" and LMS is like ""oh, that sounds like fun but I am not at all jealous"" with a very jealous face.

Downstairs the Butler is very exasperated trying to explain to some of the footmen what their role for this picnic party to see the birth of electricity is, the hottie from upstairs isn't one of them but these guys aren't terrible looking so my point of attractiveness being a qualifier for employment still stands. Anyway they break into a moment where the senior staff bicker at each other but as we established last week, I think the Russell manor senior staff drama is so fucking boring (again Lord Fellowes, I love you so much but I don't know how you could follow up the complexity of the Downton downstairs with *this*.)

Outside Marian is crossing the street to head home when standing outside of her house is the Unstable Shyster. She's excitedly like ""what the fuck are you doing here! how risky!"" and he's like ""oh I come here often hoping to get a glimpse of you like and absolute creep, but the hope is if I love bomb you enough that you'll run away with me"" and she's like ""well I went to Mrs. Chamberlain's home museum of fine art and insane hats last week and she told me we could like meet up there to make a plan"" and he's thinking *fuck yeah!!!! this is getting me closer to my goal of getting laid!* but he says ""oh wow! you are willing to take such a risk for me! it must be love!!!""

In Daddy's study he's rustling through papers like he thinks he'll find salvation. The Societal Alpinist pops in and is like ""oh my god! Marian Brook came over and said that Agnes Van Rhijn wants me to fire Turner because she's hooking up with a toff"" and RD is like ""HOW DID SHE FIND OUT ABOUT THAT?!"" and the SA is like ""errr, I think it's her son?"" and RD is like ""oh, heh yeah she probably has way more eyes on her son than on anyone else, speaking of him he wrote me to say that he's my friend no matter what happens about the crash inquiry"" and she's like ""I can't believe anyone would think that you the powerful almighty Railroad Daddy would have anything to do with a little underling like that"" and he's like ""well I do talk to the poors from time to time so that they can see me as more than just a robber baron, but I doubt the judge and jury will see me that way"" and she's like ""well we will just pretend like everything is just fine and under no circumstances are we to make changes to our social calendar!""

[know what Daddy?](https://preview.redd.it/boff208jhitf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=15bc7dd0d1bdf3106f57837d84e66445cfbf1237)

On the cozy side of the street Oscar has decided to concede to his mother and apologize for having an affair with the maid across the street, probably because he feels like it would be less scandalous than her knowing the truth about his extra curriculars. He confides in Marian that its not true (but not the rest of it) and then he quips about how his mother loves him but somehow believes that only she knows what is best for him, something that also describes Marian's relationship with Agnes so I think this is the first moment where we see Oscar and Marian fall into a relationship that makes them as close as siblings would be.

Back across the street, the Societal Alpinist is about to go upstairs when she spies the Troublemaker and Curls chatting in a very flirty manor (do we think this is just because they are both flirts? we all know that Larry could find chemistry with a houseplant. or is it if she had stayed in the house Curls was going to be her next mark?) anyway she strokes his arm the same way she stroked Oscar's arm giving the Bigoted Lady's Maid ammunition to snitch, and Mommy is NOT AMUSED. So we follow he upstairs and she waits until her look is complete...like what a tragedy it would turn out to be if she had to put the necklace on for herself!!! so then the SA is like ""you know what? I think I want a new maid now"" and the Troublemaker is like ""but Daddy promised I could keep my job!"" and Bertha is so smart but it amazes me how obtuse she is when her husband and maid have done a really bad job at hiding what happened, so she's like ""Well he made me promise to at least give you a good reference""

[it occurs to me she never told George about this.](https://i.redd.it/caxb7p4nhitf1.gif)

We see a letter being delivered to the cozy side of 61st, Agnes who is the Mistress of Stubbornness is still not talking to Bannister so she's still playing whatever the 1882 version of telephone is to find out when it came. When he leaves the room Ada turns to her sister and is like ""my god when are you going to let this go?!"" and Agnes is like ""have you met me? he'll have to blink first"" and Ada is like ""and we wonder why Marian is the way she is..."" Speaking of Little Miss Stubborn she pops in with a hat box in her hands and is like ""I just went to Bloomie's and it was AMAZING, I said the line about the shop being fancier than Doylestown a few weeks ago but that was just to Peggy so since you weren't there I will say it again"" and Agnes is like ""yeah, yeah, yeah. The upstart across the street has fired the floozy who seduced my son!"" and Marian is like ""I honestly did not think she would do it but you should thank her!"" and Agnes is like ""No."" and Ada is like ""but if she doesn't receive a reply she might like show up here"" just then Peggy comes in the room and Agnes is like ""Please use our bitchy voice to reply to this note""

[I am going to say that Agnes' middle name is Elizabeth so I can call her Petty Betty](https://preview.redd.it/doghecrqhitf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d532355e2b5fb00ba36fa05407ac05eff3439d5)

Its bedtime and we see the Troublemaker tiptoeing around Russell Manor on her last night there, this time she's fully clothed though. So she goes into Daddy's room and he's like ""bitch! Not again!!"" and she's like ""why did you have me fired!?"" and he's like ""I didn't and I told her to give you a reference so you wont starve?! you're welcome"" and she's like ""have you figured out your defense in the crash trash?"" and he's like ""you don't work here...why does that matter?"" and she's like ""you thought my seduction was just about sex and power, but it was really because I want you to thrive. I have no ambitions and I don't care about my position in society...I would have just made sure you were supported"" and he's staring at her because he knows that's definitely the opposite of his current marriage.

[if you watch closely you can see him get shook](https://i.redd.it/eq37jcavhitf1.gif)

It's the next day and we are at Mrs. Chamberlain's home museum of fine art and insane hats, the Unstable Shyster enters the room where Little Miss Stubborn and the Insane Hat Lady herself (sadly sans hat again since we are in her home) are waiting, she introduces herself and then immediate makes herself scarce since the whole point was this was supposed to be a lover's tryst. So they sit down and she's like ""I hear you are going to the big historical milestone light show"" and he's like ""yes we can sit together!"" and she's like ""there isn't room for me because Aurora is bringing friend"" and he's like ""Oh I have heard loads about this friend, she's apparently the secret love child of a millionaire and he pretends that she's his niece even though no one believes it"" and she's like ""but why is or hostess being ostracized for the same thing basically?!"" and he's thinking *because he's a man and men are allowed to get away with shit like this all the time* but he says ""oh well you just have to learn to get in with the right people"" and she's like ""like you seem to be?"" and he's like ""yes but that doesn't matter because I love you and I only want you so we better get on with this before my eyes begin to wander after all New York has to offer"" and before she can answer Insane Hat Lady Sans Hat comes in and is like ""luncher bunchers!""

We don't follow them into lunch because we are at Central Park with the Troublemaker and Boy Cousin. Oscar is like ""fuuuuuck! you had no clue this was coming?!"" and The Troublemaker is like ""no, I was so shocked I almost choked the bitch to death"" and he's like ""probably would have been easier for me if you did"" and she's like ""well its over now so I am just here to say goodbye to you, and I might cause some trouble for the Butler on my way out because I need the last laugh"" and he's like ""I honestly don't know how I will manage my big con without your guidance"" and she's like ""well they are finally letting Gladys debut, so you will see her at all the rich people parties, make her laugh and make her feel admired and she will be putty"" and he's like ""but they frightened off her little boyfriend"" and she's like ""I really doubt she will let that happen again, so you stick to the plan and you will win. You have to get in there before this bitch finds someone who would actually make a desirable husband"" and he's like ""ouch!""

[you don't deserve any compliments in this situation, sir.](https://i.redd.it/yikswuo3iitf1.gif)

As promised the Troublemaker's final act on 61st is making trouble for the Butler of Russell Manor. She has done this by writing a goodbye note to Bannister about the fact it was Church who ratted him out to Agnes. Bannister is pocketing the information, but he's definitely going to flip it into some revenge.

Back to Mrs. Chamberlain's home museum of fine art and insane hats and she's playing docent to her personal art gallery. They are right she's got some really cool shit because she's showing them Edgar Degas' sculpture *La Petite Danseuse de Quatorze Ans*, so Marian is like ""wow you're cool"" and Mrs. C is like ""yes well let me repeat the advice I told you last time since your boyfriend wasn't here then"" she then turns and looks squarely at the Unstable Shyster because I think she's with the rest of us thinking this guy ain't shit and says ""being cast out of society sucks really bad, I am fine with it because I experienced real love and happiness and those memories sustain me now...don't throw your life away because you're horny"" and she goes back to leaving them alone and he decides he's not going to listen to her in that moment and is like ""hey stubborn girl, lets just get married!"" and the two idiots make out because they're horny.

[this girl really needs to learn the difference between being in love and just not being bored](https://i.redd.it/ucyepdy9iitf1.gif)

We are at the dressmakers and Agnes is getting fitted. The seamstress is trying to give her fashion advice and Agnes is like ""what on earth makes you think I am interested in your opinion, did I ask?"" and Spinster Sister thinks *well if she's already agitated we can have this conversation now I guess* so she's like ""Hey sis, when you said you would cut our niece off if she married the shyster...did you mean it?"" and Agnes is like ""do you mean to tell me she's still seeing this idiot after I have warned her multiple times that he's going to ditch her for more shiny objects?"" and Ada is like ""no! or at least I don't think so...what if you are wrong about him?"" and Agnes is like ""you are the only living person who has known me since childhood...how often have I been wrong about people? I won't her off if she marries him but she won't marry him because he's a feckless little social climbing turd. I bet the lives of everyone in this room on that""

At the offices of Russell Evil Incorporated, Railroad Daddy is once again trying to find a way to save his own ass when Curls comes in for a visit who proves once again that no one in this family knows how to time their moment properly. So he's like ""I want to be a real boy! and that means I am going to be an architect!!!"" and Daddy is like ""I shouldn't have let you watch them build our fancy house"" which seems like yet another plot hole because wasn't Larry at Harvard in the years they were building the house? also in the first episode he seemed SO INDIFFERENT to the new house, his mother asked him what he thought of the house and his response was ""if you could call it that"" or something along those lines? How is this man suddenly so interested in architecture? Anyway Curls is like ""look you are Railroad Daddy and at this point I am just Train Baby? I want to do something that isn't in your shadow so I can be the daddy of something myself!"" and RD is like ""then who will take over this business?"" and Curls is like ""you'll hire people? but you'll give them a smaller cut because I still want to be a spoiled rich kid and my sister needs a fortune so she can be hunted"" and RD is like ""you make good sound arguments, but your timing is terrible so can I go back to trying to save myself from jail please?""

[still picking the worst moment for this conversation](https://i.redd.it/hn3qgg4diitf1.gif)

The Gays of the Gilded Age are having their usual meet up at the pub and Oscar is telling Mr. Adams that he no longer has inside information on the Russells because his spy was fired and that she was fired because he let people believe they were lovers. John gives him a look like he's realized Oscar is morally bankrupt and this relationship isn't very healthy.

The next day at the cozy side of 61st, Marian tries to pretend like she had a random run-in with the Unstable Shyster and my spirit animal Agnes is like ""I can smell the bullshit"" and Ada is like ""oh they are old friends and they must've run into each other around town!"" and Agnes is like ""bullshit."" and Marian is like ""anyway! you'll be pleased to know that he's been in almost every drawing room in town, both old money and new...so a lot of your friends have received him and your other niece loves him!"" and Agnes is like ""Aurora seems to be hanging out with all the wrong people lately like she's turning into a slatternly socialite"" and Ada rolls her eyes, Marian pouts, and Agnes is like ""y'all are so blinded by he handsome face that you can't see it but I keep trying to tell you"" and Marian decides to go see what Peggy is doing probably so she could complain about Agnes, but when she finds Peggy she's got her hat on so she pouts more ""its going to be dark soon, you're going somewhere?"" and Pretty Peggy is like ""so I wasn't going to tell you because I knew you'd be a little jealous but I am going to see the lights"" and Marian is like ""well, you're wrong because I am not *a little* jealous. I am just the regular amount of jealous""

[Pumpkin is sick of this shit too.](https://preview.redd.it/4wbmi8qmiitf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=77e3e44edf450173028ce2118914e2a77300914e)

Quick detour across the street, and the Societal Alpinist is wearing a hat that would make Mrs. Chamberlain envious but also I am wondering why she would wear such a large fascinator to an event where people would need a good view? I mean *we* all know its not going to block anything but she doesn't know that because they don't know what to expect! anyway Daddy is leaving for his party and he tells her that everyone has arrived for hers. They have a moment where they seem in love and supportive of each other so I think Daddy is reflecting that he made the right choice.

Ada and Marian are excitedly talking about the event that will take place that night and Agnes is of course being a snob about it. They bicker but you see Marian thinking more and more about how bored she is in this house with these old ladies.

We finally get to the episode's big event and there is like a little band and everything seems so jolly! We pan over the crowd and no one is wearing a big showboaty hat like the Societal Alpinist...I wonder if the Troublemaker was still dressing her she would have suggested different headwear? but then again men are wearing top hats so i guess this isn't so different. Anyway they are in open top carriages and are having champagne when Anthropomorphic Ken marvels at the fact that Mr. McAllister's wife isn't always babysitting him or in his business and McAllister is like ""oh we have a very special arrangement where she gets to relax in Newport since she's not a city person and I can come to the city because I need to be where the parties are"" and then they start talking about the season in Newport...which should be just ending, no? We are currently in September. So the Societal Alpinist thinks this is an opportunity to climb more and says ""oh Newport sounds so fun, too bad I don't have any connection to it"" and McAllister is like ""mah dear, you have ME I will show you around!!!"" and the Fanes and her children are impressed with this new leap but the other two members of the party decide to slip into their own conversation so Ms. Bingham is like ""Oh Mr. Raikes, would you like to see Newport too? My mom has a huge fancy cottage up there! You should come visit it"" and Aurora is thinking *now wait a minute...I might be meek but I know a pick up line when I hear one*

[üé∂hello darkness my old friendüé∂](https://i.redd.it/xg7djvzqiitf1.gif)

Back to Marian's boredom for a brief second. Ada is doing her needlepoint and Agnes is asleep on the settee next to her, Marian puts her book down to go look out the window but there is probably nothing out because the whole of Manhattan is probably at the ceremony, she turns and stares at her aunts like she's decided to leave them.

Back to the ceremony but we are with all the Black people this time, they don't have fancy carriages with champagne but they do seem to have some cool food vendors and barrels of beer or something. Peggy is excitedly talking about what she learned on the beat while Mr. Fortune is trying to shuffle her closer to see the ceremony and he does so by putting his hand on her waist and she seems very excited by that...a little too excited by it seeing as he's married and her boss.

[insert Whoopi \\""you in danger girl\\"" gif](https://i.redd.it/jp0cvvauiitf1.gif)

The moment has arrived and Mr. Edison is accompanied by a gaggle of white men in top hats to the podium, one of those men is our very own Daddy and he tips his cap to his wife who swoons like Tai in the end of Clueless when she's watching Travis in the skater competition...Anyway Edison gets up on the podium and just waves to the crowd but doesn't say anything. So the announcer guy makes a lower motion with his hands which was telling everyone to shut up and also turn down the gas lamps. The light in the area reduces by like 80% so he gets back on his bullhorn and starts a countdown, and the crowd joins in and they seem so excited with anticipation, and when the flip is switched you really stop to wonder how amazing this moment really must have been. Like I can't think of any invention that has happened in my lifetime that has taken my breath away the way I could imagine this moment would've, but McAllister is like ""is time moving too fast?"" and our antagonizing protagonist is like ""I like it fast!""

[the gaggle is gagged](https://i.redd.it/1kmyyvawiitf1.gif)

It was messy and painful as fuck but eventually we decided not to speak anymore. I was furious at how he had treated me, but eventually came to a place of peace and hope for the future.

A couple weeks ago I texted his mom asking to leave something of his I had on the porch, and she said yes. She told him I was coming and to my surprise he was standing on the porch waiting for me. It was brief, but his mom and I chatted, and after hearing how he had been struggling I foolishly told her he could reach out to me if he needed me.

He did, we had coffee, we had sex, he told me he had regrets about breaking up. Long story short he ghosted me. I messaged him and called him like an insane person because all of the sudden the wound was reopened and I was spiralling about what happened. With still no response I showed up at his door and demanded an answer. We fought, then we kind of made up. A few days later we had really really great sex and I thought we could be casual and just quietly part ways after a really nice night together, knowing that both of us were on the same page about feeling like we need to stay out of contact since it‚Äôs not healthy. I wanted to send one last text saying ‚ÄúI really enjoyed the other night:)‚Äù, ya know, for the sake of aftercare, and nothing. No response a-mother-fucking-gain.

I know I‚Äôm doing it to myself by expecting something different from someone who I know will let me down everytime. But I just wish someone who I‚Äôve known for years, who knows the pain I‚Äôve endured because of him, would have a drop of care or respect to respond to a simple text after being intimate with me.

I wish I could just drop it and walk away from someone who treats me like I‚Äôm nothing, but the more he does it the more I feel like I need to prove why I deserve to not be treated like that.

In our time of no contact I was doing so good, and since he‚Äôs reentered my life these old anxious patterns have resurfaced and I feel like shit. How could he be so cold and uncaring towards me after everything‚Ä¶",6,1759765393.0,BreakUps,9,0.88,False

1nzmd03,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/1nzmd03/you_want_me_to_follow_the_handbook_fine_lets_do/,"You Want Me to Follow the Handbook? Fine, Let‚Äôs Do That.","Back when I was working as an operations coordinator for a mid-sized logistics company, I had a manager who was obsessed with *the handbook*. This handbook was a 78-page document filled with outdated procedures, irrelevant policies, and contradictions that had never been updated since the company was founded nearly two decades ago. Most of us only used it as a last resort, since in reality, the company had evolved and we‚Äôd adopted far more efficient processes over time, but the handbook hadn‚Äôt caught up.

Enter my manager, Greg. Greg had just been promoted into the role, and he was hell-bent on proving his worth. One of his first mandates? Everything we do must follow the handbook to the letter. We tried explaining that several of the procedures had been unofficially streamlined and approved by higher-ups, but Greg didn‚Äôt want to hear it. If it‚Äôs not in the handbook, we‚Äôre not doing it, he said in nearly every meeting that month.

So, I complied.

That Friday, we had a big shipment of medical supplies scheduled for a high-priority client. Normally, we use a digital manifest system that was developed in-house, quick, accurate, and required by the client due to compliance needs. However, the handbook still listed the *manual manifest form*, which involved printing and handwriting a carbon copy. It hadn‚Äôt been used in years.

Greg walked by my desk while I was preparing the digital manifest and barked, Hey, that‚Äôs not the form in the handbook. I explained that this was the system we‚Äôve used for the last three years, but he cut me off. Follow the handbook. No exceptions.

Okay, Greg.

I went back to my desk, printed out the outdated manual manifest form, and began filling out all 72 items in the shipment by hand. It took over an hour. Then I made copies, as the form required, and filed them exactly as the handbook directed. I also used the older shipping labels mentioned in the manual, which lacked the newer barcodes our clients scan to track the shipments in real-time.

The shipment went out right on time. Greg seemed quite proud of himself when he saw the forms clipped neatly to the shipment log.

That lasted until Monday.

At around 9:15 AM, I got an email from our client‚Äôs compliance officer. She couldn‚Äôt scan any of the shipments into their system, and she was demanding to know why we‚Äôd suddenly reverted to manual manifests. The tracking data was missing, and her company couldn‚Äôt verify the delivery had even happened. We were now technically in breach of our service-level agreement. I forwarded the message to Greg.

About ten minutes later, he stormed into my office and asked, What the hell happened?

I shrugged and said, I followed the handbook. Exactly like you said. Page 43 covers shipment manifests. Then I handed him the very form he told me to use, now coffee-stained and smudged from its trip in the truck cab. Would you like me to go back to the modern system, or should I keep following the handbook?

He didn‚Äôt answer. Instead, he walked out, and later that afternoon we got a company-wide email from Greg stating that until further notice, exceptions to handbook procedures are allowed with supervisor approval. He also asked me privately to send him a list of all procedures we‚Äôd updated over the years so he could consider revising the handbook.

It was a small win, but a satisfying one.

I set the timer for thirty seconds. At about twenty, it exploded like a firecracker. Pieces of egg hit the ceiling. The smell was instant. Burnt sulfur mixed with sadness. Everyone came running thinking something caught fire.

My boss walked in holding his coffee, looked at the mess, and just said ‚Äúwho microwaved a bomb.‚Äù The entire kitchen smelled like fart for the rest of the day.

1nzmcme,https://www.reddit.com/r/PortervilleFraud/comments/1nzmcme/the_porterville_social_club_mixer_concept_meet/,The Porterville Social Club Mixer Concept: Meet New People in Porterville. No Pressure.,"I see the problem of meeting new people to be two fold. I am not looking for a job - not part of anyone's agenda, I am not looking to be sold to or solicited for anything - too poor to care, not gonna make your ass rich, I am not looking for any political or religious bullshit - your book clubs suck, chomos. So the intent of socializing in this town has become very compartmentalized the way I see it and it is good that people want to break away from all of these molds and boredom and figure something out to not live and die of a lonely life and existence in a town thats been colonized for 170 years of hate bigotry and racism, control. There is always time to figure out more and execute it.

  
Based on the analysis of the thread, the best solution for a large singles event in a town like Porterville needs to address the specific pain points and desires expressed by the users. The goal isn't just to throw a party; it's to create a sustainable model for low-pressure social connection.

Here is a comprehensive solution, broken down into a step-by-step plan:

# The Core Concept: ""The Porterville Social Club Mixer""

This name is crucial. It uses the popular idea from the thread (""singles club"") but softens it with ""Social Club"" and ""Mixer"" to reduce the pressure of explicit dating. The marketing should emphasize:¬†**""Meet New People in Porterville. No Pressure. No Pokemon Cards.""**

# Phase 1: Foundation & Planning

**1. Assemble a Founding Group:**

* Use the Reddit thread as a starting point. The OP (`Catladyindread`),¬†`pacodefan`,¬†`moreno85`, and other engaged commenters are your ideal founding members. Create a private Reddit chat or a simple WhatsApp/GroupMe to start planning.
* **Strength:**¬†This core group already has buy-in and understands the problem firsthand.

**2. Define the Event's Vibe & Rules:**

* **Vibe:**¬†Casual, conversational, and activity-focused. It's a ""social mixer,"" not a speed-dating event.
* **Key Rules:**
   * **Age-Focused:**¬†Clearly state the target age range (e.g., 40-55). This manages expectations and prevents the ""shoot your shot"" dynamic from the thread.
   * **No Pressure:**¬†The goal is to meet people and make friends. Romantic connections are a possible bonus, not the sole purpose.
   * **Vested Interest:**¬†Charge a small fee ($10-$20 per person). As the OP said, this ensures attendees are serious. The fee covers costs and prevents no-shows.

**3. Choose the Perfect Venue:**  
This is the most critical logistical step. The casino and bars are out. You need a neutral, affordable, and conducive space.

* **Top Choices:**
   * **A Community Center or Legion Hall:**¬†This is the ideal choice. It's affordable, neutral, and can be configured flexibly. You can bring your own food and drinks.
   * **A Local Restaurant's Private Room:**¬†Approach a restaurant that isn't a rowdy bar. A pizza place, a family-owned Italian restaurant, or a quiet pub could work. Negotiate a minimum spend instead of a room fee.
   * **A City Park Pavilion:**¬†For a daytime, picnic-style event, this is cheap and cheerful. The ""activity"" is built-in (e.g., lawn games).

# Phase 2: Structure & Execution (The Event Itself)

The structure is designed to avoid awkwardness and force mingling in a fun way.

**1. Check-in and Mingling Starter:**

* As people arrive, give them a name tag (first name only).
* Have light refreshments (coffee, tea, water, simple snacks) available immediately.
* Use¬†**conversation starter cards**¬†on the tables. Questions like: ""What's the best thing you've eaten in Porterville?"" or ""What's a hobby you've always wanted to try?""

**2. The ""Roving Table"" Activity (The Main Event):**

* Set up tables for 4-6 people.
* Every 15-20 minutes, a facilitator rings a bell. The rule is:¬†**""Everyone must find a new table with no one they've spoken to yet.""**
* This prevents people from getting stuck in one conversation and ensures everyone meets a large portion of the group. It's structured mingling that does the hard work for them.

**3. Optional, Low-Pressure Group Activity:**

* Instead of just talking, have a simple, optional group activity.
   * **Trivia:**¬†Divide into teams. This builds camaraderie.
   * ""Two Truths and a Lie"" at each table.
   * A simple craft or collaborative puzzle.
* This gives people something to¬†*do*¬†together, which is often easier than just talking.

**4. Wind-Down and Next Steps:**

* End the formal activities with an announcement like: ""For those who'd like to continue chatting, we'll be here for another 30 minutes informally.""
* Have a way for people to express interest in a¬†*next*¬†event without pressure. A simple poll: ""Would you be interested in a future event like a group hike, game night, or potluck?""

# Phase 3: Marketing & Logistics

**1. Leverage Existing Platforms:**

* **Reddit:**¬†Post the event details prominently on r/Porterville. The ""Citizen"" flairs will add credibility.
* **Facebook:**¬†Create a Facebook Event and share it in local community groups (e.g., ""Porterville Talk,"" ""Porterville Community Board""). This is where you will reach the non-Reddit crowd.
* **Local Bulletin Boards:**¬†Post physical flyers at the library, grocery stores, and community centers.

**2. The Registration Process:**

* Use a simple platform like¬†**Eventbrite**¬†or a Google Form. This manages the headcount and collects the small fee upfront.
* The registration form should reiterate the age range and the social (not purely romantic) nature of the event.

**3. Budget & Supplies:**

* **Income:**¬†Registration fees (e.g., 20 people x $15 = $300).
* **Expenses:**¬†Venue rental ($100-$150), basic refreshments ($100), supplies (name tags, etc.) ($50). Any leftover funds become seed money for the next event.

# Why This Solution Works for Porterville:

* **Solves the ""Where?"" Problem:**¬†It actively avoids the disliked venues (casino, bars) and creates a new, dedicated space.
* **Reduces Pressure:**¬†The ""Social Club"" framing and activity-based structure makes it accessible to those who are weary of the traditional dating scene.
* **Builds on Expressed Desire:**¬†It directly implements the ""singles club"" idea that multiple commenters supported.
* **Manages Expectations:**¬†The age range and fee filter the audience to exactly the people the OP wanted to meet.
* **Creates a Model for the Future:**¬†If successful, ""The Porterville Social Club"" can become a recurring institution, solving the long-term problem of social isolation for this demographic. The next event could be a group trip to a Fresno event, a potluck, or a game night, fulfilling the desire for varied social outlets.",1,1759764804.0,PortervilleFraud,0,1.0,False

1nzm7u2,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1nzm7u2/blame_it_on_the_alcohol/,Blame it on the Alcohol,"Fox had a gift. He could talk his way into any room, charm the pants off any crowd, and freestyle wisdom like it was jazz. He was the kind of man who could turn a barbershop debate into a TED Talk, then flip it into a stand-up set without missing a beat. But his Achilles heel came in a bottle, usually brown, sometimes clear, always trouble. When the liquor hit, Fox turned from philosopher to chaos conductor.

Last Friday night was peak Fox. He‚Äôd stumbled into the Comedy Cut Lounge wearing snakeskin boots, a crushed velvet blazer, and a grin that could melt steel. The DJ dropped that track‚Äî‚ÄúBlame It on the Alcohol‚Äù‚Äîand Fox took it as gospel. Shots turned into sermons, and before long, he was on stage, roasting the wrong crowd: the Delacroix family, old money with new grudges.

‚ÄúThey should have never gave y‚Äôall money‚Äù he slurred at the youngest son, who looked like a hedge fund and smelled like entitlement. ‚ÄúIf you had a couch I would step on it like Ricky James did Eddie Murphy!‚Äù

Laughter erupted. So did the Delacroixs.

The patriarch, Vincent Delacroix, didn‚Äôt take kindly to public humiliation. He was the kind of man who believed in legacy, control, and revenge served cold with a side of litigation. But his sons were more impulsive. By midnight, Fox was sprinting through alleyways, dodging Range Rovers and revenge. He leapt over trash cans like hurdles, ducked into bodegas, and even tried hiding in a church confessional‚Äîuntil the priest recognized him and said, ‚ÄúFox, you better confess to more than just bad jokes.‚Äù

He tried to call his cousin Rico for a ride, but Rico was still mad about the time Fox drunkenly crashed his engagement party and told the bride‚Äôs father he looked like a retired pimp. No help there.

Fox ended up in a laundromat, curled behind a row of dryers, sipping flat soda from a vending machine cup and wondering how his life had turned into a low-budget action comedy. His snakeskin boots were scuffed, his blazer torn, and his pride somewhere between the gutter and the grave.

By dawn, he was curled up on a park bench, shoes gone, dignity missing, and a raccoon eyeing his last granola bar. The city was waking up around him‚Äîjoggers, dog walkers, baristas prepping for the morning rush. Fox stared at the sunrise like it owed him answers.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired of blaming it on the alcohol,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúTime to blame it on myself.‚Äù

He stood up, brushed off the night, and walked toward the corner caf√© where they served redemption in black coffee and second chances. The barista, a woman named Nia with eyes like storm clouds and a voice like vinyl, raised an eyebrow when she saw him.

‚ÄúRough night?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúRough life,‚Äù Fox replied. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm thinking of switching genres.‚Äù

She poured him a coffee, no cream, no sugar‚Äîjust the truth. He sipped it slowly, letting the bitterness burn away the fog. Around him, the caf√© buzzed with quiet ambition: students cramming, artists sketching, hustlers plotting their next move. Fox felt like he was watching a world he‚Äôd been too drunk to join.

He pulled out a notebook, one he usually used for punchlines and pickup lines, and started writing something different. A plan. A promise. A blueprint for sobriety, or at least survival.

Step one: Apologize to Rico.
Step two: Stay out of the Velvet Lounge.
Step three: No more suits made of regret and whiskey.

Fox wasn‚Äôt naive. He knew the Delacroixs might still want blood, or at least a public apology and a donation to their favorite charity. But he had something stronger than liquor now‚Äîclarity. And maybe, just maybe, the next time someone played that song, he‚Äôd dance sober.

Later that week, he showed up at Rico‚Äôs garage with a six-pack of sparkling water and a handwritten apology. Rico stared at him like he was a ghost.

‚ÄúYou serious?‚Äù Rico asked.

‚ÄúDead serious,‚Äù Fox said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done being the punchline.‚Äù

Rico nodded slowly. ‚ÄúYou still owe me a new sound system.‚Äù

‚ÄúAdd it to the list,‚Äù Fox said.

They sat on the curb, sipping water and watching the sun dip behind the skyline. Fox felt something shift‚Äînot dramatic, not cinematic, but real. A quiet pivot toward something better.

He still had the charm, the wit, the rhythm. But now he had a filter. A pause button. A sense of consequence.

Fox wasn‚Äôt perfect. He‚Äôd slip, stumble, maybe even fall again. But he‚Äôd stopped blaming it on the alcohol. And that, for a man like him, was the beginning of everything.

1nzm73k,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1nzm73k/does_waterdrop_wdpfal_replacement_alkaline_filter/,Does Waterdrop WD-PF-AL Replacement Alkaline Filter Improve Taste and Purity? Full Review,"Waterdrop WD-PF-AL Replacement Alkaline Filters Review  

**Compact Design and Build Quality**  
During unboxing the Waterdrop WD-PF-AL Replacement Alkaline Filters, I was immediately impressed by their compact design paired with sturdy materials. These filters have a sleek appearance and fit effortlessly into my Waterdrop filtration pitcher without hassle. They are constructed with activated carbon, resin, alkaline material, and carbon fiber‚Äîmaking them durable and efficient. It feels like a thoughtful design for people who care about both aesthetics and practicality. The filters are lightweight at just 1.3 pounds, so handling and installation don‚Äôt feel like a chore. Even my clumsy attempts after spilling coffee mid-task went smoothly!  

**Strong Filtration Performance**  
Performance-wise, the Waterdrop alkaline filters are top-notch. Featuring a six-stage filtration process, they manage to significantly reduce impurities like chlorine, fluoride, heavy metals, and odors from tap water. Testing the water post-filtration, I could taste the noticeable difference‚Äîit‚Äôs cleaner and much crisper. According to the product's testing certifications, they even add back essential minerals such as zinc, calcium, and magnesium. I‚Äôve had other filters before, but few match this one in transforming ordinary tap water into alkaline water with a pH of 8.0‚Äì9.5. It‚Äôs refreshing to drink water knowing it‚Äôs both healthy and enjoyable!  

[Explore Waterdrop WD-PF-AL Replacement Alkaline Filters now on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b096xrty3m/)  

**Improved Coffee Experience**  
For coffee enthusiasts like myself, here‚Äôs the kicker: these filters refine the flavor of your morning brew. With their ability to smooth out the acidity, they create a richer and more balanced coffee experience. I could sense the enhanced natural sweetness in every sip, making my home-brewed coffee rival some cafes. If a product can elevate my caffeine fix, it‚Äôs an instant win in my book. Whether it‚Äôs espresso or just a regular cup, it‚Äôs truly a delightful change.  

**Highlights**  
- Sophisticated and compact design is compatible with various Waterdrop pitcher filtration systems.  
- Advanced 6-stage filtration removes heavy metals, chlorine, and impurities while adding back vital minerals.  
- Easily boosts water alkalinity to a pH range of 8.0‚Äì9.5 for health-conscious individuals.  
- Fast flow rate ensures no bottlenecks while pouring filtered water, with minimal waiting time.  

**Minor Critiques**  
Though I loved the product, it‚Äôs not entirely perfect. There are a few aspects that could use improvement:  
- The compatibility list is comprehensive but specific only to Waterdrop pitcher models. It leaves users with non-Waterdrop pitchers out of luck.  
- While effective, the filters last for just about 100 gallons, which requires frequent replacements for households with high water consumption.  
- Advanced filtration may mean a slightly higher price tag than some generic filters.  

**Peer Products**  
Comparing the Waterdrop filters to Brita and PUR filters revealed some differences. Brita has a broader compatibility range across various pitchers but lacks the advanced alkalinity-boosting features seen in the Waterdrop model. Meanwhile, PUR filters share decent impurity removal, though they fall behind on introducing healthy minerals back into filtered water. Waterdrop dominates with better coffee-enhancement perks and a faster flow rate compared to both rivals. However, budget-conscious buyers might gravitate towards the lower-cost Brita alternatives. Here, it boils down to whether health perks and advanced features are worth the higher spend.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
Are these filters worth the investment? Honestly, for what they offer, they truly are. Their combination of superior filtration ability, health benefits, and improved taste enhancement adds excellent value. Despite slightly higher upfront costs, these filters deliver high-quality output over time. If you drink a lot of coffee or prefer your water purified to the highest standards, the tradeoff seems justifiable. The longevity of 100 gallons from one filter might not seem exceptional; however, with all the advanced filtration capabilities, I considered it worth every penny.

It‚Äôs still cooling, but the sound is totally new and a little unsettling. I‚Äôve checked the filter and it looks fine. Is this something I should be seriously worried about?","The coffee pot sound is a great description! We've heard that one before. When an AC makes a gurgling or bubbling noise, it's usually a sign of one of two things, and you're right, it's probably not a DIY fix you want to take on. To answer what the noise is:

1. **You're low on refrigerant.** This can cause the cooling coil to freeze up. As the ice melts, you get that weird noise as the air and water mix. A low refrigerant level means you have a leak somewhere, and an AC technician needs to find and fix it properly. Just topping it off does not fix anything.
2. **Air or moisture in the system.** If air gets into the refrigerant lines, it can cause those sounds. This is a big no-no for the long-term health of your unit.

Either way, you want a pro to check it out. They can hook up their gauges and diagnose the problem in minutes. Trying to DIY with refrigerant is a bad idea boss. You're dealing with pressurized gas, and it's a regulated substance. Better to have someone with the right gear and know-how take a look before it turns into a bigger, more expensive problem.

1nzm2dy,https://i.redd.it/u3tagkleeitf1.jpeg,"Employer took ¬£216 from my pay for equipment damage without telling me, what can I do?","Hi everyone,

I‚Äôd really appreciate some legal or ACAS-related advice about an issue with my employer.

I work as a barista in a privately owned coffee shop. When I received my September pay, I noticed it was lower than expected. After asking my manager, I was told that ¬£216 (¬£180 + ¬£36 VAT) had been deducted from my wages to cover the repair of a coffee grinder hopper.

The problem is ‚Äî I was never informed in advance or asked to agree in writing. The deduction was made without any notice, and I only found out when I saw the reduced amount. Later, my manager sent me a receipt for ¬£316, claiming it was for parts ‚Äúordered from Europe.‚Äù

However, here‚Äôs where it doesn‚Äôt add up:

	‚Ä¢	The grinder was damaged on 3rd September when I accidentally knocked off the hopper. I was told they‚Äôd check the cost and let me know if compensation was needed.

	‚Ä¢	I was off on the 4th, and when I came back on the 5th, the grinder was already repaired and working perfectly. So it‚Äôs unlikely that any replacement part from Europe was involved ‚Äî two days just isn‚Äôt enough time for that kind of delivery.

	‚Ä¢	The receipt they sent me doesn‚Äôt even match the damaged part ‚Äî it‚Äôs for a different model‚Äôs burr, not a hopper.

	‚Ä¢	The numbers don‚Äôt line up either: the invoice is ¬£316, but I was charged ¬£216.


I‚Äôve checked my employment contract and company policies, and there‚Äôs no clause authorising deductions for equipment damage.

I understand accidents can happen, and I‚Äôd be willing to discuss it fairly, but deducting money from my wages without notice or consent feels wrong. Based on what I‚Äôve read about the Employment Rights Act 1996, this might count as an unauthorised deduction from wages.

Can anyone confirm if that‚Äôs correct? Should I go straight to ACAS for advice or early conciliation? Also ‚Äî does having the receipt (for the wrong part) make their deduction invalid?

Any insight from legal professionals, HR people, or anyone who‚Äôs dealt with something similar would really help me.

Thank you in advance üôè

1nzm09w,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLettersRaw/comments/1nzm09w/dear_you/,Dear you,"Dear,

There aren‚Äôt many words that truly describe the way I feel about you. Half the time, I‚Äôm confused myself ‚Äî and honestly, it scares the crap out of me. Before you showed up, I thought I had it all figured out. Maybe I‚Äôd been lying to myself this whole time, because you‚Äôve unintentionally shown me how I really feel.

You came into my life in a pretty ordinary way, at least on the surface. The job was new, the people were new, and I was just trying to survive the chaos of finding my place amongst it all. But you‚Ä¶ you were the special part of all of this. You made it easy. You were open, kind, available. I try to reciprocate it in full, but your capacity for kindness is a little wild. That big goofy smile paired with a hint of gloom, that walk I can‚Äôt stop staring at ‚Äî instant connection. I ended up following you around like a lost puppy, so much so it became a joke: the ‚Äúwork couple.‚Äù

I was honestly worried about opening myself up to a friend like this again. The last one I placed my trust in did a lot of damage. But there was something about you that made that anxiety just disappear. You recognized my struggles without me saying a word and jumped into action. The generosity you showed without any expectation of reciprocation ‚Äî except maybe the morning coffee run ‚Äî was beyond measure. You didn‚Äôt even know me, yet you showed up for me like no one had before. That drew me to you ‚Äî your ability to simply give ‚Äî a quality I hadn‚Äôt seen in anyone but myself in a very long time.

Over the next year, we became inseparable. Countless hours spent working, on the phone, off work, gaming ‚Äî just beside each other. All along I kept telling myself I had a partner and that feeling anything for you would be wrong, that it could never work anyway. Physically, we‚Äôre not built for each other. The attraction would never be there‚Ä¶ or so I told myself. Yet we fit in every other way. So I pushed it down. But the curiosity and the want were always there ‚Äî what you‚Äôd feel like, smell like up close; what it would be like to crawl into bed with you after a long day; the back of your neck as we lay there.

We joke about saving water, but I‚Äôm not really joking anymore. I imagine what it would feel like to let you melt into me when you needed someone for comfort, the way you already give me comfort without even knowing it. This year I noticed something new ‚Äî you started fulfilling needs my partner hasn‚Äôt met for years. And you do it freely, just because you want to. Shit, there‚Äôs no pushing this down anymore.

You‚Äôre hesitant. It‚Äôs hard for you to share your feelings. But I love when you share your vulnerable sides ‚Äî I feel honoured when you open up to me. That‚Äôs why I show you so much of myself: I want you to know you‚Äôre completely safe to do the same.

I can‚Äôt deny my attraction to you anymore. I wanted you closer, so I begged you to move in ‚Äî without realizing I was sealing my own fate. I didn‚Äôt intend it, but after you moved in, I understood. I‚Äôd been lonely. My partner and our roommate weren‚Äôt like me ‚Äî or nice to me, for that matter. Having you move in was a breath of fresh air. Someone finally on my team. Someone with similar views who gave me space to grow.

Unintentionally, it became a little clique, and I‚Äôve been so okay with it. I love being available for you, and I love when you‚Äôre available for me. I want to be the person who brings you comfort and joy. In fact, I wish I brought you more. I lean on you more than you know, and I wish you‚Äôd lean on me a little harder.

You know how attractive you are ‚Äî and it‚Äôs so attractive on you. When I call you cute, handsome or stud, I mean it from the bottom of my heart. Your clothes fit you so well. I love that you let me pick things out for you. I won‚Äôt lie ‚Äî I pick clothes I want to see you in, and you look phenomenal in everything. You don‚Äôt know how much I want to take them off for you.

You tease me constantly, and I love it. I have to look away when you come out of the shower or I‚Äôll stare too long and daydream while you call me a weirdo. The way you look in a towel makes me want to rip it off you and take you to your room and show you how much I want you. When you roll your sleeves up and reveal those beautifully defined arms you think aren‚Äôt muscled enough, I want to dive into them like an Olympic pool.

The way you walk around in your grey sweatpants, commando, is almost too much. I have to resist every urge not to press myself against you just to see your reaction. You have no idea how badly I‚Äôd love for you to come up behind me, hug me, scoop me up, lay me in your lap. Maybe if I could just hold you, even a little, I‚Äôd settle down. Maybe if we could be even slightly intimate. But I‚Äôm used to not getting what I want.

Your cheeky smiles, your ‚Äúnothing phases me‚Äù attitude, your cute little bum, your gorgeous hair. Those eyes I get lost in constantly. God, I love your beard ‚Äî I hate when you shave it. You teach me constantly when we game, and you‚Äôre always invested in helping me do better. And it‚Äôs hot when you get hot. I don‚Äôt like seeing you upset, but something about it turns me on and makes me want to help you relieve that stress.

What really makes me blush is how much you love teasing me about it. You know how much I like you, and something about you just loves making me squirm. Maybe that‚Äôs our way of edging into forbidden territory ‚Äî territory I‚Äôd love to explore but am scared of because of the lasting impact. I crave your presence. I dream of you craving mine.

I think you‚Äôve noticed it lately ‚Äî the way I look at you is different than how I look at my partner. You have so much more of my affection, and love and I can‚Äôt even give it to you.

Your past partners have never treated you as you deserved. Yet you gave them so much of yourself, so much loyalty. I crave that for myself. I crave being able to give you the same respect. You deserve decency, love, admiration, grace, space, someone who will stand by you and help you up when you slip. I have all of that for you in droves.

I want to be the person who could right all those wrongs for you, who could show you that love ‚Äî especially with someone so like you ‚Äî can be freeing instead of confining. But I‚Äôm locked into the idea that having you in my life the way we are now is safer for both of us than risking something that could end with us never speaking again. And that would kill me.

Sometimes, and I hate admitting this, but I imagine it‚Äôs you when I‚Äôm with my partner, just so I can get off faster. It‚Äôs horrible, I know, but you‚Äôre so much more of what I want. You see me and know me so much more. It‚Äôs been undeniable for a while now.

I am head over heels for you. I need you. I want you as my person. And you‚Äôll never want me the way I want you. I think I can live with it, because my love for you outweighs my need to have you. I tell you how much I like you, how much I‚Äôd love to be your person. I joke about how oversexed you‚Äôd be ‚Äî but to you it‚Äôs all just friendly kindness and joking flirts. Maybe you do know, and maybe you‚Äôre scared because you‚Äôve lived your entire life one way. Or maybe you don‚Äôt want to make a move because you‚Äôre the type of person who won‚Äôt invade someone‚Äôs relationship. But god, I‚Äôd love if you did.

A deep part of me wishes you wanted me the way I want you, so we could grow together into the people we‚Äôre meant to be. I‚Äôd never pressure you ‚Äî you mean too much to me. But I can‚Äôt deny that I want us to be each other‚Äôs person‚Ä¶ and yes, to fuck each other‚Äôs brains out on the regular.

The relationship and connection we‚Äôve built over the last year is so valuable to me ‚Äî something I‚Äôd do anything to protect. You know this, but not the intensity of it. Lately I‚Äôve done nothing but wish you‚Äôd lean into me, let me be your pillar. I can handle it. I can handle so much. You have no idea what you do for me. And lately I‚Äôve realized the chapter of ‚Äúus‚Äù is one I want to last as long as possible in both our lives.

I need you. And though you‚Äôve never said it, I have a feeling you need me too. You are my best friend, and I love you so much there isn‚Äôt a damn thing I wouldn‚Äôt do for you.

I know this is sappy and all over the place, but it‚Äôs a direct reflection of what you do to my brain. You make me want better for myself. You make me want to be better for you. You remind me that being gentle and kind in a harsh world is still needed.

You may have come into my life in the most ordinary way, but my life has been anything but ordinary since. I can‚Äôt thank you enough.

God, I‚Äôm so screwed.

With love,

Incredibly clean for a natural, top work on both the greens and the roast. Great nose: a pronounced jasmine note with honey and citrus following. The palate doesn't disappoint either. The cup profile is very similar to the rose-forward Lot RNBN I had from BCR. I much prefer this lot to the RNBN. While that was a great bag, the acidity (though complex) was a bit lacking, and the tea-like body made the overall experience a tad underwhelming since the cup did not live up to the nose. This lot, however, has remedied that by a mile: bright, juicy, and acidic with a very light (but still tea-like) body to bring it all together. I'd definitely recommend giving this a try if you're on the fence. I might just get another bag; this is one of the better cups I've had this year from this side of the shore. Happy brewing! :)

I'm so incredibly tired. Not just ""didn't get eight hours"" tired, but that soul-deep, world-is-on-tilt exhaustion. The kind where sleep is free, but I feel like I'm standing outside the store with my pockets empty, watching everyone else stroll in and cash out. I'm desperate for the reset, but it just won't come.

Then there's her.

She's ""mine"" now, right? That's what the texts and the hand-holding and the promises imply. But every time I try to settle into that feeling, to believe I've finally found a safe harbor, a new red flag pops up.

It's the constant, casual endearments. Not just for her best friends, which I could handle. But ""honey,"" ""sweetheart,"" ""darling,"" ""lovs"" sprinkled like confetti over everyone in her circle: her coworkers, her ex's friends, the barista at her favorite coffee spot, the guy who fixes her bike. It's a running commentary in every group chat, every quick call.

It makes the ""mine"" feel less special. Like I‚Äôm getting the same five-star treatment everyone else gets, and the difference between me and the guy she ran into at the grocery store is just... the title.
And I know, I know. Maybe I'm being insecure. Maybe it's just how she talks. But after everything... after the times I've been the only one, only to find out I was just one in a rotation... I feel that familiar, sickening lurch. Is this another betrayal in slow motion? Am I investing my sanity and my time into a love that's fundamentally non-exclusive, emotionally speaking?

I can't take this ambiguity anymore. My gut is screaming, but my heart is whispering, ""Don't ruin this. She's different.""

Lord, save me from this cycle. I'm just so tired. I just want the free sleep and a clear-cut ""yours.""

Or they want to check pricing. But they can't skip ahead. Have to scrub through 2 minutes of features they don't care about yet. Too annoying. Bounce.

Or they have one simple question like ""does this work with Shopify?"" Video can't answer that. So they leave.

**That's what interactive video solves.**

Let people click to what they actually care about. Branch the video based on what they answer. Let them ask questions when they're stuck.

Stop making them sit through a presentation. Make it a conversation instead.

**So that's what this sub is for.**

Sharing examples of interactive demos. Good ones and terrible ones.

Talking about what actually converts vs what just sounds good.

Helping each other fix the ""tons of views, barely any signups"" problem.

Testing different tools and approaches. Whatever works.

If you're using Loom with CTAs, building something custom, or just wondering if this is even worth it - doesn't matter. You're welcome here.

**Few things:**

Self-promo is totally fine as long as you add context. ""Check out my tool"" with nothing else gets removed.

Be specific when asking for help. ""My demo sucks"" doesn't tell us anything. ""My demo gets 5k views but 2% conversion, I think people are getting confused at X part"" is useful.

If someone asks something you know about, help them out. We're all trying to figure this out.

**First question:**

What's your demo conversion rate right now?

I met someone at work six months ago. We clicked. I know how it sounds but it wasn't planned. My husband and I had been together for twelve years and things just felt stale. Dead bedroom for two years. We barely talked. I felt invisible.

When I finally worked up the courage to tell him, I was honest. Brutally honest. I sat him down and said I'd developed feelings for someone else and I needed time to explore what I wanted. My mom said I deserved to be happy. My sister said life's too short to stay in a dead marriage. They told me I was brave for being truthful instead of sneaking around.

My husband just stared at me. Then he asked if I'd already slept with this person.

I said yes. Once. But I told him didn't I? I could have kept lying but I chose honesty.

He asked me to leave. I said I needed time to think, not a divorce. I wanted space to figure out if the grass was actually greener. He said, ""You want me to wait around while you test drive your affair partner?""

I tried to explain that I was confused. That I needed to know what I really wanted before making any permanent decisions. That he should want me to be sure.

He told me to get out.

I stayed at my sister's place. My family rallied around me. They said he was being controlling. That I had every right to explore my feelings. My mom even offered to talk to him, to make him understand that modern relationships are complicated.

Three days later I started getting texts. Friends asking if it was true. Cousins sending me screenshots. My husband had posted everything to Facebook. Every detail. He wrote out our entire conversation word for word. He tagged mutual friends. He included the fact that I'd asked him to wait while I ""explored my options.""

My phone wouldn't stop buzzing. Our couple friends all picked sides. His side. Even my best friend from college called and said what I did was cruel. My coworker, the one I'd been seeing, suddenly got cold. Said he didn't realize I was still trying to keep my husband on standby. He blocked me.

My husband changed all the locks. Filed for divorce within a week. Told his family everything. His mom who used to call me her daughter won't even look at me at the grocery store.

I went to our usual coffee shop and the barista who'd known us for years wouldn't make eye contact. Someone had clearly told her.

My sister says he's being vindictive. That he couldn't handle my honesty so he had to destroy my reputation. My mom says we should sue him for defamation but my lawyer said truth is an absolute defense.

I've had to explain to my boss why I'm getting nasty messages at work. I've lost half my friend group. The other half tolerates me but things are weird now. I had to delete all my social media. I can't go to the gym we both went to. I switched grocery stores. I see people whispering when I'm out.

My family keeps saying he's the villain here. That he couldn't handle my truth so he tried to turn everyone against me. But I'm the one starting over completely. I'm the one who has to rebuild everything because he couldn't be mature about me needing space.

I just wanted to be honest about my feelings instead of lying for years. I gave him the truth and he weaponized it.

So am I actually in the wrong for telling him I needed time to figure out my feelings before making a permanent decision?

1nzlhte,https://www.reddit.com/r/virgin/comments/1nzlhte/why_i_couldnt_attach_romantically/,Why I couldn‚Äôt attach romantically?,"I thought I‚Äôd write this post because there‚Äôs a reasonable chance it may help others‚Ä¶ in short, if you‚Äôre like me, you may have been single for a very long time, or perhaps for your entire life? And wondering why one may have felt invisible, especially to the opposite sex. A lot of this is likely because of your attachment style.

This long write up pulls the main key points of attachment (as I saw them), and how childhood trauma may be an added component. 

A few years ago I had a major d-day realisation of my situation and I went into emotional shock for 5 months. I had to understand ‚ÄúHow did I get to this point?‚Äù‚Ä¶ I found many answers through Attachment Theory, which helped me grasp a new understanding. I‚Äôm now 55m and I wish I knew this stuff earlier in my life, because I could have made important changes that may have resulted in a full romantic life, marriage and children. 

With that‚Ä¶ grab a coffee and a muffin!!

PART 1:

Attachment theory is quite a big topic and I‚Äôll do my best to skim over it in enough detail for you to see what‚Äôs going on. Without knowing you, I'm going to take a wild guess that:

* You have a deep yearning for intimacy, but somehow you fear it at the same time.

* You are an extremely self-reliant person

* You may be a workaholic (or something else that you devote a lot of time to)

* You put other people's best interests above your own

* You may feel deep down that you are not good enough

* You may have a fear of commitment

* You go to great extents to avoid conflict 

* You have poor boundaries

* You may have people pleasing tendencies

* There's a deep sense of sexual shame

* You may be a perfectionist and a procrastinator

* You may find yourself pushing others away


If any of the above list rings true for you, then you likely have an avoidant attachment. The answers you seek are much deeper and you'll find most of them through attachment theory. All of the above list root back to the fear of abandonment and this would have happened in childhood, most likely before you were 4 years old. All of the above would have been subconscious and embedded in your autonomic nervous system and you wouldn't have realised you were doing them. 

Abandonment is a hard concept to grasp for many. So... what is abandonment?? If you can imagine a child growing up in a hospital, a nurse would attend to the child, the child would get attached and when the nurse left, the child will feel abandoned. Then the next day another nurse comes and the child gets attached and again, the nurse goes home at the end of the day and the child feels abandoned again. Imagine this happening over and over again‚Ä¶ the child learns that if they get attached, they will get abandoned, they cannot depend on the nurses and the child's autonomic nervous system starts protecting themselves against from getting attached in the first place. Hence you develop things like self-reliance, letting go of your own needs, fear of commitment, becoming a workaholic, etc... and the list goes on. 

There are 4 attachment styles, there is secure, dismissive avoidant, anxious preoccupied and fearful avoidant. The last one is more complex because it is called disorganised attachment in childhood, then develops into fearful avoidance in adulthood. Fearful avoidance is when your attachment is simultaneously at both opposites of the attachment spectrum, so one is both dismissive avoidant and anxious preoccupied. All of the above list were typical fearful avoidant traits and behaviours (and they are also collectively referred to as abandonment traits). It is extremely rare for an avoidantly attached person to become self aware because they think this stuff somehow doesn't apply to them. In which case they continue suffering and avoiding life for the rest of their lives.

Before going further‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd also like to recap the phases of child development. Our attachment forms pre-natal up until around 4 years old. From when you are born up to the age of 7 months, you are codependent (obviously). From 7 months to around 2 years old, you start becoming counter-dependant or oppositional. The child expresses ‚Äúno! This is mine!‚Äù This is where you learn a sense of self. I‚Äôm going to take a wild guess that this may not have fully developed with you‚Ä¶ that you are still struggling with who you are? You‚Äôve probably given so much of yourself away to others, that you don‚Äôt know who you are? 

Between 2 and 4 years old, the child starts becoming emotionally independent. From 7 years old and onwards, a child develops logic and reasoning. This is how we develop and understand that father Christmas is an impossibility. The reason I‚Äôm mentioning this is that our attachment is mostly formed by the time we are 4 years old. And the first system to get developed is the emotional system. If this development is compromised, then we will have difficulty emotionally attaching to others in adulthood. You‚Äôll typically find an avoidant is busy ‚Äúdoing‚Äù things/tasks/work/etc‚Ä¶ and those who have a secure attachment will typically be busy ‚Äúbeing‚Äù! They emotionally connect to others and they build a large network of people. And they realise they can depend on others to help them.

I‚Äôm also going to take a wild guess and that you were a quiet child? Perhaps you were very well behaved and possibly fearful of doing anything wrong?? This links back to the sense of self issue described above. 

What is the root of abandonment then? It is Childhood Emotional Neglect (CEN). If one has felt that something is missing, but they couldn‚Äôt put their finger on it? Then it is probably this? Emotional neglect is where you may have been able to talk to your parents about most things, except anything to do with ‚Äúfeelings‚Äù. The easiest way to explain emotional neglect is‚Ä¶. Suppose a child got bullied at school. When they come home and it‚Äôs not safe to talk about ‚Äúfeelings‚Äù, they will have to process their ‚Äúfeelings‚Äù on their own. This is emotional neglect. They may lock themselves in their room and try to process these complex feelings that they don‚Äôt know how to process. This leads on to developing self-reliance and in adulthood and will feel that they have to do everything by themselves. The subject is quite broad, but it‚Äôs very subtle with devastating effects in adulthood. If these events happen over and over again, then abandonment develops. One of the problems that make recovering from emotional neglect very hard, is that it is not about the ‚Äúthings that DID happen‚Äù, it‚Äôs about the ‚Äúthings that DIDN‚ÄôT happen‚Äù. Treating something that never happened is particularly challenging.

PART 2:

Before I continue‚Ä¶. Let‚Äôs recap‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs a good chance that your emotional development was compromised by the time you were 4 years old. This is potentially why you struggle to emotionally connect with others. Perhaps you connect intellectually or through acts of service? You may find yourself avoiding life because your nervous system keeps developing distancing strategies to ensure you don‚Äôt attach to anyone. Because attaching to someone will result in them abandoning you. So your nervous system learnt to go it alone and it thinks it is protecting you! There‚Äôs a good chance that from time to time, you find yourself not sure what you should be feeling? This is likely because of emotional neglect and you don‚Äôt know the emotion words or how to identify certain emotions? You might even be a compulsive rule follower in fear of not doing the ‚Äúright thing‚Äù! Hopefully by this point‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not too far wrong‚Ä¶ 

Many who are fearful avoidant also suffer from enmeshment. In general, this usually means that you are too close to your parents. How this typically develops is that if your parents talked to you about their marriage problems, that they should have been talking to each other about, then you become what's known as a surrogate spouse. You then take on theirs (and other peoples) burdens and you feel responsible for those burdens. Were you your mother‚Äôs emotional support system? If so, you may have become a surrogate spouse. If you are a guy, you may also find that you talk to other women like you talk to your mother? Enmeshment screws up one's sexuality and making your intensions known to the opposite sex feels wrong. Sadly, this also feeds life into the ""sexual shame"" that one may feel. When it comes to sexual shame, I came across the following from a research study with monkeys:

‚ÄúMonkeys that were deprived of sex play in their youth, were unable to engage in sexual activity as adult monkeys; because they could not read the mating signals of the partnering monkeys.‚Äú

Perhaps that resonates with you??

Lastly, those who are fearful avoidant also may have experienced complex trauma in childhood. To clarify, Trauma (PTSD) is a single event trauma, like a serious car accident. Complex Trauma (C-PTSD) are lots of small events over a long period of time, like a highly critical parent. Probably one of the most obvious side effects of Complex Trauma is dissociation. This can include compartmentalisation, derealisation and depersonalisation, which are all forms of disassociation. Trauma is something that ‚Äúwas done to you‚Äù and Complex Trauma is something that ‚Äúbecomes part of you‚Äù. Sadly, traumatization causes areas of the brain to get disconnected which changes the perception of time. I‚Äôm going to guess that life has passed you by without you really realising it, perhaps till now?? Below is what unhealed trauma can look like:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Low sense of self worth

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Always fearing what might happen next

‚Ä¢	‚Å†codependency in relationships

‚Ä¢	‚Å†resisting positive change

‚Ä¢	‚Å†fear of being abandoned

‚Ä¢	‚Å†tolerating abusive behaviours from others

‚Ä¢	‚Å†difficulty in standing up for yourself and asserting boundaries

‚Ä¢	‚Å†putting your needs aside for other people

‚Ä¢	‚Å†an innate feeling of shame

‚Ä¢	‚Å†craving for external validation

‚Ä¢	‚Å†not being able to tolerate conflict

‚Ä¢	‚Å†being overtly agreeable


You may notice the similarities of fearful avoidant traits and behaviours. If you want to know more about trauma, then checkout ""The body keeps the score"" by Bessel van der Kolk. The audio book is excellent!

Obviously, all of the above topics are huge in their own right, but that's where I think you'll find many of the answers you seek. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs possible that through no fault of your own, you may of suffered an attachment failure. You need therapy in order to heal. Some therapists may attempt to guide you towards Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). This is generally the wrong type of therapy to heal the autonomic nervous system. CBT deals with one issue at a time serially. It would take a lifetime to try and deal with something as complex as the autonomic nervous system. You would need a somatic psychotherapist... but for trauma related treatment, a therapist who says ""trauma informed"" isn't enough. You would need a trauma expert because the modalities needed are complex for every individual. One of the best overall therapeutic approaches may be to find an IFS therapist. The Internal Family System (IFS) sounds strange, but we are made of ‚Äúparts‚Äù and those parts are our internal family. 

There is obviously so much more to say‚Ä¶ but I hope that this is helpful in some way‚Ä¶.",4,1759762925.0,virgin,2,1.0,False
1nzlhr7,https://www.reddit.com/r/macbook/comments/1nzlhr7/deciding_on_a_macbook_size/,Deciding on a Macbook size,"**My background and setup for context:**

I am a Computer Science student and I wanna get into music production and video editing. I mostly study from home but this semester I made it my goal to get out more, be more often at uni, become more extroverted and explore my city. Which means I need a portable laptop. One that can fit lecture halls, small coffee shops and other weird places like train and plane seats.

I currently have a 15"" Razer Blade and a 14"" Thinkpad, a 24"" monitor and an iPad. So far my workflow has been using both of these laptops plugged into my monitor when working from home, which is like 95% of the time, so I dont really feel the screen estate difference. My issue when it comes to the portability of these two is that the Thinkpad is too bulky to carry around and it also gets pretty noisy at times, the Razer heats up like crazy to the point the keyboard becomes unusable, almost burning my fingers. And most importantly I'm very tired of needing forever to transfer files from the iPad. The Macbook perfectly solves all of these issues with the seamless ecosystem and its lightweight design, which is why I decided to get one. I would then use the Razer for gaming only and the Thinkpad for learning Linux.

**Choosing a Mac**

Choosing a Mac is more complicated than I thought tho. I went in store to look at the different sizes and found the 14"" to be the perfect fit for me, 13"" felt too crammed and 15"" too big for the portability I think I need. But I currently cant really afford to buy the Pro, its something I see myself doing in a couple years from now as an upgrade. So I have to decide between these two sizes and compromise somehow. My friend who owns a 15"" says its the better way to go, but owning the Razer gives me an idea of what the experience is gonna be like and it doesnt really feel right. Of course I do like the screen estate but carrying it from place to place, fitting in smaller environments and typing on my lap have never been the most enjoyable experiences. I am a pretty small person, with small hands, so I think when it comes to typing, I would only benefit from the smaller edges of the 13"".

I can imagine using it plugged into the monitor when at home or comfortably from bed. When on the go and in need of more screen for multitasking I could use the iPad as an extension. But when it comes to music production or video editing for example, I need just one large screen, I imagine the extension with the iPad would not help in those scenarios. So why not just get the 15"" then? Taking into consideration the speakers are better and the heat dissipation. But also pricier. I am conflicted. Also the 13"" kinda does not feel like a ""real"" laptop, more like a tablet with an integrated keyboard. Might just be an internalised need for ""showing off"" that I havent rationalized yet tho idk. I am just very confused as to where my priorities actually lay, what I actually need and what I don't and might be just romantisizing the idea of a Macbook. I think I am also afraid that all I think about now is portability but then after i get it the workspace is gonna feel crammed all the time and I'll hate using it for multitasking.

**Appeal**

So, with all of this said, I would be very grateful if I could get some guidance on this decision, I am open to any recommandations, hacks etc.

1nzl7rq,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1nzl7rq/dibble_vs_the_destroyer_of_all_things_lonely/,Dibble vs. The Destroyer of All (Things Lonely),"The case file was officially designated Œ©-9. At the Galactic Bureau, Omega didn't just mean ""unsolvable."" It meant ""Metaphysical Containment."" It was a classification for truths that were considered psychic viruses, acknowledging them gave them power. Entire civilizations had agreed to survive by pretending Omega events never happened.

Detective Dibble, Earth's #1 export, had one rule: nothing is unsolvable, only underfunded.

This new string of ritual killings across three star systems was just another case file to him. The Bureau redacted the reports, erased the coordinates, and warned Dibble that reality itself was the crime scene. His supervisor, a crystalline being named Harmonix-7, had pulled him aside before he left.

""Detective, I am legally required to inform you that the entity you're investigating has a ninety-seven percent chance of erasing you from causality. We have five psychic counselors on standby to help your colleagues forget you ever existed.""

Dibble had taken a sip of his coffee. ""So, Tuesday.""

Harmonix-7's crystalline structure had refracted light in what Dibble had learned to recognize as anxiety. ""Frank, if you proceed with investigation rather than containment, you could threaten the Bureau itself. The Council has made it clear, engaging with Omega-class entities can draw their attention to the investigators. If this being decides the Galactic Bureau is... interesting... we may all cease to exist.""

""Understood.""

""And yet you're going anyway.""

""I've got a theory about these crimes. Worth checking out.""

Harmonix-7 had stood still for a long moment, light dancing through their facets in complex patterns. Then they'd reached into their desk and pulled out a small device, a quantum identity scrambler.

""My species believes that chosen death, should be respected as the ultimate expression of individual will,"" Harmonix-7 said quietly. ""If you're certain about this path, I support your choice. But I need you to take this. Scramble any identifying material that could trace you back to the Bureau. Credentials, badge codes, even your genetic signature on file. Make it clean.""

Dibble had picked up the device. ""You're covering your ass.""

""I'm covering my Bureau. And..."" Harmonix-7's light had pulsed in a pattern Dibble recognized as protective. ""I've already drafted a warning to Earth. If an Omega-class entity comes asking questions about who sent their detective, your planet will have three hours' notice to evacuate. It's not much, but it's what I can do.""

""Appreciate it.""

""Frank, I mean it. If this goes wrong, Earth could be blamed. Your whole species could be considered complicit by that thing.""

Dibble had nodded, activated the scrambler, and watched his Bureau credentials dissolve into quantum static. Then he'd poured himself a coffee from the break room and caught the next transport out.

The trail was easier to follow than expected. Gods who wanted attention left breadcrumbs. Three crime scenes, three impossibilities, each one more elaborate than the last. The Xylos Ambassador had been found in his high-security chambers, his body transformed into a living M√∂bius strip.¬†

The CEO from New Veridia had been discovered in her boardroom, restructured as a Penrose triangle. The scientist from Kaelar had been arranged as a Klein bottle in the center of her laboratory, no inside or outside, just one continuous, isolated surface that pulsed.

The bodies were still technically alive. That was the cruelest part.

Every major civilization had pulled their people from the affected sectors. Quarantine fields went up. The Council of Elder Species convened and agreed unanimously: ignore it, and maybe it would go away. Omega Protocol in full effect.

Dibble didn't pretend. He investigated.

He requisitioned a small ship, filed the proper paperwork (even for potential apocalypses, there was paperwork), and followed the pattern. The scenes weren't random. They spiraled inward toward a specific point, a dead colony world called Ash-3, abandoned after an economic collapse two centuries prior.

The sky over Ash-3 glitched like a corrupted feed, flickers of the colony intact, overgrown, or never built at all. The ship‚Äôs AI refused to land, citing ‚Äúincompatible physics.‚Äù So Dibble took the shuttle down himself.

The city was a corpse. Buildings stood at impossible angles. Streets looped back on themselves. And in the central plaza, sitting on a fountain that ran upward, was a four eyed humanoid in a hoodie.

""Name's Ka,"" he said, his voice resonating with a low hum that vibrated in the bones, ""Vuh, for the Menni. Coo, for the Elder Races. Bul, for Zoot. The Unmaker. The Final‚Äî""

Dibble, not looking up from his datapad, scrolled through the Galactic Nomenclature Registry. ""Says here the official transliteration for a being of your... ontological class... is 'Kyle'.""¬†

He finally looked at the God. ""Just Kyle.""

The being blinked all four eyes in sequence. ""Ka-Vuh-Coo-Bul is a sacred resonance. It is the name that was sung at the dawn of this cosmic cycle.""

""The GNR has it listed as 'Kyle'. Probably a filing error. You can contest it with the Interstellar Nomenclature Board after your arraignment.""

With a flick of his wrist, Kyle folded Ash-3‚Äôs moon into an ornate, miniature rose. He held it up to the flickering light, admiring his work. ""Pretty, right? I could do the same to you. Red-shift your blood until you're just a smear of probability. Or maybe I'll fold you into a tesseract. Would you like to experience all your life moments simultaneously? It's quite profound.""

""Kyle, you're under arrest for three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly‚Äî"" he paused, looking at the collapsing moon-rose, ""‚Äîwith everything deadly, really. You have the right to remain silent, though given your power level, I'm guessing you'll decline. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law, assuming we can find a court that hasn't been destroyed by your presence.""

Kyle blinked. For the first time in three star systems, someone hadn't screamed.

""You're Mirandizing me?""

""Yeah. That's what I do. Due process. Even for gods."" Dibble gestured toward the empty planetary security station. ""I've got a room downstairs. Let's talk.""

Parts of the interrogation wing were folding into a pocket dimension. Dibble had opened six doors before the maintenance AI directed him to a chamber it called ""only mildly compromised."" Emergency lights flickered orange, then blue, then colors no one had named. A steel table was bolted to a floor that might vanish before the interview ended.

Dibble laid out three holos and sat down.

Kyle leaned back, chair tilting on two legs. ""Is this the part where you show me pictures and I'm supposed to feel guilty?""

""The Ambassador,"" Dibble said, tapping the first image. ""Folded into a M√∂bius strip.""

""Gorgeous work, actually. One continuous surface, no beginning, no‚Äî""

""An infinite loop going nowhere.""

Kyle's chair dropped forward with a crack. ""Excuse me?""

""Always moving, never arriving."" Dibble's voice stayed flat, almost bored. ""That's what you made. That's what you showed everyone.""

""I *showed* everyone that I could rewrite their fundamental geometry."" Kyle's fingers drummed the table. The rhythm made the metal hum. ""I showed them power.""

""You showed them lonely.""

The humming stopped. ""You don't know what you're‚Äî""

""The CEO from New Veridia."" Dibble slid over the second holo, ignoring the interruption. ""Penrose triangle. Impossible object. Three sides that connect but shouldn't exist.""

Kyle stood up. The walls shimmered. ""You're doing that thing. That cop thing where you pretend everything means something.""

""Sit down.""

""Make me.""

Dibble took a sip of his coffee. Set the mug down. ""I don't need to make you. You came here. You sat down. You're still here.""

Kyle didn't move.

""The scientist from Kaelar,"" Dibble continued. ""Klein bottle. No inside, no outside‚Äî""

""I *know* what a Klein bottle is."" Kyle's voice had edges now. The temperature dropped. ""I'm the one who made it.""

""No way in, no way out.""

""You think you've solved me."" Kyle laughed, but it came out wrong. Too sharp. ""Twenty minutes and you've got me all figured out? The sad little godling who just needs someone to *understand* him?""

""I didn't say‚Äî""

""You didn't have to."" Kyle leaned over the table. Behind him, the wall briefly opened onto hungry void. ""Let me explain something to you, Detective. I don't need your bargain-basement psychology. I don't need your sad stories about troubled kids in art museums. I've lived longer than your species has had written language. I've seen civilizations rise and fall and rise again. You think I'm crying out for help?""

""Yeah.""

The single word landed like a stone in still water.

Kyle's hands slammed down. The table cracked down the center. ""You arrogant‚Äî""

""You used an Architect relic to fold three people into impossible shapes,"" Dibble said. ""Each one a mathematical statement about isolation. You did it in high-traffic areas where they'd be found immediately. You didn't hide. You didn't run. You sat on a fountain on a dead world and *waited* for someone to come.""

""I didn't‚Äî""

""You Miranda'd yourself when I showed up.""

That stopped him.

""You *asked* me if I was Mirandizing you,"" Dibble said. ""Like you were surprised someone would bother. Like you wanted to make sure I knew the rules applied to you too.""

Kyle sat back down. Slowly. ""You're reaching.""

""Am I?"" Dibble pulled out a small notebook, flipped it open. ""The moon-rose. You made it while I was arresting you. Held it up to the light. Said it was 'pretty' and asked if I agreed.""

""So?""

""So you made me a flower, Kyle.""

The silence stretched. The walls stabilized slightly.

""I was demonstrating my power,"" Kyle said quietly.

""You were showing me something you made."" Dibble closed the notebook. ""The difference matters.""

Kyle's jaw tightened. ""You don't know me.""

""No. I don't."" Dibble picked up his coffee again. ""But I know the Aethel Collective evolved past individuality fifteen thousand years ago. I know they're considered the philosophical pinnacle of the galaxy. Pure. Unified. Perfect.""

""I'm not‚Äî"" Kyle's voice cracked. He cleared his throat. Started again. ""I'm not part of that.""

""Because you're broken.""

""Because I'm *wrong.*"" The word came out like a confession. Kyle looked away. ""The Aethel don't have exiles. They don't have outcasts. They have... errors. Glitches in the pattern. And when an error occurs, they simply exclude it from the harmony.""

""They kicked you out.""

""They didn't even notice I left."" Kyle's fingers traced the crack in the table. ""Do you understand what that's like? To be born into a chorus and hear nothing? To scream and have the universe not even acknowledge the sound?""

""No,"" Dibble said. ""I don't.""

Kyle looked up, surprised by the honesty.

""But I've arrested scared kids with guns before,"" Dibble continued. ""The gun doesn't change the math. Neither does cosmic power.""

""This isn't‚Äî"" Kyle gestured sharply, and the gesture tore a small hole in spacetime before he caught himself. ""This isn't the same.""

""Isn't it? You're lonely. You're angry. You want someone to see you. So you did the biggest, loudest thing you could think of.""

""I *destroyed* them.""

""You sculpted them. And then you waited."" Dibble leaned forward. ""You know how I know you're not a destroyer? Real destroyers don't make art. They don't create statements. They don't sit around hoping someone will decode the message.""

""Maybe I just wanted them to suffer.""

""Then why impossible geometries? Why not just kill them?""

Kyle opened his mouth. Closed it.

""You picked shapes that mean something,"" Dibble pressed. ""Shapes that *say* something. The M√∂bius strip. The Penrose triangle. The Klein bottle. You weren't trying to scare people, Kyle. You were trying to make them understand.""

""Stop.""

""You were trying to make someone see‚Äî""

""Stop."" Kyle's voice was small now. The cosmic bravado was cracking. ""Please.""

Dibble stopped.

The silence was different this time. Heavier.

Kyle reached into his jacket slowly, like the movement hurt and pulled out a small crystalline cube. He set it on the cracked table between them.

""Architect relic,"" he said quietly. ""Found it in a vault on a dead world. Reality editor. Point and click interface for rewriting physics."" His fingers lingered on it for a moment. ""Without this, I'm at least less dangerous.""

Dibble looked at the cube. Looked at Kyle. ""That supposed to impress me?""

""No."" Kyle pulled his hand back. ""I just... you should know what you're dealing with.""

""What happens to me?"" Kyle asked.

""Arraignment. Trial. Probably a lot of psychological evaluation."" Dibble stood. ""Maybe some community service. You've got power. Use it for something that doesn't leave people screaming.""

""Will anyone understand?""

Dibble considered that. Picked up the universe-editing cube that Kyle hadn't tried to take back. Sealed it in an evidence bag.

""Worked a case once. Kid broke into a museum, rearranged all the paintings. Put the lonely ones together."" He paused at the door. ""After therapy and community service, he became an art teacher. Helped other people express what they couldn't say. Maybe you've got a future in sculpture. The legal kind.""

Kyle sat in the grey light. Not a destroyer. Just another lonely kid who'd made very bad choices.

Dibble walked out. Behind him, the pocket dimension stabilized. The sky above Ash-3 stopped flickering and chose one path.

He had paperwork to file.

We are complete opposites and he tells me I should do things with him as part of Christian ‚Äúsacrificial love‚Äù. I am active, healthy, exercise regularly, do not enjoy eating out at all, I travel alone. 
He is 300lbs, eats garbage, does not exercise, acts like an immature 15 year old. He just doesn‚Äôt accept me or the time I give him.
I always do special things for his birthday and Christmas but I do not enjoy my time with him.

At first it was fine, but lately it's become unbearable. She's one of those people who CONSTANTLY has things going on.

She has people over. Constantly. It's not just a few friends on a Friday, it's like 4-6 people almost every night of the week. They're loud, they take over the living room, and they eat my food. I've come home to find my entire fridge raided and gone more than once. I'm not a hermit, but I value my peace and quiet, especially after classes. I basically just hide in my room with my headphones on.

I've tried talking to her about it three times. I was polite at first, then more direct. Each time she gets super apologetic, says ""you're right, I'll tone it down,"" and then nothing changes. Last week I even left a note on the fridge asking her to please not have people over after 10pm on weeknights. She texted me ""ok got it!!"" and then that very night had a bunch of people over until 1am.

Last night was the final straw. She was having another one of her ""movie nights"" and there were like 8 people here. They were being so loud I could hear them over my game. I went out to get a glass of water and one of her guy friends was trying to figure out how to use my expensive coffee machine that I specifically told her not to touch. I just lost it.

I went back to my room, logged into the router settings, and changed the WiFi password. It's like 20 characters long, so she'll never guess it in a million years.

Literally two minutes later I hear a bunch of ""omg the wifi isn't working!!"" from the living room. C comes and knocks on my door, asks if the internet is down for me too. I just said ""Nope, works fine for me."" She asked what the password was and I told her I changed it. She just stared at me and then asked why. I told her the internet is for residents, not her friend circle, and that I was tired of it all.

She got FURIOUS. Said I was being a psycho, passive-aggressive, and controlling. I said I was being effective since talking didn't work. She and her friends all went off to another house, but since then she's giving me the silent treatment. She texted me that I'm a huge bitch and that I'm making her living situation ""hostile.""

1nzl5l8,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingZyn/comments/1nzl5l8/25_days_clean/,25 days clean,"I had a pretty severe addiction for about 3 years. I was using Zyn (6mg) up until about year and half ago when I switched over to Alp (9mg). When I was going Zyn, I‚Äôd go through about a tin a day, and sometimes would have 2 pouches in mouth at once. When I made move to the 9mg alp, I was at least able to break this habit. 

I quit cold turkey 25 days ago. I started to notice swollen lymph nodes that would not go away, trouble swallowing, and pain in my gums where I‚Äôd stick the pouch. Withdrawal has not been fun but the worst of it went away after about 3-4 days. The severe brain fog was the worst of it. I relied on my morning pouch just like my coffee to ‚Äúwake me up‚Äù and just to feel normal. The brain fog remains from time to time but not nearly as bad as before. In general, I do feel slower on the uptake and like I cannot process as fast as when I was using. 

My other symptoms are headaches and bodyaches. The headaches were most severe after quitting, but now the bodyaches seem to have taken over as my worst symptom. Strangely enough, in the sides of my neck. I‚Äôm assuming this is related to withdrawal, but was severely worried it might be something else (throat cancer or something) until I just realized it might be related to nicotine withdrawal. 

My other biggest issue has been weight gain. I have literally put on 15 pounds in those 25 days and can‚Äôt ever seem to satiate my appetite. Also, eating has helped deal with the cravings. I am giving myself some space here and just saying it is what it is, once I‚Äôm more ‚Äúnormal‚Äù I can go back to focusing on losing the extra weight. 

All of these symptoms are rough. The aches, pains, cravings, brain fog, weight gain, and even mild depression and anxiety. But despite all of this, I know I made the right call. In fact, it‚Äôs kind of fucked up how casually I was abusing something that could have all of these dire effects on my health. I‚Äôm just hoping after another month or so I‚Äôll be back to feeling normal. But for anyone that is thinking of quitting, it does seem to get better each day so hang in there‚Ä¶.

Instead of me trying to ‚Äúdo‚Äù my day, the day is actually trying to ‚Äúshow‚Äù me something.

I stopped checking my phone and just sat there. The sound of the birds, the traffic, even the breeze felt like symbols. It was the weirdest shift ‚Äî like instead of being in my head, I was in this moving painting that I usually ignore.

For the past couple weeks I‚Äôve been experimenting with starting my mornings this way: before I open emails or social media, I read one simple affirmation or insight and then just‚Ä¶ watch life happen for a few minutes. Sometimes it‚Äôs from a book, sometimes from this [this little free app](https://blif.app/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=r_spirituality&utm_content=morning_message_from_universe) I use that gives short daily spiritual notes. It‚Äôs like a reminder to be awake before the day starts.

What‚Äôs strange is how much more present I‚Äôve felt. My reactions are softer, my thoughts slower, and random coincidences keep happening ‚Äî like the ‚Äúpostcards‚Äù lining up with what I was thinking about the day before.

Not sure if it‚Äôs a technique or just a phase, but it‚Äôs fascinating. Has anyone else tried something like this? Or had days where life suddenly feels like it‚Äôs ‚Äútalking‚Äù to you?

One of his friends had feelings for him, how do I handle this?","My boyfriend (18M) and I (19F) have been dating for about a year. Last May, a girl at his college confessed that she has feelings for him. He had tutored her throughout the semester, but she didn‚Äôt know he had a girlfriend and was very apologetic when he told her. She said she hoped they could be friends. They weren‚Äôt very close at the time, but he told me he wouldn‚Äôt become friends with her because I was uncomfortable.

This semester, he‚Äôs made a lot of new friends and they happen to be very close with this girl. She‚Äôs in the group chat they have together and he started hanging out with her, but never 1 on 1. I initially said it was all good and just asked that he let me know when he was with her (we text eachother throughout the day anyways and normally update eachother on what we‚Äôre doing). He started hanging out with her in a group of 3 and didn‚Äôt tell me about it for a week. I think he was worried I would be anxious about it. He eventually told me because her and his friend drove 30 minutes to bring him coffee at work and he felt guilty about hiding it from me. I was pretty hurt that he didn‚Äôt tell me initially and said I feel less comfortable with the situation because he wasn‚Äôt open about it from the start. However, he doesn‚Äôt want to cut her off because he enjoys her company and can‚Äôt really avoid her in his new friend group anyways. They were all friends with her before him.

I‚Äôm not entirely sure what to do in this situation. I feel a bit hurt that he wants to hang out with her despite me being uncomfortable with it, but I also feel like it‚Äôs controlling for me to tell him who he can and can‚Äôt be friends with. He said that he would only hang out with her in groups of 3+, and doesn‚Äôt seem to think she still has feelings for him.

He also just asked to cut back on calls because he‚Äôs been very busy lately and wants more free time. I think this is totally reasonable but it‚Äôs contributing to my worry that he may be pulling back from our relationship.

I completely trust him and don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any possibility of him cheating. I‚Äôm not sure why I still feel this way when I know he wouldn‚Äôt do anything.

1nzkv5q,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1nzkv5q/mom_josie_lillian_alice_brenda/,"Mom, Josie, Lillian, Alice, Brenda","# They came back to me after I turned fifty.¬†

¬†

Mom died in 2014 from a heart attack- completely unexpected and sudden. I don‚Äôt think I ever actually got over it, although of course life went on, and things became fine.¬†

¬†

Josie is my best friend who died at the start of the pandemic- we know each other from school, we went through college together, and even as the full force of hectic adult life struck us, we never fell out of touch.¬†

¬†

Lillian is my old schoolmate‚Äì she died in her sleep when she was seventeen. I think they also said heart failure or something- that was many many years ago- I had mostly forgotten about her, so I was surprised when her saw her young unblemished face back in my life, but of course I recognized her instantly.¬†

¬†

My cousin Alice, killed in a car accident on her way to pick up her kids. Poor Alice. I felt so bad for the. And her eldest just getting into college. I sent around meals ‚Äì casseroles and mac ‚Äòn‚Äô cheese, but not having a mom at that age? So hard.¬†

¬†

And my colleague, Brenda who died from cancer six months before retirement. She had helped me when I was just getting started in this job. She‚Äôd been dead for almost nine years by the time I hit fifty- did she die before or after Mom? I couldn‚Äôt remember telling Mom about Brenda, so probably after.¬†

¬†

All the women I had known and loved, back with me, in my house.¬†

¬†

I am not delusional, suffering from psychosis caused by missing them so much. Nor is this metaphoric. I see them, very clear, not all the time, but sometimes, And even when I‚Äôm not seeing them, I know they are there. I don‚Äôt speak to them, since I am not delusional and I respect the boundaries between the spirit world and ours.¬†

¬†

They occupy space in my house without bothering each other. I remember how upset Mom was when Lillian, my schoolfriend died. She was only seventeen- oh I already told you that, yes. Mom was upset of course, but she was also worried that Lillian‚Äôs sudden death would impact my studies- distract me. She told me, the sunlight in our kitchen gleaming off her gold-rimmed glasses, that Lillian would not want to see me crying, and to concentrate on my math exam next Tuesday. Lillian would be happy if I got a good grade.¬†She poured me a coffee, I think my first grown-up cup of coffee, and I felt welcomed into the adult world. I still remember the taste of that coffee.¬†

¬†

I passed the exam, with an A, actually. Now Mom and Lillian glance at each other in the kitchen- a different kitchen, but Mom still wears those gold-rimmed glasses. Lillian seems shy of Mom, much as I remember she had been in real life, all those years ago, when we were both little girls. I don‚Äôt blame her, Mom could be quite a formidable presence- in fact, she still is.¬†

¬†

Brenda is by the window. Another formidable presence! She helped me deal with that toxic workplace bully. I was so grateful. She taught me so much. Always so generous with her time. A good colleague is like a sister, honestly. ¬†‚ÄúWe got this!‚Äù she used to say, bustling into the office in her slightly outdated skirt suits.¬† Although she‚Äôs a ghost now, and thus not given much to talking, if at all, I can still hear her say it, when I catch sight of her, wearing those tailored office suits and pants with chunky jewelry.¬†

¬†

I am happy to see them all, be with them all. I‚Äôd love to tell cousin Alice her kids are grown and doing well at life, if I could. Her face is peaceful, so I think she knows. I do wonder why she chooses to spend time with me, rather than her children, but I guess it makes sense, when you think about it. Same with Brenda. Although I don‚Äôt think Brenda had much family- I remember her memorial ‚Äúcelebration of life‚Äù quite well and it was mostly colleagues. We talked about it at the time. Well, Brenda is more than welcome to spend whatever time she wants in my home. ¬†

¬†

And Josie- I missed her most of all. Friends are the family we choose, right? We laughed so much together, reliving our memories from college. She‚Äôs dead, I‚Äôm alive, but we have so much in common otherwise! Sure, I can make new friends now, go to a local meetup group, hiking pickleball sketching singing but I won‚Äôt have those memories of growing up together, going to school, weddings and children and all that with these new friends, will I? ¬†

Years passed. I lived a quiet life, in my darkening years, and Mom, Brenda, Alice, Lillian and Josie were right there with me. Some people would remark that I must be lonely, but why would I be? I had the women whom I loved the most with me in my house. True, I am not making new memories with them like we used to, but after all, there is nothing much new under the sun, only love and friendship remain. I‚Äôm not going to claim it was as it had been when they were alive, it is different, I know that!¬†

¬†

One day, I¬†had to get a wheelchair. Mom‚Äôs face changed a little that day I returned from the hospital on a wheelchair- I saw the change. It had been many years since her death, and in all those years her face had stayed the same. But when she saw me in my wheelchair, her face changed. I wished so much then I could talk to her, tell her it was ok, I was ok. Lillian, Josie, Alice and Brenda didn‚Äôt change, but then as Mom would say, a mother‚Äôs love is different. ¬†

¬†

Anyway, there was nothing I could so about it, I needed a wheelchair, and I needed at-home care and that was that. Sammie started visiting me, to care for me, you know how it is, to help me with cleaning and meals and things. Because my place wasn‚Äôt exactly what you would call wheelchair accessible. I was on some sort of list to move into another place that was, and I wondered if Mom, Lillian, Brenda, Josie and Alice would move in with me when that came through. I didn‚Äôt ask Sammie, it wasn‚Äôt the sort of question you could ask people, and I would find out soon enough anyway. ¬†

¬†

Mom and Brenda didn‚Äôt like Sammie at all, even though I thought Sammie took good care of me, feeding me when my hands were too shaky, cleaning up after me, chatting away. Lillian liked him, so did Josie and Alice. But Mom and Brenda- their faces twisted up when he came over. And he came over more and more, I needed more care after all, and sometimes he would be tired from caring for me- I understood that. I understood being tired and fatigued. I tried not to do anything that would make Sammie extra-tired, but I couldn‚Äôt help it, my hands shook and I spilled the tea. Sammie was a bit rough- I'm sure he didn‚Äôt mean to be. I saw Mom watching him handling me and I felt scared- of Sammie or Mom? ¬†

¬†

Brenda was by the window but then she turned and moved towards us, me in the wheelchair, Sammie bent over me, wiping the tea and scolding me and perhaps hurting me a bit, the way he was scrubbing with the towel, and I saw Brenda‚Äôs face, she had the same look as when she helped me deal with that toxic workplace bully so many years ago, her lips pressed against each other. Brenda and Mom were close upon us now. ¬†

¬†

I wanted to call out to Sammie, to be careful, but it was too late- Mom and Brenda crashed into him and he dropped to the floor, motionless. ¬†Josie and Lillian and Alice and I stared at Sammie‚Äôs corpse. Mom told me to call 911 because Sammie had a heart attack, and I did.¬†

1nzkthd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScreenwritingUK/comments/1nzkthd/pick_up_your_first_bbc_writing_credit_reading/,Pick up your first BBC writing credit (READING),"This is from Dave Cohen's email newsletter. Looks useful to me.

\------

A lot of people say ‚ÄòI want to be a writer‚Äô and you‚Äôll be amazed at the number ‚Äì I mean seriously, properly amazed. I know this research is 10 years old but it‚Äôs still worth repeating that in 2015 YouGov ran a poll of 15,000 people asking them what their dream job would be and around 9,000 of them, yes, 60 per cent of this very large sample of the population said: ‚ÄòI want to be a writer‚Äô.

If you‚Äôre reading this, and at this exact moment I can only assume you are, you have already gone considerably further than at least 90 per cent of the above. (9,000! In the UK that would work out at around 20 million out of the entire working population.)

You know that there‚Äôs a lot more to being a writer than sitting in a coffee shop with your laptop and typing ‚ÄòFADE IN‚Äô in 12 point Courier and getting all excited about how what you‚Äôve written looks exactly like the opening of the incredible scripts you‚Äôve already read of your favourite movies.

You know, because I never tire of telling you that rejection is the default setting for most TV comedy writing - often while the latest one is still ringing in my ears.

However thanks to the existence of topical BBC Radio programmes any one of you could resolve from today that you are going to aim to pick up your first professional BBC writing credit and achieve that triumph even before the first airing of ye traditional 2025 Johnne Lewiss Advertissement.

You‚Äôd be amazed how much kudos is attached to being able to tell people that you have written comedy for the BBC. Especially to Americans, generations of whom have bowed down to Peter Sellers, Peter Cook, Monty Python, and the like. The ones currently using machines to reshape our universe in the image of crypto, tech bro and Trump love to cite Hitch Hiker‚Äôs Guide and Ricky Gervais as their chief inspiration.

Not everyone succeeds at picking up this first credit. You can try writing for one of these open door BBC shows, and if it doesn‚Äôt work out you have the pleasure of bracketing yourself with Richard Curtis and Ade Edmondson. They both spent a good while trying to pick up a credit on Radio 4‚Äôs Week Ending but never managed. Loser. Whatever happened to Richard Curtis?

Quite a lot clearly do succeed. Since 2021 Dan Sweryt, Ellie Hayward and I have been helping new writers do just that. Congratulations to Oli Court for his first Skewer credit last week, our 51st new credit. Oli scored again this week, as did Lucy Goldring - again. One credit per series is enough for your CV, two can give you the confidence to say ‚ÄòI seem to know what I‚Äôm doing here‚Äô.

The latest series of Breaking The News begins NEXT WEEK and if you‚Äôre interested in attempting to pick up your first credit you can find out more about that here‚Ä¶¬†[**https://www.davecohen.org.uk/pick-up-your-first-bbc-writing-credit/**](https://click.mlsend.com/link/c/YT0yODQ4MjMzMDg2Mjc2MDgxMjIyJmM9aTF5MyZlPTE5MjgmYj0xNDgyOTQyOTQ1JmQ9bTdiMHk4dw==.JvjC_H5sYo-1f0gnJ1UoUijXU0DpTenSC2CWhCoYYvM)

if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

I just moved into a building who is starting on a lengthy balcony restoration project. It‚Äôs loud. I work from home and my watch has warned me that it‚Äôs been over 100db for hours on end. It‚Äôs hard to be in meetings, even if they don‚Äôt hear in the other end. It‚Äôs also hard to think with prolonged periods of intense noise. 

Each row of balconies takes 10-12 weeks to complete. There are stages within the process that are noisier than others, but there‚Äôs at least 4 weeks within each segment that they consider ‚Äúextreme noise‚Äù. 

I also have a nervous cat. She‚Äôs already spooked and thrown off from the move, and now the noise on top of it. I have gotten her a little cat tent but she won‚Äôt go in it. She‚Äôs will hide under the bed (close to the window, probably one of the loudest spots), or at my feet at the desk. 

I have average noise cancelling headphones which minimally help. Some days I can go work at a coffee shop or coworking space, but it can be challenging with the confidential nature of my work. I also don‚Äôt like leaving my cat alone when she‚Äôs afraid. 

This is going to be a long haul - especially with my row of balconies and on either side of me.

I use to own and successfully sold a company that provided data and telesales to various markets. Recently I have been thinking of making a ""come back"" and have been heavily considering the FE vertical. From what I have seen in Reddit, FE insurance forums and a couple of agent I have spoke to the final expense lead vertical is filled with vendors who sell non compliant, low intent leads on the cheap.  
  
I built my previous business on quality and believe that people will pay for quality so I am under the impression that there might be room for a lead provider who keeps compliance and quality at the forefront.  
  
Let me share my vision and I respectfully ask for your insights:

My vision is providing: ""100% QA -Audited, TCPA - certified, live transfers with real intent and full consent recording. So every call is high intent and compliance ready - absolutely no fillers.""

What this looks like:

* Every leads comes with TCPA consent proof: Link to TrustedForm or Jornaya certificate attache
* Contacted and reached by a verification team member
* Verification team member confirms intent. ""Yes I still want to hear about final expense options""
* Verification team member confirms eligibility: Age, location (ie. not in assisted living), bank account or debit card to initiate a policy, (on fence about asking ""Just to make sure we connect you to the right agent are you currently using oxygen prescribed by a doctor"" - your thoughts)
* QA audits lead for compliance and tone ( no hard selling)
* Transferred to a rep who confirms lead want to speak with an agent NOW and gives consent to be transferred.
* transfer to an agent
* All verification and transfer consent calls are recorded and saved for the TCPA 5 years

I have some thoughts on retention because that is important to you all as well but not the crux of this conversation.

I feel confident that an experienced telesales FE agent should close at the very worse case 20% of these call - and if your only closing 20% or less you can't drink the coffee because coffee is for  closers! :)

Call center model:

I still have access high quality native sounding off shore agents that I used for banking. If I used them and kept my QA agents, dialer, data and recording in the US - I could offer this somewhere around $55 to $70 dollars per transfer.

If I used a hybrid model - offshore verifiers, onshore QA and reps - the price jumps to somewhere between $75 and $90

If I went all US based base we are north of $100

  
This is where I need you! What do you think of this model and would you subscribe to a lead company making such an offer?

 If you are an experienced FE telesales agent who currently buys leads please chime in. If you think that only F2F sales is the path forward, I respect your opinion but you wont be adding value to this conversation by voicing it within this post.

In my city, developers are always fighting NIMBYs to put up these 3-5 story luxury condominiums with underground parking on site, ""mixed use ground level"" but it's mostly the lobby and a coffee shop or something, and the sparsest imaginable landscaping on the thinnest imaginable strip of land between the sidewalk and the building.

But they always, always, always use like half a dozen different materials on the facade ... Or maybe only four, but two colors or designs each. Do you know what I'm talking about? If not, I can post a picture. I pass by a few on my commute.

Why do they do that? Is it just style? Is there some insurance reason? Is it to make each look different even though they are all basically the same? Is there an industry nickname for the style?",3,1759760529.0,askarchitects,4,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

I'm just not sure what to put on their altars! I always find this the hardest part haha. I also don't know if having Priapus outside is a good idea or not? I'd like to if I can but I'm a little worried about the elements. So if anyone can give advice on having outdoor altars that'd be great too. 

All I currently have for Hestia is a white candle and amethyst. I want to give her food and coffee offerings on our regular plates/mugs instead of using my typical ones. It just feels more appropriate (and since I only have two plates currently between all my deities).

What I have for Priapus? Well... I'll get him a glass or bowl for libations set up! Uh... that's all I've got for now.

1nzkbe8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCAS/comments/1nzkbe8/mcas_histamine_intolerance_what_do_you_actually/,MCAS / Histamine Intolerance ‚Äî what do you actually take when symptoms hit hard?,"**TL;DR:**  
Would love your input on:

1. What medications (including *exact dose*) you‚Äôre taking for **MCAS**
2. What helps you for **Histamine Intolerance** (meds, supplements, DAO, etc.)
3. How accurate your **MCAS diagnosis** was and how it was performed

  
**My story**

About 15 years ago, I was prescribed very strong **anti-acne medication** ‚Äî first **Doxycycline** (for nearly a year) and then **Isotretinoin** (for another six months).  
Shortly after, I started reacting differently to food and stress. I could eat and drink anything before that, but suddenly even small things triggered strange symptoms.

The dermatologist told me, *‚ÄúThat can‚Äôt be from the medication ‚Äî it‚Äôs already out of your system.‚Äù*  
Now, I suspect those treatments might have contributed to **long-term gut and immune imbalance**, possibly by disrupting my microbiome.

At the time, I was a broke student and just blamed everything on stress. But as I got older ‚Äî and could finally afford to see specialists ‚Äî things got worse. I‚Äôve seen dozens of doctors and spent thousands of euros. Most treated the **symptoms**, not the **root cause**.

  
**Where I‚Äôm at now**

After 15 years, I finally have a clearer picture:

* Diagnosed with **increased intestinal permeability (‚Äúleaky gut‚Äù)** and **severe Histamine Intolerance**, based on blood and stool analysis 
* Multiple **food intolerances** confirmed
* **MCAS** seems likely based on my symptoms, though not formally confirmed 

  
**My current lifestyle:**

* No alcohol (quit 5 years ago)
* No coffee
* No sugar, gluten, or wheat
* Eating very clean and simple

Each of these changes helped temporarily ‚Äî but over time, I started reacting to **more and more things**.

DAO supplements sometimes help, but often not. I‚Äôve tried over-the-counter antihistamines with mixed results. I‚Äôm not sure which ones are truly effective for MCAS-type reactions or safe for long-term use.

  
**My symptoms during flare-ups**

When I‚Äôm in a histamine or MCAS flare, it feels like my body goes into **survival mode**:

* My **mouth and gums are inflamed**, my **jaw aches and tightens**
* My **throat burns**, and **swallowing hurts**
* I **sweat constantly** on my forehead and nose
* I feel **exhausted, depressed, and completely drained of motivation**
* My whole body feels **acidic and heavy**
* Sometimes I also get **heart palpitations**, though not always

These episodes can last for **days or even weeks**, and during them, I become hypersensitive to almost everything ‚Äî food, stress, even light physical activity.  


**What I‚Äôd love to learn from you**

If you‚Äôve been through something similar, I‚Äôd deeply appreciate your insight:

1. What **antihistamines or mast-cell stabilizers** (and *exact doses*) have helped you most during strong flare-ups?
2. Do they act fast enough to pull you out of that ‚Äúcrash‚Äù state ‚Äî and if yes, which ones?
3. How was your **MCAS diagnosis** confirmed ‚Äî blood tests, biopsy, tryptase, or symptom-based assessment? How reliable was it in your case?
4. (Optional) If you‚Äôre comfortable, could you share your **daily protocol** ‚Äî what you take regularly vs. only in emergency phases?

I‚Äôve read a lot and seen many doctors, but still don‚Äôt know which specific meds, combinations, or dosages truly make a difference in *real-world experience*.  
Any detailed advice ‚Äî even small things that helped you stabilize faster ‚Äî would mean a lot.

1nzkaxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/1nzkaxb/narcolepsy_meds_gave_me_adhd/,Narcolepsy meds GAVE ME ADHD?...,"I'm SO SORRY this is so long. I wanted to tell my story as I have nowhere else to really do that. If I'm wanting advice or at least wanting someone to UNDERSTAND my situation, I wanted to give the FULL PICTURE. I TRULY appreciate anyone that takes the time to read this. 

I have ALWAYS been VERY productive. I have ALWAYS had a SUPER clean house. I even had my own cleaning/organizing business. I only did it part-time, maybe 2 or 3 houses a month....but this was GOOD MONEY. Most jobs that were supposed to be ONE day ended up turning into TWO days because I was SO THOROUGH and borderline obsessive (family has called me OCD) and refused to leave ANYTHING at all undone in a home. If a family paid me anywhere from $200-$500 (depending on the job) to clean and organize their home, I felt like it was irresponsible and unethical to leave ANY DIRT or ANY MESS anywhere in the whole house. LOL I would dust things that probably had 20-40 years of dust on it bc NO ONE in their right mind would think to dust it. LOL But, I got a HUGE satisfaction out of it. It satisfied this obsessive side to my brain. It felt good to see something filthy and make it clean again. It felt good to see something such an unorganized MESS and organize it beautifully, where it all made sense to the family and what they were using that space for. I LOVED IT SO MUCH! PLUS, It was good money that helped subsidize my income. It helped bring money in for my family. 

I NEVER gardened in my life. I married my husband, and we had a HUGE backyard. I got the idea that I wanted to start growing our own food. Organic, healthy food! We started out with 3 raised beds we built, and over the next 2 seasons, we ended up with a 50 ft greenhouse, 3 more raised beds, and 2 HUGE in ground beds. It escalated quickly! LOL! I made a business out of it. I became a nursery twice a year.  We did a spring garden AND a fall garden. I started THOUSANDS of seeds indoors under grow lights and once they were healthy seedlings, I moved them out to my greenhouse where they grew until they were big enough to be sold. I sold them to my community, and they were always so grateful and thanked me every year. We did that 3 years in a row. I LOVED IT SO MUCH!! 

My FULL TIME job was as a re-seller online. I would buy from rummage sales, estate sales, thrift stores, and private buys. It was SO EASY to find things for CHEAP and sell HIGH. I also VERY MUCH enjoyed this! It brought so much money in for my family. With reselling, as long as you are ACTIVE and LISTING on the platforms, your stuff sells. If you don't list, they don't put your products out front. If you aren't active, your stuff falls off. You don't list, you don't sell!                                                                                  (Here arises a big part of my problem)

I'm 41 now. Year 35 I met my husband. I would lay on the couch w him and watch movies. I started falling asleep on his chest. like IMMEDIATELY. AS SOON AS I WOULD GET STILL. I would be out in SECONDS. He would move and I would wake up and I would say I was just dreaming...and I would tell him ""yeah I was just dreaming about a man that took my buggy full of groceries while I was bent down getting something off the shelf, and he just walked to the register with it and bought my groceries and loaded em in his car and...yada yada yada this whole long dream"" He was like Baby...you were only asleep for like 30 seconds.... I told him I been doing that a lot lately. I can just be sitting down and I will fall asleep and have this long dream in like a second of dozing off. He said I think you have narcolepsy! We joked and blew it off, but it became a running joke. But, over the next two years, things got considerably worse. The first time I became so sleepy I was afraid I would fall asleep at the wheel, I was riding down the road and fighting sleep. All of a sudden, I would feel, what I can only describe as an electric shock. It would start at the top of my head and electricity would shoot through my body to my feet. This happened almost every time I got in the car. I was afraid, and didn't tell anyone at first. But it became dangerous. So I finally told my husband and he took me to the dr. The dr. put me through my sleep tests, and ultimately diagnosed me with Narcolepsy with Cataplexy. 

The dr medicated me. I'm on:

 modifinil (200mg) 1xday (i take it in the morning).                                                                                                                  

adderal (30mg) 2xday 

My dr wanted to put me on xywav, but I'm a recovering addict, and after talking to the xywav represenative and telling her my story (drug addict 15 years. clean 10 years) her words were, 

""I'm not sure if this is the right medicine for you. I am on a recorded line, and I have never told anyone this before, but I will just have to answer for what I said bc I really don't think that this medicine is right for you.""

I started crying bc I was THANKFUL that she said that. I was struggling with it myself. I was struggling with taking it & knowing my history. I already HATE being on adderal. It scares me too. Even though my doctors dont seem to care. They aren't bothered at all by my past. They just seem to want to pump me full of drugs. So, i didnt throw the lady under the bus. I just told my dr that it scared me and RIGHT NOW, I would politely decline, and I hope he understood. He said he did and he didn't take it personally. He said if i ever changed my mind to just let him know and we would go that route. 

So, now that's out of the way.... my PROBLEM is that I have STOPPED gardening, STOPPED working cleaning and organizing, and STOPPED working my reselling business. My house is a MESS. I am UNMOTIVATED, and i feel STUCK. It's like as soon as I started taking adderal, my life went to garbage. 

My cataplexy went away,and i am SO THANKFUL for that because I could not grip things. Mainly in the mornings, I just could hardly hold on to my coffee. My rug behind my coffee table, in front of where i sit, is BROWN and it's supposed to be cream... It wouldnt take someone scaring me to lose my grip. I just would lose grip. Out of nowhere. One second holding my coffee, the next second, before a thought about it, it's on my floor. (i have had people from reddit say that's not possible and it sounds like something neurological but that's MY experience and I have spoken to others that had the same experience. My doctor also understood this so please dont come for me). But, that no longer happens, and I can tell you that not having control of my hands was one of the most depressing things for me bc I coudn't stop dropping stuff (again mainly mornings). As far as driving goes, there ARE times that I can drive without feeling the electricity shooting through me (my dr says this is my bodies way of trying to wake itself up so I don't die.) but it's NOT gone away altogether. IT STILL HAPPENS. 

So it's not like this medicine has ""fixed"" me. It's made certain aspects of this terrible disease EASIER, but it's also made my life HELL. I don't do ANYTHING i used to love. When I describe what I feel and how my days go, people say it sounds like ADHD, and I have to agree bc I have a best friend that is ADHD and her house looks like mine! it's a disaster. It was SO EASY for me to buy stuff bc I bought stuff so cheap that I have rooms full of inventory. Stuff that should have been listed and sold by now... but it's like i will sit down and try to list and this or that will distract me and by the end of the day, I've listed NOTHING. and again, in reselling, if you aren't listing, you aren't selling, so i have a house FULL OF STUFF.... and it's invaded my living area. I just feel STUCK. I WANT to get off the adderal but I will go back to the way it was before and fall asleep every time i sit still. To be fair, when I WAS doing all those things THAT I LOVE, my disease wasn't this far along. My dr. says people are born with it and people get it around the age of 36. Mine started happening year 35 and got worse and worse as time went on. 

Has ANYONE experienced this? if So, HOW did you overcome it? Is there anyone that HAS experienced this that can weigh in? Please, I want to hear from people who have experienced this.... or maybe know someone who has. bc if you haven't experienced this then how can you truly understand?

I apologize, my punctuation got lazy toward the end, I'm getting tired, and this post is getting long. 

Let me take a minute and say that I am THANKFUL that my life could be SO MUCH WORSE!  I have a loving and supportive husband and family. I AM GRATEFUL for so much. I just wish I had my old life back, and OBVIOUSLY things will never be like they used to be, but if it's at ALL possible to IMPROVE my situation, I wanna know HOW! THANK YOU!!
