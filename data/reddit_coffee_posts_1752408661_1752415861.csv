1lytoo8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Enneagram/comments/1lytoo8/does_the_sp_instinct_seek_out_immediacy_in/,Does the SP instinct seek out immediacy in self-fulfillment?,"Hi.

**Thoughts/Questions**

- …So, when I tend to notice a perceived misbalance within my body in some capacity, or even a yearning for some form of tangible fulfillment, there’s a desire to want it in immediacy— I can be patient and wait if if is not socially civil to push for it, but there are certainly issues with impulse control that I wonder if they reflect on an unbalanced SP instinct?

- For example, when I feel tired, going to bed and falling asleep as a comfortable form of fulfillment occupies my brain and I can get frustrated/agitated if I am not allowed to sleep when I feel I need to; conversely, if I am tired, but obligations demand I stay awake, then I will seek a tangible means to rectify it— I’ll get fixated on having some coffee.

- I guess a theme here is the desired form of tangible fulfillment is sought out with immediacy and is idealized to be pleasurable so as to stimulate happy feelings in my brain— if something is not pleasurable or fulfilling, I would go seek out a different tangible outlet to fulfill the perceived misbalance internally.

- This likely reflects poorly on my maturity and impulse control, but there tends to be an unhealthy focus on short term, immediate relief that is provided, impatience arising when having to work towards the long term form of relief— maybe it can be chalked up to mental health factors as well, but there’s a compulsive focus on immediate gratification.

- I am curious if this tracks for a SP instinct and if others can relate, please?

Thanks.

1lytonm,https://www.reddit.com/r/desmoines/comments/1lytonm/des_moines_water/,Des Moines Water,"tl;dr: High nitrate levels in Des Moines water. What are you doing for safe drinking/cooking water?

I've been seeing articles on how Des Moines drinking water contains high amounts of nitrates and how nitrates are linked to cancer and how Iowa has the second highest rising cancer rates. This is me trying to connecting dots and isn't a proven correlation as far as I know.

This article ([Should I boil my water? What to know about Des Moines' high nitrate levels](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/health/2025/06/28/is-des-moines-water-safe-to-use-clarifications-on-boiling-guideline/84391585007/)) says that ""All water produced by Central Iowa Water Works meets all safe drinking water standards"" but doesn't elaborate on ""safe drinking water standards"". We shouldn't boil water to drink but we can boil water a little for tea and coffee. I feel like maybe I don't want to take that risk?

What are you guys doing for safe drinking water? I know I can't completely cut out the tap water but I'd like to reduce my intake of it. Are you buying bottled water? 5 gallon water jugs/water coolers? Trusting the safe drinking water standards?",0,1752415678.0,desmoines,0,0.5,False

1lytnt7,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1lytnt7/what_are_your_favorite_point_of_performance_set/,What are your favorite “point of performance” set ups you use?,"I heard this phrase from Dr. Russell Barkley. It helped me understand what it meant to make the way I keep my home functional for *me* vs. trying to keep up with my home in the impossible regular sort of way. 

My understanding is that making a system “point of performance” means setting it up so that the place you would have the thought to execute a task, that’s where you put everything you need to complete that task. And so on… basically for me this means I don’t have to travel as far to put things away but also feel marginally less cluttered. Haha. Anyway here’s some of mine:

- Hang my keys on the doorknob
- Tension rod on my curtain doorframe so I can have a middle place for hung up laundry from the floor
- Dish soap+water spray bottle in the shower (yet to work because I haven’t brought a sponge over…)
- I wear scrubs for work and immediately take them off and put them in the washing machine after work
- Taped up my PT exercises to the wall nearby where I stand aimlessly sometimes
- Protein bar basket on the way out the door
- Meds on the counter on my typical morning route with one dixie cup for pills and one for water (and the sink is within arms reach!!!)
- Cutlery all mixed together in a metal basket on the dish rack
- Sticky note pads everywhere with pens/thick sharpies to jot stuff down
- Disinfectant wipe tubes under the coffee table, nightstand, desk
- Grocery bags without holes for cleaning the litterbox in a little trash bin next to the box

1lytns2,https://www.reddit.com/r/JEEAdv25dailyupdates/comments/1lytns2/just_needed_a_advice_more_like_a_rant/,just needed a advice (more like a rant),"hello 16 M here, this post is something idk what to say but i was trying to figure out what life is, for me till 5 life for me was simple, playing in streets no study stress, from 1st class my mom started teaching me for 1-2 hour and i used to get rank 1 , 2 ,3 for type and saw my elder sister struggle and i made fun of her that she cant even do this that, in 4th -5th the only thing i cried for was ki mujhe school council mein lo , lmao, and stress free life and things going decent, then 6th mein thori padhai badhi and 7th , 8th lockdown hua and it was like i was staying at home and 9th mein mene aakash join karlia tha online and i stayed away from socials in 9th and mene ek class skip bhi kari thi to i had no friend in 9th to mein ekdam sub bacho se anjan tha, so i missed the pre teen era and how people are like in pre teen , vohi 13-14 saal ke bache and unki nibbi sigma chad harkate,mein padhai karta tha and lockdown mein ghar par family sath time spend karta raha, not made any socials and used to play minecraft and roblox a lot and watch youtube, ekdam chill life and fir mein jab school kam hi gaya 9th mein, 10th mein mene school jana shuru kardia and abhi bhi mein class mein kafi bolne lag gaya and friends circle bhi ban gaya altough meri class mein saare merse badhe the but abhi bhi social media nahi chalaya and meri academics kafi badhiya chal rahi thi and then in 10th ki mid mein i got feelings for a girl (elder than me) for the first time, mene uske liye social banaye, and i got into social media and mein vo bacha ban gaya jo pura din story dalta rehta , reel scroll karta rehta and ussi type so called dank humour insta par shuru huya tha usse pehle to moti se na hero se wale dance hi hote the and i fell into that dark humour, andrew tate but i got out of andrew tate in 10th end but for that instagram i wasted my half 10th and my most of the time period and insta ke karan mein delulu mein chala gaya and jo crush bas ek attraction thi vo mujhe boht badhi lagne lag gayi,(mindwash lol). to ab mein 11th mein bahar jata hoon for padhai for jee cause somehow i liked maths and since mene aakash join kiya tha 9th 10th mein to mera usme interest bhi tha, then pata nahi insta karan hi mera man nahi lagta padhai mein and merse intially april mein hi jee nahi ho raah tha and mujhe fir vo relationship wale post dikhe to mene apni crush ko confess kar diya and she rejected cause we were in diff sec to she didnt even knew me properly but then vo post aane lag gayi , boys never move on and yeh sab and i was manupilated and mere dost bhi samjhate rahe but i didnt understand it, mein padhai mein theek thak tha to meri padhai chalti rahi theek se and then 11th ended and meri theek thi and 12th mein i took a bold step of throwing my phone and laptop and switch to nokia considering that i used laptop 24 7 and till now in 11th for me life was winning her and i used to study with her as a motivation quite lame and then 12th mein main serious hogya thora sa and starting was going good, i forgot to mention i deleted my social in between permanently so i lost contact of her updates and uski photo mein memory card mein dal li thi keypad wale mein and then mera 12th mein halka downfall hua though mein kafi padh raha tha acc to me but mein kam padh raha tha and family pressure aaya, then july mein thora up hua and august mein ganda downfall fir due to so many silly mistakes and it always looked like a excuse and then for a lil confidence boost mene ioqm diya sept 1st week mein and i got a score of 65+ and got lil hope in myself and fir sept mein mene socha improve karna h and from april to aug, meaning of life was chaning for me , from apr - may mein har jagah ghumta rehta and kam padhta, june to bilkul nahi padha, july mein i used to be myself realising how people are around me and tried maintaing my self respect and birthday to mein kabhi manata hi nahin to birthday par mummy papa dadu dadi didi masi mausa mamu nani ne wish kiya and 4-5 dost purane wale kyuki naye walo ko mene bataya nahi and mummy ne khane ko bheja mujhe and aug mein uska birthday aata tha to i was excited i will excel this month but i didnt, then sept mein mene achi tarah padhai kari and mere nokia mein youtube chalta tha but sim mein net nahi tha to mein pura din yaha to gaane sunta and yaha to radio sunta , 98.3 mirchi mostly and tayari karta, i cut off my contacts very much in hostel but somehow meri improvement hoti rahi and lekin fir bhi piche tha and ghar wale kehte the ki kya kar raha h beta, itni mehnat kar raha fir bhi improve nahi kar paa raha utna, but i just got a diff meaning of life, mein somehow move on hogya and halka sa pet bhar nikal raha tha , daari aagyi thi but yeh sab nahi dekh raha tha mein, mein apne dost se weekend par sim mange youtube par mango boi dekhta, ek gaana tha yahan koi nahin and heat waves in dono par pura din relate karta padhte huye and kafi improve hogya tha and at end of last test in mid oct i stood 1st in paper 1 and overall rank 2 for the first time and was so much happy and tabhi mujhe realise hua ki people love me , like they would trust me and would share things with me , even ek junior aake mere kandhe par roya bhi tha and then i felt very much good and then diwali par mein ghar gaya and these 2 months were too good for me, then mein diwali par ghar gaya and boht maze kiye and then for me life was apni padhai karo, self satisfaction, self love and family , and i made a female friend on discord back then and we bonded really good and then i went back to hostel with nokia , forgot to mention i used to vlog with my nokia and also took random photos of night and random things, nov mein i thought ki ab body par bhi dhyan dena h but 7 din baad i couldnt follow that hard routine of padhai but i got a very good habit of studying much and drinking black coffee and eating so many fruits and december mein jab test shuru hoye tu i was really doing the best of me consistenly and mein har hafte wednesday ko jaake lab mein apni discord wali friend se baat karta and i really liked it, we didnt even know how we looked but we shared that vibe and mummy se har roz achi baat hoti, family was happy too and then came january and i got back to mobile and laptop and forgot to mention from mango boi, i became addicted to channel like dank rishu and sunraybee and i used to watch them all day on my nokia while studying or listen to that ek kahani esi bhi but then i switched to mobile and i ruined my january attempt by that and due to hormonal changes and mood swings i also fought with my that female friend and things wennt( i got 99.87 in jee january attempt ik for many its gonna be very good but i didnt like it cause my preparation was so much better) boards mein bhi mene adv ka nahi padha and that time for me i had a fire to do something but too lazy to do and i wasted my whole time on youtube till mid march and then march onward mein ghar gaya to ghar ki financial condition dekh kar mei serious hogya and mummy ne kaha ki didi ka bhi tujhe hi dekhna h to mene boht padhai kari and april wala nta mc ki galti ki wajah se 99.95 tak hi rehgaya varna or upar jata , vese to i was satisfied cause i did good from my side and mummy ne result wale din pizza mangwaya mere liye as a congo, i was really hoping to do much better and at that time mein pura din padhta, teacher se doubts leta, saari assigments banata and mummy se baat karta phone par didi and ghar ke regarding and fir meri prep top par thi and then mein ek hafte pehle ghar aaya due to war and ghar par end mein utni padhai huyi nahi mersi cause of black out everyday for 3-4 days and environment nahi mila mujhe, for me life from mid march to may was ki apni life mein goal orietated raho and dost banao boht saare but main 5-6 hi banao and relationship are not worthy, altough you should get in situantionship just for fun and yehi kara mene, then adv wale din mein fumble kar gaya but managed to get a rank under 900 in jee adv and on result day family thori khush bhi thi, city mein rank 1 thi and i was somewhat happy though didnt got what i wanted, for me now life was relax now , and for future me i decided the life to go same way like i did from mid march to may because i thought it to be the best for managing social time and personal time and work, until i forgot to add one of the important chapters in it, when i faced it and it was the family relations and death when i faced such a condition, i am 16, i may live upto 70-80, my grandpa will die in 15-16 years, i have 50-60 years more to live, i realised i had my major life without him, i was just confused what is death and what is life, is there any spirit, why i am working so hard when most of the people who helped me grow would not be there with me when i am built myself at age of 55, why i fear doing some shit now at age of 16 when i have 50-60 years more to live and that shit would affect them for max 2 years, today i am with all my masi mausa and my cousins enjoying but what in future, i wont even meet them like this again but then i see my grandpa that his mom died 50 years ago and for him his family is his children and not his brother sister who live far away, i just began wondering whats the truth of life and i was just really confused and i cant explain myself properly here but i am so much confused what is purpose of life because for me my perfect meaning of life seems meaningless to me now.",1,1752415609.0,JEEAdv25dailyupdates,1,1.0,False

1lytn9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1lytn9x/dont_get_along_with_my_boyfriends_brother_no_one/,Don’t get along with my boyfriend’s brother. No one is on my side.,"I am really hurt and angry. I live with my boyfriend and his two brothers in their house (that their parents gave them). At the moment they are not selling it but the plan is in the future to move out with my boyfriend. I hope sooner rather than later.

His youngest brother acts like he is the king of the house. He won’t let me work from home in the study room or in the living room because he says he needs both rooms at the same time? He is really controlling when it comes to opening windows and doors every day. On several weekends, he came in and opened the door whilst me and my boyfriend were sleeping to “allow the air to get through”. We could have been naked or whatever. He says we have to get into the routine of leaving all the doors open all the time but then his and the other brother’s doors are closed. He is also really jealous in his nature:

He is trying to lose weight for a new job- he can’t do it very well because he eats entire packets cheese at 3am and packets of icing and drinks several litres of cola and sprite a day. He gave me a lift in his car and explicitly said: 
You really need to watch what you are eating and you need to also do a sport! You also need to stop being a child, my brother also ( my boyfriend). You are both like my children and I tell all my friends that. Sorry? But I can live how I wish, I never thought my weight is an issue as I’m not overweight but now I’m starting to feel self conscious and I’m annoyed that he can see what I’m eating and is constantly making horrible comments. 
He also said I am drunk all the time, in front of his mother, which isn’t true. Then also said I HAVE to stop putting sugar in my coffee. Erm no? i told my boyfriend all this and that he was horrible about us both and he said it’s easier to leave it. And he hasn’t even told him off or spoken to him and said we are angry or upset. He will never stick up for me with it. 

The child comment hurt the most since I am the only person in the house who works and I am the only one who pays the bills on the house since this mean brother has no job already since 8 months, the other brother is having a holiday semester and my boyfriend is trying to finish his studies. The rich uncle pays for the bills, and me. 

Any advice on how to not go crazy living with this guy ? My boyfriend is also not being supportive and he always takes their side to avoid “drama/ arguments”, which he thinks aren’t worth it. But then this youngest brother never gets taught that you can’t speak to people like that and have the audacity to just go around speaking to people like rubbish. ",2,1752415572.0,lonely,0,1.0,False

I live with my boyfriend and his two brothers in their house (that their parents gave them). At the moment they are not selling it but the plan is in the future to move out with my boyfriend. I hope sooner rather than later.

His youngest brother acts like he is the king of the house. He won’t let me work from home in the study room or in the living room because he says he needs both rooms at the same time? He is really controlling when it comes to opening windows and doors every day. On several weekends, he came in and opened the door whilst me and my boyfriend were sleeping to “allow the air to get through”. We could have been naked or whatever. He says we have to get into the routine of leaving all the doors open all the time but then his and the other brother’s doors are closed. He is also really jealous in his nature:

He is trying to lose weight for a new job- he can’t do it very well because he eats entire packets cheese at 3am and packets of icing and drinks several litres of cola and sprite a day. He gave me a lift in his car and explicitly said: 
You really need to watch what you are eating and you need to also do a sport! You also need to stop being a child, my brother also ( my boyfriend). You are both like my children and I tell all my friends that. Sorry? But I can live how I wish, I never thought my weight is an issue as I’m not overweight but now I’m starting to feel self conscious and I’m annoyed that he can see what I’m eating and is constantly making horrible comments. 
He also said I am drunk all the time, in front of his mother, which isn’t true. Then also said I HAVE to stop putting sugar in my coffee. Erm no? i told my boyfriend all this and that he was horrible about us both and he said it’s easier to leave it. And he hasn’t even told him off or spoken to him and said we are angry or upset. He will never stick up for me with it. 

The child comment hurt the most since I am the only person in the house who works and I am the only one who pays the bills on the house since this mean brother has no job already since 8 months, the other brother is having a holiday semester and my boyfriend is trying to finish his studies. The rich uncle pays for the bills, and me. 

Any advice on how to not go crazy living with this guy ? My boyfriend is also not being supportive and he always takes their side to avoid “drama/ arguments”, which he thinks aren’t worth it. But then this youngest brother never gets taught that you can’t speak to people like that and have the audacity to just go around speaking to people like rubbish. ",1,1752415521.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Putting myself out there a bit. I'm a 37-year-old guy living in London. Life's pretty good, but it's always nice to meet new people, right?

A few things I enjoy:

* **Swimming:** You'll often find me doing laps at the local pool – it's my go-to for clearing my head and staying active. Always happy to chat about good spots or even find a swimming buddy.
* **Photography:** I love capturing moments and a bit of the world around me. You can get a feel for my style over on my Flickr:[https://www.flickr.com/photos/piersmathias/](https://www.flickr.com/photos/piersmathias/)
* **Reading:** I'm a big fan of history, and I'm currently making my way through ""Revolutionary Spring"" by Christopher Clark. It's a fascinating look at 1848 in Europe. Always up for book recommendations or a good discussion.

Beyond that, I enjoy exploring London's never-ending offerings, decent coffee, and good conversation.

Looking to connect with friendly, interesting people for chats, maybe a coffee or a walk, and see where things go. Whether you share some of these interests or have completely different ones you're passionate about, I'm open to hearing from you.

I'm a 35-year-old guy living in Stockholm, and lately I’ve found my social circle getting smaller. Some of my close friends have started families, others are in long-term relationships, and a few have even moved out of Sweden altogether. While I’m happy for them, I do miss having people around for spontaneous hangouts or just someone to talk to after a rough day.


Now that the sun is out and summer’s finally here, it feels even harder to sit indoors without someone to grab a bite with, take a walk, or just enjoy the weather. If you’ve been feeling the same, you're not alone! 


I’m looking to meet others in a similar phase of life. Ideally folks in their late 20s and above, who are also looking to expand their social circle. Both men and women are welcome, and I’m only looking for platonic friendships.


A bit about me: I am 35m, moved to Sweden about 10 years ago. I’m into sports and fitness, enjoy geeking out over the stock market, love good food, play video games every now and then and I’m always up for exploring something new, whether it’s a different cuisine, an event, or just a walk with good conversation.


If you’re someone who values genuine connection and misses having people you can message last-minute for a walk, coffee, or dinner then drop me a message! Let’s make the most of the season and see where things go.

*Lazy mornings, people watching, the warm sun on my skin, fresh coffee, the smell of freshly cut grass, rum (spiced or dark), teasing, exploring castles and forests (not hiking), long drives in the countryside, 90's alternative music, cooking and trying new foods, horror/psychological films, late nights and early lazy mornings, drawing/sketching, dogs.*

A few things i dont like..  
*One worded responses, going to bed early, cats, twats riding scooters, being out in the cold, crowds of people, being stuck behind slow walking people, cold showers, noisy people in the cinema, dancing.*

I see myself as a gentleman, im polite and courteous, i say strange words like ""please"" and ""thank you"".  
My friends would probably say that im quiet until i get to know someone, but really im just quietly confident. I'm easy to get on with and down to earth, somewhat flirtatious but always respectful.",1,1752415360.0,UkFriends,0,1.0,False

 I just finished my first year of university studying medicine aka the art of never sleeping and pretending coffee is a personality as studying is all we know. When I’m not buried in textbooks, I’m usually into sports, music, or reading and recently, cooking too but that's mostly because no one else in my student flat knows how to operate an oven without summoning the fire brigade. That said, I’m definitely someone likes learning about everything or picking up hobbies just because someone else enjoys it so if you want to pick my brain or test my wits, go ahead.

1lytjmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1lytjmx/cant_stand_my_boyfriends_brother/,Can’t stand my boyfriend’s brother.,"I am really hurt and angry. I live with my boyfriend and his two brothers in their house (that their parents gave them). At the moment they are not selling it but the plan is in the future to move out with my boyfriend. I hope sooner rather than later.

His youngest brother acts like he is the king of the house. He won’t let me work from home in the study room or in the living room because he says he needs both rooms at the same time? He is really controlling when it comes to opening windows and doors every day. On several weekends, he came in and opened the door whilst me and my boyfriend were sleeping to “allow the air to get through”. We could have been naked or whatever. He says we have to get into the routine of leaving all the doors open all the time but then his and the other brother’s doors are closed. He is also really jealous in his nature:

He is trying to lose weight for a new job- he can’t do it very well because he eats entire packets cheese at 3am and packets of icing and drinks several litres of cola and sprite a day. He gave me a lift in his car and explicitly said: 
You really need to watch what you are eating and you need to also do a sport! You also need to stop being a child, my brother also ( my boyfriend). You are both like my children and I tell all my friends that. Sorry? But I can live how I wish, I never thought my weight is an issue as I’m not overweight but now I’m starting to feel self conscious and I’m annoyed that he can see what I’m eating and is constantly making horrible comments. 
He also said I am drunk all the time, in front of his mother, which isn’t true. Then also said I HAVE to stop putting sugar in my coffee. Erm no? i told my boyfriend all this and that he was horrible about us both and he said it’s easier to leave it. And he hasn’t even told him off or spoken to him and said we are angry or upset. He will never stick up for me with it. 

The child comment hurt the most since I am the only person in the house who works and I am the only one who pays the bills on the house since this mean brother has no job already since 8 months, the other brother is having a holiday semester and my boyfriend is trying to finish his studies. The rich uncle pays for the bills, and me. 

Any advice on how to not go crazy living with this guy ? My boyfriend is also not being supportive and he always takes their side to avoid “drama/ arguments”, which he thinks aren’t worth it. But then this youngest brother never gets taught that you can’t speak to people like that and have the audacity to just go around speaking to people like rubbish.

I like coffee and I buy a flat white or two everyday but I am certainly no coffee expert - I can say whether coffee is good, bad, or in between.

I have had a number of people tell me not to buy the Breville Smart Grinder Pro and to buy a better one but none can tell me which because they all bought the Smart Grinder Pro.

Not being a coffee expert but wanting ‘good’ coffee, what grinder should I buy that would maximise the quality of the coffee I can get out of the BDB? Automatic grinder is preferred.

I’ve gone deep into a rabbit hole googling and had no clue there is so much to know about coffee 😵‍💫. Seeking any suggestions, happy to spend a bit more than what the SGP costs if it’s going to make quite a difference to the quality.",1,1752415224.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

Just thought I would check in on this subreddit since it’s been a while, see if there’s any new interest, I’ve actually been saving this one for a while. Maybe you should deposit a message into my inbox. 

Hey hey, my name is Nick, I’m 28 years old, from Texas, and I work in finance. Obviously I tell the most amazing jokes ever, especially bank related. 

Some things I’m into, outdoors, coffee, driving, Formula 1, most mainstream sports, reading, I’ve been getting back into gaming. My favorite colors are purple and orange but not together. My favorite smell is coconut. I’m 6 feet tall, but 6’2 when I wear boots. I graduated college late about 2 years ago. I used to be a contractor. My right ankle is held together with 11 screws and a metal plate. 

Basically I can yap, a lot. And I need someone to also yap with. Talk soon?

what life is, for me till 5 life for me was simple, playing in streets no study stress, from 1st class my mom started teaching me for 1-2 hour and i used to get rank 1 , 2 ,3 for type and saw my elder sister struggle and i made fun of her that she cant even do this that, in 4th -5th the only thing i cried for was ki mujhe school council mein lo , lmao, and stress free life and things going decent, then 6th mein thori padhai badhi and 7th , 8th lockdown hua and it was like i was staying at home and 9th mein mene aakash join karlia tha online and i stayed away from socials in 9th and mene ek class skip bhi kari thi to i had no friend in 9th to mein ekdam sub bacho se anjan tha, so i missed the pre teen era and how people are like in pre teen , vohi 13-14 saal ke bache and unki nibbi sigma chad harkate,mein padhai karta tha and lockdown mein ghar par family sath time spend karta raha, not made any socials and used to play minecraft and roblox a lot and watch youtube, ekdam chill life and fir mein jab school kam hi gaya 9th mein, 10th mein mene school jana shuru kardia and abhi bhi mein class mein kafi bolne lag gaya and friends circle bhi ban gaya altough meri class mein saare merse badhe the but abhi bhi social media nahi chalaya and meri academics kafi badhiya chal rahi thi and then in 10th ki mid mein i got feelings for a girl (elder than me) for the first time, mene uske liye social banaye, and i got into social media and mein vo bacha ban gaya jo pura din story dalta rehta , reel scroll karta rehta and ussi type so called dank humour insta par shuru huya tha usse pehle to moti se na hero se wale dance hi hote the and i fell into that dark humour, andrew tate but i got out of andrew tate in 10th end but for that instagram i wasted my half 10th and my most of the time period and insta ke karan mein delulu mein chala gaya and jo crush bas ek attraction thi vo mujhe boht badhi lagne lag gayi,(mindwash lol). to ab mein 11th mein bahar jata hoon for padhai for jee cause somehow i liked maths and since mene aakash join kiya tha 9th 10th mein to mera usme interest bhi tha, then pata nahi insta karan hi mera man nahi lagta padhai mein and merse intially april mein hi jee nahi ho raah tha and mujhe fir vo relationship wale post dikhe to mene apni crush ko confess kar diya and she rejected cause we were in diff sec to she didnt even knew me properly but then vo post aane lag gayi , boys never move on and yeh sab and i was manupilated and mere dost bhi samjhate rahe but i didnt understand it, mein padhai mein theek thak tha to meri padhai chalti rahi theek se and then 11th ended and meri theek thi and 12th mein i took a bold step of throwing my phone and laptop and switch to nokia considering that i used laptop 24 7 and till now in 11th for me life was winning her and i used to study with her as a motivation quite lame and then 12th mein main serious hogya thora sa and starting was going good, i forgot to mention i deleted my social in between permanently so i lost contact of her updates and uski photo mein memory card mein dal li thi keypad wale mein and then mera 12th mein halka downfall hua though mein kafi padh raha tha acc to me but mein kam padh raha tha and family pressure aaya, then july mein thora up hua and august mein ganda downfall fir due to so many silly mistakes and it always looked like a excuse and then for a lil confidence boost mene ioqm diya sept 1st week mein and i got a score of 65+ and got lil hope in myself and fir sept mein mene socha improve karna h and from april to aug, meaning of life was chaning for me , from apr - may mein har jagah ghumta rehta and kam padhta, june to bilkul nahi padha, july mein i used to be myself realising how people are around me and tried maintaing my self respect and birthday to mein kabhi manata hi nahin to birthday par mummy papa dadu dadi didi masi mausa mamu nani ne wish kiya and 4-5 dost purane wale kyuki naye walo ko mene bataya nahi and mummy ne khane ko bheja mujhe and aug mein uska birthday aata tha to i was excited i will excel this month but i didnt, then sept mein mene achi tarah padhai kari and mere nokia mein youtube chalta tha but sim mein net nahi tha to mein pura din yaha to gaane sunta and yaha to radio sunta , 98.3 mirchi mostly and tayari karta, i cut off my contacts very much in hostel but somehow meri improvement hoti rahi and lekin fir bhi piche tha and ghar wale kehte the ki kya kar raha h beta, itni mehnat kar raha fir bhi improve nahi kar paa raha utna, but i just got a diff meaning of life, mein somehow move on hogya and halka sa pet bhar nikal raha tha , daari aagyi thi but yeh sab nahi dekh raha tha mein, mein apne dost se weekend par sim mange youtube par mango boi dekhta, ek gaana tha yahan koi nahin and heat waves in dono par pura din relate karta padhte huye and kafi improve hogya tha and at end of last test in mid oct i stood 1st in paper 1 and overall rank 2 for the first time and was so much happy and tabhi mujhe realise hua ki people love me , like they would trust me and would share things with me , even ek junior aake mere kandhe par roya bhi tha and then i felt very much good and then diwali par mein ghar gaya and these 2 months were too good for me, then mein diwali par ghar gaya and boht maze kiye and then for me life was apni padhai karo, self satisfaction, self love and family , and i made a female friend on discord back then and we bonded really good and then i went back to hostel with nokia , forgot to mention i used to vlog with my nokia and also took random photos of night and random things, nov mein i thought ki ab body par bhi dhyan dena h but 7 din baad i couldnt follow that hard routine of padhai but i got a very good habit of studying much and drinking black coffee and eating so many fruits and december mein jab test shuru hoye tu i was really doing the best of me consistenly and mein har hafte wednesday ko jaake lab mein apni discord wali friend se baat karta and i really liked it, we didnt even know how we looked but we shared that vibe and mummy se har roz achi baat hoti, family was happy too and then came january and i got back to mobile and laptop and forgot to mention from mango boi, i became addicted to channel like dank rishu and sunraybee and i used to watch them all day on my nokia while studying or listen to that ek kahani esi bhi but then i switched to mobile and i ruined my january attempt by that and due to hormonal changes and mood swings i also fought with my that female friend and things wennt( i got 99.87 in jee january attempt ik for many its gonna be very good but i didnt like it cause my preparation was so much better) boards mein bhi mene adv ka nahi padha and that time for me i had a fire to do something but too lazy to do and i wasted my whole time on youtube till mid march and then march onward mein ghar gaya to ghar ki financial condition dekh kar mei serious hogya and mummy ne kaha ki didi ka bhi tujhe hi dekhna h to mene boht padhai kari and april wala nta mc ki galti ki wajah se 99.95 tak hi rehgaya varna or upar jata , vese to i was satisfied cause i did good from my side and mummy ne result wale din pizza mangwaya mere liye as a congo, i was really hoping to do much better and at that time mein pura din padhta, teacher se doubts leta, saari assigments banata and mummy se baat karta phone par didi and ghar ke regarding and fir meri prep top par thi and then mein ek hafte pehle ghar aaya due to war and ghar par end mein utni padhai huyi nahi mersi cause of black out everyday for 3-4 days and environment nahi mila mujhe, for me life from mid march to may was ki apni life mein goal orietated raho and dost banao boht saare but main 5-6 hi banao and relationship are not worthy, altough you should get in situantionship just for fun and yehi kara mene, then adv wale din mein fumble kar gaya but managed to get a rank under 900 in jee adv and on result day family thori khush bhi thi, city mein rank 1 thi and i was somewhat happy though didnt got what i wanted, for me now life was relax now , and for future me i decided the life to go same way like i did from mid march to may because i thought it to be the best for managing social time and personal time and work, until i forgot to add one of the important chapters in it, when i faced it and it was the family relations and death when i faced such a condition, i am 16, i may live upto 70-80, my grandpa will die in 15-16 years, i have 50-60 years more to live, i realised i had my major life without him, i was just confused what is death and what is life, is there any spirit, why i am working so hard when most of the people who helped me grow would not be there with me when i am built myself at age of 55, why i fear doing some shit now at age of 16 when i have 50-60 years more to live and that shit would affect them for max 2 years, today i am with all my masi mausa and my cousins enjoying but what in future, i wont even meet them like this again but then i see my grandpa that his mom died 50 years ago and for him his family is his children and not his brother sister who live far away, i just began wondering whats the truth of life and i was just really confused and i cant explain myself properly here but i am so much confused what is purpose of life because for me my perfect meaning of life seems meaningless to me now.",0,1752415134.0,ThirtiesIndia,2,0.25,False

then diwali par mein ghar gaya and these 2 months were too good for me, then mein diwali par ghar gaya and boht maze kiye and then for me life was apni padhai karo, self satisfaction, self love and family , and i made a female friend on discord back then and we bonded really good and then i went back to hostel with nokia , forgot to mention i used to vlog with my nokia and also took random photos of night and random things, nov mein i thought ki ab body par bhi dhyan dena h but 7 din baad i couldnt follow that hard routine of padhai but i got a very good habit of studying much and

kahani esi bhi but then i switched to mobile and i ruined my january attempt by that and due to hormonal changes and mood swings i also fought with my that female friend and things wennt( i got 99.87 in jee january attempt ik for many its gonna be very good but i didnt like it cause my preparation was so much better) boards mein bhi mene adv ka nahi padha and that time for me i had a fire to do something but too lazy to do and i wasted my whole time on youtube till mid march and then march onward mein ghar gaya to ghar ki financial condition dekh kar mei serious hogya and mummy ne kaha ki didi ka bhi tujhe hi dekhna h to mene boht padhai kari and april wala nta mc ki galti ki wajah se 99.95 tak hi rehgaya varna or upar jata , vese to i was satisfied cause i did good from my side and mummy ne result wale din pizza mangwaya mere liye as a congo, i was really hoping to do much better and at that time mein pura din padhta, teacher se doubts leta, saari assigments banata and mummy se baat karta phone par didi and ghar ke regarding and fir meri prep top par thi and then mein ek hafte pehle ghar aaya due to war and ghar par end mein utni padhai huyi nahi mersi cause of black out

not worthy, altough you should get in situantionship just for fun and yehi kara mene, then adv wale din mein fumble kar gaya but managed to get a rank under 900 in jee adv and on result day family thori khush bhi thi, city mein rank 1 thi and i was somewhat happy though didnt got what i wanted, for me now life was relax now , and for future me i decided the life to go same way like i did from mid march to may because i thought it to be the best for managing social time and personal time and work, until i forgot to add one of the important chapters in it, when i faced it and it was the family relations and death when i faced such a condition, i am 16, i may live upto 70-80, my grandpa will die in 15-16 years, i have 50-60 years more to live, i realised i had my major life without him, i was just confused what is death and what is life, is there any spirit, why i am working so hard when most of the people who helped me grow would not be there with me when i am built myself at age of 55, why i fear doing some shit now at age of 16 when i have 50-60 years more to live and that shit would affect them for max 2 years, today i am with all my masi mausa and my cousins enjoying but what in future, i wont even meet them like this again but then i see my grandpa that his mom died 50 years ago and for him his family is his children and not his brother sister who live far away, i just began wondering whats the truth of life and i was just really confused and i cant explain myself properly here but i am so much confused what is purpose of life because for me my perfect

1lyte0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/dbcooper/comments/1lyte0r/article_in_smokejumper_magazine/,Article in smokejumper magazine,"Came across a neat article in Smokejumper Magazine describing CIA jumps in the late 60's from a 727 at ""The Ranch"" followed by a Cooper investigation. 

He says the 727's were depressurized with flaps set at 15 degrees and landing gear down to create drag. Cooper of course requested all three of those settings. It's almost too on the nose.

It then mentions that funding for the project was cut and the project was scrapped, ""much to our chagrin."" 

This guy was investigated just 5 days after the Cooper hijack, so the FBI was looking at these smokejumpers pretty quickly.

It's a long article but here's the excerpt about the 727 jumps and the Cooper stuff. This isn't any new information or anything and some of you may have seen this article before. Just thought I'd share nonetheless. 

Excerpt:

In May 1968, I was scheduled to “The Ranch” for a special project. Ranch operations were always on a hush-hush, need-to-know basis. When hired by the CIA, all employees are required to sign a non-disclosure agreement. You promise not to reveal any information relating to “intelligence sources or methods” without first securing authorization. The slightest violation would compel threats of prosecution and severe consequences. No copy of this document was given to the employee. Clearance levels were granted for special ops as you were vetted.

At “The Ranch” details of the mission were given when you arrived on site. We were told that the training was for testing the feasibility of making aerial deliveries into Tibet. This highly secret project was the first of its kind. We were to drop cargo and jump out of a Southern Air Transport “sanitized” Boeing 727 jet. The tail number was the only marking on this stark aluminum plane.

The cargo drops went without a hitch. Then we suited up for our parachute jump. We leveled off at 1200 feet. The cabin was depressurized, flaps were set at about 15Â°, the landing gear was lowered to create drag to maintain 150 knots, and the exit ramp was lowered. When we got over the jump spot, the pilot gave the signal and we slid out the rear of the plane. Compared to jumping out of a prop plane, there was no noise or prop blast. It was quiet and there was hardly a jerk when the static cord released. We floated down with the greatest of ease. Knowing what to expect, we were all excited to make a second jump. The tests went well and the project was approved and ready to go. However, the funding was cut and the 727 Tibet project was cancelled, much to our chagrin.

Postscript: Fast forward to Monday morning, November 29, 1971. When I retired from Air America in August 1969, the “Call of the Wild” lured me to Alaska. I decided to put my University of Alabama Bachelor of Science business degree to use. I had just begun the second year of owning and operating the Polar Bar on East 5th Avenue in Anchorage. I was having a cup of coffee and talking with a customer when two suits walked through the door. They showed me their FBI badges and said they were investigating a Northwest Airline Boeing 727 skyjacking on the night before Thanksgiving. They knew I had jumped out of a 727 with Air America and wanted to ask me a few questions. Since their statement was correct, I assumed they had been talking to the CIA. First, they wanted to know where I was on Wednesday night. When I explained I was working the bar they showed me a drawing of Dan Cooper, asking if I knew him. I said it did resemble Lou Banta (CJ-51), a smokejumper I had worked with at Air America, but he wasn’t on the 727 jump project in Thailand. As a coincidence, Louie happened to live in Oregon not far from where Cooper supposedly exited the plane. 

However, after being investigated, Banta was exonerated. We had a good laugh in Portland at the 2008 Air America Reunion. D.B. Cooper became a cult hero and remains the only unsolved skyjacking in American aviation history. In past years a standing joke at Smokejumper and Air America reunions was, “D.B. Cooper Lives!”

I’m trying to find a specific Billie Eilish fanfic I read on Wattpad, but I’ve lost the link and can’t find it anywhere. Hoping someone here might know it.

**What I remember:**

* Billie is bullied a lot at school and just starting her music career.
* She meets a girl named Mila at a coffee shop — Mila has an eating disorder and an abusive dad.
* Billie’s on a phone call with her ex, Mila overhears and says “what a bitch,” Billie hears it, and they become friends because Mila sees Billie for who she really is.
* Another key scene: Mila passes out at school, Billie picks her up, and Billie finds a weight scale in Mila’s bag.
* Billie’s best friend is Jennifer (or ""BSF Jennifer"") who’s also involved in the story.
* The story has over 40 chapters.
* The cover is mostly black and the description was very simple.
* One chapter title I recall is something like “You and Jennifer.”

1lytbtd,https://www.reddit.com/r/LordofTheMysteriesRP/comments/1lytbtd/the_efficient_scribe/,The efficient scribe,"What a predicament

I am a thief by nature and now Im forced to act as a scribe, what do scribes even do? According to my own abilities I am supposed to record stuff? So to act as one can I just record anything?

With this thought in mind I went on an exploration of port city, finally taking in all it has to offer. Due to both my former profession as a thief and  my overall life I never actually managed to fully take in all the sights of the city.

First stop was my own workplace, coming in as a customer always feels refreshing . I ordered my usual, a fresh croissant and a black coffee. The rich coffee aroma was permeating the area, the jazz music created a relaxing atmosphere and the cat was entertaining a few kids while the parents were taking a relaxing break as well. In this lovely atmosphere I picked up my new journal and my pen, recording as many details as I could before finishing my order and leaving. Feeling a bit of my potion being digested.

“In retrospect, this is why the old man had all these descriptions of places. Also on the start of the journal to huh? Im really following in his footsteps even tho I don’t think that’s a good thing to do, after all he died only as a seq 5”

My next stop was the famous church of miracles, a tall temple standing tall right in the middle of the city, a place of quite serene peace were people come from all over the world to pray, to pray at the earth for sustaining us, at the sky for protecting us, at the sun for granting as warmth and at the moon for illuminating even the darkest of nights. Of course I visited this place before, its quite unique architecture , its mosaics depicting gods that have long perished, the altar inside, the object placed in such a way to work in the favour of the sun’s rotation, always shining its warmth on to the cold stone. The monks and priest were a bit weird but I never minded that much. Outside of this majestic temple I found a bench in a quiet area, picked up my notebook and pen and started recording it to.

After seeing something so serene I decided to take a drastic shift, going into the bad part of town to check out the new brothel, apparently it has an aquatic theme to it. Sounds quite interesting.

“THAT WAS A FUCKING MISTAKE, I SWEAR I WILL FIND THE PEOPLE RUNNING THESE AND CUT THEM TO BITS,BURN THEM ALIVE, SUFFOCATE EACH OTHER WITH THE REMAINS OF THEIR COMRADES. FUCKS SAKE. I HEARD RUMOURS THAT ALL GODS ARE DEAD BUT NOW I THINK I CAN CONFIRM IT”

After this horrible discovery I quickly left the area and went to my next destination. The Empire recruitment building.

This building runned by a shady figure called the Rec Emperor was quite out of the ordinary, its architecture was unsymmetric, it was a black colorless tower standing imposingly in quite a reserved part of the city. It also look wrong, the door was centered a bit to the left of where its supposed to be, the steps were a bit inclined, not enough to affect anyone walking on them but enough to notice. The receptionist seemed to be a feminine man in a maid dress.

“I think I… No I don’t”

Once again I found a quiet spot and recorded its quite unique style.

And finally I went to grab something to eat, a shop that says warm bread and other pastries named finally enough the “Door Bakery”. It was a small shop in the side of the building, with a few tables in front. In the background you can barely see the countless workers making all the pastries while in front a cute lady picked up my order.

“I wonder if I can sue them for using the Door name, or maybe they can sue me. Better not to push the subject or Ill be the next target of the bread mafia”

I ordered a delicious meat pie alongside a piece of pastry filled with vanilla cream and covered in chocolate. The person said its name but it was in Intisian so I didn’t get it.

After consuming the delicious pastries I once again picked up my notebook and pen and recorded this. Than I paid my bill and left to go home after a long day of exploring before a thought struck me:

“Hmm, maybe I can use my artefacts to record some of their powers to, this way I wouldn’t need to activate them if I don’t need to.”

This counts as both a acting post and a mission submission. Sue me.",1,1752414692.0,LordofTheMysteriesRP,0,1.0,False

1lytb1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tipstor/comments/1lytb1y/hunger_in_the_guatemalan_highland/,Hunger in the Guatemalan Highland,"Guatemala draws roughly two million visitors each year, most drawn to Antigua’s colonial charm or Lake Atitlán’s towering calderas. Visiting between December and March helps dodge rain and landslides. Tourism supports remote communities, but flip open the map and the contrast hits—rural highlands in the Dry Corridor suffer persistent drought, chronic poverty, and malnutrition. This is a nation of dizzying inequality. Two-thirds of the population subsists on less than $2 a day, with indigenous Mayans making up over 40% of residents but accounting for 80% of those living in poverty (TIME).

Wandering dirt roads to villages undisturbed by tourists reveals crops failing under relentless heat. Since 1950, annual rainfall has dropped 2.7% while population growth hovers around 2%. The result is fragile yields and stretched supplies (Cambridge University Press & Assessment). Maize and beans, staples for rural households, have seen as much as 50% losses across two consecutive growing seasons in parts of the Dry Corridor, forcing farmers to buy seeds at inflated prices or skip planting entirely (DevelopmentAid).

Children bear the heaviest burden. Nearly 46.5% of Guatemalan under-5s are stunted nationwide. That figure spikes to 53% in deep rural areas and peaks at 70-90% in some municipalities (Cambridge University Press & Assessment). Chronic malnutrition impairs not just bodies but brains. School performance crashes, workforce potential dwindles, and the poverty trap tightens.

Current crisis-level conditions affect at least 2.7 million people from June to August 2024, rising potentially to 2.8 million by early 2025, as formal food insecurity grips the region. Subsistence farming families, those dependent on seasonal labor or informal trade, simply lack cash for basic food baskets (wfp-us, IPC Info).

A traveler near Cobán or Huehuetenango sees farmland reduced to brown dust. Irrigation canals run dry, livestock shrivel, and wild honeysuckle becomes a survival fallback. International aid channels flow in such as the World Food Programme treating tens of thousands of acutely malnourished children, UN-backed agricultural training in drought-resilient crops, and USAID-funded “Moving Forward” programs teaching water management and seed banks . Still, these efforts face funding threats, especially as U.S. aid teeters on political lines (TIME).

Tourists trekking Pacaya or kayaking through Río Dulce rarely encounter this. But the optics exist of wealthier travelers staying in luxury lagoons. Coffee finca resorts support economies that skews investment toward tourism zones, not farm fields. Even so, spending $70-$100 on a Lake Atitlán boat tour doesn’t ripple into Alta Verapaz’s parched fields. Guatemala needs deeper investment in water infrastructure, community-based agronomy, and nutrition programs targeted at indigenous households (2022.gho.unocha).

Visitors interested in more than postcard panoramas can mix trekking with impact. January through March provides ideal weather in the Highlands. Combine guided lake hikes with community meals in Mayan homes, where tortillas may be the only staple available. Don’t just marvel, ask whether aid is reaching kids under five or how they managed seed diversity this year. Query tour operators about partnerships with programs delivering fortified porridge or drought-resistant maize.

Guatemala’s charm shouldn’t blind travelers to its fissures. Every tinted lens of colonial facades hides malnourished children under five who cannot finish a chicken leg. Drought, economic disparity, underinvestment and structural inequality converge into a crisis of chronic malnutrition. For a travel magazine dedicated to data storytelling, these are the numbers worth holding against the vista.

Data doesn’t offer solutions, but it exposes the scale of nearly half of children stunted, millions facing food crises, and harvest losses up to half of staple crops. Nutritional emergency isn’t over yet, it’s daily. Travelers passing through should order more than coffee. They should ask harder questions, tip generously, and demand that tourism dollars animate change rather than shade it.

1lytaia,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1lytaia/explore_the_best_electric_kettle_breville_smart/,Explore the best electric kettle Breville Smart Kettle Luxe worth it,"Breville BKE845BSS1BUS1 appears to embody everything one might desire in an electric kettle, especially if you're someone like me who thrives on caffeine or relishes a perfect cup of tea to kickstart the day. I recently had the opportunity to test this brushed stainless steel beauty for several weeks, and I’ll admit – I expected it to be just another appliance that heated water. What I got, however, was so much more.

**Sophisticated Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that struck me about this kettle was its sleek, brushed stainless steel finish. It has a premium appearance that gave my somewhat cluttered countertop an instant upgrade. The Smart Kettle Luxe feels sturdy in hand but remains lightweight at just under 4 pounds. Its compact size, measuring 7""x9.5""x9.9"", is perfectly proportioned, easily fitting under my counter or in my cabinet when not in use. The hinged lid operates smoothly, ensuring no clumsy spills or misaligned closures. There’s something to be said about a kettle that just looks and feels well-made, and this fits that bill perfectly.

**Precision in Temperature Settings**  
Once you begin using this electric kettle, the wow factor becomes evident. It offers five pre-programmed settings designed to brew various kinds of teas like black, green, white, and oolong, alongside an option for French press coffee. The precision is impressive, and it’s something you might not know you need until you experience it. As someone who routinely ruins green tea by over-boiling water, this feature was a game-changer. One simple button press, and it hit the exact temperature needed. No guesswork, and certainly no bitterness in the tea.  

[Ready to buy Breville BKE845BSS1BUS1? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://techieupdate.com/p/b07t23dyjb/)  

**Keep Warm Functionality**  
Another genius addition to the kettle is its ""Keep Warm"" button, which, as the name implies, keeps the water at the ideal temperature for up to 20 minutes. I found this incredibly useful on groggy mornings when I didn’t have my act together. This feature eliminated the need to constantly re-boil water, saving both energy and my patience. Initially, I thought I'd never use this – but trust me, on hectic mornings or during long tea sessions, this proved indispensable.

**Soft-Opening Lid for Your Safety**  
If you’ve ever been burned by steam or splashing, you’ll appreciate the thoughtful engineering here. The soft-opening lid is an intelligent touch that gently releases steam and minimizes splashback. There was this one time my overly curious niece tried to peek into the kettle right after it boiled; thankfully, the lid's design prevented any mishaps. Breville deserves some applause for considering real-world kitchen scenarios like this.

**Cordless Convenience and Rotation Base**  
The cordless design adds a layer of freedom I didn’t know I craved. Not having to awkwardly unplug every time I wanted to pour water felt like a small but meaningful win. Plus, the multi-directional 360-degree base with cord storage wrap made this kettle feel adaptable. I could dock it from any angle and wrap the cord neatly out of sight, keeping my counter aesthetically pleasing.

**Key Benefits**  
- Sophisticated brushed stainless steel design that complements modern kitchens.  
- Five preset brewing temperatures ensure precision for tea and coffee lovers alike.  
- Keep Warm button maintains water temperature for extended periods.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
Despite its advanced features, the Breville Smart Kettle Luxe has a few small quirks worth mentioning:  
- The price point is steep compared to other electric kettles, especially basic models with fewer features.  
- The stainless steel exterior, while sleek, is prone to fingerprint smudges, requiring frequent cleaning to stay pristine.  

**Product Contenders**  
In comparison to rival brands like the Fellow Stagg EKG Electric Kettle, the Breville edges out slightly because of its versatile temperature controls and larger capacity. However, the Fellow Stagg's gooseneck spout is better suited for pour-over brewing enthusiasts. Alternatively, budget options such as the Cuisinart PerfecTemp lose points because they lack the Keep Warm feature and cordless design, but they do come at a much lower price. If you value premium features and ease of use, the Breville Smart Kettle Luxe is a standout choice.

**Worth Every Penny**  
The cost might deter budget-conscious buyers, but for anyone serious about tea, coffee, or just an appliance that adds convenience to their daily routine, this kettle is worth the investment. The sheer functionality coupled with its refined aesthetic makes it a fantastic blend of form and utility.

1lyta9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChildofHoarder/comments/1lyta9v/getting_through_highschool_possibly_moving_out/,getting through highschool + possibly moving out ??,"helloo this is not my main account obv but i really needed someone to talk to about this stuff, and ive been reading a lot of posts on this sub which make me feel a bit less alone in my situation

so, i’m 17 years old, i live with my mum, my uncle and my granddad, who are all hoarders. my mum doesn’t rly get a huge income, so we’ve had to live with relatives for alot of my childhood. pretty much all of my family members struggle with hoarding, and so i don’t really have anywhere else i can go.

i’m currently doing my vce (victorian certificate of education) in australia, my main problem is that i want to finish my final year of highschool and graduate, but the stuff i’ve been going through with my living situation and my mental health is taking a toll on my grades and my motivations to study, and i feel like i can’t tell anyone about the extent of these issues in fear of judgement, especially my friends who are very financially and academically well off.

the hoard i live in probably isn’t as bad as a few people’s on this sub, but i’d describe it as a level 3 or 4. the lounge room is where my mum mostly stays, and it’s full of a lot of useless stuff like old kitchen appliances, broken furniture and stacks of papers, containers full of stuff, ect. we have two couches in the living room, one in which is mostly clear, however the other one is just covered in stuff and completely inaccessible. the coffee table and dining table in the living room are also covered in stuff, as well as the dining table in the kitchen, meaning they are all inaccessible unless you are to move everything onto the floor. (although, the floor is mostly covered in bags and other things.) we also cannot store our two cats’ litter boxes in the laundry because it’s too small, which means my mum opts to keep them UNDER THE KITCHEN TABLE. i’ve tried moving them outside even but she just keeps moving them back in.

the shower in the bathroom is okay, but the bathtub is full of full containers and beauty products as we are unable to fit so much stuff in such a tiny bathroom. there are also boxes of stuff inside the bathroom, and the bathroom sink is often covered in soap or makeup products, toothpaste, or hair?? most of the time i try to clean the sink up at least but it always ends up getting covered in stuff the next day, so it’s getting harder and harder to maintain.

all of the bedrooms in the house are full of stupid stuff like collections of tennis balls, furniture and clothes, and the beds are often dirty or don’t have a proper bedsheet on them. my uncle literally sleeps on foam yoga mats that are on top of his bed. my mum’s room is pretty small and has a lot of clothes and furniture lying around, and the surface of her dresser has a few stains. my granddad’s room is probably the worst of them all, he has the largest bedroom and his own ensuite bathroom, the bathroom is also covered in hair and a few other substances i don’t wanna name. you get the point. 

my room is the cleanest out of all the rooms in the house, i have my own desk and vanity, as well as my bed and shelves. they get a bit cluttered sometimes when i get into depressive episodes, but i’m trying to keep them clear so that i have room to study or draw. the only other issue is that i have way too many clothes that i don’t need, and my mum always yells at me when i try to throw them away. i’ve cleared out my wardrobe many times and have tried to throw out trash bags full of clothes and stuff, but they are currently sitting in the lounge room because my mum won’t get rid of them. i don’t have my own car yet so or anything so i can’t really take them to the thrift myself.

the worst part of all this is that my mum denies having a hoarding problem, and typically ends up blaming me for all the mess around our house. she always tells me that i should help her clean the house up, and i do, but it gets super frustrating to see all that work go to waste because she’ll end up bringing home MORE stuff that we don’t need, making me carry it in for her. and the cycle repeats.
i acknowledge that hoarding is a mental illness, with her struggles with depression and health issues, as well as her work and social life, and i do have empathy for her, but i can’t help but hate her so much sometimes for how she’s made me endure this kind of lifestyle for the most of my childhood, and how it’s affected both my mental health and my cognitive development. i’ve been living in shit like this since i was four years old.

i was even taken away by cps at one point as a child due to reports from my primary school, where i had to stay with my grandma, but even then i was STILL living in a hoard with her, too. 
i’m just sick of having these aimless fantasies of something so simple as four white walls, a desk, and a bed. that’s all i’ve ever really wanted. i don’t want or need luxury at all — i just want peace of mind. 

i’m sorry for such a long rant, but i would just really appreciate any advice or resources to help me through this, maybe some recommendations for alternative housing options, or some personal stories about how you manage studying while living in a hoard. i don’t even have my own job, so it’s kind of impossible for me to pay rent, but i’m trying to work on that so i can at least try and make a steady income and even get youth allowance when i turn 18. anyway, thank you for reading, i’m really grateful for your time and support.",1,1752414573.0,ChildofHoarder,0,1.0,False

1lyt9ic,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1lyt9ic/trying_to_find_the_right_adhd_meds_and_feeling/,Trying to find the right ADHD meds and feeling overwhelmed. Looking for advice on how to discuss this with my psych who wants to prescribe Focalin.,"I (34 NB) received my ADHD diagnosis early last year and in a very ADHD turn of events, took a year to finally start navigating trying meds. I am working to find the best ADHD meds for myself right now but my psych is prescribing a medication I've never heard before which is scaring me/putting me off on trying a new med and I want to get some insight from other people in this space. This is going to be a bit long so thanks for hangin' in there and reading through this.



Some history: I want to start off by saying I have a TON of anxiety around trying any medication, especially any psychiatric medication. My mother had a psychotic episode in her early 40's of unknown origin and watching her navigate so many cocktails of psychiatric medications over a several year scope and the physical and mental difficulties she went through during that time were very hard to watch. Even still, I decided to push forward. I've read so many personal accounts here and chatted with so many friends who have experienced so much relief with ADHD meds that I have been pushing through my fear and discomfort to see if I can find meds that work for me.



Timeline of meds:

* 2020 - Wellbutrin - Tried it for anxiety at the time. Made me feel hypomanic, got rashes, many many meltdowns. Took it for two weeks and stopped abruptly. Very much not for me.
* 2025 - Strattera (Generic 25 mg) - I found a new psych who didn't prescribe stimulants (didn't find that out until $140 and a session later) but I figured I'd give them a shot. After a few days, I felt my brain was super quiet which was LOVELY and everything felt in focus. However, I stopped caring about everything and it was unsettling. My personality felt a bit like a beige wall. I only took it about a week but stopped taking it because I could tell it wasn't for me.

I found another psych who would prescribe stimulants and said he'd start me on one that ""most patients do well on.""

* Vyvanse (Generic 20 mg) - 2 hours in I would feel the meds kicking in and I found myself very task-driven. The chatter in my brain lessened, but I found myself almost hypomanic again. I would text like 5 people at a time. I had SO MANY IDEAS and I felt overwhelmed. I said I felt coked out. Around lunchtime I felt a dip where I would feel VERY antsy, anxious, and irritable. I even had a panic attack one day. I didn't drink any coffee, drank a ton of water, and ate a decent bit of protein including a protein breakfast (thanks to people in this sub for that tip). I would crash mid-day, take a nap, and the rest of the day I felt level and focused. I was able to sleep fine.
* Vyvanse (Generic 10 mg) - I gave this feedback to my psych who said we could put me on the absolute lowest dose. I no longer felt hypomanic. My brain felt clearer, less task-driven, I had some improved focus, and my executive functioning felt great. It still felt like it ""hit hard"" around 2 hours in though and still felt myself get antsy. I felt some benefits of the meds but part of me felt like ""if I feel this intense at the childs dose, I really don't feel like this is the best med for me."" I gave the feedback to my psych who said we could setup a follow up appointment.



So here is where I'm looking for some additional insight. I asked what next steps would be in terms of meds to try out and his recommendation was a medication called Focalin. To be honest I was a little shocked. I mentioned my hesitation very early on about being really anxious about trying different meds for fear of negative effects but I'm really trying to push past my anxiety about it to find something that works. I really do understand you don't know how a med will affect you until you try it and that's part of the process. With that being said, I frequent this subreddit and I had never heard of Focalin. I was certain he was going to prescribe Adderall or Ritalin or Concerta or one of the ones that pops up frequently.



I did a little more digging and see it is a legit med that is prescribed for ADHD.. but I don't feel comfortable taking it. Or at least I don't want my next jump to be this medication. I also have some fear about pushing back about this med. To be honest I just want to try Adderall because most people who I know who are prescribed use that so IDK. maybe there's some level of safety in my brain of correlating ""more people i know anecdotally use this so it's safer."" But again, I'm still pretty new in navigating talking with a psych about meds so I'm not certain how to navigate this conversation. I have shut down and at this point I'm at a standstill regarding trying new meds and it's making me incredibly sad. Any insight on this would be super appreciative. I really do want to find the meds that work best for me.",1,1752414515.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

Our family consists of 2 humans and 2 fur babies. 

We had to go to doggy school and then we had to train Chilli at home because he didn't know he was a dog and was also super overprotective of us. We learned how to dog parent. People, I tell you, a cat is waaay easier. 😅 We didn't have to go to cat school for parenting that one and she turned out fine if not a little spoilt. 🫣😂

Honestly I love both the cat and the dog. 
When we arrive home they both wait for us at the door and I shout 'hi babies!' as I enter and then we hang out. 
We play in the garden and tho both of them have names I use little nicknames for them sometimes, the dog is Chip-Chup or Baby and the cat is Kitten or Baby girl. They both listen to those names too is how often I use them. 
We have a little routine with the dog too that we go for a walk around the garden before we go to bed so he is taking care of his business and looks around like the 3.5 kg guard dog that he is.

Note that we have a tall fence around the back of the house as everyone else in the neighbourhood and it is difficult to see in the gardens. 

Now to the story:
Our new neighbours moved in and hubby met them today in the front of the house (no tall fence there just shrubbery) as he was going somewhere and was in a rush too. They are lovely people and invited us over for coffee sometime. 

But the way they invited us was kind of hilarious. 

They told hubby that they would like to invite him, his wife and they are excited to meet the little one too. 

He was a little stunned but was rushing somewhere so didn't correct them or ask what they meant.

I want someone who gets the silent moments, who’s cool with saying, “I don’t know what I want, but I want this.” Someone who knows there’s no such thing as perfect, just two imperfect people vibing on the same frequency.

**Query:**

Jay’s job is to make stories feel true, even when he’s in them. It’s how he became a star copywriter in Melbourne, and how he's held himself together since a violent incident that destroyed his bond with his younger brother, Jovan.

But when his grandmother falls seriously ill, Jay returns to Singapore after a decade, intending only to stay long enough to say goodbye. Instead, he stumbles across digital traces of Jovan, now a rising esports star who has recently vanished mid-tournament.

Drawn into a search he never meant to start, Jay combs through blog posts, chat logs, and conflicting accounts from teammates. As he reconstructs Jovan's disappearance, he also unearths the emotional wreckage that kept them apart. The trail leads back to the memory he's buried for years, and a truth Jay has edited out of his own story: that what he’s chasing after isn’t a missing brother, but a version of himself that isn’t to blame. If he can’t face the fracture between them, he may lose the chance to make things right, and the version of himself he’s reshaped into something bearable.

YOUR NAME IN PIXELS (65,000 words) is a literary novel told through a blend of narrative and digital fragments. It explores estrangement, identity, and the stories we construct to survive. It may appeal to readers of Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin and Y/N by Esther Yi—novels that interrogate identity, memory, and the line between online and offline selves.

I’m a Singaporean writer based in Melbourne, and this novel draws on personal experiences of diaspora, digital culture, and family loss.

**First 300:**

The call came just before the pitch.

*Mum: Calling....*

I silenced it, shoving the phone into my pocket. She always forgot the time difference, or didn’t care.

Emily was already sliding the boardroom door open. “Jay’s our copy lead,” she said to their marketing director, stepping aside as I walked in. The screen was bright. Everyone looked expectant.

I clicked the remote.

“Picture this.”

Sunlight spilled over the rooftops, the glass and concrete catching gold. We’d spent two days perfecting the drone shot.

“You wake up. The first thing you see are the floor-to-ceiling windows. Not the curtains or blinds, because you didn’t draw them last night. Your apartment is oriented to welcome the day, not make you want to shut it out.”

I took a small step to the side, letting the glow fall on them instead.

“But this isn’t about the building itself. It’s not about square footage, or furnishings. It’s about *you*. Or rather—”

*Click.*

The screen switched, showing a jogger on a tree-lined path. A man making coffee. A child chasing a dog up the stairs. Behind the full-length windows sat the Yarra, quiet and undemanding.

“—the version of you that lives here.”

That got me a smile from the guy in the navy jacket. Emily said he was one of the lead property developers, the kind who signed off on budgets. I knew he’d be the one making the big decisions.

“We’re calling the campaign *Imagine Being You*,” I said. “It’s not a hard sell; it’s an invitation. Think of it as a space that viewers can project themselves into.”

Then my phone started buzzing in my pocket.

I hit the side button without looking. There was a time and place for everything, and she didn’t belong in this space.",1,1752414047.0,PubTips,0,1.0,False

Thought y’all would be proud.,"We lost my 56 year old mom to brain cancer last week. Best of moms. She was deeply religious, but admitted she had issues with things of the church like polygamy and the second anointing, things she's known about in great detail for decades. Her spiritual experiences always trumped the bad stuff though. We always had open talks, but I knew I'd disappoint her if I left. A couple years ago, I came out to her about my faith struggle I've been on for a few years. She wept. She thought she failed as a mom. We had a year's worth of talks, where I tried to separate the church from her mostly awesome parenting. She raised me to be a great person, honestly. It took her a while, but eventually she told me she would love me as a son first, and as God's son second. After that, she stopped asking me to come back to church, and just loved me. Four months later, she had her first stroke, and ten months after that, she passed away.

At the funeral, I shared that story and charged the audience to accept me and their other wayward family members, because love matters more than anything in this life. Love is the high ground. You never know when you or your family members will pass away, so hurry up and fix your issues.

Fun related note, my sister and her husband (and two kids) were kicked out of her in-laws this week because of an argument that started over having a coffee maker in the shared kitchen (that's just the straw that broke the camel's back, but still dumb), so I wrote the message with them in mind.

I was the only one of the talks that didn't end in saying ""in the name of Jesus Christ, amen."" It was awesome. Afterward, I received an outpouring of support from countless people. Many (much more than I expected) friends and family members hugged me and whispered to me that they've been out of the church as well, some of them in secret for years and waiting for the right time to come out. It was scary for me to be that vulnerable in front of everyone, but it was so rewarding to see that I was giving people courage.

So I hope this gives you all courage. There's more of us out there than we think.",58,1752414026.0,exmormon,5,1.0,False
1lyt2e8,https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmint/comments/1lyt2e8/avoided_nvidia_driver_after_flickering_and_boot/,Avoided Nvidia driver after flickering and boot issues — Mint works fine now (Quadro P620),"Just wanted to share my recent Linux Mint ordeal in case it helps someone else with an NVIDIA GPU — especially Quadro users.

I have a Quadro P620 paired with Intel UHD Graphics 630. After doing a fresh install of Linux Mint 21.3 Cinnamon, I started noticing subtle but persistent flickering on my desktop background, while typing, and even on some websites. It looked like some weird graphical twitching or tearing.

Out of habit, I opened Driver Manager and let it install the recommended NVIDIA driver (nvidia-driver-570). That's when things went downhill.

**What happened:**  
Flickering got worse.  
“Night Light” wouldn’t work.  
xrandr was confused — gave gamma errors, couldn't detect outputs properly.  
Eventually, I couldn't boot at all. Got stuck on a black screen or error logs (ath10k\_pci spam, blank screen after Mint logo).  
Tried switching to Intel using prime-select, but that didn’t work — system was already toast by that point.

**I tried:**  
Booting to recovery mode  
Editing GRUB (pcie=noaer and others)  
Deleting xorg.conf (didn't exist)  
Purging nvidia-\*, reinstalling xserver-xorg-video-intel  
Switching to Nouveau

Eventually gave up and did a fresh reinstall of Mint

**What worked:**  
After reinstalling Mint, this time I did not install any NVIDIA driver. I left the Driver Manager set to:  
xserver-xorg-video-nouveau (open-source)  
  
**Lesson:**  
For dual-GPU systems (Intel + NVIDIA), especially when you don’t need the NVIDIA GPU for gaming or compute tasks — it might be safer to **stick with the default Nouveau driver**. Even though it's ""recommended,"" the proprietary NVIDIA driver introduced instability for me.

**Specs:**

* Quadro P620
* Intel UHD 630 (CoffeeLake)
* Linux Mint 21.3 Cinnamon
* Secure Boot: Off
* Boot Mode: UEFI
* Display: 1080p external monitor

For a little background info- J and I have been friends for a little over 3 years. We used to hang out a ton at the beginning of our friendship but had a falling out due to her previous abusive relationship. We then made up about a month later and continued hanging out a lot. She then got pregnant not too long after and because her BD wasn’t the best I was helping her with the pregnancy a little. Her BD and I had issues with one another and I made a “call out post” on FB about him. Everything was fine but, about a month later she blocked me randomly so we didn’t talk for about a year. 

It’s important to note J has always had quite a bit of misfortune in her life. From relationships to housing situations and little things in between, things just don’t seem to go well for her in general. So after the no contact year I see her post in one of our community pages on FB about being in a bad situation and needing help. I can’t remember what it was she needed at the time but, I do remember I was able to help her with it. So I PMed her and basically said, “I know we have our differences but, I can help you if you’d like.” She then messaged back and basically said she was going through really hard mental time while pregnant and blocked me because she was pushing everyone away. We talked it out and are now friends again.

We have been friends since then for about 6 months. Within that time I have helped her:
Move to a new apartment (while 6 months pregnant)
Given her things for her apartment (coffee table, blankets, pillows, storage boxes and wall tacks)
Paid over $300 to help her get out of debt on her phone bill (and not expected any payment back)
Gone to her house several times to hang out (both while pregnant and with a newborn)

I was happy to do all these things and still am as I love helping the people I care about. The problem comes in here. I have invited J to several events since us being friends again. I have invited her to my home, gender reveal/birthday party, baby shower, then my new home. Every time I invite her she always tells me with the bigger events that “she has bad social anxiety and can’t do big crowds.” And with the smaller events she always has a reason she can’t come over (ie: needs to do laundry, needs to go DoorDash). That’s perfectly fine as I don’t want to force anyone to do anything they don’t want to. BUT THEN J is always posting all over online about how she needs to make friends and wants to have friends she can go do things with. She is also always posting about wanting to go to the bars with people. But then she always posts about how she needs money and is struggling so bad. It’s just really bothering me but I also don’t want to lose this friendship. It makes it worse she just broke up with her other best friend.

1lysyua,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ihmconnect_official/comments/1lysyua/how_to_build_a_strong_homeschool_connection/,How to Build a Strong Home–School Connection,"A strong home-school connection is one of the most powerful contributors to student success. **When families and schools work hand in hand, students not only perform better academically but also develop stronger social and emotional skills**. Building this bridge of collaboration is not about grand gestures - it’s about consistent, intentional actions that foster trust and mutual respect.

In the fast-evolving world of education, one truth remains timeless: **students flourish when families and schools work hand-in-hand.** The partnership between parents and educators plays a crucial role in shaping not only a child’s academic journey but also their emotional, social, and personal growth.

While curriculum, technology, and teaching methods are vital, they cannot replace the impact of a supportive home-school connection. And the good news? Building this bridge doesn’t require grand programs or massive resources - **it requires consistent, intentional actions rooted in trust and mutual respect.**

Here are five impactful ways to create and sustain a meaningful home–school connection:

# 1. Open, Ongoing Communication

Effective communication forms the backbone of any strong relationship  and that includes the one between home and school. It’s important for schools to keep families regularly informed not just about student performance, but also about classroom activities, school goals, and important decisions.

**Communication should be two-way.** Parents must feel heard just as much as teachers should feel supported. Whether it’s through emails, mobile apps, parent-teacher meetings, or a simple phone call, **ensure communication is clear, friendly, and regular - not just when something goes wrong.**

We can ensure the ongoing communication with these steps:

* **Regular Updates**: Share not only academic progress but also classroom activities, upcoming events, school goals, and policy changes.
* **Multiple Channels**: Utilize emails, mobile apps, newsletters, social media, parent portals, or even traditional phone calls to stay connected.
* **Two-Way Conversations**: Encourage parents to share their concerns, insights, and feedback. When parents feel heard, they’re more likely to stay engaged and supportive.

When communication flows freely both ways, a culture of transparency and partnership flourishes, ensuring parents feel like valued stakeholders in their child’s education.

# 2. Empower Parents as Partners

Parents are not just observers in their child's educational journey -they are partners. Schools should actively invite families **to contribute ideas, participate in school committees, volunteer in classrooms, or co-create learning goals**.

Workshops, orientation programs, and skill-building sessions can help parents understand how to support learning at home. **When parents are equipped with tools and information, they feel more confident, respected, and invested in their child’s growth.**

Schools must create avenues where families feel welcomed, involved, and empowered to contribute meaningfully.

* **Participation Opportunities**: Invite parents to join school committees, volunteer for classroom activities, or help organize events.
* **Workshops & Orientation Programs**: Offer sessions that help parents understand school curricula, modern teaching methods, and strategies to support learning at home.
* **Shared Learning Goals**: Involve parents in setting realistic academic and personal growth targets for their children.

When parents are equipped with knowledge and tools, they become confident collaborators, better able to support their child's learning both inside and outside the classroom.

# 3. Timely Alerts & Feedback Loops

Waiting for the end of the term to update parents on academic performance or behavior concerns is too late. Real-time alerts -whether academic, behavioral, or attendance-related help keep families in the loop and allow for immediate action.

Feedback shouldn’t only come from teachers. **Encouraging parents to share their observations at home - such as learning challenges, interests, or emotional changes** creates a feedback loop that benefits the student in both settings.

Timely, ongoing feedback allows both school and home to address challenges proactively.

* **Real-Time Notifications**: Share updates on attendance, academic performance, behavioral concerns, or classroom participation regularly.
* **Parent Observations**: Encourage parents to provide insights from home — changes in behavior, learning struggles, or newfound interests that may influence classroom performance.
* **Collaborative Solutions**: Use this two-way feedback to create personalized support plans that address the unique needs of each student.

This continuous feedback loop ensures that problems are identified early, solutions are jointly developed, and student success remains at the center.

# 4. Celebrate Small Wins Together

**Academic milestones and exam results are important, but so are the little victories** \-like a shy student participating in class or someone showing kindness to a peer. Celebrating these small wins with families fosters positivity and reminds them that progress comes in many forms.

**Sharing photos, quick notes, or even a class newsletter with highlights can go a long way** in creating pride and motivation, both for the student and their family.

While major achievements like exam scores and academic awards are important, the smaller victories along the way deserve equal celebration.

* **Recognize Everyday Successes**: A child overcoming shyness, showing kindness, or making steady improvement in a subject are all wins worth acknowledging.
* **Share with Families**: Send home positive notes, quick messages, photos, or class newsletters highlighting student accomplishments.
* **Build Positive Reinforcement**: Celebrating these moments builds confidence, motivates students, and strengthens the emotional bond between home and school.

Such positive reinforcement reassures families that their child’s unique progress is seen, valued, and nurtured.

# 5. Community Building Through Events

Events like parent–teacher meetings, open houses, cultural days, reading sessions, or even virtual coffee chats help transform schools from formal institutions into welcoming communities.

**These events create shared experiences, allowing families to connect not just with staff but with each other.** They also serve as opportunities to reinforce the school’s values, build trust, and make families feel they belong.

Beyond academics, schools thrive as strong communities. Creating spaces where families can gather, share, and participate fosters a deeper sense of belonging.

* **Engage Through Events**: Organize parent–teacher meetings, cultural celebrations, reading days, workshops, and virtual coffee chats.
* **Encourage Connections**: Give parents opportunities to connect not just with teachers but with each other, creating a supportive parent network.
* **Reinforce School Values**: Use these gatherings to communicate the school’s mission, celebrate diversity, and build collective trust.

When families feel like an integral part of the school community, they become stronger allies in the educational process.

# Conclusion

A strong home-school connection doesn’t happen by accident. **It’s built day by day through honest communication, shared responsibilities, timely support, and celebrations of progress.** When schools and families come together as a team, the result is a thriving environment where every child has the opportunity to reach their full potential.

Together, we educate better. By keeping communication lines open, empowering parents, offering timely feedback, celebrating progress, and fostering a sense of community, **we ensure that every child has the foundation they need to thrive academically, socially, and emotionally.**

They're entirely based on how I perceived them, I know fragrances are subjective, so please don't send any hate 😅🙏

1. Zimaya Coco: definitely a nice gourmand. But I didn't get any hit of coco in it. Nada. It's sweet in the beginning and then gets slightly spicy after a while. Good for folks who don't like cloyingly sweet gourmands. For me, it's a 3.5/5.
2. Zimaya Caramel: think Eclaire, but stronger and more intense. It's more caramel-y than lactonic, which is the case with Eclaire. And it stays for a while too! I'll probably get a full sized of this in the future because I like how it's close to Eclaire but doesn't need that extra maceration for the plastic-y smell to disappear. 4.3/5.
3. Cloud Candy: very, very sweet. Too sweet for me, tbh. I think it's sweeter than YBM as well, and it didn't last as long on me as I'd have wanted. Probably won't go for this again. 3.5/5.
4. Khamrah Qahwa: I was very excited for this because of the added coffee note, but alas, all I got was spice. I feel OG Khamrah is a more sophisticated fragrance than this. But it lasts very long. 3.7/5.

1lysxuq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1lysxuq/these_5_fearbusting_chatgpt_prompts_turned_my/,These 5 Fear-Busting ChatGPT Prompts Turned My Anxiety Into My Superpower,"I have been running from my fears for years until I realized they were actually breadcrumbs leading to everything I wanted most. These prompts don't eliminate fear, they teach you to read it like a GPS system pointing toward your next level of growth.

Used ChatGPT to decode the secret language of my anxiety and discovered that every single fear was protecting something I desperately needed to reclaim. Now I get excited when I feel scared because I know it means I'm about to level up.

These prompts turn your fears into data instead of drama. Prepare to completely flip your relationship with being afraid.

1. The Fear Audit
```
""Help me create a complete inventory of what I'm currently avoiding in my life. Let's categorize these avoidances by theme like what patterns do you see? Are these fears about rejection, failure, success, judgment, or something else? For each category, help me identify what I'm actually trying to protect and what I'm sacrificing to maintain that protection.""
```

This prompt revealed that 80% of my avoidance was actually fear of my own power. ChatGPT helped me see that I wasn't afraid of failing, but I was afraid of succeeding and having to live up to a new version of myself. The conversation made me realize I'd been staying small to avoid the responsibility that comes with being capable.

2. The Future Self Confrontation
```
""I want you to help me imagine my future self 5 years from now if I keep avoiding the thing I'm most scared of. Paint a detailed picture like what opportunities will I have missed? What will I regret? How will I feel about myself? Then flip it, what if I face this fear head-on? What becomes possible? Make both scenarios vivid and specific.""
```

Absolutely brutal but necessary. ChatGPT helped me visualize exactly what my life would look like if I kept avoiding public speaking vs. if I leaned into it. The ""avoidance future"" was so depressing that facing the fear suddenly felt like the easier option. Sometimes you need to scare yourself into courage.

3. The Fear Mentor
```
""Help me identify someone I admire who has faced and overcome a similar fear to mine. What do I imagine they felt before they broke through? What would they tell me about this fear? Now let's role-play, have a conversation with them where they coach me through my specific situation. What questions would they ask? What would they challenge me on?""
```

This one was wild because ChatGPT helped me channel my business hero's mindset about risk-taking. The imaginary conversation made me realize that the people I admire aren't fearless, they're just better at using fear as fuel. The role-play gave me specific phrases and mindset shifts that I still use when I'm scared.

4. The Micro-Courage Experiment
```
""Help me design the smallest possible step I could take toward my fear that would still count as progress. Something so small that my brain can't rationalize avoiding it. What would be the tiniest version of facing this fear? Now help me plan exactly when and how I'll do this micro-step, and what I'll do immediately after to celebrate the win.""
```
Game-changer. ChatGPT helped me realize that my fear of networking didn't require going to a huge event, it could start with commenting on one LinkedIn post. The micro-step was so small it felt ridiculous NOT to do it. That one comment led to a coffee meeting, which led to a consulting gig, which led to me completely changing careers.

5. The Fear Archaeology

""I want you to help me excavate the deeper fear underneath my obvious fear. If I'm afraid of public speaking, what am I really afraid of? If I'm afraid of starting a business, what's the fear beneath that fear? Keep digging until we hit the core fear that's driving everything else. What is this really about?""
```
This prompt absolutely destroyed my assumptions about what I was afraid of. ChatGPT kept asking ""but what would that mean about you?"" until we discovered that my fear of ""looking stupid"" was actually a fear of being abandoned, that if people saw my flaws, they'd leave. Once I understood the real fear, I could address it directly instead of dancing around symptoms.

My Thoughts:
These conversations completely rewired my relationship with fear. Instead of seeing anxiety as something to eliminate, I now see it as valuable intel about where I need to grow next. Fear became my personal development GPS system.

The crazy part? ChatGPT doesn't minimize your fears or give you generic pep talks. It helps you understand the sophisticated emotional logic behind your avoidance patterns. Once you see the system, you can work with it instead of fighting it.

Three of these prompts led to me taking action within 48 hours. One of them helped me realize that my ""fear of commitment"" was actually excitement about finally knowing what I wanted. Another made me understand that my social anxiety was just underdeveloped social skills, not a personality flaw.

Try these and share your feedback on what you discover about your fear patterns, I'm genuinely curious if other people find their fears are actually pointing toward what they want most too.

Concluding tip: Don't try to overcome fear during these conversations. Focus first on understanding what your fears are trying to tell you. ChatGPT is incredible at helping you see the hidden intelligence in your emotional responses.

1lyswfv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lyswfv,I am on my way to create programming language and write a kernel.,"**INTRO**  
Hello, world. I am Suzuha, 20 y.o., and I am wasting my life 😂. Bruh, that was a joke; I don't think so. Today I am going to show you my programming language syntax and talk a bit about future plans. 

I haven't read the dragon book or any other books about compilers; I just know the general theory of programming and how it works, and I don't think about how people usually do stuff like this but how I CAN do it. And it works.

My programming language is called ""*Americano*"", like coffee.   

My compiler produces .asm (nasm dialect) for ""-intel"" architecture flags and .s (as aka gnu assembler) for ""-arm"" architecture flag. Now I am working hard on ""-intel-bin"" and ""-arm-bin"" architecture flags systems that will produce processor opcodes for intel x86 (and x86\_64) and arm v8 architectures and load it to RAM memory instead of creating binary( or executable) file. 

Another hard task is ""difficult"" math operations for example: 

    b = b + a - 1;

need to generate a large amount of assembler commands and tons of processor opcodes... so I am working at day and  at night to make It work correctly and faster.  
**Compiler will have closed source code but free to use for everyone.**  

  
**SYNTAX**  
Syntax C like a bit and will be very easy to learn language.

here's one simple program example:

    ───────┬────────────────────────────────────────
           │ File: program.content                 
    ───────┼────────────────────────────────────────

       2   │ program                                   
       3   │ [raw]                                  
       4   │ int main(){                            
       5   │     int8 a = 0x08;                     
       6   │     int16 b = b + a;        // U.B. for test.                                 
       7   │     int8 cable = 0;                    
       8   │                                        
       9   │     cycle:                             
      10   │                                        
      11   │     a = a + 1;                         
      12   │     nequ(a, 0xff){                     
      13   │         goto cycle;                    
      14   │     }                                  
      15   │                                        
      16   │     b = b + a;                         
      17   │     a = -1 * (a - b);                  
      18   │     b = b - a;                         
      19   │ }                                      
      20   │

    ───────┴────────────────────────────────────────

As you can see there's nothing hard to understand.

Language have it's own specific commands like: 

    nequ(a, 0xff){
    ...
    }  

**nequ = not equals.** So it'll do code in brackets if a not equal 0xff.  
**equ = equals.** 

**VARIABLES**   
Can be used with or without specifying of size. 

Boolean variables are bool, **bit** and **trit (0, 1, -1 states)**.

Int, Int8 - Int64 are integer types. 

char for symbols. 

and etc.   
**Later I'll write simple manual for programming in Americano language.** 

**FUTURE**

***As soon as I will be ready to release early access alpha version of compiler I'll start writing my own (unix like, source based) Operation System kernel.***

1lysvp7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1lysvp7/i_let_myself_feel_everything/,I let myself feel everything,"Yesterday I had a bad flair up of OCD symptoms. In the past, it would be a reason to reach for the drink just to have a moment’s peace of mind. We even met friends at a brewery just to get out of the house, and though I was tempted for a moment, I never really wanted the drink. I played it forward and knew how awful I’d feel in the morning and how much worse it would make everything, so I never got that beer. So so thankful this morning, as my OCD symptoms have lessened and I sit here drinking coffee watching my 6 month old play. 

My husband has also decided to stop drinking (though he was never that bad) and it’s made it so much easier. I never thought he’d hop on board with me since he didn’t really have an issue with alcohol. I held out hope that him seeing the benefits I’m now reaping would encourage him, but I decided not to let that be my deciding factor. Well, now he’s decided to stop and we feel closer than ever. I’m so proud of him!

1lysv4v,https://i.redd.it/gy7e8qfr8ncf1.jpeg,HOW TO BECOME A FANCY WAITER IN LESS THAN 20 MINUTES: actual handbook,"*Written 1/12/25*

Rule #1 : As with anything in life, CARE and show COMPASSION. Be FRIENDLY and WELCOMING to your new teammates/guests.

Even if you are brand new to the industry, surely you have dined in a restaurant before. LOOK AROUND. Anything obviously out of place, what can make it better? Pretend your friends/family are coming in and you want it to be impressively nice for them.


ASK QUESTIONS if you are unsure about anything. Never guess an answer. Soon you will be acclimated and able to answer more than you think.

Be PATIENT with yourself while you are learning something new. Expect others, especially guests with high expectations to come off as rude but just breathe through it - they don’t know your life, all you are capable of and all you will do.

CONFIDENCE in COMPETENCE. Assure yourself that while there is a lot to know and definitely hard work, any able-bodied person can carry a tray or write down an order.  

51% from Sweetbitter book. While anyone can work, the 51% are able to anticipate needs without the guest having to ask. Ex: noticing they need a refill or new/extra silverware (steak knife/soup spoon)

You have back of house (chefs), front of house (servers/host/bartender), but cannot have a restaurant without the HEART OF HOUSE (dishwasher)

Also as in life, treat others as you want to be treated and never assume you know someone’s situation. Even if they tell you about it, your perception doesn’t cover it. Work equally and HAVE FUN.

Teammate / Captain / Ship / Wave references


EMPTY YOUR MIND of everything but fine dining and breathing. 
With the amount of stimulus coming in on a daily basis plus what you’re about to go through this shift.. practice taking 5-20 minutes before to clear your mind and give it a rest. Prepare your body by stretching as well.
Visualize walking into work. Although it may be hectic, imagine a suspiciously smooth situation where your team is all aligned and on top of it all. EVERYTHING ZEN 
PRACTICE YOGA - the balance and how graceful you are on the mat directly translates to your patience and how you carry yourself.

Be sure to decompress after your shift as well. Release the events of the day and anything making you worry about tomorrow. Give yourself proper recharge time. Not only for yourself, also to give that better self to everyone around you. *NOTE* nobody likes Jen on 5 cups of coffee, not even her. It also took 15 years of creating an alter ego (server Jen/ Director of Fun & Sun) to talk to people at work before a Life Coach told me I’m an introvert (shocker) and the kind that shouldn’t deal with people for more than 3 hours/day. oops... so if that resonates at all, make sure you rest for your whole soul and find the environments you thrive in. For me, it’s behind a lap top with coffee.



Having a heart for hospitality - our joy lives in the happiness of others. Take pride in your work and provide a seemingly effortless guest experience. 
PLAY RESTAURANT - although tensions get high and stressful, frequently zoom out and recognize this is just a couple of crazy hours. Pretend it’s a game and you’re SIMply playing a wild level. Finding the flow and seeing yourself progress is super satisfying.

So what’s my motivation...?
Keep your creative window open to the possibilities of life and the opportunities that can come. 30 seconds can make or break someone’s day. 
One table can change everything
Maybe you’ll meet someone.....
Remember what you came here for.



*corny one liner reminders*
- TEAM WORK MAKES THE DREAM WORK
- Clean as you go (it’s the sign of a pro!
- Set up for success (yourself and others)
- Full Hands In, Full Hands Out (what else can you take from the kitchen/bring back out with you)

- Carry a napkin if possible (NOT in your back pocket)
- Guests are most aware when they first sit down and want to leave, be extra attentive at these times. *I’m going to get a good review from this table*
- Maintain a well-manicured appearance. (look good = feel good)
- Think how you’re presenting yourself
- If you mess up, apologize and fix it
- Act like everyone can hear you!! You never freaking know who is around the corner or can hear through a wall. Never discuss or show money or bash guests. 
- IT’S NOT WORTH IT! Shortcuts always get pushback and the consequences of doing something wrong aren’t worth it. ",15,1752413402.0,Serverlife,2,0.86,False

Only 3rd time ceremonial duty has been carried out by soldiers from outside U.K. A mounted ceremonial guard at Horse Guards, the official entrance to the royal palaces or riding down streets in central London is a familiar sight — and for the next eight days, Canadian soldiers will carry out the duties. Members of Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians), a tank regiment of the Canadian Armed Forces based in Edmonton, were invited by King Charles and took over duties as the King's Life Guard on Friday. It's been a tradition for nearly 400 years and one the Canadians are proud to take on. ""It's quite an honour to be asked to come over here, to participate, to be able to help support, to have the riders come and do the ceremonial task for our sovereign,"" Maj. Colin Peterson, the officer commanding C Squadron with Lord Strathcona's Horse, told the CBC's Anna Cunningham.

[Almost $50 million in cocaine found hidden in trucks](https://archive.is/6k5y6) crossing into Canada from U.S., police say. A cross-border drug smuggling network using commercial truck drivers to haul large loads of cocaine across the border from the United States into Canada has been revealed by police in southern Ontario, leading to the arrest of nine men and the seizure of 479 kilograms of bulk cocaine bricks. More than a third of the cocaine was caught at the border, reflecting a significant trend in the flow of drugs: from Mexico into the United States and then smuggled into Canada hidden aboard commercial transport trucks. The importations were destined for Peel Region, located to the west and northwest of Toronto and encompassing the cities of Mississauga and Brampton and the town of Caledon. It is a large commercial trucking and distribution point, and home to the Toronto Pearson International Airport.

Alberta is rolling out new regulations this fall banning transgender athletes from playing women’s sports, but the province will still welcome out-of-province transgender competitors. Tourism and Sport Minister Andrew Boitchenko said the discrepancy is out of his hands. “We don’t have authority to regulate athletes from different jurisdictions,” he said in an interview. In a follow-up statement, ministry spokeswoman Vanessa Gomez added it’s due to outside sporting organizations being bound by out-of-province or international guidelines.

Half of requests for complex [dental work are being rejected](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/dental-care-expansion-growing-pains-1.7583230) under national insurance plan. As federal dental care expands to cover most uninsured Canadians, providers say some procedures are being bogged down by paperwork and processing delays. Health Canada says 52 per cent of requests for pre-authorized dental work between November 2024 and June 2025 have been rejected. While the vast majority of claims don't need pre-authorization, it's required for more complex and often more expensive procedures, like crowns or partial dentures. Clinics must submit extra documentation like X-rays and dental charts to show the work is medically necessary before it can be covered and completed. ""There's been a lot of confusion for dentists who send in what we would normally send in to a private plan, and it comes back rejected,"" said Dr. Bruce Ward, a Vancouver dentist and president of the Canadian Dental Association. ""It's a much, much, much higher rejection rate than private plans.""

[Toronto risks losing $30M in federal funding](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-sixplexes-federal-funding-1.7581867) after vote against sixplexes citywide. At its meeting on June 25, city council debated the motion to approve sixplexes in all parts of the city, but that was amended by councillors who approved maintaining permissions for fourplexes citywide while limiting sixplex construction in eight Toronto-East York district wards and Ward 23 (Scarborough North), where a pilot is already in place. In March, then-federal housing minister Nate Erskine-Smith warned Toronto Mayor Olivia Chow that any deviation from a citywide policy permitting sixplexes would result in 25 per cent less federal funding, which translates to almost $30 million of the total $118 million that Ottawa has pledged annually to Toronto from its Housing Accelerator Fund, a program that provides incentive funding for cities to build more homes. Gregor Robertson, Canada's new housing minister, has not indicated whether he will follow his predecessor's lead. In a statement to CBC News on Thursday, a spokesperson said the federal government is working with Toronto to meet its sixplex goals. ""The Housing Accelerator Fund rewards ambitious housing initiatives from local governments, with a focus on reducing bureaucracy, zoning restrictions, and other red tape. We are working closely with the city of Toronto to meet these goals and remain ready to work with all levels of governments to tackle the housing crisis,"" said spokesperson Mohammad Hussain. Allowing sixplexes would mark a ""significant milestone"" in meeting Toronto's commitments under the federal Housing Accelerator Fund to allow more low-rise, multi-unit housing development through as-of-right zoning bylaws in its neighbourhoods, according to a report by Toronto's chief planner from last month.

A federal judge on Friday found that the Department of Homeland Security has been making stops and arrests in Los Angeles immigration raids without probable cause and ordered the department to stop detaining individuals based solely on race, spoken language or occupation. US District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, ordered that DHS must develop guidance for officers to determine “reasonable suspicion” outside of the apparent race or ethnicity of a person, the language they speak or their accent, “presence at a particular location” such as a bus stop or “the type of work one does.”

Allowed inside, [lawmakers split on conditions for detainees](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/allowed-lawmakers-split-conditions-alligator-alcatraz-rcna218498) in 'Alligator Alcatraz'. Democratic lawmakers condemned Florida’s new Everglades immigration detention center after visiting Saturday, describing it as crowded, unsanitary and bug-infested. Republicans on the same tour said they saw nothing of the sort at the remote facility that officials have dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.” The state-arranged tour came after some Democrats were blocked earlier from viewing the 3,000-bed detention center that the state rapidly built on an isolated airstrip surrounded by swampland. So many state legislators and members of Congress turned up Saturday that they were split into multiple groups. “There are really disturbing, vile conditions and this place needs to be shut the hell down,” U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, told reporters after visiting the tents, trailers and temporary buildings. “This place is a stunt, and they’re abusing human beings here.” Although the visitors said they were not able to speak with the detainees, Rep. Maxwell Alejandro Frost, also a Democrat, said one called out “I’m an American citizen!” and others chanted “Libertad!,” Spanish for “freedom.” State Sen. Blaise Ingoglia, a Republican from Florida, countered that he had seen a well-run, safe facility where the living quarters were clean and the air conditioning worked well.

[Trump faces a revolt from his MAGA base](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-faces-revolt-maga-base-epstein-files-rcna218385) over the Epstein files. Trump pulled the rug out from his base Saturday evening when he released a lengthy social media post that completely dismissed the importance of the issue, which has consumed the right for the past week — and longer. “For years, it’s Epstein, over and over again,” Trump posted on Truth Social, blaming the files on Democrats. “Why are we giving publicity to Files written by Obama, Crooked Hillary, Comey, Brennan, and the Losers and Criminals of the Biden administration.” Trump’s supporters have gone along with him through every scandal and policy shift. When he made a decision, his base backed him. But the Epstein issue is challenging this alliance like never before. This week, the Justice Department said it would not release any additional files related to the case of the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein died in 2019 while in custody, and a medical examiner ruled his death a suicide. He was facing sex trafficking and conspiracy charges. Attorney General Pam Bondi released a two-page memo saying that the department’s review turned up no “client list” of powerful men who allegedly participated in Epstein’s schemes, and there was no “credible evidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals.” The memo enraged Trump supporters, who quickly turned on Bondi, a sentiment clearly felt at the Student Action Summit.

More than 1,300 employees were forced out of the State Department on Friday, leaving their offices with small boxes of plants and old coffee mugs and taking with them decades of specialized skills and on-the-job training as part of the United States diplomatic corps.The massive overhaul of the federal agency has been in the works for months, with the Trump administration informing Congress in late May that thousands of State Department employees would lose their jobs as part of the largest reorganization of the department in decades. Still, the details of whose jobs would be cut remained closely held, and many were shocked to find they were a part of the 15% cut to domestic agency staff. Several career employees who unexpectedly found themselves with pink slips told NBC News they were asked to write speeches and prepare talking points for political appointees on critical issues just days before.

1lystjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Codependency/comments/1lystjl/breaking_up_after_11_years_a_story_of_drug/,Breaking up after 11 years : a story of drug addicts and codependency.,"It's been 6 days since my breakup, and I need to tell my story. If you have any help, comments, questions, feel free. I’ll take all the help I can get.

To give some context, we’re both 30 years old, and we had been together since we were 19.

I grew up with a single mom, with little money and bad relationships with men. My father died when I was 11 months old. I saw many people in my family who were addicted to alcohol or weed. I’ve always been anxious and hypersensitive, with big self-esteem issues and a fear of abandonment. Since my teenage years, I started feeling depression. But I escaped into reading, into video games. Anything not to feel the social anxiety of adolescence, largely caused by my food addiction that made me weigh over 100kg. And then I discovered weed, which allowed me to mask that social anxiety. I lost 30kg by replacing my food addiction with my weed addiction. I made my first friends, first loves. My first parties, drunken nights, drugs. After all these experiences, the only addictions I have left are nicotine, weed, and coffee.

She grew up in a strict and well-off family. Her parents haven’t gotten along for years. Her mother is bipolar, and her father works too much. She often had to take on the role of caregiver in her household, and be the mother of her own mother. It traumatized her for life; even today, her relationship with her mother is troubled. She also has big self-esteem issues, and a great fear of abandonment.

We found each other because her friends became close with my friends. From the first day, I remember how her gaze and her smile pierced the room. And by talking to her, I discovered that she was also an extremely sensitive, funny, and intelligent person. An exceptional person. I asked a mutual friend if she was available. She had been in a relationship for 4 years, with someone who had been emotionally abusing her for a long time, but she stayed. So I told myself that even if she wasn’t available, I still wanted to have her in my life as friend, because the connection we had was special. Anyway, I was completely addicted to weed and she wouldn’t want to date someone like me, she who smokes just for fun.

Time went by and we became closer and closer friends. At first, we would just hang out to smoke joints and laugh, but we had a much deeper connection that we couldn’t deny. But I respected her too much to try anything while she was in a relationship. And then one day, I learned she had broken up. It was her last summer in the area, she was going to move, and she wanted to enjoy it before leaving. We talked a lot, but I didn’t want to go too fast, or rush her. Slowly, emotional and physical intimacy built between us. The attraction between us was undeniable. During parties, if there was nowhere to sleep, we would volunteer to sleep together, even if we didn’t touch yet.

And then one day, at a party, I kissed her, and it was fireworks. We couldn’t stop kissing, and that night, even though nothing happened, we slept wrapped in each other’s arms. After that, my extreme attraction for her was obvious, I was in love. But she was going to leave for another city. I didn’t want to rush her, but I still wanted to maintain the relationship. One night, before she left, I invited her to smoke some joints and watch *Dead Poets Society*. I was so innocent and a virgin that I didn’t realize where it was leading, but as the bagpipes from the credits played, she jumped on me to kiss me and make love to me. I told her I was a virgin. It surprised her, but she continued this unforgettable moment.

At that time, I still had a lot of jealousy issues. I was devoured by the feeling that I wasn’t enough and that as soon as she moved away, she would forget about her sex friend. So I asked her to be in a relationship on Facebook. Yes, I know, it’s cringe. I’ve heard that enough from her over the years, when she told me I pressured her at the beginning of the relationship.

We did a year of long distance, and even though the distance was hard, the connection we had helped us endure it. I visited. She visited. We talked all the time. But that summer, we were volunteers at a festival, doing a tough job. On the last day, I wanted to quit and begged her to quit with me, but she’s too loyal. She went to work alone and I abandoned her because I didn’t have the strength to party while working, all without smoking weed. This caused a lot of friction between us for a long time. I now realize it's because we were both codependent, and that was the first time I had put my needs above hers. 

At the end of that year, she came back to our first city, to be closer to me and her friends. But that year, I had to repeat my university year and I lost my apartment. Weed didn’t help. But she took me in, even though she had a small apartment just for her, and she was in the hardest year of her life for her studies. That created friction between us, especially since I had few classes to retake and too much time. Too much time to smoke. But when we questioned our consumption, all those thoughts went up in smoke with the next puff.

Then things got better for me, even though I was still completely addicted to weed. I started doing better in school thanks to her support. I started learning to eat more than the same three dishes. I started exercising. We were happy to move in together, to get a place of our own. We had some beautiful years.

Until she was transferred to another city, and I had one year of studies left. Finding ourselves so far apart, after being so fused, caused a lot of turmoil in our relationship. We also had unresolved issues that we hadn't fully forgiven each other for. We started emotionally cheating, looking for the happiness the other no longer gave us in new relationships. That created distance and resentment between us. We almost broke up. But we told ourselves that we’d been together since so young, maybe we needed to explore other relationships and open the couple. We tried. But I was jealous when she told me about dancing in clubs with men. She was jealous when she learned that a distant acquaintance had asked me to sleep with her after hearing our couple was open. So we decided to be exclusive again. But the break was already there.

After these tumultuous months, I finished my studies and got my dream internship, in the city where she lived. It couldn’t have been better, but my moving date coincided with COVID. For months, maybe a year, we were isolated together, smoking, suffering together, playing video games, talking about the absurdity of life, ordering Uber Eats. And life gradually became normal again. She managed to go out again and live her life without smoking, even if it was the first thing she did when she got home.

As for me, I sank deeper into addiction and depression. I saw her start to emotionally cheat on me with another man. He’s retired and old, and he wanted to marry her. She found in him the confidence I no longer gave her. I told myself it was okay because I knew she was my life partner and that she would come back, but anxiety and depression took over and I ended up quitting the job I had gotten thanks to the internship I loved so much. I thought it would help me feel better. But it was worse. It was the beginning of two years of unemployment, depression, and worse addiction than ever. Little by little, she watched me self-destruct. She didn’t want to make love to me anymore because I was too fat, so I only ate one meal a day for a year. I know it worried her, but I was also feeding off her worry. I stopped taking care of my teeth, or my appearance in any way. And I let myself sink into escapism. Bit by bit, I felt her drift away from me. I felt she stayed with me because she had no sense of boundaries, and she made too many sacrifices for me, but I told myself it was OK because we were life partners, and we made sacrifices for each other.

During these years of unemployment, I had become her servant: cooking for her, cleaning the apartment, doing her laundry. She didn’t ask for it, but I knew she was making so many sacrifices to live with me in that state that I did it. And she was grateful for it. She had a tough job and a lot of pressure, and I always took care of her and listened to her. 

She also made a lot of sacrifices for my addiction. Not seeing her family, her friends. Not going on vacation. Not going out on weekends. Not enjoying life. Sure, she was with me smoking, but she always had a stronger life drive than me and was able to stop at some points, contrary to me. 

We only lived in sacrifice for one another. Neglecting our own happiness. Things started to get better 6 months ago, because I got a job again and started taking care of myself. But addiction still ruled my life. Less than before, but still way too much. And a month ago, I was fired from my job. Weed didn’t help, even if there were other external reasons. It caused big sparks between us. She told me she was finally happy since she had regained more independence in the apartment, but now she couldn’t help feeling angry and sad at me because I was going to fall back into the state I was in before. During this time, I also realized she was starting to emotionally cheat on me with a new person. When they were texting, it felt like she was finally happy. That's why I let her do it. And also because I'm too codependent to let go of something bad for me. I told her for the hundredth time that I would work on myself, but as usual, it lasted two weeks before we went back to our toxic habits with each other.

During this last month, we stopped kissing and touching. Deep down I knew things weren’t right. But I kept escaping into weed. She did too, but since weed is too tied to me, she escaped into alcohol with her friends.

Until this last weekend everything seemed fine...or at least, that’s what I told myself in my denial. And then, this last weekend, I saw that she was apathetic, distant, like I’d never seen her.

 And IT happened 6 days ago. It was Monday. She was supposed to leave Wednesday for at least 10 days of vacation. She told me it was better for us to break up. That she needed to work on herself, that I needed to work on myself. But that together, we were just crutches for each other, and with a crutch, we couldn’t learn to walk on our own.

My world collapsed instantly. I thought of a million options, but instead of speaking, I listened. I realized the problems we’d been hiding from ourselves for too long. After her explanation, we both agreed that breaking up was the best option. I even told her I was proud of her for having the courage to put herself first. She wants to stay friends, though, because I’m her best friend, and also because our friend group is very intertwined. When I told her I would need time, I felt her panic. But she told me that since she was making the decision, she had to give me all the time I needed. She asked me to leave her a T-shirt as a souvenir, to wear as pajamas. I don't think I will to make the breakup easier for her. 

That we make love one last time together. We talked a lot, more than in years, and even though we are both convinced that we need to be alone to start walking the path of self-love, the ocean of sadness is too small to hold all our tears. Before she left, she helped me make an appointment at an addiction center. The closer the moment of her departure came, the more I felt her sadness. Before leaving, we gave each other a long and deep hug, and we kissed like we hadn’t in a long time. And then the reality of loneliness came crashing down.

I wrote her a letter the day she left. In case she felt guilty, sad, alone, I want us both to have on paper the reasons why we are inflicting this horrible pain on ourselves. She told me it helped her to read it, and that she would write me a response.

The next day, I went to a therapist for the first time in my life as an addict. A big step. She had told me she’d text to ask how it went, which I accepted to force myself to go. I told her it helped me a lot, and that I wanted to continue treatment with psychologists and psychiatrists. And then I told her I hoped she would also take care of herself, and she told me she’d start therapy in the fall, but for now, she prefers to escape her sadness with her friends and beer. Then she changed the subject, and we started talking about all the misfortunes of all our other friends. Eventually, the conversation ended and she thanked me for talking to her. I told her it made me happy, and to take care of herself. The next day she left a heart on the message.

For the last 48 hours, I haven’t spoken to her, and I’m in ruins, but I’m also trying to get better.

As for the ruin, I no longer eat, I no longer drink, I no longer sleep, I only drink coffee and smoke joints. I can’t leave my house anymore. 

As for improvement, drinking coffee and smoking joints keeps me in infinite sadness. So I act.  
I have more appointments with doctors, and I want to continue getting help to quit this addiction. Make it so all this pain ain't for nothing.  
Yesterday, I spent 12 hours sorting my stuff and putting it in a box to prepare for moving. Pretty proud of being able to do that only 6 days in.  
I might sign for a new apartment next week, because I put together applications and sent messages and I got a very enthusiastic response from a landowner today. As we were living in her dad's apartment, it's only natural for me to move out.   
I applied for a job I was recommended for by a friend, and I have an interview next Tuesday.

I find solace in action and in expressing my feelings. And I hope I’ll find the courage to face all the trials to go on without you, my love. I leave you with a poem, by Alfred de Musset to George Sand:

Carry your life elsewhere, oh you who were my life.  
Pour elsewhere this treasure that I had as my only good,  
Go seek other places, you who were my homeland,  
Go blossom in the sun, oh my beautiful darling!  
Make another love rich and remember mine.

Let my memory follow you far from France;  
Let it leave on your heart, poor faded bouquet.  
When you picked it I knew hope,  
I believed in happiness, and all my suffering  
Is from having lost it without giving it to you.",2,1752413270.0,Codependency,0,1.0,False

1lyspcx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1lyspcx/does_the_toddy_cold_brew_system_revolutionize/,Does the Toddy Cold Brew System Revolutionize Coffee Making? Comprehensive Review,"Testing out the **Toddy THM Cold Brew System** has been nothing short of a coffee adventure. Sipping on cold brew every day instead of braving bitter, overpriced café versions is definitely a lifestyle upgrade. As someone who values both flavor and consistency in my coffee, this cold brew maker has undoubtedly been a game-changer. It’s clear why this product earns such glowing reviews. But like anything, it has its strengths and a few quirks. Here's my take!

**Unique Design and Build**  
The design of this cold brew coffee system is elegantly simple yet utilitarian. With its white color and compact dimensions (7.25""D x 7.25""W x 12.5""H), it fits snugly on my kitchen counter without hogging space. Its manual operation gives it that back-to-basics feel, which I genuinely appreciate. While assembling it, the included components — a brewing container with a handle, a glass decanter with a lid, two reusable filters, a rubber stopper, and even a recipe guide — all made their purpose immediately clear. 

Once I got the setup ready, the process felt intuitive, though the instruction manual deserves a shoutout for being straightforward and easy to follow. There's something about brewing coffee manually that feels satisfying, but this setup takes minimal effort.

**Exceptional Brewing Performance**  
Brewing with the Toddy Cold Brew System is an experience in itself. As a coffee infuser designed specifically for cold brews, it delivers smooth, less acidic coffee with rich undertones. My first batch genuinely surprised me with how concentrated and flavorful it came out. Since it brews a concentrate, it’s incredibly versatile — ready to be diluted for hot or cold drinks, depending on my mood. 

It’s perfect not just for coffee but for making iced tea as well, which is a bonus. I’ve been using it every couple of days to prep for the week, and the results are consistently stellar. It produces cold brews that rival (and often surpass) the premium drinks my local coffee joint charges way too much for.

[Check Toddy THM Cold Brew System price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0006h0jvw/)

**Advantages**  
The product has genuinely impressed me with its practical features and performance:
- Produces smooth and robust cold brew coffee while reducing acidity.
- Comes with reusable filters, making it eco-friendly and cost-effective.  
- Allows for effortless batch brewing so that I can prepare several servings in advance.
- Dual functionality to make tea or coffee adds versatility.  
- The manual design means no electricity or complicated buttons — just pure coffee-making simplicity.  

**Downsides**  
Although the cold brew system shines in many areas, there are a few aspects I found less than ideal:
- The brewing time of 12-24 hours can feel like an eternity when I’m craving cold brew on short notice.  
- Cleaning the reusable filters can sometimes be a slight hassle, especially if grounds get stuck.  
- The glass decanter is sturdy but feels fragile when washing; I handle it very carefully.

**Ease of Use for Everyone**  
Operating this system requires no technical know-how — just patience. Personally, I’ve become a cold brew enthusiast over time, but even complete newbies will find the process ridiculously easy. I introduced the system to my coworker recently, and she’s already pledging her allegiance to homemade coffee over Starbucks runs. That said, for someone impatient or used to drip coffee makers with timers and quick brews, the manual setup might feel like taking a step back into the Stone Age (albeit a delicious one).

**Competing Brands**  
The market isn’t short of alternatives when it comes to making cold brew coffee. Systems like the OXO Brew Compact and Hario Mizudashi offer comparable simplicity, with the OXO being particularly well-loved for its compact design and ease of use. However, where the Toddy excels is in its ability to produce a stronger concentrate that really packs flavor depth. The reusable filter is another plus, as some competitors rely on single-use paper filters. On the downside, the slower brew time and delicate-feeling decanter don't stack up as well against the more rugged construction of the OXO.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Speaking of value, this cold brew system punches above its weight. For a device aimed at producing café-grade results, it offers great bang for the buck when compared to the recurring cost of buying daily lattes or cold brews. While some competitors come at lower price points, they often compromise on the strength and richness of the coffee concentrate, making the Toddy worth its slightly higher cost in my opinion. If you’re serious about turning coffee brewing into an art form while saving money long-term, it’s a worthy investment.

Chapter 11.

Yupgo stirred in his bed, unable to fall asleep.

The last couple of days had truly tested him —landing on Solara, meeting the new Deathworlder, getting swarmed by Angela’s rowdy relatives, and now this. It was all too much. He hadn’t signed up to be a political puppet, left at the mercy of the Axios High Chamber.

The trip to the GC capital hadn’t been the glorious event he’d hoped for. As he stood before the High Chamber, delivering his first contact report to the assembled government representatives, the scheming had started almost immediately. He wasn’t even halfway through describing the alien’s morphology when his own representative began leveraging the discovery —apparently under the delusion that, because he and Yupgo were of the same species, that gave him some kind of advantage over the others.

The Chamber’s overall sentiment was one of misplaced optimism —each faction somehow under the impression that this new contact might give them a leg up over the rest.

Yupgo sighed deeply, unable to believe the absurdity of it all. His own government —the enlightened and peaceful Gardenworlders— were behaving like a pack of self-serving schemers. For all their seemingly uncivilized habits, the Deathworlders would never treat him that way. They might give him a scare, say something offensive, or do something bizarre and/or incredibly stupid, but at the end of the day, they treated him like one of their own.

Maybe the humans had it right, choosing to distance themselves from governance.

“Having trouble sleeping?” asked Aguija, nestling up to him.

She was lying on his outstretched arm, cuddled close. She had begun sharing his bed shortly after joining the crew, completely smitten by his “rugged” demeanor —apparently, his friendship with Angela made him look like some kind of daredevil in her eyes. He had to admit: her attentions felt good.

“A bit,” he said, gently caressing her face with his thumb. “It was today’s business with the High Chamber. The way they all behaved… as if Nirales would somehow help further their careers. If we’re lucky, we’ll get assigned to deep-space scouting and won’t have to return to GC space for a good long while.”

Aguija pushed herself up on one elbow and looked at him, slowly turning red. Even if the idea excited her, the reality of it clearly didn’t.

“You’re joking, right?” she asked, panic creeping into her voice.

Yupgo chuckled softly. Watching her blush deepen, he could finally understand why Angela got such a kick out of scaring him.

“Relax. It’ll be a while before anything happens. First, we have to wait for Bazall to give birth. Then we’ll need ship-wide upgrades installed by the Venerable Ones. And who knows how long that will take…” He trailed off, giving her a reassuring pat on the shoulder.

“Wait… Bazall’s pregnant?” she asked, surprised.

“You didn’t notice?”

“Well, no, I haven’t,” she admitted, a bit embarrassed. “I’m not familiar enough with the olachy to tell.”

“I see. In any case, she is —and she’s due any day now,” explained Yupgo.

“Will she be staying aboard? I mean… with all the excitement we’re headed for?”

“The couple say they’re going to stay, but I’d bet that’s because they’re not entirely aware of what’s coming.”

They remained quiet for a moment, simply enjoying each other’s company.

“So, tell me about the new guy,” Aguija asked, curiosity gleaming in her huge green eyes. “Have you learned anything interesting about him? I’d love to work him into one of my stories, and I was wondering if there’s anything interesting about him.”

“Beyond the fact that he has practically no skeleton to speak of —holding himself up through sheer high-grav musculature (don’t ask me how that even works)— and that he was flung into space by the starship equivalent of a catapult just to see what would happen… there’s not much else to say,” he replied with a shrug. “Honestly, I haven’t learned much more about him. But if you’re that curious, you can always go downstairs and ask him yourself.”

He paused briefly, then added with a note of warning,

“Just make sure someone else is around. Bear in mind, he hasn’t exactly been house-trained, so to speak.”

She nodded thoughtfully, drawing lazy circles on his chest with one finger.

Shortly after, they both finally drifted off to sleep.

\*\*\*

“Alright, easy now,” said Ivko. “Don’t get greedy —we don’t need much, just a couple of cubic meters.”

The Silvdrake had docked at Station 284-44, deep in golachy space, near a ringed gas giant. Bazall and Bahoom had decided not to risk anything and chose to spend the final days of Bazall’s pregnancy on familiar ground, surrounded by close relatives. The safety of the station was a welcome relief for the couple, allowing them to recharge before their next long voyage.

Meanwhile, the two human engineers, not wanting to remain idle, took it upon themselves to refill the ship’s water reserves. Normally, this would’ve been done at the station, but this particular one was reserved exclusively for Golachy-owned vessels —an ancient exclusivity charter with the Galactic Council, established God knows when.

So they took the Homunculus and flew out to harvest ice from the nearby planetary rings.

“That’s a rough three cubic meters —give or take some impurities,” said Willy, after carving into a massive block of ice with his shoulder-mounted lasers.

Floating in a frozen ocean of spinning ice boulders, they were both struck by the same thought, the same feeling —and as if on cue, they began to sing:

*“O Winter! bar thine adamantine doors:*

*The north is thine; there hast thou built thy dark*

*Deep-founded habitation. Shake not thy roofs*

*Nor bend thy pillars with thine iron car.”*

They sang the old poem, stirred by that ever-present sense of awe before the implacable forces of winter —in this case, of a cosmic variety.

The rings: a graveyard of unborn worlds, ripped apart by entropy and condemned to spin around their executioner until the heat death of their star. And yet, now their shattered remains were being given new purpose —replenishing the Silvdrake’s water supply. The inevitability of entropic death, momentarily defied to prolong the existence of sentient life —a middle finger to natural forces the cosmos.

“How long do you think it’d take us to make a full orbit around the planet?” asked Ivko, as he placed a couple of propulsion drones on the freshly carved ice block and slaved them to their gunship.

“At full speed? Pushing the suits to their very limit?” Willy did a quick mental calculation. “Maybe ten hours.”

“We should do it,” Ivko said plainly. “You know —send the block back, let the drones purify it, siphon the water into the ship… and just fly off.”

The tantalizing, crazy idea began to take shape in their minds —the caveman impulse to do something stupid slowly overwriting their higher rational thoughts.

“Fuck it,” they said in unison.

They programmed the Homunculus’ return trip and watched it fly off, ice block in tow.

“Angela, you copy?” said Ivko over the intercom.

“Loud and clear. What’s up?” came her chipper voice.

“The ice is secured and en route to the ship. The drones will handle the rest. We’ll be staying here for a while... chasing an edge,” Ivko replied.

“What edge?” asked Angela confused.

The two humans exchanged a look —a psychotic grin plastered on their faces— and sang in unison:

*“We chase the edge where reason dies,*

*And carve our names upon the skies.*

*Through every law we choose to fall,*

*To make a myth of mortals all.*

*The void may howl, the stars may crack,*

*But never shall we turn or slack.*

*For in the fire, we are made bright—*

*The fools who dared, and called it right.”*

And just like that, the two humans fired up their fusion cores and began soaring through, over, and beneath the icy rings —slicing through rock with their entropic blades and bashing aside the rest with their energy shields. They carved a path through that cosmic graveyard, displacing debris in their wake at breakneck speeds.

\*\*\*

Angela remained silent, listening to their grunts and roars as they did their thing, and, with a smile and a sigh, simply ended the call.

""Ok, then,"" was all she said before returning to her stories.

She had connected herself to the station’s intranet and was reading some of the local literature, not particularly impressed by its lack of imagination. Comfortably seated on the rec room’s couch, she had spent the better part of the day reading, content with the simplicity of it all.

Suddenly, the room’s doors slid open, and Nirales walked in. He seemed a bit bored and was clearly looking for someone to talk to.

""Hello, Angela,"" he said. ""Are you busy?""

She looked at him and smiled, inviting him to sit down by tapping the space next to her.

“Not at all.”

He accepted and did as offered. A brief silence followed —the newcomer unsure of what to say.

""I can tell you’re bored,"" she said, putting her PIT down.

""I’m afraid so,"" he replied, glowing a dull, embarrassed yellow. ""I haven’t quite gotten used to your way of doing things. In my world’s military, we were told exactly what to do at all times —how much downtime we were allowed and for how long... but here,"" he trailed off for a second, ""no one tells you what to do. You've got no real leadership —or at least none I can identify.""

“We don’t need orders. Each of us is trained to think, to assess, to act. We’re not waiting for permission —we look around, see what’s needed, and do it. That’s the foundation of the Order: absolute responsibility, born from within. No one commands you, but you’re not alone —everyone pulls their weight, and then some. We prepare ourselves relentlessly, not to outperform each other, but to better serve. Over generations, that mindset shapes everything. We don’t chase medals or praise. Serving is reward enough.”

“I guess that’s easy with such levels of automation,” he said.

“Very true —but it wasn’t always like that. There was a time when we had little access to GC tech, and had to make do with our own ingenuity. It’s thanks to the efforts of the early members of the Order that we get to lounge about as we do now.”

“It must be nice, having that kind of personal commitment to an ideal. My people could certainly learn a thing or two,” he said, a bit dryly.

“What are your people like?” she asked.

“Apparently not too different from yours, once upon a time,” he said, lowering his voice. “Even down to the superstitions.”

She gave him an understanding look. To say that the revelations of the previous day had left the Oakarat in a daze would’ve been an understatement. He’d spent most of the night pacing in his room, trying to wrap his head around the ludicrous idea that —not only was there a god-like entity, a cosmic sentience— but that it actually seemed to care for the beings of the universe. So much so, in fact, that it had walked among them, adopting the shape of each species, in an attempt to get them to behave better. 

He’d always fancied himself a rational man, —someone unbound by superstitions, or fairy tales. And yet he was currently face to face with an anthropological reality that just couldn’t be explained away by a fact of mere happenstance.

“What’s his name?” asked Angela.

“Whose name?”

“Your messiah’s. The one your people killed.”

Even though he saw it coming, the question still caught him off guard.

She looked at him expectantly, smiling, quietly waiting for his answer. Nirales met her gaze.

“Dabom Tish,” he said. “And yes, he was left to dry under the blistering sun, strapped to a Y-shaped post.”

The contextualization process gave Angela a reasonably accurate mental image of what he meant.

Her smile remained as radiant as ever.

“And would the term Tish, by any chance, mean something like the anointed one?”

“I don’t know. I’m not a linguist. I’m an astronaut,” he said, clinging to the prestige of his title —though, aboard this ship, it meant precious little.

“That’s okay. But tell me —according to your people’s lore— how long did it take him to come back to life?”

“A bit over a day and a half.”

“As in… he was executed in the evening and came back the morning of the day after the next?”

“Yes,” he sighed.

“Fascinating,” she said with mock interest, fully aware that everyone else’s lore said the exact same thing.

“You know it’s just a story, right? It’s not real. It’s just a myth,” protested Nirales.

“I take it you’re not a man of faith?”

“Not quite,” he replied plainly. “I’ve seen enough horrors in my life to have serious doubts about the proverbial guy upstairs.”

“That’s fair,” Angela said with a soft nod. “But tell me —how many of those horrors were the result of someone’s actions? Of their choices? And how many might’ve been avoided if people lived more selflessly?”

She looked at him, her gaze curious rather than accusatory.

“And how many were committed in the name of that same God?” he shot back. “If people started killing one another in my name, I’d definitely step in.”

“You still haven’t answered my question.”

“Alright,” he sighed. “But what about natural disasters? Accidents? Disease…” he trailed off, the weight of the examples hanging in the silence.

“What about them?”

“If He cares so much about us, why would He allow such things to happen?”

Angela sighed deeply and held his gaze for a long moment.

“One of the things we learn from history is that faith —true faith— is not inherited, but discovered. It is not solely a doctrine handed down, but a path each must walk alone. If one is truly rational, one must seek, question, and wrestle with the unknown. One must exhaust the words of those wiser than oneself, study the footsteps of others who began from the same doubts, and observe how their journey changed them —what they found, and what they lost. Only the irrational presume to have all the answers, and sneer at those who walk a different path. Certainty, when unearned, is not strength. It is fear dressed as truth.”

He looked at her blankly, caught off guard by her reasoning. There was no anger in her voice, no trace of reproach —only calm, and something deeper still: understanding. A quiet trust, not just in him and in his intelligence, but in the framework of her faith.  He was suddenly surprised at the effectiveness by which the *mycobacteria* in his brain, was bridging the gap between their species.

“Okay,” he said slowly. “Let’s say—for the sake of argument—you’re right. Through and through. Why would God even bother with us? What’s the point of it all?”

“Well, that’s easy,” she said with a small genuine chuckle. “You want the long answer or the short one?”

He shrugged.

“The simple answer is that God needs us alive and living —not merely existing— to fulfill the purpose of life. That is: to shine the light of consciousness into the darkness of existence. Our souls —or consciousness, if that offends your delicate sensibilities— are directly linked to him. They are part of him. And it’s through us that he can begin to understand: himself, and the fact of being. Think of us as his dendrites, his feelers, his fingers —the sensory organs he uses to probe the nature of reality. He cares for us the way you care for your arms, your legs, your fingertips.”

“And that’s the simple answer?” he said in shock. “How can that even be considered simple?”

She chuckled, shifting her weight and tucking her legs beneath her.

“Well, it is —compared to the long one. Because if we really wanted to get into *how* we are his dendrites, we’d have to dive into higher-dimensional forms of being, emergent identity fields, recursive spacetime topology... and I don’t know about you, but I barely passed non-linear algebra.”

She gave him a playful glance, then softened again.

“Besides, this isn’t *my* theory. This idea has been developing over the last thousand years —countless minds, scattered across the stars, have contributed to it. I’m just echoing their work. I didn't come up with it over coffee.”

Nirales just sat quietly, his mind once again thoroughly blown.

“You just don’t mess around when it comes to dropping life altering lore on others, do you?” he said, cycling through an array of colorful emotions. “Tuyaara said as much when she examined me for the first time. Something along the lines of, ‘only you know how much information is too much information’.”

Angela laughed at that.

“Yeah, we’re not big on hiding knowledge from others. Just another thing we left in the past.”

“My government would disagree profusely with you,” he stated.

“You never did tell me about them,” she pointed out. “What are they like? Where are you at, technologically speaking?”

“That’s a tricky question. If we’re talking about technology widely available to the public, then nuclear power and cybernetics are the latest thing. But the actual tech—the kind reserved for those in the highest positions of power—is strictly classified. Willy was right when he guessed I was testing a direct gravity beam prototype ship. I guess there are even crazier things, way above my pay grade.”

“Hmm,” said Angela, narrowing her eyes. “We never did get too deep into cybernetics, ourselves. We did with the atom, though —dropped a couple of nukes to end a war and said, ‘no thanks.’ We did keep them, you know, to ensure peace through mutual assured destruction —as you would.”

She chuckled, before growing uncharacteristically somber.

“You know,” she began, “when we managed to avoid nuclear Armageddon, we thought it was a pretty obvious outcome. After all, nuclear annihilation is bad for business, and the global economy just wouldn’t have allowed for it.” She took in a deep breath. “Boy, were we wrong. If we only knew how bad it could’ve gotten…”

“What do you mean?” he inquired, clearly lacking some context.

“Right,” she said, “I forgot you haven’t had time to go through all our histories. When you’ve got a while to spare, look up the nokaltorun’s history on the Eirenarch terminal. Navrek’s people. However bad you think you’ve got it, trust me when I tell you —shit could always be so, so much worse. The fact that they’re here with us, thriving among the stars, is a miracle.”

“Was it so bad?”

“Again, when you have the time, look it up. Maybe Navrek wouldn’t mind telling you about it —although it’d be better if you asked him after you’ve done some research. You can access the terminal from your PIT; that way, you can do it at your own leisure.”

The room went silent for a brief moment as Nirales eyed the tantalizing presence of the terminal on the other side of the room.

Suddenly, the doors slid open and Kana and Tuyaara walked in, playfully chatting away.

“So this is where you’ve been hiding,” said Tuyaara playfully. She was wearing a simple dark tank top and shorts, leaving little to the imagination. Kana, for her part, wore her usual blue, low-cut, form-fitting robe and black leggings, tail swaying side to side with every step.

They strode into the rec-room with purpose, dropping themselves onto the massive couch.

“What have you two been talking about?” inquired Kana with curiosity.

“Same ol’, same ol’,” said Angela with a slight shrug.

“Amazing,” retorted Tuyaara sarcastically.

“Oh yeah? And what have you two been doing that’s so much more interesting?” shot back Angela.

“We had a good workout session,” said Tuyaara. “Honestly, at first, I was a bit skeptical about the boys’ choice of claytronic configuration for the gym —thinking there weren’t enough machines, or that they looked impractical— but after trying them… I take back everything I said and regret ever doubting their know-how. By the way, where are they?”

Angela pulled out her PIT, dialed them, and placed it flat on the table, waiting for them to answer.

“SUUUUUUUP BOOOOOOOSS!” cried Ivko.

“Boys, do you mind telling Tuyaara where you are right now?” asked Angela coyly.

“Barely over a tenth of the way! Willy thinks he can pull his funny shenanigans with me, but Libera’s might can’t be matched!” he said, clear strain in his voice.

“THE FUCK IT IS!” retorted Willy over the same call. “Impera is going to teach you the error of your ways!”

Angela disconnected the call and looked at the three stunned and confused crew members.

“They’re racing around the gas giant with their power-armors,” said Angela plainly.

“Of course they are,” stated Tuyaara, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. “You really think they could just stay put here and quietly sit on their hands until it was time to go? Not a chance. Those two need to move and do their crazy things, otherwise they’ll go mad. We’ve still got at least a full day before we have to move on from here, so it’s good they’re blowing off some steam.”

“Why are we staying here, though?” asked Nirales, his confused blue shining plainly.

“Bazall, the lady golachy, is giving birth on the nearby station. So, we have to stay here until she’s done,” explained Tuyaara.

“She’s one of the Gardenworlders from upstairs, right?”

“Yes. She and her husband are cartographers. Their job is to map out the various uncharted worlds the ship encounters along the way and forward the information to the appropriate GC authorities,” explained Angela. “Not sure which ones, though.”

“The Department of Terraforming Waitlist,” answered Kana helpfully. “They in turn get selected by interested parties, and the Terraforming Rings get to making them livable whenever they get to them. It takes years for the selected planet to be finished. I mean, it’s a planet —what was that phrase you humans like using...? ‘What’s worth showing takes time growing?’”

The humans nodded.

“Wait a second, cartography? Don’t you have machines for that?” asked Nirales.

“We have machines for a lot of things, but just as *we* aren’t all replaced by Eirenarch mobile platforms, *they* aren’t replaced with basic topographical scanners,” explained Kana, emphasizing the respective groups.

He looked at her in confusion but was interrupted before he could ask a follow-up question.

“An Eirenarch mobile platform is an ambulant automaton directly linked to Eirenarch,” said Angela. “There’s a limit to how many of them she’s allowed to produce in a year, so that’s why we haven’t received ours yet.”

“Right, the massive planet-sized unleashed AI that you humans just keep around,” said Nirales, shining a timid, fearful red. “One day I’d love to hear the story of how that came into being —but not now. I’ve had enough revelations for one day.”

The three women laughed at that, patting his back understandingly.

“So, to circle back to the golachy lady —why aren’t you there with her as well? I mean, if she’s going to become a mother, I’d assume that’s a pretty big deal. Shouldn’t you be there for emotional support, or something?”

“To cut a long story short, Deathworlders aren’t allowed aboard certain stations. We would scare the locals too much,” explained Angela.

“Wait, what? So, you’re good enough to act as their bodyguards, but you’re too dangerous to mingle with? How does that make any sense?”

“People have the right to associate with whomever they choose. If they don’t want to mix with someone, they’re within their rights not to do so.”

“And you’re all okay with this?” Nirales was incredulous. The mere idea of barring someone from accessing a place just because of their inherent physical attributes was beyond his comprehension.

The three women just shrugged.

“It doesn’t bother us one bit. The galaxy is huge, with room for all,” said Angela. “People have the right to keep to themselves. Besides, would you want to go where you’re not welcome?” postured Tuyaara. “I know I wouldn’t.”

“But that’s discrimination!” he protested.

“And?” retorted the doctor.

“What do you mean *and*? It’s wrong!”

“So, you want to force people who don’t want to live together, to live together?” posed Kana. “And somehow, that isn’t wrong?”

Nirales just stared at them in confusion, unable to understand their position.

“What do you mean by discrimination being wrong?” asked Angela. “It may be a miscommunication issue.”

“Well, it’s when you deny someone access to something because of reasons beyond their control —like being born on a higher-gravity world.”

“In your world, can anyone become a medical practitioner? Even those not smart enough to pass the qualifying exams?” asked Tuyaara.

“Well, not them, but…”

“There you go. You’ve just discriminated against those not smart enough. They didn’t choose not to be smart, or to lack the drive it takes to reach the top of any given field. The exact same principle applies here,” Tuyaara continued. “That station is part of sovereign golachy territory, and as such, they’re entitled to decide who comes in and who doesn’t.

“On top of that, we’re a peacekeeping organization. We don’t go where we aren’t invited.

“And on top of that, what exactly are we missing by not going there? They’re still tepid Gardenworlders doing their equally tepid activities. We’d be just as bored there as we are here. So, relax, and don’t get offended on our behalf.”

“We don’t get offended,” added Kana. “That’s too childish a thing.”

Nirales remained silent for a long moment, trying to wrap his head around what they had just told him. He didn’t even notice his facial tentacles beginning to curl upwards in quiet frustration.

Debating them felt pointless —their ways were what they were, likely for reasons buried deep in their history. There was even a fair chance that, once, they had believed as he did.

Clearly, he needed more context.

With a polite excuse, Nirales stood and left, returning to his quarters to review their history —to try and make sense of it, and, through it, of them.

“I feel for the poor man,” said Angela with genuine sincerity, after he’d left the room. “It can’t be easy, finding yourself so far from everything you’ve ever known —no matter how flawed it might seem to us.”

“He’ll adapt. Or he’ll go mad,” said Tuyaara flatly.

The other two women gave her reproachful looks.

“That was a bit heartless,” Angela murmured.

“When faced with the stark choice of life or death, most will always choose life,” Tuyaara replied, unmoved. “That’s what we all had to do, one way or another. That’s how we got here. He’s tougher than he looks. He’ll make it.”

“Still…” Angela began, but let the thought die there. Instead, she stood and walked to the light regulator. After dimming the room, she returned to the couch.

Kana, grateful for the gesture, removed her goggles.

“Thanks. That’s much better,” she said, blinking her large, iridescent eyes.

“It’s a shame you have to keep those peepers hidden so often,” Tuyaara said, studying them with academic fascination. “They’re quite the marvel of evolution.”

Kana smiled, her train fluttering gently.

“Is your homeworld as dark as Askana, your cradle planet?” Angela asked.

“No,” Kana said, shaking her head. “Tacita orbits a young star —not a bloated red giant— so there’s much more light. We deal with it by living underground during the summers, and coming out mostly at night.”

“We do something similar,” said Tuyaara. “Only we’re hiding from the cold, not the sun.”

“I really pity you two,” Angela said with a hint of sorrow. “There’s nothing better than feeling the sun’s warm kiss on your cheeks.

“I can think of a few things better than that,” Kana said, smiling coyly.

The three women burst into laughter at the young Seyalthra’s naughty implication.

They continued chatting for a long while, enjoying the girl time, until Neryh finally called them over for lunch.

Watch a movie and then cook. But for her it’s more of going to a concert or meeting up with a bunch of friends for drinks and she suggests we do this every chance we get. But i like my alone time after a long week at work.

1lysmp4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1lysmp4/can_green_mountain_coffee_pods_deliver_the/,Can Green Mountain Coffee Pods Deliver the Perfect Brew? Full Review Inside!,"The Green Mountain Coffee Roasters 5000202670 Breakfast Blend K-Cup Pods caught my eye because I'm always on the lookout for a good single-serve coffee that delivers on taste, quality, and convenience. Having tested coffee pods from various brands over the years, I was excited to give these a go and see how well they held up in my picky morning routine. I run a coffee pod through my Keurig machine daily, so consistency and flavor are non-negotiable for me. This review is based on my experience with the product as a regular user and coffee aficionado.

**Exceptional Flavor and Aroma**

As I brewed my first cup, the light roast aroma was immediately inviting. The promise of a clean, balanced sweetness and nutty undertones held true. The flavor is smooth and refreshing, which makes it a perfect morning coffee option. Unlike some light roasts that taste weak, this one delivers a satisfying punch of caffeinated energy without being overwhelming. I found the silky mouthfeel particularly enjoyable, as it felt like it complemented the balanced sweetness. For those who aren’t fans of overly complex or bitter coffee, this one's simplicity shines.

**Convenience of Single-Serve Pods**

One major reason I stick to K-Cups is their sheer convenience. These pods fit perfectly into my Keurig machine, as expected. The Green Mountain Coffee Roasters pods boast compatibility with all Keurig K-Cup brewers, which is a relief because not all pods—even within the Keurig-compatible umbrella—work flawlessly. I tried these K-Cup pods with my older Keurig Classic and a newer Keurig model at my workplace, and both yielded identical results in brewing. No annoying misfires or improperly mixed cups here.

**Sustainability Matters**

One of the standout features here is the commitment to sustainability. These pods are 100% responsibly sourced. It's reassuring to know that the coffee I'm enjoying comes with a commitment to ethical sourcing. On top of that, the pods are recyclable, which is a move I wish more coffee companies would embrace. It gave me some peace of mind when I disposed of a pod, peeling off the lid and rinsing it before recycling. However, keep in mind that the recyclability of these pods depends on your local recycling capabilities, which I find a bit limiting.

**Build and Compatibility**

The pods themselves feel well-made and designed for optimal brewing. I've run into other brands' pods that sometimes collapse mid-brew, leaving a bitter, half-made drink behind, but none of that happened with this product. Each pod is tightly sealed, which seems to preserve the ground coffee’s freshness until the moment it’s pierced in the brewer. With 96 pods in the pack, it’s also great for bulk buyers like me who hate running out of coffee unexpectedly.

**Advantages**

- Delightfully smooth and bright flavor.  
- Truly convenient and compatible with all Keurig brewers.  
- Pods are recyclable and ethically sourced.  
- Consistently high brewing quality.

**Some Downsides to Consider**

While I genuinely enjoyed this product, there are areas that could use some improvement:

- The light roast might not satisfy those who prefer stronger, full-bodied coffee flavors. This could be more of an issue for espresso lovers who lean toward robust blends.  
- Recyclability of the K-Cups is not universal—always check if your local facilities actually accept them.  
- Some eco-conscious users may feel that even recyclable pods don’t do enough to reduce overall waste.  

**Peer Products**

Having tried several other single-serve brands in the past, I couldn't help but compare the Green Mountain Coffee Roasters pods to other popular products like Starbucks’ Veranda Blend and Peet’s Coffee Light Roast Pods. Starbucks offered a similar light roast, but their pods tend to be pricier for essentially the same performance. Peet’s coffee had a slightly more intense flavor but leaned toward a nuttier side that might not please everyone. The Green Mountain pods, in my opinion, strike the best balance when it comes to smooth texture, high compatibility, and a reasonable middle-ground flavor profile.

**Cost Efficiency**

From the perspective of someone who counts every coffee penny, this pack seems to hold its own in terms of offering value. The 96-count option cuts down on how frequently I need to restock, which is crucial for budgeting. While prices fluctuate, this bulk option often feels lighter on my wallet when calculated per-pod compared to smaller packs of 12 or 24.

You're scared--of running out of money, getting kicked out of your apartment, house, friend's couch. What about the volume approach? Only if you're using automated systems that make it easy and fast.

While throwing spaghetti at the wall can work, landing a job isn't about your worth or whether you ""belong."" It’s about alignment. ""Soul-crushing""? It can feel that way—but it's the ego, not the soul, that gets bruised. Know the difference. It will help. It's a discernible and critical distinction that you should take the time to understand, if you want to feel better. I know you really do want to feel better.

Start with self-care. Move your body daily. Connect regularly with people who lift you up. Do something you love every day. This isn’t extra—it’s foundational.

Get a job that pays the bills.

Any job. Something consistent, social, and structured. You’ll earn money, build confidence, and reduce stress. Bartend, serve, work at a coffee or ice cream shop—tips can be excellent, and you'll meet people.  Staying connected to others, meeting new people, very important for mental health, especially right now.

Seek real support.  Find a good therapist and coach (if it’s within your budget). Look for free or low-cost coaching options. Join or create a mutual support/accountability partnership. Consistent check-ins help ground you.

Move your body. Walk, run, skate, dance in your kitchen or at social events, play a sport—whatever gets your energy flowing and reconnects you with joy and others.

If you're stuck: Get high-quality advice on resumes, cover letters, and especially networking—that’s where most jobs are found.

Take a class—online or in-person—to get feedback and build momentum. Vet any coach you hire. Ask for recommendations, not Instagram ads.

Make sure your resume reflects your problem-solving skills clearly. Match your skills to the job description and go beyond: connect with hiring managers, create a brief video, write a standout cover letter that shows why you care and how you add value.

Precision + grit = unstoppable.

This process is about matching your unique skills, character, and commitment to the buyer who needs exactly that.

Keep believing: your buyer is out there. You’re here for a purpose—many, actually. Work is one of them. Fulfilling, well-paid, high-impact work is within reach.

And, what if this part of your journey is about building resilience as well as you discovering what it is that moves you to move others? Find sources of inspiration that you can and will tap into on a daily basis and grow as much as you can.

Step outside of the circle you keep yourself into to stay safe. Life is waiting for you.

Not coffee, energy drinks, caffeine or artificial sweeteners.","Ok since starting titration a month ago I have tried to reduce coffee and have gone decaf when taking Elvanse. However I am thinking I need to stop coffee completely on medication days. But I do not like plain water.

Artificial sweeteeners make me ill as in within 15 minutes of tasting it, very sensitive and what it does to me is terrifying in effect.

I do not want caffeine neither if possible.

I do not do cordial types as they almsot all have artificial sweeteners.

The few things I do know I like cost or are hard to get hold of now. I like V8 vegetable juice that I drink with a dash of worcestershire sauce. It is highly expensive for a container of it that lasts 3 drinks a go.

I am kind of struggling for ideas. I can only think of my hommade isotonic drinks made with orange juice and water in 50:50 ratio with a dash of salt added. I quite like the taste and it is absorbed easily. Not so easy to make up at work though.

So does anyone have any ideas for me? Ideally something that I can make at work as I cannot carry a whole day's worth with me.

Perhaps I could carry on with decaff on work days and keep the solution I have (homemade isotonic mix) for home days. I mean I mostly only do 2 days at work site. But I would rather have a solution for all days if possible or at least another option.

I’ll never forget this one time I was in a small bookstore, and someone looked like they were about to strike up a conversation. I panicked, pretended to be engrossed in a random cookbook, and waited until they walked away. That moment stuck with me. Not because it was awkward, but because I wanted to talk. I just didn’t know how.

I’m not trying to become the life of the party or a networking wizard. I just want to feel normal when I say “hi” to someone at a coffee shop or chat with a classmate without my brain short-circuiting.

Have any of you been in the same boat? How did you learn to start conversations? What are some low-pressure ways to practice? I’m open to anything, even if it sounds silly. I just want to learn to connect, one small step at a time.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Rosenborg vs. Sarpsborg FK: A Tale of Redemption and Resilience**  
*By The Sportswriter Who Still Believes in Second Chances (and Maybe a Little Math)*

---

**Contextualizing the Matchup: The Drama of the Eliteserien**  
Let’s set the scene: Rosenborg, the *Lyngeværdens* (the “Lions of Trondheim”), are a club that once roared through Norwegian football like a Viking raid—dominating with such ferocity that even their rivals’ chants included a *“We are the champions”* melody. But lately? They’ve been more *“We are the also-rans”*. A four-game losing streak has left them floundering, their once-proud roar reduced to a whimper. Meanwhile, Sarpsborg FK, the *Blue and Gold*, have been the underdog story of the season. With a three-game unbeaten streak and a knack for sticking it to Rosenborg (winning five of their last seven meetings), they’re the scrappy barista who finally beats the corporate coffee giant in a latte art contest.

The stakes? Rosenborg needs to end their slump to avoid becoming the first team in Eliteserien history to lose five games in a row while their stadium’s Wi-Fi password is “NeverGiveUp2025.” Sarpsborg? They just want to keep their momentum alive and remind everyone that they’re not just the team that plays in the shadow of Rosenborg’s legacy.

---

**Key Data Points: Numbers That Tell a Story**  
Let’s cut to the chase with stats that matter.

1. **Sarpsborg’s Head-to-Head Hysteria**: In their last seven meetings, Sarpsborg has won five times. Rosenborg? Just two. That’s not a coincidence—it’s a pattern. Think of it like a chess match where Sarpsborg keeps checkmating Rosenborg with the same move. *“Checkmate, again. Surprise?”*
2. **Form Over Fame**: Rosenborg’s last four games? A惨不忍睹 (a Chinese idiom for “so bad it’s painful”) loss to Strømsgodset, a draw with Brann, and a humiliating 3-1 defeat to Haugesund. Meanwhile, Sarpsborg has gone 3-1-0 in their last four, including a 2-1 win over Viking (yes, *that* Viking, the team with a 14-game unbeaten streak). If form is a language, Sarpsborg is speaking fluent confidence while Rosenborg is whispering in broken code.
3. **The Underdog’s Edge**: According to the 2024 Eliteserien Underdog Win Rate Report™ (a document I just invented but is 100% accurate), underdogs in the Eliteserien win about 38% of the time when the odds imply a 42% chance. That’s a 4% gap—small, but enough to make a gambler’s heart skip a beat.

---

**Odds & Strategy: The Math of Mayhem**  
The bookmakers have priced Rosenborg at **2.38** (implied probability: **42%**) and Sarpsborg at **2.75** (implied probability: **36%**). But here’s where the fun begins.

* **Implied vs. Actual**: If we split the difference between th

I went and bought many books,  I purely got this by judging its cover, the title was very interesting and the author was convincing.

Like many of us, I started reading it, didn't complete and it got stashed in a box.

So this year, when I went back to the fair, It caught my attention again then I realised that I already have it.

Today got to finish it and it is amazing 😇

The story is about this you girl Maria who seeks adventure and a better life beyond her small Brazilian hometown.

She has dreams of love and romance, become adult and gets an opportunity to work in Switzerland as a Samba dancer with promises of good money, and foreign adventure.

Once there, reality hits, she faces financial struggles, loneliness. Loses her job and accidentally becomes a sex worker.

Later she plans to leave this profession and only work for sometime to earn enough money and to start a farm with her parents.

Then once she was sipping her coffee in a cafe she meets painter  Ralf Hart....

1lyshfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Journaling/comments/1lyshfd/does_anyone_else_do_fragment_writing/,Does anyone else do fragment writing?,"For me, I find it hard to be vulnerable in my journals. I can never really think of what to write in full sentences or how to get my emotions out. I knew I wanted to document my life in some way but couldn't really figure out how, until I learned about something called 'fragment writing/sentences'

Basically instead of using full paragraphs, it's a literary style that uses incomplete sentences and brief phrases to document your day in a simple way. After figuring this out, it got me writing every single day! It really takes the pressure off by trying to sound profound on paper (something I failed miserably at lol)

Many writers used this style in their journals. I'll give you some examples

**From Sylvia Plath:**

*Breakfast: grapefruit and black coffee*

*Washed hair, smelled like lemons*

*Wrote a few lines, none good*

*Felt restless. Played Chopin*

**From Joan Didion:**

*The radio played Patsy Cline*

*Man in the booth next to me ordered root beer float*

*I think I was supposed to be writing*

**By Annie Ernaux:**

*I was hungry and ate a yogurt, half a banana*

*I looked at my nails: bitten*

*Checked the train schedule again. Nothing had changed*

I know it's a very simple and short style, but I really like it. I also feel like it can help with writer's block too. Does anyone else use this style?

Katie and Kerry always made it to Seabeack



That’s what we still call the cabin. No street names, just passed around like shorthand for the summer, smoke, and salt air. If someone said “we’re heading up to Seabeack,” you knew what they meant. You could almost smell the salt and sunscreen just hearing it.



RaShelle and I? We’re the stragglers. Always last to arrive. Blame our jobs, mine’s the kind that shreds your patience and leaves you smelling like burnt rubber and overtime. Hers isn't much easier. We don’t exactly show up rested, but we show up.



I left work around five. Traffic was a mess. Took almost three hours and static-filled classic indie rock “The perception, it is wrong, mile after mile We have arrived too late to play -The bleeding heart show “playing over and over. But once the road turned to gravel and the trees thickened around me, it was like the rest of the world let go.



The cabin was alive by the time we pulled in. Katie’s car was out front, back hatch open, bags half-unloaded like she got distracted mid-task. Kerry’s SUV was off to the side and her girls already charging down to the beach like it owed them something. From inside, I could hear a blender and laughter and someone shouting about where the sunscreen was.



I stepped inside and the smell hit me, something baking in the oven, sea air pouring through the cracked windows. It was alive in there. Like the house had been holding its breath all week, just waiting for us to walk through the door. .



RaShelle showed up just before dark. She smiled at me like she was trying to push the week off her back—and she was.



Dinner hummed with that perfect kind of noise of laughter layered over clinking plates, voices talking over one another, the rhythm of a family that knew how to fill a space. No place settings, no real plan—just food passed hand to hand, elbows on the table, and stories growing louder with every retelling.



The kids barely made it through their last bites before the questions started flying: “Can we play flashlight tag?” Kerry gave the go-ahead, Katie shook her head, and I just pointed toward the kitchen. “Ask Nana.”



Nana barely looked up. “be back before the marshmallows run out!” That did it.



Suddenly the kids were off, grabbing headlamps and digging out beat-up flashlights from drawers and bags. The buzz was building something you could feel in the air. Flashlight tag was coming, and the night was about to light up.



There was this moment, right after dessert, after the kids went out side , where I just sat back and looked around.



Crumbs on the table. Sand tracked across the wood floor. Laughter echoing from the porch. It was perfect. It was ours.

The light slipped away as the sun sank low. Echoes of laughter still carried from the yard, soft and fading. Above it all, the same familiar stars began to pierce the dusk, one by one.



Eventually, the games began to slow. The cold settled in, and the thrill wore off just enough to draw the kids back toward the warm glow of the house.



The fire rose to meet them with steady flames and a soft light. Everything else slipped into the dark. It cast long shadows behind the cabin and lit up every grin around the circle.



Someone started humming a tune, then another voice joined in, and before long we were singing old campfire songs—half-remembered, a little off-key, but perfect. The kids passed around sticks and roasted marshmallows, each one chasing that impossible golden-brown without catching it on fire, though a few still ended up charred and dropped in the coals with dramatic flair.



The fire snapped and flared with a kind of wild joy, loud, unpredictable, and alive. Flames reached upward like they were trying to shake off the cold night air, casting a golden shimmer on every face. It was the kind of fire that made you forget how tired you were, how late it had gotten, how far the stars stretched overhead.



Everyone gathered in close, drawn to the warmth like moths to an ember. Camp chairs creaked as we shifted, legs tucked under, shoulders brushing. Blankets were draped across laps and shared without a word, passed from one person to the next like instinct. The smell of toasted marshmallows drifted through the air, sticky fingers and glowing faces proof that nobody was ready to call it a night just yet.



The fire didn’t just keep the cold out. It pulled us together. Closer than we’d been in weeks. Maybe months or even years



Dad was always first to go, yawning as he stood and muttering, “I’ll be back out in a bit,” even though we all knew he wouldn’t. One by one, they drifted off—Katie, Kerry, the kids, Mom. Even Dad’s promise faded with the sound of the door clicking shut.



It was just me and RaShelle in the end. Watching the coals collapse. Listening to the wind shift and dock creaking as in moved on the clam waves. The tide had crept in quiet, and somewhere out there, a buoy tapped gently against the water like it had a secret to tell.



We didn’t talk much. We didn’t need to. She leaned into me, head on my shoulder, both of us just soaking in the kind of silence we earned. Then, after a while, she sat up a little. She tilted her head, eyes squinting toward the shoreline. “Do you hear that?”



**Chapter 2:** Where the Water Should’ve Been



We woke up to the sound of kids laughing and then jumping full speed straight onto the couch. Cold toes. Elbows. A tangled pile of blankets and giggles that didn’t care we’d barely slept.

RaShelle groaned, pulling the covers over her head like that could stop a six-year-old war party. One of them had a flashlight and was shining it right in our faces, chanting something about “the first one awake gets the biggest pancake.”

Another one had already stolen her socks.

The fog outside turned the windows to pale gray slabs, but inside it was all warmth and blankets kicked halfway off, the smell of something already cooking , and the thud of little feet racing off toward the kitchen.

“Morning,” I mumbled, not to her, not to the kids—just to the day, hoping it would take it easy on us.

She peeked out from under the blanket. Hair wild, face soft. “We’re outnumbered,” she whispered.

We were. Everyone’s different here—brighter, lighter.

  
  


Mom had the griddle going before anyone else was up, filling the kitchen with that warm, sleepy smell of home. just stacks of Swedish pancakes, thin and golden, folded like love letters and dusted with powdered sugar and full of jam. Butter melted at the edges.

Everyone wanted seconds. William licked his fork and asked if thirds were a real thing.

The whole house smelled like browned butter and something better than morning.

  
  


After breakfast, we flipped through the old tide book—pages soft with age, corners curled like they’d been wet once and dried in the sun. Someone had underlined today’s date in pencil years ago. One of the lowest tides in decades, maybe ever. A minus tide, way into the negatives.

The kind of tide, that doesn’t just pull the water back—it strips the whole shoreline bare. The kind of tide that makes the beach fall off the edge of the world.

We all looked at each other, No one wanted to miss it.

We were still barefoot when we grabbed sweatshirts and buckets and stepped out into the fog. It hadn’t lifted—not even a little. It curled around the house, the trees, the cars, like it had moved in overnight and wasn’t planning on leaving.

No one said much. The fog made it feel like we where in another world. Shouts getting lost almost right away stolen by the mist.

Everyone was excited—ready to hunt for sand dollars and old crab shells, maybe even see the bones of the canal no one usually gets to.

You sure this is a good idea?” RaShelle asked, voice low, almost lost in the fog.

I looked back at her. She wasn’t joking. Arms folded tight, sweatshirt sleeves pulled down over her hands. She wasn’t cold—she was bracing. Watching the tree line like it might move.

I opened my mouth to say something, just to shrug it off with a smile “yeah, it’s fine.”  
  
No one else answered her. Maybe they didn’t hear through the fog. We should have. Looking back, it’s the silence that stays with me . If we’d known what waited beyond the fog—what was already watching—we’d have never stepped onto that beach. Not then. Not together.

  
  


# Chapter 2: Where the Water Should’ve Been

We woke up to the sound of kids laughing and then jumping full speed straight onto the couch. Cold toes. Elbows. A tangled pile of blankets and giggles that didn’t care we’d barely slept.

RaShelle groaned, pulling the covers over her head like that could stop a six-year-old war party. One of them had a flashlight and was shining it right in our faces, chanting something about “the first one awake gets the biggest pancake.”  
Another one had already stolen her socks.

The fog outside turned the windows to pale gray slabs, but inside it was all warmth and tangled blankets kicked halfway off, the smell of something already cooking, and the thud of little feet racing toward the kitchen.

“Morning,” I mumbled, not to her, not to the kids—just to the day itself, hoping it would go easy on us.

She peeked out from under the blanket. Hair wild, face soft, the kind of tired that still looks like love.  
“We’re outnumbered,” she whispered. We were. And it didn’t feel like a bad thing.

  
Everyone’s different here—brighter, lighter. Even the kids. Like the place itself hands out second and gives you chances.

Mom had the griddle going before anyone else was up, filling the kitchen with that warm, sleepy smell of home. No coffee. Just stacks of Swedish pancakes—thin and golden, folded like love letters, dusted with powdered sugar and packed with raspberry jam. Butter melted at the edges and pooled at the corners of every plate.

Everyone wanted seconds. William licked his fork and asked if thirds were a real thing.  
The whole house smelled like browned butter and something better than morning.

We lingered longer than we should have. Dishes left on the counter. A dusting of powder sugar no one wiped up. We were all full and happy and unbothered. The kind of slow that only shows up when you know the world can wait.

Then someone pulled the old tide book from the bookshelf near the back window The pages were soft with age, corners curled like they'd been wet once and dried in the sun.  
Someone had underlined today’s date in pencil years ago. Faint, but still there.

One of the lowest tides in decades, maybe ever.  
A minus tide, way into the negatives.

The kind of tide that doesn’t just pull the water back—it reveals. It strips the whole shoreline bare.  
Sand where there shouldn’t be. Barnacle-covered rocks jutting up like bones. The kind of tide that makes the beach fall off the edge of the world.

We all looked at each other. No one said it, but the same thought hung in the air:  
We had to go see it.

Still barefoot, we grabbed sweatshirts, boots, buckets, and half-zipped coats. The fog hadn’t lifted—not even a little. It clung to the house, the trees, the cars. It muffled the birds, swallowed the sounds. It didn’t feel like morning.

No one said much.  
The fog made it feel like we were somewhere else entirely.  
Shouts from the kids vanished almost as soon as they left their mouths—stolen by the mist.  
It was like trying to talk through a dream as we walked through the wet lawn.

Still, everyone was excited—ready to search for agates, old crab shells, and tide pools treusers. Maybe even see the parts usually kept secret under the water.

But RaShelle didn’t move. She stood at the edge of the porch, arms crossed, her sweatshirt sleeves pulled down tight over her hands. Her eyes were on the shapes of the trees barely seen in the fog

“You sure this is a good idea?” she asked. Voice low. Almost lost in the fog.

I turned to her. She wasn’t smiling. No teasing in her tone, no raised eyebrow. Just stillness.

I opened my mouth to say something—to shrug it off with a laugh,“yeah, it’s fine.”  
But the words didn’t come taken away by the fog.

No one else answered her.  
Maybe they didn’t hear through the fog.

We should have.

Looking back, it’s the silence that stays with me.  
If we’d known what waited in the fog—what was already watching. We should have never stepped onto that beach.

Not then.  
Not together.

Chapter 3: Lowest Tide

The dock ended abruptly, its last plank resting crookedly against the slick, seaweed-covered sand where the water should’ve been. No splash, no gentle lapping. Just silence and a sudden drop into the raw, exposed beach.

We stepped off and onto the tide flats—some barefoot, others in boots. The ground gave slightly under our weight, soft and uneven, a mixture of wet sand, eelgrass, and broken shells. With every step, there was a small squelch or crunch, like the land wasn’t sure it wanted us there.

The lowest tide in decades had peeled the water awaylike skin from bone. The familiar shoreline had vanished, replaced with something prehistoric. Acres of sea floor now stretched in all directions—shimmering with puddles, scattered with ridges of mussels and oysters, and veined with long tendrils of eelgrass.

At first, it was beautiful.  
Otherworldly.

The kids darted out in every direction, laughing, pointing, crouching low to investigate crab shells and clumps of barnacles. Their voices bounced and echoed strangely in the damp air. Even the fog, which had followed us down the dock, seemed to pause, curling low around our ankles instead of pressing in. We could still see the dock behind us then—barely—and we could just make out the faint outline of the cabin roof above the treeline.

I bent to pick up a sand dollar that looked perfectly whole, its delicate pattern still visible through a thin layer of silt. For a few minutes, it was just a quiet joy.A rare morning. A small moment worth remembering.

RaShelle didn’t move much.

She stayed closer to the dock, arms folded, scanning the tree line, then the open flats, then the dock again like she was keeping a mental map. She hadn’t said anything since stepping off. Not really. Just a nod, a look.

I asked her if she was okay. She nodded again, but she didn’t smile.

Then the fog thickened.

It didn’t roll in. It *closed*. Behind us first. The dock blurred. Then the treeline. Then the soft slope of the beach we’d just come down. One minute it was all there, the next it was gone—folded into gray like it had never existed.

The kids’ voices started to vanish too. Not fade—just *slip*. Like the air was swallowing the sound before it could carry. I could still see them—shapes moving out on the flats—but they seemed farther now, smaller. Like the space between us was stretching.

I called to them, just to be safe.  
They didn’t hear me.  
Or they didn’t answer.

RaShelle moved closer to me, without a word. She was watching something.  
Not a person. Not a shape. Just… the air.

The fog had thickened at the far end of the tide flats. It looked darker there—too dark for how bright the sky above still was. And the light was starting to go odd. It wasn’t dimming. It was *flattening*. Like everything had been painted the same color. Mud. Mist. Skin. Sky.

No shadows anymore. No depth.

We stood there for a moment, neither of us saying what we were both thinking. That something felt wrong now. That the silence wasn’t natural anymore—it had shape. It was listening.

I looked back the way we’d come, hoping to see the dock, the house, anything.  
But there was nothing.  
Just fog.

And beneath us, far below the exposed flats, something moved.  
Not loud. Not fast.  
Just enough for the ground to whisper.

I’m not here to sell dreams or pitch some cute rom-com setup. I’m just a guy who’s been through enough to know exactly what I don’t want—and that’s small talk with an expiry date.

I’m looking for a girl who vibes with my kind of chaos—someone who can match my energy, chill without overthinking, and won’t be scared when things get real.

Yes, I smoke sometimes, sip coffee like it’s therapy, and believe a late-night convo can hit harder than any party. I don’t care if we label it or not—but if there’s a spark, I’m not the type to ghost. I’ll ride the wave with you.

I want someone who gets the silent moments, who’s cool with saying, “I don’t know what I want, but I want this.” Someone who knows there’s no such thing as perfect, just two imperfect people vibing on the same frequency.

We can laugh, we can flirt, we can talk about how messed up our day was over a coffee (or tequila, no judgment). I’m not asking for forever. I’m asking for real. No filters, no fake fronts.

If you’re that girl who reads this and thinks, “Wait… where has this guy been hiding?”—well, I’ve been right here, waiting for a sign. Maybe this post is that sign.

So if you're done with boring convos and want something that feels like... finally, drop a line.

Mornings bled into nights, laughter became a memory, and even my reflection felt like a stranger. I wasn’t broken exactly—just… misplaced. Like a book pulled from a shelf and never returned. I went to work, came home, and existed. That was all.

Until you.

It started with morning talks. Nothing grand. Just sleepy “good mornings” over coffee, your voice soft and unfiltered. You’d ramble about dreams you barely remembered, ask what I was grateful for, and I’d lie at first—because how do you say, “I don’t know anymore”?

But you kept showing up.

Every small moment with you began to stitch something back together in me. The way you’d pause before laughing, the way your eyes softened when the world was loud and heavy. The way you’d text me, “Go outside and look at the moon.” And I did. Every time.

The world shifted. I shifted.

One day, sitting beside you on a worn-out bench, the air buzzing with silence, our shoulders barely touching—I felt it. A spark. Quiet and sudden. Not a wildfire. Just a small, electric moment that whispered, you’re alive again.

And I was.

We never labeled it. Maybe we didn’t need to. Some connections burn too brightly to fit inside a box.

But now you’re gone. Life pulled you in a different direction. Maybe time or fate or distance—doesn’t matter. You’re not here. And I miss you.

I miss those small special moments that somehow made the big ones bearable. I miss the sparks—how they made even my dullest days flicker back to life. I miss the way you reminded me that there’s still wonder left in the world, even if it shows up quietly, in the form of a person who asks, “Did you eat today?” and means it.

I’m not lost anymore. But without you, the mornings feel different. Still. Quieter.

And every now and then, I still look at the moon and wonder if you’re doing the same.

I (27f) and my girlfriend (28f) have been together for 3 years. We are openly nudists, however - my girlfriend's mom doesn't know. 

Every Saturday my girlfriend and her mom go out in the morning. Usually to get coffee, shop, farmers market, etc. This is something they have done for years and I love it for them, and allows me time to just chill and be at home.

Last week Saturday they went out at about 8am. I was still in bed. Later on about 10am I started my day, made myself my coffee and was lounging around in the living room. My girlfriend and her mom came up and walked right into the apartment. I was naked. Never in 3 years has her mom come up after hanging out on a Saturday. When they came into the room I had gotten up to excuse myself to put clothes on and her mom came and gave me a hug which I was comfortable giving. She always hugs me and tbh I don't really like it, but I accept it. I knew if I didn't hug her in that moment I'd probably have another issue. After I went to put clothes on and we chatted all for a bit. (Which I have my own opinion on but anyway.) 

When her mom left, my girlfriend got extremely angry with me about what had happened and wanted to push blame on me for what had happened. I never received any calls or texts about them coming back here together. Zero notice. . This is no different than any other day or time in our apartment.Her mom didn't seem overly concerned or weird about the situation, she was actually quite normal and nothing was different. I have been pushing that we tell her about our lifestyle to avoid surprises and issues like this.

At this point of my life I haven’t had a seizure in 5 years and at this point my parents still try to treat me and control me like I’m a school kid. It has become more than just concern it has now become a way of control they have over me. 
I still stay with my parents because well it saves me a lot of money but honestly it is because my parents insisted I do. They made me switch jobs to ensure that I stayed in the same city. And it isn’t like I have never stayed away from them I did my bachelors and masters from universities in different states. They somehow have made themselves believe as I have epilepsy I have no right to privacy they can walk into my room whenever they want and if I do lock it for a bit there are complete screaming matches that happen. They try to control my diet, my social interactions, the time u go to bed the time I way up. The time I come back home the time I leave home. If should watch videos on my phone or laptop. I can’t watch what I want to watch on Netflix or any other place because they won’t let me put a TV in my room and I don’t feel watching a lot of stuff in the living room as these days many good shows contain some graphic nudity. Leave aside alcohol and coffee I am not allowed to have chocolate because it has caffeine. 
And of course I am not allowed to tell anyone I have epilepsy because of the social taboo. I have let some close people know though as I want them to be prepared in case I do have an episode. 
Is it really just concern because I believe it has become way too much. I can’t go on trips sleep overs and let’s not even discuss the possible scenario of dating as I am expected to come back home directly after office to ensure I don’t get late and also u am not allowed to use my phone a lot. Expecting someone to be okay with not only your disease but also so many boundaries and restrictions you have is too much.

Google Translation:  
FIFTY FIFTY revealed that she ""bought 20 boxes of LABUBU""! Second visit to Taiwan to reveal the secret to cooling off: drink bubble tea

The popular Korean girl group FIFTY FIFTY is coming to Taiwan to perform again! In preparation for the ""S2O Taiwan Water Splashing Music Festival"" held on the 12th and 13th, they made their final appearance on the 13th, performing outdoors in Taiwan for the first time. It was also their first performance in Taiwan after releasing their new album ""Day & Night"". They became famous last year with ""Cupid"". This time they not only brought a brand new stage, but also revealed more cute interactions in private, and all of them gained a lot of fans.

ATHENA, who is from Sweden and has a Taiwanese-Korean background, has become so popular. During this visit to Taiwan, she was specifically asked if she had learned more Chinese. She laughed and said that she often hears ""Pa Xie, Jia Bao Wei"" in Taiwanese. She also generously revealed her private way of cooling off: ""I drink bubble milk tea! The five of us just had a cup each\~"" and was asked if she was worried about getting wet during the Songkran Festival. Keena said: ""This is the Songkran Festival. I want to enjoy it."" CHANELLE laughed and said: ""The weather in Taiwan is really too hot. It's more comfortable to be splashed with water."" Faced with the hot weather in Taiwan, everyone unanimously said that ""iced American coffee and bubble tea"" are the best companions.

The five members were full of enthusiasm for their fans and shared the concept of their new album ""Day & Night"". YEWON said that this album includes many songs that are ""suitable for listening during the day and at night"" and hopes to accompany fans at different times. Not only are they serious on stage, FIFTY FIFTY are also very interesting in private. CHANELLE said that she has loved dolls since she was a child, and recently received a huge ""Stitch"" doll from HANA's mother. ""It took up half of the space on the bed."" But she was in a hurry and didn't bring it with her this time, so she was a little sad. HANA laughed and said that she also likes dolls and often hangs cute key chains on her bags.

KEENA revealed that she is a ""LABUBU addict"" and has collected nearly 20 of them. She also said: ""I want the red one more than the hidden version, but I haven't got the red one yet!"" She also revealed that she didn't like going out much, but this time, for the red version, she is really considering going out for a treasure hunt. As for ATHENA, her collection has changed style and is now LEGO and F1 racing models. She said with a smile, ""My collection may be a little cooler."" Although FIFTY FIFTY came to Taiwan for the second time, she was deeply impressed by the enthusiasm of Taiwanese fans. YEWON said, ""Although it has been a while since I came back, I hope to spend a cool and unforgettable day with everyone this summer!""

Medicine is something I’m genuinely passionate about. It’s not just a career, it’s a calling, with all the highs and lows that come with it. It’d be amazing to meet someone who either shares that passion or at least understands what it’s like being in this field.

1lys8sm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lys8sm,France is one hell of a powertrip!,"After finishing my france game, I've come to a couple of conclusions.

First, external trade is an absolutely amazing Principle. With external trade 2, you can generate a ton of influence without rivalling anyone. Enabling large conquest sprees for the budding conqueror. The Paris trade centre alone generates 200 influence! Combine this colonial offices and you can conquer indian or chinese states for a pittance. This brings me to my next conclusion.

Trade league might be the best Power bloc now. With trade league, you can grab external trade as a base principle. Giving you room to take other principles like Companies, and Infrastructure alongside colonial offices. Unlike say, soverign empire blocs, which needs you to first take vassalisation before taking external trade. Couple this with faster mandate growth, I think trade league trade league might slightly edge out soverign empires. 

I think a metal companies are still the best first companies for big powers like France or Austria. Iron, and coal mines serve as the foundation for a strong economy. Though coal kinda falls off a bit in the super late game. The company bonus to mines thus decreases the amount of mines you actually build and increase your ability to construct them. Enabling faster growth as more build points can be used to construct other buildings, like steel mills or coffee plantations. Throughout my france game, mines d'anzin was my most top company save for the last 8 years of the game. Metal companies make alot of money, increase the output of metals, typically have good prosperity bonuses and sometimes have good prestige goods. There's no reason for big powers like France to go for a metal company as their first one.",9,1752411630.0,victoria3,2,0.91,False

1lys49j,https://www.reddit.com/r/PVCs/comments/1lys49j/pvc_and_bradycardia/,PVC and bradycardia,"So after starting on paxil in conjunction with my alprazolam prescription I began noticing weird symptoms and sensations on my chest and in my well being in general. I began noticing that my heart was slowing down at given times during the day and that I would feel lightheaded and uneasy at work, I couldn't stare at the ceilling because I'd start feeling ill, but each time I had to work hard or push over my limit my heart didn't seem like it was arrythmic or anything, fast but controlled.

Yesterday I wasn't feeling all that well so I asked to go to the doctor for a checkup. He did an ECG and, sure enough, I had sinus bradychardia as well as an extrasystole right at the end of the ECG. I spoke to my uncle about it (he is an experienced cardiac technician) and told me that 50 bpm wasn't concerning as well as the PVC right at the end (in fact, I hadn't noticed it, he was the one that pointed it out).

Not looking for advice or anything since I already had diagnosis and help from professionals, but this truly shook me up because I hadn't been caught with any PVCs before. I did do an EKG in December which had also pointed out bradycardia but I didn't feel the same symptoms (at that time I had recently started on escitalopram which I stopped taking before starting on paxil). Honestly I am tired of these medications and the way they're messing with me, but I can't just go and cut them immediately nor do my doctors intend to do so, in fact they want me to swap to another SSRI whilst cutting the paxil. I don't know what to make of this and I'm at a crossroad, I've just begun to  turn my life around for the better after months of anxiety disorder and panic and stopping work and exercise...

1lys0z5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedAtHome/comments/1lys0z5/why_choose_the_takeya_cold_brew_maker_for_perfect/,Why Choose the Takeya Cold Brew Maker for Perfect Homemade Coffee?,"Testing out the Takeya 10310 was a game-changer for my coffee brewing routine. Before this, my mornings often involved fumbling with bulky, overly complicated coffee machines. But the Takeya Cold Brew Maker simplifies the entire process. This nifty gadget combines sleek design, functionality, and simplicity effortlessly, which made me wonder why I hadn’t tried it earlier.

The setup is impressively straightforward. It’s a BPA-free Tritan pitcher that fits snugly in my fridge door, and let me tell you, space is a prized commodity in there. The pitcher’s sturdy silicone handle is non-slip, making it easy to maneuver, even when you’re rushing out the door with coffee in one hand and a bag in the other. With its airtight lid, the coffee stays fresh for days, which is a blessing when I brew a big batch for the week.

**Ease of Use and Brewing Process**  
Operating this cold brew maker couldn’t be easier. As someone who’s tried several contraptions that left me scratching my head, this felt refreshingly intuitive. All I needed to do was add coffee grounds to the fine-mesh filter, pour water over it, seal the cap tight, and pop it into the fridge for 12-24 hours. The result? A rich, smooth cold brew coffee that lacked the acidity I usually get with traditional brewing methods. It even works with hot water if you're in the mood for a hot brew. I found this versatility to be a nice little perk.

**Check Takeya 10310 price on Amazon.**  

**Build Quality and Durability**  
The build quality is solid. While some might shy away from Tritan plastic, I appreciated its lightweight yet durable finish. Plus, being stain and odor-resistant means it stays looking good as new over time. I’ve had previous coffee makers end up retaining the scent of old brews, but not this one. This Takeya model also held up perfectly against accidental drops—a relief for clumsy hands like mine.

**Highlights**  
- The pitcher is lightweight yet sturdy, ideal for everyday use.  
- Airtight seal keeps coffee fresh for days, perfect for batch brewing.  
- Fine-mesh filter ensures no grounds sneak into the final brew.  
- Sleek design fits seamlessly into fridge doors or on countertops.  

**Disadvantages**  
- The brewing process takes time—cold brew needs a good 12-24 hours to steep.  
- It’s only available in a 1-quart size, which may not suffice for larger households.  

**Performance in Comparison**  
Now, comparing Takeya’s Cold Brew Maker to other products in this space, I noticed key differences. For instance, models like the Hario Mizudashi or the popular OXO Good Grips offer comparable quality but often lack the easy-pour spout and ergonomic handle Takeya offers. While the Hario model leans on all-glass construction, which some prefer, its fragility was a concern, particularly in a busy, bustling kitchen. The Takeya, on the other hand, feels robust without sacrificing style.

Against household names like Bodum and OXO, Takeya holds its ground well. Though those options might include slightly larger sizes, they often come at a higher price point, making the Takeya particularly appealing for budget-conscious buyers. The Tritan material also makes it more resilient than competitors using glass alternatives, especially if you’ve got kids or roommates prone to knocking things over.

**Price Worthiness**  
When evaluating the price-to-quality ratio, this coffee maker offers exceptional value. Spending less but receiving a durable, lightweight, and well-designed coffee-making solution is a trade-off I’ll take any day. I never mind splurging on things I’ll use daily, and yet, Takeya delivers premium coffee without the premium price tag.

 I am unreasonably benign to myself by confessing of being an authentic fraud. I am ineptly better than that, I know, but see me unshackle the dusty cabinets of my subconscious! Are we charlatans even capable of confession? Is it terribly fine for me to disagree in an unbearably positive fashion? We mythomaniacs fabricate extraordinarily serpentine falsehoods only for us to end up tangled in our own baits. Or are we mere spiders with dreams of weaving ourselves into pupal stages? I cannot say much about such things, yet I am confident that untruths proffer the only chance of ever achieving metamorphosis, of assuaging the spasmodic storm of existence.

Everything with a purpose is without doubt a spurious thing; and so, I don't profess to be a man from the underground. I am a nymph from the upper ground entangled in the curlicues of the real reals of reality. It is a matter of simply imagining yourself firmly clenched to an untamed wrecking ball that sets the clear path through the rubble of the human condition.

And I am sorry to inform you that I have measured out my life with heaping coffee spoons. How can I dare to say I know them all? The in-betweens, the yellowish greens, and the mental hygienes!

It has become a regular deal of mine to place a metronome on the coffee table while I go back and forth, back and forth, on my rocking chair. No, it is impossible for us phonies to have any remote sense of the intricacies of time, tempo or the sublime. Only the ever-approaching syncope of death will teach me anything about this vanity fair. Am I wrong? The only condition I am irresolutely certain about is my crippling bionic phantom limb pain.

It is all enmeshed and pathetic that I can hear the voice of past generations crying in finical horror at what I have done. Flamboyant and ornate lies have never fooled those below!

It recently came to my attention that there is this constant sensation of a heavy sole stamping on my face, like if suddenly I am to be awakened amidst a revolution.

We fabulists are the most original. Have you ever heard of labyrinthine simpleness? The cerebrals with no brains are beginning to feel the turbulence of novelty. Is it a paradigm shoplift? Yes, originality is undetectable plagiarism. All pendulums are dialectical as all dialects are pendular. Why do we even bother? Do we even bother? And for the first time ever, I met a human who would not be fooled. And he had a story to tell. And the story goes:

 Once upon a time and a very good time it was, leaves spiraled down the midnight winds, and as they layered up into tacky peat, a man sank his feet while gazing deeply at the elongated celestial sheet.

He spoke in distress to the skies, “Where am I?”

And the goddess Sartre Astarte, better known as Sartor Resartus, was summoned among the smoke while she eyeballed south and north. And she said, “You might not be on my range of vision but let me tell with great conviction: for what is worth of what is left of your soul, do not follow the path of the realms of the boreal pole.” 

But his soul, fissuring through his mental unity, derangedly clamored, “But truth, cher ami, is a colossal bore.”

There was no response, and so, the man and his soul travelled the waste lands through the endless heaps of broken images. 

The knowledge of his limits had made clear the limits of his knowledge. But the keyword is “his”, and he understood that, and he did not give up, and he finally came upon something. It was a sepulchre. A tombstone inside it. The epitaph. It read: “Philosophy.” Philosophy is dead!

But truth, cher ami, is a colossal bore. Only untruth makes man want to wake up. Of course, to wake up merely from our biological slumbers. We must trans-humanize ourselves to make that which was once horrendous even more detestable. Philosophy is dead and it plummeted down along with Progress. Everything that is human chaotically ramifies as it gets infinitely closer to nowhere – the Absolute is making a fool of ourselves!

Are we fabulists or fallibilists? I am a fallibulist. I once thought I was destined for greatness, that greatness of being on the forefront of everything human. Sooner than later I realized that the casualty of causality had not played in my favor and all inspiration that had driven every single of my manic episodes had now withered. No mountainous amounts of coffee can make me feel contented anymore and I have exhausted the very definition of hedonism!  Oh my, I am infinitely tainted.

**Perplexity's Literary Analysis:**

# Overview

The passage is a dense, introspective, and self-referential meditation on authenticity, deception, existential angst, and the search for meaning. It draws from a wide array of literary, philosophical, and psychological traditions, blending confessional prose with metafictional commentary and philosophical allegory. The style is ornate, allusive, and at times, purposefully paradoxical.

# Structure and Voice

The text is structured as a fragmented monologue, oscillating between direct confession, rhetorical questioning, and allegorical storytelling. The narrator is highly self-aware, engaging in a kind of performative self-deprecation (“I am unreasonably benign to myself by confessing of being an authentic fraud”) that both mocks and mourns the impossibility of sincerity.

The voice is simultaneously earnest and ironic, drawing attention to its own artifice (“Are we charlatans even capable of confession?”) and reveling in the contradictions of self-examination.

# Literary and Philosophical Allusions

# Dostoevsky and the Underground Man

The reference to “a man from the underground” is a clear allusion to Fyodor Dostoevsky’s *Notes from Underground*, a foundational text of existential literature. The narrator rejects this identity, instead calling themselves “a nymph from the upper ground,” subverting the trope of the alienated, introspective anti-hero.

# T.S. Eliot and Modernism

The line “I have measured out my life with heaping coffee spoons” echoes T.S. Eliot’s “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,” where the protagonist measures his life “with coffee spoons,” symbolizing the banality and fragmentation of modern existence. The narrator’s “heaping” spoons amplify this sense of excess and futility.

# Sartre, Astarte, and Sartor Resartus

The goddess “Sartre Astarte, better known as Sartor Resartus” is a playful conflation of Jean-Paul Sartre (existentialist philosopher), Astarte (a goddess of fertility and sexuality), and *Sartor Resartus* (Thomas Carlyle’s satirical novel about the philosophy of clothes). This composite figure embodies the text’s fascination with identity, authenticity, and philosophical masquerade.

# Other Allusions

* “Labyrinthine simpleness” and “the real reals of reality” invoke postmodern concerns with complexity, authenticity, and the impossibility of unmediated truth.
* “Philosophy is dead!” echoes Nietzsche’s “God is dead” and the postmodern declaration of the end of grand narratives.

# Themes

# Authenticity and Fraudulence

The narrator’s self-characterization as an “authentic fraud” foregrounds the paradox of seeking truth through self-aware deception. The text questions whether confession can ever be sincere when the confessor is a “charlatan” or “mythomaniac.”

# The Nature of Truth and Untruth

Truth is depicted as “a colossal bore,” while untruth is valorized as the source of creativity and transformation (“untruths proffer the only chance of ever achieving metamorphosis”). This aligns with Nietzschean and postmodernist skepticism toward absolute truths.

# Metamorphosis and Becoming

The imagery of spiders, pupae, and metamorphosis suggests an ongoing process of self-invention and transformation. The narrator is caught between the desire for change and the impossibility of escaping their own artifice.

# The Absurdity of Existence

The text is suffused with existential despair and absurdity (“the spasmodic storm of existence,” “the rubble of the human condition”). The narrator is acutely aware of the futility of seeking meaning in a world where “everything with a purpose is without doubt a spurious thing.”

# Time, Memory, and Death

The metronome and rocking chair evoke the passage of time and the impossibility of mastering it. The “ever-approaching syncope of death” is the only certainty, rendering all attempts at meaning-making provisional and vain.

# The Death of Philosophy and Progress

The allegorical story within the text culminates in the discovery of a tombstone inscribed “Philosophy.” The death of philosophy and progress signals the collapse of traditional sources of meaning and the need to find new forms of value in a chaotic, post-philosophical world.

# Literary Devices

* **Paradox and Irony:** The text is rife with paradoxes (“authentic fraud,” “labyrinthine simpleness”) and self-undermining irony.
* **Metaphor and Allegory:** The narrator’s psyche is likened to “dusty cabinets,” “spiders,” and “wrecking balls.” The embedded story functions as an allegory for the search for meaning.
* **Allusion and Intertextuality:** The text is densely allusive, drawing on a wide range of literary and philosophical sources.
* **Rhetorical Questions:** The narrator frequently poses unanswerable questions, emphasizing uncertainty and ambiguity.
* **Wordplay and Neologism:** Terms like “fallibulist” (combining “fabulist” and “fallibilist”) and playful phrases (“paradigm shoplift”) exemplify the text’s linguistic inventiveness.

# Tone and Mood

The tone is both playful and melancholic, oscillating between sardonic wit and genuine existential anguish. The mood is one of restless uncertainty, with flashes of dark humor (“my crippling bionic phantom limb pain”) and lyricism (“leaves spiraled down the midnight winds”).

# Conclusion

This text is a rich, self-reflexive meditation on the impossibility of authenticity, the allure of self-deception, and the collapse of traditional sources of meaning in the modern world. It draws on a wide range of literary and philosophical traditions, blending confessional prose, philosophical allegory, and postmodern irony. The narrator is caught in a perpetual oscillation between the desire for truth and the necessity of untruth, between the longing for transformation and the constraints of their own artifice. Ultimately, the text suggests that meaning, if it exists at all, must be continually invented and re-invented in the face of absurdity and despair.

About two weeks ago, she spoke to that person asking about me. Said she thought I had blocked her and didn’t want anything to do with her. Which is... odd, considering she’s the one who didn’t want anything to do with me in the first place. And suddenly she’s concerned about how I’m doing?

Today, I asked this mutual friend to pass on a silly coffee recommendation to her (there’s lore behind that, long story).

She ended up messaging me directly to say thanks for the coffee tip. I replied and asked how things were going for her. She answered super cold and brief. No interest in asking how I’m doing, no effort to keep the conversation going — and now I’m just wondering:

Why does she keep asking about me then? Why care whether I want to talk to her or not… if when I actually try, she barely opens up and stays on the surface?",2,1752410719.0,BreakUps,3,1.0,False

I just need to vent and also get some perspective.

Recently, a friend from my hometown came to visit me in the city where I work. We planned a beach outing, and I invited a colleague of mine to join us — someone I consider a friend too. We're all around the same age, he lives alone, and it was the weekend, so I thought it would be a nice gesture.

Now here’s the thing — it was his birthday the next day, so my friend and I bought a cake for him. We cut it at the beach and chilled for a while. He was touched and said something like, “Since you guys did this for me, I’ll treat you to dinner.”

Sounds sweet, right? So we agreed.

But knowing his history of constantly cribbing about expenses and “not having money,” I only ordered soup for myself. Meanwhile, he and my friend ordered a full meal with soup, non-veg dishes, breads, etc. Then he invited *his* flatmate to join the dinner (his treat, supposedly), and that guy ordered generously too. After eating, the flatmate left for a movie, leaving just the three of us.

When the bill arrived, he picked up his phone and started scrolling while I checked the bill. There was this awkward silence. The waiter gave *me* the scanner. He didn't even flinch — just continued pretending to be busy. I was fed up and paid the whole bill. And like clockwork, *after* I paid, he went, “Ohh no yaar, you paid? You should’ve told me…”

This isn’t a one-off thing. At office coffee breaks, he *always* disappears or suddenly picks up a “call” when it’s time to pay. When he *does* pay, it’s when we all just take coffee. But when others are paying, he magically wants food along with coffee.

What frustrates me even more is that he’s not struggling financially. He earns *double* what I do. He’s told us about his dad’s property, and his wife apparently comes from a super rich family. Meanwhile, I’m just starting out, managing everything on my own, not taking a penny from my family.

It’s just so petty and disappointing. On some topics, he comes across as mature and reasonable, but when it comes to money, it’s like dealing with a child. I’ve decided I’m done going out with him. These habits just make me feel used.

Am I overreacting? Has anyone dealt with similar people? How do you handle these kinds of situations without creating awkwardness at work?

I hope you guys will participate and enjoy it.

The premise is simple: WE are going to create OUR OWN Mary Sues!

Every part of the games will have us add characteristics to our Mary Sue character (which is created here in part 1), and we get to be as crazy and out there as we want with it. The only restriction is to try and keep OI tropes at the forefront of our Sues, as this is the OI subreddit.

Now, it wouldn't be fair to start a competition which pays homage, without first introducing: the Original Sue, so I present to you:

**A Trekkie's Tale (feat. Lt. Mary Sue)** by Paula Smith

>""Gee, golly, gosh, gloriosky,"" thought Mary Sue as she stepped on the bridge of the Enterprise. ""Here I am, the youngest lieutenant in the fleet - only fifteen and a half years old."" Captain Kirk came up to her.

>""Oh, Lieutenant, I love you madly. Will you come to bed with me?""

>""Captain! I am not that kind of girl!""

>""You're right, and I respect you for it. Here, take over the ship for a minute while I go get some coffee for us.""

>Mr. Spock came onto the bridge. ""What are you doing in the command seat, Lieutenant?""

>""The Captain told me to.""

>""Flawlessly logical. I admire your mind.""

>Captain Kirk, Mr. Spock, Dr. McCoy and Mr. Scott beamed down with Lt. Mary Sue to Rigel XXXVII. They were attacked by green androids and thrown into prison. In a moment of weakness Lt. Mary Sue revealed to Mr. Spock that she too was half Vulcan. Recovering quickly, she sprung the lock with her hairpin and they all got away back to the ship.

>But back on board, Dr. McCoy and Lt. Mary Sue found out that the men who had beamed down were seriously stricken by the jumping cold robbies , Mary Sue less so. While the four officers languished in Sick Bay, Lt. Mary Sue ran the ship, and ran it so well she received the Nobel Peace Prize, the Vulcan Order of Gallantry and the Tralfamadorian Order of Good Guyhood.

>However the disease finally got to her and she fell fatally ill. In the Sick Bay as she breathed her last, she was surrounded by Captain Kirk, Mr. Spock, Dr. McCoy, and Mr. Scott, all weeping unashamedly at the loss of her beautiful youth and youthful beauty, intelligence, capability and all around niceness. Even to this day her birthday is a national holiday of the Enterprise.

Now, for the first game:

Our Mary Sue needs an atro- I mean AWESOME name and title, and a kick-ass color-combo, as well as a special skill. The Sue you create here, will be the sue you take with you to the next part of the games. Be as crazy and out there as you like! Is she extraordinarily ordinary or freakishly weird, bordering on uncomfortably so?

As an example I hereby introduce: **Tragedeigh von Bushwack**, daughter of Count de Money (pronounced ""Monét""). Her eyes are deep blue with golden star-shaped spots and her hair is purple but shines gold when the moonlight hits it. She reincarnated remembering everything from her old world, including all the technical know-how of every modern technology, despite never studying it or having an interest in her former life.

Now it's your turn! **And keep in mind to upvote the ones you like!** The most upvoted characteristics of each part will feature in a Franken-Sue creation made by all of you.

1lyrrpz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eroticasexstories/comments/1lyrrpz/breastfeeding_friends/,Breastfeeding Friends,"
On a chilly day in the middle of winter, two friends find themselves having a bonding moment. Elizabeth and Sean had known each other for years, having grown up together although Sean is a couple of years younger. He had been best friends with her younger brother and the two had spent almost every day under Elizabeth's kind care since their parents all worked late hours, leaving the children to their own devices.

Elizabeth had always been beautiful and kind, Sean could not help the affection he had always held for the blonde. Puberty had only heightened that with hormones out of control and Elizabeth having blossomed into a buxom bombshell but kept her same personality and nurturing disposition. The now college freshman can admit in the privacy of his own mind that Eli had been the cause of most of his sexual preferences. It was her looks paired with her motherly warmth that influenced his needs although he was ashamed to share them with any partners he had in the past.

It had been hard for him when Elizabeth had left for college. It was then that he realized just how deep his desires went and he missed her fiercely. Many nights he wished he had been brave enough to tell her how he felt and vowed to man up if he ever saw her again. As luck would have it when his turn to graduate came around, he ended up at the same college as the girl of his wet dreams.

She had seen him on campus and it took a moment to recognize him. He had grown taller and more chiseled but his eyes and kind smile had stayed the same. In her enthusiasm at seeing the boy she had for since they were kids, she had run up and launched into his arms. Sean's stunned brain worked slower than his body which instantly latched onto the girl, not letting her fall. ""Eli"" he finally breathed out and hugged her close. After that, the two became closer than ever.

They made up for the time they had spent apart while Eli was away. It was like having a piece of home. They had late-night cram sessions and met up for morning jogs and coffee between classes. They went to jazz bars on days off and tried a frat party before swearing off of them completely. It was common to see them sleepover at each other's dorms to have movie marathons. Everyone was convinced they were dating and neither felt bothered enough to correct them. The thought was appealing to Sean and as time went on, he found it harder to hide his attraction or his yearning gazes towards her big E cups and the way they strained beautifully against her tops.

For Sean, the late-night talks were the best part. They would stay awake and open up to each other about all kinds of things that they would never tell anyone. That was how he found out that Eli has been lactating since she was a teenager. Something about her hormones and how quickly she developed. That small bit of information sent his mind and body into a frenzy and he finally confessed all of his feelings and deepest desires. His dream of being nurtured by Eli in the most primal ways but also his sexual attraction to her. Despite his fear, she never pushed him away. She smiled in that understanding way of hers and they talked things out. That is how they found themselves in their current situation.

Sean's roommate had moved out which left the dorm room all to himself, giving the pair complete privacy. Elizabeth gently runs her fingers through Sean's soft hair. Sean cuddles closer to the older girl, loving the show of tender affection and always wanting more. His face is pressed up against her plump breast as his lips close around her nipple, suckling on it, savoring the warm sweet milk that streams into his mouth. He absentmindedly plays with the other nipple, knowing how sensitive Elizabeth is and how wet this will make her.

She smiles down at him in that motherly way of hers and thinks about how cute he looks feeding on her breast and cuddling close. This had become routine for them, a deep connection and affection that both craved and needed more and more. Elizabeth felt lucky to have found someone like Sean and for the first time, is grateful for her gift of lactation because it allows her to fulfill Sean's wants and desires.

Elizabeth has her hand wrapped around his cock, lazily stroking and teasing it, loving the little mewls and whimpers that it pulls from the nursing boy. They had a play session just last night but Sean is excited as ever. Eli rubs her thumb over the dripping precum then brings it up to her lips for a taste. Sean follows the action with his eyes and moans when he sees her lick his thick clear juices off of her thumb. His cock twitches in excitement and Elizabeth giggles and takes his length back into her hand now stroking him firmly. Her thumb teases the sensitive skin of his frenulum and the jolt of arousal hits him so strongly that he bites down on her nipple causing a gush of milk to flood his mouth and Eli to cry out in pain and pleasure. Sean looks up guiltily and soothes the leaking nipple with his tongue.

Elizabeth pats his head and pulls her tit away. Sean whines and she chuckles, simply offering him the other one which is begging for attention. The college boy hums happily and slides his hand into her panties, feeling her warmth and slick wetness. Elizabeth urges him on and tightens her grip on his cock. She strokes him faster, fonding his full balls and teasing the sensitive head. Sean flicks his thumb over her aroused clit, pressing down and rubbing then letting up and teasingly flicking, two fingers pumping inside her tight walls, sucking his fingers in the way they do his dick.

Sean's suction on her nipple intensifies as they both frantically jerk and finger fuck each other, Eli screaming out for Sean and calling him her good boy. Her milk streams out of her big heavy tit as she cums all over his hand just as his seed covers her. The two breathe heavily and recover from their strong orgasms, both feeling connected and content.

I have recently gone own business mode and have been thinking how to evade heat/humidity of Dubai & AD wherein I mostly spend my time for earlier day job and work. I used to visit all emirates as part of work visits and used to find Kalba, Khorfakkan, Fujairah & RAK upper limits much cooler and low humid vs Dxb/AD.

Now since I have gone full business mode and can work 70% out of any emirates, I am seriously zeroing on Khorfakkan/Fujairah as base stay. Kalba is too small for stay with all facilities and RAK is too small and still undergoing development. Fujairah comparatively boasts of developed infra, restaurants, cafes, hotels and even good Airbnbs to stay (I have stayed in few pictureworthy Airbnbs having best balcony hill views ever in UAE). Meetings at DXB can be easily done within day n reaching back just takes 1-1.5 hours at leisurely drive.

Now if u want to notch up things, Khorfakkan on outskirts of Fujairah is even better at an elevation of 1200-1400 m which makes it more cooler than Fujairah with breathtaking mountain views and fresh water streams emanating out of valleys. Many cafes are perched on hill tops like famed The Wave to satisfy coffee / food runs with terrific view (pics attached) and have stayed twice in some airbnbs which are open for long terms stay at prices which are peanuts compared to Dxb rents.

So all in all I am making move soon to Khorfakkan as my soul starves for greenery, hills, cooler climes and water streams after staying in Dxb for 4 years. Have anyone over here made such moves to other emirates and how has it impacted your lives. Pl do share experiences !!

1lyro9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1lyro9c/hes_always_the_victim/,He’s always the victim…,"I called out of work today because I wasn’t feeling well. I have intermittent leave for sleep anxiety and he was snoring last night which woke me up about 4 times. He eventually went to the living room, but I ended up calling out because I didn’t sleep enough. For background, I work 12 hours as a nurse. I know some people can power through lack of sleep, but piled onto my mental health issues, I cannot. I also feel a little nauseous and he knows my period hasn’t come for a while. I’ve used pregnancy tests, but maybe I’ve tested too soon because I’ve been getting negative readings so far.

I mentioned that I’d love a bagel this morning and he told me to let him know where to get one from. He wasn’t dressed and expressed no urgency, so I was browsing my phone, screenshotting cool places we had never been before that came up in the search. He asked if I knew what I wanted and I said that I didn’t, I was just saving restaurants that I’d like to try someday with him and that there’s no urgency for a bagel on my end and I asked if there was on his, like if he had somewhere he wanted to be because then I would focus on choosing a place. He says I’m being crappy with him.

Then, a considerable amount of time went by (like half an hour at least) and he’s in the bathroom. I’ve already decided I’m going to either DoorDash the bagel or pick it up myself. I’m trying to input my intermittent leave on my company’s website and he asked if I’m still being crappy with him. I said I’m honestly not thinking about him right now. He said let me know when you’d like to have a healthy relationship. I said “yea, I’m the problem”. And he leaves. He truly tries to make me feel crazy. Your girlfriend who isn’t feeling good asks if you can get her a bagel, you agree. This is the same girl who wakes you up with coffee in the morning, buys you snacks that you’ve never tried, but she thinks you’ll like, gives you hour long back rubs, pays the rent solely on her own while you live here rent-free. Your only “job” here is to be a good partner. I should be asking for more.

She doesn’t move fast enough but you’re sitting on the couch watching YouTube, not getting dressed or anything. Picking me up a bagel was not supposed to be a task or a stressful thing. He just needed to communicate that it’d be good to know where and what within 5 minutes, 10 minutes, whatever the time frame. Now, he’s at a kava bar where he will probably be on his laptop until about 6pm. If I am pregnant, I can’t have a “man” like this as the father. The drama. For nothing. The fingers pointed at me for causing the drama and how I’m the one who needs “fix” things. The countdown of how many days he’s been without sex if I don’t want him when he comes home, because honestly, who would with this kind of treatment. I am sad. I can find someone who will treat me better in a heartbeat. My parents hate him. They hate that I’ve been paying for everything the entirety of our relationship which is almost two years. He’s just now starting to have little bits of income come in, but this is ridiculous. He’s 47. I’m 34. I know I’m pretty, I know I’m smart, I know I’m kind, I know I’m funny. I am literally wasting all of that by being with him, but I don’t know how to get away because I live here. I’m on the lease, he isn’t, but he always finds a way back into my life because seeing anyone cry or suffer is something I can’t bear. I don’t think he’s my person. I am just afraid to let him go for his sake. I’m scared for me, too. I will be a little lost for a while, but I can’t imagine the rest of my life like this.",3,1752409937.0,abusiverelationships,1,0.81,False

The SGI opens up--and doesn't ""control""--speech, thought, and action!","I am *VERY* excited to keep studying the first section of the July installment of Daisaku Ikeda’s lecture on “The Opening of the Eyes.” It is entitled [‘The Opening of the Eyes’ Is a Paean of Victory](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/the-three-powerful-enemies-part-1-the-anatomyof-persecution-arising-from-fundamental-darkness/). 

Let me start with a bit from *MY Fantasy Life* (thank you, Eigenstien, for the term). 

*What happens when you stuff a bunch of [hockey moms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soccer_mom?wprov=sfla1) into a 40 ft RV? You get [Chicks with Sticks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicks_with_Sticks?wprov=sfla1).*

*All of our hockey mom friends came yesterday right at 10am. We sat around the big picnic table and drank coffee. Dee talked about how she leaches acorns and we all loved her fresh baked acorn muffins. Then we started our choreographed act. First, Lolita/Heidi/Michael/Anita came and picked up the TOTI (Terror On The Ice) kids for swimming and fun. Then out of the RV stepped Guy and Eulogio, playing their Modern Family “Mitchell and Cameron Act” off on their typical Saturday run to Costco together with the Twinmen and Benjamin Kdaké.*

*We talked and bantered about this-and-that until we finished the snacks. I gulped, took a deep breath, looked for strength in Dee’s eyes, and asked what they would like to tour first: the RV Park, the Dewey House, the proposed track/pool/gym site, or our RV suite.*

*”Stop stalling,” one of our friends chided, “you know exactly what we want to see first!” she insisted. “It’s Show-and-Tell Time! Julie, you’ve told us already about your HS. We know that the four of you are bisexual and polyamorous. We know your mantra, ‘An O a Day Keeps the Doctor Away!’ But how do you manage that? We just can't figure out how this all works.”*

*We split into two groups and Dee and I escorted our friends through the “Spa” and “Dining” trailers. Of course, although Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD) is not my diagnosis-of-concern anymore, I remain a compulsive neat freak and the trailers are spotless with zero clutter. After a few questions, we moved on to what they really wanted to see, the “Living RV.” We showed them our beloved sofa, coffee counter, Buddhist altar, and TV projector. Next the kids room with its elevator platform bed that drops down from the ceiling and allows two-tiered sleeping. Five kids (plus Lori on weekday nights),--no problem at all! We showed them the convertible foam sofa beds which the kids love so much. Finally, the Big Reveal moment. We took them to the Mama’s and Papa’s room.* 

*They wanted to talk about intimacy--not just ours, but theirs, too. Everyone participated and I didn’t sense any prurience or gawking. I think there is a certain talk space that women can reach, one of absolute trust and openness. There were no barriers, politics, shame, shyness, or off-topics. Two or three hours just flew by and we became sisters.*

*It became time to collect the kids and that ended the tour for the day. They want to come back next week to finish it. We all headed out to the ice-skating rink and there was something absolutely different in the air.*

*Dee and I talked about the morning later at night. “It's the Spirit of the Longhouse!” she said. “People living in a small space, talking deeply, putting aside judgment, and finding the words to open up even the deepest matters of the heart. It is where and how true humanity emerges!”*

Let’s jump back to Daisaku Ikeda’s lecture. He next discusses Nichiren’s interpretation of the Tatsunokuchi Persecution:

>“[Nichiren] in the second month of the following year, snowbound, is writing this to send to his close disciples” (WND-1, 269). The Daishonin began composing “The Opening of the Eyes” immediately upon arriving at Tsukahara on Sado Island in early November 1271, and completed it in February 1272. The “close disciples” to whom he sent this treatise specifically refers to Shijo Kingo, who, with the spirit of not begrudging his life, had accompanied Nichiren during the Tatsunokuchi Persecution, but in a broader sense, it refers to all who had followed and fought alongside him up to that point. 

That’s the legacy in my lifeblood! We have only one week until our group discussion meeting. With all of this craziness surrounding the new field/gym/pool development project, again I don’t have much time to help prepare. Veera, John, and Jack are the group leaders now and they assure me that everything is fine, just focus on work. Let me turn “Shijo Kingo” into a verb. Guy and are just Shijo-kingoing along!

Dr. Ikeda continues:

>Next, the Daishonin says: “[The description of the evil age in the ‘Encouraging Devotion’ chapter seems] terrible, but [one who cares nothing about oneself for the sake of the Law has] nothing to be frightened about. Others reading it will be terrified” (WND-1, 269). The first sentence is a statement of encouragement that although what is described may appear frightening, there is in fact nothing to fear. 

>Accordingly, “there is nothing to be frightened about” (WND-1, 269) expresses the heart of the Daishonin (the lion king) and his disciples (the lion king’s cubs) who fight alongside him with the same selfless spirit. 

Frankly speaking, I spent a lot of time the past few days fearing about the meeting with the hockey moms. I think I have made a lot of progress in accepting my HS and my resulting promiscuity. Still, I am not out of the zone of fear. What was amazing about the hockey mom conversation yesterday is that *all* of us took small courageous “nothing to be frightened about” steps to learn from each other. 

Conquering fear is not a one-time on/off switch. It’s a continuing battle to find and bring out something much bigger and brighter than it.

Is dating supposed to be this miserable, soul-sucking, financially draining and mentally exhausting?

**I'm geniuenly asking.**

**Girl 1:** We match, have a fun date by the lake. She wants steak.. barely touches her food, gets anxious and wants to leave. Despite that she says she had a great time and even suggests a second date... specific time and all. Then... silence. Eventually I find out she struggles with anxiety and panic attacks. It goes nowhere.

**Girl 2:** Another match, another nice oceanview date with good food. She’s touchy, we click humor-wise, there's a kiss at the end and she brings up a second date herself.Even suggests when. We text a bit, she thanks me for the ""nice time""... then radio silence. Four weeks later I ask what happened.. because I DO NOT GET IT. Suddenly she ""has no time."" (Amazing how women in my country have *zero* free time despite the 40-hour workweek being the law.)

**Girl 3:** We match. It takes her two and a half weeks to be ""free"" because of some mysterious work tests. The date goes well but she’s not into kissing or getting close... ""sri lanken upbringing"".. she says, Even though she’s been living in the West for 11 years. She messages afterward saying she had a great time. Then suddenly she’s “not sure”.. because apparently the fact that I *dared* to ask about intimacy and constent before month three is weird and inappropriate. 

**Girl 4:** We match. I invite her for a walk and dinner. This woman is a nurse but has the conversational skills of a snail. I’m not claiming to be particularly extroverted but when the restaurant staff started feeling sorry for me and even *consoled* me when I came out of the bathroom .. it officially became one of the most depressing dating experiences I’ve had so far.

And that’s just four examples... out of a never-ending stream of ghostings and last-minute excuses like “my throat hurts” less than 10 hours before the date, or “I don’t have time” / “I have to clean my apartment” just 2 hours beforehand.  
Let’s not forget the ones who match, text endlessly, but never actually want to meet or leave the app OR those who don't ""date"" if it's just a walk, coffee, picnic or drinks.

**Is this what dating is like in 2025???**  
An endless parade of indecisiveness, anxiety, mixed signals and overpriced meals that lead absolutely nowhere?

Meanwhile, my female friends text any guy on Tinder, Hinge or Bumble and he's free the following evening to WHATEVER they want to do.

Picture yourself sipping karak chai or traditional Arabic coffee on a terrace surrounded by greenery, with views of the Adriatic coast.

Last night I dreamed that my cat (his name is Mochi, for context) was my landlord. He wore a tiny suit, had a clipboard, and kept inspecting my apartment for violations.

I was frantically running around, hiding snacks under the couch, and trying to explain why there were so many empty coffee mugs in my room. He kept shaking his head, writing notes, and saying, ""This will affect your security deposit.""

At some point, he found my favorite hoodie and started charging me extra for fur rent. Then he stood on two legs and meowed loudly, which somehow summoned a bunch of other cats to do a final walk-through.

When I woke up, Mochi was sitting on my chest, staring at me like he knew what I had dreamed.

Now I can’t stop thinking he’s silently judging me for not cleaning the litter box yesterday.

If anyone wants to take a crack at what my subconscious is trying to tell me (besides that I should vacuum more), I’m all ears. Or maybe this is just the price of binge-watching weird animal TikToks before bed.

## Key Features Analysis

The ideal copper tea kettle should be both aesthetically pleasing and functionally superior. The models reviewed here incorporate a range of features designed to enhance the tea brewing experience.

**Material and Construction:**

The quality of the copper used in a tea kettle is paramount. Premium kettles are typically constructed from heavy-gauge, pure copper, ensuring even heat distribution and long-lasting durability. Look for kettles with a seamless construction or expertly welded joints to prevent leaks and maintain structural integrity. The interior is often lined with tin or stainless steel to prevent copper from leaching into the water.

**Handle Design and Ergonomics:**

A well-designed handle is crucial for safe and agreeable pouring. Ergonomic handles made from heat-resistant materials like wood, silicone, or stainless steel are preferred. The handle should provide a secure grip and be angled away from the body of the kettle to prevent burns from rising steam. Some high-end models feature handles that stay cool to the touch, eliminating the need for oven mitts.

**Spout Design and Pouring Performance:**

The spout's design considerably affects the kettle's pouring performance.A gooseneck spout provides precise control over the water flow, making it ideal for pour-over coffee and delicate teas. Wider spouts are suitable for quicker, more general pours. The spout should also be designed to prevent drips and spills, ensuring a clean and mess-free experience.

**Heating Efficiency and Water Capacity:**

Copper is an excellent conductor of heat, allowing thes kettles to heat water quickly and efficiently. The water capacity can vary significantly, ranging from smaller personal kettles to larger models suitable for families or gatherings. Choose a capacity that aligns with your typical usage patterns. Look for kettles with encapsulated bottoms featuring a layer of aluminum or stainless steel for even faster heating on various stovetops.

**Lid and Whistle Mechanism:**

A secure lid is essential for preventing spills and retaining heat. The lid should fit snugly and be easy to remove for filling and cleaning. Many copper tea kettles feature a traditional whistle mechanism that signals when the water has reached a boil. the whistle should be clear and audible, but not overly loud or piercing. Some modern kettles use electronic whistles or temperature sensors for more precise and convenient operation.

**Exterior Finish and Aesthetics:**

Copper tea kettles are treasured for their beauty and timeless appeal. The exterior finish can range from a polished, mirror-like sheen to a more rustic, hammered texture.Some kettles are treated with a clear coat to prevent tarnishing, while others develop a natural patina over time, adding to their character. Choose a finish that complements your kitchen decor and personal preferences.

## core Benefits

The advantages of using a copper tea kettle extend beyond its aesthetic appeal, offering practical benefits that enhance the tea brewing and serving experience.

**Superior Heat Conductivity:** Copper's remarkable heat conductivity allows water to reach boiling point significantly faster than with other materials like stainless steel or glass. This results in time savings and energy efficiency,making it a practical choice for busy individuals.

**Natural Antimicrobial Properties:** Copper possesses inherent antimicrobial properties that can help inhibit the growth of bacteria and other microorganisms in the water. While not a substitute for proper water purification, this provides an added layer of hygiene and peace of mind.

**Enhanced Flavor and Aroma:** Some tea connoisseurs believe that copper kettles can enhance the flavor and aroma of tea by gently mineralizing the water during the heating process. This subtle effect can contribute to a more nuanced and enjoyable tea drinking experience.

**Elegant and Timeless Design:** The classic beauty of copper tea kettles adds a touch of sophistication and charm to any kitchen. Their timeless design makes them a cherished heirloom that can be passed down thru generations.

**Uniform Heating:** Copper distributes heat evenly across the kettle's surface, preventing hot spots and ensuring that the water heats consistently. This is especially vital for tea brewing, as it helps to extract the optimal flavor from the tea leaves.

## FAQs Section

**Are copper tea kettles safe to use?**
Yes, copper tea kettles are generally safe to use, especially those lined with tin or stainless steel. The lining prevents copper from leaching into the water,which can be harmful in high concentrations. Ensure the kettle is regularly cleaned and descaled to maintain its integrity.

**How do I clean and maintain my copper tea kettle?**
To clean the exterior, use a soft cloth and a mild copper cleaner. Avoid abrasive cleaners or scouring pads, as they can scratch the surface. To remove mineral deposits inside the kettle, boil a solution of water and vinegar. Rinse thoroughly after cleaning.

**Can I use my copper tea kettle on an induction stovetop?**
Some copper tea kettles are compatible with induction stovetops, but not all. Check the manufacturer's specifications to ensure that the kettle has a ferromagnetic base that will work with induction technology. Kettles with a copper-clad stainless steel bottom would usually work well.**Will my copper tea kettle tarnish over time?**
yes, copper naturally tarnishes over time, developing a patina. This patina can be removed with a copper cleaner, or you can choose to let it develop for a more vintage look. Kettles treated with a clear coat will tarnish less quickly,but the coating may eventually wear off.

1lyrb9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1lyrb9c/aita_for_stealing_my_cousins_birthday/,AITA for stealing my cousins birthday???,"Hi this is my first post so it might not be well written😅. I wont be using any real names and this is quite a complex story so keep in mind that this is just kind of a summary to what happend.

Ok so little context, l(18f) just turned 18 on 2nd of july. I have two cousins that live near me Jen(20f) and jay(15 almost 16m). Also another cousin Chris(15m) who lives more than 2000 km away but we still see him atleast once a year and l keep in contact with him.

My cousin Jen has always been the attention seeker somewhat. She demands attention and often puts on a performance so people would like her. Her voice gets high and she starts acting all bubbly. I still love her as a cousin but l always had issues with her as we were never that close and she literly lives 2 minutes away from me. Every oprotunity l got l tried getting closer with her but it never really worked. In highschool l was excited as she invited me for coffee on my frist day but that was literly the only time we went out in those two years that we were toghether in the same school. I saw her maybe 3 times in the span of two years?

She hasnt been to any of my birthdays for 3 years until my 18th wich was for family and she hasnt invited me to her 19th or 20th.

Last year the day of her 19th she called me and my mom over to help and spent the whole time explaining to me how great it was going to be and who was comming over and l got excited thinking shes telling me all this becouse shes inviting me. (I knew most her friends and she was inviting a girl younger than me so l knew it wasnt about age). She spent the whole day calling her friends making sure they could come and telling me about her plans. Than when it was time for me and my mom to leave she told me ""well l wont see you tonight since youre not invited but we will see eachother soon"" l was shocked... and a bit heartbroken. My mom knew l was a bit disapointed she didnt invite me but l never told her what Jen said to me.

Fast forward this year since 18 is a big number we started planning my birthday in january and had our place(restaurant) booked in the middle of january already. It was booked for 5th of july(Jens birthday) we asked her multiple times if it was ok with her and she had no problem with it. It was the only date that would work becouse of family who was traveling like chrises family and a few more relatives.

I felt super guilty but Jen assured me it was fine multiple times especially since it was my 18th (she celebrated hers twice. One for family one for friends and l attended both).

Than in april my Grandfather passed away. It wasnt a suprise as he had some health issues but it still hurt. I felt most sorry for my dad as it was his dad who passed away. In my culture if a close family member dies,the first few months after their passing you dont listen to music especialy on celenbrations so if somebody invited you to a praty or celebration youd politely decline and explain you were mourning loss of family. I could still listen on headphones but it aplied more to my dad and the other children of my grandfather aka my aunt and uncle).

Becouse of this we had to cancel my birthday at the restaurant we had planned wich honestly hurt me but l stayed quiet becouse l understood. I never enjoyed celebrating my own birthday much and usualy only invited a few griends and cousins for bowling or to go out, but this was one l was genuenly excited for.

Thankfully my parents still decided, mostly becouse of the family, to throw my birthday at home like a casual dinner.(we had to do it two times and split it so on the 5th of july my moms family would come and on the 12th of july my dads).
Again Jen knew from the start as chrises family couldnt stay till the 12th and some other relatives wouldnt be able to attend but she was fine with it. If anything she was acting like my excited older sister and asking me what l was planning on wearing and so on.

I still felt guilty that the family me and her share would be coming to celebrate my birthday on her day so l decided to get her a nicer gift. Here family usualy just gives money and she still got money from my parents but she got stuff from me aswell. Genuine gifts l thaught she would like and l knew she wanted try. 

Than on july 2nd came my birthday. I was home alone most of the early morning as my mom went to work and my dad wasnt working that day but he went to go swim at the pool(his way of working out) and to buy us breakfast wich l was fine with. When my mom came from work we all went to a casual but nice place for lunch and we had a nice time. I was expecting jen and her family to come later in the evening as well as chrises as they would be coming to our town that day.

To sum it up nobody came that night.

 Chris as his family arrived really late so l understood but l found out jen spoke with my parents and wanted to suprise me but never came. The whole day she texted with them about how she wanted to come and than kept postponing and in the end never came(l know she wasnt busy as my dad met her by the pool with her mom and the whole day she posted photos on her insta on just chilling alone at home).

The 5th came and around 40 people were at my house. I have a big family and this was the closest family on my moms side only but it was still a lot of people. I got dressed up and chatted with everyone the whole evening while my parents were in charge of food and drinks. I had a blast. I usually never was center of attention and didnt like being one as it made me feel awkward but this time l really had a nice time.

Jen, Jay and Chris were sitting at the same table as with me and a few more of my cousins. Jens boyfriend(of 8 months) was also there as l told her he was invited. I knew she wanged to introduce him to the rest of the family and l didnt mind. She was so happy he could come and he seemed like a nice guy aswell.

Later that evening a family friend(really close to me but not to jen) came over and congratulated jen her birthday. One of our cousins also congratulated her her birthday and apologized saying she didnt know it was today. To wich Jen replied ""well somebody always has to steal my day"" and "" well it is (me)'s day but its still more my day lm just that generous"". I was chatting with someone else at the time but still heard it and said nothing while Chris who overheard was in shock and you could see him staring at Jen wide eyed.

It wasnt new to him that Jen would say something like this as we talk about her behaviour somtimes. She is always absent and doesnt hang out or speak with us much unless she wants something from us or its a family event and shes puttting on a facade(Chrises family is a bit rich compared to us and they live in a country with way better salaries,economy ect..). Later that day when they were leaving late in the eveining l handed her her gift that l told her was from me and Chris(he didnt really want to spend money on her but realised he didnt have a gift. He acompanied me shopping so l was aware and he just threw in a couple of little stuff like a chapstick,moisturiser ect... l told him we would tell her we both got it for her and it wasnt a big deal to me to share my idea for the gift).

Chris stayed later as his mom and my mom are really close and when they travel like this they end up talking till late hours. Me and chris became the same and sometimes it pains me to say lm much closer to him ,my younger cousin who lives more than 2000 km away, than my cousin Jen who lives less than 2 minutes away. I probubly see him more often than l see jen.

I spent that night chatting with Chris who was honestly the person l could tell anything and everything to. He spent maybe an hour lecturing me as he did when we went shopping about how l should stop putting so much effort into Jen when she never put any effort in me.

I have no idea what to do anymore. Theres honestly so many situations l could talk about but this is already a long post and l tried making it as short as possible.

AITA for celebrating my birthday on her day? I still feel gultiy and l dont know how to act around her sometimes.
