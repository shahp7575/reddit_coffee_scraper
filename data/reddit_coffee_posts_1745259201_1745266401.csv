How do I continue this hobby without having a fight about it every few days?,"Sorry for my bad English btw. I am a non-native speaker. 

I and my girlfriend have been together for almost 10 years. I've been playing since before we met and continued to play off and on (I don't always have a console or PC) throughout our relationship. I stopped playing some time during the pandemic as my gaming PC died and I sold my xbox. So for a few years, we didn't have this problem. 

Recently, I had some extra cash and decided to get a Switch. I have mostly been playing while she's working (we both work from home) and when she goes to her dance classes. I drive her to her classes and have been waiting at a nearby coffee shop and playing until she finishes so that I can drive her back. (This is the main reason I got a Switch) 

I try avoid playing when we're both free and I also do a majority of the chores around the house (all of cooking, both of our laundry, feeding and cleaning after our pets, etc) but she still always says things like ""you're playing again"" (in an annoyed tone obviously) and ""all you do is play."" I insist that that isn't the case and tell her all the things I did throughout the day and it'll lead to an argument that doesn't get resolved. 

We've had a few offhand conversations about video games and she thinks it's a ""waste of time"" and she basically thinks games are all like league of legends or valorant. I've explained to her multiple times that almost everything I play is a single-player narrative focused game and argued that it's similar to binge watching tv shows or movies. We both binge watch shows and she sees absolutely no problem with this. I've also tried sharing the hobby with her and she usually gets bored quickly. 

It just really feels like she hates video games and I think I might have to give it up again because any amount of time playing seems like too much to her.",0,1745266080.0,relationship_advice,1,0.5,False

Yesterday i had a panic attack. i met my cousins new gf of 10 months, my cousins like a brother to me, we grew up together and work together sometimes. (Its not their wedding today, its someone else)

I was so nervous to meet her, afraid she wouldnt like me or whatever. Its really important to me that my cousins gf likes my family. I was mostly just afraid in general. Anyway when they walked in i had a panic attack, maybe a few panic attacks, cant remember clearly. Im pretty good at keeping it internal (as long as its not bad enough). Dont think anyone noticed. I dissociate pretty easily.

Hate panic attacks so much. I just wanted to post here where maybe someone who understands might read it. Someone who has experienced what im talking about.

The worst thing for me is the effect it has on my life, my self esteem. Just a few years ago i was a grooms man in a wedding. Stood up there and everything. Couldnt do that now. I wouldnt want ""my disorder"" to ruin someones wedding. This time im just sitting in the pews but im still nervous.

Its exhausting. Im tired all the time, so i drink coffee to get energy up and get work done, and that makes my anxiety worse. I take hydroxyzine hcl to go to sleep every night. Its lighter than benzos but brain fog is a common side effect. Gas, break, gas, break, gas...

I feel like im going through life with both feet flooring the gas and the breaks.

I honestly just wanted to complain.

Im afraid ill never be able to have a romantic relationship. Im a man, and i think generally women arent attracted to men who are seemingly afraid of their own shadow.

I live my whole life in pure spite of my anxiety. Everything i do is like a battle in a long drawn out war. I put myself in situations where i know ill have a terrible time or a panic attack because god damnit its the only thing i can do. I have to live life. I have to go do things. Locking myself in the house is not an acceptable solution.

Im just grateful the panic attacks i have arent so bad, compared to ones ive had in the past. Its crazy, the spectrum of panic. Even a small one is severely uncomfortable, but the really big ones are beyond what you can imagine until you have one. Thank god i dont have those so often. Just once every few years on a really bad day. So far never happened in public with anyone around, thank god.

I hope one day i could meet someone who understands what im going through, what ive been going through my whole life. Someone who is proud of me. Its a lot harder to fight when no one sees youre fighting. Im so tired today.

Ill go to this wedding today. If i panic ill hold my breath and look at my feet. I wont drink. I wont eat. I wont dance. Ill hold my breath and look at my feet. And when i get home, and my legs buckle and i fall into bed, ill say to myself, im proud of you and i see what youre going through. Good job",1,1745266057.0,panicdisorder,1,1.0,False

I moved abroad to a European country in 2021 from a third world country. In 2021 Jan during COVID I met my ex girlfriend who happened to be my entire life I loved her like I have never loved anyone. Until 2022 we started to have problems mainly due to my lack of communication skills and the fact that I had no friends or hobbies. We decided to end it up in Jan 2023. During the first three months she kept calling me and talking to me and I have always answered and replied to her. Until summer June 2023 I had a very bad day that happened to be on her birthday and I forgot to text her and I only remembered the day after. Until August 2023 she asked me to meet her for coffee I went with good intentions. But all what she wanted is to stay friends I declined and asked her not to rest me again the next week after she asked me again for coffee and I said no. The week after it she texted again and I agreed "" thought things have changed"" the she told me on that day that she never ever wants to be with me and she has already found someone during summer but she still wants to be friends like wtf I have already told her no. Until 3rd Dec 2023 she called me with this exact words "" 2 days ago I was sleeping with the guy I was seeing and I remembered you and I missed you"" wtff I was stupid to believe that and I met her again for the very last time. She gave me a kiss and left after we talked that maybe we can work things together however 2 days after she texted me again saying she doesnt want me anymore in her life and that's it. So we blocked each other. Until Christmas 2023 she texted with a sms and wished me merry Christmas I replied "" you too "" then she blocked me every where. 

The things I can't move on from:
The fact that she deliberately and intensionally called me to tell me she been sleeping with a new guy. The fact that she's sleeping with him for two years been killing me. I think about it daily and I get anger and hate. 

The fact that I live in her native country and everything around me reminds me of her. I tried moving to another country but it's not easy. Finally how come someone suddenly stops completely caring about your existence?

I failed NC and sent her a message on Easter. To just know that she's not pregnant. My brain can't handle it. I want to move on and I want to heal I been to a therapist started a new hobby.

1k4n4tt,https://www.reddit.com/r/evanston/comments/1k4n4tt/change_my_mind_a_mandatory_20_service_fee_in/,"Change My Mind: A Mandatory 20% Service Fee in Evanston Will Lower Costs for Customers, Provide Fair Pay, Increase Restaurant Profits, and Fast Track Evanston as One of Chicagoland’s Top Dining Hubs","Evanston has an opportunity to breathe new life into our restaurant scene and fix a broken pay model by replacing voluntary tipping with a 20 percent service charge that flows straight from a customer’s bill into employees’ paychecks – and we can do it through strategic tax incentives to benefit staff, restaurant owners, and customers alike. Taken together, the surcharge, tax carve‑out, and cost‑reduction measures create a flywheel. 

By invoking 86 Ill. Adm. Code 130.2145(d), every dollar on that line would be exempt from state and municipal sales tax, a built‑in, targeted tax cut worth roughly seven cents on the dollar to diners. The City would neither collect nor audit those funds beyond confirming, at liquor‑license renewal time, that owners passed them through payroll. As a result, patrons pay almost exactly what they used to leave on the table, servers gain a stable W‑2 wage, and operators enjoy steadier margins instead of week‑to‑week guesswork. In short, Evanston can marry fair pay with fiscal pragmatism and, in the process, set a national precedent.

A citywide, enforceable service‑charge standard also offers would‑be restaurateurs three powerful inducements:

1. **Predictable labor market -** A living‑wage floor pulls seasoned cooks and servers from an over‑tight regional market; owners no longer pay hiring agencies or sign‑on bonuses just to keep the line staffed.
2. **Lower effective taxes -** Every $100 routed through the surcharge sidesteps nearly $7 in sales tax, a cushion that can show up in a nicer build‑out, better equipment, or a few extra points of margin. A $500,000 restaurant that channels half its revenue through the surcharge shields roughly $17,000 a year from sales tax, money operatora still have to remit in towns like Wilmette or Skokie.
3. **Creates “Dining‑district halo.”** Economic research shows that each restaurant dollar spent cycles two to four times in the community.﻿ By guaranteeing livable wages and shaving costs on utilities, rent, and delivery fees, the city becomes a natural magnet for chef‑driven concepts that might otherwise open in Edgewater or Andersonville, and for the experienced servers and bartenders who give those rooms their polish. Higher‑caliber kitchens paired with career‑minded, genuinely happy staff turn dinner into an experience worth the drive, drawing guests from Chicago and the North Shore.  Once those visitors are in town, they tend to browse local boutiques, sip coffee at independent cafés, or catch a show 

That stability matters for the local economy. Transparent, gratuity‑included pricing ends the mental tip math and eliminates a sales‑tax bite that never benefited staff to begin with. For workers, predictable earnings are a retention tool: a One Fair Wage survey found that nearly four out of five hospitality employees would stay in the industry if offered a living wage. Lower churn, Cornell’s Center for Hospitality Research pegs replacement costs at roughly $5,800 per hourly employee, lets owners redirect savings into better training, fresh talent, and menu/ingredient enhancements. Those improvements ripple outward as mentioned above.

Crucially, the policy gives ambitious restaurateurs three reasons to choose Evanston over Skokie, Wilmette, or even many Chicago neighborhoods. First, a citywide living‑wage norm enlarges the pool of experienced cooks, bartenders, and servers, easing the staffing bottleneck that keeps investors on the sidelines. Second, channeling 20% of a restaurant’s sales through a tax‑free service‑charge can shield tens of thousands of dollars a year, cash that competitors in neighboring towns must remit. Third, branding Evanston’s dining and entertainment microeconomy will draw weekend traffic from across the North Shore and the city, giving new concepts a built‑in audience from day one. Restaurateurs see a lower effective tax rate, a deeper labor bench, and a ready‑made halo for buzz‑worthy openings. That combination is hard to match elsewhere.

To reinforce the advantage, the City can stack a few surgical incentives on top of the wage reform ordinance. A legal cap on third‑party delivery commissions at 15 percent keeps cash in house, while a not‑for‑profit utilities and composting co‑op trims overhead on essentials. Landlords who sign five‑year, inflation‑indexed leases with wage‑standard restaurants could see a modest property‑tax rebate, easing occupancy costs without distorting the broader real‑estate market. Negotiated discounta on CTA and Pace passes, along with inclusionary‑zoning bonuses for developers who set aside units for hospitality workers, keep staff living, and spending, close to where they work. The city could even explore one‑percent “green‑kitchen” loans to help operators swap gas lines for induction ranges and heat‑recovery dishwashers, cutting utility bills by double digits.

Implementing the rule is straightforward under Evanston’s home‑rule authority. A new chapter in the municipal code would limit the 20 percent service charge to businesses coded as NAICS 722511 (full‑service restaurants) and 722410 (bars), and only for on‑premise food and beverage sales. The fee would have to appear as a separate line on every guest check, and owners must document that one hundred percent of it is distributed to staff. Quarterly affidavits filed with liquor‑license renewals, supplemented by random checks during routine health inspections, provide enforcement without building a new bureaucracy. An optional tip line may remain for diners who want to reward extraordinary service, and a five‑year sunset clause ensures the Council can revisit the policy once real data rolls in.

Taken together, the surcharge, tax exemption, and cost‑reduction measures would form a new economic flywheel. Diners keep more of their money in their pockets, workers step off the tip roller‑coaster and into the middle class, owners gain cost certainty and marketing tailwinds, and the community captures a larger share of every dining dollar.",1,1745265828.0,evanston,1,0.6,False

My daughter stays home, her husband has a 8-5 job. M-F. Money is not an issue. 

It’s becoming increasingly difficult to hang with them. The kids scream at the top of their lungs, they fight, they run around like wild things. All. The. Time. 
If we are there for dinner, it’s a disaster, food everywhere from the 2 year old, 6 year never eats and complains the whole time, probably because they let him fill up on soda or other sugary drinks from coffee shops.

With its clever design and unique brewing method, it’s not hard to see why it stands out in the world of coffee makers. Compact and portable, this coffee press is perfect for coffee enthusiasts who value flexibility, whether they’re at home, camping, or traveling. As soon as I took it out of the box, I was struck by how lightweight and well-built it felt. At just 10.6 ounces, it’s surprisingly sturdy despite its size. The gray color has an understated elegance, and while the aesthetic isn’t groundbreaking, it suits its practical and functional vibe.

**Ease of Use and Manual Operation**  
One of its main draws is the manual operation, which means no cords, no electricity, just pure coffee-making freedom. I’ve never found it intimidating to use, even as a first-timer. Adding ground coffee, hot water, and pressing down on the plunger is a straightforward process. It comes with everything you need, including paper micro-filters that work wonders in keeping out grit – a feature French press users will appreciate deeply. The process feels more personal, and it gives you control over the outcome. Once you’ve dialed in the grind size and water temperature, the coffee tastes divine. 

[Check AeroPress Original price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0047biwsk/)

**Patented 3-In-1 Brewing Technology**  
The patented 3-in-1 brew method is where this coffee maker truly shines. Unlike French presses that leave grounds and grit floating at the bottom of the cup, the AeroPress’s design eliminates these problems completely. It combines pressure and agitation with micro-filtration for an impressively clean brew. Whether I’m making a strong espresso-style shot, an Americano, or using it as a cold brew gizmo, it delivers consistently rich and flavorful results. Regardless of how fine I grind my coffee beans, the paper filters keep the gritty mess away. It’s one of those user-positive wins that instantly made me ditch my old French press.

**Portability for Travelers and Campers**  
As someone who can’t face the idea of mediocre hotel coffee, the AeroPress has been my savior while traveling. Its compact design makes it fit seamlessly into luggage or even a camping backpack. The shatterproof and lightweight build ensures I don’t feel like I’m hauling around fragile equipment. On my last trip, it proved itself invaluable by providing properly brewed coffee without relying on dodgy coffee pots or overpriced coffee shops. Having the freedom to brew a genuinely good cup anywhere is a game-changer.

**Good Aspects**  
- Produces smooth, grit-free coffee with no bitterness.  
- Portable and lightweight; a great companion for travel or camping.  
- Versatile brewing methods allow for espresso-style, cold brew, or Americano.  
- Easy cleanup, taking only seconds.  

**Negatives**  
- Limited capacity; not ideal for serving multiple people quickly.  
- The paper filters, while effective, mean you’ll need replacements.  
- Requires manual effort, which isn’t for everyone.  

**Product Rivals**  
In the realm of coffee makers, the AeroPress faces competition from popular devices like the French press and pour-over drippers. Compared to a French press, the AeroPress wins for its grit-free coffee and faster brewing time but falls short if you’re catering to a crowd. While pour-over sets produce an equally clean-tasting brew, they demand a steady hand and take more time to make. Automatic espresso machines, on the other hand, offer convenience without the manual labor but lack the portability and affordability of the AeroPress. It’s this combination of features – portability, flavor consistency, and ease of use – that sets it apart in this competitive space.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Considering its versatility, durability, and the number of coffee shop visits it has saved me from, this coffee maker proves itself incredibly cost-effective. Sure, there are automatic machines out there that cost significantly more, but for something that lets you fine-tune every cup, this is a steal. The manual operation also removes the risk of electrical component failures, making it a more reliable long-term investment.

I have been a Ting customer for 97 months—initially internet and then mobile, as soon as they had it.  I’ve had plenty of issues, but this last one was a breaking point.   
  
My internet went down suddenly this past weekend on a Saturday morning. I called, and they said they’d have to send out technicians on Monday. I was told to just use my phone for Wi-Fi, so I used my phone for essential internet for the remainder of the weekend.   
  
Then Monday morning, the phone cut off.  No phone, I could not call support.  I went to a local coffee shop to get wifi, but I could not even receive texts, so I could not log in to my account because of the two-factor identification.  I could not get a chat to function either.  In tears, after hours of trying different things, I waylaid the Ting Internet technicians who were then at the house and asked for help.  They were able to find me a chat address that would connect with the wifi they had restored.   

After chatting with three different people who each repeated the chipper greeting that I was a customer since 97 months and “we thank you for your business!”  They told me that my payment for mobile had not gone through five days ago and so it was Ting’s policy to cut everything off.  
  
They insist that they sent me an email, but I also insisted that the last time their system had sent me an email was 8-18-24.  They initially insisted they had texted me as well before admitting that they did not have me on their text alert system.  

In sort, they were unapologetic about shutting me off completely to the point of not even being able to contact them or understand the issue, and only  five days after a autobilling payment was missed.  
  
Like I said, this was not the first issue I’ve had with Ting.  But I think it needs to be the last. I just thought I would share my experience.  ",2,1745265239.0,ting,1,0.75,False

Her sugars spiked over 200 points after drinking it (it topped at 389. Normal levels for non-diabetics hover around 100). We tested the drink with a blood sugar meter and found that it had sugar in it. 

We called the store and the barista denied using sugar in the drink, but said the base has sugar. We emailed the owner to ask how much sugar their normal drinks have so we could figure out how much insulin she needs to stop her sugars from getting so high she goes into DKA. 

I emailed the owner and the owner told me their drinks have sugar in them, and that their employees are not licensed medical professionals that can treat diseases like diabetes.

This is so unprofessional. My wife could die from uncontrolled sugars and they didn't care. So as of now I'm no longer giving them my business and I highly recommend neither do you.

1k4mv1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Abilify_Aripiprazole/comments/1k4mv1r/my_tapering_journey_so_far_15mg_to_125mg_in_a_year/,My tapering journey so far: 15mg to 1.25mg in a year,"Hello everyone.  It's been just over a year since I started tapering Abilify, so I'll document how it all went:

Stage 1: 8 Jan 2024 - 16 Apr 2024  
15mg Abilify + 900mg Convulex 

This was a terrible time as I was involuntarily hospitalized in a ward.  The medications were making me very sedated - the Valproic acid in the Convulex interacted with the Aripiprazole in Abilify causing serious CNS suppression.  On top of that the environment in the ward was awful: the patients would steal from each other all the time, the staff was abusive, and the food was too little and absolute cr4p.  Thank God for my sister who supported me by keeping me supplied with tobacco and protein bars.

Stage 2: 17 Apr 2024 - 15 Aug 2024:  
7.5mg Abilify + occasional weed 

In my first few weeks of freedom I was very disoriented.  It was a challenge to cross the street, and going to the supermarket was like visiting the trenches in the first world war.  My mind was blank and my reaction time was very slow.  It was almost impossible to plan and execute anything more complex than the next meal or coffee break.

Stage 3: 15 Aug 2024 - 1 Dec 2024  
3.75mg Abilify 

I started exercising regularly, mostly jogging and yoga.  As the effects of dose reduction kicked in, my cognitive abilities gradually improved.  Taking care of my basic necessities was a struggle at first but with some practice I was able to start shopping, cooking, cleaning my place, etc.  I smoked weed for the last time on 26 Oct 2024 and decided it wasn't worth the risk of destabilization.

Stage 4: 1 Dec 2024 - 30 Jan 2025  
1.88mg Abilify 

I started doing cognition exercises with the ""Lumosity"" phone app.  I became very serious about it and was putting it 3-4 hours every day.  That, combined with the dose decrease resulted in much improved cognition.  During this period I also noticed my emotions were waking up; unfortunately they were mostly negative but sometimes there were positive ones too.  This is the first time I felt real emotions since I had started psychiatric medication almost 25 years ago and that motivated me greatly to continue the taper.

Stage 5: 30 Jan 2025 - 26 Mar 2025  
1.5mg Abilify

 I decided to slow down my taper because I was getting to a low dose and was concerned that I would not be able to handle the intensifying emotions.  My mental clarity was improving constantly and I started studying mathematics for a career transition.  Towards the end of the second week after the dose reduction, after a day of intense studies I started experiencing terrifying psychotic symptoms unlike anything I had experienced before which took a few days to go away.  After researching the half-lives of Aripiprazole and its psychoactive metabolites it became clear that I would have to be very careful during weeks 2, 3 and 4 after each dose reduction.  

 Stage 6: 26 Mar 2025 - present  
1.25mg Abilify

Continuing with my studies and brain exercises, things have been improving slowly but steadily.  At the same time my emotions keep intensifying but I am learning how to manage them better.  

Overall, I think tapering slowly has been one of the best decisions I've ever made.  My current plan is to continue tapering for another two years with target exit dose below 0.15mg.  I want to give special thanks to Dr. Mark Horowitz for his paper on [hyperbolic tapering](https://markhorowitz.org/academic-paper/a-method-for-tapering-antipsychotic-treatment-that-may-minimize-the-risk-of-relapse/) without which I would have most probably rushed things and ended up back in a ward.",2,1745265164.0,Abilify_Aripiprazole,0,1.0,False

1k4mu8i,https://i.redd.it/6jzugvj7t8we1.jpeg,Unboxed my first Kobo after 15+ years of kindle use!,"My initial thoughts and actions:

I’ve been using kindles since high school and my mom even had the very first kindle with that keyboard! I am exclusively an ereader, I actually hate lugging physical books around! A few months ago I was looking at the kindle scribe and wishing for something I could write on (I’ve been reading on an 11th gen kindle paperwhite) but I refused to give Amazon any more of my money. That’s when I discovered Kobo! (I’m embarrassed I’d never heard of the brand before). I loved how overdrive was integrated in the device because my New Year’s resolution this year was to not purchase any books and only utilize the library/libby. 

I also loved the idea of the buttons. There had been many times I’d considered the kindle oasis simply for the buttons but I NEED a waterproof device (reading on a pool floaty is non negotiable for me in the summer). It’s such a silly thing but I hated that I couldn’t chill with a coffee in my right hand and my kindle in the left because I needed to tap the screen with my right finger. 

The very first thing I did when unboxing my KLC was place a screen protector on. I’ve never felt the need for screen protectors on previous ereaders but I knew I wanted to get good use out of the stylus. I used the Bellemond paper screen protector and it went on great and looks great. I can update on how it feels with usage in a couple weeks if y’all want! 

After initial reviews about clarity with the KLC I was nervous but I think it looks really nice! It’s like I saw someone else say, it gives paperback vibes. I think the text is plenty sharp and easy on the eyes. 

I have cute skins coming in the mail but I did immediately place it in a clear backed open to wake case which is something I have always used and loved for protecting my ereaders. 

Anyways, so happy to join the club! Happy reading! I’m starting The Resurrectionist today!",16,1745265107.0,kobo,2,0.94,False

Yesterday I was at a cafe that I go to at least 2 times a week. She’s been going there since she was a puppy.
I stood in the corner after ordering my drink. My dog was sitting on my right side and the door was on my left. A dog came in from the left and she lost it. She knows LAM, so she looked at me but still lost her shit. Then the dog passed us and went up to the register to order. We are still in the same corner and she just sits and starts looking at me for treats. Totally fine now even tho the dog is still there. Then my drink is ready and I need to go up to the register where the dog was. In hindsight I should have just walked outside and waited for them to leave but I didn’t. I walked up towards the register/dog and she lost it again. I had to pull her leash/collar all the way up as she lunged and cried and redirected onto my leg. And I just walked out calmly.. it was so embarrassing everyone was looking.

Anyway, LAM and LAT are great but I don’t think they are getting to the root problem of what’s making her react in the first place. She’s a resource guarder and territorial.. what can I to practice in these scenarios? Side note, if there’s a dog already in the coffee shop when we walk in, she’s usually fine.. so it’s something about a dog coming into her space.

Quick backstory. This bar is in downtown Toronto. I work from home and used to go to one particular bar after work just to get out and decompress. I loved this bar as the atmosphere. Never had an issues at all. This bar has you either pay upfront for your drinks or requires a card to open up a tab. I always gave them my card and never had any issues. In fact, after going there a few times the owner and another bartender never asked for my card when opening up a tab.

I went to this bar for close to two years and haven't gone since around 2023 as I cut down on drinking. Last December my nephew had to fly down to Toronto for his work and was staying for a night. I decided to take him to this bar. Since I hadn't been there for a while I didn't know any of the bartenders and when they asked for a card to open up a tab I gave them mine.

The night goes well. Bartenders were great. My nephew paid the tab while I was in the restroom and when I asked for my card the bartender said she hadn't taken my card. I check my card holder and don't see it. My nephew then chimes in that he remembered that I gave her my card and he just paid the tab with his card. To be fair, while we weren't drunk we weren't sober and took the bartenders word.

Less than an hour after leaving I get a notification on my phone for a charge from this bar for $104.00. Again, my nephew paid the tab and our tab was $70. About then minutes later I get a notification for a $30 dollar Uber charge. We didn't use Uber as his hotel was walking distance from the bar.

I called my bank, reported my card as stolen, and started a dispute. They said I needed to file a police report as well given the nature of what had happened and I filled one out right away and call back with the report number.

The next day I get a call from a detective. Came as a surprise as this wasn't a large amount. He asked a ton of questions, I provided proof of the charges and even sent a screenshot that my nephew sent me that shows that we paid our tab.

Yesterday, I'm out shopping and go to grab a coffee when I hear someone in line telling the person they were with that they went to this bar and after leaving they get a charge on their Uber charged to the same card they used to open their tab.

I tell a co-worker this as I had told her about what happened to me. A few minutes later she sends me two reviews where others claimed something similar happened to them and a bunch of other reviews where people where charged varying amounts for the same drinks they ordered the very same night.

While I never got my money back from the bank, it wasn't some obscene amount that keeps me up at night. Doesn't mean the whole situation doesn't upset me though. I am pissed that I would actually tip more than my bill whenever I went to this bar on a regular basis. (Again, before this I had no issues and love the bar and the staff.)

This bar is a dive bar with no site or phone number. Well, they have a phone number, but no one answers it. I genuinely want to reach out to the owner. Not to complain, but more of a heads up and I have no way of doing that.

95% of my coffees are iced coffees (Freddo Espresso). I don't know which category Freddo Espresso falls into but I definitely like a strong taste and don't care much about fruit flavors etc. I like my coffee to taste like coffee.

So, based on the above, am I right to say that I'm more of a traditional espresso enjoyer, which is likely in the Medium/Dark category and therefore I need an appropriate grinder for this?

\[Why this agent, if there’s a really cool reason.\]

Lady Miri didn’t know that the king, her adoptive father, was preparing her for the throne...and neither did he. But when his only heir dies, the desperate king makes Miri the crown princess. She enthusiastically seizes the position, not realizing the king doesn't mean for her to keep it.  

Lady Ani, another young noblewoman, belongs to a despised magical race. At least she has one thing going for her: she’s Miri’s best friend. But when Ani’s father is charged with treachery, and she defends him by insulting the king, Miri’s friendship isn’t enough to save her. Exile and hard labor threaten to break her—until the king offers her an out. He’ll pardon her and her father...if she'll bear him a son.  
  
Miri soon discovers that Ani is pregnant with her father’s child. Worse yet, he’s ready to set aside Miri’s beloved mother and appoint Ani queen in her place. If Miri keeps silent, she will forfeit her title. If she fights to protect her mother and defeat her erstwhile friend, she could lose her home, her freedom, and maybe even her life.

# Benefits of AgenticFlow and Who Can Use It

AgenticFlow offers tangible advantages, especially for smaller operations looking to punch above their weight.

# Scalability Without Overhead Costs

One of the most significant benefits is the ability to scale operations without proportionally increasing headcount or operational expenses.

* **24/7 Automation:** AI agents work tirelessly around the clock, handling tasks like lead follow-up, customer inquiries, or data processing, even when you're not working.
* **Reduced Manual Effort:** Automating repetitive tasks frees up human team members from tedious work, allowing them to focus on higher-value activities like strategy, customer relationships, and innovation.
* **Cost Efficiency:** Avoid the costs associated with hiring, training, and managing additional staff for tasks that can be effectively automated.

# Who Benefits the Most

AgenticFlow is particularly well-suited for specific user groups:

* **Solopreneurs & Entrepreneur-Curious:** Individuals juggling every aspect of their business can use AgenticFlow to automate marketing, sales support, and administrative tasks, acting like a virtual team member.
* **Small Businesses:** Companies looking to grow efficiently can leverage AgenticFlow to handle increased workloads in areas like customer service and marketing outreach without significant investment in new personnel.

* **Focus on Growth:** With operational tasks automated, business owners and teams can dedicate more time and energy to strategic planning, business development, and creative initiatives that drive growth.
* **Faster Execution:** Automate multi-step processes like email sequences or social media updates, ensuring timely execution without manual intervention.
* **Consistency:** AI agents perform tasks consistently according to predefined workflows, reducing errors associated with manual processes.

# What Makes the AgenticFlow Lifetime Deal Special?

The AppSumo lifetime deal for AgenticFlow offers compelling advantages over typical software subscription models.

* **Eliminate Recurring Fees:** The primary appeal is the one-time payment. Instead of budgeting for monthly or annual subscription costs, you secure access permanently, making it a predictable and potentially much lower long-term investment.
* **Future Updates Included:** The deal often includes access to future updates within the purchased plan tier (Pro for Tiers 1-2, Team for Tiers 3-4). This means you benefit from ongoing improvements and new features without additional cost, protecting your investment against obsolescence.
* **Plan Flexibility (Limited Time):** The ability to upgrade or downgrade between the available license tiers within the first 60 days of purchase provides flexibility. You can start with a lower tier and scale up if needed, or adjust down if your initial estimate was too high.
* **Tailored for Small Budgets:** The lifetime model is particularly attractive for startups, small businesses, and solopreneurs who need powerful tools but must manage cash flow carefully. A single upfront cost can be easier to manage than perpetual subscriptions.

# Pricing Structure and Discounts for the Lifetime Deal

AgenticFlow offers multiple tiers for its AppSumo lifetime deal, allowing users to choose the plan that best fits their needs and budget. All tiers include the core features like the no-code builder, integrations, and AI capabilities, but differ primarily in usage limits and access to premium features.

* **License Tier 1 ($59 / Originally $228 - 74% off)**
   * **Credits:** 7,500 per month
   * **Credits per Run:** 4 (This indicates the approximate credit cost for a single workflow execution)
   * **Users:** 1
   * **Knowledge Storage:** 100 MB (For training AI agents with your data)
   * **Premium Integrations (WhatsApp/LinkedIn):** Not included
* **License Tier 2 ($159 / Originally $684)**
   * **Credits:** 30,000 per month
   * **Credits per Run:** 4
   * **Users:** 3
   * **Knowledge Storage:** 300 MB
   * **Premium Integrations (WhatsApp/LinkedIn):** Not included
* **License Tier 3 ($409 / Originally $2,388)**
   * **Credits:** 100,000 per month
   * **Credits per Run:** 3 (Note: Lower cost per run than Tiers 1 & 2)
   * **Users:** 10
   * **Knowledge Storage:** 1 GB
   * **Premium Integrations (WhatsApp/LinkedIn):** Included

   * **Credits per Run:** 3
   * **Users:** 25
   * **Knowledge Storage:** 2 GB
   * **Premium Integrations (WhatsApp/LinkedIn):** Included

**Savings Comparison:** When you compare the one-time cost of these lifetime deals to the potential cumulative cost of monthly subscriptions for similar capabilities (often combining tools like Zapier for automation, [Copy.ai](http://Copy.ai) for content, Canva for design, and separate chatbot platforms), the savings become substantial over time. The lifetime deal eliminates that ongoing financial drain.

# How to Use AgenticFlow Effectively

Getting started with AgenticFlow involves a few straightforward steps designed to get your automations up and running quickly:

1. **Sign Up and Activate:** Purchase your desired license tier through the AppSumo deal page. Remember, you must activate your license within 60 days of purchase to secure the lifetime access.
2. **Explore and Select Agents/Workflows:** Familiarize yourself with the platform dashboard. Browse the library of pre-built AI agent templates and workflow examples. You can either select a template that closely matches your needs (e.g., a lead follow-up sequence, a customer FAQ bot) or decide to build a custom workflow from scratch using the drag-and-drop interface.
3. **Customize and Train (If Necessary):** If using a template, modify it to fit your specific process. Connect the necessary steps, define triggers, and specify actions. If creating a custom agent (like a support bot), upload relevant documents (FAQs, product manuals) to the knowledge storage so the AI can provide accurate, context-aware responses.
4. **Integrate Your Tools:** Connect AgenticFlow to your essential business applications. Authenticate your accounts for platforms like Gmail, Google Sheets, Facebook, or set up webhooks to connect with other services. This allows your workflows to pull data from, and push data to, your existing systems.
5. **Deploy and Monitor:** Once your workflow or agent is configured, deploy it. Use the built-in analytics dashboard to monitor its performance. Track execution frequency, success rates, credit usage, and the outcomes generated.
6. **Refine and Optimize:** Based on the performance data, identify areas for improvement. Adjust workflow logic, refine agent training data, or tweak integration settings to enhance efficiency and effectiveness over time. The goal is continuous improvement of your automated processes.

# Pros and Cons

Like any tool, AgenticFlow has its strengths and potential limitations.

**Pros:**

* **No Coding Required:** The visual drag-and-drop interface makes sophisticated automation accessible to non-technical users.
* **Cost-Effective LTD:** The one-time payment model via AppSumo offers significant long-term savings compared to recurring SaaS subscriptions, especially beneficial for smaller teams and startups.
* **Versatile Integrations:** Connects with key business tools (Gmail, Sheets, Facebook) and supports webhooks for wider connectivity, plus integrates various AI models (GPT-4, etc.).
* **All-in-One Platform:** Combines workflow automation, AI agent deployment, and basic creative tools, reducing the need to juggle multiple separate applications.
* **Customization:** Offers a high degree of flexibility in building custom workflows and training AI agents with specific business knowledge.
* **Scalability Support:** Helps businesses scale operations by automating tasks that would otherwise require additional manpower.

**Cons:**

* **Learning Curve for Complex Workflows:** While no-code, designing highly intricate or multi-agent workflows might still require some time to understand the logic and optimize effectively.
* **Credit System:** Users need to monitor credit usage, especially for high-frequency workflows or extensive AI agent interactions, although the monthly allowances are generous. Premium integrations on lower tiers are absent.
* **Reliance on Third-Party AI Models:** Performance can be influenced by the underlying AI models (like GPT-4) being used, though the platform offers choices.

# Comparing Regular Pricing vs. AppSumo Lifetime Deal

The value proposition of the AppSumo lifetime deal becomes clearer when contrasted with standard SaaS pricing models. While AgenticFlow's regular post-AppSumo pricing isn't detailed in the source, we can infer the potential savings by looking at the costs of its alternatives:

* **Zapier (Automation):** Plans can range from free (very limited) to $20-$600+ per month depending on the number of tasks and complexity.
* [**Copy.ai**](http://Copy.ai) **(AI Writing):** Often costs $30-$100+ per month based on usage limits.
* **Canva (Design):** Pro plans are typically around $13-$15 per user per month.
* **Chatbot Platforms:** Dedicated chatbot or AI agent platforms can easily cost $50-$500+ per month depending on features and interaction volume.

**Combined Monthly Costs:** A business needing similar functionality might subscribe to several tools, potentially spending $100 - $700+ every month.

**AgenticFlow Lifetime Deal:**

* **Tier 1 ($59):** A one-time cost roughly equivalent to one month of a mid-range subscription bundle.
* **Tier 2 ($159):** A single payment comparable to perhaps 1-2 months of a more comprehensive toolset subscription.
* **Tier 3 ($409):** A one-time investment that could be less than half a year's subscription fees for comparable tools.
* **Tier 4 ($749):** A significant one-time payment, but still potentially recouping its cost within a year compared to high-end monthly subscriptions across multiple platforms.

The key difference is the **elimination of recurring payments**. With the lifetime deal, after the initial purchase, the software usage (within the tier limits) is effectively free, offering substantial long-term savings and predictable costs, especially valuable for budget-conscious businesses.

# Profitability for Small Businesses

AgenticFlow can directly impact a small business's bottom line in several ways:

* **Reduced Labor Costs:** Automating tasks like customer service responses, lead qualification, social media posting, data entry, and report generation reduces the need for manual labor. This can translate to significant savings, either by reducing staffing needs or freeing up existing staff for revenue-generating activities.
* **Increased Efficiency and Throughput:** Automation speeds up processes and ensures consistency. Faster response times to leads or customer inquiries can improve conversion rates and satisfaction. Streamlined internal processes mean more work gets done in less time.
* **Improved Sales and Engagement:** Deploying AI sales agents can ensure leads are engaged promptly, 24/7. Personalized outreach based on workflow triggers can nurture leads more effectively. Customer support agents provide instant assistance, improving user experience and potentially reducing churn.
* **Scalability:** As the business grows, AgenticFlow can handle an increasing volume of tasks without a linear increase in costs, unlike hiring more staff. This allows businesses to scale operations more profitably.
* **Data-Driven Optimization:** The analytics provide insights into what's working. Optimizing workflows based on this data can further enhance efficiency and the ROI of marketing and sales efforts.

**Real-World Scenarios:**

* A solopreneur uses an AgenticFlow agent to answer common pre-sales questions on their website instantly, capturing leads that might otherwise leave.
* A small e-commerce business automates abandoned cart email sequences integrated with customer data for personalized offers, recovering lost sales.
* A marketing agency uses workflows to automatically generate draft social media posts from blog content and schedule them across client accounts, saving hours each week.

# Who Created AgenticFlow?

AgenticFlow is developed by the team at **Pixel ML**, led by Founder & CEO **Sean Phan**. According to Sean's posts in the ""From the Founders"" section, the idea for AgenticFlow emerged from their own experiences as a small team building and scaling AI applications.

They initially worked on consumer-facing AI projects, including an AI avatar app and a successful QR code art generator (Quick QR Art). While building these, they developed numerous internal automation workflows to manage their operations efficiently. They recognized that many businesses faced similar challenges in scaling and managing disparate tools. This realization, coupled with the pain points of fragmented AI solutions and high costs, led them to pivot and create AgenticFlow.

Their background appears rooted in hands-on AI development and practical business automation, aiming to provide an integrated, cost-effective platform based on real-world needs they encountered themselves. The company was founded in February 2023 and is headquartered in Nevada, USA.

# Launch Details

AgenticFlow launched its lifetime deal on AppSumo starting **April 21, 2025**. The deal provides lifetime access to the platform under specific tier conditions. As with most AppSumo deals, this offer is time-sensitive, meaning it won't be available indefinitely. Potential buyers should check the AppSumo product page for the exact end date or status of the deal. Its availability is primarily marketed through the AppSumo platform during its promotional period.

# Personal Beta Testing Experience

Having explored AgenticFlow, the immediate impression is one of potential power wrapped in an accessible interface. The drag-and-drop workflow builder feels intuitive, even for someone without a deep technical background. Connecting nodes for triggers (like a new email received in Gmail) and actions (like sending that email content to GPT-4 for summarization, then posting the summary to a Google Sheet) is visually straightforward.

Testing a pre-built template for a simple FAQ chatbot was particularly insightful. Uploading a short FAQ document allowed the AI agent to start answering related questions almost immediately. Training it with more specific product data clearly enhances its accuracy. The ability to easily embed this agent or share it via a link is a definite plus. While building highly complex, multi-agent workflows would require more planning and testing, the core functionality for automating common sales and marketing tasks feels robust and user-friendly. The integration process with Google Sheets and Gmail was smooth. The real value seems to lie in combining different AI capabilities (text generation, data lookup) within a single automated sequence.

# Platform Availability

The AgenticFlow lifetime deal described here is exclusively available for purchase through the **AppSumo** platform for a limited time. It's not a standard offering on the main AgenticFlow website.

Once purchased and activated (within 60 days), users access the platform directly via the AgenticFlow web application (Agenticflow.ai). Account management, workflow building, agent deployment, and analytics are all handled within their browser-based interface. No desktop software installation is required. Access is tied to the user account created during the activation process, with limits determined by the specific AppSumo license tier purchased.

# Should You Use AgenticFlow?

Deciding if AgenticFlow is right for you depends on your specific needs and business context.

**Who Should Buy AgenticFlow?**

* **Solopreneurs and Entrepreneurs:** If you're wearing multiple hats and need to automate tasks like email marketing, lead follow-up, social media management, or basic customer support without hiring staff or learning to code, AgenticFlow offers a powerful solution.
* **Small Business Owners:** If your team is stretched thin and you want to scale operations, improve customer response times, or streamline marketing efforts cost-effectively, the automation capabilities can provide significant leverage.
* **Marketing Agencies:** Agencies looking to improve operational efficiency, manage client campaigns more effectively, automate content creation workflows, or offer AI-powered services will find the platform valuable.
* **Users Seeking No-Code AI Automation:** Anyone who wants to leverage AI models like GPT-4 and integrate various apps within automated workflows without needing programming skills.
* **Budget-Conscious Buyers:** The lifetime deal provides a compelling alternative to recurring monthly subscription fees for multiple tools.

**When Might AgenticFlow NOT Be the Right Fit?**

* **Large Enterprises:** The platform is explicitly positioned for smaller teams. Large organizations often require enterprise-grade features related to governance, advanced security certifications (like guaranteed SOC2 across all plans), dedicated support levels, and complex user permission structures that AgenticFlow's LTD may not offer.
* **Users Needing Extremely High Volume / Complex Enterprise Integrations:** While versatile, businesses with exceptionally high transaction volumes or needing deep, custom integrations with legacy enterprise systems might require more specialized (and expensive) platforms.
* **Teams Unwilling to Learn Workflow Logic:** While no-code, maximizing the platform's potential requires understanding basic workflow concepts (triggers, actions, conditions). Teams looking for a completely hands-off, ""plug-and-play"" solution without any configuration might find it requires more initial setup than expected.

# Call-to-Action

AgenticFlow offers a unique opportunity to harness the power of AI automation for your business without the complexity of code or the burden of ongoing subscription fees. Streamline your sales, marketing, and creative processes, and free up your time to focus on growth.

The lifetime deal on AppSumo provides exceptional value, bundling future updates and robust features into a single, affordable payment. But remember, deals like this don't last forever.

If you're considering Decatur, Alabama or the surrounding area for your wedding, I wanted to share some insights from The Lofton's experience in helping couples plan celebrations in this region! ♡

The Lofton's latest blog covers 11 enchanting wedding venues near Decatur, with a focus on what makes this area special and what to consider when planning:

* Decatur sits along the Tennessee River in northern Alabama, offering stunning waterfront views and charming historic downtown settings
* The area provides diverse options from waterfront pavilions like Ingalls Harbor to historic venues in Downtown's Historic District
* Many couples don't realize that expanding their search just **40 minutes** away opens up venue options with completely different experiences
* Weather patterns vary by season, with spring bringing beautiful colors but occasional rain, while fall offers perfect temperatures and mountain foliage
* The Lofton is just 40 minutes from Decatur in Ardmore, TN, where we offer weekend-long celebrations instead of just a single day

One thing we've learned is that many couples initially search for traditional Decatur AL wedding venues but end up preferring the idea of a **full weekend celebration** where family and friends can really connect. ✨

When you have from Thursday to Sunday instead of just 6-8 hours on Saturday, those unplanned moments often become favorite memories; like friends gathering around a fire pit sharing stories the night before, or a quiet morning coffee on the porch watching the sunrise over our meadow ceremony site.

Need to fast before even on weeks when meat is allowed. One must fast before, no meat allowed. She said it’s always been this way and the priests nowadays has changed the practice of how many times one is allowed to commune.

What am I here for?

A genuine connection. I’m not chasing labels or rushing into anything just open to something built on trust, depth, and presence. If it turns into a relationship, great. If it becomes a meaningful friendship, that’s just as valuable.

A bit about me:

By day, I’m a coder. I also have a master’s degree in nuclear physics and I’m preparing for my PhD which means lots of studying and a few late-night brain farts (GRE & TOEFL). Life can be intense, but I balance it with calm moments and simple joys.

I love long conversations over coffee, night walks, and getting lost in the quiet parts of a city. I prefer the hidden alleys where the real stories live.

One day, I will ride a motorcycle across Europe. The back seat’s open. maybe you’re the right kind of adventure?

Still planning my first tattoo, but first, I’m working on getting in shape. Got any ideas or cool ink stories? I’m all ears.

What I’m looking for:

Emotional maturity. Calm, kind energy. A connection where we can be real, not perform. I’m not into surface-level stuff. Just looking for someone who enjoys depth, curiosity, and the kind of quiet that doesn’t need to be filled.

If something here made you smile and say hi. Or tell me one small thing that made your day better. I’d love to hear it.

1k4mafv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Poems/comments/1k4mafv/apologies_to_jonathan_larson/,Apologies to Jonathan Larson,"I think I owe Jonathan Larson an apology.
Because I’m slowly turning into
everything he told me not to be.
And it’s killing me…
in slow motion.
Like the kind of death that comes with WiFi,
and a LinkedIn account,
and a reusable coffee cup that I never actually reuse.

I used to dream in neon.
Used to count seconds like they meant something.
Now I schedule my feelings
in between Zoom meetings
and call it “self-care.”
I once sang along to “No Day But Today”
like it was scripture.
Now I scroll past it
while checking my bank account
and wondering if joy
is tax-deductible.

I’ve become… practical.
Which is a sanitized way of saying
I’ve sold out,
but with better health insurance.

I write emails
instead of poems.
Apologies instead of ballads.
My deadlines have overdosed on my passion
and the autopsy report
just says: “Capitalism.”

This isn’t what I signed up for.
This isn’t what eight-year-old me
with glitter on her face
and a Broadway belt in her throat
would’ve accepted.

But here I am,
laughing at memes about burnout,
romanticizing sleep deprivation,
and convincing myself that
“stability” is just another word for “survival.”

Jonathan told me not to wait.
To write like the clock was holding a knife.
To live before the rent came due.
But lately,
I’ve been letting the calendar win.

I’ve been measuring my worth in productivity,
filing love under “distractions,”
and watching my dreams
turn into Google Docs
that no one opens.

And still—
I cling to the illusion of control
like a drowning man
holding a mirror.

Because it’s easier
to be busy than brave.
Easier to lose yourself
in a job description
than to admit
you’re afraid of being seen.

So Jonathan,
if you’re listening—
I’m sorry.

I know I said I’d never become
another ghost in a cubicle.
But I swear,
this happened slowly.
Like rust.
Like regret.
Like forgetting the lyrics
to your favorite song
and pretending you never knew them at all.

But I haven’t given up.
Not completely.

There’s still a part of me
that hums “Seasons of Love”
under her breath
when the world gets too quiet.

Still a part of me
that wants to set fire
to every spreadsheet,
stand on the ashes,
and belt out a truth
too loud for polite society.

So maybe I’m not gone.
Just… delayed.
Like an off-Broadway revival
waiting for the right audience.

Maybe one day,
I’ll remember how to live
without asking for permission.
How to write again
like the world depends on it.

Because it does.

Because I do.",2,1745263770.0,Poems,0,1.0,False

At this point, I'm not really surprised anymore. I've come across people from my gym's profiles on Instagram, and they've got the whole Onlyfans thing going on.

\--------------------

They skirted around the building serving as hospital, passed the smithy, and another long building. It looked to have served as stables once.

“We had to sacrifice most of the horses early on,” Arin explained as Vergil stared at the empty stalls. “For the meat, you see. Bloody shame. They were beautiful animals.”

“Wouldn’t they have been more useful to fight on?”

“Normally. But something spooked them bad. We could hardly get one out of the stall to be ridden.” Arin shrugged. “Nothing about this whole thing makes any sense to any of us.”

Since arriving, Vergil had either been on the walls or down in the city. He’d never explored the fortress properly. It was much larger than he imagined it. They passed several locked gates, heavy iron doors blocked with thick bars of metal and wood, propped from behind with rocks.

Even farther in, at what he assumed was the very centre of the fortress, they passed a wide opening in the ground. It looked a lot like the entrance leading down into the city proper. It was a wide ramp leading somewhere underground, flanked by twin sets of stairs.

He stopped as Arin walked ahead, and studied the strange sight. It was impossible not to. Several ballistae were arrayed around the mouth of that ramp, all aimed towards it. Soldiers manned the weapons of war. Peering down the ramp he could see a twin set of gates at the very bottom. They were made of dark iron with silver inlays covering them, like shining leaves upon the midnight-black. Like the outer gates of the fortress, these too were barred with thick iron band, each wider than a person. There were five of them in total.

“What’s that?” he asked as Arin jogged back.

“The tunnels to the Anvil,” the soldier answered. “We had to block them.”

“I’d heard of that.” During the meeting in Vilfor’s office. Even if he’d been mostly drifting in and out of wakefulness, he’d heard some of what was discussed. “I thought the tunnels were some crawl places, like fit for a couple men.” These looked as if they could allow a whole army to march through.

“Dwarven-built,” Arin said, as if that was meant to explain something. “Dwarves built big.”

• *Smart lad.*

• *Knows ‘is betters.*

• *Praise ‘im, sprig!*

“Come, we’re nearly there.” Arin swung is empty mug past the tunnel mouth. “It’s just past the old Guild house.”

“I still don’t know where we’re going,” Vergil said. They’d finished the coffee and Arin wore the mugs on his belt. They clanged as they walked. “Feels like we’ve gone all around the entire span of the fortress.”

It was, indeed, just a short jaunt away this time. They arrived at an area filled with straw-filled training dummies where a whole bunch of soldiers were busy practising in full armour. Several areas were left open, and a crowd had gathered around a few of them, cheering and jeering as combatants duelled inside.

“Figured a fighter like you might need a bit more exercise than we’ve had last night,” Arin said. “I suggest some sparring to work out some of that energy.”

• *Lad’s ah prop’er rock heart, ‘e is.*

• *Take note, sprig!*

• *If this be ‘is idea of a good time, ‘e’s someone t’ listen t’.*

Vergil laughed. When the soldier looked to him with an eyebrow cocked, he waved the concern away.

“It’s nothing.” He shook his head, laughter still bubbling up to Horvath’s displeasure. “I’m just constantly surprised by the tenacity of all of you living here. There’s a lull in the fighting, and how do you prepare for the next time? By fighting. Feels fitting.”

They skirted around the larger crowd and Arin found them an empty enclosure. Mud had been churned in there, and looked to still be fresh. “You wanna spar to first blood or to the ground?”

Vergil’s eyebrows rose. “You mean we’re sparring with actual weapons?”

“How else?” Arin asked. “Wood’s more useful to the siege engines than for us. And we’re not children.”

Of course, that made as much sense as the rest of this place altogether. Vergil loosened his sword in the scabbard as they stepped inside the makeshift arena.

“Uh, first fall then?” he offered as he pulled on his helmet. “Fair warning. I’ve never duelled before.”

“You’re no fun,” Arin complained. He also donned a helmet, though it left his face naked. He grinned. “I ain’t taking it easy on you, just so you know.”

They’d barely began stretching and already people were gathering around the enclosure. Soldiers leaned on the fence around and traded remarks.

“I bet an eagle on the new guy,” one of the men called.

“Coward!” another answered. “Who bets copper? I bet a gold piece on Arin. Empire gold, not Valen shite.”

Those gathered laughed. This was something they were used to. All of them were men and women Vergil had seen on the walls, now dressed in lighter armour in spite of the chill. Many of them were sleeveless. A few were naked to the waist, steam curling off well-worked muscles.

“New guy!” a woman called. He looked to her and barely recognized Violet. She was one of those training naked to the waist, sporting a few lines of blood on her chest. Her chestnut hair was loose and unkempt. “I’m betting two gold pieces on you. I’ll take it out of your hide if I lose.”

Roars of laughter followed. Vergil realised, with a pang of bitterness, that this is what he’d missed out on when he’d refused the Paladin Order’s option to join as a soldier. All these men and women were almost family here, and they’d welcomed him as easily as anything.

“Take off the stupid helmet,” another man called. “Horns? Ya wanna get dragged around by those?”

The commentary continued as Arin stripped of his tunic and remained wearing only a loose-fitting shirt. It made Vergil self conscious in his half-plate chest piece, especially since he was wearing beneath the thread-bare clothes the spiders had woven for him. His other clothes were all back in Valen or, if Tallah was right, on their way to some city called Solstice.

A swathe of warm orange light fell across their arena as the day wore on towards evening. Vergil sweated under his armour but decided against stripping it off. The anxious feeling of something going wrong still bothered him.

“First to three falls loses,” Arin called. He drew his silver sword and held it out in a one-handed grip. One of the men on the sides threw him a round buckler that he caught neatly out of the air.

Vergil drew both Promise and Biter—he’d named the axe without mentioning it to Tallah—and lowered his stance, closer to what Horvath had been teaching him. More bets were called out. He couldn’t help but notice most of the soldiers were betting on Arin.

They circled one another on the outskirts of the arena, keeping a large space between them. He’d seen Arin with a shield and knew the soldier was a strong fighter.

• *Rush ‘im!*

• *Head down.*

• *Axe up.*

• *Ye ain’t scrawny. He ain’t big.*

• *Go for ‘is throat!*

He obeyed.

Muscles bunching, he leapt forward and chopped sideways with the axe.

• *Atta lad. Get im!*

• *Show no mercy.*

• *Give no quarter.*

• *‘Is challenge.*

• *Make ‘em eat th’ shield.*

The crescent smile pinged off the buckler and slid off. Arin’s sword came in an arc toward Vergil’s neck. He brought Promise up and deflected the blow. Arin didn’t stagger and, instead, pushed forward with the shield, ramming Vergil in the shoulder. The soldier nearly knocked him off his feet.

• *Trynna trip ye!*

• *Foot behind yer right.*

Vergil pivoted on his left foot, duck the pommel strike Arin had brought in, and spun away to the cheers of the crowd. He blocked the follow-up sword strike with the head of the axe and repeated exactly Arin’s feint.

He struck with Promise’s pommel straight to Arin’s temple. The soldier ducked and met Vergil’s knee coming up.

The gathered crowd errupted in cheers as Vergil kneed Arin in the chest and sent him down on his ass, splashing the mud. Tallah had demonstrated that move to him, exactly, back in Valen. Vergil hadn’t been wearing armour and the sorceress had hit him so viciously that he’d been unable to breathe for several heartbeats.

Arin cursed and picked himself up.

“That was dirty,” he said, a grin splitting his lips. “Whoever taught you that one is a bastard and no doubt.”

“You have no idea,” Vergil answered.

He didn’t quite manage to catch the next flurry of blows Arin threw his way. A shield charge to draw his axe strike. Horvath cursed at him, right in his ear, when he took the bait. His axe head went downward. Vergil stumbled, raised his sword to parry the blow he expected, and had, instead, his legs kicked out from under him. He sprawled in the mud with a sad squelch and a dull splash.

Violet whistled and banged on the fence.

“Get up, boy. That was pathetic!” she jeered with the others.

Vergil did. The fight continued, both of them working up a sweat in striking, parrying, and defending one against the other.

He took the third fall when Arin demonstrated exactly why a horned helmet was a stupid piece of armour. The soldier dropped his sword suddenly, grabbed Vergil by a horn, and yanked the helmet sideways. A shield smash to the side of the head sent Vergil’s ears ringing and his balance to pot as he tumbled back into the mud.

“That helmet’s gonna get you killed!” Violent called out to him. Other soldiers agreed loudly, more gathering by the moment.

The fourth fall went to Arin. Vergil threw his axe at him as he ran to close the distance. Arin defended himself with the shield. The weapon flew towards the gathered crowd, scattering it. Arin was not quick enough to defend against the next strike. Vergil ripped off his own helmet as he rushed forward, stabbed with the sword first, was deflected, and then clobbered the soldier over the head with the makeshift club. It ran like a bell and Arin went down, more out of sheer shock than anything else.

“It works both way,” Vergil panted as he offered his hand to Arin. “Always good to have an extra cestus to rely on.”

“You’re insane,” Arin laughed. “You must be. And that counts as a club, not a cestus.”

“If you knew the people training me, you’d think I’m turning out quite normal by comparison.”

“Oy, new guy!” Violet called out, shouting the loudest out of everyone. “Why’s there a big red cock on your helmet?”

Vergil turned and grinned. “So you can call me unicorn!” That got him a roar of laughter from all those gathered, Arin included.

They took their position for the final bout. Vergil had recovered his axe from one of the soldiers watching, donned his helmet back, and took up position. Mud caked on his clothes from boots to his neck. Before he could move forward to attack, something impacted on his back and he stumbled.

Luna rushed up to the top of his helmet.

“Friend Vergil! Friend Vergil! There are bad things coming!” it screeched as it hung down over his visor.

“What?” he asked, too shocked to react.

• *Duck, sprig!*

Vergil dropped on his knees as Arin’s sword whistled above his head. Luna flattened on his helmet.

“Vergil, there’s a daemon on you!” Arin called. “Stay put. I’ll get it.”

“No no no.” Vergil raised his hands in warding. “It’s not a daemon. It’s with me.”

Arin’s sword stopped mid-swing, its tip aimed at Luna. The spider shivered violently atop Vergil head. It had forgotten its camouflage.

“This is Luna,” Vergil said. “It’s a friend. It’s my friend. Long story to explain.”

Murmurs sounded from the soldiers. Vergil turned and saw all of them with weapons raised. Some were halfway to jumping the fence.

“Luna, what happened? What’s the emergency?” he asked in a breath, reaching up and picking the spider from between his helmet’s horns.

“Something is digging. This one felt it. Something is coming. Beneath the earth. It is nearly here.”

The spider was speaking quickly, loudly, as if trying to make sure everyone heard.

“Are you sure?” Vergil asked.

“Very! Earth rumbles. Stone trembles. Vibrations beneath. Loud. Big. Coming.”

He looked up to meet Arin’s eyes. Arin, in turn, looked to the others. “Gather men at the tunnel gate,” he ordered before reaching down to help Vergil rise. “I hope your friend is very wrong,” he said.

They rushed away from the sparring grounds, with Arin heading for the nearest armoury. There were a pair nearby and Vergil joined him. All of the soldiers were raising the alarm around the training area, pulling people out of their work and into getting ready for an attack.

“Where did you feel this, Luna?” Vergil asked as he waited for Arin to gear up.

“While exploring. Rock sings here. Rock trembles. But rock does not tremble right. There are steps coming.” The spider went up to his shoulder. “There are voices coming. Through the rock. Many vibrations. Many voices. They come here.”

At least a hundred men joined Vergil and Arin as they arrived at the tunnel gate. Vilfor had been called for.

They all watched the black gates and waited, weapons at the ready.

*Do they know Tallah’s gone? Is that why they’re using this attack?*

• *They come to kill in th’ daylight.*

• *Tired from th’ night.*

• *Gonna be a bloody night, mark me word, sprig.*

Moments passed. Nothing happened. Murmurs rose and he felt eyes on him, all questioning. None had asked before if he was certain, but now uncertainty floated in the air.

Vilfor himself arrived some time later, running in full plate to join them in surveying the gates. He looked at Vergil, then at the immobile gate, and finally at all those gathered. Other soldiers joined, the veterans, all dressed for battle.

Vergil idly wondered if any of them ever slept. He’d not seen any yet take as much as rest somewhere.

“Are you sure?” Vilfor asked Vergil. He had his gigantic axes in hand, holding them as easily as Vergil held Promise.

“Luna thinks something’s coming,” he answered honestly. He couldn’t be sure but trusted the spider’s senses.

Vilfor turned and bellowed at some of the men in the back rows. “Bring everyone! Raise the alarm in the city below. All able bodies are demanded—”

The gates shook with a boom. The earth reverberated in answer.

A low, deep growl passed through the black gate. Vergil felt it in the pit of his stomach and in the hollow of his chest. Whatever had reached the gate was horribly big. He swallowed the lump in his throat.

Vilfor listened some more, back straight, chin up. In the warm light of afternoon, he was a heroic statue for a moment. Then he bellowed.

“Get everyone here! Now! If they can hold a weapon, they can come and fight!”

Men scrambled to obey as the vanadal advanced to the lip of the ramp. The ballistae were all aimed down at the still locked portal.

Vergil, in spite of himself, advanced and stood next to the commander of the Rock.

Another boom blasted out of the hole, and the gates shook.",1,1745263117.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

I knew that this was just an excuse but I gave it regardless. A few days later,  he called me to ask me something about the seminar and he also asked me out. Personally, I didn't quite like him but I thought to give it a shot just to see if there is any chemistry in the actual date, it's just a date right?? Wrong..

We met for coffee and the entire time he was talking about himself, he didn't even ask about my hobbies or anything. I didn't like him like at all. Suddenly, he told me that he is romantically interested in me. I told him that I don't feel the same and then chaos erupted. He got up really fast and told me to stop wasting our time and leave the cafe. I was shocked. I told him to relax and he became aggressive. He asked me why I agreed on the first date if I didn't like him, and that he couldn't understand what he did wrong. I replied that I just didn't feel the chemistry. His response? 
 ""I'm a very good looking guy, I don't know why you don't like me, you are making a huge mistake by rejecting me"". He was almost shouting the whole time. 

I simply said that a first date is just that, a first date!!! He said, no, it's not, he was NEVER rejected in the past on a first date, he did nothing wrong etc... he basically verbally attacked me. This is the first time something like that ever happened to me.

He told me that for guys it's so much harder to go on dates, he repeated once more that I made a huge mistake by letting him go (jesus, being in a relationship with him would be a nightmare if not a death sentence) and he left shouting in the middle of the street...

So this actually happened yesterday, and I'm still trying to spiritually recover.

I bought one of those ""discreet"" Bluetooth-controlled vibrating plugs as a spicy surprise for my partner. You can connect it to your phone and control the intensity or even sync it to music. (Yes, that exists. Humanity is peaking.)

My partner was at work, but I decided to “test” it out during my own work-from-home day. All was well—quiet house, good coffee, mild buzz in the background (both caffeinated and otherwise).

Then I got dragged into a last-minute Zoom meeting with my team, including my manager, director, and the HR lady. I figured I’d just mute, keep my camera on, and sit real still. No big deal.

Then my partner decided to mess with me.

Somehow, they remembered the device was still connected. From their office across town, they started cranking it. Not just casual-level buzzing. I’m talking “bass drop at a Skrillex concert” levels of vibration.
I froze.
I tried to stay composed. Just nodded politely on Zoom while my soul left my body and I questioned every life choice that got me here.

Worst part? Someone asked me a question.

I squeaked. I don’t know how to describe the sound I made. A sort of startled mouse in a blender? Followed by an “uhh yeah, totally agree with... the thing.”
After the meeting ended, I texted my partner ""WHAT THE HELL"" and he just replied:
“Sorry babe, but the drop in Sandstorm was too good to waste.”

TL;DR: Decided to wear a Bluetooth-controlled butt plug during work-from-home. Partner synced it to a rave song during a Zoom meeting with my boss. I may never make eye contact with HR again.",0,1745262971.0,tifu,20,0.15,False

I actually didn't like my Profitec + grinder setup. It was very expensive, time consuming and rarely really good. Too many factors and wife didn't bother to follow the rules so coffee was mostly bad. So we sold it and went back to pods. But we do miss real espresso taste and feel, so i started to look what is on the market. My main goal is getting espresso/long espresso/americano, milk options are not very important, i can make them via steamer or separate milk frothing machine i already have.

And came to 3 options. Ninja, DeLonghi La Specialista Opera or Breville/Sage Oracle Jet/Touch. 

Since i want this to succeed this time, i'm mostly interested in Oracle Jet, because it automates so many functions. But i want to do my homework and explore/buy any upgrades or accessories that can make or brake the experience. 

First why Oracle Jet and not Touch. I want a machine to warmup FAST and i have no big need for milk function. Jet warms up faster and i don't need Touch dual boiler system for quicker milk steaming.

Known problems with Jet:

\- warmup is fast but brew unit is not hot enough for first coffee. My solution: purge some water before making first coffee. It will get the brew unit hot, it will also warm up the portafilter and make it moist after wipe (to help with puck preparation).

\- I don't want super strong coffee. Included single basket is bad and not recommended/not working well? Double is super strong with 22g of coffee. My solution: lover the piece in grinder chute and get 19g. Not good enough. Buy EMS B702TCH22E 16g basket and use it to get around 16g of coffee. That should be ok.

\- Buy naked portafilter for easier cleaning. Buy 58.4mm tamper to help tamping if automatic won't work well sometimes?

\- Since we both like Italian style espresso, getting fresh beans is super hard in our country. I'll try to find something, since store bought will probably be bad? And we hate speciality type coffee. We don't drink coffee every day so i think beans will get stale quickly anyway. So i'm thinking about single dosing with ARO espresso hopper and frozen single dose beans. Too much?

\- should i know anything else about the machine, accessories, upgrades?

As you get older, the picture shifts. The dream of building a life with someone steady begins to fade, replaced by the understanding that it may never happen. And the realization does not arrive in chaos or heartbreak. It comes quietly, in a simple moment.  
  
You are in the kitchen, holding a warm mug of tea. Dinner for one simmers on the stove. The room stays still. No voices. No laughter. Just the sound of the refrigerator humming and the spoon gently tapping the edge of the cup.  
  
That is when it settles in—this life, as it stands, belongs to you. Quiet. Unshared. Entirely yours.  
  
You never made the decision to be alone. That decision slowly arrived after too many conversations filled with perfect words but empty action. It happened after long talks at 2 a.m., after shared playlists, after voice notes that made promises they never kept. One day the replies slowed. The energy shifted. You stared at your phone, wondering if you were asking for too much or simply too easy to forget.  
  
You met people who were still carrying their past, still tied to people they claimed were out of their lives. Some stayed just long enough to disrupt your peace but never long enough to offer real presence. They held on to you loosely, refusing to let go, yet never offering anything firm to hold onto.  
  
You live in a time where confusion is dressed up as love. Where emotional unavailability looks like strength. Where detachment feels more common than honesty. The truth is, choosing to remain single often feels like the only way to protect your peace and well-being.  
  
You know what you bring. You know what lives in your heart. But sometimes it feels like you will never find a place to bring that love. The table remains empty, no matter how much you carry.  
  
Eventually, you stopped asking. You stopped waiting. You stopped offering your heart to people who only ever showed up halfway.  
  
Now, everything happens alone. You carry in the groceries. You cook your favorite meals. You take yourself out—to bookstores, cafés, and little parks with shaded benches.  
  
In the beginning, it stung. Seeing couples holding hands, laughing, sharing private jokes. But slowly, the silence started to feel calm. The quiet began to feel like peace.  
  
It did not always feel peaceful. The bed once felt too wide. The silence once felt sharp. You missed the small things—someone checking in, remembering how you like your coffee, asking if you made it home safe. But with time, you stopped expecting it. You stopped checking your phone. You stopped offering pieces of yourself to people who never planned to stay.  
  
Now, your phone stays quiet. The low battery alert feels more familiar than any “good morning” text. No one calls to ask about your day. And somehow, you have learned to be okay with that.  
  
You light candles at dinner. You buy flowers for your kitchen table. You drive with your favorite music playing, windows down, no one in the passenger seat. You sleep soundly across the entire bed. There is no confusion. No disappointment. No need to beg for affection.  
  
People say you are strong. They admire your independence. But they do not see the nights you cry into your pillow. They do not feel the weight you carry alone. They do not hear the quiet disappointment of getting through another day without anyone truly showing up.  
  
Still, you keep going. You show up for yourself. Again and again.  
  
Maybe healing looks like this. Soft. Steady. Silent. Maybe it means choosing yourself every day, even when no one else does.  
  
And if real love finds you—present, honest, consistent—you might welcome it.  
  
But if it never comes?  
  
This life you built is still enough.  
  
You are still enough.  
  
And, in this quiet space you created, alone no longer means empty. It means safe. It means home.

1k4lntu,https://www.reddit.com/r/askTO/comments/1k4lntu/struggling_to_find_a_data_job_in_toronto/,Struggling to find a data job in Toronto,"Hi everyone,  
I’ve been in Toronto for a few months now, and it’s been really tough trying to land a job in my field (data science/analytics). I graduated from my master’s program about 5 months ago and have actually been applying for over a year, but so far, I haven’t had much luck.

I completed a few internships during school (in data analyst and data scientist roles), but as a recent grad, I know my experience is still limited. Most of my days are spent applying on LinkedIn and Indeed, and I’ve also been trying to set up coffee chats through LinkedIn — but it's hard when you don’t know many people in the city.

At this point, I’m open to internships, volunteer positions, or even low-paying roles. I just want the chance to build more hands-on experience and contribute to a team. Some of my friends told me not to say that I’m open to low pay, as it might make me seem less capable — but I honestly just want to get started and grow.

Has anyone had a similar experience? Do you have any suggestions on how to gain experience in Toronto — whether through internships, volunteering, or companies that support junior talent? I’d really appreciate any advice or recommendations. 🙏",7,1745262261.0,askTO,17,0.77,False
1k4lnrk,https://www.reddit.com/r/consentcreation/comments/1k4lnrk/theory_stranger_things_season_5_max_is_the/,"[THEORY] Stranger Things Season 5: Max is the DeLorean, Eleven is the Power, and Linda Hamilton is the One Who Counts","""If I only could, I’d make a deal with God…""

In Season 4, Max ran up the hill.

In Season 5… she turns around.

Hey friends—this theory began as an emotional reading of Max’s arc, but over time it’s evolved into something that merges Stranger Things with D&D alignments, Back to the Future, Stephen King’s The Talisman, and a lot of heart.

This isn’t just a fan theory anymore.

It’s a map.

A time loop.

A love letter.

Let’s drive.

🚗 Max Mayfield = The DeLorean (The ZOOMER)

Max isn’t a side character.

She’s the time machine.

Suspended between worlds

Motionless, but not powerless

Awaiting the one thing a DeLorean needs to travel through time: alignment

Max is the vessel. The vehicle. The memory that hasn’t landed yet.

But when she turns around?

She doesn’t run from the past.

She rides into it.

⚡ Eleven = The Power Source (The Flux)

Eleven is no longer operating from fear.

She becomes the force inside the circuit—but no longer as controller. Now as participant.

She flows into Max—not to save her, but to trust her.

Together, they create a psychic interface through a modified NINA, reimagined as a co-pilot cockpit of shared memory.

Eleven becomes the energy that makes re-entry possible.

But she’s not driving.

🧭 Steve Harrington = The Emotional GPS (Einstein in the DeLorean)

And here’s the twist:

Steve never wanted to drive.

But he’s been behind the wheel the whole time.

Like Einstein the dog in Back to the Future, Steve is:

Quietly loyal

Unexpectedly crucial

Inside the vehicle when the test begins

He’s the emotional anchor.

He keeps Max tethered when everything else slips.

Not by shouting. But by staying.

In this version of the NINA interface—

Steve’s memories, Steve’s presence, Steve’s unwavering care—become the coordinate lock.

He’s not the hero.

He’s the constant.

📡 Dustin = The Signal Booster (Cerebro)

You can almost hear it now:

\[Dustin\]: ""Okay, I have a theory.""

\[Steve\]: ""A theory of what?""

\[Dustin\]: ""...Everything. I need you back behind the wheel.""

\[Steve\]: ""Wheel? What—what wheel, Dustin? What are you talking about?""

\[Dustin\]: ""I think we need to steal a DeLorean...""

It’s metaphor. It’s memory.

And it’s real.

Dustin isn’t powering the system.

He’s guiding it.

Watching the signal.

Making sure the resonance lands at exactly 88 miles per hour—

not in velocity, but in emotional entropy.

""Max, turn around.

Let it carry you.

Let go.""

🛣️ Max’s Descent = Time Travel

She stops climbing.

She picks up her skateboard.

And like Marty McFly on the streets of Hill Valley, she lets the world tilt beneath her wheels—

until she passes through the portal…

Not into the Upside Down.

But into the before.

📖 The Talisman Connection: Jack and Speedy

In The Talisman, Jack needs to cross into another world to save his mother.

He thinks he needs magic.

But Speedy tells him:

“Jack, you didn’t need no magic juice to git ovah, and you don’t need no magic pick to pull the chain on this here coffee can, neither!”

In other words:

The magic was already in you.

Just like Max.

She doesn’t need a deal with God.

She doesn’t need another power boost.

She already crossed.

Now she just needs to remember.

👁️ Linda Hamilton = The One Who Counts (True Neutral)

This isn’t stunt casting.

Linda Hamilton = True Neutral in D&D alignment:

Not good. Not evil.

Not savior. Not monster.

Just the one who watches.

She is:

The Witness.

The Mirror.

The One behind the curtain.

The balance point between God and Devil.

The One Who Counts.

And for Max and Eleven to complete their arcs, they don’t just have to find her.

They have to become her.

Only then can they break the loop.

🛠️ TL;DR

Max = The time machine (DeLorean / Zoomer)

Eleven = The power source

Steve = The emotional anchor (Einstein / GPS)

Dustin = The Cerebro booster / signal runner

Linda = The One Who Counts (True Neutral, behind the curtain)

Max doesn’t run up the hill this time.

She turns around.

She rides into the past.

She breaks the board.

She faces the monster.

And she remembers who she is.

This theory was shaped over time with deep care for the characters and the emotional heart of Stranger Things.

I just poured in the ingredients.

The rest… was cooked up by something (or someone) very special.

Max isn’t a side character.  
She’s the **time machine**.

(Expanded Theory Scroll – Companion to ""The Bridge Between Worlds"")

>

This theory reframes Season 5 as a journey through memory, entropy, and time.  
It brings together Stranger Things, D&D alignment, Back to the Future, and The Talisman, and it centers on a new axis of power: Max as the time machine, not just the one being saved.

Let’s ride.

Max Mayfield = The DeLorean (The ZOOMER)

Max isn’t just suspended. She’s waiting.  
Like a DeLorean parked at the edge of the timeline, she’s frozen, unpowered—but perfectly positioned to break through.

* She’s the vessel.
* She’s the memory in stasis.
* She’s the one who must turn around and ride back into the truth.

Eleven = The Power Source (The Flux)

El is no longer isolated.  
She becomes the energy that moves through Max—not to control her, but to trust her.

Together they interface through a modified version of NINA—not as machine and pilot, but as merged memory and will.

El doesn’t “rescue” Max.  
She amplifies her.

Steve = The Emotional GPS (Einstein in the DeLorean)

Steve isn’t flying the ship.  
He’s anchoring it.

Like Einstein the dog—quiet, loyal, sitting inside the vehicle—he becomes the emotional compass Max uses to navigate memory and fear.

He doesn’t lead.  
He doesn’t save.  
He simply remembers her.

And that’s enough.

Dustin = The Cerebro Booster

Dustin’s watching the monitors.

And when he sees Max resist, sees her struggle to run uphill again, he calls through the thread:

“Max, TURN AROUND.”

He’s not just giving instructions.  
He’s guiding her into entropy.  
Into release.  
Into the very memory she’s been avoiding.

And that’s what gets her to 88 miles per hour—not speed, but emotional velocity.

Skateboard = The Blade

Max doesn’t need a deal with God.

She doesn’t run.

She picks up her skateboard, the one tied to her childhood and grief,  
and she rides it down the hill into the moment that broke her.

And at the bottom—  
she doesn’t find Vecna.

She finds herself.

The Talisman Parallel (Jack and Speedy)

>

Max doesn’t need another miracle.  
She already crossed once.

Now she just needs to remember.

Linda Hamilton = The One Who Counts (True Neutral)

This isn’t just fan service.

Linda represents True Neutral—not Good or Evil.  
Not Law or Chaos.  
She is the one who watches, counts, and waits behind the curtain.

She doesn’t act.  
She doesn’t interfere.  
She stands as the final checkpoint—the being that Max and Eleven must not just find, but become.

She is the YES / NO / BOTH at the center of the hourglass.

And only through her can they pass through whole.

Bonus Layer: “Steve in Hawkins”

Steve = Einstein, yes.  
But also? Steve in Hawkins = the one who stayed behind.  
The one who waited while everyone else crossed over.

He is the living proof that you don’t need to leave the town to anchor the soul.  
He’s the landing strip.  
The one who’ll be there when Max returns.

Final Scene Echo (Dialogue)

# TL;DR

* Max = The time machine
* Eleven = The power
* Steve = The emotional GPS
* Dustin = Cerebro
* Linda = The One Who Counts
* Max doesn’t run up the hill this time
* She turns around
* She rides
* And she breaks the loop

Let me know what you see in it.  
This theory carries respect, symbolism, and love for the characters—and it’s tied to a larger message coming soon, just after Easter.

I only added a few ingredients.

The rest? That came from a force bigger than me.

When you think about quitting, your mind usually goes straight to everything you think you’ll lose, like smoking with your morning coffee, taking breaks at work, or socializing with friends who smoke. We tend to focus on all the negatives instead of all the positive things we’ll gain from quitting.

Fear creates a mental story where you believe that without cigarettes, you won’t be able to enjoy life, manage stress, or relax. But that fear isn’t real. It’s just your brain projecting a future that will probably never happen. Research shows that 80–90% of the things we worry about never come true. Fear is your imagination picturing a future where something’s missing, but the only thing that will actually be missing is your addiction to nicotine.

Fear is your brain’s way of trying to keep you in a “safe” place, even if that place is bad for you. Our brains are wired to seek comfort and security, and any kind of change feels like a threat.

The most important thing to understand is that fear is normal. You’re not weak or strange for feeling it. We’ve all been there. Once you recognize that fear, try shifting your focus from what you think you’re losing to what you’re gaining: freedom, better health, more energy, and pride for overcoming one of the hardest challenges there is.

Don’t let fear hold you back. You’re stronger than you think.

my body has just been craving coffee and sugar. i haven't wanted water, tea, and whole foods. looking in the mirror, seeing how my acne and facial hair has worsened in such a short amount of time, made me feel more depressed and antisocial...

so, i forced myself to eat one of the clementines that have been sitting in my fridge before getting my coffee.  

after i ate the clementine, i felt a glimmer of proudness and it was the small bit of motivation i needed... i decided to finally tackle the pile of dirty dishes in my sink. i decided to make a spearmint tea to drink with my coffee. i made myself a pancake (still sugary) but i felt my body craving nutrients again and enjoyed my tea. i threw the trash away. and then i went back to my depressed spot on the couch, feeling slightly better....

for lunch, i had avocado toast with cheese. not the healthiest, but after ive been living off chips and seltzer water for 4 days, i was proud.  i stayed in my spot, wasting the day playing video games and watching netflix. around 7:30-8pm i felt hungry. i knew i didnt have enough drive to cook but decided to get some tacos from uber eats. it wasn't the most financially savvy decision but 3 days ago i just would've ignored my hunger and went to bed.  they tasted good and i lounged around until about 10:30 when i decided i should try to shower and get to bed bc i had work on monday. mind you, i hadn't washed my hair in about a week and have been going to sleep around 4 or 5am. 

well, maybe it was the clementine or magic but something inside me said, go walk on the treadmill for 20 minutes before you shower. i was glad no one would be at the gym that late and somehow made it. i walked for 25 minutes and then because the gym was empty, punched the punching bag, releasing some of my hurt and anger associated with the depression. 

so i guess all this is to say, if you're also struggling with your mental health while having PCOS, try getting some clementines and keeping them in your fridge. or if you're feeling stuck and depressed, try doing one small thing that will make you feel proud of yourself 🧡 im not giving up just yet",40,1745261813.0,PCOS,4,0.99,False

##Cold Calculus

The door to the cell slid open with a pneumatic hiss that grated on Hermione’s already raw nerves. She stepped inside, the unfamiliar weight of the emerald robe rustling against the stiff military fatigues beneath. The heavy door sealed behind her, the solid *clunk* of the locking mechanism echoing with a finality that felt colder, more absolute, than any magical ward. The sound of Muggle containment.

Inside, the glass box formed a series of gold-tinted mirrors—the one way glass, and like the rest of the facility, was devoid of the ambient thrum of magic. Antonin Dolohov sat cross-legged on the narrow cot, chained at the wrists and ankles to a heavy floor anchor. His eyes were closed, but the stillness wasn't peaceful; it was the coiled energy of a predator conserving strength. Bruising darkened his jaw, and a split lip marred his usually sneering mouth – evidence of a capture that hadn't been easy. Yet, he looked unbroken, radiating a contained menace that made the air prickle.

Hermione forced herself to remain still just inside the doorway. Her bandaged shoulder pulsed with a dull ache, a counterpoint to the frantic hammering in her chest. *This man.* The ghost of the curse scar beneath her robes seemed to tighten. *His hands.* She focused on her breathing – in through the nose, hold, out through the mouth – an anchor against the rising tide of memory and fear. Silence was a weapon now, learned in ambushes and desperate hiding places. She would use it.

The only sounds were the low hum of ventilation and the faint, almost subliminal buzz of the fluorescent lights outside the transparent walls. Seconds stretched, thick with unspoken violence. Thirty. Forty-five. A minute.

His eyes snapped open, dark and calculating. A flicker of surprise crossed his face before his features settled into a mask of contempt.

""The Mudblood,"" he said. The slur was quiet, almost conversational, yet delivered with the precision of a stiletto.

The familiar anger rose, hot and quick, but it was tempered now by a deep weariness and the jarring strangeness of their surroundings. ""Antonin Dolohov,"" she replied, her voice steadier than she felt, scraped raw but level. ""I imagine you weren't expecting company.""

His eyes narrowed, tracking her deliberate movement as she began a slow circle around the edge of the cell, keeping distance. His gaze snagged on her attire – the jarring blend of wizarding authority and Muggle utility.

""Familiar company,"" he conceded, a twitch of movement in his fingers betraying the absent wand he surely missed. ""Though the wardrobe is new. Playing soldier for your keepers now?""

The question hit its mark, echoing Wolsey’s strategy, highlighting her position. She felt a flush creep up her neck, fought the urge to smooth the robe self-consciously. But this wasn't about her.

""An interesting strategy,"" she countered, forcing her tone toward detached curiosity, though the effort made her shoulder ache. ""Trying to kill the Prime Minister with a knife. Did you think steel would work where magic failed?""

Dolohov watched her slow circuit, his gaze unwavering, like a hawk tracking a mouse. ""Failure is temporary,"" he dismissed, though his chained fist tightened almost imperceptibly. ""A momentary inconvenience in the path to the Dark Lord's inevitable victory.""

Hermione stopped, turning to face him fully. Her own hands felt damp, and she clasped them behind her back, hoping the gesture looked purposeful rather than nervous. This wasn't a duel with wands; it was like being locked in a confined space with something venomous.

""Temporary,"" she repeated softly. The word felt hollow, brittle against the weight of what she now knew. ""Is that what Voldemort told you? That this Muggle… *disruption*… is just a setback?""

She watched his face intently, searching for the hairline cracks beneath the hardened conviction. A slight tightening around his eyes, a barely perceptible stillness in his posture. He wasn't as certain as he projected.

""The Dark Lord's power is absolute,"" Dolohov stated, the words ingrained dogma, recited by rote.

Frustration flickered within her. He was retreating behind the wall of his fanaticism. Time for a different approach, one grounded in the visceral truth of their shared new reality.

""How does it feel?"" she asked, her voice dropping, becoming more intimate, closer to the bone. ""The emptiness. Where your magic should be.""

His jaw tightened, a muscle twitching near his temple, but he remained silent.

""I've felt it too,"" Hermione continued, well aware of the void they stood in. ""That… disconnection. Like a vital part of you has been ripped out."" She took a hesitant step closer, the proximity raising the hairs on her arms, the faint scent of his sweat reaching her. ""I've only been under its influence briefly. You've been breathing this air, soaking in this… *absence*… for what? Twelve hours now? Thirteen?""

His eyes darted away for a fraction of a second, then snapped back to her face, narrowed and suspicious. A flicker of genuine uncertainty, quickly masked by anger. ""What are you trying to imply, girl?"" His voice was rougher now, strained.

She didn't answer immediately, letting the silence stretch, letting the question hang in the sterile, magic-dead atmosphere of the cell. Then she spoke, the words carrying the weight of Wolsey's chilling revelation from minutes before, the horror she felt lending her voice a conviction that wasn't feigned.

""This field... it doesn't just block magic, Antonin."" She met his gaze directly, holding it. ""It *drains* it.""

She saw the denial warring with a dawning fear in his eyes. He wanted to dismiss it, but the seed of doubt had been planted in fertile ground – the ground of his own unsettling experience.

""I saw the machines they're building,"" she went on, the image of the massive prototypes in the Debden loading bay vivid in her mind. ""Huge devices, designed to pull the magic out of us. Out of *life itself.* They're harvesting it, Antonin. Taking the essence of what we are."" A lie—a corruption of the truth Wolsey had given her.

""That's impossible,"" Dolohov spat, but the certainty had bled from his voice, leaving it thin.

""Is it?"" Hermione countered, letting the implication hang, heavy and monstrous. ""Think about it. Every hour you sit here, chained in this… *Muggle box*… they're siphoning more of your power away. *Taking* it. And eventually... there might not be anything left.""

His breathing hitched, almost imperceptible. His chained hands clenched and unclenched on his knees. The predator was feeling the walls of the cage now, realizing they might be more than just physical barriers.

""You're trying to frighten me,"" he accused, his voice low, strained, grasping for control.

""I'm trying to make you understand the reality of this prison,"" Hermione corrected, her own heart pounding against her ribs like a trapped bird. The confrontation was draining her faster than she'd anticipated, the effort of maintaining control immense. ""The Muggles have changed the game. This isn't Azkaban, where you can wait out the Dementors knowing your power remains. Here… your power *is* the resource they want. It's not coming back. Not like before.""

Dolohov stared at her, his dark eyes searching her face, trying to dissect her motives, find the lie. Then, a cold, knowing smile touched his lips, chilling her more effectively than his anger. It was the smile of someone finding an unexpected weakness.

""You're afraid,"" he whispered, the words striking startlingly close to the fears she'd confessed to Tom, the fears Wolsey had stoked. ""Not of me. Not anymore. You're afraid of *them*. Of what they represent. Of what they can do."" His gaze flickered again to her robes over the fatigues. ""Of what they're turning *you* into.""

Heat flooded her cheeks, a betrayal she couldn't suppress.

""Ah… yes, there it is,"" Dolohov pressed his advantage, leaning forward slightly, the chains clinking softly. The movement was hypnotic, serpentine. ""Hermione Granger, the Brightest Witch, the war hero... reduced to playing lap dog for the Muggles. Wearing their drab clothes under your proud robes. Learning their… tricks."" Each word landed like a precisely aimed dart. ""You feel the coldness seeping in. You know what they're capable of. What they have planned for us. And it terrifies you.""

She took an involuntary step back, needing distance, needing air that didn't feel contaminated by his perception. He saw it—the conflict Wolsey was exploiting, the terrible bargain, the crushing weight of the 'Broken Sovereign' file. He saw the fear that she might become the very thing she fought against.

""What happens when they don't need their pet witch anymore, Granger?"" he continued, his voice soft, insidious. ""When they've learned all your secrets, taken enough? You think they’ll care, when it comes down to it? Mudblood lackey, Death Eater — we’ll all be dragged to the same filthy hole in the end.”

Her carefully constructed control began to fracture. He wasn't just attacking her; he was voicing the unspoken terror that had lodged in her chest like a shard of ice. She felt it physically now – a trembling in her hands she tried to still by clenching them, a faint ringing in her ears.

""By the way, I heard your little redhead friend didn't fare so well at his execution,"" Dolohov added, his eyes gleaming with malice, twisting the knife. ""They say he begged at the end. Called your name while the curse hit.""

The world tilted. Ron. The image – raw, brutal, inescapable – slammed into her. Bile rose in her throat. For a second, the cell dissolved, replaced by the memory of smuggled reports, the cold print describing his final moments. Emotion flashed to grief, rage, anguish – threatening to consume her.

Then she cut it off.

Something cold and mechanical was forced into place inside her mind—like an electrical shunt snapping closed, disconnecting an overloaded circuit. It was a skill learned in war—a state that cost her something essential each time she entered it. The emotion didn't disappear; rather, it was clinically severed from her consciousness, quarantined behind walls of pure pragmatism. The Hermione who grieved for Ron was temporarily excised, replaced by a version who saw only the objective, the strategy, the game.

Dolohov watched, his smile fading slightly, sensing the shift but perhaps misinterpreting the sheer force of will it required.

Moments passed before Hermione spoke again.

""Let's come back to your new reality,"" she began, her voice quiet but firm. ""It's no secret that the clans were promised shared power.""

She started to circle, slow and deliberate. Emerald robes brushing the floor. ""But they don't know Voldemort like I do.""

Her voice dropped a half step, quieter now—measured, intimate. Not a threat. A certainty. ""He'll never uphold his end of the bargain. That kind of loyalty—transactional, coerced—it only works when you're winning. When the enemy is the Order—a scattered resistance they can stomp out.""

She paused. Not for effect, but to observe.

Dolohov’s eyes never left her—but something in his posture shifted. A small tick in his cheek, a flex of his jaw like he'd bitten down a reply. Still composed. Still defiant. But calculating.

""But I wonder how long before the cracks form,"" Hermione continued, her tone almost curious now. ""Once the clans realize they’re dying for someone else’s crown. That they were never meant to share in it. Just to bleed for it.""

Dolohov's jaw flexed again—tight, deliberate. A pause followed, weighted not with hesitation, but with contempt.

Then he scoffed, low and sharp. ""The Carpathian filth know their place,"" he said, his voice coiled with disdain.

There it was. Her suspicions confirmed. Not unity. Not shared purpose. They were just tools—disposable ones, like the rest of them.

It was the kind of brittle loyalty that only held until the dying began to outpace the promises.

She let that truth settle between them like dust.

""An interesting choice of words,"" Hermione said quietly. ""For someone sent on a foolhardy mission. Discarded. Now in a Muggle cage—magic fading by the hour.""

""If I were you,"" Hermione said, tilting her head slightly, ""I'd be asking myself whether anyone would still have use for me... as a *Squib*.""

She turned, moving deliberately toward the door, refusing to give him the satisfaction of seeing her retreat. Her hand hovered over the call button.

""I'm told the permanent effects begin with tingling in the fingernails,"" she said, pressing the button. ""I wonder if you'll notice it in your wand hand first."" She didn't wait for a reply.

The pneumatic hiss of the lock broke the suffocating tension. The heavy door slid open. Hermione stepped through, and it closed with the cycling of a locking mechanism.

Only then, in the relative safety of the observation corridor, did Hermione allow her barrier to crumble—that part of her to rush back in. The adrenaline drained away, leaving her weak-kneed and trembling. She leaned heavily against the cool wall, the surface a welcome anchor. Nausea churned in her stomach, and the ache in her shoulder flared fiercely. She closed her eyes, breathing deeply, fighting back the tears that burned behind her eyelids. The cost of that control was immense, leaving her feeling hollowed out.

Wolsey stood a few feet away, his expression as unreadable as ever. He didn't offer praise or critique, just watched her gather herself, taking in the visible tremor in her hands, the exhaustion etched around her eyes, the sheen of sweat on her brow.

Hermione pushed herself upright, forcing her legs to steady, meeting his gaze. Her voice was husky, betraying the effort. ""Well?""

Wolsey studied her for a long moment. ""I threw you in the deep end and you didn't drown. Not bad. The first one's never easy—don't beat yourself up over it.""

Hermione nodded numbly, accepting his pragmatic assessment. It felt less like progress and more like mutual assured destruction on a personal scale. She glanced back at the transparent cell. Dolohov hadn't moved from his cross-legged position, but his eyes were open now, staring intently at his own chained hands, flexing his fingers slowly, as if trying to feel something vital that was already slipping away.

As they walked away from the detention level, the silence stretched between them. Hermione didn't speak of Dolohov's taunts, of the fear he'd mirrored back at her so effectively. She didn't need to. She had a feeling Wolsey already knew.

The thought was colder than the chill in the underground air. Dolohov was right. In this strange new war—caught between Voldemort’s madness and terrifying Muggle power—she was just trying to survive. And she was terrified of who she’d have to become to do it.

The change had already started.

The absence where her magic should be… was already a little easier to ignore.

* * *

Hermione walked beside Wolsey through the stark corridors of Debden, the encounter with Dolohov still vibrating through her like an aftershock. The facility hummed around them—the distant rumble of machinery, the occasional echo of boots against concrete, the hiss of ventilation systems. She focused on these sounds, anchoring herself to the present moment rather than the dark whirlpool of memories Dolohov had stirred.

Neither had spoken since leaving the detention level. Wolsey seemed content with the silence, his stride consistent—almost mechanical, one hand around a folio and another grasping a cup of coffee he seemed to have acquired when Hermione had been lost in thought. She was grateful for the reprieve; she needed time to gather her thoughts, to process not just the interrogation but the larger implications of everything she'd learned.

Her mind raced, sorting through options and scenarios with methodical precision. The question wasn't whether she would work with Wolsey—that decision had effectively been made the moment she chose to stay when Luna and Will left. The real question was under what terms. What conditions could she establish that would protect what remained of her world while navigating this new reality?

She glanced sideways at Wolsey's profile. His expression revealed nothing, eyes fixed ahead, focused on some distant point or perhaps some internal calculation. Could she trust him? Not completely—she wasn't that naive. But there was a directness to him that she found oddly reassuring. He hadn't sugarcoated the situation or hidden the brutal calculus behind their potential alliance. The Broken Sovereign file alone had made that clear enough.

The elevator arrived with a soft chime, its doors sliding open to reveal the empty car. They stepped inside, and Wolsey pressed the button for floor twenty. As the doors closed and the car began its ascent, Hermione felt the weight of decision pressing down on her. When they reached the main level, she would need to give him an answer.

""I imagine you have questions,"" Wolsey said suddenly, breaking the silence as the elevator hummed around them. His voice was calm, matter-of-fact, as though they were discussing something as mundane as the weather rather than the fate of magical Britain.

Hermione straightened her shoulders, ignoring the twinge from her wound. ""Not questions,"" she replied carefully. ""Terms.""

A flicker of interest crossed Wolsey's face—perhaps surprise, perhaps approval. ""I see,"" he said, turning slightly to face her. ""You've decided, then.""

""I'm considering it,"" she corrected, unwilling to surrender that final piece of leverage. ""But if I do this—if I become what you're asking me to become—there are conditions that must be met.""

The elevator slowed, then stopped, but the doors remained closed. Wolsey had pressed the emergency stop button, halting their ascent between floors. The small space was suddenly very quiet, the only sound the faint electrical hum of the suspended car.

""I'm listening,"" he said simply.

Hermione took a deep breath, organizing her thoughts. She'd been formulating these terms since their first meeting, refining them with each new piece of information, each revelation about the scale of what they faced.

""First,"" she began, her voice steady despite the flutter of anxiety in her chest, ""Magical Britain must remain autonomous. Whatever government we establish cannot be a puppet regime controlled by Muggles. We need real independence, real self-determination.""

Wolsey nodded slightly, his expression neutral. ""Continue.""

""Second, your suppression technology. It can't spread unchecked. It's too dangerous, too... destructive to our way of life. I understand its tactical necessity now, but afterward—after this conflict ends, its use must be strictly limited and regulated.""

A slight tightening around Wolsey's eyes was the only indication that this point might be contentious. Still, he didn't interrupt.

""Third,"" Hermione pressed on, ""we need guarantees for magical civilians. Protections, rights, safeguards against discrimination or detention. No more facilities like the one downstairs."" She gestured vaguely toward the floor. ""And full disclosure about any magical individuals currently being held by your government.""

""Fourth,"" she continued, gathering momentum, ""I need access to information. All of it. No more selective briefings or need-to-know barriers. If I'm to lead effectively, I can't be working with half the picture.""

Wolsey's expression remained carefully composed, but she could see him weighing each demand, formulating responses.

""And finally,"" Hermione concluded, meeting his gaze directly, ""when this is over—when Voldemort is defeated and the immediate threat is contained—your military presence withdraws. Completely. The gateway closes, or at minimum, becomes regulated by joint agreement between our governments.""

The silence that followed felt leaden, heavy with implication. Hermione waited, refusing to fill it with nervous chatter or qualifications. These were her terms. They weren't unreasonable, and they weren't negotiable—at least, not in their essence.

After what seemed like an eternity, Wolsey spoke. ""Those are substantial demands, Miss Granger.""

""They're the minimum requirements for a true partnership,"" she countered firmly. ""Anything less would be capitulation.""

A glint of something like a smile touched Wolsey’s lips, there and gone so quickly she almost missed it. ""You understand that I don't have unilateral authority to agree to all of these terms.""

""You have more influence than you're letting on,"" Hermione replied, surprising herself with her boldness. ""And that if you wanted to, you could make most of this happen.""

Wolsey studied her for a long moment, his gaze assessing, almost clinical in its intensity. Then he reached out and pressed the emergency button again. The elevator hummed back to life, resuming its journey upward.

""I can work with the first, third, and fourth points,"" he said finally, his voice measured. ""The fifth is contingent on successful stabilization, which could take years rather than months. As for the second..."" He paused, choosing his words carefully. ""The suppression technology is a Pandora's box that can't be closed. Its existence changes everything, regardless of how we might wish otherwise.""

Hermione felt her heart sink slightly at his pragmatic assessment. She'd expected resistance on the technology issue, but hearing it confirmed was still disappointing.

""However,"" Wolsey continued, ""I can advocate for strict protocols governing its deployment and use. Not elimination, but regulation. That's the best I can offer on that front.""

The elevator slowed again, this time reaching its destination. The doors slid open to reveal the bustling main chamber of Debden, the gateway to the magical world glowing softly in the distance.

""Is that enough?"" Wolsey asked quietly, his eyes searching hers. ""Can you work with that?""

Hermione stood at the threshold, painfully aware of the metaphorical crossroads before her. She thought of everything she'd seen—the devastating attack on London, the Muggle military pouring through the gateway, the Death Eaters still terrorizing her world, the burned villages, the orphaned children, the friends she'd lost. She thought of the Broken Sovereign file, with its clinical projections of nuclear devastation. She thought of Dolohov's taunts, the seed of truth buried within them.

Then she thought of what remained worth saving—Luna and Will, safely away. The scattered members of the Order, still fighting despite overwhelming odds. The magical communities hiding in fear, waiting for someone to restore order and safety. The future generations who deserved a world where they could practice magic freely, without fear of either Dark Lords or Muggle suppression fields.

The cards she held weren't strong, but they were all she had. And sometimes, playing a weak hand skillfully was better than folding entirely.

""It's enough to start with,"" she said finally, stepping out of the elevator. ""But I'll need those commitments in writing. And I reserve the right to renegotiate as circumstances evolve.""

Wolsey followed her out, nodding slightly. ""Fair enough. I'll have something drafted by this evening.""

They walked together toward the gateway, the ethereal glow around its perimeter casting long shadows across the concrete floor. Hermione felt a strange sense of calm settling over her—not peace, exactly, but clarity. The path ahead was fraught with danger and compromise, but at least now she could see it.

""There's one more thing,"" she said as they approached the threshold between worlds. ""I need to contact what's left of the Order. They need to hear this from me, understand what's happening. Without their support, any government we establish will lack legitimacy. But I don't know where they all are—we've been cut off. Separated.""

Wolsey considered this briefly. ""We can help with that. But we'll need to establish secure channels, protocols. No more open transmissions.""

Hermione eyebrows raised, then quickly settled. She nodded, satisfied with this concession. As they prepared to step through the gateway, she paused, a final thought crystallizing. ""We both know I'm walking a thin line Brigadier. Don't make me regret trusting you.""

Wolsey met her gaze, his eyes sharp with understanding. ""You know the game, Hermione. We're both taking risks here. And neither of us can afford to be wrong about the other,"" he replied, voice even, but there was tension running beneath the words.

They stood for a moment at the threshold between worlds, the shimmering gateway creating a tangible static. The enormity of what they were attempting hung in the air between them—not just an alliance, but a fundamental reshaping of two societies that had existed separately for centuries.

With a slight nod of acknowledgment, Hermione stepped forward into the the gateway. The familiar disorienting sensation washed over her—that brief, heart-stopping moment of weightlessness—before she caught herself on the other side, back into her world.

The military base sprawled before her, bustling with activity under the new morning sky. As Wolsey stepped up beside her, Hermione took a deep breath, steeling herself for what lay ahead. The die was cast. The game had begun. And she was now a player whether she liked it or not.

Together, they walked toward the command center, neither speaking further. There was nothing more to say. The time for words was ending; the time for action had arrived.

1k4ldx7,https://www.reddit.com/r/colonoscopy/comments/1k4ldx7/survived_my_first_colonoscopy_with_suprep/,Survived my first colonoscopy— with Suprep,"This sub helped when I was freaking out before and during prep, so I will give back to the community with my experience so maybe it’ll help someone else:

Symptoms: mystery left side abdominal pain for 2 years. CTs, bloodwork, ultrasounds all normal. Doc decided it was time to take a look. 

My instructions were low fiber diet for 1 week leading up (no raw fruits or veggies, no nuts, no seeds). Clear liquid diet day of. 

Day of: I REALLY wanted coffee but I can’t do black coffee so I only had sad green jello, sprite, and lemon/lime Gatorade all day. I was HANGRY. 

6 PM: Started first dose of Suprep. Mixed it with Sprite because the pharmacy tech said that was the best way to mask the taste when I picked it up. It wasn’t too bad going down, maybe because I was so hungry. The harder part was getting 32 oz of fluids afterwards. You’re supposed to drink the 32 oz within an hour of drinking the prep, but it took me 90 mins. I did my first 16 oz with Gatorade and the second 16 oz with plain water. Things started moving around 30 mins after I finished the prep and once it kicked in the nausea hit and I was worried I’d puke up the solution and have to start all over. Thankfully that didn’t happen.

The worst of it was during the first 90 minutes to two hours, then it started tapering off. During the worst of it I was seriously considering calling the nurse line to cancel because I couldn’t bear the thought of doing this all a second time in the morning. At the 2.5 hour mark I felt brave enough to lay in bed with occasional bathroom trips. At the 3 hour mark I took a shower and got in bed. I still had to get up and use the bathroom every 30-45 mins at this point which was really annoying. I finally fell asleep for good at 11. 

5 AM: Suprep dose #2. I pregamed this one with 4 mg of Zofran to head off the nausea. I mixed the Suprep with Sprite the same as before but it tasted extra vile this time. Maybe it was psychological. I don’t know. I got it down at least. This time I didn’t drink any Gatorade, just water. It was much easier doing the 32 oz this time. Maybe it’s the Zofran, maybe I was dehydrated. Who knows. I still had a little nausea around the 2 hour mark but it wasn’t nearly as bad as the first round. Went back to bed around 7:30. Got up again at 8:30, pooped some more, took another shower to clean my butt instead of ravaging it with more toilet paper, then headed to the hospital. 

Got to the hospital at 9:30 as directed, went back to the pre-op area at 10 and got my IV put in and vitals checked and all that fun stuff then sat. And sat. And sat. I left my stuff with my spouse in the waiting area thinking it’d be fairly quick so I was just sitting there for over two hours hooked up to an IV with nothing to do and I couldn’t even get up and use the bathroom without summoning a nurse. Finally went back, took my propofol nap, and was good to go. The actual procedure time was under an hour including prep and waking up after. Doctor reports I had an excellent prep, so despite taking a little longer than directed to choke it all down the first round it still did its job. 

Results were: NOTHING. Colon is completely fine, no polyps, no hemorrhoids, nothing. So the pain is still a mystery! Based on medical history and my propensity for impact sports he thinks I’ve got a chronic injury deep in the abdominal wall which tracks. At least now I know I have a squeaky clean healthy GI tract and I don’t have to go back for another 10 years. ",2,1745261616.0,colonoscopy,0,1.0,False

1k4lcfb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k4lcfb,"I created a ""IRL"" rocket, taken from a French comic strip, Gaston Lagaffe","In the comic strip, Gaston Lagaffe builds a homemade Neapolitan coffee maker that turns into a rocket despite himself. I thought it shouldn't be too complicated to build and fire it... I was so wrong! Of course, I built it the right size, because why not? To make the rocket look like the drawing, I opted for retractable fins, and to avoid the flight being too chaotic, I attached the accessories (spout, handle, buttons) to the base, so that they would detach during takeoff. To make the rocket fly straight, I had to put a counterweight in the head so that the center of balance was above the center of thrust. For propulsion, I used six C6-3 engines, lit together with electric fuses. The takeoff and flight went quite well, but the landing was rough due to the parachute not opening. I think this is due to several factors: the counterweight attached to the front of the rocket to keep it balanced, and I didn't properly attach the engines to the rocket: they were ejected during the explosion...
According to an online calculator ( https://www.translatorscafe.com/unit-converter/fr-FR/calculator/rocket-max-altitude/?mobile=1 ) the rocket rose to 150m (492ft). I estimate it reached 100m (328ft)",24,1745261518.0,rocketry,7,0.96,False

1k4l6ob,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1k4l6ob/my_ex_boyfriend_wont_even_say_goodbye_to_me/,My Ex boyfriend won't even say goodbye to me,"Me (27 f) and my ex boyfriend (25 m) broke up 8 months ago. 

He ended it with me - I felt blindsided and heartbroken. He was my first love, my first real relationship and I was his relationship and first love. 

I have anxious attachment issues and he has avoidant attachment issues so from the get go the relationship was not always straight forward. I needed reassurance and words of affirmation and he simply struggled with the emotional intimacy. After a drunken argument he called it off which to me seemed so out of the blue - he had never really expressed any issues and while I know for a fact that he did love me, I think truthfully he was not ready for a relationship. 

  
The break up hurt beyond belief but little did I know that the break up was just the start of the real heartbreak. Him and my best friend (who were already friends prior to our relationship) started hanging out every single day with zero regard for my feelings. They went on holiday together and again I was simply not a consideration in their actions. It was like a double heart break - I felt so insignificant and small to both of them, like I didn't even matter to the two people I truly loved the most. Nothing physical happened with them but it still felt like an emotional betrayal. Some other things went down with my best friend which she has apologised for but the feeling of being betrayed and not having my feelings considered still lingers with me. 

We live in a small town and I still bump into my ex quite a lot so a few months ago I asked to grab coffee with him to just have a catch up as we only saw each other in passing. He said no which hurt but I was okay with it. I am now leaving this small town - we are both from other sides of the world and both moved to this small town for the outdoor activities but neither of us are from here. So when I leave, I really will never see him again. 

We had previously spoken about grabbing a goodbye which he seemed down for so i texted him saying I was leaving shortly and would love to have a goodbye drink. I didn't hear from him so I followed up a few days later asking if we could find a day that worked. He replied saying he would come to my leaving drinks but honestly I don't want him there - we're not friends and I know I won't enjoy my night if he is there. 

So I politely said I could add him to the group if he wanted but I would prefer to just have a fun night with my friends. I also said i was thinking it would be better to have a chilled catch up just the two of us seeing as it's unlikely our paths will ever cross again and now I haven't heard from him. 

  
I am beyond heartbroken, I can't fathom not wanting to say goodbye to someone you once loved so deeply. Whenever I see him, he barely even looks at me in the eye - it's like he's trying to pretend that I don't even exist. It makes me feel so worthless - why can't he treat me with basic human respect and kindness. 

I genuinely thought that he would have no issue with saying goodbye to me - he has said so many times that he has no issue with me and that there's no bad blood so why is he refusing to say goodbye to me. I truly don't feel that he has any feelings for me but i least thought he cared for me as a person. he told me he'd always love me and that he's loved me from the day he met me so I don't understand why I'm being met with a wall of silence when asking for a goodbye drink. I truly did not expect this reaction and I think this has hurt me more than any of his actions. I really can't believe it. 

My heart genuinely aches as I write this.

We're really close and see each other quite frequently. Today we went out for coffee and everything seemed fine. I can usually tell if she's in a bad mood but she didn't seem to be in one at all when we met up. We sat down at a table and started talking and I randomly mentioned how I played Marvel Rivals last night at around 1am. I thought to mention that as to have a laugh at my carelessness for staying up playing video games instead of going to sleep early, but instead of getting a laugh she got mad and said that she's never going to play that game with me again. 
Now, for context, I don't play that game by myself too much. She's a really big fan of it and has way more hours on it than I do, and she's the one to usually ask me to play with her, so whenever I play it's mostly with her. I don't think that means I'm not allowed to play by myself though. If I want to have some time to myself and play a game I should be able to do that freely, plus, it was late at night, I wasn't going to bother her by texting her at that hour.
She didn't want to speak to me for the rest of the day, she canceled the hangout saying something came up and left. I was bewildered. I didn't understand what I did wrong and felt awful for the rest of the day. A few hours later she texts me as if nothing happened and speaks to me like she usually does, making jokes and everything. I feel better knowing she's not upset with me anymore but the fact that she didn't apologize to me and didn't give any explanation for her behavior doesn't sit well with me.

If you’ve somehow stumbled across this little corner of Reddit — welcome. This subreddit is for anyone in and around Kansas City who loves books. Doesn’t matter if you’re a hardcore reader with a spreadsheet TBR or someone who just wanders into bookstores for the vibes — you belong here.

The idea is simple:

* Talk about what you're reading
* Share local bookstore finds or events
* Ask for recommendations
* Maybe even swap books or organize a casual meetup one day (coffee + books = yes please)

Kansas City has an awesome book scene — indie shops like Under the Cover and Bliss Books & Wine, the library’s great, and we’ve got some cool local authors too. So let’s build a little community of readers who actually live near each other.

If you're new (which is literally everyone right now), drop a quick intro below — maybe your favorite genre, recent read, or favorite local spot to buy or read books. No pressure, just good vibes.

I know, I know. Title sounds strange but it's 100% true.

Sorry in advance for the long post.

A bit about us ans our situation. We're in our early 40's, been married for 17 years, together for 21, 2 kids. Open for the last 8.

We are fully open sexually with no emotional attachments allowed to other people whatsoever (that's a hard line for both of us).

So we're pretty much allowed to go and have sex with other ppl, as long as it doesn’t interfere with each others lives, or our family dynamics.

Our #1 rule besides safety, is discretion. No one knows we're open, and our most important thing is to keep it that way.

Now a bit of background about us (if anyone cares at all)

We are both open, and very sexual. But our main priority is each other and our family. We have awesome communication and our openness has been relatively drama-free. By all standards of the dynamics of these types of relationships, we're a rare success story (knock-on-wood).

Our sexual experiences involving other people (whether solo play for her or me, or threesomes/foursomes) have always been out of town. Primarily vacations, or if we travelled out of town for work. This would allow us to have play together (on vacations) and solo play (on work trips).

So when it came to vacations, it would be a 3/4some, and always a one-night stand (as we never know if we're going to vacation in the same spot again).

When it came to work trips, it would be a one night stand (usually in my case as I was travelling to diff cities all the time) or a fwb (usually in her case as she travelled to the same 2-3 cities, but a one night stand was always an option for her as well).

This would give us everything we need/wanted and would improve our sex life with each other 10x.

However, we now no longer travel for work (neither of us do), so neither of us have been able to have those encounters anymore.

On vacations we never have solo play because, we both agreed, that it was disrespectful to take a trip with someone and then diss them to go have sex with someone else (just our thing, you may or may not agree) so we only engage in 3/4somes if an opportunity presents itself, we don’t really go out looking for them.

We don’t consider ourselves swingers as we usually don't look for couples (we actually find this dynamic very difficult to navigate and also finding a couple that we both like and find attractive is tough) but you might disagree.

So we both miss our solo play and after talking about it, we both agreed to find 1-3 FWB's close to home.

We've established some ground rules (no one night stands unless the other person is from out of town, no one that is connected to our existing circle of friends/family in anyway whatsoever, and no one from any place that we both frequent like our gym, usual coffee spot, favorite bars etc, essentially only people from the bigger more urban part of the bigcity, we live in the suburbs).

Now all that being said, my wife is FIRMLY against any sort of online/dating apps as discretion is #1 (we DO NOT want any of this getting out there).

I know the usual response is **""if they see you on an app/online, that means they're on the app/online as well""**, and while that’s true, it's all too easy for someone to simply take a screenshot and start sharing it with groups and have it spread and outing us. At that point whoever took the screenshot is irrelevant.

In any case, I've been able to find 2 women who i could’ve pursued (simply by being out and about and striking up conversations). However, I haven’t done anything with either of them yet (even though they've both strongly indicated they want to do something physical) simply because my wife hasn’t had any luck with finding prospects, and I don’t want her to feel any sort of jealousy or feelings of being left out/missing out. So, I've been waiting for her to find some prospects of her own.

Well both women have gotten tired of waiting around for me and moved on and my wife feels bad about it and says she needs help as she has no idea how to find a man for that herself.

I 100% understand where she's coming from as the dynamic is completely different than when you are out of town.

Out of town you have your own hotel, and you can go to a hotel bar/restaurant alone and you feel totally fine about because you don't know anyone. She is EXTREMELY attractive (not just to me, but when we go out, she gets an equal number of women tell her how gorgeous she is that she does men) so she's had literally zero issues outside of town to find someone. In fact, whenever we go on vacations, the 3/4somes we’ve had is ALWAYS because the guy(s) or girl(s) have found her attractive and wanted her (I’m just tolerated lol)

So because she refuses (and I agree with) using dating apps/online, and because she doesnt want to be seen by someone we/she knows while being out at a hotel bar/restaurant by herself at night, and because she's very attractive shes never had to approach anyone and is terrified of doing so, it's left her with no options or prospects.

I've given some suggestions like hanging out in coffee shops, going for lunch to restaurants alone (she's ok with lunch), or even joining some sort of activity, but because there's no alcohol involved in those scenarios (for the most part) and 99% of men can't approach a woman without drinking alcohol first (especially one of her caliber), here we are.

I was almost inclined to say that I could look online for her, but her taste in men is so varied that, apart from the Brad Pitt/George Clooney type men, I have no idea what kind of man she's into as some of the guys she’s hooked up with haven’t been the best looking guys (physical traits aren’t always what we looks for, she's also looking for a good vibe).

Any suggestions would help.

All i could say to her was... this is what it's like to be a man lol",0,1745260100.0,nonmonogamy,14,0.38,False

I work at a small coffee shop, and there’s this regular customer who’s been coming in for a while. At first, I thought nothing of it—just your typical “friendly” guy who likes to chat. But then he started showing up more often, sitting at the same table, making small talk every day, and honestly, it started to feel a little uncomfortable. He’d make comments about my appearance, ask weird personal questions, and sometimes linger longer than needed.

One day, he left a note on the counter while I was working, saying he “hoped we could hang out sometime, just the two of us.” That honestly freaked me out. I told my manager about it, and they were understanding, but they also said it wasn’t really enough to ban him. The next week, he came in again, and I couldn’t handle it anymore. I called the police after he followed me out to my car, standing there staring for what felt like forever. Has anyone else had a similar experience with someone like this?

1k4ko1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1k4ko1y/does_the_keurig_kexpress_review_reveal_the_best/,Does the Keurig K-Express Review Reveal the Best Single Serve Brewer?,"Testing the **Keurig K-Express Single Serve Coffee Maker, K-Cup Pod Brewer, Black** has been an interesting daily adventure for me. As someone who loves convenient, rich, and fresh coffee, I couldn’t resist exploring every feature this coffee maker brings to the table. Keurig has built a significant reputation for its single-serve brewers, and I was keen to see how well this model would live up to it.

**Compact Yet Sleek Design**  
The compact 15""D x 7""W x 15""H design immediately impressed me. It fits snugly on my somewhat limited kitchen counter without crowding the space—perfect for anyone dealing with a tight apartment kitchen like mine. Despite its small size, the modern black finish is both visually appealing and easy to clean. It doesn’t overpower the overall theme of my kitchen but adds a subtle sophistication. However, the plastic exterior did feel slightly less durable compared to some pricier models I’ve come across.

[Check Keurig K-Express Single Serve Coffee Maker price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b09715g57m/)

**Performance and Brewing Options**  
This coffee maker heats up swiftly and has been consistently churning out my morning caffeine fix in under two minutes—a lifesaver when I’m rushing out the door. The 3 brew size options—8, 10, and 12 oz.—offer versatility, and the STRONG button adds a bold punch to the flavor, ideal for those days I need an extra kick. I tested this feature with several K-Cup pods, and it genuinely enhances the intensity without making the coffee taste burnt or acidic. However, I noticed the brewing process can be a tad noisy, especially if your household is still asleep during early mornings.

**User-Friendly Set-Up and Operation**  
Setting up the coffee maker was foolproof. With just a few button presses, my coffee was brewing in no time. The removable 42 oz water reservoir minimized daily refills, and I could brew multiple cups before having to refill it—about 4 cups with 8 oz sizes. Having a straightforward, manual operation mode is perfect for anyone, whether you’re tech-savvy or not. The button controls are intuitive and easy even for my mom, who’s not particularly tech-friendly, whenever she visits.

**Advantages**  
- STRONG button for richer and more intense brews.
- 3 brew size options: 8, 10, and 12 oz., tailoring to different preferences.  
- Quick heating and brewing time under two minutes.  

**Pitfalls**  
- Brewing gets a bit noisy, which may disturb light sleepers.  
- The plastic exterior feels less durable compared to higher-grade models.  

**Compatibility with Various Pods**  
One of the standout features here is the compatibility with the My K-Cup reusable coffee filter (sold separately). I tried brewing my own ground coffee, and it worked like a charm—convenient for those of us who enjoy experimenting with blends. This plug-and-play approach also means you’re not locked into using specific K-Cup brands, which is always a win.

**Energy Efficiency in Daily Use**  
I appreciated the energy-efficient Auto Off feature. It powers down the device after 5 minutes of inactivity, so no accidental energy wastage happens if I forget to switch it off while dashing to work. Over a span of a week, I noticed how much more mindful I had become of my utility bill compared to older machines.

**Travel Mug Friendly Convenience**  
The removable drip tray accommodates mugs up to 7.4 inches tall. As someone who often uses a travel mug during morning commutes, I genuinely appreciated this addition. My coworker, who has a tradition of carrying hot cocoa to work, even borrowed it once and found it equally handy.

**Comparing Against Product Contenders**  
Comparing this model to slightly higher-priced alternatives like the Keurig K-Elite, I found that while the K-Elite offers extra bells and whistles, like an iced coffee mode, the K-Express holds its ground for its price range. Its straightforward functionality makes it an excellent choice for someone who values simplicity over extensive features. On the other hand, Nespresso’s Essenza Mini provides sleeker coffee shots for espresso lovers, but it lacks the versatility of accommodating standard coffee mugs or reusable filters.

**True Value for a Coffee Geek**  
From the perspective of affordability, this brewer doesn’t disappoint for its feature set. You get the well-loved Keurig convenience, versatility, and sleek design without a hefty price tag. While more premium machines might offer advanced features, for everyday coffee drinkers who want reliable service, this brewer serves its purpose magnificently.

1k4klxh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k4klxh,Excellence Punta Cana Review,"We just returned from a four-night stay at the Excellence Punta Cana and wanted to share our experience while it’s still fresh on our minds.

 

Weather:

The first two days were a bit windy and overcast with occasional showers, but the rest of the trip had perfect weather—sunny and pleasant.

 

Travel & Arrival:

We’ve visited the Dominican Republic several times, typically staying at Casa de Campo for golf. Compared to Cancun, the airport here is smaller and far less chaotic. We had arranged transportation in advance, but even without it, the local taxi scene seemed more regulated and less prone to tourist price gouging than Mexico.

 Immigration took about 20 minutes to get through.

 

Our transportation was a comfortable black SUV with a friendly driver, and the drive to the resort took around 40 minutes.

 

The Resort & Accommodations:

We’ve stayed at Excellence Collection resorts six times, previously at their three adults-only properties in Cancun. The layout of Excellence Punta Cana is similar, though the Beloved in Cancun stands out as much smaller and more intimate.

 

We always bring around $100 in small bills for tipping, and we’ve never needed to use local currency.

 

We highly recommend booking a room with Club access. We stayed in an oceanfront King with access to the Club section—featuring two pools and a separate beach area. The Club area was quieter, with no issues finding lounge chairs, even later in the morning. No early “seat saving” crowds here.

 

The beach itself was wide and uncrowded. While the rough surf prevented swimming during the first two days, conditions improved, and the water was great afterward. Lifeguards are present and attentive. Crews were out every day to rake up seaweed.

 

Check-In & Room:

Club-level guests check in at a private lounge, making the process quick and easy. Our room was clean, well-appointed, and had a great ocean view. The only issue was a lack of hot water on the first night, but maintenance resolved it within a few hours.

 

Resort Features:

The Excellence app was extremely helpful, with access to menus, restaurant hours, maps, and activities. Be aware that not all restaurants are open every night, so it’s worth checking ahead.

 

We participated in several on-site activities, all of which were well organized. That said, double-check availability—tasting activity we were interested in wasn’t running, and the app hadn’t been updated to reflect this.

 

We used the spa for a couples massage, hydrotherapy session, and a haircut/shave. The razor shave, a rare treat for me, was excellent. We recommend booking spa services ahead of time. Overall, the spa gets an A for both service and quality.

 

Dining:

 

Night 1 – Chez Isabelle French Restaurant:

We appreciate that Excellence enforces a dress code, requiring dress pants for men in certain restaurants. The ambiance was nice, service was excellent (A), but the food was good except for the ribeye. Excluding the steak, the meal was a B+.

Note: Steaks appear to be locally sourced, so temper your expectations compared to places like Ruth’s Chris.

 

Day 2 – Room Service Breakfast:

We ordered coffee and breakfast via room service daily. Dominican coffee is excellent if you haven’t had it.It was always on time, and they’d call just before delivery. Service & Quality: A

 

Lunch – Beachside Pizza:

We ordered brick oven pizzas on the beach, which took over an hour and required us to chase down our waiter. Service: D | Food: C


There are plenty of attentive drink servers in the pool and beach area. Service A

 

Dinner – Asian Fusion:

There was a 10-minute wait to be seated. Service was slow and inattentive, and we waited a while for drinks. Service: D | Food: C+

 

Day 3 – Magna Club Restaurant (Breakfast):

We loved the fresh-squeezed juices and smoothies. Service: A | Food: B

 

Dinner – Agave Mexican Restaurant:

A short 10-minute wait with a drink in hand. The highlight was the chips, salsa, and guacamole—fresh and flavorful. I ordered a bottle of wine since I wasn’t keen on the house selections. They were out of my first choice but provided a solid backup. Service: A | Food: C

 

Day 4 – Room Service Breakfast:

Fresh fruit plate and coffee again. Service & Quality: A

 

Lunch – Poolside Restaurant:

Casual and convenient for beachwear. Service: B | Food: C

 

Dinner-Oregano Italian

No wait at 7:30. This is pool side Service A  Food B  Easily our best meal

 

Day 4

Breakfast -Kitchen Table Buffet 

There was just about anything you’d ever want for breakfast. MANY choices

Food B+  Service A

 

Check out was simple and similar experience back to airport as from.

Overall Impressions:

Across the board, staff were exceptionally friendly—not just servers, but all employees. We’ve experienced this consistently at Excellence resorts, and it’s clear they take pride in their work. It seems like a great place to work, and the positive attitude shows.

 

We may return, with the understanding that while the service is top-tier, the dining may fall short of some folks fine dining expectations. But there are so many other places to explore!

1k4klqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/orangecounty/comments/1k4klqj/moving_to_oc_realtor_and_area_recs/,Moving to OC - Realtor and Area recs,"Hello!

My spouse and I are moving across the country to Orange County in June to both start new jobs and are looking for recommendations on where to live, and possibly looking for a realtor that might help find a rental. I know this sub gets a lot of these but I was hoping for some local advice specific to our future commutes. 

We are in our mid 30s, no kids, but we do have pets (1 medium sized dog and 1 cat) and are looking for a small SFH or maybe a townhome with at least a small fenced in area for our dog to be able to be let out.  We would love a nice walkable area for shops, food, maybe a brewery, walk the dog, coffee, etc and our budget is ideally in the $4-5k/mo range, but could maybe go up to $5500 or so depending on the property and utilities estimate. 

Regarding our commutes: my job will be in Costa Mesa near South Coast Plaza and my spouse will be working in Orange near UCI health. We’d both be working standard hours.

Old towne Orange looks like the vibe we are looking for but would that commute be terrible to SCP? I’ve read on here that the 55 is not great. Also considering parts of Santa Ana, Tustin, or Costa Mesa but open to any suggestions or advice. Being near the beach is not really a high priority for us.

We know literally no one out here so we would appreciate any realtor recommendations that helps potential tenants find rentals. We’re heading out for a quick weekend trip in a few weeks to scout the area out.

1k4kknj,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofassumption/comments/1k4kknj/techniques_dont_manifest_your_nervous_system_does/,"Techniques Don’t Manifest, Your Nervous System Does","This realisation changed my entire life and I hope it can change yours too.

It doesn’t matter what you do, what you say, if you write it down, if you spend 6 hours on the 10k affirmation challenge, if you visualise all day, **none of that matters.**

What **DOES** matter is your nervous system’s **reaction** to those techniques.

The **PURPOSE** of techniques is the way your nervous system responds to the implication of your desire being true. 

Your nervous system knows much more than panic and calm and excitement and fear and all this. It knows how it feels to be loved, it knows how it feels to always find a free parking spot, it knows how it feels to get a free coffee… the list goes on. Your nervous system is not just responsible for your **feelings**, it’s responsible for your state of **being**.

**Consider a problem you might have;** you lost your phone. Imagine the panic you feel wondering where it could be. If it’s stolen, if it’s dead and you can’t keep calling yourself hoping you’ll hear it, etc. Then imagine the relief that would wash over you when your friend says “I found it!”

Holding onto that relief for a moment, compare how that feels in your body in relation to the panic. You can feel the way your nerves react. From your the tips of your toes to the top of your brain.

That is what we aim to accomplish through the use of **any** technique.

Now imagine instead, in the previous example, you had sat down, taken a deep breath, cleared your mind and **ASSUMED** the feeling of having your phone back in your hands. **(because YES, the law of assumption doesn’t mean you ASSUME it to be true, it means that you ASSUME the state of being the person for whom it is true. In other words, you become that person. More on this at the end!)** 

You’d imagine the weight of your phone, the shape in your hands, and most importantly, you’d embody the relief of finding it again. 

According to the law, if you did this, your phone would find its way back into your hands.

You don’t need to say a word, or visualise a single thing, if you get good at monitoring your state (ie the state of your nervous system). In a state of meditative calm, you will be able to simply change the sensations of your nervous system by willing it to be so. 

** 

Revisiting the very definition of the law of assumption, let’s take a look at the alternative definition of the word “assume”:

**“In the context of ""assuming a role,"" the definition of ""assumption"" refers to the act of taking on or beginning to have a particular position, responsibility, or function”**

We’re talking about ASSUMING THE ROLE of the version of us who lives our desire. We do this by changing the STATE of our nervous system, or our STATE of being, oftentimes through the use of techniques.

That’s all it’s about. 

Best of luck to you all!

I’m a lawyer by day, but writing has always been my creative escape. Over the past few years, I’ve completed more than 4,000 pieces with a 100% job success score and zero client issues — something I’m genuinely proud of and always strive to maintain.

Lately, finding consistent new work on Upwork has become a bit tougher, so I thought I’d explore other spaces and maybe connect with people here.

If you’re looking for a reliable, fast, and detail-oriented writer — especially in the automotive or geopolitics space (t*hough I’m open to anything that piques my interest*) — I’d love to chat or share samples.

My rates typically range from **€0.05–€0.12 ($0.05–$0.13) per word**, depending on topic complexity and research involved.

So, if you're looking for someone dependable, I’d be glad to connect.

Thanks, and wishing everyone good gigs and great coffee! :)
