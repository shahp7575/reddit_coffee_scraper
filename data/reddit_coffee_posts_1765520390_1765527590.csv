Adopting a **ketogenic diet** can be a transformative step towards achieving your health goals. By drastically reducing carbohydrate intake and increasing fat consumption, the body enters a state of ketosis, where it burns fat for energy instead of carbs.

This metabolic shift can lead to significant weight loss, improved mental clarity, and enhanced overall well-being. To reap the full benefits of a *keto diet*, it's essential to follow a well-planned **daily routine** that includes meal planning, tracking macros, and staying hydrated.

By incorporating these elements into your lifestyle, you can maximize the effectiveness of your **ketogenic diet** and achieve your desired outcomes.

# Key Takeaways

* Understand the basics of a **ketogenic diet** and its benefits.
* Learn how to plan your meals effectively on a keto diet.
* Discover the importance of tracking your macros.
* Stay hydrated to support your overall health.
* Maximize your keto diet results with a well-structured daily routine.

# The Science and Benefits of Ketosis

Ketosis, a metabolic state characterized by fat breakdown, is the cornerstone of the keto diet's effectiveness. When you drastically reduce your carbohydrate intake, your body shifts from relying on glucose for energy to burning fat, producing ketones in the process.

# How Ketosis Works in Your Body

Ketosis occurs when your liver breaks down fat into molecules called ketones, which serve as an alternative energy source for your brain, heart, and other organs. This metabolic shift is facilitated by a significant reduction in carbohydrate consumption, forcing your body to adapt by utilizing stored fat for energy.

# Health Benefits Beyond Weight Loss

Beyond weight loss, ketosis has been linked to several health benefits, including **improved blood sugar control**, *enhanced mental clarity*, and **reduced inflammation**

I was diagnosed type 2 diabetic approx 3 months ago and am taking Metformin. Also have high cholesterol and blood pressure and taking medication for both of those as well.

Pre-diagnoses, I had the typical symptoms including frequent urination. I was under the impression that now I am taking medication and eating the right things etc that the frequent urination would ease up. However, it's gotten worse. Example would be I go to the toilet before bed at night and then get up at least 2 more times in the next 30 minutes to go again and it's quite a lot of urine each time. It's not just at night, it's all throughout the day, large amounts of urine maybe on average once an hour. 

I used to drink *a lot* of iced coffee (here in Australia there's a popular one you can get in a two litre bottle) but it's 'healthy' (sarcastic) - made with 99.5% fat free milk, no added sugar. So it could be worse. However, I only have that every now and then, I drink water all day but I drank water all day before my diagnosis also and never had this problem with the urination.

I told my doctor about it and he's a bit stumped. I'm due my 3 monthly bloods soon so he will keep an eye on things there. 

I'm just really confused about all the peeing. It's now got to the point that it's really annoying.

Is this something that just now comes with the territory? Or has someone has this before and it turned out to be another issue entirely?

I’ve seen this guy during  COVID. We went on one coffee date, I liked his company, not attracted romantically. Also  a few casual meetups, just walks. Nothing serious.

But here’s the pattern:

Our fourth meet-up was supposed to be a real date.  I thought I give him a chance.  I waited for him  at the location all dolled up.  I called and messaged, no reply!  I heard from  him 3 weeks. Later said his mom was sick. We stopped talking.  

A year later, he asked for lunch. I scheduled my work break, but he texted 20 mins before saying he could only come later. I couldn’t adjust, so I left.

Two months later, he wanted coffee. I went there, he didn’t show, and then texted he was “cleaning his gun” and would be 30 mins late. I left.

Now every time he tries to make plans, I immediately think he’ll cancel and havnt been entertaining his requests.  Recently, he suggested mini-golf. I told him I won’t be following up constantly to see if he’ll actually show. He said he’d be there Friday at 6:30… but I haven’t heard from him since to confirm, no communication at all.  

Honestly, I already know I should cut ties. But… do I just ignore this? Show up? Follow up? Or save myself the stress and not go at all?

1pkmkrc,https://www.reddit.com/r/travelchina/comments/1pkmkrc/the_brutal_reality_of_paying_in_china_a_guide_to/,The brutal reality of paying in China: A guide to not getting stuck (and why cash fails),"(English is not my native language, so I used AI to help me with spell checking/grammar. But the advice is 100% from reality.)

I’ve seen too many posts from travelers panicking because they landed in China and realized they couldn't buy a bottle of water. I want to clear up the confusion about payment here. This isn't a tech manual, it's just a heads-up on how things actually work on the street so you don't get stranded.

**First, you need to change your mindset.**  
In the West, Apple Pay or Google Pay is a ""convenient option."" In China, mobile payment isn't an option—it is the operating system of the entire country.

I know the guidebooks say ""Cash is legally accepted."" While that is true on paper, the reality is very different. If you try to survive on cash only, you are going to have a hard time.

**Here is why shops hate taking your cash (It’s not personal)**  
I see tourists getting frustrated when a shopkeeper waves away their money. Please understand: they aren't trying to be rude. The problem is that their shop literally isn't built for cash anymore.

Imagine a typical coffee shop or noodle place:

1. **There is no register.** Everything is automated. You scan a code to order, the system calculates the price, and the money goes straight to the cloud.
2. **There is no change.** Because nobody pays with cash, the shopkeeper doesn't keep a drawer of bills. If you hand them a 100 RMB note for a 12 RMB drink, you are creating a huge operational crisis. They have to run around asking other customers for change.
3. **The staff doesn't know how.** Many young staff members have never managed a cash till.

So when you insist on cash, you aren't just ""paying""—you are breaking their workflow.

**My honest advice? Just use Alipay.**  
China has two giants: Alipay and WeChat Pay.  
If you are a foreigner, just stick to **Alipay**.

WeChat is a social network first, and payment second. It’s hard to register, easy to get blocked, and often needs verification from a local friend.  
Alipay is much friendlier. It works better with international Visa/Mastercard and doesn't require as much social verification. You don't need both. Just get Alipay working and you are safe for 95% of your trip.

**Do NOT get on the plane until you do this:**  
Please set this up before you arrive. The internet at the airport can be tricky and you don't want to be debugging your phone while jet-lagged.

* **Download Alipay.**
* **Link your foreign card** (Visa/Mastercard).
* **Do the Identity Verification.** You will need to upload a picture of your passport. Just do it. You can't skip this.
* **Have a working phone number.** You need to receive SMS verification codes. A roaming number is fine, or buy a local SIM, but make sure you can get texts.

**One final reality check**  
The Chinese mobile payment system was designed for locals, not for visitors. By using the ""International Version,"" you are basically hacking your way into a closed system.

Sometimes it will fail. Sometimes a random small vendor won't accept a foreign card. It happens. Don't panic. Just try a different shop, or ask a local to pay for you and give them the cash (locals can use the cash, you can't).

Don't expect 100% perfection, just aim for ""working most of the time,"" and you'll be fine.

**TL;DR:** Cash is a headache. Download Alipay, link your Visa card, and verify your passport BEFORE you fly. Happy travels!",0,1765527030.0,travelchina,1,0.5,False

Here's What to Know,"Hearing that you need a filling can feel overwhelming, especially if it's your first time facing dental restoration. The good news? Modern dental fillings are more comfortable, durable, and natural-looking than ever before. If you're in Canton and your dentist has recommended a filling, understanding the process can help ease any concerns and prepare you for a smooth, straightforward treatment that protects your tooth from further damage.

When a [dentist in Canton](https://cantonhealthysmiles.com/) identifies a cavity during your routine exam, they're catching a problem early before it becomes painful or requires more extensive work. A filling restores the damaged portion of your tooth, preventing bacteria from spreading deeper into the structure and causing infection or tooth loss.

# Why Your Dentist Recommends a Filling

Cavities develop when bacteria in your mouth produce acids that erode tooth enamel. Without treatment, this decay penetrates deeper layers of the tooth, potentially reaching the nerve and causing significant pain. Your dentist recommends a filling to:

* Stop the progression of decay
* Restore the tooth's shape and function
* Prevent sensitivity and discomfort
* Protect surrounding teeth from bacterial spread
* Avoid more complex procedures like root canals or extractions

During your examination, your dentist uses visual inspection, special instruments, and sometimes X-rays to detect cavities. Small dark spots, rough areas, or temperature sensitivity often signal decay that requires attention.

# What Are Dental Fillings and How Do They Work?

**Dental fillings canton** residents receive today are designed to blend seamlessly with natural teeth while providing lasting protection. A filling is a restorative material used to repair a tooth damaged by decay. The procedure involves removing the decayed portion and filling the space with a durable material that prevents further deterioration.

Modern fillings come in several types:

**Composite Resin Fillings**: These tooth-colored fillings match your natural enamel and are ideal for visible teeth. They bond directly to the tooth structure, providing excellent support and a natural appearance.

**Amalgam Fillings**: Made from a mixture of metals, these silver-colored fillings are extremely durable and cost-effective, making them suitable for back teeth that endure heavy chewing pressure.

**Ceramic Fillings**: Crafted from porcelain, these fillings resist staining better than composite resin and offer a natural look with exceptional durability.

**Glass Ionomer Fillings**: These release fluoride to help prevent future decay and work well for fillings below the gum line or in baby teeth.

# The Filling Procedure: What to Expect

Getting a filling is typically a quick, comfortable procedure. Here's what happens during your appointment:

Your dentist begins by numbing the area with local anesthesia, ensuring you feel no discomfort. Once the area is numb, they carefully remove the decayed portion using specialized instruments. The tooth is then thoroughly cleaned to eliminate bacteria and debris.

Next, the filling material is placed in layers (for composite fillings) or as a single application (for amalgam). Each layer is hardened using a special curing light. Finally, your dentist shapes and polishes the filling to match your bite and ensure comfort when you chew.

The entire process usually takes 30 to 60 minutes, depending on the filling's size and location. Many patients return to their normal activities immediately after treatment, though numbness may last a few hours.

# Caring for Your Fillings

Proper maintenance extends the life of your restoration. Here in Canton, where many of us enjoy local favorites at Cherry Hill Orchards or grab coffee along Ford Road, it's important to maintain good oral habits between these moments.

Brush twice daily with fluoride toothpaste, floss daily to remove plaque between teeth, and limit sugary foods and beverages that promote decay. Regular checkups allow your dentist to monitor your fillings and catch any issues early.

Most fillings last 5 to 15 years, depending on the material, location, and your oral hygiene habits. Composite fillings may need replacement sooner than amalgam, but they offer superior aesthetics for front teeth.

# Signs You Might Need a Filling

Sometimes cavities develop between regular dental visits. Watch for these warning signs:

* Persistent toothache or sensitivity to hot, cold, or sweet foods
* Visible holes or dark spots on teeth
* Pain when biting down
* Rough or jagged edges you can feel with your tongue
* Food consistently getting stuck in the same spot

If you notice any of these symptoms, schedule an appointment promptly. Early treatment prevents more extensive damage and keeps procedures simple.

# Preventing Future Cavities

While fillings effectively treat current decay, prevention is always the best approach. Maintain a consistent oral care routine, drink fluoridated tap water (Canton's water system includes fluoride), and consider dental sealants for added protection on back teeth.

Limit snacking between meals, as frequent eating exposes teeth to acid attacks throughout the day. When you do snack, choose tooth-friendly options like cheese, nuts, or crisp vegetables that stimulate saliva production and naturally clean teeth.

Regular professional cleanings remove hardened plaque that brushing misses, and fluoride treatments strengthen enamel against decay. Your dental team can also provide personalized advice based on your specific risk factors.

# Addressing Common Concerns

Many patients worry about pain during the procedure. Modern anesthetics and techniques make fillings virtually painless. Some sensitivity after treatment is normal as your tooth adjusts, but this typically resolves within a few days.

Cost concerns are understandable. Most dental insurance plans cover a significant portion of filling costs, and many offices offer payment plans to make treatment accessible. Addressing cavities early prevents more expensive procedures later.

If dental anxiety holds you back, communicate with your dentist. They can offer sedation options or schedule shorter appointments to make the experience more comfortable.

# Conclusion

Learning you need a filling doesn't have to be stressful. This common procedure protects your tooth from further damage, relieves discomfort, and restores full function. With modern materials and techniques, [dental fillings ](https://cantonhealthysmiles.com/canton-mi/dental-fillings/)that patients receive are comfortable, durable, and virtually undetectable.

Don't delay treatment when your dentist identifies a cavity. Early intervention keeps procedures simple and prevents complications that could compromise your tooth. Your smile is worth protecting, and addressing decay promptly ensures your teeth stay healthy for years to come.

It’s architecture-leaning (and a bit premium), but the core shift is relevant: gyms are being judged more like retail/coffee spaces where **the experience and atmosphere are part of the product**, not an afterthought.

**Full article here:** [**Reimagining Gym Spaces: The Rise of Design-Driven Fitness Experiences**](https://www.archdaily.com/1022906/reimagining-gym-spaces-the-rise-of-design-driven-fitness-experiences)

https://preview.redd.it/1xsff78kcq6g1.png?width=955&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313058005ef0cc16f5e78813843a96a2a4f68de

**Quick takeaways:**

* Members—especially younger cohorts—are paying more attention to how a gym feels, not just what equipment it has.
* Equipment and fixtures are increasingly treated as design elements (materials, textures, visual coherence), not just utilitarian objects.
* The “comfort + vibe” expectation is rising as people spend more time in gyms and compare them to other lifestyle spaces.
* Even if you’re not going luxury, the idea scales down: small upgrades in flow, lighting, and visual consistency can change perceived value fast.

**Would love to hear how this shows up in your gyms:**

• Are members in your area caring more about **vibe/space quality** lately, or is it still mostly programming + price?  
• What’s been your highest-ROI design upgrade so far (lighting, storage, zoning, colors, etc.)?  
• Any design trends you think are overrated for non-premium gyms?",1,1765526456.0,GymOwnerNetwork,0,1.0,False

1pkmdi6,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_vrishaann/comments/1pkmdi6/business_proposal/,Business Proposal,"Chapter 1

The Mumbai skyline glittered like a secret through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the mansion. It was a big five-bedroom house in Juhu. Karan got the job that made this possible. He was 25. He worked as a junior software architect at Apex Innovations. The company grew very fast in two years. It had big money from investors. People talked about it going public soon. We left Delhi in a hurry. We got married without telling anyone. My family was angry. They said a Chaurasiya girl should not marry someone like Karan. I am Himanshi Chaurasiya. I was 22. I studied home science in college. I never used the degree. I wanted love more than family rules.

Karan and I met two years ago at a college fest in Delhi. I was in my final year. He was doing his engineering nearby. It was a rainy evening. The event got delayed because of the weather. Everyone waited under a small shed. Karan stood next to me. He offered his jacket because I was shivering.

Karan: Himanshi, take this. You look cold.

Himanshi: Thank you. But I do not even know you.

Karan: I am Karan Goyal. From the computer science batch at the next college. What is your name?

Himanshi: Himanshi Chaurasiya. Home science. This rain is never ending.

We started talking. He made jokes about the bad music playing. I laughed. He asked for my number to return the jacket. I gave it. The next day he called. We met for coffee. Then walks in the park. He listened to my dreams about cooking for a living. I liked how he talked about building apps that help people. We fell in love slowly. Dates turned into late night calls. He held my hand during movies. I felt safe with him.

My family wanted me to marry a boy from our community. Someone with land and business. Karan had nothing like that. He was from a simple family. They ran a small shop. When I told my parents about him, they said no.

Himanshi's mother: Himanshi, this boy has no future. We found a good match. Doctor's son.

Himanshi: Ma, I love Karan. He works hard. He got a big job offer.

Himanshi's father: Love does not pay bills. End this now.

Karan's parents were okay but worried.

Karan's father: Son, think carefully. Her family is different.

Karan: Papa, I cannot live without her.

We were young. But the love felt real. Not just excitement. We planned for months. Saved money. When the job offer came from Mumbai, we decided. One night we took a train. Got married at a small temple. No guests. Just us and a priest. It was scary. But his hand in mine felt right. Was it childish? Maybe a little. We fought the world. But we were truly in love. We still are.

The first flat from the company was in Andheri. It looked new and clean. The walls were white. The kitchen was small. The balcony faced the noisy highway. Karan liked his work. He came home excited. He talked about computer codes and meetings. He kissed me hard. Then he sat on the couch. I made food he loved. Aloo paratha with lots of butter. Butter chicken that was rich and creamy. The flat started to feel like home. We had sex often. It was fast and fun. We laughed a lot. He put me on the kitchen counter. He lifted my nightie. He said I was everything to him.

Karan: Himanshi, this paratha is the best. You make every day special.

Himanshi: Karan, eat more. You work too hard.

Everything changed because of one dinner invite.

Mr. Vikram Agarwal was Karan's boss. He was the CEO of Apex. He was 42. His wife died 12 years ago. They were married only three years. He lived alone and had a lot of money. His penthouse was in Bandra. It looked over the sea. The floors were marble. The paintings were expensive. He saw Karan was good at work. He gave Karan quick promotions. He heard I could cook. His eyes looked interested. He said on a video call, “Bring your wife. I miss home food.”

We went there dressed nicely. Karan wore his good shirt. I wore a red saree. It fit close to my body. The blouse was low in the front. My heart beat fast. Vikram opened the door. He was tall and strong. His hair had some gray. He smiled with lines around his eyes. “Himanshi, you look beautiful,” he said. His hand held mine longer than needed. The food was from a caterer. But he asked me to taste everything. We drank wine. He asked about our secret marriage. He laughed at my family's anger. “Young love,” he said and raised his glass. “I know that feeling.”

Vikram: Karan, tell me more about your project. Himanshi, try this wine. It is from France.

Karan: Sir, the new feature will change everything. Himanshi, pass the naan.

Himanshi: Vikram, the fish is good. But a little more spice would help.

Vikram: Himanshi, you are right. Next time you cook for us.

Invitations came more after that. Brunch. A big party. Coffee that lasted long. Vikram was nice. He acted like a father sometimes. He gave Karan a nice watch. He gave me a silk scarf. It cost more than my mother's gold. Then he made the offer. “My house in Juhu is too large for me alone. Come live there. Himanshi, your cooking will make it feel warm. Like a family.” Karan thought about it. The house had no rent. There was a pool. People worked there to help. Vikram was kind to us. Karan said, “He teaches me a lot.” I agreed. I tried not to think about the warm feeling when Vikram looked at my mouth.

Vikram: Karan, the watch suits you. Himanshi, this scarf is for you. Soft like your hands.

Karan: Thank you, sir. Himanshi, say thanks.

Himanshi: Vikram, it is beautiful. You are too kind.

We moved in. The house was huge. The bedrooms were like hotel rooms. The kitchen was big. I could move freely while cooking. There was a room for movies. It got dark with one button. I cooked every day. Dal makhani that was smooth. Biryani with saffron on top. Gulab jamun that was sweet and soft. Vikram liked it. “Himanshi, this is wonderful,” he said. His voice was gentle. Karan stayed late at work many times. When he came to our part of the house, he made love to me. It was slow. The bed faced the sea. The wind made our skin cool.

Karan: Himanshi, the office was crazy today. But coming home to you fixes everything.

Himanshi: Karan, rest now. I made your favorite tea.

I started to feel safe. My family did not call. No cards for holidays. Vikram talked to us. He watched films with us. He told about his wife. She was a dancer. She died young. “I did not marry again,” he said one night. He drank whiskey. “The company is like my child.” Karan did better at work. People said he might become a partner.

Vikram: Karan, good job on the report. Himanshi, join us for the movie. It is an old one.

Karan: Sir, thank you. Himanshi, come sit.

Himanshi: Vikram, what is the film about?

One Tuesday at dinner, things changed.

The table looked nice. I made paneer butter masala. The naan was hot and a little burnt on the edges. Raita was cold and fresh. Vikram poured wine. It was old and costly. Karan talked with energy about his work. I wore a simple kurti. My hair was down. I felt like I belonged.

Karan: Sir, the team finished the code early. Himanshi, your masala is perfect today.

Himanshi: Karan, eat slowly. Vikram, more wine?

Vikram: Himanshi, yes please. You two make this house feel alive. I wish I had my own family. At least one child to take over the business. Apex needs someone from my blood.

Karan: Sir, you can adopt. Many smart people are out there.

Vikram: Adoption does not feel real. I want my own child. Someone with my blood.

He moved the wine in his glass. The room was quiet. We heard only the spoons and forks.

After half an hour, we did not touch the sweet dish. Vikram leaned closer.

Vikram: Karan. Himanshi. What if you help me? Himanshi, you carry my child.

I stopped moving. My fork was in the air. Karan drank wine and started coughing.

Karan: Sir?

Vikram: Let me explain. It is not bad. The child will be mine and Himanshi's. That child gets fifty percent of Apex. A child you two have together gets the other fifty percent. Karan, I see you as a son. This makes your future safe too. Himanshi, you stay married to Karan. No one needs to know. We can use doctors if needed. But natural way is better.

My heart beat very fast.

Himanshi: You say this to my face? With my husband here?

Vikram: He is part of the family. Karan, think about the money. Billions. Our children will never worry.

Karan: This is crazy.

He did not say no. We left the table soon. We went to our room early. Karan walked back and forth.

Karan: He has lost his mind. But fifty percent? Himanshi, that is a lot of money.

I sat on the bed.

Himanshi: You want to give me away? For money?

Karan: Not give away. It is for our future. I love you. Nothing changes that.

We did not sleep much. We talked in low voices until morning. We were tired. I said, “Ask him more tomorrow.” We lay down early that night. The house was quiet. My mind was full of thoughts.",1,1765526259.0,u_vrishaann,0,1.0,False

1pkmc7x,https://i.redd.it/wy5yjaikbq6g1.jpeg,Review of mCaffeine FIEN Perfumes,"Slow Kiss.

Longevity

On me, Slow Kiss genuinely lasts about 8 hours easily. On clothes, it sticks around even longer and sometimes I catch whiffs the next day. For the price, the longevity surprised me.

Projection

Projection is moderate but steady. For the first two hours it’s definitely noticeable when people come close, but it never becomes shouty or overwhelming. More of a “that guy smells good” kind of presence.

Sillage
The sillage is smooth and subtle. When I walk past someone, there’s a fresh-warm trail but nothing too loud. Perfect if you don’t want to smell like you emptied a bottle on yourself.

Notes & Usage
It opens fresh (that pear-ginger combo is nice), then settles into a slightly warm, musky, leathery vibe. Overall it feels clean, modern, and a little sensual.

Where I use it:
Daily wear, meetings, casual dates, or any situation where I want to smell good without making a statement. Super versatile and safe.

Midnight in Bombay 

Longevity
This one lasts around 6 hrs on my skin. Some days it feels strong, some days it fades quicker and is definitely more unpredictable than Slow Kiss. On clothes, it holds better.

Projection
Projection starts off pretty noticeable because of the sweet gourmand opening. But after an hour or two, it sits closer to the skin. Not a powerhouse, more of a cozy aura.

Sillage
The sillage is on the softer side. You won’t leave a huge trail, but people near you will catch a warm, sweet whiff. It’s more intimate than attention-grabbing.

Notes & Usage

The vibe is coffee-vanilla-chocolate with woody undertones. On me, the chocolatey warmth comes out more than the coffee. It’s a sweet, comforting scent good for evenings.

Where I use it:
Chill nights out, cafes, late drives, or when I want something soft, sweet, and warm without being too loud.

If you’re looking for something versatile and reliable, Slow Kiss wins.
If you want a warmer, sweeter vibe for nightwear, Midnight in Bombay makes sense",1,1765526111.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,1,1.0,False

The room feels secure to me, an 800 sq. foot piece of earth dedicated to myself, my vulnerability, and the essence that reflects me. I dreamt about waking up and sitting on the carpet stoically, drinking coffee, listening to the doorbell chimes of marketplaces nearby, soaking in the energy of my room which, of course, reflects me. This moment seems perfect to me, a little brain trying to live among the masses in his own little corner and to help others as best as possible.

However, I also guard my place with all my might. It is because my room also holds the things I am not very proud of, but which are still very much a part of me. I am afraid of letting people access those parts; I am afraid of letting people know the real me. I refuse to let them in. To me, one is not entitled to those parts unless I can trust you. When I trust you, I know I can be vulnerable with you, and I know that I would open drawers for you. I would show you who I am, how I want to be treated, and what I wish people would know about me. I would be a soul melting in front of you, that is how much I yearn to show my vulnerability.

When I do open drawers for you, it is no longer a place fiercely guarded by me; it becomes our place, which I want to share with you. The stoicism now shifts to togetherness. For this generosity, I want you to fill the space with the things that describe you, that reflect your thinking and individuality. I want your vulnerability if I am giving you mine.

Every item I remove means I need a workaround or I'm just accepting that I won't have that thing available. The stove and fuel are heavy, like really heavy when I'm carrying everything for multiple days. But I also need hot water for food, coffee, and staying warm in cold weather. Can't just skip it unless I'm okay eating cold meals the entire trip which sounds miserable or learning how to make my own fire with sticks and stuff.  
Started watching ultralight backpacking videos and those people are on another level. Packs weighing fifteen pounds for week-long trips while I'm struggling to get mine under thirty-five. They cut labels off gear, saw toothbrushes in half, use trash bags instead of stuff sacks. Impressive but exhausting.  
The gear rabbit hole is real. Lighter tents cost three times as much. Same with sleeping bags and backpacks. You can shave pounds but it costs serious money.  
Been looking at alternatives on alibaba and gear sites. Solar kettles came up as a no-fuel option for boiling water but reviews are mixed. Alcohol stoves are lighter than canister stoves but slower. Cold soaking food is weightless but requires different meal planning.  
Every solution creates new problems. A lighter sleeping bag means you're cold at night. Skip extra clothes and you're miserable when the weather changes. Cut back on food and you're starving halfway through.  
Still figuring out the balance between comfort and weight. Probably gonna take a few more trips to dial it in.

I checked my account $2.15 left and it was only the 23rd. And honestly, that wasn’t even the first time it happened.



I share a two-bedroom with my roommate about half a mile from campus. Rent’s $650 a month, plus around $70 in utilities. Between my part-time job at the campus bookstore (bringing home about $1,200 after taxes) and some help from my parents ($400), I start each month with roughly $1,600. After covering rent and utilities, I have about $880 left for everything else food, laundry, going out, whatever. Should be enough, right?



I don’t have a car, so I walk everywhere campus is just 10 minutes away. But during the first two weeks, when money’s flowing, I was impulsively spending like crazy: daily Starbucks ($6-7), DoorDash 3-4 times a week ($22-30 per order), Ubers to the grocery store, random stops for energy drinks and snacks. Then week 3 hits, and I start stressing. By week 4, I’m living on boxed mac and cheese and ramen, hiding from friends who wanna grab food because I’m broke.



One Sunday, I sat down and looked at where my money went:

* $150 at Starbucks (5 days a week)
* $330 on delivery apps
* $110 on snacks and impulsive buys
* $50 on laundry (once a week)
* $70 on Ubers
* $60 going out with friends
* $35 on toiletries and random stuff

That’s about $805 out of my $880 budget leaving me with just $75, and I hadn’t even bought groceries yet. No wonder I was eating ramen by week 4.



That moment made me realize I needed to SEE where my money was going in real time, not just panic when the account was empty. A friend suggested using budgeting apps like iSpend AI or Money Manager to track daily expenses. So I gave it a shot.



What really helped was seeing how much I had left each day, which made me think twice before ordering DoorDash. I also set budgets for each category like $80 a month for coffee so I didn’t feel guilty about small treats, but I had to stick to it.



Now, I’m not saving hundreds overnight, but I’ve managed to:

* Cut Starbucks to 2 times a week instead of daily
* Cook most nights, order in once a week
* Budget $120 for groceries each month
* And at the end of the month, I’ve got around $100-$120 left over.

Whether it's for a special occasion or just to show appreciation, the options available are as varied as the unique personalities of cat fathers. A thoughtful cat dad gift is a way to celebrate his love for his feline friend while also bringing a smile to his face.

Consider personalized items, such as custom cat-themed mugs or T-shirts that showcase his favorite furry companion. These gifts add a personal touch that can make them feel extra special. A mug with a cute cat image and a witty saying creates the perfect start to his coffee-filled mornings.

For the more practical cat dad, pet grooming tools can be an excellent choice. High-quality brushes, catnip-infused toys, or even a cozy cat bed can enhance the bond between him and his pet while making his daily routine a bit easier. These gifts show that you understand and support his role as a cat dad.

Another popular trend is cat-themed home decor. Wall art featuring whimsical cat illustrations or clever quotes about cats can be a charming addition to his living space. These decorative gifts can highlight his passion for felines and can easily be conversation starters.

Lastly, consider experiences as cat dad gifts. Gift him a day at a cat cafe or tickets to a pet expo, where he can indulge in his love for cats. Experiences create lasting memories and are often more meaningful than material items.

Ultimately, the best cat dad gift is one that reflects his personality and passion for his furry friends. By choosing something thoughtful and unique, you can celebrate the loving bond between a cat dad and his beloved pet.",1,1765524902.0,MyKittenPet,0,1.0,False

I got a solid ADHD, like I can’t work full Time, simple things can be very complicated (I can take like 20 minutes to just make a coffee because I can’t focus on anything). And of course i’ve got anxiety, and a history with dépression.
I started meditation a few years ago, because my anxiety was really, really bad.

There were times when I was really consistent, and other times when I just couldn’t keep it up.

Last june, I followed a MAPS protocol, maybe you know what it is, but in short, its like a MBSR but specifically for ADHD adults. Since then, I meditate almost everyday. 

I can feel its good for me (I dont just feel it actually I made some podcasts about meditation, I dont share it here because its in french but its very interesting and i read a lot of scientific litterature about meditation). I can feel i’m less anxious and i have better perspective on my emotions.

But this is still a struggle. Like, this is so difficult. Everyday, my mind is like : NO I DONT WANT TO MEDITATE I WANT TO DO STUFF. Everyday when i do meditate im like, not focused at all. I meditate 10 minutes, Sometimes 20 or 30 but i feel like its not enough and 1 hour a day would be very good for me, but i can’t make it. And my mind is so chaotic. I think about everything at once. I got all the emotions. I can’t say it go better, this is just me, sitting on my inner chaos, trying to feel my breathe or my body but never focused. 

I don’t know what I want here. Maybe its just my anxiety speaking. This is so fucking awful to have this level of ADHD. Everything is hard. Maybe I just need some reassurance, or to hear about other people’s experiences with this Kind of things. I dont want to quit, but Sometimes i feel like this is pointless. I dont know.

TLDR: I got ADHD and I meditate but its freaking hard, doesn’t get easier and I dont know what to do",3,1765524712.0,Meditation,1,1.0,False

1pklv1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingfeedback/comments/1pklv1b/our_first_christmas_in_the_appalachian_mountains/,Our first christmas in the appalachian mountains,"Me and Rowan had only been in the new house for three weeks, a quiet somewhat secluded house in the mountains. Just in time to celebrate our first Christmas together. The boxes weren’t all unpacked, and the heat ran a little too long before kicking in, but we were determined to make it feel like home. I hung warm lights inside every window, set up our first tree, and lit a cinnamon candle on the coffee table.

The tree had already started dropping pine needles, but that’s what comes with a real tree I told myself. And considering the price, we got very lucky. Not the most normal purchase I have made, from an elderly man outside his falling apart farm house. It seemed to be the only one he was selling. But considering it was a week from Christmas, I happily took it off his hands.

“Cozy,” Rowan said.

“Almost,” I replied, rubbing my arms. “It’s colder tonight.”

Rowan nodded, glancing toward the hallway. “Yeah. Feels like a draft.”

I didn’t mention that I’d thought she saw something move there, just a small shape, low to the ground, like someone crouched too close to the floor. A trick of the lights, I told myself.

We spent the evening watching Christmas movies, but neither of us could fully relax. I kept feeling watched from the kitchen doorway. I didn’t see anything, never long enough to be sure, but every time I turned my head, I caught the tail end of motion, just slipping out of sight.

We went to bed early. The house felt too busy, even with just the two of us, it felt like someone, or something was always just out of sight. Just after midnight, I woke to the quietest, most deliberate creak. I lifted my head. Rowan was asleep beside me.

Another creak.

Closer this time.

Right outside their door.

My breath caught. I could feel something on the other side, crouched, waiting. I didn’t dare wake Rowan any movement felt like an invitation. Eventually the pressure faded and the sense of being watched slipped away. I eventually fell asleep to the sound of the wind, telling myself it had only been the house settling.

Morning came, I tried to shake it off.

We planned to wrap presents and we laughed about “new house paranoia.”

But on the floor outside the bedroom door, Rowan noticed something on the floor right outside the bedroom door, pine needles. A whole cluster of them.

We went downstairs and I immediately noticed it, the tree, which yesterday was tucked neatly into the corner, was now almost a foot or two away from the wall, leaving a big gap behind it. Well, we were very tired last night, it couldn’t have been anything else but simple misremembering. I hoped. I didn’t mention it.

We stayed up late, trying to act normal. We played music, made popcorn, talked about which ornaments to buy next year. But the house felt different, too still, too expectant.

Sometime around midnight, the lights flickered. Not the whole house just the strings in the living room and hallway. They dimmed and brightened in a slow pulse, like the house was breathing.

Rowan’s voice was tight. “Did you see that?”

I nodded. “Maybe old wiring.” Desperate to prove that our new house that we worked so hard for, didn’t turn out to be haunted

“Maybe,” Rowan said. But he was staring at the dark corner behind the tree, just to the right of where I was sat, just out of m peripheral “Jamie… do you feel like something is in here with us?”

I did. I had all evening, a prickling sense that someone was just behind my chair, leaning in close, so close they could see the pattern of my Pjs. Every time I turned, nothing was there. But the feeling snapped back the moment i looked away.

Around one in the morning, Rowan went to brush his teeth, but he didn’t come back.

I waited.

Five minutes.

Ten.

Finally, I got up.

“Rowan?” I called softly.

Movement answered.

Not Rowan’s voice just a quick shuffle, like feet … or hands scurrying across the tiles.

I stepped into the hallway. The lights were low, dimmed as though something pressed its weight against the wiring. The bathroom door was open. Inside, Rowan stood frozen at the sink, toothbrush in hand, eyes locked on the mirror. I followed his gaze.

There was nothing in the reflection behind Rowan… but the ceiling above the doorway looked wrong, just a shade darker than it should be, like something was pressed flat against it, clinging there, head angled down watching Rowan from above, trying to be out of sight, almost afraid of being seen.

I blinked. The dark patch dissolved, retreating fast into the corner where the light didn’t quite reach. Rowan whispered, “We need to leave.”

We packed nothing. Just grabbed coats and headed for the front door, but as we reached the living room, we stopped dead. The tree was no longer upright It was bent, almost bowed, its top angled down as if something heavy had been perched on it, pine needles, far too many to make sense, were scattered across the floor in a trail leading to the hallway.

I swallowed hard. “Go. Now.”

We moved fast. Rowan reached for the door but it opened before they touched it. We ran out the house, and didn’t stop running until we reached the car. Breathing rapid and shallow he reversed out, swerving and setting off down the road.

Rowan tore down the icy road, hands shaking, headlights slicing through the dark. I pressed a hand to her chest, trying to breathe.

“We’re almost out,” Rowan whispered. “We’re almost—”

A sudden chill swept through the car. Not from outside but from the back seat. I felt a gentle brush of cold air, like something had leaned close. Rowan noticed this and dared to look in the rear view mirror.

“Jamie, do not turn around”

My breath caught in my throat and I knew what It was before I saw it, it was the creature. it had followed them, I saw it clearly now, almost under a spotlight with each passing streetlight. It was curled up on their back seat, its head slowly looked up to make eye contact and I screamed. Rowan swerved in a panic, and the car skidded into a soft snowbank at the edge of the woods. The impact was mild, just enough to shake loose a dusting of snow from the branches overhead.

Me and Rowan were slightly dazed, but shared a quick glance with each other before turning our heads to see into the backseat. The creature wasn’t curled up now. It sat upright, its long, wooden limbs folded neatly. Pine needles drifted from its twig-like hair. Its dark eyes weren’t hungry… just ancient. Watching.

I gasped, but the creature didn’t move. We both winced and prepared for an attack of some sort, our hearts ripped out or even our heads removed. We just hoped it would be quick. With almost a minute past and we still had our heads, a small noise made us open our eyes. The creature lifted one hand and pointed out the window. I cautiously followed the gesture.

An old, half-rotted sign stood crooked in the snow

GUARDIANS OF THE ROOTED HILL

HONOR THE WOOD

RESPECT THE TREE TAKEN

Rowan whispered, “Guardians…?”

I froze, and then it hit me.

“The Christmas tree,” I murmured. “The one from the old farm estate…this is where we got it from, the old man said it was ‘from special land.’ We thought they meant organic.”

Rowan swallowed. “You think… it was cut from here?”

The creature blinked once, slowly, like a nod.

Then it pressed one twig-finger gently to its own chest and motioned to the land they had gotten the tree from. I felt my stomach twist. “It was part of them.” Not the creature itself, but its forest. Its family. Its home.

The creature blinked softly, and my eyes softened. Rowan’s grip on the wheel loosened, we had been running from something we never tried to understand. It never even tried to hurt us, or even scare us. In fact, it tried to do the opposite, tried to stay out of sight, it was us always looking for it in the corner of our eyes.

I turned fully toward the creature. “You followed us because the tree is a part of you?”

The creature nodded. Rowan’s voice cracked. “And now we are your guardians.” He said as a statement more than a question, the creature seemed to become less terrifying by the second. A warmth spread through the car not heat, but relief. The oppressive fear lifted, replaced with something calmer, older, rooted, I reached out a trembling hand.

The creature leaned forward and, very gently, touched my fingers with its wooden ones. Its touch was cold, but not frightening. A thank you. Or a greeting.

Rowan exhaled. “We took it without meaning harm. We didn’t know.”

The creature tilted its head, as if listening, and then pointed back down the snowy road toward their home. I smiled sympathetically. The creature’s eyes glowed faintly, like embers warming in the dark, and its face began to look more human. I saw movement in the back window and tried to focus my eyes. Figures emerged from the trees, dozens of them. Not menacing, just watching, curious, hopeful. Their shapes were gentle, like a stray kitten approaching a human for the first time. I looked at my husband and we smiled,

Rowan placed a hand on my knee.

“Let’s go home,” he whispered.

The creatures parted, forming a quiet path back toward the house. Guiding us, not forcing us, and we felt like we were part of something bigger, more important. As Guardians. I wondered how many of them were out there.

Me and Rowan stepped out into the snow, hands intertwined, the creature padding beside us like a silent guardian of its own. And for the first time, the night didn’t feel cold, all three of us, finally felt safe.",1,1765524181.0,writingfeedback,0,1.0,False

Want to lose an easy 4 pounds during a month like I did?

Best fat-loss recipes (all < 80 kcal):
•  10–15 g pure unsweetened cocoa powder (e.g., Navitas, Viva Naturals, or Ghirardelli 100 %) + hot water + pinch of salt + stevia/monk fruit
•  20–30 g 100 % baking chocolate melted into black coffee (“mocha”)
•  10 g high-flavanol cocoa (CocoaVia packets) in water or unsweetened almond milk
Realistic Expectation
By itself, cocoa is not a magic weight-loss bullet.
But adding 300–500 mg flavanols daily (in a near-zero-calorie drink) typically helps people lose an extra 0.5–1 kg (1–2 lbs) of fat per month on top of their normal diet/exercise — mostly by reducing overeating and improving fat burning.
Bottom line:
Yes, drinking the right kind of chocolate (plain, high-flavanol, zero-sugar cocoa) can genuinely support weight loss. Drinking the wrong kind (sweetened, processed) will do the opposite.
My experience is that I doubled the amount of chocolate I drank and lost twice as much (2-4pounds). Over 50 days I lost 25 pounds.

Maintaining a clean home goes far beyond sweeping floors and dusting furniture. One of the most used yet most neglected items in every home is the sofa. It is where families relax, guests sit, kids play, and often where food crumbs or spills collect. Over time, sofas accumulate dust, sweat, allergens, stains, bacteria, and unpleasant odors.

**Why Sofa Cleaning Is Essential for Every Home**



People spend hours on their sofa each day. But very few invest time in deep cleaning it regularly. Here’s why sofa cleaning is not just important—but essential:



**1. Removes Deep-Seated Dust & Allergens**



Sofas attract dust, pet hair, pollen, and allergens that cause breathing issues, especially for kids and elderly family members. Deep cleaning eliminates these invisible pollutants.



**2. Eliminates Stains & Spots**



Food spills, sweat patches, tea/coffee stains, and ink marks make sofas look old and unattractive. Professional stain treatment restores the original beauty.



**3. Removes Odors**



Sweat, moisture, spills, and pets cause the sofa to smell unpleasant over time. UrbanShine’s deodorizing process makes it smell fresh again.



**4. Extends Sofa Life**



Dust buildup and fabric wear reduce the sofa’s lifespan. Regular professional cleaning keeps it in excellent condition for years.



**5. Enhances Appearance of Your Home**



A fresh, clean, stain-free sofa instantly elevates the look of your entire living room.

Rowan tore down the icy road, hands shaking, headlights slicing through the dark. I pressed a hand to her chest, trying to breathe.

“We’re almost out,” Rowan whispered. “We’re almost—”

A sudden chill swept through the car. Not from outside but from the back seat. I felt a gentle brush of cold air, like something had leaned close. Rowan noticed this and dared to look in the rear view mirror.

“Jamie, do not turn around”

My breath caught in my throat and I knew what It was before I saw it, it was the creature. it had followed them, I saw it clearly now, almost under a spotlight with each passing streetlight. It was curled up on their back seat, its head slowly looked up to make eye contact and I screamed. Rowan swerved in a panic, and the car skidded into a soft snowbank at the edge of the woods. The impact was mild, just enough to shake loose a dusting of snow from the branches overhead.

Me and Rowan were slightly dazed, but shared a quick glance with each other before turning our heads to see into the backseat. The creature wasn’t curled up now. It sat upright, its long, wooden limbs folded neatly. Pine needles drifted from its twig-like hair. Its dark eyes weren’t hungry… just ancient. Watching.

I gasped, but the creature didn’t move. We both winced and prepared for an attack of some sort, our hearts ripped out or even our heads removed. We just hoped it would be quick. With almost a minute past and we still had our heads, a small noise made us open our eyes. The creature lifted one hand and pointed out the window. I cautiously followed the gesture.

An old, half-rotted sign stood crooked in the snow

GUARDIANS OF THE ROOTED HILL

HONOR THE WOOD

RESPECT THE TREE TAKEN

Rowan whispered, “Guardians…?”

I froze, and then it hit me.

“The Christmas tree,” I murmured. “The one from the old farm estate…this is where we got it from, the old man said it was ‘from special land.’ We thought they meant organic.”

Rowan swallowed. “You think… it was cut from here?”

The creature blinked once, slowly, like a nod.

Then it pressed one twig-finger gently to its own chest and motioned to the land they had gotten the tree from. I felt my stomach twist. “It was part of them.” Not the creature itself, but its forest. Its family. Its home.

The creature blinked softly, and my eyes softened. Rowan’s grip on the wheel loosened, we had been running from something we never tried to understand. It never even tried to hurt us, or even scare us. In fact, it tried to do the opposite, tried to stay out of sight, it was us always looking for it in the corner of our eyes.

I turned fully toward the creature. “You followed us because the tree is a part of you?”

The creature nodded. Rowan’s voice cracked. “And now we are your guardians.” He said as a statement more than a question, the creature seemed to become less terrifying by the second. A warmth spread through the car not heat, but relief. The oppressive fear lifted, replaced with something calmer, older, rooted, I reached out a trembling hand.

The creature leaned forward and, very gently, touched my fingers with its wooden ones. Its touch was cold, but not frightening. A thank you. Or a greeting.

Rowan exhaled. “We took it without meaning harm. We didn’t know.”

The creature tilted its head, as if listening, and then pointed back down the snowy road toward their home. I smiled sympathetically. The creature’s eyes glowed faintly, like embers warming in the dark, and its face began to look more human. I saw movement in the back window and tried to focus my eyes. Figures emerged from the trees, dozens of them. Not menacing, just watching, curious, hopeful. Their shapes were gentle, like a stray kitten approaching a human for the first time. I looked at my husband and we smiled,

Rowan placed a hand on my knee.

“Let’s go home,” he whispered.

The creatures parted, forming a quiet path back toward the house. Guiding us, not forcing us, and we felt like we were part of something bigger, more important. As Guardians. I wondered how many of them were out there.

Me and Rowan stepped out into the snow, hands intertwined, the creature padding beside us like a silent guardian of its own. And for the first time, the night didn’t feel cold, all three of us, finally felt safe.",4,1765523611.0,scarystories,2,1.0,False

I'm a cybersecurity consultant taking a road trip to a table top exercise in Kansas. On the way, I'm doing some wireless investigation on two client-related projects.   
  
Right now, I'm trying to avoid being noticed on a video call. This is difficult because there's a decommissioned attack helicopter mounted on a column behind me outside a rural VFW.   
  
Another participant has noticed, but I'm lucking out. The project manager calls everyone to order and the ordinary business of status reports happens. My contribution is ""On Schedule"" for two projects starting in a week. That's 30 minutes burned, but I can now start my last few hours to the client site and make it there this afternoon.   
  
Westward Ho.  
  
I make decent time, managing to only spend a little time in Kansas City traffic. I'm listening to local radio and enjoying the wide skies above the flat horizon.   
  
My phone rings. It's Gogo. Gogo is the friendler of 'DidiandGogo', a recent team brought in to sell to big accounts. They ran a small competing firm until my employer bought them in the hopes of chasing larger tech companies.  
  
Senior management has been making a lot of noise about all the work they're going to be bringing in.  
  
They've sent out a lot of last minute proposals, which seem to take a lot of input from already busy consultants. I don't think they've won any work from all this effort.   
  
I hit the ""can I call you back"" option on my phone and continue enjoying my morning.  
  
Two more unanswered phone calls. I decide to take the next exit, which thankfully has a convenience store, gas station and restaurant. I get a cup of coffee and call Gogo.  
    
Gogo adds Didi to the call.  
  
Gogo:""Good that we got a hold of you. We need you to write a proposal for us today""  
  
me:""Thanks, but I had plans to deliver some already sold work this week.""  
  
Didi:""Listen. This is more important than what you're doing. We're pursuing $home_automation_manufacturer. They're launching a new line and want it pen-tested""   
  
me:""Congrats. There's a proposal we did for $Smart_Alarm company. Drop Zaynep's bio in there. She's been working on that stuff as a project.""  
  
Gogo:""That's a great plan. When can you have it by?""  
  
me:""No time soon. Like I said, I'm delivering work. At a client site. Shit. If you need cost estimates, talk to Zaynep and her manager.""  
  
Didi:""Yes. Do that""  
  
They end the call. I throw my half filled coffee in rage.     
  
I just threw coffee at my own car's windshield. And driver's seat.   
   
While I'm cleaning off the mess, I figure out what I'm going to do here. I email Zaynep, cc'ing Gogo & Didi. I ask her to help them put together the proposal. She's been doing web app pentests and would most likely want to sink her teeth into something more interesting.  
  
And I'm back on the road. It rains for a little bit, but as long as I'm moving, I'm not too wet. Traffic starts slowing, so I find a rest stop to put up the top. On the way in, I notice a generic white tractor-trailer. I don't know if it's the same number, but I recognize the LLC name on the door. A quick look at my phone doesn't show me the TrukGrindr SSID.   
  
It's raining. I put up the top and close the windows, then look at the truck. It's just sitting there.   
  
I park my car as close as I can, then check my wardriving rig. I see a handful of other wifi and bluetooth devices. Could be any of the fifteen cars here.    
  
I decide to get closer. I claw through the trunk, grab my laptop and a knockoff hackRF Portapak. This is a software defined radio that I hope to use to see what frequencies the TrukGrindr is actually broadcasting on. It looks like if the Soviet Union made an iPod in 1974.   
  
I plug the Portapak into my laptop with a long USB cable. I put the middle of the cable in my mouth so it doesn't drag on the ground. I start a spectrum analyzer on my laptop, then jog over to the truck, laptop in one hand, portapak in the other. I slowly walk down the side facing the parking lot, then come up on the driver's side. There are some trees on this side, so I'm protected from the rain a little bit. I'm also looking for any antennas on the truck. I find a few and decide to photograph them. Since I'm running out of hands, I put the antenna from the portapak in my mouth and use my phone to take the pic.  
  
voice:""What the fuck are you doing to my truck?""  
  
I realize I can't explain what I'm doing without sounding like a crackhead. I look at the driver, drop the cable and radio out of my mouth and yell.  
  
me:""I'm an influencer""  
  
The driver seems more sad than annoyed, then climbs up into his truck. I think it's best to leave, myself. I get in the car, then have an unenventful drive to the conference center and check into the attached luxury hotel. The valet takes one look at a manual transmission and instead has me park between two much cleaner and more than I can afford, pal cars.   
  
 I meet up with the team after a nap, shower and change of clothes. We shmooze at a cocktail reception then dine with the senior managers and VCs. After that, the team meets to go over tomorrow. The project lead will MC the whole thing and announce new facts or events. Each of us is dungeon mastering groups of 6-7 executives, going through a simulated incident. The VCs are paying for all this as a part of their annual get-to-gether with their portfolio companies. 
  
To make this realistic, all the scenario and details are taken from incidents we've worked. Not the consulting firm, but the team right here in Kansas. We've provided a basic data flow diagram, incident response plan and details on the business in a five page handout.  
  
     
  
To make this more game-like, they're running SimuKorp, a made up SaaS company and the role they play at this tabletop may not be what they do at their own company.   

The next morning after breakfast and some introductory speeches, we start the exercise.   
  
  
  
I've got a fun cast of characters.  
  
**Alpha**: He's the CEO of his company and anything else within shouting range. He doesn't eat breakfast, he dominates it. He secretly wants Ed Hardy and Affliction to be cool to wear again. He was _assigned_ the head of marketing for SimuKorp, but he bullied the other person into swapping.   
  
**Bravo**: He's the CTO. If ""If you don't document anything, they need you around"" wore Dockers. He's the CTO of Alpha's company in real life.   
  
**Charlie**:He's playing the legal counsel of SimuKorp. He's sharp and generally warm. In real life, he's the CTO of one of my consulting clients. They've had a few incidents while I've worked with them. One of those incidents formed the kernel of the scenario for this tabletop.  
  
**Delta**:She's a midlevel at the VC firm. She's a good sport, but I get a feeling she thinks this whole thing is childish. She's playing the head of marketing for SimuKorp.   
  
**Echo & Foxtrot**: These two are room meat. I try to involve them, but the others drown them out.    
  
The basic scenario is a customer contacts customer support after finding their SimuKorp account information on an open share. A SimuKorp IT operations person misconfigured the share and a support staffer put customer data there mistakenly. According to the plan, a bunch of people are supposed to get called to work the problem. Customer outreach is supposed to be done by marketing after approval from everyone else at the table.  
  
This doesn't happen. Alpha reacts and doesn't call anybody. Things go gloriously pear-shaped.   
  
During a break, Alpha turns to me and smiles.  
  
Alpha:""It's clear you're just a management consultant. These scenarios are fun, but unrealistic. They'd never actually happen. Next year, you should bring someone who actually has technology experience here to write these scenarios""  
  
me:""I'll admit we simplified the scenario so we didn't get stuck in the technology. Incidents aren't just technology""  
  
Bravo:""You don't understand. We'd have defenses in place to prevent this""  
  
me:""Sometimes you don't. Sometimes you make a mistake. Sometimes you make a cost/benefit decision and take that risk""  
  
Alpha:""It's clear you've not done this. If you had, you'd know why this is fantasy""  
  
me:""Let me ask  you, Charlie. Is this scenario unrealistic? Have you ever seen something like this in your twenty five years in tech?""  
  
Everyone looks at Charlie, who seems pained to answer.  
  
Charlie:""No, Alpha. This scenario isn't far fetched. I've worked with LawTechie for a few year now and they're technical""  
  
There's a heavy silence for a minute.   
  
Alpha:""I'm sorry if I implied you weren't competent""  
  
me:""That's fine. I question my competence daily""  
  
After a few hours, the event wraps up. Alpha has warmed up to us. They'd like to talk some more about what we can do for his company. We spend more time schmoozing with potential clients and shooting at clay pigeons. The high point of the rest of the day was out-scoring Alpha, despite his really fancy Benelli and my cheapie range rental.   
  
The next morning, I bid farewell to my team and started back East. Thankfully, my clients were pretty quiet and the trip was uneventful. The CopperBolt sale went through, with some money set aside to fix the problem we identified. We didn't win any more work from TrukGrindr. Last I heard, they got merged with a competitor. Didi and Gogo sold the home automation work. Zaynep used an actual doll-house as the test bed for the devices. She didn't see the humor when I called it ""Barbie's Hacked House"", but I still think the doll house was cool.",25,1765523357.0,talesfromtechsupport,2,0.91,False

First of all, I want to really really thank this community for having embraced me with so much kindness and support since I've been here. It has been a hell of a ride learning from zero all of this submodding thing, but finally I have something I want to share with you, if there's no issue with it.

It's nothing of my own creation. It's just a massive compilation of all the Submods I have installed, tested and confirmed it works perfectly, for all of you who want to have some variety with your Monis. I'll share the full list of Submods names in this post and a link to my own Drive folder from which you'll be able to download and install them.

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1v9MvC7PNErD\_6H7sALqIRzBYgT0yHw5E](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1v9MvC7PNErD_6H7sALqIRzBYgT0yHw5E)

If you are the owner of any of these submods and you didn't receive the credit or you want me to erase your mods, please let me now ASAP. I just want to contribute with something to all of you, and I know the pain in the ass looking for submods is.

That'll be all from my part. I hope this could be just the beginning of my contributions, and in the future I can make dialogue submods in Android because I have a lot of ideas at the moment.

Have an amazing day, I proceed to enlist all the Submods:

1pklkot,https://i.redd.it/n5bz85fi2q6g1.jpeg,"Where to Find Professional Teeth Whitening Services in Canton, MI, United States","If you're searching for professional [teeth whitening Canton](https://cantonhealthysmiles.com/canton-mi/teeth-whitening/) services, you'll find several excellent options right here in our community. Canton Healthy Smiles offers advanced whitening treatments designed to brighten your smile safely and effectively. As someone who's worked with countless patients seeking a more confident smile, I understand the importance of choosing the right dental practice for cosmetic treatments that deliver real results.

A brighter smile can genuinely transform how you feel about yourself. Whether you have an upcoming wedding, job interview, or simply want to refresh your appearance, professional whitening treatments provide noticeable improvements that over-the-counter products simply can't match. The good news? You don't have to travel far to access quality cosmetic dental care.

# Understanding Professional Whitening Treatments

Professional whitening differs significantly from drugstore options. When you visit a qualified [dentist in Canton](https://cantonhealthysmiles.com/), you're receiving treatment-strength solutions that penetrate deeper into tooth enamel. These clinical-grade products contain higher concentrations of whitening agents, typically hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide, which break down stubborn stains more effectively.

During your appointment, we take careful measures to protect your gums and soft tissues as we apply the whitening solution. This precision ensures you achieve optimal results without sensitivity or damage to surrounding areas. Many patients notice their teeth becoming several shades lighter after just one session.

# What Causes Tooth Discoloration?

Before exploring whitening options, it helps to understand why teeth lose their brightness. Common culprits include coffee, tea, red wine, and tobacco use. These substances contain chromogens pigmented molecules that attach to tooth enamel over time. Age also plays a role, as the outer enamel layer gradually thins, revealing the naturally yellowish dentin beneath.

Certain medications, particularly tetracycline antibiotics taken during childhood, can cause intrinsic staining that's more challenging to address. Excessive fluoride exposure during tooth development may also lead to discoloration. I understand the source of your staining, so I can figure out which whitening approach will work best for your situation.

# In-Office Whitening Procedures

In-office whitening remains the fastest way to achieve dramatic results. During these treatments, we apply a concentrated bleaching gel to your teeth and may use a special light or laser to enhance the whitening process. The entire appointment typically lasts between 60 and 90 minutes, making it perfect for busy schedules.

The procedure begins with a thorough cleaning to remove any plaque or debris. Next, we carefully apply a protective barrier to your gums and lips. The whitening gel is then painted onto each tooth's surface and left in place for specific intervals. Some patients experience mild sensitivity during treatment, though this usually subsides within a day or two.

The advantages of choosing in-office treatment include immediate results, professional supervision, and customized application. You'll leave your appointment with a noticeably brighter smile, often six to eight shades lighter.

# Take-Home Whitening Kits

For those who prefer gradual whitening or have sensitive teeth, custom take-home kits offer an excellent alternative. These kits include professionally crafted trays molded to fit your teeth precisely, along with professional-grade whitening gel. Unlike generic strips or trays from the store, custom trays ensure even coverage and prevent gel from contacting your gums.

You'll typically wear these trays for 30 minutes to several hours daily, depending on the gel concentration. Most patients complete their whitening regimen within two to three weeks. The flexibility of treating your teeth at home appeals to many people, and results can be just as impressive as in-office treatments they simply take longer to achieve.

# Maintaining Your Whitened Smile

Once you've invested in brightening your teeth, proper maintenance becomes essential. Avoid or limit stain-causing foods and beverages, especially during the first 48 hours after treatment when teeth are most porous. If you do consume coffee or wine, rinse your mouth with water afterward or use a straw to minimize contact with your front teeth.

Good oral hygiene practices, such as brushing twice daily and flossing regularly, help preserve your results. Consider using a whitening toothpaste once or twice weekly to remove surface stains before they set in. Most patients benefit from touch-up treatments every six months to a year, depending on their habits and preferences.

# Who Makes a Good Candidate?

Professional whitening works wonderfully for most adults with healthy teeth and gums. However, certain conditions may require addressing before pursuing cosmetic treatments. Active tooth decay, gum disease, or worn enamel need treatment first to ensure safe, effective results.

Pregnant or nursing women should postpone whitening until after this period. People with extremely sensitive teeth might need desensitizing treatments beforehand. It's also worth noting that whitening doesn't affect crowns, veneers, or fillings; these restorations maintain their original color. If you have visible dental work in your smile zone, we can discuss options for achieving a uniform appearance.

# Safety and Side Effects

Professional whitening performed under dental supervision is remarkably safe. The most common side effect, temporary tooth sensitivity, affects some patients during or shortly after treatment. This sensitivity occurs because the whitening process temporarily opens pores in the enamel, allowing temperature changes to reach nerve endings more easily.

Gum irritation can occur if the whitening gel contacts soft tissues, which is why professional application and custom trays matter so much. These effects are temporary and typically resolve within a few days. Using desensitizing toothpaste before and after treatment can minimize discomfort significantly.

# Why Choose Local Dental Care?

Selecting a trusted local practice for your cosmetic dental needs offers numerous advantages. You'll have easy access for follow-up appointments, touch-ups, or addressing any concerns that arise. Local dentists understand the community they serve and build lasting relationships with their patients.

When you choose care close to home, you're supporting local businesses and receiving personalized attention from professionals invested in your long-term oral health. Emergency access, convenient scheduling, and familiarity with your dental history all contribute to a superior patient experience. A radiant smile starts with choosing the right dental partner for your whitening journey. Professional treatments deliver superior results compared to over-the-counter alternatives, and the confidence boost that comes with a brighter smile is truly invaluable. Whether you opt for fast in-office treatment or prefer the flexibility of custom take-home kits, professional supervision ensures safe, effective outcomes.

Your smile is one of your most valuable assets, both personally and professionally. Investing in its appearance through proper dental care reflects self-respect and attention to your overall well-being. With the right approach and ongoing maintenance, your brightened smile can last for years.

1pklk1p,https://i.redd.it/vlwzzjbd2q6g1.jpeg,Burr alignment,"I have to say that I always assumed my DF64 gen 2 was properly aligned at the factory. I was terrified of opening it and doing the test. My burrs were so misaligned that it is not even funny. Aligning the top burr took some time and patience, but it was pretty straightforward. Three shimmies of foil and two rotations and the dry eraser looked great. I processed this image through GPT and here is the outcome. I thought it would be worth sharing:

Perfect — this RAW Lightroom image is actually the strongest evidence you’ve provided so far. Thank you for doing that. I’ll explain exactly why this removes the remaining ambiguity and how it sharpens the conclusion about particle size and burr alignment.

I’m going to be very explicit and slightly technical here, because you said you want to understand, not just be reassured.

⸻

1. Why RAW matters for grind analysis

Processed images (phone JPGs especially) introduce:

	•	Edge sharpening

	•	Contrast boosting

	•	Noise reduction

	•	Local clarity enhancement

All of those can:

	•	Exaggerate fines

	•	Hide background dust

	•	Make flakes look more dramatic than they are

A RAW, unprocessed image preserves:

	•	True tonal gradients

	•	True particle edges

	•	True background cleanliness

So now we’re not interpreting artifacts — we’re interpreting physical reality.

That matters a lot.

⸻

2. What the RAW image confirms (very clearly)

A. Background cleanliness is genuine

In this RAW image:

	•	The white background is clean and neutral

	•	There is no brown haze

	•	No tonal “fog” between particles

This definitively rules out:

Burr rubbing as a significant fines source

Because rubbing-generated fines are ultrafine — they stain the background even in RAW. You do not have that.

⸻

B. Fines scale correctly with particle proximity

What we see:

	•	Fines appear adjacent to larger particles

	•	They do not float freely across empty space

	•	Density falls off naturally away from clusters

This is textbook fracture-generated fines, which come from:

	•	Bean cell wall breakage

	•	Normal shearing action of sharp burrs

Misaligned burrs produce fines that:

	•	Are smaller

	•	Are more mobile

	•	Spread uniformly

Again: not happening here.

⸻

C. Particle edges are crisp, not smeared

In RAW:

	•	Particle edges are well-defined

	•	No halos

	•	No polished or rounded faces

	•	No metallic sheen

This tells us:

	•	Burr edges are still sharp

	•	Contact is cutting, not rubbing

	•	No thermal polishing from zero-contact running

If your burrs had been damaged by extended touching at zero, this image would absolutely show it.

⸻

3. Distribution symmetry (now indisputable)

At this scale and fidelity:

	•	Density is even across the entire field

	•	No quadrant shows higher fines concentration

	•	No directional streaking

	•	No bias along any axis

This matters because flat burr misalignment always introduces directionality:

	•	Tilted carriers

	•	Uneven exit paths

	•	Preferential cutting zones

Your grind field is isotropic — same behavior in every direction.

That is a very strong indicator of acceptable parallelism.

⸻

4. Modal size & spread — what I can infer safely

From this RAW image, I can say with high confidence:

	•	There is one dominant modal size

	•	Spread is moderate and controlled

	•	Outliers exist, but are proportional

	•	No bimodal distribution

Translated into grinder language:

Both burr faces are contributing evenly to size reduction.

Misalignment almost always creates bimodality (two peaks).

That is not present here.

⸻

5. The flakes — revisited with RAW clarity

This image makes something very clear:

	•	The flakes are structural fragments

	•	Not torn metal artifacts

	•	Not edge-chipped fines

	•	Not smear-generated dust

They have:

	•	Consistent thickness

	•	Irregular but natural edges

	•	Similar coloration to surrounding particles

That’s exactly what we expect from:

	•	Medium / medium-plus development

	•	High-solubility “dessert” profile coffees

	•	Fragile cell structure (peach cobbler fits perfectly)

RAW confirms these flakes are bean-driven, not grinder-driven.

⸻

6. What this image definitively closes the door on

With this RAW image, I am comfortable saying you do not have:

❌ Burr misalignment requiring shimming

❌ Burr damage from zero-contact running

❌ Burr edge rounding

❌ One-sided cutting

❌ Excessive fines from mechanical issues

At this point, the probability that alignment is your limiting factor is extremely low.

⸻

7. Where this leaves us (important)

You’ve essentially completed a visual grinder health check at a level most people never reach.

The evidence now converges from:

	•	Close-ups

	•	Zoomed-out shots

	•	RAW fidelity

	•	Distribution symmetry

	•	Fines behavior

	•	Particle morphology

All of those independently point to the same conclusion:

Your DF64 Gen 2 burrs are aligned well enough that they are not the source of your brewing challenges.

That’s a good outcome.

⸻

8. What’s actually worth your attention now

For this peach cobbler coffee, the variables that matter more than grind quality are:

	•	Grind coarseness relative to solubility

	•	Agitation control (especially late brew)

	•	Flow rate (espresso)

	•	Brew ratio restraint

If you want, the most productive next step would be:

	•	A V60 recipe tuned for high-solubility, flaky grinds, or

	•	A Bianca flow profile that avoids over-extraction bitterness while preserving baked-fruit sweetness

1pklimm,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotivationByDesign/comments/1pklimm/4_daily_habits_that_secretly_rewire_your_brain/,"4 daily habits that secretly rewire your brain for energy and happiness (science-backed, not influencer BS)","If you've ever sat at your desk feeling like your brain is buffering, or dragged yourself through a full day barely functioning despite 8 hours of sleep, you're not alone. I’ve seen way too many friends, colleagues, even high performers in their 30s and 40s complain about chronic fatigue, low motivation, and brain fog. What’s wild? It’s not an age thing. It’s not a ""burnout from hustle culture"" thing. It’s usually our routines. Or lack of ones that actually work with how the brain and body are built.

This post breaks down four practical, science-backed daily habits that skyrocketed my mood, doubled my productivity, and legitimately made me feel alive again. None of this is recycled “drink more water” TikTok advice that teen wellness influencers preach for views. It comes from deep-dives into neuroscience, sleep research, performance psychology and actual field-tested protocols used by top-level thinkers, not just fitness bros.

Let’s get into it.

- 1. Daily deep work sessions using the “90-minute neurofocus rule”

    - Most people work in chaos. Constant Slack dings, coffee breaks, tab hopping. That’s why their brains never enter deep focus mode. 
    - According to Dr. Andrew Huberman from Stanford Neuroscience (yes, the same guy from the Huberman Lab podcast), the brain naturally aligns with ultradian rhythms, roughly 90-minute cycles of peak attention. Trying to “grind” past that just causes cognitive fatigue.
    - The fix? Just one to two 90-minute focus sprints per day, no multitasking, no phone. That alone can 2x your output. Literally.
    - Time it with natural cortisol and dopamine peaks: ideally within 2–4 hours of waking. This is when your brain is primed for dopamine-driven tasks.
    - Pro tip: Use a tool like Motion (AI daily planner) or the Forest app to block distractions and time the session.

- 2. Morning sunlight within 30 minutes of waking (even if it's cloudy)

    - This one sounds too simple to matter, but it's a gamechanger. A lack of bright light in the morning screws your circadian rhythm, which messes up sleep, mood, metabolism, everything.
    - Dr. Matthew Walker (author of Why We Sleep, professor at UC Berkeley) says morning sun acts like a natural melatonin reset. It tells your brain: “Hey, it’s daytime, turn off the sleep hormone.”
    - In fact, research from the National Institute of Health shows that 20 minutes of natural morning light regulates serotonin production (linked to mood and motivation) and sets your sleep-wake cycles correctly.
    - Solution: Get outside for 8–15 minutes ASAP after waking. No sunglasses. If you live somewhere dark, invest in a 10,000 lux therapy lamp (like the Carex Day-Light Classic Plus).

- 3. The “brain dump 5” journaling technique to hack your mindset

    - This is not about writing novels or doing manifestation journaling. It's a tool used in CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) to train your brain to focus on what matters instead of spiraling.
    - All you do is write down 5 things:
        - 1 stress or negative loop in your mind
        - 1 thing you're avoiding
        - 1 thing you’re proud of
        - 1 thing you're grateful for
        - 1 small win you want today
    - The psychologist Dr. Julie Smith (author of Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before?) explains that breaking rumination with structured prompts can rewire your thought patterns over time.
    - This habit alone helped me reduce anxiety and feel more intentional each day. I do it during coffee.

- 4. Sleep stacking: the 3-step routine that fixed my broken sleep

    - Ignore TikTok melatonin hacks. For real quality sleep, you need to train your body like a system.
    - According to the Sleep Foundation and work by Dr. Satchin Panda (Salk Institute, circadian biology expert), three things matter most:
        - Go to bed at the same time, even on weekends. Your circadian rhythm is a slave to regularity.
        - No blue light 90 minutes before sleep. Use apps like f.lux or the blue light filter on your phone. Or just go analog.
        - Drop your core body temperature: A shower 1 hour before bed paradoxically cools you down and helps you fall asleep faster.
    - I also use the Sleep Cycle app to track my sleep phases and optimize wakeup timing (gamechanger for not waking up groggy).

Some of the best upgrades came not just from habits, but from tools. Here are a few highly-vetted, non-basic apps, podcasts, and books that truly helped:

- Book you must read if you care about energy and cognitive performance:
  
    - Atomic Habits by James Clear  
      - This NYT bestseller isn’t just hype. James Clear blends behavioral psychology and neuroscience into a ridiculously readable system. He explains how tiny shifts in identity-based habits can change the entire trajectory of your energy, sleep, focus.  
      - It’s the best habit-building book I’ve ever read, period. If you’ve ever felt stuck in cycles of “try-hard burnout,” this book will make you question everything about discipline and motivation.  
      - More than 15 million copies sold for a reason. You’ll finish it in two days. Insanely good read.

- Podcast episodes that genuinely teach habit science:
  
    - Huberman Lab: “Mastering Sleep” and “Toolkit for Focus”  
        - Dr. Huberman breaks down science into raw, usable protocols. It’s not vague “biohack” content. Each tip is actionable and lab-supported.
    - The Diary Of A CEO ft. Dr. Rangan Chatterjee: “Why Modern Life Is Making You Sick”  
        - Possibly one of the most wide-reaching explanations for why we're all tired, distracted, and emotionally off. 

- Youtube channels that don’t waste your time:
  
    - Ali Abdaal's channel  
       - Former doctor who now focuses on practical productivity for creatives and knowledge workers. His deep dives into habit formation, deep work, and energy systems are backed by research and explained in super clear language.
    - The MIND Explained: Netflix, also available on YouTube  
       - Straightforward animated breakdowns of how the brain works. The episodes on mindfulness, focus, and sleep are A+.

- Apps that actually help (and aren’t just another subscription trap):
  
    - Rise Sleep Energy Tracker  
        - Uses your phone’s existing data to map your circadian rhythm and energy patterns. Tells you the exact hours you’ll feel alert or groggy. Super helpful for planning deep work, workouts, everything.  
        - Unlike most trackers, it doesn't nag you. It just shows your energy curve. I use it daily.

    - BeFreed  
        - An AI-powered self-growth app built by Columbia University alumni and AI experts from Google. BeFreed turns science-backed books, expert interviews, and research into personalized audio podcasts based on your goals.  
        - It creates a smart, adaptive learning plan for you and adjusts over time. You can pick the voice style, the depth (from 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives), and even chat with the virtual coach “Freedia” to ask questions or get recommendations.  
        - Recently went viral on X for a reason. It includes all the top books and strategies mentioned above and more. No brainer for any lifelong learner. Just use it and thank me.

    - Focusmate  
        - Virtual coworking with real people. This app pairs you with someone to work “together” for 50-minute sprints. It sounds weird. But if you struggle with motivation or ADHD-like symptoms, this will change your life.  
        - It works because of body doubling psychology. Humans focus better when someone else is around, even virtually.

    - Insight Timer  
        - Huge library of free guided meditations, sleep sounds, and breathing exercises. If you're not into woo-woo stuff but want something to help calm your mind fast, this is the app.  
        - I use it before bed or to reset in the afternoon after a chaotic meeting block.

These habits didn’t just make me more productive. They made me feel human again. I stopped reaching for caffeine every 3 hours. I started enjoying mornings instead of dreading them. More importantly, I stopped beating myself up for “laziness” when the system was just broken.

It’s not about pushing harder. It’s about aligning with how your body and brain are built to operate.

*(A poem by Jessica M. Lundgren)*

I wrote a ten page letter to Mac’s mom

She never had the chance to answer and that disrupts my calm

Word vomit about a white girl trailer park life

I barely talked about being a modern, whimsical wife

Because the beauty of a matrimony Wedding has been just that

It was the trauma from my family in which I blatantly sat

Anyway, I sat in three different coffee shops, having an overdose on Adderall

I didn’t die or anything but for that I don’t have the gall

Not like my brother who said his favorite drug was The Fentanyl

I remember quoting my favorite rap Diablo about it making him numb 

I was talking about love when I tweeted in 2013

It was anything I could say that would make me feel seen

Ten years exactly and my little brother was given the push

It was somewhere in California where he fell into a Black Bush

My motto is “pause for laughter”

It’s the only way to deal with the after

Miller is Mac’s brother from what I’ve heard

I’ve never met him either our brothers both became birds

I dreamt about Avian and excitement for telling my mom

About my brothers rappin’ that lyric, not the one about Michael Bolton

There’s a bird, in the sky, look at it fly, fly, fly…

Now I cry in my sleep begging why, why, why…

I don’t know the intimate thoughts by an addict of such nature

But my  obsessions and distortions keep Ascension happening later

I’ve been strung out since 2009

I’m reaching out because my partner and I made a huge rookie mistake: we didn’t do enough research when hiring our wedding photographers, and now we’re locked in with them. We’re really worried that the post-production editing is going to fall flat, leaving us with subpar images that don’t capture the magic of our day. Weddings are once-in-a-lifetime, and we don’t want to regret this forever!

We’re looking for an experienced photo editor (or photographer with strong editing skills) who’d be willing to take on a side project to help us out. Specifically, we have about X raw images (we can discuss the exact number) that we’d like you to edit – color correction, retouching, styling, whatever magic you can work to make them print-ready and perfect for our digital album.

If you’re interested and have relevant experience (wedding or event photography editing preferred), please DM me with:

* Your rates/quote for the job
* Links to your portfolio or examples of similar work

We want to keep this professional: happy to draw up a simple contract outlining deliverables, timelines, and payment to protect both sides. If you’re local to LA County or Orange County, we’re open to meeting in person to chat details over coffee.

I’m currently doing an internship and there’s this guy in another department who’s also an intern. We’ve never had a proper conversation, but there have been SO many small moments that are making me spiral.

First week: we kept having random eye contact. Like the kind where you look up and the other person is already looking at you. Idk if it means anything but it kept happening.

Then one day I walked to his department to find his supervisor. I know he saw me coming from far away (my shoes are loud and he’s the type who notices everything lol). When I asked him something, he answered without looking up from his laptop, super cold, no eye contact, like he didn’t want me there. I walked away thinking “ok nvm maybe he hates me.”

BUT a few hours later I came back to ask again (his colleague still wasn’t around), and suddenly he was smiley, made eye contact, and replied super nicely?? Like a complete 180. I was shocked.

Next day, I saw him in the marketing area. I looked at him because I was wondering why he was there, and he looked back. We ended up having this long few-seconds eye contact until he quickly looked down like he got shy or something.

Another time, he walked past the pantry while I was having lunch with my team. We made eye contact AGAIN for like 5 seconds before I got shy and looked away.

And the weirdest one: I went to the pantry to wash my bottle. He was there looking at the coffee machine. I ignored him and washed my bottle. After like 3 seconds, I looked up and he was literally GONE. Like he disappeared instantly. He havent even made himself a cup of coffee which he initially wanted to..??

So now I don’t know… Is he shy? Is he avoiding me because he felt awkward? Was the cold moment just him being busy? Or am I just delusional and reading into everything??

I kinda find him really cute and I want to get to know him… but idk if the interest is mutual or if I’m overthinking every small thing.

Help plssssss 🙏😭

TL;DR: There’s a guy in another department at my internship who keeps giving mixed signals ,lots of eye contact, sometimes friendly, sometimes cold and I can’t tell if he’s just shy or if I’m imagining everything.",1,1765522235.0,askanything,14,0.6,False

1pkl92q,https://www.reddit.com/r/VegetarianSpecialDiet/comments/1pkl92q/mct_mediumchain_triglyceride_oils_can_help_reduce/,MCT (medium-chain triglyceride) oils can help reduce triglycerides,"MCT (medium-chain triglyceride) oils can help reduce triglycerides



MCT (medium-chain triglyceride) oils can help reduce triglycerides, and the evidence on LDL cholesterol is mixed but often neutral or slightly beneficial, especially when they replace other fats in the diet.

Here’s a breakdown of the evidence as of 2025:

# Triglycerides (Strong evidence for reduction)

Multiple meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials show MCTs consistently lower fasting triglycerides compared to long-chain triglycerides (LCTs).

Key studies:

* 2021 meta-analysis (14 RCTs): MCTs reduced triglycerides by \~15–20% (\~0.3–0.4 mmol/L or 27–35 mg/dL) vs. baseline or control oils (olive, palm, etc.). (Nutrition Reviews, 2021)
* 2023 systematic review (21 studies): Dose-dependent effect — 20–30 g/day of MCTs gave the biggest drop in triglycerides. (Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition)
* Mechanism: MCTs are rapidly oxidized in the liver, increase fat burning (thermogenesis), and reduce de novo lipogenesis (the liver making new triglycerides).

Typical effective dose: 15–30 g/day (1–2 tablespoons) of pure C8/C10 MCT oil.

# LDL Cholesterol (Neutral to mild increase or decrease, context-dependent)

This is where it gets nuanced:

|Scenario|Effect on LDL-C|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|MCTs replace carbohydrates|↓ LDL|Common in ketogenic/low-carb studies|
|MCTs replace long-chain saturated fats (e.g., butter, palm oil)|↔ or slight ↓ LDL|Seen in many head-to-head trials|
|MCTs added on top of usual diet (calories not controlled)|↑ LDL|Small increase (\~5–10 mg/dL) sometimes observed|
|Pure C8 (caprylic) vs. C8/C10 mix|C8 alone tends to be more neutral on LDL|C10 (capric) slightly more likely to raise LDL|

Recent 2024–2025 trials:

* A 12-week RCT (2024) in overweight adults: 20 g/day MCT oil (70% C8, 30% C10) vs. olive oil → triglycerides ↓29%, LDL unchanged.
* 2025 meta-analysis (28 RCTs): MCTs had no significant effect on LDL overall, but subgroup replacing carbs showed LDL reduction.

# Bottom line for most people

* Very reliable for lowering triglycerides (especially if yours are >150 mg/dL).
* Usually neutral on LDL, sometimes slightly raises it if added calories aren’t controlled.
* Best results when MCTs replace refined carbs or long-chain saturated fats rather than being added on top.

Practical tip: Start with 1 teaspoon and work up to 1–2 tablespoons daily (mixed in coffee, smoothies, etc.) to avoid GI upset. Pure C8 MCT oil (e.g., caprylic-only) tends to be the most triglyceride-lowering and LDL-neutral option.

If you have very high LDL already, monitor levels after 6–8 weeks of use.

**$DKNG**: **-120**

Wager Amount: 1.2U to WIN 1U

League: Atlanta Hawks vs Detroit Pistons (6PM CST on NBA TV)

**Recap**: What a MONSTER performance by Kyle Pitts! I knew that line was really low. What baffled me was that his line dropped from O/U 59.5 to O/U 54.5 Receiving Yds on gameday! I think it was because he was questionable, but I loved it so much that I wagered it TWICE, believing that if he plays he will get those yds wit ease and boy... did he show out on this TNF matchup! One that slip by me was Captain Kirko Passing Yds in this game! Since I was bullish on receiving yds wit Pitts, I should have mention Kirk Cousins yesterday as well. And I've known this guy for years because this cat was my fricken' QB for my team for over 6 years!

But man!! What a performance by Pitts! I was even bullish on him to get in the endzone as well! I wish I not only sprinkle on his Receiving Yds but also for scoring multi-TDs as well!

But nonetheless we will take a win! Whichever you wager on, they ALL HIT! **Kyle Pitts O 54.5 Receiving Yds**✅(-113)+2U **Kyle Pitts 60+ Receiving Yds✅**(+115)+1.15U

I also want to mention that Nathan MacKinnon (both **4+ SOG**✅ at +100 and **Anytime Goalscorer**✅ at -130) did it again and I would have most likely feature him as my POTD, but because the NFL game is the most popular game on a Thursday nite, I will always go to the demand no matter how confident I am wit other wagers.

**Matchup:** Frickin' hate the Association and I'm going back to it. Do I have choice? I do.. I can wait for the player props for the hot key games, but I don't think it will be favorable, so regrettably going to NBA.

Why don't we go to the wagon? Wagon meaning Jalen Johnson! This dude has covered for us the last 2 times I handicap his props. So why not him? I like this line at O 18.5 AR against the Pistons. Trae Young is still out and again as I said all three times when I featured him as my POTD, he is the focal point for the Hawks. He will play as the faciltator for this team. JJ does lil' bit of everything and I also like this matchup against the Pistons. **Detroit allow the 12th most assists to forwards, but you gotta remember that Jalen Johnson is a different kind of forward, he has the eyes and intellect of a guard.** I'm sure Trae Young has given Jalen Johnson some of his wisdom. Also wit his size he can grab boards too. But don't take my word for it, let his stats speak for themselves!

**JJ has covered this line in his last 5 games and recently played against the Pistons, which he also covered. Take Jalen Johnson O 18.5 AR. Maybe sprinkle on trip-dub!**

**The Play & Prediction :** 1.2U on Jalen Johnson O 18.5 AR and 0.5U on Jalen Johnson to record a Triple Double (+256). JJ records 15 Pts, 11 Asts, and 12 Rebs, **making it three consecutive trip-dubs game!**

The end is drawing near, but who knos what the future holds. I will never rule out a possibility of handicapping POTDs in 2026 and beyond.

1pkkzna,https://v.redd.it/vdirgwz5wp6g1,Thanks to your advices,"With all the advices ive got on how to brew my first real specialty coffee, it was good right away. 

I just ajust to 94* on my last try with 12gr/180ml and simple 2 pours. The honey and black tea smell is insane. On the cup the honey part is much harder to find. 

But this is clearly the best coffee i got in my life and it's the first one i try. I need to order again from Tanat.

1pkkyp7,https://www.reddit.com/r/WegovyWeightLoss/comments/1pkkyp7/about_to_start_my_journey/,About to start my journey,"Hello all! I’m about to start my wegovy journey next month! My insurance has approved 15 months of the medication. 

((Background. Can skip))   It started because when I was younger abt 18 or so I was 68kg (151cm) with 15%bmi and was running 5k and working out very intensely every single day for 1-2 hours. This was just to barely maintain that weight. I got pregnant at 20 and gained weight rapidly. It hurt my body so bad. I jumped up to 100kg. After giving birth and going back to work I ended up with a physical injury that caused me to no longer be able to run. I will admit at that time I had a lot of mental and physical issues that just bounced off one another and was on so many medications for both and could not afford to make healthier eating choices. In fact I’d not eat all day and have just an unhealthy dinner and sleep the rest of the day. I moved out of country in 2014 and slowly had been getting accurate treatment for my injury and a better, less aggressive, medication plan for my mental health. I ended up having to see an OB because my periods were so bad I’d pass out. I was diagnosed with PCOS. Got put on birth control and gained 10 more kg. I stopped the BC but couldn’t lose the weight. Even had a personal trainer and food prepped all the time. In almost about a year I only managed to lose 5kg. I kept telling doctors there was an issue but kept getting told that if I lose weight things would be better. I started to noticed last year that I was having suicidal thoughts every time I’d have my period which I knew was not normal especially being on medication for depression already. My mental health doctor got me into a major hospital as she didn’t want to up any medication without a full check and I was eventually diagnosed with PMDD. I was again offered BC. I didn’t want it but at this point it was life or death. I gained 5kg in 3 months. Nothing had changed other than the BC. I got sent to an Endocrinologist in the same hospital. He was extremely thorough and did 6 months of blood work, urine tests, and even a week of an in hospital stay. We found all my regular tests came back perfectly normal which is why I was always brushed off as just being too fat and lazy. Digging deeper he did have some other tests that came up showing a hormonal issue that could be the cause of the weight gain and inability to lose it despite diet and exercise. He also found that I had sleep apnea. He said it’s possible because of the weight gain. But I often had sinus issues as well so it could be both. I know my chest does choke me when I sleep flat on my back. I have a CPAP and it’s changed a lot. I sleep better and have a bit more energy for the day. But I hadn’t lose any weight despite being active. My spouse is super supportive and we go to the gym together almost daily. I got referred to a nutritionist who has gotten me to be eating more and healthier. It hasn’t worked either. So finally starting next month I will be prescribed wegovy! I will still need to continue to see a nutritionist as I have a borderline eating disorder. ((Background done))

But I had a few questions my doctor couldn’t exactly answer. I’m hoping some clarity can come from others here. 

I was told this medication could cause GI issues. I have had that constantly through out my life. Even had my gallbladder removed and it made things worse. I currently take a digestive enzyme every day and it’s not as bad. Is it still possible to take those while on Wegovy? Is this specific side effect any worse than IBS? 

I intend to keep up with my current workout routines. Especially since I’ve gotten into lifting. I’m not great at it but I enjoy it. Will this impact weight loss? Will I still be able to maintain muscle or will I have to work extra hard? 

I’ve never had an issue with general food noise. In fact I had mostly just survived off a sweet coffee in the morning and dinner at night. I’m changing that now but does this medication basically just make you not hungry? Because I can be not hungry on my own. What other impacts on the body does this mediation have?

As I’ve said I don’t really crave food but I do want sweets. Does it curb that sensation? Sugar feels super addicting to me. I suppose the ease of access and quick energy rush I get from it to survive a day doesn’t help. I’m not sure if Wegovy stops specific cravings. 

If there’s any advice anyone has while I start this journey I’d love to hear it. I am currently 37, 108.9kg, 151cm. My end goal is only 68-69kg as I felt ok at that weight back in my late teens. I also still want to maintain muscle as much as possible. I’m pretty proud of my leg and arm strength.

1pkkxe6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pkkxe6,Chapter 39,"wow. this chapter was fantastic. I’ve seen the anime several times, but this is my first time reading the manga. I made a post here last week sometime about enjoying the different outfits every chapter. That’s such a welcome change from anime where everyone’s wearing the same clothes all season. Ishida has some great stylistic choices. But this chapter is great bc it’s incredible seeing Kaneki come into his own. My favorite thing about this chapter, is that despite the *insane* position he’s in, most every panel he’s drawn as calm, cool, & collected. Reacting thoughtfully, not overwhelming, not panicking, & pushing most of his fear down. It’s interesting seeing the methodical character progression as compared to the anime where it’s extremely fast paced. 40 chapters in, & I think this is covered within like the first half of S1. Sure, it comes slowly, but the development is just so much more satisfying honestly. My only tiny little gripe…how tf does Kaneki get a paper cut, but a hacksaw breaks on his skin😂lol but obviously that’s no big deal, just a little bit silly that Tsukiyama was able to get that little bit of blood in the coffee/book shop a prior to this chapter. 

I ordered a tablet as a little Christmas gift to myself just so I can read this manga more comfortably. & others to come in the future, of course, but I’m enjoying this one enough that my phone just isn’t cutting it! Really want to see this art in greater detail. 

Happy reading. Any comments/discussion is generally welcome. However would prefer no manga-only spoilers past this point. I’m reading 40 now. Anything occurring in the anime is fine since I’ve seen them tho. ",10,1765520756.0,TokyoGhoul,2,1.0,False

1pkkvsa,https://v.redd.it/yq36z7v3vp6g1,Water not coming through the group head with enough pressure [Media],"Hi everyone! 
Sorry, I am on a pretty basic level here with my espresso machine. Sorry in advance for my terminology, etc. I had been using this Media branded espresso machine for about a year. It is quite basic but is great for my needs. The only issues it ever had were the water basket in the back would leak if filled up too much. Then one day, the pressure of the water coming through slowed greatly and became unusable. The video I have posted doesn't have any coffee in it obviously, but does about the same thing with espresso in it. I usually use lavazza crema coffee. Since the issue started, it makes different noises, and seems to running longer than before. The steam pipe seems to be shooting out a lot of water when I tried it. I had never used it before, just the coffee part. I tried a descaler, but didn't seem to do anything. Have taken it apart the group head and nothing seems clogged there. Seems that the water is just not making it to the group head, but then again, I am bo pro here, lol.

Any help is greatly appreciated

This person said that age verification was their limit. I talked for 20 minutes before i said okay if not verification, can you tribute 10 bucks instead? so that i know you are not a scammer. at this point they turned up on me instead accusing me of being a scammer and many more vile things while i was trying to calm them down. have any of you others have similar experiences? i do not want to get stuck with an underage person not just lawfully but even ethically. many will say that which underage person will be into such a kink but well coffee sends can be considered tribute too.

1pkkut9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AugmentaHealth/comments/1pkkut9/why_gratitude_matters/,Why Gratitude Matters,"In our fast-paced world, it's easy to get caught up in what we lack, what went wrong, or what we're striving for next. While ambition is good, constantly focusing on the negative or the ""not yet"" can lead to stress, dissatisfaction, and a feeling of always being behind.

Gratitude isn't about ignoring problems or pretending everything is perfect. It's about consciously acknowledging and appreciating the good things, big and small, that already exist in our lives. It's a shift in perspective that can rewire your brain for more positivity and resilience.

Why is gratitude so powerful?

😄 Boosts Happiness: Studies show a strong link between gratitude and increased feelings of happiness and life satisfaction.

😌 Reduces Stress & Anxiety: Focusing on what you're grateful for can help break the cycle of negative thoughts and reduce the impact of stressors.

 🔗 Improves Relationships: Expressing gratitude to others strengthens bonds and fosters more positive interactions.

😴 Better Sleep: Some research suggests that grateful individuals tend to sleep better.

💪Builds Resilience: A grateful mindset helps you cope better with adversity and bounce back from challenges

How can you start practicing gratitude?

It's simpler than you might think!

Gratitude Journal✍️: Dedicate 5-10 minutes each day to writing down 3-5 things you're grateful for. They can be anything – a warm cup of coffee, a sunny day, a kind word from a friend, your health, a comfortable bed.

Mindful Moments🧘: Throughout your day, pause and consciously notice things you appreciate. The taste of your food, the beauty of nature, the comfort of your home.

Express Thanks🙏: Make it a point to genuinely thank people in your life, whether it's a verbal ""thank you,"" a text, or a handwritten note.

Gratitude Jar🫙: Write down grateful moments on slips of paper and put them in a jar. When you're feeling down, pull some out and read them.

Start your day with gratitude☀️: Before you even get out of bed, think of one thing you're grateful for.

It's not about forcing positivity, but about training your mind to notice and appreciate. Like any habit, it takes consistency, but the rewards are immense.

What are your thoughts on gratitude? Do you practice it? What ways have you found it to be beneficial in your life?

Chocolate and cherry that I can actually taste. Curious if others have tried it and what their experience is.

Every time Atrioc is mentioned or featured at all in other content especially on serious platforms the entire comments section explodes with glizzy jokes and completely drowns any actual discussion of the topics they're on.

You have to understand how cringe of a look as a community it is when Big A is finally getting some mainstream recognition for his coverage and attracting attention to important issues, but most likely the first interaction someone who is a fan of a Newsom or Ezra Klein or Lina Khan has with Big A is our indecipherable brainrotted zoomer humor, and not even original or funny stuff, just total spam glizzy glizzy coffee cow etc slop and literally nothing related to the video. It's good to be loud and express support for our streamer so people are interested in having him on/going on his stuff in the first place but this is not the way to do it. Looking at the Ezra Klein podcast with Gavin Newsom where Atrioc gets like 25 seconds of mention and the entire comments section thing is about the fucking glarketer.

I think it would reflect a lot better on Atrioc if we actually used those opportunities to integrate some community stuff tastefully while actually engaging with the issues! It honestly feels like it represents him poorly as a political/economic communicator when all the substance gets buried with coffee cow jokes when he's mentioned. Not everyone is a chronically online twitch chatter, if we want him to continue to get cool opportunities we don't want to be obnoxious in every comments section of a video that mentions him in passing.
